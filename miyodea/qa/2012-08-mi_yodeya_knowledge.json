    "content": "# Why does the 5th verse of \"Yigdal\", not mention prayer as does the 5th principle of faith of the Rambam?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The piyyut, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigdal\">“Yigdal”</a>, seems to put the 13 principles of faith of the Rambam in poetic form. </p>\n\n<p>With number 5, the author of Yigdal seems to have made a slightly different point to the Rambam by leaving out all reference to prayer. </p>\n\n<p>Question 1: Why?</p>\n\n<p>Rambam: אני מאמין באמונה שלימה שהבורא יתברך שמו לו לבדו ראוי להתפלל ואין  ראוי להתפלל לזולתו</p>\n\n<p>Yigdal: הינו אדון עולם לכל נוצר יורה גדלותו ומלכותו</p>\n\n<p>There is a different version of the text in Yigdal, הִנּוֹ אֲדוֹן עוֹלָם <strong>וְכָל</strong> נוֹצָר\nיוֹרֶה גְּדֻלָּתוֹ וּמַלְכוּתוֹ where changing one letter transforms the sense of the verse. </p>\n\n<p>Question 2: Is this related to the Rambam's article?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rabbi Dr. Marc Shapiro <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2007/09/marc-shapiro-what-do-adon-olam-and-mean.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">asked that question as well</a>. He points out that several variants of the text would better bring out the \"pray only to G-d\" concept.</p>\n<p>If I recall correctly, Lord Sacks just tweaks the punctuation, and also gets the point across:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הינו אדון עולם;  <em>לכל נוצר</em> יורה גדלותו ומלכותו</p>\n<p>G-d is Master of the World; He reveals His Greatness and Kingship [directly] to every creature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, there is no need for an intermediary when praying.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R' Yaakov Weinberg preferred the variant Vilna version of the text with יודה in place of יורה for this reason.</p>\n\n<p>In Even Sh'sia, R' Bechhofer suggests that this verse of Yigdal fits with the idea of the 5th principle quite nicely.  The point of worshiping Hashem alone is not a rule in a vacuum.  The reason to worship Hashem alone is, as the Rambam writes in the introduction to Chelek, לפי שכולם מוטבעים ועל פעולתם אין משפט ולא בחירה אלא לו לבדו הש\"י - because all other beings are ingrained and Hashem is the only one with freedom of will.  The reason that we worship Him alone is because of His absolute dominion.  הינו אדון עולם, He is the Master of the world, is the underlying principle of our worshiping Him alone.  We recognize that no other creation has any authority, and therefore worship Him alone.</p>\n\n\n",

This contrasts with the principles of just war outlined in the verses you quoted, in which we are to give fair warning before an attack, to give the enemy a chance to leave or make peace. [We are also told (Jerusalem Talmud, Sheviis 6:1) that Joshua, before leading the Jews into the Land of Canaan, did the same thing, sending each of the Canaanite city-states a message offering them a three-way choice: leave the country and be given safe-conduct (one of the Canaanite nations, the Girgashites, took him up on this); stay put and make a peace treaty (on the terms outlined in the verses you cited - see below; the Gibeonites did so, as described in Josh. 9); or fight.]</p>\n<p>The special enmity to Amalek, though, has other bases as well. One of them is, as Rashi points out there, that they were the first to attack the Jews after the Exodus and the splitting of the Red Sea, and by doing so they undermined the impact, and the respect for G-d's power, that these miracles had created in the surrounding nations. There is also the idea, based on the phrase at the end of the verse there that Amalek \"did not fear G-d,\" that they are the prototypical ones who \"know their Master and deliberately rebel against Him\" (see yoel's comment on the question). Chassidic teaching also goes further and identifies the \"coldness\" that Amalek promoted (see Rashi there) as apathy towards G-d and His Torah - a very dangerous spiritual enemy indeed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>That the inhabitants of a conquered town (or those who accepted Joshua's second option, as above) are to be \"serving you in forced labor\" does not mean that they become people's personal slaves. The Hebrew is יהיו לך למס ועבדוך, which might better be translated \"shall be tributary to you and serve you\" - which means exactly what it sounds like: they are to be subjects of the Jewish state, which can requisition their labor for public works projects and the like, something to which born Jews were also occasionally liable (I Sam. 8:11ff; I Kings 5:27 and 15:22), and which was the norm in the ancient world (i.e., these people were equally liable to be drafted for government service under their previous ruler). For example, in the case of the Gibeonites, mentioned above, Joshua put them to work for the Tabernacle and later for the Temple - <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15793#v23\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Josh. 9:23</a>,27.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Yeast is used in wine production which is ok to eat, but I've talked to people that won't eat yeast extract, which is not a leavener. Is there a correct answer or is this a gray area?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>My understanding is it all depends on what the yeast grew. If it grew off of wheat or barley or the like, it's a problem.</p>\n\n<p>As I heard from one OU lecture, an interesting ingredient in today's food production is \"torula yeast.\" Paper makers had all this \"pine wood soup\" from cooking their shredded pulp, which they couldn't just pour down the drain for environmental reasons. So a type of yeast which loves to eat pine soup became popular, breaking down the waste product much better -- and as it turns out, torula yeast is a nice food ingredient, and all it's grown off is pine wood, so there are virtually no kashrut or allergy issues with it! (May still need Passover supervision, though.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.hechshers.info/glossary/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> glossary, Se'or, the somewhat lesser known, but no less prohibited, sibling of Hametz, includes the yeast extract products known as Marmite and  Vegemite. Unfortunately, I don't know on what basis they make this assertion. I can think of at least two possible reasons, but I am not sure of either of them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It depends on the source of the yeast. Yeast itself is NOT chametz (it wasn't even known when chametz was \"invented\"). Essentially what is not allowed by the laws of chametz is when one of the five grains has been in water for 18 minutes or longer - this counts as a leavening of the grain.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that many (even most) yeast extracts are made from side-products of the beer making process (this is true, for example, of Marmite from the UK or SA and Vegemite). Beer is made using grain that is soaked and fermented (for much longer than 18 minutes) and as such is chametz, and so is the yeast extract that is derived from it.</p>\n\n<p>It is often difficult to know what the source of the yeast in yeast extract is, which is why most rabbis simply say that it is chametz because it is \"safek\" - that is, there is doubt as to its source, it may well be chametz, so treat it as chametz. If you have a source of yeast extract where you can find out what the source is, and it is not grain-based, you're fine.</p>\n\n\n",

Raphael Saffra cited in Shoshi's <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/14991/37\">answer about the Tablet-K hechsher</a>, that cheese made without real rennet is permissible. While this opinion isn't generally accepted (and indeed that's why, as mentioned in that answer and several other ones, neither is that hechsher), <strong>perhaps</strong> that might give you halachic wiggle room to at least eat other kinds of food made in your family's pots and pans, even if not the cheese dishes themselves. (As you've already mentioned in a comment on the question, this is of course something about which to consult with your rabbi.)</p>\n\n<p>You mention in that comment also about dishes that haven't been used in 24 hours. Provided that there is no visible food residue left on them, then indeed halachah considers that the taste of the food molecules absorbed into the dish is <em>pagum</em> (\"impaired\") and doesn't have the same capability as before to render food treif. This can get pretty complicated, though, and I don't know whether washing the dishes during this time (in hot water, naturally) resets the 24-hour clock; but again, that's something for a rav to decide.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I wish you hatzlachah, and an easy time of it, in your Jewish journey!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>You mentioned dishes being washed together. Hacham Ovadia Yosef  writes in Yabia Omer (Y\"D 10:4) that you may wash meat and milk dishes together in a dishwasher as long as the first rinse contains soap (and not just hot water). Presumably, this would also work for non-kosher dishes because the laws of disqualified food (such as if it's mixed with soap) apply to non-kosher food too, not just milk and meat. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There might be some wiggle room for you regarding <a href=\"http://koltorah.org/ravj/13-13%20Milk%20and%20Meat%20-%20Part%201.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">nosein ta'am bar nosein ta'am</a>. Keep in mind that these are intricate and complicated halachos, and subtle differences in the particulars of a case can have a profound impact on the applicable halacha. As can never be reiterated enough with respect to issur v'heter, CYLOR.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Bowing for oseh shalom\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why do we bow for oseh shalom in shmoneh esre and kaddish? There are two parts to this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What is the relationship between bowing in general and oseh shalom?</li>\n<li>What does each direction in which we bow have to do with the corresponding phrase?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>According to the Beit Yosef (OC 123; citing Rav Hai Gaon), the custom is based on the idea that the tefillos correspond to the tamid offerings. When the kohen would go up to the altar, he would go up on the right side, go around, and descend on the left side. We face left first, then right, because we are orienting ourselves according to the Shechina's orientation, which we face when we pray.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the original custom is not exactly to bow in three directions. The Shulchan Aruch writes: \"...[A]nd after he takes three steps back, while still bowed forward a bit before straightening up, when he says Oseh shalom bimromav he turns his face to his left, and when he says Hu ya'aseh shalom aleynu he turns his face to his right, and afterwards he bows forward like a servant departing from his master.\" (OC 123:1) So the bowing part doesn't have much to do with the directions; we simply bow forward in deference to HaShem as we take leave of our prayers.</p>\n\n<p>The custom to do the same at the end of kaddish is stated in Hilchos B'rachos (ibid. 56:5). The Vilna Gaon comments here that he holds that these are extra bows and are forbidden. However, he endorses the bowing at the end of the Shemoneh Esrei, which is originally described in the gemara (Yoma, 53b).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Bitul BeRov - the classic case in real life\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Halachah there's a tremendously powerful concept of Bitul BeRov (nullification among the majority). It goes like this:\nIf you have three identical pieces of meat, and you know for a fact that one is not Kosher but it's not known which one is the non-Kosher one, you can eat all of them because of Rov: You can eat the first because Rov dictates that one of the two you're leaving on the table is probably the non-Kosher one; you can eat the second because the one still on the table or the one you already ate is probably the non-Kosher one; and you can eat the third one because you probably already ate the non-Kosher one. It's generally accepted that you must eat them one at a time for this to work, but the Rosh (Hulin 7:37) is of the opinion that, in fact, you can eat them all together, because once Bitul takes effect, the Isur (prohibited item) becomes Heter (a permitted item).</p>\n\n<p>How do we apply this today? Is it straight textbook? Are there caveats added today? If it's textbook, which opinion do we follow? Finally, how far do we carry this - does it carry to other areas of Halachah, or do we restrict it to the classic case?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (YD 109:1) rules in accordance with the Rashba who says you may only eat them one after another, but not at the same time. It should be understood, however, that we are only discussing things which do not fall into the category of חתיכה הראויה להתכבד. For specifics see YD 101.</p>\n\n\n",

There's some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_%28name%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">disagreement</a> over <a href=\"https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/q/2752/68\">which meaning</a> is accurate, but the source is from this passage in the Torah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?' And he said: 'Jacob.'  And he said: 'Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.' Genesis 32:28-29 (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0132.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JPS</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since Jacob fathered the twelve men who are the founders of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribes_of_Israel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">12 tribes</a>, his name was often used as shorthand for the entire community.  We see the same phenomena with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moab#Moabite-Israelite_relations\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moab</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edom\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Edom</a>, etc.  Sometimes the nation was called Jacob, but Israel is more common.  There are several variations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Israelite—Usually reserved for the descendants of Jacob in the ancient world.  While it can be applied to anyone from his own sons on, it's most common for it to mean the nation that formed during the Exodus.  When the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites#Transition_into_modern_ethnic_groups\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kingdom divided</a>, the northern portion retained the name until they were defeated by the Assyrians.  After that point, the people living in that region were called Samaritans and there is some dispute over the exact relationship with Israel.  The <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ites#Latin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"-ite\" suffix</a> comes from Greek, which suggests the <a href=\"https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/q/32/68\">Septuagint</a> coined the term.</p></li>\n<li><p>Israeli—The modern designation for citizens of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel#Etymology\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nation of Israel</a>.  Since nationhood is no longer strictly tied to genealogy, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis#Ethnic_and_religious_groups\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Israelis do not all</a> trace their ancestry to Jacob.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Judah</h2>\n\n<p>Judah was one of Jacob's sons and the ancestor of David.  As such, the tribe of Judah acquired significant political and cultural importance.  When the kingdom of Israel split, the southern portion was called Judah even though it included Benjamin and portions of other tribes as well.  Like Israel, there are several variations of this name as well:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Jew—Perhaps because of lessons learned from the destruction of the Northern Kingdom, the people of Judah maintained their communal identity while in exile.  When the Persian empire conquered the Babylonian empire, the decedents of the kings of Judah where allowed to return to what was now called the province of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehud_Medinata\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehud</a>.  When Alexander conquered Persia, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea#Etymology\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">name</a> became Ιουδαία and under the Romans it became Judea.  After a few <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews#Name_and_etymology\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">language jumps</a>, the word arrived in English as Jew.  This is the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/22506/971\">proper term</a> for people who practice the religion described in the Tanakh or have ancestral relationship to Jacob.</p></li>\n<li><p>Judaizer—This is fairly technical term that comes from <a href=\"http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gal&c=2&v=14&t=NASB#conc/14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">one early Christian text</a> which describes the first division of Christianity.  Most of the early figures of the Christianity were Jewish.  Some hoped to spread the religion to all types of people and others hoped to retain Jewish religious practice.  Paul, writing on behalf of the first group, argued that gentiles should not be compelled to adopt Jewish praxis, or \"live as do the Jews\".  The Septuagint used the same verb when translating Esther 8:17:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land <strong>became Jews</strong>; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them.—Esther 8:17 (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3308.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JPS</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Christian commentators turned the Greek verb into a noun: judaizer.  Needless to say, outside of this fairly narrow context, the term is not helpful.  It should be avoided, if not because of the possibility of offense, then because it's unlikely to be recognized.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Hebrew</h2>\n\n<p>Although not mentioned in the question, \"Hebrews\" is a commonly used term for the ancestors of Jacob while they were living in Egypt.  The name <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrews#Etymology\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">may have derived</a> from Abraham's ancestor, Eber.  Other etymologies have been proposed.  The word generally signifies the language of the same name, but at various points in history it has been identified with its speakers.  The term <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrews#Use_as_synonym_for_.22Jews.22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">emphasizes</a> the text, language, and culture of the people rather than their nation or religion.</p>\n\n<h2>Shem</h2>\n\n<p>One of Noah's sons, who is identified by Genesis as an ancestor of Abraham.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_peoples\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Many people</a> groups fall under the banner of Semitic, but because the term <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">antisemitism</a> refers to an attitude of hostility to Jews, the word Semite is sometimes mistakenly used for Jews alone.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>While there is significant overlap between the term Israelite and Jew, these terms are not always interchangeable.  \"Judaizer\" probably should not be used at all outside of specific domains.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>As stated, Israelite is a anglicized version of a word meaning \"of the nation of Israel\" which referred to people in biblical and post-biblical times. Once the kingdom split after the reign of Solomon, that term which would have applied to the Northern Kingdom of Israel, would not apply to the Southern Kingdom of Judah. The name \"Judah\" (transliterated better as \"Yehudah\") is what became \"Yehudi\"= which we got (through the German I would guess) as \"Jew.\" Of the three it is the only one in use now.</p>\n\n<p>A Judaizer is one who gets others to convert to Judaism or, separately, someone who adopts practices to live in a state which conforms to certain Jewish norms without being a Jew. It is not a term used for Jews or generally, by Jews.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The first two can be used interchangeably, although the use \"Israelite\" is slightly antiquated now, and is used mostly to refer to the Children of Israel in biblical times. Nowadays, the only term of those three that are used to refer to Jews is, \"Jew\"</p>\n\n<p>As far as Judaizer, I have come across the term before, but I had to look it up, because it's so uncommon.</p>\n\n<p>The Wikipedia entry on \"Judaizer\" defines several different uses for the term, none of which would be synonymous with \"Jew\".</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud says there was some \"itch\" that idol-worship seemed to \"scratch\" that dissipated then.)</p>\n\n<p>But the \"proper Jewish belief and practice\" was clearly in one God -- just that lots of Jews kept having problems following it, apparently.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is clearly depicted in numerous locations in the bible. To name a few major pagan cults, you have the Golden Calf worship in Exodus, Baal Peor worship in Numbers, and Baal worship in Kings. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You have to make a distinction between believing in the existence of multiple gods (which is clearly accepted in the Tanach - see God on the Egyptian Gods) and worshiping them. Only when the Jewish people turned to idolatry did they actually worship other Gods, but they were certainly 'aware' of their 'existence', and believed them to exist. This is why <em>Aseret Ha'dibrot</em> says \"You shall have no other gods…\" - that is, you will worship no other gods, and not \"there are no other gods\".</p>\n\n<p>However, I believe it was accepted by the Jews that God was the King/Lord/Greatest among all the deities. I'm reminded of Ramban's (I think) commentary where he instructs on how to call on the deities that are in charge of celestial bodies to curse people. Source is commentary on <em>D'varim</em> 18:10-11</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>See this wikipedia article on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolatry\" rel=\"nofollow\">monolatry</a> for a more complete explanation. </p>\n\n\n",

This form is usually used at the end of a phrase, although the regular form may also be used at the end of a phrase.  For example, in the Song of the Sea <em>natitha yeminekha tibla`emo ares</em>, the word \"land\" appears as <em>ares</em> instead of <em>eres</em>.  Similarly, in Ps 43:3 we read <em>el har <strong>qodsheKHA</em></strong> [-shin-shewa-khaf-qames] <em>we'el mishkenothekha</em>, but in Ps 15:1, we read <em>mi yishkon behar <strong>qodSHEkha</em></strong> [-shin-seghol-khaf-qames].  </p>\n\n<p>These forms usually appear with major disjunctive accents (silluq, athnah), but sometimes with minor disjunctives (such as zarqa, rebhia`).  The word \"you\" (masc sing) is one of the few that have two pausal forms, a minor one aleph-pathah-taw-qames-he' and a major one aleph-qames-taw-qames-he', both with penultimate stress (i.e., stress on next-to-last syllable).  The regular form (aleph-pathah-taw-qames-he' with stress on the last syllable) occurs 455 times in Tanakh (221 with disjunctive accents, 225 with conjunctive), the minor pausal 27 times, and the major pausal 52 times.  </p>\n\n<p>In the prayerbook, when it is not a quotation from Tanakh, the use of pausal form is usually a result of a movement in the late eighteenth - early nineteenth century c.e. to apply the rules of Biblical Hebrew grammar to the Rabbinic Hebrew of the siddur.  </p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar/29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gesenius 29</a>i-v; Weingreeen (<em>A Practical Grammar for Classical Hebrew</em>) p. 137; Jacobson (<em>Chanting the Hebrew Bible</em>) pp. 340ff.</p>\n\n\n",

Adir Hu is about praising God, which we've been doing all night; Eliyahu HaNavi makes sense because Eliyahu is part of the seder; Bashana Haba'ah fits with our desire to be in Eretz Yisrael next year.  And then there are the two progressive songs, one about a goat and one that counts up various important things, none of them about Pesach in particular.  Why were these songs chosen for the seder?</p>\n\n<p>I am aware of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/857/why-do-we-sing-echad-mi-yodeya\">this similar question about Echad Mi Yodea</a>.

We may never recognize them as one or the other, but they are continual in our lives...yet at the end it is only by supernatural means (G-d's love for us) that we will be blessed with a full and final redemption.</li></ol> \nChag Sameach</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>Chad Gadya</strong>  - Why do we sing it as the Seder?</p>\n\n<p>One Jewish author from the 1800's, Yitzchak Baer Levinsohn, and subsequently the Encyclopedia Judaica, write the purpose of the song is \"for the amusement of the children so that they might not fall asleep before the end of the seder.\"</p>\n\n<p>Many rabbis take issue with this trivialization, on the basis that if it became part of the holy seder service, there must be a good reason.  In addition, if the purpose is to keep the children awake, it should be sung earlier, not at the very end.</p>\n\n<p>(In my humble opinion, it's <em>not</em> meant to be sung at the end.  It's meant to be sung whenever the children stop paying attention.  We only sing it at the end because it was originally printed at the end as an <em>addendum.</em>)</p>\n\n<p>The Jewish Encyclopeida (1906) writes that song seems to be an embodiment of the idea of justice, of reward and punishment, and relative order among all the objects in Creation.  </p>\n\n<p>Encyclopedia Judaica writes that the traditional interpretation is one \"in which the kid symbolizes the oppressed Jewish people. It was bought by the father (God) for two coins (Moses and Aaron). The devouring cat stands for Assyria; the dog is Babylon; the stick represents Persia; the fire Macedonia; the water is Rome; the ox, the Saracens; the shoḥet, the Crusaders; and the Angel of Death, the Turks who in those days ruled Palestine. The end of the song expresses the hope for messianic redemption: God destroys the foreign rulers of the Holy Land and vindicates Israel, \"the only kid.\"  </p>\n\n<p>It also mentions that  \"other commentators have tried to interpret \"Ḥad Gadya\" as an allegorization of the Joseph legend or of the relationship between body and soul as reflected in Jewish mysticism,\" but does not expand on this.  Thankfully, <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/723407/Rabbi__Kenneth__Brander/An_Analysis_Of_Had_Gadya\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Kenneth Brander</a> does explain.</p>\n\n<p>The body and soul explanation was given by  Rav Yaakov Emden (1700's, Germany).  He writes that The soul is compared to a small goat. The soul is the dimension of the body that our father (God) in heaven has given us.  He continues to explain that the various animals and actions are things that affect the soul.  For example, the Shochet represents the destructive force that is created whn one sins.  Etc.  A similar interpretation is given by Rabbi Chaim Yosef David Azulai (the Chida, 1700's).</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yonatan Eybeschuetz (1700's, Poland), give an explanation based on the historical saga of the Jewish people.  It's similar to the one listed by the Encyclopeida Judaica, with some reinterpretations, such as the Stick being Moshe's staff, and the Water being Torah.  The Vilna Gaon has a similar interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>A third approach is presented by R . Moses Sofer (Hatam Sofer, 1800's Germany), which R' Brander classifies as “A Review of the Passover sacrificial laws in preparation for the Messianic Age.\"  The goat is the Korban Pesach, and each stanza is a different halacha.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, to quote R' Avi Weiss: \"One wonders, why is this deep message written in metaphor. It may be to teach that so much in Jewish history cannot be understood as it occurs, it can only be deciphered in hindsight. And it may be that the Chad Gadya is written playfully and humorously to teach that to survive against the odds requires the ability to laugh. Our very existence is difficult to believe, and in that sense almost funny.\"</p>\n\n<p>(Please see R' Brander's <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/723407/Rabbi__Kenneth__Brander/An_Analysis_Of_Had_Gadya\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> for more information.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Echad Mi Yodea</strong> - From what I've read, the purpose is to entertain the children.

According to this, the two stories are really contiguous, and reversing their order doesn't really make so much sense (l'chorah).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>(I an adding this answer here, which was already posted <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/36589/what-are-the-relevance-of-the-first-three-posukim-of-the-haftorah-for-parshas-ta\">elsewhere</a>, at the request of the OP.)</p>\n<p>R. Elishevitz (a very great Talmid Chacham from Russia who later moved to Israel about 80 years ago) in his sefer אלף המגן explains how the Haftorah for parshas Tazria completely corresponds to the Torah reading:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Haftorah for parshas Tazria - <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/659332/jewish/Haftorah-in-a-Nutshell.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kings Ⅱ 4:42-5:19</a> - talks about how Na’aman, who was supra-naturally afflicted with a skin blemish, went to Elisha the prophet and was cured, and this corresponds to parshas Tazria which discusses similar afflictions of the body and clothing.</p>\n<p>But the Haftorah starts three verses earlier with the story of how a gift of food was sent to to Elisha and how he was miraculously able to feed his many students from this small amount of food. What relevance does this have to the parsha?</p>\n<p>It would not have been so remarkable if these three verses were at the beginning of the section which talks about Na’aman, but when we look in the Tanach we see that these three verses are in a separate paragraph, so why was there any need to include them in the Haftorah?</p>\n<p>A similar question can be asked on the parsha itself which starts with the laws of a woman who gives birth. What relevance does this have to the main subject of the parsha?</p>\n<p>We can answer these questions with a parable about a soldier who returned home during his month’s furlough from the army, and who went around town boasting about the certificate that he carried with him testifying to his bravery, because once several of the enemy attacked and tried to take away his company’s standard (guidon/pennant), and had they succeeded it would have been a great source of shame to the company. But he managed to fight them all off and defend the standard, and hence his certificate of bravery.</p>\n<p>After a few days another soldier arrived on furlough, and he too boasted about the certificate that he carried with him testifying to his bravery, because he once went over to where the enemy were and successfully stole their standard after attacking several of the enemy, causing them great shame. Clearly the feat of the first soldier paled into insignificance compared to the feat of the second soldier!</p>\n<p>These two soldiers are the parsha and the Haftorah. The job of the woman is to raise her children to serve Hashem so that the afflictions mentioned in the rest of the parsha never come upon them. This is like the first soldier, who was able to defend but not attack.</p>\n<p>But the beginning of the Haftorah shows the greatness of the prophet who taught Torah to Yisrael and who taught and sustained many students. Not only is one such as him able to defend against afflictions, but he is even able to cure them as the rest of the Haftorah relates. This is like the second soldier.</p>\n<p>Thus there is a clear correspondence between the Torah and the Haftorah in their entirety, and the relevance of the first verses is now clear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Shema in Musaf Kedushah - Source and reason\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I grew up on the Birnbaum siddur, I admit it. I read the little explanations at the bottom of the page over and over. Later, I bought a set of Artscroll machzorim and used those on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. I never tried to compare notes, but this morning, something struck me.</p>\n\n<p>In musaf on Shabbos, we say a kedusha which is different from that of Shacharis. The Birnbaum says that the insertion of the shema is the result of a 5th century practice by government forces intent on eliminating the statement of hashem's unity of putting \"spies\" in the shul to ensure than no one said Shema. At the end of davening, when the spies were gone, the Shema was said by being placed in the kedusha. This means that it was a decision made by religious authority to innovate a new text. (that's a recap and extrapolation from the write up on page 394 of the Siddur Hashalem.) While I haven't researched this, I'm assuming that the Birnbaum people didn't make this up from no where.</p>\n\n<p>We say this same form of the kedushah on Yom Kippur in shacharis. The Artscroll machzor explains (page 406-7) that the kedushah in this form reflects a higher level of holiness which we attain usually only at musaf but which we are at in shacharis on Y\"K. It also says that the text comes from Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer (chapter 4, at the end, page 8, here <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/pirkeyeliezer/pirkeyeliezer02.pdf\">http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/pirkeyeliezer/pirkeyeliezer02.pdf</a>). Though it doesn't give a start date for this practice, the text was written (according to wikipedia) any time from the first to 8th century CE. The inclusion of Shema was then NOT related to spies, but to a totally separate claim to holiness.</p>\n\n<p>The easiest reconciliation of these 2 versions is simply to say that one is wrong so if anyone has a good piece of scholarship which clarifies, then pass it along. Otherwise, I am wondering why there are two diametrically opposed explanations for a text's source.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The source for Birnbaum's account is Shibbolei Haleket, citing a Geonic teshuvah (and quoted from there in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38277&st=&pgnum=44\">Otzar Hageonim to Megillah 23b</a>). The king is named there as יוזגרד - i.e., Yezdegerd (II) of Persia (ruled 438-457), although there's no mention of spies being there for part of davening and then leaving - on the contrary, the Gaon writes that the original enactment was to add Shema to kedushah of every tefillah, both on Shabbos and on weekdays. Only after Yezdegerd was (miraculously) killed and the decree abolished was it limited to Musaf and Ne'ilah, so that the miracle not be altogether forgotten.</p>\n\n<p>(Otzar Hageonim also quotes an account by Pirkoi ben Bavoi, a disciple of R. Yehudai Gaon (mid-8th century), who says that the decree in question was in Eretz Yisrael under Roman or Byzantine rule, rather than in Babylonia; he argues that indeed the recitation of Shema in kedushah should be abolished altogether, now that the Byzantine domination over Eretz Yisrael has ceased.)</p>\n\n<p>That it is said in all tefillos of Yom Kippur is indeed a widespread Ashkenazic custom, but I don't know a source for Artscroll's notion that it is because of our higher level of holiness on that day. Magen Avraham (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40432&st=&pgnum=257&hilite=\">Orach Chaim 582:8</a>) cites Hagahos Minhagim that it is related to the fact that Hashem sits in judgment over us throughout Yom Kippur, making it appropriate to say ממקומו הוא יפן - which leads into Shema - in each prayer that day.</p>\n\n\n",

There are those that name at the first possible opportunity and some that wait till the second Shabbos. Many others name sometime in between these extremes. My father's Minhag was to name a girl not earlier than 3 days after she was born. What are the reasons and sources behind the various differing Minhagim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Rav Menashe Klein (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1878&pgnum=313\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Halachot 6:254</a>) quotes the Lubavitcher Rebbe [I assume the most recent one] that naming a child is when the Kedushat Yisrael (lit: the Holiness of [the People of] Israel) descends upon the child. He uses this to explain the custom of those who name the daughter as soon as possible. (Note that <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1598&pgnum=518\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minchat Yitzchak 4:107</a> makes the same suggestion quoting the Darchei Teshuva who supports the idea from <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0102.htm#19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 2:19</a>.) Tzitz Eliezer (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14513&st=&pgnum=57\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">14:21</a>) proves that naming a daughter must is so important that it must be done immediately from a ruling of Derisha (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14272&st=&pgnum=604\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 360:2</a>) that when faced with a wedding and a daughter-naming, one should first name the daughter.</p>\n<p>Minchat Yitzchak suggests that those who wait until Shabbat do so because during the week one is busy and cannot relax and celebrate sufficiently. He also speculates that perhaps Shabbat is chosen because it is an appropriate time for the mitzva of Peru Urvu as evidenced by the onah of talmidei chachamim (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=62b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ketubot 62b</a>). Finally, Rav Klein suggests that Shabbat is chosen because absent the ceremony surrounding a Brit Milah, we choose a very public event such as Shabbat (cf. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=19&daf=59b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 59b</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

We do not do so at mincha because in the afternoon people have already eaten and the kohanim may have drunk some alcohol which would invalidate them from performing their duty.</p>\n\n<p>Musaf is usually prayed in the morning after Shacharit; however, one is permitted to pray Musaf lechatchila until the end of the seventh hour, and bedieved all day.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, do the kohanim perform Birkat Kohanim at Musaf if it is being prayed after noon? What if it is being prayed after Mincha?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if the answer to the above is No, does that affect saying Sim Shalom vs Shalom Rav in the individual's Shmoneh Esrei? Generally speaking, we (Nusach Ashkenaz) only say Sim Shalom at a prayer where Birkat Kohanim could be said.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It seems from the language of the Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">129:1</a> that the omission is dependent on the mincha service, not the time.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to shacharis, musaf and neilah, the SA allows bircas kohanim at mincha on a fast day based on 2 factors.  Firstly, the custom [was] to daven late on fast days and so the mincha service takes on a similarity to a neila service.  Secondly, it will not be confused with mincha of other days since there is no drinking. (See seif 2 to understand how the SA implies a second factor and the reasoning behind it.)</p>\n\n<p>If the time of day is what allows or disallows bircas kohanim, the SA should have said the following:  Normally at late mincha we do not allow bircas kohanim even though drinking is uncommon, because one will confuse it with other minchas. But no one will confuse a fast day since there is no drinking.  Why does the SA need to compare late mincha to neila?</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, what allows or disallows bircas kohanim is the service, mincha, which is commonly done during drinking hours.  That is why mincha on a fast day needed to be re-categorized as a quasi-neila (but is still mincha enough to cause confusion if it weren't a fast day thereby requiring factor #2).</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, <strong>there would be bircas kohanim in late musaf</strong>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I have been in many Shuls where Musaf was first being said after noon and they still said Birchas Kohanim. Although I have no other source it makes sense to me at least that so long there was no Kiddush break there should be no problem with saying Birchas Kohanim at a late Musaf.</p>\n\n\n",

Here are a few of the major opinions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rabbi Jacob Chagiz, (17th century, Morocco, Italy, Israel) - Say it for a girl. He follows the reasoning that since both sons and daughters are liable for the sins of their father, both would obligate the father to say the bracha upon reaching the age of majority. It may be interesting to note that this is the first source I could find that addressed the issue directly.</li>\n<li>Rabbi Davd Luria (19th century) - Only say it for a boy. His reasoning is that because the source of the bracha is a midrash in Bereshit Rabbah that mentions sons only, it is only said for sons.</li>\n<li>Kaf HaChayim (19-20 century, Baghdad)- Only said for sons because daughters continue to be \"nourished by their father's houses\" until their wedding.</li>\n<li>Chaim David HaLevy (20th century, Israel) - We only say for sons. His reasoning is that the bracha is because the father is required to teach his son torah. Since there isn't as much of an obligation to teach Torah to daughters, we don't say a blessing for them.</li>\n<li>Yitzchak Nissim (20th century, Sephardi chief rabbi of Israel) - He says to say it for a daughter, and even provides a new nusach for the bracha with female pronouns (ברוך שפטרני מעונשה של זאת). His reasoning is that it's because a daughter also requires education and is punished for her father's sins.</li>\n<li>Ovadia Yosef (20th century, Chief Sephardi Rabbi of Israel) - Say it for a daughter. He also provides a new nusach using feminine pronouns. He analyzes the issue from two perspectives, one that we bless because the child is punished for the sins of the father, and one that the father is punished for the actions of the child. Either way, he believes it applies to a daughter as well.</li>\n<li>Yona Metzger (20-21 century, Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi of Israel) - Only say it for sons. His reasoning is that sons require education but daughters don't.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

They are:</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hai Gaon (quoted in Tur OC 235 and Rosh Brachot 1:1 and more): Daven the Shmone Esrei and say keriat shema with its brachot at night (ie skip semichat geulah letefillah).</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Tam (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=2&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brachot 2a</a>): The proper time for keriat shema <em>is</em> after plag, so that's why one can say its brachot then.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Yonah (Brachot 1a in Rif): Like Rav Hai Gaon, except that after sunset and before nightfall, he thinks that is considered night enough that the brachot are not lies.</p>\n\n<p>Possibly Rashi (Brachot 2a): The brachot are part of the tefillah and can be said at any time the tefillah can. (I say <em>possibly</em> because Rashi doesn't say this, but he doesn't explain any other way explicitly and this opinion is how I always heard it understood. If I find someone who says this explicitly I will edit it in. IIRC Rav Soloveitchik is cited in Nefesh HaRav as holding of this kind of opinion from sunset onward, not plag.)</p>\n\n<p>Gra (Maaseh Rav 65): Never ever say any part of maariv before nightfall no matter what.</p>\n\n<p>So..</p>\n\n<p>Leaving aside the Gra because no one before or after him (that I can find) ruled like him...</p>\n\n<p>And leaving aside Rav Hai Gaon because it doesn't meet your criteria despite its being the earliest discussion on the matter, its being cited approvingly by the Tur and Beit Yosef, its being reported by the Chofetz Chaim's (as quoted <a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2008/08/turbulent-maariv.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) son that this was the Chofetz Chaim's personal practice, and its basically being the final psak of Rav Moshe Feinstein (Igrot Moshe OC 2:60) and Rav Hershel Shachter (as quoted <a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2008/08/turbulent-maariv.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>)...</p>\n\n<p>We are left with three options:</p>\n\n<p>For Rabbeinu Yonah, if you want to extend his definition of sunset back to plag, you would still be hard pressed to be able to say the brachot before plag as that would certainly be lying.</p>\n\n<p>For Possible Rashi, it would seem that you wouldn't be able to say the brachot before plag as then it isn't the time for tefillah.</p>\n\n<p>For Rabbeinu Tam, there is a possiblitly that one could say the first two brachot before plag so long as keriat shema is said after plag, which according to him (and against an explicit mishna Brachot 1:1) is its appropriate time, because then the brachot are still appropriately attached to the mitzva. However, the 'lying' issue may still bug him. We don't know for sure.</p>\n\n<p>Note that all of the above is true even for someone who <em>did</em> daven mincha before plag!</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is not only an issue of tartei d'sosrei here; saying birchos kriyas shema before plag is not acceptable, and the brachos are not considered to be drawn after the later time period in which the ma'ariv shemoneh esrei was recited. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding reciting mincha and ma'ariv in the same post-plag time slot: R' Moshe Feinstein holds that the leniency allowing some congregations to apparently violate tartei d'sosrei, even if dubiously applied on a personal basis, definitely does not allow an individual to recite the birchos kriyas shema (which don't have a din of tefillah b'tzibur). This would mean that an individual in the responsum's case should at most recite only the shemoneh esrei with the congregation, even though he will miss juxtaposing geulah to tefillah. (Igros Moshe, OC, Chelek 2, 60)</p>\n\n<p>All the more so should an individual in the case described in the above question avoid reciting birchos kriyas shema with the congregation (which is itself acting improperly). As far as reciting only the shemoneh esrei with the congregation in this case, there might possibly be a basis for doing so if you can't pray with a minyan later in the evening.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, this hypothetical problem can be avoided if this hypothetical minyan wouldn't rush through their prayers or ignore the clock.</p>\n\n\n",

His proof was twofold:\n1. G-d could not have commanded us to \"love\" Him. Love is an emotion and cannot be controlled in that way.\n2. A person can deeply love his or her spouse but be unfaithful.</p>\n\n<p>He insisted, rather, that the word means faithfulness. When we are commanded \"VeAhavta Eth HaShem Elokeicha\", the commandment is not one of how we are obligated to feel, but one of how we are obligated to act - we are obligated to be faithful.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any source for this idea? If so, why do we always translate \"Ahavah\" as \"love\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>The Torah commands us regarding emotions all the time, e.g.: \"Don't bear a grudge\", \"don't hate your fellow in your heart\", \"don't harbor resentment when you give [charity] to him\", \"because you didn't serve Hashem your Lord with happiness and a glad heart\", \"don't despise the Edomite, for he is your brother; don't despise the Egyptian, for you were a sojourner in his land\", etc., etc., etc.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, \"ahava\" clearly means love all over the place, e.g. סַמְּכוּנִי בָּאֲשִׁישׁוֹת רַפְּדוּנִי בַּתַּפּוּחִים כִּי חוֹלַת אַהֲבָה אָנִי. \"...for I am lovesick.\" (Shir HaShirim, 2:5) Skimming through Shir HaShirim yields many more examples.</p>\n\n<p>In the comments above, @Hahu Gavra cited the Rambam in Hil. Yesodei HaTorah. Here is a quote from the Rambam elsewhere (Hil. Teshuva, 10:3):</p>\n\n<p>וכיצד היא האהבה הראויה הוא שיאהב את ה' אהבה גדולה יתירה עזה מאוד עד שתהא נפשו קשורה באהבת ה' ונמצא שוגה בה תמיד כאלו חולה חולי האהבה שאין דעתו פנויה מאהבת אותה אשה והוא שוגה בה תמיד בין בשבתו בין בקומו בין בשעה שהוא אוכל ושותה, יתר מזה תהיה אהבת ה' בלב אוהביו שוגים בה תמיד כמו שצונו בכל לבבך ובכל נפשך, והוא ששלמה אמר דרך משל כי חולת אהבה אני, וכל שיר השירים משל הוא לענין זה.</p>\n\n<p>\"The appropriate love is to love Hashem with an exceptionally great and powerful love to the extent that one's soul is bound up with the love of Hashem so that he dwells on it constantly as if he is sick with lovesickness for that woman that he constantly thinks about whether he is sitting or standing or eating or drinking. Greater than this must be the love for Hashem...\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Love is an emotion and cannot be controlled in that way</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is generally wrong according to R.Desler.\nAt <a href=\"http://www.ima-adama.co.il/religions/kabbala/judaism_hrikeren9_giving_love.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a> site I found the citation from his book</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הרב דסלר זצ\"ל בספרו \"מכתב מאליהו\" (קונטרס החסד), ניסח כך נושא זה: \"יותר ממה שהנתינה באה בעקבות האהבה, האהבה באה בעקבות הנתינה\".</p>\n<p>\"Love is caused by Giving more than Love causes Giving\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, if you give to somebody you starts to love him.\nI think this is a basic thing that each chatan is told before the wedding.</p>\n<p>And according to</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A person can deeply love his or her spouse but be unfaithful</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From where did he took that?!?!? If he thinks this is true, then indeed his understanding about love is very mistaken.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>in chabad chassidus the first question is a foundation and commonly brought up and answered all over the place there are hundreds of pages on it alone and in a nutshell heres the main point</p>\n\n<p>the command is to try your best at loving hashem by thinking about certain things that will inspire love ( one of the most common is consider his greatness and the fact that nevertheless he helps you in your situations  - again there are tens of contemplations and hundreds of pages)\nand it is says that g-d will help you along with this (\"haboh letaher mesaiyin loi\")</p>\n\n<p>to the second question: the command to love doesnt have to mean to be faithful as the command to pray doesnt mean follow mitzvot etc. it has no bearing whatsoever on the meaning of \"ahava\"</p>\n\n<p>and as toras emes stated if you look through shir hashirim its very in-your-face that ahava = love</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why no procedure with birds, etc., for clothing tzaraas?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9915\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Lev. 14</a>:1-7) prescribes that when a person is healed of a tzaraas lesion, a kohen is to perform, as the first step in his purification, a procedure involving two birds and several other items. The same thing is also done when tzaraas on a house goes away (ibid. 14:48-53).</p>\n\n<p>Why is this procedure not called for when an article of clothing becomes free of tzaraas?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><em>Ralbag</em> (on <em>M'tzora</em> 14:49) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנה מפני שנטמא הבית כל ימי ההסגר והיה בלתי ראוי שתסור טומאתו בזולת פועל כלל הנה תהיה טהרתו בצפורים לפי שאי אפשר בו הטבילה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, a house, like a garment, should by rights just go in the <em>mikve</em>, but it can't, so we do the sprinkling-of-blood ritual instead.</p>\n\n<p>(This leaves open the question why <em>tzaraas</em> on a person requires both a <em>mikve</em> and the sprinkling of blood. From what he says in <em>Sh'mini</em> about <em>tzaraas</em> on a person—</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה יטבול אחר התגלחת הראשונה והשנית להעיר כי זאת הטומאה חזקה מאד ולזה לא יתכן שתסור יחד בפעם אחת אבל תסו׳ קצתה בטבילה הראשונה וקצתה בטבילה השניה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>—it sounds as though he <em>may</em> hold that it simply is so severe that it requires both rituals — but I don't see that he says so, or that he otherwise explains why <em>tzaraas</em> on a person needs both. (I may well have missed it, though. He writes rather at length there in <em>Sh'mini</em>.))</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramban on Tazria-Metzora (I don't have it in front of me at this time. When I find it I'll post it) says that the order of severity in tzaraas (from light to severe) is clothing, houses and then people. He further says that the more severe the tzaraas is the more needs to be done to become pure. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, to purify tzaraas on clothing, one needs to just putt it in a mikveh, as this type of tzaraas is the most lenirnt. Next is the house, which is more severe and therefore needs the birds (which is similar to an offering). The most severe tzaraas is the tzaraas of people, which requires all of the above (for purification) in addition to real korbanos, as this is the most severe of all tzaraas.</p>\n\n<p>Just to clarify, the above is an answer based on the Ramban, but is not necessarily what the Ramban is saying.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Should I say \"amen\" to a malformed bracha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If I hear somebody substantially mispronounce a bracha, should I say amen anyway (recognizing the intent) or remain silent?  I'm not talking about nuances like pronouncing 'ayin or distinguishing tzere from segol; I mean errors like reading a reish as a dalet (like a vision-challenged person might do) or transposing letters (like a dyslexic might do).  I can not necessarily tell whether the resulting words are nonsense or different words, and, if the latter, what they mean.</p>\n\n<p>If I should not respond, does that change if my non-response will be obvious (e.g. I'm the only other person there and I clearly heard)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch writes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=251\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 215:2</a>) that one should not respond amen to a bracha recited by an adult Jew if שינה ממטבע הברכות he changed the way the bracha was coined. The Mishna Berura there notes that this is due to the fact that if he changed it too much that he would not fulfill his obligation, it is then a bracha levatala to which one is forbidden to recite amen (per <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=252\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 215:4</a>).</p>\n\n<p>How much of a change is considered שינוי מטבע? The Rambam (Brachot 1:5) defines the minimum as a mention of \"God's name, His Kingship, and the notion of the bracha.\" For instance, the Shulchan Aruch rules (OC 167:10) that if instead of HaMotzi, one said \"Blesses is God the King who gave me this bread\" he has post facto fulfilled his obligation, even though he changed the text of the bracha (and I mean content-wise, not because of the translation). So as long as they pronounce enough words correctly that they still have imparted the proper \"notion,\" they have fulfilled their obligation and you may recite amen. (I recognize that this is a little vague, but there is no way the texts can cover every possibility. One has to be aware of the meanings and potential differences in similar sounding words, just like the one correcting a ba'al keriyah.)</p>\n\n<p>As for how clearly you need to say a word for it to be considered the word you wanted, see my answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/15488/759\">here</a> where I discuss the matter and conclude that you have to actually say the correct phonemes, and the only wiggle room is with \"minor\" differences like shva na' and separating similar consonants (like in the phrase \"black coat\").</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you are alone and your silence would be noticeable, I can personally recommend using the old \"amem\" trick to avoid any bad feelings.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Clothing and shame, etymologically speaking\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have been unable to find an etymological connection between the root for shame בשש (especially as it turns into the forms of בושה בושת) and the word for \"clothe\" לבש. Shame was introduced in Breishit as a result of Adam and Chava's realizing they were unclothed and clothing, soon after, as follows:</p>\n\n<p>2:25</p>\n\n<p>כה וַיִּהְיוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם עֲרוּמִּים, הָאָדָם וְאִשְׁתּוֹ; וְלֹא, יִתְבֹּשָׁשׁוּ.</p>\n\n<p>and 3:21</p>\n\n<p>כא וַיַּעַשׂ ... לְאָדָם וּלְאִשְׁתּוֹ, כָּתְנוֹת עוֹר--וַיַּלְבִּשֵׁם. </p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that the verb would be an explanation for how one resolves that shame, by covering it; clothing (like a תלבושת?) would, at the source be \"that which covers shame\". Onkelos has totally different words for each (shame being from the k-l-m root and clothing from the same l-b-sh root).</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone seen a source which explores this connection?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14387&st=&pgnum=100\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a> (Bereshis 3) makes the connection between the word for \"embarrassment\" (בושה) and the word for \"clothing\" (לבוש). Seemingly, like you said, because the clothing is a covering-up of the embarrassment, and also because clothing (or especially lack thereof) has the strong potential to embarrass a person. He writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שיש שתי תכליות בלבוש. האחד להגין על הגוף מהפעלות החום והקור החזק. והב' מפני הכבוד כי חרפה היא לנו ללכת האדם ערום ויחף ומגולה ערותו עד שמפני זה אחשוב <strong>שנקרא לבוש מלשון בושה</strong> לפי שכמה פעמים יתבייש האדם במלבושו אם להיותו ארוך או קצר יותר מדאי או לצורתו או לגוונו או לפחיתותו</p>\n<p><em>There are two purposes to clothing. The first is to protect the body from the elements, e.g. extreme heat and cold. The second is for dignity, for it is woeful for a person to go about naked and revealed; so much so that I think</em> <em><strong>it is called \"l'vush\" as in \"bushah\"</strong></em> <em>because of this, since often a person will be embarrassed by his clothing, whether it be too long or too short or because of its style or color or inferiority.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rashi has a <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16452.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">theory of 2-word roots</a> (eg. <a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/klarberg/archives/reeh62.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>), but in general it is assumed that there is no such thing. Despite the fact that there are many rules (and many exceptions to those rules), Hebrew is a pretty basic language in terms of sort of piecing together words almost like interchangeable construction toy sets. You take one of these, put it with one of those, and before you know it you've got a helicopter. It's one of the things that I find most fascinating with Hebrew. But at the same time, you get a lot of pieces that almost fit and you think they should, but they just don't.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Connection between the metzora's purification and the Four Species of Sukkos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the procedure prescribed for the first stage of a metzora's purification (Lev. 14:1-7), the Torah lists four items to be dipped into a mixture of blood and water: a live bird, a piece of cedar wood, a strip of crimson wool and a sprig of hyssop.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9915/showrashi/true#v6\">to 14:6</a>, citing Sifra) points out that while all four items are dipped, only three of them are attached together: the crimson wool is used to tie the wood and the hyssop, while the bird is just held along with them. And <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%99%D7%93_%D7%90\">Negaim 14:1</a> adds that the tips of the bird's wings and tail are to be touching the bundle.</p>\n\n<p>This sounds reminiscent of what we do when taking the Four Species on Sukkos; there too, three of them are bound together, with the esrog remaining apart but touching them. Does anyone suggest any reason for this commonality?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is pretty tenuous, but there is a version of the Mishnah in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37946&pgnum=339\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avot (3:5)</a> that uses the verse \"‫ואנודתו על ארץ יסדה‬\" to prove that even three people who learn together, the Divine Presence rests on them (instead of using the verse to prove it for 5 people).</p>\n\n<p>This is the Bartenura's version. He says that we see that 3 things together are called an \"Agudah\", like the Agudat Eizov. The Kehati add like Agudat Lulav as well.</p>\n\n<p>Now, \"Agudat Eizov\" does not refer to the Metzorah purification process (but rather to the Parah Adumah and the blood on the doorpost at exodus from Egypt), but <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9915/showrashi/true#v6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi does call it an Agudah</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So if we say that an Agudah is specifically 3, this could explain why both the Lulav and the Metzorah's purification have 3 items bundled together, with the 4th item on the side.</p>\n\n<p>[Even though the Lulav is three species bound together, while the Metzorah's is two species bound by the third - The Halacha is that we bind the 3 kinds with palm leaves, because if the binding was another material, it could be considered as one was talking an extra kind. So we see that the binding is also considered as one of the kinds when \"taking\"]</p>\n\n\n",

According to all major customs, <em>Yom Haatzmaus</em> (Israel's independence day) falls during the mourning days (as it's the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/7121\">third, fourth, fifth, or sixth</a> of <em>Iyar</em>; see e.g. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14169&pgnum=197\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>MB</em> 493:14–15</a>). Yet some orthodox synagogues and schools have programs on <em>Yom Haatzmaus</em> in which people are encouraged to dance.</p>\n\n<p>Now, a <em>sandek</em> is allowed to shave in honor of the <em>b'ris mila</em> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14169&pgnum=197\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>MB</em> 493:12</a>), but AFAICT dancing is still forbidden to him.</p>\n\n<p>So my first question is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are the mourning restrictions dropped completely by those who allow dancing on <em>Yom Haatzmaus</em>, much as they are on, e.g., <em>lag baomer</em>, or is it only dancing that's permitted (in honor of the day, much as shaving is permitted for a <em>sandek</em> in honor of the <em>b'ris mila</em>)?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, the custom is to observe mourning restrictions thirty-three days; <em>which</em> thirty-three days varies by custom. See e.g. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14169&pgnum=197\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>MB</em> 493:14–15</a>. The examples he gives, though, count <em>lag baomer</em> as one of the thirty-three days even if mourning restrictions are not kept during its daylight hours, because mourning restrictions <em>are</em> kept during its evening (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14169&pgnum=197\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>MB</em> 493:10</a>, but see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14169&pgnum=197\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">:11</a>). So <strong>if</strong> the answer to my first question is that all mourning restrictions are dropped on <em>Yom Haatzmaus</em>, my next questions are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are all mourning restrictions dropped from <em>Yom Haatzmaus</em> both evening and day?</li>\n<li>Is <em>Yom Haatzmaus</em>, like <em>lag baomer</em>, counted as one of the thirty-three days with restrictions? Or do those who keep no restrictions on <em>Yom Haatzmaus</em> count thirty-three days of restrictions besides it?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Of course, because of the considerations in the paragraph just above, these last two questions are of interest in light of one another.)</p>\n\n<p>A sourced answer (e.g. citing a <em>t'shuva</em> addressing these issues) would be ideal, but an answer telling what people do generally is also of interest.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the Sefer Halachos Yom Ha'Atzmaus V'Yom Yerushalayim page 334-340 the Rishon L'Tziyon HaRav Yitzchak Nissim says that all Minhagim of Aveilus are suspended for the day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/ezrachut/harabanut3-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Per Rav Shmuel Katz from the Rabanut Hareishis L'Yisroel</a> it is permissible.</p>\n\n<p>‏'יום המדינה' ה' אייר שחל בימי הספירה, שלפי דיני ישראל נוהגים בהם אבילות, יהא דינו כיום ל\"ג בעומר, ולפי החלטת הרבנות הראשית יותרו כל השמחות, חגיגות נישואין תספורת וכו'‏</p>\n\n<p>However <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131001185813/https://www.ypt.co.il/show.asp?id=27393\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Ronan Nubirt</a> says that you would be required to hold a different day of Sefira to make up for it. היוצא מכל הנ\"ל, שהנוהג היתר בחגי הגאולה, יום העצמאות ויום ירושלים, לכאורה צריך להשלים אותם ימים, ואולי צריך להשלים אף את ערבי החגים הללו שבהם נהגו להתגלח לכבוד החג</p>\n\n<p><em>This answer is applicable to those that celebrate Yom Ha'Atzmaot and want to know what sources they have that permit it.</em></p>\n\n\n",

He is unclean; he shall dwell isolated; his dwelling shall be outside the camp</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rashi explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>He shall dwell isolated:</strong> [meaning] that other unclean people [not stricken with tzara’ath] shall not abide with him. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>The source for the Judaica Press translation's parenthetical explanation of Rashi \"people [not stricken with tzara’ath]\" (implying that the leper may sit with other lepers) appears to be a Braitah brought in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=67&format=pdf\">Pesachim 67A and Rashi's commentary there</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Talmud (according to Rashi) there explains that when the verse says \"he shall dwell isolated\" it means that other forms of impurity (Zav or one impure by a dead body) do not have to go outside all three camps, while the \"leper\" must.</em></p>\n\n<p>This seems to indicate that \"lepers\" may sit together, outside the camp. We see this in the story in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09b07.htm#3\">Melachim II 7:3</a> as well, where there were 4 lepers sitting together at the gates of the city. </p>\n\n<p>However Rashi on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading.asp?AID=15578&p=3&showrashi=true#v46\">Vayikra 13:46</a> continues.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our Sages said: “Why is he different from other unclean people, that he must remain isolated? Since, with his slander, he caused a separation [i.e., a rift] between man and wife or between man and his fellow, he too, shall be separated [from society].”- [Arachin 16b] [This rationale is based on the premise that a person is stricken with tzara’ath as a result of his talking לְשׁוֹן הָרַע, i.e., speaking derogatorily of others, although he may be telling the truth.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the \"leper\" must be isolated and separated from society due to the rifts he has caused, shouldn't he also be separated from other \"lepers\"? Why is he still allowed to sit with other \"lepers\"? Especially since the rifts Rashi (and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=33&daf=16b&format=pdf\">the Talmud</a>) mention are personal rifts, not societal rifts.

I suspect many commentaries disagree with this conclusion (including the one <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41777&pgnum=84\" rel=\"nofollow\">quoted on the previous page</a>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm sorry if you're not satisfied with this answer, but it's my honest feeling that when you untangle the disparate sources that you've quoted from one another, they're either not contradicting one another or it's not a problem that they do.</p>\n\n<p>For a start, Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading.asp?AID=15578&p=3&showrashi=true#v46\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviticus 13:46</a>) never says that people afflicted with any other type of impurity may not dwell with the leper, but simply other impure people. He doesn't say which, though I would imagine that he is speaking specifically of somebody with an emission and somebody with corpse impurity. The parenthetical section that you included in your translation was composed by whomever is responsible for the translation at chabad.org (The Judaica Press). Read it in the Hebrew alongside and you'll see that it says no such thing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שלא יהיו שאר טמאים יושבים עמו</p>\n  \n  <p>That other impure people should not dwell with him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Secondly, Rashi is quoting two completely different sources, and the fact that there appears to be a contradiction between them is not a problem with those sources but a question on Rashi's methodology in particular. You can see the same apparent \"contradiction\" in Rashi's observations on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14263&pgnum=287\" rel=\"nofollow\">2 Kings 7:3</a>. First he brings a gemara from Sanhedrin that posits that the four lepers are Gehazi and his sons, and then he quotes the passage from Leviticus 13, which emphasizes that the leper dwells \"alone\" (בדד).</p>\n\n<p>So far as those two sources are concerned, the first is a beraita that is brought down in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=67&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pesachim 67a</a> in the name of Rabbi Yochanan. The beraita appears to be based on a passage in Sifra (§13, 157.12), on which the Malbim writes that it is only from those who've had an emission (the <i>zav</i>) and from those with corpse impurity that the <i>metzora'</i> needs to distance himself. His reading of the Sifra (and of the beraita in Pesachim and its parallel in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=29&daf=117&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zevachim 117a)</a> is that people with <i>tzara'at</i> can spend time with other people who also have <i>tzara'at</i>, and even other people with different kinds of impurity - so long as they are not of the two varieties I just mentioned. In that sense, the Malbim is saying something different to Rashi, whose mention of the <i>zav</i> and the <i>tamei met</i> in Pesachim 67a is preceded by כגון (\"<i>for example</i>\" - ie: not exclusively).</p>\n\n<p>The second source, which Rashi presents as the \"reason\" for the <i>metzora'</i> dwelling apart is from a beraita that's brought down in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=33&daf=16b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arakhin 16b</a> in the name of Rabbi Hanina. Are you trying to indicate a 'contradiction' between Rabbi Hanina and Rabbi Yochanan, or are you asking how it is that Rashi could possibly combine the two responses?</p>\n\n<p>If it's the latter, then your question is effectively: \"How do I reconcile Rashi's commentary on Pesachim 67a with his commentary on Leviticus 13:46?\" I think that anybody will tell you that Rashi's gemara commentary is his attempt at explaining the gemara (in this case, trying to understand Rabbi Yochanan's reasoning), and not a reflection of his halakha. That's why there are so many contradictions (as there are in the gemara itself) and why what he writes doesn't always match what's found in his <i>piskei dinim</i>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>@ba, in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/15948/why-is-a-leper-allowed-to-sit-with-other-lepers#comment51878_15948\">his comment on the question</a>,  linked to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47733&st=&pgnum=108\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 47 of \"Gam Ani Odecha\" by Gamliel HaKohen Rabinovitch</a>.

However, someone recently told me that he pronounces the word as if there is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiriq\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chiriq</a> under the aleph. To make sure, I asked him to double-check and he confirmed - it is printed this way in his Siddur.</p>\n\n<p>So: Is there some source for this difference? Is it a printer error?

If the former, then it takes a segol, as with words like אֶנָּחֵם (Isaiah 1:24); if the latter, chirik, like אִקָּרֶה (Num. 23:15) or וְאִנָּעֵר (Judg. 16:20).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To answer yydl's question, as I commented on a previous answer, I believe that the only difference is in the structure of the word and that the two choices have no differences in meaning. As to the answer of which one to say, I have no idea which way is the \"right way\" but there are many things that can be checked to see if there is consistency in the siddurim being used. First, check all the proofs that Alex used according to the same publisher. Second, you can check the verse in Psalms 51:9.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, it seems that there is no ת in the ואטהר because it is an irregular verb. Really it should be ואתטהר like ואתקדש because it is a מתפעל. However, interestingly enough, I found a piece from שבט שמעון on page .טו in the version that I found (פרשת בראשית) in which he writes the word ואתטהר when talking about the groom telling the bride that he will become purified through her. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I wrote this question in to <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Artscroll</a>, and finally got an answer.

    "content": "# Yumatu and the plural in Dev 24\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Devarim 24:16 makes a statement which is central to Jewish theology.  The posuk makes clear that a father will not be put to death for the sins of his son and that a son will not be put to death for the sins of his father – the gemara develops this to say that neither shall be put to death through the testimony of the other.  Then, to expand on the first part, lest one think that people outside of the family can receive punishment on behalf of others, the verse concludes “ish b’chet’o yumatu” a man, in his own sin, will be put to death.  This idea of banning vicarious expiation of sin through the death of another forms a solid challenge to any religious system predicated on the death of another to atone for the sins of a person who remains, effectively, unpunished.</p>\n\n<p>לֹא-יוּמְתוּ אָבוֹת עַל-בָּנִים, וּבָנִים לֹא-יוּמְתוּ עַל-אָבוֹת:  אִישׁ בְּחֶטְאוֹ, יוּמָתוּ.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is a grammatical problem with the posuk – it states in those final three words “ish (a man) b’chet’o (in his sin) yumatu (<em>they</em> will be put to death, or possibly he will be put to death by <em>them</em>)” – the final vav turns the word “yumat” into some form of a plural.  This plural form appears only three other times in tanach. In those, the actions of two parties condemned them both to the death penalty (vayikra 20:13, 16, 27). Here, the verse clearly limits the offender and offense to the singular as an explicit shift from the first part of the posuk with reads “lo yumtu avot” that father*<em>s</em>* shall not be put to death (Onkelos translates both \"yumtu\" and \"yumatu\" as \"y'mootoon\" and T\"Yonatan has both being \"yitkatlun\").  The singular verb (yumat) occurs almost 50 times, both in conjunction with “mot” (as in “mot yumat”) and on its own.

He won't have the emotional attachment to your item, especially if you will have to throw the item away anyways if the koshering doesn't work.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I have not seen any sources address this question directly. What follows is some limited academic analysis that should not be relied upon practically:</p>\n\n<p>The prohibition against <em>kashering</em> items that are likely to get damaged in the process is based on the Gemara in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%9C_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pesachim (30b)</a> that states that certain vessels can only be <em>kashered</em> by filling the inner cavity with hot coals. The catch is that this process is likely to cause the vessel to break. As a result, a person may become overly protective of their vessel and <em>kasher</em> it in an insufficient manner, rationalizing that their <em>kashering</em> was effective. Therefore, the Rabbis imposed a prohibition against <em>kashering</em> these kinds of vessels at all, so people wouldn't end up using non-kosher vessels that they convince themselves were in fact properly <em>kashered</em>.</p>\n\n<p>One determinant of the halacha in the OP's question might be whether the prohibition is an <em>issur gavra</em> (which directly restricts a person's actions) or an <em>issur cheftza</em> (which would prohibit a class of items for all people). It is conceivable that the former is true, as is <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14543&st=&pgnum=51\" rel=\"nofollow\">sometimes the case with Rabbinic prohibitions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the prohibition is probably derived from the concept <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37953&pgnum=681\" rel=\"nofollow\"> אין אדם מעמיד עצמו על ממונו </a> (that many people have serious difficulty allowing/causing substantial property damage to themselves even if halachic prohibitions require them to do so), or, less likely, from <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%96_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow\">אדם בהול על ממונו </a> (that many people frantically ignore halacha when faced with a sudden threat of serious property loss). </p>\n\n<p>If the prohibition is an <em>issur gavra</em>, there may therefore be a basis for saying that someone who does not care about whether the item breaks would not be subject to the prohibition. In fact, certain types of inexpensive pottery (e.g. cheap frying pans) are excluded from the prohibition for the very reason that <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36262&pgnum=104\" rel=\"nofollow\">the owner is not likely to worry about a potential minor loss</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A related Rabbinic prohibition against saving more than a minimal amount of one's food/property from a house-fire on Shabbos may very well be an <em>issur gavra</em> according to those Rishonim (e.g. the Ran) who disagree with the Rambam and allow non-owners to remove an unlimited amount of property from the home (see Beit Yosef, OC 334:9). However, in our case we are dealing with the kosher status of the vessel/utensil rather than protecting against individuals violating Shabbos, so there may be ample reason to assume that this prohibition is an <em>issur cheftza</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There's another variable to consider. Even if the friend knows that he will not legally be held liable for any damage to the item, he might not be entirely comforted by the owner's assurances. The friend might remain overly cautious to avoid breaking the owner's expensive property. Now, there are a couple of different interpretations of the manner in which an item's owner might neglect to <em>kasher</em> an item: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rashi (apparent meaning): The owner might not <em>kasher</em> the inside of the vessel <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=30b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">at all</a>.

The question is how much. Tape or other adhesives may require nothing more than some Goo Gone or the equivalent, while screws may require you to get some wood filler and then repaint.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>1) Slice the mezuzah case off using a long razor blade.</p>\n\n<p>2) Use Goo Gone or similar adhesive remover on the Mezuzah and wall to remove the excess tape.</p>\n\n<p>3) Replace the tape. </p>\n\n<p>Another option is to use a high end adhesive that sticks well but comes off easily.

Mostly it is read in the language of one's preference, but some (myself included) read it in Hebrew and translate the passage into English. I'm wondering what the source is for this round-robin style of reading the Haggadah (if there is a written one), and if it is widely practiced. The other Seder I've been to had the leader of the Seder reading everything all in Hebrew. Is reading by one person generally the norm? Are there other traditions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=544\">DailyHalacha.com</a> says that the reciting of the Hagadah is based on ‘VeHigadata LiBincha BaYom HaHu Lemor.’ The Ritvo and the Gr\"a had only the head of the household read it. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Mansour's custom however, is that all recite the Hagadah together word by word. From time to time they pause the reading, and the Ba’al Habayit or somebody that is fluent in the story, explains it in English or the language that the people around the Seder understand. </p>\n\n<p>He also points out that in order to fulfill the Mitzvah of ‘VeHigadata LiBincha’, the father has to tell the story over to his children.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Well, depends on what you're referring to in Hagadah. The Hagadah has blessings (Kidush, Zmanim, Motzi, Netila, etc..) so those are usually read by the one conducting the Seder. The Hallel, Nishmat Kol Hai and Hallel Ha'Gadol are usually read by that same person as well with the others reading it silently. The rest of the Hagadah is usually read by everyone taking turns on the paragraphs.</p>\n\n<p>My family is orthodox although not ultra-orthodox.

They observed people entering a swamp. Avlait said that a certain man would not emerge from the swamp because a snake would bite and kill him. Shmuel said that he would not die if he was a Jew (\"for astrology does not control the fate of a Jew [ein mazal l'Yisrael], and prayer will help him\" - Rashi).</p>\n\n<p>The man emerged from the swamp alive. Shmuel and Avlait approached him. Avlait found a dead, chopped up snake in the man's pack; the man had inadvertently killed the snake when chopping reeds in the swamp. Shmuel asked him what he did to deserve being saved - turns out the guy pulled a sleight-of-hand trick earlier in the day to save an impoverished coworker from embarrassment when the coworker hadn't been able to afford anything for the workplace potluck lunch. Shmuel concluded that <em>tzedaka</em> (charity) saves one from death.</p>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Whose prayer did Shmuel think would help - the man's or Shmuel's? Was Shmuel specifically praying for the man's safety? (Presumably he was too far away to warn him of the danger initially).</li>\n<li>If prayer was enough to save the man from the astrologically predicted danger, why did Shmuel afterwards attribute the man's safety to his good deed?</li>\n<li>Is the Gemara saying that either prayer <em>or</em> good deeds/charity can save someone from a bad <em>mazal</em>, or are both necessary?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47606&st=&pgnum=431\">Rif (to Ein Yaakov ibid.)</a> discusses this. He says that Shmuel meant to say that either one or the other merit might help this person, if he's a Jew: either at one time he's performed an act of tzedakah (he had no way of knowing, of course, that he'd be in a position to do such an act during the workday); or at least he's prayed at one time or another.</p>\n\n<p>He then goes on to suggest that the tefillah to which Rashi is referring is indeed Shmuel's prayer on behalf of this unknown-to-him Jew. But while that might have been enough to save him from being bitten and killed, the snake might still have stayed alive (and been able to harm him, or someone else, on a different occasion). That the laborer was able to chop the snake in two, Shmuel noted, had to be due to the merit of his very high level of tzedakah (Rif categorizes it as \"giving without knowing whom you're giving to\" - the second highest in Rambam's taxonomy of tzedakah giving - since this person couldn't be certain who actually received the piece of bread that he put into the pot).</p>\n\n\n",

(He also cites Eusebius (4:8 - should be <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.ix.vi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4:6:1</a>) as saying that the same thing happened after the failure of Bar Kochba's revolt, although the English translation there simply says that the Roman governor Rufus - presumably the same as the Turnus Rufus often mentioned as R. Akiva's nemesis - \"reduced their country to a state of complete subjection.\") And he explains an episode recorded in Shabbos 116a-b, concerning Rabban Gamliel and his sister Ima Shalom arguing about their inheritance before a Roman judge, in this light too: since their father Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel had been killed during the war (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/3003/37\">whether by the Romans, the Zealots, or of natural causes</a>), they needed to get the judge's ear so that he would release the estate to them.</p>\n\n<p>[In general, confiscating the property of those condemned to execution was pretty common in the ancient world, and even later. We find Achav doing so (I Kings 21), and also Yehoyakim (Vayikra Rabbah 19:6); and Alexander the Great suggested, as a \"solution\" for a case where two people each claimed that the other one deserved a found treasure, that he'd have executed both of them and kept the treasure himself (ibid. 27:1).]</p>\n\n<p>If, then, we suppose that R. Yehoshua ben Korchah escaped (or hid) after R. Akiva's execution, then indeed Rufus or his minions may have helped themselves to his possessions.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For possibility #5 (in my comment to the question): <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/avot/6-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos d'R. Nassan 6:2</a> says that R. Akiva started out his studied by going \"with his son to sit before a children's teacher\" - which implies that he had already been married (and either divorced or widowed) before marrying Rachel. (The alternative would be to assume that she was willing to wait a good six years after their marriage for him to follow through on his commitment to study Torah.) Toldos Tannaim V'Amoraim speculates, then, that this son was R. Yehoshua ben Korchah. A possible support for this is that <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%92_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yadayim 3:5</a> mentions a \"R. Yochanan ben Yehoshua the son of R. Akiva's father-in-law\" - which, if we take that to mean that Yehoshua was the father-in-law (i.e., that \"son of...\" refers back to R.

If circumstances were such that you'd be willing to, barring the halachic objections, get involved with one of the women there (the presence of other people wouldn't bother you, or there is a bed where you can't be seen or the like) then it would be prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>I am stretching his logic, but the fact that whatever will keep you from sin (whether it fits in the halachic framework or not) permits yichud was mentioned by R' Tzvi Sobolofsky in a lecture at YU.  He gave more pareve examples like being in front of a window, which isn't quite \"petach patuach\" (an open door). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You would encounter Yichud, possibly, as you will be in the presence of only women at times (there is no rule about all the inhabitants of a room marching in and out together). However this is not so simple as this does not apply in a situation where other men could reasonably walk in at any moment. If you ascertain that this is the case, you would not have to worry about Yichud.</p>\n<p>Also, לא תתורו אחרי עיניכם if one or more of the woman is not dressed according to Torah law, this is seemingly inevitable, unless you are in amish country or the like.</p>\n<p>Also, hard to avoid the prohibition of אל תרבה שיחה עם האשה.</p>\n<p>In a male only hostel you have non of these problems.</p>\n<p>My advice: stick to the male only option.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sie.org/templates/sie/article_cdo/aid/2309099/jewish/Chapter-1-Yichud-What-Where-and-With-Whom-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sie.org/templates/sie/article_cdo/aid/2309099/jewish/Chapter-1-Yichud-What-Where-and-With-Whom-1.htm</a></p>\n<p>Even at night, 1 man with (maybe 3 or) 4 women is probably technically mutar. Similarly for 2 men and 2 women. 3 women with 2 men is pretty good. No less than 3 men with (maybe 1 or 2 or) no less than 3 women is the best.</p>\n<p>I don't think sichah im ishah can be called an actual prohibition. See here <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/48156/to-what-extent-can-a-man-talk-to-women\">To what extent can a man talk to women?</a>\nSeeing pritzus is also probably technically mutar if you are not trying to. The main problem here is 'if' it brings you to hirhurim ra'im.</p>\n<p>Yichud with non Jewish men might also be problematic if they are chashud on shichvas zachar. Also, men can be more dangerous than women if you get in a fight. And if it is only men, then there will probably be more nudity than if it is co-ed.</p>\n<p>FYI mixed hostels are generally the cheapest option. And the more beds in the room, the cheaper the beds are.\nAlso, hostels are for short term stays. Also, hostels generally have automatically locking doors. If you try telling your roommates to leave the door unlocked they might report you to the receptionist.</p>\n<p>I once read somewhere, I think towards the end of a Holocaust book, about some men that made aliya and the Zionists only offered them mixed HOUSING. Since they had no other real options they stayed for at least one night.</p>\n\n\n",

However, according to <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Article.aspx?id=183049\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> the Chief Rabbinate in Israel rejects that theory. Also, the Conservative movement considers them to be Kosher, based on a Gemara that supposedly says they are. I am not Conservative, and I don't follow Conservative rulings. However, I mention that ruling because it seems that, according to the above linked article, Jews along the Mediterranean have eaten swordfish for some 350 years, and that the Gemara in question is translated as swordfish, but it may not be what we today call swordfish.</p>\n\n<p>So, with all that background, are there any Gedolim today who hold that it is Kosher, and how do they support their position vis a vis R' Tendler and the problem with the scales?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>Rabbi <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershel_Schachter\">Hershel Schachter</a> quotes Rabbi <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rav\">Joseph B.

He says that it is quite likely that the \"<em>fish with a sword</em>\" discussed in the Knesses HaGedola is really a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sailfish</a>, which also has a small sword.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Because the question asks, \"which sources say yes and which sources say no\", I feel like the question warrants a response that includes a few more sources. The most comprehensive discussion of the issue is published by Dr. Ari Zivotofsky in Bar Ilan's journal <a href=\"http://www.biupress.co.il/website/index.asp?category=52&id=718\">Bechol Derachecha Daeihu (vol. 19)</a> and its history is summarized in <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Judaism/Ask-the-Rabbi-Battlefish\">this news article</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hershel Schachter  (Divrei HaRav p. 192) insists that there are no specific rules about what the scales of the fish should look like in order to be considered kosher scales (as in, scales that are a sign that the fish is kosher), but concedes to the fact that the swordfish has unusual scales in that the scales are attached on both sides. He quotes his teacher, R. Soloveitchik, as allowing the swordfish despite its unusual scales for this reason. </p>\n\n<p>However, R. Tendler points out (<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=5uF66eUhokkC&pg=PA113&lpg=PA113&dq=swordfish%20ramban&source=bl&ots=WuNGH-5JtJ&sig=o7eaFEl6UdilJus_WtzILXLmbWI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I1y5U5RDhYvwAcjpgNgP&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=swordfish%20ramban&f=false\">Pardes Rimonim, p. 106-112</a>) that there <em>are</em> requirements for the nature of the scales: the Ramban on the Torah (Vayikra 11:9) states that the scales must be easily peeled off, and not fully attached, as is the case with the swordfish. R. Tendler insists that this has been the accepted halakha for centuries: the Magid Mishnah in the beginning of Hil. Maachalos Asuros, and the Rama in Shulchan Aruch, Y.D 83:1. To top it all off, R. Tendler states that R. Y.D. Soloveitchik agreed with <em>him</em> (and not as stated in Divrei Harav, above) that the swordfish should not be eaten.</p>\n\n<p>The Kensses Hagedolah also writes (Y.D. 83:74) about a fish with a sword on its nose that it's kosher, though R. Tendler insists that he is referring to a different fish. Several fish of this nature are discussed by the Pischei Teshuvah (Y.D 83:1), where he also adds that if such a fish is kosher, then there's no reason to prohibit this fish on the basis that it looks like non-kosher fish, because it looks like a kosher fish - i.e. it has scales.</p>\n\n<p>As in America, Israeli Rabbis also disagreed on this issue. Rav Unterman, chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv, wrote a teshuvah permitting the swordfish (Shevet Miyhuda vol. 2, 5:118) based on the fact that there was a widespread and ancient custom to eat such fish, while the Tzitz Eliezer (9:40) prohibited it, based on the Ramban and R. Tendler's research.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, R. S.R. Hirsch, in his commentary to Vayikra 11:9 also insists that the Ramban's interpretation has been accepted as the halakha, despite, he adds, the fact that the Noda Biyhuda (Tinyana Y.D 28) seems to argue. (In reality, the Noda Biyhuda agrees on principle but believes that scales that can be separated from the fish by <em>any</em> means are kosher, not just if they can be peeled off easily or from one side.)</p>\n\n\n",

Gil Student</a> (hope that's allowed):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Leviticus.11.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban (Lev. 11:13)</a> states that non-kosher animals are\nphysically unhealthy. Rashbam (Lev. 11:3) agrees and Rambam (Moreh\nNevukhim 3:48) offers this as a secondary reason for these [dietary] commands.</p>\n<p>However, Abarbanel (Lev. 11:13, p. 65) and Akeidas Yitzchak (ch. 60)\nargue against this approach. First, if this were true, the Torah would\nbe merely a book of medicine. Second, we see that gentiles eat\nnon-kosher animals and do not suffer health-wise. And third, why\naren’t poisonous animals mentioned explicitly in the text?</p>\n<p>I [R. Gil Student] don’t\nfind these objections particularly convincing. The Torah requires\nbuilding a ma’akeh (guardrail) around your roof even though that is\nmerely safety related. No one argues that this somehow diminishes the\nTorah’s value. And the argument is not that non-kosher animals are\npoisonous, just that they are less healthy. Perhaps they contribute\nslightly to an earlier death but social differences mask that\ncontribution. Only a controlled study, something with which the\nMedievals were unaware, could truly answer this. And perhaps the Torah\nalready prohibited eating poisonous food in its general admonition to\ntake care of your health. Refraining from poison is obvious.\nRefraining from these animals, which we still do not know whether they\nare truly unhealthy, requires a new prohibition. Not that I find the\napproach particularly convincing but I believe these two arguments can\nbe rebutted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have two things to add to this: one, is that R. Yosef Bechor Shor also adopts this approach in his comments to Shemos 15:26.</p>\n<p>Second, is that I've heard in the name of R. Moshe Shapiro (and I believe that this idea is printed somewhere in the writings of R. Akiva Tatz) that if one adopts this approach, the proper perspective is not to say that the Torah prohibits these animals because they are unhealthy. Rather, the truth of the matter is that the Torah (or some form of it) preceded the creation of the world, and therefore only <em>because the Torah prohibited these animals, their nature is that they are unhealthy</em>. One can, of course, argue which caused which (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">as one might do regarding morality</a>) but I've always found this to be a fascinating idea.</p>\n<p>Regarding the raltionship between kosher and health, <em>besides</em> for the obligation to eat kosher, Jews also have an obligation to take care of themselves, which means eating healthily. Some sources that state this explicitly include the Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1204.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, Hilchot De'ot 4:1</a>), Tur (O.C. 155), and Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0031_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">siman 32</a>)</p>\n\n\n",

Similarly, the obligation to develop one's character is a foundational commandment, and therefore is not included (per R. Chaim Vital).

An example of this is the case of the number of a king's wives (Sanhedrin 21a). </p>\n\n<p>Where a reason is not explicitly stated along with the commandment, Rabbi Shimon would nonetheless expound based on the underlying reasoning of the verse if a reason is implied by the verse. A primary example of this is the case of the widow's garment (Bava Metzia 115a). Since the verse prohibiting taking a widow's garment as collateral follows closely after the verse requiring one to nightly return the garment-collateral of a poor person, Rabbi Shimon infers a connection. </p>\n\n<p>This connection is that returning the widow's garment daily must be forbidden for some reason, namely that going to the widow's home every morning and night will generate rumors and ruin the woman's reputation. Since this would only happen in the case of a poor widow, Rabbi Shimon expounds that the prohibition only applies in such a case.</p>\n\n<p>The given example with Shabbos is not relevant anyway because \"<em>ki sheishes yamim... shavas vayinafash</em>\" does not mean resting from hard work but from constructive work. It therefore could not possibly be used to limit <em>lo s'va'aru eish</em> to situations where it is hard to make a fire/light.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Don't pass bread hand to hand: whose hand?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14164&pgnum=115\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (<em>OC</em> 167:18)</a> says (in my own translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The one who slices the loaf of bread places a slice before each person. The individual then takes the slice with his hand. The one who slices the loaf does not put [the slice] into the hand of the one eating, unless [the latter] were a mourner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Rama</em> there explains that a mourner is customarily passed food (as is implied by a <em>pasuk</em>), and <em>Mishna B'rura</em> there (90) explains that therefore \"it is inappropriate to do so when [the one eating] is not a mourner, lest his fate worsen\".</p>\n\n<p>My question is <em>what</em> precisely is indicative of mourning and therefore not done to non-mourners. Here are some options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Passing directly from the slicer to the eater is indicative of mourning. (However, passing it to a third party, who then passes it down the table to the eater, is fine, even if it goes from hand to hand throughout.) [This is literally what the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> says.]</li>\n<li>Passing directly to the eater is indicative of mourning. (However, the slicer could pass it down the table hand to hand, as long as the last passage, to the eater, is not done from hand to hand.)</li>\n<li>Passing directly from the slicer is indicative of mourning. The slicer should not pass bread into someone's hand. (However, once the bread's on its way down the table, it can be passed hand to hand, even to the eater's hand.)</li>\n<li>Passing bread that will be eaten, from hand to hand, is indicative of mourning. Period. No one should pass bread to anyone.</li>\n<li>Passing bread from the slicer to the eater, even via other people, is indicative of mourning. However, if it at some point en route is set down, that's fine.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(Of these, option 3 seems very unlikely to me, since the sources above make it sound like it depends on the eater.)</p>\n\n<p>As an ancillary but closely related question: <strong>If</strong> option 3 or 4 of my four options above is true, i.e. if bread should not be passed to someone even if he's not the eventual recipient, <strong>then</strong> what happens if it is passed hand to hand? Whose fate can (<em>lo alenu</em>) worsen: the one who received the bread en route, or the eventual recipient? For example, say <em>R'uven</em> slices a slice for <em>Levi</em> and hands it to <em>Shim'on</em>, who places it in front of <em>Levi</em>. <em>Levi</em> then eats it. If my option 3 or 4, above, is correct, <em>R'uven</em> should not have handed the bread to <em>Shim'on</em> because someone's fate could worsen. Whose? (Of course, if my option 1 or 2 (or similar) is correct, then this second question is moot.)</p>\n\n<p>Sourced answers would be ideal.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Based on the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=17907&rid=1040\" rel=\"nofollow\">Divrei Yirmiyahu's commentary on Rambam Hilchot Brachot, Chapter 7, Halacha 5</a>, it appears that the Baal HaBayit (who is cutting the bread), is supposed to place a piece of bread in front of everyone sitting at the table.</p>\n\n<p>He says that by doing so, the Baal HaBayit is honoring his guests.

Such a woman is referred to as a harlot.</p>\n  \n  <p>When the Torah was given, [relations with] a harlot became forbidden, as [Deuteronomy 23:18] states: \"There shall not be a harlot among the children of Israel.\"4 Therefore, a person who has relations with a woman for the sake of lust, without kiddushin, receives lashes as prescribed by the Torah, because he had relations with a harlot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Other Rabbis learn the prohibition from other Biblical verses, for example Ramban (Nachmanides) learns it from the verse: “And the earth shall not be filled with immorality” (Lev. 19; 29). </p>\n\n<p>The Raavad, holds (from <a href=\"http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/237,137532/What-is-the-Torah-source-prohibiting-premarital-sex.html#footnote1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AskMoses.com</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Raavad, according to most authorities, deduces it directly from the command to marry. Implicit in the command to marry, he says, is a prohibition of all nonmarital intercourse. This is technichally referred to as an \"Issur assei.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As you can see, there's no reason that paternity test could or should change anything, since paternity is not the reason for the prohibition is not because of paternity. It's because G-d said so. Even if you say that the Rambam's paternity problem refers to general premarital relations (which, from context, I don't think it does) that's only a logical reason that fit with his times. The <em>real</em> reason that it's prohibited always remains the same: </p>\n\n<h2>G-d said.</h2>\n\n<p>The disagreement is only about <em>where</em> He said it.</p>\n\n\n",

It would have been equivalent to if R' Eliezer had said \"one who does not have a good eye.\"</p>\n\n<p>That said, the simplest way to understand R' Shimon's statement is that it is simply an example of a more general trait. R' Shimon's idea of the <em>derech ra'ah</em> is also the opposite of \"seeing what is born...\". It is the person who acts without thinking, without planning at all. Someone who doesn't even see the immediate consequences of his actions, however obvious they are. \"The person who borrows and does not repay\" is R' Shimon's way of expressing this trait. (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39934&st=&pgnum=171\">Midrash Shmuel</a> quotes this understanding of the mishna from several commentators.)</p>\n\n<p>A deeper understanding is brought by the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42839&st=&pgnum=256\">Maharal</a>, who understands the <em>midda</em> of <em>yiras chet</em> associated with R' Shimon as a pure intellect that brings one closer in comparison to a heavenly being, an intellect that understands the ramifications of everything that happens. One who is closer in status to heavenly beings understands them better, and hence has a deeper <em>yira</em> towards God. Maharal understands one of the central aspects of this higher intellectual state as \"self-sufficiency\" (פשיטות), not relying on other things or people for existence. Someone who borrows from others, and not only that, but remains in their debt, is the epitome of reliance on others. This is how R' Shimon therefore expresses the opposite of \"<em>yarei chet</em>\".</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Judaism consider virginity to be a virtue?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Wikipedia outlines the attitudes of various cultures towards <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginity#Judaism\">virginity</a> including:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h2>Judaism</h2>\n  \n  <p>In Judaism, sex is not considered to be sinful. Though premarital sex is disapproved, there is no requirement for a female to be a virgin at her marriage, and a child born to an unmarried female is not regarded as illegitimate (mamzer) or subject to any social or religious disabilities.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sex within marriage is considered a virtue (mitzvah, literally a 'commandment'). Jewish law contains rules related to protecting female virgins and dealing with consensual and non-consensual pre-marital sex. The thrust of Jewish law's guidance on sex is effectively that it should not be rejected, but should be lived as a wholesome part of life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Frankly, this doesn't sound at all like the attitude toward virginity that I glean from reading the Tanakh.  While the description seems to be <em>technically</em> accurate, it also uses weaselly language (\"disapproved\", \"no requirement\", \"not regarded\", etc.) to give the impression that virginity is no big deal.</p>\n\n<p>Does the quoted text reflect the modern, Jewish attitude toward premarital sex?  If it doesn't, how should this section be phrased to not mislead a non-Jew such as myself?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>An example of a Torah passage that leads me to think virginity is a virtue would be:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[The priest who is exalted above his fellows] may marry only a woman who is a virgin. A widow, or a divorced woman, or one who is degraded by harlotry—such he may not marry. Only a virgin of his own kin may he take to wife—that he may not profane his offspring among his kin, for I the Lord have sanctified him.—Leviticus 21:13-15 (<a href=\"http://www.taggedtanakh.org/Chapter/Index/english-Lev-21\">NJPS</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>The Wikipedia passage you quoted is accurate but could do with some elaboration.  Their use of the word \"virtue\" may have misled you because other religions see sex more negatively.  While not encouraging promiscuity, Judaism also doesn't call for asceticism.  Procreation is an outcome of sex but not the only motivation.</p>\n\n<p>Within marriage, a certain level of sexual attention is a woman's right (but she can always decline).  I wouldn't use the word \"virtue\" for this any more than I would for the financial support a husband owes his wife.  It's just part of the deal; the ketubah specifies that sex is one of the three things he specifically owes her (the others are food and clothing), and this is also noted in Ex. 21:10 (h/t Double AA).  For more on sex within marriage see <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/sex.htm\">this Judaism 101 page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Virginity is not a requirement for marriage, but the financial arrangements are slightly different for virgins and non-virgins.  A non-virgin receives a smaller ketubah (divorce settlement), though if she was previously married then she presumably was due either another ketubah or an inheritance, so this doesn't strike me as punative.  A convert also receives the same lower ketubah, yet we welcome converts.  For much more on the financial impact of virginity (or its loss), see <a href=\"http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/legal-religious-status-of-virgin\">legal-religious status of the virgin</a>, which also discusses the financial penalties for having premarital relations with a virgin. </p>\n\n<p>The torah passage you quoted is specifically about the kohein gadol, the high priest.  Other kohanim (descendants through the male line of Aharon the high priest) may marry virgins or widows, but not divorced women or converts.  The position of kohein gadol carries both restrictions and privileges not present elsewhere, so I wouldn't generalize too much from that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>The Talmud (Sanhedrin 22b) points out that a woman tends to be more emotionally involved with the man with whom she first had relations. (I think that there are modern studies that say much the same thing.) Furthermore, to a certain degree - this part is true of men as well - a person tends to at least subconsciously compare their current partner with previous ones; and such thoughts during intimacy have a spiritual effect on any children born therefrom (Talmud, Nedarim 20b).</p>\n\n<p>On that basis, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_ha-Chinuch\">Sefer Hachinuch</a> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37519&pgnum=170\">mitzvah 272</a> - sourced in the verses you cited) suggests that since the high priest is the highest-level servant of G-d among the Jewish people, G-d wanted to ensure that his relationship with his wife is as emotionally and mentally intimate as possible, and thus also that their children - one of whom will, hopefully, succeed his father in this position - will be conceived from a union in which no one else but the two of them (and G-d) are involved.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To the extent that virginity is a sign of proper sexual behavior, it is a virtue.

So animals, which were created from such coarse matter, need shechitah - the main purpose of which is to drain their lifeblood - to refine their physicality and make it suitable for human consumption, since we are also made from dust. Birds - same thing, but less so, so they need the refinement brought about through shechitah, albeit of only one siman.

The Gemara answers that we will have to ask Eliyahu HaNavi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אי פסקא זוהמא מיניה אי לא פסקא זוהמא מיניה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Chidushei HaRan writes that at the time of Eve's sin, the snake transmitted <em>zuhama</em> (some sort of filth) onto her and the rest of Creation. When the Torah was given at Mount Sinai, the filth was removed from all categories of creatures in the world that had representatives present at Mount Sinai. This excludes fish, who could not attend. (Since their absence was not under their control, however, perhaps the <em>zuhama</em> was removed from fish, too).</p>\n<p>The Sefas Emes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14521&st=&pgnum=153\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid.</a>) writes that the <em>zuhama</em> only leaves animals entirely when they are ritually slaughtered. The Sefas Emes suggests that fish have <em>zuhama</em> because there's no way to remove it from them (<em>shechita</em> is not applicable). Perhaps the Sefas Emes is extending the Ran's idea (who he quotes), and means that there is no <em>shechita</em> for fish <em>because</em> it won't accomplish anything. Animals, however, that were at Sinai, can have their <em>zuhama</em> removed through ritual slaughter.</p>\n<p>(As far as birds, the Sfas Emes points out that, even according to the opinion that birds only require <em>nechiras simanim mid'oraysa</em>, that would also function to remove the <em>zuhama</em>).</p>\n<p>Additionally, the following perspective comes from <a href=\"http://www.breslov.com/world/parsha/shemini_5756.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breslov.com</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since fish live under the water and are thus concealed from view, they are protected from the gaze of the seventy nations of the world. As mentioned above, kosher animals require shechita in order to remove the negative spiritual energies of immorality they have absorbed. Therefore, the righteous, who by definition are individuals who are very far removed from immoral behavior are compared to fish, who are also very far removed from the spiritual energies of immorality. This is why Yosef (Joseph) was blessed that his offspring should be like fish, as the verse says, \"May they [Yosef's offspring] proliferate abundantly like fish within the land.\" (Genesis 48:16) Yosef is the only Biblical figure to be referred to as \"HaTzaddik\" (the saintly), because he resisted temptation and refused to have any immoral association with his master's wife. Just as the negative spiritual energies emitted from the eye have no negative effect upon fish in the water, similarly the offspring of Yosef are protected from the evil eye and the spiritual energies of immorality associated with the eye.</p>\n<p>An additional reason fish do not require shechita is that they live in the water. Besides the fact that water acts as a protective shield against the negative spiritual energies of immorality emitted from the eyes of the nations of the world, it also contains the spiritual energies of purity associated with the hereafter and the Messianic era, when morality and the knowledge of Hashem will prevail, as the verse says, \"For the earth [in the Messianic age] shall be full of the knowledge of Hashem, as the waters cover the sea.\" (Isaiah 11:9)</p>\n<p>Fish were protected from the spiritual energies of immorality generated by the generation of the flood because they were concealed by the waters. Therefore, the fish didn't need the spiritual cleansing of the ark that the surviving animals and birds required, as the verse says, \"And all flesh that moves upon the earth expired [in the flood]--among the birds, the animals, the beasts, and all the creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all mankind. All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of everything that was on dry land died [The verse mentions only the death of land creatures, implying that Hashem spared the fish, because they did not participate in man's sins (Talmud: Zevachim 113b)].\" (Genesis 7:21, 22) And thus, there is no need to perform shechita on fish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From a standpoint of practicality, also, just taking fish out of the water kills the fish, though not instantaneously. Even if possible, it is not practical to require <em>shechita</em> of fish.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I heard the following in a shiur by Rabbi Tatz*:</p>\n<p>During the flood all the animals were destroyed, apart from those that remained on the teivah, and fish. The fish were saved on account that they were immersed in water which is a metaphor for the protection granted by Torah (which is compared to water).</p>\n<p>Kosher land animals that require shechita have a body and head which are separated by a neck. This separation symbolizes the ruchniyut (the head) and gashmiyut (the body). Before we are permitted to eat a kosher land animal, we must shecht it at the throat as a symbol of the permission of the gashmiyut (the body) to the exclusion of the ruchniyut (the head).</p>\n<p>Fish do not have a neck. In fact, the head and body are connected with no 'neck'. Rabbi Tatz said that this symbolized a higher spiritual level than land animals (I'm not sure what this means) in that the ruchniyut and gashmiyut are mixed. Therefore, with the absence of a neck, the nature of fish shows us that we do not need to symbolically 'separate' the head from the body for fish. Thus, no shechita is required for fish.</p>\n<p>*if anyone has the sources to these please feel free to edit; I am simply recalling parts of the shiur that I remember, and making it relevant to this question.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Bread between fish and meat requires hamotzi?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14164&pgnum=234\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>OC</em> 212:1</a> (with my own loose translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All that is main, and with it is a subordinate (<em>tafel</em>) thing — one says a benediction on the main thing and exempts the subordinate both from the benediction preceding and from the one after it. It's not necessary that the subordinate thing be mixed with the main: rather, even if each is separate.</p>\n<p>Even bread, which is most important of all, if it is subordinate — for example, say he eats salty fish and eats bread with it so it not harm him in his throat, he says a benediction over the fish and exempts the bread, as it is subordinate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Rama</em> adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That which we say a benediction on the main thing, exempting the subordinate, is when he's eating them together or eating the main thing first. If, however, he's eating the subordinate thing first,... he says a benediction on the food first....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See there, and the commentaries, for more. In particular, there's a bit of a brouhaha about what benediction to make on a subordinate food eaten before the main food. As always, CYLOR for practical guidance.</p>\n<p>Now, <em>some</em> have the following practice, cited with approval by <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14164&pgnum=133\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Mishna B'rura</em> (173:4)</a>: If they're going to be eating fish followed by meat, they eat something in between to clean out their mouths. (I've even heard some have a preference for bread for this purpose; <em>perhaps</em> there's support from the <em>Rosh</em> cited in <em>Tur Y.D.</em> 116.)</p>\n<p>Would the above rule from 212:1 apply to 173:4 bread — bread which is eaten after fish and before meat for the purpose of cleaning out the mouth? That is, is such bread considered subordinate? (I'd guess so, since it's being eaten for a reason similar to the salty-fish bread's.) If so, then is it considered subordinate to that which is eaten before it or to what comes after?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>When Halacha deals with foods which are Ikar/Tafel (main/subordinate) - the Ikar/Tafel relationship is a logical one.</p>\n\n<p>In this case the bread has nothing to do with neither the fish nor the meat - so it wouldn't be in the geder of Ikar/Tafel.</p>\n\n<p>In your example above, eating the bread after the salty fish is in order not to harm him in his throat - this is because the bread has the quality to neutralize the saltiness or bitterness off the Ikar food. This relationship is logical. </p>\n\n<p>It's true that you're only eating the bread in order to eat the meat - but this is only to fulfill the halachik requirement of separation between meat and fish  - not because the bread is related in any way to either the fish or the meat (in the Ikar/Tafel sense).</p>\n\n<p>So how can you bless on something that you don't really want to eat? Well, whether you like it or not when you eat from it - you benefit from it - so the blessing is not vain.</p>\n\n<p>Just to give an example of what i'm trying to say:</p>\n\n<p>Some have the custom (cited in the Sidur Hayabetz) when eating rice not within a meal: to first make a bracha on something Mezonot,Adamah and Shehakol and only then eat the rice (because of the uncertainty of the bracha for rice) So according to the logic used in your question : how would this custom work? would we say that these 3 foods are Tafel to the rice?</p>\n\n\n",

He writes many things including (quote):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Neither men nor women should dress, speak, or act in a licentious manner that will arouse the sexual attention of others. It is a\n  violation of tseniut to wear skimpy, overly tight, or other clothing\n  that is designed to highlight one’s sexuality.</p></li>\n  <li><p>It is proper for men and women to dress nicely, neatly, and modestly. It is fine to dress fashionably, as long as those fashions\n  do not violate the philosophy of tseniut.</p></li>\n  <li><p>In our society, it is normal for upstanding and proper women to wear pants/pants suits; short sleeved dresses/blouses; clothes with\n  colorful designs. Wearing these things is not a violation of tseniut,\n  as long as these items are not fashioned in such a way as to highlight\n  one’s sexuality.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Married women need not cover their hair, as long as their hair is maintained in a modest style. The wearing of wigs does not constitute\n  a proper hair-covering for those married women who wish to cover their\n  hair. Rather, such women should wear hats or other head coverings that\n  actually cover their hair.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Men and women may sing in the presence of those of the other gender, as long as the songs are of a religious nature, or of a\n  general cultural nature (e.g. opera, folk songs, lullabies). People\n  should neither sing nor listen to songs that have vulgar language or\n  erotic content that will lead to improper thoughts or behavior.</p></li>\n  <li><p>If a person dresses, speaks, and acts in a proper, dignified manner, it is not his/her responsibility if others are sexually\n  aroused by him/her. That is their problem. It is their responsibility\n  to control their thoughts and emotions, and/or to remove themselves\n  from situations that they find to be sexually provocative.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Normal interactions between men and women are a feature of our societies. Women may serve in positions of authority over men, just as\n  men may serve in positions of authority over women. The key point is\n  this: holiness and tseniut should characterize all contexts where men\n  and women mingle and work together. Co-ed youth groups and schools are\n  permitted, but must be maintained with high standards of tseniut.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, he concludes...</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Avraham Shammah, who teaches at the Herzog Teachers’ College in\n  Israel, stated: “Women and men should behave in a manner that reflects\n  great respect for one another; they should not consider one another in\n  a crude manner such as sexual objects; they should not dress\n  provocatively, nor should their body language be provocative….” This\n  is a fine formulation of the guidelines of tseniut. It makes little\n  sense to pretend that our living conditions today are identical to\n  those of antiquity and the middle ages. Women’s roles in society have\n  changed radically. The interrelationships of men and women today are\n  far more common and far more frequent than in former times. Fashions\n  have changed dramatically. Definitions of brazenness and immodesty are\n  far different today than they were in olden days. Recognizing these\n  changes is essential to formulating a proper application of tseniut\n  rules. It must also be recognized, though, that modern-day fashions\n  often reflect very non-tseniut standards. Clothing that is designed to\n  be sexually provocative—low cut in front or back, dresses or skirts\n  above knee-length, clothing that is too tight, men’s pants that are\n  worn below the belt line, and so forth—are clearly in violation of the\n  philosophy and rules of tseniut. Our goal as thinking halakhic Jews is\n  to be clear on our responsibility to be holy, and to treat ourselves\n  and others as fellow human beings—not as sexual objects. When we live\n  as tseniut human beings, we enhance our own dignity and the dignity we\n  show to others. This is not an inconsiderable accomplishment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Halachic requirements to allow men to pray in the presence of women differ somewhat from modesty requirements incumbent upon the woman when in the presence of others.

However, it is certainly absolutely forbidden to pray in the presence of a woman whose skirt does not cover past the knees when she is sitting down, because the skirt will not cover ervah.</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Moshe Brim and Rav Yair Yedidya Pacha answer and explain the reasoning of the <em>mitzvah.</em> They explain the <em>issur</em> of not leaving over a corner comes from the <em>mitzvah</em> of leaving over for the poor. Therefore if one would leave over four little corners or one big corner there would be no difference, as long as something was left over. The <em>issur</em> of rounding the corners come from the <em>issur</em> of <em>chukas hagoyim</em> therefore one gets the <em>issur</em> if he rounds one or both of them.

(i.e. not erasing it, discarding a document containing it only through special means, not saying the name in vain) Or does it require no more respect than any other word?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>The ultimate source is Shabbos 10b, citing Judg. 6:24, ויקרא לו ה' שלום.</p>\n\n<p>For certain purposes it is indeed treated like a bona fide name of Hashem; thus, the Gemara there says (and this is cited as halachah in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49623&st=&pgnum=227\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 84:1</a>)) that one may not greet another in the bathhouse with the word \"Shalom,\" just as one may not recite blessings or words of Torah there.</p>\n\n<p>Baer Heitev (:2) and Mishnah Berurah (:6) discuss whether this also applies to calling a person whose name is Shalom. M.B. ends up saying that technically it is permissible, but that \"one who fears Heaven should be strict\" and change the name somehow, like by eliding the final mem or changing it to a nun. (Say, Shalom, if you read this: what do people call you in the mikvah?)</p>\n\n<p>He also goes on to say that it is best not to write \"Shalom\" in private letters either, for the same reason. This is further discussed in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=213\">Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 276:13</a> and the commentaries there; Shach :16 says that most people aren't careful about this, though in Nekudos Hakesef he questions whether it is correct to do so. (Pischei Teshuvah :28 notes that there's a difference in this regard whether one uses the word \"Shalom\" as a greeting - in which case he indeed presumably intends to call down Hashem's blessings on the other person - vs. when one writes about \"shalom\" as a concept, like speaking of world peace.)</p>\n\n\n",

(Yes, it was known for its pastureland, but surely moral concerns should have overridden that!)</p>\n\n<p>Or did it become the most immoral area when the Jews were there, and, if so, how do we understand that?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(I'm using the term <em>Jews</em> loosely throughout to refer to <em>Yaakov</em>'s family.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The source for Rashi is the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14026&st=&pgnum=204\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Sifra - Toras Kohanim</em></a> which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מנין שלא היתה אומה באומות שהתעיבו מעשיהם יותר מן המצריים ת״ל כמעשה ארץ מצרים לא תעשו. מנין לדור אחרון שהתעיבו מעשיהם יותר מכולם ת״ל כמעשה ארץ מצרים לא תעשו. מנין למקום שישבו בו ישראל שהתעיבו מעשיהם יותר מכולם ת״ל אשר ישבתם בה לא תעשו . ומנין שישיבתם של ישראל גרמה להם לכל המעשים הללו ת״ל אשר ישבתם בה לא\n   תעשו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Loosely translated:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From where do we see that there was no nation as morally corrupt as the Egyptians? The verse (Leviticus 18:3) teaches, \"According to the ways of the land of Egypt... you shall not do.\" From where do we see that the last generation was more corrupt than all of them? \"According to the ways of the land of Egypt... you shall not do.\" From where do we know that the place where the Jews settled was more corrupt than all of them? \"\"That you dwelled in, you shall not do.\" And from where do we know that the settling of the Jews caused them to engage in all these acts? \"That you dwelled in do not do.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would appear to indicate that Goshen only became the most immoral location in Egypt after the Jews settled there, and that it became progressively worse while they were there, so that they sunk to their lowest depths during the last generation before the Exodus. The Sifra concludes (although the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37625&st=&pgnum=378\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malbim</a> understands the conclusion differently) that it was the presence of the Jews that caused this moral descent. The Rash M'Shantz and Raavad both write that the reason for this is that the sin of enslaving the Jews caused them to sink progressively lower - for עבירה גוררת עבירה - one sin brings another. (It may be worth mentioning that slavery has often been noted for having a deeply unhealthy effect on the morality of the slave-owners.)</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49497&st=&pgnum=166\" rel=\"nofollow\">הגהות מהרי\"ד</a> adds (along the lines of Yehuda's answer) that there is a natural reaction of impurity against holiness, so that when the Jewish people dwelt in Goshen, the higher level of holiness caused a parallel increase in impurity in the surrounding society. (Personally, I am not terribly satisfied with this approach for several reasons. On a peshat level, my main criticism is that, according to this approach, as the Jewish people fell under the influence of the surrounding society (as many sources indicate), this should have caused the rise in immorality to abate, yet the midrash indicates that the last generation was the worst of all!)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>One possible thought could be that God made the powers of Good and Evil one against each other. Rav Chaim Kaufman ZT\"L (<em>Gateshead</em>) says that on the day that Esau came home and ate the lentils, the Medrash says he had just killed the evil Nimrod. Why is it on that same day that Avraham Avinu died as well. He explained that whenever a certain amount of Kedusha enters the world God created an equal amount of tumah in to counter it to keep the world stable. Therefor after the one died, the world would have been unstable had the other not died as well. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi in Parshas Kedoshim says the <code>wherever you find Kedusha there you will find Ervah</code> and need appropiate fences against it. Perhaps therefore after the Yidden populated Goshen and introduced so much Tehara, God created Erva alongside it as part the natural balancing process and to keep to <code>wherever you find Kedusha there you will find Ervah</code>.</p>\n\n\n",

The advice on this is that one urge himself to study the rules of <em>Shabas</em> and to review them always so he knows what's forbidden and what's permitted. Without that, even if he learns all the exhortatory things that urge one to keep <em>Shabas</em> properly, that won't help him.… [Rabbi <em>Yonasan</em> Eybeschutz] already assured us that it is utterly impossible in practice to be saved from committing a <em>Shabas</em> prohibition unless he learns all the rules very well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I seem to recall a similar idea written about the rules of <em>lashon hara</em> — and, indeed, much the same can be said about many areas of <em>halacha</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Considering that a twelve- or thirteen-year-old is obliged to follow all the details of <em>halacha</em>, it would seem, therefore, to behoove elementary-school teachers to focus on <em>halacha</em> to the extent that their students will retain it.

Second, it is important to keep in mind the purpose of Megillas Ruth in the first place. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14367&st=&pgnum=10\">Abarbanel</a> writes that Shmuel Hanavi wrote Ruth after he anointed David to highlight David's ancestry and to show that he came from noble stock. The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19522&st=&pgnum=15\">Chida</a> writes that Shmuel wrote Megillas Ruth to counter the claims that arose later against David's kingship saying that he was unfit being that he descended from a Moabite which the Torah prohibits entering our nation. The famous response to this was \"מואבי ולא מואביה\" (only male Moabites are prohibited to marry). Shmuel wished to show how even though Ruth was a Moabite, she was a righteous woman and earned the respect and marriage of the great <em>shofet</em> Boaz. (Chida refers to this as Shmuel's \"<em>p'sak</em>\" that David was legitimate.)</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, it is quite possible to say that the reason the text continues to stress her Moabite origins is precisely to counter that claim that was common at the time of its authorship. In other words: <em>even though she was a Moabite</em>, look how great she was and how Boaz accepted her etc. However, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37315&st=&pgnum=115\">Alshich</a> writes the opposite. When he sees the text refer to Ruth as \"מואביה\", he explains that even though she had already converted, she still retained some of the nature of her original upbringing in the way she conducted herself. He explains at length what it was that she did that was \"Moabite in nature\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>There are indeed a lot of opinions on when Ruth underwent conversion. <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%90_%D7%99%D7%91\">Rashi (to Ruth 1:12)</a> states that she (and Orpah) were still gentiles when they were on the road back to Eretz Yisrael (indeed, we derive from their conversation the halachah that we are to attempt to dissuade a prospective convert (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=47b&format=pdf\">Yevamos 47b</a>)). On the other hand, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38591&pgnum=260\">Zohar Chadash</a> strongly takes issue with the idea that Machlon could have married a non-Jew; it explains that basically he coerced her into converting (and then, only after her husband's death, did she accept Judaism voluntarily).</p>\n\n<p>I once suggested (<a href=\"http://www.haoros.com/download.asp?kovetzID=982&ext=pdf\">Kovetz Haoros Ubeurim Oholei Torah, no. 982</a>, page 76), based on some other Midrashic statements, that at the time of her marriage Ruth was halachically not yet an adult, because she was an <em>ailonis</em> (a woman who never undergoes the normal bodily changes of puberty) but didn't exhibit the symptoms thereof (listed in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=2866\">Rambam, Hil. Ishus 2:6</a>); in that case she reaches halachic maturity only at age 35 (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=2864\">ibid. 2:4</a>). So Machlon had her converted as a child (as per the halachah - <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=194\">Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 268:7</a>), but once she reached halachic adulthood she had the opportunity to renounce her conversion (ibid.) - and that's why Naomi had to point out to her the full ramifications of her decision, so that her acceptance of the mitzvos would be a conscious one.</p>\n\n<p>(And once this was accomplished, then it retroactively validated her conversion as a child - just as is true today when a child is converted and then continues to keep mitzvos after bar/bas mitzvah; thus, no further conversion ceremony was needed when they arrived in Eretz Yisrael, and indeed none is recorded.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.torahanytime.com/video/ruth-revealed-the-astounding-approach-of-the-rogotchover/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this shiur</a> Rabbi Daniel Glatstein makes the point, based on the Tzafnas Paneach, that it is possible that Rus and Orpah converted before they married but that their conversion was in doubt. He points to Rambam issurei biah 13:14-15 which states that if there is reason to suspect that the conversion was for reasons beside belief (money, power, love etc.) then the conversion has to be investigated. He goes on to say that Naomi probed the motives behind the conversion of her daughter in laws during her trek home as did Boaz during his initial meeting with Rus. Once Rus came to Boaz at night this clinched his belief that her conversion was for the right reasons and he immediately proceeds to \"redeem\" her. </p>\n\n\n",

Since then, it has become popular to start charitable organizations under that name. These organizations typically cite the Talmud's story about R' Meir and assure people that they will be saved from trouble or find lost objects if they donate to that organization, possibly with the additional requirement of reciting a formula including the Roman guard's prayer and a Midrashic teaching (B'reishis Rabba, 53:14) about finding hidden things (e.g., see <a href=\"http://chibasjerusalem.com/id23.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>In reality, an organization that decides to name itself something like \"Rabbi Meir Baal Haness\" does not automatically acquire a superior claim to the <em>segula</em> described in the first paragraph.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://chibasjerusalem.com/id23.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this website (an internet portal for a self-named Rebbi Meir Ba'al HaNes charity</a>, FWIW),</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"There is a Minhag (custom) to give Tzedakah (Charity) to the Tzedakah of Rabbi Meyer Baal Haness  when one is in a situation of any need or distress.

The context of capital crimes in which \"<em>lo signov</em>\" appears implies that it too must be the capital crime of kidnapping. The meaning of the <em>pasuk</em> is therefore slightly different (i.e. more specified) than the meaning of the words de(or re)contextualized.

Also, even if it does belong there, the pronoun אִתּוֹ is left without <em>any</em> antecedent. The mefarshim (or at least the ones that I saw) do not provide an explanation for this.</p>\n\n<p>What is אִתּוֹ reffereing to, why do the mefarshim want to move the passuk to Vayikra, and (how) would that solve the problem (the last two might be the same question)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The phrase לְדַבֵּר אִתּוֹ is clearly referring to Moshe - \"When Moshe went to the Tent of Meeting, (for Hashem) to speak to him (Moshe).\" This is clear from the posuk itself since, as the question points out, there has to be an antecedant for this pronoun, and the only possibility is Moshe who is mentioned in the beginning of the posuk.</p>\n\n<p>This is also the way the posuk is translated <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0407.htm#89\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, and if you want a clear proof to this translation, Rashi on the first posuk in Vayikra lists the thirteen phrases where Hashem's speaking to Moshe excludes Aharon, and this phrase is the first one in the list!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It would seem that Moshe already knew that God would speak to him from between the cherubim, since God explained that to him during the initial instructions on how to build the Mishkan (See Exodus 25:22).  This would preclude your idea that Moshe did not know who was speaking.</p>\n\n<p>Jake seemed to be on to an answer in indicating that the sentence structure is similar.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi's commentary on the first verse of Vayikra may help as it refers directly to the last verse in Nasso:</p>\n\n<p><strong>to him:</strong> Heb. אֵלָיו [That is, God spoke only to Moses. This phrase comes] to exclude Aaron. Rabbi Judah [Ben Betheira] says: “Thirteen times in the Torah, God spoke (וַיְדַבֵּר) to both Moses and Aaron together, and, corresponding to them were thirteen [other] occasions [when God spoke only to Moses] precluding [Aaron], to teach you that they were not said [directly] to Aaron, but to Moses, that he should say them to Aaron. These are the thirteen cases where [Aaron was] precluded: (1) ”To speak with him…,“ (2) ”…speaking to him…,“ (3) ”…and He spoke to him“ (Num. 7:89); (4) ”I will meet with you [there at set times], etc. …“ (Exod. 25:22) All of them can be found [in the above dictum of Rabbi Judah] in Torath Kohanim (1:4). Now, [even though it was Moses who exclusively heard the prophecies,] one might think that they [i.e., the rest of Israel, nevertheless] heard the sound [of God] ”calling“ [to Moses preceding the prophecy]. Scripture therefore, says: [not ”He heard] the voice [speaking] to him (לוֹ),“ [but] ”[he heard] the voice [speaking right up] to him (אֵלָיו)“ (Num. 7:89). [This verse could have used the word לוֹ, ”to him,“ rather than such an exclusive expression as אֵלָיו, ”right up to him.\" However, it uses this expression in order to teach us that only] Moses heard [the Divine voice calling him], while all [the rest] of Israel did not hear [it]. — [Torath Kohanim 1:4]      </p>\n\n<p>אליו: למעט את אהרן. ר' יהודה בן בתירא אומר שלשה עשר דברות נאמרו בתורה למשה ולאהרן, וכנגדן נאמרו שלשה עשר מיעוטין, ללמדך שלא לאהרן נאמרו אלא למשה שיאמר לאהרן. ואלו הן שלשה עשר מיעוטין לדבר אתו, מדבר אליו, וידבר אליו, ונועדתי לך, כולן בתורת כהנים. יכול שמעו את קול הקריאה, תלמוד לומר קול לו, קול אליו (במדבר ז פט), משה שמע, וכל ישראל לא שמעו:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading.asp?AID=15574&p=1&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading.asp?AID=15574&p=1&showrashi=true</a></p>\n\n<p>As the commentators indicate, it seems that there is some sort of link between these two verses.  In Vayikra, God speaks directly to Moses, \"right up to him\", such that Moses knows Who is speaking without the actual Name of God being mentioned until several words later.  In Nasso, Moses goes in to speak \"to It\", such that Moses is speaking with the Voice without it being mentioned until several words later.  Rashi's commentary states that only Moses could hear God speak when He called in Vayikra.  To an onlooker, it would thus have seemed as if Moses was talking to no one. The use of the verse in Nasso as an example would seem to imply that, in the same way, when Moses spoke to the Voice, an onlooker would have thought he was speaking to the Ark or to the Tent of Meeting.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this is helpful.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think approaching this question with the comment @Ari A made is promising: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Also, this narrative started, as far as I can tell, with the first\n  passuk in Bamidbar: וַיְדַבֵּר ה אֶל-מֹשֶׁה בְּמִדְבַּר סִינַי,\n  בְּאֹהֶל מוֹעֵד. I find it difficult to say that the first time Hashem\n  talks to moshe from the Ohel Moed comes seven prakim after this\n  passuk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Antencedents in question like this are based on context by means of references in the text. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rashiyomi.com/rule1614.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">From Weekly Rashi Digest:</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֶת הָאַיִל יַעֲשֶׂה זֶבַח שְׁלָמִים לַי־הֹוָ־ה עַל סַל הַמַּצּוֹת\n  וְעָשָׂה הַכֹּהֵן אֶת מִנְחָתוֹ וְאֶת נִסְכּוֹ:</p>\n  \n  <p>He shall make the ram as a peace offering to the Lord, along with the\n  basket of unleavened cakes, and the kohen shall perform the service of\n  its meal offering with its libation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The question here is what \"its\" refers to - the ram? Or the meal offering, which is the more immediate antecedent? </p>\n\n<p>Rashi answers this question by looking FURTHER in the chapter - we are at Nu06-17b, and he references Nu15-06:07!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth measures\n  of flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil. And for a drink\n  offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, for a sweet\n  savor to the Lord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As stated: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This then justifies the interpretation of its as referring back to ram\n  rather than the immediate antecedent, the meal offering. So the heart\n  of the Rashi comment is based on the reference method.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given that context is completely valid, and that a reference which is separate from the pronoun in question is at a distance from the question at hand, I do not think it is unlikely that the distance of seven prakim Ari A stated is a barrier to be considered an antecedent (considering here we further in the book itself). A contextual antecedent not part of a sentence or at a distance is valid. </p>\n\n\n",

Is this to say that sorcery does not work unless the practitioner is grounded?</p>\n\n<p>If so, how can we interpret the Midrash (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%94_%D7%9B_%D7%9B\">Bamidbar Rabba, 20:20</a>) that states that Bilaam used sorcery to fly through the air?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Perhaps one need be grounded only to cast the spell (as @DoubleAA said <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16216/flying-and-sorcery#comment33739_16216\">here</a>).

Like in Sanhedrin 68a (i think) where it explains that with the death of Rabbi Eliezer witchcraft was forgotten amongst the sages, it is likely that Shimon Ben Shetach (the Nasi in his time) also was familiar with witchcraft. Therefore, perhaps he knew that this particular form of witchcraft required being attached to the ground, where as Bilaam (an \"expert\" that a King sought out) would probably have spells in his arsenal (?) that wouldn't require being on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Also, note that Balak himself was an expert in various types of witchcraft/sorcery, but needed to enlist Bilaam due to his specific expertise in a certiain 'field' </p>\n\n\n",

Maimonides seems to indicate that there will be no change between our age the the age of the messiah. Does this mean no prophecy?

If so by what right do they seek to overturn a decision of the Sanhedrin?</p>\n\n<p>If there is no prophecy during the messianic age does that mean that those prophets who return during the resurrection of the dead will no longer receive prophecy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=26834&st=&pgnum=46\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam in Iggeres Teiman</a> explicitly says that prophecy will return in the year 4972 (which is 1216) and says (in the Yad) that <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=5&perek=9&halocha=2&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moshiach will be a prophet</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the Rambam discusses the laws of prophecy in his Mishna Torah in Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah. At first glace, it's out of place (it would be more appropriate to either place these laws in Hilchos Melachim with the other discussions regarding Moshiach or to remove them altogether - whatever happened [in the time of the first Beis Hamikdash] happened). The fact that the place of these halachos is in Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah is because the concept of a prophet exists even in exile. </p>\n\n<p>We even find a person called a Baal Tosfos called \"Ezra HaNavi\" in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=19&daf=88&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gittin 88a D\"H Vedilma</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>While its likely there was a connection between the disappearance of prophecy and idolatry, this does not mean the connection is absolute.

According to Masechet Avodah Zarah 14b, Avraham Avinu composed tractate Avodah Zarah, and that our editions of the masechet only contain 5 out of the 400 chapters originally composed.  For example, anger is a form of idolatry, yet it was not taken away.  Masechet Shabbat 105b states \"<em>One who tears his clothes, breaks his utensils, and scatters his money in his rage should be in your eyes as one who commits idolatry.</em>\"  We do not know the extant of all the types of idolatry that were not taken away, so we also cannot know the extant of all the types of prophecy that we not taken away either.  Anger (a form of idolatry) was not taken away, so too it would logically follow (as I understand) that certain types of prophecy were also not taken away.  This goes in accordance with ShmuelBrin's answer that a \"prophet\" can exist in exile, because certain types of prophecy exist here.  The evil inclination is not a bad thing as long as we are able to control its force and harness its energy for the sake of good.</p>\n\n\n",

Does anyone know the real history behind it? What evidence do we have backing it up? Is it brought down in any written authoritative source?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>The main original source talking about the Golem was the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/4139\">Niflaos Maharal</a> published in 1909. It claims to have been written by the son-in-law of the Maharal (R' Yitzchok Katz) and was kept in the library in Metz, until (after being in the hands of some middle-men) it was discovered by R' Yudel Rosenberg of Warsaw. R' Rosenberg claims that the Noda Biyehuda went to the attic where the Golem lies (although he asked ten of his students to say Tehillim for him at the time, because of the danger).</p>\n\n<p>However, (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Judah_Loeb_Rapoport\">R'</a>) <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6757&st=&pgnum=54\">Shlomo Rappoport</a> says that the Maharal never created a Golem, and the stories are forgeries.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=13302&st=&pgnum=41\">R' Shwartz</a> also mentioned a proof to the fact that the Maharal did not create a Golem, in that no Rabbinic historian of his time mentioned the Golem. Neither the Chida nor the Tzemach Dovid (who was a student of the Maharal and wrote a sefer on Jewish history) wrote that the Maharal made a Golem.</p>\n\n<p>However,  R' Shwartz points outs that the ֲBnei Yissochor wrote that the Maharal used to use Sefer Yetzira (the Kabbalistic work discussing the creation of Golems) and the Imrei Yosef (the Rebbe from Spinka) quotes the Niflaos Maharal (obviously being of the opinion that it's a legitimate sefer).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, he writes that it in Megilas Yuchsin (written and published in 1864, some forty years before Niflaos Maharal) that the Shoel Umeishiv (who was alive when this sefer was published) went to Prague and wanted to go to where the Golem lies. The Gabbai told him that before the Noda BeYehuda went up there, he fasted and went went to Mikva, then he wrapped himself in a Tallis and Tefillin and went up. When he came down, he said that no one else should go up there.</p>\n\n<p>So R' Shwartz answers that it's possible that the Maharal created this golem for a short period of time and then destroyed it. However, people made up rumors about it.</p>\n\n\n",

First, there is a machloket if the weeks count is an absolute requirement (l'ikuva) on every day, or only on the full weeks (days 7, 14, 21 etc.). There is also a machloket if one needs to intend to fulfill the mitzva in order to fulfill the mitzva. The Mishna Berura rules that even if we think like the opinion who holds that weeks are not integral on the middle days, one still may have had to intend to fulfill the mitzva. Thus if one answered only the days and did not intend to fulfill the mitzva, he may continue and say a bracha that night.</p>\n\n<p>He finally notes that for us, who always count with the weeks in a very set nussach, the very fact that someone left out the weeks <em>shows</em> that he was not intending to fulfill the mitzva, and can possibly even function as 'negative kavana' guaranteeing the permissiblity of continuing to recite a blessing later that night.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.thehalacha.com/attach/Volume3/Issue16.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Halachically Speaking, Volume 3 Issue 16</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some poskim say one who has not yet counted the sefira of Lag B’omer should avoid telling someone else\n  today is Lag B’omer, since doing so may be considered counting the day.<sup>78</sup> Other poskim permit this since his\n  intention is not to count the day, rather he is referring to the name of the day since it is a day of simcha.<sup>79</sup> This\n  seems to be the minhag ha’olom.</p>\n  \n  <p>78: Refer to Shulchan Aruch 489:4, Biur Halacha 489 “sh’im,” Lag B’omer page 176.</p>\n  \n  <p>79: Ohr L’tzyion 3:16:4:footnote 4, Avnei Yushfei 5:75:5.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If no such mandate exists, that does not necessarily mean the inverse is true (i.e. that you may actively accommodate this behavior).</p>\n<p>To be clear, this is <strong>not</strong> related to chinuch or the desire not to be exposed and influenced by practices that are antithetical to the Torah. I am asking this in a purely halachic context.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>Rambam writes in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188353/jewish/Chapter-8.htm\">Hilchos Melachim 8</a>:10 that Moshe Rabeinu commanded us to force all humans to follow the 7 Mitzvos (and if they refuse, we must execute them). </p>\n\n<p>It is quite clear that in our times we don't have the power to enforce the penalty, but that doesn't mean that we are less obligated in trying to convince all people to follow the 7 Mitzvos voluntarily. </p>\n\n<p>Some would argue that this obligates Jews to actively promote observance of the 7 laws among gentiles. Others would argue that although this is theoretically true, as a matter of priorities we should expend such energies on Jewish outreach first. But I can't imagine a justification for \"not caring\".

Engaging in homosexual practices and activities does not result in new life and, in fact, is equated in traditional Jewish teaching with idol worship and murder.</p>\n<p>Rather, we are all enjoined, both Jews and non-Jews to serve G-d together.

A couple of people are the main sources of the problem (instigators). The problem, to be clear, is talking about inappropriate things during services loudly enough to disrupt others, including the sh'liach tzibbur.

Any approach that singles people out, even with halachic basis, will have a hard time permanently eradicating the problem.

It did not go well, from what I heard (I wasn't there that day), and the talker stopped coming to the minyan.  That's no good, everyone agreed, and various people tried to talk with him.  Then a week or so ago there was a minyan meeting, the stated goal of which was not \"how do we stop the talking?\" but \"what are we doing here and what do we value?\".  The meeting began with everybody answering the question \"why do you come to minyan?\" and then led into a discussion of values.  (I was out of town; I learned all this this morning.)</p>\n\n<p>People brought up several things that we could be doing better; for example, nobody realized that some people were having trouble hearing some of the shlichei tzibbur and they need to speak up or use a microphone (on weekdays).  There is concern that we're relying on the same two or three leaders but others feel intimidated and don't want to take it on, so we need to encourage and mentor.  There were concerns about better integrating the school children on days that they come so they feel part of it.  And there was a discussion about talking, with the following being written into a document that's sort of a statement of principles:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We ask that no side conversations be held on the bimah or in the pews during the prayer service, especially near the service leader.  If it is necessary to speak, we ask that you whisper and not speak aloud.  Every effort should be made to daven with the service leader not faster, slower, or louder.  The service leader runs the service and deserves the appropriate respect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The talker who had left returned earlier this week, sitting alone in the back.  It's too soon to say what the long-term effect will be.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know the formal status of the document or whether it will become something people are asked to sign as in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16277/472\">rachav's answer</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Five years later:</strong> Nobody talks about the document any more as far as I know (and it didn't become something people were asked to sign), but the noise level has stayed reasonable most of the time.  When conversations do become disruptive, one of several members of the minyan now \"shushes\" the people involved.  If that doesn't work, the <em>sh'liach tzibur</em> stops and waits, which has prompt results. The sha\"tz usually does not say anything about the noise, just waits.</p>\n\n<p>While the discussion raised awareness and the document recorded the results, it appears that a larger benefit of the whole process was to give everybody \"permission\" to do something about the problem when it arises.  It arises less often than it did; we didn't manage to stop it, but it's more controlled now.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Heretics in the bathroom\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>From my understanding a torah scroll written by a heretic has no sanctity and should be burned (Gittin 45b). May one read torah related material, written by a heretic but that contains nothing heretical, in the bathroom? Similarly may one read the koran in the bathroom since the Koran contains references to Allah which is ostensibly the same thing as Hashem (as opposed to \"in God we trust\" on currency which is a generic term)? </p>\n\n<p>possibly related - <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14461/is-there-any-difference-between-jewish-g-d-and-muslim-g-d\">Is there any difference between Jewish G-d and Muslim G-d?</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>A Torah scroll which is written by a heretic should be burned ,like you said. However, if one did not burn it and brought it into the bathroom that's also fine,but once one starts thinking about Torah in the bathroom that becomes a forbidden act (Shulchan Aruch OC 85:2). A Torah written by a heretic is not holy but if it is exactly the same as a kosher version then learning from it will bring thoughts of divrei Torah. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachman_of_Breslov\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Nachman from Bratslav</a> teaches that a person should always minimize his or her time spent in the \"throne room\" because of the spiritual impurities present in filthy places.  Likewise, <a href=\"http://www.machlispresents.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Mordechai Machlis</a> once told us that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avigdor_Miller\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Avigdor Miller</a> (a teacher of his) would keep in his bathroom a copy of the New Testament (i.e. Christian scripture) and Quran.  Ostensibly, even if he would read them, he would probably take care of his \"business\" as quickly as possible in order for him to get out of the place of spiritual deficiencies.  It perhaps may be permissible because they do indeed contain heresy, which is spiritually impure, which is allowed in the bathroom.  Not that it is necessarily required to read them in the bathroom.

The <strong><em>Rambam</em></strong> (<em>Sefer HaMitzvos</em> #3) explains that part of the <em>mitzvah</em> is the desire to spread the knowledge of Hashem in the world.

Gay activists, who started out to help those with SSA, have become as irrational and damaging as those who previously discriminated against homosexuals in the past. Although feeling SSA is not a choice, a person has the right to choose whether to attempt to deal with these feelings or not, and those who attempt to ban all counseling for unwanted SSA have become malicious agitators against free choice.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"http://drsorotzkin.com/light_on_gay_issue.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://drsorotzkin.com/light_on_gay_issue.html</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shedding Light on the Gay Issue</p>\n<p>Many people find it difficult to believe that there is not a shred of credible scientific evidence for the existence of the \"gay gene,\" since it flies in the face of what is presented as fact in our culture. There have been a few attempts by self identified gay scientists to present evidence of genetic contributions to homosexuality, but these endeavors have never withstood scientific scrutiny, a point that gay activist researchers now concede.1 Most people are unaware of the fact that gay rights advocates have often written in their internal documents that it advances their agenda to popularize the concept of a \"gay gene\" (regardless of the lack of scientific evidence).2</p>\n<p>The fact that overcoming SSA is indeed difficult and is often only achieved imperfectly is also cited as evidence of the unchangeable nature of sexual orientation thus making the apparent change not authentic. This claim is absurd! All psychological problems are difficult to change. Is it easy to help someone improve his self-esteem? Or to develop confidence? Or to overcome years of abuse? When the person makes progress, do we belittle his progress because he is still struggling? And if he improves with his issue 90%, do we not see this as a tremendous success even though vestiges of his problem remain? Why is the treatment of SSA held to such ridiculous and illogical and dramatically different standards than other areas of psychotherapy? Only because of a political agenda, it seems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_for_Research_&_Therapy_of_Homosexuality\" rel=\"nofollow\">NARTH</a> published in \"<a href=\"http://www.narth.com/menus/journal.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Journal of Human Sexuality</a>\" a landscape review of over 600 peer reviewed studies that supports the science that people can and do change sexual orientation.

The consensus among them (in opposition to the authorities cited in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16311/489\">@HodofHod's answer</a>) is that <strong>God cannot violate the rules of logic</strong>. This prevents such paradoxes such as the one you mentioned, as well as other like \"Can God assume physical form?\", \"Can God create another God?\", etc.</p>\n<p>Why does this not undermine God's omnipotence? Because saying that God cannot do X, where X is a logically impossible task, does not limit God's power any more than saying that a person cannot drink a Wednesday (h/t @DoubleAA) limits that person's power. The verb \"drink\" simply does not make sense with \"Wednesday\" as an object. Similarly, the verb \"do\" does not work with \"X\" as an object, if X is logically impossible. Here's how Saadia Gaon says it (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38322&st=&pgnum=54\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Emunos V'deos, Ch. 2</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואין היא משבחתו ומפארתו אלא בתבונה ומישרים, לא בגוזמא והבל כמי שעושה החמשה יותר מן העשרה מבלי הוסיף עליהם, שמכניס תבל בחללה של טבעת מבלי צמצם האחת והרחב השניה, שמחזיר אמש לקדמותו, שכל אלה הבל הם. אפשר ישאלונו כמה מן המינים באותו ענין. אנו משיבים להם הוא יכול לכל דבר ואלו מה ששאלו, לא דבר הוא, הבל הוא וההבל אינו ולא כלום</p>\n<p><em>His praises and His glorifications are only with understandable and upright things, not with exaggeration and absurdity such as \"He who can make five more than ten without adding to it\", or \"He who can fit the entire world into the hole of a ring without shrinking the former or enlarging the latter\", or \"He who can make the past into the future\", for all these things are absurdities. Perhaps several heretics will ask us about this.

Sometimes, however, it's not a philosopher asking the question, it's just some smart-aleck. But the smart-aleck also deserves an answer.

And He could even lift that rock that He cannot lift as well.\"</p>\n<p>That'll send 'em flying. And it's not untrue.

He writes (in my own very loose translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As was explained in the previous chapter, there's seemingly no basis for a requirement to fast imposed on those who saw a <em>sefer Tora</em> fall.… Nonetheless, many great <em>pos'kim</em> have required that not only those who saw the <em>sefer</em> fast but also others who pray in that synagogue and live there who were not even present. Let us examine the basis for this and what other <em>pos'kim</em> hold.</p>\n<p><em>Ikare Dinim</em> (<em>OC</em> 2:15, citing <em>S'de Haaretz</em> 3:31) has:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If he didn't drop it and didn't see it fall, but saw it on the ground, there's not even a custom to fast; one who does so should be blessed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>… <em>Olas Yitzchak</em> 67, after explaining the lack of basis for fasting altogether… adds at the end that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jews are holy and fast even if they saw the <em>sefer</em> fall from another.

He did require that they 'redeem' their fast with some nominal charity for the poor; and he did require a fast of the sexton or officer who could have set the <em>sefer</em> in place and closed the cabinet properly.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>What we get out of all this is that there's a great basis for not requiring any fast at all, not even as a mere stringency, of those who did not see the fall, even if they saw the <em>sefer Tora</em> on the ground. Also, even those who wrote that those stringent on themselves should be blessed wrote that only of those who saw the <em>sefer</em> on the ground in disgrace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

To be fair, Hebrew <em>does</em> have stops, and the Ba'alei Mesorah have encoded for us certain forced stops in certain syllables, but I believe this is proof of the natural inclination of Hebrew to follow this pattern: that is, the fact that we have certain places where rigidity is enforced shows that the language has a natural fluidity to it.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot speak for the author of the book you have studied, nor for other (more professional) opinions on the matter, but in most cases, especially as a student, when I have asked more advanced experts (both academic and religious, most times overlapping) on similar subjects, I've been pushed in the direction of allowing fluidity, rather than rigidity, in the pronunciation of Hebrew.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT:<br>\n*Unfortunately, I cannot recall from what text I took this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The difference of the plural ending is due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_(grammatical_number)#Biblical_and_Mishnaic_Hebrew\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the dual form</a>, which \"adds\" a syllable in the plural form in both modern and Biblical Hebrew. Thus nouns such as hands, ears, etc., have a dual form, since they are things that occur in pairs. In regard to Biblical Hebrew, Waltke and O'Connor (1990) note the following.

Moreover, the \"why\" question includes both the non-observant Jew's stated reasons and our (i.e. the religious community's) understanding of why he fails to observe, even if they are in conflict. Thus, the classic case of a \"<em>tinok sh'nishba</em>\" (\"captured child\"), referring to a Jew who was raised in a non-Jewish environment. Such a Jew may believe that his non-observance derives from a rejection of Judaism, but we may well conclude that his non-observance is simply the result of his environment.</p>\n\n<p>In general, the general thrust of most modern <em>poskim</em> (going back at least to the Chazon Ish) is to be very hesitant to exclude a non-observant Jew from his full status within the community.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rav Ettlinger in the Binyan Tzion suggests two ways of being inclusive of those who are not observant.

They said that their normal certification for normal kosher for passover for flour is only \"guarded\" from kneading as you've said. i asked what about the opinion that you can't use normal flour from the market since water might have come into contact with it at some point.

And that the mill has mashgachim there, and so it is always supervised until it reaches the matzah factory, and once it reaches the matzah factory it is guarded from kneading for the purpose of the mizvah of matzah. When i asked if he could tell me for sure the entire mill was a dry process he said he was not there so he could not say for sure. i asked him for the information of the mill or the mashgachim that were there so i could verify, and he said that information was confidential and could not be shared.

We no longer do these things and we treat a suicide as a regular death. On what basis is this done?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>First of all, I am not aware of any actual halachic source that states that a suicide is to be buried separately from the main Jewish cemetery. If anyone knows of a source for this, please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>In any event, while many of the halachos of mourning do not apply in the case of suicide (<em>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah</em> 345), this is only true if the person committed suicide in a psychologically stable state of mind. In the absence of strong evidence to the contrary, the assumption of the poskim is that a suicide was not psychologically stable (see <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%94#.D7.A1.D7.99.D7.9E.D7.9F_.D7.A9.D7.9E.D7.94_.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.94\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> there</a>).</p>\n\n<p>This might sound as if it was effectively nullifying the law, because <em>of course</em> no one commits suicide when they are in a psychologically stable state of mind. However, while that is basically true of our own society, there have been many societies in the past where suicide was considered an \"honorable\" act under certain circumstances (e.g. the samurai practice of <em>seppuku</em>). While the assumption that suicide is the result of a state of instability is valid in our culture, it would not necessarily be valid in others.</p>\n\n\n",

The same rule applies when the term אדון is used for mere human masters or rulers and the term אלהים is used for judges or other important people, too. </p>\n\n<p>The other half of the rule is that the prefixes מ,ש,ה do not supress the initial alef, and the alef keeps its vowel and is pronounced. </p>\n\n<p>There is a mnemonic for this rule:  משה מפיק וכלב מכניס, which Dr. Simon translates as \"Moshe speaks (the words of G-d) eloquently, and Calev brings (the people) in (to the Land of Israel).\" </p>\n\n<p>Dr. Simon does not provide any specific grammatical reason other than stating that this is the rule whenever the name of lordship with an initial alef is preceded by these particular prefixes. For this particular rule he references an unpublished lecture by M. Zanitsky (Dikduk Lectures) from 1989.    </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This rule applies not only to the lamed prefix, but also to vav, kaf, and bais. My understanding/conjecture is that the obscuring of the chataf in the Shem Hashem is to make clear that the patach under the prefix is not indicative of the definite article.</p>\n\n<p>To explain: The prefix ה generally serves as the definite article (\"the\") in Hebrew, but when there is another prefix (such as lamed) the ה is omitted, and instead the other prefix gets a patach (e.g. la-shulchan instead of l'ha'shulchan). Now, whenever any form of the definite article is used, it is implicit that the subject is not unique. For example, I may say that I am <em>the</em> Dave, which implicitly excludes all others who may call themselves Dave. But this is not appropriate when referring to Hashem, since he is One and unique. Using the definite article when referring to Hashem would be heretical (borderline, a least)!</p>\n\n<p>So, if one were to say la-ado-nai, it could be interpreted as meaning \"the Hashem,\" which we do not want to do, as explained above. Rather, we say la-do-nai, so that it is clear that the patach is serving merely as a grammatical replacement for a shva.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think this derives from the rule \"Moshe Motzi Kalev Machnis.\" </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the letters Mem Shin or Heh are used in the beginning of the\n  word, the following sound will be vocalized or will be brought out and\n  pronounced.

Moshe keeps it and\n  Kalev swallows. Doesn't rally mean anything, but the Hebrew phrase is\n  a mnemonic device, as follows. MOSHE MOTZI V'KALEV MACHNIS Here's what\n  it means. G-d's \"main\" Name, whether spelled YUD-KEI-VAV-KEI or\n  ALEF-DALET-NUN-YUD is pronounced ADONOI, the first letter being ALEF\n  with a CHATAF-PATACH under it. ELOKIM or any of its variations\n  (ELOKEINU, ELOKE- CHA, etc.) begin with ALEF with a CHATAF-SEGOL under\n  it. When one of these names has a prefix of a BET, HEI, KAF, LAMED,\n  MEM, or SHIN, sometimes the sound of the ALEF drops and sometimes it\n  doesn't. Specifically, with MEM, SHIN, or HEI, the ALEF's vowel\n  remains. That's the meaning of MOSHE MOTZI, with the letters of the\n  name MOSHE, the sound of the ALEF emerges. With VAV, KAF, LAMED, or\n  BET (letters of V'KALEV), the ALEF's vowel is swallowed - i.e.\n  dropped. Check out these examples: SHE-ADO...ASHERI H'AM SH'HASHEM\n  ELOKAV MEI-ADO... M'HASHEM YATZA HA'DAVAR but, BA-DO (not\n  B'ADO)...VA'YA'MINU BA'HASHEM and, LA-DO... MINCHA L'HASHEM The same\n  rule applies to \"master\" when not referring to HaShem.

[ילקוט יוסף שבת א' סי' רצג, ומהדורת תשס''ד עמוד תרטו.\nשארית יוסף ח''ג עמ' שצח].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Quick low-quality translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>b.</strong> The time in which the Shabbat ends is about 20 minutes after sunset throughout Israel. The ones that want to be more stern\n(~Lehachmir), don't do Melacha until about 30 minutes after sunset.\n[...] [end of halacha dropped by me]</p>\n<p><strong>c.</strong> However, it's appropriate and correct for every Gd-fearing person to be more stern (machmir) and not do <em>melacha</em> until reaching\n72 minutes (zmaniot) after our sunset, according to Rabbenu Tam's psak\nand its faction. And it's a great <em>mitzva</em> to publish it among\ntorah-learners. And even though the broad <em>minhag</em> everywhere is to be\nless stern (~lehakel) according to Geonim's psak, saying that 13\nminutes (zmaniot) after the sun isn't seen it is night, anyway it's\ngood and correct to be more stern (machmir) about it, since many\n<em>achronim</em> has ruled as Rabbenu Tam's psak, among which is the Shulchan Aruch, of which halachot we have accepted. Additionally, it is\nan <em>isur</em> punished with stoning. And all <em>machmirim</em> in the end of\nShabbat and Yom Tov will be blessed by Gd. And it's also appropriate\nto beware samely with <em>taanit</em> in the end of Yom Kippur, which is also\nforbidden by the Torah (De'oraita).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Yalkut Yossef rules that the Sephardim's minhag when Shabbat ends is like the Geonim's psak - against the Shulchan Aruch. R Yitzchak Yossef comments on that halacha that this is R Ovadia Yossef's psak as well.</p>\n<p>In Yalkut Yossef, Hilchot Mila (Sova Semchot B, p. 32, halacha 9), he rules:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ט.</strong> תינוק הנולד לשמונה, ואירע אונס שלא הספיקו למולו ביום השמיני עד ששקעה השמש, יש למולו מיד, בזמן בין בשמשות, ולא לדחות המילה למחרת,\nולבטל מצות עשה של \"וביום השמיני ימול בשר ערלתו\". ורשאים גם כן לברך כל\nברכות המילה. ואם עבר זמן \"בין השמשות\" והגיע \"צאת הכוכבים\", אין למולו,\nכי מילה פסולה, אלא יש לדחות המילה למחרת ביום. [ואין למולו גם בזמן בין\nהשמשות של רבינו תם].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Quick traslation again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>9.</strong> A baby that should be circumcised in the 8th day, and forcibly (~<em>ones</em>?) wasn't circumcised in the 8th day until sunset, should be\ncircumcised immediately, during <em>bein haShmashot</em>, and it shouldn't be\npostpone to the morrow, and thus reject the <em>mitzvat asseh</em> of \"וביום\nהשמיני ימול בשר ערלתו\". And it's also allowed to bless all of the\ncircumcision related blessings. And if bein haShmashot has passed and\nstars have risen (<em>tzet haCochavim</em>), it's forbidden to circumcise him\nat that time, since night-circumcision is invalid, so it then should\nbe postponed to the morrow. [and it's also forbidden to circumcise\nduring Rabbenu Tam's bein haShmashot].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last sentence, although in parentheses, is cited from Yalkut Yossef. It clearly rules that also regarding circumcision - the Sepharadim's minhag is like the Geonim.</p>\n<p>The Yalkut Yossef, in the abovementioned comment on Hilchot Shabbat, explains that the reason he (and his father) rules against the Shulchan Aruch is mainly because the Sepharadim's minhag was broadly accepted  <em>before</em> R Karo has published his book.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As a side-note, the Yalkut Yossef, in that same comment, mentions the halacha of the Shulchan Aruch about circumcision, but doesn't say anything about <em>stirah</em>. Also, he mentions <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%A9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Shalom Mashash</a> that rules as well like the Geonim.

Yishmael finds support for the idea that unmarried virgins don't need to cover their hair in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08b13.htm#19\">II Sam. 13:19</a>, ותקח תמר אפר על ראשה, by explaining אפר as \"a scarf\" - i.e., we see that Tamar began covering her head with one only after she was violated. (As the commentary Meir Ayin there notes, R.

As for a deeper reason behind the distinction, he suggests that since the requirement that women cover their hair is a consequence of Chavah's having misled her husband Adam into sinning (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=100b&format=pdf\">Eruvin 100b</a>), then it need not apply to a girl who has never had a husband.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>A requirement for a married woman to cover her hair, whether <em>d'oraysa</em> or <em>d'rabbanan</em>, is suggested by the fact that the kohein would uncover a sotah's hair (Kesuvos 72a). Hair is additionally considered an ervah when it is customarily kept covered. Since married women must cover their hair, the sight of this normally covered area is an ervah. For single women who do not and need not otherwise cover their hair, it is not (Bach, Even HaEzer 21:2).</p>\n\n\n",

The smicha exams are typically considered more theoretical than that of the Israeli rabbinate, which requires more memorization. Nonetheless, it would appear from this <a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/smicha-test\" rel=\"noreferrer\">discussion</a> that individuals from the States can take and pass his exam on issur v'heter by paper exam alone.</p>\n\n<p>Is this the case? Is a formal learning program (e.g., in yeshiva) required for this smicha? Also, does that discussion list his correct exam? It's the only such source I could find online of the exam... it appears from this <a href=\"http://wp.rabbiullman.com/publications/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">prep book</a> advertisement that R' Goldberg also gives smicha for Niddah as well as Issur v'Heter? How about Shabbat? Are there available exams for these? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 23)\n\n<p>Shalom u'Vracha,</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your interest in Sefer Iyunei Deah/Procedure for semicah by R. Z.N. Goldberg, shlita.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a standard response I prepared based on many people's questions. Not everything below may pertain to you, but hopefully your questions will be among those addressed. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in further information.</p>\n\n<p>I know that people who live outside of Israel do seek and receive semicha from the Rav.</p>\n\n<p>He generally requires at least one letter of recommendation from an established rabbi such as a Kehilla Rav, Rosh Yeshiva or Rosh Kollel saying, for example, that he knows the candidate, for how long and in what context while also attesting to the candidate's experience and seriousness in learning as well as his intentions for requesting the semicha and his plans for the future.</p>\n\n<p>Since getting semicha through him involves both a written and oral bachina, people may fax, mail or otherwise deliver the written bachina ahead of a planned visit to Jerusalem in order to allow time for the Rav to review it before meeting him for the oral bachina.</p>\n\n<p>The nature of the oral bachina depends on a person's stated purpose for wanting the semicha. For one who intends to go into chinuch or kiruv, the oral generally covers only some of the main points covered in the written. For those who are testing toward hora'ah and poskening, the oral is significantly more thorough and rigorous.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, one must test on an entire topic at once - like all of Isur v'Heter - melicha, basar b'chalav and ta'aroves - together.</p>\n\n<p>One planning a longer visit might do both (submit the written and make an appointment for the oral) while here. Perhaps there are other ways of doing it as well.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to contact him directly and speak to him in either Yiddish or Hebrew in order to finalize the procedure for your specific case.</p>\n\n<p>For the most up-to-date details regarding R. Goldberg's bachinos or other questions, you can call his home at 02 538 3162. His address is Elkana 12.</p>\n\n<p>B'hatzlacha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I am a personal Talmid Of Rav Goldberg Shlit\"a. I have been attending his Shiurim for over 8 years and had the pleasure of driving him over a 4 year period. He has also attended all of my family simchas (e.g. bris, wedding). We are very close. I have semicha from him as well, yet never advertised it. </p>\n\n<p>Readers should be aware that his semicha means absolutley nothing in any Jewish world. That is not to denounce Rav Goldberg's stature. He is, in my eyes, the Gadol Hador and we're in touch on a day to day basis. It's just that his semicha has become a real circus. There are those who don't even take the test; They present him with a recommendation from any rabbi that they learn seriously and then receive semicha. There is no oral test. These tests are given to students at their own will and many of them just copy out of other summary books. </p>\n\n<p>I am a witness to the fact that Rav Zalman Nechemia never checks the tests unless someone insists on it. (I saw this on at least 15 occasions.) </p>\n\n<p>The semicha used to be more serious but that's another issue and not for this forum. One might ask why would Rav Goldberg do such a thing? We've had long conversations about the issue and Rav Goldberg told me that from what he understands people just need some kind of certificate to teach or get a job but he never ever expects students to give psak or act as rabbis. </p>\n\n<p>Bottom line: it does not make anyone a proper rabbi. I also mentioned to him that there are those that misuse his semicha and he keeps telling me that he tries and should try to be more careful; of course any semicha can be used in dishonest ways. However there are individuals who purposely inquire about his semicha so they can pretend to be rabbis. I myself am in the middle of finishing the Israeli Rabbanut Semicha. There is no question that it is real and very serious: 6 tests, 6 hours apiece and each test has at least 10 S.A. questions.</p>\n\n<p>My post is not here to hurt anyone, just for people to be more careful and put things into proportion. In the end the most important thing is that Rav Zalman Nechemia Goldberg's image is not damaged. Unfortunately, in the last couple of years the semicha circus has not done my Rebbe any good or Am Yisrael any good.    </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I live in the U.S. and have Semicha from R' Zalman Nechemia, so I feel qualified to share my experiences. I will preface that Rabbi Yirmiyahu Ullman was a tremendous help in providing information and assistance in terms of preparation and getting in to a meeting with the Rav. His Sefer on Basar v'Chalav and Hilchos Niddah, <a href=\"http://wp.rabbiullman.com/publications/sefer-iyunei-deah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyunei De'ah</a>, is built around R' Goldberg's tests, and goes through the complete Sugyos far beyond what the test requires. Highly recommended for preparing for the test, as well as for thorough looks at some of the main Sugyos in Basar v'Chalav and Niddah. He also provides the official Semicha tests for <a href=\"http://wp.rabbiullman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3.-R-Z.N.-Goldberg-bachina-Nida-CR.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah</a> and <a href=\"http://wp.rabbiullman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2.-R-Z.N.-Goldberg-bachina-Isur-vHeter-CR.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Basar v'Chalav</a> right on his website.</p>\nIn terms of the actual Semicha test, I was required to come in person to meet with the Rav, after sending in my written test (72 questions on Basar v'Chalav, or 28 on Niddah. He has tests on other subjects available upon request, but you will probably need to have someone pick them up from his house). I happened to be visiting Eretz Yisrael at the time, so that was convenient enough. We met for around 20 minutes, during which he took a cursory look at my written test, and asked me a few questions about Hilchos Niddah. He also asked me whether I attended <a href=\"http://www.yctorah.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chovevei Torah</a>, since that is apparently a big impediment to receiving his Semicha. He did require sufficient \"haskamos\" (I brought two letters) from recognized Rabbi's, vouching on your Torah commitment and grasp of the material. He also asks what you intend to do with your Semicha (i.e. to Pasken, or just to be called a Rabbi for educational purposes etc.). I have heard from other Musmachim that if you tell him you intend to Pasken, he will question you more thoroughly. At that point he takes out the standardized Semicha document, and fills in the name, date and subject material you were tested on, then signs it and you're on your way. </p>\nI am sure everyone has a different experience with him, but that was mine.</p>\n\n\n",

If so, when does he resume being Satan?</li>\n<li>Why don't we laugh at other times that are auspicious for the coming of Moshiach?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10213/what-does-to-confuse-the-satan-mean\">this related question</a>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16397\">Adam Mosheh's answer</a>:</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara teaches (Beitzah 16a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: On Shabbos eve, the Holy One Blessed be He places an extra soul into a person, and on the morrow of Shabbos, they take it from him, as it says (Sh'mos 31:17), \"He rested and was refreshed (<em>shovas vayinafash</em>)\" - now that he has rested, woe, a soul is lost (<em>vai avda nefesh</em>)!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In fact, the purpose of the <em>b'samim</em> at <em>havdalah</em> is to attempt to revitalize the person after being weakened from suffering this devastating loss (Rashbam, Pesachim 102b, s.v. <em>uShmuel</em>) and/or enduring the \"stench of <em>Gehinnom</em>\" that is present on <em>motz'ei Shabbos</em> (Bach, Orach Chaim 297:1).</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara teaches that a sigh or groan (such as that suggested by the above quote from Beitzah 16a) weakens the spirit and \"breaks\" either half the body or the whole body (K'suvos 62a). Reish Lakish holds that fasts would not be declared for <em>motz'ei Shabbos</em> because people were weakened from having lost their extra soul and would be endangered by fasting (Ta'anis 27b). </p>\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi (B'rachos 2:6) teaches that the Satan prosecutes <em>bish'as hasakanah</em>. Perhaps we are therefore more susceptible to the Satan's prosecution on <em>motz'ei Shabbos</em>. The <em>minhag</em> of laughing during <em>havdalah</em> may serve to avert this possibility by convincing the Satan that we are not weakened after all.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Maybe because when shabbat ends it is a terrible thing in some sense. Shabbat is supposed to be eternal, but it ends, so k'veyachol it seems like Hashem is apparently no longer in charge of things. So we laugh in order to confuse the Satan, who would accuse us of having thought that Hashem was not in charge of the world. Because we are supposed to be happy always and recognize that Hashem is in fact in charge always. As proof to this, I can show you the ReM\"A, who says on the <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">first siman</a> of O\"C <em>shiviti hashem lenegdi tamid</em>, and on the <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow\">final siman</a> (hilchot purim) <em>v'tov lev mishteh tamid</em>.  If we do not confuse him, then he will testify against us that we did not believe that really Hashem is He Who is in charge of this world, and that we are happy despite something happening that is seemingly bad.</p>\n\n<p>It is a tefillah that Eliyahu should come.  He doesn't actually come every week at havdalah, AFAIAA.</p>\n\n<p>Who says that only sefaradim should laugh during havdalah?</p>\n\n<p>Maybe why we don't laugh at other times that are auspicious for the coming of Moshiach is because then we should be hopeful and not joyous.  I'm not sure about part 3 of the question.  Sorry.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I believe this is related to the concept of the importance of laughter in dealing with sad or difficult situations as embodied by Rebbi Akiva. As shabbat leaves it is a sad time; laughter is our way of showing that we are taking a broader view and that we know that 'az yimaleh s'chok pinu', eventually we will be able to laugh with full abandon. This ability, which confused even the sages of Rebbi Akiva's age, fully confounds the Satan whose entire tactic is to make man focus on immediate gratification.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do we cover the challot on Shabbos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The answer I learned growing up was that \"we don't want to embarrass the bread because we are first making kiddush\" or some variation thereof. I later learned that is a zecher for the ma'n which fell with a coating on top and bottom. Where does that first answer come from? And, if it is a legitimate source, what does it really mean (ie bread doesn't have feelings!)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14265&pgnum=455\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tur (OC 271)</a> here brings three reasons why we cover the challah.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1) To establish that the meal is coming because of the kiddush. The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=100b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pesachim 100b</a>) quotes a braita that says one shouldn't bring the \"table\" out until after kiddush because, according to the Shi'iltot (#54), we want to show that the kiddush is defining the meal. Tosafot there comments that this only applies in the times of the Talmud where each member at a meal had his own table; now that it is a big hassle to bring out the entire table after kiddush, we cover the challah to pretend it's not there and after kiddush we \"bring it out\" to the table. Essentially, we want the meal to not start until after kiddush.</li>\n<li>2) To avoid embarrassment. The Tur quotes a Yerushalmi (which is not found in our editions of the Talmud) that we don't want the bread to be embarrassed; however he qualifies what he means. In general when faced with foods of different brachot, we first say the bracha on the species that comes first in the list of the Seven Species of Israel, so we would usually say the HaMotzi on the bread (wheat) before the HaGafen on wine (grapes). But since we want to say kiddush before eating bread, we have a halakhic dilemma of precedence. So, the Yerushalmi suggests covering the challah to hide it while we drink the wine first. It seems to me that the any literal feeling bad for the bread's feelings is a later, homiletic interpretation of the Yerushalmi's rule. (I note that the earliest I have found this understanding is in the Mordechai Tosefet Pesachim 611, although he doesn't mention it in the name of the Yerushalmi.)</li>\n<li>3) To commemorate the manna. The midrash (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=6&daf=75b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoma 75b</a>) says that the manna that fell in the dessert was encased on both sides by a layer of dew. Thus, the Tur suggests (and this is also mentioned in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=100b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosfot Pesachim 100b</a>) that we cover the challah on both sides with a cloth to commemorate the manna. Note that some wonder why we commemorate the manna on shabbat when no manna fell. A possible answer is that since we are using lechem mishna to commemorate the double portion of manna that fell on Friday, we continue the commemoration through the covers. However, not all are impressed with the answer, although the Aruch HaShulchan notes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9101&pgnum=94\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 271:22</a>) that the common practice in eastern Europe was to follow this rule.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some practical differences emerge from this discussion.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1) Bottom layer. As mentioned above, only according to the opinion of the manna does one need a bottom layer.</li>\n<li>2) Duration. For the embarrassment reason it would seem to be sufficient to cover the challah until after kiddush (or potentially until after Borei Peri HaGafen.) For the tables reason, possible until after one washes (potentially only until after one drinks the wine.) For the manna reason, possibly even until after the blessing of HaMotzi.\nFrom the other side, for the table reason, one should make sure to cover the bread as soon as it is put out. For the other two it is sufficient to cover it before kiddush.</li>\n<li>3) Kiddush on Bread. Only for the manna reason would it make sense to cover the bread if one is making kiddush on bread (ie. if he had no wine).</li>\n<li>4) Importance. Arguably, according to the tables reason, covering the bread is only a secondary solution and it might be better to not even take out the bread until after kiddush. (The Shi'itot noted above in fact implies that covering is only a bedieved solution.)</li>\n<li>5) Perhaps the biggest difference regards what needs to be covered. According to the manna reason, only the challah needs to be covered. According to the embarrassment reason, any food whose blessing precedes that of wine (HaMotzi and Mezonot) needs to be covered. According to the tables reason, any food at all that is part of the meal should be covered.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

In the Temple, when the <em>kohein gadol</em> would pronounce the <em>shem ham'forash</em>, the people would respond by uttering this line (Yoma 66a).</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara explains this practice as follows (ibid, 37a): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It was taught in a <em>B'raisa</em>: Rebbi said: \"When I call out the Name of HaShem, ascribe greatness to our Lord\" (D'varim 32:3). Moshe said to Israel: \"When I utter the Name of the Holy One Blessed be He, you ascribe greatness [to Him].\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In fact, this, rather than <em>amen</em>, was always the standard response in the Temple because that is the only place where the <em>shem havayah</em> was uttered (Tosefta B'rachos, 6:22; Sifsei Chachamim, D'varim 32:3). According to the Tosefta, the use of this specific formulation is alluded to in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt35b09.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nechemya 9:5</a>, where the Levites said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‏…קוּמוּ בָּרְכוּ אֶת-יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵיכֶם, מִן-הָעוֹלָם עַד-הָעוֹלָם; וִיבָרְכוּ שֵׁם כְּבֹדֶךָ…‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Midrash states that Moshe Rabbeinu ascended to heaven and observed the angels praising HaShem with this specific formulation (D'varim Rabba, 2:36; <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14268&st=&pgnum=524\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tur, Orach Chayyim 619</a>).

The A.R. does not bring in kavanaos like Sephardic Siddurim ie: Kavana Shem HaVayeh Adon HaKol, Haya Hayu Hoveh etc. This gives the most seasoned Kabbalist down to the simplest Jew the ability to use a siddur that follows the Arizal's opinion. Then you have the A.R.'s Siddur Im'Dach (Siddur with Chassidus) that will have a 5 page mammar between Shema Yisroel and Baruch Shem (This siddur isnt meant to daven from). </p>\n\n\n",

So it is saying that the Shechina should bless.</p>\n\n<p>3) The Malbim that says that this refers to protection in exile, where he was speaking in exile in Egypt where Hashem's presence would not be felt in a revealed way, he is asking that the blessing through more natural, hidden means should accompany them in exile.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Kehot Chumash <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/805760/jewish/Interpolated-Translation.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">interpolated translation</a> brings an interesting reading, that I have never seen explicitly (and their own footnotes don't source it), but it reads this verse with the preceding one as one unit, like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>15 <strong>He blessed Joseph and said, \"May God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,</strong> the <strong>God who has been my shepherd from my earliest days until this day,</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>16 and has always sent me <strong>the angel who delivers me from all harm, bless the lads.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The bold is the translation of the actual words, the not bold is the interpolation. According to that reading (which fits very nicely with the Or Hachaim in the sense that the Or Hachaim wouldn't add the interpolated words, but would see the \"Malach\" as a continuation of the previous two mentions of \"Elokim\" in the previous verse all referring to some aspect of G-d), and certainly doesn't contradict Rashi or the Ibn Ezra (I don't remember the Ramban)), the angel isn't asked to bless at all, the Sender of the angel is.</p>\n\n\n",

The Zohar notes that the difference is that a square is something that \"sits\" in place without rolling around; it thus represents a level of Divinity that, even though it is \"sealed\" and beyond our ken, relates to our world and \"enclothes\" it. A circle (and the letter samech), by contrast, symbolizes an aspect of Hashem's energy that is beyond even the \"chain of [spiritual] evolution\" <em>(seder hishtalshelus)</em> that results in the various creations, physical and spiritual.</p>\n\n<p>He also cites Emek Hamelech, that the underlying reason for this difference is that a square, with its four sides, is related to the four-lettered Name of Hashem (which in both form and meaning represents His creative energy).</p>\n\n<p>Based on all of this, we might speculate that the squares and cubes in the Mishkan/Beis Hamikdash, and more generally in halachah, are meant to evoke this idea: they represent, and help us draw down into our world, that \"enclothing\" level of Divinity that is sourced in Hashem's Name.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a lot to unpack here kabbalistically but to give a very basic answer to your question repetition mathematically, linguistically or conceptually is a sign of emphasis in Judaism.

I'm less concerned with the technicalities than the similarities between these two.  (Also note that these are the leynings from both days of Rosh Hashannah and Yom Kippur.)</p>\n\n<p>Why do we mimic Abraham's fathering?

Soroh’s prophetic vision was that the continuation of the Jewish people should be through Yitzchok separated from Yishmoel reminiscent of mode (2). Binding Yitzchok to the altar was, I suggest, symbolic of bringing Yitzchok near to the service of HaShem in the same way as an offering brings the giver <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/global/popup/default_cdo/aid/1478/jewish/The-Offered-Beast.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">close to HaShem</a> . </p>\n\n<p>In this way, you could make a case that “the Yom Kippur service seems to reeenact Avrohom’s treatment of his sons.” </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I suggest that the analogy drawn in the painting may be inaccurate.

The goat was for atonement. {6:2} There was neither confession nor atonement associated with the sending away of Ishmael. </p>\n\n<p>(4) The other goat (the \"Isaac\" one) was <strong>actually</strong> slaughtered and its blood sprinkled.{4:3}. </p>\n\n<p><em>Ishmael was about to die of thirst when an angel showed his mother a well, repeating to her at the same time that Ishmael would become a great nation.</em> (5) As you note in the question the goat was to die. {6:6}. I think we should consider the importance of the Mishnah as well as the Biblical text. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The two goats of Yom Kippur show us that we are not that productive. We cause death and waste alongside our accomplishments. We're not perfect.</p>\n<p>Abraham and Sarah were finished with Ishmael. Ishmael's purpose was fulfilled. So they send him to the wilderness. Almost as if Ishmael is considered waste. Abraham and Sarah are throwing Ishmael away - they are done with him.</p>\n<p>Look at Leviticus chapter 15, the chapter before Leviticus 16 describing the Yom Kippur ritual. Emissions of semen and menstrual blood go to \"waste\" and they are considered major pollutants of the Tabernacle. Spilled semen and menstrual blood are life force that go to waste, they aren't used. They are wasted potential. Hence why I'm seeing the goat to Azazel as wasted potential that's sent to the wilderness.</p>\n<p>The male genitalia doesn't serve entirely as a tool of insemination (procreation/consecration/Isaac), it also serves as waste disposal (waste/impurity/Ishmael). It crosses anatomical function in a certain way. Insemination and waste disposal become mixed. The distinction of them disappears in a way.</p>\n<p>Abraham performs the Yom Kippur ritual with his two sons, after he is the first man to be circumcised in the Torah. Circumcision is the lifting of a veil. The lifting of a veil necessitates closer examination of the organ itself and the implications of it, as you see above.</p>\n\n\n",

Between 2000 and 2010 he changed all his cutlary, plates, etc. so that nothing that he owns is from the original \"treifed\" up cutlary. </p>\n\n<p>However, Ashkenazim say that there is a halacha called Chaticha Naaseh Neveila Bshaar Issurim - which means that if kosher food absorbed from treif food, the kosher food becomes inherently not-kosher (not that it is a kosher article becomes forbidden to eat because it has not-kosher taste, but that <strong>it becomes trief</strong>, and when a piece of that kosher food falls into another pot of kosher, it needs sixty times the newly-unkoshered food).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, many are of the opinion that taste within the walls also become Chanan (Chaticha Naaseh Neveila).</p>\n\n<p>So now, if the person cooked the not-kosher dish in a pot, that pot became treif. He turned around and washed that pot in a Yad-Soledes-Bo kiluach which was not nifsach, so other plates became treif too. That should now spread from plate to plate forever.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Nosein Taaam Lifgam (or the twelve months heter) doesn't apply here, as each time the hot water landed on the pot, it becomes treif inherently and the 24 hour count starts again.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a limit to how far Chanan goes?</p>\n\n<p>PS.\n<strong>Not <a href=\"http://daf-yomi.com/DYItemDetails.aspx?itemId=8665\" rel=\"nofollow\">everyone</a> agrees with the Shulchan Aruch, who holds that soap is Nosein Taam Lifgam.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As far as I understand this whole question is theoretical — on many counts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Once it is eino ben yomo, the bleeyos are pagum and can not assur something else, even though its cooking will make the plate itself back into a ben yomo lchatchila.</li>\n<li>Once 12 months have elapsed from use according to Chacham Tzvi and Node Byehuda (see Pischei Teshuva YD 93) the bleeyos are completely dead they can not assur anything else.</li>\n<li>It's very not obvious to say chanan by keilim — and even if you do, it can not spread without a real bishul.</li>\n<li>Who says a kiluach can transfer taam? — See YD 95, 4 & 5 at length — kiluach can only assur kdei klipah and only at the same time of kosher and treif together being hit by the exact same stream.</li>\n<li>Many authorities (Maharash Engel) hold that connecting pipes make the connecting only a klei sheini — and Rav Elyashiv explicitly paskens this way.

In the very next paragraph after the discussion of washing dishes, the Shulchan Aruch says that if ashes are added to the boiling water, then it prevents the transfer of taste – even by meat and dairy dishes at the same time! In other words – no harm no foul! Shouldn’t I be able to rely on this? Aren’t ashes equivalent to soap?”</p>\n<p>Before we get to soap, the ashes issue is not so clear cut. For while the leniency of ashes is correct according to the Shulchan Aruch and other poskim who defend him, many authorities, most notably the Shach and Taz, maintain that there is no valid basis for such a ruling, and as such disagree with his hetter. Due to the staunch opposition to the Shulchan Aruch’s reasoning, some authorities endorse the hetter exclusively in extenuating and difficult circumstance or in case of great financial loss. It would seem thatin accordance with this, one should not rely on this for a dishwasher l’chatchila.</p>\n<p><strong>Soapy Surprise:</strong>\nYet, the Yad Efraim, the Pri Megadim and other decisors qualify the issue. They maintain that this whole machlokes is only about mixing ashes into the boiling water. They explain that the dissenters are of the opinion that ashes do not do an adequate job of imparting repulsive and utterly inedible taste (rendering pagum). [If you think about it, it makes sense. We eat bread and eggs dipped into ashes on Erev Tisha B’Av without too many side effects.] On the other hand, since “our soap” does a much better job of it, as it most definitely is stronger and better at cleaning than ashes, everyone would agree that it has the ability to prevent the infusion of meat and milk taste to each other, thus averting any possible kashrus problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Chazon Ish (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14334&st=&pgnum=77\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 23:1</a>) actually held that one may kasher lchatchila with our paguming agents — bleach etc. — (and not like R Moshe who held only bshaas hadchak) even by ben yomo!</p>\n<p>Therefore, I am doubtful as to the author's question, as it does not seem feasible at all to treif up one's entire kitchen from this issue of theoretical chanan.</p>\n\n\n",

Why is there a difference if he gets this pain down here or in the world to come? </p>\n\n<p>The only difference should be the time \nMoreover, even if you can say \"a million pains at once is harder to deal with than one\", that should be taken into account when calculating the punishment.</p></li>\n<li><p>Moreover, if Gehenom is in reality qualitatively harsher, then it seems not fair that a wicked person should have to suffer more than a Tzaddik would for the same act.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>the shaar bitachon ch.4 says that the reward of olam haba is purely a kindness of God. on his own merits no man deserves it due to receiving so much benefits from God in this world. Here's an excerpt.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The reason for this, is that even if a man's good deeds are numerous\n  like the sand of the seashore, it would not weigh enough to cover even\n  one favor the Creator had bestowed on him in this world. All the more\n  so, if he has committed any sins, because if the Creator will hold a\n  man strictly to account for his obligation of gratitude, all of his\n  good deeds would be cancelled and wiped out by even the smallest favor\n  the Creator has done for him, and that which the Creator owes him will\n  not amount to anything. Hence, that which the Creator rewards a person\n  for his good deeds is to be regarded as a Divine grace to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God can therefore choose who to bestow this kindness to since no one really deserves it anyways.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we can say similarly for gehinom. Every sin deserves gehinom. If one pleases God, then God can choose to bestow special kindnesses on him and spare him from gehinom.</p>\n\n<p>not fair - maybe. but we can't say it's unjust.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You are forgetting that the concept of \"time\" doesn't pertain to the spiritual world. I do know that it says a rasha doesn't stay in gehinnom longer than 12 months. However, in Bava Basra 74a it relates a story about the amora R' Nachman. He was walking in the desert, and an arab showed him a crack in the ground where Korach was swallowed up, and when he put his ear to the ground he heard them say \"Moshe is true and his Torah is true, and we are liars\". So why was Korach still burning up many years after he died?\nWhatever time may mean in the spiritual world, we know it is something we can’t relate to. The Torah speaks on our terms. We don’t know what spiritual pain is. We don’t know how God calculates punishment.\nOne must know what he doesn’t know. However, there is something that I understand about God’s ways of rewarding and punishing that I think may help you. God is not human. He does not feel pain, as He is perfect and can have no deficiencies. God does not feel angry or sad or depressed or happy. When the Torah refers to God’s middos, it means that God is <em>acting</em> with those middos, he is taking the course of action that a human being would take in the case that a human being would be feeling that midda. More simply, if I were upset at someone, I would punish him. When God is “upset”, he would use the midda of “upset” and takes a retaliatory course of action.\nI think that even more than that, reward and punishment are perhaps what we would call a consequence. Just as the consequence for dropping a glass on concrete is a smashed glass, the consequence for doing an aveira is punishment. God mercifully delays punishment and pushes it off with chesed and rachamim in hopes that the human will do teshuva, but once someone dies he has no option to do teshuva. (That may be a partial answer to why getting punished in this world is “a better deal”. God may lessen a punishment to give the recipient the ability to perform better in another area at that time.) If getting punished is a self directed consequence, God’s involvement would be only to “lessen” the punishment. A rasha doesn’t deserve extra “lessening”.</p>\n\n<p>On another note, I have another idea as to what reward and punishment in the next world are.\nIn spirituality, there is no space. There is no near or far. So what do we mean when we say “closer to God”?\nClose in a spiritual sense means more relatable, or more similar. When someone correctly uses the middos that God uses, such as kind and mercy, he becomes more similar, or “closer”, to God. When someone uses middos that are the opposite of God’s way, such as evil or destructive, he becomes less similar, or “further”, from God. The gan eden and gehinnom that we refer to in the next world may be the neshamas experience of being closer or further from God. That’s a direct consequence of your actions in this world. The pain or regret the neshama feels of being further from God is not “punishment” and “reward”. It is a direct consequence of your actions. Keep in mind that the next world is forever. If you’re far from God in some way, it’s for eternity. Time doesn’t pass or stay put. It is simply unconstrained by the concept of time as we are. And you can’t fix it. So you’re stuck with your deficiency forever. That is something you directly did yourself, and God will not change consequence. That’s how God runs this world. He has rules. (I’m not claiming to know the slightest amount about how God runs this world. I am only relating a perception.) Perhaps also when one gets punished in this world, he changes himself, his neshama, and therefore a miniscule amount of pain on this world can cause an enormous change in his neshama that translates into a closeness to God.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sorry for the lack of sources. This is a view that I formed throughout life, and I don’t know much knowledge about anything. But this idea seems to concur with the hashkafa I’ve learnt, and it reverberates strongly within me. I don’t claim to know anything, I just wish to share my feelings.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In addition to doing mitzvos, people also have a special mission. E.g. the samson's mission was to kick Philistine butt.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps giving people the full amount of pains they deserve will interfere with their ability to fulfill this special mission in life.</p>\n\n<p>This situation is more common for wicked people so they tend to need \"after hours\" punishment more than righteous people would.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does M'nachos 61:2 have only three of six kal vachomer arguments?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Bavli</em>, <em>M'nachos</em> 61:2, quotes the <em>tana</em> Rabbi <em>Shim'on</em> (in my own loose translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Three types [of offering] have three commands to them [all told]: each has two, but not the third. They are personal <em>sh'lamim</em>, communal <em>sh'lamim</em>, and a <em>m'tzora</em>'s <em>asham</em>. Personal <em>sh'lamim</em> requires leaning while it's alive and waving once it's slaughtered, but not waving while it's alive. Communal <em>sh'lamim</em> requires waving while it's alive and once slaughtered but no leaning. A <em>m'tzora</em>'s <em>asham</em> requires leaning and waving while alive, but no waving once slaughtered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>g'mara</em> then tries to derive that the third rule, the one that doesn't apply to each type of offering, should apply to it. How? By <em>kal vachomer</em> (argument a fortiori). The argument in each case goes like this: Offering A lacks command X but has command Y, so offering B, which has X, should, a fortiori, have Y. For example, communal <em>sh'lamim</em> lacks leaning but has waving while still alive, so personal <em>sh'lamim</em>, which has leaning, should a fortiori have waving while it's alive. And in each case the <em>g'mara</em> refutes the argument.</p>\n\n<p>There are six possible such arguments, for the six possibilities of values for \"A\" and \"B\". (Any offering can be \"A\", and any other can be \"B\".) Yet the <em>g'mara</em> only goes through three of these: where \"A\" is the personal <em>sh'lamim</em> and \"B\" the communal (whose refutation I outline below), where \"A\" is the communal <em>sh'lamim</em> and \"B\" the personal (whose refutation is a <em>pasuk</em> that proves live waving can't be extended by derivation from \"A\" to other offerings), and where \"A\" is the personal <em>sh'lamim</em> and \"B\" the <em>m'tzora</em>'s <em>asham</em> (whose refutation is a <em>pasuk</em> that proves slaughtered waving can't be extended by derivation from \"A\" to other offerings).

Your question had been why we don't turn to Asham Metzora and ask why we don't pose a similar Kal V'chomer from there; presumably the Gemara would say that we've already found a specific exclusion for it, and Asham Metzora wouldn't help.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara then addresses Shalmei Tzibbur and attempts to learn it from Shalmei Yachid. As you pointed out in your question, this part of the Gemara reads just fine; once we've said it's a Halacha L'Moshe MiSinai, learning from Asham Metzora is a waste of time.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Gemara addresses the Asham Metzora and tries learning it from Shalmei Yachid, to which it responded, similar to what it did in its first Kal V'chomer, that we have a drashah of \"Oso,\" to the exclusion of the Asham Metzora. Like above, you could probably answer that once we've found a specific exclusion for it, another Kal V'chomer wouldn't help.</p>\n\n\n",

In 1264, Pope Clement IV \n  set the penalty of death on whatsoever person should \n  harbor a copy of the Talmud in his house.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>The printing of the Talmud began as early as 1494 in \n  Soncino. The luckless book was still under the ban of \n  the papal and imperial interdicts, and even when, thanks \n  to the untiring efforts of influential Jews and Christians, \n  fortified by offers of bribes more or less open and direct, \n  permission to print was granted (by Pope Leo X, in 1520), \n  it was so guarded and restricted as to make a complete \n  and accurate edition an impossibility.</p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>That the permission granted by Leo X did not secure \n  immunity from persecution, we learn from the fact men- \n  tioned before, that autos-da-fe, were renewed at intervals \n  from 1533 to 1599. In fact, when, in 1564, at the \n  Council of Trent, the Italian Jews petitioned for \n  permission to republish the Talmud, the license granted \n  was, in spite of a vast amount of Jewish money in the \n  pockets of the Bishops, still more restrictive. Even the \n  title Talmud was to be omitted. We do not find, how- \n  ever, that the Italian printing houses availed themselves \n  of this dubious mercy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But if it's in a place that witnesses are not prevalent, then he should swear that [what occurred] is what he said. They draw out in his oath that he did not breach his duty of watching and but watched it as watchmen do and that he did not (prior to [the theft or loss]) use the object (for if he did he'd be liable even in a case of total accident).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually, I think the oath also includes that it's no longer in his possession. In any event, all these rules have many details that I'm not including. (Chapters 291–302 are all about an unpaid watchman.)</p>\n<p><em>Rama</em> adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But some hold that even if there are eyewitnesses to the fact that the item was stolen or lost, he must swear he did not breach his duty and they draw out in his oath that he did not use the object. But if there are witnesses that he did not breach his duty, then he need not swear that he did not use the object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(<em>S'ma</em> :5 offers an explanation for the last point: We don't really suspect him of committing such a terrible misdeed as to use the object.)</p>\n<p>Further in 294, <em>SA</em> continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[:5] If the bailee [=watchman] stipulated he'd be exempt from an oath, that stipulation stands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nowadays, my understanding is, Jewish courts are very loath to allow anyone to take an oath. I would not be surprised if they considered there to be automatic stipulation that the watchman be exempt from an oath, but I have not heard that that's the case. Perhaps someone else can answer with a more modern understanding of these issues. In any event, such an oath would be taken only if administered in a Jewish court.</p>\n<p><em>Aruch Hashulchan</em> 294:7 adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One can wonder whether, if the matter occurred in a place that eyewitnesss are prevalent, he must bring witnesses [to be exempt]. Did [the bailor] not exempt him from that [by stipulation, but only from an oath], or, since the eyewitnesses stand in place of an oath, perhaps since he needs to take no oath he also needs no witnesses. This requires further investigation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The conveyance of Tumas maga happens irrespective of your clothes, which are considered batel to your body.</p>\n\n<p>The issue regarding yayn nesech is its use for sacrament. How would gloves interfere in any way with the non-Jews ability to use this wine? It doesn't. Which would mean that the wine is just as assur as if he touched it with his hands directly.

A person isn't even allowed to hand objects to their wife while she is in niddah (it's one of the harchakos) or sleeping in the same bed even if they aren't touching. Even more so is actually touching each other \"through\" an object not allowed.</p>\n\n<p>If you're asking on a de'oraysa level with niddah, then answer this - can you touch her through her clothes while she's wearing them \"derech chibbah?\" Pretty sure that's a straight \"no.\" A glove wouldn't be any different - it's just adding another layer to feeling each other. The Rambam makes clear that touching ANY niddah woman in a pleasurable manner is a d'oraysa violation, and one that may make you subject to malkus (machlokes on whether it's all women or only certain ones). <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960669/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Twenty-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Issurei Bi'ah 21:1)</a></p>\n\n<p>For muktzeh, we see that you are not allowed to lean up against a small tree since you are moving the branches by doing so.

We get around this issue on shabbos by moving with a shinui or indirectly by moving a permitted object, but we DON'T permit you to wrap your hand in a napkin and move the object normally.</p>\n\n<p>Gloves in a mikvah WOULD constitute a chatzitzah because the standard we apply to tevilah is far and away more chamur than any other instance. Even though loose clothing would technically be permitted in a mikvah, the accepted practice is that even that is avoided. In general, the balance of halachic literature would seem to treat gloves, clothes, etc. as a default negiah lechumra but NOT lehakel (like in mikvah).</p>\n\n<p>If anyone can think of a case where a gloved hand would be any different than either a) your hand touching a clothed body or b) your clothed body touching a bare object, please leave me a comment.</p>\n\n\n",

While this is not unusual, the student seemed intent on getting this person to put on Tefillin, and persisted in \"encouraging\" (really more like badgering and harrassing - much more than I expected to see or have seen before) after he'd declined more than once. But what struck me even more, was that the student then turned to me, after his own prodding had failed, and asked me to encourage my new acquaintance in this effort. Then, after I responded, \"to each his own,\" (really in order to diffuse the situation and not because I am against Kiruv), the student looked betrayed.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I don't think the student engaged in a successful strategy, nor was his tact very pleasant. But the fact that he then asked me to pressure someone to do what he wanted him to do, despite the fact that the subject had already expressed disinterest and even discomfort, surprised me greatly.</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong></p>\n<p>In an age in which personal boundaries are regularly blurred (see social media, for example), religious freedom is a political wedge issue, and news coverage about bullying and peer pressure is nonstop, <strong>what do contemporary rabbinic leaders say about exerting social pressure on others to observe Mitzvoth?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Not a contemporary source, and not discussing social pressure, but in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=86&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ketubot 86A-</a>86B it discusses pressuring someone to fulfill a positive commandment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ל תנינא במה דברים אמורים במצות לא תעשה אבל במצות עשה כגון שאומרין לו עשה סוכה ואינו עושה לולב ואינו עושה מכין אותו עד שתצא נפשו</p>\n<p>(R' Pappa) said to (R' Kahana), \"We learned that discussion was only regarding a negative commandment.

See <a href=\"http://www.neveh.org/price/priceqa2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this explanation</a> quoted below. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rambam (Hilchos Gittin) also points out that deep down inside, a\n  person wants to do what the Torah wants, despite what he might say to\n  the contrary.</p>\n  \n  <p>In Hilchos Gittin (1:1) the Rambam states that \"“If a person is forced\n  to give a divorce it is invalid. Even if he was forced to say \"I want\"\n  it's nevertheless considered forced and is invalid.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rambam later on (2:20) says that \"If however a person is\n  halachically required to divorce his wife (e. g. she committed\n  adultery) and he refuses to divorce her, then beis din can use\n  physical force. They hit him until he says \"I want\" and then the\n  divorce is valid.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rambam asks why isn't this considered forced and invalid?</p>\n  \n  <p>He explains, \"One is not considered forced unless it is to do\n  something that he is not required by the Torah... However, one who's\n  Yetzer Haro is overpowering him not to do a Mitzvah or to do an\n  aveirah and he is forced to do the Mitzvah or not to do the aveirah is\n  not considered forced. Rather he wanted to force himself with his evil\n  views to do the opposite.</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, this fellow who (is obligated but) doesn't want to divorce\n  his wife, he (really) wants to be part of Klal Yisroel - he wants to\n  do all the Mitzvos and refrain from the aveiros and it's just his\n  Yetzer Haro which is overpowering him. When he is hit till his Yetzer\n  Haro is weakened (knocked out of him) and he says \"I want\" that is\n  considered divorcing with his volition.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The conditions of this case are very different (eg there is no-one other than the subject affected by his decision and there may be an issue of embarrassing a fellow-Jew in public) but it <strong><em>could be</em></strong> that social pressure is really no different and if pressured in the right way, this person might say about putting on tefillin \"I want\".</p>\n\n\n",

In addition, this has been mentioned multiple times in connection to the debate over homosexuality, particularly homosexual marriage, and always in a negative light. (<em>That</em> is a tangential discussion and is only marginally relevant to this question.) However, I have heard that this practice actually <em>protected</em> the woman as she would now have someone legally responsible for her.</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is: what's the point? Why institute this law?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 58)\n\n<p>And the other critical caveat here: this is <em>only if she wants him to marry her.</em> If she'd rather never see him again, then the Torah never forces her into such a marriage. Additionally, if she wants a divorce, she is still entitled to one whenever she wants even after they wed. (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9728&st=&pgnum=238\">Shulchan Aruch Even HaEzer 177:3</a>)</p>\n\n<p>All I can say -- if this is a situation where she'd be interested in being married to him -- is the Torah was likely discussing a situation of someone who just got their lust out of control. Criminologists will tell you that most rapists today do it out of hatred for women. It seems the Torah wasn't addressing that type of sicko. I've discussed this point with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_J._Twerski\">Rabbi Dr. Abraham Twerski</a> (I was arguing that the <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2823.htm\">warnings against excessive drinking in Proverbs</a> still don't sound like a full-blown alcoholic as we know it today), who pointed out the Gemara (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h35.htm\">end of Sotah</a>) says the world's been in a state of decline since the destruction of the Temple, and conceded that the world we know today just seems <em>sicker</em> mentally than that of the Torah/Talmud.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 40)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_ha-Chinuch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The <em>Chinuch</em></a> says <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49220&pgnum=284\" rel=\"noreferrer\">(in 557)</a> it's a deterrent. Knowing they'll have to marry their potential victims (and won't be allowed to divorce them, and have to support them, etc.), people won't rape.</p>\n\n<p>He adds (ibid.) that it's also a protection for the victim: once she's married she's unlikely to be raped again. (Numerous studies show that a woman who was raped is at greater risk of being raped again.)(But see Alex's and my comments on this answer.)</p>\n\n<p>However, note that he lists these as \"among the roots\" of this command: in the end, it (like any of God's commands) is because God said so, and we can't fathom the wisdom of it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>From a historical perspective one has to understand a few things.</p>\n\n<p>One: We live in a time of such safety and ease that our ancestors would not be able to fathom it. Cities used to have walls, because entire villages and cities were always at risk of rape and pillaging. Avraham Avinu consistantly told people Sarah was his sister for fear people would murder him to take his wife, because to according to ancient world laws, it was a greater offense to sleep with someones wife than to kill someone if that person was an outsider. And so if you wanted to sleep with his wife, it your best bet was to kill him, THEN sleep with her.</p>\n\n<p>Two: We live in a time where women have freedoms, resources, and respect that the ancient world could have never dreamed. Without getting into a huge debate about it, women were basically considered financial burdens in the ancient world. They had to always be kept inside and protected for fear someone will see them, take them, rape them, and then move on. They were almost never allowed to go to work. Father's paid other men dowry's to marry their daughters to incentivize someone taking her off his hands, so that she could be supported by someone else. And if that husband died, then the eldest male child would support her. And the list goes on.</p>\n\n<p>Three: We see sex, virginity, and purity drastically differently, and rape is so rare nowadays we don't talk about its repercussions in relationships. Many men have a hard time getting intimate with their girlfriends/wives after they've been raped. But in the ancient world, nearly no one was willing to marry a non virgin. When a woman was raped in the ancient world, her life was literally over. She would more than likely never get married, never leave her fathers household, and if her father died, she would also likely die. This reality helps shed light on why God is there for the poor, the orphans, and the <strong>widows</strong>, and why the brother of the widow who has no children has to attempt to marry her. Because the poor have no resources and can't move up in the world, the orphans have no support, and a widow has no virginity and therefore little worth in the world. A woman without her virginity was like a person without eyesight, or hands, or feet. Severely disabled, at a great disadvantage, and likely to die.</p>\n\n<p>So this law was probably instituted to help women, in the following way. If someone raped her, he had basically ended her life, as she would never marry and would lack any financial support. Therefore he was punished with the responsibility of providing for her <em>for the rest of his life</em>, and she was rewarded with the safety and security of a husband who would support her. This sounds completely crazy and insane to us now, and it should. Because we have thankfully moved on as a civilization where we no longer need these kinds of laws now. A woman can find a husband, whether she was raped or even if she just had prior sexual partners. Women can work for themselves, women can inherit and invest money, governments have welfare and aid programs, etc.</p>\n\n\n",

However, some times it seems to me that some laws are not compatible for converts.</p>\n\n<p>One of these incompatibilities that I have encountered is the kosher wine. In my understanding, if a non-Jew touches an open bottle he/she will render the wine non-kosher. </p>\n\n<p>Apart from all the non-kosher additives, that can be a part of the process, it eludes me why a convert should buy kosher wine, as the wine is not kosher when he/she is drinking it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Kosher wine that is Mevushal, \"cooked\"*, is fine to touch. The underlying issue is that an enactment was put in place in Talmudic times to prevent Yayin Nesech (wine used for idolotrous purposes) and extended also to prevent intermarriage and out-conversion (meaning that, even if you know that the gentile serving you wine is not going to engage in idolatry, it is still prohibited to drink the wine that was touched by them). In a nutshell (very, very simplified), if wine is Mevushal, it is regarded as being of lesser quality, and it is therefore also not regarded as being suitable for Yayin Nesech, thus removing that problem. As a consequence, the restrictions on the wine are lifted all around. (However, it should be noted that there are still restrictions on drinking <em>with</em> gentiles, for those other reasons I already mentioned.) So, as long as you drink wine that is labeled Mevushal, you don't have to worry about making it non-Kosher by opening and then handling the bottle.</p>\n\n<p>*Thanks to a comment from Msh210, readers should be aware that Mevushal wine nowadays is not \"cooked\"/boiled in the usual sense. It's heated to a high temperature, but not neccesarily to boiling. (You can ask the Kosher certification to determine the temperature they require). See line 131 here: <a href=\"http://www.kosher-wine.com/history.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kosher-wine.com/history.shtml</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>This holds true for wine that is not mevushal, boiled. If a non-Jew touches an open bottle of mevushal wine, there is no problem. Note, this is not a melacha, that is, an action forbidden on the sabbath, but a separate prohibition related to the laws of kashrut and concerns over idolatry. There is much to be said on the subject (including an explanation of why mevushal wine was exempted from this prohibition) but the short answer is, buy wine that says on it \"Mevushal.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>You bring up a much more fundamental question than the other answers have dealt with. If the reason to forbid wine touched by certain people is lest they libated part of it to Avoda Zara, then should the wine be forbidden to the toucher himself if he knows that he did not libate it?</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein deals with this question (Igrot Moshe OC V 37:8) regarding the case of giving wine to a public Sabbath desecrator. If when he accepts the glass he forbids the wine to himself, then it might be forbidden to give him any wine per \"placing a stumbling block before the blind\". Rabbi Feinstein concludes that since a public Sabbath desacrator only forbids wine upon contact because as a sinner he is suspected of ties to Avoda Zara, and we know that most public Sabbath desacrators around nowadays are not actually going to libate the wine, we may be lenient regarding his drinking the wine that he touched and thereby offer him wine.</p>\n\n<p>Your case is slightly different (both in the strength of the enactment of non-Jews touching wine as well as in the degree to which you must be careful about the laws of Kashrut) but I think we can extrapolate sufficiently to show that since you know that you are not libating the wine (as you are in the process of converting) then you need not concern yourself with the wine that you yourself touched and you may consider it kosher for yourself, even if it is forbidden to others. (Note that this won't help you much if you have a family converting with you as you can't be trusted to each other.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus I think you should feel confortable drinking regular kosher wine that you yourself have touched.</p>\n\n\n",

Even though the Shulchan Aruch E.H 7,14 argues that the conception from the first <em>Biah</em> of a Cohen with an <em>Erva</em> -since she is only a Challala through a second biah- the resulting child does not become a <em>challal</em> and therefore is not  allowed to be <em>metamei Lemeisim</em> (see Beis Yosef* and Taz who explains this), the Halacha seems to follow the Majority of Rishonim and Acharonim disregard this opinion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"כבר כתבו האחרונים דאין נפקותא לדידן, דמאחר דהולד ממזר מכל העריות הוא גרע מחלל\".<br />\nThe Acharonim wrote since a mamzer can come from the forbidden relationships which a Yisroel is ossur to do whereas a Cholol only comes from uniquely Cohen forbidden relationships, so a mamzer is worst than a Cholol so everything that applies to a Cholol aplies to a Mamzer cohen</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means a Mamzer cohen is completely not a Cohen for everything including not doing Bircat Cohanim, and being able to contaminate himself with Tumat meit just like a Cholol.\nShulchan Aruch Even Haezer 7,20:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חלל של תורה הודאי <strong>הרי זו כזר ונושא גרושה ומטמא למתים</strong> שנאמר אמור אל הכהנים בני אהרן אע\"פ שהם בני אהרן עד שיהיו בכיהונם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>__________________________________________________</strong></p>\n<p>\\\\\\ignore the note if you are not familar with concepts///////<br />\n{*Note:The Beis Yosef seems to brings his proof to his opinion from Kiddushin 77b:<br />\nבפ' י' יוחסין (דף עז:) אהא דתנן אין חללה אלא מאיסורי כהונה א\"ר אשי הלכך כהן הבא על אחותו זונה משוי לה חללה לא משוי לה חזר ובא עליה עשאה חללה ופרש\"י חזר ובא עליה או הוא או כהן אחר עשאה חללה שהרי אסורה לו משום זונה שאינו נוהג אלא בכהונה<br />\n\"A cohen that cohabits with his sister (or other <em>Chayav Kareis</em> unions) Makes her into a Zonah henceforth but she is not a Chalolo until the second time where she trangresses a kohein related issur of Zonah\"  This implies that while her son is a Mamzer from the first cohabitation she is not a chalolo yet rather only a zonah for the future, so her son  still has a status of cohein even though he is a Mamzer.</p>\n<p>The reason why nearly all the Acharonim argue with the Beis Yosef is mentioned  in the Drisha:<br />\nובאמת שבגמרא איתא גם שאר עריות וז\"ל אמר רב אשי הלכך כהן הבא על אחותו כו' והיינו טעמא דבגמרא לא קאמר הנפקא מינה בולד אלא לענין תרומה שהיא עצמה נתחללה דמאי נפקא מינה שאין הולד נעשה מתחילה חלל הא הוה ממזר<br />\n\"Really the Gemora Kiddushin 77b means that the <strong>woman</strong> from all <em>erva</em> relationships (not only his sister) becomes a <em>challala</em> only from the second <em>Biah</em> which means <strong>she</strong> can no longer have <em>Teruma</em> (even though she could have <em>Teruma</em> after the first <em>Biah</em>). but there no diferrence regarding the child whether the conception was from first or second biah, as the child from the first <em>biah</em> is also a <em>Mamzer</em> which includes being a <em>chollol</em> and does not need to be classified as a <em>chollol</em> (as he has lost his status of kohen just by being a <em>Mamzer</em>)}</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yitzchak Berkowitz clearly said in a halacha shiur that a Kohen cannot be a mamzer according to all poskim.

The case of the SA is understood by the OP eventually as this. The child is a mamzer and the SA says he's not chalal. <strong>Can we infer that a mamzer can be a kasher kohen?</strong></p>\n<p>First, the source is a statement in Gemara (Kiddushin 77b) Regarding how a woman becomes Chalala.</p>\n<p>Soncino's translation</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A halalah results from a priestly interdict only...

If he - or another priest - engage in relations with her a second time, she becomes a challalah** and <em><strong>her offspring from [a priest] are challalim.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last statement of the Rambam regards the offspring.</p>\n<p>The Maggid Mishne explains that from the list of women prohibited from a Lav that is not Isure Kehuna, the prohipition of a Zekuka Leyibum, we have a Nafka Mina for the offspring. Indeed, in a such case, the offspring are not Mamzer, because Mamzer is only from Lav punished by Karet. So this offspring from the Zekuka Leyibum is not Mamzer and is not either Chalal because Chalal applies only for Isure Kehuna, prohibitions that regards Kohanim only. And the Zekuka leyabam is an Isur that regards also Israelim. So the offspring has no psul Chalalut from the first intercourse with a Cohen, because the Kohen doesn't still make the woman Zona.</p>\n<p>The text in Hebrew of the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=100984&rid=4449\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Isure Bia 19.5</a>, and Maggid Mishne is very clear.</p>\n<p>The discussion in Acharonim is for a case in which the Kohen had with the Zekuka Leyabam an intercourse with marital intention. There are opinions in which the child is Mamzer Miderabanan. But this case is not the point of the OP.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the case in the SA cannot include cases in which the child is Mamzer, there is no reason to infer from the SA that a  mamzer can be Kohen. It's absolutely impossible that the Rambam wrote a new Din without source, therefore, he made an inference from the Gemara regarding one case of offspring. See Beur Hagra 7.24.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Traditional review of Heschel's \"Torah min HaShamayim\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>\"Torah min Hashamayim B'aspaklariya shel Hadorot\" (תורה מן השמים באספקלריה של הדורות) was written by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel\">R' Abraham Joshua Heschel</a> and published by Soncino Press and JTS Press in 1962. It was translated into English by R' Gordon Tucker in <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=WAGK8GiNrQgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=heavenly%20torah&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bQu9T_jtOcnniALN97iFDg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=heavenly%20torah&f=false\">\"Heavenly Torah as Refracted through the Generations\"</a> in 2006.</p>\n\n<p>The book is based on the thesis that there were two main schools in the times of the Tanaim which differed on a wide range of fundamental issues, <em>halachic</em> and <em>aggadic</em> (although the book deals mainly with the <em>aggadic</em> topics). These were the school of R' Akiva and the school of R' Yishmael. R' Akiva was representative of a more mystical approach to things, while R' Yishmael typified a more rational approach. The book moves through the many topics on which they differed chapter by chapter and not a page goes by without several quotes or references to Talmudic or midrashic literature to support this thesis. (I am aware that Heschel was not the first to state this observation; however, he is possibly the first to elaborate on it at such great length and with so many sources, certainly with respect to the <em>aggadic</em> issues.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm specifically looking for a review of this book by a more traditional figure within Orthodox Judaism. (I say this because although it is unclear to me just from online information the state of R' Heschel's religious affiliation, it is at least clear that he is not what we would call a \"traditional\" source.) [Also, I am familiar with <a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2009/04/torah-from-heaven-translation-of.html\">R' Gil Student's review</a> posted when the translation was published. I am looking for the review of a more prominent and authoritative figure, if it exists, and preferably more in-depth.] However, I would also be satisfied with a (in-depth) discussion of this topic (R' Akiva vs. R' Yishmael) offered by a more traditional source.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe has a talk in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14929&st=&pgnum=130&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Likutei Sichot volume 6 page 119-129</a> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/110503/jewish/Torah-Studies-Yitro.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Adapted into English by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks here</a>) where he discusses the arguments between R' Yishmael and R' Akiva regarding what the Jews saw at Sinai and how they responded to the Commandments.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe explains that R' Yishmael and R' Akiva's disagreements stem from the different places they came from. R' Akiva was a Baal Teshuva and R' Yishmael was a Kohen Gadol. From Rabbi Sacks' essay:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Ishmael was a High Priest (a Kohen Gadol) and the nature of a priest is to be “sanctified to his G-d.” His service is that of the righteous, to transmit holiness to this world (to take the high and bring it low). This is why he saw the greatest miracle as being that G-d Himself came down to this world, so far as to be perceived by the normal senses (“they saw what is normally seen”).</p>\n<p>But Rabbi Akiva was a man of repentance (a Ba’al Teshuvah), whose descent was from converts and who only started to learn Torah at the age of 40. Repentance colors his whole manner of service: The desire to ascend higher than this world (and, as is known, he longed throughout his life to be able to martyr himself in the cause of G-d). So that for him the greatest miracle was the transcending of all physical limitations (“they saw what is normally heard”).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14929&pgnum=136\" rel=\"noreferrer\">footnote 33* of the Sicha</a>, the Rebbe says that this was the rationale of the argument between R' Akiva and R' Yishmael in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=3&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sotah (3A)</a>, where there are several Mitzvot that R' Akiva says are an obligation while R' Yishmael says the are optional.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To answer the first part of your question Heschel was not considered part of mainstream orthodox Judaism, he was faculty at JTS, as such no mainstream \"Gadol\" would have reviewed his work in any meaningful capacity (nor given haskamot). <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel#External_links\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia lists several reviews of this work</a>, the most orthodox leaning to my mind is Alan Brill. His review may be read <a href=\"http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_view/gid,312/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the overall thesis my understanding is that the exact opposite is true. Rebbi Akiva is generally the more rational (\"Akiva, what are you doing trying to expound aggadic material, go to negaim and oholos\") which is why the sojourn he leads into \"Pardes\" was was marred by death and apostasy of his colleagues, whereas Rebbi Yishmael is the protagonist of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hekhalot_literature\" rel=\"nofollow\">heichalot literature</a>. </p>\n\n\n",

By this I mean to say the physical tablets themselves. Had Moshe gone up to Har Sinai and come down with nothing, or perhaps a fully written out torah scroll, would we have been missing anything? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Alter Rebbe in Ch. 53 of Tanya says the following (parenthesis) are my own additions to help better understand this very complicated idea.</p>\n\n<p>Ch. 53 also mentions how the lack of luchos during the 1st and 2nd Beis HaMikdash affected how the Shechina came down. See Yoma 21 that discusses how the Shechinah didnt dwell in the 2nd Temple because of the lack of luchos. The Alter Rebbe explains in Ch. 53 that the Shechinah during the second temple came down in a gradual descent of malchus d'atzilus into malchus d'beriah, etc. </p>\n\n<p>During the time the First Temple stood, the Ark and the (Luchos) Tablets were in the Holy of Holies. The Shechinah — which is Malchut of Atzilut, (the revealed light of the Ein Sof) dwelled there and was clothed in the Ten Commandments. (This G-dly revelation) was far more intense, and with a greater and mightier revelation, than the same (category of) revelation in the shrines of the Holy of Holies above in the upper Worlds. (Each world has a reflection of the other worlds so there is a Beis Hamikdash in our world may it soon be rebuilt, in the spiritual world of Asiayh, Yetzirah, Beriah, and Atzilus as well abeit in a more spiritual form that has a greater connection to G-dly light ie: the Ohr Ein Sof) For the Ten Commandments are the all-embracing principles of the whole Torah, which derives from the level of Supernal Chochmah, that is far higher than the “world of manifestation.”(Asiyah) In order to engrave them on material tablets of stone, it did not descend degree by degree, parallel to the order of descent of the Worlds, this Material World. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The natural order of G-dly light transformed into this physical world follows a very organized and vast structure known as Seder Histalshelus <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seder_hishtalshelus\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seder_hishtalshelus</a> In the case of the G-dly Light entering into the Luchos, in the Ark, in the Holy of Holies, in the Beis HaMikdash, this structure was skipped and the G-dly light entered unfiltered and to a degree higher than even the highest of high such as the Sefira of Keser. This was why there were unbelievable miracles witnessed daily in the 1st Temple that defied nature and all logic see Pirke Avos Ch. 5:5</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the giving of the Torah at Har Sinai, spirituality could not stay in the physical world. When spirituality was brought down into this world, it was attached to a physical object, like Yaakov and the sticks. Once the object was done being used the spiritual element left back to the supernal world and the sticks turned back to sticks. After Har Sinai the Spiritual and Physical blended together. The Alter Rebbe is most likely expounding on something from the Zohar that describes the highest levels of divine hashpa (influence) being brought down into the world unfiltered and revealed more through the 10 commandements in the ark in the holy of holies than the highest levels of G-dly revelation such as Kesser of Atzilus. </p>\n\n<p>This only addresses what purpose the luchos severed since it seems a Torah Scroll or just an Oral Law would be just as good. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>For a more historiological answer than @mochinRechavim's, see <a href=\"http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/kitisa/mar.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article by Dr. Meshulam Margaliot at Bar-Ilan</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Margaliot pursues this question along with R Nehemia's position in Shemot Rabbah 47.6 which agrees with the Sages' position in Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael (Tractate de-ba-Hodesh 5): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How were the Ten Commandments given? Five on one tablet and five on the other. 'I am the L-rd' written across from 'You shall not murder'.\n  This is according to R. Hanina b. Gamaliel, but the Sages say ten on one tablet and ten on the other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He answers that the Ten Commandments were given in the form of a traditional ancient Near Eastern contract.  Each party gets their own copy of the agreement.  He says that of course G-d's copy lives in the aron since that is where the Shekhina lives...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But what about the Israelite's copy, on the second Tablet, where was that copy placed? Here we note a common practice in the ancient Near East. When a treaty was made between parties of unequal status, the lesser partner, or vassal, would place his copy of the pact in the temple of his god, the reason being that the vassal had then to take an oath in the name of his god to \"the great king.\" (See Ez. 17:11-19. The reference here is to the king of the Hittites, who made treaties with the rulers of smaller kingdoms in northern Syria during the first half of the first millennium B.C.E. This custom, however, undoubtedly dates much further back.) </p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>Since the Israelites had the status of vassal vis-à-vis G-d and were the lesser partners to the Covenant, it was reasonable for them to file their copy of the Pact in the Holy Ark of the L-rd their G-d. Thus we conclude that both Tablets were placed together in the Ark in the Tabernacle, and later in Solomon's Temple: \"There was nothing inside the Ark but the two tablets of stone which Moses placed there at Horeb, when the L-rd made [a covenant] with the Israelites after their departure from the land of Egypt\" (I Kings 8:9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason for the luchot, then, is that they define the covenant between the King and the vassal kingdom, i.e., Israel.  They are the formalization of that relationship and it reflected the practices of the people in the area of the time regarding covenants.</p>\n\n\n",

This is because one may light a fire on Yom Tov, but not extinguish it (see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/708510/jewish/Laws-of-Yom-Tov.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> or <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/holidays/pesach/laws_and_customs/3467\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for details).</p>\n\n<p>Somebody told me that on Yom Tov, in order to turn off the gas on a stovetop, one is able to put a full pot of water on the stovetop. When it boils, it will overflow and extinguish the flame. One may then turn off the gas, since doing so does not extinguish the flame.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn't sound right to me. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/708510/jewish/Laws-of-Yom-Tov.htm#footnoteRef15a708510\" rel=\"nofollow\">This footnote</a> seems to imply the opposite:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Extinguishing a fire is forbidden. Even indirectly; for example, by placing a burning candle where the wind might blow it out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, that footnote is unsourced, so I'm not sure where to look it up.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone seen a source of whether this practice of boiling water to extinguish a flame is forbidden or permitted?

And to the woman he said: \"Lie (here) until the morning.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But he was worried significantly about what people would think and so likewise stayed.

Likewise, Boaz’s power is the humility of Palti, son of Laish, as Palti’s capacity for restraint was greater still. Joseph’s power is the humility of Boaz, as it is written about Boaz: “And it came to pass at midnight that the man was startled and turned himself, and behold, a woman lay at his feet” (Ruth 3:8). What is the meaning of “and turned himself [vayyilafet]”? Rav says: The meaning is that his flesh became like the heads of turnips [lefatot], his sexual organ hardening out of arousal, but even though Ruth was not married he refrained from engaging in intercourse with her; while Yoseph had to exert more effort, despite the fact that Potiphar’s wife was married. (Sefaria translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see this episode with Boaz and Rus was one of great temptation, one that exceeded that of Yosef and Potifera and yet Boaz passed the test. Thus it warrants mention as it is another important lesson in overcoming the lure of the Yetzer Hara.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Single women had 2 choices to survive, either 1) marriage; or, 2) prostitution, and Moabite women in Israel might be pushed more toward option # 2. According to the prophet Samuel who wrote this book, Rut was righteous, so how are the characters going to treat this Moabitess who chose Naami and her people over her own? Who would Rut marry? Who would she choose? Would she be accepted? Will her children be accepted?   </p>\n\n<p>Naami was a righteous woman and not naive. For Rut and Naami's continued survival, they were going to have to act.  She in wisdom encouraged Rut toward Boaz in a rather definitive and bold move. Essentially Rut proposed marriage to Boaz by sleeping near him at the harvest campsite. Regardless of whether  that means they had sex, the point is she flirted in such an explicit manner as to propose marriage to him. Boaz was thrilled by her proposal, and states explicitly he was glad to be chosen over younger men and her more immediate family redeemers. He praises her righteousness, exclaims how hard working and how loyal to her mother in law she was. Boaz could see she was modest in the fields with the young guys around. He immediately went about removing any barriers to their marriage, thus accepting her into his home and the community.  This benefit of including the righteous stranger into the community was a great one that impacted not only Naami but the union was to produce kings.  This fact is hidden in the name of Naami's deceased husband Elimelech (to me the kingdom). </p>\n\n<p>Although she is not considered one of Israel's seven prophetesses, <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.co.il/general/info/48prophets.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.dafyomi.co.il/general/info/48prophets.pdf</a>  the book was written by the prophet Samuel who anointed David HaMelech, knowing he was descended from this Moabite convert.  Just as the Holy One is hidden in this story, the kingship  alluded to in this union. Samuel chose what seemed the unlikely choice, David haMelech, as did Naami and Rut. They looked at the inner person, not the lineage or externalities, and so can we. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This story is very difficult to understand on a simple, pshat level.

So for example, I'd trust that most chicken or beef available on the market is not <em>eiver min hachai</em>.  But snow crab legs are apparently often taken from live snow crabs.  So if the ben noach knows what foods are likely to be problematic, they can avoid those or devote extra caution when eating those things.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Noachide community does not seem to be large enough to support \"kashrus agencies\" or even institutions such as restaurants. Perhaps there are some that I have not heard of (particularly the possibility of a restaurant owner who intentionally observes the relevant laws) but it doesn't seem to exist as such.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the broader issue I will recycle my answer from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/21964/899\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/21964/899</a> which I believe has a great deal of overlap:</p>\n\n<p>This is a great question that highlights the differences between the halachah for a ben Noach and the halachah for Am Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>I think that it is worthwhile to ask this question l'maaseh to a posek who has some familiarity with the laws for the bnei Noach but...</p>\n\n<p>While it might seem that it is safest to purchase kosher meat to avoid any issue of ever min haChai (the prohibition against eating a limb from a living animal, the \"kashrus\" issue for B'nei Noach), it is not clear that this is automatically the case. According to some authorities although a Jew is permitted to eat meat taken subsequent to the two simanim (signs) of shechita (slaughter) being severed, while it remains prohibited to a ben Noach as long as the animal moves (Rambam in the Mishneh Torah, Hilchos Melachim 9:12,13, the footnote in the Moznaim English translation explains that the Rashba and others rule that a non-Jew is not liable in the circumstance where a Jew isn't based on Hullin 121b).</p>\n\n<p>Practically however, State and Federal laws in the United States regarding slaughter would prevent commercially produced meat from being taken while an animal is still alive. Although I'm not sure we can apply concepts such as Rov [majority] or Chazakah [presumption] in the framework of the Sheva Mitzvos B'nei Noach, nevertheless it seems to me reasonable that one can rely on the government in this situation insofar as they are effectively exercising their obligation to set up \"court\" which prevent taking an \"ever min haChai\". As such it would seem permissible for a B'nei Noach to purchase pork sold commercially in the stores. Furthermore the Rambam rules (ibid 10:1) that with the exception of murder a non-Jew is not liable for an inadvertent transgression (b'shogaig).</p>\n\n<p>With regard to shellfish it would not seem to be a concern because it is not clear that the prohibition applies to fish at all. The Rambam understands the prohibition as not applying to poultry/fowl (ibid 9:11). Though the Rava'ad (see Moznaim ibid) disagrees, he exempts a sheretz (creeping creature), and it is would seem seafood is just out of the equation. Additionally shellfish are often sold live, whole, or effectively whole/clearly \"slaughtered\". If there is reason to be concerned about ever min haChai regarding seafood it shouldn't be difficult obtaining seafood whose suitability is evident.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Regarding cattle and swine, the common practice for slaughtering and butchering animals involves 1. stunning the animal 2. bleeding the animal and 3. butchering (removing the limbs) of the animal. Bleeding is the process of slitting the throat and allowing as much blood as possible to drain out. So for these animals, biological death, that is death that is kosher for Noahides, has a high likelihood of having taken place before the limbs were removed.  Chickens are normally bled as well before slaughter, so again, there is likely no problem. The reason for the bleeding is simple.  It reduces mess/cleanup when butchering the animal. Eiver min hachai only applies to domestic and wild land mammals and birds.  It does not apply to fish, reptiles, insects, crustaceans such as shrimp and lobster or even sea mammals such as whales and dolphins. So, for example, removing the limb of a lobster while alive does not fall under eiver min hachai.

    "content": "# Maintaining Tzniut in Uncomfortable Social Situations\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How can a teenage girl, who recently started practicing the laws of tzniut as well as feasible, balance those laws with the prohibition against embarrassing her family members, who are embarrassed to be seen with her dressed so oddly?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>You are to be commended for taking on a socially-challenging mitzvah.  It's not always easy to be Jewish and be seen as different, whether it's through dress, food, or how you spend your Friday nights and Saturdays.</p>\n\n<p>With any observance that sets you apart from others, take care in how you talk about it.  It's about you, not about them, especially for your secular friends.  Make it clear that you're doing this for your own reasons; you need to steer clear of anything that will be perceived as a superiority attitude, because people don't like to be around people they think are judging them.  Since that is not your attitude, this just means listening to how you talk and imagining how it will be perceived.  One simple, truthful explanation you can offer is \"I find these clothes more comfortable\".</p>\n\n<p>(Some of your friends are probably Jews who you might wish were also keeping tziniut, so perhaps there is some subconscious judgement there.  Don't ignore them, but you need to get comfortable yourself before you can be effective at drawing others in.  Being a role model will likely work better than trying to persuade them.)</p>\n\n<p>Another thing you can do is to spend time with your female friends (without any guys around); in those settings the rules are more relaxed, so a swimming suit, for example, is not a problem.  That won't work on beaches and at public pools, but it could work at a spa, for example.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you act like this is (1) unremarkable and (2) not open for debate, eventually people will lose interest in arguing with you.  If you don't make a big deal about it then, in time, they won't either.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Tznuit does not have to be \"funny\" looking clothes.  When I was a teenager, I went through a modest dressing phase and actually eventually discovered a personally quirky style in it!  While I'm not currently observing complete tznuit in dress...</p>\n\n<p>1) Check out styles that might easily be modified for modesty.  If you're more of an artsy, flowy type, you could try some of the neo-hippy type maxi dresses and sweaters, or funky long sleeved tees!</p>\n\n<p>2) Another style that lends itself well to modest dressing is vintage.  Skirt lengths are longer, often you can find lovely tops with flattering decoration that is more at the neckline or the wrists instead of plastered across the chest.</p>\n\n<p>3) My personal fave (and the one I still exhibit when I can be bothered to \"dress up\") is a more preppy style.  Oxford shirts, cardigans, plaid skirts (they do come in lengths other than \"short\" although you may have to look around a little).</p>\n\n<p>And remember that while your personal sense of tznuit may mean \"don't dress flashily\" it doesn't have to mean \"dress frumpily.\"  You can <em>and should</em> feel comfortable in your clothes, and wear clothes that are generally flattering (which doesn't have to mean skimpy, or alluring).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>If we discuss tznius as a trait, as opposed to a minimum standard which must be met to avoid violating an issur, then I think your asking a good question to be successful. Part of the trait of tznius is trying not to make oneself conspicuous. Of course this isn't an absolute and cannot always be achieved, (head/hair coverings, traditional styles, hot days, etc.) but is still a good goal. Ideally (unless your part of a community with specific standards of dress that should be honored) your manner of dress should only be conspicuous when observed over a period of time.</p>\n\n<p>I think that the following would be helpful in analyzing an outfit: </p>\n\n<p>Make certain what needs to be covered is covered as needed during normal daily activities.</p>\n\n<p>Select individual garments that wouldn't seem out of place.</p>\n\n<p>Put them together in a way that wouldn't seem out of place on a moderate fall or early spring day.</p>\n\n<p>Err on the side of less casual dress when practical. Part of the art of tznius is balancing taking care of your appearance without trying to attract others.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that layering is pretty popular right now, and helps \"kasher\" otherwise unwearable garments, I suspect that you will have more success in \"fitting in\"/\"not appearing odd\" if you rely more on garments that are acceptable as designed.</p>\n\n<p>Finding acceptable clothes can be a challenge, but I'm incline to believe that you can still find acceptable clothing that you can put into conventional outfits that would not stand out to a by-passer. Your friends and family will notice your habits but I suspect that they will have a much easier time accepting them.</p>\n\n\n",

Tanakh <em>does</em> consider Shavuos as זמן מתן תורתנו</strong></p>\n<p>Although it does not say so in the context of the laws of Shavuos, the Torah might have other ways of saying that it really does consider the holiday to be זמן מתן תורתנו:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The most obvious answer is that if you look carefully, the Torah gives us the timeline for the events occurring at Sinai (Shemos 19) and we are supposed to figure it out. Ralbag (to the end of that chapter) writes explicitly that the Torah intends for us to make this connection (although the truth is that it isn't so clear; there is, after all, a dispute in the Gemara about how to interpret the timeline. Also Ralbag doesn't really explain why the Torah had to leave this as an exercise for the reader)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=zqOoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48#v=onepage&q=chronicles%20asa&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Some scholars</a> see Shavuot celebrated as מתן תורה by King Asa in Divrei Hayamim II 15:8-15, where a re-dedication ceremony is carried out \"in the third month,\" Sivan. Since this ceremony involved oaths, \"שבועות,\" some have proposed seeing this as a pun on the holiday that they were celebrating at the time. (<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/dsd/15/2/article-p225_2.xml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof David Henshke argues</a> that this is not really a proof)</li>\n<li>A line in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.3.98b.15?vhe=Torat_Emet_Zohar&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar (3:98b)</a> sees the two loaves offered in the Temple on Shavuos as corresponding the two tablets given to Moshe on this day</li>\n<li>Yerushalmi Rosh Hashanah 4:5 (and a few other Midrashic sources) note that the he-goat brought on all the festivals as a <em>chatas</em> is called on Shavuos a se’ir ‘izim instead of a שעיר עזים לחטאת or a שעיר לחטאת. This indicates that Shavuos commemorates the giving of the Torah, and the Torah cleanses one from sin, or it is to connect Shavuos to Yom Kippur (when Moshe came down from Sinai with the second tablets)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tanach.org/special/shav/shavs1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Menachem Leibtag</a> shows that there is a very strong hint to this connection in the sacrifices for Shavuos: it is the only time of the year when Shelamim [well-being] sacrifices are offered for the community. The only other time we find this in the Torah is at the foot of Mount Sinai (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.24?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 24:5</a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://old.herzog.ac.il/tvunot/fulltext/mega4_cohen.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Shmuel Cohen</a> (<em>Megadim</em> 4) and <a href=\"https://www.alephbeta.org/playlist/what-does-shavuot-celebrate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. David Fohrman</a> separately develop a novel idea. They note the Torah’s many parallels between the holiday of Shavuot and the fifty year cycle culminating in the Yovel, or Jubilee indicate that the fifty day count to Shavuot mirrors the Jubilee, and enough biblical parallels exist to argue that the Jubilee itself is a year sanctified to commemorate of Sinai, where God made a covenant with Israel to take them as His people:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>the first instance of this unusual word “yovel,” Jubilee, is actually in the context of the shofar-blasts heard at the foot of Mount Sinai (Shemos 19:13). The Jubilee year is also inaugurated with a shofar blast on Yom Kippur</li>\n<li>during the Yovel year it is prohibited to work the land on account of its holiness, just as a ban was placed on nearing Sinai while God’s presence sanctified the mountain</li>\n<li>the Yovel’s laws requiring that land be laid fallow is a recognition that the land belongs to God (Vayikra 23:25), and the obligation to free one’s slaves expresses that our very persons belong to God (23:55). At the Sinai covenant, God likewise tells the nation through Moshe that they are to belong to Him, “for all the Earth is mine” (Shemos 19:5), and the laws of freeing slaves follows not too long after (Shemos 21)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>II. Although the Torah hid this information, we do not</strong></p>\n<p>Several commentators ask why the Torah does not have a holiday for מתן תורה and give various answers. Some of these help explain why we would celebrate such a holiday even though the Torah itself does not:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nechama.org.il/commentators/22.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Ashterok</a> (quoted in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51462&st=&pgnum=288\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Sheleimah vol. 16 page 282</a>) writes that the Torah does not specify when it was given, because in truth the Torah had existed 'two thousand years before the world was created,' and so from its own perspective the day that it was given to Israel is not as big of a deal. The implication, though, is that the nation of Israel can still celebrate from their perspective when they got the Torah.</li>\n<li>Another answer by R. Ashterok, which is also given by R. Yitzchak Aramah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Akeidat_Yitzchak.67.5?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Akeidas Yitzchak, Vayikra no. 67</a>) and many others after them, is that the Torah \"must always be new in your eyes,\" and so we can't have one day a year to celebrate it. However, we could still use this day as a yearly appreciation something that ideally should be recognized daily.</li>\n<li>R. Yitzchak Aramah also says that the Torah could not have commanded \"that we celebrate the day of its giving and its beginning, if we are not [yet] required to obey it, unless this was already accepted as a prior truth.” There is some logical inconsistency of the Torah teaching about itself being given (but presumably now that it's happened, we can recognize the holiday for what it is).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_ibn_Shuaib\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yehoshua ibn Shueib</a> (Derasha for Shavuos) writes that the Torah was interested in recording what sanctifies the holiday, and in the case of Shavuos, the day is not holy because of the anniversary of a historical event, but rather because it completes the counting of the Omer from Pesach. Thus, we can certainly celebrate it as זמן מתן תורתנו, but that's not what makes the day holy, and so that's not what the Torah discusses</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tiferet_Yisrael.27.12?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharal (Tiferet Israel Ch. 27)</a> writes that it would be inappropriate for God to obligate rejoicing for getting the Torah which is “a yoke upon our necks.” Based on a similar idea, the Chosam Sofer (Toras Moshe to Vayehi) writes that even though the Torah couldn't have obligated such a holiday, we of our own volition should celebrate it because we can and should appreciate that this \"yoke\" is actually a great gift.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Leviticus.23.36\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Ovadia Seforno (to Vayikra 23:36)</a> says that we can't celebrate Shavuos as the time of מתן תורה because that particular \"giving of the Torah\" had failed: the nation ended up making a golden calf and Moshe shattered the luchos. R. Moshe Alshich (to Vayikra 23:6) also writes this way, but adds that we can nevertheless celebrate this day ourselves because God was ready to give us the Torah, and if we are worthy we can accept it anew</li>\n<li>R. D.Z. Hoffman writes (among many other ideas he has in a very long piece) that the Torah didn't want to say explicitly what the holiday was about so as not to give credence to the idea that only the ten commandments (which were spoken on this day of מתן תורה) are divine.</li>\n<li>R. S.R. Hirsch writes that the time of the giving of the Torah was left out of the Written Torah and instead kept as an oral tradition to emphasize the importance of the Oral Torah. Here's a quotation (Collected Writings, vol. 1 page 198-196):</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And now, behold! The celebration in remembrance of the Torah, this soul of our soul, our highest good on which is based our whole existence, and without which all the precious things to which the other festivals are consecrated-freedom and soil, preservation and prosperity, purity and atonement-would lose their essence and meaning, just this celebration in remembrance of the Torah is not mentioned at all, no reference to it is made in the written word of God; it is only to the oral tradition, the תורה שבעל פה, that we owe the Festival of the Revelation of the written Torah, תורה שבכתב, and thus the first memorial of the Written Law directs us to the Oral Law, to tradition. How eloquent is this silence of the Torah concerning its own festival! The Written Law abandons itself if we deny the Oral Law; the Written Law renounces its own existence unless it is preceded by the Oral Law; the Written Law commits the very knowledge of its celebration to the living tradition of the word of mouth handed down from God. Thus the Written Law seeks to be celebrated only in a company of men who are permeated by the living breath of the Oral Law, which is Divine like the written word; and in this way the Written Law itself makes it clear that its very being depends on the existence of the Oral Law. This is the second thought which the silence of the Torah with regard to זמן מתן תורתנו teaches us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>III. Association of Shavuos with מתן תורה came much later in Jewish History</strong></p>\n<p>Orthodox Judaism, I'm pretty sure, believes that any of the sages' traditions regarding Shavuos and מתן תורה must have been passed down since Sinai itself. However, it might still be possible to say that the celebration of Shavuos changed since the time of Tanakh:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Rivash (Teshuvah 96) and Ritva (to Shabbos 86b) both strongly imply that, in fact, Shavuos was not considered the day of מתן תורה for as long as the calendar months depended upon the new moon, since we could never be sure exactly when Shavuos would fall out: would the fiftieth day of the Omer count be the fifth, sixth, or seventh of Sivan? Therefore, Shavuos never really was the holiday of the Torah until the calendar was fixed so that it always falls out on the historical anniversary of matan Torah, which is the 6th of Sivan</li>\n<li>R. Menachem Kasher (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51494&st=&pgnum=225\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Sheleimah vol. 21, page 213</a>) suggests that the rabbis only started considering Shavuos to be זמן מתן תורתנו in order to respond to the claim of other sects of Judaism who believed that Shavuos would always be on a Sunday. To ensure that everyone knew that it can actually be any day of the week (because the omer count of fifty days starts from Pesach, instead of from a Shabbos), the Sages wanted to emphasize that it is tied to a historical event, even if the Torah itself did not want to make that connection explicit (maybe because of the failed מתן תורה, like the Seforno explains).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/shavuot-zeman-mattan-torateinu/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> suggests that Shavuos used to celebrate the land of Israel, and once that became not as relevant (because so much of the nation wasn't living there anymore), the sages refocused the holiday to center around the fact that it coincides with מתן תורה</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Rav S.R. Hirsch in the Collected Writings Vol.1 in an article entitled \"The Uniqueness of the Torah\" writes that the connection between Shavuos and Matan Torah is only stated in the Torah Shebaal Peh in order to teach us that someone who does not accept the Torah Shebaal Peh never has had a Kabolas Hatorah</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>As explained in <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/shotharibash/shotharibash02.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">שו\"ת הריב\"ש</a> 96 and brought in <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh3/1/494/1.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Harav</a> there is no inherent connection between Shavuos and Mattan Torah.

So this isn't some sort of proxy arrangement on behalf of Elimelech (who anyway had produced sons).</p>\n<p>So what does it mean when it says a son is born to <em>Naomi</em>?  Does this just mean a descendant (since her other sons died), or does she somehow have maternal status (which may be related to her nursing the child)?  If she has special status, why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Great question! \nThis can be understood Cabalistically based on the idea that the soul of the deceased transmigrates into the new child. As such the soul of Machlon has passed into this child so that in a manner of speaking this is a child to Naomi. (cf. Likuetei Moharan 21:6)</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore note that during the discussion between Rus and Naomi about visiting with Boaz, as well as later on in the megillah there is a marked difference between the kri and ktiv (see for example 3:<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2903.htm#3\">3-5</a>,<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2903.htm#17\">17</a>). It is read as if Rus is doing things but it is written as if Naomi is actually doing them. The idea here being that in effect Rus has made herself so subordinate to Naomi that she becomes virtually non-existent (hence, as you point out, Naomi not Rus, nurses the baby). </p>\n\n\n",

What does Yechezkel resemble? A villager who saw the king. And what does Yeshayahu resemble? A townsman who saw the king. <em>(Rashi: The sight of the king is a novelty to the villager, and he is naturally inclined to give his impressions at length. However, the king is a familiar sight to the townsman and he does not need to elaborate in his descriptions).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although both prophets merited visions of the Merkava, Yeshayahu's was more clear and direct. Yechekziel however, being an \"outsider\", focused on the “entourage” (the animal-like images etc.), whereas Yeshayahu being more comfortable with his exposure to Divinity was able to look through the \"entourage\" and focus on G-d Himself.</p>\n\n<p>It would thus seem more appropriate to read about the vision of Yeshayahu on Shavuos, which describes a superior revelation of G-dliness. However, the Lubavitcher Rebbe explains, when we understand the purpose of Matan Torah we can appreciate how it is the vision of Yechezkiel which is more fitting with the theme of the Giving of the Torah. The Giving of the Torah was not an isolated event; its purpose was to enable us to sanctify and bring spirituality into this physical world. This is only possible because the physical world in all its details is a reflection of the spiritual worlds from which it was formed. Sanctifying this world is the process of identifying and re-associating each physical entity with its spiritual counterpart.</p>\n\n<p>This is the theme expressed in Yechezkiel's vision. Just as Yechezkiel saw imagery of the heavenly \"entourage\" through which he was able to discern its Divine source, likewise, we should train ourselves to see through the veil of physicality and appreciate how every element of this world is merely the external face of a higher spiritual reality.</p>\n\n\n",

There were women of all ages and even some children from second and third grade up. We were given sheets to put the names of people who need a refuah, or assistance in any way in the different categories and told to think about them when we got up to that bracha. There is also a page of \"yehi ratzons\" or extended prayers to say after each of the brachas. It wasn't about eating. Most people took small amounts of food, just enough to say a bracha. It was about opening the heavens to hear our prayers and answer them. There are less foods than at a Tu Bishvat Seder or (on Rosh Hashana), and there's only one cup of \"hagefen.\" There were women there from all different shuls, and several rebbetzins. The rebbetzin leading the evening encouraged us all to take on something extra in our observance of mitzvot. The party I was just at also gave tremendous chizuk to a young mother of six children who was just diagnosed with cancer for whom the evening was dedicated. I don't see how or why it would be construed as problematic. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The linked aticle <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=2280\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=2280</a> quotes the Ben Ish Chai as saying that brachos party are a specific merit for an ill person.

However, people  should rely on classic rooted ideas such as teffilah,teshuva, and tzaddka. He was also asked is it kdai(worth going). He answered that it's better to stick to things which are rooted in our tradition than new ideas.</p>\n\n<p>I saw that Rav Dov Lior was less empathetic and held that one should stay away from something which has no source in Chazal . He also brings the pshat of the Netziv on the words lo sassuru that it means not to make up your own way of serving HaShem ,something not in Chazal one should stay away.</p>\n\n<p>From a practical standpoint, if one is not profieceint in hilchos brachos one can make brachos that are not necessary which is a prohibition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Text of Rav Aviner:</strong></p>\n\n<p>שאלה: מה דעת הרב על \"סעודת אמנים\"?</p>\n\n<p>תשובה: זו המצאה חדשה. מותר להשתתף, כי לא עושים שם שום דבר רע, מברכים ועונים אמן. למה נשים עושות את זה? כדי שיהיו זכויות בשביל עצמן, בשביל חולים, בשביל בנות שתתחתנה וכו'.</p>\n\n<p>אבל, אם אנשים רוצים להוסיף זכויות אין צורך להמציא דרכים. תמיד הבעיה הזאת עומדת בפנינו כיצד להוסיף זכויות. כתוב: תשובה ותפילה וצדקה. צריך להתפלל, צריך לתן את הכסף של \"סעודת אמנים\" לצדקה וצריך לעשות תשובה על מה שאתה לא בסדר.</p>\n\n<p>האם כדאי להשתתף ב\"סעודת אמנים\"? עדיף להוסיף זכויות לא על ידי דברים שממציאים עכשיו אלא ע\"י דברים קבועים וברורים.</p>\n\n<p>יש עוד צד, שזו פגישה חברתית. ישמן נשים שנחנקות בבית וצריכות לפגוש חברות. בלי לפגוש חברות הן מתות – 'חברותא או מיתותא' (תענית כג, א). במקום ללכת ולקשקש במכולת, אומרות ברכות ועונות אמן – בסדר.</p>\n\n<p>אבל, ד' כבר חשב על כל זה ונתן לנו תרי\"ג מצוות ולכן אין צריך להמציא כל מיני דברים</p>\n\n\n",

As a result, people there who learn \"all night\" have to stay up an hour or two more into the morning than those in the North.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering whether, as a result of this difference, the practice of learning all night is either less prevalent in the Southern Hemisphere, or perhaps whether alternative schedules (such as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1381/staying-up-all-night-on-shavuot\">this one</a>) are more prevalent there.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I live in Sydney Australia and I can say definitively that yes the custom is to stay up all night and learn on Shavuot night.

During this waking period people were quite active. They often got up, went to the toilet or smoked tobacco and some even visited neighbours. Most people stayed in bed, read, wrote and often prayed.… Ekirch found that references to the first and second sleep started to disappear during the late 17th Century. This started among the urban upper classes in northern Europe and over the course of the next 200 years filtered down to the rest of Western society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Staying up all night learning Torah is, well, hard. Especially, it's not conducive to a good <em>shacharis</em> (for those who say <em>shacharis</em> right after; <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/1381\">not all do</a>). I'm wondering whether there's any evidence of the custom having been to learn instead of only the first sleep (but to sleep the second sleep), or to learn instead of only the second sleep (but to sleep the first). Or whether, on the contrary, the custom has very clearly always been to learn instead of both sleeps.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.catholic.org/health/story.php?id=44889\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article about that Ekirch book</a>, coffee was one of the reasons the custom of second-sleep ended.  In <a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/2012/1053/Shavuot_To-Go_-_5771_Rabbi_Schein.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article about the history of the tikkun leil Shavuot custom (pdf)</a>, Rabbi Dr. Schein attributes coffee as one of the factors for staying up all night on Shavuot.</p>\n\n<p>Also in the Schein article, however, he also attributes the custom of the tikkun leil Shavuot to the growing custom of <em>tikkun chatzot</em> (awaking at midnight to mourn for the Temple).  This <em>tikkun chatzot</em> sounds a lot like first- and second-sleep behavior to me.</p>\n\n<p>However, Rabbi Dr. Schein goes on to say: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a fascinating article, Elliot Horowitz also credits the introduction of coffee for the spread of the\n  custom of staying awake at night. In the 15th century, the drinking of coffee originated in Yemenite\n  Sufi circles in order that they could stay awake for their nocturnal rituals, and by the end of the 16th\n  century coffee had spread throughout the Muslim world. Horowitz points out that both coffee and\n  the custom of tikkun hazot spread westward from Sefat to Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Horowitz article he cites is \"Coffee, coffeehouses, and the nocturnal rituals of early modern Jewry\", <em>AJS Review</em>, 1989, pp.17-46.  I assume that that would be a better source for your question that the Schein article is.</p>\n\n<p>Another source cited in the Schein article is: Moshe Hallamish, <em>Kabbalah in Liturgy, Halakah and Customs</em>, Ramat Gan: Bar Ian University, 2000, pgs. 595ff.  This might also help you out by tracing the history of the Tikkun Leil Shavuot.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, Rambam in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910344/jewish/Chapter-Four.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchot De'ot 4</a>:4, he talks about what seems like eight continuous hours of sleep, which implies that \"second sleep\" was unknown to him (especially since he doesn't emphasize that they are continuous).</p>\n\n<p>So maybe this is less than an answer but more than a comment.</p>\n\n\n",

When G-d banishes Adam v'Chava from Gan Eden He explains to them that they're going to live a life of turmoil and pain. And this happens mdor v'dor, till the flood and even after, man is corrupt without his once blunt connection to Hashem. As we read on throughout the Torah, eventually the Yidden receive the Torah from Har Sinai, which gave us a glimpse of the heavenly spheres, and the ability to correct the mistake Adam Rishon made, and allows us to take from the Tree of Life: The Torah. \"It's a tree of life to those that hold to it- and all of its supportors are happy.\" It's part of the Torah for man to live in pain without connection to shamayim, from his origins. He is disconnected, which is the cause of eventual death. Through the Torah, we are able to link life with shamayim and Hashem once again- and the Torah and Hashem are eternal, and the Etz Chayim grants man eternal life. </p>\n\n\n",

It is treated by Musar-givers throughout the world as though it is the most important virtue after fear of Heaven. But what is it based on? There are many Mitzvoth requiring us to give. But it usually is a minor financial sacrifice, often based upon one's means: give an animal sacrifice; give Ma'aser; give half a Shekel. Even when one is told to put forth physical effort, it is along the lines of helping in a way that isn't self-detrimental: help your enemy's donkey with its burden; help your fellow who is being attacked (though we are not required to endanger our own lives for this); help your brothers in arms (although you'd potentially be putting yourself in harm's way, it's also in your own self-interest to be a part of the military unit protecting the people - including your own family).</p>\n\n<p>But is there a Mitzvah - or at least a source in Pesukim - that putting one's own interests aside to accomplish something greater, even if it requires self-sacrifice, great effort, or some heavy loss, is a virtue, let alone the great virtue that it is so often said to be?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>To start with, there is the commandment in the Torah (Deut. 6:5): ואהבת את ה' אלקיך...  ובכל נפשך ובכל מאדך (\"You shall love Hashem your G-d... with all of your soul and with all of your might\"), which the Mishnah (Berachos 54a) explains to mean, \"even if He is taking your soul away,\" and \"with all of your money.\" In a halachic context this is cited in Sanhedrin 74a, as the source for the idea that certain mitzvos - the Gemara there applies it specifically to idol worship* - are not to be transgressed even at the cost of one's life or one's finances. This is codified as halachah by Rambam, Hil.

This halacha is not mentioned in Shulchan Aruch, but is cited by numerous responsa.The poskim debate whether the law applies if the non-Jew sells for cheaper. Rama (Responsa #10) cites this law to give priority to an edition of the Rambam printed by Maharam Padua over a competing, cheaper edition printed by a non-Jew. He understands from the Gemara (B.M. 71a; Pesachim 21b) that the law applies even when there is a price difference between the two and there will be a loss in buying from the Jew.On the other hand, some achronim argue that this law is only \"proper advice\" (Korban Ha'eda on Toras Kohanim). A number of others maintain that it applies only when there is no price differential (Maharsham in Mishpat Shalom C.M. 189). Maharam Shick (C.M. #31) also maintains that a businessman does not need to buy from a Jewish supplier who is more expensive, but should do so if it is only an issue of convenience.</p>\n\n<p>Dayan Y.Y. Weiss zt\"l leans towards differentiating between a small price difference, in which case you should patronize the Jewish store, and a large price difference, in which case you are not required to suffer a loss. [This is also the understanding of the Chofetz Chaim (Ahavas Chesed 5:6-7) in the opinion of the Rama.] However, Minchat Yitzchak concludes that if the small Jewish storeowner will be driven out of business and lose his livelihood, there is a greater need to support him, even if there is a significant price difference, if the customer can afford it. \nThus, Rabbi Lebowitz concluded that according the Maharsham and other achronim mentioned above, there is no requirement to patronize the Jewish business if it more expensive. However, it is meritorious to follow this middle position and patronize the Jewish business if it costs only slightly more, and certainly if it is only an issue of convenience, as mentioned above, in the name of the Maharam Shick.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that we can try and draw across to selling a house. You probably are not obliged to lose money for selling to a Jew. You should probably be willing to suffer a small loss for the sake of selling to a Jew and helping him/her. IF this Jew is struggling to find a place to live, that should influence you to be willing to lose MORE money.</p>\n\n\n",

However, I cannot seem to find information regarding it.  Can someone please explain to me what it is and back it up with sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Try <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380568/jewish/Shattered-Vessels.htm\">this article</a> at Chabad.org, which quotes (in translation) the classic sources on the subject.</p>\n\n<p>Briefly, it's the idea that Hashem first created the ten sefiros as the \"world of Tohu,\" as independent entities, where each one is is exclusively \"thus and no other way\" - i.e., chesed (\"kindness\") is pure chesed, gevurah (\"severity\") is pure gevurah, etc.; each one was so intense that it left no room for any of the others. This intensity caused them to \"shatter\" the \"vessels\" containing them, in much the same way that an intense light can damage one's eyes (which are the human \"vessels\" for the power of sight), or a loud noise the ear, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The fragments of these spiritual \"vessels,\" each of which was an expression of G-d's power and energy, are scattered throughout our world; these are the \"sparks of holiness\" often spoken of in Kabbalah and Chassidus, which it is our job to elevate by using for holy purposes the resources containing those \"sparks.\"</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards Hashem re-created the sefiros as the \"world of Tikkun,\" in which each of them connects to and contains aspects of the others, much as atoms of different kinds combine to form the types of matter that we're familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>The article cited above ends with this point:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The shattering of the sefirot of Tohu is not a coincidence, nor does it signify a flaw in the creative process. On the contrary, it serves a very specific and important purpose, which is to bring about a state of separation or partition of the light into distinct qualities and attributes, and thereby introduce diversity and multiplicity into creation, as explained above. In addition, the shattering of the vessels of Tohu allows for the possibility of evil, and gives man the opportunity to choose between good (for which he gains reward) and evil (for which he is punished). Thus G-d's attributes of chesed and gevura - the attributes from which reward and punishment derive - are revealed in the world, which is one of the primary purposes of creation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rashi there, citing Sifri, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9935/showrashi/true#v16\">states</a> that this was</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>to atone for [uncleanness caused by] a grave in the depths [i.e., an unknown grave which may lie in the earth over which people unknowingly pass, rendering them unclean],which is a [case of] uncertain contamination.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But in his commentary to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9911/showrashi/true#v17\">Lev. 10:17</a>, he points out (citing Sifra) that the sin offering that Aharon's sons burned (instead of eating it) must have been the one brought in honor of Rosh Chodesh, since Moshe identifies it as an offering brought \"to gain forgiveness for the sin of the community,\" and Nachshon's offering was not brought for purpose of atonement.</p>\n\n<p>[The sin offering of Rosh Chodesh is meant to atone for cases where \"there was no knowledge [of being impure] at either the beginning [before entering the Beis Hamikdash or eating sacred food] or at the end [after having done so]\" (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=87339&rid=9581\">Rambam, Hil. Shegagos 11:9</a>, from Shevuos 2a).]</p>\n\n<p>So in that case, isn't Nachshon's offering indeed for purposes of atonement - indeed, it is largely similar to what's covered by the Rosh Chodesh offering?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19148&pgnum=204\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maskil LeDavid on Rashi in Vayikra 10:17</a> asks the same question. He says that we must say that all the sin offerings were coming to atone for something, that's the nature of a sin offering. Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9911/showrashi/true#v16\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vayikra 10:16</a>) tells us that 3 sin offerings were brought that day, and the Maskil LeDavid explains what they were for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>“[Take] a he-goat [as a sin-offering]” (Lev. 9:3)</strong> -- To atone for the sale of Yosef</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>the he-goat of Nahshon [the son of Aminadab, leader of the tribe of Judah] (Num. 7:16)</strong> - to atone for possible impurity from hidden corpses</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>the he-goat [of the additional offering] of Rosh Chodesh.</strong> -- to atone for entering the Mikdash or eating holy things in a state of impurity.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Maskil LeDavid explains that Rashi is telling us that how we know that it was Rosh Chodesh offering that was not eaten. The term used is \"לָשֵׂאת אֶת עֲוֹן הָעֵדָה\" which is used only used in context with Tummat Kodshim. </p>\n\n<p>He explains that when Rashi says only the Rosh Chodesh offering comes to atone, he is referring to an atonement for certain impurity (as implied by the wording in the verse, This excludes Nachshon's offering). [This seems to say that the Maskil LeDavid holds that Rashi differed with the Rambam and held that the Rosh Chodesh offering was an atonement for certain impurity, not possible impurity. - He says that Rashi implies this in his commentary to Zevachim 120, but a quick scan didn't show me what he was referring to.] </p>\n\n<p>He concludes that while Rashi may seem to agree with this in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=29&daf=120&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zevachim 120</a>, it is tough to learn that that is what Rashi is saying here. This however, fits well with the Torat Kohanim's words. </p>\n\n\n",

This is intended to be used by the wife to encourage the giving of a <em>get</em>.</p>\n\n<p>His version of the agreement has received the approval <em><a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inter_alios\" rel=\"noreferrer\">inter alios</a></em> of Rabbis <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovadia_Yosef\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ovadia Yosef</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedalia_Dov_Schwartz\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gedalia Dov Schwartz</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershel_Schachter\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hershel Schachter</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalman_Nechemia_Goldberg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zalman Nechemiah Goldberg</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osher_Weiss\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Osher Weiss</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Lamm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Norman Lamm</a>, Yitzchok Liebes, as well as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbinical_Council_of_America\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbinical Council of America</a>.

If so, why? Is there a different variation they would find acceptable?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>See the Fall 2010 issue of Tradition, with the article entitled \"A Marital Agreement to Mediate\" by R. David Joseph Mescheloff and also the letters section of the Spring 2011 issue, with letters by R. Howard Jachter and the author. The dispute is whether R. Moshe Feinstein and R. Soloveitchik supported the use of prenuptial agreements (according to R. Mescheloff, they both opposed them). It also seems that some of the rabbis on the list cited in the question subsequently withdrew their support (specifically R. Zalman Nechemiah Goldberg).  </p>\n\n<p>Many of the standard objections to prenups fall along the lines of the statement from R. Shaul Yisraeli quoted in the article:</p>\n\n<p>...R. Shaul Yisraeli protested vigorously against prenuptial agreements: “All\nsorts of contractual arrangements whose purpose is not the financial undertaking\n[itself], but rather the pressure and the coercion applied to the husband, due to\nthe payments, so that he will agree to divorce—all of these are a waste of effort,\nfor all agree that the law of an [illegitimately] coerced get applies to this [i.e., a get\ndelivered on account of such pressure]”...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Thirty two years ago I gathered material for an article I never brought myself to write.  The RCA had not yet endorsed pre-nuptual agreements that require mandatory arbitration through a bais din and, in fact, were on the record opposing such agreements.  In 1954, following the drafting of such an agreement by Conservative Rabbi Saul Lieberman, the RCA went on attack with a halachic criticism by Rabbi Norman Lamm (\"Recent Additions to the Ketubah -- a Halachic Critique,\" 2(1) Tradition 93 (1959)), and on the legal side with a monograph by my friend Prof. A. Leo Levin and Meyer Kramer (\"New Provisions in the Ketubah -- a Legal Opinion,\" 1955).  Positions were dramatically altered by 1982, when Orthodoxy's super-lawyer, Nat Lewin, was litigating Avitzur v. Avitzur, which in 1983 resulted in a famous decision by the New York Court of Appeals (NY's highest court), favoring manditory arbitration.  From what I understand, all RCA rabbis require such a pre-nuptual agreement.  My daughter was married by a well-known Young Israel rabbi who did not require the pre-nup (nor even mentioned it).  For more information, see Rabbi Michael Broyde's interesting article at <a href=\"http://www.mishpat.ac.il/files/650/3610/3622/3623.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mishpat.ac.il/files/650/3610/3622/3623.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I am aware of two lines of reasoning given for objecting. One applies specifically to the pre-nup version, which is signed, or at least agreed to, before the marriage has been performed.</p>\n\n<p>The first, which I have heard quoted in the name of the Chazon Ish, is a more technical halachic argument. The objection is that such an arrangement is tantamount to <em>mesiras moda'ah</em> on the <em>kiddushin</em>, essentially a statement by the bride-to-be that she does not agree to be bound to this marriage, and is therefore insisting to have a back-door way out.</p>\n\n<p>The second, which I heard from Rabbi Dovid Orlofsky, is more of a hashkafic point. The objection is that, halachically valid or not, a pre-nup, or post-nup for that matter, undermines the model of a marriage. The Torah designed marriage in such a way that the husband is responsible for, and in control, of the relationship. (In the presentation, Rabbi Orlofsky explained why that would be the desired nature of the relationship, but that's beyond the scope of this discussion.) Anything which unbalances that relationship is essentially ripping the guts out of Jewish marriage.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam (sefer hamitzvos 6, and elsewhere) explains that tefilah (meaning specifically shmonah esrei) is an avodah. The purpose is to serve Hashem, not ourselves. We are having a convesation with Hashem about the ways in which we hope he will interact with the world. Even what may sound like personal bakashos (requests) are tied back into our desire to be able to serve our creator to the best of our abilities and so we ask for forgiveness or understanding not to fulfill a personal need, but as a way for us to be better avdei Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore we don't daven for children, spouses, parents or any other relationship (why don't we daven for a good Rebbi?!) because our focus needs to be how we can serve God and how creation as a whole yearns to be connected to him. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Tur in siman 112 brings an agada that says all the brachos in shmona esrei are paralleling something that happened in this nations past.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Avraham was saved from the fire, the angels said magen avraham.

If a court is divided, the Halacha follows the majority. If the majority of an animal's neck was slaughtered, it is kosher. If the majority of the world is not sterile, we legally assume any given individual not to be sterile. And most directly relevant to this discussion - if a non-kosher piece of meat gets mixed up with a majority of identical but kosher pieces of meat, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=514&hilite=\">all of them may be consumed</a> according to the letter of the law.</p>\n\n<p>This being the case, why do we say that flavor can ever <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=460\">render something unkosher</a>? There is always a majority of kosher substance in the mixture!</p>\n\n<p>The answer, explains the Ra'avad (quoted by the Rashba to Chullin 89b ד\"ה אמר), is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי אמרינן חד בתרי בטיל מדאורייתא דוקא דקיימא איסורא באפי נפשה והיתירא\n  באפי נפשיה כגון גיד בין הגידים וביצה בין הבצים שההיתר לא קיבל טעם מן\n  האיסור, וכיון דאיסורא לא מנכרא בטל ברוב, אבל כשקבל ההיתר טעם האיסור\n  נעשה הכל איסור שהרי ניכר הוא וידוע בכל ההיתר וכו', אבל כל היתר שמקבל\n  טעם האיסור וטעם האיסור ניכר בו, טעימתו זו היא הכרתו כדכתיב וחיך אוכל\n  יטעם לו, אין חשיבות האוכל אלא בטעמו כו</p>\n  \n  <p>When do we say 'one in two is nullified' according to the Torah? Only\n  when the forbidden item is by itself and the permitted item is by\n  itself... since the prohibited item is not discernible it is nullified\n  by the majority. But when the permitted item acquires flavor from the\n  prohibited item the entire thing becomes prohibited because it IS\n  discernible and known throughout the entire permitted item...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The key point is that having one part nullified by the majority is only possible when the one part is not currently discernible. Since there is flavor, the whole concept falls apart.</p>\n\n<p>This idea is the basis for all Halachos of transference of flavor. Anytime we say that something 'became' not kosher because it was cooked in a non-kosher pot etc. we are in essence saying that there is a small amount of non-kosher flavor that was transferred during the cooking process from the walls of the pot and into the food. It used to be that they'd have a non-Jew come and taste the food to tell if he could discern any non-kosher flavor. For a number of reasons this stopped, and as a matter of doubt <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=461\">we normally require 60 parts kosher to 1 part non-kosher</a> to be able to assume that no significant amount of flavor was transferred.</p>\n\n<p>[A relevant, side consideration: If you have two items which taste the same that were cooked together, while according to Biblical Law the kosher item would remain kosher since the non-kosher flavor is not truly discernible, Rabbinic Law (according to the conclusion of the Talmud <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=462\">as interpreted by most Rishonim</a>) requires 60:1 - since there was real, full-fledged flavor transferred and it just isn't discernible do to another consideration - i.e. the thing receiving the flavor already tastes that way.]</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above, one can correctly conclude that in cases where there certainly was no significant flavor transfer (due to the inherent lack of flavor of the non-kosher item), no amount of cooking together or 'cross-contamination' will render something not kosher. This is the basis for the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=468\">Shulchan Aruch and Rema</a>'s ruling (previously cited by @YDK) that 'non-kosher' bones do not render something not kosher even when cooked together.</p>\n\n<p>I believe it is quite clear that cutlery and dishes made out of elephant tusks fall into this category. There is not the slightest chance that you will taste any significant elephant flavor in your food. Therefore they pose no kashrus concerns.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This was going to be a comment on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16769/5\">YDK's answer</a>, until I realized there is more that is relevant to the original question than just a comment on that answer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=468\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh De'ah 99:1</a> seems to tell us that bones of Isur cannot make another food Asur; in fact, they can be combined with other Heter to nullify the Isur that they are being cooked with.

So when I started <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=469\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">99:2</a>, I was surprised - the Halachah seems to be that bones do <em>absorb</em> Isur. What does that mean, then, for them being placed into Heter? Do they make it Asur? Yes, this is the original question, but 99:1 no longer answers it alone in light of 99:2.</p>\n\n<p>I think there is still an answer here that can be gleaned from 99:1, however.  The bones themselves are not Asurim.  In fact, they can be combined with Heter to nullify Isur.  However, they are not impervious to being made \"Treif\" themselves.  Thus, one needs to be sure, like in all other Keilim, that no Isur was cooked with them alone, ie., no part of the elephant was cooked with the tusks in fashioning the ivory into a food-utensil.</p>\n\n\n",

Torah rules even more so.  Many were written to separate Jews from other ancient Near Eastern peoples.  Is this an example of one: did the Jews' neighbors literally place stumbling blocks before blind persons?  Even if there's no external historical evidence of this, are there Talmudic references to these practices of non-Jews or pre-Jews (or G-d forbid, of Jews)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While the rules were written in the way that they were for a reason, that reason doesn't necessarily mean that people actually <em>placed stumbling blocks before the blind</em>, that could just be a concise and precise way for the Torah to express the idea of misleading someone. (I wrote about that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/30481/why-is-the-torah-so-misleading-without-the-oral-law/38868#38868\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/38763/why-does-halacha-not-follow-the-simple-reading-of-the-biblical-text/38870#38870\">here</a>.) The reason for these kinds of phrases may be to differentiate the Torah from other Near Eastern people (as <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/ten-daat/sokolow-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> posits), but it might also just be using the language of it's time and place. (See <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23507132\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, if you can access it, in the discussion of line no. 9). @josh waxman <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2008/05/kedoshim-do-not-curse-deaf.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shows here</a> that this is how the Ibn Ezra and Shadal have interpreted the phrase, as a common idiom. </p>\n\n<p>By the way, though, it should be noted that the Ramah (that's R. Meir Abulafia, in Yad Ramah to Bava Basra daf 26 - letter 107) suggests that this verse in its literal interpretation does have halakhic validity in that it's the source for the prohibition to cause damage to another person (or another person's property). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think that it is fair to say that actually placing a physical stumbling block in front of blind people is not something that used to happen. If this had been a regular occurance, then the negative mitzvah not to do it would be interpreted as prohibiting a very specific action that the people might otherwise do. The next time they wanted to trip up someone who was blind, they would think to themselves, \"Nope, I can't do that. There's a mitzvah against it.\"  Meanwhile, the mitzvah would not come to mind before someone gave an unwary tourist bad directions (because he hates tourists, or something like that).</p>\n\n<p>If, however, putting stumbling blocks before the blind was not something that literally used to happen, the mitzvah has the analogical meaning with which we associate it (which, of course, also literally prohibits putting stumbling blocks before the blind).</p>\n\n<p>So unless you would argue that the mitzvah refers <i>only</i> to literally tripping people who are blind, it's fair to say that this was not something that actually happened.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>have you never witnessed someone trip another while they were unaware?

    "content": "# How were זכור and שמור said together?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49625&st=&pgnum=90&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishnah Berurah (271:3)</a>, it says that the word זכור from \"זכור את יום השבת לקדשו\" of the first Aseres Hadibros, and the word שמור from \"שמור את יום השבת לקדשו\" of the second Aseres Hadibros were said בדבור אחד (\"simultaneously\" for lack of a better word). Similarly, we say the same in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lekhah_Dodi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lecha Dodi song</a> in Kabalas Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>But how can this be? At least according to Rabbi Tanchum bar Chanilai who was told in the name of Shmuel bar Nachum (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%91%D7%90_%D7%A7%D7%9E%D7%90_%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bava Kamma 55a</a>), it appears that the first dibros written in the Torah (in Shemos) were written on the first tablets and the second (in Devarim) were written on the second tablets.</p>\n\n<p>So how were they mentioned together?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>On a less miraculous note, the ibn Ezra (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&st=&pgnum=298\">Shemos 20:1</a>)rejects a literal reading of the chazal that shamor and zachor were said simultaneously.  In a lengthy piece, he promotes the idea that words embody meaning and when there is a quote of someone where words are added to the quote, or changed, this is not a contradiction.  The quote is merely elaborating on what the speaker meant and was embodied by his words.</p>\n\n<p>The ibn Ezra holds that Hashem only said one thing, as it is written word for word in Shemos- \"Zachor\".  The implication is to remember which day is shabbos so that you may guard the commandments.  When Moshe repeated the dibros in Devarim, he did not repeat word for word (\"kadevarim\"), rather he added or changed to explain the words more.  One of the changes he made was to explain the endgame of zachor, which is shamor.</p>\n\n<p>So when chazal say shamor and zachor were said as one word, they meant that the word zachor, which was said, embodies the idea of shamor, which was subsequently verbalized by Moshe.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16283/showrashi/true#v12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tehilim 62:12</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>God spoke one thing, I heard two, for God has strength.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...our Sages interpreted it as referring to [the maxim that] “Remember” and “Keep” were stated in a single utterance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9881/showrashi/true#v8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi Shemot 20:8</a>.

If so, why does the Torah say again, “I am [the Lord, your God (verse 2)]” and “You shall have no…” (verse 3)?

So the case there is that they place vertical stakes in the ground, each within three tefachim of the next. (The previous mishnah describes the opposite case - where they string horizontal ropes whose aggregate thickness is more than a tefach, and place them within three tefachim of each other, thus creating a partition ten tefachim tall - the minimum for it to be valid.)</p>\n\n<p>Today's eruvin use instead a series of <em>tzuras hapesach</em>, doorframes (a pair of vertical poles, such as utility poles, and a horizontal crossbeam or wire atop them), which halachically can be considered walls.

Shabbos 16:16.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted, though, that Rambam would not accept most present-day city eruvin, because he understands the Gemara there to be saying that in any eruv that doesn't use <em>lavud</em> as its operating principle, there must be more filled-in space than open space (e.g., for an eruv whose perimeter is 2 miles, the material for the partitions must have an aggregate width of over one mile). <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40431&st=&pgnum=546\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 362:10</a> cites other opinions that this is not necessary, and it is those opinions that those who make and use city eruvin follow.

I know there is an idea of a chaasan going to shul from <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21858&pgnum=109\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Pirkei d'Reb Eliezer 17</a> but how did it get split betweeen the Askenazim and Sefardim.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The reason for the aufruf, the calling to the torah before the wedding, is unknown to most people and therefore not kept properly. The  <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41327&st=&pgnum=17\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toras Hashlomim</a> on Yore Daioh 192:4 suggests the following reason which requires some background understanding.</p>\n\n<p>A woman before marriage has to go to mikva even if she has already been recently and is not yet a niddah again, because of a rule called \"dam chimud\" where the gemara assumes a woman who is proposed to, will become a niddah due to the excitement. The Toras Hashlomim suggests that the aufruf is designed so that the woman will feel secure that the wedding is really going ahead, because since the husband invests effort and expense in a small party he will not afterwards jilt her. This way, she will feel secure during the week that the wedding will go ahead and not come to have the issue of \"dam chimud\"  when the wedding actually does go through. This is undesirable as some Rishonim (notably the Rambam) hold that nissuin cannot take place if she is a niddah.</p>\n\n<p>So according to this reasoning, one should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>invest a significant amount of time/money/effort into the aufruf.</p></li>\n<li><p>have the aufruf (or at least invest some of the time/money/effort) at least 7 days before the wedding (so that the women has time to purify herself before the wedding). I note that many years ago, Friday afternoon weddings were common so as to only have to make one big meal, which makes the appropriate time for the Aufruf in those days to be the Shabbat immediately prior to that Friday since on the erev shabbos of the aufruf they prepared for it.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Biur Halacha (136) provides a list of individuals who take precedence for aliyot. Among them he lists a groom on the Shabbos before his wedding and a groom on the Shabbos after his wedding. Based on this, the standard practice is to call a groom up to the Torah on both the Shabbos before and after his wedding.</p>\n\n<p>Among Ashkenazim the Shabbos before is celebrated as the Aufruf, seemingly because the Biur Halacha indicates that in order to create a real obligation for the groom to be called to the Torah the community should sing celebratory songs to the groom.</p>\n\n<p>As for the Sfradic practice to celebrate the Shabbos following the wedding, this probably stems from the idea that a groom is like a king and should not be seen in public without an entourage.</p>\n\n<p>For a more thorough treatment of this subject (with footnotes) see <a href=\"http://torahmusings.com/2011/08/aufruf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aufruf by Rabbi Ari Enken</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's not pleasant, but I've heard one scholar indicate there are sources that the original Ashkenazic custom was to make a big announcement of the wedding in advance to make sure this fellow doesn't already have a wife out there who's unaware of what he's doing.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does p'shat explain everything?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/14750\">Ways of reading <em>Chumash</em> are commonly divided into four headings: <em>p'shat</em>, simple readings; <em>d'rash</em>, exegeses; <em>remez</em>, hints; and <em>sod</em>, secrets.</a> The <em>g'mara</em> and <em>midr'she halacha</em> are full of <em>d'rash</em>: they engage in <em>diyuk</em>, nitpicking, paying careful attention to each word, asking why each word appears where it does. It is commonly said about that that there are no extraneous words in <em>chumash</em>; for example, because Biblical Hebrew sometimes omits \"<em>es</em>\", the accusative-case marker, <a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=686\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a <em>tana</em> derived something from every single <em>es</em> in <em>Chumash</em></a>. But that's all at the level of <em>d'rash</em>. My question is, what about <em>p'shat</em>? That is, is it true that there is a <em>p'shat</em>-level explanation for every nuanced wording change, for every <em>diyuk</em>? (For example, can every presence or absence of \"<em>es</em>\" be explained in terms of cadence, unambiguity, or other <em>p'shat</em>-level concerns?) Or does <em>P'shat</em> (my made-up personification of <em>p'shat</em>) sometimes (perhaps often) simply throw up her hands and say \"it just is that way, I don't have to have a reason; try asking <em>D'rash</em>\"?</p>\n\n<p>Sourced answers strongly preferred.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It depends on what one defines as pshat. I would say that many meforshei Rashi (Gur Aryeh as an example) assume that Rashi is <strong>always</strong> (or most often) saying peshat, even as he brings downs thousands of midrashim. And so, the sorts of difficulties / irregularities encountered in derash are precisely those which must be addressed in peshat.</p>\n<p>However, other proponents of peshat (to whom I personally incline) will simply assert that these represent the natural variance of language, idioms, etc., such that one should not make a diyuk. See Ibn Ezra on parashat Yitro regarding the aseret hadibrot, at length, on this. part <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2011/01/ibn-ezra-on-aseres-hadibros-part-i.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">one</a>, <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2011/01/ibn-ezra-on-aseres-hadibros-part-ii.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">two</a>, <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2011/01/ibn-ezra-on-aseres-hadibros-part-iii.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">three</a>, and <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2011/01/ibn-ezra-on-aseres-hadibros-part-iv.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">four</a>. From part three:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And know that the words {lexical items} are like bodies and the meanings are like souls, and the body is as a vessel to the soul. Therefore, the rule of all the scholars of every language is to guard to meanings and not pay particular heed to changes in the words, since they are identical in their meaning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And many others you will find with different words, yet the meaning is identical. And as I said to you that sometimes they choose the short way and sometimes the long way, sometimes that will add a helping letter or to omit it, while the meaning is the same.</p>\n<p>Hashem said: And techelet and argaman; and Moshe said: techelet and argaman.\nHashem said: Avnei shoham; and Moshe said: and avnei shoham.</p>\n<p>And there are many like these, and both of them are correct. For the Scripture without the vav chose the short way, and does no damage. Also the Scripture with the vav does no damage, since it added so as to explain. And behold, the vav, which appears in the pronunciation of the mouth, no man seeks for himself a reason why it is missing and why it is written, and why it is added. For both this and that are correct. And behold, it is apparent that the one who pronounces it would not seek upon it, when written, a reason. If so, why should we seek a reason for the omission of that which is not even pronounced. Such as, in the word le'olam, why it is written plene (with a vav) or deficient (without)? And if we were to seek a reason for only one of them (malei or chaser), or if the general custom was to write all of them in one way (malei or chaser), I would have remained silent.</p>\n<p>And behold, I will give you an allegory. A person says to you, \"Write to my friend, and this is what you should write: I, Ploni love you forever.\" And he writes Ploni, פלני, without the vav {which is acceptable in Hebrew}, and אהבך, 'I love you', also without the vav. And לעלם, \"forever\" also chaser. {In each case you can have a cholam chaser as opposed to a cholam malei.} And then Reuven comes and asks me, \"why did you write them deficiently {chaser}? And meanwhile, I only have need to write that which he said to me, and I have no desire that they be either malei or chaser. Perhaps Levi will come and inform me how I shall write. I do not wish to go on at length. Rather, the intelligent person will understand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, Ibn Ezra does not feel that one should make such diyukim on the level of peshat. Read inside to see if Ibn Ezra would then say that one should then turn to derash for the true interpretation.</p>\n\n\n",

Being associated with bad signs, the eclipse\nwas not assigned a bracha. [...] During an eclipse, we witness the\npowerful, constant light and energy of the sun being diminished. Or\nthe light of a full moon paling to a feeble glow. In both cases, we\ncan read the chilling reminder that it is in G-d's Hands as to whether\nwe live in light or suffer in darkness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, brachot are still made on earthquakes, thunderstorms, and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/9639/1516\">winds strong enough to shatter stones and mountains</a>. Surely these events are also chilling reminders that it is in G-d's Hands as to whether we live, suffer, or die. They threaten our individual, if not our collective existence, in a much more concrete way than any eclipse. Surely that much was known even in the time of our Sages.</p>\n<p>So why make a bracha on these dangerous events, but not on an eclipse? Is the essential difference that the eclipse threatens our existence as a human race, whereas the others only threaten us as individuals? What of the fact that it is actually G-d, not the sun, Who gives us life?</p>\n<p>EXTRA CREDIT: <strong>Why make a bracha on a rainbow but not on an eclipse?</strong> Rainbows are also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/10065/759\">considered a \"bad omen,\"</a> and yet we make a bracha on them. In 'light' of that fact, why don't we also make a bracha on an eclipse? Does it just come down to \"Because Chaza\"l said so?\" (Thanks to Double AA for pointing out this aspect.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>My own thoughts. Eclipses are predictable and can be calculated in advance to the moment where it will happen and when it will happen. However hurricanes and earthquakes, no one can predict that a hurricnane or earthquake will happen at this precise moment in a year from now.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Regarding the difference between rainbows and eclipses, the beracha on rainbows is a specific invocation of the covenant which they symbolize in the Torah: זוכר הברית ונאמן בבריתו וקיים במאמרו. It is not a generic blessing on natural phenomena, i.e., עושה מעשה בראשית. Even though rainbows are considered a negative symbol, they nevertheless invoke this positive covenant. However, an eclipse is considered a negative omen, but it is not associated with a positive covenant. Thus we can understand why they wouldn't receive a blessing.</p>\n<p>An earthquake is a frightening experience but that is no reason for it not to receive a blessing; on the contrary, the beracha of שכחו וגבורתו מלא עולם expresses our experience of God's might through the earthquake. It is specifically a curse which does not receive a blessing. For a similar idea, the Mishnah says that אין מפסיקין בקללות, i.e. we do not divide the Torah reading of the Tochachah. One opinion in the Gemara (Megillah 31b) explains that this is because we don't make a blessing specifically on the reading of the curses: רֵישׁ לָקִישׁ אָמַר לְפִי שֶׁאֵין אוֹמְרִים בְּרָכָה עַל הַפּוּרְעָנוּת.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It’s hard to claim that the reason there’s no bracha on a solar eclipse is because it’s predestined, since the location of the sun in the sky is also predestined, yet we say <em>birkas hachama</em>.<br />\nI heard some people suggest that no Bracha is recited since it’s a bad omen. Yet by a rainbow we do make a bracha. That bracha, however, isn't on beauty of rainbow (in which case it would have been “<em>Oseh Maiseh Bireishis</em>”), but rather a bracha on remembering the bris, which is an entirely different type of bracha.<br />\nOne can also say its dangerous to look at an eclipse, and Chazal didn’t misaken “<em>Oseh Maiseh Bireishis</em>” on something a person shouldn't look at.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Chatzi LaHashem\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've been having this discussion with my friends and family about the Halacha of dividing Yom Tov into Chatzi LaHashem (half of the day devoted to prayer and learning) and Chatzi Lachem (half of the day devoted to eating, drinking, etc.).  Do you know why so many people don't do this today?  The Halacha is brought down in the Shulchan Aruch (529:1 with Mishna Berura 1, and Rambam, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=3&hilchos=15&perek=6&halocha=19&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Laws of Yom Tov, 6:19</a>).  They each state that one should wake up early, Daven at sunrise and learn until midday.</p>\n\n<p>This law is stated about Yom Tov in general.  However, it does not appear to me that many actually do this.  I wonder if anyone knows why this is so.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, many have a custom to learn all night on Shavuos.  However, they then go to sleep after eating in the morning.  I wonder how this jives with the law above.  Is it better to learn all night on Shavuos or to follow this law/Minhag?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In order for this halacha to work you need to have a minyan that prays early. That will depend on the will of the tzibur. Which is one obstacle to this halacha.</p>\n\n<p>The halacha also says that they would eat (I'm assuming lightly) after prayers and then go learn. This means the prayers would need to end quickly. Aruch Hashulchan 529:2 immediately after mentioning this halacha complains about Chazanim who elongate the prayers, and adds it's not Chatzi Lashem and not Chatzi lachem (I guess he did not enjoy chazanut). He quotes the gemara that the tefila on Yom Tov needs to finish quickly (Megila 23a). Long davening is the second obstacle.</p>\n\n<p>In my neighborhood we have an early minyan 7-9am, you can have a quick kiddush and learn from 9:15 to 1 and have a beautiful Yom Tov.\nOthers pray 8-11 and do Chatzi lachem till about 4, and learn to the end of Yom Tov.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are a few reasons. One is because most people don't want to get up that early. Two, the \"main\" minyan of most shuls has become quite involved - singing, long mishebeirachs, a drasha from the Rav - these things may add up to an hour to the davening time. So the davening now goes for instance from 8:30-noon. For these people, they are indeed giving Hashem His chazti. They then go home and take theirs.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To answer the second question, I don't think that when Halacha says Chatzi Lashem and Lachem it means you have to have exactly 12 and a half hours for both sides, rather you have to set aside time for both Hashem and yourself to properly enjoy the Holy Yom Tov. It is a way to combine the holy day and what it represents and to enjoy the physicality of this world. Thus, the Minhag was that you learned for half the day and you enjoyed yourself for half the day. However, on Shavuos where we have a special Minhag to learn all night, this still falls into this Halacha by Yom Tov. By learning all night, you are devoting yourself to Hashem and in order to not be tired for the rest of Yom Tov, you take a nap. Once you are up, you eat a lavish meal with your family and fulfill Chatzi Lachem. Plus, the rest of your afternoon is free to learn.       </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was Chassidus controversial?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When Chassidus came about, it was very controversial. The Vilna Gaon even put Chassidim in cherem. What were the reasons for the controversy? And why is there peace and mutual respect today between the Chassidim and Misnagdim? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Depending on who you ask, you may get slightly different answers. This is what I understand, from a mostly historical and Chassidic perspective. (Garnered from R' Yossi Paltiel<sup>1</sup>, Berel Wein<sup>2</sup>, and a bit of Wikipedia<sup>3</sup>.)</p>\n\n<p>The Baal Shem Tov started his teaching not long after the false messiah, Shabtai Tzvi created massive chaos in the Jewish world. Shabtai Tzvi, among many other things, was a kabbalist. The Baal Shem Tov (and the Baal Shems before him) were therefore regarded as <em>highly</em> suspicious due to their teaching kabbalah. Many of their kabbalistic practices and beliefs, although more common among Sephardim (since kabbala was always more accepted among Sephardim), were very foreign to Ashkenazim, and considered heretical. Also, even Misnagdic Kabbalists (e.g., the Vilna Gaon), disagreed about different kabbalistic teachings that the Besh\"t taught. (Even though, AFAIK, the Baal Shem Tov's teachings all had <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/8816/883\">strong basis in Lurianic Kabbala</a>.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit: It is very important to note that the above reasons aren't really the things that Misnagdim disagree on with Chassidim. The Misnagdim did, and do, have <em>ideological</em> disagreements. The above reasons perhaps can explain why the Misnagdim were so suspicious and rejecting of Chassidus, when they otherwise might have just disagreed with, yet accepted, it. See comments below.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The reason for the peace that (B\"H) exists now is due to several different reasons.</p>\n\n<p>First, much of the dispute between Chassidim and Misnagdim (at least after the Maggid) existed in Lithuania and White Russia. Ukraine and Poland were already very Chassidic.</p>\n\n<p>The leading dynasty of that region (to my knowledge) was Chabad. The Alter Rebbe did his best to make sure that there was no negative response from his Chassidim to Misnagdic opposition. His son, the Mitteler Rebbe, made the divide even greater. He told his Chassidim to avoid dealing with Misnagdim at all. Don't daven in their shuls, etc. This allowed tempers to cool, and by the end of the Mitteler Rebbe's leadership, much of the old animosity had disappeared. </p>\n\n<p>Then came the ultimate uniting factor: a common enemy. In this case <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskalah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Enlightenment movement</a> (<em>not</em> to be confused with modern reform, btw). The Enlightenment did their best, through the governments and other means<sup>4</sup>, to forcibly intellectualize Judaism, at the expense of Halacha. The Misnagdim recognized that Chassidism was not what they had thought it was, and the Tzemach Tzedek and R' Itzhele Volozhiner had a close relationship. Together they worked to prevent the government from forcing secular education on orthodox Jewry. (Crucially, this was <em>not</em> that they did not want Jews to be educated in secular subjects, but that it should <em>not</em> come at the expense of Jewish practice and Jewish education (<em>Jewish Life and Learning</em>).)</p>\n\n<p>By this point, the Geonim among the Misnagdim had realized that Chassidus was not heretical, and did not pose a danger as Shabtai Tzvi and Yaakov Frank had, and so the reason for the original disagreement fell away.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If you disagree, or have a correction, please do correct me!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1 Who presents (mostly) the Chassidic perspective. </sup><br>\n<sup>2 Who presents more of a non-Chassidic viewpoint. </sup><br>\n<sup>3 Who knows? </sup><br>\n<sup>4: Including masquerading as orthodox schoolteachers in order to educate orthodox children away from orthodoxy.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Hasidism was not 'controversial.' There indeed was a long battle between Hasidism and the Misnagdim (at the level of street battles and burning of books) but the polemic was just as much about miscommunication as an actual Halakhic difference. So 'controversial' is the wrong word.</p>\n\n<p>The Vila Gaon (GR\"A) was personally opposed to Hasidism, because he believed them to be heretics. Why did he see them in this way? Because they presented a new and innovative form of religious practice. In particular the new forms of prayer (such as somersaulting) and focus on worldly pleasures. Indeed, the Gaon himself was a Hasid-- he was referred to by his disciples as \"Ha-Gaon He-Hasid.\" But he was a different kind of Hasid, related not to Hasidism as we know it today but the medieval Haside Ashkenaz, who were Mystics but focused on (1) asceticism and (2) elitism. The challenge that Hasidism presented was not a new Kabbalistic belief, but its popularization.</p>\n\n<p>The relationship with Sabbatianism: certainly the belief that Hasidism was related to Sabbatianism was due to the fact that the Hasidim were threatening, and as the Jews who would become known as the Misnagdim didn't know much about Sabbatianism except that it was related to mysticism would have confused them and think that there is a causal link. However, just as the Vilna Gaon was a mixture between the concept 'Gaon' and 'Hasid,' so we should also think about the Besht. His beliefs were not the radical Hasidic ideas. The concept of the immanent God (that God is in everything) only reached its apex in the thought of Shneur Zalman of Łiady. The Besht, indeed, was a combination of the new Lurianic ideas but also the old concer of the mystical Baal Shem (a folk healer -- tied to popular religion and superstition). That is also a Kabbalistic idea, but tied to the \"practical\" Kabbalah of Abraham Abulafia (13th century).</p>\n\n<p>The battle between the Hasidim and Misnagdim was only resolved after the death of the Vilna Gaon. In the early 19th century two things happened: first, the Russian government acknowledged the hAsidim, and the Hasidim's attempts to \"conquer the communities\" were highly successful. It really was not related to opposition to the Haskalah -- though the Misnagdim and Hasidim did come into an alliance against the Haskalah in the second half of the 19th century. The establishment of the great yeshiva of Hayyim of Volozhin (1802) created a new kind of environment where Hasidism and Misnagdism could meet. But apeven so there still remained a great religious divide between Misnagdism and Hasidism. Misnagdism essentially believed in a dualistic religious existence -- that this life is transitory to the next, and that we suffer here for the future world to come. Ultimately it was a very pessimistic view on the possibility of human salvation. The Hasidim, on the other hand, believed in a monistic world -- I.e. that one should enjoy the current life, and that salvation (devekuth or mystical union with god-- in medieval terms, unio mystica) is available to the average person.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus we can be quite certain that their statement does not mean that eclipses are results of ill behavior. Rather, an additional result of the celestial positioning that causes an eclipse is that certain people are especially prone to sin and punishment. This is not unlike the Talmudic teaching that people born under certain Zodiac signs are likely to follow certain paths. These factors do not take away of free will, but they do give us a propensity that we can and must overcome.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is why the Talmud (Sukkah 29A) concludes <em>\"But when Israel fulfill the will of the Omnipresent, they need have no fear of all these [omens]\"</em> (translation from <a href=\"http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Sukkah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It doesn't make sense to say that something predictable and cyclical is a bad omen. It's like saying the seasons, which occur every year, are a bad omen. The case of eclipses are just further apart.</p>\n\n<p>The achronim assume Chazal knew what they were talking about when they said מאורות לוקין, and assume that they knew how to predict eclipses (I'm not sure if that's the historical consensus), so they want to give a different explanation of that gemarra.</p>\n\n<p>One is the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14414&st=&pgnum=97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch LeNer Sukkah 29a</a>. He felt the term \"בזמן\", at the time of, was extra. They should have just said when חמה לקה. Rather it's referring to the time period when the eclipses occur.

It's referring to something that sounds like sun spots.

He gives a reason why putting on two garments simultaneously can cause one to forget.</p>\n\n<p>The reason connects physical garments to the spiritual garments of a person, and explains how a person's garments are naturally holy, but by doing sins causes the holy garments to be under the control of the Klipot (forces of impurity). garments surround a person and each garment has a surrounding light (Ohr Makif) that is so high that it cannot be touched by the forces of impurity, thereby shielding the garment itself from the forces of impurity.</p>\n\n<p>When one puts on two garments at once, he leaves no room for the surrounding light between the first and second garment. The garment is therefore vulnerable to Klipot, and Klipot cause forgetfulness, as we know that there is no forgetfulness in the forces of purity and holiness.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, it appears from this that there is no problem with putting on two non-overlapping garments (such as both socks or shoes) at once.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35229&pgnum=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Ha-Ari (S\"K 6)</a> explains the same thing in a more simple way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Talmud (Shabbat 114a) defines a Talmid Chacham as someone who is careful to wear his clothing right-side-in.

The Shulchan Aruch also recommends in Orach Chaim 2:3 that everyone be careful about this, lest people begin to think negatively about each other. The Taz (OC 2 sk 2) and Shulchan Aruch HaRav (OC 2:2) rule that if he already put it on inside-out he does not need to fix it, unless he is a Talmid Chacham where he is in danger of causing people to dislike the Torah.

Hence, \"wear cleaned clothes.\"</p>\n\n<p>Over time, the custom evolved from <em>libunim</em> to <em>levanim</em>; not only must they be clean, but white as well. But there can be cases where a rabbi would rule a woman can wear a light color that wouldn't mask or seriously morph any stains, but would avoid the problem of a penny-sized spot on white garments leading to the status of <em>nida</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

It's their job, they'll do it, and if you also do it you're adding to the obstructions.  As for why Naomi did it anyway, two thoughts: (1) the formal process may not have been so codified then, and (2) that's an awful long journey to make just to be rejected at the end.  I don't think we should take Naomi as a model for how \"regular Jews\" should treat would-be converts today; instead our tradition takes it as a model for how a <em>beit din</em> or rabbis behave.</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps until this point Pharaoh watched Moshe to see which side he would align his loyalties.  In Pharaoh's mind the event of killing the Egyptian reflected that Moshe chose to align himself with Israelites and not the Egyptians.  This was a slap in the face of Pharaoh. </p>\n\n\n",

In that case he says one should be machmir (although even that is not a clear-cut issur).

That is  why if you don't have such a tradition you can rely upon somebody who does, to clarify the reality of the anatomy of the bird. Does it attack or not?

Yosef Qafih). In light of Ari Greenspan's 2012 participation here on the forum, I wonder if @msh210 your question prompted the composition of their essay.</p>\n<p>In the essay it is recorded that R. Yosef Qafih wrote a letter (p. 80) to Ari Greenspan as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כבר פרסמתי רבות בענין הארבה, ולדעתי כיון שאין לשאר עדות מסורת בהן\nלאסור, אלא אין להן מסורת לאכלן כי לא הכירום. <strong>יכולים הם לסמוך על מסורת\nאמת נפוצה מאז משה רבנו ולאכלם</strong> וכבר פרסם ד\"ר זהר עמר חוברת בהוצאת בר\nאילן הארבה ואכילתו במסורת ישראל ושם הפנה לפרסומי על הארבה בכל הכבוד\nהראוי</p>\n<p>I have already publicized many times regarding the matter of locusts\nand in my opinion since the rest of the ‘Edoth  do not have a mesorah\nto prohibit them, rather they simply do not have a mesorah to eat them\nbecause they do not recognize them. <strong>They are permitted to rely on a\nwidespread and authentic/true mesorah since Moshe and to eat them.</strong> And\nDr. Zohar Amar already publicized a volume from Bar Ilan Press on the\nconsumption of locusts among the Jewish people, and there he referred\nto my publications on locusts with all due honors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the periodical, Modiah, Feb 16, 1959, R. Qafih had earlier written:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונראה כי גם אלה שלא נהגו לאכול את הארבה יכולים לסמוך עלינו ועל\nמסורותינו ולחזור לאוכלה בלי שום פקפוק כ\"ש וכ\"ש שאין למחות בידי מחזיקי\nהקבלה והמסורת</p>\n<p>And so it appears that also those that were not accustomed to eating\nlocusts are able to rely on us and on our mesorah and to return to\nconsuming them without any doubt whatsoever and all the more so\ncertainly not to prevent those who strongly hold onto their received\ntradition and mesorah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Kaf ha-Haim stated (Kaf ha-Haim 85:6):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והרבה מקומות יש בספרד שאוכלים אותו... וכן המנהג בתימן שאוכלין אותו\nוא\"כ התימנים ההולכים לעיר אחרת או הבאים לדור בירשת\"ו מותר לאוכלם ע\"פ\nהמסורת שיש בידם</p>\n<p>\"There are many places in Sepharad where they are eaten\"... and so too\nis the custom of Yemen where they eat it and if that is so the\nYemenites that go to a different city or come to Jerusalem may it be\nbuilt and ready, it is permitted to eat them on the basis of the\nmesorah they possess.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This parallels sentiments about kosher fowl identification expressed in the Shakh Y.D. 85 (as cited in Ari Greenspan's answer above), and Rav Moshe Feinstein in Igeroth Moshe  Y.D. 1:34, which are clear in that as long as a species of bird possesses the correct simanim and someone has an active mesorah that it is recognizable as a specific kosher species, then that person may be relied upon and the species may be consumed. However relying upon the name alone is insufficient, as names change across geography/culture/time.</p>\n<p>However as regards locusts, R. Yosef Yedid ha-Lewi was of the opinion that explicit identification by name is an additional requirement for transmission of mesorah (Yeme Yosef Bathra, Y.D. 3):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מקובל להם מסורת זה לא אהניא לן עד שיאמרו שכד נמסר להם שמין זה שמו חגב\nדאל\"כ אולי מה שנמסר להם שאוכלין אותו והוא מין טהור סוברין כהרי\"ף\nדבסימנים סגי ולא בעינן שנדע שיהיה שמו חגב וכן מדוקדק לשון מרן שכתב או\nמסורת ששמו חגב לענין דינא אם נתברר לנו אפילו על פי מסורת הק\"ק בני תימן\nשהם ממדינה אחרת שזה המין אוכלין אותו והוא שמו חגב אז יש לסמוך בפשיטות\nלאוכלו אד אם יעידו סתם שהם מקובל להם שהוא מין טהור ואוכלין אותו אך לא\nידעו ולא נתקבל להם אם שמו חגב או לא אז ודאי אין לסמוך עליהם אך הם מה\nשאוכלין אין למחות בידם</p>\n<p>The mesorah which is accepted by them is not acceptable until they say\nthat it was transmitted to them that this species name is “hagav” for\nif that isn’t the case perhaps that which was transmitted to them such\nthat they eat them in reliance that they are a kosher species is based\non the reasoning of the Ri”f that the simanim alone are sufficient and\nthey do not actually know if its name is hagav, and so if we are\nprecise in the language of Maran who wrote [the Shulhan Arukh, YD 185]\n“or that there is a mesorah that its name is hagav” as regards this\nlaw if it is clarified to us that even if according to the mesorah of\nthe holy community of Yemenites who are from a different territory\nthat this is the species and its name is hagav then certainly we may\nconsume them, however if they generically testify that it is accepted\namong them that this is a kosher species and they do not know and did\nnot receive that its name is hagav or not then certain we may not rely\nupon them, however that which they eat we should not prevent them\nfrom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that according to R. Yedid, that in theory one can recieve a mesorah from Yemenites, however this is with the caveat (based on the SA) that they must also transmit a mesorah that it is known by the name hagav. Without this additional qualifier it is not possible to accept their mesorah, as it may be based solely on simanim. His position does not preclude the possibility therefore of transmitting such a mesorah, it simply establishes an additional required element of such a transmission in order to be effective.</p>\n<p>The Mishnah Halakhoth (16:8) wrote similarly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל לסמוך עליהם אנן ועל עדותן א\"א לן לסמוך שהרי גם הם אין להם מסורת\nשזה הוא הנקרא חגב וכיון שאין להם מסורת שזה נקרא חגב הגם שאוכלין אותו\nמ\"מ א\"א לן לסמוך אקבלתם שהרי צריך להיות במסורת ששמו חגב ואין להם מסורת\nזו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However to rely on them and their testimony we should not rely for\nthey also do not have a mesorah that these locusts are called “hagav”\nand since they do not have such a mesorah that what they eat is called\nhagav and in any event we should not rely on them since it is\nnecessary that there be a mesorah that the species is called hagav and\nthey do not have such a mesorah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this view then, the Yemenites lack a mesorah that the locusts they consume are explicitly known by the name hagav. Presumably this position is open to refutation where Yemenites present themselves as in possession of a mesorah for the name hagav as well (as for example expressed in Teshubhoth Rav Qafih, vol. 1, p. 48).</p>\n<p>Rav. S.D. Munk wrote against relying upon the Yemenite mesorah for locusts as follows (Shu\"T Peath Sadekha 62):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הדברים ניכרים שאינם בקיאים בהם יפה ובודים להם סימן שלא נזכר בדברי\nרז\"ל שיש להן צורת חי\"ת וגם צריכין טביעות עין יפה לומר זה טהור וזה טמא\nוהרי רש\"י העיד שאין אנו בקיאין</p>\n<p>The matter is apparent that they are not fine experts, and they rely\nupon a sign which is not mentioned by our rabbis, that it possesses [a\nbody mark that looks like] the shape of the letter ח and these\nimpressions require a fine eye to say whether they are kosher or not\nand Rashi testified that we are not experts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is notable about R. Munk's position here is that he generally finds the Yemenite tradition reliably trustworthy such that for example it may be relied upon as regards ethrogim (ad loc):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולענ\"ד גם אנחנו רשאים לסמוך על מסורת בני תימן</p>\n<p>an in my humble opinion we are permitted to rely on the mesorah of the Yemenites</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would seem then that while R. Munk is generally comfortable relying upon a Yemenite mesorah, he desists where their mesorah introduces additional unique species identifiers otherwise unexpressed by rabbinic predecessors. It also seems that he thought that among the Yemenites he was familiar with there were not to be found those proficiently expert in its identification.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TdV99.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TdV99.png\" alt=\"letter het illustration Zohar Amar\" /></a></p>\n<p>[Illustration of the form of the letter ח on thorax of kosher locust from <a href=\"https://www.zoharamar.org.il/wp-content/uploads/%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%9B%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar Amar]\n</a></p>\n<p>R. Zalman Nehemyah Goldberg takes the most severe approach in prohibiting Ashkenazim from consuming locusts, his position as cited in Shu\"T be'Mareh ha-Bezeq is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מפני שלאשכנזים ישנה מסורת לאסור. והגרז\"נ גולדברג הוסיף שאין לאשכנזים\nלסמוך על מסורות אחרות על-פי תשו' הרא\"ש (שורש כ סי' כ).</p>\n<p>Ashkenazim are prohibited from consuming locusts because they have an\nactive mesorah prohibiting its consumption, and that furthermore\nAshkenazim may not rely upon the mesorah of others, as per the Rosh\n20:2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, it is not just that Ashkenazim do not have a mesorah for locusts (a deficiency that could be remediated), it's that they have an active mesorah actively prohibiting its consumption, and that furthermore even were this not the case, based on the Rosh they would not be capable of receiving the mesorah from another community.</p>\n<p>Ari Greenspan, Ari Zivotovsky and Yosef Zivotovsky discuss how in November/December of 2004 there were some swarms of locusts in Israel. They realized that they had a historic opportunity to organize the last living generation in active possession of a mesorah from Yemen and North Africa to pass it on to the larger community and for perpetuity. The authors note that such assemblies, of a public nature, were convened for example in Frankfurt am Main and Halberstadt in order to publicize the sparrow (דרור) as kosher. They record the following rabbis in participation and attendance: R. Yisrael Sharabi (Chief Rabbi of Petah Tiqwa), R. Aharon Badihi (Chief Rabbi of Ebhen Yehudah), R. 'Azaryah Basis (Chief Rabbi of Rosh ha-'Ayin), R. Hananel Sari, etc. They also note that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הצלחנו להפתיע את באי הכנס באוסף מכתבים של פוסקים מכל הזרמים והעדות\nבדבר כשרות החגבים לאכילה על ידי האשכנזים ואלה שמות כמה מן הרבנים שנטו\nלהתיר או התירו בפועל לאשכנזים לאכול חגבים שיש להם מסורת הרב יוסף קאפח\nזצ\"ל הרב יוסף צובירי זצ\"ל ויבדל\"א הרב שלמה מחפוד הרב יצחק רצאבי שליט\"א\nהרב יעקב אריאל שליט\"א והרב עזרא בצרי שליט\"א</p>\n<p>We succeeded to amaze those assembled at the gathering with letters\nfrom Poseqim from all streams and communities regarding the\npermissibility of the consumption of locusts by Ashkenazim and these\nare the names of those that permit in actual practice Ashkenazim to\nconsume them based on the mesorah of <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%A7%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Ezra Basri</a>,\netc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While there are certainly detractors of the position, it would seem then that the tide may slowly be turning and that there is more overt/explicit articulation of the view that Ashkenazim may consume locusts in reliance of the Yemenite mesorah. I would however note that the only Ashkenazi individual (listed as) endorsing this view is R. Yaaqov Ariel (Chief Rabbi of Ramat Gan, and while he is widely respected as a poseq in Religious-Zionist circles, it is unlikely that Ashkenazim outside those circles would find his stature to be sufficiently persuasive to shift the dial. It could however open the door to other Ashkenazim where there are natural intersections between the Ashkenazi Haredi world and the Religious Zionist world, eventually paving the way to wider dissemination of the mesorah. This remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>The Ashkenazi rabbis that permit its consumption (such as R. Yaaqov Ariel mentioned above and R. Hershel Schachter as noted in the comments) apparently disagree with R. Goldberg that there is a mesorah of actively prohibiting Ashkenazi consumption. Rather they must maintain that Ashkenazim simply lacked a mesorah on its identity, and therefore it can be received from others.</p>\n\n\n",

Just because it is larger or slightly easier to digest does not make it something else other than wheat. It grows the same way, it is harvested much the same way, it is ground to flour, and it is used for bread. While it's conceivable that the 18-minute rule for Matzah might need to be adjusted because of the unique properties of this variety of wheat (although I'm not suggesting that this is the case; I'm just pointing out one possible ramification that could be discovered in using a \"different\" variety of a grain), the same can be said of baking Matzah in different climates, using different sources of water, etc. In other words, while some might think to add new stringencies to account for differences, that does not mean it is a different thing than is \"traditionally\" used.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Obviously, we're not going to find the word \"khorasan\" anywhere in the classic literature, so the best I can do for a proof that's based on sources more than 25 years old will have to utilize some indirect evidence.</p>\n\n<p>I figure, if these two types of dagan (grain) <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%90_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">aren't kilayim</a> with each other:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qI6oh.jpg\" alt=\"barley\" title=\"2- and 6-row Barley\"> <img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/w4RyV.jpg\" alt=\"oats\" title=\"Oats\"> \n than certainly these two aren't!

It is our connection to the generations before us, to Sinai, and to Hashem Himself. It is our job to preserve this gift, this jewel, and to live by it to our utmost abilities. We mustn't change our Mesorah even if other things seem to make more sense. Because if you start taking a little bit from Ashkenazim and then from Chassidus and then from Sefardim, you'll be left with nothing, for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your own Mesorah, your connection to Har Sinai and God, will have changed. By changing your Mesorah, you are actually replacing it with something that has zero validity and legitimacy, hence you have nothing.</li>\n<li>Like a good Jew I'll give you a mashul. If someone is a yellow belt in five styles of karate, he has nothing. If he learns a little bit from here and then from there and then from somewhere else,  he'll never master anything, and he won't have anything concrete. Similarly, if you pick and choose from different Mesorahs you'll end up with a conglomerate of nothing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is no such thing as a \"better\" Mesorah. There can be many LEGITIMATE Mesorahs passed down by great people. The fact that they are different is not a problem either, it is natural for there to be differences over time. Our job is to follow <em>our</em> Mesorah, and <em>our</em> teachers, until we master it and pass it on to our children.<br />\nI am not saying to have blind faith—that's not anyone's Mesorah. Ask away; that's what Judaism is all about. But it has to be balanced with respect for the Gedolim and any transmitter of your valid Mesorah. With the proper intellectual honesty and balance, the truth can be attained.</p>\n<p>May Hashem grant us all Beracha and Hatzlacha in our search for the emes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Rema (Yoreh Deah 64.7) writes that we are unable to do proper examinations on what is forbidden fat and where the fats end.  The Mechaber makes no statement about it, and we assume that Sephardim are experts.  I know for a fact that HaRav Machpud of Yerushalayim is an expert in treibering (nikor) and can tell you precisely where the fats are and where they end.  </p>\n\n<p>The Rema says we are not expert.  So its pretty clear that while Sephardim have the Mesorah, Ashkenazim, do not, and therefore cut a cow/sheep/goat etc. differently.  This doesn't make anyone better or more stringent. It is simply a reality of how our poskim have shaped our interaction with Halacha.  The Rema is one of the greatest Ashkenazi poskim.  Many are direct and indirect descedents of himself and his family.  </p>\n\n<p>Since Ashkenazim in general do not consider themselves expert in matters of precise determination of halachic definitions, we tend to refrain from matters that require that precision.  So when it comes to locusts, since Ashkenazim do not have a Masora, we don't regard ourselves as experts in that area, and hence refrain from accepting the Masora.  That doesn't negate the masora for Temanim. However it seems from the שו\"ת משנה הלכות חלק טז סימן ח that their mesora is not based on a halachic presumption, but rather from what they know their forefathers ate. In this case then, since they themselves are not expert in their own masora, but rather are simply expert in what their forefathers ate, we cannot rely on their Mesorah.  However, when it comes to our own Masora, we do not have the halachic authority and expertise to simply permit or allow aspects of the Masora to change.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>As the author has noticed, nearly every other Jewish community is willing to trust the mesorah of the Ashkenazi community while Ashkenazim in general reject the mesorah of everyone else. Therefore things that are technically problematic to halakha/mesorah of most other Jewish communities are brought in despite the problems because they want to be accepting of Ashkenazi mesorah. An example of this would be Challah (sweet varieties), which is a bread that is technically mezonot according to <a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/en/ReadHalacha.aspx?HalachaID=2218\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sepharadi</a> and Yemenite Halakha. Yet despite this bread's problematic status many Sepharadim have started using it. Not only that, times when I have hosted Ashkenazim for Shabbat and tried to make hammotzi on pita or lavash has led to problems since the Ashkenazim were unsure if they could even make hammotzi on a bread that wasn't \"challah\" for Shabbat, requesting that I provide challah for them. As someone who makes matzah himself (which is called soft matzah) I run into a problem every year of certain Ashkenazi friends who are unsure if they can eat in my house during Pesah since I make/eat \"soft matzah.\" This tendency of Ashkenazim silently expecting their mesorah to be accepted everywhere while remaining resistant to anyone else's mesorah can be felt in outside of food as well. Ashkenazim as a whole will refuse to adopt chet and ayin from Sepharadim and Yemenites while at the same time tell their own people they can't adopt other pronunciations because the vowels aren't as authentic as Ashkenazi mesorah. Oddly enough, proper pronunciation of the consonants is passed down in the halakha from our earliest sources, vowels are not (Megillah 24b). Ashkenazim in general also spend little time understanding other Jewish communities in any meaningful way, tending to lump all other Jews into the category of \"Sfardi.\" This is shocking not only because the word is \"Sefar<strong>a</strong>di\" but because many other communities are not actually Sephardic. This issue only occurs amongst Ashkenazim but because every other Jewish community is sensitive to these distinctions. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7A8JdFC8nc&feature=youtu.be&t=52\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A great example of an Ashkenazi Rabbi doing this in the midst of a Semikha program can be seen here</a>. In the video you can see the Rabbi call his guest a \"Sefardi\" and the guest has to correct him to say he's actually a Yemenite, and when this guest talks about Sefaradim he <strong>always</strong> uses the term Sefaradim/Sefaradi. These issues bleed into the realms of Jewish education in the US. <a href=\"https://www.jewishideas.org/article/ashkenazim-and-sephardim%E2%80%94united-education\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">We are starting to hear the stories of Sephardic children who grew up going Jewish school, only to experience teachers who know they are Sephardic but force them to disregard Sephardic practice anyways.</a></p>\n<p>The person asking the question asked if it's possible that Ashkenazim are just insecure. <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201511/4-signs-someone-is-probably-insecure\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">An insecure person is often described as someone who delegitimizes others to make themselves feel more secure.</a> Based on the behaviors described for individuals who are insecure, it appears that Ashkenazim as a whole are insecure. Sefaradim and Yemenites have even coined a term describing the trend for Ashkenazim to feel that their Jewish experience defines what Judaism is while at the same time dismissing the authenticity of other forms of Judaism: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?ei=yZwrXNDTIMKc0gKG2ZiIDw&q=ashkenormative&oq=ashkenormative&gs_l=psy-ab.12...0.0..3743...0.0..0.0.0.......0......gws-wiz.zq7-yQo_ff8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ashkenormative</a> or Ashkenormativity.</p>\n<p>Having said all that. This is clearly not the case for all Ashkenazim. Just like there are Ashkenazi Rabbis who permit following the mesorah of other Jews, there are Ashkenazim who are very aware of Judaism outside of their own received tradition. This answer is not an attempt to attack Ashkenazim, but rather to highlight an issue that is starting to be noticed on a large scale in hopes we can have a productive response to it.</p>\n\n\n",

ShmuelBrin noted that there is no decree to seek out people who don't know how to pray. I would like to go further: it is <em>forbidden</em> to ask around to see if someone doesn't know how to pray as, especially nowadays, it can be quite embarrassing to admit that. Maintaining the repetition helps those individuals and it reminds us to always be aware of and helpful to those in need of assistance, and to do so in a discreet way. (This can be similar to other enactments of Chazal that ensure that the well-off don't indirectly and unintentionally embarrass other Jews, such as the enactment that a Kohein read the Mikra Bikkurim on behalf of everyone, lest someone be embarassed that they cannot read it (cf. <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%92_%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Bikkurim 3:7</a>))</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The decree is that one must repeat the Amida if there is a minyan praying together. There is no decree, however,that one must look for people that don't know how to pray. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in the time of the Gemara, one had to do a chazaras hashatz even when there were no ignoramuses in the minyan.</p>\n\n<p>So nowadays one must still repeat the Amida even though there are no ignoramuses around as we cannot cancel a decree without a court that is bigger and wiser than the one which established the dercee:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25072&pgnum=374\">Shulchan Aruch Harav</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Rav Soloveitchik machzorim, as well as Spanish-Portuguese siddurim, note that the second amidah, as a collective amidah, are uniquely for all of <em>klal israel</em>.

Thus, it would seem, that chazarat hashatz has specifically another, ahistorical dimension that ought not to be eliminated in present day. </p>\n\n<p>R' Soloveitchik (Yom Kippur Machzor, <em>Hanhagos HaRav</em>, 9): \"The Rav's praactice was to stand with his feet together throughout the entire repetition of the Shemoneh Esrei, even when he was not the chazzan. The Rambam (Hil.

    "content": "# Can you sing during the sheva brachos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have been to weddings where, during the recitation of the seventh bracha under the chuppah, the congregation sings \"asher bara...\". Sometimes it is along with the one reciting the bracha and other times he waits for them to sing it and then repeats it himself. Is this a halachic problem either because the chassan and kallah have not heard the entire bracha from the one saying the bracha or maybe because the pause in between is a hefsek?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is no question that the person saying the beracho should wait.  The Chosson and Kallah need to hear every word of the beracho since it is being made on the wine for them.  It is better that a minyan hears every word too.  Thus, the standard practice among gedolim who say sheva Berachos is to wait until the singing stops and then continue.  (Source: Numerous weddings I've been to, where the Rav saying the sheva Berachos is an expert in hilchos Tefilla and berachos and is a Baal Tefilla for Rosh Hashana/Yom Kippur). It is implied from the חשוקי חמד ברכות דף מ עמוד א that even if the chosson makes an interuption one can be lenient, and thus the pausing due to the person waiting for the singing to stop would not be considered a hefsek.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are 3 main problems with the person singing along:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It is a hafsaka. This is much worse than waiting and not saying anything.</li>\n<li>The tune tends to repeat the words a few times over. This definitely invalidates the bracha.</li>\n<li>Sheva Brachot require a miniyan to hear and answer amen. That is not possible when 200+ people are singing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A VERY late edit:\nAt my wedding I was told not to sing along because the chattan also has to hear the whole beracha. The \"mesader kedushim\" was Rav Goldvicht zt\"l so I suppose he counts as a good source.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Halichos Shlomo 89:13 - Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Aurbach Zatzal - says that since it is being done to beautify the Bracha it is not considered a Hefsek.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיון שהכוונה ליפות הברכה אין זה הפסק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Kevias Ittim Vs. the General Mitzva of Talmud Torah",
    "content": "# Kevias Ittim Vs. the General Mitzva of Talmud Torah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The basic mitzva of learning Torah can be fulfilled minimally with Kerias Shema. This comes from a Gemara in Menachos (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=99b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">99b</a>) which goes through several conflicting interpretations of the verse in Yehoshua which says \"והגית בו יומם ולילה\"; \"and you will/shall contemplate it day and night.\" The same Gemara records a machlokes about whether it is a mitzva to tell this to the lay people - so they'll feel like they're already worth something and perhaps be motivated to do more; or it is forbidden to tell them - because this knowledge might cause them to be even more lax than they already are. Shach (YD 246:1) rules in accordance with Rava, that it is a mitzva to inform people of this.</p>\n\n<p>There is another Gemara (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=31&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 31a</a>) which discusses things that we will all have to give an accounting for in the future, and one of the things is whether or not we set aside time for learning. In this vein the Tur and Shulchan Aruch rule (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=84\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 155</a>) that one ought to set aside time each day for learning Torah. This is known as kevias ittim.</p>\n\n<p>Question: Is the halacha of kevias ittim an absolute obligation which is separate from one's general obligation to learn each day - the one that is technically fulfilled through the evening and morning kerias shema? Or is the only absolute obligation the general mitzva of talmud torah as it is delineated in Menachos, and the Gemara in Shabbos is simply telling us the proper way to live (a Pirkei Avos/darkei hamussar kind of thing)?</p>\n\n<p>I am leaning toward the latter understanding. Some reasons: 1) If you still have to be kovea ittim then it seems a bit disingenuous for the Gemara to say that one is technically finished with his minimum obligation of talmud torah after the morning and evening kerias shema. 2) If kevias ittim is an absolute obligation then I would assume it has some basis in Tanach. As far as I know the only relevant pasuk is והגית בו יומם ולילה.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think?</p>\n\n<p>(Thanks to Double AA for <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16967/upper-limits-of-kovea-itim/16968#comment37271_16968\">suggesting</a> I post this.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the comments, commenters focused on the Shitah of the Shulchan Aruch Harav, which can be summarized as Kevias Ittim being the same as the Mitzvah of Vehagisa Bo, but there being an additional Mitzvah to know the entire Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Truthfully, many of the Poskim seem to equate these Mitzvos (Kevias Ittim and Vehagisa), based on Shulchan Aruch YD 246:1.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל איש ישראל חייב בתלמוד תורה, בין עני בין עשיר, בין שלם בגופו בין בעל יסורים, בין בחור בין זקן גדול. אפילו עני המחזר על הפתחים, אפילו בעל אשה ובנים, חייב לקבוע לו זמן לתלמוד תורה ביום ובלילה, שנאמר: והגית בו יומם ולילה (יהושע א, ח). רמא: ובשעת הדחק, אפילו לא קרא רק קריאת שמע שחרית וערבית, לא ימושו מפיך (ישעיהו נט, כא) קרינן ביה (הגהות מיימוני פ\"א וסמ\"ג עשין י\"ב).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is cleared up by the Gra (YD 246:4), who says specifically that the this discussion of the Mitzvah of Talmud Torah relates directly to the question of Kavata Itim.  This is also the simple assumption of many poskim (see Aruch Hashulchan YD 246:7 and compare to OC 156:2 as well).  Note that the Rambam (Talmud Torah 1:8) learns the Chiyuv of Kevias Ittim from Vehagisa, which is the source of the Shulchan Aruch's Pesak.</p>\n\n<p>One last point, however, is that the Aruch Hashulchan (YD 246:7 endnote) says a personal Chiddush that he thinks that the Gemara in Menachos refers to both a constant Chiyuv of Limud Hatorah, as well as Kevius Ittim (with the former applying only to learners, see OC 156:2), but the assumption is that Kerias Shema can technially cover both if such a Shas Hadechak arises.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the Mitzvah of Limud Hatorah that Shulchan Aruch (YD 246:1) quotes, based on the Rambam (TT 1:8) is the same as the Chiyuv to be Kovea Itim.  Beshas Hadechak, according to Rema, this Mitzvah is covered by Keriyas Shema.  The Aruch Hashulchan says a Chiddush whereby they are two separate Mitzvos, but would have little to no practical ramifications.</p>\n\n<p>-- Somewhat related notes</p>\n\n<p>Also, in a number of places, we see a single Passuk being required after Kerias Shema, which is based on that Rambam TT 1:8 (Lechem Mishneh there assumes that Rambam holds that Kerias Shema is not enough), however, Rema YD 246:1 does Pasken that Shema is enough.</p>\n\n<p>The Chiyuv to learn Kol Hatorah Kulah may be additional to this or a specific part of this Mitzvah, see Igros Mosheh YD 4:37:3 for details on this Chiyuv.  Please see comments to this answer as well.</p>\n\n<p>I'm sure much has been written on this, and this is just a quick, simple overview, but if people have more substantial, specific answers, Mah Tov Umah Naim!</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, to fast on [<em>Shabas</em>] is by the decree of His wise ones forbidden: but for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Yom Kipur</em></a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, there's a rabbinically-instituted ban on fasting on fast days if their dates happen to fall on <em>Shabas</em>; on <em>Yom Kipur</em>, however, which is Biblically rather rabbinically declared, there's no such ban, and one may [in fact must] fast.</p>\n<p>Rabbi <em>Yaakov</em> Emden's <em>sidur</em> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתוב בתורת ה׳ (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%9B%D7%93_%D7%97\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ויקרא כד ח</a>) מצוה לכהניו לסדר בשבת לחם הפנים לפניו על השלחן בביהמ״ק ולסלק הלחם המונח משבת העבר ולאכלו בשבת ולכן אסור מד״ס לצום בשבת וכשחל בו יו״כ חובה לצום</p>\n<p>Written in God's Torah (<a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=24\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Lev. 24</a>:8) is a command to His <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/tags/kohen-priest/info\"><em>kohanim</em></a> to set the showbread on the table before Him on <em>Shabas</em>, and to remove the bread sitting there from the previous week and eat it on <em>Shabas</em>. Therefore, it's forbidden by rabbinical decree to fast on <em>Shabas</em>. But when <em>Yom Kipur</em> falls on [<em>Shabas</em>], there's an obligation to fast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Translations are my own, and somewhat loose.)</p>\n<p>Two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why extend the obligation to eat the showbread to a general ban on fasting? What does one have to do with the other?</li>\n<li>Is there any source other than this song for saying that the ban on fasting on <em>Shabas</em> is derived from the laws of the showbread? [I've always understood that the ban on fasting on <em>Shabas</em> derives from the rules of <em>oneg Shabas</em>.]</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Why extend the obligation to eat the showbread to a general ban on fasting? What does one have to do with the other?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We have another case of something affecting only Cohanim, and a decree was implemented for all Yidden; washing before bread.</p>\n\n<p>Because the Cohanim have to wash before eating Terumah, therefore we all have to wash before eating bread - and make a Bracha on it. (For sources, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/8324/501\">this</a> answer.)</p>\n\n<p>So if the Cohanim had to eat the Lechem Hapanim on Shabbat, possibly a general ban on fasting was declared to ensure the Cohanim didn't fast and forget to eat them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Is there any source other than this song for saying that the ban on fasting on Shabas is derived from the laws of the showbread?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unlikely. Here's why:</p>\n\n<p>The Lechem Hapanim could be also eaten on Motzai Shabbat. There are even opinions that they can be eaten all week long. (<a href=\"http://files.daf-yomi.com/bookfiles/daf-al-hadaf-menachot/daf-al-hadaf-menachot45.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The Daf al HaDaf (<a href=\"http://files.daf-yomi.com/bookfiles/daf-al-hadaf-menachot/daf-al-hadaf-menachot46.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">page 60</a>) asks your question as  הדברים תמוהים - \"the explanation in Rabbi Yaakov Emden's siddur is puzzling\".</p>\n\n<p>His only answer - brought in brackets - is that Rabbi Yaakov Emden's siddur holds like the Chacham Tzvi (סימן קנ\"א) who holds that it's <em>better</em> to eat them on Shabbat. </p>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1012/wfb\">commenter</a> stated, the Chacham Tzvi was Rabbi Yaakov Emden's father.</p>\n\n<p>That would explain why nobody else seems to understand his fasting-Lechem Hapanim connection, as it's seemingly based on the Chacham Tzvi's view, which few - if any - others seem to agree with. Everybody else seems to prefer to use the other version of the song, viz. גם בו להתענות.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This song is recounting how everything we do on Shabbat is kadosh (think in terms of being transparent to its originating source) and is a sign (think that it is an indicating marker, like a road sign along the way). That is the repeating phrase (אות היא לעולמי עד בינו וביני) \"It is an eternal sign between Him and me.\"</p>\n\n<p>If you look at the Roshei Teivot of this repeating phrase, it emphasizes another association (אהל עבו היינו ע״ב ו) His thick tent (a reference to the clouds of glory, the thick clouds, which surrounded the Jewish people after leaving Egypt). His tent is also a reference to the Tent of Meeting, the Mishkan. It also has the implication that this was the place where the 72 (ע״ב) letter name was pronounced by Aharon HaKohen Gadol on Yom Kippur. And that all of this was to draw kindness (chesed \"חסד\" which is gematria of 72) into this world from above. This is accomplished through the middle path which is called \"Tiferet\" and is associated with Yaacov Avinu and the letter \"Vav\" which has a gematria of 6, like the sixth day. The conclusion and end of this middle path is the sefirah of Yesod which is what connects with and leads into Malchut \"Kingship\". Malchut being a reference to the Shabbat Kallah which we greet at the close of the sixth day in reciting Lecha Dodi and Eishet Chayil and also to our declaration the HaShem is King of the Universe in the recital of kiddush on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>So we see an association between what was done coming out of Egypt, what was done in the Temple (the Mishkan is the Temple and the Temple is the Mishkan) and what we do every Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>The stanza in the song says, \"To the first generation was given My holy one (meaning Shabbat). A wonder in giving a double portion of bread (the Manna) on the sixth. Thus it is with all sixths, you will double my sustenance.\"</p>\n\n<p>This means that the concept of doubling the bread is related to six. In the  Temple, that translated to the requirement that the Lechem HaPanim was 12 breads (2 times 6). One for each tribe that came out of Egypt. Part of the language for kiddish is to say 'in remembrance of going out of Egypt'.</p>\n\n<p>Although the general custom of Ashkenazim is to use only two challot for kiddush, the practice of the Kabbalists, particularly those who follow the teachings of the Ari z\"l, is to place 12 challot on the table for Shabbat kiddush. This is done in two arrangements of six, one on top of the other. This follows the precise wording from VaYikra 24:5-9. It says there that every Shabbat, without interruption, the children of Israel will arrange this bread before G-d as an eternal covenant. And  it will be for Aharon and his children (meaning those who follow the practice and teaching of Aharon. Aharon is called Ish Chesed, and those who follow his teachings and practice are 'Chassidim'. Additionally, the entire Jewish people are called 'a nation of priests' like in Shemot 19:6.). And they will eat it in a holy place because it (the bread that is placed) is Holy of Holies to Him from the fire offerings of HaShem. And this is an eternal law (חק עולם).</p>\n\n<p>The command from the Torah is that when you place the arrangement of bread, you will eat it. It is prohibited to fast on Shabbat because you must place the bread as part of the observance of Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>And this is following what happened to the children of Israel when they went out from Egypt. If they left the Manna over from Shabbat, it spoiled. They couldn't stockpile it for later usage.</p>\n\n<p>The only exception to eating the bread on the day it was placed is Yom Kippur. If Yom Kippur falls on Shabbat, we are commanded to fast because we were specifically commanded to fast on that day. It is \"Shabbat Shabbaton\", the Sabbath of Sabbaths.</p>\n\n<p>And that is precisely the text of song as it continues. \"Marked as the law of G-d as a law (חוק כמ״ש ויקרא כד:ט) to His officers concerning it, 'to arrange the showbread before Him.' Therefore, to fast on it (the day you arrange it) is prohibited according to those who understand it (or understand Him), except for Yom Kippur when you will fast.\"</p>\n\n<p>And this is precisely why this section from VaYikra is recited at the conclusion of Shabbat morning prayers in the siddur of the Alter Rebbe. It teaches the requirement to make the arrangement of twelve challah loaves for kiddush to fulfill the mitzvah properly.</p>\n\n<p>This is also what is found in the Siddur of Rabbi Shabtai of Rashkov, the Siddur Kol Yaacov and the Siddur HaAri z\"l from Zolkova.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Because of this question (what does lechem hapanim have to do with the prohibition of fasting?)

There are stories of people who <em>did</em> get married at such ages (Rivkah, ATSO<sup>1</sup>). I've heard that during the times of the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonist\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cantonists</a>\" some parents had their children married at extremely young ages so that they wouldn't be drafted.</p>\n\n<p>Was it ever common for people to get married at very young ages? If so, was it the norm? When?  </p>\n\n<p>(Assume here that \"young\" is 13 and under, although if it was common to get married at, say 15, I'd like to hear that too.)</p>\n\n<p>I have intentionally made no distinction between boys and girls.

It was common in Tunisia at that time (1930's).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Chayei Moharan perek 105 states that Rebbe Nachman of Breslev zy'a married shortly after his bar mitzva. I recall learning specifically that this was common practice at the time, but I cannot find this statement sourced in any of the commentaries. I may have heard it in a shiur covering the sefer.  </p>\n\n<p>In looking for it I saw a note saying that Yemei Moharnat (the autobiography of Reb Noson of Breslev zy'a) states that Reb Noson was engaged at 12 and married following his bar mitzva, and that his parents had him when they were 14.  </p>\n\n<p>This supports the notion that marriage was routinely performed at this age both in Chasidic communities like the household of the Baal Shem Tov where Rebbe Nachman grew up as well as otherwise, as Reb Noson was born in a family of staunch misnagdim. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>In central and eastern Europe in the early modern period (even into the 19th century in Russia and Congress Poland) it was common for Jewish marriages to take place very young. This is especially true under Nicholas I, whose conscription policies (beginning 1827) specifically did not include married men. The tradition of \"kest\" (when a young bride and bridegroom would live in the bride's parents' house for a certain number of years as a condition of betrothal) was one of the ways in which people were able to study for a certain number of years. What is tricky, though, is that child marriage was an important polemic of the Haskalah (Jewish enlightenment) against religious Judaism. They claimed that early marriage was a sign of degeneracy; in actuality early marriage was only a reality for a small elite (just as was the ideal of full time study), especially in the case of the alliance between wealth and the rabbinic class. Most people did not marry young. But it did happen. See for example the memoirs of Moshe Leib Lilienblum, <em>Sins of my Youth</em> (<em>Hataot Neurai</em>), for a Haskala critique of early marriage.</p>\n\n\n",

Why are they set up in this particular order?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>As I noted above, it is quite common to find grammatical inconsistencies in Psalms and other poetic Biblical sections. Switching back and forth between the second and third person forms in reference to God is probably the most common example. So much so that I would be more surprised if a (God-related) psalm didn't include this phenomenon than if it did. As noted in <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=s1MSQuK_gi0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">this book</a> (p. 326), \"in Hebrew, as in any language, a writer enjoys a certain grammatical freedom. In poetry, the choice of a particular form may not always be dictated by grammatical considerations, but, for instance, by some metrical necessity.\"</p>\n\n<p>Let's go through a few of the opening psalms to get a feel for this concept with some examples.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Psalm 3</strong></h2>\n\n<p>This one starts off referring to God in the second person.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ב יְהוָה מָה רַבּוּ צָרָי רַבִּים קָמִים עָלָי. ג רַבִּים אֹמְרִים לְנַפְשִׁי אֵין יְשׁוּעָתָה לּוֹ בֵאלֹהִים סֶלָה. ד וְאַתָּה יְהוָה מָגֵן בַּעֲדִי כְּבוֹדִי וּמֵרִים רֹאשִׁי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Switch to third person in verse 5:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קוֹלִי אֶל יְהוָה אֶקְרָא וַיַּעֲנֵנִי מֵהַר קָדְשׁוֹ סֶלָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Back to second person in verse 8:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קוּמָה יְהוָה הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי אֱלֹהַי כִּי הִכִּיתָ אֶת כָּל אֹיְבַי לֶחִי שִׁנֵּי רְשָׁעִים שִׁבַּרְתָּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Verse 9, as I've noted elsewhere, sums it up with both third and second person references:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לַיהוָה הַיְשׁוּעָה עַל עַמְּךָ בִרְכָתֶךָ סֶּלָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Psalm 4</h2>\n\n<p>Again, we start off with second person:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ב בְּקָרְאִי עֲנֵנִי אֱלֹהֵי צִדְקִי בַּצָּר הִרְחַבְתָּ לִּי חָנֵּנִי וּשְׁמַע תְּפִלָּתִי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then, third person for v. 4-6<sup>*</sup>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ד וּדְעוּ כִּי הִפְלָה יְהוָה חָסִיד לוֹ יְהוָה יִשְׁמַע בְּקָרְאִי אֵלָיו. ה רִגְזוּ וְאַל תֶּחֱטָאוּ אִמְרוּ בִלְבַבְכֶם עַל מִשְׁכַּבְכֶם וְדֹמּוּ סֶלָה. ו זִבְחוּ זִבְחֵי צֶדֶק וּבִטְחוּ אֶל יְהוָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Back to second person for the remainder of the psalm:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ז רַבִּים אֹמְרִים מִי יַרְאֵנוּ טוֹב נְסָה עָלֵינוּ אוֹר פָּנֶיךָ יְהוָה. ח נָתַתָּה שִׂמְחָה בְלִבִּי מֵעֵת דְּגָנָם וְתִירוֹשָׁם רָבּוּ. ט בְּשָׁלוֹם יַחְדָּו אֶשְׁכְּבָה וְאִישָׁן כִּי אַתָּה יְהוָה לְבָדָד לָבֶטַח תּוֹשִׁיבֵנִי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Psalm 5</h2>\n\n<p>This entire psalm refers to God in the second person with one exception. Verse 7 reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תְּאַבֵּד דֹּבְרֵי כָזָב / אִישׁ דָּמִים וּמִרְמָה יְתָעֵב יְהוָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a parallelism in which the first part is written in second person form, and the second part in the third person form.</p>\n\n<h2>Psalm 6</h2>\n\n<p>Here again we start with second person, then shift to third person at the end for v. 9-10:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ט סוּרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן כִּי שָׁמַע יְהוָה קוֹל בִּכְיִי. י שָׁמַע יְהוָה תְּחִנָּתִי יְהוָה תְּפִלָּתִי יִקָּח. יא יֵבֹשׁוּ וְיִבָּהֲלוּ מְאֹד כָּל אֹיְבָי יָשֻׁבוּ יֵבֹשׁוּ רָגַע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Psalm 7</h2>\n\n<p>Start with second person for v. 2-8:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ב יְהוָה אֱלֹהַי בְּךָ חָסִיתִי הוֹשִׁיעֵנִי מִכָּל רֹדְפַי וְהַצִּילֵנִי. ג פֶּן יִטְרֹף כְּאַרְיֵה נַפְשִׁי פֹּרֵק וְאֵין מַצִּיל. ד יְהוָה אֱלֹהַי אִם עָשִׂיתִי זֹאת אִם יֶשׁ עָוֶל בְּכַפָּי. ה אִם גָּמַלְתִּי שׁוֹלְמִי רָע וָאֲחַלְּצָה צוֹרְרִי רֵיקָם. ו יִרַדֹּף אוֹיֵב נַפְשִׁי וְיַשֵּׂג וְיִרְמֹס לָאָרֶץ חַיָּי וּכְבוֹדִי לֶעָפָר יַשְׁכֵּן סֶלָה. ז קוּמָה יְהוָה בְּאַפֶּךָ הִנָּשֵׂא בְּעַבְרוֹת צוֹרְרָי וְעוּרָה אֵלַי מִשְׁפָּט צִוִּיתָ. ח וַעֲדַת לְאֻמִּים תְּסוֹבְבֶךָּ וְעָלֶיהָ לַמָּרוֹם שׁוּבָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Verses 9 and 10 are arguable as to their translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ט יְהוָה יָדִין עַמִּים שָׁפְטֵנִי יְהוָה כְּצִדְקִי וּכְתֻמִּי עָלָי. י יִגְמָר נָא רַע רְשָׁעִים וּתְכוֹנֵן צַדִּיק וּבֹחֵן לִבּוֹת וּכְלָיוֹת אֱלֹהִים צַדִּיק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"שָׁפְטֵנִי\" is an imperative, which implies second person. \"יָדִין עַמִּים\" implies third person, but Mechon-Mamre translates \"<em>O LORD, who ministerest judgment</em>\". \"יִגְמָר נָא\" is probably modifying \"רַע\" instead of God. \"וּתְכוֹנֵן צַדִּיק\" is second person form; \"וּבֹחֵן לִבּוֹת וּכְלָיוֹת אֱלֹהִים צַדִּיק\" can go both ways in my mind.</p>\n\n<p>But certainly by v.11 we are in full-fledged third person mode:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יא מָגִנִּי עַל אֱלֹהִים מוֹשִׁיעַ יִשְׁרֵי לֵב. יב אֱלֹהִים שׁוֹפֵט צַדִּיק וְאֵל זֹעֵם בְּכָל יוֹם. יג אִם לֹא יָשׁוּב חַרְבּוֹ יִלְטוֹשׁ קַשְׁתּוֹ דָרַךְ וַיְכוֹנְנֶהָ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This continues through the end of the psalm.</p>\n\n<p>By now we start to get the idea. Can we come up with rigid contextual rules for when God will be addressed in the third person and when in the second person? Maybe, but I doubt it. I would not be opposed to <em>drash</em> explanations that would try to explain for certain occurrences of this phenomenon, but it would be just that: <em>drash</em>. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>*</sup> This example is more understandable, since the psalmist begins by talking to God, thus using the second person, then switches to address the \"sons of man\" in v. 3-6, which explains the shift to third person for God. The same is true below in Psalm 6 where the shift occurs as the psalmist begins to address the \"workers of inquity\".</p>\n\n\n",

In the Garrad model there is another wall on the temple mount that I suppose surrounds the court of the gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>I want to know more about the difference. Could we be sure if the wall was there or not? Or is it simply that, that the models that lacks that wall is a \"snapshot\" before the wall was built? If so, do we know when the wall was built?</p>\n\n<p>And am I correct in my assumption that, if that wall existed, it surrounded the \"court of the gentiles\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I think that the inner colonnaded wall in the Garrard model is actually meant to demarcate the original area of the Temple Mount, which per the Mishnah, <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%91_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">Middos 2:1</a> (English translation <a href=\"http://orion.it.luc.edu/~avande1/jerusalem/sources/middot.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) was a square, 500 cubits (about 800-1000 feet) to a side. [The outer wall, with its colonnade, would be the enlarged area after Herod's renovation of the Temple, substantial parts of whose walls still exist (the present-day Western Wall plaza fronts a small section of one of them), and which is a trapezoid, roughly 1500x1000 feet.] The original 500x500-cubit area had a higher level of sanctity, so it makes sense that it would have been surrounded by some kind of wall to mark it off.</p>\n\n<p>In that picture, though, there is what looks like a low wall between that colonnade and the walls of the Temple courtyards proper. That is probably a depiction of the <em>soreg</em> (ibid. 2:3), which is indeed described as a low wall (10 handbreadths, about 3 feet, tall) made of crosshatched lathes, and which indeed was the point beyond which non-Jews were not allowed to enter.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, books are named for their <em>content</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There are two ways to look at the overarching theme of Sefer Shmuel that would explain the choice of name for this book:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The life and accomplishments of Shmuel Hanavi</strong>. Clearly, the book begins this way, starting with the story of Shmuel's birth and his education and his prophet-hood etc. The rest of the book, which deals with the events relating to Shaul and David, can also be attributed to Shmuel, since Shaul and David are \"his doing\", in that he found them and anointed them as kings. In this respect, the entire sefer is about Shmuel, and thus rightly named.</li>\n<li><strong>The transition from the period of judges (<em>shoftim</em>) to the period of kings (<em>melachim</em>).</strong> Shmuel was the last of the judges and David was the first of the kings (discounting Shaul). Arguably, each of these personalities was the greatest of their respective categories, and so this can also be looked at as the high point of both periods. We would then describe this sefer as the story of lives of Shmuel and David, which marked a turning point in Jewish leadership. Of course, this necessitates the stories of Eli and Shaul to be included as well, given their importance to the Shmuel and David narratives. Now, we cannot call the book by two names (Shmuel and David), and so we choose Shmuel because he was the greater of the two with respect to his level of prophecy and with respect to his parentage, and because he was David's teacher and deserving of his respect.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

It's not like Judaism was monolithic in those days either. You had the Pharisees (Perushim), Sadducees (Tzedukim), the Essenes (possibly the Baysusim/Boethusians), and a couple of smaller sects, and not to mention the early Christians when they came around. As for the stuff buried at Qumran in particular, I have no idea whether or not this is the accepted view among historians, but I heard a recording of a speech by Rabbi Shmuel Irons in which he posited that it was a geniza of the Essenes. If that is the case then it obviously cannot be expected to be necessarily reflective of our mesorah, nor would it pose any problems on that basis.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Names of the books of Tanakh",
    "content": "# Names of the books of Tanakh\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When did the books of Tanakh get their canonical names?  I understand that Five Books of the Torah were named after the first words in them, and that most of Navi was named after their authors, but when did some of the less obvious ones (such as Shmuel, Divrei Hayamim, Melakhim, Shoftim, Shir HaShirim, Esther, Ruth, and Trei Asar) get their names?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I have no source for the following claims, so please consider this like an extended comment more than an official answer.</p>\n\n<p>Today when people write books, they choose titles for them, which are printed on the title page before the text. In biblical times, I doubt this was the case. Still, though, a title is necessary for when people refer to the book in writing or in conversation. (e.g. \"Hey Mark, have you read...?) Because of this, I assume that people came up with titles for the books which became widespread and over time one particular name became the accepted one. [Consider, for example, \"The Declaration of Independence\", which I don't think is formally titled as such. But people began to call it that and it became accepted; or maybe someone famous referred to it as such, and it stuck.]</p>\n\n<p>By the time Chazal (traditionally, Anshei K'nesses HaG'dolah) came around and canonized the Tanach, it seems names were already well-known. Bava Basra 14b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר סדרן של נביאים יהושע ושופטים שמואל ומלכים ירמיה ויחזקאל ישעיה ושנים עשר סידרן של כתובים רות וספר תהלים ואיוב ומשלי קהלת שיר השירים וקינות דניאל ומגילת אסתר עזרא ודברי הימים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>b'raisa</em> presents the order as if everyone should know what book it refers to when it says e.g. \"Melachim\".</p>\n\n<p>It remains to be determined why each book was given its particular name, or why the name it has became the \"accepted\" name. First, though, note that each section of Tanach also have given names (<em>Torah, Neviim, K'suvim</em>). These names are clearly only as old as the canonization of Tanach, since there is no reason to assume that the books were thus organized beforehand. Therefore, we find Abarbanel introducing his commentary on the Prophets with the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>המחקר הראשון בחלוקת ספרי הקדש בכלל, הנה חכמינו הקדושים ז׳׳ל חלקו ספרי הקדש חלוקה ראשונה לשלשה חלקים, ויקראו אותם תורה נביאים וכתובים, וראוי שנדע למה נקראו בשמות האלה ומהו ההבדל העצמי אשר ביניהם שיורו עליו שמותיהם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the names of the individual books, some cases are more obvious than others. The books of the Torah, for example, are clearly called by the first (determining) word(s) of the book. <strong><em>Bereshis, Shemos, Vayikra, Bamidbar, Devarim</em></strong>. This seems the be the case for other books as well. Consider <strong><em>Shir HaShirim, Mishlei, Koheles</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Eichah</em></strong>. (Although, notice that in Bava Basra, Eicha is called \"Kinnos\", likely inspired by II Chronicles 35:25.) The first three (Shir HaShirim, Mishlei, Koheles) all have \"title sentences\" at the beginning, which is probably why they are called what they are called. In fact, perhaps it was common at the time of their composition to name books like that, introducing the title in the first line of the text.</p>\n\n<p>Other books are named for the main character of interest. For books of prophecies, the name always belongs to the prophet. <strong><em>Yeshayahu, Yirmiyahu, Yechezkel, Hoshea, Yoel, Amos, Ovadia, Yonah, Micha, Nachum, Chabakuk, Tzefania, Chagai, Zecharia, Malachi.</em></strong> I included the books of Trei Asar as their own titles, as once again, the compilation into one book is likely the effect of Anshei K'nesses HaG'dola's canonization, with the individual names probably being the ones that existed before that. Other books that are named for their main characters: <strong><em>Yehoshua, Shmuel, Ruth, Iyov, Daniel, Ezra, Esther</em></strong>. (With regard to Esther, I don't know if I would say she is <em>the main</em> character in the story, but certainly she is of the most pivotal characters.)</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the books that are not really historical or don't really have a \"main character of the story\" are named for their content and overall theme. <strong><em>Shoftim, Melachim, Tehillim, Divrei Hayamim</em></strong>. Shoftim and Melachim seem pretty clear to me and Divrei Hayamim even clearer. It is Tehillim that requires a little thought. It is referred to as \"Sefer Tehillim\" in Bava Basra, although maybe the original text is \"Tehillos\", since both Ibn Ezra and Seforno begin their commentaries with \"...זה ספר תהלות\". If I were naming the books, I probably would have gone with \"Sefer Mizmorim\", but it is true that תהלה is a central theme in Tehillim (e.g. \"וּפִי יַגִּיד תְּהִלָּתֶךָ\", \"יִמָּלֵא פִי תְּהִלָּתֶךָ\", \"כְּשִׁמְךָ אֱלֹהִים כֵּן תְּהִלָּתְךָ\") as well as the ending note of the book (\"כֹּל הַנְּשָׁמָה תְּהַלֵּל יָהּ הַלְלוּ יָהּ\").</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, any time that a new name is created, a soul's original name is being changed. In general, those who follow the custom of naming children after their relatives are not going to be able to create new people (which is possible since <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/6782/1059\">it isn't forbidden to create a new name</a>, and by doing so, you are creating a new individual. Creating a new individual is a fulfillment of <em>Imitatio Dei</em>, since He created and named an individual in the beginning of Genesis. <em>Hashem</em> gives names to all of the stars (Psalms 147:4), and it says elsewhere that <em>Hashem</em> would multiply the <em>B'nai Yisrael</em> exponentially like the amount of stars in the night sky.) In conclusion, changing a name is not forbidden because a name that is created is actually a God-given name that already existed but had simply not yet been revealed.</p>\n\n\n",

One specific union is נשיקין (kissing), in turn there is a \"higher\" and \"lower\" form of this union. The higher refers to the union of the sfirot of Chochma and Bina, and is accomplished by the recital of the Shema. The lower union is via reciting Baruch Shem after the shema.</p>\n\n<p>The principal of מסירת נפש (giving over one's soul) during the recital of the shema is the same as giving ones soul over during death i.e. ideally a person should have the proper intention of creating that union both during recital of the shema and even during death - and that would be \"death by kiss\". See there at great length where he explains how Moshe's death by kiss was via the union of Chochma and Bina אהיה and יהוה forming the name יאההויהה, yet it is limited to an outward facet as hinted at \"kiss\" (the mouth is for speech, an externally-oriented organ, for Moshe was on the level of פה אל פה אדבר בו - \"mouth to mouth I speak with him\").</p>\n\n<p>The Emek HaMelech has lengthy discussions about the non-kiss type of death, i.e. death by קידוש השם (sanctification of G-ds Name or martyrdom, which is a painful death). This type of death is that of the 10 martyrs and in particular Rabi Akiva who longed for that type of death, in order to manifest the more essential union (גופא בגופא ורוחא ברוחא). Indeed he merited this, as he ended up dying while saying shema in the midst of torture.</p>\n\n\n",

That is to say, neither is complete without the other. Just as HodofHod wrote, you cannot understand parts of the written Torah without some input from the oral Torah. If you were to try to explain, for example, how to create the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0506.htm#8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Totafoth\" as commanded in Deuteronomy 6:8</a> it would not be difficult, it would be impossible - without the oral Torah. G-d told Moshe (Moses) to write down the basic law, but then He taught him how to apply it; this is, on its most basic level, what the oral Torah is. It's the part of the Mesorah that allows us to understand what G-d was saying in the Torah He gave to us.</p>\n\n<p>Part of our Mesorah is also a set of principles for interpretation, which is itself very important, because there are areas of life that are, naturally, not explicitly discussed in detail in the Torah.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The above is to serve as background to answer your question directly:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do we reference the sayings of earlier rabbis when interpreting the Torah?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Because they are the ones who have served as the links in the chain of our Mesorah.</em> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>That is not to say that one cannot interpret the Torah, and in fact the Talmud is a vast collection of discussions and debates among the ancient rabbis based on their interpretation. In addition, the Midrash (a vast collection of interpretations from ancient rabbis) tells us that there are 70 faces to the Torah. But what it means is that we have a rock-solid tradition stemming back, literally, from teacher to student, since Moshe received the Torah directly from G-d, that cannot be done away with just because someone thinks the law should be different. When one innovates, if he does so correctly, he uses the techniques that have been used for millennia, and he contends with the traditional interpretation using those same techniques - and, perhaps most importantly, he does so with great deference and respect for the interpretation that has been accepted, and with those who disagree with him.  Famously, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, a 20th Century rabbi in Israel, was known to have said that if it weren't for the fact that those who preceded him banned the active use of electricity on the Sabbath, he would have said it was permissible.  Because of his reverence for those who came before him who saw the issue differently, he upheld their ruling because it was based on their interpretation of the laws of the Sabbath as applied to the then-new phenomenon of harnessing electricity to power devices in our daily lives.  Although he disagreed, and indeed he was very innovative in his approach to applying the Torah to modern life, he did not overrule them because of the importance of adhering to the traditional approach to interpreting and following the Torah through the lens of Mesorah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Tradition. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr:\nYou need the Rabbis' commentaries to understand the Torah correctly.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Torah is a book that cannot be understood (and was not meant to be) <strong>unless you also have the oral teachings that came with it when it was given</strong>. These teachings were passed down verbally, until the times of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_the_Prince\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rebbi</a>, who compiled many of the different traditions of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oral Torah</a> into the book called the Mishnah. Additionally, Rabbis who are familiar with the entire Torah and the Oral Torah, can make correlations and learn new things that were not passed down (provided that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmudical_Hermeneutics\" rel=\"nofollow\">their methods are valid</a>).</p>\n\n<p>[Insert the history of Judaism here]</p>\n\n<p>Since then, Rabbis have continued learning and passing down their traditions and insights through the generations. Learning the Torah without the commentary of the Rabbis, is (l'havdil) a little like reading the Constitution without the laws and legal decisions made since then, and without understanding the men who wrote it, and the society they lived in.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To give an example: <em>The</em> foremost Rabbi who comments on the Torah, is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi</a>. Rashi's work is nearly all made up of quotes from earlier Rabbis. Rashi compiled thousands of different sources and traditions of Torah's meanings, and wrote them down by chapter and verse. Without Rashi, you get to passage like <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9882/showrashi/true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exodus 21:24</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>..and you think, \"Does the Torah actually mean that you should gouge out someones eye?\" No! The Oral Torah that was passed down from the times of Moses explains, so Rashi brings it down for us:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>an eye for an eye:</strong> If [a person] blinds his neighbor’s eye, he must give him the value of his eye, [which is] how much his price to be sold in the marketplace has decreased [without the eye]. So is the meaning of all of them [i.e., all the injuries enumerated in the following verses], but not the actual amputation of a limb, as our Rabbis interpreted it in the chapter entitled הַחוֹבֵל, he who assaults. -[From Baba Kamma 83b, 84a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The fact that someone lived in an earlier generation does not make his opinion better than mine. Nor does the fact that someone is a great rabbi imply that he is a super genius whose opinions are inherently wiser than anyone else's. But just as with any profession if you want to know the answers you go to the pros, so it is with Torah. A Rishon doesn't have more of a say than I do. But Rashi, the Rambam and the Rashba and for that matter my own rabbi are much more proficient in Torah than I am. They've gone through it all. That is why I generally value their opinion over my own, inasmuch as I value my doctor's opinion over my own when it comes to questions that require medical expertise. And I'm sure you would rather hear the opinion of a professional than that of an amateur, which is why if you ask me a question it is likely that I will try to cite some of the great rabbis instead of simply presenting my own theories.</p>\n\n<p>In support of the idea that an earlier opinion is not better per se than a later on, see R. Ovadia Yosef in his introduction to Halichos Olam, where he writes as follows:</p>\n\n<p>וכמש\"כ הגר\"ח מוואלוזין בשו\"ת חוט המשולש (סי' ט) בזה\"ל: ואע\"פ שאנכי שמשתי את מו\"ר הכהן הגדול ומחוייב אני בכבודו ובמוראו כמורא שמים, מ\"מ אני שומר מה שאמרו חז\"ל (ב\"ב קל:) כד אתי פסקא דדינא קמייכו וחזיתו ביה פירכא לא תגמרו מיניה, שאין לדיין אלא מה שעיניו רואות. וכבר הוזהרתי מפי מורי קדוש ישראל הגר\"א מווילנא שלא לישא פנים בהוראה. וכ\"כ עוד בספרו רוח חיים (פ\"ד דאבות מ\"ד) שאסור לתלמיד לקבל דברי רבו כשיש לו מה להשיב עליהם. כי לפעמים תהיה האמת עמו. כמו שעץ קטן מדליק את הגדול. ע\"ש. וע\"ע להגר\"ח פלאג'י בשו\"ת חקרי לב (חיו\"ד סי' מב), שאין לת\"ח לכבוש את נבואתו בפסקי הלכה, וחייב לגלות דעתו, ונכתב בספר, שאין משוא פנים בדבר. ומרן הקדוש בספר אבקת רוכל (סי' קנה) כתב וז\"ל: ואע\"פ שהריטב\"א והריב\"ש בקיאים יותר בפירוש דברי הראשונים, מ\"מ במילתא דאיכא טעמא ואיכא למותיב מותבינן דלאו קטלי קני באגמא אנן. ע\"ש. ובשו\"ת נודע ביהודה קמא (חאו\"ח סי' לה) ד\"ה ומה, כתב, ואף שבתשו' חות יאיר פסק להיפך, אטו כל מקום שמצאנו הלכה בתשובות האחרונום נחליט כן לדינא, הלא חיך יטעם אוכל. ע\"כ. וע' בשו\"ת רבי ישעיה הראשון (סי' סב) שכ', ומ\"ש מר שלא אחלוק על הרב הגדול רבינו יצחק בעל התוס', חלילה לי מעשות זאת, והגם כי מה אני נחשב לפניו, אך זאת אתי, שכל דבר שאינו נראה בעיני, אפילו אי אמרה יהושע בן נון לא צייתינא ליה. ואיני נמנע לומר הנראה לי לפי שכלי, ואדברה בעדותיך נגד מלכים ולא אבוש, וכמשל הפילוסופים בננס על גבי ענק. ומעולם לא נמנעו האחרונים מלסתור דברי הראשונים, וכמה משניות סתרו האמוראים לומר שאינם הלכה, ואין חכם שיהיה נקי משגיאות</p>\n\n\n",

It's recommended -- and according to some, required -- that a couple consult with their rabbi first before using birth control. Note that in circumstances where pregnancy would be highly harmful to the mother, Jewish law may allow and even require birth control.</p>\n\n<p>Of the various forms of birth control, \"the pill\" is actually considered among the least-objectionable methods, assuming it's medically indicated for this particular couple. (Older versions of the pill often caused breakthrough bleeding, which was a problem as it created a nida status; this tends to be less of an issue today.)</p>\n\n<p>\"Wasting of seed\" is a moot point. (And I'm somewhat annoyed that people get the wrong idea about this, perhaps with biases from some Christian views.) A husband is obligated to physically care for his wife -- whether she's fertile, pregnant, postmenopausal, or whatever. Whether it's likely to impregnate or not is irrelevant; marital relations are never \"wasting seed.\"</p>\n\n<p>As for philosophically and \"what was intended by the Torah\" or the like, I can refer you to yoatzot.org and the like; basically, we apply the law as required; it's not our job to extrapolate and cause conflict with marital harmony, which Judaism values highly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In a discussion I had with Rabbi Shmuel Maybruch, he quoted Rabbi Mordechai Willig as saying that one should not postpone niddah in this way longer than 9 months.  Since a 9 month lapse in periods does commonly occur naturally (through pregnancy), that amount of time is acceptable.  Longer than that he felt was excessive.  </p>\n\n<p>However, R' Maybruch added in his own name that he doesn't understand why any couple, once they are taking birth control, does not take one that decreases menstrual frequency, assuming it works for that couple (i.e. that breakthrough bleeding isn't a problem). </p>\n\n\n",

Is there an obligation in Judaism to recite certain prayers at certain times, or do Jews pray only when they are inspired to do so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Maimonides (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/920161/jewish/Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishneh Torah, Laws of Prayer, Chapter 1</a>) outlines the basic obligations of prayer. He writes that originally there was no fixed prayers, only an obligation to pray somewhat every day. Everyone would pray different amounts based on how 'inspired' they were.</p>\n\n<p>After the destruction of the Jewish Kingdom by the Babylonians (586 BCE), the Sages of the time established fixed times for prayer with fixed content AS A MINIMUM to be recited each day. There are 5 fixed prayers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shacharit: recited in the first third of the day, every day.</li>\n<li>Mincha: recited in the second half of the day, every day.</li>\n<li>Maariv (also called Arvit): recited at night every day.</li>\n<li>Mussaf: recited only on the Sabbath and Holidays. (after Shacharit and before Mincha)</li>\n<li>Ne'ila: recited only on communal fast days, particularly on Yom Kippur. (Recited after Mincha)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These prayers are viewed as obligatory. Other personal prayers to God outside of a formal structure are certainly not discouraged, and can be recited whenever and however depending on the desires of the individual.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The specific daily prayers - morning, afternoon, and evening - are not Biblically mandated. In the Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=26b&format=pdf\">Berachos 26b</a>) there is a disagreement about what their source/basis is. One opinion is that they were originally established respectively by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; the other opinion is that they were established by the rabbis of the early Second Temple era and they represent the sacrifices that were offered in the Temple in the morning and afternoon, and the leftovers that were burnt at night.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Jews pray 3 times a day, facing Jerusalem. The text is mostly fixed, which is why they were holding prayer books, although certain additions can be made on an as-needed basis, such as asking for healing of a specific person. There are differences of opinion as to whether on an air plane the rules for how to pray are like the rules of someone praying on a large vessel (in which someone can easily stand and face towards Jerusalem) or whether it is like praying on a smaller vessel in which it is difficult or dangerous to stand. But I think that's a subject for another question.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does G-d only hear one language?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm a little confused by Rambam Hil. Tefilla 1:4.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Consequently, when someone would pray, he would be limited in his ability to request his needs or to praise the Holy One, blessed be He, in Hebrew, unless other languages were mixed in with it. When Ezra and his court saw this, they established eighteen blessings in sequence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is this saying that G-d only hears Hebrew?</p>\n\n<p>If so, wouldn't this be limiting G-d? What if someone's tongue were cut off, what if he were in captivity and his mouth were shut by his captor? Does G-d not know the intent of our hearts?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>God knows the thoughts of man. That is not the issue here. I believe the Rambam is discussing something else. There is a Gemara in Shabbos (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=12b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">12b</a>) which says as follows:</p>\n\n<p>R. Judah said, One should never petition for his needs in Aramaic.</p>\n\n<p>The Rishonim are bothered by the reason for this. The Rosh (1250-1328) in Berachos (2:2) writes that this is an issue unique to Aramaic, because it is not a nice language. The question is why. Ma'adanei Yom Tov on the spot explains that this is because Aramaic isn't its own language, but rather a distortion of Hebrew. He quotes a Rambam to this effect as well. Therefore Aramaic is not normally an acceptable language for prayer - not because it is difficult for God to understand it, but because it is not considered respectable.</p>\n\n<p>If you look carefully at this Rambam, it seems that he is addressing precisely this issue. He is saying that they were not praying in one language but in a big jumble of many languages. In fact his exact words are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כֵיוָן שֶׁהָיָה מְדַבֵּר, אֵינוֹ יָכוֹל לְדַבֵּר כָּל צְרָכָיו בְּלָשׁוֹן אַחַת אֶלָּא בְּשִׁבּוּשׁ,‏<br>\n  Once he would speak, he couldn't speak out all his needs in one language except with distortions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the reason they established a standard wording, and once they were doing so, what better language to set it to than Hebrew? But of course in truth one may pray in any language, as long as it is a proper language.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Moses send spies who were leaders?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Shelach Lecha, Moses, at the behest of the people, sends out twelve high ranking people to spy on Canaan.  As we know, this wasn't such a success.</p>\n\n<p>Thirty-nine years later, Yehoshua (Joshua ch. 2) sends out two unnamed people (maybe there's a midrash that gives them names, but there's none in pshat).  That worked out fine.</p>\n\n<p>If I were sending a spy, I'd try to send someone unknown.  I would never send, e.g., a governor or congressman, to spy on another country, but rather a random person who won't attract attention.  Why did Moses choose to send famous leaders?  Conversely, why did Yehoshua choose to send (literally) no-names?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>There is a difference between Moshe's intention in sending spies and Yehoshua's intention.</p>\n\n<p>Moshe's intention was to persuade the people and \"boost their confidence\" so that they should be willing and ready to enter the land without complaint. He wanted spies that would scope the land and its inhabitants and return to tell the people, <em>who would listen to and be influenced by their judgement</em>, that the land was beautiful and the cities were conquerable with the help of God. For this reason, Moshe chose <em>influential</em> members of the community, \"ראשי בני ישראל\".</p>\n\n<p>Yehoshua was not interested in influencing the public opinion. He was interested in information that would help him make strategic military decisions. He wanted to know the culture and the mindset of the inhabitants of Canaan. He wanted to know how the cities were oriented, their level of defense etc. For this reason, the spies' standing in the community didn't matter. They weren't going to make any public statements; they were going to report back to Yehoshua directly. No need for twelve spies so that all the tribes would listen. Yehoshua was the only one listening.</p>\n\n<p>Why wasn't Moshe interested in military information? (Well, he was to an extent, but only insomuch as it would influence the public to show they could defeat their enemies.) Malbim attributes this to the fact that Moshe led <em>al pi nes</em>; he led the people miraculously. Had he led them into the land, military strategy would have been irrelevant. He was trying to boost people's confidence, their trust in God, to be worthy of His miracles. Yehoshua, on the other hand, led <em>al pi teva</em>, a natural leadership. (Not to say that he could never perform miracles. He surely did.) Military information was necessary for him to succeed. Thus he sent out spies to gather information.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Perhaps indeed for this reason, Rashbam (13:2) understands the phrase כל נשיא בהם to mean simply \"from among those who volunteer (נשא אותם לבם) for this mission.\" Such people would, of course, have been strong and fearless types, but it is quite possible that they were unknowns up to this point.</p>\n\n<p>Following the usual explanation, that they were indeed leaders, though, Ramban explains that Hashem hoped that they'd then reinforce each other and prevent each other from succumbing to defeatism.</p>\n\n<p>Sforno points out that to some extent this hope was indeed realized: all twelve of them agreed that it was a good land (13:27 and Deut. 1:25) - whereas lesser people might not have recognized its advantages. [The problem began only when ten of the spies claimed that it was unconquerable, thus demonstrating a lack of faith in Hashem - which didn't last very long; the next day, after Hashem's stern rebuke, the Jews' trust in Him reasserted itself (13:40ff and Deut. 1:41ff), just that by then it was too late to undo the chillul Hashem that had been caused.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Actually in Devarim 1:22 the term ויחפרו <strong>is</strong> used. But as will be explained, Moses did <strong>not</strong> send out the 12 leaders for ויחפרו.</p>\n\n<p>In the next verse, 1:23, see Rashi, he says Moses agreed to send out spies only in order for them to feel more comfortable about conquering the land, and he hoped they would change their mind when they saw that Moses was confident about conquering the land. But really he himself felt is was unnecessary because he was confident since God said they would get the land. But that's not what happened. They still wanted to spy.</p>\n\n<p>At that point, he decided to consult with God, but he had something else in mind. He felt it would benefit the nation in another way. It would excite the Israelites to see the wonderful produce of the land \"so they would ascend to it with great eagerness.\" (the quote is from Ramban beginning of Shelach). And by the by it may placate the nation, because it will seem to them that people are being sent to the land for the purpose they requested.</p>\n\n<p>And this is what he was advised to do by God. This is why in Shelach God says send אנשים - \"men\" not מרגלים \"spies\", and why it says ויתורו - which can be translated as and they shall scan out or scour as opposed to the more intensive ויחפרו, to dig and excavate, that which should have remained hidden. This is also why the 12 leaders were sent out, because they knew the wants and interests of their specific tribe, and why all 12 of them went through the entire length of the land and they didn't split up, because no one knew yet where his personal tribe's portion laid, because the lottery was not yet performed. So they made sure to scout the entire land, including their own future portion. And everyone knew about this task, which is uncharacteristic of a spy mission.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, by Joshua, who \"sent out two men to spy secretly\"- שנים אנשים מרגלים חרש. It was two regular men, not leaders of the nation. And only two- the more under the radar the better. And they were to be spies. They only ended up going to Jericho, because as soon as they heard from Rahab that their terror was upon the hearts of everyone in the land, and there was no more \"courage in any man, because of you\", 2:9-11,there was no more need to spy further.</p>\n\n<p>From a talk of Rabbi Menachem Schneerson, Shelach 1991.</p>\n\n\n",

What's the source for the dinar requirement (once it's not \"anything with buying power\", where do we set the bar?), and do we know how Beis Shammai may have viewed <em>kiddushin</em> accordingly?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The Talmud searches for Beit Shammai's reason on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=11&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kiddushin 11a</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The first suggestion, that of Rav Zera, is that an average woman thinks she is important enough to not accept anything less an dinar for kiddushin. The gemara asks, according to this, it should be completely subjective based on the individual girl.

The tree of life is <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0102.htm#9\" rel=\"nofollow\">b'tokh ha-gan</a> (in the midst of the garden), and God spoke to the people <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0505.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow\">mitokh ha-eish</a> (from the midst of the fire).  I learned today that JPS also sometimes translates בְּקֶרֶב as \"in the midst\", as it does in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2003.htm#2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Habbakuk 3:2</a> (בְּקֶרֶב שָׁנִים, in the midst of years).</p>\n\n<p>What's the difference between בְּתוֹךְ in the first two passages and בְּקֶרֶב in Habbakuk?  What does it mean that Habbakuk uses the latter and not the former?</p>\n\n<p>Additional reason for my confusion:\nI understand b'kerev as \"in nearness\", the same way a korban draws us near to God.  But JPS (who knows way more about biblical Hebrew than I do :-) ) translates it as \"in the midst\", which makes me wonder if <em>tavekh</em> and <em>kerev</em> are the same kind of \"midst\".  Both \"midst\" and \"nearness\" indicate proximity, but in English there is a nuanced difference; is that what's happening here, or have I just run into a synonym and it doesn't mean anything special?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This doesn't directly answer the question, but it should be said that in Hebrew quite a lot of words are cognates, so while the JPS's rendering of בקרב שנים could very well be correct, that does not preclude your understanding of the meaning of קרבן from being accurate. Indeed, Radak (1160-1235) writes in his Sefer HaShorashim (entry קרב) that קרב can be a synonym of תוך but that it is not the original meaning, which denotes \"drawing close.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You're right that קרב means \"closeness\"/\"close proximity\", and from that understanding בקרב means \"among\", \"in the midst of\", with the understanding of proximity. However, there is still used the word בקרבי meaning \"in me\". בתוך on the other hand means more like \"in the interior of\". They mean basically the same thing, just in a different sense of understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Like how כן means truly \"thus\", although it is currently used for \"yes\", which is also a valid translation of its meaning. And יש means \"yes\" in the way of something existing; it is mostly used, of course, to mean \"there is/are\".</p>\n\n\n",

This can be quite frustrating, although I imagine that with practice you will develop a feel for what's going on, much as many do with the Bavli. So I'd say keep in mind that the flow will be choppier and that you should always think twice before reading a group of phrases as one piece.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The best online resource would be <a href=\"http://www.yerushalmionline.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">yerushalmionline.org</a>.

Without Rashi, many aspects are hard to pin down with any degree of certainty.</p>\n<p>I'm not aware of any commentary from a Rishon directly on Yerushalmi, other than two on Shekalim (which is commonly treated as a \"Bavli\" masechta). However, there are various compendiums that collect the words of the Rishonim according to the order of Yerushalmi.</p>\n<p>Artscroll has now finished elucidating the Yerushalmi, in the same style as their Bavli elucidation. Other than that, Rav Chaim Kanievsky has a to-the-point commentary that is currently available on Zeraim and Moed. (You can find it on Hebrewbooks.org, but they unfortunately did not enter the title or author information properly. You'll need to search for תלמוד ירושלמי, and the seforim that were printed in Bnei Brak are the ones you're looking for.) There is also a multi-volume commentary called Lev Yerushalayim that I would recommend, but I don't think it's available online.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To add to some of the other answers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maybe 2 and 3: I've been doing Yerushalmi Challah for some months now, and I strongly recommend getting an up-to-date edition, like Oz V'hadar or Artscroll. Learning from one of the older editions, with just the Pnei Moshe or Korbon Aharon, was incredibly frustrating for me and in the end (for me) just not a good way to do it. Some of the mefarshim available in the newer editions are just way easier and faster to use.</li>\n<li>One caveat, addressing 3: since there are no regular Rishonim on Yerushalmi, and it was much less \"worked over\", the girsa and versioning is really different. You can pick one difficult sugya and find among the mefarshim several completely different ways of reading it, along with completely different versions of the text. You'll need to figure out how to deal with that; it is much more prevalent and profound than anything you'll see in the Bavli. In that sense it reminds me more of learning mishnayos Taharos, where again you'll see very very different readings among the mefarshim.</li>\n<li>Little more on 3: Since there is this \"play\" available, in that the girsa is much more flexible, you will quickly see that some of the different mefarshim have very different attitudes towards the trade-off between girsa and difficult pshat. My impression is, for instance, that the Gr\"a changes the girsa very frequently, frequently just turns it upside down, and Maharam Fulda is much more likely to try to work out the pshat in the printed version. They also differ on how hard they will try to get the Yerushalmi to agree with the Bavli. A friend of mine who's been doing Yerushalmi Shevi'is made similar observations to me.</li>\n<li>As for 4: There are <em>many</em> Rishonim who comment on the Yerushalmi, but generally not in an organized fashion. They are scattered all over Shas Bavli, wherever things come up. As I said, I'm doing Challah, and the Rosh (in Menachos) and the Ramban (in Bechoros) have Hilchos Challah, and then there's the Rash on the mishnayos, and of course always the Rambam. Since there is no Talmud Bavli on Challah, they all quote the Yerushalmi constantly; that is the basis of their psak. - But not on the page in the Yerushalmi, so I end up just learning those sources separately. They are often heavily represented on one sugya and non-existent on another.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

The phrase hit me as being unusual .Tosfos on that Gemoro printed on Daf 13a says something very interesting which to sum up it would seem that 120 was just the perfect or most Hiddur number of trumpets to have and that is what is enumerated in the Possuk and that is why it is the upper limit.</p>\n\n<p>Now we all famously know that when we say Ad Meoh VeEsrim to someone it is based on the Possuk at the end of Parshas Beriishis that the amount of years a man should live should be 120 MEAOH VE ESRIM SHONOH but if you look carefully there is no word AD  mentioned in the Possuk.</p>\n\n<p>We find the Medrash Rabba at the end of Parshas Vayechi (Parsha 100 ois 10 )talks about very Choshuve people citing Moshe Rabbeinu,Hillel Hazokein,Rabbi Yochono Ben Zakkai and Rabbi Akiva who all lived till 120 and all of them had their lives split into 3 sets of 40.</p>\n\n<p>PERHAPS (I have no source for this jump) somebody put these 3 things together a) the ultimate age a person will live to as the Possuk in Bereishis indicates is 120 (even though at the time nobody died that early-I think the first mention of someone dying earlier than that is Yoisef 110) b) the Medrash of Vayechi showing those very Choshuv people - leaders of Klal Yisroel who lived till 120 and c) more importantly the Gemoro in Erachin together with Tosfos that AD MEAH VE ESRIM is the ideal number or age and just combined them together,that you could not get a better Brocho living till 120 like those 4 great leaders and that 120 is just the most perfect number<br>\n(as the late Yeshuois Moshe -the previous Viznitzer Rebbe would say \"Ich Hob GeKlert BeDerech Efsher)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Shlomo Yosef Zevin of Chabad relates this story: (see Artscroll Judaica Classics: A Treasury of Chassidic Tales on the Torah, vol.

The Chozeh responded that such a thing was beyond mortal man. R' Tzvi then wished his Rebbe would live until 120. The Chozeh said: \"But that's not forever?\"</p>\n\n<p>R' Tzvi then explained his own explanation:</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Chelek (last chapter of Sanhedrin) says that the world will last 6000 years.

I think that this applies here too.</p>\n\n\n",

However, R. Karo is not necessarily assigning greater authority to the Zohar than to the Yerushalmi. First-of-all, it is possible that he holds that the proof from the Yerushalmi is not a clear-cut proof (i.e. perhaps the Yerushalmi is not actually conflicting with the Zohar), and second-of-all, it is possible that his reasoning is not based on measuring authority but instead based on what he wrote in the last line.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Emotional abuse between spouses in Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How does Judaism regard emotional abuse in a marriage? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Let's start by saying that - duh, it's prohibited. Anyone is prohibited from <em>ona'at devarim</em>, wronging others verbally. Additionally <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/1893/21\">the Talmud says</a> \"love your neighbor like yourself\" is a guiding principle prohibiting going into a marriage likely to be one filled with contempt, so it should be a no-brainer that abusive behavior is out.</p>\n<p>The Talmud, in the seventh chapter of Ketubot, lists a series of behaviors that would be grounds for divorce with a financial settlement favoring the wife. It's clearly describing some forms of psychologically abusive behavior.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ז,א  המדיר את אשתו מליהנות לו--עד שלושים יום, יעמיד פרנס; יתר מכן,\nיוציא וייתן כתובה.  רבי יהודה אומר</p>\n<p>בישראל, חודש אחד יקיים; ושניים, יוציא וייתן כתובה.  ובכוהנות--שניים,\nיקיים; ושלושה, יוציא וייתן כתובה.  [ב] המדיר את אשתו שלא תטעום אחד מכל\nהפירות, יוציא וייתן כתובה.  רבי יהודה אומר, בישראל, יום אחד יקיים;\nושניים, יוציא וייתן כתובה.  ובכוהנת, שניים, יקיים; ושלושה, יוציא וייתן\nכתובה.  [ג] המדיר את אשתו שלא תתקשט באחד מכל המינים, יוציא וייתן\nכתובה.  רבי יוסי אומר, בענייות, שלא נתן קצבה; ובעשירות, שלושים יום.</p>\n<p>ז,ב  [ד] המדיר את אשתו שלא תלך לבית אביה--בזמן שהן עימה בעיר, חודש אחד\nיקיים; ושניים, יוציא וייתן כתובה.  ובזמן שהן בעיר אחרת--רגל אחד,\nיקיים; ושלושה, יוציא וייתן כתובה.</p>\n<p>ז,ג  [ה] המדיר את אשתו שלא תלך לבית האבל או לבית המשתה--יוציא וייתן\nכתובה, מפני שנעל בפניה; ואם היה טוען משם דבר אחר, רשאי.  אמר לה, על\nמנת שתאמרי לאיש פלוני מה שאמרת לי, או מה שאמרתי ליך, או שתהא ממלא\nומערה לאשפה--יוציא וייתן כתובה.</p>\n<p>Should one make a vow that his wife be prohibited from getting any tangible benefit from him ... after thirty days, he must release her [from the marriage] and pay ... should prohibit her from tasting any single type of fruit ... or from wearing any single type of jewelry ... he must release her and pay ... if he prohibits her [for more than a few weeks] from visiting her family ... or attending shiva houses or weddings, he must release her and pay as he has locked her up ... if he demands \"you must tell so-and-so the [deeply personal] things you told me\", or \"that I told you\"; or [if he demands] that she repeatedly fill up a bucket and then spill it out ... he must release her and pay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So emotional abuse certainly can be grounds for a divorce, and will affect the monetary settlement.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, Jewish law with regards to torts is limited to actions, not words. (Though testifying in court is considered an action.) I would be obligated to pay for embarrassment for slapping someone in the face, pulling down his pants in public, or spitting on him; but the courts per se wouldn't do anything if I just called him a name (albeit a terrible one that horribly hurt him). Nonetheless, per Rabbi Warburg's article in Tradition (Spring 2012), occasionally Jewish courts have ruled that extrajudicial measures may be necessary as a matter of public policy, and have awarded damages for verbal abuse as well.</p>\n\n\n",

These punishments are there to help the Jews do Teshuva. These two points show that according to the Torah, Bad times for the Jews leads to Teshuva.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, in our time we see the opposite happening. When times went bad for the Jews (in the times of the Czar, Stalin, and Hitler), Jews went progressively worse. Jews were generally religious until the late 1800s. In Russia, as a result of the oppression, many Jews became Communists and many converted altogether. When Stalin came, many Jews who still stayed religious left Judaism (they didn't do Teshuva, they just left out of fear). When Jews came to America (and were in general poor and were at least somewhat oppressed), they stopped being religious to work on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover (and especially) after the Holocaust, most survivors stopped being religious completely (if G-d exists, where was He when I was in .... ??!!)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>However, lately we started seeing another pattern. As Jews started feeling better, they stated being religious. After the victory of the six-day war, many people started coming back to Judaism.

(For example, creation ex-nihilo, and the accounts of the Mabul, Avraham's miraculous escape from Nimrod, and the desert wanderings (see Moreh Nevuchim 3:50 and Hilchos Avoda Zorra 1:3)</p>\n<p>The main source for the explanation for why Amoraim abstain from disagreeing with Tannaim (when they do) is a passage in the Talmud Yerushalmi on Payah 2:6:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Said Rebbi Zeyra in the name of Rebbi Yochonon: \"If you come across a mishna whose          reason you cannot understand, do not brush it aside and replace its law with another one.   For many laws were told to Moses at Sinai, and all of them are lodged throughout the Mishna.\"</p>\n<p>Said Rebbi Abbin: \"How true! For behold the halacha regarding \"two varieties of one grain\"[as a prime example]! If Nachum HaLavlar had not come and explained to us [that it was a halacha L'Moshe MiSinai], would we ever have known?!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this source, one deduces that immediately following the formulation of the Mishna—the time of Rebbi Yochonon, at the beginning of the era of the Amoraim (c. 4000, 250 CE), the tumultuous state of affairs caused an obscurity over which laws had originated with drashos, permitting challenge, and which laws had really originated from Sinai, precluding question.</p>\n<p>As summarized in the final paragraph of that chapter,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All details in the Mishna known not to be kabballos, and all\nrabbinical decrees not yet voted upon by a Tannaitic Sanhedrin, were\nchallengeable. On such issues, an Amora could conceivably differ\nwith a Tanna. As we mentioned above, there were rare instances in\nwhich Amoraim exercised this power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The original question asked was: \"[W]hether the Gemara's subject is practical Halacha or not...Why do Rishonim feel freer to disagree on an explanation of Chumash than to disagree with a Gemara?\"</p>\n\n<p>I would answer that the project of the rishonim was to distinguish between the lessons in the Chumash that can be procured through the peshat approach, and those that could be procured only through the drash approach.  (And each rishon had his own definition of what qualifies as “peshat.”) They were intent in identifying the peshat level of the pesukim. When they differed with a Midrash in interpreting a posuk, they meant the Midrash’s lesson could not be gained through the peshat approach, but at best through the drash-approach. (And sometimes, they tagged the lesson as a minority and even unacceptable opinion, just as can be the case in halacha.) </p>\n\n\n",

Moshe Isserles holds that Mikrah, Mishnah, Gemara, and Midrash require a blessing.</p>\n\n<p>5) Levush holds that Mikrah, Mishnah, Talmud, and Midrash all require a blessing because they are all called \"Torah\".</p>\n\n<p>6) Shulchan Aruch Harav holds that Mikrah, Mishnah, Talmud, and Midrash each require a blessing because they are all \"Torah\" and were all given to Moshe at Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>It seems apparent that the accepted ruling is that all four categories require a blessing. However, the problem is that most of these terms are somewhat vague. What is meant by the Written Law, the Oral Law, Mikrah, Mishnah, Gemara, Talmud, and Midrash? This cuts to the heart of your question, because it is conceivable that all three of your categories fall under one of these categories and thus would require a blessing, but it is also conceivable that they do not fall under any of these categories, and thus would not require a blessing. </p>\n\n<p>The Aruch Hashulchan attempts to address this problem. He quotes the students of Rabbeinu Yonah who explain that when each opinion in the Gemara adds on Midrash, Mishnah, and Talmud, it is on account of the fact that those works directly explain the Scriptural verses, make derivations therefrom, or explain the laws of the Torah. However, anything which is not based on Scriptural verses would not require a blessing. Included in this, he says, might be the Midrash Rabba and the Kabbala. However, he then notes that according to the Levush the reason is that they are all called \"Torah\", and according to the Shulchan Aruch Harav the reason is that they were all given at Sinai. If that is the case then certainly Aggada and Kabbala would require a blessing since they were given at Sinai. He notes again that this seems to be against the students of Rabbeinu Yonah and he leaves off inconclusively.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צריך לברך בין למקרא בין למשנה בין לגמרא בין למדרש והיינו מדרש המקראות\n  במכילתא וספרא וספרי [רש\"י ברכות יא:] ודע שיש להסתפק בלומד דברי אגדה\n  כמדרש רבה או חכמת הקבלה אם מחויב לברך ברכת התורה דהנה בגמרא שם יש\n  פלוגתא דרב הונא אמר דרק למקרא צריך לברך ור' יוחנן אמר דגם למשנה צריך\n  לברך [גירסת הרי\"ף] ופירשו תלמידי רבינו יונה משום דהמשנה מפרשת טעמי\n  המצות ור\"א אמר דגם לגמרא צריך לברך משום שהתלמוד מפרש עיקרי הפסוקים\n  [תר\"י] והמסקנא דגם למדרש צריך לברך משום שבמדרש לומד ג\"כ מהפסוקים מקל\n  וחומר ומגזירה שווה ומהמדות שהתורה נדרשת בהם [שם] ולפ\"ז משמע שאין החיוב\n  רק בדברים שמפרשים דיני התורה אבל דברי אגדה או קבלה שאין עיקרם לדינים\n  והלכות א\"צ ברכה אבל אם נאמר הטעם משום שהכל ניתנה למשה מסיני [הגר\"ז] או\n  משום דכולהו תורה מקרי [לבוש] פשיטא שגם אגדה וקבלה ניתנה למשה מסיני\n  ומקרו תורה אבל מלשון תלמידי רבינו יונה לא משמע כן וצ\"ע לדינא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It would appear based on all of the above that you would not be required to make a blessing on the three categories you mentioned, except for the select parts that contain Torah, and even then perhaps only if they contain explanations/derivations of Scriptural verses or explanations of Torah Laws (for example if the biography relates a Torah explanation of its protagonist). Note that according to this there are perhaps many sefarim that (barring, perhaps, certain selections) would also not require a blessing. </p>\n\n<p>As always, consult your rabbi for a practical ruling.</p>\n\n\n",

After all, why wouldn't smoking be like ingesting food, as on some level you are ingesting the tobacco and sometimes it is even flavored?</p>\n\n<p>(Please do not do the anti-smoking rants: we covered that extensively <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/10513/759\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>What you are asking - whether smoking can be considered eating/drinking - is actually the subject of a disagreement in the Rishonim. Tosafos (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=66b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">AZ 66b</a>) directly imply that smoking is considered drinking. The Rif (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14310&st=&pgnum=602&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chullin 32 [in Rif pages]</a>) directly implies otherwise. This all comes to the fore in the Halachic question of ריחא מלתא - whether 'scent is a thing', i.e. when cooking two things in the same oven where there is no transference of flavor but there is a transference of scent, is the scent Halachicly like flavor in that a non-kosher scent can render something non-kosher. The letter-of-the-law as ruled by the Shulchan Aruch and Rema in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=510&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">YD 108</a> clearly follows the Rif. However, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=512&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rema</a> says to be concerned about the opinion of Tosafos unless doing so will cause one a significant loss.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, for those who follow the Rema there would be reason to look at smoking as a form of drinking, and therefore one could posit that unless it is difficult to do so the Rema require tevilah for the hookah. On the other hand according to the other Poskim including the Shulchan Aruch who hold like the Rif, smoking does not constitute any form of eating/drinking, and thus the hookah would not require tevilah.</p>\n\n<p>However, based on my argument <a href=\"http://beismedrash.blogspot.com/2012/06/regarding-kashrus-of-flavored.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> - that something which is not edible is not Halachically called food - one could say that even the Rema will not require tevilah for the bowl that carries the tobacco, though maybe still for thing which holds the water.</p>\n\n\n",

However I disagree. Se what I have written <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/17270/1601\">here</a>. The same argument applies here as well, except with an added leniency: You don't know whether there is non-kosher stuff inside there, and even if there is, it is mixed into the tobacco and unrecognizable. Thus it could be said that even the Rema would agree to be lenient here l'chatchila. For further elaboration, see what I have written <a href=\"http://beismedrash.blogspot.com/2012/06/regarding-kashrus-of-flavored.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in this blog post</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The question is if the vapor is considered zeah (steam) assumably the discerning factor would be if the vapor would turn into moisture upon its settling on a surface. If it is considered zeah than it would seem that the taste infused tobacco would need a hechsher. The Hookah acts as a mini oven where the Reach (lit. smell, it refers to the non-moistured particles of food that spread throughout the oven during the cooking process here it would refer to the smoke) is passed through the water (which smoothes out the smoke) and then is inhaled via the pipe. If the tobacco is not kosher than the water becomes not kosher (the water is rarely 60 times the tobacco). Even though intaking Reach is not considered halachikally eating, assumably intaking Zeah (which is considered of substance) would be. Therefore, the relevant question is if the water that becomes part of the smoke that is being consumed, is considered zeah, or not. This seemingly is not such a hard experiment to run. All one needs to do is to drag on the pipe of a hookah onto a surface and see if moisture forms.</p>\n\n\n",

Maybe smoking should fit this category - the smoke enters the mouth and smokers enjoy it.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.210.2?lang=he&with=Magen%20Avraham&lang2=he#:%7E:text=%D7%9B%D7%A9%D7%97%D7%95%D7%96%D7%A8%20%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%98.%20%D7%93%D7%9C%D7%90,%D7%A2%D7%A1%D7%99%27%20%D7%A8%D7%99%22%D7%95%20%D7%A1%D7%99%22%D7%92:\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham</a>  is not sure because he thinks it can be compared to two different cases, one which gets a bracha and one which doesn't. On the one hand, tasting food and spitting it out does not get a bracha (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.210.2?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 210:2</a>). Maybe smoking should be compared to that (he says that one does not \"swallow\" the smoke but spits it out). On the other hand, one does make a bracha on smell, and smoking might be comparable to smell. My understanding of this Magen Avraham (although I admit, it is not entirely clear), is not that he is suggesting smoking <em>is</em> smelling or <em>is</em> eating, but rather he is trying to figure out if smoking, which is neither of those things, should get a bracha based on comparison to that which does get a bracha.\nThe <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.216.1?lang=he&with=Magen%20Avraham&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham (216:1)</a>  quotes the Ramban's general rule, so he is consistent in that he is open to broadening pleasures which deserve brachos. One could, however, argue that really there is no general rule by brachos, and we only have brachos where chazal instituted them explcitily (eating and smell). If this were the case, then there really is no question. This seems to be the view of Rav Yaakov Emdin (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7920&st=&pgnum=181\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mur Uktzia 210</a>, toward the end), where he says that it is pashut that smoking would not get a bracha since it is not at all eating. He takes it for granted that if it isn't eating that it doesn't get a bracha. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.210.2?lang=he&with=Mishnah%20Berurah&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Brurah (210:17)</a> paskons like Rav Yaakov Emdin.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Best way to translate \"קא\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud, there is a widely used word \"קא\", like in the sentence והא קא קרי (in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=13&format=pdf\">Berahot 13:1</a>).</p>\n\n<p>What is the best way to translate it to Hebrew or English? Or maybe just skip it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>(Moved from comment section):</p>\n\n<p>The word קא indicates that the action is on-going or in the state of being done. It corresponds to the English prefix a-, which used to be used much more frequently but now is uncommon in the English of the northern United States yet it is still very common in the English of the southern United States. </p>\n\n<p>Here are some examples in English taken from songs and demonstrating all tenses:\n1. She was a-rocking and a-rolling.\n2. I'm a-coming right now.\n3. We will be a-singing and a-dancing all night long.</p>\n\n<p>It has also been incorporated in some words, such as aglow, alight, and afix. </p>\n\n<p>For translating the Aramaic, you could do one of at least three things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Omit it: Its absence won't make that much difference in English. You might, however, need to add something to the translation of the entire passage in order to be clear that the action is or was in the state of being done. For example, \"He was reading when something happened\" (i.e., you'd add the word 'when' to clarify that the reading was on-going at the time something else happened).</p></li>\n<li><p>Use the Old English / Southern United States prefix:  \"He was a-reading, and something happened.\" (Note that the 'when' can now be changed to 'and' or even omitted and we still understand that the reading was on-going when something happened.) </p></li>\n<li><p>Insert further clarifying words, such as: \"He was in the process (or, in the act) of reading (and) something happened.\" These clauses can also be broken into two seperate sentences, as they often are in Aramaic.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Actually, the fact that the Aramaic often seems to be presenting the narrative as two seperate sentences may be why you'd want to translate it as \"in the process of\" or something like that. If you omit it, the on-going / concurrent nature of the action is not as strongly emphasized, as in:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>He was reading. Mar said to him...(whatever he said). In this example, it's not quite as strongly emphasized in the English that he was in the act of reading when Mar said something to him as it is in the Aramaic.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That's why you might want to translate it as:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>He was in the act of reading. Mar said to him...</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can you bowl on shabbos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the movie the Big Lebowski Walter explains that he is shomer shabbos and that he can't \"roll\" (meaning bowl) on shabbos. My question is, if he were able to get to the alley without violating shabbos and if he were allowed to bowl for free, other than possibly uv'din d'chol, is there any reason he <strong>can't</strong> bowl on shabbos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>In every bowling alley I've been to, the operation of the lanes depends on electro-mechanical devices that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinsetter\">reset the pins</a> and return the ball. As these actions are triggered by the bowler's bowling and are helpful to the bowler, they'd constitute a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesik_reisha\">pesik reisha</a> denicha leih\" - an expected consequence that's desirable - and would therefore be forbidden as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat#Use_of_electricity\">use of electricity</a> on Shabbat.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The rolling ball is the \"koach\" of the original person, analogous to a thrown rock. When the ball then hits the pins/sensors/etc that action is \"koach kocho\" of the original person, meaning it is twice removed from the person himself (for the definition see the Rambam Hilchos Rotzeach 6:15). </p>\n\n<p>Now see the Avnei Nezer OH 230:2 who argues that \"koach kocho\" is potur on Shabbos, meaning that the act of the pin is only d'rabanan anyway. And the response from the sensor is psik reisha, as noted in the other answers. And the overall action of the machine is just an issur d'rabanan, since it is just electrical/mechanical activity that is not in the form of lighting/burning (as is clear from the tshuvos of R. Henkin and discussed elsewhere on this forum), no different from an electric fan.</p>\n\n<p>This could perhaps be coupled with the view of the Rashba quoted in Shulchan Aruch OH 316 (Magen Avraham there) that allows psik reisha if the intention is a permissible act as well as an impermissible one (i.e. one wants to close the door, which is totally permissible, and in the process a deer is trapped inside). </p>\n\n<p>So adding all this together, it seems clear there is sufficient room to be lenient about bowling on Shabbos, aside from issues of \"uvda d'chol\" which were excluded by the original questioner.</p>\n\n<p>(As an aside, we often rely on this koach kocho argument for opening refrigerators on Shabbos, when the action of opening the fridge will let warm air in and surely turn on the cooling unit, a psik reisha that is nicha leih, but people are meikal; also perhaps because of the Rashba.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/39_categories_of_activity#Demolition\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> addresses the question of permissability if only gutterballs are thrown thus voiding the questions of binyan and soser. I quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Of interest, this would include bowling, as the pins are knocked down, hopefully, during play. However, even if only gutterballs are thrown, the mere intention of knocking down pins is a violation of the prohibition against demolition. It is a matter of rabbinic debate as to whether intentionally throwing gutterballs during Shobbos is subject to the prohibition, as no demolition occurs. Commentary tends towards making this a violation as well, since the very act of bowling involves causing a machine to reconstruct the pin matrix upon each round, which action is initiated by the participating player.\n  See further: Mishneh Torah Shabbos 10:15; Chayei Adam Shabbos 39, 43</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In order to establish a system of that understanding, the chumash instructs the people to adhere to the particular teachings of those who, in each generation, are the authorities based on their learning and understanding. The torah is not in heaven, but on earth for us to live by so we need the experts who satisfy particular criteria to be those who help us live our lives properly. Pesukim 8-11 of devarim 17 point out the process and hand the mantle of that judicial and interpretive authority to the leaders of each generation.</p>\n\n<p>ח כִּי יִפָּלֵא מִמְּךָ דָבָר לַמִּשְׁפָּט, בֵּין-דָּם לְדָם בֵּין-דִּין לְדִין וּבֵין נֶגַע לָנֶגַע--דִּבְרֵי רִיבֹת, בִּשְׁעָרֶיךָ:  וְקַמְתָּ וְעָלִיתָ--אֶל-הַמָּקוֹם, אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ בּוֹ.  ט וּבָאתָ, אֶל-הַכֹּהֲנִים הַלְוִיִּם, וְאֶל-הַשֹּׁפֵט, אֲשֶׁר יִהְיֶה בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם; וְדָרַשְׁתָּ וְהִגִּידוּ לְךָ, אֵת דְּבַר הַמִּשְׁפָּט.  י וְעָשִׂיתָ, עַל-פִּי הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר יַגִּידוּ לְךָ, מִן-הַמָּקוֹם הַהוּא, אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר יְהוָה; וְשָׁמַרְתָּ לַעֲשׂוֹת, כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר יוֹרוּךָ.  יא עַל-פִּי הַתּוֹרָה אֲשֶׁר יוֹרוּךָ, וְעַל-הַמִּשְׁפָּט אֲשֶׁר-יֹאמְרוּ לְךָ--תַּעֲשֶׂה:  לֹא תָסוּר, מִן-הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר-יַגִּידוּ לְךָ--יָמִין וּשְׂמֹאל</p>\n\n<p>However, this power is not as extensive as it seems.

I do my best to ignore the sadly common <a href=\"http://www.google.co.za/search?q=susurrus\" rel=\"nofollow\">susurrus</a> in shul, accepting that most people present in my shul are simply waiting for the service to end, being unable to understand the Hebrew they are reading.</p>\n\n<p>In the spirit of \"it takes a village to raise a child\", though, if there are young kids with whom I have a friendly relationship who are talking loudly I will shush them audibly, trying to show exasperation rather than anger.</p>\n\n<p>If there are adults making a lot of noise while I'm davening I try to to show them that they're disturbing me by quietly and without fuss closing my eyes and... ahem... <strong>sticking my fingers in my ears</strong>. Yes, it makes me look stupid, but I feel it gets my point across accurately and without embarrassing any (other) individual. This is an <em>indirect</em> rebuke and has never evoked an angry response. It doesn't <em>work</em> very well (the conversation  usually continues), but it's my way of protesting. </p>\n\n<p>Let me also say that I do not to any degree expect the talking behaviour of the shul to change through my example. I feel obliged to protest, but it would be tragically arrogant to think I have that much influence. My part is to behave properly myself.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>we are am yisrael and we must tolerate each other, we must do everything we can to try and be united, so the best solution is sit next to people that dont talk</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Call out for the people to be quiet!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Efshar LeSoḥato Asur - because or even though?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm trying to comprehend the concept of \"אפשר לסוחטו אסור\" (roughly: \"if it's possible to extract it - something prohibited from something otherwise permitted - it is prohibited\").  As far as I can tell, logically, it should mean \"<em>even though</em> it is possible to extract it, it is prohibited\".  My problem is that, whenever I encounter it in Hebrew, it is just the expression alone, and whenever I encounter it in English, it is translated more or less as I did above (except it's usually not fully translated; it usually goes something like \"we hold אפשר לסוחטו is אסור\"), which is entirely unhelpful in trying to actually understand the concept. In fact, that \"translation\", almost sounds like it is to be understood as, \"<em>because</em> it's possible to extract it, it is prohibited.\"  That can't be the correct rendering, can it?</p>\n\n<p>If it's the former, why does the literature on it use that expression (אפשר לסוחטו אסור)?  Why not just say \"we don't Pasken that it is possible to (Halachically) extract it,\" or, \"it is not possible to extract it,\" which are much more common (and in my opinion clearer) ways of expressing that the Halachah rejects a proposed line of reasoning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The gemara in Hullin (108a) discusses the halachic status of אפשר לסוחטו, and brings different opinions of whether it that thing is assur or mutar once squeezed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אי קסבר אפשר לסוחטו מותר חתיכה אמאי נעשית נבלה אלא קסבר אפשר לסוחטו\n  אסור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What you see here is a common grammatical usage in the gemara -- a noun phrase identifying some object, followed by an adjective explaining the status of that object. אפשר לסוחטו is the noun phrase, and אסור (or מותר in the gemara above) is the adjective.</p>\n\n<p>The translations that you've presented translate the phrase אפשר לסוחטו as a clause, adding in words like \"if it's\" or \"even though it's\". A more helpful and grammatically faithful translation of the three words אפשר לסוחטו אסור would be \"something from which it is possible to squeeze [the taste of the issur it soaked up] is assur [anyway].\" (You might further explain this by saying that even though the taste of the issur has been removed through squeezing, the <em>din</em> of issur still can't be removed from it.)</p>\n\n\n",

So far as stress is concerned, the phrase is pronounced <em>vedibarTA BAM</em>, with a stress on the final syllable of the first word and on the second word as well. (This differentiates it from <em>vediBARta BAM</em>, which would be a perfective: \"and you spoke of these things\".)</p>\n<p>So far as vowel quality is concerned, there are different traditions. Given that the word is written (in Deuteronomy 6:7) with a qamatz, many Ashkenazim would pronounce it like the O-vowel in \"drop\" (Australian English pronunciation), while many Sephardim would pronounce it like the A-vowel in \"rum\" (AustlE again). Even if you are Ashkenazi, you might prefer to pronounce it with the Sephardi pronunciation, given that this is the standard pronunciation in the State of Israel.</p>\n<p>Finally, the mishna in Berakhot 2:3 states that you have not fulfilled your obligation in reciting the Shema unless you are precise about the letters (דקדק באותיותיה), and different commentators interpret this differently. Some (like Melekhet Shlomo), think it refers to aspirating non-aspirated consonants (and vice versa) or to running letters together, while others (like Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro) think it refers to running two words together as one. Both of these interpretations are combined in the Shulchan Arukh (Orach Chayim 61).</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, while most authorities think that you need to be careful about the consonants (or at least consistent with them), I don't think anybody worries about the vowels. Consider what Rabbi Moshe Isserles says, on Orach Chayim 61:24. Where the mechaber states that one needs to read the Shema according to the way in which it is vocalised in the Torah, he notes that \"in these lands [ie: in Europe], people don't do this, but those who are precise with the language might be strict in this matter\" (אבל לא נהגו כן במדינות אלו. ומכל מקום המדקדקים מחמירים בכך).</p>\n<p>Finally, even the mechaber concedes (Orach Chayim 62:1) that while it is a mitzvah to be precise about the words, you have still fulfilled your obligation even if you were not.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I learnt from a classic textbook on Hebrew grammar by Weingreen that a patah carries the sound 'a' as in 'had', and kamatz gadol/kamatz katan are 'a' as in 'are' and 'o' as in 'hop' (I actually think Weingreen said 'oh' as in 'hope', which might explain why Americans say Moe-she and Aha-rone?!).</p>\n\n<p>In any case I recently came across a fascinating piece in Conversations, a collection of essays put out I think quarterly by www.jewishideas.org. The piece in questions describes three sets of vowel-sounding styles. One with 5 vowels (I think Alexandrian/Egyptian/Southern Israel), 6 (Babylonian), and 7 (Yavneh, Israel or thereabouts - the edition of Conversations is not currently with me).</p>\n\n<p>Styles where kamatz and patach are the same sound 'Are', where seghol and tzeirei are not distinguished - it is fascinating, and opened my eyes, frankly. See if you can get your hands on a copy of the current edition - issue 13: insights from the Sephardic experience.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, they prayed \"Hashem save us from whichever nation this is.\"</p>\n\n<p>I have two questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why did they change their language without changing their clothes. If anything, changing uniforms is easier than learning a new language.</li>\n<li>Canaanites are dark skinned (they are descendants of Cham) while amalekim are light (descendants of Eisav).

If changing clothes is easier, than why didn't the Amalekim do it?</p>\n\n<p>He gives an answer that he admits is a stretch. He says that it is possible that they didn't change their clothes because they had some kind of witchcraft in their clothes, and didn't want to give that up.  [My note - <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9878/showrashi/true#v9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi in Shemot 17:9</a> says that the Amalekim were sorcerers and implies that they use witchcraft in battle.]</p>\n\n<p>Then the Maskil LeDavid questions Rashi statement entirely. He asks where Rashi knows that they didn't change their clothes. The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14573&pgnum=522\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yalkut Shimoni (764)</a> that is the source for this statement says that they changed both their clothes and their  language. This directly contradicts Rashi's statement.</p>\n\n<p>The Maskil LeDavid then wonders why none of the commentaries on Rashi address this. and concludes that this requires more study.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>After bringing this Maskil LeDavid, The Chumash Shai LeMorah says that in the first printed edition of Rashi, the version was as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They saw that their clothes and language were like Canaanites, but they were not similar to Canaanites...\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This incidentally, answers your second question. If they dressed and talked like Canaanites, how were they not similar to Canaanites? Their skin color was different.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, sometimes when the Torah says Canaanites it means that specific nation, and other times it refers to the 7 nations in general (see for example, <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=4&perek=21&mefaresh=ezra\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Ibn Ezra on the verse</a>, although he disagrees that it was Amalek). If we say that here Canaanite refers to the 7 nations in general, and not the Canaanite nation specifically, then the question falls off. (Although then you could question how the Jews realized something was up). Some research would be needed to see if we can answer that here.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is addressed directly in the link to Rashi you provide:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[Midrash Aggadah , Yalkut Shimoni from Midrash Yelammedenu . Note that in these sources, the Amalekites changed their dress as well, and that version is found also in the Reggio edition of Rashi . The Yemenite manuscript, however, conforms with our reading. See Chavel fn. 87, Yosef Hallel , Leket Bahir fn. ד. See also Num. Rabbah 19:20.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, assuming that this is the correct reading, then obtaining and outfitting an entire army with Canaanite clothing is quite expansive, and might not be doable on short time. Meanwhile, being citizens of greater Mesopotamia, they might already know enough Canaanite to get by, and can make certain they are overheard.</p>\n\n<p>But all this is a kasha on a medrash. I suspect that if the clothing/language divide is authentic, then that detail is derived from a close reading of the pesukim. And I don't know that it is useful or productive to ask questions of this sort. Even <em>if</em> this midrash was intended literally and is historical, we cannot necessarily know the answer. It is a kasha on a maaseh. And any answers we produce might be random and untrue.</p>\n\n<p>The goal / background of the midrash, by the way, is to address the issue that it seems that this section was added by Yehoshua, describing the actual conquest inside Eretz Yisrael. (See Ibn Ezra for a rejection, or just see <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2008/07/masei-did-joshua-add-section-about-arad.html\">this post</a> for details,. and perhaps <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2008/07/masei-what-did-king-of-arad-hear.html\">here</a> as well.) The Canaanite king of Arad, and the conquest of Chormah, is described in sefer Yehoshua. By making these Canaanites (with some Scriptural justification), we explain why these are describes as Canaanites. This avenue of exploration is, IMHO, much more productive.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of Canaanites being specifically black, I'm not so positive about that. Despite midrashim one might drum up, I think I can drum up counter-midrashim. Specifically, the midrash in which Rabbi Yuda ben Simon attributes a statement of Avraham to his wife as they are about to enter Egypt, coming from the land of Canaan.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'll answer from my own head so please, don't ask for any real \"proof\" - this is simply how it strikes me. You mistranslate rashi.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi says \"ראו ישראל לבושיהם כלבושי עמלקים\" using the word \"levusheyhem\" not \"bigdeyhem.\" They might have altered their clothing -- begadim, but not their raiment -- the decorative flourishes (the Stone tanach translates the root lvsh as raiment in Yeshayahu 63:2 to distinguish it from bgd in the same pasuk) and that's what Bnei Yisro'el saw and recognized. Maybe tattoos, maybe feathers, but something separate from the regular begadim.</p>\n\n<p>The little things which might have seemed extra and personal to amalek, and which they thought would not give them away while they were wearing the actual kena'ani clothing did indeed give them away. Just an idea based on the specific language rashi quotes (my rashi doesn't source this as a particular medrash but the Stone chumash says it is one). If I saw the text of the medrash, that might clarify.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The concept of קם ליה בדרבה מיניה\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm trying to understand this concept. I've Googled around and could't find any straightforward answers. I don't need too many details, just the explanation that's given in the Gemara (I understand this is derived from the Gemara). Can somebody provide the types of situations this applies to. I'm sorry for typing the way I am, I just heard of this concept and can't get to any books to go deeper into it (as I am on a summer vacation).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>here is something I wrote on the subject -- I hope it gives a basis and provides avenues for future investigation.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Kam lei b’deraba minei – During the commission of an aveirah, an individual may invoke more than one penalty.  Should he have to be subject to more than one or not? In many situations, the gemara holds kam lei – the transgressor stays subject only to the worse/worst of the punishments. He is not required to be subject to two penalties if both came about by the exact same actions. The gemara in chullin 81b brings up the case of someone who is liable for avodah zarah through his slaughtering, and thus deserves death; he can not also be held liable for oto v’et b’no (slaughtering a mother and offspring on the same day).  The worse punishment, killing, is enough.  Gittin 52b also comes to this conclusion regarding the mixing of foodstuff. </p>\n\n<p>However, this concept of double liability becomes more clouded when the issues of shogeg and meizid, and the idea of physical punishment versus karet or monetary payment are mixed in.  Rav Meir, on ketuvot 33b is of the opinion that a person can receive 2 punishments simultaneously as long as the stricter one is not the death penalty. Lashes can be imposed along with monetary repayment or fine. On 34b-35a the question arises surrounding the aveirah done b’shogeg. If it would have received a certain level of punishment if done b’meizid, does it still need a fine imposed in the shogeg case? And what level of meizid punishment must be hanging over the head of the b’meizid to exempt the shogeg? (Rebbi Yochanan and reish lakish’s argument). When the more severe of the two punishments is karet (according to the machloket on Shavuot 33a, pesachim 29a and ketuvot 30a) Rebbi Nechunya ben Hakanah says that the transgressor is exempt from the lesser penalty but the chachomim say he is still liable. The mishna on bava kama 70a which makes one who steals and slaughters an animal on yom kippur liable to pay tashlumin seems which accords with the opinion of the chachomim – he is not exempt because the greater punishment is karet (rashi).</p>\n\n<p>The rambam’s p’sak is that someone who does an aveirah b’shogeg for which he would be held to mitat beit din and tashlumin, does not pay, and an aveirah for which one receives malkot and tashlumin, the pealty is one or the other depending on the situation (hilchot geneiva 3:1, citing hilchot na’arah 1:13).  However (halacha 2), if one were to be liable for mita and then afterwards malkot (or vice versa), that is, that the two punishments are not incurred simultaneously, both must be levied (such as a geneivah on Shabbat which occurs in a private reshut and then later the ganav goes to another reshut and loses the chefetz, he must pay for the item and also be responsible for hotza’ah on Shabbat). This argument is brought down on ketuvot 31a where there is also a discussion of the many events which all contribute to one action and whether all the events become “simultaneous” because they all contribute to the one end result.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In essence, the idea is this:</p>\n\n<p>If a person does <em>one</em> act, and with that one act incurs two different kinds of penalties, we only apply the stricter one. So if a person (for example) borrows a cow and then slaughters it on Shabbos, he incurs two penalties: monetary restitution to the owner of the cow, and the death penalty for violating Shabbos. In this case, Beis Din only applies the stricter punishement, death, and the lesser one, the money, is waived.</p>\n\n<p>Again, there are other details and complexities, but this is the general idea.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>קים ליה בדרבה מיניה is used when someone commits two crimes at once. It is learned from the case in the beginning of Mishpatim which says that if two men fight each other and they hit a pregnant woman by accident, then if there is no fatality (i.e. death), the one who hit the woman will be fined. The Gemara makes a diyuk: If there is no fatality, he will be fined; but if there <em>is</em> a fatality, he won't be fined. This is because he is getting a greater punishment: Galus (for accidental murder).</p>\n\n<p>This is not comparable of another rule we have, \"kedei rish'aso,\" which teaches that we only lash someone for one rish'ah (wickedness) and not for two (Makos 4b), and therefore someone who is lashed doesn't also pay money. It is not comparable because kim leih bederabah mineih concerns money and \"kedei rish'aso\" concerns money and lashes, so we need both pesukim.</p>\n\n<p>Sources: Tosafos, Bava Kama 4a, d\"h kir'i; Maharam there</p>\n\n\n",

The first is by taking all the apples, leaving the oranges where they are. The second is by taking the oranges, leaving the apples where they are. And the third way is by moving both the apples and the oranges to different places, and this is the most complete and decisive separation.</p>\n\n<p>Here too, these five things that Hashem gave names to during the six days of creation were things which were originally mixed together under a certain name, and after they were completely and decisively separated Hashem gave them new names to show that their separation was to be forever, and that they would never go back to being a mixture.</p>\n\n<p>The first of these things were light and darkness, which operated in a mixture without any order, until Hashem separated them and gave each one its own spacial and temporal rules, and He then called the light 'day', and the darkness 'night'. Similarly, the whole world in the beginning was a mixture of water with water, but then Hashem separated the upper waters from the lower waters and called the firmament and the upper waters 'heaven'. But the lower waters still operated in a mixture with the earth, so Hashem made a second separation, gathering the lower waters into one place so that the dry land appeared, and He called the dry land 'earth' and the gathering of waters He called 'seas'.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a sixth thing that Hashem gave a name to during the creation, and that is the name He gave to the male and female together, as it says in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0105.htm#2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereishis 5,1</a> \"Male and female He created them and blessed them and called their name 'Adam', on the day when they were created\". Here however He made a change from the previous namings, because before they were separated they were also called 'Adam'. But in order that their separation would not be a total disassociation but rather they should be \"one flesh\", working together in the completion of their task in this world, He did not give them a new name but again called them 'Adam', continuing with the first name.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Samson Raphael Hirsch explaines the phrase “ויקרא ל…‏” not as “God named” but as “God assigned”.

    "content": "# Are there unforgiveable sins?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If parents have committed atrocious sins against their children such as incest, physical abuse, drugging, etc. is it considered an unforgiveable sin?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=5&perek=2&halocha=10\">Rambam</a> writes that it is considered cruel to repeatedly refuse to forgive someone who asks sincerely for forgiveness. Under normal circumstances if they ask once, twice and then a third time you must forgive them, or else you become the one in the wrong. They however do need to appease the wronged party and make amends as far as possible, such as returning stolen property, paying for damages or compensating monetarily for pain caused.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I cannot imagine putting a price on the damage caused by parental betrayal. If I recall correctly, compensation for <em>physical</em> pain is evaluated by asking how much money the victim would have accepted to bear that pain. It's not clear to me whether compensation for <em>emotional</em> pain is evaluated in the same manner, but what I imagine to be the crippling effect of the extreme scenarios above would surely not be covered by any amount of money. How could they make amends for what they have done?</p>\n\n<p>I don't think this means that the child is exempted from ever contemplating forgiving such parents. While the parents may never correct or be able to correct the wrongs they did, from my reading of pop psychology part of the healing process includes letting go of resentment for the perpetrators. I imagine that would be a milestone in a lifetime of extensive therapy, and also that there are degrees of forgiveness. It is not an all-or-nothing thing.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, it is not an unforgivable sin, but the child need not forgive the parents until he is ready.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I hope it is obvious that this question goes far beyond well-meant advice from the internet. The above is all my amateur opinion, and even if these principles are valid, their application to a particular case requires profound psychological wisdom more than Torah wisdom, as well as a full understanding of the circumstances and personalities involved.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Sort of. Rambam writes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=5&perek=4&halocha=3&hilite=\">Teshuvah 4:3</a>):</p>\n\n<p>To use <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911898/jewish/Chapter-Four.htm\">translation on chabad.org</a> (their additions in brackets, my one addition in {curly brackets}: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Among these [24 {sins which make repentance hard}] are five\n  [transgressions] for which it is impossible for the person who commits\n  them to repent completely. They are sins between man and man,\n  concerning which it is impossible to know the person whom one sinned\n  against in order to return [what is owed him] or ask for his\n  forgiveness. They are:</p>\n  \n  <p>a) One who curses the many without cursing a specific individual from\n  whom he can request forgiveness;</p>\n  \n  <p>b) One who takes a share of a thief's [gain], for he does not know to\n  whom the stolen article belongs. The thief steals from many, brings\n  him [his share], and he takes it. Furthermore, he reinforces the thief\n  and causes him to sin;</p>\n  \n  <p>c) One who finds a lost object and does not announce it [immediately]\n  in order to return it to its owners. Afterwards, when he desires to\n  repent, he will not know to whom to return the article;</p>\n  \n  <p>d) One who eats an ox belonging to the poor, orphans, or widows. These\n  are unfortunate people, who are not well-known or recognized by the\n  public. They wander from city to city and thus, there is no one who\n  can identify them and know to whom the ox belonged in order that it\n  may be returned to him.</p>\n  \n  <p>e) One who takes a bribe to pervert judgment. He does not know the\n  extent of the perversion or the power [of its implications] in order\n  to pay the [people whom he wronged], for his judgment had a basis.\n  Furthermore, [by taking a bribe], he reinforces the person [who gave\n  it] and causes him to sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I should, however, note what he says in 4:6 (same translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All of the above, and other similar transgressions, though they hold\n  back repentance, they do not prevent it entirely. Should one of these\n  people repent, he is a Baal-Teshuvah {someone who did repentance} and has a portion in the world to\n  come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To the best of my knowledge, there is no such thing as an unforgiveable sin. The 3 sins that are thought to be the \"worst\" are Murder, Idolatry, and Forbidden Relations. These are considered so severe that a Jew is commanded to let himself be killed rather than transgress them. (By contrast, every other sin can (and many times, must,) be violated to save one's own life, or the life of another.)\nBut there are innumerable stories of people who committed these sins and repented afterwards, and their repentance was accepted.</p>\n\n<p>However, be aware that repentance is not strictly a man-to-G-d act. When one has sinned and damaged someone else, their repentance necessitates <em>at least</em> attempting to gain the forgiveness of their victim. Sins as severe and reprehensible as the ones you mention are certainly among those for which a sinner must gain the forgiveness of their victim. </p>\n\n<p>However, even if their victim does <em>not</em> forgive them, it doesn't mean their predicament is hopeless.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now, while I have never heard of an unforgiveable sin, that doesn't mean that every sin can be atoned for in <em>this</em> world. In the times of the Sanhedrin, certain sins could only be atoned for by capital punishment. There are also stories of people doing sincere repentance and dying immediately thereafter. So it is possible that even today some sins can only be cleansed by death and (possibly) what follows thereafter.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>TL;DR.</p>\n\n<p>Any sin can be atoned for. Sometimes this necessitates death or even \"hell\". Repentance for sins that damage other people requires gaining the forgiveness of the victim.</p>\n\n<p><sub>\n(Sources: Numerous.

I am not going to copy it here because it is lengthy.  Essentially, his idea is that angels are given two things - their mission and their awareness.  Sometimes their mission is very specific and detailed, and sometimes it is given more vaguely.  If an angel is given a more general order, he may make a mistake in \"interpretation\" and mess up if the angel does not have the level of awareness to completely understand the command.  An example is the order for angels to say Shira, daily song.  If an angel precedes or delays in this, due to a lack of understanding of its own position (acc. to the gloss of R' Chaim Shmulevitz there) it ceases to exist.  Normally, when an angel makes a mistake, it ceases to exist, because the angel is nothing more than a manifestation of some Divine will and mission.  An angel has no free will in the way that we do - no moral decisions.  The angels make true and false decisions, not right and wrong decisions.</p>\n\n<p>However, sometimes there is an outside reason for the continued existence of the angel, in which case it continues to exist.  The Ramchal does not directly address why the angel is then punished, but it seems that it is understood as more of a result of its fulfillment of its mission.  If its existence is defined by its mission, to the degree that it misrepresents that mission there is a shortcoming in its existence, and the \"punishment\" is a reflection of that reality.</p>\n\n\n",

For a Jewish child, milah before the 8th day isn't a valid milah and hatafat dam brit would have to be done at the proper time. But a non-jewish child isn't commanded to get a milah so it would seem that there is no obligation to do so on the 8th day specifically. (By the way, this is not a duplicate of the comments in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12789/why-not-eight-days-until-a-converts-circumcision\">Why Not Eight Days Until a Convert's Circumcision?</a>) This site <a href=\"http://www.convert.org/Converting_Infants.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.convert.org/Converting_Infants.html</a> reads, regarding converting a newborn, \"If possible, this should be done on the 8th day after the birth of the boy. If a circumcision has already been performed, a drop of blood needs to be drawn in a ceremony called hatafat dam brit.\" but no source is given. Why would there be a requirement to wait till the eighth day? A Jewish baby lives through one shabbat (i.e. 7 day cycle) before a brit but the non-Jewish baby has no connection to shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>Is it that, objectively, there is something halachicaly about being alive 8 days for any human that then makes milah viable (I don't mean medically and I'm not sure if the kabbalistic notion of \"positive and negative energies\" <a href=\"http://www.nymohel.com/laws_customs.php#p16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.nymohel.com/laws_customs.php#p16</a> is an answer I, as a layman, can truly appreciate).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/ci/sam/48964686.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.aish.com/ci/sam/48964686.html</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Devarim Rabbah 6:1 states that God had pity on the child and instead\n  of requiring circumcision immediately after birth, waited until the\n  baby was stronger.

Other reasons\n  given are so that the baby is given time to \"mourn\" for the Torah that\n  it learned in utero and has now forgotten (Taz, Yoreh Deah265:13), and\n  that the parents are happier at eight days when \"tumas leidah\" no\n  longer applies (Nidda 31b). <strong>Interestingly, the baby's coagulation\n  factors appear to peak at the eighth day.</strong> See the essay entitled \"A\n  Tapestry of Eights\" in Bris Milah by Rabbi Paysach Krohn (Mesorah\n  Publications) for a detailed discussed of the significance of the\n  eighth day for circumcision.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(Shemos 17:7)</p>\n  \n  <p>But why did Moshe hit the rock instead of speaking to it in this parsha? R’ Sheps learns from here the incredible depth of\n  mesirus nefesh (giving one’s all) that Moshe had for his people. If he would speak to the rock and it would give water, it would be a terrible accusation\n  on Klal Yisroel. When you talk to a rock it listens to Hashem, but when you talk to Klal Yisroel they don’t listen? So he hit the\n  rock and jeopardized himself for the benefit of the people. Thus, בצדקו חון - in the merit of this righteous deed have favor,\n  חשרת מים - and give us an abundance of water! However, although Moshe’s intention was entirely pure and self effacing, he\n  was punished , because there is no place for one’s own calculations and reasoning in the face of Hashem’s command!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

One is through ahava (love), in which a person feels very close to Him, and the other is through yirah (awe), in which one is awestruck by His Omnipotence and Omniscience.  This may explain the ancient Jewish practice of “shokeling,” swaying forward and backward during teffilah.  The forward motion expresses one’s desire to come close to Hakodosh Baruch Hu, but then, upon reflection, one realizes that He is the Ribbono Shel Olam, the Master of the universe, which causes one to reel back in awe.  These thoughts are typically evoked during meditation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some sources are critical however, particularly of swaying during Sh'moneh Esrei.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Against Shukeling During the Amidah:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Baal_Shem_Tov\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Ba’al Shem Tov</strong></a>, quoted by Mekor Hesed, ibid. states that one may shukel – but not during Shmoneh Esrei.  “Teffilah (i.e. Shmoneh Esrei) is like being paired with the Divine Presence…therefore, one must shake himself at the beginning [of prayer].  After this (i.e. during Shmoneh Esrei) one is able to stand without movement.  [This is because] he will be connected with the Divine Presence with a great connection.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Yosef_David_Azulai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Perush Azulai</strong></a> on Sefer Hasidim, (ed. Margoliot 57). says one should not shukel during Sh'moneh Esrei.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומ\"ש וצריך לנענע כל גופו בשעת תפילה וכו' הרב המקובל מהר\"ר ישראל סרוק ותלמידו הרמ\"ע זכרם לברכה כתבו שאין לנענע גופו בתפלת י\"ח שהוא כעומד לפני המלך עכ\"ד .</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi and Kabbalist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Sarug\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Yisroel Saruk</strong></a> and his student <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menahem_Azariah_da_Fano\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rama</a>, may their memories be blessed, wrote that one should not shake his body during the recitation of Sh'moneh Esrei since it (Sh'moneh Esrei) is like standing before the King.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The most stringent source against shukeling during Sh'moneh Esrei is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Horowitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Shlah</strong></a> (quote found in Netiv Binah, vol. 1, pg. 96).  He emphatically states that not moving will give one more concentration.  He proves it by saying that nobody has ever gone to a king to ask for something while shaking – kal v’homer before Hashem.  “Standing without any movement at all [during Sh'moneh Esrei] will help one concentrate.  The verse that states kol atzmotai tomarnah (and is a source for shukeling) is only in reference to shirot, tishbahot, blessings on Shema, and during Torah learning – but not during Sh'moneh Esrei.  If somebody should challenge you and say that one should also sway during Sh'moneh Esrei, it would appear to me that such a person should be ignored.  Ones own experience will prove that standing without any movement at all during Sh'moneh Esrei will cause ones heart to concentrate.  One should check it out himself: would a person ever ask requests from a human king while his body is swaying like the trees in the forest due to the wind?!”</p>\n\n<p>However, many sources support swaying during prayer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For Swaying During Prayer</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sefer Hasidim</strong>, (57) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וצריך לנענע כל גופו בשעת התפלה דכתיב כל עצמותי תאמרנה ה' מי כמוך (תהלים ל\"ה י') </p>\n  \n  <p>A person needs to shake his entire body during teffilah since the verse says \"All my bones shall say God who is like you (Psalms 35:10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rivash</strong>, quoted by Mekor Hesed on Sefer Hasidim, ibid. gives a parable that when one is drowning and jumping around in the water, people won’t make fun of him.  So too, when one is davening and shaking himself, he is attempting to remove distractions.  “When a man is drowning in a river and making many movements to remove himself from the water, surely those that are watching him will not laugh at him and his [strange] movements; so too, when one prays (k’she’mitpallel) and makes many [strange] movements, one should not laugh at him.”  This source seems to endorse animated  shukeling.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shibolei HaLeket</strong>, (17) cites <strong>Ma’aseh Merkava</strong> as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצאתי במעשה המרכבה ובשעת התפלה צריך אדם לנענע כל גופו שנא' כל עצמותי תאמרנה ה' מי כמוך. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I found in <em>Ma'aseh Merkava</em>: during prayer, a person needs to shake his entire body since the verse says \"All my bones shall say God who is like you (Psalms 35:10).</p>\n\n<p>What do recent sources say?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recent Sources:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Arukh Hashulhan</strong> (OH 48:3), and <strong>Mishnah Berurah</strong> (48:5), come to the same conclusion – one may do whatever is desired.  Whatever allows one to concentrate better is the proper thing to do.</p>\n\n<p>Arukh Hashulhan:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובתפלת שמ\"ע יש מתנועעים ויש שאינם מתנועעים ותלוי לפי טבעו דאם בהתנועע הכונה יותר טוב אצלו נכון להתנועע ויש אדם שכונתו יותר ברורה כשעומד בשוה לגמרי לא יתנועע והכל לשם שמים: </p>\n  \n  <p>During Shemoneh Esrei, some sway and some do not.  This is contingent on one’s nature.  If one finds that they will concentrate better while shukeling then it is proper for that person to shukel.  There are those individuals that will have a clearer ability to concentrate while standing completely still – they should not shukel.  It is all proper as long as it is done for the Sake of Heaven.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mishnah Berurah</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש פוסקים שחולקין ע\"ז ואומרים דבתפלה אין להתנענע...וכתב המ\"א ודעביד כמר עביד ודעביד כמר עביד. והכל לפי מה שהוא אדם אם מכוין היטב ע\"י תנועה יתנענע וא\"ל יעמוד כך ובלבד שיכוין לבו</p>\n  \n  <p>There are those poskim that argue and say that during teffilah one should not shukel... Magen Avraham writes that one may choose either method.  It is all according to the individual – if one concentrates better by shukeling, let him shukel, and if not, let him stand [still] – as long as his heart is able to concentrate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rabbi Dr. Joseph Breuer</strong> zt”l, points out that it was a hallmark of German Jewry – and others – that they did not shukel during teffilah. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The same holds true for our posture during the Teffilah.  The Halacha is silent on the preference of a stationary versus a moving position in regard to the intensity of kavonoh during the Teffilah.  The sainted Ari Ha-kadosh, and with him many of our Torah Greats, assumed stationary positions during the Teffilah – and they were certainly not German Jews. (Our Way, (A Unique Perspective, pg. 384) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Against Swaying During Torah Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>Regarding swaying during study, to paraphrase <a href=\"http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2011/06/why-do-jews-sway-when-they-pray-some.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">On the Mainline</a>:</p>\n\n<p>The first source is critical...The first source is a poem of <strong>Shemuel Ha-naggid</strong>. In this poem he is criticizing the degeneration of Torah study...As an example of their lack of orderliness he mentions their shokeling:</p>\n\n<p>והנה רב ותלמידים מנידים לראשיהם כערער בערבה</p>\n\n<p>The teacher and students were bobbing their head like a tamarisk in the wilderness.\"</p>\n\n<p>This then is the first incidental mention of shokeling, at least in Jewish sources.</p>\n\n<p>Other sources, however, support the practice of swaying during learning:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For Swaying During Torah Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Kuzari</strong>, writes (Hartwig Hirschfeld's translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"79\">\n  <li><p>Al-Khazari: I should like to ask whether thou knowest the reason why Jews move to and fro when reading the Bible?</p></li>\n  <li><p>The Rabbi: It is said that it is done in order to arouse natural heat. My personal belief is that it stands in connection with the subject under discussion. As it often happened that many persons read at the same time, it was possible that ten or more read from one volume. This is the reason why our books are so large. Each of them was obliged to bend down in his turn in order to read a passage, and to turn back again. This resulted in a continual bending and sitting up, the book lying on the ground. This was one reason. Then it became a habit through constant seeing, observing and imitating, which is in man's nature.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Yehuda Ha-levi gives two reasons. The first is one which people say, that it is to arouse heat in the body, I guess like a form of exercise. Alternatively, he means to arouse passion, to get into it. Then there is the reason preferred by the author, which is his suspicion that originally it was because people shared books and they moved in and our of the way so they could read and give others a chance to read and ultimately this became the habit and spread.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Zohar</strong> (Parashat Pinhas) also discusses shokeling in the context of study:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We arose and went on our way, the sun becoming stronger and more oppressive. We saw some trees in the wilderness with water underneath, and we sat down in the shade of one of them. I asked him: How is it that of all peoples of the world, only the Jews sway to and fro when they study the Torah, a habit which seems to come natural to them, and they are unable to keep still? He replied: You have reminded me of a very deep idea which very few people know. He pondered for a moment and wept. Then he continued: Alas for mankind who go about like cattle without understanding. This thing alone is sufficient to distinguish the holy souls of Israel from the souls of heathen peoples. The souls of Israel have been hewn from the Holy Lamp, as is written, “The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord” (Prov. xx, 27). Now once this lamp has been kindled from the supernal Torah, the light upon it never ceases for an instant, like the flame of a wick which is never still for an instant. So when an Israelite has said one word of the Torah, a light is kindled and he cannot keep still but sways to and fro like the flame of a wick. But the souls of heathens are like the burning of stubble, which gives no flame, and therefore they keep still like wood burning without a flame.’ Said R. Jose: ‘That is a good explanation; happy am I to have heard this.’ (Soncino translation.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To paraphrase <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/halacha-on-ou/swaying-prayer-torah-study/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the OU</a>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ba’al ha-turim</strong>, (Ex. 20:15), on the verse, “the people saw and trembled” comments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>על כן מתנענעים בשעת לימוד התורה לפי שהתורה ניתנה באימה ברתת ובזיע </p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore we sway during Torah learning, since the Torah was given with fear, terror, and shaking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Darkhei Moshe</strong>, commenting on Tur, Hilchot Birkhat ha-Shahar 48:1, cites <strong>Abudirham</strong>, “…the custom of Israel is to shake while they read (b’sha’a shekorin) just like when the Torah was given, it was given with terror…”  The phrase b’sha’a shekorin refers to the time the Torah is being read in the synagogue.  Rama, Shulhan Aruck ad loc. comments, “…the custom of those that are careful is to sway while the Torah is being read, comparable to the Torah that was given with terror.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mishnah Berurah</strong> (48:5) also mentions swaying during study: \"and during Torah Learning, even of the Oral Law, the custom is to shukel.\" </p>\n\n\n",

Such a society can breed mutual respect in that each person recognizes that the other has a necessary role that I cannot fill - that I <em>need</em> the other. It also imbues special meaning in to a whole lot of actions which would have much less meaning otherwise. The Kohen feels special that he's the one delegated to perform the service, and the Israelite feels special that he is the one who has time and is therefore responsible for the upkeep of the land; and so on and so forth.

(What exactly is defined as 'in his place' is a separate discussion.) The Shulchan Aruch YD 242:9 rules like the Ri as quoted in Haghot Maimoniot 5:3 in Hilchot Talmud Torah that: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל הכתוב בספרים מפסקי הגאונים יכול להורות בימי רבו, רק לא יורה דבר מלבו ולא יסמוך  על ראיותיו לדמות מילתא למילתא מעצמו.‏<br>\n  any ruling found in the written works of the Geonim [which for the Ri was the previous few hundred years] can be ruled in [front of] his Rabbi, only that he shouldn't rule something from his own [opinion], and he shouldn't rely on his own proofs to compare one case to another on his own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus it seems that if something is written straight up in an acceptable text, then following it is not considered passing a halachik legal ruling. Moreover it seems that a ruling, fundamentally, is taking known rules and applying them into new cases that haven't previously been dealt with. Our sifrei halacha are significantly more detailed than \"Geonic\" works and many of the cases that one looks up are explicitly dealt with, so by using one perhaps one can argue that it is not a case that requires a new ruling.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, I caution that this ruling is specifically regarding someone who otherwise has an idea what's going on and is just being worried about ruling in front of his Rabbi. As we all know, there are many different opinions in lots of written materials, especially nowadays. So unless you have learned the whole sugya and have some idea which opinions are and are not normative in your tradition, I would still strongly encourage you to speak to your Rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>The phenomenon you may be referring to would seem to be in a case where that is not practical. If you are indeed stuck somehow with only some book, then choosing which book you will use is likely based on what you have seen your Rabbi use in the past, or at least heard that other Rabbis have used in the past. So in a way you are using a received tradition regarding how to choose, which is most of what psak is anyway. This, I imagine, is why people in a pinch rely on Sefer X: they have learned that it's a good bet.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>And of course, CYLOR before believing anything I just wrote :)</p>\n\n\n",

The following mishna, however, states that eighteen enactments were made on the day that representatives of the school of Shammai outnumbered the representatives of the school of Hillel, and the gemara interprets this particular ruling from Shabbat 1:3 as being amongst those eighteen.</p>\n\n<p>Am I to understand, therefore, that the school of Hillel previously permitted delousing on Shabbat? It strikes me that such an activity would be a toldah of <em>borer</em> or <em>gozez</em>, or even <em>hatzad tzvi</em>. I presume that I must be misreading something, but am not sure what.

In a discussion that concerns whether or not lice spontaneously generate, Rabbi Eliezer's opinion is brought to the effect that one who kills a louse on Shabbat is as liable as had he killed a camel. Rabbi Yehoshua disagrees, saying that one is permitted to kill a louse on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>I know that the whole question of whether Rabbi Eliezer is of the school of Shammai or Hillel is a complicated one, though he does always seem to hold the views of the former. Rabbi Yehoshua, of course, is of the school of Hillel. Their disagreement here may shed light on the difference of opinion between the disciples of Hillel and Shammai in Shabbat 1:3 as well - though I note that some mefarshim (like the Rambam) hold contrary to the view that this was one of the eighteen things they enacted anyway.</p>\n\n\n",

He and others who live in towns that no longer have a Jewish presence have done their best to clean up and maintain the vandalized and abandoned cemeteries, sometimes fixing the surrounding fences, and so forth.  They feel a certain responsibility to honor those who were martyred from their town, by caring for the ancestors of those people, and they do this with great respect and care.  (I even have photos of their clean-up efforts.)</p>\n<p>Recently these people in Slovakia were seeking funds to help with the clean-up and possibly raising fallen stones to set them upright and maintenance after the clean-up. It's hard work and needs more hands to accomplish this. In some rare cases they have even rebuilt or poured cement around a grave, so that the gravestone can be reset, at the request and payment of a descendant of that person.</p>\n<p>Now I have been told that it is improper for non-Jews to be doing this. That it might need at least a Jewish mashgiach (supervisor) to ensure all is done appropriately.  With about 700 Jewish cemeteries in Slovakia alone, it would seem to be an impossible job to be done by bringing teams of Jews to do the work. (Where would they stay?  For how long in each place? etc.)</p>\n<p><strong>Can anyone provide any information to support the idea -- or not -- that if all is done in a respectful manner, that non-Jews are permitted to do this in places where there are no Jews?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I don't see why there would be a problem with non-Jews tending to Jewish graves if, as it says in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40432&st=&pgnum=193\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim Siman 526</a> (especially Se'if 4), non-Jews do the burying of Jews on Yom Tov.</p>\n\n\n",

Of course it is clearly a case where a posek should be consulted to judge how significant the assembly is. </p>\n\n<p>(Furthermore, even if the act wasn't significant enough to negate the need for immersion of the French press, it is probable that the shoulder nut alone does not have a status of a utensil until it has been added to the French press, which we have noted is done by a Jew in our case so no <em>tevillah</em> is required because they are the one who \"made\" it).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-containers-tevilas.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-containers-tevilas.htm</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A possible suggestion would be to disassemble the vessel and have a\n  Jew reassemble the vessel.

However, I want to say that this interpretation does not preclude a case when not directly responding to a question. In other words, the Mishna is saying that anytime addressing a list of issues, one should address the first one first, and the last one last.

(<strong>Na'aseh</strong>, we will fulfill the positive commandments; <strong>V'Nishma</strong>, we will not transgress the negative commandments)</p>\n\n<p>The Iyun Yaakov says (in his second answer) that the disagreement about which order they were informed about the reward and punishment is based on a disagreement of which path to follow.

The gemara in <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_119.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 119b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was taught, R. Jose son of R. Judah said: Two ministering angels accompany man on the eve of the Sabbath from the synagogue to his home, one a good [angel] and one an evil [one]. And when he arrives home and finds the lamp burning, the table laid and the couch [bed] covered with a spread, the good angel exclaims, 'May it be even thus on another Sabbath [too],' and the evil angel unwillingly responds 'amen'. But if not, the evil angel exclaims, 'May it be even thus on another Sabbath [too],' and the good angel unwillingly responds, 'amen'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>discusses special angels triggered by this specific event. This does not necessarily have anything to do with one's level of holiness.</p>\n<h1>2</h1>\n<p>Even if we adopt the Mishnah Brurah's explanation of this minhag (not to say the bathroom request) as Rav Yosef's Karo's reason, we should realize that Rav Yosef Karo predated the creation of the <em>piyut</em> of Shalom Aleichem. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Ephraim_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yosef Karo</a> lived from 1488 – 1575, while <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%9D_%28%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%95%D7%98%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shalom Aleichem</a> was authored in the 17th century. So, perhaps Rav Yosef Karo would have agreed that one should not sing Shalom Aleichem.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Luria\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arizal</a> ((1534<a href=\"http://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_119.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> – July 25, 1572) <strong>was</strong> in favor of stating the bathroom angel address. (See Shaarei Teshuva on the same page as that Mishna Brura.) And this is a matter of minhag, rather than pure halacha. Or, saying a specific address when entering the bathroom seems more like halachah, while which <em>piyutim</em> to sing on Friday night enters the realm of minhag. Who is to say that something as <strong>organic</strong> as minhagim needs to be systematically consistent.</p>\n<h1>3</h1>\n<p>I sing Shalom Aleichem on Friday night, but I don't believe that the aforementioned gemara refers to actual, winged angels. Rather, the gemara clearly carries a metaphorical message, about gaining momentum in maintaining order / disorder, in preparing for Shabbos. Not only does mitzvah goreres mitzvah, but as one succeeds in making a pleasant and orderly Shabbos one week, he has the momentum to carry that same process forward to further weeks.</p>\n<p>And singing the <em>piyut</em> is a way of reminding ourselves of the gemara and its message, rather than a means of speaking to (and blessing) actual angels.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Dayan Raskin, in his notes on the Chabad Siddur (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30450&pgnum=301\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">page 272, note 97</a>), brings a Reshima of the Rebbe Rashab, 5th Lubavitcher Rebbe. In this note, the Rebbe Rashab points out that the Arizal says one should say \"התכבדו מכובדים\" before entering the bathroom, since this will help prevent him from thinking Torah thoughts in the bathroom. He then points out that the Shulchan Aruch HaRav says not to say it, and says \"It is possible that Shabbat is different\". </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, it appears that the Chatam Sofer did not say Shalom Aleichem for this reason. (I haven't found the actual text, but I have seen other places quote the \"Minhagei Chatam Sofer\" to this effect. For example, see page 6 of <a href=\"http://www.webshas.org/torczyner.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this pdf</a>.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some thoughts of my own:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The angels of friday night do not shadow us everywhere we go. They accompany us from when we leave the synagogue until we return home (See the Talmud Shabbat 119B quoted in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/17487/603\">@joshwaxman's answer</a>). In other words, even if we went to the bathroom, the angels would not follow us there.</p></li>\n<li><p>Furthermore, apparently based on this Gemara, the Arizal said that when one returns home one should say \"Shabbat Shalom\". This, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30450&pgnum=301\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dayan Raskin</a> points out, appears to be the source of the instructional language before \"Shalom Aleichem\" used in the Chabad Siddur - \"K'Sheyavo L'Beito Yomar Zeh\", \"When one comes home one should say this\".</p>\n\n<p>I would interpret this to say: Shalom Aleichem is not, as most people assume, a prelude to Kiddush. Rather, one should say it as soon as he gets home, since that is when the angels pronounce judgment (even if one was going to wait a little before making Kiddush)</p></li>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&pgnum=11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaarei Teshuva (3:1:1)</a>, brings opinions that we say \"התכבדו מכובדים\" even now, and quotes the Maharam Papr\"sh (?) that it is a Chiddush of the Arizal to say it even now. The Shaarei Teshuva offers that perhaps this only applies to people who constantly learn Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, it like to offer a Chiddush. The Arizal is not referring to the same angels that the Talmud (Berachot 60B) is referring to. The Talmud is talking about Angels that would constantly ,accompany a person of certain spiritual stature. Those are the angels that the Beit Yosef is referring to when he says we are no longer on that level.</p>\n\n<p>The Arizal on the other hand, is referring to the angels created when we learn Torah (here's <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7980/jewish/Essay-3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an essay</a> from the Baal HaTanya that discusses angels created by learning Torah and doing Mitzvot). The Arizal is saying that before one enter the bathroom, one should ask his Torah to stay outside, so that he won't think Torah thoughts in the Bathroom. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/751335/Rabbi_Aryeh_Lebowitz/Ten_Minute_Halacha_-_Hello,_Bless_Me_and_Goodbye_%28Shalom_Aleichem_on_Friday_Night%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">per this shuir</a> Rav Kook says that the reason we no longer say התכבדו מכובדים משרתי עליון is because we no longer wear tefillin all day. However since Shabbos comes in place of tefillin it is appropriate to sing shalom aleichem </p>\n\n\n",

And we find that when it was the day of the war, they would\n  fast, because our rabbis z\"l said that Moshe Rabeinu a\"h — on the day\n  that he fought with Amalek — was fasting. And if so, certainly in the\n  days of Mordechai they fasted on that day! And therefore, all of\n  Israel had the minhag to fast on the thirteenth of Adar, and it is\n  called Taanis Ester, in order to remember that Hashem y' watches and\n  listens to every man at the time of his need, when he fasts and\n  returns to Hashem with all of his heart, like they did in those days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We can take a few messages from this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Jews were gathered on the thirteenth of Adar.

How could the Mishna say this?\"  They then comment that \"Obviously, they mean if the tzizit are torn or ripped, it doesn't invalidate your tzizit as long as a \"tuft\" of the blue is remaining, or vice versa.

He argues that in fact the halacha follows Rebbe and not R Yochanan ben Nuri (RYBN) that tzitzit require both blue and white to be kosher. He makes 3 arguments to this end:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>RYBN is a lone opinion and the general rule is that the halacha follows Rebbe against lone opponents but not groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The gemara spends a large amount of time trying to fit the mishna into his opinion, thus indicating that his view is normative.

This is similar, he says, to the Gemara's attempts on Gittin 4 to establish a certain Mishna like R Meir only because it expects the unattributed Mishna to be in accordance with his opinion, not because it is normative.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>He notes the custom which he claims dates back beyond the Geonim to wear only white strings when necessary.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>He notes in addition the gemara's assertion in the view of R Nachman (Menachot 39b) that a silk garment can have \"either wool [tzitzit] or linnen [tzitzit]\" which implies that it is possible to have tzitzit without and wool ie without any techelet.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Independently, Tosfot (sort of) asks your question on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=38b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 38b</a> sv \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.38b.9?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Menachot.38b.9.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אלא</a>\".

But I'd point out that your initial claim about the gemara is just wrong. It says nothing like, 'essentially a \"Are you crazy? How could the Mishna say this?\" They then comment that \"Obviously...' Don't mean to criticize, but this is just a misreading. None of this is there at all.<br />\nThe gemara actually says, \"Shall we say that the mishnah [which said that white and techeles don't need one another] differs from the opinion of Rebbi [who holds that they do]?\" Then the gemara has a long discussion that finds a way to fit Rebbi's opinion in with the mishnah.<br />\nThat does not prove that we must therefore hold like Rebbi - we can still hold like the tanna who disagreed with him and who had a simpler reading of the mishnah. And in fact the major poskim down to the Tur and Shulchan Aruch and all authorities after them AFAIK stick with the simple reading of the mishnah: the white threads do not need the techeiles threads.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is braiding hair \"building\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The gemarah in niddah (45) says that when the torah says that God \"built\" Eve out of the bone of Adam what actually happened is that God braided Eve's hair and presented her to Adam as a wife. This is learned out from the word \"build\". But it seems to subvert the simple meaning of the verse. Furthermore we canonize this as law; one may not braid hair on the sabbath because it violates the work-category of \"building\". </p>\n\n<p>Why is braiding hair building?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In an article on OU.org, Rabbi Asher Meir <a href=\"http://www.ou.org/shabbat_shalom/article/mm_braiding/606\" rel=\"nofollow\">brings two answers from HaRav Kook</a> (Ein Ayah Shabbat 94b). One of them is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One thing we learn from here is that the esthetic aspect of building is not something extraneous but is an inherent aspect of building. The emotional inspiration provided by a beautiful building is no less important than the shelter it provides, and arranging for this is also part of the melacha</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.ravkooktorah.org/BREISH62.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for an more fleshed out write up of this idea from HaRav Kook.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Firstly, one may not braid hair on Shabbat regardless of how one categorises it. In the Mishna, Shabbat 10:6, braiding hair is forbidden by all authorities, the only difference being whether it is forbidden <i>MiDe'Orayta</i> or whether it is forbidden <i>MiDeRabbanan</i>. Rabbi Eliezer holds that it is forbidden <i>MiDe'Orayta</i>, and the gemara's interpretation is that this is because it falls under the category of \"building\". The chachamim disagree, but still forbid it because of <i>shevut</i>.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, there are innumerable instances in which the simple meaning of a verse is \"subverted\" in order to establish the halakha. There are principles, however, by which this is done. These principles, while they might not align with current systems of logic that you are familiar with, are nonetheless rigorous and (somewhat) consistent. They are known as <i>middot</i>, and if you take a little time to familiarise yourself with the principles of midrashic exegesis, you might be less surprised to see things like this.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the Mishna in Hagigah 1:8 acknowledges this problem when it declares that the laws of Shabbat \"are like mountains suspended on a hair, for there's [only] a little bit of scripture, but a great many halakhot.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You have multiple individual parts, and you combine them together to form a single thing.  However it's not tied together with a knot, so it's not tying.  Furthermore most braids are made to last, and are not temporary combining of things.  So it's building.</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=105&format=pdf\">Chullin 105a</a>) says that one must wait from one meal to the next. There is a disagreement among the Rishonim if that actually means from one meal to the next, or if it means the amount of time between the morning and evening meals, which would mean approximately six hours. See YD 89. The reason for the wait according to these Rishonim is either that fat/grease from the meat that is in one's throat emits a meat flavor into one's mouth for a long time (Rashi) or that for that amount of time we are concerned that small pieces of meat might be stuck between one's teeth (Rambam). Neither of these reasons say that these issues last exactly six hours, but rather that the Sages drew a line at six hours, and neither of them have to do with digestion per se.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>For Ashkenazim at least, the <strong>halacha</strong> is like Tosafot, that once one finishes the meat meal, if he starts a new meal he may consume dairy.

For this reason, a lefty should step with his right foot, since his left is everyone's right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(This could be taken to mean that at the beginning of Shemoneh Esrei, you start with your right. Tzarich Iyun.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Concerning the three steps at the end of Shmoneh Esrei, there are three opinions mentioned in the Shaarei Aharon on shulchan Aruch.</p>\n\n<p>1) The Orchos Chaim (#24) says to move the right foot back first a small step. Then with the left, a large step. Afterwards, with the right a small step to make it parallel to the left.</p>\n\n<p>2) The Shulchan Aruch says to start with the left, the size of these steps should be at least large enough to place the thumb toe next to the heel, the simple reading implies that one should start with the left, then move the right so the right toe is next to the left heel, and afterwards move the left again make it even with the right. This is what the Levush writes and ends off by saying this is the humble way to do it. As brought in Machatzis Hashekel.</p>\n\n<p>3) The Chazzon Ish says to take three large steps and afterwards to make them equal with each other. He seems to explain the Shulchan Aruch this way.</p>\n\n<p>Untill here is from the Shaarei Aharon.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the half steps you mention, I remember reading about this but I don't recall where. Apparently this is the minhag of many Hasidic Rebbes. The explenation I saw was based on the Beis Yoseif who says one takes three steps backwards, then after the three steps forwards, he can go on his way, after a completion of six steps. Taking this idea of six steps and adding it with the idea that making your feet parallel counts as a full step even though only a half step was taken would mean that splitting the three steps backwards into six half steps is actually counted as six steps and one may now go on his way without going forward. \nThis would avoid the confusion of what one should do after taking three steps back and now needs to go somewhere, say the bathroom. What should he do? Go now and take three steps forward when he gets back, or take three steps forward now? For instance, the Kaf HaChaim held like the first option, Rabbi Reuvein Margolis in his Nefesh Chaya held like the latter. \nThe practice of these Rebbes should avoid this issue, according to the seffer that I can't recall the name of.</p>\n\n<p>The Igros Moshe Orach Chaim chelek 4 siman 122 #2 also discusses the three steps according to the Gra and what the majority of people do, and mentions that being that the personal practice of the Gra was not mentioned in his siddur or Maaseh Rav, 'this implies there is no preference how one steps'.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the steps before Shmoneh Esrei, there seems to be confusion involved, as there is no reason to take steps backwards. There is an opinion brought in the Ramma in the name of the Rokeach in siman 95 to go three steps forwards, as a means of 'coming close and hagasha (a word associated with many people praying in the Torah) to fulfill your duty'. The Mishna Berurah there says explicitly one need not go backwards in order to do this act, but the minhag of the world is in fact to go back. </p>\n\n<p>The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch mentions to go back three steps when you say Tehilos l'Kel elyon etc. Apparently, he feels in this way a person is considered being back there and is now actually moving to a new place. Perhaps even he agrees that going back right before Shmoneh Esrei is not a good option. </p>\n\n<p>Noone I saw describes these three steps. One can imagine they would be the same, but care was taken to describe a practice mentioned from the gemara, that is going back afterwards, whereas an idea from the rishonim, to go forward is not as worthy to go into such details. Especially if the Levush doesn't mention it and some take that as meaning he doesn't agree with it. Also, the logic about the six little steps from the unnamed seffer would not apply, as here, there is no idea of six steps, only three. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Blackout restoration on Shabbath - and your food\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If you suffer from a blackout on Shabbath, but the power returns on Shabbath, and you have certain food elements cooking, is there a problem of either Nolad or some other issue relating to food that was entirely or mostly cooked on Shabbath after the power was restored?  What about water in an urn - would that be considered different from, say, Cholent, because we hold Yesh Bishul Ahar Bishul for water?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Being that no action is done, the question here is not a question of whether one would be transgressing a prohibition, but rather whether one would be permitted to derive benefit from the items which were affected by an apparent violation (הנאה).</p>\n\n<p>In a broad sense, the halachot of deriving benefit from a transgression are fairly clear (see Shulchan Aruch 276 and Mishneh Torah Shabbos 6:2), if a gentile performs an action which violates Shabbos solely for the benefit of a Jew it is forbidden to derive benefit from the the results of his action until after Shabbos. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For example, if a well-meaning gentile were to turn on a light in a room so that a Jew could read in that, previously dark, room, and the gentile receives no benefit from this action, the Jew would not be permitted to use the light.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If, however, the gentile performed an action for himself or another gentile which violates Shabbos, the results of his action are permitted.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For example, if a gentile boils a pot of water for himself and a group of gentile friends and when they are done there is left over hot water, a Jew may use this hot water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, in our case (in which the power goes out on or before Shabbos and is subsequently restored during the course of Shabbos), provided that the majority of people for whom the power company is restoring power are gentiles and the majority of people who work for the power company on Shabbos are gentiles (like in most parts of America), there should be no issue with deriving benefit from food which was heated or cooked on Shabbos even if it was completely raw or cold prior to the return of power (provided that the heating element is properly covered so that a Jew would not be tempted to adjust it - pursuant to the Rabbinic restriction of grufa ve'katuma for shehiya and chazara). In a situation where the majority of people involved are Jewish (like in Israel) there may issues.</p>\n\n<p>The crucial point to note here is that there is no difference between benefiting from a light bulb which was turned on with the return of power and benefiting from food which was heated or cooked - if one would not derive benefit from the food, one should also leaves one's home so as not to benefit from the air conditioning, light, fans, etc. In this case, no gentile was asked to perform an action which would be a Shabbos violation and the action was not done specifically for a Jew, therefore there is no restriction on benefit.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this answer helped clarify some of the complex issues involved with the situations you raised. It is not meant as a practical halachic answer, you should seek out a local competent Halachic authority for this purpose.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Reb Moshe Feinstein (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&st=&pgnum=142\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.C. 4 Siman 74 Dinei Bishul 38</a>) and Reb Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Shmiras Shabbos Kehilchasa 1:69) say that returning to a different blech is Muttar (not in a case of powercut). The Orchos Shabbos 2:50 says that the same Din applies to a powercut. His proof is from the Chazon Ish 38:2 that says a person is allowed to place a fully cooked pot on a blech that will switch on on Shabbos. He brings from there that there is no Issur when a powercut occurs! </p>\n\n<p>The reasoning they say is that one is allowed to cook foods on Shabbos provided that he do it in a way that he started the cooking on Erev Shabbos and is Garuf VeKatum. I assume your case is indeed the latter because if not it is Ossur even without a powercut. The issue that would therefore apply is has you previous cooking disappeared and is it considered a new cooking on Shabbos? To this they explain seeing as if you would have another hot plate to move it on to you do not want the Hefsek and it is considered a continuation and consequently Muttar. (They bring the similar to the case of the Mishnah Brurah 25:14 by Tefilling that slipped is not a Hefsek)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: In response to DoubleAA about Nolad (although the Orchos Shabbos still is matir regardless):</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion the reason why nolad does not apply even if there is Nolad on a dovor Sheino Be'ein is because you did nothing wrong. Even if there is an issur of Nolad that is only to go and use the Nolad but you are being Shev VeAl Taaseh. The only Issurim on Shabbos that I can think of off-hand is Shehiyah and perhaps Chazarah and Hatmanah where the Chazon Ish holds even if a Monkey put it on you gotta take it of. (Note there may be a problem of Muktze!) But by Nolad Chazal never made this specific type of Gezera that even when you dont do an action you must still stop the action from happening. So there is no Issur in leaving it on the hob, the food definitely is not Nolad, it was always there so what can possibly be Nolad.</p>\n\n\n",

Ashi raised the question: How is it if [the curtailed threads] are so thick that one cannot make a loop with them, although had they been thinner one could have made a loop with them? — R. Aha the son of Raba answered R. Ashi, They are most certainly [valid], since the precept is all the more noticeable thereby</p>\n<p><em>Who is the Tanna that disagrees with Rabbi?  It is the Tanna of the following Baraitha. For it was taught: R. Isaac says in the name of R. Nathan who said it in the name of R. Jose the Galilean and who in turn said it in the name of R.

The gemara prior to your quote had been discussing the opinion of Rebbe. In that discussion it mentioned the rule of 'curtailed threads' as a possible understanding of Rebbe's understanding of the Mishna. It then returns to its primary topic: Rebbe's opinion. When it's done, it reanalyzes something that had come up as a side point earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps if the word גופא had been inserted before your final paragraph the flow would have been clearer.</p>\n\n\n",

This means that, unlike various other festivals, Jews and Samaritans \"celebrate\" the Shemittah year at the same time, and celebrated the Yovel year at the same time too (when this was something that Jews actually celebrated). Unfortunately, I don't have anything to add about the means by which they do this, though it wouldn't be hard to figure out <i>some</i> differences. Many of the laws that pertain to the rabbinic observance of these festivals are marked deviations from the literal interpretation of scripture. They can be found for the most part in Tractate Shevi'it of the Mishna, and range from the rabbinic (interpretation of and) ban against eating that which grows naturally from the ground (ספיח) to Hillel the Elder's <i>prozbul</i>.</p>\n\n<p>The very little that I am able to share about Samaritan practices during this time, I learnt from the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ferdinand Dexinger \"Samaritan and Jewish Festivals: Comparative Considerations\", in <i>Essays in Honour of G.D.

Davey; Sydney: Mandelbaum Publishing), 57-78).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On p.74, he produces Samaritan texts from the 16th and 18th centuries to testify to their using the seventh month, like Jews do, instead of the first.</p>\n\n\n",

As is common in Jewish law, there are a number of different opinions about certain details regarding which doorways are obligated, so if you only have one mezuzah available, I would recommend choosing a doorway with the additional features of having a left doorpost, having a door attached and opening to a room of 64 square feet that is no less than 6 (or ideally 8) feet in either dimension.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about which doorways require a mezuzah <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/archives/1758\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.

Tosefet Shabbat only ends when saying Atta Chonantanu, Havdala or Baruch Hamavdil Bein Kodesh Lechol. The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=27b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berachot 27b</a>) even says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבי יאשיה מצלי של מוצאי שבת בשבת.‏<br>\n  Rabbi Josiah prayed Saturday night['s maariv] on Shabbat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the Chazzan is putting on the Tallit for use on Shabbat and is thus not a problem of preparing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In the Mishna (Shabbat 23:3), a <i>machloket</i> is presented between Abba Shaul and the <i>tana qama</i>. The Mishna states that it is forbidden to wander out to the Shabbat boundary during the day in order to hire workers or tend to your vineyards the moment that it gets dark. Abba Shaul, however, permits wandering out during the day if it is in preparation for something that you would be allowed to speak about on Shabbat: כל שאני זכאי באמירתו, רשאי אני להחשיך עליו (\"Anything that I might merit to speak about, I am permitted to prepare for\" - lit. 'for it to get dark on me about').</p>\n<p>The following mishna (23:4) provides two examples of this: tending to the needs of a bride and burying the dead, while Shabbat 24:5 further permits making measurements, in order to determine whether objects are large enough to convey (or dispel) impurity, and whether or not a <i>miqveh</i> might be of the requisite size.</p>\n<p>In the gemara (Shabbat 150a), Abba Shaul's statement is taken as halakha, and is interpreted to mean that you are allowed to prepare anything on Shabbat that is for the sake of a <i>mitzvah</i> - so long, of course, as the act of preparation neither involves <i>melakha</i> nor dealing with objects that are <i>muqtzeh</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר קרא ממצוא חפצך ודבר דבר חפציך אסורים חפצי שמים מותרין</p>\n<p>The verse says: \"[If you refrain from...] pursuing your own affairs and speaking\nwords\" (Isaiah 58:13): your own affairs are forbidden; affairs of\nheaven are permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam sums all of this up in <i>Hilkhot Shabbat</i> 24:5, in which he says that it is permitted to prepare for the <i>mitzvot</i> that you will observe as soon as it gets dark. His two examples, as per the mishna, are tending to the needs of brides and of the dead. So too the Shulchan Arukh (Orach Chaim 306:6-7), which also permits preparing for <i>mitzvot</i> that will be performed after Shabbat, and even making the necessary measurements.</p>\n<p>None of these sources speak directly about <i>ma'ariv</i>, and there might even be scope for debate over whether <i>ma'ariv</i> is to be considered a <i>davar mitzvah</i> or a <i>reshut</i>, but nobody considers a tallit to be <i>muqtzeh</i> and I haven't found any source that even implies that putting it on in preparation would be improper.

The actual cities themselves were certainly built. They comprise three cities West of the Jordan (Kedesh, Shechem and Kiriath-arba - Joshua 20:7) and three cities East of the Jordan (Bezer, Ramoth-Gilead and Golan - Deuteronomy 4:43 and Joshua 20:8).

If you're interested, John Spencer has an article on this in <i>The Anchor Bible Dictionary</i>, under \"Refuge, Cities of\" (vol. 5, pp657-658), with a bibliography.

So I don't think that lepers and non-lepers can <em>combine</em> to form a minyan, at least not an indoors minyan. </p>\n\n<p>The Mishna seems to say that lepers can pray together with a pre-existing minyan, in shul.  Therefore, their isolation doesn't have to be total.  That's why I assume they can make their own minyan. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was Shimshon viewed positively?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is no indication in the text that the Jews were aware that Shimshon was secretly waging a one-man war against the Plishtim. From outward appearances it would seem that a former shofet of the Jews has gone off the derech and married non-Jewish women (though the Rambam indicates that they were converted in hastily convened courts). Furthermore when he died, ostensibly there were no Jews around. </p>\n\n<p>If so why was his body recovered and why was he not viewed as a villain by his contemporary Jews?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I challenge your assumption that no one knew. Consider this episode (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0715.htm#9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Judges 15:9-20</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>9 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves against Lehi. 10 And the men of Judah said: 'Why are ye come up against us?' And they said: 'To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.' 11 Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson: 'Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us?' And he said unto them: 'As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.' 12 And they said unto him: 'We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines.' And Samson said unto them: 'Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.' 13 And they spoke unto him, saying: 'No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand; but surely we will not kill thee.' And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock. 14 When he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him; and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands. 15 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men therewith. 16 And Samson said: With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men. 17 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi. 18 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said: 'Thou hast given this great deliverance by the hand of Thy servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?' 19 But God cleaved the hollow place that is in Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came back, and he revived; wherefore the name thereof was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day. 20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years. (Translation from the link above.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the beginning of the story we see that the people were not completely oblivious to Shimshon's actions in the Plishti cities. Furthermore, we are only told that Shimshon was a \"Judge\" here at the end of the story (which I note constitutes one full parshiyah). So the Jews meet him and extradite him, and then the Jews see he survived (and probably hear some stories too) and even accepted him as their Judge! The contrast shows that the Jews realized Shimshon is on their side, so to speak, were willing to accept him as their leader, and very likely realized (to some extent) that he was determined to fight the Plishtim.</p>\n\n<p>As to why his family recovered his body? They heard the story, viewed him as a hero and family member and brought him back for proper burial. I don't really see the question there.</p>\n\n\n",

She is featured rather prominently, and the angel appears to her before speaking with both her and Manoaḥ.  It would stand to reason that she is as important a character as other barren mothers who prayed for children and were blessed with great leaders for sons.  (Aside, to preempt comments comparing Shimson to some of those other leaders: Perhaps he wasn't the greatest leader or a true Navi, but he was great enough for his story to appear in TaNa\"Ch, and it's not like his father isn't named.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To answer the minim (people who deny the oral Torah) because the names of important people such as Dovid's mother or Avraham's mother is also not mentioned in the Torah is brought down through oral tradition which minim do not have(based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.91a.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 91a</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/authors/rav-chaim-navon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Chaim Navon</a> in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bnLs-xJZ0M\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this class</a> suggests that she wasn't named to symbolize that Shimshon ultimately followed in the footsteps of his father Manoach in terms of worldview and his view of his path as a judge. We see that after discovering that an angel appeared and spoke to them, Manoach was afraid that they would die. This suggests a mythic view of the world: When lowly mortals meet higher entities, the lowly mortals cannot hope to withstand the full might of the higher entities and are annihilated. Manoach's wife, on the other hand, says that if Hashem - the higher entity - wanted to kill them, He would have done so already. In other words, she understood that Hashem is interested in a dialog with man and has a plan for mankind, not merely interested in using man as a pawn or a toy. That Manoach had a lower understanding of the relationship between man and his Creator may be hinted in the words of the gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.61a.22?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 61a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Manoah was an ignoramus...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shimshon, as a judge, was given a choice: To see the bigger picture, to see his role in Hashem's master plan, or to maintain a narrow, mythic view of the world, like the Plishtim he enjoyed hanging around. Would he choose to see that his strength was a gift from Hashem to save Yisrael, or would he choose to see his strength as an attribute related to his status as a mythologic super-strong demi-god like person who acts only out of self-interest?</p>\n<p>In his early years, Shimshon at times followed one path while at other times followed the other. Eventually, his downfall came because he embraced the latter path: That of a supernatural self-serving demi-god. He slightly redeemed himself at death by finally realizing his strength came from Hashem when he said (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.16.28?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 16:28</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Then Samson called to the LORD, “O Lord GOD! Please remember me, and give me strength just this once, O God, to take revenge of the Philistines, if only for one of my two eyes.”\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, his mother remained unnamed, because even she had eventually become convinced of the truth of Manoach's path, as it says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.14.4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 14:4</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"His father and <strong>mother</strong> did not realize that this was the LORD’s doing...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even Shimshon's mother didn't realize that what was happening to her son was part of Hashem's plan. This suggests that she lost sight of the truth, of there existing a great plan for man; she too became entangled in the mythic view of the world.</p>\n\n\n",

(An explanation similar to this I heard in the name of R' Chaim Kanievsky on the first brachah of birkas hamazon)</p></li>\n<li><p>Part 3: אֵל בָּרוּךְ גְּדול דֵּעָה. הֵכִין וּפָעַל זָהֳרֵי חַמָּה. טוב יָצַר כָּבוד לִשְׁמו. מְאורות נָתַן סְבִיבות עֻזּו. פִּנּות צְבָאָיו קְדושִׁים. רומְמֵי שַׁדַּי. תָּמִיד מְסַפְּרִים כְּבוד אֵל וּקְדֻשָּׁתו: \nתִּתְבָּרַךְ ה' אֱלהֵינוּ עַל שֶׁבַח מַעֲשי יָדֶיךָ. וְעַל מְאורֵי אור שֶׁעָשיתָ. יְפָאֲרוּךָ סֶּלָה: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>(Positive descriptions of G-d)</p></li>\n<li><p>G-d made the rays of the sun (not the sun, but its rays, which are its light)</p></li>\n<li><p>(More positive descriptions)</p></li>\n<li><p>A reference to things that give off light</p></li>\n<li><p>(More positive descriptions)</p></li>\n<li><p>Praise </p></li>\n<li><p><em>and for the things that give off light which You made</em></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We see this alternates between praise and mention of the luminaries, and it no longer focuses on creations.

I will therefore address why those three areas are the main subject of the prayer.</p>\n\n<p>I would answer this based on R' Schwab's idea of prayer (see R' Schwab on Prayer p. 259). He believes that prayer is based on the architecture of the beis hamikdash: We start at the inside and work ourselves inside until the kodesh hakodashim. At this point in the prayer, we are in the heichal:</p>\n\n<p>Menorah.............Mizbach HaZahav.....................Shulchan</p>\n\n<p>Orach Chaim 94:2 (with Rama) says that menorah corresponds to spiritual needs and shulchan corresponds to physical needs. We pray concerning light corresponding to the menorah (because it has light). We pray concerning G-d's creations corresponding to shulchan (because עיני כל אליך ישברו ואתה נותן להם את אכלם בעתו, and so being a creation is therefore connected to food, the purpose of the shulchan).</p>\n\n<p>Concerning the angels, Targum Yonasan  (to kadosh kadosh kadosh) translates it as \"holy in heaven ... holy on earth ... holy forever...\" If so, <em>heaven</em> may represent the menorah (spiritual), <em>earth</em> may represent the shulchan (physical), and <em>forever</em> may represent the mizbach hazahav: As you know, Onkelos translates \"reiach nichoach\" (an expression first used by ketores in P' Noach) as \"demitkabel be'raava kadam Hashem\" (favorably received by G-d).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why does this paragraph appear at this stage in davening?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Shulchan Aruch 59:1, it says that we mention day and night by the brachos of krias shema at day and night to prove that it was the one G-d who created it all.</p>\n\n<p>Possibly, it is relevant here because we say shema twice a day, once in the evening and once at night, and we say no other brachah <em>only</em> twice a day at those times (I think). Alternatively, we say it here before shema, in which we say \"Hashem echad.\"</p>\n\n<p>(This was mostly based on something I wrote a while ago on the subject)</p>\n\n\n",

The three cases are: the daughters of Tzelophehad; Serach bat Asher; and Yocheved and Miriam.  Rashi says nothing about the first, points out that Serach is still alive (she also went into Egypt), and talks about Yocheved's conception but says nothing about why she and Miriam are mentioned here.</p>\n\n<p>Are these women mentioned here just because they're the only \"named\" women we know about, so they're included out of a sense of completeness?  Or did these women have some role in the planned conquest that calls for their mention here, in a pre-conquest census?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Just a thought of my own...</p>\n\n<p>The verses here do not list 600 thousand names; they list different the different families in each tribe, headed usually by one of the direct children or grandchildren of Yaakov's twelve sons. Those sons had descended to Egypt over 200 years ago and in all likelihood most if not all of them were not alive anymore. It is unlikely even that all of their children were still alive. But yet they are listed here.</p>\n\n<p>As such, I suggest that the names here are not those in the army who were counted but rather it maps out the important points on the family tree of each tribe. This is particularly relevant here (understanding this count to be in preparation for dividing the land of Israel) because the land would be divided based on lower level divisions, not just by the 12 macro Tribes.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth contrasting the setup here to the census in Bamidbar 1 which preceded the people's wandering in the desert in military formation. There the census only lists the tribe names, the subdivisions being irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>Thus I suggest that the women who are mentioned in this census are there because they constitute famous points on the tree.</p>\n\n<p>(Note also that this can help explain the mention of Datan and Aviram in verses 9-10)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are various explanations as to why a census is taken at this juncture. <em>Ramban</em>'s (e.g. to 26:5) is that it was needed to see whom to divide the land among. (See 26:53. This applies to the census of everyone but <em>shevet Levi</em>, who got no land and were counted separately.) In that case, we understand why the daughters of <em>Tz'lofchad</em> were counted: they got land. <em>Ramban</em> (to 26:46) cites <em>Onkelus</em> as translating 26:46 not as \"And <em>Asher</em>'s daughter's name was <em>Serach</em>\" but as \"And <em>Asher</em>'s stepdaughter's name was <em>Serach</em>\". <em>Ramban</em> proposes, based on that, that <em>Serach</em> was an only child to her father, and that she (or her descendents) therefore got land also.</p>\n\n<p>As to <em>Yocheved</em> and <em>Miryam</em>, <em>Ramban</em> (to 26:57) writes \"I don't know why he'd count the descendants of <em>Levi</em>\". He does go on to propose some possibilities, however; one of these is that \"it was done for them as honor for God, that the legion of the king not be less, that they don't count it like the rest of the people\", in which case I propose that <strong>maybe</strong> we can understand including <em>Yocheved</em> and <em>Miryam</em>, as important persons in <em>shevet Levi</em>. Rather a weak explanation, though.</p>\n\n<p>(<em>Ramban</em> himself does say \"he mentioned <em>Amram</em> and his wife [but no others of <em>Amram</em>'s generation] because the descendants of <em>Levi</em> are counted in two, <em>kohanim</em> and <em>l'viyim</em>, and it is seemly to count <em>Aharon</em> and his children separately\". However, although he mentions \"and his wife\", I don't see how that explains the mention of <em>Yocheved</em> — or, certainly, of <em>Miryam</em>.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If you read the text plainly, you can see that \"all the famous people\" of the family are mentioned and then the total of the family is given.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on which culture you come from when you read the chumash, this either shows that famous people who do great acts are as important as the soldiers, or that soldiers are as important as the famous people who do great acts.</p>\n\n\n",

Avraham wasn't inside (or rather, there's no indication that he was), so what does it mean that Hashem took him outside (as explained by Maharzu to the Midrash)? It thus gives three answers, the latter of which mean that we would no longer be under the influence of the constellations:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R' Yehudah said in the name of R' Yochanan: \"He raised him above the dome of the sky; this is what He said to him, '<em>Gaze</em>, now, to the heavens,' as 'gazing' only means looking down from above\" (as in Yeshaya 63:15 and Tehillim 80:15 - \"Gaze down from the heavens and see\" - Maharzu).<br>\n  The Sages said: \"'You are a prophet, not an astrologer,' as the verse says, 'But now, return [Avraham]'s wife, for he is a prophet [and he will pray on your behalf and you will live' (Bereishis 20:7; a prophet, not an astrologer, understands that prayer can change things - Maharzu, Eitz Yosef).<br>\n  R' Levi said: While the sandal is on your foot, walk on the thorn. All who are placed below them should fear them, but you, who are placed above them, step on them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Midrash doesn't use the phrase \"There is no Mazel in Yisrael;\" however, it is the basis for the phrase. </p>\n\n<p>In Nedarim 32a, Avraham asks Hashem what will be, as he is destined not to have children; Hashem responds that he should ignore his astrology, as there is no Mazel in Yisrael. This discussion parallels ours in Bereishis 15, except that it's referring not to our pesukim but those regarding Avraham's Bris in Bereishis 17. However, in Shabbos 156a, R' Yehudah says in the name of Rav this same discussion in our passuk, using the same derashah as the Midrash. Also in that Gemara in Shabbos, R' Yochanan learns it from a passuk in Yirmiyahu (10:2):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do not be disheartened by portents in the sky; let the nations be disheartened by them.\n  The nations, but not Yisrael. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It should be noted that R' Chanina in that Gemara in Shabbos holds that there is Mazel for Yisrael, but that it wisens and richens. </p>\n\n\n",

Nobody has suggested that they have to  suicide, or that suicide is a good option. Suicide in this case is only  a testimony of pain generated by   remotness from truth. This pain demonstrated that Rav Chyia bar Ashi loved truth. Suicide was due to pain . I mean that because of his love of truth, he became felt a moral pain  and committed suicide by \"Oness\" . I added this explanation because of an user feel that at first glance something is self contradictory. the explanation is now clear I hope.</p>\n<p>There are cases of suicide because of  shame, even if the \"suicided\" has not commited any error; Berachot 23a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For a certain student once left his tefillin in a hole adjoining the public way, and a harlot passed by and took them, and she came to the Beth ha-Midrash and said: See what So-and-so gave me for my hire, and when the student heard it, he went to the top of a roof and threw himself down and killed himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was shame only,  the student was clean,  nothing to do with a problem of Teshuva.</p>\n<p>But it seems that the Gemara in Kiddushin shows that Rav Chyia bar Ashi did repent and felt ashamed. The shame was not  necessarily,  from a logical point of view,   linked with teshuva. But he was known as a big Tsadik. Thus,  according to  the rule of \"Kaf zechut\"  we conclude that  he died because shame and pain generated by Teshuva.</p>\n<p>The source of dying because of Teshuva is in Gemara Avoda Zara 17b, concerning Eliezer Ben Dordea. Despite that he did not suicide, we see that the pain of the regret generated his dead.

Are they now also permitted to eat gebroktz because that is now the father's minhag? Would there be a difference between his son who is bar mitzvah and one who is not bar mitzvah (still under the father's rule)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Assuming the Minhag is one for which Hatarah can work, the father may represent his family as he and they are all equally part of the Minhag and all equally require Hatarah thereby sidestepping the problem of Shlichus for Hatarah, though it's really best if all those above 12/11 (those below 12/11 don't have any obligation in Nedarim yet anyway) who wish to be included in the Hatarah write and sign a document expressing their Charatah. This is based on Shu\"T Chasam Sofer YD 220. See also Shu\"T Harei Besamim (Horwitz) I 44 who disagrees. However, it must be stated that it is not necessarily so clear cut that Hataras Nedarim is appropriate and will work for a Minhag like not eating Sh'ruyah (Gebrokts) on Pesach...</p>\n\n\n",

Does not the same apply to Esther?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To respond only to your second question, there is a relevant passage in the gemara on Sanhedrin 74b. An objection is raised that concerns how Esther could have submitted herself publicly to Ahashverosh when we learn that it is better to die than to commit the sin of 'forbidden relations'. The terse resolution of Abayye is to suggest that \"Esther was like the ground\" (אסתר קרקע עולם היתה) - in other words, she was completely passive (acc. to Rashi).</p>\n\n<p>Given that this doesn't appear to resolve the gemara's problem, which is how what she did could have been done publicly, Tosafot (s.v. והא אסתר פרהסיא הואי) suggest that the crime of forbidden relations only applies in such a case as the person is actively involved. They learn this out by analogy from the crime of murder, which is one of the other three transgressions that a person must die rather than commit. In an event in which a person is only passively involved in murdering another (their example is of a person being thrown onto another), they can exempt themselves by applying the principle, \"מאי חזית דדמא דחבראי סומק טפי דלמא דמא דידי סומק טפי\" (\"What do you see [to make you think] that my friend's blood is redder? Perhaps my own blood is redder\").</p>\n\n<p>Based on the understanding of Tosafot, you might therefore say that Esther didn't actually commit a transgression at all.</p>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>If you're interested, Reb Chaim Brisker has a fascinating analysis of this Tosafot, in which he attempts to resolve it with the Rambam's opinion (the latter being learnt out solely from the fact that he <i>doesn't</i> mention this resolution to the problem). I find Reb Chaim's discourses to be considerably beyond my level of competence, personally, and if you're like me in that regard, Rabbi Yonason Hughes has an excellent book called <i>Understanding Reb Chaim</i> (Israel: 2010). He addresses this passage in the first discourse: \"Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah\".</p>\n\n\n",

Over time, people started using the appellation \"Zatzal\" - <em>zecher tzadik livracha \"May the memory of this tzaddik be a blessing\"</em> - when talking about great rabbis who have passed away.</p>\n\n<p>When did this trend start? When was the shift made from \"Zal\" to \"Zatzal\"? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Some speculation inspired by the comments to this question.</p>\n<p>The verse in Mishlei (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2810.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">10:7</a>) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זֵכֶר צַדִּיק, לִבְרָכָה; וְשֵׁם רְשָׁעִים יִרְקָב.‏</p>\n<p>The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing; but the name of the wicked shall rot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16381/showrashi/true#v7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The mention of a righteous man is for a blessing:</strong> Whoever mentions a righteous man blesses him.\n<strong>but the name of the wicked shall rot:</strong> Decay develops in their name, for no one wishes to mention his [the wicked man’s] name, and it is automatically forgotten.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Initially, people would use <em>Zichrono LeBracha</em>, <em>\"May his memory be for a blessing\"</em>, when referencing a Tzaddik who had passed away. Over time (perhaps because nobody wanted to imply that the deceased was wicked), this evolved into saying it for any person who was not a Rasha.</p>\n<p>Once this became prevalent, the need was felt to distinguish the Righteous from the Ordinary, and <em>Zecher Tzadik LeBracha</em> was born.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, we have three sets of nine; thirty (counting\n  shevarim-teruah as two).  The \"Schlah\" (Siftei Kohen, (1621-1662), a \n  Jewish legal commentator, in The Codeo f Jewish Law (Shulchan Aruch)\n  592:3-4) was stringent and favored the custom of blowing 30 sounds for\n  \"Malchiot, Zichronot and Shofrot\" (the three blessings in Musaf) and\n  added ten to complete 100 sounds.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Shevarim - Teruah, are generally counted as two sounds (in\n  counting the thirty).

R.H. 33b,; Sefer Hamanhig,\n  lii. Rosh Hashanah, sec. 21; Liq. Maharil, p. 180). Customs vary as to\n  how the hundred blasts are completed. Those who follow the Sefardic\n  practice of having thirty blasts during the silent Amidah were shy\n  ten, and added these during the Qaddish Titqabbel that follows the\n  Amidah. Those who follow the Ashkenazic rite were shy forty; they\n  added thirty at Qaddish Titqabbel and ten more after the mourner's\n  Qaddish following Aleinu. The thirty blasts follow the sequence n\"vr,\n  n\"wn, n\"in three times, and the ten follow the same se¬quence once.\n  Each set of thirty is concluded with a long blast—as a sign that the\n  prescribed sounds of this section have come to an end (Maharil).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Isaac Klein, Guide to Jewish Religious Practice, JTS, 1979</p>\n\n<p>The conclusion is that tradition, derived from a rabbinic explanation of a Talmudic gloss, has taken hold in the custom of sounding the shofar 100 times on Tosh HaShanah. </p>\n\n\n",

Although you need knowledge (\"chachmah\") even not counting the wealth, the \"chachmah\" refers to knowledge (I guess he means secular knowledge).

If you are not wrapping, you may not make this blessing.  (Others may hold that although the blessing is \"to wrap\", that's just b/c that's what they did, but it isn't necessary, as long as the mitzva of wearing is done.)</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch haRav: to fulfill \"all opinions\", meaning even Opinion C within Opinion B, one should do some sort of wrap.</p>\n\n<p>Granted that one will not fulfill Opinion A.</p>\n\n\n",

What I'm really interested in is, now that this has taken on such an important status, does that mean that there is some Halachic weight to the sermon, such that (aside from general Kavod for the sensibilities of those around us) one would actually be required to stay in the Shul for the sermon, one may not talk during the sermon, and/or one may not engage in other Torah learning during the sermon?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In short, to answer the question, I personally do not believe that there is any special halakhic status for sermons.</p>\n\n<p>Morever...</p>\n\n<p>If you get the rabbi's permission to avoid the sermon, then it is my hunch that it is in fact Halachically permissible to avoid it. However, if people notice that you are missing, I recommend telling them that the rabbi explicitly permitted to skip it, since you did get permission after all.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>minhag</em> at many <em>batei k'nesiyot</em> is that it is permissible to enter quietly during a sermon, but never to leave. However if one must leave for an emergency, it should also be done quietly. I have seen people reading sefarim during sermons, but I believe this is because people would fall asleep otherwise, which is a greater level of disrespect. Therefore, to avoid that, they learn, which is not so bad in comparison and it prevents a more severe transgression.</p>\n\n<p>Also, children who are well-behaved are permitted to sit in the main sanctuary and listen quietly to the rabbi as long as they will not cause any interruptions. But many children stay at home on shabbat morning or have their own groups with their friends where parents send them to stay out of trouble.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A story which may shed some light. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein was wishing farewell to a student going back to his home state for bein hazmanim. He told the young scholar that when the community Rabbi spoke between Mincha and Maariv, he should be careful to listen and not to learn any other sfarim, even though that Rabbi was not so learned. He reasoned, this Rabbis words are the only connection the congregation has to any degree of Torah. If they see you listening and taking it seriously, they will too. If they see you uninterested and unimpressed, they will be too. </p>\n\n<p>As brought in Meged Givaas Olam.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I can't see that the rabbi's sermon holds any special halachic status that should require someone to stay in shul to hear it, just on its own. The requirement to be there may come from its alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>If you're out in the hallway, you're probably shmoozing and <em>mevatel Torah</em> (i.e. \"wasting time\") which is a problem, when the rav is talking Divrei Torah (assuming that's the focus of his sermon. The sermon is not always Divrei Torah, you know.) However, if you leave the shul to learn Torah by yourself or with a chavruta, then, you're on an equal plane, most likely - possibly better!</p>\n\n<p>I have seen, unfortunately, too many people use the rabbi's sermon time to join the schnapps \"club\". This has been such a huge problem in my neighborhood, BTW, because men and sometimes teenagers were getting drunk. So much so, that the OU and Young Israel intervened and made their affiliated shuls completely ban schnapps from the shul. (Some don't even have wine in the shul for kiddush.) This alternative causes Chillul Hashem, among other problems. So, it's obvious, in this case, that you should be listening to the sermon.</p>\n\n<p>Most rabbis probably don't mind if you're looking at the Chumash or learning during the sermon. But, to be safe, you may want to ask him, unless you know him well enough that he wouldn't mind or is \"oblivious\" to who is listening. (I think many rabbis have no clue how many people are and how many aren't listening.) If you really want to learn, than, of course, your best option is to leave before the sermon. Just make sure you return in time for Musaph, of course :-)</p>\n\n<p>Leaving in the middle of a sermon is rude, unless you can't help it. If your kid is next to you and starts to shriek or get fidgety, seriously, you need to take him / her out. (I can't understand why some parents insist on keeping a screaming kid in shul during the sermon because they think it's rude to leave.) Leaving a child, there competes with the rabbi and the other congregants who are trying to hear him. That's probably some sort of halachic problem (a form of stealing, perhaps?) if you cause a disturbance or, in this case, do nothing to prevent one. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I should add that there is an \"indirect\" halachic requirement to listen to the sermon in these areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Kavod Harav</em> (A derivation from \"Mipnei Seivah Takum\", perhaps. One should show respect to someone who has wisdom.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Chinuch</em> - educating your kids. It is extremely important that young kids see their father listening to words of Torah from the rav. It teaches them that when they are in yeshiva and their rebbe, or rosh yeshiva speaks that they have to be respectful and listen. Sadly, these days, there is far less respect for rebbes and teachers than there was 30 - 40 years ago. I am quite certain that having fathers leave the shul during the rav's drasha has been a contributory factor.</p></li>\n<li><p>As mentioned above, the \"kiddush / schnapp's club\" has been the biggest damage to <em>chinuch</em>. I don't understand why so many people - esp. fathers who bring young kids to shul - do this.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Petersburg on matters of communal concern.</p>\n  \n  <p>On the eve of his departure he told him the following: \"when I was\n  summoned in 1843 to the rabbinical conference in S Petersburg. I went\n  to pray at the resting place of my saintly mother at Liozna, and she\n  told me that by virtue of her self-sacrifice for chassidim and for\n  Chassidism she had been privileged to be granted entry to the palace\n  of the Baal Shem Tov in heaven. She had requested the Baal Shem Tov to\n  pray on my behalf, and had asked him to give her some sgulah that\n  would enable me to withstand the opposition of the antagonists of\n  Chassidism. The Baal Shem Tov had answered: 'Your son knows - by\n  heart, and letter perfect - the Five books of the Chumash, all the\n  psalms in the books of Tehillim, and the book of Tanya. Now we read in\n  the Torah, that the sons of the Patriarch Yaakov were not harmed by\n  the Canaanites because of 'the dread (חתת) of G-d was upon the cities\n  around them.' The tree consonants of this word are the initial letters\n  of the Hebrew names of these three books: Chumash, Tehillim, Tanya. He\n  who is thoroughly acquainted with every letter in them is granted the\n  spiritual strength to shatter all the obstacles that prevent the\n  revelation of holiness.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Therefore,\" Reb Menachem Mendel instructed his son Reb Shmuel,\n  \"wherever you may be, whether in government institutions or with\n  ministers of state, recite a chapter of Chumash, a psalm from the Book\n  of Tehillim, and a chapter of Tanya.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Many years later Reb Shmuel recounted this episode to his son, Reb\n  Shalom Ber, and added: \"It was a wonderful prescription. With the\n  first three chapters of the Chumash, three psalms from the Book of\n  Tehillim, and three chapters of Tanya, all the plans of the maskilim\n  collapsed, and the Children of Israel, true to the Torah, came out\n  triumphant.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Learning Chitas is something that is in the realm of every Jew. Before the revelation of Chassidus, \"learning\" was limited to the Yeshiva Elite and the average Jew was not able to learn Torah. Why was it only until recent that such a formula was established? This I do not know but Chitas in one way or another was done by Chassidim before the Rebbe Rayatz (6th Lubavitcher Rebbe) set up an official system.</p>\n\n<p>Chumash with Rashi has been learning for hundreds of years and is a topic of discussion in the Shulchan Aruch as to if Chumash with Rashi fulfills the Torah requirement of \"shnayim mikra v’echad targum\" Learning the text of the weekly parsha twice with the targum. </p>\n\n<p>The simplest Jews have been saying Tehillim for hundreds if not thousands of years. One of the reasons being that while there are opinions that a person must know the words of Torah he learns, this is not the case with Tehillim as simply reciting the Hebrew has a power on its own which is why 75% or more of our davening is from tehillim. </p>\n\n<p>Tanya while a new Sefer is nothing new as the Alter Rebbe says in the very beginning all he did was compile sources into a small book. </p>\n\n<p>What is the value? If you find value in learning Torah then there is a great amount of value. If you do not ascribe to the Chassidic value of learning that is available to all of Klal Yisroel then your question should be reworded to whether learning Chitas is a good use of your time instead of learning Gemara with Tosafos and Poskim. </p>\n\n<p>As a Chasid, I would say for any Jew it has immense value.</p>\n\n\n",

In common practice, when a law is described, is the citation given form the main sources or derived codified books?\n(Please consider explaining any Jewish/Hebrew terms.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>G-d gave all the laws to Moses, and he passed it on to his students orally until the time of R' Yehudah, who wrote everything down in the mishnah in a concise way (Gitin 60a). We accept everything written there, since it came from G-d Himself. However, by that time, disputes had already risen over things that had to do with logic (which we are expected to apply to other cases when relevant), but not over the tradition itself (Tosafos Yom Tov, Avos 1:4). At around the same time, baraysos (laws not included in the mishnah) were written by contemporaries of R' Yehudah (e.g. Tosefta by R' Chiya). (See also <a href=\"http://lists.aishdas.org/pipermail/avodah-aishdas.org/2012q2/023712.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>.) </p>\n\n<p>R' Yehudah had three students, Rav, Shmuel, and R' Yochanan (Introduction to Mishneh Torah). Rav and Shmuel moved to Babylonia, and are therefore major authorities in the Talmud Bavli, while R' Yochanan moved to Israel, and became an authority for the Talmud Yerushalmi (these are both commentaries on the mishnah). However, they didn't actually write these Talmuds, but rather their students did. It turned out that the Yerushalmi was completed before the Bavli. Therefore, we assume that the ones who put everything in the Bavli saw everything in the Yerushalmi, so if the Bavli disagrees, we assume the Bavli disagrees even though it saw the Yerushalmi, so it must have had a good reason for disagreeing. However, if the Yerushalmi is not in doubt and the Bavli is in doubt, we follow the Yerushalmi. This is the explanation that I heard. See also Sdei Chemed Klalei HaPoskim <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41687&st=&pgnum=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:1</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Also, there was the Zohar, written by R' Shimon bar Yochai, but we follow the Bavli over Zohar (Mishnah Brurah 25:42 in the name of the Kneses HaGedolah; see also <a href=\"http://hamakor.org/metahala/zohar.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">these sources</a>). We also follow Yerushalmi over Zohar (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/17202/zohar-vs-yerushalmi\">this answer</a>). We follow Tosefta over Yerushalmi as well (see Sdei Chemed Klalei HaPoskim <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41687&st=&pgnum=5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:5</a>; the Pri Chadash quoted there disagrees). There were other works (e.g. Sifra, Sifri, etc.), but I won't cover them all.</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards, disputes arose in the intent of those Talmuds themselves. There rose up many works of law in order to clarify which opinions in the Talmuds we follow, etc. There were many works (e.g. Bahag), but the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Alfasi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rif</a>'s commentary was the first most accepted original work to explain the law. After him rose the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambam\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a>, who most of the time followed the Rif (Migdal Oz in many places). The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_ben_Jehiel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh</a> also wrote a commentary. These three works were the ones that formed the basis for most of the laws of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_ben_Asher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur</a> (the son of the Rosh).</p>\n\n<p>The two people who wrote the first commentary on the Tur were the Beis Yosef (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Yosef Karo</a>) and the Darkei Moshe (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Isserles\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Moshe Isserless</a>), who explained (and sometimes disputed) the decisions of the Tur. But after all their comments, it ended up being that it took a lot of work to find the practical halachah. Therefore, the Beis Yosef wrote the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch</a> (\"set table\"), arranged like the order of the Tur, which only contained the practical halachah, its source being the corresponding chapter in the Tur, from which anyone could see how the law developed.</p>\n\n<p>After the Shulchan Aruch, new commentaries came up to explain it and dispute it, so now the most common work to find the halachah is the Shulchan Aruch and its commentaries.</p>\n\n<p>(As a side note, these commentaries which disputed their predecessors didn't dispute the authority of the Talmuds; they either found a case in the Talmuds which they brought as proof against a different case, or made rulings based on logic.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a non-Jew don tefillin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>May a non-Jew or a person who is in the conversion process don tefillin? If not, what are the reasons that they cannot?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>A non-Jew certainly <em>may</em> wear tefillin (in other words, there is no law against them doing so), but they will not be fulfilling a mitzvah. From that perspective, they might be viewed in the same way that one views a Jewish woman who lays tefillin: the Shulchan Arukh (Orach Chaim 38:3) exempts her but allows her to wear them if she wishes. Note, however, that the Rema does not permit women to wear tefillin (although he does not comment on a non-Jewish man doing so), and you can see the explanation of the Magen Avraham for this <em>in situ</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Arukh prohibits non-Jews from writing the scrolls that go into tefillin (Orach Chaim 39:1), but it also mentions that if a non-Jew is in possession of tefillin one makes the assumption that they are kosher. Nowhere, however, does it refer to non-Jews who choose to wear them.</p>\n\n<p>That said, the Rambam does speak about non-Jews choosing to perform mitzvot in which they've not been commanded (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=107870&rid=15013\"><em>Hilkhot Melachim</em> 10:10</a>), and even suggests that they receive some measure of reward for doing so. If you look at what <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=107870&rid=15013\">the Radbaz</a> has to say on this point, you'll see that he mentions tefillin in particular:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומכל מקום במצוה שצריכין קדושה וטהרה כגון תפילין ס\"ת ומזוזה אני חוכך\n  להחמיר שלא יניחו אותם לעשותן</p>\n  \n  <p>In any case, when it comes to mitzvot that require sanctity and\n  purity, such as [wearing] tefillin or [writing] a sefer Torah or a\n  mezuzah, I deliberated and am stringent¹: we should not allow them [non-Jews] to\n  do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, while the law appears to be in favour of them doing so, <em>if they should wish to do so</em>, and while it may even be possible to construe the Rambam's words as suggesting that they even receive some degree of merit (despite not performing a mitzvah), there is also scope for a less lenient position, as per the Radbaz, and as per a possible extrapolation from the writings of the Rema and the Magen Avraham.</p>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>¹ The expression that I have translated above as \"I deliberated and am stringent\" appears in the Mishna, Nedarim 1:1. It literally translates to \"I hesitate to be stringent\", but its meaning is as I have rendered it above (cf: Jastrow, חכך II; Kehati, Ned 1:1).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Barry Fruendel, who has been representing the RCA in negotiations with the Israeli rabbinate to establish standards for American conversions acceptable to the Israel rabbinate, instructed one convert I know to put on tefillin and to wear a tallis (he was married) before completing his conversion.  Frankly, I was suprised.  When I was working to get an Orthodox conversion -- I had a Conservative conversion first and thereafter wore tefillin -- I had to stop wearing tefillin until I completed my conversion.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>I believe that there is a difference between putting on tefilin with or without a bracha. A boy preparing for his bar-mitzvah may put on tefillin without a bracha, since he is not yet obligated to do so, but he may practice putting them on so that he may learn how to do so. In the same way, I believe that a potential convert my try on a  pair of tefilin as a learning experience, but he may not make a bracha;neither on the shel yad or the shel rosh.</p>\n\n\n",

Is this correct?</p>\n\n<p>Also, many times what seems to be Aramaic finds its way into a braisa or mishna, is that true or not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think that the best way to answer this question would be to recommend that you acquire a good reference grammar and acquaint yourself with Babylonian Talmudic Aramaic. To that end, the most readable is certainly the one by <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1583306064\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yitzhak Frank</a>, though I prefer the one by <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/094387274X\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alger Johns</a>, even though it's technically for Biblical Aramaic. You might also want to look at M.H. Segal's <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1579107869\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grammar of Mishnaic Hebrew</a>. If you do, you'll see that the Hebrew of the Mishna, the Tosefta, the tannaitic midrashim and the beraitot is all very influenced by Aramaic, in terms of grammar (the construction of individual words), syntax (the construction of sentences) and orthography (spelling).</p>\n\n<p>That's so far as your second question is concerned. So far as the first is concerned, there is variation between לְךָ and לָךְ even within the Hebrew of Tanakh, specifically when the referent is masculine. Unless you are able to provide an example that indicates otherwise, I imagine that is the situation here too. It has nothing to do with the difference between Hebrew and Aramaic, but reflects merely on differing orthographic conventions. Likewise, you will see masculine plurals in the Mishna alternating, even within a single mishna, between possessing a final <em>mem</em> or a final <em>nun</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot speak for the vocalisation of ArtScroll, but there is a vocalisation tradition for the Mishna that is well established. In fact, there was even a system of accentuation at one time as well, with Tiberian te'amim, such as we find in the MT. You can see manuscripts of the Mishna, some of which are vocalised, at <a href=\"http://web.nli.org.il/sites/nli/Hebrew/collections/jewish-collection/Talmud/Pages/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this site</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As a general rule, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Babylonian_Aramaic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Babylonian Aramaic</a>, the stream of Aramaic used by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud#Talmud_Bavli_.28Babylonian_Talmud.29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talmud Bavli</a>, vocalizes לך as לָךְ, even when addressing a male, despite the fact that this is generally used only when addressing females in Hebrew. </p>\n\n<p>Generally, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnah\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishnah</a> is written in Hebrew. However, it is written in what is known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnaic_Hebrew\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishnaic Hebrew</a>. What that means is that the lines between Aramaic and Hebrew, which are closely related languages, began to be blurred in the era in which the Mishnah was written. </p>\n\n<p>So, your impression of the phenomenon in the Artscroll is correct - ie., the pattern you've noticed that it uses one vocalization for males in Aramaic, but uses the other vocalization for males in Hebrew, is correct.  Furthermore, some Aramaic - or, more often, Aramaic <em>patterns</em> in Hebrew - are evident in the primarily-Hebrew Mishnah.</p>\n\n\n",

In the mishna there, a non-Jew lifts up barrels of a Jew's wine and pours wine out to make a purchase. The only question there is one of ownership (kinyan hagba'ah). If the ownership is not effected, the wine in the barrel doesn't become unfit. Where does this additional measure of forbidden-ness come from?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Before the answer to your question The gemoro Avoda zara 71a is talking about selling all of the wine in the barrel to an idol worshiper. When the idolater pours the contents prior to an agreed payment he renders the barrel Yayin nesech i.e \"poured\" wine, and since he did not yet owe any money to the Jew Because the payment of the money makes the acquisition (the idolator has not yet payed)\nSo you are mistaken in your words \"If the ownership is not effected, the wine in the barrel doesn't become unfit.\"</p>\n<p>This is from oukosher.org everything you need to know:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stam yainum refers to wine which might have been poured for an idolatrous service, but we did not see it happen. In the days of the Mishnah, there was a pagan ritual to pour off some wine from every bottle in honor of an idol. Because of the uncertainty, the rabbis decreed that wine that was produced by a nachri, or even kosher wine which was left unattended with a nachri, is forbidden for drinking and benefit because it may have been poured for idolatry. After the rabbinic decree was enacted we treat stam yainum as if we saw it being poured (Tur Y.D. 123).</p>\n<p>Even if the nachri who touched the wine was a monotheist, and he would therefore certainly not serve an idol, the rabbis still forbade the wine, for another reason—because sharing wine can lead to intermarriage. However, in this case, it is only forbidden to drink the wine, but one may benefit from this wine in other ways (e.g., it may be bought and sold). (See Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 123:26 and Shach 123:51.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So while an idolater touching the barrel will not render it unfit, pickink it up and pouring it without touching it will.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that the Mechaber holds that when you actually pick up the vessel and pour everything becomes Assur, even what is left in the vessel. This is because this is the definition of Nissuch, and therefore, even if the non-Jew did not shake (shichshuch) the wine in the vessel, it still becomes Yayin Nesech.</p>\n\n<p>The other cases are not the definition of Nissuch, and therefore the wine left over is not forbidden (provided the non-Jew didn't shake it, etc.)</p>\n\n<p><em>The Mechaber's source is the Rambam Hilchot Maachalot Assurot, Chapter 12. In Halacha 2 (English Translation from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/968268/jewish/Chapter-12.htm#footnoteRef7a968268\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) he says:</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>If he took an [open] container of wine, lifted it up, and poured it out, the wine becomes forbidden, even though he did not shake it.

The Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De'ah 125:1) quotes the more stringent view. The Rama mentions the more lenient opinion, but states that it may be followed only in a case of severe loss.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Be'er Hetev concludes that the Shach says that things are much more lenient these days, when the non-Jews these days are not considered idol worshipers. Whether we hold that non-Jews are considered idol worshipers is discussed in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/89/is-christianity-avodah-zara\">this question</a>, and others.</p>\n\n\n",

And it was composed by human beings, rather than falling from the sky.</p>\n\n<p>The source for it falling from the sky and being instituted by the Anshei Knesset HaGedolah is the Or Zaruah, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_ben_Moses_of_Vienna\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Yitzchak ben Moshe of Vienna</a>, in 1260.</p>\n\n<p>Saadia Gaon instituted that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barukh_she%27amar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baruch sheAmar</a> be recited on Shabbos, but in France, the custom developed to recite this prayer daily.</p>\n\n<p>The Pri Chadash wonders at how the Geonim could institute a new tefillah. <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/Eng/?CategoryID=160&ArticleID=6722\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thus</a>,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In any case, the blessing \"Baruch She'amar\" is not mentioned explicitly in the Talmud. The author of the Pri Chadash wonders about this. \"I do not understand: How could the Geonim add a new blessing after the Talmud was finished and sealed?\" [Orach Chaim 51].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet others point to early sources for it. Thus,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Others disagree with Pri Chadash and they have shown that early sources exist for the blessing Baruch She'amar. The Mordechai implies that it is a decree made by the Anshei Knesset Hagedola (end of the tractate of Pesachim). The blessing also appears in \"Shiltei Hagiborim\" in the name of the Talmud Yerushalmi (Berachot Chapter 5). Avudraham also quotes the Yerushalmi, although this does not appear in our version of the Talmud. The TAZ writes in the name of Tola'at Yaacov, who quotes Or Zarua, that \"this praise for G-d was established by the Anshei Knesset Hagedola based on a note that fell from heaven.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've heard that sometimes 'Yerushalmi' is used to refer to midrash. But regardless, just because the Or Zarua says it fell from heaven and was established by the Anshei Knesset Hagedola does not make it absolutely so.</p>\n\n<p>And at the least, Rambam (who predates Or Zarua) did necessarily hear this (later) Or Zarua. If this was not the universally accepted theory, then people would feel free to modify it.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of בפי vs. בפה, see <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2010/07/fee-fi-fo-fum-deviating-from-masorah.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">my post</a> in which I show that there is a regular change because \"fi\" had negative connotations in French. And then kabbalists likely came and bolstered this change with kabbalistic ideas. But the original is the grammatical one, בפי.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>All prayers were composed by someone, at some point, yet for many of them we have multiple versions. Generally it's because the original version is not known and people have different traditions as to what it was; sometimes it's because the original version is not known and people make different emendations in favor of what they think it must have been. I don't know which of those is true of \"<em>Baruch sheamar</em>\" (perhaps both are), but I don't see that its having fallen from the sky makes it any less subject to later changes than any other prayer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beureihatefila.com/files/Baruch_Sh_Amar.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is a link to a discussion about the various versions of Baruch Sh'amar.</a></p>\n\n<p>In brief, this link discusses why and how some versions use the word בפי ('in the mouth of...') and some (most, actually) use the word בפה ('in the mouth,' with no grammatical connection to whose mouth it is) even though this represents a later change and is ungrammatical. It seems to be based on a kabbalistic interpretation having to do with gematria. The switch to בפה makes the word add up to same gematria as the number of words in Baruch Sh'amar, which is 87 and equal to פז, paz, refined gold, which, in turn, is symbolic of Hashem's glory.</p>\n\n<p>This discussion also addresses the topic of why the text was allowed to be changed even though it \"fell from the sky.\" Of course, many poskim feel that the text was actually instituted by the Anshei Kenneset ha-Gedolah. The discussion in the link recounts the entire history of these opinions.</p>\n\n<p>As for the differences between the order of the initial praises regarding Divine Speech and Creation, I couldn't find a source for this but I would imagine it has to do with interpretations of the process of Ma'aseh B'reishit. Nusach Ashkenaz begins the process with praising the act of Creation itself, while Nusach S'fard begins with praising the the fact that Hashem speaks and creates. It's a difference in emphasis of the elements of the process of creation.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, for example, if a parent buys a piece of furniture and puts it in the child's room in the parent's house, whether that child is a <em>bar mitzva</em> or not yet, but assuming the child is dependent on the parent, then the furniture remains the parent's. (If that's wrong, please source a correction, and that'd make a good answer.)</p>\n\n<p>My questions are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do any sources discuss whether referring to the object as the child's constitutes a declaration of intent to grant it to the child? For example, if the parent says \"this X is yours\" or \"this X is for you\" or \"your X is dirty\", do any sources say that constitutes sufficient declaration of intent to grant the X to the child, so that the child need then only drag or lift the X (<em>SA CM</em> 200:2) in order to acquire it?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If <em>not</em> — if, in fact, the object remains the parent's property —</p>\n\n<p>Or, in a case in which such acquisition has not occurred, and the object is, so far, the parent's property —</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is there any extent to which a parent-owned object assigned to the use of a specific child (again, whether a minor or a <em>bar mitzva</em> but assuming the child is dependent on and living with the parent) is considered that child's?

(see there for more details).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The Commandment concerning the Korban Pesach</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9937/showrashi/true#v1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bamidbar 9:1</a>) says that we are explicitly told that this event happened before the events beginning of Bamidbar to teach us that there is no set order to the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>Without the dates given, some would argue that this was not out of order.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The first journey from Mount Sinai</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14293&pgnum=198\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gur Aryeh</a> explains Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9938/showrashi/true#v11\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bamidbar 10:11</a>) as follows: Why does the Torah tell us the date they left, so that we know it was almost 12 months. Just like a Chatan must stay with his wife during the first year of marriage, so too G-d and the Jews did not travel for the first year (See the Gur Aryeh for an explanation of why they left 10 days early and did not wait the full year).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The Jews arrival at Kadesh (followed by the death of Miriam)</strong> </p>\n\n<p>WARNING: This is weak conjecture on my part -- Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9948/showrashi/true#v2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bamidbar 20:2</a>) tells us that we see that the Jews had water all 40 years in the merit of Miriam, since it stopped after her death. However, since Miriam passed away in the first half of the month of Nissan, it would not be before the 40th year started, on the 15th of Nissan, only be 39 years, not 40.</p>\n\n<p>However, we already know that the first Rosh Chodesh Nissan the Jews spent in the desert was called \"The Second Year\" (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9937/showrashi/true#v1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bamidbar 9:1</a>. See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=19&daf=60b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gittin 60B</a> - mentioned in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9933/showrashi/true#v2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi 5:2</a> - that this was Rosh Chodesh). </p>\n\n<p>So we can say that Rashi is saying that this is why the Torah tells us they arrived at Kadesh in Nissan, to let us know that they arrived once the 40th year had already started. Based on the principle \"Miktzat Shana K'Shana\", Rashi is saying that the water was provided in Miriam's honor for 40 years in the desert.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The death of Aharon</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure about this one. I haven't found a Rashi that discusses the date of Aharon's passing.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Alternative reason why the Torah mentions when Miriam and Aharon passed away:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2311.htm#8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zechariah 11:8</a> says, \"And I cut off the three shepherds in one month\". The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=9&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ta'anit 9A</a>) says that this refers to Moshe, Aharon, and Miriam. If the Torah didn't tell us the dates Miriam and Aharon passed away, I might think that they all passed away in the same month. </p>\n\n<p>[Instead, the Talmud says that after Miriam and Aharon passed away, the Well and Clouds disappeared, only to reappear in the merit of Moshe. When Moshe passed away all three disappeared again. This was considered as if Moshe, Aharon, and Miriam were taken at the same time.]</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What influences and books do modern Jews read today is it as it is said in the encylopedias? please help\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The sources for Jewish law have changed over the years.... I don't think any law written is the law of God anymore. The original books and teachings have been left behind. The Jewish Encyclopedia, the Judaic Encyclopedia and the Universal Jewish Encyclopedia tell us of the movement and change over time, the oldest being the Jewish Encyclopedia, and give the original outline of law and its original words. The only problem is the scribes of the Pharisees. The Jewish Encyclopedia says that the Judaism of the Old Testament and modern Judaism are very different: it says that after Nebuchadnezzar conquered Judea, 6th century BC, and led Judeans to Babylon, they had challenges to keep to their ways. Scribes of the Pharisees were put in place to write new laws. These 70 elders are mentioned to be wrong and made the law of God void. The scribes of the Pharisees prospered and there verbal Judaism was reconstructed and only written down in 135 BC; and they wrote down their religion into the Talmud which prospered and spread even to the powerful land of Khazar. Hence the two variations of the two groups: Babylon Jews and Khazar Jews; Khazar, who are mixed bloodline, making up around 70%. But the books that are read seem to be from the Old Testament, as, once they came to Europe, the scribes of the Pharisees had to adjust again. I would like to know, though: today, what do people read from? As the Jewish Encyclopedia states no one reads from the Old Testament; the 70 elders changed the course of God's word and replaced it with man made rules. What do you read: the new Babylonian Talmud or the Old Testament?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Both: we read <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_Talmud\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Babylonian Talmud</a> <em>and</em> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tanach</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam recommends spending one third of one's available time for study reading Tanach, and the other two thirds reading Talmud (Hilchot Talmud Torah 1:11).</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Tam on the other hand (Tosfot Sanhedrin 24a sv Belulah), feels that by reading Talmud, one also is credited with reading Tanach because the Talmud is full of citations from Tanach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Jews read many sources.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Publicly fixed readings</strong></p>\n\n<p>We read the Torah publicly three times weekly.  The entire Torah is thus read entirely each year - from \"In the Beginning\" until the end of Deuteronomy.</p>\n\n<p>We read another section of the Bible weekly (usually something from one of the later prophets, but there's a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haftarah#List_of_Haftarot%20set%20order\" rel=\"nofollow\">set order</a>).  On Purim, we read the Book of Esther twice.  On Tisha B'Av, we read Lamentations twice.  On Passover and some before Shabbat, we read Song of Songs (Canticles).  On Shavuot, we read Ruth. On Sukkot, we read Ecclesiastes.</p>\n\n<p>We read many psalms in whole on a regular basis - daily, weekly, monthly - as part of our fixed prayers, or as part of various ceremonies (funerals, rememberances, etc.).  Most of our prayers are also dotted with lines from or references to Psalms and Proverbs, as well as Torah and other parts of the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>We also publicly read excerpts from the Talmud and from the Mishnah on a regular basis.  Some congregations also read excerpts from the Zohar, a later mystical understanding of the Torah.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Non-fixed readings</strong></p>\n\n<p>In other settings, Jews read many sources.  Some occupy their days learning Talmud.  Others read from the Bible.  Others learn Zohar.  Some learn midrash - stories.  Others learn commentaries of the more famous rabbis or they learn laws as they've evolved over time.  Many Jews who consider themselves learned can read from the Torah and Prophets directly using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretic_text\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masoretic text</a> which has remained consistent since at least the 10th century (the exact letters of the Five Books themselves have been around much longer - there have been minor changes to the later books).</p>\n\n<p>Most people consider all of the above to be part of the rich corpus of Jewish thought.  The Torah, the rest of the Bible, Mishnah, both Talmuds, works of law, like the Shulchan Aruch, writings of rabbis like Rashi and Ramban, the mystical Zohar, the intellectual works of moderns and the moral works like The Path of the Just.  All of these are just a portion of the influences of modern Jewish thought.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Apocrypha and miscellany</strong></p>\n\n<p>As for the Khazars and the Pharisees, I think you need to read a bit more on that.  It seems you have confused a number of parts of history - some of which may very well be apocryphal.  I'd suggest perhaps taking a class on Jewish history if that interests you.  <a href=\"http://www.fmams.org.il/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Florence Melton Adult Mini-School</a> is an incredible two-year program that might help you answer a lot of the questions you've been asking about Jewish thought, Jewish ethics, and Jewish history.

Geulah is not just an idea either, it is an physical reality that we will physically experience. The Lubavitcher Rebbe pushed the Kehot (official Lubavitcher Publishing Company) to compile and print a set of seforim called \"Yalkut Inyanei Geulah U'Moshiach for this very reason. The seforim source everything from Tanach, Talmud, Midrash, Rishionim, all the way up to current day Jewish leaders, Chassidic, Sephardi, and even Litvish. Just like you cant appreciate nuclear physics or the process of brain surgery, how can you \"believe\", \"appreciate\", and \"yearn\" for Moshiach and Geulah if you have not the slightest clue what either mean? </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I've found that it sometimes helps to listen or read about stories of great rabbis who possessed this true emunah. When you hear about how they would actually make active decisions based on their faith of the redemption, it could stir up such feelings in you. (At least from my personal experience.) For example, I heard of a great rabbi (perhaps Rabbi Moshe teitelbaum - the great great grandfather of the last Samar rebbe?) who actually hired and paid somebody to be his shomer - guard - who would wake him up from his sleep immediately if he would hear the blasts of the shofar that herald the coming of the messiah </p>\n\n\n",

The custom not to eat meat or drink wine (developing from selectively applying the practices in <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/bbasra/points/bb-ps-060.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 60b</a> )was also applied. During a seudat mitzvah, we are allowed (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9940/meat-at-a-seudat-mitzvah\">required or not has been discussed</a>) to eat meat and drink wine so the level of heter has to be more persuasive than the level of the issur and yet <strong>this prohibitive-minhag at least is grounded in a specific type of activity discussed in the gemara</strong>. Why is the level of heter not then considered more powerful than the prohibitions we take on as minhagim beyond meat eating, ones which are <em>not</em> mentioned in the gemara?</p>\n\n<p>If you say that the prohibition of meat/wine stems from the connection between them and terms for simcha (contraindicated in a time of sadness) then, not only does that ignore the Bava Batra logic of meat/wine=korban, but it opens up the door to logic and wordplay which would connect bathing, wearing clean bigdei chag or hair cutting to simcha as well [no, I don't have the actual words yet, but if I could be empowered to find the connection, I would, and I'd throw a rocking barber-party next week].</p>\n\n<p>In summary, once a seudat mitzvah can push aside the talmudic not eating meat, why can't it push aside other seemingly arbitrary minhagim of \"sadness.\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A <em>s'udas mitzva</em> <strong>can</strong> put aside the other sad customs!</p>\n\n<p>Well, no, the <strong><em>s'uda</em></strong> can't, perhaps, but that's because a <em>s'uda</em> has nothing to do with cutting hair or the like.

    "title": "Ostrich eggs in Shul?",
    "content": "# Ostrich eggs in Shul?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Kinyan L'Shabbos (published weekly by Hamodia) - July 18, 2012, page 11 has a fascinating article by Rabbi Avraham Y. Heschel regarding an ancient custom of displaying ostrich eggs in a Beis Knesses. Seemingly an ostrich, unlike other birds, does not sit on its eggs but keeps them warm simply by gazing at them from a distance. It mentions it in the name of <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42978&st=&pgnum=837&hilite=\">HaRav Yaakov Emden Zatzal</a> and explains that the reason is that they are meant to remind the Mispallelim of the awesome power of looking at something, and to inspire them to concentrate on Davening and not look in other directions. </p>\n\n<p>It also mentions <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33215&st=%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5+%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C&pgnum=193&hilite=34cd0efc-8755-42c5-830c-ed23309bad11\">three reasons from the Sefer Midrash Talpios</a> by Harav Eliyahu Hakohen, author of the Shevet Musar. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It is to remind us that in order for our Tefillos to be accepted, Kavanah is key. Therefore the eggs are present to remind the Mispallelim to ensure that nothing may interrupt our prayer and thus stand between us and Hakadosh Baruch Hu, Whom we are addressing personally.</p></li>\n<li><p>The eggs symbolize the fact that the Eye of Hashem (so to speak) is at all times focused on Klal Yisrael. Nothing can possibly get in the way of this Hashgacha Pratis. Like the eggs that hatch only through the continuous surveillance of the mother ostrich. whose gaze must be continuous without distraction or interruption, or else the chicks will not survive. so we owe our survival solely to the constant Hashgacha of Hashem.</p></li>\n<li><p>A Beis HaKnesses is a Mikdash Me'at, and placing the ostrich eggs there serve as a reminder of the fact that the Torah tells us (Devarim 11:12) that the \"Eye of Hashem\" is always watching Eretz Yisrael, and this in turn inspires us to Daven for the Geula and the rebuilding of the Beis Hamikdash.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.biu.ac.il/jh/parasha/teruma/ara.htm\">This article from Bar Ilan University</a> has more information regarding this Minhag.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone ever seen ostrich eggs in their Shul? If not why was this Minhag discontinued? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>I actually have heard of this minhag before, although I have never seen an ostrich egg in a synagogue myself. It was a fairly common symbol in both Christianity and Islam, and so churches and mosques would frequently have ostrich eggs in them as well (see <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=r5f8kxIyykQC&q=ostrich\">this book</a>, for example). The symbolism is largely what has been mentioned above with regard to the (mistaken) belief that ostrich eggs are hatched through the power of observation... There is also some relationship to the \"Cosmic Egg\"/globe of the world.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of Jewish practice, Simonsohn's book on Jews in Sicily <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=gxUDB-xTL6MC&pg=PA523&dq=ostrich\">records</a> that ostrich eggs were stolen from the synagogue there in 1492 (he then, mistakenly, suggests that this is a uniquely Sicilian custom), and <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?ei=drwAUaPPKYag2QXz7IDYAg&id=E3gWAQAAIAAJ&dq=ostrich\">this source</a> tantalizingly records that a Jew in Bulgaria (?) in 1578 explained to someone (?) that they hang ostrich eggs in synagogue to remind the shelihei tzibbur to think of nothing else but prayer, just as the ostrich does not turn its sight away form its eggs until they are hatched. Yaron Ben-Naeh's book on Jews in Ottoman Turkey <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=xWZ4qCzJKasC&pg=PA231&dq=ostrich\">records</a> that  ostrich eggs were hung in synagogues there as a symbol of Divine Providence. Tudor Parfitt's book on Jews in 20th century Yemen <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=S-nu8Z6yNIMC&pg=PA47&dq=ostrich\">documents</a> ostrich eggs in the synagogue there, while Harvey Goldberg <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=mvKYBUrV9VwC&pg=PA64&dq=ostrich\">notes</a> that in Yemen, ostrich eggs also were part of the ceremonial decoration of a birthing mother's room (with a reconstructed picture, on the next page).</p>\n\n<p>I would imagine that it was discontinued for social factors, largely that we don't decorate our synagogues in the same way that they did in the \"Old World\" and that an ostrich egg (especially since it holds little symbolism in most people's minds) would seem out-of-place, if not disrespectful. Although I am all for reviving the minhag!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Etz Chaim Synagogue in Chania, Crete has ostrich eggs hanging from its main chandelier (can be seen <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eLf-6YQ6Kmk/WPZL1Ikb2LI/AAAAAAAAjGo/Cpo3rhf26vIXWHHkOI-4PRtTmDXnW2raACLcB/s1600/IMG_20170410_134458.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I have seen this in the Syrian Ades עדס shul in Nachla'aot, Jersusalem.

And there's no room to permit this based on the fact that as it comes out there's still a salt-and-rice mixture left in the shaker (as the Taz permits at the end of Siman 319 to remove a fly with a small amount of liquid) because here, regarding Sifting, the Taz doesn't apply because Sifting is different such that during sifting some of the mixture is left until the end and [one who does it] is still chayav. <br/>... <br/>\nAnd I saw in Sefer Hilchos Shabbos from R' Shimon Eider (Meraked note 103) that he heard similarly from R' Aharon Kotler that it's assur and that he also heard the same from R' Moshe Feinstein. And the Shemiras Shabbos K'hilchasah (perek 3 note 179) in the name of R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach similarly forbids it \"even though there's a lot of salt, because it's like Borer with a sieve which is assur even with a small amount.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rashi explains that because Yair\n  had no children, he named the villages after himself to memorialize\n  his name.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Torah continues and recounts that Novach captured K’nas and its\n  suburbs and renamed them Novach in his name. Why isn’t the expression\n  “in his name” also used in conjunction with Yair naming his villages\n  Chavos-Yair? We even find later (Devorim 3:14) that Moshe mentioned\n  that Yair called the cities על שמו – after his name.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Silver answered that because Novach gave his exact name to his\n  conquered territory, the Torah says that he called them “in his name.”\n  Yair, on the other hand, added an additional name in calling his\n  villages not “Yair” but “Chavos-Yair.” Moshe considered this a\n  memorial to Yair’s name, but the additional name makes it a new name\n  which can’t be considered “in his name.” As a result, the names\n  Yitzchok Aizik and Avrohom Yitzchok, each of which contains an\n  additional name, are considered two different names and may be used by\n  a father and son!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps in this case, the woman should name the son Shimon with another name to avoid the issue. Alternatively, if the husband already has a middle name, she can name the son just Shimon.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I finally found the Sefer Lulei Toratcha stories with Rav Shach on the parsha.Parshas Matos 30:4.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shach answered that she should name the child Shmayah since it is similar to the name Shimon and in this way she can be miskayim the neder a little bit.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Zamir Kohen (founder of \"Hidabroot\" in Israel) states in his book \"Sefer HaTzofen\" (\"The Code Book\") that Yemenites are accustomed to name their children after themselves (e.g. Yosef ben Yosef) and that there is no technically Halakhic restriction in doing so.</p>\n\n<p>It would appear that avoiding doing so is a matter of custom and not Halakhah. Therefore, the OP could either consult a Rav as regards the name \"Shime'on ben Shime'on\" or annulling such a vow. Good luck!</p>\n\n\n",

Bleich's conclusion from his <a href=\"http://www.traditiononline.org/news/article.cfm?id=104957\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Survey of Recent Halakhic Periodical Literature</a>. I have inserted the sources that he mentioned throughout the survey in brackets. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The silk screen method is certainly subject to challenge on the basis of its inherent incompatibility with a number of considerations: </p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>The position of <strong>Bah [O''H 32:15]</strong>, who maintains that each word must be vocalized before writing even when there is no chance of scribal\n  error;</li>\n  <li>The view of the authorities who maintain that each word must be copied from an existing text and that an error-free “master text” is\n  not sufficient for this purpose <strong>[Bnei Yonah no. 271, Pilpul Arukh, p.\n  14a; Piskei Uzi'el, no. 31]</strong></li>\n  <li><p>The view of the authorities who maintain that multiple Divine Names cannot be sanctified even simultaneously <strong>[Bnei Yonah 276:2; Divrei\n  Hamudot, Halakhot Ketanot, Hilkhot Sefer Torah 4:11; Ma’adanei Tom\n  Tov, Halakhot Ketanot, Hilkhot Sefer Torah 4:5; Eliyahu Rabbah 32:36;\n  Teshuvot Bet Shlomoh, Yoreh De’ah, II, no. 163; Teshuvot Dvar Shmu’el,\n  no. 76; Melekhet Shamayim, no. 5; Birkei Yosef Yoreh De’ah 276:3; Bet\n  Aharon, no. 12; Teshuvot Maharam Shik, Yoreh De’ah, no. 276; Kol\n  Ya’akov, Yoreh De’ah 274:4; R. Yitzchak Dov Bamberger, Melekhet\n  Shamayim, Binah 9:3; and Hazon Ish, Orah Hayyim 6:13, Yehaveh Da'at,\n  VI, no. 57; ; Teshuvot Helek Levi O''H, no. 26]</strong></p></li>\n  <li><p><strong>Iggeret Mosheh’s view [O''H, IV, no. 40 sec. 10]</strong> that any method in which <em>sirtut</em> serves no purpose is disqualified; </p></li>\n  <li>The view of <strong>Teshuvot Zera Avraham [Y''D 117], She’ilat David [no. 7 sec. 2], Da’at Kohen [no. 160] and Piskei Uzi’el [no. 31]</strong> that the\n  printing press is not acceptable because “it is not in the manner o f\n  writing.” </li>\n  <li><p>The kabbalistic view expressed by <strong>Ari [Bnei Yonah, Pilpul Arukh, no. 271, p. 15a]</strong> regarding the particular form of writing that governs\n  the manner in which the writing of each letter is begun.</p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, a competent rabbinic decisor might, with justification, conclude that those are minority views and consequently rely upon the weight of authority in ignoring such concerns. The crucial consideration is whether or not the silk screen method\n  constitutes either “spilling” or “dripping” and hence is ruled invalid\n  by the <strong>Palestinian Talmud [Gittin 2:3 and Shabbat 12:4]</strong>. Since the\n  validity of Torah scrolls, tefillin and mezuzot is a matter of\n  biblical law, any doubt, if the there is indeed such doubt, must be\n  resolved in the negative. Thus, it would be necessary either to adduce\n  strong precedent in support of the validity of a method similar to the\n  silk screen process or to advance a compelling logical distinction\n  between that method and the processes described by the Palestinian\n  Talmud. In this writers opinion, the requisite demonstration has not\n  been forthcoming.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In addition, R. Bleich notes the reaction of contemporary rabbinic authorities, who have overwhelmingly prohibited the silk screen method and noted that Torah scrolls and ST'aM that were silk screened are unfit for use. In the form of letters signed and occasional responsa released, which were published in Yated Ne’eman, 24 Kislev 5763; 16 Kislev 5763; Yated Ne’eman, Parashat Mikez 5763, and an earlier letter dated Tammuz 5762.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The signatories prohibiting silk screen include</strong>: R. Ovadia Yosef, R. Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, R Samuel ha-Levi Woszner, R. Nissim Karelitz, the members of the Bet Din of Jerusalem’s Edah ha-Haredit, R. Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg, and R Menachem Yehudah ha-Levi Gross [who wrote a detailed analysis explaining the prohibition in the Tammuz 5762 issue of <em>Or Torah</em>]. You can read a translation R. Wosner's letter <a href=\"http://frumscams.blogspot.co.il/2013/05/bogus-mezuzos-tefilin-and-sifrei-torah.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Besides R. Abadi's responsum <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1525&st=&pgnum=359&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">[Or Yizhak, no. 53]</a>, the only published source that somewhat defends the silk screening process is an anonymous pamphlet called <em>Ha-Emet ve-ha-Shalom Ahevu</em>, who ultimately concedes that it shouldn't be done as R. Eliashiv has ruled against it.</p>\n\n<h2>UPDATE:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kashrut.org/forum/viewpost.asp?mid=5527\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Abadi has responded</a> to the letters of Gedolim who prohibited silk screening, arguing that they didn't see the process, and claims that \"Rav Scheinberg, Rav Tuvia Goldstein ZT\"L who both saw the process and Rav Dovid Feinstein, who did not see it, among \"others\", said it is Kosher.\" <a href=\"http://www.kashrut.org/forum/viewpost.asp?mid=5439\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Abadi has also responded to R. Bleich's survey</a>, in which he commends the thorough treatment and respect in the article. He notes that the \"crucial consideration\" of spilling does not happen in silk screening, and invites anyone to see the process to prove his case. </p>\n\n<p>Since R. Bleich's article (published in 2003), several responsa have come out. As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/17925/1865\">sam pointed out</a>, R. Belsky has prohibited the practice in his <em>Sha'alos U'Teshuvos Shulchan Halevi</em>. R. Ovadia has also written about the grave sin of the silk screen method in <em>Chazon Ovadia Purim</em> (רנה), saying that nobody who uses a Torah scroll or ST'aM that was silk screened fulfills any mitzvah. The newest <strong>Yalkut Yosef, in 691:15</strong>, cites <em>Chazon Ovadia</em> in prohibiting the practice, adding that not only are they <em>passul b'dieved</em>, but also:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והמברכים עליהם ברכתם ברכה לבטלה, והוא מכשול חמור מאד, שמכשיל את הרבים באיסור ברכה לבטלה ובביטול מצות מקרא מגילה.</p>\n  \n  <p>One who blesses on them [megillah] has said a blessing in vain, and this is a very serious stumbling block, thwarting the public through the prohibition of saying a blessing in vain and wasting the mitzvah of reading the megillah. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._David_Bleich\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. J.D.

In the article he discusses a number of possible issues that have been raised with Silk-screen Sifrei Torah, but says that most of them are not so strong. He says there is one serious objection where the burden of proof falls on the innovators to show that it is OK:</p>\n\n<p>The issue is the halacha in the gemara that says that the ink cannot be spilled or dripped. When the ink is pressed by a scribe, is that considered spilling/dripping and therefore is passul?</p>\n\n<p>P.S.\nA video of the process is available on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvFED55xhv8\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube</a>. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Rav Belsky, on page 9 of <em>Shulchan Halevi</em> (English version), explains that while theoretically silk-screening could be kosher for writing Stam, there are some issues which can come up. He mentions that forgeries would increase, and there there could be a problem of kesidran (\"written in order,\" which Teffilin and Mezuzah require).</p>\n\n<p>Then he brings an issue with sirtut (line indents under the letters to help guide the sofer to keep the letters in a straight line) - that Mezuzah needs it,  and even according to many shittos a sefer Torah needs it. It could be a problem  according to Rabbi Akiva Eiger in <em>Shailos and Tshuvos</em> Siman 50.</p>\n\n<p>He ends with the famous idea \"chadasha assur min HaTorah\" (anything new is forbidden). To revolutionize the way a mitzvah is to be performed or prepared, the initiative has to come from the Gedolei Hador, not from any single individual.</p>\n\n<p>It is best to see it inside since I did not fully elaborate on the topic.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Eating after Kiddush Friday Night without Motzi?",
    "content": "# Eating after Kiddush Friday Night without Motzi?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In many synagogues, it is common to have an informal food gathering after services on Shabbat morning. This is very rarely, if ever, done Friday night. On Shabbat morning the way it's done is usually to have one person make Kiddush for everyone, and then everyone eats, although generally there is no Motzi made and no bread served. Some are careful to eat Mezonot so that the Kiddush has a Makom Seudah status. There are instances when this is done, along the same lines, at home.</p>\n\n<p>Can one eat after Kiddush <em>Friday night</em> along the same lines? If not, why is it different?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The rules of eating a meal in the same place one made or heard <em>kidush</em> are written among the rules of Friday night's <em>kidush</em> (and applied to both). Thus, the rule (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&pgnum=107\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Mishna B'rura</em> 273:25</a>) that cake suffices for this (so one need not immediately eat bread) applies to the nighttime as well as the daytime <em>kidush</em>. (However, even if he is famished during the day and cannot eat cake or the like so eats fruit, he can't do so at night: cake or the like is required at night. <em>MB</em> 273:26.)</p>\n\n<p>Why, then, don't people do this in synagogues? I suspect it's practical considerations: women aren't there (in many synagogues, and, in any event, traditionally haven't been there, and old habits die hard), so it's unusual to make a celebration in the synagogue, for the community, Friday night. Moreover, people with children want to go home before the children need to go to sleep. And similar considerations.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, there are two specific reasons to have a <em>kidush</em> with no bread in the morning that don't apply at night. One is that (in many synagogues) the prayers end before lunchtime in the morning, and people want to eat something light. The second is a specific custom (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14556&pgnum=153\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Taame Haminhagim</em>, asterisked footnote to 299</a>) to eat \"four meals\" (the second of which requires no bread) on <em>Shabas</em>, so that some people deliberately (even at home) eat something light and take a break before lunch even if it is already lunchtime.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Although <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/17926/14850\">msh210's answer</a> would appear to reflect the opinion of Mishnah Berurah which does not differentiate between <em>kiddush</em> at night or during the day, there are opinions that argue and would limit the permission to follow <em>kiddush</em> with cake instead of bread to only the daytime <em>kiddush</em> (at least ideally).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Ganzfried\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Shlomo Ganzfried</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.77.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 77:14</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאִם לֹא אָכַל מִיָּד לְאַחַר הַקִּדּוּשׁ, לֹא יָצָא יְדֵי קִדּוּשׁ. <strong>וּבַיּוֹם</strong> אַף שֶׁאֵינוֹ רוֹצֶה לֶאֱכוֹל מִיָּד סְעוּדָּה קְבוּעָה, יָכוֹל לְקַדֵּשׁ וְלֶאֱכוֹל קְצָת פַּת כִּיסָנִין, וְאָז צָרִיךְ לִשְׁתּוֹת מִן הַכּוֹס רְבִיעִית.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>And if one did not eat immediately after <em>kiddush</em>, he did not fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>kiddush</em>. <strong>By day</strong>, even if he does not want to eat a formal meal immediately, he can recite the <em>kiddush</em>, and eat some cake, but then he must drink a <em>revi'it</em> [of wine] from the cup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchak_Elchanan_Spektor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1303&st=&pgnum=39\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ein Yitzchak 12:11</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לכתחלה יחוש להחמיר לאכול תיכף לחם אחר הקידוש של לילה אכן בקידוש היום יש להקל ולסמוך על מיני תרגימא או כוס יין שני</p>\n  \n  <p>Ideally, one should be concerned for the stringent opinion and eat bread immediately following the nighttime <em>kiddush</em>. However, at the daytime <em>kiddush</em>, one can be lenient and rely on <em>mezonot</em> or a second cup of wine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reasoning behind this approach is summarized nicely in <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/6206\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although the <em>Magen Avraham</em> did not distinguish between the Friday Night and Shabbos Day <em>Kiddush</em>, and held that his ruling [i.e. that <em>mezonot</em> suffices for the meal following <em>kiddush</em> - JoelK] should apply equally, on the other hand, Rav Yitzchok Elchanan Spektor, the Kovno Rav and <em>Gadol Hador</em> of the late 1800s, did. He explained that on Shabbos Day, when <em>Kiddush</em> is only mandated <em>derabbanan</em>, one may certainly rely on <em>Mezonos</em> as a <em>Seudah</em>. Yet, on Friday night, when <em>Kiddush</em> is an actual <em>chiyuv d’oraysa</em>, due to the strength of the opposition to the <em>Magen Avraham</em>’s approach, he maintains that one should not rely on mere <em>Mezonos</em>, but should ensure that <em>Kiddush</em> is recited along with an entire bread-based <em>Seudah</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is why one does not often see a Friday night <em>Kiddush</em> being performed with <em>Mezonos</em> instead of <em>Hamotzi</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Invitation to nonkosher restaurant\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8794\">The question \"Keeping Kosher at a secular company\"</a> asks about food issues on the job in general.  This question is focused more narrowly on \"unbalanced\" situations: situations where there's an imbalance of power.</p>\n\n<p>A junior employee, such as an intern, works at a large company where the senior management sometimes invites junior employees to lunch.  Such meetings are primarily of benefit to the invitees, who can gain valuable advice and networking opportunities as they start their careers.</p>\n\n<p>How should the employee in this situation respond if the invitation is to a non-kosher restaurant?  On the one hand, the lunch offers an opportunity and it seems impolite to decline a higher-up like a company president.  On the other hand, it also seems impolite to sit in the restaurant and not order anything, and this may make a bad impression on those present.   I know there may also be the issue of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/7459/5\">maras ayin</a> from going into and/or eating in the restaurant.</p>\n\n<p>What is the best way to handle this situation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>You don't need to jump straight to declining the invitation.  There might be things you can eat, and even if not you won't be impolite to the restaurant by joining a paying group.  The key is to communicate clearly.  You can explain to the person who invited you -- or, more likely, his administrative assistant -- that you would be delighted to come to the lunch but will be unable to eat due to dietary restrictions.  Then go anyway; it's the meeting that's important, not the food.</p>\n\n<p>There might be things you can eat and drink there -- cold drinks are usually safe, for instance, and some salads might be.  Consult your rabbi for specific advice.  The restaurant might also permit you to bring your own food (and dish/cutlery) if you arrange it in advance.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a close connection to the administrative assistant, you might be able to propose a different, kosher restaurant.  But that would be more risky in an unbalanced power structure where you don't know the admin either.</p>\n\n<p>You're right to be concerned about marit ayin.  There are several factors that could affect this and you should discuss them with your rabbi:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The extent to which this is a career-relevant meeting</p></li>\n<li><p>Whether there are easy kosher alternatives (if not it might not be as bad)</p></li>\n<li><p>What the prevailing practices/norms in the community are</p></li>\n<li><p>How visible you'll be (it's even possible that a Jew visibly having only a glass of water is not only not negative but positive, depending on circumstances)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ohr Somayach's Ask The Rabbi service tackled a <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/ask_the_rabbi/ask_the_rabbi/4439\" rel=\"noreferrer\">related question</a> and points to the book <i>After the Return</i> by Rabbi Mordechai Becher and Rabbi Moshe Newman.  (I've read it but don't remember the details of what it said on this question.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -12)\n\n<p>I mostly agree with the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/17947/1059\">Monica Cellio</a>. Marit ayin should never a problem; see my answer to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/16108/1059\">this question</a>. For the sake of kavod haberiyot, you may eat things that are non-kosher rabbinically (but not biblically treyf), if it would please your employers and co-workers. But that is prohibited if they would not get any <em>hana'ah</em> (benefit) from eating together with you, or if you want to be strict personally (but that is beyond what the halakhah requires). This is based on the principle suggested by the Gemara in Perek Gimel (?) of Masechet Brachos that says kavod habriyos is docheh (pushes off) <em>Lo Sasur</em>. However, there is probably food that you can eat that is even kosher rabinically. Either way, you could always order a diet coke, which is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">advice</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posek\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">suggested</a> by <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ME0ecw\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Charlie Harary</a> in this shiur/Q&A entitled <strong><a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/773134/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Preparing for the Workforce: A Candid Discussion about the Unique Challenges and Opportunities a Committed Jew Encounters in the Workplace</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n",

However, the actual question was only addressing nose surgery. I would like to to know: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>If there are any modern (no older than 10 years) teshuvot regarding cosmetic surgery. Most of the teshuvot quoted in the aforementioned question are nearly 50 years old. Societal demands and medical dangers involved have certainly changed. </p></li>\n<li><p>Is there a differentiation between cosmetic surgery to \"fix\" something (ie shorten a nose) as opposed to augmenting something that is not necessarily \"broken\" (ie breast implants).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3982150,00.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article from Yeshiva Net News</a> says plastic surgery of all types is becoming increasingly accepted in the Israeli Haredi community, and quotes one case of a woman who was given an allowance by her rabbi to have augmentative surgery as her appearance was causing marital strife.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/14-17%20Cosmetic%20Surgery%20-%20A%20Review%20of%20Four%20Classic%20Teshuvot%201.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Jachter discusses more about the theory behind halacha and plastic surgery  here.</a> </p>\n\n<p>A major concern is when are we fixing/healing the broken -- vs. when are we expecting something entirely unnatural? Did the bride's appearance upset her husband's expectations because she was deformed, or because she wasn't photoshopped? I discussed this with Rabbi Michael Broyde, who pretty much said it depends on the case and the severity of the issue, as judged by a really competent rabbi. (\"People ask me about giving their children growth-hormone injections ... nu I'm only five-foot-something, but I wish I was six-eight and able to play for the Dallas Cowboys -- well tough luck. If the child will never get beyond four feet and this will seriously affect their social development, that's another story.\")</p>\n\n\n",

The biblical text in Lev 22:32 uses the word \"midst\" when referring to how (in what context) God is to be sanctified and Num 16:21 uses the same word \"midst\" but says that things happen in the midst of a \"congregation.\" The word \"congregation\" is also used to describe the collection of 10 spies Num 14:27 who reported back against the land of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Thus the Talmud deduces that 10 is a congregation, and 10 is the number in which god is sanctified -- which is connected to that specific selection of prayers.</p>\n\n<p>The wiki page has much more and spells out the connections more fully.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are three aspects to your question:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Where do we learn that it is necessary to pray in a minyan (\"quorum\")?</li>\n<li>How do we know that the number of people in a minyan is ten?</li>\n<li>From where do we derive the features of these people (age, gender, etc)?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To take these questions in order, the oldest source that testifies to the requirement for praying in a quorum is the mishna in Megillah 4:3. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין פורסין על שמע, ואין עוברין לפני התבה, ואין נושאין את כפיהם, ואין\nקורין בתורה, ואין מפטירין בנביא, ואין עושין מעמד ומושב, ואין אומרים\nברכת אבלים ותנחומי אבלים וברכת חתנים, ואין מזמנים בשם - פחות מעשרה.\nובקרקעות - תשעה וכהן, ואדם כיוצא בהן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not everything in the above mishna is easily understood. The following is my own rough translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One may not recite the Shema' responsively with its blessings¹, nor\nmay one go before the ark [to lead the congregation - Rav Ovadiah of\nB.], nor [may the kohanim] raise their hands, nor may one read from\nthe Torah, nor read the haftorah from the Prophets, nor do the\nstanding and sitting², nor may one recite the blessing of mourners,\nthe consolation of mourners nor the blessing of the bridegroom, nor\ninvite [others at the meal to recite <i>birkat hammazon</i>] with the\nname [of God: \"נברך לא_להינו\"] - with fewer than ten people. Likewise,\nwhen it comes to [redeeming consecrated] land: nine people and the\nkohen [cf: Leviticus 27:14ff]. When it comes to [assessing the value\nof] a person, this is as before [ie: nine people and a kohen - cf:\nLeviticus 27:2-8].</p>\n<p><b>¹</b> Acc. to the Ran, in the name of the Geonim, and to the Rambam,\n<i>Hilkhot Tefillah</i> 8:5.</p>\n<p><b>²</b> Acc. to all authorities, this was a mourning practice that is no\nlonger in effect. There is some debate, however, as to when it\noccurred and how, but it is also mentioned in Ketubot 2:10, Bava Batra\n6:7 and Ohalot 18:4.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is nothing within this source that can tell us what the origins of this practice were, nor anything that might further delimit the identities of the ten people involved. For sociological explanations that account for the need to pray within a community, see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Eric M. Meyers, \"Jewish Culture in Greco-Roman Palestine\" in <i>Cultures of the Jews: A New History</i> (ed. David Biale; New York: Schocken Books, 2002), 135-179;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Shaye Cohen, <i>The Beginnings of Jewishness: Boundaries, Varieties, Uncertainties</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999),58-59;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Lee Levine, <i>The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years</i> (2nd ed; Yale University Press, 2005), 135ff.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In an attempt to explain the origins of this law, the rabbis suggested that its roots lay in Leviticus 22:32 - ונקדשתי בתוך בני ישראל, \"that I may be sanctified in the midst of the Israelites\". But if sanctification in the people's midst is the source of this principle, from where is the number of people who are involved derived?</p>\n<p>In Megillah 23b of the Babylonian Talmud, the following midrash is presented:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מנא הני מילי? אמר רבי חייא בר אבא אמר רבי יוחנן: דאמר קרא \"ונקדשתי\nבתוך בני ישראל\" - כל דבר שבקדושה לא יהא פחות מעשרה. מאי משמע? דתני רבי\nחייא: אתיא \"תוך\" \"תוך\". כתיב הכא \"ונקדשתי בתוך בני ישראל\" וכתיב התם\n\"הבדלו מתוך העדה\". ואתיא \"עדה\" \"עדה\". דכתיב התם \"עד מתי לעדה הרעה\nהזאת\". מה להלן עשרה אף כאן עשרה</p>\n<p>From where are these matters [discussed in the mishna above] derived?</p>\n<p>Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba says in the name of Rabbi Yohanan: since the\nverse says, \"that I may be sanctified in the midst of the Israelites\"\n[Leviticus 22:32], nothing that has sanctity can be with fewer than\nten people.</p>\n<p>How do we know this? Rabbi Hiyya taught: [the word] \"midst\"\n(תוך) appears twice. It says here, \"that I may be sanctified in the <b>midst</b> of the Israelites\" and it says there, \"separate\nyourselves from the <b>midst</b> of this congregation\" [Numbers\n16:21]. [Also, the word] \"congregation\" (עדה) appears twice. [It says\nhere, \"separate yourselves from the midst of this <b>congregation</b>\"\nand] it says there, \"How much longer [must I tolerate] this wicked\n<b>congregation</b>...\" [Numbers 14:27]. Just as there [with the\nspies] it was ten, so too here [in Leviticus 22:32] it is ten.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This style of argument, employed by Rabbi Hiyya in the gemara, is known as a <i>gezeira shavah</i>: literally \"an equal decree\", it constitutes a textual analogy made on the basis of the reappearance of a key word, regardless of context. It can be found within Hillel's seven principles (Yerushalmi, Pesachim 6.1), Ishmael's thirteen principles (Sifra, intro.) and Rabbi Eliezer's thirty-two principles (Midrash Agur). Like so many other passages in which this principle is employed, the foregoing midrash is an <i>asmakhta'</i>: an attempt at grounding a rabbinic practice within scripture, though not representative of how that practice was originally derived.</p>\n<p>You will have noted that none of the above sources specify any details as regards the identities of the congregants.

A secular Jew approaches an Orthodox colleague and laments the \"Radical Christian\" theology that believes in \"hocus pocus\", saying that, even though he's not religious, he can respect his Orthodox colleague's lifestyle because, \"at least Orthodox Judaism doesn't believe in resurrection or a physical/literal afterlife.\" May the Orthodox colleague engage the secular Jew in a discussion of Perek Helek and the divergence of opinions between Rambam and Ramban, et al?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Rambam in his commentary on the mishneh in Avos (2:14) writes that the idea of answering the apikoros applies only to non-Jewish apikoros, but a Jewish apikoros is so much worse in terms of disparaging and disgracing (the Torah), that it is not appropriate to argue with him at all, since he is beyond repair and beyond healing.</p>\n\n<p>[יג] אמר: למד דברים שתשיב בהם על האפיקורוסים מן האומות, ותתווכח עמהם ותענה להם אם יקשו לך. ואמרו: \"לא שנו אלא אפיקורוס גוי, אבל ישראל כל שכן דפקר\", רצונו לומר: שהוא יוסיף זלזול ולגלוג, ולפיכך אין ראוי לדון עמו כלל, לפי שהוא לא יתוקן, ואין לו רפואה כלל, \"כל באיה לא ישובון ולא י(ס)[ש]יגו אורחות חיים\" +משלי ב יט+. ואמר, ועם היותך לומד דעות האומות כדי שתדע איך תשיב עליהם, היזהר שלא ידבק בדעתך דבר מזה, ודע כי אשר תעבוד לפניו ידע צפונותיך, והוא אומרו: ודע לפני מי אתה עמל.</p>\n\n<p>The source of the Rambam is the gemara in Sanhedrin 38b. But, see Rashi there</p>\n\n<p>כל שכן דפקר טפי. שהרי הכיר וכפר ומתוך כך מדקדק ולא תוכל להשיבו דבר \nהמקובל לו </p>\n\n<p>who indicates that the reason the Jew is in a worse condition is that he knew originally and then denied. So perhaps this wouldn't apply to a Jew who didn't deny in any intellectual fashion.</p>\n\n\n",

However, Eretz Tzvi pt. 2 Shabbas 29 says (based on Targum Yonasan 20:5) that since you are putting a mezuzah up, which can't be done without a house, it is appropriate to have a meal even without a place to learn Torah.</p>\n\n<p>None of these sources mention anything about a shehechiyanu.

If you buy a house as a partner, you say \"HaTov VeHaMeitiv\" (MB there), but as an investment or secondary home, it seems as if you make a shehechiyanu.

    "content": "# Grammatical function of Emet te'amim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Emet books (Iyov, Mishlei, Tehillim) have a cantillation system that is not used elsewhere in Tanach. In addition to the use of cantillation marks not found elsewhere (iluy, ole, dehi, geresh muqdam), the marks that are also used elsewhere appear to have different grammatical function when used in the Emet books. For instance, Psalm 1:1 ends with the phrase:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּבְמוֹשַׁ֥ב לַ֝צִ֗ים לֹ֣א יָשָֽׁב׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Normally, the revia' on לַ֝צִ֗ים would be a strong disjunctive, but that makes little sense grammatically in this context. I'm assuming that somehow the geresh muqdam here alters the function of the revia' to be either a weaker disjunctive or a conjunctive.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone point me to a reference that describes the grammatical rules of the te'amim in the Emet books?

But the pasuk is first divided at the etnachta (or alternatively in taamei EMe\"T, sometimes at the oleh veyored). In your pasuk</p>\n<p>אַ֥שְֽׁרֵי הָאִ֗ישׁ    אֲשֶׁ֤ר ׀ לֹ֥א הָלַךְ֮ בַּֽעֲצַ֪ת רְשָׁ֫עִ֥ים\nוּבְדֶ֣רֶךְ חַ֭טָּאִים לֹ֥א עָמָ֑ד    וּבְמוֹשַׁ֥ב לֵ֝צִ֗ים לֹ֣א יָשָֽׁב׃</p>\n<p>, you need to determine whether this is then at the etnachta of עָמָ֑ד or the oleh veyored of רְשָׁ֫עִ֥ים.</p>\n<p>Regardless, there are different trup symbols subdividing a clause ending in etnachta/oleh veyored as opposed to a silluq (what you would call a sof-pasuk). Specifically, the Revia Mugrash is what is used to subdivide a clause ending in silluq, in this case יָשָֽׁב. To cite <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=qbkIAQAAMAAJ&ots=eS5soHxg8X&dq=cantillation%20wickes&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wickes</a>, who indeed uses this very example of the first pasuk in Tehillim:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VfpS2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The image above explains the placement of the etnachta, in the clause between oleah veyored and silluq. Reading a bit further, we see that where the etnachta has already been placed, musically, it cannot be placed again, so the revia mugrash appears in silluq's clause:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UpYPT.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>So in other words, it is indeed a disjunctive, but it not any weaker of a disjunctive that the great revia. Rather, it is the form of revia that appears in the latter half of a pasuk, when subdividing a clause ending in silluq.</p>\n<p>The logical and syntactic causes of such subdivisions can be discovered by reading Wickes' treatise.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The book <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/30700\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shaarei Ne'imah</a> discusses these things.

In\n  the masoretic literature it is called <i>tifha</i>, and it has, in\n  fact, a function similar to that of the <i>tifha</i> in the Twenty-One\n  Books [which he discusses in §231, p190]. It is marked by the\n  <i>revia</i> dot over the stress syllable, with a <i>geresh</i>-like\n  stroke (after which it is named) marked above the beginning of the\n  word (prepositive), as וחטאים (Ps 1:5). If the two words are joined by\n  <i>maqqef</i>, the stroke is marked on the second, as על-ציון (Ps\n  2:6).

In their place he <strong>adds the prohibitions</strong> of waging war against <strong>1) Moav, 2) Ammon, and 3) Eisav</strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> There seems to be a typo in Derech Mitzvosecha, which says the Ramban split mitzvah #247 into two.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> The following mitzvah in Shichchas HaAsin LeDaas HaRambam #6, has the mitzvah of מצות לאכול מן האילנות שבגבולה כל ימי המצור ולא לכרות אותם - To enjoy the fruits of the trees surrounding a city under siege and not to destroy them (<a href=\"//www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.20.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>). The Mishneh LaMelech claims that the Ramban listed it only according to the opinion of the Rambam, who himself should have listed it. However, the Ramban himself doesn't hold it should be included, for the same reason as #24 above. This explains why the Ramban at the conclusion of his Hasagos says there are only 16 mitvos that the Rambam forgot, when he himself listed 17.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> <a href=\"//www.sefaria.org/Hasagot_HaRamban_on_Sefer_HaMitzvot,_Conclusion.2.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">At the end</a> of Ramban's Hasagos, he says that he's unsure if he should list the positive mitzvah for a King or Shofet to ask the Urim VeTumim if the people should go out to war. He says if it shouldn't be counted, then he'll count the mitzvah for a Sage to rule while not intoxicated. He leaves it as an unresolved question, but in his Hasagos to negative mitzvah <a href=\"//www.sefaria.org/Hasagot_HaRamban_on_Sefer_HaMitzvot,_Negative_Commandments.73\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#73</a> he pretty confidently counts the latter as a mitzvah, so I wrote above only that one. However, at the end of the Zohar HaRakiah he writes that we cannot rely on what the Ramban writes in his Hasagos; only on what he writes at the end when he sums up the mitzvos. This is also brought in the sefer Seder Hamitzvos.</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> The Ramban in <a href=\"//www.sefaria.org/Hasagot_HaRamban_on_Sefer_HaMitzvot,_Conclusion.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his summary</a> at the end of his Hasagos writes that <strong>the Rambam is missing seven negative mitzvos</strong>. Apparently he had a different version of Sefer HaMitzvos than we have. The Zohar HaRakiya tries to figure out which were missing, and feels he discovered five. However, Rav Chaim Heller (<a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/1986/1053/820023.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevul HaYovlos pg. 82</a>) disagrees, and feels there was simply a copyist error at fault. He therefore says it's a waste of time trying to figure out which mitzvos were missing from his version. Regardless, the Ramban therefore added 7 more to the 24 he removed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>The list of differences can be found in an <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14092&st=&pgnum=430&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">appendix to the Minchas Chinuch</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Ramban includes all of these positive mitzvos, which the Rambam doesn't</h2>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 1</strong>: Positive mitzvah of eating maaser sheni.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 2</strong>: Positive mitzvah of not eating impure trumah</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 3</strong>: Positive mitzvah of not selling shvi'is fruits</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 4</strong>: Positive mitzvah of settling Eretz Yisrael</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 5</strong>: Positive mitzvah of leaving a way for the enemy to retreat</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 6</strong>: Positive mitzvah to eat fruit trees when sieging a city</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 7</strong>: Positive mitzvah to remember Miriam verbally</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 8</strong>: Positive mitzvah to be wholesome with G-d</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 9</strong>: Positive mitzvah to separate trumah from the best</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 10</strong>: Positive mitzvah for every korban to be one of the three valid species</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 11</strong>: Positive mitzvah to offer all korbanos between the two temidin</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 12</strong>: Positive (?) mitzvah for the Pesach not to be eaten by day</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 13</strong>: Positive mitzvah to kill a killer</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 14</strong>: Positive mitzvah not to benefit from clothing or a house with tzara'as</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 15</strong>: Positive mitzvah to thank G-d</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 16</strong>: Positive mitzvah to keep your brother alive</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 17</strong>: Positive mitzvah to return interest</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Ramban includes all of these negative mitzvos, which the Rambam doesn't</h2>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 1</strong>: Negative mitzvah not to forget belief in G-d</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 2</strong>: Negative mitzvah not to forget the standing at Har Sinai</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 3</strong>: Ngeative mitzvah not to misplace vessels in the beis hamikdash</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 4</strong>: Negative mitzvah not to slaughter kodshim intending to eat them</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 5</strong>: Negative mitzvah not to eat kodshim outside of their place</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 6</strong>: Negative mitzvah not to eat the bird slaughtered for a metzora</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 7</strong>: Negative mitzvah for levi'im not to take trumah</p>\n<p><strong>Mitzvah 8</strong>: Negative mitzvah not to accept shekalim from non-Jews for the purpose of korbanos tzibur</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It is important to note that the Rambam and Ramban agree with each other most of the time that these are obligations, but they disagree about whether they are de'oraisa.</p>\n\n\n",

Huna said: For the reading of Scripture it is necessary to say a benediction, but for the study of the Midrash no benediction is required. R. Eleazar, however, says that for both Scripture and Midrash a benediction is required, but not for the Mishnah. R. Johanan says that for the Mishnah also a benediction is required, [but not for the Talmud]. Raba said: For the Talmud also it is necessary to say a blessing. R. Hiyya b. Ashi said: Many times did I stand before Rab to repeat our section in the Sifra of the School of Rab, and he used first to wash his hands and say a blessing, and then go over our section with us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It strikes me that even if Rav Yosef Karo <strong>did</strong> include midrash within mikra for this halacha, this does not necessarily mean that he agrees that every place Chazal referred to Mikra, Midrash is included. After all, Chazal here took pains to distinguish them. IMHO, one should read the primary sources and determine if such a linguistic identification is compelling.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"http://alfasi.blogspot.com/2005/03/rif-brachot-5b.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Rif</a> brought down this gemara lehalacha, I thought that he had a different girsa, since he omitted reference to midrash until the very end. To cite my translation at my Rif blog:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>{We have a different girsa of the following machloket in our gemara}</p>\n<p>Rav Huna said: For Scripture one must make a blessing. For Mishna and Talmud one need not bless.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yochanan said: For Mishna one must make a blessing; For Talmud one need not bless.</p>\n<p>R Eleazer said: Even for Talmud one must make a blessing.</p>\n<p>Rav said: Even for Midrash one must make a blessing.</p>\n<p>for Rav Chiyya bar Ashi said: many times I stood before Rav to learn the perek in Sifra of the school of Rav, and he first washed his hands and blessed and taught us the perek.</p>\n<p>And Rav Hai Gaon z\"l wrote that the halacha is in accordance with Rav, and the practice is like him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://roshyomi.blogspot.com/2012/08/berachot-11.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh</a>, who is the Tur's father, differs with the Rif and has a girsa like us, but here I will stress that, like us, he has the last statement regarding Sifra as a proof that one blesses for <strong>Gemara</strong>. That is, he puts it like our gemara, but with my added word in bold, to match the ד in the word דאמר, in our gemara and Rosh:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Raba said: For the Talmud also it is necessary to say a blessing. <strong>for</strong> R. Hiyya b. Ashi said: Many times did I stand before Rab to repeat our section in the Sifra of the School of Rab, and he used first to wash his hands and say a blessing, and then go over our section with us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and then the Rosh ends like the Rif:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Rav Hai Gaon z\"l wrote that the halacha is in accordance with Rav, and the practice is like him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the difference between these two girsaot is how to treat Sifra of the school of Rav. Is it midrash, or is it Gemara? And if so, the statement of Rav Hai Gaon (which one should see inside; this might resolve this) might bolster the one position of the other.</p>\n<p>You can read the Tur, son of the Rosh, inside <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43059&st=&pgnum=63\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, nine lines into mem-zayin. He says וצריך לברך למקרא למדרש ולמשנה ולתלמוד. (Slightly irregular vav pattern though, which might indicate some hesitation or tampering...)</p>\n<p>In the commentary of the Beis Yosef to Tur (see link above), on the Tur, he simply states that this is the conclusion based on the gemara in Berachos. So when he omits it in Shulchan Aruch, it stands to reason that he meant to include it as in Beis Yosef. But perhaps not. Which means either (a) typographical error or (b) he thinks that it is implicit somehow in Mikra, as grouped by R' Eleazar, as the Pri Chadash says, or (c) he actually argues and holds like the Rosh, where Midrash is a machlokes and not the focus of Rav Hai Gaon's pesak.</p>\n<p>(I have difficulty with (b) since Rav Yosef Karo surely would assume people would refer to the gemara and know that Midrash was listed separately, and thus deserves address.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/2207n.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> is readable here. He simply says הַמַּשְׁכִּים לִקְרוֹת בַּתּוֹרָה קֹדֶם שֶׁיִּקְרָא קִרְיַת שְׁמַע, בֵּין קָרָא בְּתוֹרָה שֶׁבִּכְתָב בֵּין בְּתוֹרָה שֶׁבְּעַל פֶּה.</p>\n<p>Regardless, no, I don't think one can extrapolate, as discussed above. This does not mean that across all halachot, Mikra == Midrash. Though for some of them, such as people having reached levels of mastery of Torah, probably yes.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch HaRav, in  <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh5/6/2/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Talmud Torah Chapter 2, Halacha 1</a>, it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אך פירוש המקרא ודרשות ההגדות יחשבו בכלל שליש במשנה לפי שהמשנה ג\"כ פירוש התרי\"ג מצות שבתורה‏</p>\n<p>But explanations on the verses, as well as expositions and sayings are considered as \"the third of Mishna\", since the Mishna also explains the 613 Mitzvot in the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Footnote 33 (Almost the entire footnote is added by the editor of the new Kehot re-typeset edition) points out a statement the Baal HaTanya and the Shulchan Aruch made in Likutei Torah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לקו\"ת ויקרא ה, ד. שה\"ש ג, סע\"ג (דהיינו דוקא ספרא וספרי שיש בהם הלכות וגופי תורה, אבל מדרש רבה וכיו\"ב שהן אגדות שעל המקרא אפשר שהן בכלל שליש במקרא, וש\"נ). ‏</p>\n<p>See Likutei Torah <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/lkutey/4/5d.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 5, column 4</a> and <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/lkutey/40/3c.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir HaShirim 3, end of column 3</a> ([Which says] this refers specifically to Halachic Midrash, such as the Sifra or Sifrei, but Midrash Rabbah and the like which are Agadot on the verse, it is possible that they are included in \"the third of verses\", see there for sources).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the sources in Likutei Torah Vayikra is Rashi's explanation of <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=11b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 11B</a>: According to R' Elazar, why must one bless before learning Midrash because they are \"close to Mikra...since they expound verses.\" [Even though R' Elazar would say that one only need bless before learing Mikra]</p>\n<p>[Note that the discussion in the Shulchan Aruch HaRav is which branch of learning does Midrash fall under, and the discussion in the Talmud is if that learning requires a blessing]</p>\n<p>I didn't really check out the other sources brought in Likutei Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

In the end, 10 men were selected to kill all the others, and one of them was selected to kill the 9 remaining men and ultimately kill himself at the end of it all. </p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, they were likely trying to prevent torture, murder, rape and pillage from befalling themselves at the hands of the Romans.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, who could say for certain that the Romans would have done that to them? Furthermore, if they had negotiated a peaceful surrender (especially if they hadn't first engaged in attacks but truly acted as though their retreat to Masada was for purposes of refuge from the war rather than a military strategy) they likely would have been taken as captives and perhaps enslaved but not specifically tortured or killed.</p>\n\n<p>Much ink has been spilled on the subject of martyrdom (LeHavdil from the oceans of blood that has been spilled in actual martyrdom). What can be inferred, from that literature, regarding the specific case of Masada (assuming the story as generally understood, as summarized above, is what actually transpired)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://torahmusings.com/2012/07/josephus-and-the-sages/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hirhurim</a> quotes R' J.B. Soleveitchik regarding an earlier event similar to Masada where Josephus' army committed suicide rather than surrender. Josephus, however, survived, surrendered and became a Roman citizen:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would not say that Josephus lacked the courage to commit suicide. From a halakhic point of view, Josephus may not have been permitted to do so. The Midrash clearly says (Bereshit Rabba 34:13) that committing suicide is an act of murder. The case of King Saul causing himself to be killed is explained by some as an exception to this prohibition because Saul realized that the enemy would kill him imminently in any event. Therefore, if Josephus realized that he was not in imminent danger of being killed by the Romans, he would not have been halakhically permitted to kill himself. Nonetheless, one could argue that even though halakha may not have required Josephus to commit suicide, under halakha, one <strong>may</strong> commit suicide to avoid surrendering to the enemy. If so, such discretion would have been available to Josephus as well. In summary, I am not certain that Josephus committed an act of betrayal. He may have been acting in accordance with the prohibition against suicide.</p>\n<p>It is interesting that Josephus is not mentioned at all in the Gemara, although Rashi does refer to him (Bava Batra 3b, s.v., hekhi). Our sages make no mention of the incident despite their extensive discussion of the events of the Second Temple period. It is hard to know what the attitude of our sages was, but I suspect that while they disapproved of what Josephus did, they felt that they did not have the right to condemn him. As a result, they ignored him. The Gemara would have mentioned him if it considered him a traitor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Okay there are two aspects to the Masadists' actions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Fighting a war when it was absolutely clear they stood no chance of winning. On this, I heard Rabbi Hershel Schachter state that the actions of the Masadists were \"shelo birtzon chachamim\" -- against the wishes of the Sages -- hence purposely omitted from the Talmud. You only fight a war that you stand some chance of winning.</p></li>\n<li><p>Committing suicide rather than surrendering. If they felt that they would have been forced into committing all sorts of terrible sins had they been captured, then the halachic literature does address this.  But my impression is the Masadists' actions were more a result of an absolutist, better-dead-than-give-up-at-all approach, rather than halachic reasoning. Anyhow, there's a really, really depressing elegy on Tisha B'av about a town killing themselves rather than being forced by Crusaders to convert; the propriety of this was debated within Tosfos -- in one story, a rabbi who had encouraged mass suicide lived to see the threat dissipate -- and to carry the burden of his decision for the rest of his life. Similar questions came up in the Holocaust, though \"I'd rather the child die now rather than be forced into Christianity\" is different than \"I'd rather the child die now rather than be killed by the Nazis.\"</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'll add some more perspectives to the answers already given here.</p>\n<p>I've found that a few people have discussed the matter from a halachic perspective:</p>\n<p>Rabbi Shlomo Goren wrote an essay on the subject, called \"The Heroism of Metzada in Light of the Halacha\". The essay appeared in a few places, including his book Torat Hashabbat V'hamo'ed, pg. 391-404. In the essay, he wished to compare the case of Metzada with the death of Shaul in battle. He explains that there's a midrash that shows that what Shaul did (committing suicide in battle) was acceptable per halacha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"שמואל נתנבא בחייו ולאחר מיתתו שאמר שמואל לשאול אם אתה שומע לעצתי ליפול בחרב תהא מיתתך כפרה עליך ויהא גורלך עמי במקום שאני שרוי שם, ושמע שאול לעצתו ונהרג הוא ובניו עמו שיהא חלקו עם שמואל הנביא שנאמר עמי עמי במחיצתי.\"</p>\n<p>\"Shmuel prophesied during his life and after his death, as Shmuel said to Shaul: If you listen to my advice to fall by the sword, your death will be an atonement for your and your lot will be with me in the place that I dwell at, and Shaul took his advice and he was killed and his sons with him, for his lot to be with Shmuel the Prophet as it says \"with me\", with me - near me.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.141.1?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on Nach 141:1</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He interprets this midrash to mean that it was none other than Shmuel himself who told Shaul that he should die by falling upon his own sword. Rabbi Goren continues and brings other midrashic sources that show that Shaul's death was considered heroic and not sinful: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereishit_Rabbah.34.13?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbah 34:13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.78b.19?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 78b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.17.13?vhe=Pirkei_Derabi_Eliezer&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer 17:13</a>. He continues on with later poskim, some agreeing with Shaul did and others not. He then brings the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosafot_on_Avodah_Zarah.18a.11.2?vhe=WikiSource_Tosafot&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfot on Avodah Zara 18a</a> that says that if there's a fear that non-Jewish captors will torture those captured, then it's permissible to commit suicide and it's considered a kiddush Hashem. Rabbi Goren continues on, but eventually concludes that as there was a fear among the people of Metzada of being tortured, as evident from Elazar ben Yair's speech, it was incumbent upon them to die a heroic death rather than be captured.</p>\n<p>Two people (that I'm aware of) wrote critical replies to Rabbi Goren's conclusion:</p>\n<p>The first, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A1_%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7_%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Rabinowitz</a>, wrote an essay called \"The Suicide of the Zealots in Metzada\", Sinai 55, pg. 329-332. He points out two things: a. While when there's a fear of torture, it may be permissible to commit suicide, Elazar ben Yair himself announces that the zealots do not fear torture and death, so that wasn't their reasoning for commiting suicide, nor can that be used as a heter for their actions. b. That though what the zealots did in Metzada was per halacha, it wasn't per <em>our</em> halacha. Rather, it was per the halacha of the zealot sect, which, according to Josephus, had branched off from the Pharisees decades, over a century before the destruction of the Temple (<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link182HCH0001\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Antiquities 18:1:1</a>) and they differed in philosophy from the Pharisees. In what way? Josephus says that they differed on only one point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"These men agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions; but they have an inviolable attachment to liberty, and say that God is to be their only Ruler and Lord. They also do not value dying any kinds of death, nor indeed do they heed the deaths of their relations and friends, nor can any such fear make them call any man lord.\" (ibid. 1:4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, when Elazar ben Yair spoke to his men about not being forced into servitude by the Romans, for they have only one master - Hashem - he was simply expressing the zealot philosophy as put forth by the founder of the zealots, Yehudah the Galilean. The zealots believed that it was a sin to serve a human master.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>So what did the Pharisees think about this matter? Rabbi Rabinowitz brings the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.22b.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 22b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai would expound this verse as a type of decorative wreath [ḥomer], i.e., as an allegory: Why is the ear different from all the other limbs in the body, as the ear alone is pierced? The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: This ear heard My voice on Mount Sinai when I said: “For to Me the children of Israel are slaves” (Leviticus 25:55), which indicates: And they should not be slaves to slaves. And yet this man went and willingly acquired a master for himself. Therefore, let this ear be pierced.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and notes that the version of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Bava_Kamma.7.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Tosefta</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...and crowned upon itself the burden of flesh and blood...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While these prove that the Pharisees were not welcoming of foreign rule, like the zealots, they did not agree that one must commit suicide because of such a danger. This is evident from the famous story about Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai, who himself went and struck a deal with the Romans that allowed him and other sages to escape the destruction, in order to save Judaism. Rabbi Rabinowitz points out that this was the way of the Pharisees for generations: to prefer the peaceful approach: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.71b.3?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shma'ayah and Avtaliyon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.1.12?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hillel</a>, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai and his student <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereishit_Rabbah.64.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananyah</a>. While the Pharisees preferred their ideal of being ruled only by Hashem, they were willing to accept foreign rule in certain cases - \"give me Yavneh and its sages\" - meaning, if Judaism could still carry on.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we see that the zealots were acting through zealot rulings, not Pharisaic/Orthodox rulings.</p>\n<p>The second person was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe-Zvi_Neria\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Moshe Tzvi Neriya</a> who wrote an essay that was published in a few places, among them in his book \"Tznif Melucha\", pg. 196-198, and a slightly revised version in his book \"Yisrael B'medinato\". In the original version, he points out that Rabbi Goren's understanding of the Yalkut Shimoni on Shmuel telling Shaul to die is problematic, since according to Rabbi Goren, Shmuel literally commanded Shaul to kill himself by his own sword, when this is not evident anywhere in Shmuel's words. He then points out that even if this is the proper understanding of the midrash, then this actually goes entirely against Rabbi Goren's conclusion, because this means that what Shmuel told Shaul to do was per prophecy - a hora'at sha'ah, a temporary, one-time ruling, only for Shaul. Therefore, one cannot compare Shaul to any other case! He then brings various poskim who discussed the case of Shaul and showed how they agreed that what Shaul did was wrong.</p>\n<p>He concludes by saying that though the story of Metzada demands further investigation to understand whether they were justified in any way, they most certainly were not justified by Elazar ben Yair who held that \"Let us pity ourselves, our children, and our wives while it is in our own power to show pity to them; for we were born to die, as well as those were whom we have begotten; nor is it in the power of the most happy of our race to avoid it\" and \"This it is that our laws command us to do; this it is that our wives and children crave at our hands; nay, God himself hath brought this necessity upon us\". Rabbi Neriya wrote that it is unnecessary to note that no such law exists in the Torah; the Torah wishes we continue on living.</p>\n<p>In the revised version, he noted that there's much evidence that has surfaced showing that there's a very good chance that the story of Metzada never happened, which makes discussion of the subject highly hypothetical.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Flusser\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. David Flusser</a> in his essay \"The Victims of Metzada In Their Eyes and In the Eyes of Their Generation\", in the book \"Jews and Judaism in the Second Temple Era\", pg. 116-146 discusses a view expressed by some, that the midrash in Sifrei Devarim 32:23 refers to the people of Metzada (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/66287/mesada-masada-are-there-any-torah-sources-confirming-or-denying-josephus-versi/122038#122038\">here</a>). He points out that even if that's true, it's still unclear from the midrash itself what Chazal thought about the event, whether they viewed it positively or negatively. He discusses the view of this type of martyrdom during the Second Temple Era at length. One piece of evidence that he brings is the midrash from Yalkut Shimoni that Rabbi Goren brought. He analyzes it and concludes that it's an ancient midrash from circa the destruction of the Temple. However, he reaches the same conclusion as Rabbi Rabinowitz, that though both the sages and the zealots shared preference for liberty, they disagreed upon what must one do or not do when there's danger of losing that liberty.</p>\n\n\n",

At least one shabbos will occur during the Nine Days, and meat is permitted for consumption then. Until refrigeration was invented, eating meat on Shabbos meant -- well yes they had other preservation methods, but most likely people would be buying it during the Nine Days too. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly someone could be making a <em>seudas mitzva</em> and permitted to eat meat; so he could buy the meat whenever is convenient -- or I could buy the meat for him, and so on.</p>\n\n\n",

(Long and personal)\nI have long 'suspected' my Jewish ancestry (on my father's side, I'm 'biologically' from Central - Eastern Europe) and my recent ancestry study confirms that.\nI am moving to Canada soon and I believe Judaism is probably the only religion which has passed the millenia of suppresion which means to me that the Jews do something extremely well, maybe it's the fact that Judaism is more the way of life normalizing or influencing more spheres of life than, say, Christian denominations?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>To start: For some excellent tips on someone starting conversion, see this question and its answers:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12648/first-steps-for-someone-considering-conversion\">First steps for someone considering conversion</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As DoubleAA noted in his comment, studying conversion is something that is usually, but not always, done at a personal level. That being said, there are many classes one can go to about Judaism that are given for Jew and Gentile alike. </p>\n\n<p>I recommend that you get in touch with a Rabbi in the neighborhood you plan to move to. Ask him about what classes he offers, and whether you can join. Be up front about being non-Jewish, but really, that should not deter any rabbi from teaching you. Some may not offer classes on your level of learning, but they should be able to refer you to a rabbi that does. Certainly, before studying specifically for conversion, you should attend a few classes and speak to a rabbi face to face about it.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>And now, on to the question!</p>\n\n<p>As far as <em>organizations</em> go, Chabad is a world-wide organization that has rabbis everywhere.

I don't know if that matters, since you didn't specify <em>where</em> in Canada you are going.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Probably Toronto, very likely Ottowa.

Is it permissible to do those dishes on Tisha B'Av?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Rama (OC 553:2) writes that one should not לטייל = \"take pleasure strolls\" even on Erev Tisha b\"Av that falls on Shabbat; how much more so must one avoid extraneous activity on Tisha b'Av itself!</p>\n<p>The Biur Halacha there quoting the Ma'amar Mordechai drives this point home:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואי לאו דמיסתפינא מחברייא הו\"א דאפילו ביום ט\"ב עצמו היה לנו להקל דבעוה\"ר נתקלקלו הדורות וביום ט\"ב מטיילין בשווקים ומשיחין שיחת חולין ואפילו היודעים ספר וקצת הלומדים מקילין בזה ופשיטא דבאופן זה טפי הוי עדיף להו ללמוד וכיוצא בדבר מצינו בירושלמי א\"ר אבא בר ממל אלו היה מי שיתמנה עמי הייתי מתיר מלאכה בחוה\"מ כלום אסרו אלא כדי שיהא אוכלין ושותין ושמחין ועוסקין בתורה וכדון אינון אוכלין ושותין ופוחזין ע\"כ ואף אנו נאמר כלום אסרו הלמוד אלא כדי שיהיו יושבין בעניני צער ואבילות ומתוך כך זוכרין ודואגין על חורבן הבית והנה מטיילין ומשיחין שיחת חולין ומסיחין דעתן מן האבלות ומתוך כך באים לידי שחוק והיתול.‏<br />\nIf I were able, I would have thought to be lenient [and allow] learning Torah on Tisha b'Av itself, for in our many sins we have become problematic in that on Tisha b'Av people stroll through the market and speak mundane things; even those who are somewhat learning are lenient in this regard. It is obvious that in this case it would be prefered that they learn [things that would otherwise be prohibited on Tisha b'Av]. A similar instance can be found in the Yerushalmi which states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R Abba bar Mamal said: if only there were anyone with me, I would permit work to be done on Chol HaMoed for it was only forbidden [to do work on Chol HaMoed] so that people could rejoice [in the holiday] and [have time to] learn Torah, yet we eat and drink and are 'irresponsible'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So too us, wasn't learning Torah only forbidden on Tisha b'Av so that people would dwell on matters of pain and mourning and ultimately come to remember and worry about the destruction of the Temple? Yet we stroll about, discuss mundane matters and distract our minds from the mourning. Through this we come to inappropriate levity and humor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He concludes that despite his wishes, the prohibition on learning Torah on Tisha b'Av is the law and unfortunately cannot be altered.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Mishna (Pesachim 4:5) states the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מקום שנהגו לעשות מלאכה בתשעה באב עושין, מקום שנהגו שלא לעשות מלאכה אין\n  עושין, ובכל מקום תלמידי חכמים בטלים. רבן שמעון בן גמליאל אומר: לעולם\n  יעשה אדם עצמו תלמיד חכם</p>\n  \n  <p>In a place where people work on the 9th of Av, one may [work]. In a\n  place where people do not work, one may not. In all places, Torah\n  scholars are idle [Meiri: since they feel the loss of the temple the\n  keenest]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: as a rule, one should make\n  himself a Torah scholar [and not work on the 9th of Av].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To this principle, the Tur adds (OC 554:22, 24) that this is unlikely to cause <i>machloket</i> (in reference to concerns voiced by the Mishna in Pesachim 4:1) - literally, ולא חיישינן ליוהרא (\"and he will not be thought arrogant\"). He also quotes Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel as saying that those who work on the 9th of Av will never receive a blessing (אינו רואה סימן ברכה לעולם - quoting Taanit 30b).</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Arukh (<i>ibid.</i>) clarifies that latter point by saying that it is the labour they are performing that will not be blessed (אינו רואה סימן ברכה מאותה מלאכה). So far as the former principle is concerned, the following is the language of the mechaber:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מקום שנהגו לעשות מלאכה בתשעה באב עושין, במקום שנהגו שלא לעשות אין\n  עושין, ובכל מקום תלמידי חכמים בטלים, וכל הרוצה לעשות עצמו תלמיד חכם\n  לענין זה עושה. ואפילו במקום שנהגו שלא לעשות, מותר על-ידי אינו-יהודי\n  אפילו בביתו. ופרקמטיא להרויח ולהשתכר, במקום שנהגו שלא לעשות מלאכה\n  אסור, ובמקום שנהגו לעשות מותר אלא שממעט, שאפילו משנכנס אב ממעטין מלישא\n  וליתן</p>\n  \n  <p>In a place where people work on the 9th of Av, one may [work]. In a\n  place where people do not work, one may not. In all places, Torah\n  scholars are idle, and all who wish to make themselves a Torah scholar\n  in this respect may do so. Even in a place where people do not work,\n  it is permissible for one to have a non-Jew work for him, even in his\n  house. And a merchant woman [likewise, when she wishes] to earn money\n  and to profit: in a place where people do not do work it is forbidden,\n  while in a place where people do [work] it is permissible - but one\n  should reduce [their labour], since we reduce our business activities\n  with the onset of Av.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The foregoing quite clearly only deals with business transactions, as is made clear in the Mishna Berurah, where it understands the stipulation that one will not see a blessing from this work as meaning that one will not see a blessing מאותן מעות שמרויח מאותה מלאכה (from the money that one gains from [doing] that work). That said, however, consider the language of the Rema (OC 554:22):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא נהגו באיסור מלאכה כי אם עד חצות. ונהגו להחמיר עד חצות בכל מלאכה\n  שיש בה שיהוי קצת אפילו מעשה הדיוט, אבל דבר שאין בה שיהוי, כגון הדלקת\n  נרות או קשירה וכדומה, מותרת</p>\n  \n  <p>We are not accustomed to the prohibition on work except for until\n  <i>chatzot</i><strong>¹</strong>. Also, we are accustomed to be strict until\n  <i>chatzot</i> concerning all work that entails a small amount of\n  delay - even if it be simple labour. Concerning something that entails\n  no delay, such as lighting candles or tying knots or so on, it is\n  permissible.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>¹</strong> Based on the Mishna's foregoing discussion of working on the 14th of\n  Nissan (Pesachim 4:1), I am tempted to understand <i>chatzot</i> here\n  as <i>chatzot hayyom</i>, rather than <i>chatzot hallayla</i>. In\n  actual fact, I do not know which of the two it is that the Rema is\n  referring to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems to me that, based on the foregoing, you could find avenues to be both lenient or to be strict as regards the washing of dishes and the cleaning of the house. The Mishna Berurah observes that the foregoing gloss of the Rema constitutes normative halakha, so if it is your custom to rule in accordance with the Mishna Berurah, you may wish to be strict in this matter - at least until <i>chatzot hayyom</i>.</p>\n\n\n",

Nowadays, we can follow that tradition safely by doing it with a tube. It seems ironic to follow the gemara's health-suggestions in a way (b'peh) that we know to cause health-risks. However, some groups feel that there are other reasons for doing Metzitzah and that it should still be done since the health risks are small. If so, they should make strong safeguards to lessen the risk of transmitting disease.</p>\n<p>Hakirah has an article from 2006 available online <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%203%20Sprecher.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">about metzitzah b’peh</a> (pdf), which I summarize below (from my <a href=\"http://www.torahjournal.com/blog/2006/06/metzitzah-bpeh-summary/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">previous summary</a>).</p>\n<p>In the article he explains the historical medical background to metzitzah. In ancient times, people didn't know that blood circulated or that pathoegns cause disease. The hellenic system of medicine thought blood was attracted to cuts and could decay and form pus, so it was necessary to get the blood to flow from a cut to prevent disease. (The author cites R’ Nachum Rabinovitch who compares the Rambam’s requirement for metzitzah to the Rambam’s suggestion to suck the blood out after a snake bite). He discusses some modern-day rationals for doing MBP, but then refutes them.</p>\n<p>The next part shows that metzitzah b’peh is a danger and many cases are cited where it has unfortunately caused harm to infants. He also tells the the history of MBP, and quotes some of the discussions about it from the 19th century. He then discusses the p’sak of the chasam sofer who didn’t even consider metzitzah b’peh to be a minhag. He concludes that if most of the <em>litvishe</em> gedolim accepted that MBP was a danger, surely now, when we know much more about transmission of diseases, we should not risk it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Metzitzah B'peh is rooted in the Talmud, and has been safely practiced for thousands of years.</p>\n<p>The suggestion that Metzitzah B'peh was involved in the transmission of the herpes simplex virus cases in New York City, has never been conclusively proven.

We would need to test the DNA of the practitioner, and compare it with the DNA of the virus in the baby. Otherwise, the baby could have gotten it from someone else.</p>\n<p>In the cases cited, New York City ignored science, and declines to employ DNA testing, the universally recognized gold standard in determining the source of an infection. Thus, the city actually put the infants’ lives at risk by allowing these other transmitters to continue unhindered.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hamodia.com/2015/01/12/results-rockland-tests-mohalim-puts-pressure-nyc/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hamodia.com/2015/01/12/results-rockland-tests-mohalim-puts-pressure-nyc/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yated.com/landmark-program-uncovers-false-positive-in-neonatal-herpes-case/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://yated.com/landmark-program-uncovers-false-positive-in-neonatal-herpes-case/</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Yes of course it's necessary.

It's interesting to see where the sedarim break up differently than the chapters (once a teacher told me that the number is such that if you read one a day, exempting Shabbat, Yom Tov [I think counting one day for Yom Tov as it's an Eretz Yisraeli system] and Tisha B'Av, it takes you throuh Tanakh in one year). However, the presence of both reference numbers on the page is extremely confusing and difficult to follow. </p>\n\n\n",

Things began to change in the modern world. From the nineteenth\n  century on, Jews came to see the Arch’s Menorah in a much more\n  positive light, as a symbol for Judaism. For Jewish traditionalists\n  and Zionists, its unique form symbolized a hope for national\n  restoration in the Land of Israel. The only “archaeologically\n  accurate” representation of the Temple vessels then known, the Arch\n  was reimagined as a Jewish treasure and a link to a glorious past.\n  Jews reproduced the Arch of Titus Menorah within synagogues and many\n  other communal contexts. After long deliberation, in 1949, the Arch of\n  Titus Menorah was chosen as the symbol for the new State of Israel.\n  Bringing the Menorah “home,” at least figuratively, Israeli authors\n  and artists saw the Menorah as a metaphor for the entire Jewish\n  people, and its reappropriation as Israel’s national symbol as part of\n  the “ingathering of exiles” that the new State saw as its mission.<sup>51</sup></p>\n  \n  <hr>\n  \n  <p><sup>51</sup> This history is masterfully related by team member Alec Mishory in\n  his Lo and Behold: Zionist Icons and Visual Symbols in Israeli Culture\n  (Tel Aviv: Yediot Aharonot, 2000), 138-96, in Hebrew.

If one witnessed a co-worker submerging the spout into non-kosher food, the urn should not be used. In many cases, however, one does not actually witness the co-worker placing the spout in the bowl but is concerned that it is a possibility. In those cases, one should make an assessment of the likelihood of this happening. If the spout is sufficiently far away from the tabletop so it would be unnecessary to bring the bowl up to the spout, one should simply wipe the outside of the spout and run a little water through it before filling a cup. If the spout is so close to the tabletop that a bowl would not fit easily without touching the spout, one should not use the urn. Regarding the steam rising from the bowl, for various halachic reasons, the spout remains kosher. In such a case, one need only wipe the outside of the spout and dispense some hot water that should be discarded and then take hot water or coffee for use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You may use the water from the tap.</p>\n\n<p>The Rema writes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=498&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">YD 105:3</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אסור לערות מכלי שיש בו שומן כשר לנר דולק שיש בו חלב או שומן איסור\n  ובדיעבד אין לחוש.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is forbidden to pour from a utensil that contains kosher fats into\n  a lit candle that contains non-kosher fats, but after the fact one\n  should not be concerned about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to be similar to your case. However, there are at least two independent reasons why your case can be permitted:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Rema says that bedi'eved it is permitted, and <em>taking water after the other person used it for non-kosher is a case of bedi'eved</em>, not lechatchila. My basis for saying this is the Shach in the se'if before (se'if katan 5) who defines lechatchila and bedi'eved this way. Meaning that lechatchila in this type of situation means take precautions as if doing x will cause problems, but once x is done we don't see any issur whatsoever, and the thing may be consumed lechatchila.</p></li>\n<li><p>More importantly, the details of the Rema's case are very significant - the hot item; the candle is on bottom. Therefore the basic rules of <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=76&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">tata'ah gavar</a> (for explanation see <a href=\"http://beismedrash.blogspot.com/2012/03/sinks-and-countertops-on-pesach-and.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> starting from 3) are able to come into play and say that non-kosher flavor transfers. On the other hand <em>your case is exactly the opposite - the bottom; the contents of the person's cup are cold</em> (certainly not kli rishon hot). Therefore the Halachic rules of flavor transference say that there is nothing to be concerned about.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I've elaborated extensively on these points in <a href=\"http://beismedrash.blogspot.com/2012/07/hot-water-taps-kashrus.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> blog post.</p>\n\n\n",

Preceding it, the text is primarily Moshe's speaking about stories that have happened to them and general wisdom. From ReEh through the end of the Tochecha is a dense legal code framed on both sides by promises of blessings and curses (the Tochecha at the end and the paragraph beginning 'ReEh' at the start). In other words, it is a covenant containing the terms of the agreement and the outcome of fulfilling or breaking the agreement. Thus it seems appropriate that the grammatical structure of ReEh would parallel that of the later Tochecha.</p>\n\n\n",

When making the מי שבירך afterwards, one often includes the name of relatives. How does the gabbai refer to himself if the father wishes to give a bracha to his children? The gabbai adds in something like \"avi umori\" out of respect, so he probably doesn't need to add \"achi\" if his brother and family get the מי שבירך but does he refer to himself and his children in the third person?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I've seen the Gabbai Sheni say it instead, to avoid the distasteful move of calling out \"God bless me!\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have been a gabbai and my sons are gabbaim.

D'Rabanan, D'oraita, etc.?</p>\n\n<p>What about separate dancing but without a mehitza?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Dancing with one's spouse in public when they could touch each other in private: ill-advised. Shulchan Aruch warns against excess physical affection with one's wife in public. (In \"Fiddler on the Roof\", Tevye demands that the rabbi rule whether it is absolutely forbidden, and the rabbi hesitates; it's a \"shouldn't.\" Some measure of privacy is called for in a healthy marriage.)</p>\n\n<p>Or to quote Rabbi Elchanan Wasserman (as heard from Rabbi Rakeffet):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Chumash ends with <em>l'eini kol yisrael</em>. Something can be permitted, but if done in front of the whole Jewish people, that's the end of the Torah!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dancing with one's spouse at a time in the month when they're prohibited from touching each other -- prohibited. If the touch is \"affectionate\", it would be <em>lo tikrevu legalot erva</em> -- \"don't even come close to prohibited relations\"; the Rishonim debate whether that's a Biblical prohibition or a rabbinic one hinted by the verse. As for what's called \"affectionate\" touch ... well it depends what's called affectionate, and what's called dancing, I guess. (See Rabbi Henkin's essay for one Acharon who prohibited mixed dancing \"as it may lead to affectionate touch.\")</p>\n\n<p>Having a big dance event for married couples -- ill-advised; on a given day, let's say a third of your couples are prohibited from dancing. Either they sit it out and it's giving away far too much private information (not to mention making them feel awful), or they feel pressured into doing something prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>Dancing with someone else's spouse, or any single woman (who is presumed to be a <em>nida</em>) other than an immediate relative -- prohibited as above.</p>\n\n<p>The mechitza -- serves two functions. One is to remind people to keep the dancing separate. (Again, just a matter of good policy, to the best of my knowledge; see Rabbi Henkin's essay for more discussion on when a mechitza is needed.) Also a matter of good policy; avoids \"creepy guys staring at the women as they're dancing.\" If you're asking if an opaque mechitza is absolutely necessary because it's prohibited to watch the other side, well, there's watching and then there's watching.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>According to R' <a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2004/12/ride-to-dance.html\">Gil Student</a>, touching affectionately during a slow dance would be forbidden biblically (according to the Rambam) or rabbinicaly (according to the Ramban). </p>\n\n<p>He says that there is also a ban on mixed dancing (even without touching) going back to the Maharam miRottenburg, and he says that R' Yehuda Henkin says that this ban is still in place he says that the fact that there is a ban is no proof that it would have been permitted without one, as many bans from the Rishonim's times were bans which re-banned already existing prohibitions).</p>\n\n<p>He also mentions a Sdei Chemed that one is not even allowed to be present where women are dancing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It is forbidden because it is not richuk nashim but rather kiruv nashim.

Rather, the entire world is under HaShem's <em>hashgahah</em> - some things being directly effected and/or managed and others being effected and/or managed indirectly, or it is possible to say \"actively\" and \"passively.\" However, these are terms used by us in order to facilitate understanding and cannot in their fullness apply to the One Transcendent Creator.</p>\n\n<p>Some common examples of <em>hashgahah k'lalith</em> would be leaves falling from trees, spiders catching flies, bigger fish eating smaller fish, et al. While the Creator is aware of these events and designed the nature inherent in each of them, He does not actively determine which leaf will fall or where it will land, which fly will be caught by which spider, or which fish will be swallowed by another. These are natural events that are a part of the world which He has designed to function in this way. Inherent also in <em>hashgahah k'lalith</em> is the idea of \"chance\" - which is essentially nature taking its course with the scientific variables being too far beyond conscious human perception for us to know with certainty what will happen next. This concept is expressed by Hazal where it states: \"<em>Olam k'minhagho nohegh - the world continues on it's natural course</em>\" (b. Avodhah Zarah 54b).</p>\n\n<p>The cognate to this is when the Creator specifically intervenes in the lives of certain humans, \"bending\" the course of the natural world to accommodate them in various ways according to His will. The condition for this type of <em>hashgahah</em> is that the individual draw close to HaShem's will in thought, word, and deed. To the extent that a person trusts in and aligns himself with the Creator at any given moment, he is able to \"draw\" - as it were - the Creator's specific supervising influence into the events of his life. A common example of this is the life of <em>Yosef haSsadiq</em> in the <em>Tora</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Most <em>Rishonim</em> - if not <strong>all</strong> - limit the scope of <em>hashgahah p'rattith</em> in some way. And according to the majority of those do, the world and the various creatures which it contains, are governed mainly by <em>hashgaha k'lalith</em> and that <em>hashgaha p'rattith</em> is limited in scope to human beings - specifically the righteous among the Jewish nation. This view is expressed by the <strong>Rambam</strong> (Maimonides, <em>More Nevukhim</em>, III:17-18), <strong>Ralbag</strong> (Gersonides, <em>Sefer Milhamoth HaShem</em>, IV), <strong>Rihal</strong> (cf. <em>Sefer Kuzari</em> 1:109), <strong>Ramban</strong> (Nahmanides, <em>Pirush Al HaTora</em> - <em>Shemoth</em> 13:15), and those <em>Rishonim</em>  who are essentially Maimonidean in their philosophical orientation (i.e. <strong>RaDaQ</strong>, <strong>Ibn Tibon</strong>, <strong>Sforno</strong>, <strong>Me'iri</strong>, et al). </p>\n\n<p>In fact, the <em>Sefer HaHinnukh</em> (attributed to the Spanish Rishon, Rav Aharon Lewi HaBartziloni) states this limitation quite succinctly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שיש כתות בני אדם יחשבו כי השגחת הש״י על כל ענייני העולם בין בעלי חיים או כל שאר הדברים כלומר שלא יתנועע דבר אחד קטן בעולם הזה רק בחפצו ב״ה ובגזרתו עד שיחשבו כי בנפול עלה אחד מן האילן הוא גזר עליו שיפול וא״א שיתאחר או יקדם זמן נפילתה אפי׳ רגע וזה דעת רחוק הרבה מן השכל</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>Translation</em></strong>: <em>\"There are sects of people who think that the hashgahah of HaShem Yithborakh is upon all matters of the world, whether animals or other things, that is to say that not even one small thing in the world moves except by His will, blessed be He, and by His decree, to the point that they think that with regard to the falling of one leaf from a tree that it is [Divinely] decreed upon it that it should fall and that it is impossible that it could have fallen either earlier or later than the [Divinely decreed] time of its falling even by a single moment. <strong>Such an understanding is very far from intelligent</strong>.\"</em> (Parashath Tazria, [Misswah 169][1])</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea commonly espoused in the Jewish world today (expressed above as incorrect by the <em>Sefer HaHinnukh</em>), namely that everything in the world and everything which happens in the world is a subject to and governed by <em>hashgahah p'rattith</em>, was virtually unknown until the preaching of the Baal Shem Tov. The adage [apparently] spoken by him varies depending on the source retelling it; at times he said to have attributed <em>hashgaha p'rattith</em> to a turning leaf, a blade of grass in the wind, or to grains of sand falling into a hole. In his estimation, the concept of <em>hashgahah kelalith</em> either did not exist or was an illusion.</p>\n\n<p><em>Le-'aniyuth da`ati</em> - in my humble opinion - such a stance is in stark contradiction to centuries, if not millenia, of consistent Torah teaching on the subject (not to mention that such a view leads inevitably to the attribution of absurdity - has wa-shalom - to the Creator, may He be blessed, and a host of other philosophical errors). Therefore, it is to be rejected.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>All of human beings decisions (except in extreme situations) are not ordained by heaven because all humans have \"bechirah\" free will. \nThere is also a Rashi in Masechta Sotah an daf beis amud alef which says that \"Hakol biyiday shomayim chutz miyiras shomayim\" that means that heaven knows and somewhat controls everything except for your fear of heaven (and how you act about it which is most of the actions you do), as Rashi states further it says these things that heaven decides are if he will be strong or weak, smart or not so, and things like that, but they are not actions like doing a mitzvah or ch\"v an aveirah. So now, from this Rashi we see that mundane things about people are decided by heaven. Now what is considered a mundane thing, the weather maybe, that is not controlled by humans so now we bring in the concept of \"tevah\" the way Hashem programmed the world to run, Hashem may not actively control the weather but it was set in the blueprints of the world that when there is a lot of evaporated water in the clouds, it rain and if its cold enough, it snows, these things are not actively ordained by Hashem but they were pre-set by Him.  As was said in the Rambam that was in the question, a spider catching a fly... that it is not controlled by heaven but it was made in the blueprints that spiders will catch flies and other things like that.  </p>\n\n\n",

If you consult Ada Yardeni's <i>The Book of Hebrew Script</i> (The British Library, 2002), you'll see that the shape of Hebrew letters has been evolving over the millennia. According to <i>The Hebrew Book: An Historical Survey</i> (ed. R. Posner and I. Ta-Shema; Jerusalem: Keter, 1975), Hebrew printing only began in Italy in 1475. The first book ever printed, around that time, in Reggio di Calabria used a semi-cursive font that was popular in that region, and which only came to be known as \"Rashi script\" because the text in which it appeared was Rashi's commentary on the Pentateuch. The first Hebrew book to be printed with square script was printed 26 years later, in 1501!</p>\n\n<p>In time, the custom of utilising \"Rashi script\" as a commentary was maintained purely in order to differentiate the commentary from the actual text itself, but asking why it didn't get changed \"back\" would be like asking why the square script didn't get changed back into one of the dozen or so different scripts that preceded <em>it</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe that many current printings are changing the Rashi script into block script. </p>\n\n<p>One reason to use Rashi script is a very technical one: When multiple commentaries are printed on a page, it presents a visual difficulty.

The time span is from purchase not from when it was written. </p>\n\n<p>Al pi Kabbalah, the room that you attach a mezuzah to has a connection to the room and each mezuzah should be marked which room it came from.

Much more important that the kabbalistic reason mentioned, is that there is a halachic issue of \"horada bekedusha\" One may not purposely take a mezuzah that was on a door that had a Torah obligation, such as a door leading into the house or in most cases, a bedroom door, and place it on a doorpost that was a questionable obligation, such as an entryway without a door or a from less than 4 x 4 amos. if the mezuzahs get mixed up then one may put them back up anywhere.\nAnther reason is if a mezuzah is found to be totally passul then if it came from a doorpost that requires a bracha then a new bracha is made, even if putting up the new mezuzah 5 minutes after taking the original down. However, if one doesn't know where the mezuzah came from then a new bracha isn't made since it may have come from a doorway that didn't require a mezuzah due to it being a doorway wose obligation is questionable.</p>\n\n<p>There is a preference to put up loaner mezuzahs in the interim, particularly if they will be down overnight.

When one knows the facts, can he deliberately cause himself not to know them? We seem to find contradictory rulings in various branches of <em>halacha</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For example, one cannot take a non-kosher spoon identical to other, kosher spoons, and hide it among them (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Yore Dea</em> 99:6), causing himself not to know the facts.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, there are times when one must strive to ascertain the facts, which seems to be even stronger than a prohibition on causing himself to not know the facts. For example, even though \"<em>shehakol</em>\" works on any food <em>b'diavad</em>, one can't eat something, saying \"<em>shehakol</em>\", if he doesn't know what sort of food it is (e.g., <em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em> 50:2): he must ascertain the facts if he can. Similarly, as DoubleAA notes in a comment, one is required (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%97_%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>SA</em>, <em>Orach Chayim</em> 8:9</a>) to inspect <em>tzitzis</em> before donning their garment, so as to be sure they are kosher, again a requirement to ascertain facts.</p>\n\n<p><em>However</em>, <a href=\"/q/62525\">I think one <em>can</em> hide a dairy spoon among pareve spoons</a>, causing himself not to know the facts.</p>\n\n<p>Also, someone not in her <em>shiv'a n'kiyim</em> should wear colored clothes so as to hide any potential spotting (<em>SA YD</em> 190:10), causing herself not to know the facts.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I seem to recall (but cannot find) that <em>bes din</em>, in interviewing witnesses to the new moon, would be deliberately cursory if they knew (by calculation) the correct date, so as not to find out the witnesses were lying, again causing themselves not to know the facts.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: Are there specific parameters for when we say one can deliberately not know the facts?

In Israel someone was ruled not a mamzer because there were no witnesses to it. The mother was not believed, even though of all people she is most likely to know.</p>\n<p>Story from the Gemara Nidah 59:b, transcribed from \"Family Purity by Rabbi Fishel Jacobs\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once a woman came before Rabbi Akiva saying she saw a stain. \"Perhaps you have a cut?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" she replied, \"but it healed.\" \"Perhaps it reopened?\" asked Rabbi Akiva. \"Yes, perhaps it did.\" Rabbi Akiva pronounced her pure.</p>\n<p>Seeing the surprised look on his students' faces he explained: \"The sages decreed that finding blood stains can render a woman niddah but this legislation itself was a stringency. Therefore specific decision with the laws of staining aren't to be decided in a vein of strictness, but rather in a spirit of leniency. This is so because on a scriptural level only actual menstruation renders a woman niddah, as it says, \"When a woman experiences a menstrual discharge, it being blood which emerges from her body...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also see Mechaber 190:18, and Niddah 58:b; and Toras Hashlomom 190:14 which talks about the suggestion to wear colored clothing.</p>\n\n\n",

Direct, private requests to the poster to stop doing this (from several people) have not changed his behavior.  Requests to the owners of the mailing list have gone unanswered.

Are the \"what's the [topic] issue\" responses appropriate, or does the possible embarrassment they cause preclude them?  Does it matter if the poster is Jewish?  Does it matter if it's a Jewish-topic mailing list -- do we expect a different standard of behavior among Jews than we would on, say, a gardening list?

Consequently, it seems to me on the machmir side that maybe he shouldn't see any part of her that he would not have been allowed to see before they were married, so that he won't turn out to be disgusted by something he couldn't see before they got married.

From textual context alone I don't think it makes sense to equate this with lighting Chanuka candles or muktza.</p>\n<p>One suggestion: The <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> understands the concept of refining ones character to be included in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%9B%D7%97_%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">והלכת בדרכיו</a> - the obligation to walk in the ways of God. I'd assume this could fall under that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I cannot find mention of nibbul peh in Rambam's Mishneh Torah, or in other lists of the mitsvot, such as Yereim, Semag, Semak, Ramban's addenda to Sefer Hamitsvot, etc.  I therefore assume that according to Rambam, et al. it is not a Biblical prohibition and that the associated <em>derashot</em> are asmakhtot. I similarly find no mention if it in the major codes such as the Arba'ah Turim and the Shulhan Arukh. Their combined silence seems to imply that it is not a formal rabbinic prohibition either. That does not mean, however, that performing it is permissible, or even that doing so does not violate a rabbinic, or even biblical commandment. It just means that it is not its own legal category (in spite of its distinct name).</p>\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/68150/8775\">cannibalism and public nudity</a> can both be extremely problematic, even-though it is likely that neither is the subject of a discrete prohibition.</p>\n\n\n",

If you were in that situation what would you do or feel? What is a Gentile to do?</p>\n\n<p>Long form: I have been reading and studying a lot about Judaism, and reading various questions here. It so happens that I am not Jewish. Based on my readings (from Stackexchange and elsewhere) over the years, one cannot help but feel a sense of inferiority since we don't have a special relationship with g-d, and are not the chosen ones. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do since I was born this way. One cannot help whom you are born to. I wonder what a devout Jew would answer to the following question: Suppose that you were not born into a Jewish family, what would you do? Is it fair that some people are chosen and others are not? Why did g-d not choose to make me one of his chosen ones?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Judaism holds that you don't actually have to be Jewish to be in right relationship with God.  Non-Jews who follow the seven laws of Noach even <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/jewfaq/gentiles.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">merit a place in the world-to-come</a>.  Jews have a <em>different</em> covenant with God than other peoples, but different is not necessarily superior.  I mean, <em>we</em> think highly of it, <em>for us</em>, but it is not required for anybody else.</p>\n\n<p>That said, a gentile who wants to join the Jewish people -- which is not necessary, but which some feel called to do -- is allowed to convert.  The process is long and requires a lot of study, because it is not a decision to be made lightly.  There are many resources available on that subject; you might find <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12648/first-steps-for-someone-considering-conversion\">this question</a> to be a useful starting point.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Why God chose some to be one way and others to be another way is not something we can comprehend.

If you are interested, the first thing you should do is start attending services at a (or several) local synagogue(s).

In the Rambam's peirush, he suggests that it's because Rabbi Yehoshua (or \"the sages\" in the Bavli's version) did not consider engraving on the skin to be a form of writing. If it's not a legitimate form of writing then by doing it on Shabbat one is only transgressing a rabbinic prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that, following this logic, writing on one's skin in ink (which is what the former part of the mishna speaks about) <em>is</em> a legitimate form of writing.

However, the Bach and Maharshal (quoted in Be'er Heitev 210:1) say that if he intended to misspeak, what he says counts. But if you were forced to say the Pledge of Allegiance (as in Yirmeyahu's <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/18288/1569\">boy scout example</a>), you are allowed to intend in your heart for it not to count (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=78\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">232:14</a>).</p>\n\n<p>If you already said the pledge of allegiance, I don't know of a way that it couldn't be a valid swear — but there always is hataras nedarim, of course. To do that, though, you have to regret it, and if you had known something you wouldn't have sworn. So if you are going to spy for Russia, you can say \"If I had known I would be spying for Russia against the USA, I wouldn't have sworn,\" and get three people to revoke the neder (but then again, if you were <em>forced</em> to work as a spy for the Russians, it counts as a \"neder ones\" (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=74\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rama, Yoreh Deah 232:12</a>)). </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, if the USA stops giving \"liberty and justice for all,\" the neder is not valid and doesn't even need to be revoked, because you vowed under the impression that \"the republic for which [the flag of the United States of America] stands\" was \"one nation, under G-d, indivisible, <em>with liberty and justice for all</em>.\" This applies even if you didn't say \"on condition\" (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=78\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">228:19</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I am afraid I do not have a written source on this but I asked this sheilah (question) l'maaseh (for practice) regarding the Pledge of Allegiance and the Boys Scout pledge, since I have always been uncomfortable with such things. I was told since one may at any time quit the organization, it was permitted. The idea as I understand it is that insofar as it is ultimately a voluntary \"obligation\" that one may retract at will there is no problem. While this answer is most directly and practically applicable to the Boy's Scout pledge, the wording of the Pledge of Allegiance has the same leeway.  While a good-faith recitation of the Pledge implies that it is more than a momentary affirmation it is not worded or intended as a vow permanently surrendering oneself to the state without qualification or restriction. A practical example is the Pledge doesn't preclude one from one day deciding to make aliyah.</p>\n\n\n",

The ReEM, another <em>rishon</em> brings as <em>halacha</em> that this only applies when the first <em>shul</em> does not have enough room for everybody. He argues that it is better for as many people as possible to <em>daven</em> together, so a <em>shul</em> should only be split up if there is not enough room to hold everyone. Most <em>achronim</em> see this as a <em>machlokes rishonim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Everybody agrees that it is not permitted to created a breakaway minyan when it is not done <em>le-shem shamayim</em>.  Rabbi Robinson seems to say that a dispute within the <em>shul</em> does not constitute a sufficient reason to create a breakaway. He does suggest, however, that personal preferences such as <em>nusach</em> could be considered <em>le-shem shamayim</em>. This is not necessarily sufficient to create a new <em>shul</em>, however.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if the new <em>shul</em>'s existence would cause financial or any other type of damage to the original <em>shul</em>, everybody agrees that it is forbidden to break away. Rav Moshe Feinstein takes this to an extreme:</p>\n\n<p>A <em>rav</em> of a <em>shul</em> came to Rav Moshe Feinstein after a group of people broke off from his <em>shul</em>. The group had broken away from the original <em>shul</em> because when this new <em>rav</em> had come, he had changed the <em>nusach</em> and the <em>niggunim</em> of the <em>davening</em>, in such a way which was so confusing to the members of the <em>shul</em> that they weren't able to <em>daven</em> properly. Also, the <em>rav</em> of the <em>shul</em> had cursed, scared, and embarrassed members of the <em>shul</em> on multiple occasions. The <em>rav</em> argued that there had actually only been two times when he had spoken strongly: once when he had to give some <em>musser</em> to the congregation, and another time when he said that his words had been misunderstood and he had not intended to be insulting. Furthermore, he said that without the other people remaining with his <em>shul</em> it would suffer financially, and not be able to continue operating. Rav Moshe Feinstein said that it was completely <em>asur</em> for the group to split off. He explains that just the fact that the break-away would cause financial difficulties for the original <em>shul</em> is sufficient to prevent the new <em>minyan</em> from breaking off.  It was asked of Rav Dovid Feinstein, the son of Rav Moshe Feinstein, if anything was missing from that story since it seems like the breakaway group had a lot of good reasons for separating. Rav Dovid Feinstein said that nothing was missing from the story and that Rav Moshe held that strongly about causing financial loss.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Ksav Sofer</em> says that it is only permitted to break away in very very unusual circumstances. Rabbi Robinson gives the example of a <em>shul</em> taking down the <em>mechitza</em> or hiring a female <em>rabbi</em> or doing something else that is totally against <em>halacha</em>. It seems that many of the <em>acharonim</em> and modern <em>poskim</em> agree with this opinion.</p>\n\n\n",

The Shoshanim LeDavid (quoted by Tosafos Chadashim) answers that \"When you get up\" according to Rabbi Eliezer is when you <em>personally</em> get up. Therefore, since princes <em>normally</em> get up at three hours, they can still say Shema at that time.</p>\n\n<p>We can apply this approach to your question.

I suppose there may be no rules or 'tips' about this, though.

I think this is a very dangerous route because you would be raising non-Jewish children as Jews and it could cause a lot of problems for them in the future. Firstly, they would be utterly confused to be raised \"as Jews\" (which I assume means attending Jewish schools and keeping the Torah), even though they are not really bound by Jewish law. One of your options is that either you or spouse convert to Judaism, however, this option too is quite difficult because a Jew or Jewess is not allowed to engage in sexual relations with a non-Jew, thus it would create a major strain on your marriage and hamper your abilities to have children anyways. In my opinion, the only options are for both you and your wife to convert and then you can raise your future children as full-fledged Jews or that neither you nor your wife convert and you raise your non-Jewish children as such, but you can work on instilling into their education an appreciation for Judaism and Torah law giving them the option to convert on their own when they reach maturity. With the second option, I suggest looking to the \"Noahide\" community for support and guidelines (you can find more information about them online). </p>\n\n<p>I hope I answered your question.</p>\n\n\n",

Although he does not elaborate on each example, here are 2:</p>\n<p>וַיִּשָּׂא לוֹט אֶת עֵינָיו וַיַּרְא אֶת כָּל כִּכַּר הַיַּרְדֵּן כִּי כֻלָּהּ מַשְׁקֶה לִפְנֵי שַׁחֵת יְ־הֹוָ־ה אֶת סְדֹם וְאֶת עֲמֹרָה כְּגַן יְ־הֹוָ־ה כְּאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם בֹּאֲכָה צֹעַר׃</p>\n<p><em>And Lot raised his eyes, and he saw the entire plain of the Jordan, that it was entirely watered; before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as you come to Zoar.</em></p>\n<p>'Lot believed in G-d and accepted the faith of Avraham because he saw Avraham's success in everything, but he saw, stared and understood that also the wicked dwell in peace and quiet and they have it good.  Because of this, he started figuring that everything is by chance, not Divine supervision- success is not dependent on serving G-d and faith in him.  Therefore, he traveled from the \"kadmon\" of the universe.  Now the verses are explained well:  <em>Lot lifted his eyes</em>- the eyes of his intellect, he saw, stared and understood <em>and he saw the entire plain of the Jordan, that it was entirely watered</em>...They were bad sinners, promiscuous, as Rashi wrote, <em>like the land of Egypt</em>- similar to Egypt who were famous for their promiscuity- such was the plain.  In spite of this, Lot understood that these wicked people got rich though this.  He said- why should I be loaded up with the yoke of Avraham's faith.  <em>So Lot chose the entire Jordan plain</em>...'</p>\n<p>וַיִּשָּׂא אַבְרָהָם אֶת-עֵינָיו, וַיַּרְא וְהִנֵּה-אַיִל, אַחַר, נֶאֱחַז בַּסְּבַךְ בְּקַרְנָיו; וַיֵּלֶךְ אַבְרָהָם וַיִּקַּח אֶת-הָאַיִל, וַיַּעֲלֵהוּ לְעֹלָה תַּחַת בְּנוֹ.</p>\n<p><em>Avraham lifted his eyes and saw- behold! a ram, afterwards, caught in the entanglements by its horns.

Avraham said- What is [a] shofar?  G-d said- Return behind you.  Just then, Avraham lifted his eyes and saw...and he took the ram.</em> It is necessary to ask- how didn't Avraham know what a shofar was?  It is also necessary to ask- what is 'return behind you'?  It appears to me, for [the sages] said- Shofar= Beautify (shifru) your actions.  That is what G-d said to Avraham- when you blow the shofar before me...I forgive you, that means when they repent. But Avraham did not understand what the purpose of the shofar was- how through blowing the shofar will there be atonement for them? G-d said- return behind you, that is the idea of repentance and the shofar hints that one should return behind himself and return from the path he has walked in.

The Gemara goes on to discuss whether three reasons are really needed, and it justifies each reason.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason, the objections raised against the third reason are so great that the Gemara has to limit the scope of the Beraitha. The Gemara finally adds, \"I Ba'ith Eimah\" (if you want, you could say, ie., an alternative explanation is) there's one person all alone, in restored ruins in a remote field, so there's no concern about it collapsing, and there's no suspicion that he will do anything unseemly because it's so remote the odds of finding a prostitute are zero, but unsavory characters do lie in wait and might attack. </p>\n\n<p>Why? Why does the Gemara feel compelled to scrutinize and justify each reason, and why does it object so strongly to the last justification that it has to come up with this isolated scenario? Why can't it just accept that these are all valid reasons not to enter ruins? In fact, I'm actually surprised it didn't go into a round of different Amoraim each adding a new reason.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>\nIt has been suggested in the comments that perhaps the Gemara sees a practical difference (Nafka Minah) in the reasons.

Therefore, if a tanna gives three reasons for something, it is assumed that each of the three reasons has independent application; that each reason has some application that could not have been derived from the others.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara here is not limiting the Halacha to specific cases. It is simply finding specific cases where only one reason is present and not the other, in line with the premise that the tanna was not simply embellishing.

    "content": "# Why don't translations of Tehilim 119 translate נשף like the Gemara?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=3b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gemara on Berachos 3b</a> asserts that נשף can mean either \"dawn\" or \"evening\", and cites <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26b9.htm#147\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tehilim 119:147</a> as an instance of \"evening\".</p>\n\n<p>However, every translation I have seen of this verse - the mechon-mamre above, the Metsuda Tehilim, and Artscroll, whose Gemara translation I am also using - translates neshef as \"dawn\".  Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>First of all, what you say is not exactly true. It might be the case that every <em>English</em> translation that you have seen understands the word to mean morning - and most probably because it is preceded by the verb \"to rise\" - but there are Hebrew commentaries that understand it in line with this gemara. Both the Radak and the Metzudat Tziyon understand the word as referring to the night-time, though the latter bases his interpretation on Isaiah 21:4, and neither of them mentions Berakhot.</p>\n\n<p>That said, Targum Yonatan translates it at שפרפרא, which means early morning, and if you're looking for a Talmudic basis for this interpretation (which, most probably, post-dates this targum), then you can see where this is the meaning given to the verse in Ketubot 111b, acc. to Rashi (s.v. קדמתי).</p>\n\n<p>As for discrepancies in general between the Talmud and English translations of the Bible, consider the following two points:</p>\n\n<p>• For a start, where the Talmud provides translations of words, those translations frequently differ from the word's <em>actual</em> meaning, and have little to do with its etymology. This particular point, in fact, was one of the bones of contention between Saadiah Gaon and the Karaites. Where the latter stressed the need to check cognate languages for similar words, Saadiah emphasised the role of the rabbinic literature in defining Hebrew usage. As it is, the methodology of the Karaites was closer to what linguists today would do in order to understand words that turn up very few times within the biblical literature;</p>\n\n<p>• Secondly, there are different translational methodologies, and how an individual translation renders an individual word depends very much on the methodology adopted by its translator. If you were to consult the Artscroll Tanakh, you will find that their translation often differs widely from the literal meaning of the Hebrew verse. This is an example of a \"dynamic equivalence\" translation, which means that it aims at reproducing the sense of the passage, where that sense is dictated (in their case) by their <em>hashkafa</em>.</p>\n\n<p>A \"formal equivalence\" translation, like the NRSV (or - to a lesser extent - like the JPS) will care less about conveying the overall sense, which might in some cases be communicated in a footnote, than a word-by-word transferral of the Hebrew into English.</p>\n\n<p>I mention these two points because the question you asked is perhaps of broader scope than just the translation of נשף in this particular verse, but is likely to bother you subsequently in relation to other words in other verses as well.</p>\n\n\n",

This is learned out from the fact that it says the strings should be \"Al Kanfei\" (<strong>On</strong> the corners) and not \"<strong>In</strong> the corner\".</p>\n\n<p>The Baal HaTanya <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30450&pgnum=66\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">learns out</a> from the verse (Devarim 22:12) \"<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0522.htm#12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">גְּדִלִים, תַּעֲשֶׂה-לָּךְ, עַל-אַרְבַּע כַּנְפוֹת כְּסוּתְךָ</a>\" that from the hole until the first knot is not considered part of the strings (Gedilim), which is why it is not counted when measuring the length of the strings.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, even the first knot should be a little more than a thumb's width from the corner of the Tallit Gadol. </p>\n\n<p>When softer material started being used to make the Garments (as displayed in the picture in the question), it was possible for the strings to slip down, causing the first knot to get closer than the minimal thumbwidth's requirement. So that people wouldn't constantly have to check the position of the first knot during prayer, the Baal Hatanya said to add a small hole and thread the largest string through it, after making the first knot. This would prevent the knot from slipping down.</p>\n\n<p>[The Baal HaTanya also holds that the hanging strings should touch the corners, which is why the knot is tied on the side and not the bottom, see <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30450&pgnum=65\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. However, this is not the reason for the little hole (it is why the hole is placed where it is, but it is a separate thing).</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.haoros.com/Archive/index.asp?kovetz=779&cat=9&haoro=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> where Rabbi Levin (editor-in-chief of the new print of the Shulchan Aruch HaRav) makes this clear]</p>\n\n<p>This is not necessary on a Lubavitcher's Tallit Katan, since the strings are threaded through a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/6336/why-do-some-pairs-of-tzitzit-have-one-hole-on-each-corner-and-some-have-two\">double hole</a>, and the first knot is tied right there. There is therefore no problem with ensuring that there is a minimal thumbwidth's (and a little extra) space from the knot to the corner. See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15472&pgnum=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for illustrations.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Actually there are others who were concerned over the issue, which, as SethJ notes above, is referred to as <em>notef al hakanaf</em>, meaning it should hang down along the side, not from the bottom. </p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish held that you should tie the first knot really snug so that it bunches up the fabric, and that way the tzitzit won't budge. You see a lot of <em>avreichim</em> (at least here in Eretz Yisroel) who follow this <em>shita</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But according to some opinions, if you bunch up the fabric, you no longer have a <em>shiur</em> (the minimum is the distance from the joint on your thumb to the end of your thumbnail).</p>\n\n<p>So one of the Lubavitch rebbe's came up with a very innovative solution, as shown in the photo (that same photo happens to appear on my webstore).</p>\n\n<p>This problem is why some of the top-end talleisim (e.g. \"Chatanim\") have a slightly stiffer wool corner reinforcement.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is precedent set by individual rabbis, but not courts?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The headline on this <a href=\"http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/107807/a-one-man-supreme-court\">obituary for R' Eliyashiv (\"A One Man Supreme Court\")</a> got me thinking - why do we invest so much power in precedents set by individual rabbis, as great as they may be, but not in court rulings? Courts usually look to individual rabbis' prior rulings when deciding a case, rather than individual rabbis looking at previous court cases to determine how they should rule. Why is that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>First Rabbnic courts do look to previous decisions by other courts for guidance in their decisions.  You will note on the Rabbinute's page regarding testing to be <a href=\"http://www.rabanut.gov.il/vf/ib_items/173/dayan.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dayyan that one is tested specifically on Piskei Din</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/9119\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Piskei Din of which 18 volumes</a> are available free online, are the previous rulings of the High Rabbinical court of Israel.\nRegarding the Teshuvot of Rav Eliashiv in particular, in his sefer Kovetz Teshuvot, according to the <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.co.il/2009/08/repackaged-rulings-responsa-of-r.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">seforim blog</a>, they are simply culled from Piskei Din from the years Rav Eliashiv sat on the court.  Likewise many works of Teshuvot by great Rabbis are their recorded decisions from times that they sat on Batei Din.\nSo part of the answer is that they do rely upon previous court decisions for precedent.  However, and this is of equal importance, precedent plays a very minimal part in Beit Din process.  Secifically the Shulchan Arukh in Choshen Mishpat 10:1 and 10:2(as well as other places), state that one should not rely too heavily on precedent, but rather should treat each case as it's own entity.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I believe there are two, closely related, reasons for why we look to written rabbinical decisions for halachic precedence, but we do not look to previous court decisions.</p>\n\n<p>The first reason is  that, generally speaking, a court does not issue a detailed explanation of how they came to their decision. Such an explanation is essential for using the decision as a precedent. Real-world cases are, almost without exception, extremely complex, and even apparently minor details can have a major impact on the final decision. Thus, even when two cases appear to be very similar, without knowing the exact details of the case and the reasoning used by the rabbis on the court, there is no way to make use of a court decision as a halachic precedent.</p>\n\n<p>A second factor that makes it problematic to use court decisions as precedent is that a court may reach a final decision without the judges actually agreeing on the reason. For example, a court may find John Doe liable for damages to his neighbor, but the judges, while agreeing on the final judgement, need not necessarily agree on the reasoning. So, again, without a clearly presented explanation of how and why they came to their conclusion, there is no way to make use of the precedent.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is the ketuba enforceable in American law?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Ketuba is written in Aramaic, so it might not be easily understood by an English-speaking judge; however, it is still a contract. On the other hand, the ketuba is not (necessarily?) signed by either party to the marriage, and only by a couple of witnesses.</p>\n\n<p>If a couple gets divorced, could the woman sue the man in an American court for her ketuba?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Quick answer:  Yes and no.  Any religious or doctrinal aspects of a <i>kesubah</i> itself cannot be enforced under American laws because of Constitutional issues involving the free exercise and establishment clauses to the First Amendment.  However, courts have and can enforce strictly secular sections of <i>kesubahs</i> or separate secular agreements between a Jewish couple provided that the court is not asked to interpret Jewish law or do the work of the Jewish court.  E.g. a court can't force a husband to give his wife a get.  Nor can it enforce payment terms under a <i>kesubah</i>.  But, many state courts have ruled that if courts can apply neutral areas of law to the issue, rather than intepreting religious doctrine, then courts have jurisdictin to, or example, enforce a pre-nuptual agreement that requires a husband and wife to seek mediation through a beis din, or force the husband to pay $100 per month in child support for each month he fails to appear before the beis din.  </p>\n\n<p>Background:  Courts have interpreted the First Amendment broadly to severely circumscribe the role that civil courts may play in resolving disputes concerning issues of religious doctrine and practice. <i>E.g. DeCorso v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc.</i>, 829 A.2d 38 (Conn. App.), cert. denied, 837 A.2d 805 (Conn. 2003). By contrast, exercise of governmental authority is permissible if it (1) has a secular purpose, (2) neither inhibits nor advances religion as its primary effect and (3) does not create excessive entanglement between church and state. <i>Lemon v. Kurtzman</i>, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971). </p>\n\n<p>Freedom of religion is guaranteed not only to individuals but also to churches, and church organizations, which have “power to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church government as well as those of faith and doctrine.” <i>Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral</i>, 344 U.S. 94, 116 (1952). </p>\n\n<p>Connecticut and New Jersey courts have found that they could enforce a provision under Moslem law where couples in Iran had entered into prenuptual agreements calling for the husband to give the wife a <i>mahr</i> -- a large amount of money -- at the wedding, and additional sums during the marriage.  Since no money was paid at either times, the wives in both cases sued for the promised funds after the divorce, and the courts found they could resolve the issues using neutral legal principles.  <i>Lashgari v. Lashgari</i>, 496 A.2d 491 (Conn. 1985); <i>Odatalla v. Odatalla</i>, 810 A.2d 93 (N.J.Super. 2002). </p>\n\n<p>In 1926, a New York Appellate Division court upheld the trial court's jurisdiction to enforce a <i>kesubah's</i> provision that the wife could not be evicted from her home by her step-children following the death of her husband.  <i>Hurwitz v. Hurwitz</i>, 216 A.D. 362 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d 1926).  Also, the case of <i>Avitzur v. Avitzur</i>, 446 N.E .2d 136 (N.Y.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 817, 104 S.Ct. 76 (1983), the court held that it had jurisdiction to rule on secular sections of a <i>kesubah</i>.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, the Rabbinical Council of America and other rabbinic organizations have urged couples to enter into pre-nuptual agreements which require, in the event the couple files for divorce in secular court, that they agree to mandatory arbitration before an Orthodox Jewish beis din (which may require the husband to provide his wife with a <i>get</i> (Jewish divorce decree).  Such contracts have been upheld in Connecticut, Illinois, California, Georgia, Maryland and Colorado.

Consider for example in 1974 a widow tried\n  to collect the amount of her husband’s ketubah and claimed that\n  the ketubah superseded her prior waver of any future claims\n  pursuant to a pre-nuptial agreement between herself and her\n  husband. The ketubah had been signed after the pre-nuptial\n  agreement, and thus, if it were a valid contract, would have\n  superseded it. In denying her motion, <strong>the New York Supreme\n  Court concluded that “even for the observant and Orthodox, the\n  ketubah has become more a matter of form and a ceremonial\n  document than a legal obligation.</strong>”</p>\n  \n  <p>Although the New York Court of Appeals, in a subsequent case,\n  enforced a provision of the ketubah pursuant to which the\n  parties agreed to arbitrate future marital disputes before a bet\n  din, the court did not revisit the issue of the enforceability\n  of the financial obligations included in the ketubah. While it\n  is true that in dicta, an Arizona court suggested that financial\n  obligations described in a ketubah could perhaps be enforceable\n  if described with sufficient specificity, the practice has\n  never been to seek to conform the text of the Ketubah to the\n  contract requirements of American law. <strong>The description of the\n  financial obligations</strong> — in <em>zuzim</em> and <em>zekukim</em>, which require\n  determinations of Jewish law to ascertain the proper value — <strong>are\n  not be considered sufficiently specific to be enforceable. So\n  too the absence of an English text</strong> (where either the husband or\n  wife are not fluent in Aramaic and Hebrew) <strong>and the absence of\n  signatures of the husband and wife, would seem to make the\n  ketubah void as a contract in American law.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Worth checking out the original article to see the exact legal cases cited in the footnotes.</p>\n\n\n",

If the Torah says that marriage ends with death or divorce, it would be a grave overreach of the rabbis to end it otherwise, i.e. with \"annulment\", in cases where the marriage was valid and there was no divorce ceremony.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is an extensive topic. Your suggestion is similar to that of <a href=\"https://ots.org.il/torah-lights-shoftim-5775/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Riskin</a> which was debated by both Rabbi Zalman Nechemia Goldberg and Rabbi Jeremy Wieder.

The essential point he makes is that there is no precedent for retroactively uprooting a marriage without some form of divorce document, except when allowing a woman to return to her husband. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Actually, your assumption is not so true - <strong>A Bais Din CAN potentially invalidate a marriage, it is just not practiced today</strong>. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The underlying reason is pretty simple, if [most of] the Poskim see the Kiddushin as a mere monetary Kinyan (as opposed to some that claim Kinyan Issur or a mixture of both), then the rule that \"הפקר בית דין\" should surely work. So a Beis Din can invalidate the deal of Kinyan and therefore the whole Kiddushin.</p></li>\n<li><p>A less viable option is to claim \"כל דמקדש אדעתא דרבנן מקדש ואפקעינהו רבנן לקידושי מיניה\" (Ketubos 3a) but this requires a consensus on what דרבנן means, usually, it does not mean \"a specific BD\" but \"the general Halachic consensus\". In that case, if the Kiddushin ceremony was truly Kosher there's no way to cancel it as everything went \"אדעתא דרבנן\" so we have to find a loophole in the ceremony (secular witnesses, drunk Rabbi, the ring purchased with a credit card, the bride was unconscious etc. :)</p></li>\n<li><p>A more serious question is what BD can do that, and what empowers a particular BD to invalidate a marriage. As the marriage itself is not authorized by a BD (only 2 witnesses), so the husband can always say \"I'm not subordinate to that BD at all.\". Theoretically, only the High Sanhedrin or at least the Tribe's Sanhedrin can obligate a person which is nonexistent today.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Just think of it, you buy something in Texas and a week later get a letter from the Lubavitcher BD in NY that the sell is invalidated. Do you care?</p>\n\n<p><em>My Personal NB: Interestingly, the Sages (though they could) did not obligate a couple to subordinate to a certain BD. In this case, we could use #1 and #2 more freely.</em></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Recognition of Chabad conversions\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have read and heard in certain places that among certain Orthodox groups, if one converts with Chabad-Lubavitch that their conversion will not be valid, if someone were to convert with Chabad and then decide later to join the Breslov movement, or Satmar. Would that person have to undergo conversion once more? I want to convert to Judaism and am currently at a Chabad shule but I have been becoming more interested in the Breslov movement, and there is no Breslov shule in my country, would I have to undergo conversion once more to be accepted fully in other Orthodox groups if I had converted with Chabad already?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I am a ger who converted with Chabad Beis Din and ,BH ,I am accepted in Satmar ( they invited me to simches and they brought me to speak to their rebbe) I am also accepted in the yeshivis world ,got alyot in their shuls</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In Breslov specifically we are careful to adhere to the Rebbe's words and avoid any unnecessary stringencies. As such, a conversion by a shomer Shabbos beis din that involved bris mila, mikvah, and sincere and total kabalos mitzvos would <em>generally</em> be seen as valid to <em>most</em> Breslov communities and individuals. </p>\n\n<p>All that said, to the best of my knowledge Chabad does not perform conversions. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I really feel for what you are going through right now. It is unfortunate but there are politics that surround even this issue at times. My suggestion is to work with your sponsoring rav and find the least controversial beis din as possible. I would suggest looking into what ou, young israel, and aish have to offer as far as the conversion process. After your gerus what hashkafah and community to chose to be a part of is up to you and isn't relevant to the ritual of the conversion process. There are three main components for conversion and only three that matter... 1.acceptance of all of the mitzvas and fundamental beliefs (13 principles of faith) 2. mikvah and 3. bris milah (or hatfas hadam habris). May G-d almighty bless you in your journey. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can Birchoth Keriath Shema' substitute for Birchoth HaTorah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Birchoth Keriath Shema' are able to substitute for Birchoth HaTorah in case one cannot remember if he said the latter, or in case one did not sleep and is in doubt whether or not he should say them.</p>\n\n<p>How can this be? There are a great deal of Divrei Torah recited prior to that point in the Siddur.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Tur (OC 46) had the same issue as you. He writes that the custom around him was to say Birkot haTorah and some Torah content before Pesukei deZimra but after reciting the \"Leolam Yehei\" and \"Attah Hu\" prayers which themselves contain Torah content including verses. Accordingly he changed his own practice to say Birkot haTorah immediately after Elohai Neshama at the very beginning of the day.</p>\n\n<p>However, other Rishonim (such as Agur (92)) do not have a problem with this set up because the verses are being recited דרך תחנונים by way of supplication, not דרך לימוד by way of learning. Indeed, by the fact that the Tur thought to change it, we see longstanding custom was in accordance with this view. The Gra records in his commentary to the below-cited Shulchan Aruch that in all the very old Siddurim or records of the order of prayer he could find, he saw that all of them place Birkot haTorah later.</p>\n\n<p>The Shuchan Aruch (OC 46:9) rules:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא יקרא פסוקים קודם ברכת התורה, אעפ\"י שהוא אומרם דרך תחנונים. ויש אומרים שאין לחוש, כיון שאינו אומרם אלא דרך תחנונים, ונכון לחוש לסברא ראשונה. הגה: אבל המנהג כסברה אחרונה<br>\n  One should not read verses before reciting Birkot haTorah, even though they are being said by way of supplication. And some say one should not worry about this because they are only said by way of supplication. And it is proper to worry about the first opinion. Gloss: But the custom is like the latter opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems there is strong traditional basis to not worry about saying verses by way of supplication before reciting Birkot haTorah.</p>\n\n<p>Now for the other position (which many Achronim view as a common/proper Chumrah (stringency) and not Ikar haDin (letter of the law)), I can imagine a number of possibilities as to how one might end up saying the blessings of Shema without reciting Pesukei deZimra:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You are late to minyan and skip all of Pesukei deZimra (ShA OC 52:1)</p></li>\n<li><p>You are stuck and can't daven Shacharit immediately after Keriat Shema but can later (ShA OC 64:10)</p></li>\n<li><p>You are exempt from Tefilla but not Keriat Shema (ShA OC 106:1)</p></li>\n<li><p>You against your will were unable to recite Keriat Shema at night and are saying it in the morning before sunrise (ShA OC 58:3)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At the very least the rule is relevant in case someone has already said Birkot Keriat Shema, even if you want to say he shouldn't have done so.</p>\n\n\n",

You have to be in good health to go on roller-coasters, to go sky diving, etc.  </p>\n\n<p>But Judaism is not just a physical religion of doing acts, it is spiritual as well.  A person who comes into contact with a corpse, even accidentally, contracts a spiritual impurity wherein his inherent sanctity is defiled and is restricted from entering the temple.  To take this a step further, a nazarite is someone who has accepted to maintain a higher level of sanctity and is restricted from coming into contact with a corpse altogether.  If he does accidentally, he must go through a process to re-begin his nazarite status because his high level sanctity was defiled- even though a regular Jew has no restriction of contact with a corpse (the exception being a Kohen who does in fact have a higher level of sanctity!)</p>\n\n<p>So, similar to ba, it is comprehensible, on a religious plane, that a \"bastard\" who has a lower sanctity status as a result of a spiritually forbidden relationship is restricted from forming a religious spiritual bond with someone of a higher status of sanctity.</p>\n\n<p>Of course if you look at everything on a physical plane it just sounds like the parents did a sin and now the child is restricted in who s/he cand spend life with.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>These are my thoughts on the subject:</p>\n\n<p>We are all obviously familiar with the concept of reward and punishment: When you do what G-d wants, He will reward you; when you do what He doesn't want, He will punish you (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0326.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lev. 26:3</a>).

Sin is not inherently bad — the only reason why G-d tells us not to do it is because the sin naturally hurts us, and so G-d makes the sin bad because a man naturally hates what is bad for him, and this now becomes bad for him (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Saadyah Gaon</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38325&st=&pgnum=97\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emunos VeDeos ch. 4</a>). </p>\n\n<p>The bad effect of sin is not a punishment; it is a natural consequence. You could really ask the same question about the punishment for an accidental sin — why do you need to bring a sacrifice for doing something <em>accidentally</em> (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0304.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lev. 4:2</a>)? It must be that the punishment for sin is just a natural consequence. And if someone sins, and through that sin a bastard is born, the things that happen to him are just a natural effect of things. Of course, they are not a punishment, since the son didn't do anything.</p>\n\n<p>I am not very knowledgeable in the subject of Jewish philosophy, though, so I am not sure if what I wrote is consistent with people other than Rabbi Saadyah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I do not know any classic authorities which discuss this but here is a take I believe to be consistent with Jewish thought.</p>\n\n<p>As noted in the linked discussion, the term bastard is a misleading translation. A mamzer is someone whose parents sexual relationship is inconceivable. The example I would use is that between a brother and a sister. We also apply this to adulterous relationships (though not to premarital relationships) but I think that a \"modern secular humanist\" can better relate to this concept as it pertains to the former case.</p>\n\n<p>First it is simply a reality that in a number of different ways parents decisions have long term consequences for their offspring. This isn't a matter of forgiveness or not. Jewish tradition is clear that a mamzer can be a great person despite their deficient lineage.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, it seems to me, that in order for an individual to do teshuvah (repent) they must regret their transgression. Yet when that very severe transgression led to the birth of a beloved offspring how can one regret such behavior.  Such regret becomes considerably easier to achieve when the inappropriateness of the child's conception is reflected in a deficient status.</p>\n\n<p>Another way of looking at it is, with or without such a prohibition, many people would have serious reservations about marrying someone whose parents were siblings. This isn't an issue of punishment but a natural discomfort with the situation, and the ruling mirrors this natural discomfort.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If one watches television on Friday night, will one go to hell?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If one watches television on Friday night, will one go to hell?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The laws of Shabbat apply only to Jews, so someone who isn't Jewish is doing no wrong whatsoever when they watch TV on Friday night.</p>\n\n<p>For Jews, as pointed out in the comments, there is a difference between turning on a television and watching it. Turning on the TV directly activates a flow of electricity, which mainstream halachic opinion (certainly as <em>I</em> have been taught it) considers forbidden by G-d as communicated to Moses in the Torah. While there is no question that switching an electrical current on or off on Shabbat is forbidden, what <em>exactly</em> is wrong with it is the subject of discussion. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12572/why-cant-electricity-be-manipulated-on-shabbat\" title=\"Why can't electricity be manipulated on Shabbat?\">this question</a> for more detail. </p>\n\n<p><em>Watching</em> TV on Shabbat, taken in isolation, is a transgression of the commandment to make Shabbat special, different and distinct from the week days. The source of this commandment is from the prophets whose communication from G-d came after and is subservient to what Moses taught. It is consequently a less severe transgression than actually turning the TV on, in the sense that the punishment is less (the Torah prohibition is punishable by death in the most extreme case, but not the Prophetic command), but is unequivocally equally binding and is taken equally seriously.</p>\n\n<p>Similar considerations about using electricity and making Shabbat mundane apply to turning on and/or listening to a hi-fi on Friday night. Basically, any forms of entertainment that use electricity or otherwise break Shabbat laws are also forbidden. Singing without a microphone, though, is practiced in synagogues and at Shabbat meals around the world as a beautiful expression of the <em>holiness</em> of the day. It can be profoundly moving and a highlight of the Shabbat experience. I recommend it.</p>\n\n<p>Whether one will \"go to hell\" for turning on or watching TV depends on the person doing it. The judgement of G-d takes into account <em>every aspect</em> of the person and his circumstances. As it says in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0532.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Deuteronomy 32:4\">Deuteronomy 32:4</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַצּוּר תָּמִים פָּעֳלוֹ<br>\n  כִּי כָל-דְּרָכָיו מִשְׁפָּט<br>\n  The Rock, His work is perfect;<br>\n  for all His ways are justice</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Specific mention is made of a person's <strong>upbringing</strong> by the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1181854/jewish/Chapter-3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"see Halacha 3\">Rambam</a>, who declares that a Jew who has not been raised to keep the commandments can <strong>not</strong> be considered a willful sinner. Such a person is classified as a <em>tinok shenishba</em>, a \"captured child\", as if they had been kidnapped from their Jewish family and raised by non-Jews. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinok_shenishba\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Tinok shenishba\">Wikipedia</a> has a reasonable summary.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, <em>to the degree</em> (measurable only by G-d, and possibly the person himself) that he <strong>chose</strong> (consciously / unconsciously, knowingly / in ignorance, deliberately / accidentally, under influence / on his own initiative) to transgress the command of G-d he will be punished. Nothing is ignored.</p>\n\n<p>This punishment is not imposed immediately, or else we'd all be struck by lightning as soon as a stray thought entered our heads. In fact, it is considered an expression of mercy on G-d's part that He delays punishment to give us an opportunity to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repentance_in_Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Teshuvah\">repent</a>. Repentance (<em>teshuvah</em> in Hebrew) is an essential, central and everyday concept in Jewish life. The Talmud states that the nature of man is such that without <em>teshuvah</em> he simply could not endure. The fact that we will sin is accepted, so it then falls upon us constantly to return to righteous behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>How does one do <em>teshuvah</em> according to the Jewish tradition? The <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911891/jewish/Chapter-Two.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"see Halachah 2\">Rambam</a> writes that three components are required: <strong>Regret</strong> that one did the sin, <strong>Commitment for the future</strong> not to repeat the sin, and <strong>Confession</strong> to G-d. Probably the hardest one is committing never to do that sin again, but it seems to me that can be a process rather than a binary decision. See the excellent answers to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4996/how-to-survive-if-you-are-hanging-on-to-some-aveiros\" title=\"How to survive if you are hanging on to some aveiros\">this question</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To apply these principles to your question: To repent for watching TV on Shabbat a person must accept and agree in their heart that they did wrong by turning on and/or watching TV. This means they wish they had not done it and if they could they would 'undo' the past. They must sincerely resolve never to do it again (which should include taking practical steps to avoid transgressing by accident or being overwhelmed by temptation). Finally they must confess aloud to G-d what they did, apologise, promise not to do it again, and ask for His help to keep His commandments in future.</p>\n\n<p>Repentance actually does have the effect of 'changing the past'. Someone who has done full <em>teshuvah</em> for some sin is considered as if he simply never did it, and it will not be held against him in his judgement. Further, the most profound application of repentance can actually result in a net <strong>gain</strong> in spirituality, not just a return to 'zero balance'. This is the concept of <em>teshuvah me'ahavah</em> - repentance motivated by intense love of G-d, rather than fear of Him. On the other hand, regret for past actions can also erase good deeds...</p>\n\n<p>Simply, if you do <em>teshuvah</em> you will not \"go to hell\".</p>\n\n<p>What if someone doesn't do <em>teshuvah</em>, or does only a partial <em>teshuvah</em>? Then their recompense will find them according to the decision of G-d. The punishment may be applied during their lifetime or afterwards. It is considered far better for a person to be punished while alive (\"in this world\") than after death (\"in the next world\"). This is because the nature of those two states affects the nature of the punishment. This world is ephemeral and of small worth compared to the Next, so punishment here is temporary and less encompassing. The spiritual world (also known as the World of Truth) is 'beyond Time' and is far more significant, for want of a better word, than this one, so punishment there is qualitatively worse. I am being vague, but these ideas are lofty and I understand them only a little.</p>\n\n<p>Punishment achieves atonement. Suffering is corrective and redemptive, rather than punitive. If I remember my <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Maharal\">Maharal</a> correctly, the disorder that a sinner brought to the world must naturally be visited on him if he does not do <em>teshuvah</em>, but once it has been imposed he is cleansed.</p>\n\n<p>About the nature of \"hell\": There does not seem to be a clear explanation of hell accepted by all Jews. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4467/do-we-believe-in-heaven-and-hell\" title=\"Do we believe in Heaven and Hell?\">this question</a> for opinions.</p>\n\n<p>My personal understanding, based primarily on teachings from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telshe_yeshiva#Rabbi_Yosef_Leib_Bloch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Rabbi Yosef Leib Bloch\">Rabbi Yosef Leib Bloch</a>, is that one's spiritual existence after death is not divided into separate \"places\", like Heaven, Hell or Purgatory. As I interpret it, after death a soul is faced with the life it led in totality. Like I said, the Next World is 'beyond time'. In this 'World of <strong>Truth</strong>' the true nature of a person's actions and his relationship with G-d is inescapable. There is no forgetting, ignoring or evasion. Your life is there before you, and your reward and/or punishment is to inescapably experience it on a spiritual level with all barriers to understanding and appreciation of your actions removed. To the extent this accords with the <strong>Truth</strong> it is blissful beyond description. And vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>The idea that you get 'points' for a <em>mitzvah</em> or lose them for an <em>aveirah</em> (sin) is disconcertingly unsophisticated. Firstly, no actions are overlooked. No deed can 'cancel out' another deed. What's more, an act can be at once both good and bad. All these calculations are taken into account by the immense depth of G-d's judgement.</p>\n\n<p>[Wipes froth from his mouth] Ahem.</p>\n\n<p>So, the answer to your question is... \"It depends\". It's relative. And it's not inescapable.</p>\n\n<p>If this question is actually applicable to you, and you are feeling guilty because you watched TV... relax. The G-d of the Jews is not out to get us. :-)</p>\n\n<p>He is a caring, loving and understanding Father who literally has our best interests at heart in the deepest way. He knows you beyond even what you know yourself and understands where you're at, where you're coming from and where you long to be. Rather than concentrate initially on the extensive body of instructions that apply to the Chosen People, strive to develop a personal relationship with Him in your own way. Talk to Him. Pour out your heart to Him. And listen for His answers in the things He brings your way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Jewish laws regarding \"work\" on the sabbath are complex and their application, especially into areas of modern technology require much study and the help of a local well educated teacher or mentor. However, one thing to remember -- in Judaism there is no concept of \"do X and go to hell.\" Not only is the Jewish notion of post-death \"punishment\" categorically distinct from the ideas in other religions, but with the possibility of sincere repentance, punishment on any level for a specific act isn't even inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>So we could go through the laws of watching television, listening to the radio, or such as they relate to turning on/off the electricity or engaging in behaviors which do not contribute to the sanctity of the day, but you would need to reconsider the underlying direct cause/effect relationship under which you are asking the question.</p>\n\n<p>Is there such a thing as \"sin\" for a Jew and does it have consequences? Yes</p>\n\n\n",

This includes the rules to apply the law.  Chain of authority is per Avot 1:1.  We don't make/revisit law today because that requires the Sanhedrin.  (Of course, we do continue to interpret law to account for new situations, but we don't overturn existing law.)</p>\n\n<p>Conservative: torah at Sinai (some say divine inspiration rather than divine authorship); process, authority as above.  However, we can derive law today even without the Sanhedrin, and even if it contradicts existing law, to take into account new information.  For example, the need for a second day of yom tov comes from calendar uncertainty that we no longer have, so we don't need to keep it.  A community follows its rabbi, as for Orthodox, but there can be more variation because the law body supports minority opinions.</p>\n\n<p>Reform: opinions about Sinai vary, ranging from \"happened as written\" to \"some sort of divine encounter that Moshe tried to put in words afterwards\" to \"literary device/metaphor, didn't happen\".  The ethical mitzvot are completely binding, per the prophets.  Individuals and communities have <em>informed</em> autonomy but are not supposed to pick and choose at whim.  There is probably more variety in this movement than the others in what people do and believe.</p>\n\n<p>In all of these I've described what movement leaders hold and teach.  When I was shopping for a synagogue, I asked rabbis of each movement what distinguished their movements and this is pretty much what they said.

    "content": "# What is the philosophy or logic for considering masturbation to be sinful?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are a couple of questions, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16052/if-masturbation-is-so-bad-why-is-it-not-in-list-of-613-mitzvos\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16522/does-the-act-of-masturbation-cause-a-change-in-ones-spiritual-religious-status\">here</a>, on this site mentioning masturbation.  Both of them assume that masturbation is a sin and some of the answers cite specific texts backing that up.  Nonetheless, I believe there is more room for discussion as to <em>why</em>, exactly, masturbation is considered sinful.  I think this is especially worthwhile, given the often claimed effect of masturbation to lower the libido and thus reduce the propensity toward other sexual sins.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that there are sources that say it is sinful. What I'm asking about is, why, given its \"calming effect\" of other sexual urges, should masturbation be considered sinful?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Tosafot (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=59b&format=pdf\">Sanhedrin 59B</a>) says that the commandment to \"be fruitful and multiply\" is not only a positive commandment, but a negative one as well. The prohibition aspect of the commandment is the injunction against masturbation.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, we can say that the philosophical reason why masturbation is considered sinful is because one is taking the potential to \"be fruitful and multiply\" and destroying it (The terminology Tosafot uses is <em>\"to destroy seed\"</em>.)  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Orthodox Judaism places canonical value on the Talmud's interpretation of the Law. The Talmud says that masturbation is wrong, in the beginning of the second chapter of Niddah.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously if one will inevitably do one of two improper things, one should choose the thing which is less improper. But that doesn't make it right.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>First, have to have on mind that when we stop to do some sin or star to do some mitzva is just because is a G-d commandment. We cant understand the logic of G-d. Even if we find some logical argument to stop, probably is gonna be wrong and is gonna have another logical argument in the future to bet the first one because our logic is too limited.</p>\n\n<p>So, my philosophy for why is a really bad thing for our humanity nature:</p>\n\n<p>Imagine in a pure scientifically view:\nIf the human being cant masturbate. Is phisicaly impossible. (example ...made our arms to short to touch there...dont know...). Also \nYou have 16 years old, the age that starts the strong sexual desires. And until there you never had a sexual relation and, of course, you never masturbate, because you cant and because even don't exist this concept in our world.\nOne day, you see a lot of beautiful(tzanuot), sympathetic, intelligent women on the street, on your work, on your school. Then, you go home and... you cant do nothing about all the women that are in your mind.\nThe next day same thing.. Same the next...\nOne day, you gonna start to explode inside and feel the natural need of talk with some women. Why?? because naturally you need to release. And your mind will know that if you dont start to talk, you gonna keep feeling this forever...</p>\n\n<p>If some kind of animal feel tired, it gonna sleep. Hungry, search some food. Thirst, search some water. A lot of libido, search a partner. If this kind of animal starts to ignore one of the natural desires. This specie will disappear after a while. This specie is gonna fail in the fight for survive.\nSo, scientifically, you are a specie of animal called human. And for your animal nature you shouldn't masturbate. </p>\n\n<p>But we are not just animals.\nG-d gave us the freedom to choice. You choose when you gonna sleep, what you gonna eat or drink, and with who you want to have sex. For what do you think is your best you gonna make all the choices. You can see that the best natural way of living for the human being is to be fat and spend all day in bed. But after a while, you gonna realize that this vision was immature and wasnt the best way to live.\nWe, am Israel, believe that we have a way to sleep, eat, drink, have sex, talk to other people, do business, etc...\nOnce, before the sin of Adam, all of this was natural for the human being. Now we have to choose things with our logic. And a lot of times we are wrong. Sometimes the scientists said that this kind of food is good for our body and mind, after a while they're saying that they we're wrong and this kind is bad.\nSo, because our logic is limited we have to follow whats the unlimited logic says.\nOne logical reason to not masturbate is to be the best human being.</p>\n\n\n",

Auerbach <em>zatzal</em> wrote me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm uncertain about someone with an hereditary disease whose descendants will be in pain all their days, or who suffers a blood-clotting disorder that passes to sons (hemophilia), whether he may therefore refrain from fulfilling the command to multiply, and can <em>l'chat'chila</em> marry a woman who is unable to give birth. After all, one need not spend more than a third or fifth of his assets even on a command that he could only fulfill now, and this man feels that the pain he and his children will have is worth much more than a third of his assets; but maybe it is not his place to investigate ways and means, and here, too [as by <em>Chizkiya</em>], we say \"what are you getting into God's ways for? What God wants, do\". I saw quoted from <em>Igros Moshe</em> that it's very obvious to him that one's obligated in fulfilling the command [to multiply], but to my mind it requires further investigation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51475&pgnum=74\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in chapter 2, note א‎(3), <em>Nishmas Avraham</em></a> has:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now I saw a responsum from Rabbi M. Feinstein <em>zatzal</em>, who writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>About a man of twenty-five with Marfan syndrome, badly enough that he's needed heart surgery and is blind in one eye, and, if he marries and has children, his children, as far as we can tell now, have a 50% chance of having the same disease, as to whether it's forbidden for him to marry a woman who can give birth, or, to the contrary, whether he must marry such a woman in order to fulfill the command to multiply — it is obvious to my mind that if he's able to land a woman who knows he has this disease (for of course he must tell her before the wedding…) he may and indeed must marry her in order to satisfy the command to multiply. After all, there is a possibility he will have children who are healthy and sound; it is appropriate that he should hope and pray to God for such children.…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Y. Zilberstein writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An engaged couple both of whom have defective chromosomes so that there's a chance they will have defective children — one should advise them not to marry one another. If they did, one should advise them to divorce. If divorce is difficult for them and they have not yet fulfilled the command to multiply, it makes sense that they are responsible for fulfilling it and should not consider the travails it will cause the offspring and themselves; about things like this is said \"yours not to deal with the secrets of creation: do what you're commanded\", and God will do what he deems best.…</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that two carriers of an autosomal recessive disease like Tay-Sachs have but a 25% chance of each of their children's having the disease, less than the 50% discussed by <em>Rav Moshe</em> (but that the 50% applies to a Marfan sufferer no matter whom he marries (except another Marfan sufferer)). I imagine Rabbi Zilberstein was discussing a case like that of Tay-Sachs.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>When I went for genetic testing, the secular geneticist told me that her rule of thumb was \"oh they'll just test each pregnancy and terminate the Tay-Sachs ones.\" Suffice to say that Rabbi Moshe Feinstein vehemently opposed that logic.

(Note that other rabbis are more lenient in some unfortunate cases.)</p>\n\n<p>I think the majority of Orthodox poskim today will tell you that two carriers really should look for other people to marry. It's the least-bad option. Hence the importance of checking for compatibility well before a relationship gets underway. (Rabbi Feinstein himself recommended finding one's carrier status as soon as one decides that s/he is \"seriously of dating age\", while the tests could be done earlier he didn't want more anxiety weighing on people. Today Dor Yeshorim removes the stigma by no one knowing their actual status.)</p>\n\n<p>Should a couple realize they're both carriers: Rabbi Feinstein had ruled \"if a man has a condition such that, regardless of who he marries, there's a 50% chance that his child will have medical problems but a life expectancy of several decades with treatment  ... he should have faith and get married\", with others questioning this. That's a far, far cry from saying that a couple who know there's a 25% chance any child they have won't survive preschool age should have \"faith.\"! </p>\n\n<p>In short:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A couple who know they're both carriers shouldn't get married.</li>\n<li>If they're already married and determine they're carriers, it's reasonable to question whether the mitzva to try to conceive conventionally would apply -- as the emotional cost here is so high.

I note that he doesn't seem to list the specific words in your picture as having uniquely shaped peh's, but I wouldn't be too worried as there are bound to be many different traditions in this matter.</p>\n\n<p>[For some other examples of different-shaped letters see the pictures <a href=\"http://ezerfamily.blogspot.ca/2012/01/blog-post.html\">here</a> and try searching Google.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I know this is a bit late, but some may find this useful:</p>\n\n<p>Israel Yevin says that \"rolled up pe\" (פ' לפופה) and other \"curved letters\" (אותיות עקומות) appear in Masoretic notes. He says \"such forms were only used in a few MSS. The rolled up pe, for instance, is much used in Yemenite MSS.\" (Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah, p. 48).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Baal HaTurim is one of the more famous commentators to focus on the unique forms of certain Hebrew letters. All the variations have deep mystical meaning to the words with contain them. In addition to the examples above, there are letters that contain extra Tagin like the word L'Totafos in Veyahafta.</p>\n\n<p>First I looked up this passage its from Parshas B'halosecha 14.9-10. There was no mention of the \"Rolled Pay\" but as Double AA mentioned above, different traditions could be the case. </p>\n\n<p>The Baal HaTurim's commentary on the \"Rolled Pay\" can be found first in Parshas Ki Sisa 31.17 on the word וינפש, which he says is an allusion to the 2 souls we receive on Shabbos. The Baal HaTurim says (in other places Devarim 1.7 IIRC) that the reason why the pay written this way is that the word should really be written twice for emphasis or that its meaning represents a concept of doubling. </p>\n\n<p>2 main sources of the Baal HaTurim are Sefer HaTagin and Machzor Vitri (which seems to simply republish Sefer HaTagin in the sefer. Sefer Tagin says there are 191 instances of the \"Rolled Pay\". These pays could very well be counted in the 191. </p>\n\n<p>I once heard a story from a Rabbi who lives in Tzfas and is a sofer. He said he once visited a sofer that has an entire room FILLED with Sifrei Torah. He opened one and say such beautiful amazing styles of writing letters. He asked the sofer why the variations suddenly stop in this Torah Scroll and the Sofer pointed around the room and said \"See all these? My job is to remove all of this\"</p>\n\n<p>Note: This seems to be written in Ksav Beis Yosef which is the main ksav of Ashkenazi Communities. I thought it might be Vellish (Sephardic) but only Beit Yosef (Ashkenaz) writes the Tzaddik with the yud facing the left.</p>\n\n\n",

As far as I can understand, the simple explanation why a mistaken sanctification by Beis Din was not binding in this case is because (as the Gemora in Rosh Hashana 20a explains) this is not applicable in a case of \"מיחזי כשיקרא\"; if it appears incorrect to the masses Beis Din does not have the power to manipulate the calendar per their wishes. However, he asks how it was possible in the first place to make such a mistake of five days, especially considering that they could have counted two weeks from the last full moon to have an idea when Rosh Chodesh would be. He explains that during Aaron HaCohen's lifetime they had no way of seeing the moon to sanctify because of the Clouds of Glory. Therefore they had no choice but to rely on the rule that even if the calculation is incorrect, the Beis Din's sanctification is binding. This is not considered \"מיחזי כשיקרא\" because no one would be able to see if they wrong. Ahron HaCohen passed away on Rosh Chodesh Av of the 40th year so that was the first date that they could santify the months based on sighting the moon and were concerned that their calculation may be off by a few days.</p>\n\n\n",

It's in the section that starts with Rav Avira saying that B'nei Yisrael were redeemed from Mitzrayim on account of the righteous women. First they would encourage their husbands in the mitzvah of p'ru ur'vu, then they would stay in their houses while pregnant, and then they would go to the fields to give birth. Hashem then sent malachim to tend the babies in the field. When these children perceived the revelation of Hashem at the splitting of the Yam Suf, they recognised Hashem as the one who had taken care of them in the field and they burst out singing, \"This is my God!\"  </p>\n\n<p>It's possible this aggadah is expanded elsewhere in a later midrash, but the source in Sotah was the first thing that I thought of. </p>\n\n<p>Addendum (added through later edit): Yes, Midrash Rabbah brings this midrash, too. In the Merkin edition (parashah 23, entry 8, on page 264), it begins with Rav Yehudah saying the same thing as recorded in Talmud Bavli Sotah 11b as mentioned above. The midrashic trigger seems to be to explain the pasuk clause, \"This is my God,\" Exodus 15:2. The idea is that saying \"this\" signifies recognition of something (or someone) previously encountered. Where had they seen Hashem before? When they were babies in the field and Hashem nursed them and took care of them via the malachim who reflected Hashem's splendor. </p>\n\n<p>I still cannot find (or remember) a source saying that the malachim resembled the babies' biological fathers but rather their \"Father\" in Heaven, Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>(Sorry - I'm working from old fashioned paper sources.

Why, then, is this not included in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noahide_laws\">Sheva' Mitzvoth Bnei Noaḥ</a>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The simple answer is that they aren't obligated (Sanhedrin 59b).</p>\n\n<p>As a general rule for understanding how the Talmud views learning these things from verses, anything said exclusively before Sinai is only for Jews (because there can't be anything that Jews are not obligated in but non-Jews are), but if it is said before Sinai <em>and</em> after Sinai, then it applies to non-Jews (as well as Jews) (this is covered in Sanhedrin 59a-b). And then there are things that are said in both places that only apply to Jews for technical reasons (of which Puru U'Rvu is one).</p>\n\n<p>All that being said, there are more obligations to non-Jews than just the seven. The seven kind of correspond to the 613. There are more obligations than the 613, but there is a meaning and reason behind that specific classification. In this case, one of the rules for inclusion in the 7 is that it has to be a negative commandment (\"sit and don't do\") - Sanhedrin 58b at the very bottom. Establishing courts of justice is included because it has a negative aspect (the Talmud - Sanhedrin 59a at the very top - doesn't elaborate what that is, but Rashi explains it as VaYikra 19:15 - לא תעשו עול במשפט - do not do injustice).</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (Chulin 92a at the bottom) refers to 30 Mitzvos for Bnei Noach, and some have claimed you can get <a href=\"http://www.milechai.com/judaism/bnai-noach.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">up to 66</a>. The whole question isn't well explored for historical reasons (there were limited practical Halachic questions in this regard over the years).</p>\n\n<p>So the upshot is: Puru U'Rvu is not a Mitzvah for Bnei Noach (at least according to that part of the Talmud, I don't know if that is the conclusion - so CLOR), even if it were it wouldn't be counted because it is a positive obligation (however, see the first Tosfos Sanhedrin 59b where it includes a negative aspect, but that follows the opinion that it is not a Mitzvah for Bnei Noach), and as long as it is a positive obligation there are many more potential obligations beyond the 7 (plus the Talmud in Sanhedrin lists individual opinions that include more than the 7 in the negatives).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The answer is because it was not repeated at Sinai, and any mitzvah which was said only once but not repeated is understood to be exclusively a Jewish mitzvah. (מצוה שנאמרה ולא נשנית, לישראל נאמרה ולא לבני נח--סנהדרין נט ע\"א). The reason for this is that there is nothing which is mutar for a Jew which is prohibited for a non-Jew (Sanhedrin ibid.). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Minchas Chinuch, mitzvah #1 mention one source who claims that mankind were indeed commanded (and obligated) in Peru Urvu but only until Matan Torah when this mitzvah was taken away from them (and put on the responsability of Am Yisroel). The reason is, perhaps, that once mankind's population increased so much they didn't need it anymore and since then the mitzvah only apply to jewish people who were small in number (Devorim 4:27 and 7:7).</p>\n\n\n",

If I (hypothetically) was the victim of constant abuse which lasted for years and I ultimately, in an act of self defense, had to kill my abuser (a close family member) would I still be expected to sit shiva and be constrained by other displays of aveilut? I <strong>wanted</strong> the person to be dead so I would think that mourning would be inappropriate -- I'd be celebrating having escaped the abusive situation and saving my own life.</p>\n\n<p>Would a pro forma shiva/aveilut be required regardless of the logic, propriety or sincerity behind the situation? While I can understand that there might be a sense of loss to the community or some metaphysical sadness because this person has lost the chance to do tshuva and return to his people, I as the victim would not want to mourn the loss necessarily.</p>\n\n<p>Does aveilut/shiva have to go along with a sadness or does it stand on its own as a requirement  regardless? Would a cold blooded murderer of a family member have to sit shiva (I understand the dissonance between being willing to take a life and still feeling bound by other halachot, but there are Jewish criminals who keep kosher in prison, so...)[any help in tagging would be appreciated..I can't find a tag for self-defense]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Yehoshua 6:26 - Yehoshua curses that whoever rebuilds Jericho should bury all his children - from the oldest when he starts to the youngest when he completes it.</p>\n\n<p>ארור האיש אשר יבנה את העיר את יריחו. בבכורו ייסדנה ובצעירו יציב דלתיה</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14263&st=&pgnum=176\" rel=\"nofollow\">Melachim 1 16:34</a> Chial Bais Ha'Aili rebuilds Yesricho and gets punished as per Yehoshuas curse.</p>\n\n<p>Metzudas David Melachim 1 17:1 says that Achav & Eliyahu went to be Menachem Chial Bais Ha'Aili upon the death of his children. </p>\n\n<p>From this you can see that if a father does something wrong and his child clearly dies for his sins, the father would still sit Shiva.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your initial understanding is incorrect: sitting shiva isn't an expression of bereavement. Even though the two usually come hand in hand, being happy about the death--for whatever reason--doesn't make one exempt from the laws of shiva. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, it's a question of halacha, and halacha in general isn't about your state of mind.

The instant that a parent's desires rise to conflict with a point of Halachah, the requirement for Kibbud falls away.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, I understand your desire not to upset your parents in any case, and my advice would be to explain to them that [Halachah X] is just what we do, and that you hope they will respect your choices.</p>\n\n\n",

So that would be option (c):</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועם כל זה נתמעטו הלבבות מרוב הצרות והוצרכו האחרונים לחבר אחריו דרך ביאור והרחבה <strong>ולפעמים דרך סתירה ותיקון כשהיו חכמי הדור מסכימים לכך</strong> ממה שרואים בו קושיא חזקה...וכן אמרו פרת חטאת אינה משנה...<strong>וכן תמיד איתמר חסורי מחסרא</strong> ...וכן הרבה כיוצא באלו כמו שנעשה היום אף אנחנו מראשינו וזקנינו הקודמים ועוברים לפנינו ועל ראשינו וכמ\"ש דרך כלל מקום הניחו לנו כו' כ<strong>לומר שאין השלימות נמצא בנבראים ואפי' במובחרים שבהם עד שלא יהיו אחרונים רשאין לחלוק עמהם</strong> בקצת דברים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, the P'at HaShulhan of R. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yisroel_ben_Shmuel_of_Shklov\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yisrael Shklover</a> cites the Vilna Gaon as opining that it is a way of disagreeing with the Mishna. However, unlike Meiri he adds that this was in following a variant Tannaic view. However, he does not say that that view had to be expressed in a Mishna, nor does he say how they knew it was a Tannaic view. The book Kol Eliyahu, however, claims he did not say this, but rather that they explained the true intent of the Mishna (a variation of (a), see below for many who espouse this position).</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The opposite sentiment is expressed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahya_ben_Asher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbenu Bahya</a> (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya,_Shemot.34.27.5/he/Midrash_Rabbeinu_Bachya_[ben_Asher]._Warsaw,_1878?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 34:27</a>) who emphasises that the expression does not connote any shortcoming whatsoever with the Mishna. Rather, it indicates the Ammoraim's shortcoming in that they failed to properly understand the Mishna:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומזה אמרו בתלמוד על המשנה: (ברכות יג ב) חסורי מחסרא והכי קתני, שאין הכוונה להיות המשנה חסרה כלל חלילה, אבל הכוונה שהיא חסרה אצלנו מפני חסרון שכלנו מפני שאין אנו מגיעים לעומק חכמת דור של חכמי המשנה, ולפיכך עשו רבינא ורב אשי פירוש על המשנה והוא התלמוד ובארו ספקות המשנה והאריכו לשונם על לשון המשנה העמוק והסתום </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He makes no mention of (a), clearly eschews (b), and the Meiri's (c). Rather, he seems to be explaining a variation of (a); that <em>people</em> were lacking in their ability to understand the Mishna, until they finally understood it. (Not that the Mishna necessarily intended to be brief, to facilitate memorization, or for some other reason).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Horowitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yeshaya Horowitz</a> writes very similarly in Klalei HaTalmud (10: Klal lamed: 205) in the name of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ibn_Verga\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sh'erit Yosef</a> (Netiv HaMishna Klal 5) in the name of R.

This is basically (a). (Except that he makes no mention of memorization. This differs from R. Bahya, R.

Specifically, the reference to טועה בגירסא indicates a transcription error, rather than an originally mistaken ruling.</p>\n\n<p>Significantly, elsewhere (3:2:14) he contrasts חסורי מחסרא; which involves emending the text of the Mishna with other methods which merely explain the intent.</p>\n\n<p>This is also clearly the view of the <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%97%D7%96%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hikrei Lev</a> (Vol. I OH 12) who writes that this idea clearly indicates the the Mishna was not written down, since otherwise one could merely compare printed versions of the Mishna to resolve the textual issue.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Lipschitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tifferet Yisrael</a> to Arakhin (Boaz 4:1) writes that the Mishnayot were associated with tunes to facilitate their memorization. For this reason the Mishna would sometimes leave something out, or phrase something in a particular way, to match the tune. This is a variation of (a). (In that it is to facilitate memorization, but he says nothing about it being internally obvious that something is left out.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Another variation of (a) is that of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Karo</a> (Klalei Hag'mara to Halikhot Olam 2:2): that there was memorized Mishnaic literature that preceded the compilation of the Mishna. Some mistakes crept into the memorized texts. When R. Yehuda HaNassi compiled the Mishna, he left these corruptions, and relied on the readers to correct the mistakes.

So we avoid stones or fancy engravings.</p>\n\n<p>THEREFORE, to avoid any chance of confusion, the recommended practice is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A ring.

According to this explanation, even platinum or white gold should be avoided, as they resemble silver. Having said that, there is no real <em>Halachah</em>, that I'm aware of, that it needs to be done this way, as long as it is certainly worth more than a Perutah.</p>\n\n<p>The only caveat to what I've said above, also mentioned by Shalom and sourced to Tosafoth <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18497/wedding-ring-composition#comment44843_18498\">in a comment by Moses</a>, is that if the bride believes she is being given something other than what she is receiving, it could possibly be a מקח טעות, or a fraudulent/erroneous transaction, which could conceivably void the entire Kiddushin. But, again, this is a safeguard, not a requirement, and as such it has developed into a Minhag in some circles (certainly Tosafoth imply that it was a Minhag at least in their locale/time, and possibly much more widespread than that, to at least avoid anything with jewels on it in case she thinks they are more valuable than they are; although Tos seem to be discussing quality of the gems, not real vs. fake - and it is possible, though I don't know for certain, that this much is codified as Halachah today).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hidabroot.org/CommunityDetail.asp?FaqID=15509\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hidabroot.org/CommunityDetail.asp?FaqID=15509</a></p>\n\n<p>This is a long kabalistic article of what to use for a wedding ring gold or silver.

    "content": "# Is a speeding driver who causes damage exempt from paying due to his status as a Roidef?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.needaneitzah.com/questions/118/would-a-person-who-crashes-into-another-car-whilst-speeding-be-exempt-from-paying\" rel=\"nofollow\">On this forum</a> they ask a very interesting question. What happens when a person who is driving a car is speeding, at a pace where a fatal accident could easily occur. He then crashes into another vehicle, but thankfully all the occupants are ok. The car however is irreparable. Does the speeding driver have to pay.</p>\n\n<p>The reason he could be exempt from paying is because perhaps he is considered a Roidef [pursuer] whilst driving because at any moment he could have killed someone. If he is considered a Roidef, then the law of <em>Kim Lei Bedraboh Minei</em> would apply and he would be exempt from paying. </p>\n\n<p>The reason he would have to pay could be for one of the following two reasons. Either it is not relevant here because he had no intent to kill, or perhaps the percentage of speeding drivers killing people is not high enough to be considered a Roidef.</p>\n\n<p>What is the Halacha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Yes, he's liable. Here's one reason why.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone agrees that a third-party <em>rodef</em> (\"pursuer\") is not subject to <em>kim lei bideraba minei</em> (apply the greater punishment), as the <em>rodef</em> is not \"liable to the death penalty.\" Rather, we do whatever is necessary to save the \"pursued\", with lethal force authorized only if needed. The bystander who shoots in the heart when he could just have easily shot the <em>rodef</em> in the leg (let's assume this is an absolutely expert marksman) is considered a \"murderer.\"</p>\n\n<p>The more interesting question is if we look from the \"pursued\"'s perspective: we also find the rabbinic phrase -- <em>haba lehorgecha, hashkem lehorgo</em> -- <em>if someone is out to kill you, kill them first.</em> Many <em>Achronim</em> take that to mean that there is more authorization for lethal force to protect <em>yourself</em> than there is to protect a <em>third party.</em></p>\n\n<p>THEREFORE: Rabbi Akiva Eiger asks a related question in <em>drush vechidush.</em> The <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=21\">Torah says</a> that if one man strikes another; if the victim dies, then it's murder and liable to capital punishment. If he lives, then the aggressor just pays for damages. Asks Rabbi Akiva Eiger: so Joe is standing there with a knife yelling at Bob, \"I'm going to kill you!\" If Bob is completely authorized to defend himself with lethal force, then Joe is deserving of death; therefore if the stab wound is non-lethal, why must Joe pay? <em>Kim lei bideraba minei</em>! Rabbi Akiva Eiger therefore rejects the premise that <em>hashkeim lehorgo</em> is any different than standard <em>rodef</em>, i.e. you are obligated to use minimum force in exactly the same way whether you are defending yourself or another. Because you are obligated to <em>not</em> use lethal force unless absolutely necessary, we don't consider a <em>rodef</em> to be \"liable at this moment to the death penalty.\"</p>\n\n<p>Later Achronim (IIRC R' Chaim Ozer Grozinski?) reply that the law of <em>hashekm lehorgo</em> is not so much an <em>authorization</em> for lethal force in the case of self-defense, as much as <em>psychological exemption</em> (<em>ones rachmana patrei</em>) as we can't demand people think that carefully with a gun in their face. But either way, the \"pursuer\" is not currently doing something that is \"punishable by the death penalty\" per se; hence, <em>kim lei bideraba minei</em> does not apply.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Time dilation and waiting between meat and milk\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Suppose Ploni eats some meat. He then gets in a spaceship and accelerates to some significant percentage of the speed of light for a short trip into outer space, and then returns home. At the time when he returns home, exactly six hours have passed from the Earth's reference frame; however, because of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/time_dilation\">time dilation</a>, less than 6 hours have passed for him.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an issue of who is right.  On Earth, six hours have <em>actually</em> passed, whereas for Ploni, the amount of time has <em>actually</em> been less than six hours. Now that he has returned home, may he eat something with milk?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 22)\n\n<p>The short answer is no. Waiting between consuming meat and consuming dairy has nothing to do with how much time we perceive to have elapsed but with the experience of the person who consumed it. Spaceman Ploni, who decided to eat meat immediately prior to takeoff (a revolting thought), can still taste it when he returns to earth, despite the fact that his more sensible brother, who ate meat with him but who didn't board the space-ship, is now enjoying a milkshake.</p>\n\n<p>Source:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Rambam, <em>Hilkhot Ma'akhalot Asurot</em> 9:28, which gives the reason for waiting six hours as being because of food that is still between the teeth (although see the Kesef Mishna there);</p></li>\n<li><p>Tur, YD 89:1, which gives the reason as being because of the flavour of the meat that remains in the mouth.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>If he eats meat, gets onto a fast plane and flies east, and lands before six hours have elapsed for him, I don't think anybody would say that he can now eat dairy just because the clock shows a later time.  For that matter, he doesn't get to jump the gun when switching to Daylight Saving Time.  (But citation needed.)  I would expect the same logic to apply to actual time dilation -- until it's been six hours (or whatever his custom is) <em>for him</em>, it doesn't count.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to the <em>P'ri Chadash</em> (89:6), six hours is not meant literally, and a person should just wait from one meal until the time for the next meal. In the winter, the <em>P'ri Chadash</em> writes, this could be approximately four hours. (Disclaimer: I haven't noticed many people follow this opinion in practice).</p>\n\n<p>It seems reasonable to interpret the <em>P'ri Chadash</em> as understanding that you simply wait until the time for the next regularly scheduled meal. As such, let's say six hours passed on Earth (during the springtime, for example) and four hours passed for the astronaut. He might decide to eat at the scheduled meal time on Earth. Perhaps the <em>P'ri Chadash</em> would consider this acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>A more immediate application of this question would perhaps involve an airplane trip from west to east (e.g. during spring). Let's say the flight is four hours and the destination is two time zones ahead the departure location. Perhaps the <em>P'ri Chadash</em> would allow the passenger to eat a dairy meal for supper in Chicago four hours after he ate a meat meal for lunch in Los Angeles.</p>\n\n<p>Note also the reasoning given by the <em>P'ri Chadash</em> in 89:2, which suggests that there must still be a significant amount of time that elapses for the eater before he eats a dairy meal, so it is not possible to assume that the <em>P'ri Chadash</em> would permit any duration shorter than approximately four hours.</p>\n\n\n",

Being that the אמ''ה is previously אסור because of אמ''ה, it cannot further receive the איסור of בשר חלב (or any other איסור, for that matter). Furthermore, even נבילה itself if cooked with milk will not be בשר בחלב, as is explained by the רמב''ם in the third chapter of מסכת כריתות, fourth Mishna. His point applies to אמ''ה also; no איסור can be חל on any other איסור unless it adds on more people or things in the איסור (i.e. מוסיף וכולל), and being that בשר בחלב is in essence a prohibition from eating (even though it is also אסור בהנאה) it cannot be חל on another איסור אכילה like אבר מן החי or נבילה.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ויש בדברינו אלה נקודה נפלאה נעיר עליה, לפי שהיא מפתח לענינים אחרים נוסף למה שיש בה מדייוק העיון, והיא, מן הידוע שבשר בחלב אסור בהנאה, והחלב דרך משל מותר בהנאה, ואם בשל החלב בחלב מה טעם לא יחול אסור בשר בחלב על אסור חלב, והוא הדין בנבלה, בהיותו אסור מוסיף כמו שאמרנו כאן בחלב הקדשים וחייבנו על אכילתו מעילה מחמת שנוסף בו אסור הנאה, ו*<em>התשובה לכך שבשר בחלב לא נאסר בהנאה אלא מחמת שאסר הכתוב אכילתו לפי הכלל שבארנו שכל שנאסר באכילה נאסר ליהנות בו עד שיפרוט לך הכתוב</em>*, ואין בו פסוק האוסר אכילתו ופסוק האוסר ליהנות בו, אלא שני הדברים יחד הם אסור בשר בחלב, וכיון שאמרנו אין אסור חל על אסור ולפיכך לא יחול אסור בשר בחלב על אסור נבלה הרי לא יהא אסור בהנאה אלא יהא מותר בהנאה והאוכלו לוקה משום נבלה, וירד אסור בשר בחלב לגמרי לפי שלא חל</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Ar., EH 2:5<a href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch/Even_ha-Ezer/2\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> [translation here]</a>) that if a person learns that one of the progenitors of a particular family is tainted by mamzerut, he may not reveal this, \"but rather he should allow the presumption of their legitimacy to remain intact, for all the families that have become assimilated into Israel are legitimate in the future.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Even prior to that, there was no sine qua non nature to animal blood as it relates to atonement. Biblically, only a small selection of sins could be atoned for via sacrifice, and even those could be removed through other means. We take our cue from Hosea 14:3 (some have it as verse 2) where the words of our lips (prayer, and especially the verbal recitation of the sacrificial order) substitute for the actual sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>The actual requirements for repentance go far beyond a simple sacrifice even when a sacrifice is efficacious. Regret, recompense, confession, an acceptance of blame, a decision not to repeat the action are all necessary elements to a full repentance.</p>\n\n\n",

(Both religious and non-religious perspectives welcome.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Hatred has many sources. And sometimes it seems to have none.</p>\n<p>One could attribute it to a divine decree, or to biblical stories which pit people against people. Or you could look at historical or sociological trends. Here is a random selection of \"reasons\":</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Jews are separate and distinct. When any group defies the will of the masses or the powerful, it is resented.

Judaism is the very source and origin of both Christianity and Islam. How then can anyone from those faiths disrespect that which gave birth to most of what they believe about the very nature of the universe and their roles within it? I just don't get it, either intellectually and most certainly not emotionally.</p>\n\n<p>Yet at another more abstract level, I think I do understand part of what is going on. Most of us go through our lives feeling like we have been cheated in some way, perhaps by our situation, or perhaps by those who raised us, or just by people in general. Not many of us get to have such perfect and gilded lives that we never have the desire to think \"why did this happen to me? why is my life so unhappy?\"</p>\n\n<p>Once such questions arise, everyone is forced to deal with them one way or another. Unfortunately, even within religious faiths that teach many aspects of how people should treat one another, the incredible importance of how we deal with our own perception of unfairness is often simply overlooked. We choose without realizing it, often simply by imitating those around us.</p>\n\n<p>One choice is to realize others are suffering also, and then asking, \"I wonder if there is some way I can help others?\"</p>\n\n<p>At the other end of possible responses is this question: \"I wonder who is to blame for my troubles?\"</p>\n\n<p>These are both answers that are self-reinforcing. If you try to help others and succeed, most people find it an experience that is astonishingly rewarding, often in spite of all expectations to the contrary.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose instead to look for the real source of your troubles, you always will. And the strange thing is, when you find it, it will always look like some kind of strangely distorted reflection of yourself. Everything you don't like about yourself somehow becomes a part of this thing that you have chosen as the source of your problems. The more that happens, the more certain and firm you become in your belief that \"<em>There</em> is the source of all my woes! <em>There</em> is the reason why I am so cruel to others, so hateful to my own children, so prone to failure in all that I do! If only <em>that</em> was not around, I would be so much happier with myself, and so much less miserable!\" The blurrier the vision of <em>that</em>, the less understood and familiar it is, the easier it becomes to project all of your own failures into it.</p>\n\n<p>\"That\" doesn't even have to be a person. But of course, too often... it is.</p>\n\n<p>Why are Jewish people so often selected in the Western world to become sources and even the very incarnations of their woes, the sources of everything they see as wrong in the world around them? Because Judaism is the oh-so-close yet strangely baffling relative that most people have never really met and certainly don't understand. They are not strangers from afar, like Buddhists or Confucians or Zoroastrians, who seem so different that they are more like plants and scenery viewed while passing through a garden. They go their way, and you go yours, and you seldom stop to think about it.</p>\n\n<p>But the Jewish people are the tenders of the garden. They are there, they are known, and they are deeply a part of it. But they do not look quite the same, act quite the same, talk quite the same. They there and yet they are apart, and the very joy that many of them have in that separateness can be baffling to others traveling through that garden.</p>\n\n<p>If you have chosen a path of saying \"how can I help?\", meeting the gardeners and getting to know them better becomes a great joy to you also.</p>\n\n<p>But if instead someone has chosen one of the many, many paths of searching for <em>who is to blame?</em>, then all to often they end up searching for someone enough like themselves to project all the evils they have perceived onto them, yet different enough that they never know them as personal friends or people with which they share a meal, a joke, a laugh.</p>\n\n<p>And in choosing such a path, sadly, I think lies much of the reason for the deep and terrible evil -- it is just that, make no mistake and call it nothing less -- that has expressed itself with such particular persistence over the centuries in the treatment of Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rashi Genesis 33:4 says the Halacha is Esau hates Yaacov. This can be understood that this is Halacha and not dependent on external factors. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemoro also says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Chisda and Rabbah the son of Rav Huna both said: Why is it called\n  \"Sinai\"? Because it is the mountain from which hatred (Hebrew: sinah)\n  came down to the Nations-of-the-World ... (Shabbos 89a)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>so again it seems that it is not dependent on the happenings or the cultures of the world.</p>\n\n\n",

I understand the first bit about healing (I assume that this is a general reference to the prohibition against medicine due to grinding), but the second part is strange. It seems from here that the prushim agreed that lifting a sheep out and helping it is not a problem.</p>\n\n<p>I am rather confused by this. Does it mean that there was an eruv or similar, and that one really is allowed to do quite a bit to ease the pain of animals on shabbat (the only exception that I had heard of before this was milking dairy cows)? Or is there something else that is going on in this quote?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I believe that the people that were being spoken to here were the prushim (Pharisees), who I believe had the right mesora and everything, and from whom Jews today come.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dinonline.org/2011/09/13/cruelty-to-animals-halachos-of-tzaar-baalei-chayim/\">http://www.dinonline.org/2011/09/13/cruelty-to-animals-halachos-of-tzaar-baalei-chayim/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Elsewhere, however (Shabbos 128b), with regard to the laws of muktzeh\n  on Shabbos, the Gemara states that the prohibition is a Torah law.\n  Where an animal has fallen into a pit, and cannot be fed, one may\n  assist it to ascend by placing cushions under it.

Would it be as simple as just making sure the limbs of the animal are intact upon slaughter?</p>\n\n<p>Since bnei Noach food is mostly a superset of Jewish kashrut, I would think most kashrut and shechita laws pertain only to Jewish laws and that it wouldn't focus on bnei Noach shechita laws as much or at all(sadly).</p>\n\n<p>I personally indirectly solve this by staying away from pig meat, but technically I would think I could consume pig meat. Same thing with shellfish, etc.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is a great question that highlights the differences between the halachah for a ben Noach and the halachah for Am Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>I think that it is worthwhile to ask this question l'maaseh to a posek who has some familiarity with the laws for the bnei Noach but...</p>\n\n<p>While it might seem that it is safest to purchase kosher meat to avoid any issue of <em>ever min haChai</em> (the prohibition against eating a limb from a living animal, the \"<em>kashrus</em>\" issue for <em>B'nei Noach</em>), it is not clear that this is automatically the case.  According to some authorities although a Jew is permitted to eat meat taken subsequent to the two <em>simanim</em> (signs) of <em>shechita</em> (slaughter) being severed, while it remains prohibited to a <em>ben Noach</em> as long as the animal moves (<em>Rambam</em> in the <em>Mishneh Torah</em>, <em>Hilchos Melachim</em> 9:12,13, the footnote in the Moznaim English translation explains that the <em>Rashba</em> and others rule that a non-Jew is not liable in the circumstance where a Jew isn't based on Hullin 121b).</p>\n\n<p>Practically however, State and Federal laws in the United States regarding slaughter would prevent commercially produced meat from being taken while an animal is still alive. Although I'm not sure we can apply concepts such as <em>Rov</em> or <em>Chazakah</em>  in the framework of the <em>Sheva Mitzvos B'nei Noach</em>, nevertheless it seems to me reasonable that one can rely on the government in this situation insofar as they are effectively exercising their obligation to set up \"court\" which prevent taking an \"<em>ever min haChai</em>\". As such it would seem permissible for a B'nei Noach to purchase pork sold commercially in the stores. Furthermore the Rambam rules (<em>ibid</em> 10:1) that with the exception of murder a non-Jew is not liable for an inadvertent transgression (<em>b'shogaig</em>).</p>\n\n<p>With regard to shellfish it would not seem to be a concern because it is not clear that the prohibition applies to fish at all. The Rambam understands the prohibition as not applying to poultry/fowl (ibid 9:11). Though the Rava'ad (see Moznaim <em>ibid</em>) disagrees, he exempts a <em>sheretz</em> (creeping creature), and it is would seem seafood is just out of the equation. Additionally shellfish are often sold live, whole, or effectively whole/clearly \"slaughtered\". If there is reason to be concerned about <em>ever min haChai</em> regarding seafood it shouldn't be difficult obtaining seafood whose suitability is evident.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>as a ben Noach, you don't need shchita. all you need is the animal completely dead. <br />\nany way, you can't do shechita to a pig, simply because his anatomy is different. <br />\nabout shell fish, I think they are just fish, and there for you don't need to be shochet them even if you are jewish.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>I actually would disagree that NO dietary laws are required for Bnei Noach, for as I read, the Torah states, \"every living thing THAT MOVES...shall be food for you, etc.\"; therefore, there may be implied a prohibition against the consumption of true shell-fish, meaning those which live within actual shells, and are immobile, i.e. do not move; ex. mollusks (clams, oysters, mussels, avelone, etc.), and also see a clear prohibition against not simply the limb from a living animal(which I see no actual prohibition against, though it is clearly understood that this would be prohibited simply by reason of even the morality of the average Gentile), rather the prohibition is more akin to the tradition maintained by Halal of the Muslims, being the prohibition of eating red(living cells, filled with LIVING bacteria and viruses), un-drained, uncooked bloods.\n There are also deeper levels of interpretation that allude to the \"food\" of \"supernal Torah\", and the prohibition against \"using for food\", encapsulated parts of the Torah (shell-fish) as a means of spiritual nourishment. If one wishes to be \"fit\" for HaShem's Kingdom, one must \"eat\" from only those \"living things\" that may be found \"moving\" throughout the T\"N\"K\" entire...i.e. one may not pick and choose from the parts one likes, removing them from their original context; and this applies to \"foods\" that \"move\" along the face of the ground, that is the clear, and literal reading of the Torah(Peshat), as well as those that one has to go \"fishing\" for, in the deep waters of the supernal Torah(Sod).</p>\n\n\n",

However, the help we would expect to give would be charity and thus would not be repaid. If tzeddakah is actually a gift, why would anyone not give it in the 6th year because of shmittah? There should be no expectation of repayment that would be nullified by shmittah. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9979/showrashi/true#v8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi in pasuk 8 (vha'avet ta'avitenu)</a> confirms that the initial offer we should make should be a gift and only turn it to a loan if the recipient won't accept a gift.

That is charity wrapped in a loan. However, for the sake of making it a real loan, the lender has real rights to collect the money, it just isn't supposed to happen.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your comment, yes a loan can be preferable to giving (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/957872/jewish/The-Mitzvah-of-Giving-Loans.htm#footnote5a957872\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to the Gemara (Makkos 4b IIRC), the only loans which are forgiven are those that are past due.

Additionally, what are the documents that are not considered canonical but are well respected?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>This is not meant to be a conclusive answer of all books written, but it so happens that a large majority of them are centered around the structure of 4 very important works, either as commentaries or summaries. Recognizing references to these four works can help you locate and gain some understanding of what a quoted work is.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tanach</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tanach contains the 24 books of the Bible, which are divided into three groups: Torah, Prophets and Writings. Each book is generally referenced by chapter and verse number, eg. Haggai 2:4. You can access all of the Tanach in Hebrew with an English translation here <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0.htm</a>.</p>\n<p>Commentaries to Tanach are often discussing the stories and morals contained within and are usually less focused on the precise legal outcomes. A commentary would often be cited by the verse it comments on, eg. Rashi to Ezekiel 23:6.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mishna/Talmud</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishna\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna</a> is the oldest and most basic text in the oral law. There are 63 books within it, which can be cited by chapter and paragraph, eg Peah 4:2. Two important and old commentaries upon it are the two Talmuds (Babylonian and Jerusalem). The Talmuds only exist on certain books in the Mishna, and are generally cited by page number in the standard printings, eg Shabbat 155b (note that 'pages' here includes both sides of the physical page, hence the 'a' or 'b').</p>\n<p>The Mishna and Talmud are free flowing discussion about legal and moral concepts. A commentary to it would also likely be discussing those things and would be cited by the page it is commenting on. The Talmuds are considered highly authoritative and in many cases are the starting ground for any discussion. The Babylonian Talmud can be found in English at <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://halakhah.com/</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rambam</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rambam (AKA Maimonides, 1135-1204) compiled the first (or at least, earliest to be so accepted) pure legal codex which removed all the legal back-and-forth and laid down straight law, covering all aspects of Jewish law. His <em>magnum opus</em>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishneh_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah</a>, contains 14 general-topical divisions, each containing a number of books on specific topics, which are cited by chapter and paragraph, eg Rambam [Hilchot] Shecheinim 3:2. By doing so, the Rambam revolutionized study in a way leading to a whole wealth of commentaries on his work discussing his conclusions.</p>\n<p>Rambam and his commentaries are usually cited as important background for legal discussions, but usually not conclusively. For the entire Mishneh Torah in English, see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/682956/jewish/Mishneh-Torah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/682956/jewish/Mishneh-Torah.htm</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tur/Shulchan Aruch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another legal codex, written a few centuries later and compiling more sources in doing so, was the Tur. The Tur developed its own commentaries including one by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Caro\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Joseph Caro</a> who eventually resummarized his conclusions following the sectioning of the Tur into the Shulchan Aruch. Nearly all final legal rulings develop around the Caro's rulings as well as the commentaries surrounding his work, first and foremost among them, those of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rema\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Moses Isserles</a>.</p>\n<p>The Tur is divided into 4 sections: Orach Chaim, Yoreh Deah, Even Haezer and Choshen Mishpat, each dealing with a different section of law, eg. family law, monetary law, laws of the holidays. I note that unlike the Rambam's, these codes don't cover laws that do not have any practical applications nowadays, such as most of laws surrounding the Temple.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch and its commentaries are cited by section, chapter and paragraph, eg. Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 57:1 or directly to a commentary eg. Bach OC 357:2. Much of the Shulchan Aruch can be found in English through <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Shulchan_Aruch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikisource</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Just to reiterate, this is not a conclusive list of rabbinic literature! There are many other important works that are not tied to the above list, and it would be impossible to list them all. This is just to help with some of the more common source references.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In Judaism there are a large array of books and texts which are considered authoritative.  However not all authoritative books have equal authority, and some are well respected but are not 'binding' (i.e. are not authoritative).</p>\n\n<p>It starts with the Chumash, or 5 books of Moshe.\nThen, there are 19 other books which make up Nach.  The 24 books together, make up Tanach, and is also known as \"The written Torah.\"</p>\n\n<p>Next up the food chain, is the \"Oral Torah\".\nThe Oral Torah is broken up into the Mishna, which has 63 books.\nThe Oral Torah also includes two Talmuds, one is known as the Talmud Bavli and the other the Talmud Yerushalmi.  We have lost many books in these Talmuds and so not all sections of the Mishna are covered in each of the Talmuds. </p>\n\n<p>The Talmud itself is made up of 4 types of texts.  Mishna, Bereita, Tosefta, Gemora.</p>\n\n<p>Bereita are texts written at the same time as the Mishna, but not included into the Mishna itself.\nTosefta are extra writings, that go along with the mishna, but were compiled separately.</p>\n\n<p>We also have \"Midrash\" which are texts focused on wordplays, puns, associations, and linguistic connections and stories focused on the Tanach.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud is made up of two types of texts. Some are \"Halachic\" and are authoritative. Others are \"Agadic\" are inspirational, but not \"binding\" or \"authoritative\".  Midrash is also divided into these two categories.</p>\n\n<p>After the Talmud, we have the writings of the \"Geonim\" or \"Great ones\".  Some of these writings are known as \"Minor tractates\" within the Talmud.   This is also where we get our modern Prayer books from, and many the beginning of very clear yes/no answers to Halacha. (Jewish Law)</p>\n\n<p>After the Geonim, are the writings of the Rishonim (First ones).  Rishonim either wrote commentaries on the Talmud and tanach which allows us to expand upon what was written, connecting various parts of the Talmuds together and creating a more clear picture. They also began to organize the texts into categories instead of free form learning.  Some Rishonim such as the Rambam, also wrote codified rules for all of Halacha.</p>\n\n<p>The further in history you go, the more types of books you find, and the less and less authoritative the books become.  However, some have become extremely authoritative in different circles.  For example there is the Shulchan Aruch and/or Mishna Bruah which some argue is the final authority.  Others state that only the Talmud and the rulings from the Sanhedrin can be the final authority, with more modern books giving great insight but are not 100% authoritative.</p>\n\n<p>On the less rules and authority and more on the soul and inspiration, there are also the books of the Heichalot literature, Sepher Yetzirah, Baahir, and Zohar.  These books heavily influenced Jewish prayer and ritual but their level of authority has waxed and waned depending on the community and era.   </p>\n\n<p>As was mentioned before there are many other books which have also entered the well established or respected writings.   Anything written after the Geonic period may or may not be authoritative. I highly recommend clicking around in Wikipedia to get a clear understanding of just how vast the works are.<br>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbinic_Literature\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbinic_Literature</a></p>\n\n<p>Even in Wikipedia there were many books which I found missing such as Path of the Righteous, Path of the Just, Duties of the Heart and other modern books which are taught in just about every highschool or Yeshiva today.</p>\n\n<p>The process by which books become authoritative past the Geonic period is very democratic and organic.  As a book becomes popular and widely quoted, it gains authority.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>the simplest list of sources can be presented like this:</p>\n\n<p>written law -- the tanach (similar to the \"old testament\" but there are some differences in book order, classification etc)</p>\n\n<p>oral law -- as b a put in the comments, the oral law (mishna and gemara) are sourced from sinai and are authoritative in the same way that the written law is, and the understanding of each is based on the other.</p>\n\n<p>there are many other works which complement these two (in time) and which expound upon them. codes of law and writings of the rabbis are substantial -- a single list of them would be difficult because, at times, different communities conferred different authority on one text or another. The shulchan aruch, for example, is an exhaustive legal tome with glosses by R. Moses Isserlis providing variant laws specifically for ashkenazic communities.</p>\n\n<p>a site like <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/torah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> might be a starting point</p>\n\n\n",

Most of my siddurim (including ArtScroll) have something ambiguous like \"from the start of Elul\".

This needs to be done with wisdom by figuring out how to channel the bad <em>midah</em>, if possible.</p>\n\n<p>Then we work on the speech and thought part of the <em>midah</em> - we need to understand why we feel this way etc.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let's assume I have an anger problem, the way to fixing this is first to understand why it's a problem.

For example: I may do exercise, or scream inside an empty room to let out the anger in a 'healthy/non inappropriate way'.</p>\n\n<p>Next I work on the 'speech' part of it. For example: I may sing a song loudly to let out the anger.  Notice how at this point the singing helps me (and most of the time I don't need to scream).</p>\n\n<p>Finally I work on the 'thought' aspect; I start appreciating how there is no need to get angry in the first place.

I learnt once from Habad that life is like going up a down escalator - if you stand still you go down. There is a constant struggle to improve the spiritual level and conquer the evil inclination (yetzer hara).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your question is understandably short on detail, so it's possible my particular answer will not be wholly relevant to you. I am a <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_all_you_have_is_a_hammer,_everything_looks_like_a_nail\" rel=\"nofollow\">man with a hammer</a>, all too familiar with the phenomenon you describe.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דרך ארץ קדמה לתורה<br>\n  Derech Eretz precedes the Torah</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The source of this well-known saying is not as obvious as the frequency it is quoted would suggest. See this fascinating <a href=\"http://kabbalahmadda.blogspot.com/2009/02/fake-rabbinic-aphorism.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Fake Rabbinic Aphorism\">blog post</a> and the discussion in the comments. It is variously applied to manners, livelihood and even marital intimacy, but the sense in which <em>I</em> take it is the one which I was taught - that living life according to the way of the world is a <strong>prerequisite</strong> to living life according to the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>This does <em>not</em> mean that when normal social practice clashes with a Torah lifestyle you favour 'the done thing'. It goes without saying that <em>mitzvot</em> must be upheld in opposition to the entire world if it comes to that. Rather, the wisdom of the world is a <strong>foundation</strong> to the sublime and infinite wisdom of the Torah. You've got to master day-to-day normal living before you can master living according to the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>This idea can be applied to behaviour which we just can't seem to eradicate from our life no matter how much teshuvah we do, mussar we learn or prayers we pour out. I'm talking about stuff which we know that the Torah forbids, and which we intellectually don't want to do, but are somehow driven to do anyway. The Torah approach just doesn't seem to get any traction, like a car stuck in mud. You're giving a huge amount of effort and attention to the problem, pedal to the metal, you can <em>feel</em> energy and sincerity pouring out of you, and yet you're getting nowhere, always slipping back to where you were. It can lead to despair.</p>\n\n<p>The wisdom of the world is intimately familiar with this problem. It's not a Torah issue at all. It applies to people across the world and throughout the ages. They call it addiction.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, I just called you an addict. I hope you will not take offense because I mean none. I am well aware, as I said at the start, that I know nothing about you or your circumstances. All I have to work with is your complaint about not being able to change your life. That certainly doesn't classify you as an addict, but it <em>is</em> a defining characteristic of people who admitted they were 'powerless'. The insult offered if it doesn't apply to you is outweighed by the benefit if it does.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion (and the opinion of frum Jews who have been forced to acknowledge and address their problems in this light) the Torah approach simply will not work for an addict. They have a problem fundamental to <em>being human</em> which requires correction through mundane means. Only then will the Torah 'work' for them. This is a radical and controversial idea which most Jews do not feel the need to entertain except in desperation.</p>\n\n<p>At the risk of being flippant, addiction is (to a degree) a 'solved problem'. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-Step_Program\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"12 Steps\">12 Steps</a>, when applied properly and fully, are proven<sup>*</sup> to allow an addict to change his behaviour where nothing else has worked. Anyone interested in self-improvement and growth, whether they have an addiction or not, will find food for thought in the writings of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=Rabbi%20Twerski\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Twerski</a>. If you determine that you are or might be an addict, explore the <em>numerous</em> Jewish addiction resources around the world. Relief is out there.</p>\n\n<p>In closing, I acknowledge again how presumptuous of me it is to extrapolate from such slim data. Please take my words in the spirit they are meant.</p>\n\n<p>*<sub>I think.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

How can I be sure that there isn't any other religion sent by God which is better than Judaism, but it is wrongly advertised so that I think that it is wrong?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 31)\n\n<p>This is really the most fundamental and important question on this site. But in my opinion, the other answers here have not done this justice by any stretch. They make it seem simple, and they may make us feel good, that we're really right, but in reality it's not so easy to show why Judaism is true, let alone prove it with certainty to \"be sure\" Judaism is true. They have presented more or less one-sided arguments and books, and while that is part of the puzzle, we'd be fooling ourselves to pretend that that is sufficient for determining the truth of any controversial question. One-sided arguments can just as well be presented on the Islam or Christianity SE sites, and while such an approach might satisfy some people, I don't think you'd be inclined to say that it gets them any closer to the truth.</p>\n\n<p>Any answer going to the heart of determining a religion's truth is going to need to come from a neutral perspective. Before any evidence is considered, that really is the only position that makes sense: There are thousands of religions, each with firm believers. So nobody, Jews included, should start with a biased impression that they lucked out and were born into the right faith. The basic answer is going to need to explain how much evidence in favor of Judaism would be sufficient to justify belief in the faith and then examine what evidence there is. With that, this answer will attempt to approach the question from a rationalist perspective.</p>\n\n<h2>How much evidence is needed</h2>\n\n<p>For many things in life, not that much evidence is needed to believe something. You can tentatively believe that your generally honest friend had waffles for breakfast going on their casual word alone, because there's nothing extraordinary about his claim. If a stranger tells you he just ate a giraffe sandwich though, you'd probably need an explanation for how he obtained such rare meat along with some good reason to believe him like photographic evidence. If an Ancient Roman tells you that he saw Romulus ascend to heaven and he has a whole crowd of witnesses to prove it, you'd need to do some thorough cross examination of that crowd, and even if it checks out many people would remain skeptical. For Judaism, it is more equivalent to the latter cases. Although for some of us who were raised in a Jewish environment it may not seem like a particularly extraordinary claim, from the perspective of a person that doesn't already believe, they may need this higher level of evidence. For an outside observer, it can come off as an extraordinary claim that a given religion is true and that stories of supernatural events did happen and that the Jewish people had the unique ability to properly maintain stories without modification over a hundred generations, particularly since it is controversial in the sense that secular people have their own arguments against it. So a reasonable response to those arguments along with substantial evidence or reasoning is what is needed to be sufficiently confident that Judaism is true.</p>\n\n<p>I'll bring up some of the more significant challenges to Judaism and how they might be resolved, and I will discuss the more popular arguments in favor of Judaism and where they might fall short. And so while this answer won't definitively prove Judaism true, I hope it will be useful to help people make that determination for themselves.</p>\n\n<h1>Arguments against Judaism and responses</h1>\n\n<h2>Natural and early history according to the Torah appears wrong</h2>\n\n<p>One of the tougher challenges to Judaism I've seen basically argues that the Torah errs in describing early history, especially in the first 11 chapters of Genesis describing creation, the flood, and the development of language. For example, the scientific evidence indicates that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/792\">the universe and Earth are older than 6000 years</a>, that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/35059\">Noah's flood never occured</a>, and that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/28441\">human history predated Adam and was not interrupted by Noah's flood</a>. It is not a strong position, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/30000\">and possibly theologically unsound</a> to dismiss the meaning, especially as it is understood as literal in various places in the Talmud. Further, the Torah records specific genealogies dependent on the historicity which are not well suited for allegorizing. Some Rishonim such as the Meiri also prohibit interpreting the story of creation as allegory, <a href=\"http://machzikeihadas.blogspot.com/2009/04/critique-of-rabbi-jeremy-weiders-when.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">as discussed in this Machzikei HaDas essay on the varying opinions regarding allegorical interpretation of scriptures</a>. Non-literal meanings are also made tenuous by the writings of other Rishonim, such as Rambam who says that it is a fundamental principle of the Torah that Adam was the first human created and that the genealogies and language development described in Genesis are correct in <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp186.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Guide for the Perplexed, Part III Chapter L</a> and Rabbi Yehuda Halevi who says that evidence of pre-Adamic human civilization would weaken his belief in <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Kitab_al_Khazari/Part_One\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kitab al Khazari, Part One paragraphs 60-61</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Among the suggestions I’ve seen to address this are that perhaps the scientists are severely mistaken, perhaps miraculous events would include aspects that obfuscate evidence of their occurrence, or that some opinions such as Rav Saadia Gaon do indeed allow for non-literal interpretations of these narratives (although only as a last resort, again as discussed in <a href=\"http://machzikeihadas.blogspot.com/2009/04/critique-of-rabbi-jeremy-weiders-when.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Machzikei HaDas essay</a>), either in total (e.g. \"It teaches a deeper lesson\") or in part (e.g. \"Adam was the first man in a spiritual sense\" or \"Noah's flood was regional\").</p>\n\n<h2>The Torah and Tanach appear to have contradictions</h2>\n\n<p>Another challenge is that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10527\">the Torah and Prophets (though not necessarily the Writings) are supposed to be inerrant</a>, yet some stories and verses appear to contradict with one another. For example, Numbers 33 and Deuteronomy 10 report conflicting versions of the journey through the wilderness and Aaron's death. In I Samuel 15 all of Amalek is killed, but by I Samuel 30 they’re pillaging Jewish towns. According to the genealogy in Genesis 46 Benjamin had 10 sons, according to Numbers 26 he only had 5, and there are differences about this as well in I Chronicles 7 and 8. II Kings 25 and Jeremiah 52 have various differences, such as whether Evil-merodach elevated and freed King Jehoiachin on the 27th of the month or on the 25th of the month. There are more examples, especially contrasting Chronicles (though being in Writings it may not have to be inerrant) with the narratives in the Prophets. So if the verses contradict, the Tanach must not be a reliable text, and it must not be that it was truly divine and inerrant.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, Talmudic sages and later commentaries do offer resolutions to these contradictions, for example by saying that in one of the verses it meant something different from how it appears. Aaron's burial location in Deuteronomy was figurative as a rebuke to the Jews. Perhaps some of Benjamin's families had been totally wiped out before the Numbers census and genealogy. And so on. Since there are ways to say that these verses don't actually contradict, they therefore may not be a product of human authorship and error. Rather, such apparent contradictions may be intentional, explained in the Oral Law, possibly to convey deeper meanings.</p>\n\n<h2>The Torah may include anachronisms</h2>\n\n<p>This challenge is basically to say that the Torah makes certain references to places or things or events that shouldn't be in there and that would make more sense if it had been compiled over the roughly 900-400 BCE time frame that Bible critics propose. For example, in Genesis 11:28 and other places, Abraham is said to be from Ur Kasdim, which means Ur of the Chaldeans, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaldea\" rel=\"noreferrer\">yet it was not called the land of the Chaldeans until the 9th century BCE</a>, and they could not have been around at all until at least the 11th century BCE. Or in Exodus 1:11 the Jews are credited with building Pithom and Ramses. Yet these cities were built later, for example <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi-Ramesses\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ramses was built for Ramses II who didn't reign till 1279 BCE</a>, well after the Jews had left Egypt (which was 1313 BCE according to Seder Olam or even earlier factoring in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_years_%28Jewish_calendar%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">missing years</a>).</p>\n\n<p>There are various other examples in the Torah and Prophets. But again there are responses. Maybe the archeologists are mistaken, or maybe references in the Torah should be understood differently from how one might initially think. For example, maybe the reference to Ramses in the Torah was to a place not known to archeologists, and Egyptian rulers happened to have that name and a similarly named city afterwards. So while these details may be challenges to address, they don't necessarily make an earlier, legitimate authorship of the Torah untenable.</p>\n\n<h2>The Talmud makes erroneous statements</h2>\n\n<p>Another challenge to Judaism is to say that the sages in the Talmud made mistakes, and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/65973\">at least by some views, it is necessary to say that the sages couldn't have made mistakes</a>, and even if they could, it doesn't speak well for their reliability in general. From the issue of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_years_%28Jewish_calendar%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">missing years</a> where the Talmud considers the Second Temple period to have been significantly shorter than what is known from archeology of the time, to some views expressing a flat-earth cosmology, to apparently indicating that lice spontaneously generate, errors show the sages to be flawed. But these errors can also be explained within Judaism. Rabbi Natan Slifkin is noted for his <a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2009/05/chazal-and-science.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">addressing of discrepancies between chazal and science</a>. By some opinions, you are required to believe that the sages did not make mistakes, in which case you may consider Talmudic errors to simply be allusions to their actual, deeper meanings. By other opinions, the sages are not considered infallible, and the only science that it matters for them to get right is when it relates to Halacha.</p>\n\n<p>These are some of the big ones, but I have seen people presenting additional challenges, arguing that prophesies in the Tanach haven't come true, that textual oddities suggest human authorship, that stories and practices in the Torah are derivative of other ancient religions, and so on. Discussing and answering them all would be outside the scope of this answer. In general, the degree to which these and any other challenges to Judaism seem significant, and the degree to which their resolutions are satisfactory, will come down to a matter of opinion. It is an individual's responsibility to look into the facts and make a judgment of how innocuous or problematic such challenges may be and what degree of evidence in favor of Judaism is needed to outweigh them.</p>\n\n<h1>Arguments for Judaism</h1>\n\n<p>There are a wide array of arguments in favor of Judaism. Kiruv resources have gathered a variety of pieces of evidence and logical proofs. Some of the arguments are better and more common than others, while still more are unfortunately based on misinformation and don't serve Judaism well.</p>\n\n<h2>Misguided Proofs</h2>\n\n<p>I just think it's worth touching on this: A lot of proofs claim to show an amazing piece of knowledge contained in the Torah or Talmud or describe an amazing paranormal event but aren't really backed up by the facts. Unfortunately, they often get passed around without scrutiny, and that is counterproductive. I'm not saying that all amazing claims are necessarily false. But before something like that is repeated, it should be fact checked first to rule out misinformation.</p>\n\n<h2>Personal Experience and Miracle Stories</h2>\n\n<p>A fairly common argument that individuals use as evidence in favor of Judaism is stories of miracles or Hasgacha Pratis (divine providence). This is basically the category of supernatural coincidences. Often times they are a personal and anecdotal way of demonstrating evidence of Judaism to one's self or close peers. On the other hand, due to the nature of these stories, examples that impress oneself or a person's peers may not convince society as a whole. Some examples of stories I've heard involve prophetic dreams, precognition, miraculous healing, divine providence, and so on, and they go to attribute these events to God and take as evidence for Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>The limitations of this line of evidence, though, are (1) that without having a personal experience yourself, you may not trust the supernatural event truly happened in the way the storyteller suggests, (2) that similar miracle stories are also commonly used by Christians, Hindus, and people of other religions, so unless Jewish stories can be meaningfully and qualitatively distinguished from other ones, it either is evidence of God but not a particular religion or it may not be a reliable way of determining the truth of something, and (3) these things may often be explainable by statistical expectations and cognitive shortfalls.</p>\n\n<h2>Bible Codes</h2>\n\n<p>Another line of arguments I've seen are on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_code\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bible Codes</a>. Basically, when taking all the letters (without spaces) in the Torah (and Tanach too), starting with one letter and skipping a fixed (and ideally small) number of letters can produce new words, or skip codes. The idea is that there are groups of skip codes in sometimes relevant passages for related ideas that describe people or events. The idea is that these hidden codes show that the exact text of the Torah and Tanach were guided by an omniscient force. Although skip codes have no reliable <em>predictive</em> applications, proponents argue that there are <em>statistically significant</em> skip codes describing people or events which is enough to suggest divine authorship, which in turn implies that Judaism is true.</p>\n\n<p>Not everyone is convinced by this, disputing the statistical significance, saying that skip codes can be found in any sufficiently large set of letters and that a skip code for anything can be found in the Torah (just as with other large works), including events that did not happen, and lastly that our modern Torahs <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/44618\">may not have the original spellings</a> which would in many cases erase the traces of intentional skip codes if there ever were any. It may indeed be that there are statistically significant hidden codes in Tanach demonstrating divine authorship, but it's hard to verify if that's really the case.</p>\n\n<h2>Archeology</h2>\n\n<p>Archeological evidence is another point that people use as evidence that the Torah narrative is true. <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257834.Permission_to_Receive\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Permission to Receive by Lawrence Kelemen</a> has a chapter called the Empirical Issue which basically is a collection of archeological finds of ancient places or names or events that seem to corroborate the Torah's narratives. For example, an Ancient Egyptian story called <em>The Tale of Two Brothers</em> has similarities to the narrative in the Torah of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipuwer_Papyrus\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ipuwer Papyrus</a> from Ancient Egypt seems to describe some of the 10 plagues of the Exodus from Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>Such archeological claims are often disputed, however. For example, most scholars date the Ipuwer Papyrus to several centuries before the Exodus from Egypt would have been, and it seems to describe events that don't really match the 10 plagues. Using archeology can also be a double-edged sword, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_the_Bible\" rel=\"noreferrer\">mainstream archeologists tend to consider</a> findings in Ancient Israel to be largely contrary to the slavery, exodus, conquest, and sometimes even the unified kingdom narratives. Without personal expertise, it may be hard for an individual to judge which archeological perspectives are more accurate, so this may also not be the easiest avenue to argue for Judaism.</p>\n\n<h2>National Tradition (aka the Kuzari Argument)</h2>\n\n<p>The \"Kuzari Argument\" may be the most popular argument in favor of Judaism. It is also a cornerstone of the Permission to Receive book described above. Succinctly, the Torah describes miraculous events experienced by the whole Jewish nation, and each generation learned about this from the previous. No generation would have accepted the Torah if it had just been made up by someone, especially since it contains a lot of doctrines and rules, because they could check with their elders to verify whether the stories were true. Therefore the Exodus narrative, and by extension the Torah received in it, are true.</p>\n\n<p>Even this though <a href=\"http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2006/02/demolishing-dumb-arguments-mass.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">is not a perfect proof</a>. It depends on some assumptions, that the ancient Israelites were sufficiently incredulous, that at no point did a ruler force beliefs onto the people, that mythologies can't evolve much, that any religion the people might have had prior to the Torah would have been easier, and that at no point could a false, allegedly forgotten, history be \"reintroduced\" to the people. These assumptions are open to contention, and some of these assumptions may even conflict with narratives within the Tanach itself.</p>\n\n<p>For example, it may be such mythologies really could develop naturally. <a href=\"https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/16973\">Some argue that other cultures such as the Aztec and Sioux have national miracle myths</a>. The narrative in Tanach may also not necessarily involve a continuous national tradition, as there are various places that state that at times God was forgotten and monotheism was rejected, for example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, that knew not the LORD, nor yet the work which He had wrought for Israel. (Judges 2:10)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Further, perhaps a ruler could have indeed instituted religious reforms involving revisionist history, by authoritarian force and/or by claiming the history was forgotten. For example, King Asa is described as implementing with force religious reforms to spread monotheism and Torah to the people:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And they entered into the covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul; and that whosoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. (II Chronicles 15:12-13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps more relevant would be II Kings chs. 21-23, where a long period of time is described where the Jewish people were alienated from the Torah and practiced polytheism until it was discovered again by King Josiah’s scribe and High Priest. As a result, Josiah instituted religious reforms and restored monotheism, known as the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Deuteronomic-Reform\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Deuteronomic Reform</a>, which may have been an opportunity for the king to introduce the people to a revised history of a national revelation under the pretense that it had been forgotten under the previous generations. Later the Tanach indicates that his reforms did not fully take hold until generations later when Ezra's followers finally seemed to have monotheism locked in. However, even his followers were largely ignorant of the contents of the Torah, as described in Ezra and Nehemiah, and some argue that this may have been another possible opportunity for new or altered narratives to be added to scriptures before canonization.</p>\n\n<p>Despite such challenges, defenders maintain that the national miracle traditions really can't be faked and those Aztec and other counterexamples are not comparable. Some also argue that despite select verses which suggest a gap in tradition, other narrative details suggest that there must have always been at least some faithful tradition keepers. In the end, some consider the argument persuasive, while others do not.</p>\n\n<h2>Pascal's Wager</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes down to it, some people look at the evidence and are persuaded that Judaism is indeed true, others may have the complete opposite takeaway, and still more may have middling confidence. For this last group, an argument that they use to justify practice of Judaism is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_Wager\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pascal's Wager</a> (which is an idea I heard expressed by Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb in conjunction with his version of the Kuzari argument). Their reasoning goes that they're not sure if the religion is true or false and that it's better to practice Judaism on the chance that it will help them in the afterlife. How good of a reason this is to practice Judaism may depend on how likely they think it is that Judaism actually is true, whether there are practical downsides to Judaism, what the consequences would be for a soul that doesn't practice Judaism, and (if the person thinks an alternate religion might also be true) what the consequences might be for following a false religion. So Pascal's Wager can often serve as a reason to follow Judaism. But it won't help anyone conclude whether Judaism is actually true.</p>\n\n<p>There are, of course, various other reasons or pieces of evidence that are used to argue in favor of Judaism. Some argue for it on account of the survival of the Jewish people, the establishment and military successes of the State of Israel, numerology, the fact that the First and Second Temples were destroyed on the same calendar day, and so on. But again it is outside the scope of this answer to discuss them all, and it is up to the individual to explore and analyze their strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>Are these arguments sufficient to justify belief in Judaism? You will have to judge that for yourself. To that end, the statistical equation known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bayes’ theorem</a> can be especially useful in calculating the likelihood that Judaism is true by mathematically considering the various pieces of evidence. (See the addendum below for more information on using Bayes’ theorem.)</p>\n\n<p>Based on the arguments I've seen, a case for Judaism can be made, yet it is by no means easy to definitively prove that Judaism is true. As far as why that should be, assuming of course Judaism is indeed true, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/27362\">other questions try to explore that</a> as well as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/34773\">why God would require us to be religious when there are these doubts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But as far as knowing \"for sure\" if Judaism is true, the fact is that there are arguments in favor of it but arguments against it. And what convinces one person might not convince another. It is up to every individual to examine the evidence and do their best to answer the question as honestly as they can.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Using Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of Judaism</h2>\n\n<p>Statistics can often be counterintuitive, so <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bayes' theorem</a> is helpful for factoring in pieces of evidence to estimate the probability that something is true. Specifically, it works by multiplying the prior odds that a hypothesis is true by the probability of there being a given observation if the hypothesis were true, divided by the total probability of there being that observation. There are various online resources explaining it more, but one helpful video is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BrK7X_XlGB8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">A Visual Guide to Bayesian Thinking</a> by the rationality public speaker Julia Galef.</p>\n\n<p>A caveat here is that for topics such as this, it relies largely on an individual's best assumptions rather than clearly known probabilities. And due to differences in the knowledge different people have about various issues, or personal biases that skew what they consider reasonable, what one person considers to be a reasonable probability to input may differ from that of another. Consequently, although this can be useful, it will still not produce a single, definitive value for all people. Individuals must also be mindful of potential biases (e.g. if they think an expected probability for a piece of evidence is extremely dependent on Judaism being true, they should ensure they know enough about the issue to honestly justify that confidence). Of course, this is still far more reliable and useful than a simple gut feeling, which is all anyone can reasonably ask for.</p>\n\n<p>The equation can be written like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>P(J|E) = P(E|J) x P(J) / [P(E|J) x P(J) + P(E|~J) x P(~J)]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where <code>P(J|E)</code> is the posterior probability that Judaism is true, <code>P(E|J)</code> is the probability of specific evidence existing assuming Judaism is true, <code>P(J)</code> is the prior probability that Judaism is true before considering that evidence, <code>P(E|~J)</code> is the probability of the evidence existing assuming Judaism is not true, and <code>P(~J)</code> is the probability that Judaism is not true (which equals <code>1 - P(J)</code>). The value for a probability can range from 0 to 1 (e.g. 1 = 100%, 0.05 = 5%, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>The equation in this form only factors in a single argument (or piece of evidence, or observation), so to get a final estimate, you would need to take the result of the equation, treat that as the new prior probability, and repeat the calculation for the next argument. (The order for calculating the various arguments does not matter for conditionally independent observations like this.) You don't have to factor in <em>every</em> argument there is, just the significant ones, both for and against, where whether Judaism is true or false would make a significant difference in your expectation of those arguments existing.</p>\n\n<h3>Example using Bayes' theorem</h3>\n\n<p>I'll give an example of using the equation, but I cannot run the actual calculations on behalf of others as the numbers I would offer would be based on my personal knowledge and estimates and colored by my personal biases. <strong>So for illustrative purposes only I will give an example using values that I do not <em>necessarily</em> endorse</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>So first, we need to come up with an initial <code>P(J)</code>. That is, if you didn't have any evidence for or against Judaism, what are the odds that it is the one true religion? There are thousands of religions today, about twenty that have millions of followers. A person might consider all religions to be equally plausible, or a person might know certain things about some of those religions to discount them. Some may think it doubtful that there even is a true religion. Just for our example let's say a person thinks there is a 50% chance that there is a true religion among the largest 20 religions, and they do not initially necessarily consider any one of those religions to be more likely than any other, so we'll set the prior probability that Judaism is true as <code>0.5 * 1 / 20</code>, or <code>P(J) = 0.025</code> and <code>P(~J) = 0.975</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For an argument to factor in, let's do the establishment of the predominantly Jewish state and government of Israel. Let's say that you would have only expected a 5% chance that the Jewish people could have succeeded in establishing a state naturally, whereas if Judaism were true you would expect maybe a 50% chance of God enabling the establishment of a state in this way. So we say <code>P(E|J) = 0.5</code> and <code>P(E|~J) = 0.05</code> leading us to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>P(J|E) = 0.5 * 0.025 / [0.5 * 0.025 + 0.05 * 0.975)]\nP(J|E) = 0.204\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Considering a first piece of evidence in this way raised our probability that Judaism is true from 2.5% to 20.4%, which is a significant change. Next let's say we want to factor in the effect of the Kuzari argument. Let's say we find the argument fairly compelling, expected if Judaism were true and fairly unlikely that it would have come about otherwise, and we may judge that <code>P(E|J) = 0.9</code> and <code>P(E|~J) = 0.1</code>. And now we can also set a new prior probability from our posterior probability result of the last equation, so <code>P(J) = 0.204</code> and <code>P(~J) = 0.796</code>. Which means:</p>\n\n<pre><code>P(J|E) = 0.9 * 0.204 / [0.9 * 0.204 + 0.1 * 0.796]\nP(J|E) = 0.698\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We now have gone up to a probability that Judaism is true of 69.8%. To wrap up our example we'll factor in a counterargument, apparent anachronisms in the Torah. Let's say that a later authorship may lead to some anachronisms, but also that it's plausible that those references in the Torah have been misunderstood or the archeologists would make mistakes. We might decide <code>P(E|J) = 0.5</code> and <code>P(E|~J) = 0.75</code>. And from the previous calculation,<code>P(J) = 0.698</code> and <code>P(~J) = 0.302</code>. So:</p>\n\n<pre><code>P(J|E) = 0.5 * 0.698 / [0.5 * 0.698 + 0.75 * 0.302]\nP(J|E) = 0.606\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this, the posterior probability that Judaism is true has decreased slightly to 60.6%. And to continue refining our value of the probability that Judaism was true, we would continue doing this math until all the significant evidence is considered and we have a useful final calculation that represents how likely we believe it is that Judaism is true.</p>\n\n<p>This should only be considered as an illustrative demonstration of how to utilize Bayes' theorem to figure out how likely you believe it is that Judaism is true. But do the math as modeled above, using values that you yourself consider reasonable, and it will help you reach a useful number to tell you how likely it is Judaism is true.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>Rabbi Kelemen’s book <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1568710992\">Permission to Receive</a> is essential reading and provides four rational approaches to the Torah’s Divine origin. I can’t summarise it here.</p>\n\n<p>The best evidence is our <a href=\"http://www.beingjewish.com/mesorah/\">Mesorah – the tradition of transmission of the Torah</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The link site also has articles on our <a href=\"http://www.beingjewish.com/mesorah/history.html\">history</a> with the critical paragraph: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On the fiftieth day after they began counting the Omer--that is,\n  fifty-one days after the Exodus, <strong><em>all</em></strong> of the Children of Israel,\n  men, women and children, over two million people, stood at Mount Sinai\n  and received the Torah amidst great miracles and heavenly fire. They\n  saw no form or picture of G-d, but they saw many miracles that proved\n  that G-d is the Creator of heaven and earth. They heard G-d's voice\n  speak and command Moses to instruct the Children of Israel on how to\n  prepare to receive the Torah. Then they heard G-d speaking directly to\n  them, the Children of Israel, and commanding them to keep the Torah.\n  The Children of Israel accepted the Torah and all its Commandments,\n  and they said: \"We agree to obey, even before we hear the actual\n  Commandments.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.beingjewish.com/mesorah/ageoftorah.html\">article</a> that establishes the age of the Torah is also worth looking at.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We have had the Torah for at least 3,313 years, when Hashem gave it to\n  us at Mount Sinai.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>there is no water-tight proof for Judaism (or God) since we believe the purpose of creation is free will (see Derech Hashem ch.1). But there are many indications of its truth, which although each one by itself may not be so convincing but the sheer number of these indications is enough to be considered sufficient proof.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing a person needs to do is investigate whether God exists and is involved in our planet. This can be derived through philosophical inquiry (first cause) and through the wisdom in nature, especially in life forms on our planet. Once a person is convinced of the existence of God and that He is involved on our planet, and is concealing Himself from us, then it follows that some communication should occur for Him to tell us what this is all about and thus one religion should be true. Based on below and more, I believe Judaism has vastly more tangible evidence without comparison than any other religion out there.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>the laws of shmita (Parsha Behar) (every seven years everyone in israel must stop working the land for the whole year. God promises to provide a bumper crop prior to the Shmita year to sustain the Jewish people). furthermore, in the yovel year this would be two consecutive years where noone planted anything.  What human in his right mind would fabricate such a claim and risk mass starvation? (if this were agricultural reasons, it would not be necessary to stop all the land simultaneously and it would be crazy to promise a bumper crop after six straight years of harvesting the land. Usually the opposite happens after 6 straight years.)</p></li>\n<li><p>3 times a year, every year, during the temple era, all Jewish males are commanded to leave their homes and go to Jerusalem for the festivals. God promised: \"Nobody will desire your land while you are going up to see the face of the Lord your God three times in the year.\" (Ex 34:24) Who else could make such a claim but God? No human being in his right mind would enact such a law, leaving his army vulnerable to being encircled and easily defeated. Turns out it proved true that no foreign nation ever came up to take the land of the Jews during their festivals prior to the destruction of Jerusalem 400+ years later.</p></li>\n<li><p>Kosher. The torah informs us that there is only one animal that has split hooves and does not chew its cud - the pig. Who else but God could claim this? (see this link for more on this: <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/b/bb/104491254.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.aish.com/jl/b/bb/104491254.html</a> )</p></li>\n<li><p>\"all fish with scales have moving fins\" - who else but God can claim this. (see above link). (some invoke the \"sea snake\" or \"sea eel\" as a \"refutation\" but these scales are embedded in the skin unlike normal fish which are armor-like and come off without peeling off the skin. the hebrew word for scales \"kaskasim\" is the same as for armor. see: <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/cons-faqs-status.htm#eel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a> or <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/623273/jewish/Is-eel-kosher.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a>)</p></li>\n<li><p>The torah's prophecies of the return of the Jews to Israel.

This is due to confidence in the pact of God with Abraham that Judaism will never disappear as explained <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/audio/m04-3_flaws_of_man_and_role_of_jews.mp3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. We see its effects today, as Mark Twain <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Quote/TwainJews.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">wondered</a>: \"The Jew saw them all, survived them all, and is now what he always was, exhibiting no decadence, no infirmaties, of age, no weakening of his parts, no slowing of his energies, no dulling of his alert but aggressive mind.  All things are mortal but the Jews; all other forces pass, but he remains.  What is the secret of his immortality?\"</p></li>\n<li><p>The uniqueness of the Jewish people, in terms of cultural survival as explained in <a href=\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/media/a/rmb-survivor-israel/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this lecture</a> by Rabbi Mordechai Becher. This indicates a special providence on the Jews more than any other nations as explained there. We also find a uniqueness around the jewish people in terms of intellectual abilities. They have received an extremely disproportionate number of <a href=\"http://www.jinfo.org/Nobel_Prizes.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">nobel prizes</a>. This indicates \"something\" unique about the Jews.</p></li>\n<li><p>Antisemitism - The Talmud (Tractate Shabbos 69) cites the source of anti-Semitism using a play on words: The Torah - the source of the Jewish system of laws, values and moral standards - was received at Mount Sinai. The Hebrew pronunciation of \"Sinai\" is almost identical to the Hebrew word for \"hatred\" - sinah. \"Why was the Torah given on a mountain called Sinai?\" asks the Talmud. \"Because the great sinah - the tremendous hatred aimed at the Jew - emanates from Sinai.\" I think we can confirm the existence of this irrational hatred throughout history. Even today, the UN passes more resolutions against Israel than the entire world combined. Some Jews have tried to cure this hatred by abandoning the torah and becoming like the nations but history shows it has resulted in the opposite effect, as predicted in the verse (Ezekiel 20) \"When you say, 'Let us be like the nations, like the peoples of other countries...' As I live says the Lord GOD - I will rule over you with a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and outpoured wrath\".</p></li>\n<li><p>The special providence given to those who truly dedicate themselves to torah study. The Vilna Gaon for example reportedly achieved superhuman levels of torah wisdom as explained <a href=\"http://www.chareidi.org/archives5766/ZAV66features5.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.chareidi.org/archives5766/TZR66features.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. More recently, it is reported in the book \"HaSod\" by (Y. Hershkowitz) about Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv that his grasp of the entire spectrum of torah depth was miraculous. He was able to answer the most complicated halachic questions instantly, even those intertwined in multiple complex sections in the talmud over many tractates. Many times the head judge of the Rabbinical Court in Jerusalem was asked to rule on such complicated questions. He would answer: I can research this and give you an answer in several days, or you can go to Rabbi Elyashiv and get a fully reliable answer instantly. </p></li>\n<li><p>The uniquenes of the torah. the most popular book of all time. Even today it has been translated into more languages than any other book. The two great world religions - Christianity and Islam are daughters, though sometimes ungrateful daughters, of Mother Zion. Whether or not they realize it, they have spread to humanity, at their level, major concepts of Judaism. </p></li>\n<li><p>Judaism is the mother of all monotheist religions. Scientific inquiry supports the idea that the world functions through a unifying force as explained in this <a href=\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/media/a/torah-and-science/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">lecture</a> by Rabbi Mordechai Becher. This is an indication that if the universe is run by the divine then there is only one Divinity.</p></li>\n<li><p>Despite being among the smallest nation, the Jews are the most influential people in world history. Among <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jw/s/9-Great-Quotes-about-Jews-by-Non-Jews.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">many others</a>, John Adams, a non-Jew and the second president of the United States said: \"I will insist the Hebrews have [contributed] more to civilize men than any other nation. If I was an atheist and believed in blind eternal fate, I should still believe that fate had ordained the Jews to be the most essential instrument for civilizing the nations ... They are the most glorious nation that ever inhabited this Earth. The Romans and their empire were but a bubble in comparison to the Jews. They have given religion to three-quarters of the globe and have influenced the affairs of mankind more and more happily than any other nation, ancient or modern\". End quote.

We can see in our times the pace of events accelerating exponentially more than any other time in world history.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Two more points brought by Rabbi Yaakov Emden (200 years ago, quoted in Masoret Yisrael edition of Chovos Halevavos end of gate 10):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sign of the truth of these things are from two faithful, visible,\n  witnesses: </p>\n  \n  <p>One, our situation and survival in this long exile, which the Creator\n  fulfilled His promise: \"But despite all this, while they are in the\n  land of their enemies, I will not despise them nor will I reject them\n  to annihilate them, thereby breaking My covenant that is with them,\n  for I am the L-ord their G-d\" (Vayikra 26:44)...</p>\n  \n  <p>Two, the matter of our land, because from the day we went out of it,\n  no nation was able to dwell in it, it was like a woman who's husband\n  went on a faraway trip, and she waits for him, and the verse \"I will\n  make the Land desolate, so that it will become desolate [also] of your\n  enemies who live in it\" (Vayikra 26:32), tells us it is guarded for\n  us...all this are clear signs that our hope is not lost and G-d's love\n  has not left us, and on this eternal love is based Shir Hashirim, and\n  just like G-d loves us a strong love, \"Torrents of water are not able\n  to extinguish the love\" (Shir Hashirim 8:7), so too it is our duty to\n  show our powerful and complete love, like \"As water reflects a face\n  back to a face, so one's heart is reflected back to him by another\"\n  Mishlei 27:19)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Matityahu Solomon, the mashgiach of the Lakewood Yeshiva in New Jersey also brings down a different version of Rabbi Emden's argument in his commentary to the Shaar Bechina <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/414\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ch.5</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We do not need to contemplate on the great miracles of the Exodus, in\n  order to examine and demonstrate G-d's goodness and infinite power.\n  For behold, we have a faithful witness which cannot be denied - our\n  survival during this exile among the nations. It is proper to quote\n  the holy words of Rabbi Yaakov Emden (sidur beit kel):</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Who is so blind as to not see the divine providence below, that His\n  eyes are on them always. How could the denier of providence not be\n  ashamed and stand disgraced? He who examines our unique situation and\n  standing in the world. We the exiled nation, a dispersed sheep. After\n  all the troubles and shifts for two thousands years. No nation in the\n  world is as pursued as us. How great have been our troubles! How\n  powerful have been those who lifted their heads against us from our\n  earliest beginnings - to exterminate us, root us out, and eradicate\n  us, due to their intense hatred which stems from jealousy. They have\n  brought on us great sufferings but were never able to triumph over us,\n  to eliminate us and destroy us. All these ancient, powerful nations -\n  have gone by, their strength has withered, their protection has eroded\n  - but we who cling to G-d are all alive today (Deut. 4:4). We have not lost in this long, intense exile even a single letter or vowel of the\n  written Torah. The words of the Sages (oral law) endured. The hand of\n  time did not prevail over us, they were not able to prevail over us.\n  What will the sharp philosopher answer to this? Can the hand of chance\n  do all this? I swear by my soul, for when contemplating these things,\n  they are greater in my eyes than all the great open miracles G-d has\n  performed for our forefathers in Egypt, the Sinai Desert, and in the\n  land of Israel. (the author wrote that the miracle of our survival in\n  this exile is equal to the miracles of Egypt, but Rabbi Yaakov Emden\n  holds that it is an even greater miracle) The longer the exile, the\n  more the miracle is confirmed, and G-d's strength and power becomes\n  apparent. For the prophets already saw the exile's intensity,\n  complaining and moaning on its amazing protracted length before it\n  happened. Behold, none of their words fell to the ground (failed to\n  happen)...\" End quote</p>\n  \n  <p>(Rabbi Solomon continues) As Moshe Rabeinu told us from the outset that such and such as trouble\n  would befall us, and thus it happened. Likewise, for all of our exile\n  - the prophets already predicted what will happen. For all the persecutions and pursuits that befell us, such as the holocaust, it is\n  all spelled out in the verses of the Torah which speak on those\n  times... Can we not see these things with our own eyes?! Behold, only\n  by examining and contemplating is it possible to see them. Without\n  contemplating them, we remain totally blind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and all this is just the tip of the iceberg. for many more indications I put together see <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/430\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Importance of learning grammar\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What are the traditional Jewish opinions about the importance of learning and speaking Hebrew with proper grammar (dikduk)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>On one hand, the Chavos Yair (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=857&st=&pgnum=142&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">124</a>) writes (translation by <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol06/v06n075.shtml#06\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Gil Student</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is good and necessary for a knowledgeable person (ben da'as) to\n  learn a  little of the wisdom of grammar and to know the general\n  rules, whether plural  and singular pronouns, feminine and masculine,\n  past, present and future tenses,  direct and indirect objects, or\n  prefix and suffix letters.  But it is  unnecessary to waste one's time\n  on the various conjugations (binyanim) that  grammarians discuss. \n  Also, the points of emphasis and softness (dagesh and  rafah) and the\n  general rules are incumbent on a person [to know] as he is a man  and\n  a \"nefesh chayah\" as Targum translates (Bereishit 2:7).  How can one\n  who has studied, learned, and taught until he reached the level of\n  teaching and judging  (yoreh veyadin) not be embarrassed is someone\n  asks him about the prayerbook why  the vowels under \"vav\" prefixes\n  change between \"UNeshabeichacha\", \"UNefa'arecha\" with a melafoos and\n  \"VEnamlich\", \"VEnazkir\" with a sheva...?  However, it is not worth\n  wasting time on knowing all of the details and details of the details\n  and  the derivatives of the general rules because knowledge of them is\n  a great  confusion and a minor relevance.  Some have explained thusly\n  what Rabbi Eliezer  said (Berachos 28b) \"Keep your sons away from\n  'higayon'\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Maharal (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14202&st=&pgnum=119\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nesivos Olam, Nesiv HaAvodah chapter 12</a>) writes (translation by me):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Concerning the grammar of all the paytanim (poem-writers), the Ibn Ezra of blessed memory picks a fight, because they weren't accurate with the grammar of the [Hebrew] language in their piyutim, as he spoke at length in his explanation to Koheles (ch. 5). But I say that our rabbis of blessed memory didn't pay attention to the grammar of the [Hebrew] language like this, because the scriptures are as they were written in the holy language, and certainly this language — the holy language — can't leave the precise grammar even for a few words, and if there is anything abnormal in its language, it is because of a certain expounding.

But with piyutim, which are like song and praise which a person says, and is a person's own speech, they didn't prevent him from using a language like this, although it bends the rules of the grammar of the holy language, since the matter can anyway be understood, because all languages are okay for this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If so, all the more so you don't need to care about grammar in ordinary conversation.</p>\n\n<p>(I found this Maharal after looking at his discussion of the piyut \"Machnisei Rachamim\" which we say in slichos, since it immediately follows it; it is worth looking at this time of year.)</p>\n\n\n",

The gauge would be that if such additional income is simply bettering his physical standards it would not be allowed, whereas if it will uplift his spiritual service it is.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yishmael says in Menachot (99b) that one cannot learn \"Greek Wisdom\" because it would take away time from learning Torah and the passuk says \" לא ימוש ספר התורה הזה מפיך\". \nHowever, the Gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=35b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berachot 35b</a> discusses this passuk, and while R. Shimon b. Yochai says one should not work, R. Yishmael says it is something one should do as it says \"ואספת דגנך\". This raises an apparent contradiction in R. Yishamel's position on what לא ימוש means.   </p>\n\n<p>Some explain R. Yishmael's view by saying that he only allows one to take off time from learning for Parnasah, but not for learning \"Greek Wisdom\". Some then equate Greek Wisdom with secular studies, which would create a prohibition to study secular studies if it isn't for earning a living. (However, it does not seem like we hold like R. Yishmael in Menachot, and Greek Wisdom is probably much narrower than all secular studies, see <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2011/12/how-much-greek-in-greek-wisdom-on.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Berachot continues: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר אביי: הרבה עשו כרבי ישמעאל - ועלתה בידן, כרבי שמעון בן יוחי - ולא עלתה בידן. אמר להו רבא לרבנן: במטותא מינייכו, ביומי ניסן וביומי תשרי לא תתחזו קמאי, כי היכי דלא תטרדו במזונייכו כולא שתא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Abaye says that R. Yishmael's approach worked out better in practice. Rava is then quoted as telling his students not to come before him [to learn] during Nissan and Tishrei so that they won't  need to spend as much time on parnasah during the year. </p>\n\n<p>Rava's statement shows that one <strong>should sacrifice time from learning</strong> at one point in a year if it will leave him with more time  to learn later. This argument can probably be extended to learning less torah for a couple of years if it really will leave a person with more time to learn later. </p>\n\n<p>What about choosing a career based on personal preference that will take more time to study for but without providing more time later? I think this would also be permitted even according to those who only allow studying for a livelihood. Since the studies are for a livelihood, they would be included in the \"heter\". One is not required to make calculations about which would take the least amount of time away from learning without regarding any other factors. (Even by more severe prohibitions, if something is permitted, one often does not need to make calculations to find the least violations.)</p>\n\n<p>See also the Mishnah at the end of Kiddushin which discusses what livelihood one should teach his son. While it does mention teaching \" אומנות נקיה וקלה\", it doesn't seem that a career should be avoided just because it involves more training time. There are many other important factors. In fact the whole question may be more complex than something that can just be looked up in the \"shulchan aruch\", since it involves lifetime personal decisions.  </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can one pray in front of a mirror?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Can it be considered avodah zarah if one prays while looking at themselves in the mirror? I mean, if you're looking at yourself, is it wrong for someone to think that you're praying to that person?  I'm not sure how great this logic is, because I know this doesn't apply to objects, or people when their backs are turned (eg. in the beit kenesset).</p>\n\n<p>I'm not concerned about the possible distraction of seeing myself in the mirror (I'm not that, um, attractive).  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>No, one may not pray in front of a mirror. The Radbaz in a responsum (4:107) gives both of the reasons you mention as explanations. <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/Display.asp?PageIndex=73&ClipID=665\" rel=\"nofollow\">From DailyHalacha.com</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The question surrounding the permissibility of praying facing such a window arises from a discussion of the Radbaz (Rabbi David Ben Zimra, Egypt, 1480-1574) regarding praying in front of a mirror. It is forbidden to pray in front of a mirror for two reasons. First, the sight of one’s reflection will likely disrupt his concentration which should be focused on his prayer. Secondly, when one prays in front of his reflection, he gives the appearance as though he bows to himself. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.mishnaberura.com/Default.asp?SeifDate=10/19/2006\" rel=\"nofollow\">MishnaBerura.com</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it permissible to pray in front of a mirror?<br>\n       <strong>A:</strong> No, even if one closes his eyes <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=246\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Mishna Berura 90:71).</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yonanewman.org/kizzur/kizzur18.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכנגד מראה אסור להתפלל אפילו בעינים סגורות<br>\n  It is forbidden to pray facing a mirror, even with closed eyes</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>To answer your question directly, it is not actually a problem of Avoda Zara. There are sources (cf. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/18683/759\">HodofHod's answer</a>) that discuss avoiding praying in front of a mirror lest it <em>appear</em> that one is bowing to himself, so the issue is one purely of Marat Ayin.</p>\n\n<p>Worrying about this issue seems normative, but I'd like to point out some exceptions based on a responsum of Rabbi Baruch Weintraub (<a href=\"http://vbm-torah.org/archive/halak71/02halak.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>) discussing the case of a mechitza of one-way glass which at certain times of day acts like a mirror to the women as well.</p>\n\n<p>The first distinction he makes, is that the rule should only apply when the location chosen is temporary. However, if one has a fixed spot for prayer next to a mirror then the concern will not apply because all know that this is a fixed spot for prayer and they will not suspect him of bowing to himself.</p>\n\n<p>The second distinction is that the mirror needs to be designed as a mirror, but if the object, while reflective, is not designed as a mirror then no one will assume that the one praying is using it as a mirror.</p>\n\n<p>As for the issue of concentration, he insists that one must make a cost benefit analysis of the location chosen. Will it increase one's concentration by, eg. allowing one to better hear the Leader? How distracted would one be by the mirror? This would need to be evaluated on a case by case basis.</p>\n\n<p>So if your prayer spot is fixed or the mirror in question is not a fixed one, and there is a benefit to prayer by being in that specific spot, then there are grounds to be lenient. Otherwise, though, it seems proper to avoid praying in front of a mirror due to the concern of Marat Ayin.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do most of the shuls in Manhattan face the wrong direction?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As a first time visitor to Manhattan, I was very surprised to see that most shuls (with a few notable exceptions) are facing roughly south-south-west.  This is nowhere near the direction to face Jerusalem, whether you hold by a \"flat-earth\" Rhumb line (east) or a Great Circle line (north-east) - see <a href=\"http://www.myzmanim.com/messagebox.aspx?messageid=direction\">here</a> for explanation.</p>\n\n<p>I'm intrigued to know what the historical reasons are for this, when by shifting the Aron Hakodesh 90 degrees to the left they could have come very close to the Rhumb line direction, at ESE?  And if it's because the buildings on the grid are typically elongated along the SSW-NNE axis, and it's better <em>feng shui</em>/practical layout to have the Aron on a narrow wall, then why choose to face SSW over NNE, when NNE is very close to the Great Circle direction, and is at least somewhat closer to the Rhumb line?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Manhattan Island points SSW to NNE so all the properties on the grid will also face in that direction. The buildings also have a narrow streetfront and go back longer. Putting the aron on the East will result in a very wide but short synagogue with the entrance on only side. To get to the women's section one would have to pass through the men's section unless some fancy corridor is introduced. Also, the rabbi will be facing a smaller proportion of the congregation so fewer people will hear him well.</p>\n\n<p>The shotgun shaped schul with the entrance at the front does not have these problems and needs less special building to work well.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Insurance against משיח\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bloghd.blogspot.co.il/2004/11/messiah-clause.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">According to this rather amusing blog post</a>, there is apparently a common clause in rental contracts in Jerusalem, called the Messiah clause, in which, when a landlord outside of Israel rents out a property in Jerusalem, should משיח arrive while the renter is living in the property, either the lease is canceled and the renter must move out (to allow the landlord to return to Zion and have a place to live), or the renter must move into a spare room to allow the landlord to move in.</p>\n\n<p>In one such case as told in the blog post, a prospective renter did not want to sign the contract with the clause in it, so his lawyer suggested taking out an insurance policy to pay out enough money to provide the renter the ability to find a new home should משיח come while he was under the lease.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, would such an insurance policy violate the principle of believing in the coming of the Messiah?  Would it be acceptable for the purchaser of the policy (because they are not assuming it <em>won't</em> happen, and they are, in fact, <em>literally preparing for</em> his arrival) but not for the seller of the policy (because the seller is essentially betting that משיח won't come, or else he will have to pay out the policy coverage amount and stop collecting the premiums)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is an unsourced logical argument that buying or selling such a policy does not imply a lack of faith in the coming of moshiach.</p>\n\n<p>Do we say that the writer of a life-insurance policy is betting that the buyer won't die, so he won't have to pay out?  No; rather, the insurance company is making an actuarial/financial calculation by which they believe they make money on the deal by collecting premiums now and paying out later.  Granted that life-insurance policies can have exclusions (war, suicide, etc), while I wouldn't expect this to apply to a moshiach policy, but most life-insurance policies pay out so the seller is not <em>just</em> making a statement about expected outcome.  So I don't think the seller of a moshiach-insurance policy necessarily has an emunah problem.</p>\n\n<p>What about the buyer?  One possibility is raised in the question: he is <em>preparing</em> for the moshiach, making provisions for that happy day.  If this is a common lease condition and he would otherwise not be able to rent in Israel at all, isn't he better off renting and having to move than being stuck abroad without even a room to stay in (or money with which to rent one)?</p>\n\n<p>Further, if buying an insurance policy that makes you move is a problem, then wouldn't selling property that you own in Israel be an even bigger problem?  In the insurance case you're accepting inconvenience in order to have a place to live; in the homeowner case you're giving up a sure thing, meaning you'd have no place to live when moshiach comes.  Yet I'm not aware of halacha that forbids selling property in Israel once you own it.  (Who you sell it to doesn't seem germane.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't believe such a \"Moshiach clause\" would violate the principle of believing in Moshiach's coming rather it is considered a normal business practice for precautionary measure. I base this on the opinion of R. Eliezer Deutsch (d. 1916, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1396&st=&pgnum=199\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peat HaSadeh 2:44</a>) with regards to taking out an insurance policy which would provide funds for the policy holder's offspring. He maintains that this does not demonstrate lack of faith in God's providing of man's sustenance as it has become an ordinary business move, inasmuch as the holder ultimately acknowledges God's providence. </p>\n\n<p>A nice survey, including a treatment of R. Deutsch's responsum, can be found in Rabbi Menachem Slae's 'Insurance In The Halachah' (201ff.). Such is also the opinion of R. Ovadiah Yosef (Yechaveh Daat vol. 3 §85; a summary of which can be found <a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/he/default.aspx?HalachaID=412\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) who also adds that the practice of only providing a day's worth of income was exclusive to the <em>hassidim</em> (punctilious, those going beyond the letter of the law) whereas for the average person it is normal to take action for the next day's income. See also Rabbi Yaacov H. Fish's 'VeHerachta Yamim (334f.) where it can be implied that he too was of the opinion that insurance against certain scenarios would not demonstrate lack of faith; on the contrary, it may be even a <em>segulah</em> for longevity. </p>\n\n\n",

This is similar to what it says about two who run in a public thoroughfare and damage one another while running: that the damaging party is not liable, because anyone running in a public thoroughfare knows that others also have the right to run in a thoroughfare and that, when two such runners meet, damage is likely.</p>\n<p>…When two are running, it's not because of forgiveness [of liability] alone [that there's no liability] but because both did an act of damage.

    "content": "# Excommunication in Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the process for excommunication in Judaism? I'm familiar with excommunication in the Catholic Church and was told that the process is different in Judaism.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Back when there was a formal, central body of Jewish legislators, the <em>Sanhedrin</em>, they would occasionally excommunicate someone. The most common instance that we have recorded in the Talmud is for a rabbi who refuses to submit to the final ruling of the Sanhedrin and continues to <em>publicly rule for others</em> in a different direction. E.g. the Sanhedrin took a vote and declared that Yom Kippur is Tuesday this year, but one rabbi thought it should be Sunday instead. No one is going to know or care whether that rabbi is eating on Sunday, but he could be excommunicated if he was publicly telling all his followers to observe Yom Kippur on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>It's believed that the last classical Sanhedrin convened sometimes in the late 300s, to formalize the Jewish calendar as we have it today.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, it's been a bit looser. A communal body was entitled to enact policies, and threaten excommunications with those that would not follow them. Judaism's ban on polygamy, for instance, was made about a thousand years ago by the communal leaders of French and German Jewry for their communities. </p>\n\n<p>Given the free society in which we live today, excommunications are very rare and rarely effective. In Eastern Europe in the mid 1700s there was a fierce debate between those who respected Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschutz, and those who viewed him as a dangerous adherent of a false messiah. Lo and behold, each side declared an excommunication on the other side, and when everyone is excommunicated, no one is excommunicated. So the measure ceased to have much force.</p>\n\n<p>There are some exceptions today:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the spirit of the above Yom Kippur example, a local rabbinate could declare a <em>local individual</em> as <em>persona non grata</em> for publicly refusing to accept its policy. This is used rarely. For instance, the rabbinic establishment of Johannesburg has concluded that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genypterus_capensis\">kingklip</a> (which is biologically a cousin of a cod, but looks like an eel) is a kosher fish, but there is one Johannesburg rabbi who keeps vociferously insisting it's not. (No one is asking him to eat it, just to tone down his criticism.) He is allowed to pray in Johannesburg synagogues, but not to receive any ritual honors there. Again, this is a local matter. If a rabbi in New York (where no one has heard of kingklip) says it is or isn't kosher, that's none of Johannesburg's business.</li>\n<li><em>Communal sanctions</em> can be declared against someone acting in a really bad manner, with varying degrees of success. <a href=\"http://www.getora.org\">This website</a>, for example, lists men who have exhaustively refused every reasonable effort at allowing their ex-wives to remarry through a Jewish divorce process. Local activist groups will arrange protests outside their homes, and synagogues are urged to deny them honors, or even admittance. But again, that's only as strong as the local synagogue's decision (and that of its individual congregants) to implement it, and the clout of the group declaring the sanction. Ideally it would even include \"don't talk to this fellow or do business with him.\" But if the fellow has no interest in remaining connected to the Jewish community, or can find a different synagogue that ignores the sanction (or doesn't feel bound by the opinions of whatever group issued it), there's little that can be done.</li>\n<li>The only communities today, at least in the US, where we truly see strong top-down leadership and really tight cohesiveness are Hassidic ones. I know of a non-Hassidic social worker who was challenging the way her Hassidic neighbors were developing nearby property, and was threatened with excommunication by that Hassidic sect. The excommunication wouldn't have bothered her from a spiritual perspective; but the driver of her commuter bus, her baker, her florist, and her grocer were all members of this sect who would be prohibited from doing business with her if an excommunication was ordered. When she explained the situation to her non-Hassidic rabbi, he exclaimed, \"wow I've been trying to get myself excommunicated by them for years! Do you have any tips?\"</li>\n<li><em>Rabbinic organizations</em> such as the Rabbinical Council of America have processes to expel a member rabbi. (Occasionally this could occur over strictly theological matters, e.g. the rabbi is a law-abiding US citizen who publishes a book denying the existence of God; but more often this occurs when a rabbi has done something that, if done by a lawyer, would get him disbarred -- e.g. arrested for million-dollar fraud.) But once again, that's only as strong as the clout of that rabbinic organization. There are many different organizations with different viewpoints. But a rabbi expelled from the RCA, for instance, will have a hard time finding a job in the kind of synagogue that usually expects to see \"a typical RCA-looking man\" in the pulpit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

If not, why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>There are a few hints to the Oral Torah in the Chumash, but nothing explicit.</p>\n\n<p>One of these is found in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9976#v=21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 12:21</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וְזָבַחְתָּ</strong> מִבְּקָרְךָ וּמִצֹּאנְךָ אֲשֶׁר נָתַן יְהֹוָה לְךָ\n  <strong>כַּאֲשֶׁר צִוִּיתִךָ</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>you may slaughter</strong> of your cattle and of your sheep, which the Lord has\n  given you, <strong>as I have commanded you</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem is that we don't find any command of how to slaughter in the Torah. So the Talmud writes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=28&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chulin 28a</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דתניא רבי אומר וזבחת כאשר צויתיך מלמד שנצטוה משה על הושט ועל הקנה ועל\n  רוב אחד בעוף ועל רוב שנים בבהמה</p>\n  \n  <p>As was taught in a <em>braysa</em>, Rebbi (R Yehudah HaNassi) says, \"וזבחת\n  כאשר צויתיך\" teaches that Moshe was taught (<strong><em>orally</em></strong>) on the esophagus and\n  trachea (that they need to be cut so that the slaughter is kosher),\n  and on רוב אחד בעוף (that most of one of the above need to be cut for\n  the slaughter of birds to be kosher) and on רוב שנים בבהמה (that most\n  of the food pipe and most of the wind pipe need to be cut for the\n  slaughter of animals to be kosher)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also brought down by the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37555/5323\">Simlah Chadasha</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35269&st=&pgnum=9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:1</a>), and discussed in my question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/45294/5323\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I would like to supplement the important answers which precede mine:</p>\n\n<p>The \"Oral Torah\" is mentioned \"explicitly\" in the sense that [according to our tradition] it is the subject being directly referred to in places such as the verse cited in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/48577/899\">DanF's answer</a>. On the other hand, the \"concept\" or \"doctrine\" of Oral Torah is <em>not</em> stated explicitly in the same manner as many other concepts are only mentioned obliquely (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/45280/899\">resurrection of the dead</a>, afterlife) or without full explanation (\"angels\") in the written Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Yet despite not being \"explicitly\" taught, the written Torah is not self-sufficient for the implementation of its commandments and a number of important <em>mitzvos</em> implicitly demand recourse to an outside \"living\" body of knowledge.  Notably, while we can learn certain things about the Torah's calendar from the written Torah we could not carry it out on the basis of the written Torah alone. Ironically some communities who rejected the Oral Torah objected to the \"Rabbinic\" move away from establishing the new moon by witnesses, a practice known from the Oral Torah but near as I can tell not explicitly mentioned in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly it would be <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12878/899\">impossible to identify which day was the seventh day</a> for the observance of the Sabbath based off of the written Torah. Nor does the written Torah give explicit guidance on what constitutes a <em>melachah</em> (\"work) on the Sabbath despite decreeing the ultimate penalty for Sabbath desecration.</p>\n\n<p>In our own day we see the need for an outside body of knowledge (and what happens when it is lost) regarding the issue of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7554/why-is-techeles-not-universally-accepted\"><em>techeles</em></a>, while others might argue that any source for the \"color\" would be fine according to the written Torah it is not at all clear what color we would be looking for without resort to outside information to explain to us what color \"techeles\" is, never mind its source or how to process it.</p>\n\n<p>Then there are other areas where we see apparent allusions, Shokhet <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/48574/899\">has mentioned</a> that the Torah alludes to a command regarding ritual slaughter that isn't discussed otherwise in the written Torah. How to to produce <em>tefillin</em> (without a reason we should believe that it wasn't a literal command). Perhaps most significantly the written Torah establishes a court of seventy elders with broad authority but without much explicit discussion otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Why G-d opted for the written Torah to require external information in order to observe the <em>mitzvos</em> may require a number of answers, but that it does is a matter of fact.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>According to the introduction to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49619&st=&pgnum=71\">Rambam's Mishnah Torah</a> the Torah does mention the Oral law in the verse <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&st=&pgnum=398\">Shmot (Ex) 24:12</a>. My loose translation:</p>\n\n<p>\"... I shall give you the stone tablets, <em>the Torah and the mitzvah</em> that I have written to teach them\".</p>\n\n<p>Ramba\"m explains that the word \"Torah\" means the written law, and the word \"mitzvah\" means the Oral Law.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, this requires exegetical methods to determine the method of how he inferred this. So, when you say in your question, \"explicit\" meaning, \"Does the Torah say the actual words, \"Oral Law\", the answer is, no. But, according to Ramba\"m, the Torah does explicitly mention this. (We may get into semantics of what the term \"explicit\" means, in this case...)</p>\n\n<p>I can't say as to why the specific words \"Oral Law\" are not mentioned. Perhaps, at the time that the Torah was written, which according to many beliefs (I think Ramba\"m included) that it preceded the creation of the world, maybe when G-d created man, there was an initial expectation that man's level of understanding would be so high that he would be able to immediately understand all the nuances of the Torah as written without further translation?</p>\n\n<p>Another possibility - When I first learned Chumash in 2nd grade, we were told to translate the Hebrew words, literally, without looking in Rash\"i or any other commentaries. (Yes, I had a very high-functioning demanding yeshiva. I wish others would model this example, today.) The teacher wanted you to really toil in the Torah. Rashi was like the \"Monarch Notes\". In a similar sense, perhaps, God wants people to toil and work over the literal translation a bit, and think it through prior to getting the explanation? Again, conjecture on both of my answers...</p>\n\n\n",

Should he bring it with wheat or not at all?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>By making the neder to bring a mincha with barley when he knows it is not possible, this person is making a neder in vain – a neder shov. </p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.co.il/nedarim/insites/nd-dt-015.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">INSIGHTS INTO THE DAILY DAF Nedarim 15</a> I see that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The RAN (end of Nedarim 14b) writes that there is no Isur of \"Neder\n  Shav,\" a Neder made in vain, as there is an Isur of Shevu'as Shav, a\n  Shevu'ah made in vain.... (it means that) there is no Neder\n  altogether.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So he does not have to bring anything.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>TOSFOS in Gitin (35a, as cited by the GILYON HA'SHAS) and\n  the ROSH here rule that although Malkus is not administered for making\n  a Neder Shav, one still is not allowed to make a Neder which he cannot\n  fulfill. The verse says, \"Lo Yachel Devaro\" -- \"he shall not profane\n  his word\" (Bamidbar 30:3). One who makes a Neder that he cannot\n  fulfill transgresses the prohibition against profaning his word.</p>\n  \n  <p>(He is not punished with Malkus because his transgression is a \"Lav\n  she'Ein Bo Ma'aseh\" (it involves no physical action). Although a\n  Shevu'as Shav is also a \"Lav she'Ein Bo Ma'aseh\" and yet one is\n  punished with Malkus for transgressing that Lav, this is because a\n  special verse in the Torah teaches that Malkus is given for the \"Lav\n  she'Ein Bo Ma'aseh\" of Shevu'as Shav.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At all events he does not need to bring a mincha.</p>\n\n\n",

Though I don't know how old they are by the end of the perek, they are at least 13. Then in perek 26, there is a famine and Yitzchak must go to Gerar. Though he goes with his wife, no mention is made of his taking his twins with him. The next mention of the children is with Eisav's getting married at the age of 40.</p>\n\n<p>If the famine was severe how did Ya'akov and Eisav survive? Did they go down to Gerar with their parents and it wasn't mentioned (which would make the artifice of \"She is my sister\" unbelievable) or were they not born yet and this chapter actually precedes the events of the previous chapter?</p>\n\n<p>I know that there is no authoritative <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/17220/1362\">list</a> of examples of \"ein mukdam\" but are there any commentaries which claim that this is out of order, or otherwise explain the omission of the two sons from the events (even if they were approaching 40, they would still need to eat).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is from memory from various meforshim (I do not have the sources here). I wrote this up previously but have not been able to find where I did so.</p>\n\n<p>We have the medrashim that Eisav was already leading a band of men. These men were the \"family defense force\". That is why the servants of Avimelech were unable to attack Yitzchak and instead resorted to \"lawfare\". That is suing him and claiming that the water in the wells that he dug belonged to them. This means that they were grown up and were independent already.</p>\n\n<p>This is part of why Yitzchak thought that Eisav was still part of the family and helping to support it. He had the idea that Eisav would deal with the outside world and Yaakov would be in charge of the relationship with Hashem. It would be similar to the Yissachar and Zevulun partnership. See Rav Hirsch commentary on Toldos 27:29 as an example.</p>\n\n<p>While we do have those that maintain the principle of \"ain mukdam umeuchar baTorah\" (the stories in the Torah are not necessarily in chronological order), we do not resort to this unless it is absolutely necessary. In this case, it does not appear to be necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Also the description of the famine and the leaving, seems to have occurred after the death of Avraham. Since we have no mention of Avraham during the growth of the boys until the sale of the birthright (see the medrash that the lentil soup was for the funeral meal of Avraham), it would appear that the famine did not occur in that time. Otherwise, Avraham and his treaty with Avimelech would have been mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the fact that Avimelech felt free to exile Yitzchak seems to imply that Avraham was not around.</p>\n\n<p>It seems logical that had the famine occurred during the life of Avraham, he would have gone along with the family.</p>\n\n<p>Sice this famine then occured at least 75+ years after the original treaty with Avimelech, it appears that Avimelech's son (at least) is the one mentioned here. AviMelech appears to be an official title, since only a king can be the father of the next king (given legitimate inheritance).</p>\n\n<p>Note that Rav Hirsch suggests that פי כל as two words would mean \"the mouth of everybody\" , the commander. It could also mean the chief adviser (my own suggestion).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramban takes for granted that they took their sons with them to Gerar and explains that no-one asked about them because they told themselves that they were his sons from a different woman.</p>\n\n\n",

They based it off of the Shulchan Aruch Harav (Seder Birchas Hanehenin 8:8):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכֵן אֹכֶל שֶׁנִּמּוֹחַ כָּל כָּךְ עַד שֶׁרָאוּי לַשְּׁתִיָּה – יָצָא מִתּוֹרַת אֹכֶל. וְכֵן מַשְׁקֶה שֶׁנִּקְרַשׁ עַד שֶׁרָאוּי לַאֲכִילָה – יָצָא מִתּוֹרַת מַשְׁקֶה, אֲפִלּוּ יֵשׁ בּוֹ טוֹפֵחַ עַל מְנָת לְהַטְפִּיחַ</p>\n<p>Similarly, food that has dissolved to the extent that it can be drunk is removed from the halachic category of food. So too, a liquid that has congealed to the extent that it can be eaten is removed from the halachic category of a liquid, even if it is [sufficiently] moist to impart moisture [to something else that touches it].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Ovadia Yosef, however, says in Yabia Omer (pt. 8 siman 25,6):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכאורה נראה שלפי זה האוכל שוקולדה, ואינו לועס אותה בשניו, אלא מוצץ וממחה אותה בפיו, אין לדונו כאוכל, כיון שלא לעס אותה בשניו, ולכן אפי' אם אכל כזית ויותר אינו מברך ברכה אחרונה, ורק אם לעס אותה בשיניו, ואכל כזית בתוך כדי אכילת פרס, מברך ברכה אחרונה.</p>\n<p>And it seems that according to this, one who eats chocolate, but doesn't chew it rather sucks it and dissolves it in his mouth, is not considered food, since he didn't chew it with his teeth, therefore even if he ate a <em>kezayis</em> or more, he doesn't say a <em>b'racha achrona</em>. Only if he chewed it with his teeth and ate a <em>kezayis</em> within <em>achilas p'ras</em>, does he say a <em>b'racha achrona</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The same could definitely be said for yogurt, which is never chewed and starts off as a liquid. The minchas Yitzchak (chelek 2 siman 110) also says anything that isn't sucked or chewed is a drink, which would include yogurt.</p>\n<p>Therefore, sefardim (at least those who pasken like rav Ovadia) would treat yogurt like a drink.

The gemora concludes that there is no dispute in the matter, but rather the first way applies to those who live in Eretz Yisroel where earning a livelihood is easy and so being married will not interfere with a person’s ability to learn, and the second way applies to those who live in Bavel where earning a livelihood is hard, and therefore it is better to first go to learn before he has a millstone around his neck.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now, when Ya’akov left Be’er Sheva he was very wealthy and could easily support a family.

But that is impossible, for afterward it's written \"And he encountered the place,\" and this was before his coming to Charan. And it would be forced to answer that \"And he went\" is like it sounds - that he came to Charan, and that afterward, [the Scripture] returns to describe what he encountered on the way, since that's not the Scripture's way. Therefore, [Rashi] explained \"He departed to go [to Charan].\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(my translation)</p>\n<p>It sounds to me like Rashi's saying simply that Ya'akov departed to go on a trip to Charan, and then he had the nighttime ladder experience on the way.</p>\n\n\n",

It is presumed that the \"Holy Scrolls\" were written in Hebrew.  This tradition of reading the Torah in Hebrew likely goes back to the prophet Ezra, and may extend even further than this.  So it is unlikely that a Jewish community would ever have substituted a Greek Torah scroll for a Hebrew one in a public reading.</p>\n\n<p>As to why a Jewish community would have a Greek sefer Torah in the first place, we need to consider the historical significance of the Septuagint.  The Septuagint (sometimes abbreviated as the LXX) was a Greek translation of the Torah believed to have been written in the 2nd century BCE.  For Jewish communities whose first language was Greek, such as Alexandria and possibly Qumran, the Septuagint was a valuable and revered book at that time.  From the 2nd century BCE until roughly the 2nd century CE, Jews living in these communities used the Septuagint for study and reference.  Scrolls were the norm in those days, so if a Jewish community wanted to have a Greek sefer Torah, such as the Septuagint, they would have a Greek scroll.</p>\n\n\n",

In his words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רק ניכר כונת הנוב\"י שחשש פן יחתכו כל המתים ללמוד מהם וגם ניכר כונת\nאדמו\"ר (החת\"ס) כי חשש על דברי הרמב\"ן קללת אלקים תלוי וכו)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are numerous sources where we find dispensations in Halacha משום שלום מלכות, although there was no specific סכנה yet. (See B\"K 83a & Beis Yosef YD 178; Rambam Hil. Korban Pesach 3:1 and Kesef Mishne; Sanhedrin 26a [Tos. <em>misherabu</em>])</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> According to the <em>pashtus</em> of the Node Beyhuda and Chasam Sofer, it would be forbidden to do something for a future <em>sakanah</em>. However, the Chazon Ish explains that if there is a strong likelihood that this action will help save future lives, it is permitted.</p>\n\n\n",

It appears that after prolonged confrontations with the early Christians, that based their religion on pure beliefs and dismissed rites, Rabbis chose the path of actions, developing practical Mishnah and Talmud that focus on details of everyday rituals rather than additional interpretational Midrashim. As it says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.1.17?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei_Avot.1.17</a>): \"וְלֹא הַמִּדְרָשׁ הוּא הָעִקָּר, אֶלָּא הַמַּעֲשֶׂה.\" \"Study is not the most important thing, but actions;\", and there are many similar sayings about the utmost importance of the actions.</p>\n<p>I would agree with <a href=\"https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/the-true-orthoprax-nature-of-the-jewish-tradition/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"the Times of Israel</a> that in Judaism we derive beliefs from actions, not the other way around. A person that keeps Shabbos is testifying his belief in seven-days Creation, a person that davens is testifying that God controls the happenings, a person that keeps Seder Pesah testifies of the Exodus, etc.</p>\n<p>Here's a test, I light a lighter on Shabbos in my shul just for fun. The reaction? I'm finished. But if I say out loud in the middle of a prayer that I don't believe in God, people will chuckle and think I'm going through hard times, maybe advise me to seek Rabbinic help.</p>\n<p>Your example is different because a person openly asserts the insincerity of his actions which basically invalidates them and makes him technically totally secular. But had we not known his true intentions and only hear him denying God's existence, we'd judge by his actions rather than his words.</p>\n<p>There's a reason that Halachicly a Jew is strictly required to prove his beliefs in actions, so putting Teffilin and reading Shemah out loud are mandatory while reciting the 13 Principles is not.</p>\n\n\n",

The Netziv is adding to this important message by saying even the true Semites that still lived there and even had land called after their own name were still swept up in this revolution and their land was no longer considered under Semetic domain, necessitating Hashem's assurance. Being that the entire focus here is on property ownership and not the human family affiliation, Avraham is not a player, he owned no land in Canaan to speak of.</p>\n\n\n",

The second time of saying this was with regards to the flock of sheep he saw. It was then that he realised that he might have to claim them by force, and could be rest assured that he would have Divine assistance by virtue of the fact that despite Lavan being an evil man, he was his mother's brother and thus could rely on his mother's merits. The final time it makes reference to Lavan as his uncle, was when he gave the flock to drink. And it was precisely because Lavan was his mother's brother that he immediately gave his heart to them for grazing and watering and guarding them from plunder from other fields.</p>\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.29.10.1-2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachaye</a></strong> first answers similar to the HaKsav VeHakabbalah but also provides <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.29.10.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">another answer</a>. He writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is yet another reason for the repeated mention of the words אחי אמו, brother of his mother.” Whenever a person hears or sees an object he desires, he is suddenly capable of performing tasks which he cannot perform in order to secure something which his heart does not covet. The reader of this passage could be forgiven if he had thought that seeing Yaakov was taken with Rachel’s beauty he desired her physically and this is what gave him the strength to move the rock single-handedly. <strong>The Torah refers time and again to the fact that Lavan was the brother of Yaakov’s mother in order to make us aware that physical passion had nothing to do with Yaakov’s sudden burst of strength in moving the rock</strong>. The Torah was so concerned not to create the impression that Yaakov’s sudden burst of strength was inspired by passion that instead of writing: “as soon as Yaakov set eyes on Rachel he rolled the rock, etc.,” the Torah wrote instead (in a somewhat clumsy style) “it was when Yaakov saw Rachel the daughter of Lavan, the brother of his mother, and the flock of Lavan the brother of his mother, Yaakov approached and rolled the rock etc.” (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It is disputed there whether or not to do this at all, with many rishonim ignoring this practice, the Rambam for instance. But Rabbeinu Yona, brought in many achronim says a Yorei shomaim should do this, being that the Torah gave Kavod to both sides, the right side for placing of blood for a Metzora and chalitzah, and to the left side as we tie Tephilin on the left arm. The Levush gives another reason to compare shoe tying to tephilin being that in chulin 89a the mitzvos of tzitzis and the retzuos of tephilin were given to Avraham's children as a reward for him telling the king of Sedom 'from a string to a shoelace'. The Mishna Berurah and Pischei Tshuva say concerning gloves which need tying, that is not to put on the right first and tie the left first, being that according to the reasoning of the Levush, this din only applies to shoes. \nIt would seem after all is said and done, this also only applies to laces, not other means of fastening. \nAlso even according to the simplistic reading of the gemara and Rabbeinu Yona, velcro would have no place in the laws of tying Tephilin, and as such should not come in to the discussion. </p>\n\n\n",

(I see that another comment says the opposite, but doesn't explain.) Here is why I think so:<br />\nBoth of them say that Hashem is in charge of every outcome. Chovos Halevavos (Introduction):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But one who trusts in G-d, is immune from sickness and disease except\nas an atonement or to increase his reward.<br />\nוהבוטח באלהים בטחונו חזק\nבאלהים שיטריף אותו כרצונו בעת שירצה ובמקום שירצה<br />\nBut one who trusts\nin G-d, has strong peace of mind that G-d will provide for him at any\ntime He wishes and in any place.<br />\nוהבוטח בה' הוא תובע מסבות הטרף מה\nשיש בו יותר מנוחה לגופו ושם טוב לו ופנאי ללבו ומה שהוא מפיק יותר\nלחובות תורתו עם יתר אמונתו כי הסבה לא תוסיף לו בחקו ולא תחסרהו ממנו\nמאומה אלא בגזרת האלהים יתברך<br />\nBut one who trusts G-d, selects among\nthe different occupations one which is easy on his body, allows him to\nearn a good reputation, does not consume his mind, and is best suited\nfor fulfilling his torah obligations and the principles of his faith,\nbecause the choice of occupation will neither increase nor decrease\nthe income he will earn unless G-d decreed so...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And many other examples.<br />\n[Don't think that he's saying, Everything will be great! You won't get sick, you won't be poor! I can see that someone might read some of them that way, which may be why people think the Chovos Halevavos argues with the Chazon Ish. We'll see soon that he doesn't believe that at all. He is saying what we all do believe: Hashem is in precise charge of all outcomes.]</p>\n<p>The Chovos Halevavos' definition of bitachon (section 1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַךְ מַהוּת הַבִּטָּחוֹן הִיא מְנוּחַת נֶפֶשׁ הַבּוֹטֵחַ וְשֶׁיִּהְיֶה\nלִבּוֹ סָמוּךְ עַל מִי שֶׁבָּטַח עָלָיו שֶׁיַּעֲשֶׂה הַטּוֹב\nוְהַנָּכוֹן לוֹ בָּעִנְיָן אֲשֶׁר יִבְטַח עָלָיו כְּפִי יְכָלְתּוֹ\nוְדַעְתּוֹ בְּמָה שֶׁמֵּפִיק טוֹבָתוֹ.<br />\nTrust is peace of mind of the\none who trusts. That one relies in his heart that the one he trusts in\nwill do what is good and proper for him on the matter he has trusted\nhim with, according to his ability and his understanding of what will\nfurther his good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The בוטח is certain that Hashem has his good in mind, and he is sure the Hashem will do what is best for him. He explains this in even more detail in section 2.<br />\n<em>However</em>, it is clear in many places that the Chovos Halevavos believes that the \"best for him\" might not be what we naively call \"good\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Introduction) One who trusts in G-d, if he has wealth, will be quick to fulfill his\nmonetary obligations to G-d and to men with a willing and generous\nspirit. <em>If he does not have wealth</em>, he will consider that lack of\nwealth to be among the favors of G-d to him, because he is exempt from\nthe monetary obligations to G-d and men which wealth brings, and he is\nspared from the mental distraction of protecting and managing it...<br />\n<em>If his wealth is lost</em>, he will not worry nor mourn his loss. Rather,\nhe will thank his Creator for taking back His deposit, just like he\nthanked G-d when it was given to him. He will be happy with his\nportion...<br />\n<em>If one's merchandise does not sell, or if he is unable to collect his\ndebts, or if he is struck by illness</em>, because he knows that the\nCreator is in charge of his life and knows best what is good for\nhim...<br />\n(Section 4) A man is necessarily in either one of two situations: Either he is a\nloner or he is among his family and relatives. <em>If he is a loner</em>, let\nhis companionship be with G-d during his time of loneliness, and trust\nin Him during his period of being alone... And afterwards, let him\nconsider that as a stranger, he is freed from the heavy burden of\nmaintaining relatives and fulfilling his duties towards them. He\nshould consider this to be one of the kindnesses of the Creator...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Chovos Halevavos, it is perfectly possible for the one who has complete trust in Hashem to be poor, to be ill, and/or to be alone - if that is what Hashem decides is best for him. His bitachon will not save him; indeed, he will trust that Hashem chose that for him, instead of what he would have thought was best.<br />\nIs this not exactly what the Chazon Ish is saying?<br />\n[The Chazon Ish doesn't talk about how Hashem always chooses the best thing for us, because his topic is how it looks to us, whether it is always what we would choose, or not. But of course the Chazon Ish is going to agree with that part as well; of course he understands that Hashem is all good and loves us.]</p>\n<p>The Chovos Halevavos has a lengthy section on the benefits that bitachon brings (start with the Introduction, then also in section 5). The בוטח has peace of mind, it doesn't bother him when things go wrong (again, but they can go wrong!), other people love him because they can trust him, he doesn't go overboard doing difficult or dangerous things to earn his living (see perek 5 in the Chazon Ish on this), along with other benefits.<br />\nHowever! The author <em>never</em> says that one of the benefits is that he'll get whatever he wants, if he believes in it. On the contrary, the role of the בוטח is to understand that whatever he gets is just what he needs.<br />\nIn summary, I think that if you put the pieces together, you'll see that the Chovos Halevavos is a more lengthy exposition of the Chazon Ish.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Caveat - In his introduction, the Chovos Halevavos does mention a flip side:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if one does not place his trust in G-d, he will place his trust in\nsomething else, and whoever trusts in something other than G-d, the\nAl-mighty will remove His providence from such a person, and leave him\nin the hands of the one he trusted,...<br />\nIf he places his trust in his wisdom and tactics, physical strength\nand industriousness...<br />\nIf he relies on his wealth...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So that is a caveat: A person who <em>lacks</em> trust will definitely end up with <em>worse</em> outcomes, because Hashem's response will be to turn him over כביכול to a much worse steward.<br />\nIn that case, a person can definitely improve his situation by working on his bitachon, and get back to the stewardship of Hashem.<br />\nOn the other hand, even that might not <em>look</em> better to us, though it would definitely <em>be</em> better.</p>\n<p>And on the other flip side, the Chovos Halevavos kind of rejects the idea of bitachon for someone who doesn't want to serve Hashem (section 3):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But, If one trusts in G-d and rebels against Him, how foolish is he,\nhow weak is his intellect and his understanding! For he can see in\nthis world that if an employer appoints a man to do something or\nrefrain from doing something and the man disobeys the instruction,\n<em>this will be the strongest factor in the employer's refusing to\nfulfill his side of the deal</em>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That too leads to bad outcomes.</p>\n<p>The Chazon Ish is much briefer on all of this last part - how בטחון changes outcomes - so I can't guarantee a perfect match. He does talk about it very briefly, though. See what he writes in his last section there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש עוד ממדת הבטחון, כי על הבוטח שורה רוח קודש ומתלוה עמו רוח עוז\nהמבשרו כי אמנם יעזרהו ה', כמו שאמר דוד המלך ע\"ה אם תחנה עלי מחנה לא\nיירא לבי, אם בקום עלי מלחמה כו' וזה ענין מתחלף לפי מעלת הבוטח ורב קדשו<br />\nThere is more to say about bitachon. On one who trusts rests a holy\nspirit and a spirit of strength, which proclaims that in truth Hashem\n<em>will</em> help him. As David Hamelech ע\"ה said, \"If they camp against me, I will not fear; if a war rises against me [in this I will trust]...\". But this is a matter\nthat <strong>depends on the [spiritual] level of the one who trusts and his level of holiness</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bitachon is <em>not</em> simply a matter of acceptance (as I think some of the comments here assume). It can tell you things and give you actual confidence of success. You see, though, that he says it depends on the <em>overall</em> spiritual level of the בוטח, not on his degree of trust. If his level is high enough, he can know that Hashem will aid him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Update: Perhaps another piece of evidence is the Introduction of the Shaar Habitachon, which talks about the advantages (תועלת) that bitachon brings. The author divides it into two sections: Advantages for keeping the Torah (ענין תורה), and advantages in the world (ענין עולם). In the <em>first</em> section he talks about how Hashem helps a person with bitachon, including enabling him to focus on the Torah because he has peace of mind since Hashem gives him resources; I brought a few examples above (could be <em>all</em> the examples people bring are from that particular section). But in the second section (about advantages in the world) he brings nothing like that at all. He doesn't say that the בוטח is more likely to have food, or a comfortable life, or is less likely to get sick, or anything of the sort. He says he'll have peace of mind, that he'll find it easier to deal with difficulties, and that he'll be able to justify choosing a type of work that is easier and doesn't take him on long journeys - that is, things that are results of his own improved attitude.<br />\nHe could and should have discussed these other \"advantages\" there. All these examples that people bring, I think he is really just treating them as aspects of how the בוטח is able to use his attitude and understanding to focus on proper service to Hashem.</p>\n<p>Similar is section 4. He describes there seven different aspects of life, and explains exactly what is <em>proper trust</em> for each those aspects. What do we believe about trusting in Hashem as regards other people in our lives, what do we believe about trusting in Hashem as regards Olam Haba...<br />\nThe first of the seven is about the בוטח's personal needs. According to those who claim to learn differently from the Chazon Ish, this should have been divided into two parts: the part that is <em>guaranteed</em> to a בוטח (say, enough food to live), and the part that he should leave up to Hashem. Or maybe, \"You should trust that if you have the right level of bitachon, the results will be different.\" Something. That's supposed to be the topic here: What exactly does a בוטח believe?<br />\nWhat he actually says is, Do your hishtadlus but all of it is up to Hashem. Period.</p>\n\n\n",

(Even if that's not a stringency, the reason behind not acting stringently in front of your Rebbe could (maybe) apply to things that are not technically a stringency.)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>If I were to break down this question to its bare essentials, I would ask:  Does the rabbi make the Jew, or does the Jew make the rabbi?  In other words, if we see our life as a journey in which we try to move spiritually upon our current plane and attempt to raise ourselves to new levels, can it be that the rabbi who started us on our path is the one with whom we will finish?  Not always, as I will explain below.</p>\n\n<p>My second question focuses on #3:  Is it the beard that makes the Jew or is it the Jew who makes the beard?  I will explain that, also.</p>\n\n<p>Pirkei Avos 1:6 quotes Rabbi Yehoshua ben Perachiah saying: \"Obtain a teacher for yourself, acquire a friend for yourself, and judge everyone favorably.\" These words are a recipe for success:  One should always have a teacher -- a rabbi -- who can be a source of spiritual power that enlightens his way and provides strength as need.  Similarly, the friend plays an important role in creating positive reenforcement and a supportive environment.  Without both, a good teacher and a friend, the Jew has focus and direction in life. </p>\n\n<p>If one looks at the original Hebrew of this teaching, though, it literally reads in Hebrew, \"Make a teacher.\" Rabbi Zalman Baruch Melamed <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=935\" rel=\"nofollow\">writes</a>, you should always have a teacher, and even if your teacher isn't someone who \"appears to be a 'messenger from the Almighty' Himself; even if he is not the most faultless individual on earth, one should not remain without a rabbi.\"  But that raises the question of what do you do when you actually find someone who strikes you as a \"messenger from the Almighty\"?  Do you stay with your old rebbe who cannot meet that standard, or do you move on?  I think since the halacha here is that <strong>we make</strong> the rabbi, we are not required to remain with the same Rav when our soul requires something better.</p>\n\n<p>But as we learn from Yaakov Avinu's vision of the ladder, Gen. 28:12, our spiritual lives are not, and should not be static -- we should be at least trying to rise up the ladder, otherwise we will be pushed down by those trodding upwards.  If our rabbi is only able to move us ten or twelve rungs up the ladder, and no more, and we've reached that level, why must we stop there?  Find a new guiding light to move up more.</p>\n\n<p>There is a famous story about the Satmar Rebbe, Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum, zt'l.  After the war, a Holocaust survivor, R. Elimelech (Mike) Tress, who knew him before the war, would often come to visit and the Rebbe would treat him with great honor.  But the Rebbe's students wondered why a man without a beard would command such respect from the Rebbe when Hasidic custom requires men to be unshaven.  The Rebbe responded:  “In the World to Come when Mike Tress gets there they will ask him, 'Yid, Yid where is your beard?' When you get there, they will ask 'beard, beard, where is your Yid?!'\"  In other words, if the only thing the Satan has against you on your Judgment Day is that you failed to grow a beard, you're doing OK.  Conversely, if the only merit you have is that you did grow a beard, but made many wrong choices, then the beard is a weak defense.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When I was in the conversion process all new comers to shul will think I was the shul's Rabbi as I habe a natural beard but his was trimmed.  Of course the impression wouldn't last as my lack of Hebrew have me away. It wasn't my idea to look more Jewish than most congregants buti felt not looking Jewish enough was hindering and slowing the process. I never asked my Rabbi if it bothered him.  Later on I moved to a different shul. My beard and peyot were longer than the Rabbi's. I did ask if out was ok how my peyot were as I heard him couple of times advocating for natural beard.  He told me was fine.  The bigger the better.  And it isn't a Yemenite or chassidic community.  So ask your Rab instead👍.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See Shulchan Aruch O.H.60 that it's assur to stand during krias shema of the morning (see there for exceptions).\nThe Mishna berurah there brings the halacha that you're not allowed to be (publicly) more stringent than the accepted local custom, since it appears to be haughtiness/yehorah. The exception is for a person who is well known to be a true yorei shomayim (G-d fearing person.)</p>\n\n<p>In that same halacha, he says that <strong>in front</strong> of one's rebbe one may not be more stringent than he even if the talmid is well known to be yorei shomayim, unless the talmid has clear-cut proofs to be more strict. \nHe says this applies also to the mara d'asra/rav of the city, or a gadol hador (who have a din of rabbo muvhk.)</p>\n\n\n",

However, Rivkah didn't think that this would work out so well, because she saw that whatever materialism that Eisav had at the time, was used entirely to please Eisav, and not to further the goals of spiritualism (רוחניות) in any way.

    "content": "# Meaning of the phrase \"Tzur Chevli B'eit Tzarah\" near the end of Adon Olam\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Near the end of Adon Olam, there is the phrase \"Tzur Chevli B'eit Tzarah\". What exactly is the meaning of this phrase, and specifically the term \"Tzur Chevli\"? I have seen it translated rather literally as \"Rock of my pain in my time of distress\" (Artscroll), which does not seem particularly intelligible, at least to me. I have also seen it more or less glossed over like \"The Rock on whom I rely\" (Koren), which, while it makes sense in context, kind of ignores the meaning of the words. (I'm only picking on Artscroll and Koren since I happen to have both siddurim with translation at home). It is entirely possible that I am over-thinking this, and it means something like \"He is a Rock for me when I am in pain, or am in a time of distress\"; however, it seems like the term \"Tzur Chevli\" means something more specific. Any thoughts?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>A possible interpretation can be gleaned from the posuk in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1227.htm#8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yechezkel 27:8</a> where the term rope is used metaphorically to signify the ones steering the ship. And in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08b08.htm#2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shmuel II 8:2</a> ropes are used metaphorically to signify control over life and death.</p>\n\n<p>Thus in keeping with the theme of the piyut that Hashem is “Master of the world”, we praise Hashem by confidently stating that he is “the Rock of my rope(s) in the time of distress” - meaning that Hashem is complete control of my distress. That any suffering which I experience is not due to happenstance (in which case the suffering could be uncontrollably nasty), but comes from Hashem who carefully measures the amount of suffering that I need and that He knows I can bear, and which is being brought upon me intentionally as an atonement, or in order to arouse me to repent, or for some other reason.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16091&st=&pgnum=39&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kehot Annotated Siddur translates</a> it as \"the strength of my lot in times of distress\".</p>\n<p>The \"my lot\" would be like <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0532.htm#9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 32:9</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יַעֲקֹב, חֶבֶל נַחֲלָתוֹ</p>\n<p>Jacob the lot of His inheritance</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Siddur Shay Lamorah quotes Iyun Tefilah that it means that He is my Rock and Refuge (מעוז) to save me from the pains which grab me at a time of trouble.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וצור חבלי - והוא לי צור ומעוז להושיעני מן החבלים אשר יאחזוני בעת צרה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I have looked into this a little in the past, so I can't recall particular sources, but the gist of it is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Some wish to translate it as in \"חבל נחלתו\" and many other instances in which it is used to mean \"my lot\" or \"my portion in life\". This would parallel the other phrase \"מנת כוסי\" in the next line. \"צור חבלי\" would then mean \"the Rock who is my lot in life\", i.e. who is what my life is about. However, this would not satisfy any grammarians, who know that if this was the intention, the <em>chet</em> would have a <em>patach</em> under it: \"חַבלי\". But none of the siddurim have such a vocalization. I have seen one or two old siddurim which have a <em>patach</em>, probably just to be able to translate this way but without any manuscript evidence.</p>\n\n<p>As we have it with a <em>segol</em> under the <em>chet</em>, the word usually means pain as in \"חבלי מות\" or \"חבלי שאול\" or \"חבלי לידה\", which from context probably means a time of unbearable pain. In this case, \"צור חבלי\" would mean \"Rock of my pain\", i.e. my Rock who helps me when I'm in pain, and the following \"בעת צרה\" is a parallelism and emphasizing of \"חבלי\" (with the additional benefit of playing on the words צור/צרה).</p>\n\n<p>An additional possible source for the latter interpretation, I think, is Psalm 18, in which the first few verses express this sentiment of God being always there for you during hard times. Verse 3 refers to God as \"צורי\" as does the author of Adon Olam in this line, and verses 5 and 6 use the phrases \"חבלי מות\" and \"חבלי שאול\" to express painful times. It is possible the author here is alluding to this psalm or using it as a basis for this line of his poem.</p>\n\n\n",

I don't really see how these assumptions connect to the question, other than the first (which has been strangely numbered '0'), but here it is: </p>\n\n<p>0) The 'sanctity' of life (by which I assume you mean the value of preserving it) is not the <em>highest</em> priority in Judaism, though it is fairly high up on the scale. It's hard to really prioritize values in Judaism because sometimes they are given different expression in different cases. (For example, the punishment for violating Shabbos is death by stoning, the most serious forms of capital punishment, but one may violate Shabbos to save a life. On the other hand, it's better to be killed than to violate incest with one's sister, despite the fact that there's no capital punishment for someone who does such a thing. So which is worse, violating Shabbos or incest?) The point is that there are other values or commandments which are more important than preserving life (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=74&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 74a</a>) and one of those values is the preservation of Jewish identity (see Radvaz Teshuvah 4:92). </p>\n\n<p>1) Jerusalem is 'holy' in a legal sense: one cannot bring sacrifices outside of the temple in Jerusalem and cannot eat certain sacrificial meats outside of the city (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=26&daf=14&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shevuos 14</a>-15, among other places) and besides for the legal aspect of it, Jerusalem was/is holy because it is the site of the Shekhina - some manifestation or feeling of God's presence (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/8106.htm#16\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Beis Habechirah 6:16</a>). The reason for Jerusalem's holiness is not because there <em>once was</em> a Temple there in the past, but because that's <em>the place</em> for a Temple - past, present (in theory), and future. (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=9b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Megillah 9b</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/8101.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Beis Habechirah 1:1</a>)</p>\n\n<p>2) The reason for praying towards Jerusalem is either because it is the place of the Shekhina (see above, and as context may imply in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a08.htm#48\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kings I 8:48</a>), or because all of the Jews praying towards one place indicates a unity of purpose/unity of God (see Sifrei VaEschanan 29), or because Jerusalem is somehow the place 'from whence prayers ascend to Heaven', whatever that may mean (Pikrei Derebi Eliezer 35). However, the reason is <strong>not</strong> because of any artifact, nor is it to 'remember the exile'; this rule was in place well before the exile (see Kings I 8:48 and its interpretation in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=30&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berachos 30a</a>). But you are correct that idolatry is prohibited. </p>\n\n<p>Now, the question is, considering that the value of maintaining human life is so great, how could it be that one is allowed to risk one's life (or that of others') for the sake of Jerusalem?</p>\n\n<p>I believe that the answer is that Jerusalem isn't being treated differently than any other part of the Land of Israel, for which one is obligated to give up one's life (see Minchas Chinuch 425, 604). This must be the case, since there is a requirement to conquer the land of Israel, and this could have only be accomplished through soldiers risking their lives- that's how wars work. See also <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/06-03-04/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this short piece</a> by R. Elazar Melamed one the subject of risking life for any piece of land. Of course, not everyone agrees, but you're asking about a particular opinion among many.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In 66, 115, and 132 there were 3 large Jewish revolts against the Roman empire and they all ended disastrously. The rabbis and students who were left holding the pieces of Jewish society realized that if not done right, Jewish revolts were not worth the risk to the continuity of society/torah study.

The T.Y. reasons the necessity was to ensure it would remain hefker, ownerless, so Avraham would be able to use it. I don't understand this reasoning, why would that necessitate its preparation at that specific point so I'm not going to focus on it, but I was wondering in general, what was so special about this ram and its slaughtering that it needed to be prepared at that point in time?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I hope the connected theme will prevent any objections to so many questions. Any answers, partial or full will be appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Bereishis Rabbah (55:8-9) describes how Avraham, who had exerted so much effort into doing the will of Hashem to offer Yitzchak as a karban, felt bad that he wouldn't be able to do so. Thus, when he saw a ram that just happened to be sitting there, he grabbed the opportunity to \"make up\" for it, and he shechted it in place of Yitzchak. The Midrash describes this ram as a \"Temurah\" for Yitzchak. (Note that, obviously, Hashem didn't actually want Yitzchak shechted. This Midrash is to emphasize <em>Avraham's</em> will, not Hashem's.) It seems that the Midrash is explicitly emphasizing the fact that the passuk refers to this ram as being offered \"instead of his son.\"</p>\n\n<p>With this Midrash I believe it's possible to answer all of your questions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>In general, what exactly was the nature of this symbolic sacrifice?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To make up for the fact that Avraham wasn't able to shecht Yitzchak.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>Rashi tells us that with every action involved with the slaughtering of the ram, Avraham prayed that Hashem should consider their actions to have been done to Yitzchok. Did this actually change anything in the historic nature of this event? What if he hadn't slaughtered it, or had slaughter it but hadn't prayed?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once again, Avraham wanted the ram to be a pseudo-Yiztchak. It just shows the great lengths to which Avraham wanted to fulfill this test. Avraham was so devoted to Hashem that even though he wasn't able to shecht Yitzchak, he still wanted to shecht him. Thus, he brought a ram in his place, and he davened that the ram should be treated by Hashem as well as being in Yitzchak's place.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"3\">\n  <li>The special nature of this ram was exemplified by, possibly, making it to the list of items created at twilight, in the fifth chapter of Avos. ... I was wondering in general, what was so special about this ram and its slaughtering that it needed to be prepared at that point in time?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Maharal (beginning of his piece on this Mishnah) quotes a Rambam who writes that Hashem \"made a condition\" with nature that, at certain points in time to be decided later, it should be altered for a neis to occur. Thus, he interprets the Mishnah as saying that Hashem made a condition with the land that in the days of Korach it should swallow his camp, and that shortly after Krias Yam Suf, when the Bnei Yisrael would need water, Hashem made a condition with the rock that it should give forth water, etc. Likewise, Hashem made a condition with this ram that it should be there in the zechus of Avraham Avinu, who would otherwise have been suffering from not being able to fulfill Hashem's will.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this entire p'shat still begs the obvious question: as the Midrash (same source) attests to, Hashem's will was never that Yitzchak should be shechted, but that he should be placed on the Mizbeiach. Thus, why did Avraham need anything to take the place of Yitzchak? To that I do not have an answer, but I still believe that this p'shat is firmly rooted in a Midrash that clearly answers all of your questions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.13?lang=bi&with=Daat%20Zkenim&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">דעת זקינים on Gen. 22:13</a> provide an explanation for the symbolism of the ram's horns.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אחר נאחז. פסיקתא אמר לו לאברהם ראה בניך העומדים אחריך כשיהו מסובכין\n  ונאחזין בעבירות מה יהיו עושין בקרנות יהיו תוקעין אותן לפני ואני אזכור\n  להם עקידת יצחק ואזכה אותן בדין, ומה עסקו של שופר מכניס בזו ומוציא בזו\n  כך בניך אפילו יש להם כמה קטיגורין אני אכניס אותם בזו ולא אשמע להם.\n  ולכך אמר משה לישראל השופר סניגוריא הוא לכם תקעו שופר בראש השנה כדי\n  שיזכור לכם הקב\"ה עקידת יצחק ותזכו בדין:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>והנה איל אחר, נאחז בסבך בקרניו, “and behold, behind him a ram had been\n  caught with its horns in the thicket;” according to B’reshit rabbah,\n  56,9, the strange word “behind” in this verse is interpreted as G–d\n  having said to Avraham, that He could foresee that his descendants\n  would likewise be caught up in various kinds of sins at different\n  times, and that by using the ram’s horn on designated days of the year\n  and blowing its horn, they would be able to secure for themselves\n  atonement as their founding father Avraham had willingly offered his\n  beloved son as an offering to Him. Ram’s horns which are open ended at\n  both ends are to remind the Jewish people that though they will\n  seemingly enter a dark tunnel when sinning, there is light at the end\n  of the tunnel if they do penitence; blowing the ram’s horns when\n  asking G–d for forgiveness is one of the means of obtaining\n  forgiveness. The ram’s horn may therefore be viewed as an advocate on\n  our behalf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><sup>AFAICT this is an answer only for Q1.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A thought occurred to me this past Rosh Hashana during krias hatorah.

That was what popped into my head on Rosh Hashana.</p>\n\n<p>(This also addresses the old question people ask why in fact did Avraham listen to the angel who was telling him something different than he heard directly from Hashem. And the Answer is because of the sign. I don't know why the sign is better than the message, but at least Rashbam feels it is.)</p>\n\n<p>So getting back to the origional question(s) here, this ram was in fact a huge deal. The ram was an integral part of what made this a test for Avraham, and stopped it from being an actual slaughtering of Yitzchok. </p>\n\n<p>Specifically, to answer #1, this was not simply a symbolic sacrifice. This was THE sacrifice that Avraham was commanded to bring by Hashem origionally. And had it not been this ram, it would in fact have been Yitzchok.</p>\n\n<p>To answer #2, Avraham's actions and prayers were an integral part of this replacement. Slaughtering a ram is no test. Imagioning and acting as if he was continuing with the slaughtering of his son was a continuation of his great  intentions.</p>\n\n<p>As for #3, yes this ram is now recognizable as a great asset to the glorification of Hashem's name. No less than a talking donkey's mouth or the earth's mouth that swallowed the rebelious people in the desert. \nBeing planned for during twilight of the sixth day of creation seems appropriate. </p>\n\n\n",

Heaven grants them both the luck they need.  The girl is persuaded by this young man's action that he is 'righteous', of superior innate moral character, so she consents to meet with him further and eventually introduces him to how much more beautiful Orthodoxy can be.  </p>\n\n<p>Does Orthodoxy allow for \"up-conversion\"?  </p>\n\n<p>Are the mamzerut issues on the boy's side cancelled out by his new birth as an Orthodox regardless of any prior ancestry that he has?  </p>\n\n<p>Since the boy has existing training does he still need to study for a year, or is some of the training abbreviated by what he already knows?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>1 - Conservative and Mamzerut are two separate issues. If the boy is Jewish (his mother is Jewish) then he does not need to convert. He would be considered a Baal Teshuva, one who has repented. He does not require any specific training, although if he is serious about his orthodoxy should learn the Mitzvos in order to lead a proper orthodox life.</p>\n\n<p>2 - If the boy is a Mamzer and Jewish then conversion is not helpful as he would remain a Mamzer. </p>\n\n<p>3 - If the boy is not Jewish there is no Halacha of Mamzer by a non Jew.

Ar., EH 4:20).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This answer only covers situations where the boys Jewishness or lack of it, can be clearly established. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In summary: if we can reasonably ascertain his (or her) maternal Jewish ancestry, and he (or she) wasn't born from a woman who remarried without a proper religious divorce, then there's no conversion necessary. This fellow isn't a \"Conservative Jew\" who has to magically become an \"Orthodox Jew\"; s/he's a \"Jew\" who currently affiliates Conservative and keeps some of the mitzvot as defined by Orthodoxy, and wants to affiliate Orthodox and keep all of the mitzvot as defined by Orthodoxy. Okay. Plenty of people take on more religious observance over time, and it's not uncommon to meet those who were raised Conservative then reaffiliated Orthodox at some point. There are even couples (though this is rarer now than it used to be) where one is Conservative and the other is Orthodox, and they work things out -- though that gets tricky if there are kids in the picture. But I've seen this work for a second marriage of older folks -- one drives to a Conservative synagogue, the other walks to an Orthodox one.</p>\n\n<p>And if s/he says \"I believe it's okay to drive on Shabbat, but if you marry me I won't, for your sake\"? That's okay too, things like that happen. (As long as they're honest with each other.)</p>\n\n<p>In short, good luck with your story! But this is actually a lot less dramatic than you may be thinking.</p>\n\n\n",

According to the many sources on the internet many Orthodox rabbis hold the general presumption that declared and observant but un-papered Jews cannot be given the benefit of the doubt that they aren't mamsers, and so an Orthodox Jew should not ever date one.  Is this assessment correct?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I've never in my life heard of any rabbi, no matter \"how Orthodox\" he is, asking a regular person who did not grow up orthodox to show papers to prove he's Jewish - as long as he claims his mother is Jewish. There is a Tosafoth in Tractate Yevamoth that states that anyone appearing before a rabbinical court and claiming to be Jewish is believed absent any other evidence. If the person in question is asked about his past and indicates something that raises questions about his lineage, then before he is married he might be asked to provide some kind of proof, depending on the rabbi. Like if it's ascertained that his mother was a non-orthodox convert, or he's the child of a second marriage, which could indicate a mamzerut issue. I also heard of someone in a charedi community whose parents immigrated from the Soviet Union who received <em>advice</em> from his Rabbi to obtain documents showing his parents were Jewish, to eliminate any potential concerns before he got married.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>No. It is completely normal for frum-from-birth Jews to date and marry ba'alei teshuvah (aside, perhaps, from particularly insular charedi groups). The safek mamzer issue arises in very specific and rare circumstances, such as a Jew who was given up for adoption under certain conditions. </p>\n\n<p>But in practice, Orthodox rabbis today go out of their way to rule that a person (even with a safek) is fit for anyone to marry. The only real concern is with someone whose mother had been divorced or separated prior to his or her birth, because there might have been a halachic marriage and then no halachic divorce. </p>\n\n<p>More generally, the law is that an undetected mamzer is not a mamzer. For that reason there is a tendency not to inquire deeply into someone's past and investigating the timing and validity of divorces and such.</p>\n\n\n",

The term <em>mean rate of movement</em> refers to the average movement of the sun or the moon in angular degrees over a particular period. To explain: It was easy to calculate the number of conjunctions between one solar eclipse and another.

Has anyone ever seen an opinion that states when one says bracha x that you can have in mind thanking HaShem that you slept with a roof over your head protected from the elements ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The specific brochos in Birchas HaShachar are related to those things that are equally essential to all am yisroel. They are not personal brochos. Therefore one would make the brocha \"sh'asah li kol tzarchi\" on wearing shoes, even if they are not wearing shoes that day. On the other hand, on tisha b'av, when klal Yisrael is not wearing shoes, we dont make that bracha even if we ourselves have a heter to wear say, orthopedic leather shoes. \nThe Gemara states that \"one should even sell the beams of his house to buy shoes\". From this we see that shoes are considered a more intrinsic necessity than a home. There are also those that may choose to sleep outside or are, G-d forbid, homeless. In Egypt our forefathers slept in the field. </p>\n\n<p>It would also seem that since Shoes and clothing are both requirements for various mitzvas, we say a Brocha for them (chalitza, mourning, davening and learning, etc) while the mitzvahs tied to a home are either dependent on having a house (mezuza, chanukas habayis) or can be done without a traditional house (Hachnosos orchim, Bayis vaad l'chochomim). </p>\n\n<p>Their are also other, much deeper, reasons why those specific Brochos were chosen for Birchas hashachar.</p>\n\n<p>The appropriate time to Thank Hashem for having a home, would be as stated earlier, when buying the home (shehechyanu) or when placing a mezuzah. Some also have the custom of making a chanukas habayis on a rented home. We can also have it in mind when we say Birchas HaTorah if we learn in our home and any other bracho on a mitzvah done in the home.</p>\n\n\n",

Par'o hardened his heart since (as Rav Hirsch explains in 14:5) it appeared that Bnai Yisrael \"turned back\" because Hashem could not defeat Baal Tzefon. Par'o was able to talk his people into chasing the Jews because they thought that Ba'al Tzefon could not allow them to defeat the \"rabble\" and return them to slavery. However, when it actually came down to chasing them into the sea, especially after the miracle of the cloud protecting the Bnai Yisrael all night and the sea splitting, the army should have remembered the plagues and the way Par'o begged the Bnai yisrael to leave, and defied Par'o and turned back. Had they done this, Par'o could not have done anything on his own. Therefore, the hearts of the <strong>Egyptians</strong> needed to be strengthened so that they would follow Par'o into the sea.</p>\n\n\n",

The issue there is the proportion in which uncleanliness is allowed for a korban tsibbur with fixed time. The gemara shows two opinions, the first, טומאת מת הותרה בציבור and the second, טומאת מת הודחה בציבור. This is not a radical controversy. We see two versions of the controversy in gemara. The hudcha in the second version is equivalent to the hutra in the first version. Additionally, the machloket seems to be in svara, not based on a controversial learning of verses. For instance, if there are Tahor (Ritually pure) and Tameh cohanim (Ritually impure), should the avoda be made by tahorim only? If tahor cohanim are not present in the bet av today, need we call cohanim from an other bet av?</p>\n\n<p>There are similar dilemmas in pikuach nefesh doche Shabbat (regarding Shabbat the word is always \"doche\" but it is not relevant). Rishonim report questioning about in responsa of Raavad (the question is not the same in Rosh and in Ran) and responsa of Maharam Mirottenburg. The issue there is the choice between schita Shabbat and nevela for an ill man who needs to eat meat.</p>\n\n<p>One of the rishonim, the Rashba, explains that the same controversy, seen regarding Tum'a is relevant for pikuach nefesh doche Shabbat. Last rishonim when they discussed the halacha didn't refer to the machloket regarding Tum'a.</p>\n\n<p>The Rashba himself didn't say clearly that lenient Rishonim (the Maharam Mirottenburg) did pasken as the lenient opinion regarding Tum'a (i.e. they perhaps didn't link the issue of pikuach nefesh with tum'a hutra). But the Bet Yosef an Korban Nesanel understand this is the pshat in Rashba.</p>\n\n<p>So, following this last lecture, Rambam rules hudcha in Shabbat and Tum'a, the Maharam Mirottenburg rules hutra in both.</p>\n\n<p><em>I can add for fun only a personal chiddush. Tosfot in Yoma 6b, says that Rava probably follows the opinion that hutra, because, this is a Stam  mishna (in his opinion). Someone taught me in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/85811/9215\">mi yodeya</a> that the Tosfot in Yoma is from the Maharam Mirottenburg. So, this indicates that Rava, who is basraa (chronologically late r than Rav Nachmann and Rav Sheshet) ruled the halacha following HUTRA. So, we can say that the Maharam Mirottenburg learned the Sugia as the Rashba but follows halachikally hutra and not hudcha.</em></p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch OC 328, 14, rules hutra (Magen Abraham sk 9).</p>\n\n<p>Generally we see several cases of asse doche lo taasse, which can show similar discussion s. EG if I can make a 4 canfot garment in wool or in linen. Can I lechatechilla make it in linen and use the asse to make shaatnez with the peril techelet.</p>\n\n<p>A cohen that can make the funeral of his wife with non cohanim friends (מעשה ביוסף הכהן)...</p>\n\n<p>So the answer is that the degree of leniency of chilul Shabbat is not necessarily linked with the words hutra and hudcha seen in the Sugia of Tum'a.</p>\n\n\n",

After he finished shiur on Wednesday, he looked at his watch and said, “Tomorrow, we’ll say the shiur at 9:00, will you be here?” I said, “Rebbe, we’ll be there, but why so early?”</p>\n\n<p>So the Rav looked at me: “Arnold, don’t you understand?

The depiction of her giving him to drink is repeated three times: in his prayer, when she does it, and when he relates it to her family. Rashi quotes the Medrash that this shows us how valuable the Avos are to Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is the repetition of offerings brought by the Nesiim. Instead of saying that each one brought this, the Torah enumerates by each one what he brought. There too, we find that the Medrash has a different intention by each one, although they happen to come out being the same.</p>\n\n<p>It is a Mitzvah to recount Hashem's miracles. When we do so, we include all the details. As it says,מי ימלל גבורות ה' ישמיע כל תהילתו. Here too, by Yaakov's sheep, the miracle lies in the details. In order to understand the miracle one has to be aware of what he had, what the arrangement was, what the chances were and obviously, what exactly happened.</p>\n\n<p>Surely there is deeper significance to all of this just like there is to Adam and Chava. But it is in the Torah for its plain sake as well, and there is much to learn from.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing we learn from this episode is the extent of Lavan's trickery. This is important to understand what we say when we bring ביכורים, that ארמי אובד אבי. It is also important because it gives us insight into what Yaakov had to put up with and how he dealt with it.

While halacha might allow as acceptable a behavior which happens to fly in the face of a certain society's local moral code, I think that these exceptions do not define Judaism and that Judaism does not encourage behaviors against public policy (dina demalchuta dina jumps to mind).</p>\n\n<p>It seems that your learning has been stilted and skewed, and highly selective. You should probably start from the beginning, with a competent teacher and/or rabbi who can guide you and explain how ideas are built and how halacha develops.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You have an image of Judaism as immoral, parochial and oppressive. But this is the opposite of how Jews throughout the ages have seen Judaism. </p>\n\n<p>I recommend reading a few books by authors to emphasize that Judaism is a system which (when implemented correctly) not only establishes morality, happiness and fulfillment for individuals and families, but also achieves social justice and harmony, with the Jewish people and ultimately within the entire world as well. For example, read Horeb: A Philosophy of Jewish Laws and Observances by Rav Shimshon Rafael Hirsch, Compassion for Humanity in the Jewish Tradition, or any books by former UK Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks. </p>\n\n<p>Many historians believe that the idea of human rights and universal morality -- the idea that everyone has inherent worth and should be an object of kindness and compassion -- originated with Judaism. Before Jewish values spread throughout the world, human sacrifice, and horrible systems of slavery and injustice were commonplace. </p>\n\n<p>Even today, Orthodox Judaism (especially Modern Orthodox Judaism) presents a unique and powerful combination between traditionalism based on a time-tested and authentic sacred tradition on the one hand, and both genders being involved in every profession and endeavor in the world that is compatible with Torah values on the other. Much of the rest of the world has abandoned traditional religious ideas, leading to all sorts of maladies (such as the epidemic of divorce and single parenthood), or are trapped in harmful customs and beliefs (such as anti-Semitism, norms preventing women from getting an education, and a belief in using interpersonal violence to \"solve\" one's problems.)</p>\n\n<p>Judaism's ban on intermarriage is not racist or even ethnically discriminatory. Jews can be of any race or ethnicity, as long as they are born Jewish or convert halachically. Marrying only Jews has nothing to do with hatred or ill will toward anyone else. Marrying Jewish is an absolute requirement for the preservation of Judaism through the generations. Otherwise everything would be lost.</p>\n\n<p>There may be isolated instances in which the halacha does not require Jews to treat Jews and non-Jews completely alike. But many of these can be explained by the fact that Jews have often been surrounded by rapidly hostile peoples. It may not have been wise, for example, to return a lost object to anti-Semites, if they will probably accuse you of stealing it and try to kill you. </p>\n\n<p>However, in general the Talmud strongly emphasizes the importance of emulating Hashem's traits of love and mercy toward all creatures. So even if something may be technically not obligatory (such as returning a lost object to a gentile), we should still do it unless we have a very good reason. (This is also codified in the halacha -- we should return a lost object as long as it will be a kiddush Hashem.) Indeed, we should do everything we can to help other people whether they are Jews or not (and we should also have mercy on animals as well, and help relieve their suffering). See Tomer Devorah by Ramak.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of following what we are told, there is enormous variety of theological and even halachic views, even within Orthodox Judaism. We do need to trust in our Sages, especially since there is no way to tell how to perform most of the commandments of the Torah without the oral tradition (from Sinai to the times of the Talmud, when it was written down.) The Torah emphasizes so strongly how important fulfilling the mitzvot is, but leaves out many key details. </p>\n\n<p>For example, what does a \"sign between your eyes\" mean? Only through the oral Torah do we know this means tefillin. We must have faith in the views of the Sages, particularly when it comes to basic halacha. With regard to hashkafa, however, beyond some basic beliefs, there is much flexibility for personal preferences and insights.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara asks: And how does <strong>Abba Shaul</strong> explain this verse? The Gemara answers: When that was written, <strong>it was written with regard to one who complains about God’s ways</strong>. And this is what the verse is saying: <strong>Why does one complain about God’s ways and claim that he has been treated unjustly? Has he overpowered his sins? God responds: The life I have given him is sufficient for him, and he deserves no more.</strong> (Translation from Sefaria).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the very least, Abba Shaul would answer your question by saying that since you have sinned, there is no justification for you to complain. It's also very possible that the Rabbis agree with Abba Shaul on this point but disagree on how to interpret this particular pasuk (Lamentations 3:39).</p>\n\n<p>[The Rambam (avel 12:10) paskens  like the Rabbis that it's assur to melaveh a meis with 2 women and 1 man even during aninus. The Ohr Zarua (chelek beis siman 422) paskens like Abba Shaul that it is permitted to melaveh a meis with 2 women and 1 man because it's during aninus <strong>because the straightforward interpretation of the pasuk is like Abba Shaul and not like the Rabbis.</strong>]</p>\n\n<p>Another Gemara that might provide us with an answer is Moed Katan 27b [which is referenced by Rashi in Kiddushin 80b as being connected to Abba Shaul according to a certain girsa of the Gemara]. It's written in Moed Katan 27b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Rav Yehuda said further in the name of Rav: Anyone who grieves excessively over his dead and does not allow himself to be consoled will in the end weep for another person. The Gemara relates that a certain woman who lived in the neighborhood of Rav Huna had seven sons. One of them died and she wept for him excessively. Rav Huna sent a message to her: Do not do this. But she took no heed of him. He then sent another message to her: If you listen to me, it is well, but if not, prepare shrouds for another death. But she would not listen and they all died. In the end, when she continued with her excessive mourning, he said to her: Since you are acting in this way, prepare shrouds for yourself, and soon thereafter she died. (Translation from Sefaria).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Meiri explains that the reason why \"Anyone who grieves excessively over his dead and does not allow himself to be consoled will, in the end, weep for another person\" is because (it looks as though) the person is angry and is complaining as it were about how God is acting, so to speak, in the world. Rashi in Kiddushin 80b gives a similar explanation of Moed Katan 27b.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe the Gemoro somewhere says that One should never send harsh words against God, as Levi did so and injured his thumb afterwards.

If you're a driving instructor, it's probably a bad idea.</p>\n<p>That being said, I have only one thing which I had in my arsenal until the glasses thing came up, and that was a Gemara which my Rebbe pointed out to me when I was engaged.</p>\n<p>Yevamos 63a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ל דיינו שמגדלות בנינו ומצילות אותנו מן החטא</p>\n<p>It's enough that [our wives] raise our children and save us from sin</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מן החטא - הרהור עבירה</p>\n<p>From sin - impure thoughts</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My Rebbe explained the Gemara to mean not that a person fulfills his desires with his wife and therefore doesn't have fantasies, but that his relationship and excitement of his wife keeps him from thinking of \"other options\" even when he isn't with her.</p>\n<p>Hopefully a man is attracted to his wife.

As Jews, we believe that yetzer is part of our condition; reference the midrash about the disastrous effects of disabling it temporarily (Yoma 69b).</p>\n\n<p>It's all of our job to recognize yetzer and deal with it. That, of course, includes avoiding some situations, channeling some urges, but, at the end of the day, <em>taking responsibility for our own actions</em>, and realizing that <em>we choose</em>. We are never 'at the mercy' of it.</p>\n\n<p>There's no difference between a co-worker with shapely ankles and a valuable object sitting unattended. There's really no difference between a co-worker with shapely ankles and a co-worker with cleavage. Any of those, and a host of other things, are yetzer-fodder. It is each person's responsibility to do the right thing regardless of the constant parade of temptation in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Most of us, most of the time, have no problem resisting the urge to pick up someone else's pen, let alone coat or camera. The behavior that results by following a sexual urge is likely to be at least as bad in any number of dimensions. So, the question almost turns itself on its head. No one thinks that they need to write a question here asking, 'Why am I having so much trouble avoiding the urge to steal my co-worker's wallet? How can I resist that urge?' What is it that makes people like that OP from Workplace think that this is any more complex than that?</p>\n\n<p>If there's a 'trick' here, it's to recognize that the procreative urge is just another urge, and if you detach yourself and observe yourself (a bit of anti-devekut), you can say to yourself, 'oh, I see, yetzer is very busy with this one. OK, back to work.' It's interesting that this came from 'Workplace', since the workplace is an endless set of opportunities to learn to self-observe and thus get better self-control.</p>\n\n<p>Some additional context: in traditional Jewish thought, and somewhat contrary to some of what I wrote above, sexual temptation is the <em>sine qua non</em> of temptation. (e.g. Kiddushin 81a.) To deal with it, traditional communities build some very extensive fences:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>get married promptly</li>\n<li>don't be alone with a woman you're not married to</li>\n<li>don't even look (mehitza, etc)</li>\n<li>in a few extreme communities, insist that the married women in your community shave their heads even under their wigs</li>\n<li>(as per other answers) remove glasses strategically</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All in all, build a closed community with a set of practices that help hold temptation at bay. This is all of limited utility to people who aren't part of those communities. My remarks above are addressed to people like me who want to apply the underlying categories of Jewish morality to life where you might have a co-worker who typically shows the nape of her neck (to reference another culture's area of emphasis) or a bit of some other bits.</p>\n\n\n",

He\n  wished to refrain from slander, and what happened to him and his\n  household? \"Joseph brought to his father their evil report\" (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8232#v=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereshit 37:2</a>).\n  Jacob wished to refrain from lewdness, and in his household,\n  the events of Reuben and Bilha, and of Judah and Tamar took place. He\n  very much wished to live in peace and to refrain from shedding blood,\n  and the affair of Shekhem and Simeon and Levi occurred - an action for\n  which one can find justification (\"Should he deal with our sister as\n  with a harlot?\" - <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8229#v=31\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereshit 34:31</a>), but which was nevertheless an\n  action whose accursedness Jacob mentioned decades later, just before\n  he died. Whatever Jacob wished to refrain from occurred to him:\n  slander, lewdness in his family, the shedding of blood, and even\n  idolatry - Rachel took her father's idols into Jacob's home, and later\n  Jacob had to demand the removal of the foreign gods \"in their midst.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Where is this from? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm guessing he was not quoting verbatim and he mixed two medrashim as I will show you. He also seems to have misquoted the one you are looking for. </p>\n\n<p>Here is a first quote from him.\n\"More deeply, the Midrash in Breshit Rabbah converts Jacob's vow from a request for supplying his needs to an obligation that he accepted upon himself toward God.  Thus:  If God will be with me and protect me on the path (Hebrew: haderekh) I am going means that He will preserve me from committing slander, as is said (Jeremiah 9:2), \"They bend (Hebrew: vayidrekhu, from the same root) their tongues for lies.\"</p>\n\n<p>and He will give me bread to eat means that He will preserve me from sexual transgression, in accordance with the understanding that \"the bread he eats\" (Genesis 39:6) alludes to sex.</p>\n\n<p>and I return in peace to my father's house means I will refrain from bloodshed.</p>\n\n<p>and He will be my God means He will protect me from committing idolatry.\" </p>\n\n<p>This is a direct quote from Bereishis Rabba 70 4. The medrash ends there and there is no indication in the commentaries that there is a variant reading. So this next quote from him is a proof he was not quoting verbatim. </p>\n\n<p>\"Here the same midrash makes a shocking statement:  “All the things that Jacob wished to refrain from came upon him.\" Etc. as per the quote in your question. </p>\n\n<p>The commentators on that medrash send to Vayikra Rabba chapter 37. There we find a similar idea where Yaakov suffers through these things but the medrash has a different slant. I'll quote (please allow my translation) All who make a nedder and delay fulfilling it will eventually come to idol worship, promiscuity, murder and gossip. From whom do we learn this? All from Yaakov. Being that he made a nedder and delayed it, he came to all these. Idolatry, from Breishis chapter 35, and Yaakov told his family remove the foreign gods. Promiscuity from Dinah, there chapter 34, and Dinah went out. Murder, from there, and it was on the third day when they were in pain. Gossip from there chapter 31 and Yaakov heard the words of Lavan's children. And the rabbis added whoever delays his nedder will bury his wife as we see there chapter 48 and as I came from Padan Aram, Rachel died. </p>\n\n<p>This Medrash is also in the Medrash Tanchuma parshas Vayishlach #8.</p>\n\n\n",

He goes to the person who sold him it and he says \"if you weren't Zi'iri, I wouldn't give you your money back...is there someone who buys something where they don't hit/test it with water first?\" </p>\n\n<p>So contact with water will break magic. But if sorcerer (I mean a real sorcerer) comes into contact with water (let's say standing in the river, or on the beach, with feet touching the water, or they're swimming) can they perform kishuf or will the water prevent them? What about in rain if it touches them?</p>\n\n\n",

(And my impression is that even after he was stuck with Leah, she still wanted to be married to him.)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yaakov Kaminetsky basically makes this point. He suggests that the patriarchs tried to keep the 613 commandments when possible, as an extra measure of piety. However, here he had pledged to marry Rachel, and she was expecting him to keep up with that pledge; he couldn't now say \"oops, sorry lady, I'm extra pious and can't do it now.\"</p>\n\n<p>But yes, all this assumes that being a co-wife is better than being a spinster.

He explains that it was a belittlement of Leah that she was married by deceit, and this fact would diminish his love for his wife. Therefore, he registered a complaint to Lavan.

Since Yaakov gave money through the form of 7 years of work, that already made him halachicaly married to Rochel. Since he was also intimate with Leah, another mode of kedushin, he ended up already married to both sisters. Hence, as soon as Yaakov realized he married Leah, he was already married to Rochel, so the question of if he should, was already moot.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does the \"mezakeh\" need to know that he's using \"zachin,\" for it to work?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a Talmudic concept known as \"זכין לאדם שלא בפניו,\" that one can acquire something on behalf of another, even if that other person does not know that this is happening, so long as it's a זכות, a beneficial thing, that people would want. If it's a חוב (something detrimental), or if the other person protests, then we say \"אין חבין לאדם אלא בפניו,\" we only create debt for a person (or do something detrimental) in front of him -- in other words, only with his knowledge/consent. (We also don't let someone use זכין where it's a מקום שהוא חב לאחרים, where others will lose out from this זכין arrangement.)</p>\n\n<p>If some קנין (acquisition) is done through זכין לאדם שלא בפניו, does the מזכה (the guy doing the acquisition) need to be aware of the fact that he is doing something through זכין לאדם שלא בפניו, or is it possible to do something through זכין even without the מזכה being aware that he is doing this?</p>\n\n<p>One possible instance where this would be the case is found on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=19&daf=11b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gitin 11b</a>, where the principle of זכין is used for freeing a slave -- we say that since freeing a slave is a זכות, if a slave-owner gives a גט שחרור (\"divorce\" document for slaves) to a messenger to deliver to a slave, the slave is free once the document is in the hands of the messenger, because \"זכין לאדם שלא בפניו.\"<br>\nHowever, a friend pointed out that unless we're dealing with an especially astute messenger, he doesn't have in mind to acquire the document on behalf of the slave; he's just thinking to do whatever he's told -- all he knows is that he's bringing a document to somebody.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So can we use the principle of זכין, in a case where the מזכה is not aware that he is using זכין?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm not sure if this answers the question, but while the messenger may not realize that he's being מזכה לחבירו שלא בפניו, he is certainly aware that he's a messenger. Tosfos there (Gitin 11 ד\"ה התופס לבעל חוב, and see also Tosfos to Kesuvos 11a) actually write that זכין works in a manner exactly like שליחות - so one could easily imagine that דעת שליחות is enough to work for זכין לאדם שלא בפניו.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, it isn't obvious that the person acquiring the object for his friend needs to have דעת to do so at all. The Gemara often refers to 'דעת מקנה', the requirement of the one relinquishing his ownership to do so knowingly/willingly, but the Gemara never refers to דעת קונה - the knowing/willingness of the person acquiring the object. One might say that the reason why there's no requirement of דעת קונה is precisely because of the concept of זכין לאדם שלא בפניו, but there still needs to be <em>someone</em> who's knowingly accepting the transaction on behalf of the one receiving the object (just as where there's a דעת אחרת מקנה). However, that doesn't seem to be the case, at least according to the Yad Ramah (Bava Basra 41a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אע\"ג דקיימא לן העודר בנכסי הגר וכסבור של ישראל הן לא קני, דעת אחרת מקנה אותן שאני דקיימא לן זכין לו לאדם שלא בפניו. וכי תימא מי דמי התם ההוא דמזכי ליה על ידיה קא מיכוין למזכי ליה, הכא ליכא מאן דמיכוין למיזכי ליה. חצרו תוכיח דלית ליה דעתא למזכי וזכיא ליה במתנה אפילו שלא בפניו. כדאסיקנא בפרק שנים אוחזין (ב\"מ דף י\"ב ע\"א) האי חצר אתרבאי משום יד ולא גרע משליחות, גבי גט דחוב לה אין חבין לו לאדם שלא בפניו, גבי מתנה דזכות הוא לה זכין לו לאדם שלא בפניו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think that the Ramah has a pretty powerful proof: property lack the ability to intend to make any acquisition (being inanimate objects), but the Gemara in Bava Metzia (12a) writes that fields acquire through a means similar to שליחות. See also the Ketzos 235:3 and Chiddushei Chosam Sofer to Avodah Zara 71</p>\n\n\n",

But this is the evidence of my\n  daughter's virginity!' <strong>And they shall spread the garment before the\n  elders of the city.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The \"garment\" has the evidence? What does this mean?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I am nearly 60 years old at this time and began studying middle eastern customs and languages since the age of 17 with a well known Biblical translator from Assyria. As this is a very sensitive subject, I will try to be as clear and to the point as possible without being vulgar. In many cultures around the world, marriage is much more than just a simple contract. The parents arrange the marriages and agree on the \"bride price\" or what we would call a dowry. Marriages are expected to be an eternal covenant and can bring not just two families together, but sometimes two tribes or countries. Therefore, it would be essential for those involved to have the absolute assurance concerning the purity of the wife. Wedding celebrations sometimes lasted a week or more and usually included the entire communities represented. Therefore, the matter of the woman's virginity was quite important.\nBefore the new wife would be taken to her husband, at least two elderly woman in the village, who probably knew the maid and her family from the day of her birth, would bring a white linen cloth to the damsel and gently break her hymen. This would produce blood on the cloth, which was then presented to her father who would show the entire community, including her new husband, the city elders and anyone else who was interested. This issue was then settled there and then and would never need to be brought up again. However, her Father, in order to protect her honor AND the honor of her family, would keep this garment in a safe place should it ever be needed again as proof of her chastity. These custom's may seem vulgar to those from a western cultural upbringing. However, when trying to understand the near or middle eastern mindset, one must realize how important it is to see cultural issues in a more concrete form rather than the philosophical or metaphysical understanding of the western world view.  I hope this answers a delicate question satisfactorily.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=22#C4221\">Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's translation</a> gives the traditional Jewish interpretation:</p>\n\n<p>It's all about witnesses. He produces witnesses that she cheated on him while they were \"betrothed\" (like engagement, before they move in together, but with a very strong commitment). Her family produces proof that no, the husband's witnesses are perjuring themselves.</p>\n\n<p>This all pertains to Jewish courts having the power of capital punishment, which they haven't had in about 2000 years. So no, it doesn't really apply today.</p>\n\n<p>Today if a man gets married and then says, \"hey I thought you were a virgin!\", the worst that could possibly happen to her -- and I doubt this would even come up -- is a prompt divorce where she doesn't get much of his assets.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While @Shalom's answer is a start, I don't think it fully explains the topic at hand.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: As @Shalom pointed out, there are witnesses involved in the passage, essentially making the \"tokens of virginity\" (a cloth with or without blood on it) unnecessary. However, there is a dispute in the <em>gemarra</em> which sounds like there is an opinion that it's all about the blood. However, as will be explained, that opinion can be understood to agree that there are witnesses.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>What you are asking about is called the <em>parsha</em>/passage of <em>Motzi Shem Ra</em>, someone who spreads a bad name about their wife. As you quoted, it's found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.22.16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 22:13-19</a>. The verses describe someone who after completing marriage to his wife (known as <em>nisuin</em>), claims she cheated on him after they had begun the process of marriage (the stage known as <em>erusin</em> or <em>kiddushin</em>). The custom was that between the two stages of marriage, <em>kiddushin</em> and <em>nisuin</em>, there was a period to get ready for marriage (the custom then was 12 months for a virgin and 30 days for a widow, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Ketubot.5.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). In the interim they were fully married, but didn't live together. If she committed adultery during this time, she would be liable to the death penalty. So essentially this guy is claiming his wife deserves the death penalty.</p>\n<p>Verses 20 and 21 which you quote are if he is proven right. The preceding verses deal with if he is proven wrong; how he is punished for slandering her good name. Now, the details of this passage are discussed in Kesubos 44a - 46a. The relevant parts to your question are found on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.46a.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos 46a</a>. There you'll find a dispute between Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov (REbY) and the Sages. REbY says that the passage is only discussing if when they completed their marriage, known as <em>nisuin</em>, they consummated their marriage. The Sages say even if they hadn't consummated their marriage, the passage applies. The Sages explain the passage is a case where <strong>the husband presents witnesses</strong> who testify that she committed adultery during <em>erusin</em> and is thus liable to the death penalty.</p>\n<p>The <em>gemarra</em> points out that the simple reading of the verses fits better with REbY, and the Sages have to justify their position by re-explaining the verses. I won't explain them all, but some important ones are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Verse 14 :\nוְלֹא־מָצָ֥אתִי לָ֖הּ בְּתוּלִֽים\nI didn't find in her signs of virginity</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The custom used to be to use a cloth during intercourse to prove whether there was blood or not, indicating if she was a virgin or not (see Kesubos <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.6b.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">6b</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.12a.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">12a</a>). The simple reading of the verse then is he is claiming he didn't find blood when they consummated their marriage. He claims that she lost her virginity during <em>erusin</em> and thus she would be liable to the death penalty. The <em>gemarra</em> explains that the Sages read the verse as saying \"I didn't find <strong>witnesses attesting</strong> to her virginity\", meaning witnesses which could contradict his own, who are claiming she committed adultery.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Verse 17:\nוְאֵ֖לֶּה בְּתוּלֵ֣י בִתִּ֑י\nThese are the signs of virginity of my daughter</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The simpler reading of the verse is the father presents the cloth which shows the blood of his daughter, proving she was a virgin when they consummated the marriage. The Sages explain the verse means the father <strong>produces witnesses</strong> who contradict the husband's witnesses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Verse 17:\nוּפָֽרְשׂוּ֙ הַשִּׂמְלָ֔ה לִפְנֵ֖י זִקְנֵ֥י הָעִֽיר\nThey spread the cloth before the elders of the city</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here we see the first mention of the cloth. The simple reading is as above, the father presents the cloth to the elders. The Sages read the verse metaphorically, that the <strong>witnesses clarify the matter</strong> \"like a new cloth\". I assume this means it's as clear as a new cloth is clean, but honestly I don't really get the metaphor.</p>\n<p>Each of these two explanations of the passage have their advantages and disadvantages. The Sages explanation, while not fitting with the simple reading of the verses, consistently uses witnesses, which is the main form of proof in Jewish law. Cloths aren't proof enough to administer the death penalty. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/81888/1739\">Only witnesses can</a>. Therefore, their explanation avoids this issue.</p>\n<p>The question is how to understand REbY with regards to the rest of the Torah. His explanation fits more with the reading of the verses (he even says explicitly, <strong>the verses are to be read literally</strong>), but why would she get the death penalty if he shows a cloth without blood? Why is she  killed if she can't produce a blood-soaked cloth? <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafos_on_Ketubot.46a.23.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos</a> and others are bothered with this question.</p>\n<p>Based on this question, <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%95%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%9B%D7%91_%D7%99%D7%92&action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Torah_Temimah_on_Torah,_Deuteronomy.22.14.5?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Temimah</a>, and I'm sure others offer the following explanation of the passage: Even though it's not mentioned in the passage, everyone agrees <strong>there are witnesses involved</strong>. The Sages explain the whole passage as just an example of a case where he slandered his wife, where he said they consummated the marriage. But the Sages say that even if they never consummated the marriage, and he brought witnesses, the verses can make sense. REbY holds the verses have to be understood literally. Therefore, they really did consummate the marriage. After he did, he didn't find in her signs of virginity. This caused him to investigate the matter and find witnesses attesting to her infidelity. After this there's really no dispute. His bringing the cloth is just to strengthen his claim, but it's really all about the witnesses. When the father brings his own witnesses to discredit the first, the matter is all cleared up like a new cloth<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>To answer your question if this passage is still observed, besides the fact that the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.15a.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">death penalty</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.84b.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fines</a> are no longer enforced, the whole case will rarely ever be relevant. Like I wrote at the beginning, the custom was to have a gap between <em>erusin</em> and <em>nisuin</em>. The custom today is that <em>erusin</em> and <em>nisuin</em> are done immediately one after the other (Rema <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Even_HaEzer.55.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 55:1</a>)<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, it is unlikely that a case would occur that a husband could claim his wife cheated on him during the <em>erusin</em> period. Adultery after <em>nisuin</em> is a different question, unrelated to the passage above.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> The Malbim wants to use this explanation to answer the question everyone has on the Rambam, who <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Virgin_Maiden.3.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rules</a> like REbY that the passage only refers to when they actually consummated the marriage, but <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Virgin_Maiden.3.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> the cloth as a simile and not literally, which would sound like the Sages explanation. According to this there's no contradiction.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> This makes many sugyos in the first chapter of Kesubos no longer relevant. For example, the Gra (ad.\nloc. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7681\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">s.k. 11</a>) explains that the first mishnah and daf 9 are no longer relevant.</p>\n\n\n",

It isn't before Moshiach comes, but before the time of resurrection, everyone alive will die, and those deserving resurrection will be immediately resurrected.  This will be done so that the \"impurity\" implanted in humanity by the sin of the Tree of Knowledge and the interaction with the snake, which is \"built in\" to the human body, can be removed through the decomposition of that body and the rebuilding of it in purity.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Sorry I don't have time to put together all the sources involved, but in general the basic confusion will come from the fact that there are two general views on the nature of Jewish eschatology, and you can read someone saying something about it and not quite know which model they are working with.</p>\n\n<p>One is generally attributed to the Rambam. Call it the philosophical model. The other is generally attributed the Ramban, call it the mystical model.</p>\n\n<p>Following in chronological order:</p>\n\n<p>In both models, after someone passes away, their soul has the potential to go to a World of Souls. In the mystical model this is \"Gan Eden\", and in either one this is one potential meaning of Olam HaBa. The primary focus of it, in both models, is that the soul has an increased understanding and awareness of G-d, which is a great reward (compare to the pleasure in discovering a new idea or truly understanding something you were struggling with, but many times more). Gehennom is a place where souls are purified from negative effects of sin and other aspects of the world in order to be able to have that experience.</p>\n\n<p>In both models, there is a messianic era. How \"natural\" this era will be is somewhat a point of divergence. The main focus of this era is the total unencumbered proper observance of G-d's commandments. This is not generally called \"Olam HaBa\" except when the term is being used as a vague generality.</p>\n\n<p>In both models, there is a Resurrection of the Dead. This is the other potential meaning of Olam HaBa and it is a time of living in this physical world, but in a more miraculous state. It is the understanding of the purpose of this world where the models diverge.</p>\n\n<p>The philosophical model views this world (call it World of Resurrection) as a \"temporary\" stage where those who are there further prepare themselves for the true end - the World of Souls. Under this model, the Rambam suggest Gan Eden is actually a physical place of great comfort in the messianic era, although he seems tentative about it. Does everyone die in order to be resurrected? Not necessarily.</p>\n\n<p>In the mystical model, however, the ultimate end is the World of Resurrection. The World of Souls is preparatory to it. Certainly according to the Zohar, everyone needs to die and be resurrected for the proper experience of that state.</p>\n\n<p>To the degree that there are no Halachic implications to either of the models, there is no determination in Judaism that one is correct and the other isn't. We will get to find out ;-).</p>\n\n<p>Non-Jews have a portion in the Olam HaBa (meaning the final one) by following the Nochaide Laws.</p>\n\n<p>Now in all the above you can find plenty of discussion and divergence in detail, but hopefully this will give a guide to help orient someone in the discussion.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>here is a quote on the nature of olam haba from the classic work chovos halevavos (gate 4 ch.4)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another reason (olam haba is not mentioned in the torah) is that the purpose of reward in Olam Haba is\n  essentially clinging to G-d, and drawing near to His supernal light,\n  as written \"your righteousness will go before you, the glory of G-d\n  will gather you in\" (Yeshaya 58:8), and \"the wise will shine like the\n  radiance of the firmament\" (Daniel 12:3), and also, \"To bring back his\n  soul from the pit (i.e. Gehinom see below Tov Halevanon), to be\n  enlightened with the light of the living\" (Iyov 33:30). And no one can\n  reach there except he who the Creator finds favor in, and the favor of\n  the Creator is the root of the reward, as written \"his anger is but a\n  moment, in His favor is life\" (Tehilim 30:6). And there are hints in\n  parsha bechukosai that pleasing the Al-mighty [is the greatest\n  reward], this is what is written \"My soul will not abhor you\" (Vayikra\n  26:11), and \"I will turn to you and be unto you a G-d and you will be\n  unto Me a people\" (ibid, 26:9).</p>\n  \n  <p>(Tov Halevanon commentary on the above: \"the purpose of reward\" - The intent of this answer is that the spiritual reward is only clinging with G-d,\n  and we will attain this when we minimize tending towards the bodily\n  desires and purify our souls by fulfilling His commandments,\n  yisborach. And then, our souls will be fitting and capable of clinging\n  to the spirituality of G-d. And then G-d, in His kindness, will\n  \"conceal us in the shadow of His hand\" (Yeshaya 49:2), even though we\n  are not deserving of this reward from [the merit] of our deeds, but\n  rather by \"His kindness which prevailed over us\" (Tehilim 117:2). But\n  when a man turns towards the physical desires in rebelling against the\n  Divine wisdom, then his soul is stuck in the darkness of the physical,\n  and it is impossible in any way to draw close to Him, yisborach,\n  except by its cleansing itself from its tuma (spiritual impurity), in\n  purifying itself from its physicality in Gehinom, as known to the\n  sages. And according to this, reward and punishment in the Olam Haba\n  is not according to judgment and justice, like the reward and\n  punishment in this world. Rather, they follow (1) a kind of nature\n  (i.e. purity from the bad effects of physicality) and (2) also a\n  desire of G-d for those who fulfill His will, both of these two things\n  simultaneously. This is the difference between this answer and the\n  previous one \"a man does not become worthy of the reward of Olam Haba\n  due to his good deeds alone... but rather it is a kindness...\".\n  Understand this.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>having said this, to find favor with Gd, each person needs to do what God wants of him. As a gentile, God wants first and foremost that you keep the 7 commandments of bnei noach</p>\n\n\n",

The RamBam codifies this in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=83&perek=1&halocha=6&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Melachim 1:6</a>, but his list does not match the Talmud's.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any insight as to why there is a difference between the two lists, or why the RamBam seems to omit several of the jobs (e.g. cleaner, peddler, etc.)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>(If you're in a rush, skip to the last paragraph.)</p>\n\n<p>Let us first compare the texts to see what the discrepancies actually are. The Talmudic passage reads as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=82&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 82a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תנו רבנן כל שעסקיו עם הנשים סורו רע כגון הצורפים והסריקים והנקורות\n  והרוכלין והגרדיים והספרים והכובסים והגרע והבלן והבורסקי אין מעמידים\n  מהם לא מלך ולא כהן גדול מאי טעמא לא משום דפסילי אלא משום דזיל\n  אומנותיהו</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Rabbis taught: He whose business is with women has a bad\n  character. E.g., goldsmiths, carders, [handmill] cleaners, pedlars,\n  wool-dressers, barbers, launderers, bloodletters, bath attendants and\n  tanners. Of these neither a king nor a High Priest may be appointed.\n  What is the reason? Not because they are unfit, but because their\n  profession is mean. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nashim/Kiddushin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino traslation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam's codification of this reads as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=14904\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Melachim 1:6</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואין מעמידין מלך ולא כהן גדול לא קצב ולא ספר ולא בלן ולא בורסי לא מפני\n  שהן פסולין אלא הואיל ואומנותן נקלה העם מזלזלין בהן לעולם </p>\n  \n  <p>Neither a butcher, barber, bath-attendant, nor a tanner should be\n  appointed king or High-Priest. This is not because of an inherent\n  fault, but because their professions are less prestigious, and the\n  people will always treat them lightly. (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188345/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see here that the Talmud gives a list of 10 professions, while Rambam gives a list of four. Three out of the four that Rambam lists are listed by the Talmud; one is not.</p>\n\n<p>So essentially what we have here is that Rambam removed seven professions from the list and added one profession to the list. Why did he do this?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_ben_Zemah_Duran\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Simeon Ben Tzemach Duran</a> addresses this in a responsum:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1381&pgnum=28\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tashbetz 1:16</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וגם בענין מינוי המלכו' לא הזכירו הרמב\"ם ז\"ל שהוא כ' בפ' א' מה' מלכים\n  אין מעמידין לא מלך ולא כ\"ג לא גרע ולא ספר ולא בלן ולא בורסקי הזכיר אלו\n  שהם מנוולים בכ\"מ שהאומנות בעצמה היא מנוולת ומלוכלכת והשמיט האחרים ראה\n  הרב ז\"ל במקומות אלו שהם אומניות משובחות וכתב לפי מקומו אע\"פ שבתלמוד\n  מזכירין אותם לגנאי וזה סיוע לדברי שהכל לפי המקומות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he argues that certain professions are inherently lowly, while others depend on the time and place. Rambam therefore left out all the professions that he saw were not lowly in his time. </p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that R. Duran's citation of Rambam has a different text from ours. He has גרע instead of קצב, in which case all of Rambam's examples are in fact from the Talmud. However, it appears that R. Duran's text is actually the correct one, as the Kafih edition notes that all manuscripts in his possession support גרע, and the Frankel edition notes that the majority of manuscripts have it as גרע (or some slight variation).  </p>\n\n<p>A different explanation is suggested by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Joseph Karo</a>. He noticed a pattern in the professions that Rambam omitted. Specifically, Rambam omitted the first five professions. R. Karo thus explains that Rambam punctuated the Talmudic passage differently. Instead of understanding the entire passage beginning from תנו רבנן as one long statement, he breaks it up into two statements. The first statement is about professions that deal with women. The Talmud lists five professions. Then, starting from והספרים is a new statement referring to the lowly jobs that invalidate one as a king or high priest. Thus, according to R. Karo, the reason why Rambam left out some of the professions is that according to his understanding of the Talmud, those professions were never mentioned in the context of invalidating a king/high priest. Rambam left them out because those professions <strong>do not</strong> in fact invalidate someone.</p>\n\n<p>R. Karo still has to deal with the fact that even after the first five professions, Rambam still omitted כובסים and גרע and added קצב. R. Karo suggests that Rambam had קצב <em>instead of</em> כובסים (presumably meaning that he had a different Talmudic text) and that he didn't have גרע (presumably another Talmudic textual variant). However, this as not as big of an issue as it seems, because as noted above, the text of Mishneh Torah actually does say גרע and does not say קצב – R. Karo was working from a faulty text – so the only thing that really needs explanation is the omission of כובסים.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=90378&rid=14904\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kessef Mishneh Hilchot Melachim 1:6</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בסוף קידושין ת\"ר כל שעסקו עם הנשים סורו רע הצורפין והסריקין והנקורות\n  והרוכלים והגרדין והספרים והכובסים והגרע והבלן והבורסקי אין מעמידין מהם\n  לא מלך ולא כ\"ג מ\"ט לא משום דפסילי אלא משום דזיל אומנותייהו וסובר רבינו\n  דהא דכל שעסקו עם הנשים לא שייך אלא עד הגרדיים ומספרים ואילך מיירי\n  לענין שאין מעמידין מלך ולא כ\"ג ובמקום כובסין גריס קצבים ולא גריס גרע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahum_Rabinovitch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Nachum Rabinovitch</a> in his edition of Mishneh Torah (Yad Peshutah) offers an explanation similar to R. Karo's but taken to the next level. He notes that our printed versions of the Talmud apparently have the wrong text. He points out that the Cambridge manuscript T-S AS 75.58 actually has the beraita cited by the Talmud as two separate beraitot.<sup>1</sup> The first beraita is about professions that deal with women, and six professions are named. The second beraita is about lowly professions that invalidate one as a king or high priest, and four professions are named. These four professions are precisely the four professions mentioned by Rambam (in the correct text of Mishneh Torah mentioned above).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ברם ראה גירסת כ\"י קיימברידג' שם ישנן שתי ברייתות נפרדות' הברייתא\n  הראשונה בעניין מי שסורו רע והברייתא השנייה בעניין העמדת מלך וכהן גדול\n  וזו רשימה המתאימה בדיוק לסדר בעלי המלאכה שנקט רבינו תנו רבנן כל שעסקו\n  עם הנשים סורו רע כגון הצרופים והסי<..>קים והנקורות והגירדיים והספרים\n  והכובסים תנא הגרע והספר והבלן והבורסי אין מעמידים מהן לא מלך ולא כהן\n  גדול לאו משום דפסילי אילא משום דזילא אומנותיהו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(\"T-S AS 75.58\" should appear after \"'קיימברידג\", but I can't put it in the middle of the Hebrew quote without ruining the format.)</p>\n\n<p>R. Rabinovich's interpretation can be bolstered by a parallel passage elsewhere in Rabbinic Literature. In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanna_Devei_Eliyahu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanna Devei Eliyahu</a> we find a similar statement about disqualifying professions, in which the first half about professions dealing with women is entirely absent:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21972&st=&pgnum=137\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Eliyahu Zuta Chapter 16</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגרע והבלן והבורסקי אין מעמידין מהן לא מלך ולא נשיא ולא כהן גדול ואין\n  מוסרין להם דבר שיש בו שררה לרבים ואין מעמידין מהן אפוטרופסין ליתומין\n  רבי יוסי אומר פסולין לעדות הם ורשב\"ג אומר אין נושאין מהן נשים לכהונה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Notably, the old text version (printed on the side in the above link) has \"והבורסי\" which is even closer to Rambam's text.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thus, the simplest answer to your question of why Rambam deviated from the Talmudic list, is that once you have the correct texts of both the Mishneh Torah and the Talmud there are actually no differences.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. R. Rabinovitch also notes that even in our corrupt Talmudic text the vestiges of the two beraita split can be detected, for we see that the professions in the first half are plural, while those in the second half are singular:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן בנוסח הדפוסים השתמר זכר שיש כאן שתי ברייתות שפתחה הברייתא בלשון\n  רבים צורפים סריקים וסיימה בלשון יחיד והגרע והבלן אלא ודאי שהחיבור בין\n  שתי הברייתות הוא שיבוש</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></sup></p>\n\n\n",

Although I don't have the complete answer to your question, I would like to present the archaeological evidence supporting the phrase of \"בני עמון\" frequently used in the Torah.</p>\n<p>An ancient bullae was found recently (script is Ammonite) where the name of king Ba'alis of Ammon was found on it. It was very hard to read because of the deterioration of the seal, but scholars were able to reconstruct the lines, thus it reads (more precisely, what was inscribed originally): <strong>[Belonging to] Ba'alis King of B[nei Ammo]n</strong>. This is an amazing discovery indeed, and it supports the biblical account, since it is the same exact term used in the Torah to describe the nation of Ammon: <strong>בני עמון</strong>. So we see that the authors of Tanach (they were all too familiar with the culture of their neighbors) merely used the name the Ammonites applied to themselves (for whatever reason).</p>\n<p>Below is an illustration of the bullae with the name Ba'alis king of B'nei Ammon inscribed upon it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hefPl.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hefPl.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of the bullae\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Much more needs to be reconstructed in the damaged third line.

Indeed, in the Biblical passage that mentions\nBa'alis (Jeremiah 40:14), he is referred to as the \"King [of the] Bnei\nAmmon,\" the same term that we have reconstructed here based on the\nfirst and last letters.

As such, (and again as you yourself suggest) \"<em>Ammon</em>\" alone is shorthand for \"<em>Ben-Ammon</em>\" much like \"<em>Yemini</em>\" is short hand for \"<em>Benyamini</em>\" (see also <em>Emek Hamelech</em> and <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2013_06_01_archive.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Waxman</a>; as well as Shadal who also <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shadal_on_Genesis.19.38?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">notes the trend</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Sefer Shaarei Aharon in Vayeira 19:37 offers an explanation to the discrepancy between referring to Moav the same term as the previous Passuk whereas Bnei Amon is different then Ben Ami. </p>\n\n<p>He says 'the way that a person wants to go, he is taken. Therefore, the younger daughter who tried to conceal the matter (the name Amon is less obvious to have been impregnated by her father, as opposed to Moav) therefore 'hashgacha' concealed the matter completely, for there is a difference between Ben Ami and Bnei Amon'.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that when Ya'akov sent messengers with a huge gift for Esav, the verse explains part of Ya'akovs thinking where he uses the term \"kaparah\" - a bit of an unusual term, here. Ramba\"n explains that he sent servants before him and gave \"kofer nafsho\" (loose translation - redemption of his life) by giving this gift, in the similar manner that servants offer <em>kapparah</em> to the king so that they can obtain permission to see the king.</p>\n\n<p>In summary (my analysis), which somewhat concurs with Ramba\"n - it is clear that Ya'akov was terrified of Esav - to the point where he thought Esav would kill him. He also understood that Esav had a bit of an ego, and was probably still sore that Ya'kov had cheated him out of the blessing. So to appease Esav's anger, part of Ya'akov's strategy was to consider himself a \"servant\" to Esav and therefore, by relation, Esav was the \"master\" or the \"Lord\". It's a sense of respect, and if nothing else, makes Esav realize that even Ya'akov (at least temporarily) considers Esav the superior \"ruler\".</p>\n\n\n",

Is using mashed fruits/vegetables different than <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/26927/what-bracha-do-we-say-on-bread-baked-with-evaporated-mei-peiros/36668#36668\">making bread out of fruit juices</a>?</p>\n\n<p><sup>(Note: the link above is to an answer because the question was not about fruit juices in general, but the answer is)</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The issue here is that you are mixing in a solid instead of a liquid.  There are two reasons why this doesn't make a difference.  The first is that one of the examples cited of things mixed in is spices, which are not a liquid and are not being substituted as a binding agent of the dough, and even so they have the same status as fruit juices (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x983\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 168:7</a>).  Secondly, this case seems analogous to the halacha of bread made from flour of the 5 grains mixed with flour of legumes or beans, discussed in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1032\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 208:9</a>.  In that halacha, the Mechaber states that as long as it still has the taste of the grain it still gets Hamotzi.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the same as fruit fillings (discussed in 168:7) for several reasons, but the simplest reason is that fruit fillings alter the way in which the bread is eaten, making it into a snack-ish food (see Magen Avraham 168:35), whereas your example of non-taste-altering additions would not.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Nesivos in his introduction to his Maaseh Nisim Hagada, in the section about hamotzi, says that all of the reasons for pas haba b'kisanin are just examples of things that would turn the bread into something eaten as a snack, and any bread item would depend on that factor alone.  If your bread feels, looks, and tastes like bread, then it would be in the Nesivos' category of non-pas haba b'kisanin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>From what you are describing about the \"mashed fruit\" process, this sounds like the way date bread is made. According to <a href=\"http://ou.org.s3.amazonaws.com/publications/brachot/default.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this list</a>, The bracha is <em>mezonot</em>. Banana and zucchini breads are made in a similar fashion. In both cases, dough is the main ingredient and banana or zucchini \"mash\" is mixed into the dough. Often things that are called \"bread\" in English or in recipes are actually cakes.</p>\n\n<p>If this is <strong>not</strong> the method used to make the bread you are describing, e.g. a challah that has a few chocolate chips studded into it, then the bracha is hamotzi.</p>\n\n<p>See the \"disclaimer\" at the top of the linked article that seems to imply (according to my understanding) that there is no such thing as \"mezonot bread\" if eating it as part of a meal.</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Moshe Feinstein (Igrot Moshe YD 1:173) writes that it is forbidden to make recordings of verses being sung for the purpose of listening to them for pleasure. Rav Ovadia Yosef (Yabia Omer OC 3:15) writes that the prohibition does not apply if the songs are sung with fear of heaven and \"level-headedness\" (כובד ראש) at a celebration of a Mitzva. Rav Yaakov Ariel <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/ask/?id=34292\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes</a> that it is only permitted to sing verses if one focuses on their content and on one's connection with God. Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv <a href=\"http://www.havabooks.co.il/sms.asp?cat=119\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes</a> that one can listen to such songs only with \"holy trepidation\" (חרדת קודש).</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna Berura (560 sk 14) quotes early authorities that this applies to any verse in Tanakh, not just Shir HaShirim. Rav Moshe Feinstein (Igrot Moshe YD 2:142) speculates that perhaps some are lenient in this matter by viewing the prohibition as referring specifically to Shir HaShirim (which is prone to being misinterpreted as \"mere song\") though he doesn't know of any early authority to support this and leaves the matter unresolved (צ\"ע).</p>\n\n<p>In short, Tanakh is not just a cute book of playful lyrics for your own relaxation and enjoyment.

(suggested but not accepted by Igrot Moshe YD 2:142; 1963) The article says this is also implied in Avot D'Rabi Natan (perek 37), but i personally didn't see it.</p>\n\n<p>The second justification is that it is only <em>assur</em> if it's done as a mockery, even if it's not being done as a mitzvah (<em>m'sameach chatan v'kallah</em>). Therefore, most cases should be permissible. Rav Yaakov Emden seems to think along these lines in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37969&st=&pgnum=496\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary on the passage in Sanhedrin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The third justification (brought unsourced) is that in today's world, when non-Jewish music is so readily available and popular, to <em>davka</em> listen to Jewish music helps enhance your connection to Hashem.

By Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff</a></p>\n<p>Rabbi Kaganoff points out that Rav Yosi ben Chanina in the Gemor makes the statement that each of the Avos instituted one daily prayer with Yaakov in Vayeitzei being shown to have instituted Ma'ariv. The question that arises is how Ma'ariv can be a reshus when Yaakov Avinu caused it to become requires (like Avraham and Yitzchak with Shacharis and Mincha). Yaakov was \"forced\" into Ma'ariv when the sun set unexpectedly in Parsha Vayeitzei), so it is not the same level of requirement.</p>\n<p>However, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi connects the three to the daily services with Shacharis and Mincha being the daily tamid, while Maariv is the burning of the limbs that are \"remaining\" (Brachos 26b)</p>\n<p>As a result, while davening Maariv is required, it is a lesser degree of requirement, since there were not always sufficient karbanos to require burning at night.</p>\n<p>He also brings up the incident of Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Yhoshua in which Rabban Gamliel which led to Rabban Gamliel's (temporary) removal and the appointment of Rabbi Eliezer ben Azaria.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is maariv optional?  Ultimately, the halachic conclusion is that\nmaariv is a reshus. Is maariv really optional? Can one decide, every\nnight, if he wants to skip maariv?</p>\n<p>The rishonim already note a\nruling that appears to contravene the statement that maariv is\noptional. Someone who missed maariv must recite a makeup prayer,\ncalled a tefillas tashlumim, after the next morning's shacharis.\nHowever, this ruling appears to contradict the statement that tefillas\narvis reshus. If maariv is optional, why must someone make up the\nmissed prayer?</p>\n<p>In response to this question, Tosafos explains that\nwhen the Gemara states that maariv is reshus, it does not mean that it\nis optional, but that it is less obligatory than other requirements.\nFor example, should one need to choose between fulfilling two\ndifferent mitzvos in a situation where one cannot fulfill both of\nthem, maariv is pushed aside (Tosafos, Brachos 26a s.v. Ta'ah). In all\nother circumstances, one is obligated to recite maariv.   The Rif\nanswers the question in a different way. He explains that, indeed,\nmaariv is technically not obligatory. However, someone who decided to\nrecite maariv this evening makes it obligatory on himself and must\npray correctly, even if he needs to pray a makeup.</p>\n<p>According to the interpretation that the forefathers instituted the\ndaily prayers, although Yaakov was the first to daven maariv, he had\nnot intended to daven so late, but Hashem caused the sun to set\nsuddenly, giving Yaakov no choice but to daven after nightfall. Since\nthis davening was performed not as Yaakov's first choice, but because\nhe had no other option, the prayer instituted this way is reshus (Pnei\nYehoshua, Brachos 26b s.v. Mihu).</p>\n<p>According to the approach that our prayers correspond to the daily\nofferings, shacharis and mincha each represent the daily korban tamid\nthat was offered in the Beis Hamikdash. Maariv represents the\nremaining parts of the daily tamid that were burnt the following night\non the mizbei'ach. Since this step in the processing of the korban is\nnon-essential, the prayer was also not required (Rashi, Shabbos 9b,\ns.v. Lemaan).</p>\n<p>Why does maariv not include a chazzan's\nrepetition of shmoneh esrei, whereas there is one for both shacharis\nand mincha? The answer is that although today maariv is obligatory, it\nis not the same level of requirement as are shacharis and mincha.\nSince everyone is required to daven shacharis and mincha, Chazal were\nconcerned that unlettered individuals would be unable to fulfill the\nmitzvah. Chazal therefore instituted the repetition of the tefillah,\nso that those unable to daven otherwise would be able to fulfill their\nrequirement by listening to the chazzan's prayer. However, since\nmaariv is reshus, Chazal were less concerned that the unlettered would\nbe unable to fulfill this responsibility, and therefore, they did not\ninstitute a repetition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is why the Torah teaches us positive and negative commandments.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Longer answer:</p>\n\n<p>Your questions are ones that are common, especially by those influenced by the Christian philosophy that God is all good and that evil belongs in a separate realm (i.e. their Devil's realm).  The Orthodox Jewish response to that is, of course, with a question:  \"Do you believe in an all-powerful God, or do you believe in separate gods for good and evil?\"  It should not have to be stated that Judaism completely accepts the former and rejects the evil.  The view of a \"limited God\" unable to eliminate evil from the world, was also suggested, unfortunately, by Conservative rabbi Harold Kushner in his book \"Why Bad Things Happen to Good People.\"  It is not a legitimate Orthodox perspective according to many critics, notably Rabbi Benjamin Blech, author of \"If God is Good, Why is the World So Bad\" (Simcha Press 2003).</p>\n\n<p>Starting off with basics.  Scripture makes it clear that God created both good and evil. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15976#v=7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Isaiah 45:7</a> states:  \"Who forms light and creates darkness[?] Who makes peace and creates evil[?]; I am the Lord, Who makes all these. Man is also pre-loaded with the inclination to do good, and also the good to do evil.  <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9994#v=15\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deut. 30:15-20</a> (discussed below).  Anyone who has raised a 2- or 3-year-old knows that the inclination to do evil rules over the inclination to do good, although even it also shows its face in the toddler, until the child is near the age of bar or bat mitzvah.  The child psychologist will tell you that the toddler's constant demands, whining and masterly use of the word \"no\" serves an important function as the young child learns family and social boundaries that will guide his life.  Similarly, the social misfortunes of the beta \"tweenage\" girl are an essential element in creating a spirit of resilliancy.</p>\n\n<p>For God, the co-existence of good and bad is a practical necessity and an example of a thing on which we lack His perspective.  From God's perspective, good and evil are relative terms; \"what is good for the butcher is inevitably bad for the cow,\" one might say.  As Rabbi Blech points out, God's purpose for having both good and evil exist equally in this world is to provide us with choice so that we might exercise free will.  Deut. 30:15-20 states: \"Behold, I have set before you today life and good, and death and evil...I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. You shall choose life....\" Rabbi Blech, therefore, argues that from God's perspective, the greatest good is that we choose what the Torah defines as \"good\" as opposed to those options the Torah defines as \"evil.\"  Sometimes, he says, God has to allow evil to rule the day so that man might choose to rebel against it.</p>\n\n<p>Some people try to distinguish Isaiah 45:7 by translating the word רע as \"calamaties,\" thereby avoiding the risk of identifying God as the creator of evil.  But they don't understand.  But since the word is used broadly to define both the inclination to do evil that dwells in man, as well as natural disasters, we cannot assume it to be one and not the other in the case of either Isaiah or Deuteronomy.  Natural disasters and the like do have a tendency to bring out the best in some people, but so do wars, strangely enough.  The stories of the Holocaust are filled with examples of amazing acts of charity, preservation of life, and honoring the Name of God, while at the same time that there exists suffering, murder, hoarding and thievery.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to knowing good and evil:  One tractates in the Talmud is the book of Avoda Zara -- a tome that debates and discusses various idolatrous religions -- which totals 5 chapters.  There, <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/rst/nezikin/35a%20-%20Avodoh%20Zoroh%20-%202a-35b.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avoda Zara 14b</a>, Rav Chisda states that in Abraham's day, he compiled his own book of Avoda Zarah that listed all of the customs and rituals of idolaters in his day and his book totaled more than 400 chapters.  Why do we have such books?  We learn it so that we can recognize idolatry -- an evil in God's eyes.  We see from that God wants us to learn what is evil in the world, even if we might be contaminated by the learning to a degree.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>God didn't create evil, he gave man a free will to choose. All Adam had to do was submit his will to Hashem Elohim so that he can be guided but he asserted his will in disobedience. You are free to make a choice but whomsoever you obey becomes your master. Adam disobeyed God and obeyed the devil. Disobedience is the root of evil and produces death. Adam now understood good but his nature has become corrupted by evil. His offspring inherited this nature, knowing what good to do but having an irresistible inclination toward evil because they are subservient to the one who now rules over them. The knowledge of the fact that they have become inherently evil by nature, made Adam look for what will cover him (hide his nature). God did not create evil (disobedience) neither did he intend for man to be a robot. He gave man a free will but Adam made a choice to become a slave. If you assert your will against the sovereign will of God then it means you must be a god, able to sustain yourself and control your circumstances.</p>\n\n\n",

In modern times many (most?) people live in areas where structures higher than 20 amos are extremely common, so people are much more likely now than in the past to notice objects that are above that height. Given that, has there been a halachic discussion among the authorities of incorporating this new reality into halacha, perhaps by ruling items placed higher than 20 amos as valid?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I’m not familiar with such a discussion, but I see no reason why it would be applicable. As far as I’m aware, the three discussions you cite - Menorah, Sukkah, and Koreh - are the only ones where 20 Amos applies, so let’s go through them one by one. I’ll address them out of order, and you’ll see why shortly.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Sukkah</h1>\n<p>The Gemara on Sukkah 2a poses a three-way dispute in understanding why a Sukkah may not be taller than 20 Amos:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rabbah learns the restriction from למען תדעו דורותיכם כי בסוכות הושבתי את בני ישראל, “so that your generations will know that in huts did I cause Bnei Yisrael to dwell.” If a structure is taller than 20 Amos, its roof - the critical part of the Sukkah, its schach - will go unnoticed. <em>However,</em> and this is the key part, the Gemara on 2b says that according to this understanding, if the walls reach the schach, it could be even taller than 20 Amos, as the walls will draw one’s eyes to the roof. The argument is only when the walls do not reach the schach.</li>\n<li>R’ Zeira learns the restriction from וסוכה תהיה לצל יומם, “A Sukkah will be for shade of day.” If a Sukkah is taller than 20 Amos, one will be sitting in the shade of the walls, not that of the schach.</li>\n<li>Rava learns the restriction from בסוכות תשבו שבעת ימים, “in huts will you dwell for seven days,” implying that the structure be one that is typically built in a temporary fashion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How would your question apply to Sukkah? According to R’ Zeira and Rava, it has nothing to do with seeing the Schach, and therefore your question doesn’t apply.</p>\n<p>According to Rabbah, the Halacha actually follows your suggestion. <strong>Our eyes are only drawn upwards to the top of buildings because of the massive walls; if they were forty-foot poles with some schach at the top, chances are that you’d miss it.</strong> Surely you agree to this: do you notice random passing birds overhead if you’re not already looking in that direction? You only notice the tops of skyscrapers because you follow their towering walls upwards. If you don’t follow anything else in this post, make sure you understand this, as the rest of the post essentially discusses how this applies to the other areas.</p>\n<p>As an aside, the Halacha follows Rava, who disagrees with Rabbah that it can be taller if the walls reach the ceiling, and who disagrees with R’ Zeira that it can be taller if the Sukkah is wider (SA OC 633:1). So being able to see the top is irrelevant anyway, according to practical Halacha.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Koreh</h1>\n<p>Once again, we have a dispute as to the reasoning behind Koreh (Eruvin 2a-3a):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rav learns it from the doorway of the Heichel. Just as that was 20 Amos tall, so, too, all Halachic doorways, which includes that of a Mavoi.</li>\n<li>Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak learns that the Koreh is to recognize the alley as distinct from the street, and, as you say, one only notices a marker at 20 Amos or below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to Rav, your question doesn’t start, as he learns from a passuk. But according to Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak, you would, seemingly, have a valid point. We can’t even get out of this by saying we pasken like Rav, as the Shulchan Aruch (OC 363:26) explicitly rules that it’s because people need to see it (and that it would be permitted above 20 Amos if there’s some sort of picture or the like to draw your attention upward).</p>\n<p>Wait. Some sort of picture or the like to draw your attention upward permits it above 20 Amos? We see that, once again, if something draws your eye upwards, it’s permitted even above 20 Amos.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Menorah</h1>\n<p>So far, so good. But things are going to get worse very quickly. I don’t fully have an answer for Menorah, but let’s dive into the discussion and see what we find.</p>\n<p>The relevant Gemara is Shabbos 21b-22a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב כהנא דרש רב נתן בר מניומי משמיה דרבי תנחום נר של חנוכה שהניחה למעלה מעשרים אמה פסולה כסוכה וכמבוי:</p>\n<p>Rav Kahana said: Rav Nassan bar Manyomi expounded in the name of Rebbi Tanchum: A Menorah placed above 20 Amos is pasul, like Sukkah and like Mavoi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi explicitly explains this line in accordance with your logic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פסולה - דלא שלטא בה עינא למעלה מכ' אמה וליכא פרסומי ניסא:</p>\n<p>”Is Passul” - for the eye does not reach it above 20 Amos, and there is no publicizing of the miracle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tur (OC 671) brings this same logic. He quotes an opinion that might have spared Menorah from your question but shoots it down:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל אם הניחה למעלה מכ' אמה אפי' בדיעבד לא יצא דלא שלטא ביה עינא וליכא פירסומי ניסא וכתב ה\"ר יואל הלוי דוקא כשמניחה בחוץ אכל כשמניחה בבית אפי' למעלה מעשרים אמה כשירה כדאמרינן גבי סוכה  אם דפנות מגיעות לסכך אפי' למעלה מכ' אמה כשירה דשלטא ביה עינא ונ\"ל שאין הנידון דומה לראייה דהתם בעינן שתשלוט עינו בגג וכיון שמחיצות מגיעות לגג על ידם ישלוט עינו בגג אבל הכא שצריך שישלוט עינו בנרות כיון שהוא למעלה מכ' דלא שלטא ביה עינא מאי נפקא מינה בגג שהוא עדיין למעלה ממנו בשבילו לא שלטא ביה עינא</p>\n<p>But if he placed it above 20 Amos, even after the fact he doesn’t fulfill the mitzvah, as the eyes won’t see it and there’s no publicizing of the miracle. Harav Yoel HaLevi wrote that this is specifically when placed outside, but when it’s placed in the house, even above 20 Amos is kasher, like we say by Sukkah that if the walls reach the Schach even above 20 Amos is kasher. But it seems to me that the conclusion is not similar to the proof, as there we need the eyes reaching the roof, and since the walls reach the roof, one’s eyes will reach the roof through them. But here we need the eyes to reach the <em>candles</em>, and since they’re above 20 Amos and the eyes won’t see them, why does it make a difference about the roof which is still taller than them? On its account one’s eyes won’t see the candles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So now what? Seemingly the Tur just shot down our only defense.</p>\n<p>Let’s back up a second and digest his argument. Walls draw one’s eyes up to the ceiling. Why can’t the same argument apply by a Menorah? Because walls draw one’s eyes up to the <em>ceiling</em>, not to the Menorah that’s beneath it...and probably right in your line of sight of the ceiling? What kind of an argument is that?</p>\n<p><em>Seemingly</em> (and this is my own logic here), the dispute is regarding the nature of the leniency of שלטא בה עינא. According to Rav Yoel, the issue at hand is whether one can see it, and, as such, since one’s eyes will be drawn upwards in the general direction of the candles, it’s perfectly fine.</p>\n<p>But according to the Tur, one’s eyes can’t just be drawn in the general direction - one’s eyes have to be drawn <em>directly to the object by another object</em>. The walls do a great job at directing your eyes to the ceiling, but they don’t direct your eyes to the Menorah. Perhaps the reasoning here is that there’s less publicizing of the miracle if it’s more indirect? Maybe if one just “happens” to see the candles in such a weird way, he won’t process that it’s for the mitzvah? I’m not exactly sure what the logic behind this opinion would be.</p>\n<p>I’m also unclear on what the Tur would hold regarding a Menorah which itself is taller than 20 Amos. Is the Menorah connected enough to the candles that it would be fine? Or are the candles treated as discrete from the Menorah and therefore it would still be Passul?</p>\n<p>In any event: According to Rav Yoel, you are indeed correct that if your eyes can be drawn upwards from 20 Amos, it would be fine. According to the Tur, there’s only a technical reason as to why it doesn’t work, in that the thing which attracts your attention must be directly connected to the thing it’s attracting your attention to. If my theory is correct, then both agree that, in some form, שלטא בה עינא applies here, and therefore your question falls off (Rav Yoel because he agrees and the Tur because he holds it’s inapplicable).</p>\n<p><sup>As an aside, the Beis Yosef’s quotes an interpretation of Rav Yoel that makes the Tur’s question inapplicable. I don’t understand the interpretation, though, so if you have a better idea of what he’s saying, please let me know. Something about something something that makes it harmful to look up? Perhaps a better understanding of his question would provide the groundwork for a better understanding — or further support for our current one — of the dispute between the Tur and Rav Yoel.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

If you don't have a clock, you err on the side of caution - you don't wait until the last minute to daven or to bentch licht, you make sure you do it well before you get into a period of uncertainty.  In generations where they didn't have the ability to measure with more precision, they were much more careful - they knew an approximate amount, and they made sure they were safely within that range.</p>\n\n<p>R' Heinemann suggested that it is really a testament to the lowliness of our generation that we have everything calculated out to the nth decimal point - because we are figuring out the least we have to do to get by.  Once upon a time, they made sure that they got it right by going beyond the exact minimum/maximum.</p>\n\n\n",

Once the week of Tisha B'Av begins (from the Sunday\n  before Tisha B'Av), the number of participants at such a siyum should\n  be limited to a minyan aside from the relatives of the person making\n  the siyum and those who are helping with them meal [Orach Chaim\n  551:10; Mishna Berura, ibid. note 77].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The older people who remembered the First Temple were sad and cried, the younger people who had not seen the First Temple were joyous and blew trumpets. </p>\n\n<p>My question is why did this reaction take place at this event? The full Temple wasn't yet built, only the foundation. If so how did anyone yet know if the Second Temple was going to be greater or lesser than the first? Why didn't people wait until the Temple was actually built to have such a strong emotional reaction?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I think it means that they cried because they saw that the building was going to be smaller than the Temple that Shlomo HaMelech built, which is something that you can see from the size of the foundation.<br>\nSee Rashi, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Ezra.3.12.2\">3:12 sv זה הבית</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כשהיו רואין בניין בית זה <strong>היו בוכין מתוך שהיו זוכרים אותו בניין גדול\n  של בית ראשון</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>When they saw the construction of this (Second) Temple <strong>they cried,\n  because they recalled the large building of the First Temple</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They may have been tipped off to the smaller size of the building due to the size of the stones that they saw being used. See Ralbag (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Ralbag_on_Ezra.3.12\">3:12 sv ביסדו</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ביסדו זה הבית בעיניהם בוכים בקול גדול: ידמה ש<strong>היסוד הזה לא היה נעשה מאבנים גדולות כל כך כמו שהיה בבנין\n  שלמה</strong> שהיו בשעור עשר אמות או שמנה אמות וזה כי לולא זה הנה לא היה הבדל\n  בין יסוד זה הבית ליסוד הבית הראשון כי שיעור ההיכל היה מסכים לשיעורו\n  הראשון</p>\n  \n  <p>It would appear that <strong>this foundation was not made with as large\n  stones as Solomon's Temple</strong> (the First Temple) was made; those were\n  built with stones that were 10 or 8 <em>amos</em> (cubits) in size. If not\n  for this, there would not have been any difference between the\n  foundation of this (Second) Temple to that of the First, because the\n  size of the <em>Heichal</em> (in the Second Temple) was the same as that of\n  the First.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>( <em>all translations are mine</em> )</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>At the risk of breaking the rules of Mi Yodeya!

Despite the fact that we may know it intellectually that most couples are together on a monthly basis nonetheless to activly draw attention to it is a grave sin as the Gemara in Shabbos 33a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר חנן בר רבא הכל יודעין כלה למה נכנסה לחופה אלא כל המנבל פיו אפי'\n  חותמין עליו גזר דין של שבעים שנה לטובה הופכין עליו לרעה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>The Sefer Ikkrei Dinim (Yoreh Deah Siman 21)</strong> in discussing the question of a Chuppas Nidda - a bride who is in Nidda. May the Chosson place the ring on her finger which will inevitably lead to touching her? Or must he slightly place it on her finger being careful not to touch her (as is the opinion of the Maharil quoted in Be'er Hetev Even Haezer [61:8]) <strong>writes that the minhag is not to be concerned as we do not want to publicize that she is in Nidda.</strong> </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is the issue of intimacy being \"meshed\" with tumah today, as mentioned in a different answer. We don't want to broadcast the fact of going to the mikveh.</p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of other factors.\nOne, back in the day we wanted people to know that a woman was tameah. it was important that everyone be aware of her status so they don't accidentally become tameah or make any item tameah. </p>\n\n<p>There's even a teshuvas hageonim discussing women having entirely different sets of household utensils- chairs, dishes etc. for when they are tameah. (It's referenced in Shu\"t Binyan Tzion, and it comes up when discussing the Raavad's shita in Y.D. 193 regarding dam besulim. In the Shita mekubetzes hachadash, in the footnotes in the raavad on that topic, they quote the teshuva.)</p>\n\n<p>The point is, being tameah was well known and was relatively difficult to keep hidden even if she tried. This is why we had the issue of סרך בתה the daughters learning from their mother's immersion as discussed in Y.D. 195.</p>\n\n<p>One additional aspect of the tumas nida is mentioned in the famous Rabbeinu Bechaye regarding Lavan and Rachel in sefer Bereishis 31:35. When Rachel says that she can't stand up for Lavan because \"the way of women is upon her\" (presumably referring to nidus) Lavan doesn't say anything but leaves the tent.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bechaye explains that even the non-jews stayed away from nidos at that time and wouldn't even talk to them because of how powerful the tumas nida was.</p>\n\n<p>Besides the tumah aspect, there's the practical aspect. Before modern female hygienic products were available, menstruation was a messy item. </p>\n\n<p>In Shulchan Aruch Even HaEzer 73:1, when it describes the obligation for a husband to provide clothing for his wife, the be'er hagolah explains based on the gemara that it means he gives her new clothing during the rainy season and the old worn out clothing remain hers to use while she's a nida. </p>\n\n<p>Practically women didn't want to wear nice clothing which would get stained and ruined. So they kept their shmattes to wear monthly.\nSeemingly this applied even after the time of the Shulchan aruch.</p>\n\n<p>Today, things are changed on all three fronts.\n1) Tevilah is now almost exclusively done for intimacy.\n2) We are not concerned about women making things tameah\n3) Especially with feminine hygiene products, women are capable of hiding their nidus entirely.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, we have reason to hide it (tznius), no reason not to hide it (tumah's not an issue) and the option of hiding it (hygiene).</p>\n\n<p>[edit: these points were what came out while learning hilchos nida in kollel in Yerushalayim and discussing these topics with various morei Horaah. I don't remember which rabbonim discussed which points, but these points were all commonly assumed to be the reason for the switch. The last point is especially true- it only really became relevant to discuss hiding menstruation once hygienic products made it possible to hide. That eliminated the practical need for \"bigdei nidus.\"]</p>\n\n<p>It's worth noting that Rav Moshe Feinstein famously discusses this in his teshuva(Igros Moshe Y.D. 2:77) about a couple publicly carrying a baby carriage on a bus while she's a nida.\nThe questioner wanted to be lenient, even though during nidus the couple is not supposed to carry things together (per Y.D. 195) because of kavod habriyus. If everyone sees them not carrying, it will be obvious to the bystanders that she's a nida and she'll be embarrassed.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe responds that there's nothing to be embarrassed about having one's period. He brings proof from the fact that in the olden days women wore bigdei nidus to publicize the fact that they were tameah. He uses that as a proof that even nowadays there's no problem of publicizing her tumah (this is not the same as the need to hide one's tevilah, as he discusses.)\nFor more about the teshuva from Rav Moshe see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/105360/21984\">this answer</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If I might just clarify something here (which has been alluded to above).</p>\n\n<p>Since it is assumed that a couple is likely to have relations on the night the wife goes to the Mikva, there is a strong issue not to let it be known, out of privacy. (One does not broadcast sexual matters.) At the time of the Talmud, and before, the matter was different, since matters of ritual purity had more widespread effects, so the difference was more obvious.</p>\n\n<p>The question here is in regard not to the mikva night, but the entire period during which the couple is permitted to each other. This issue appears to be a stringency that is less universal. (I would also like to know more about it.)</p>\n\n\n",

However,\n  they must say it together word-for-word, for two voices saying the\n  same thing in unison are not heard, except for something heard\n  infrequently that is very dear to the listener. Kaddish (prayer said\n  on behalf of the deceased) surely does not satisfy the first\n  condition. It is even harder to hear voices <strong>that are not in unison,\n  and even harder if they say different Nuscha’os of Kaddish</strong> (prayer\n  said on behalf of the deceased) and do not wait for each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've bolded text in the above, and included the footnote (#21) below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A Sefardi in an Ashkenazi Minyan says ‘va’Yatzmach Purkanei…’ (unless\n  the Tzibur objects – Ohr l’Tziyon 2:5:11). <strong>Ashkenazi Avelim should\n  wait for him</strong> (Doleh u’Mashke p.55). The Tzibur must answer Amen\n  (Salmas Chaim 53). A Sefardi says Yehei Shlama Raba like the Tzibur\n  (Ohr l’Tziyon; Yalkut Yosef (56:25) permits this if he says with\n  Ashkenazim, in order to finish together). [If one waits to finish\n  'Yehei Shlama Raba' together with a Sefardi, who says a longer text,\n  he should wait before saying 'v'Al Kol Yisrael', for 'v'Imru Amen'\n  should be said right after these words - see Mishnah Berurah 56:2.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, a brief answer to the questions in your second paragraph is \"yes\" to both.

This idea is dismissed as a sorry excuse for his failure, as the Jewish. prophets only mentioned a single arrival of the Moshiach.\nIf we take for granted that there will be a twofold arrival of Moshiach, namely Moshiach ben Yosef and afterwards the Moshiach ben Dovid, does this ruin the argument?

If they will not repent and thus become dependent on the final date, \"the Holy One, blessed be He, will set up a ruler over them, whose decrees shall be as cruel as Haman's, thus causing Israel to repent, and thereby bringing them back to the right path.\"14 In other words, if Israel shall return to G‑d on their own and make themselves worthy of the redemption, there is no need for the trials and tribulations associated with the above account of events related to Mashiach ben Yossef.

(Related to comment below - even though the chosson gave an engagement & wedding ring, I gather that this minhag developed partly as a way of the chosson's demonstrating immediate \"commitment\" to his obligations in the kesuvah to support the kallah with clothes and jewelry, etc. Also, in a sense, the day of marriage is like a \"Yom Tov\" for the new couple, and on Yom Tov, it is minhag for the husband to buy jewelry for the wife. What I've heard from someone a while ago. It's a nice minhag and after all, the ketuvah places the majority of the obligations of the chatan towards the kallah, not the other way around. Children, in a sense, are the kallah's gift to the chattan, but that comes about 9 months later. Besides, the present may be an incentive to start \"things\" sooner than later.

    "content": "# Davening maariv occasionally without minyan\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The maariv prayer service was originally established as a reshut and that has ramifications in halacha. Does it affect the obligation to pray maariv with a minyan? Perhaps similar to how we can skip parts of psuke desimra occasionally but not regularly, maybe one can pray without a minyan occasionally.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You may want to study - in depth - the <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01139.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tosafos in Chagiga 9</a>b which has an analysis of the  status of Maariv as a Reshut, nowadays.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א<strong>ו תפלה של ערבית.</strong> אתיא כמאן דאמר \"תפלת ערבית חובה\". ואפילו ל<strong>מאן דאמר \"רשות\", בחנם אין לנו לבטלה אם לא ע''י אונס קצת</strong>, וכן משמע ההיא דתפלת השחר (ברכות דף כו.) \"שכח ולא התפלל ערבית מתפלל שחרית שתים\" וכן (שם דף ל:) \"אם שכח ולא הזכיר של ר''ח בלילה אין מחזירין אותו לפי שאין מקדשין החדש בלילה\", הא \"מקדשין\" מחזירין. ולא מחלק כלל בין למאן דאמר \"רשות\" או בין למאן דאמר \"חובה\", דמשמע דליכא מאן דפליג. וההיא דשבת (דף ט: ושם) \"אי שרא ליה הימייניה לא מטרחינן ליה\" וכן בירושלמי \"אי עלה למטתו לא ירד\" היינו אונס קצת. ולא כפירוש ה''ג שפירש' דאף למאן דאמר רשות אי שויה עליה חובה הויא כחובה, והא ליתא, דמי לא עסקינן בהכי שכבר התפלל בשאר \n  לילות? ואם היינו מפרשים \"שויה עליה חובה באותה לילה\" יתכן ההיא דטעה ולא התפלל ר''ח בלילה ובברכות הארכתי והבאתי ההיא דאמרו (יומא דף פז: ושם) \"דתפלת נעילה פוטרת של \n  ערבית\"\n  :‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bottom line - before in-depth analysis - is that (1) not everybody agrees it's Reshut, and (2) even if it is, it's not voluntary, in that you don't have to say it if you don't want to. Only in extenuating circumstances (like you already went to bed) does the <em>Reshut</em> kick in.</p>\n\n<p>As to your question: <strong>If you skip the Minyan, you miss out on Borchu and Kaddish and Tefila B'Zibur.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first 2 are fulfilments of Mitzvot like ונקדשתי, IRRC.</p>\n\n<p>Tefila B'Zibur has its own merits - like ensuring your Tefila gets answered even if you didn't concentrate properly.</p>\n\n<p>These issues are not connected to Resut - and <strong>missing them is a מעוות לא יוכל לתקון - an irreplaceable loss - as the Gemara there says.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

This was simply an escape plan as the Torah records in verses eight and nine. Had he been compelled to split his camp in order to accommodate his growth, akin to Avraham and Lot splitting in chapter 13, or Esav leaving the area because of Yaakov, chapter 36, than I would understand, but as it is presented, I do not. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I had the opportunity today to pose this question to a certain Rov.\n He said the fact that Yaakov had enough, either in the number of people or possessions, to be able to split into two actual camps was what Yaakov was praising Hashem for.

Rabbah 78:4) We have no permanent name.\nOur names change, (all) according to the service we are commanded [to\ndo] in the mission upon which we are sent</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is the reason that Yaakov wanted to know the angel's name in the first place and what would Yaakov have gained in knowing it? The angel's answer is strange; by the angel's logic should no angel have a name? Although angels may not have a <em>permanent</em> name couldn't Yaakov have been asking the angel for his <em>current</em> name (i.e. concerning his current mission) and if so why did the angel not reveal the name? This implies that Yaakov was enquiring for the angels fixed name, which he didn't have. If so, why did Yaakov think that the angel had a permanent name?!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholom_Schwadron\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sholom Mordechai Hakohen Schwadron</a> (Hebrew: הרב שלום מרדכי הכהן שבדרון‎) (1912–21 December 1997) edited and published two famous mussar texts composed by his teachers — Ohr Yahel by <a href=\"http://www.breslev.co.il/articles/breslevpedia/rabbi_yehuda_leib_chasman.aspx?id=1448&language=english\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Leib Chasman</a> and Lev Eliyahu by Rabbi Elyah Lopian.</p>\n\n<p>Our Rav quoted Rav Chasman as having stated that the malach was stating that this is his name.

Granted that I asked for your current name, but that was because it was in order to tell you that your name will no longer be Ya’akov but Yisrael, but why do you need to ask my name with this explanation?

As evidence that angels can be a proxy for G-d, consider the first few verses of Parasha Vayeira (Genesis 18).  It states that Hashem appeared to Abraham, but in the next verse Abraham lifted his eyes and saw three men (angels).  For Abraham and Jacob, the angels <strong>were</strong> a vision of G-d.</p>\n\n<p>When Jacob asked the angel for his name in Genesis 32:30, he was denied, and instead received a new name (יִשְׂרָאֵל) for himself.  On the other hand, when Moses asked for G-d's name in Exodus 3:13, G-d actually gives him an answer, (אֶהְיֶה).  The difference between Jacob and Moses can explain this observation.  Deuteronomy 34 relates that no prophet ever arose in Israel like Moses, and commentators such as the Rambam also state that Moses was the greatest prophet.  Jacob was a Patriarch and a prophet, but did not come as close to G-d as Moses.  Therefore, he was not ready to receive a particular name associated with G-d from the angel.</p>\n\n\n",

General\natmosphere? (Note that these issues tend to be more problematic the first year a program occupies a hotel.) </li>\n<li>If you have children, are the counselors upstanding, healthy\nteenagers, or poor role models running away from home? (Counselors\nwho smoke on Yom Tov, or drink, are not the people you want watching\nyour children.)</li>\n<li>Is all the wine Mevushal?

How is the meat for the first night prepared?\n (Many people hold that meat cooked with only a little liquid is not\n acceptable for seder night.)</li>\n<li>A key question: How many mashgichim are there relative to the\n number of kitchen staff, kitchens, and guests? (A Rabbi and two\n assistants may be adequate for a 150-person, 1 kitchen hotel. A\n larger hotel needs many, many more. Additionally, the assistants\n must also be trustworthy and mature.) Do the guests constantly see\n the Mashgiach around? (The dining room, that is. Not the lounge,\n and not even the Shul/Beis Medrash.)</li>\n<li>Perhaps the most important question: Are the kitchen staff afraid\n to disobey the Mashgiach? (The cook and waiters are the best people\n to answer this question.)</li>\n<li>Halachik standards: Do they hold of pas yisrael, chalav yisrael,\n gebrokts, chumros in bishul akum, etc.? (You will get easy answers\n on these. If they can't tell you quickly and easily, that's a real\n red flag.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I hope these questions prove useful.

Of course, if you're choosing a hotel that's been \"kashered specifically for Pesach\", that's harder to do. Personally, I would discourage people from selecting such hotels, but that's my own shtick.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lastly, but, still an important factor - ask for recommendations from reliable people who have been to this hotel or other places catered by the same people. In a sense, they can \"vouch\" for the hashgacha (it's not a halachic basis, but, if people you know and trust went there, it lends some sense of \"comfort\" about the hashagcha.) One important piece of info you will get only from such people is about the quality of the hotel and the food. (Pesach in a hotel costs thousands of dollars. You want to make sure you are getting good value and quality PLUS trustworthy hashgacha!)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

These are obligated in Challah and they combine with each other [to form the requisite minimum amount of dough], and they are prohibited as Chodosh before Pesach and to reap [them] before the Omer [offering is brought].

In short, the Chadash prohibition applies to those same \"5 grains\" that can become chametz and that you say mezonot/hamotzi on (among other rules). The cutoff for all of them is the day of the offering of the Korban HaOmer, namely 16 Nissan. (In the Diaspora <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/28194/759\">due to doubt</a> the date is 17 Nissan but practically this is irrelevant as any Kosher for Pesach food you'll find nowadays is already certified Yoshon.)</p>\n\n<p>Translating the names of the species is somewhat controversial as is defining exactly what cultivars are included in the same species.

Traditionally, these have been assumed to be wheat and barley which are mentioned explicitly in the Torah (\"ארץ חטה ושעורה\"), and spelt, oats, and rye, which the Rabbis said are subsumed in חטה ושעורה.  Of the 5, oats is the one most controversially included considering its negligible gluten content (see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/kosher_articles/Celiac%20-%20A%20Guide%20to%20Halachic%20Observance%20%28JoHaCS%202010%29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.crcweb.org/kosher_articles/Celiac%20-%20A%20Guide%20to%20Halachic%20Observance%20%28JoHaCS%202010%29.pdf</a> esp. fn 5).  The biblical cutoff date is Nissan 16 or in the Diaspora, Nissan 17.  In addition, J. Herman in Monsey, NY publishes annual \"Chodosh Guides\" that indicate (based on USDA crop reports) cutoff dates for the various crops and grain-based consumer products before which one can be relatively certain chodosh has not yet hit store shelves.

I.e. - the talk seems to imply \"their possessions are already ours; we don't have to negotiate with them, as long as we all agree to be circumcised.\"</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the people already knew what Chamor had done; no objection to the idea. Everyone agreed and liked the proposal offered to them, and Chamor himself was already circumcised, thus setting the example for others. Granted, he doesn't mention that his main motive was to marry Dinah. But, in addition to the \"taking of possesions\", Chamor and Shchem also mention that they will exchange daughters with Ya'akov's family. This part was not a lie (he did say that to Ya'akov, directly.) In short, it was not as if the townspeople were completely forced into accepting the proposal.

What do modern rabbis write?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>OK, so - the Torah is the same as the Pentateuch/first five books of the Christian Old Testament; the Tanakh is <em>roughly</em> the same as the OT, but there are some differences in ordering, inclusion, etc. In the First and Second Temple periods, these were supplemented by the \"Oral Torah\", traditions about the interpretation and meaning of the Tanakh passed down, well, orally; following the various crises of the first few centuries CE, the Oral Torah was written down as a collection of books called the Talmud. All right so far? (If not, please correct me.)</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is there a general term for later commentary, or commentary <em>on</em> the Talmud itself? And, if there is, is it divided into subcategories and how? Is it by degree (so, for instance the <em>Mishneh Torah</em> and a modern rabbi's commentary on the Torah are in the same class, and the same rabbi's book on the <em>Mishneh Torah</em> is in a different one)? Or by date, so the latter two would be grouped together? Or is the question meaningless in that sense because nobody writes \"on the <em>Mishneh Torah</em>\" but rather by trying to synthesize as much past scholarship as possible? </p>\n\n<p>Pardon me if this question is really basic or completely off-base.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The First Temple period is still covered by Tanakh. Tanakh finishes off just as they've gotten the Second Temple going.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, there are broad categories. <em>Timewise</em>, we refer to the following periods, very roughly:</p>\n\n<p><em>Tannaim</em> -- those who wrote the first stage of the Talmud (e.g. the Mishna). This starts in the early second Temple period (though we don't have a lot of writing on it), a few hundred years BCE, and ends around the year 200, when Rabbi Judah the Prince edited the <em>Mishna.</em> That's the core framework of Oral Law. Most questions of how to <em>legally</em> interpret Biblical verses are settled by this point. E.g. by the end of the <em>Tannaim</em>, we know that \"an eye for an eye\" is just a figurative expression for monetary payment. No one after this point in history will challenge that. (Though they may argue that the verse was also indicating that morally, an eye for an eye is what's <em>deserved</em>, but no one would practically say that's what should be done.)</p>\n\n<p><em>Amoraim</em> -- the next stage of the Talmud, generally commenting on/interpreting the Mishna. (And deciding which opinion in the Mishna to follow.) That wraps up around the year 500.</p>\n\n<p><em>Gaonim</em> -- roughly 500 to 1000. (Technically there are the \"Savoraim\" in the middle there someplace, making some final edits on the Talmud, but that's really nitty-gritty.) They tend to write responsa, in which their answers cite the Talmud. Occasionally we'll see a few Talmud commentaries, but not that much.</p>\n\n<p><em>Rishonim</em> -- from around the year 1000 until 1500. Three things happen right around 1500: the printing press becomes popular, so we're seeing things printed, rather than handwritten; the Jews are expelled from Spain, which causes sociological shifts; and Rabbi Yosef Karo writes the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, the most-popular code of Jewish Law.</p>\n\n<p><em>Achronim</em> From 1500 until -- well, the disruptions of the 20th Century generally have caused us to demarcate a new era.</p>\n\n<p>Functionally, you'll see the <em>Rishonim</em> writing primary commentaries on the Talmud. E.g. the Talmud says you should rinse meat before salting it to remove the blood; if you look in Rabbi A's Talmud commentary from the 1100s, he'll tell you the reason is \"to get the grime off.\" If you look in Rabbi B's Talmud commentary from the 1200s, he'll tell you the reason is \"to soften the meat so soaking will work better.\"</p>\n\n<p>At the time, most either wrote commentaries tied to the text of the Talmud, or responsa (answers to questions, where the answers will cite the Talmud.)</p>\n\n<p>As a young man Maimonides wrote his own commentary to a few books of the Talmud, but we don't have much of that. What he originated was a free-standing \"code of law\" (with a different organization structure than the Talmud), where you have to go back and figure out \"what piece of the Talmud is he based off here?\", and \"how did he interpret that piece of Talmud?\"</p>\n\n<p>In the 1500s, we saw the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> saying that <em>generally speaking</em>, we won't propose new <em>legal</em> interpretations on the Talmud beyond what's already been put there; the question is now which of those interpretations over the past 500 years should we follow, and how to interpret <em>those interpretations</em>, as well as new questions that arise. In this example, we find in the Shulchan Aruch: \"you should soak the meat for half an hour, to accommodate the medieval opinion that the reason is softening; however, if you were really in a bind, you could follow the opinion that the reason is to remove the surface blood, and therefore a good rinse will suffice.\"</p>\n\n<p>Since then, we'll still see responsa, commentaries on the Talmud, and commentaries on the newer legal codes, but they are expected to reference the prior periods' works.</p>\n\n\n",

Indeed, this rationalist\ntendency is evident in some of the commentaries on Qur’an 3, 7 that\nBar-Asher presented to the audience. The very early Qur’an exegete\nMuqatil ibn Sulayman (d. 767) explains that the muhkamāt are\nprescriptive verses dictating laws such as: “be good to your parents,\nand [do] not slay your children because of poverty…that you approach\nnot any indecency outward or inward…and fill up the measure and\nbalance with justice” (Qur’an 6:151-153). Bar-Asher suggested that\nthis definition of muhkamāt parallels Saadia’s category of “rational\ncommandments” (mitzvot sikhliyyot). According to Muqatil ibn Sulayman\nthe mutashābihāt are the mysterious letters alif, lam, mim, etc.\nappearing at the beginning of some sura’s of the Qur’an—the meaning of\nwhich is unknown. Also giving Qur’an 3, 7 a “halakhic” valence, abu\nUbayd (d. 838), another early commentator, equates the muhkamāt with\nthe so-called “abrogating” verses of the Qur’an, while the\nmutashābihāt are the “abrogated” verses, i.e., laws that were given at\nan early stage but superseded by (“abrogating”) verses given later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the Rambam (שו״ת הרמבם)describes the Koran in very negative terms calling it invented and confused stories.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואינו מותר דבר מזה לישמעאלים, לפי מה שידוע לכם על אמונתם, שתורה זו\nאינה מן השמים, וכאשר ילמדום דבר מן כתוביה (וימצאוהו) מתנגד למה <strong>שבדו הם\nמלבם לפי ערבוב הסיפורים ובלבול העניינים אשר באו להם</strong>, (הרי) לא תהיה זו\nראיה אצלם, <strong>שטעות בידיהם</strong>, אלא יפרשוה לפי הקדמותיהם המופסדות ויוכלו\nלהשיב עלינו בזה בטענתם ויטעו כל גר וישראל, שאין לו דעת, ויהיה זה מכשול\nלישראל האסורין ביניהם בעונותם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While Islam is not avoda zara, for a Jew to accept Islam (theoretically) would make them an apikoros. The Quran teaches that the Torah of the Jews has mistakes and should not be followed, the Oral Law is fake, Jesus is a prophet and the moshiach (even though they don’t worship him), Muhammad is a prophet, Shabbos is not to be kept, it was acceptable for Muhammad to conquer and destroy Jewish communities for resisting his authority, and many more things against Torah. Any one of these beliefs would make one a heretic according to Halacha. This is like asking whether or not it is acceptable to read Richard Dawkins.</p>\n<p>Yes, one may read the Quran to understand the nature of Islam and answer to their criticisms, just as one may do for Christianity. Hai Gaon, for example, was familiar with Christianity. But may one read it to gain from its teachings?

If it's understanding you wish to gain, and it's permitted for avodah zarah, I can't imagine Islam (which isn't \"avodah zarah\" technically) being off limits.

Rashi explains that this is because a Ben Noach who steals is put to death. We are worried that if the new convert sees people taking the Leket, Shikcha or Peah he will think they are stealing and kill them without warning.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we can connect this idea to the verses mentioned in the question. Since the laws of Leket, Shikcha, and Peah are novel to the ger, the passuk adds mention of the ger as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I would argue that the גֵּר is mentioned in Leviticus 19 and 23 above along with the עָנִי above because it was not uncommon for a convert to also be needy.  The Torah warns 36 times, according to Bava Metzia 59b, against wronging a convert.  So the warnings against treating a convert differently go back to the time of Moses.  It is not difficult to imagine that if converts were being treated differently that they would also be outsiders from an economic point of view.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this reasoning, Leviticus 19 and 23 mention the convert as a special class of people in line with the 36 other admonitions which appear throughout the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Re-explaining parshanut when the explanation is given\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Over Shabbos, I heard the same dvar Torah twice - basically, that which the Talmud says Yaakov went back for his small vessels that he had forgotten (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8227#showrashi=true&v=25\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereishis 32:25</a>) was because he understood that everything he had was a gift from Hashem and he wanted to use everything for <em>kedusha</em> (spiritual matters).</p>\n\n<p>It's a nice idea, and I myself used to think that was the <em>p'shat</em> (the simplest explanation of the verse).  But the Gemara (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=91&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chulin 91a</a>) that introduces this idea itself says a different explanation - that the righteous value their possessions because they do not steal.  So it seems Yaakov went back for the small vessels because he either didn't want to come to ever be tempted to steal, or because he won't be able to make up for it by stealing if he loses these things.  Or something else, but either way it has something to do with not stealing.</p>\n\n<p>I don't want to get caught up on the example - my question is a general one, and that is, is there any validity or justification to giving a different explanation to a story/fact/mitzvah/halacha when the source of that story/fact/mitzvah/halacha itself reports the explanation?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>The question seems to be confusing some people, so let me clarify what I <em>am</em> asking and what I am <em>not</em> asking.</p>\n\n<p>My question was only in a situation like that which I mentioned - Quoting a Chazal, then giving an explanation to that Chazal which is different than how Chazal themselves explain it. It is neither of the following: a) quoting a chazal, then attributing an explanation to Chazal which they do not say b) not quoting a Chazal, and making up your own p'shat which may happen to coincide with a Chazal, and then making up your own explanation for your own p'shat.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Just because the redactors of the gemora decided to include a certain exposition in the gemora for some reason known to them, does not negate the existence neither in the past or the future of other possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>Using the example that you bring in the question, Ya’akov was left alone because he went back for some reason. The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 77:2) says he went back to see if he had forgotten anything and expounds that he found some silk (according to one of the commentaries). The gemora records a different suggestion, that he found small vessels, and there may have been many other suggestions as to what he found. The gemora then recorded one particular explanation as to why he checked for forgotten items, but again there could well have been many reasons given at that time but the redactors of the gemora chose to teach us only this one reason.</p>\n\n<p>Thus those who give a different explanation as to why Ya’akov returned for the small vessels are doing nothing unusual, and requires no justification.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Although you ask not to get hung up on the example, I think it must be addressed. ויעבור את אשר לו means that he was involved with bringing his possessions over the river. The fact that he was on one side of the river by himself basically implies he was making the last trip across himself or that he forgot something and went back. Chazzal told us it was the latter, and why he cared. Rashi himself split this chazzal by quoting the fact that he forgot the little vessels without explainng why Yaakov cared. The vessels therefore are implied in the passuk while the reason is not. It would then be well within the rights of a darshan to expound on the reasoning.</p>\n\n\n",

The less effective argument that I made (although I don't know if it was worthless) was that they can't appreciate what this issue means to me because they see it as a matter of personal preference, and why should my preferences mean offending someone else.  I explained that to me, this is something objectively not okay, and just as they wouldn't ask me to attend a murder, they shouldn't ask me to attend this event.

He spends 2 years in Egyptian prison, telling the cup-bearer (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8235#v=15\">Bereishis 40:15</a>) that he should help him get out of prison since he was stolen from his homeland (implying he wants to get back).  Then, he gets out of prison, and names his children in thanks to G-d for helping him forget his father's household (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8236#v=51\">Bereishis 41:51</a>) and for making him successful in Egypt (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8236#v=52\">Bereishis 41:52</a>)! What happened between was Pharaoh's dreams.  Yosef saw in these dreams, in addition to the message to Pharaoh, a prophecy being sent to him.  In the dream, he saw the 7 cows which were יפות מראה (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8236#v=2\">Bereishis 41:2</a>) get devoured by the 7 cows that were דקות (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8236#v=3\">Bereishis 41:3</a>), and one can't help but notice that וְעֵינֵי לֵאָה רַכּוֹת וְרָחֵל הָיְתָה יְפַת תֹּאַר וִיפַת מַרְאֶה (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8224#v=17\">Bereishis 29:17</a>).  Yosef saw for himself a message in the dream, that the sons of Leah were to overcome and vanquish the sons of Rachel, who was יפת מראה. And then Yosef thought of how Yaakov had sent him to go find his brothers, despite Yaakov no doubt being aware of how they harbored hatred against him.  And Yosef noted that in every generation of this Chosen people, there had been a chosen son and a rejected son - Avraham had cast away Yishma'el, and Eisav was cut out of the family in the following generation.  Perhaps the children of Rachel were the next to be pruned out.</p>\n\n<p>Then he sees his brothers arrive.  And who is missing?  None other than Binyomin, the other son of Rachel!  Yosef assumes he must have been cast away as well, and he arranges to find out.  Upon discovering that Binyomin is still around, Yosef decides it is his responsibility to get Binyomin away from them.  So he arranges to have them bring Binyomin down, and then has Binyomin siezed in such a way that it seems to be his own fault.  The brothers have only to let him go, since it is his own fault for stealing. After all, like mother like son ([see Rashi to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8226#showrashi=true&v=33\">Bereishis 31:33</a>).</p>\n\n<p>But to his surprise, Yehuda steps up and offers himself in Binyomin's stead!  Not only that, but he has actually put his own life on the line for Binyomin's safety (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8239#v=32\">Bereishis 44:32</a>), and their father is very concerned with Binyomin's well-being (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8239#v=20\">Bereishis 44:20</a>).  Yosef's notions are shattered, he sees that there was no conspiracy against the family of Rachel, and he reveals himself.</p>\n\n<p>I heard this from talmidim of R' Goldvicht, but it can be found in אסופת מערכות.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Radak indeed does. He says that Yosef was trying to cause them emotional anguish without hurting them physically or monetarily (Bereishis 42:9,17;44:1).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While not necessarily saying that Yosef was acting with ill-will or seeking revenge, R. Yoel Bin-Nun, as well as R. Chaim Yaakov Goldwicht (see YeZ's answer to this question) to explain that Yosef felt fully estranged from his family the whole time.

This interpretation is noted at the end of the omissions from the Yerushalmi on Zera'im, \"so as to fill up the page\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And for the record, the idea that Yosef was seeking revenge or the like is mentioned by the Ramban, but roundly rejected</p>\n\n<p>For other (eight total) approaches, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/50812/why-did-yosef-cause-so-much-anguish-to-his-family/50813#50813\">here</a></p>\n\n\n",

Chazal (Niddah 66a; YD 192:1-3) require that upon accepting a marriage proposal or setting a wedding date, a woman has to observe seven “clean days,” due to the concern that she may discharge some blood as a result of the excitement. However, this halachah only applies to her initial acceptance of a marriage\nproposal. Even if a woman accepts a marriage proposal without ever seeing her intended, upon seeing him, she need not be concerned about dam chimud.</p>\n<p>Thus, the link between the halachah of dam chimud and the need to separate the week before the wedding seems weak at best.</p>\n<p>Even Rabbi Forst, who cites dam chimud as a basis for the practice, concedes in a footnote: “Nevertheless, the hypothesis that the custom is based upon the chance of dam chimud is difficult to accept.” He concludes by stating: “The purpose of these lines is merely to show that the custom of not meeting one another has no basis in the halachah of dam chimud, not to belittle the custom.”</p>\n<p><strong>Ironically, dam chimud might be a reason that they should see each other, because according to the Talmud (Niddah 20b), a woman who pines for her absent husband will experience dam chimud.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My conclusion: Your question is valid - and the custom is widespread but faulty.</p>\n\n\n",

Each name was directly correlated to the experience of having that child, ie very individualized. Reuben is a conjunction of the hebrew of \"seeing\" and the hebrew word for \"son\". Thus alluding to Hashem seeing her affliction and remedying it with a son. Judah has to do with giving thanks for Judah being the fourth child which connotes abundance. But Rachel has Joseph, her first child ever!, and then just asks for another. It makes it seem that Joseph was just a means to an end or a segue but nothing else.

I emphasized, however, that I was speaking of modern and contemporary science, as it differs from Ptolemaic and medieval science when conflicting views were held on this subject. Modern science, on the other hand, having rejected both systems, has reached conclusions which present no problem to one holding to the belief that the sun revolves around the earth, as I have explained at some length somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>By the Grace of G-d \nRosh Chodesh Kislev 5736 \nBrooklyn, NY</p>\n\n<p>Greeting and Blessing:</p>\n\n<p>This is in reply to your inquiry on the question of the rotation of the sun and the earth in relation to each other, namely, whether the sun revolves around the earth, or the earth around the sun, and which view is to be accepted, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I presume you have in mind the scientific view, i.e., what science has to say on this question, and I will address myself to this aspect.</p>\n\n<p>It is well known that this was a controversial issue in ancient and medieval science. However, since about half a century ago, with the introduction of the theory of relativity, the latter has been universally accepted as the basis of modern science. To be sure, in the beginning there were scientists working under the Soviet regime who opposed the relativity theory – for various reasons which need not be reviewed here, but even this opposition fell by the wayside later, so that now all scientists generally accept the theory of relativity as the latest and most plausible scientific system.</p>\n\n<p>One of the conclusions of the theory of relativity is that when there are two systems, or planets, in motion relative to each other – such as the sun and earth in our case – either view, namely, the sun rotating around the earth, or the earth rotating around the sun, has equal validity. Thus, if there are phenomena that cannot be adequately explained on the basis of one of these views, such difficulties have their counterpart also if the opposite view is accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the scientific conclusion that both views have equal validity is the result not of any inadequacy of available scientific data, of technological development (measuring instruments, etc.), in which case it could be expected that further scientific and technological advancement might clear up the matter eventually and decide in favor of one or the other view. On the contrary, the conclusion of contemporary science is that regardless of any future scientific advancement, the question as to which is our planetary center, the sun or the earth, must forever remain unresolved, since both views will always have the same scientific validity, as stated.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, it follows that anyone declaring that a person who chooses to accept one of these systems in preference to the other is a fool, while one who accepts the other is a wise man – such a judgment shows that the person making it is ignorance of the conclusions of modern science, or that he has not advanced beyond the science of Ptolemy and Copernicus. Obviously, a person not versed in the development of science in the course of the past half-century or so is not qualified to make any judgment pertaining to science.</p>\n\n<p>A further point may be added, though perhaps not directly pertinent to our discussion. It is that every person, including modern scientists, actually has three options to choose from in this matter:</p>\n\n<p>a) That A revolves around B. \nb) That B revolves around A. \nc) That A and B revolve around each other.</p>\n\n<p>But such a choice cannot be dictated by science; it would be one’s personal choice and belief.</p>\n\n<p>What has been said above is – to repeat – the deduction of the theory of relativity, as it is expounded in various scientific tests, and it can be checked with any scientist who is thoroughly familiar with the said theory. Of course, on the elementary and high school level, science in general, and the so-called Solar System in particular, is taught from relatively simple textbooks, and the change in the scientific attitude towards the subject under discussion is not emphasized. But, as stated, it would be quite simple to verify it with any scientist who knows this particular field.</p>\n\n<p>With esteem and blessing,</p>\n\n<p>[signature]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In a letter posted <a href=\"http://www.torahscience.org/torahsci/rebbeletter.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> discussing reinterpreting established Torah truths in light of modern discoveries, the Rebbe zy\"a writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was conceivable, in those days, that if one approached a student who dabbled in science and told him that according to the Torah-hashkofo [Torah outlook], the sun revolves around the earth, he might well repudiate Torah altogether. So, in an effort to encourage the student to put on Teffilin [ritual prayer boxes], the well-meaning Rabbi did not mind conceding that the earth revolved around the sun. But surely there is no longer any justification whatever to perpetuate this ‘inferiority complex!’ Certainly there is no basis for holding on to views which have come down in outdated elementary and high school textbooks on science.</p>\n<p>This matter of the sun and the earth is a further case in point. To declare categorically in the name of science, that the earth revolves around the sun, and not vise versa, is, as noted above, turning the scientific clock back to the 19th century and Medieval science. It is also at variance with the theory of relativity, which has likewise been universally accepted. Science now declares—as categorically as it is permissible for contemporary science—that where two bodies in space are in relative motion, it is scientifically impossible to determine which is at rest and which in motion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would seem that he felt that \"conceding that the earth revolves around the sun\" was an inappropriate reinterpretation of an established fact of Torah hashkafa.</p>\n\n\n",

Ibn Ezra happened to side with the executioner option.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>@Gershon Gold is correct that the term for cooking is בישול.</p>\n\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=561\" rel=\"nofollow\">Targum and Peirush Yonatan on Breishit 43:16</a>, where Yosef uses the term טבוח טבח. There, Peirush Yonatan says that this refers to \"slaughtering\" or \"butchering\" a goat. So, your original assumption seems correct that the Sar Hatabahim was the chief butcher.</p>\n\n<p>As to how the term \"מטבח\" came to mean \"kitchen\" in modern Hebrew, I am surmising that butchers then, perhaps prepared the meat themselves after slaughtering it, so they were in a sense, chefs, also. I agree with Gershon's statement that Modern Hebrew, frequently, does not reflect original Biblical Hebrew. מטבח See next answer for further explanations...</p>\n\n<p>Compare, <strong>possibly</strong> a similar idea in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=226\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breishit 18:7</a> when Avraham feeds the angels. It says Avraham took a calf and gave it to the lad, and \"He hurried to prepare it\". While not explicit, I am inferring a bit from Rash\"i that the lad was Ishma'el, and the \"he\" in the verse means Ishama'el. \"Preparing it\" means making it ready to be eaten, i.e. - both slaughtering and cooking. While the term טבח is not mentioned, here, I'm attempting to prove that those that did the slaughtering for the meal, also cooked it.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn't imply, that there weren't plain butchers around who just slaughtered meat. But perhaps, Sar Hatabahim, could have been mainly the head of butchers, and by inference, since then, the butchers also cooked the food, he was the chief \"chef\" as well. Again, no verse proof, but my thinking through this process.</p>\n\n\n",

What, if anything, does a <em>musar vaad</em> have to do with the sort of <em>vaad</em> I'm familiar with?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Generally a Mussar Vaad provides a more intense and personal level of engagement with an eye to self improvement, thus it usually consists of a small group of students.</p>\n\n<p>A Mussar Vaad can take many forms. It can take the form of a classic \"shmuess\"- lecture, which is given traditionally by the Mashgiach or Rosh Yeshiva of the yeshiva which focuses on either a particular idea or sefer. However, it differs from a shmuess /shiur in the sense that it is most often a weekly lecture that is built on the previous week's topic with an eye to further deepen the understanding of the topic at hand. This can be seen from the sefarim of Rav Shlomo Wolbe in the Alei Shor which features such weekly vaadim recorded for posterity. </p>\n\n<p>The participation level of a Vaad can also differentiate it from a regular shiur/lecture. Normally asking questions in a regular shiur would be frowned upon. However, in a Vaad, questions can be encouraged to further the discussion. Furthermore, in a Mussar Vaad, when focusing on one topic or midda, ie. anivus, the lecturer can leave the group with a challenge aimed to perfect that midda, and generally the following week the attendees can discuss their triumphs or failures with the challenge given. (This I personally witnessed from Rav Yechiel Perr) </p>\n\n<p>There is also a rotating Vaad, in which the attendees of the Vaad give over the topic on a rotating basis. Sometimes with the switching of the speaker there is also a switching of topics.</p>\n\n<p>Most notably, in the Lithuanian Yeshiva of Novardok they had instituted a very unique type of Vaad, which diverged greatly from other Mussar yeshivos in Lithuania (ie. Slabodka, Kelm, Telz etc.) in something called the \"Birzeh\" in which students would break up into small groups and critique each other's decisions/characteristics with an eye towards sharpening each other's eye towards self betterment. This is the most intense form of a Vaad and is not considered the norm among mainstream yeshivas. (As heard from Rav Yechiel Yitzchok Perr) </p>\n\n<p>The word Vaad means \"commitee\" or \"council\". The reason why it is called a Vaad is due to the primary focus of it. The Vaad attendees desire counsel and insight into how they can further their growth and development, and seek that council from either the main lecturer, or his fellow peers on the personal level which is fostered throughout the Vaad.</p>\n\n<p>Many of this I know through my exposure to Yeshivos that place an emphasis on learning Mussar.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does a teacher have to ask forgiveness for embarrassing a student after scolding him?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If a teacher/rebbi scolded a student for making fun of another student, and this rebuke was given in front of others, which embarrassed the student, does the rebbi have to ask that student for forgiveness? If not, why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Rambam, <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1304.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">laws of Torah Teaching, Chapter 4</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ד,ז  [ה] לא יהיה התלמיד בוש מחבריו שלמדו מפעם ראשונה או שנייה, והוא לא למד אלא אחר כמה פעמים:  שאם נתבייש מדבר זה--נמצא נכנס ויוצא לבית המדרש, והוא אינו למד כלום.  לפיכך אמרו חכמים הראשונים, אין הביישן למד, ולא הקפדן מלמד.</p>\n  \n  <p>ד,ח  במה דברים אמורים, בזמן שלא הבינו התלמידים הדבר מפני עומקו, או מפני דעתן שהיא קצרה; אבל אם ניכר לרב שהן מתרשלין בדברי תורה ומתרפין עליהן, ולפיכך לא הבינו--חייב לרגוז עליהן ולהכלימן בדברים, כדי לחדדן; ובעניין זה אמרו חכמים, זרוק מרה בתלמידים.</p>\n  \n  <p>A student shouldn't feel embarrassed if his colleagues understand something after the first or second explanation, but he needs more -- as if he's too embarrassed (to ask), he will have come and gone from the study hall without learning anything! Therefore our Sages said, \"someone too embarrassed can't learn, and someone too demanding can't teach.\"</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>However</strong>, this only applies if the students don't understand because the subject is too deep or their intellectual capacity too narrow. <em>But if the teacher feels that the students are goofing off and therefore not understanding, he is obligated to act agitated and verbally humiliate them, in order to sharpen them</em>. And in this context, our Sages said, \"throw bile at your students!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So <em>in theory</em> -- I repeat -- <em>in theory</em> -- there can be instances where a teacher has the right to embarrass a student. When is this appropriate, when is this necessary, and will it have the desired effect -- those are much more difficult questions. So perhaps the teacher might apologize \"I'm sorry I went too far\", or \"I'm sorry if I misjudged and felt this was the only appropriate way, when there may have been other options.\" But he wouldn't say \"Halacha forbids me to ever, ever embarrass a student.\"</p>\n\n<p>See also the <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2014/08/making-lonely-man/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">conversation from Nachum Lamm and Joel Rich on TorahMusings</a>, about Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveichik:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a story of the time the Rav humiliated a student in front of the whole class for asking a question he felt was not so good. Of course, the Rav apologized (after, it is stressed, we are told that he realized the student’s question was a good one, leaving unsaid the question of what if it hadn’t been). ... </p>\n  \n  <p>I remember reading that The Rav was raised in learning this way by his father, perhaps due to the fact that such geniuses could only understand a poor [logical argument] as a reflection of intellectual laziness. It wasn’t until the year of triple aveilut [1967, in which he lost his mother, brother, and wife] that he realized this wasn’t true.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is sufficient evidence to suggest that they would need to ask for forgiveness.</p>\n<p>Perhaps an important starting point is the famous משנה in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.12?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">פרקי אבות ד:יב</a> that writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"יהי כבוד תלמידך חביב עליך כשלך\"</p>\n<p>“The honour of your student should be as dear to you as your own”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, in this context, it would be fair to say that in the same way an adult would feel upset upon being embarrassed and would appreciate an apology the same would ring true for a child.</p>\n<p>This scenario brings to mind a famous מעשה that happened with the Steipler זצ\"ל:</p>\n<p>It once happened that he scolded a child mistakenly. When he realised that he had made an error, he wanted to seek the child out to ask for מחילה. However, the Steipler realised that קטנים לאו בני מחילה נינהו, children under the age of בר מצוה cannot forgive. As a result, he kept this matter stored aside in his heart. When the boy turned thirteen and celebrated his בר מצוה, the guests at the סעודת מצוה were surprised by an impromptu visit of the גדול הדור, none other than the Steipler himself! As one would expect, the Rov was immediately ushered to the top table to sit alongside the בר מצוה boy. Using this as his opportunity he was able to have a few moments to speak with the boy in confidence. The Steipler departed shortly afterwards. The boy would later reveal that the Steipler had come to ask for forgiveness and to accord the בר מצוה boy some כבוד by sharing in his שמחה. (As related in <a href=\"https://www.lehmanns.co.uk/artscroll-history-series-5-great-lives-biography-by-rabbi-shimon-finkelman-11100.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shimon Finkelman's <em>Five Great Lives</em>, Mesorah Publications</a> - p.56 and other places.)</p>\n<p>Moreover, One must be cognisant of the fact that בין אדם לחבירו is not just between adults; any resulting prohibitions also apply equally to children. The תורה famously writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"הוכח תוכיח את עמיתך ולא תשא עליו חטא\"</p>\n<p>“You shall surely rebuke your friend, and do not bear a sin because of him” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.17?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 19:17</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.17?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Leviticus.19.17.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רש\"י</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.17?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Sifra%2C_Kedoshim%2C_Chapter_4.8&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ספרא</a> understand the verse to mean that although a person is required to admonish wrongdoers it must not come through embarrassment. This notion gives rise to the negative מצוה of מלבין פני חבירו – publicly humiliating a person (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.240.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ספר החינוך מצוה רמ</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Mitzvot_Gadol%2C_Negative_Commandments.6.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סמ\"ג לאוין ו</a>). Such an act is regarded as a terrible transgression and is something that חז\"ל comment, results in no share of עולם הבא (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.59a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בבא מציעא נט</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.3.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">משנה תורה, הלכות תשובה, ג:יד</a>). This is because the act of publicly shaming a person is like killing them,  and it is actually better to give up one’s life first, than to cause public embarrassment to a fellow Jew. In מסכת בבא מציעא נט – The text reads;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"נוח לו לאדם שיפיל עצמו לכבשן האש ואל ילבין פני חבירו ברבים\"</p>\n<p>“<em>Better had a man thrown himself into a fiery furnace than embarrass his friend publicly</em>.”)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, and perhaps most compellingly, Rav Pam zt\"l asserts (in עטרה למלך, 'זהירות בכבוד קטנים', עמוד צ):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ואין היתר להורים ומורים יותר משאר בני אדם בענין זה אלא אם הוא לצורך\nחינוך ומוסר לטובת הקטן אבל שכיח טובא שהנזק בזה מרובה על התועלת\"</p>\n<p><em>“And there is no more permission for parents or teachers [to cause a child\nto feel shame] than for anyone else, unless it is for the purpose of\neducation or teaching for the good of the child. However, it is far\nmore frequent that the damage caused by this is greater than the\nbenefit.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

See Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah siman 174 and Pischei Tshuvah #1 in the name of the Noda BiYehuda. \nHe says the Mechaber's case of a sale with an option to be mivatel the sale at a later date is where the Mechaber says the fruits eaten would be ribbis. However, where the stipulation is to sell the land back, meaning till now it was a real sale, the Noda Biyehuda thinks it would be fine 'if not for the fact that he is scared to say such a thing'. Which is why it might not be a real ruling.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't see a problem in this scenario. Bava Metzia 65b says outright that it is okay to use land as collateral, which will pass into the lender's property when the borrower defaults on the loan. On that basis, treat this transaction as a loan and not as a sale: Reuven lends Shimon $10,000 and uses Shimon's field as collateral. The condition of the loan is that Shimon needs to return this money within the space of, say, a month, or else the field becomes Reuven's property. Once it has become the property of Reuven, what rule could there possibly be to forbid his selling it back at a different price? You could even <em>call</em> it a sale if you wanted to, since the end result is the same either way: Reuven pays $10,000 and acquires a piece of land, and one year later Shimon pays $12,000 and acquires it back.</p>\n\n<p>Note, that for this to not fall into the trap of constituting a possessory mortgage, it would be necessary to stipulate at the time of the loan that the land becomes Reuven's <em>from this point in time</em> if Shimon defaults at the end of the pre-determined period (Hilkhot Malveh veLoveh 6:4, Tur/SA Yoreh Deah 164:4).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was Yosef, and not Binyamin, the favored son?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8232#showrashi=true&v=3\">Bereishit 37:3</a> says that the reason Yosef was Yaakov's favorite is \"because he was a son of his old age\".  But while Yosef is <em>a</em> son of Yaakov's old age, so is his younger brother Binyamin.  Further, Binyamin is the last child of Yaakov's favorite wife, who died giving birth to him -- so her last act in this world, in a sense, was giving Yaakov his twelfth son.  It therefore puzzles me that Binyamin, the baby of the family and one with seemingly-special attachment to Rachel, isn't Yaakov's favorite.  Why is that?</p>\n\n<p>Rashi's comment on this verse is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a son of his old age: Heb. - בֶן זְקֻנִים, for he was born to him in his old age (Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, ch. 38). Onkelos rendered: for he was a wise son to him. Whatever he had learned from Shem and Eber he gave over to him. Another explanation: for his (Joseph’s) features (זִיו אִיקוֹנִין) resembled his own (those of Jacob). [From Gen. Rabbah 84:8]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer as cited by Rashi doesn't address my question, as already explained.  Onkelos (as explained by Rashi) gives reasons for Yosef to be favored, but they don't seem to be tied to the <em>p'shat</em> (child of Yaakov's old age).  Ditto the explanation from B'reishit Rabbah.</p>\n\n<p>It could be that Yaakov doesn't favor Binyamin because he'll always be a reminder of his mother's death, but I haven't found anything that actually says that yet (so it's just an idea).  Are there other interpretations that address this question?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Your idea that Yaakov does not favor Binyamin as highly because he is a reminder of Rachel's death is suggested by the Chizkuni:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם תאמר הרי בנימין בן זקונים יותר, אלא אין אהבת בנימין קשורה בלבו של יעקב כאהבתו של יוסף, לפי שכשילדתו אמו מתה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other commentators address this question as well:</p>\n<p>R' Yosef Bechor Shor and Ralbag opine that\nYosef is called בן זקונים because he is Yaakov's long-awaited son from his most beloved wife, Rachel, with whom Yaakov had no children until his old age.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כשנאמר שיוסף היה ליעקב במדרגת בן זקונים שבא אחר היאוש, ולזה תקשר יותר אהבת האב בו; וכן היה עניין יוסף, כי הוא היה ליעקב מרחל - שהיתה היותר אהובה אצלו - אחר היאוש, ולזה היתה נקשרת אהבתו בו</p>\n<p>(רלב\"ג)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Radak suggests that בן זקונים הוא לו refers to Yosef having the wisdom characteristic of elders.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי היה מוצאו חכם בכל דבריו, כמו אם היה זקן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=479&hilite=\">Ramban</a> is bothered by this as well, and makes the question stronger - the shevatim were not born that far apart from each other and really all of them could be a son of old age.</p>\n\n<p>Rather he explains it as a son who serves the father in his old age, not who was born in the father's old age. The other brothers were off shepherding (and Binyomin was presumably too young) so Yosef was the one who was constantly around looking after his fathers needs, and this increased contact created the special bond between them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Sifsei Chachamim asks this question and answers that all the sons until Yosef were born within six years, whereas Binyamin wasn't born till many years later. As such, in the family dynamics, Yosef was the Ben Zkunim and was called this even after Binyamin was born, out of habit. </p>\n\n<p>The Gur Aryeh seems to be the source for this and explains further that when Yosef was born Yaakov already seemed old, and he thought he wouldn't have more children so Yosef was treated in this regard. Then, by the time Binyamin was born, the strong ties of this special love between Yaakov and Yosef were already in place. And he adds, being seven years younger than Yosef, he never was able to impress Yaakov with his wit, being only ten at the time of this narrative. </p>\n\n<p>This same idea is found in the Mizrachi as well. </p>\n\n\n",

I like the distinction suggested above -- that mi shebeirakh is a communal prayer and therefore should be more inclusive than the ones for whom one prays privately in one's Amidah. Even so, the practice of pruning the communal list every Rosh Hodesh is a good one, at least to make sure that some people on the list are still alive and sick.  I also think that one should at least have some personal connection to the people for whom one is praying in the Amidah.  That said, I don't stop until the person gets well or dies.

(Combine this with what was said in @DoubleAA's comment above - he doubted that what his wife said was true.) </p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra seems to say (I'm not <strong>totally</strong> sure but my best understanding) that בית הסהר and מִשְׁמָר are synonymous within this context.</p>\n\n<p>However, the term מִשְׁמָר means \"under observance\", and doesn't necessarily refer to the name of a physical place. סהר is an unusual word, which does not seem to havea Hebrew counterpart, and these are the only places in Tana\"ch where this term is used. Ibn Ezra on verse 21, says, specifically that since it doesn't appear to be Lashon Hakodesh, the Torah explicitly describes what it is by stating \"the <strong>place</strong> where the king's prisoners are imprisoned\". So, in short, בית הסהר means \"prison\".</p>\n\n<p>As for question #2, see @Shalom's answer to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/49193/what-was-the-main-job-duty-of-sar-hatabahim\">this question</a>, asked yesterday. According to Ramban, שַׂר הַטַּבָּחִים was the chief executioner. If so, it makes sense that he is in charge of the jail!</p>\n\n\n",

He also explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>על דעת וכו' - היינו אע\"ג דבשעה שהזכיר שם ומלכות שהוא עיקר הברכה היה דעתו על ברכה שאינה ראויה לאותו המין כלל אפ\"ה כיון שחתימת הברכה הזכיר בפיו כהוגן יצא בדיעבד:</p>\n<p>[quoting...] - That is even though at the time he said Shem and Malchus [i.e. ברוך ... העולם] which is the main part of the B'racha his intention was for a B'racha which is not relevant for that \"type\" at all - even so - since he ended the B'racha by actually saying what was proper, he fulfills his obligation (בדיעבד).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it turns out that even if you pick up your pasta and somehow think it's water and have intention to say Shehakol, but then realize your mistake and end correctly - you fulfill the obligation. In your case, which appears to be even better (after all, you were just \"spazzed\" as you said in your comment), the same should apply.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: I'm tempted to say that cases #4 and #5 are the same, but I'm still working on it... Will edit in later if I find something...</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So on my first read of the question, I was assuming that everything above was going on in his mind and the only thing he actually said was ברוך ... העולם and then stopped.</p>\n<p>However, if that point is passed, timing is critical. He must correct himself within a timestamp that is known as \"תוך כדי דיבור\". However, if he does accomplish that time span, he can correct himself even after reciting the <em>entire</em> B'racha.</p>\n<p>In other words, as is explicitly said in the Mechaber (in 209:2):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לקח כוס של שכר או מים ובירך ברוך אתה ה' אלהינו מלך העולם בורא פרי הגפן ותוך כדי דיבור נזכר שטעה ואמר שהכל נהיה בדברו וכך היתה אמירתו ברוך אתה ה' אלהינו מלך העולם בורא פרי הגפן שהכל נהיה בדברו יצא.</p>\n<p>If someone took a cup of beer or water and said the entire B'racha of ברוך ... הגפן and then \"Toch K'dei Dibbur\" remembered and said \"שהכל נהיה בדברו\" so that the entirety of his speech was: \"ברוך אתה ה' אלהינו מלך העולם בורא פרי הגפן שהכל נהיה בדברו\" he has fulfilled his obligation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Toch K'dei Dibbur\" is a time period, which The Laws of Brachos (by Rabbi Forst) says is somewhat less than 3 seconds. [The actual meaning is the time it takes to say Shalom Alecha Rebi (Mishna Berurah 206:12. However, the Taz 206:3 adds U'mori).]</p>\n<p>Another important note: All the above seems to specifically apply to standard (i.e. virtually all) B'rachos which are only מדרבנן. A notable exception would be ברכת המזון which - if one eats his fill - is מדאורייתא.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do women need to cover their hair if they have had children without being married?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Do women need to cover their hair if they have had children without being married?</p>\n\n<p>Some explanations for hair covering relate it to modesty in light of the supposed attractive power of hair, which would imply that she only needs to cover it if she is actually married to someone (or has been married and therefore obliged to cover).</p>\n\n<p>However, other explanations have to do with virginity and/or public presumptions of virginity. According to these, one imagines any woman with children would have to cover.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there may be a concern in this case of ma'arit ha-ayin for not covering.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are two halachic concepts -- hair as <em>erva</em>, and a married woman's obligation to cover. If hair is <em>erva</em>, why is uncovering okay before a woman gets married? Numerous poskim (Ben Ish Chai, Aruch HaShulchan, Rav Moshe Feinstein) all suggested that this definition of <em>erva</em> is subjective, and no one is shocked by a single woman with uncovered hair.</p>\n\n<p>If so, why do poskim prefer (though there's leeway in many situations) that a widow continue to cover her hair? Either that's simply the norm that evolved, or once the obligation to cover kicked in, it remains in effect (or alternatively, the obligation to cover turns it into a sort of <em>erva</em>) -- there are mp3s on yutorah where Rabbis Broyde and Willig address this issue.</p>\n\n<p>I've never heard any contemporary posek suggest that non-covering had anything to do with virginity -- and actually, I find that quite offensive.</p>\n\n<p>Many divorcees and widows have heterim to uncover their hair, for job or shidduch reasons. This would <em>certainly</em> apply here. But putting that aside -- <em>if</em> it could be argued that societal norms treat a \"mom's\" hair as <em>erva</em>, then maybe you could argue that she should cover. I can't think of any other reason why she should cover, though. (Now if all her friends at parent teacher conferences, including the divorced ones, cover their hair, it might be helpful for her to do so too as far as school standards or not sticking out. But I can't see any halachic argument, other than erva vis-a-vis norms.)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It seems from the Tiztz Eliezer that one would not be required(However,see the Shevus Yaakov).</p>\n\n<p>שו\"ת ציץ אליעזר חלק טו סימן נה ד\"ה הנה הא </p>\n\n<p>הנה הא גם בספרי שם הא כתוב דמההיא דשמואל אין ראיה לדבר כי אם זכר לדבר בלבד, ויעוין בספרי דבי רב שם שמבאר שלהכי הוא רק זכר לדבר בלבד, כי י\"ל דמה ששמה ידה על ראשה לא היה זה אלא דרך צער ויגון ממה שאירע לה עם אחיה, ע\"ש, ויתר על כן ראיתי בפי' כתר כהונה על הספרי שמבאר, דמה שאמרו זכר לדבר לפי שמשורת הדין לא היתה תמר נצרכת לאותו דבר שבבעולה שלא בנשואין כשנבעלת בזנות ליכא בה איסור פריעת ראש מן התורה לדעת כמה מהפוסקים בלתי דעת השבו\"י ועוד מהאחרונים שפסקו לאסור אף באנוסה ואין דבריהם מוכרעים לדינא עיין שם. </p>\n\n<p>ואמנם בשו\"ת שבות יעקב ח\"א סי' ק\"ג מביא באמת הוכחה לאיסור אפילו בבעולה מזנות מההיא דתמר שהספרי לומד משם לכיסוי ראשן כדיעו\"ש. אבל מדהש\"ס דילן לא הביא מזה י\"ל דהוא משום דסבירא ליה כנז' דבאנוסה אין איסור, וזה שתמר שמה ידה על ראשה היה זה משום צער ויגון בלבד וכנ\"ל, ואפי' לפי הספרי ג\"כ י\"ל שאין המכוון בהרמז כי אם על הנשואות וכפי שראיתי בספר ערך שי על אה\"ע סי' כ\"א שכותב לבאר (דלא כהשבו\"י) דהזכר לדבר הוא על נשואה, (ועפ\"י הפ\"מ ח\"א סי' ל\"ה), מפני דתינח אם נשואה אינה הולכת בגילוי ראש יסברו שהיא נשואה (ולא יוודע שזנתה), לכן מדתמר כסתה ראשה כדרך האנוסות שמכסין ראשם כדי שיסברו שהיא נשואה יש זכר לדבר דנשואה לא תלך בגילוי ראש עיין שם, ואכ\"מ להאריך עוד. </p>\n\n<p>There is more on this discussion with a lot of material that seems to come out with the same conclusion but inserts opinions which disagree.see here for more.</p>\n\n<p>פתחי תשובה על שולחן ערוך אבן העזר הלכות אישות סימן כא סעיף ב</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Making restitution for a \"missing\" ox: a question on the Mishna",
    "content": "# Making restitution for a \"missing\" ox: a question on the Mishna\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are four classes of people who are entrusted with items of value (Bava Metzia 7:8, Shevuot 8:1): one who looks after it as a favour, one who does so for a fee, one who borrows it and one who pays money to rent/hire it. Of these four, the one who looks after it as a favour to the owner is the least responsible for what subsequently happens to it, but his having been entrusted with it still denotes <em>some</em> responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna (Shevuot 8:3) discusses a case in which a man's ox is being looked after as a favour, but when the owner asks to get it back the guardian swears that it went missing. Witnesses are brought and it is demonstrated that the guardian had actually eaten the ox, making him liable to the owner for the ox's value. Such is <em>not</em> the case if the witnesses testify to his having \"stolen\" the ox, in which case he is liable to the owner for twice the ox's value, in accordance with the laws of making restitution for theft. Should they testify that he not only stole the ox but that he also slaughtered it, he is liable to the owner for five times the ox's value.</p>\n\n<p>These laws are discussed in more detail in Bava Qama 7 (and a similar scenario is brought in Bava Qama 9:7-8), but the circumstances in this particular mishna are strange to me. A guardian who is discovered to have eaten the ox is liable for the principal only, while one who is discovered to have \"stolen\" the ox and to have slaughtered it is liable for five times that amount. My question is: how is the consumption of somebody else's ox not in itself an act of theft?

    "content": "# Do those who do become religious after a divorce need to cover their hair (women) or wear a tallis (men)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A reason that I propose for why divorced women continue to cover their hair and divorced men continue to wear a tallis (a phenomenon whose existence I vouch for) is that taking on a mitzvah (with the intention to keep it going) is seen as making a vow(1), and so we do not roll back that action. In general, it seems there is a Jewish philosophy that observance may be increased, but never decreased(2).</p>\n\n<p>In modesty this reason is obvious to me: something that becomes ervah cannot later become not-ervah. So we do not roll back our increases in modesty in particular.</p>\n\n<p>My question is this: if a woman becomes a baalat teshuva after being divorced, must she cover her hair (as she never did before)? If a man becomes a baal teshuva after being divorced, must he wear a tallis (as he never did before)? If so, how does that square with my assumptions above?</p>\n\n<p>(1)\nSource: A text I have seen used by some for Hataras Nedarim on Erev Rosh Hashana includes as a vow to be annulled:</p>\n\n<p>\"...אוֹ  אֵיזֶה דָבָר טוֹב שֶׁנָהַגְתִּי שָׁלשׁ פְּעָמִים וְלֹא הִתְנֵיתִי שֶׁיְהֵא בְּלִי נֶדֶר...\"</p>\n\n<p>I posit that this applies even to obligatory acts.</p>\n\n<p>(2)\nAs my source, consider these quotations of text:<br>\n\"The Talmud in Tractate Shabbat relates that the academy of Hillel advocates lighting the candles as we know today, in ascending order. The academy of Shamai disagreed and argued that we light the Chanukah candles starting with eight candles on the first night, then seven candles on the second night. This method continues in descending order, so each night has one less candle than the preceding night.\n“Each viewpoint has either a model from the Torah or a logical argument to support their opinion.” Beit Hillel applies “a general rule that is followed in many areas of Torah: “One increases in matters of holiness, and does not diminish” “Maalin Ba’Kodesh ve’ayn Moridin.” </p>\n\n<p>Halacha follows Beit Hillel, and this is why we light increased candles every day.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Tallis -- this is easy. The halachic default is that everyone 13 and up should be wearing a Tallis; Ashkenazi never-married-men happen to have a custom otherwise. (Rabbi Meiselman, for instance, feels this whole custom is in error and his unmarried sons wear tallisos.) In absence of such a custom, we default to the standard -- wear a Tallis.</p>\n\n<p>Hair covering -- practically, this is going to be difficult for many baalei teshuva, and most poskim will tell her to not cover, it will increase her likelihood of meeting a guy. But theoretically, whether the reason for covering post-marriage is societal norm, or erva generated by the obligation, it would apply here. The fact that she wasn't cognizant of that obligation, or never addressed it, doesn't make it not exist. Basically I challenge your premise that it's about a neder. I've never heard anyone suggest that.</p>\n\n\n",

There are footnotes to sources, as well. Excerpts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another aspect of “holiness” when saying a bracha is that a man is\nrequired to have a “separation between his heart and his lower body.”\nThis typically requires no special attention, as <strong>it is accomplished by\nwearing a belt, pants or underwear</strong>. However, if a man is at home\nwearing just a bathrobe, he would need to tie the robe’s belt, in\norder to create a separation between the heart and lower body.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although, not directly addressing your question, I've included the next paragraph for general interest. If it's unuseful, comment or you may edit my answer and delete it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It\nis improper to say a bracha with one’s top half uncovered, unless\nthere is no realistic option. Joe is sitting at the beach in his\nbathing suit and wants to say a bracha on a nice cold drink. This is\npermitted, since his private parts are covered by a bathing suit,\nwhich also acts as a separation “between his heart and lower body.” If\npossible, Joe should use a towel or t-shirt to also cover his upper\nhalf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the 2nd quote discusses the bracha aspect, if you were sitting on a public beach this way, you're prob. not dressed <em>tzniut</em>ly, anyway, so I would recommend waiting to make a bracha until you are.</p>\n\n\n",

The image, <em>below</em>, highlights the word <a href=\"http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?cscs=Tts&sstr=0&strongs=H411&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>הָאֵל</strong></a> in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%204%3A42&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut 4:42</a> in yellow. The upper red arrow indicates the note in the margin, or \"<a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10465-masorah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">small Masorah</a>,\" and the lower red arrow indicates the wider reference in List 119 of the \"<a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10465-masorah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">large Masorah</a>.\" </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VOagQ.jpg\" alt=\"Devarim 4:42\"></p>\n\n<p>In the left margin the reader will find written in Aramaic: \"ח̇ לשון חול,\" which translated means \"[appears] 8 times indicating the profane [or non-sacred] meaning.\" The lower red arrow points to a reference at the foot of the page, which indicates List 119 in the \"<a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10465-masorah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">large Masorah</a>.\" Unlike the \"<a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10465-masorah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">small Masorah</a>,\" which was a mere margin note, the \"<a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10465-masorah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">large Masorah</a>\" was the Masoretic \"index\" at the top or bottom margins of the codex and/or end of the Torah with explicit verse references in the Hebrew Bible. In this example, List 119 is apparent. According to Weil (2001), List 119 of the \"<a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10465-masorah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">large Masorah</a>\" lists the following eight passages as follows:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KqQQw.jpg\" alt=\"List 119\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>  **NOTE:** The Masoretes did not use Book, Chapter, and verse numbers; instead,\n  they used snippets of verses, which suggests that the Masoretes recognized verses\n  in the Hebrew Bible by just seeing a few words. The Book, Chapter, and verse\n  numbers in the image, *above*, were therefore provided by Weil (2001) for English-\n  speaking readers.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thus when the reader sees the \"<a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10465-masorah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">small Masorah</a>\" and the comment about \"vulgar meaning,\" and then the reader sees the eight corresponding verses of the \"<a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10465-masorah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">large Masorah</a>,\" the obvious inference is to Gentile-controlled land. Thus the Masoretes viewed the three cities of refuge east of the Jordan River as residing in \"vulgar\" (non-holy) land.</p>\n\n<p>This perspective from the Masoretic Text is in precise agreement with the Babylonian Jewish Talmud. In commentary concerning the cities of refuge found in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makkot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkot</a>, which is the fifth volume of the book of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nezikin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nezikin</a>, we read the following according to the translation provided by Rodkinson (1918):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>MISHNA V.: Whither are they to be exiled? To the cities of refuge, three of which are situated on the other side of the Jordan and three in the land of Cana’an. As <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nu%2035%3A14&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numb. 35:14</a>: “Three of these cities shall ye give on this side of the Jordan, and the three other cities shall ye give in the land of Cana’an.” However, until the latter three were selected, those on this side of the Jordan have not protected as yet; as it reads <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nu%2035%3A13-14&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numb. 35:13-14</a>: “six cities of refuge,” which means none of them protects unless all the six are selected. (<em>Makkot 2:5</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This citation from the Talmud indicates that the “six cities of refuge” were part of the Land of Promise, otherwise without “six” cities, the concept of the cities of refuge is incomplete. Moses said “six” cities (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nu%2035%3A13-14&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numb. 35:13-14</a>). That means theses cities of refuge were in the Land of Promise.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, both the Jewish Talmud and the Masoretic Text are drawing a distinction between the following two verses:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2015%3A18&version=KJV;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 15:18</a></strong> (KJV)<br>\n  In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This passage, and many others in the Hebrew Bible, make explicit reference to the river Euphrates as the eastern border of the Land of Promise. However, the following verse does <strong><em>not</em></strong> make explicit mention to the river Euphrates. Thus ambiguity exists.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2023%3A31&version=KJV;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Exodus 23:31</strong></a> (KJV)<br>\n  And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moses did <strong><em>not</em></strong> make an explicit reference to the Euphrates River; the ambiguity in the above verse therefore points not to the river Euphrates, but to the river Jordan. <strong><em>The conclusion is that the land between the river Jordan and the river Euphrates was going to remain unconquered \"Canaan\" territory.</em></strong> In other words, the three cities east of the river Jordan lay in this \"vulgar\" land (between the two rivers) notwithstanding that the “six cities of refuge” were part of the Israelite nation at the time of Moses and Joshua, which is the context of <strong><em>this</em></strong> verse. </p>\n\n<p>This nuance is the Biblical concept of \"already/not yet\" -- the Land of Promise (as far as the river Euphrates) was <strong><em>already</em></strong> promised, but it was <strong><em>not yet</em></strong> to be conquered. Thus there is the nuance in the Masoretic Text (and the Jewish Talmud) that \"these cities\" (<strong>הֶעָרִים הָאֵל</strong>) as noted in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%204%3A42&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut 4:42</a> are in \"vulgar\" territory. It is not that the cities are profane, but that the land between the river Jordan and the river Euphrates is called Canaan, and therefore is \"vulgar,\" because the land is unconquered in its entirety.</p>\n\n<p>Thus the Masoretic Text \"defends\" the appearance of the word <strong>הָאֵל</strong> in this verse. As noted in the image, <em>below</em>, the Masoretes may have been aware of variants in this verse, which do not use the word <strong>הָאֵל</strong>, but another common synonym in the Hebrew Bible, <strong>הָאֵלֶּה</strong>. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7U7wD.jpg\" alt=\"הָאֵלֶּה\"></p>\n\n<p>We see the red arrow pointing to comments from the editors of the <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblia_Hebraica_Stuttgartensia\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</a></em>, which is written in abbreviated language which states the following: \"Read with suspicion:  <a href=\"http://www.facsimile-editions.com/en/kb/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Kennicott Bible</a> (and related manuscripts), <a href=\"http://bible.zoxt.net/ginz2/ginz2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Ginsburg Bible</a>, and <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/3110092581\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Samaritan Pentateuch</a> read “הָאֵלֶּה” – also, Deut 7:22 (note a) and Deut 19:11 (note c).\" That is, these other versions of the Hebrew Bible relied on various sources, which indicated the more common “הָאֵלֶּה” reading. As already noted in the above discussion, the Masoretes quarantined the word <strong>הָאֵל</strong> by associating the word in List 119 of the \"<a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10465-masorah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">large Masorah</a>\" with the implicit reference to Gentile-controlled land. Again, the Babylonian Talmud confirms the Masoretic Text (or perhaps, was it <em>vice-versa</em>? -- that is, did the Masoretes record what they had understood as oral Jewish traditional as found in the Talmud?)</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>The Masoretic Text ascribes the word <strong>הָאֵל</strong> (which carries the definite article) to non-sacred uses in the Torah; that is, in every instance in the Torah, this word appears in the context of the Gentile-controlled lands, which are \"vulgar\" (non-sacred). Thus, when the Masoretes grouped these eight appearances of <strong>הָאֵל</strong> in the Torah under the rubric of \"indicating the profane,\" the Masoretes appear (<em>a</em>) to affirm that the word <strong>הָאֵל</strong> is the original and therefore <strong>CORRECT</strong> reading of the passage of <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%204%3A42&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut 4:42</a>; and (<em>b</em>) the \"non-sacred\" association of this word suggests that the three cities east of the Jordan lay in \"vulgar\" territory. The Babylonian Talmud confirms the same, because the Talmudic comments make explicit that although these cities lay in \"Canaan\" (vulgar territory), they were still part of the Land of Promise, otherwise the concept of the \"cities of refuge\" would have no meaning unless understood as a <strong><em>unit</em></strong> of six cities in the Land of Israel. And, finally, according to the later narrative of the Hebrew Bible, the complete cleansing of the Land of Promise (as far as the river Euphrates) still awaits its future fulfillment.</p>\n\n<h1>ADDENDUM</h1>\n\n<p>This addendum addresses questions and concerns annotated in comments section following this post.</p>\n\n<p>First and foremost, the following excerpt (<em>below</em>) provides the correct explanation of the nuance of \"profane\" in discriminating between <a href=\"http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?cscs=Tts&sstr=0&strongs=H411&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>הָאֵל</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?cscs=Tts&sstr=0&strongs=H410&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>אֵל</strong></a>, which is the divine name. Please note the mention of Mm 119, which is the reference to the \"Large Masorah\" (Masorah magna, or Mm) List 119.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bEdG9.png\" alt=\"Excerpt\"></p>\n\n<p>The discussion that follows (and what has preceded) does <strong>NOT</strong> contradict this view, but complements this view with additional information.</p>\n\n<p>For example, one recent question (in the comments following this post) was that, if the interpretation to the profane (non-sacred) included the objective sense (as asserted in this posting) then why would the first reference in List 119 of the \"large Masorah\" include angels from heaven? Are angels from heaven \"profane\"?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OIvZN.png\" alt=\"Are angels from heaven included in the summary?\"></p>\n\n<p>When we turn to <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2019%3A8&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 19:8</a>, we see that the word <a href=\"http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?cscs=Tts&sstr=0&strongs=H411&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>הָאֵל</strong></a> modifies the word for men, which is <a href=\"http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?cscs=Tts&sstr=0&strongs=H582&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">לָאֲנָשִׁים</a>. When we look at the Masoretic Text, we notice additional information annotated in the margin (\"small Masorah\") for <strong><em>that</em></strong> word. Please click <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/gen19amplification/1/closeup.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>here</strong></a>. The \"small Masorah\" points us to the \"large Masorah,\" which is List 1551.</p>\n\n<p>Before proceeding, the original Masoretic note in the margin indicated that there was only one instance in the Masoretic Text of this word in this particular vowel point order. Please note the Hebrew letter <em>lamed</em> with the dot above, which means \"one instance\" -- please click <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/gen19amplification/lamed/SingleLamed.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, the superscript (number 11), which the editors of the <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblia_Hebraica_Stuttgartensia\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS)</a></em> provided, point to List 1551 of the \"large Masorah\" as already noted <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/gen19amplification/1/closeup.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>When we analyze List 1551 as found in the work by Weil (2001), we see the following on pages 182-183:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AXYCJ.jpg\" alt=\"Large Masorah 1551\"></p>\n\n<p>Please note that the Masoretes had not included the last reference, <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2019%3A8&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 19:8</a>, in this list, but later included the verse as an amendment (which is why Weil placed the verse in brackets). To put it another way, we may make the tentative inference that the purpose of including this verse in Masorah 1551 was to qualify and clarify why the angels from heaven were \"profane.\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, from the perspective of heaven, when these angels took on the form of men on earth, they no longer appeared in their glorious angelic state from heaven. In this relative sense, their bodily glory (compared to their mundane state as men on earth) become \"profane\" in the relative sense. The other verses in this Masorah paint the picture that, in the subjective sense, the angels were not profane any more than the Israelites noted in several of these verses, but in the objective sense, they were \"profane\" because they took on the form of man on earth.</p>\n\n<p>In closing, the most obvious understanding of the \"profane\" (with reference to the \"large Masorah\" List 119) are to discriminate between <a href=\"http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?cscs=Tts&sstr=0&strongs=H411&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>הָאֵל</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?cscs=Tts&sstr=0&strongs=H410&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>אֵל</strong></a>, which is the divine name. However, while this hermeneutic is not incorrect, the fuller nuanced meaning of \"profane\" appears to lie in other references from the Masorah of the Masoretic Text and to the Mishnah within the Jewish Talmud (regarding the location of the three cities east of Jordan in \"profane\" Canaan).</p>\n\n<p><strong>REFERENCES:</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Rodkinson, M.

In other words, there is 4 cubits, \"daled\n  amot\" for 600,000 Jews</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Per <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/2713/jewish/The-Hebron-Purchase.htm\">Chabad.org</a> Avraham purchased 600,000 square Amos. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thus, the area purchased by Abraham was eight beit kor, or 600,000\n  square cubits</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Thus it seems that Avraham overpaid by 4 times its real value.</strong></p>\n\n<p>To get an idea of the exorbitant price.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/chaye/spe.html\">Professor Daniel Sperber of Bar Ilan University</a> based on R. Judah (son of R. Simon) ben Pazi the price Avraham paid for the cave of Machpelah was equivalent to 4 million dinars!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As R. Haninah said: Every time shekels are referred to in the Torah it\n  means selas, in the Prophets litra, and in the Writings kintirin.\n  Rabbi Judah bar Pazi said: Except for the shekels of Ephron, which\n  were kintirin. How do we know this? Because it says \"Let him sell it\n  to me, at the full price\" (Gen. 23:9).</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Judah (son of R. Simon) ben Pazi, a famous homilist, belonged to\n  the third-fourth generations of amoraim. According to his remark\n  above, made in the fourth century, the price of the cave of Machpelah\n  was four hundred kintirin. But how much were kintirin worth? This is a\n  known coin, the centenarius (see Sperber, Roman Palestine 200-400,\n  Money and Prices, 1974, p. 166) worth around 10,000 dinars. Thus, it\n  follows from his remark that the price of the cave of Machpelah was 4\n  million dinars!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalman_Sorotzkin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Sorotzkin</a> compares it to the 100 kesitah that Yaakov paid for the land in Shechem on which to settle himself, his family and his flocks. IIRC, Rabbi Sorotzkin says that a kesitah was a quarter of a shekel (.25). Thus, 400 shekel was 1600 kesitah.</p>\n\n<p>This means that Avraham paid 16 times what Yaakov did for just the burial cave. Of course, Efron \"included\" the field that the cave was in even though Avraham only wanted the cave and the field was useless for his purpose. Rav Hirsch and others say that Efron claimed that the field would no longer be of use to him once the cave was used as a burial site. Thus he insisted that the field go along with the cave.</p>\n\n<p>I would use an analogy as buying an entire cemetary in order to be able to use one plot.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, Rabbi Sorotzkin compares this to the area that Yaakov bought in Shechem which was large enough to support the entire family with its flocks. This means providing living space, pasture lands, and (at least) the kitchen gardens that they needed. At the very least, it would be a complete working sheep farm in modern day terms.</p>\n\n<p>Thus Rabbi Sorotzkin says that Avraham paid 16 times for a single field  what Yaakov did for a complete farm and pasture lands. He says this was definitely a case of price gouging.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Sorotzkin says from the descriptive language used in the two cases, one can tell that the field was just a small field with the cave at the end. Otherwise different language to describe it would have been used</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Etshalom in 5773 suggested that Avraham actually did not pay for the field. Ephron \"adopted\" him as a member of his clan, who was therefore \"entitled\" to bury Sarah. Avraham paid the money as the price for the formal \"adoption\" into the clan. That is why the exchange had to be done before the council of the Bnai Cheis. Land could only be transferred to members of the clan and adoption into the clan required a formal procedure. Unfortunately, the link is currently broken so that I cannot copy the citation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I remember hearing a <em>shiur</em> by R' Dovid Gottlieb (I think it was <a href=\"http://www.dovidgottlieb.com/Rabbi_Gottlieb_Tapes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Historical Verification of the Torah - Standards & Prophecy\"</a>) where he explains that it was indeed the normal price, and that the back-and-forth regarding the sale was normal courtesy at the time.</p>\n\n\n",

So at this point Haman and the king know that Mordechai is a Jew.</p>\n\n<p>Mordechai then spends a while hanging around the city gate communicating with Esther and urging her to plead for her people.</p>\n\n<p>But later, when Esther pleads directly for her people, the fact that Haman's decree would have targeted Esther seems to come as a surprise to Achashverosh.</p>\n\n<p>If the court functionaries knew that Mordechai and Esther were related then it would seem that the secret would already be blown.  But if they didn't know there was a connection, wouldn't the communication between Esther and Mordechai arouse suspicion?</p>\n\n<p>Did they know they were related but they kept the secret from the king, or did they not know?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51099&st=&pgnum=21http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51099&st=&pgnum=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi on Esther 8:1</a>. In short, Achashverush did not know the relationship until Esther told him at that point. </p>\n\n<p>As for the officers - <strong>very</strong> interesting question. After Mordechai tells Esther about the decree, Esther uses Hasach, who, apparently was a servant of Esther rather than Achasverush, at least directly. He's relaying messages between Esther and Mordechai that include Mordechai's message in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51099&st=&pgnum=16\" rel=\"nofollow\">Esther 4:14</a>, where he says, \"If you keep silent .. <strong>you and your father's household</strong> ... and who knows if it was for this reason that you were made queen\".</p>\n\n<p>At the least, Hasach obviously discovers that Esther is Jewish - something Achashverush didn't know. (It seems that Hasach is <strong>very</strong> loyal to Esther in keeping this secret from the king!) Mordechai does not state anything about his relationship to Esther when he says \"your father's house\" or by stating the question as to why she became queen. However, <strong>perhaps</strong> since this is stated so personally, maybe Hasach suspected, at the least, that somehow Mordechai was related to Esther, esp. since they are having such a \"personal\" conversation?

You may need to do this a few times until the strap develops its own \"fold\" so it \"knows\" it's there (like new shoes, l'havdil. You have to \"break them in\".)</p>\n\n<p>I hope the written description hasn't confused you. If I can get pics, I'll try to edit this.</p>\n\n\n",

As a result, the Torah does not refer to them specifically as one of the kinds of being that could have kosher representatives.

    "content": "# Violating Shabbos for a suicide emergency\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Y'all should know by now that we violate Shabbos to preserve human life. If you're still not sure, see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1596\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 328</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/3102.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam, Hilchot Shabbos 2</a> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/935201\" rel=\"noreferrer\">English</a>), and a few other sources around.</p>\n\n<p>But, the question remains...what about someone who threatens his own life, by attempting suicide? Do we consider this person to be a sinner, and therefore not save him? Might we say that since this individual has brought danger upon himself on purpose, or at the very least, through negligence, that others would not have the right to violate Shabbos on his behalf?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p><strong>Bottom line on top: you should violate Shabbos for all cases of suicide on Shabbos.</strong> <sup><sub>(R Moshe Feinstein, Tzitz Eliezer); with one (very rare, practically non-existent) exception according to R Shlomo Zalman Auerbach.</sup></sub></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Halevi Spero explores this issue in his article in <em>The Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society</em>,  vol. 3 (Spring 1982). I strongly encourage you to read the article yourself, as it's very interesting and well-written, but I will summarize the main points of the article here to the best of my ability.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The ציץ אליעזר (Rabbi EY Waldenburg) [8:15:4, 9:17:2:14, 10:25:17:13], אגרות משה (Rabbi Moshe Feinstein) [YD 3:90] and many others say that one is allowed to violate שבת both for one threatening suicide, as well as for a \"מאבד עצמו לדעת\" (one who knowingly destroys himself).</li>\n<li><p>However, others (Rabbi SZ Auerbach, חכמת שלמה at 329:1) say that one may <strong><em>not</em></strong> violate Shabbos for the מאבד עצמו לדעת.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>However, even according to these opinions, there is a lot of room to be lenient on Shabbos.</li>\n<li>While one is not allowed to violate Shabbos to save a person from doing a single עבירה, (Rema to <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1596\">Orach Chayim 328</a>:10, and to <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1525\">Orach Chayim 306</a>:14), one is allowed to save someone from being forced into \"perpetual apostacy,\" which could be one result of suicide. If so, then even Biblical prohibitions may be violated for the suicide, if we can compare the state of \"having committed suicide\" to the state of \"perpetual apostacy.\"\n    1. However, it should be noted that there are issues with this comparison; notably, that (per MB 328, this cannot be done with a <em>meizid</em> or <em>posheya</em>. (However, Rabbis Feinstein and Wallenberg make use of this comparison, even for the <em>meizid</em>)</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p>There is a responsum from the Rashba (cited in בית יוסף OC 306), that in the event of a \"מצוה רבה,\" \"great <em>mitzvah</em>,\" such as <em>pikuach nefesh</em> or <em>pikuach dat</em> (=conversion), one may violate Shabbos even for the <em>meizid</em> or the <em>posheya</em>.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Additionally, R Feinstein notes that although one is forbidden from traveling by boat (or undergoing elective surgery) three days prior to Shabbos, if one did so, there would be no problem with saving the person's life, <em>post facto</em>.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>R Spero cites a paper by R Shlomo Y. Zevin, who opined that although <em>refuah</em> is required for one of two reasons (either השבת אבידה, returning a lost object; or לא תעמוד על דם רעיך, the injunction to help a friend in need), even though those reasons may not apply (either due to being an אבידה מדעת, a \"willingly lost object,\" which one is not required to return; or because the suicide is not considered to be \"רעיך,\" due to breaking the rules of Judaism), one still must save this person's life, out of an obligation to prevent prohibitions from being done.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Alternatively, R Zevin suggests that Judais does not consider one to be the owner of his own body, and as such one has no right to destroy it.  </li>\n<li>R Spero offers several other lines of reasoning to circumvent the issue of אבידה מדעת.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>To my mind, the most sweeping היתר of the entire paper is found in section C of the paper. There, R Spero writes that one may only be considered to be a \"מאבד עצמו לדעת,\" \"one who destroys himself <strong>knowingly</strong>,\" when we can verify that he is actually acting with דעת (possibly through עדים והתראה, which are decidedly rare in the event of suicide). The suicide also may be missing the critical element of דעת due to intense pain, depression, or other factors.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An additional argument presented, in answer to the reasoning of labeling the suicide as a \"חוטא,\" is the possibility that he may have done תשובה already. R Spero doesn't draw this comparison, but I think this might be analogous to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=49b&format=pdf\">Kiddushin 49b</a>, where even a \"complete רשע\" who gave money to a woman and married her \"on condition that I am righteous,\" is considered to be married, because \"שמא הרהר תשובה בדעתו,\" \"maybe he had a thought of תשובה.\"</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>From all the above (esp. point 5), it would appear that even according to those that would say that one is forbidden from participating in the saving of the life of the suicide (specifically, the מאבד עצמו לדעת) on Shabbos when doing so would violate Shabbos principles, would allow one to do so, even for the <em>apparent</em> מאבד עצמו לדעת.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>* <em>It should be noted that according to R Waldenberg, one is <strong>not</strong> allowed to violate Shabbos for the suicide where there is definitively no danger to life; however, he would certainly agree that when there is any room to have a concern for danger to life, that violating Shabbos would be allowed and obligatory.</em>  </p>\n\n\n",

This isn't an uncommon scenario — I can think of at least three different instances where this has been reported to happen.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a general sense of what the appropriate thing to do in such scenarios when saving the mother's life is clearly opposed to preserving the potential life of the child? Does the <em>viability</em> of the child affect anything?</p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I'm not Jewish, and most everything I know about Judaism has regrettably been things I learned from a Christian perspective, thanks to my education (something which I'd like to amend).</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>In Judaism (as codified in the earliest of sources - the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9673&st=&pgnum=235\">Mishna Ohalos (7:6)</a> (HT Double AA for the English link)) the mother's life comes first, no matter how late in the pregnancy. Only once the baby is out enough to be considered independent does another Jewish value kick in - we can't pick between the relative importance of one life and another, and can't act to favor one over the other, so we have to let nature take its course.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why this is the case is somewhat of a debate in subsequent authorities. I'll give you the Rambam's reasoning (which many contemporary Halachic deciders view as controlling): The mother is acting in self defense, and self defense is always a justification for taking another life. Once the baby is out to a certain point, then they could be viewed as jeopardizing each other, so we can't pick one over the other. (That last sentence is a little bit of interpolation as the Rambam isn't exactly clear what changed, but that is one way to understand him).</p>\n\n<p>A much more complicated question is can the mother choose to anyway forgo such treatments (i.e. is she obligated to save herself). As a general principle one is not allowed to refuse all medical treatment and just let a disease take its course, however in a real case like this there are a lot of competing factors (how effective will treatment be, the mother's mental state about the situation, the possibility that it won't be fatal to the baby but will be damaging, the fact that sitting back and doing nothing is easier to justify than acting in a specific direction, etc.), and that would require a real case-by-case analysis of the situation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>@Yishai explained the practical course one should take. I want to fill in some alternative Halachik views.</p>\n\n<p>According to some Halachik authorities, one is allowed to sacrifice one's life to save another's. The mother <em>may</em> therefore choose to decline treatment in order to save the life of her unborn baby. This, of course, would be contingent on the child being expected to survive. </p>\n\n<p>More likely, the actual case contained uncertainties. The treatments may or may not damage or kill the fetus. The mother may or may not be able to deliver the baby and then commence treatments (I know of such a case; both survived). The mother's probability of survival <em>with</em> treatments might be very low. To quote, \"The only certainty about the future is that the future is uncertain.\"</p>\n\n<p>In such a case, one might find room to enable the mother to choose her preferred course of action. It is accepted that one may <em>risk</em> their life in order to save another's. This is subject to extensive debate on the mitzvah of <em>lo saamod al dam reyacha</em> - do not stand idly while another is killed. While the authorities disagree, they all permit one to take a risk to save another's life. How else could we allow security guards, life guards, or a host of other potentially dangerous jobs? The authorities disagree on the degree of risk one may take for another. Some permit even a major risk if one so desires to take it. </p>\n\n<p>Just to be totally clear, ALL halachik authorities permit the mother to save her life at the expense of the fetus, even in case where the danger to the mother is uncertain. And of course, one should consult with a competent Rabbinic authority before making such major decisions.</p>\n\n\n",

Shulchan Aruch HaRav and the Mishna Brura both pasken this way. So it would seem, לענ\"ד that according to that, since you can say Ata Chonantanu in Ma'ariv in this case, you have to, even according to the other opinion. You could argue and distinguish though - because Ata Chonantanu is not something that Shemona Esrei is repeated over, unlike the case of Mincha Rosh Chodesh, so perhaps Rabbeinu Yona would hold that you don't have to repeat it because of that, even according to the Magain Avraham.</p>\n\n\n",

However, the warning is ambiguous as to whether it refers to a consequence that will inevitably result from eating the tree, i.e. a result already set into the order of nature, or whether it is simply Hashem saying I will make the choice to strike you down in punishment if you do this. The ambiguity arises because of the fluidity of the word כי.</p>\n<p>An additional ambiguity arises in that Hashem does not say in <em>the</em> day you eat you will die, but in <em>a</em> day. If he was warning about a natural consequence, perhaps he meant you may not die at first, but it will draw you in and one day it will kill you. If he meant a penalty, perhaps he was not limiting himself to the man's measure of days -- which may be what Chazal are relying on when they say he was talking in God-days in which one day is a thousand years (see Ps. 90:4). It is also possible for the first interpretation to work according to this possibility too.</p>\n<p>The woman restated God's words as \"lest you die,\" implying she held the interpretation that the warning was about an inevitable natural consequence. The serpent answered with a direct quote from God, adding the word the woman had left out and replaced with \"lest\": \"<strong>die</strong> you will die.\" This doubling of language is common in discussions of penalties (see e.g. Lev. 20). The snake is trying to impress upon the woman that God is not warning you about some law of nature, he is telling you he will punish you. In fact, the snake goes on, he is only being strict about this because he is afraid you will become smart like him.</p>\n<p>The Torah never says the snake lied, and strictly speaking he didn't. The snake simply played on the woman's weakness. He corrected her, and used the credibility he gained to lead her into temptation.</p>\n<p>Nor did Hashem lie or say anything untrue, as the ambiguities outlined above show.</p>\n\n\n",

(Even if we don't know that they tried <em>framing</em> Levi it may have been an innocent mistake, they still may be Rodefim (pursuers) and maybe Levi was justified to kill them).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This scenario - where the two witnesses are trying to cause the death of the defendant, but they will not be the ones to actually commit the murder - directly correlates with the discussion posed by R' Chaim Ozer Grodzinski (Achiezer Chelek 3, Siman 19), who discusses the law of a רודף בגרמא. The Or Sameach (Rotzeach, 1.9) writes definitively that one may kill a רודף בגרמא.</p>\n\n<p>(If may depend on the two rationales given by the Achronim to explain the law permitting one to kill the Rodef. If the purpose is to withhold the perpetrator from transgressing לא תרצח [as is <em>mashma</em> from Rashi Sanhedrin 73a - אלו שמצילין אותן <strong>מן העבירה</strong>], then here it would not be permitted, as the witnesses are not transgressing לא תרצח. However, if the <em>hetter</em> is to save the victim - [alternatively, if the victim has a 'right-to-defend' - הבא להרגך השכם להורגו] which is not related to the לא תרצח, then it would be permitted.)</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Achiezer writes that although false witnesses would come under the category of Roidef, it is considered <em>אינו מבורר</em> until after the Psak Din (from what I understand, this is because we don't know they will be successful in their attempt which is תולה בדעת אחרים. I'm not sure exactly what he means), at which point they are no longer acting within the Redifah and may not be killed. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>dafyomi.co.il</strong> on Ketubot 46 was also asked <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/discuss_daf.php?gid=15&sid=20&daf=46&n=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a similar question</a> and they gave several <em>shitos</em>:<br>\n<sub>(<strong>NOTE</strong>: some overlap with @chortkov2's <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/96754/18474\">answer</a>)</sub></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1) The <strong>Minchas Chinuch</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Minchat_Chinukh.600.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mitzva 600</a>) writes, \"...and all other cases of where the murderer is not given the death penalty such as where he ties the victim in front of a lion, etc. perhaps since the <em>rotzeach</em> cannot be given the death penalty then he cannot be killed as a <em>rodef</em>.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>2) The Machon Yerushalayim edition of the Minchas Chinuch note 1 brings the <strong>Rivash</strong>'s opinion which applies \"<em>rodef</em>\" <strong>even to a <em>grama</em> death</strong> and also brings the Rashba that seemingly argues.</p>\n  \n  <p>3) But the <strong>Achiezer</strong> (1:19:3-4) refers specifically to [false witnesses trying to give you the death penalty] and says that witnesses cannot be called murderers at all since their testifying is not an act clearly identified to all as an attempt to kill, and killing them is forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Question B is a bit confusing. Simple answer to question A: </p>\n\n<p>While on paper it seems like a great idea to kill the false עדים, in fact we can't let him do that, or anyone can kill עדים coming to testify about a murder they committed on the basis that they're false! </p>\n\n<p>And furthermore, even if in the end these dead עדים were found to be false, we still cannot absolve Levi, because if it was not God's will for him to die, the עדים would've been found false or we would've found עדים to back Levi. So while it looks good in theory, we can't be expected to trust Levi that he 'knew' that these עדים were false. (we do not trust the one in court who the matter is about.)</p>\n\n<p>Now an attempt at B:</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above logic, we can assume one cannot kill עדים who are false. thus, although Levi did not kill Yehuda (I'm not so sure about this; in a case where their are עדים who say Reuven killed someone, and we see that person alive, we still might believe the עדים; however let's just assume their are עדים that Yehuda is alive, or some other method we trust.), Levi definitely killed the false עדים and since killing them is forbidden, Levi can still be put to death. (as a side note, if Levi was supposed to be put to death for some other reason, no whether he stays put or kills the עדים he can be put to death. One cannot escape God's will!) Hope this second bit wasn't too confusing.</p>\n\n\n",

Why would a person learn this as opposed to the Mishna Berurah, Aruch HaShulchan or other such works that also deal with the 39 melachos?

Etc.</p>\n<p>Thus his work is extremely comprehensive, full of fundamental principles, in addition to being a classic work of halachic guidelines.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that he only wrote on the first 12 melachos.

    "content": "# How to reconcile a sod the conflicts with the peshat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We have a tradition that the Torah can be learned with four methods: pshat, remez, derush and sod.</p>\n\n<p>It is also known that the pshat (simple meaning) holds true. If so, how then can it be reconciled when the sod (mystical interpretation) is the complete opposite of the pshat?</p>\n\n<p>Is the reconciliation different for each and every case or is there a general rule that one can follow.</p>\n\n<h2>For Example:</h2>\n\n<p>In parshat Veyeshev the brothers bring the coat of yosef to their father Yaakov who says, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8232/jewish/Chapter-37.htm#v=33\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"[It is] my son's coat; a wild beast has devoured him; Joseph has surely been torn up.\"</a></p>\n\n<p>The simple peshat being that Yaakov realized that yosef has been killed. I don't have the exact sources but according to a recent lecture by Rabbi Eli Mansour (<a href=\"http://www.learntorah.com/lt-shiur-details.aspx?id=9015\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.learntorah.com/lt-shiur-details.aspx?id=9015</a>) Yaakov did indeed know that yosef was alive.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The basic principle is discussed in Meseches Chagiga Daf 3:, quoting Koheles Perek 12:</p>\n\n<p>בעלי אספות - אלו תלמידי חכמים שיושבין אסופות אסופות ועוסקין בתורה, הללו מטמאין והללו מטהרין, הללו אוסרין והללו מתירין, הללו פוסלין והללו מכשירין. שמא יאמר אדם: היאך אני למד תורה מעתה? תלמוד לומר: כולם נתנו מרעה אחד - אל אחד נתנן, פרנס אחד אמרן, מפי אדון כל המעשים ברוך הוא, דכתיב +שמות כ'+ וידבר אלהים את כל הדברים האלה. אף אתה עשה אזניך כאפרכסת, וקנה לך לב מבין לשמוע את דברי מטמאים ואת דברי מטהרים, את דברי אוסרין ואת דברי מתירין, את דברי פוסלין ואת דברי מכשירין.</p>\n\n<p>A rough paraphrase goes like this: \"Ba'aley Asufos\" - this phrase refers to Torah scholars who sit in groups and learn Torah. These scholars proclaim thing impure, those scholars proclaim them pure.... Maybe a person will say: How can I learn Torah now (knowing that there is so much disagreement)? The Pasuk in Koheles continues, \"They were given by one shepherd\": One G-d gave them, one leader (Moshe) said them, they come from the mouth of the Master of all things... as it says, (Genesis 20) \"And G-d spoke all of these things\". You, too, open up your ears... and acquire for yourself a heart that can understand [both sides].\"</p>\n\n<p>This Gemarah is one of the foundations to reconciling different opinions, such as the conflicts between Pshat and Sod. A person has to open their ears and mind to be able to hear the arguments of both sides, and see the aspects of truth each one is advancing. Unlike in Halachah, in Parshanus HaMikra there is never a need to come to pshat. The historical question of which approach is technically accurate is besides the point. Both opinions have something valuable to teach us, and we would do well to learn both thoroughly and appreciate the unique insights they have to grant us.</p>\n\n<p>For further information, you can look for information in the related topics: \"eilu v'eilu divrei elokim chaim\" and Machlokes.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Can we really bind people to social contracts?",
    "content": "# Can we really bind people to social contracts?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the ideas I've been struggling to understand are the nature of existence in regard to the idea of social contracts.  For example, a social contract like a constitution seems to bind people to laws within a territorial boundary even if they didn't directly sign a contract.  However, is it really binding?</p>\n\n<p>In the book Philosophy of Jewish Law, the author defines a social contract as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Social contracts are usually understood to be agreements among the\n  inhabitants of a region to abide by certain rules.  Authority to\n  define and enforce those rules is created through the contract: before\n  the contract is concluded people live in a \"state of nature\" in which\n  nobody has moral or legal authority over anyone else, except as the\n  laws of nature provide (however that is interpreted)\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now the author states social contracts are </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>agreements among the inhabitants of a region to abide by certain rules</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If people living within that region didn't sign or agree to the terms of the social contract can they really be bound by the social contract?  I've been attempting to find thinking, if any, on this, or something similar.  At first glance it would seem that a contract cannot bind people who don't sign or agree voluntarily, yet most nations seem to do this at the foundation.  Perhaps I'm missing something.  Can we really bind our children, or our neighbors for that matter, to a national contract they didn't sign?</p>\n\n<p>This article shed light on the nature of contracts in Jewish law but made no mention of social contracts: <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0005_0_04597.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0005_0_04597.html</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>CONTRACT (Heb. חוֹזֶה, ḥozeh), in general law theory a legally binding agreement between two or more parties, in terms of which one\n  party undertakes for the benefit of the other to perform or refrain\n  from a certain act. As such, contract is the main source of the law of\n  *obligations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This definition is in regards to involved parties.  Does that mean then that those who are not directly related as a party are not bound by the contract?  And if so, how does this then relate to the idea of a social contract?  If they are in fact bound by social contracts, by what rationale is this allowed?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I was thinking of the Jews that lived within a country whose laws ran counter to the Torah laws. Are those Jews bound by the laws of that social contract even though they may be immoral from the perspective of Torah's laws?</p>\n\n\n",

However, the Shulcan Aruch says that there is at least one case where you <em>do</em> say <em>b'rachot</em> afterwards. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/44324/472\">This answer to a question about making kiddush on Yom Kippur</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Shulchan Aruch (618:10), however, writes that mention of Yom Kippur should be made in bentching (i.e. say Yaaleh Veyavo) with the reasoning that because one would be bentching anyway and the same paragraph is said in the prayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(SA reference verified by Scimonster -- thanks.)</p>\n\n<p>For those who <em>pasken</em> based on the Rambam, the answer seems to be a clear \"no\".  For those who <em>pasken</em> based on Shulchan Aruch, I make the following argument:</p>\n\n<p>If one is expected to <em>bentch</em> after eating on Yom Kippur -- which he would only do if there were a <em>pikuach nefesh</em> reason to be eating -- then it seems reasonable that he would also say the <em>b'racha</em> beforehand.  (Are there any cases where you <em>bentch</em> but don't say the earlier <em>b'racha</em>, after all?)</p>\n\n<p>If this reasoning applies to forbidden eating on Yom Kippur, then it seems to me that it should also apply to forbidden eating at other times.  It is possible that there is still an exception for stolen food per Sanhedrin 6b (which says you don't make a <em>b'racha</em>); that case would need to be checked for post-talmudic rulings.  But for food forbidden for other reasons (e.g. <em>kashrut</em> issues), this reasoning seems to apply.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Dikduk Q: Rashi and Ibn Ezra on the Sar Hamashkim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the end of Parshas Vayeishev, the Pasuk says the Sar HaMashkim 'Lo zachar es yosef' and 'Vayishkacheihu'. Rashi explains that the dual terminology indicates that he forgot him on that day (the day he was freed) and after that as well.</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra says that 'Lo zachar' means that he didn't <em>mention</em> him, and 'vayishkacheihu' means he forgot him b'lev too.</p>\n\n<p>The Avi Ezri (who explains the Ibn Ezra in many editions of mikra'os gedolos) explains that Ibn Ezra's issue is that the word 'es' can't be used with an intransitive verb. So he instead explains the word zachar as 'verbalize'.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems that IE holds that 'remember' is intransitive, while 'mention' is transitive, and that 'es' indicates an object. I can hear why 'remember' is intransitive--after all, nothing is being done <em>to</em> Yosef. Rather, 'Yosef' is merely a description of the rememberance.</p>\n\n<p>So I have 3 primary questions: </p>\n\n<p>1-What would Rashi say in response?</p>\n\n<p>2-I noticed in the shir shel yom of shabbos we say 'Uch'sil lo yavin es zos'--isn't this comparable to zachar (both are not really 'acting on' the supposed object)--yet it says 'es'?</p>\n\n<p>3-If my understanding of why 'zachar' is intransitive, is 'mention' also intransitive?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Many verbs in Hebrew and English (and, I assume just about every language) have \"combo\" verbs that can be transitive or intransitive, depending on the sentence context. זכר means \"remembered\". </p>\n\n<p>Within the context of the verse you are talking about, assume that we substituted the phrase לא זכר שר המשקים \"The chief \"bartender\" (OK, it's an exaggeration of translating  שר המשקים :-) didn't remember, with just והוא לא זכר leaving out the rest of the verse. This would translate to \"And he didn't remember\". Perfectly good grammatical sentence in Hebrew (and English). So, here, זכר is intransitive.</p>\n\n<p>Now looking at the verse, the end word is וישכחהו. Yes, the word שכח can be both transitive and intransitive as well, depending on context. But, here, they are using a \"compound form\" in a single word, stating וישכחהו - \"He forgot him\", so here, שכח is transitive.</p>\n\n<p>Since the last word means \"He forgot him\", it would be strange normally on its own because we would wonder \"who forgot whom?\" So, at the beginning the verse puts an object ... את יוסף so, the Torah is using the transitive version of זכר, and the word את is an objective marker, in this case, being יוסף .</p>\n\n<p>I too am puzzled by Ibn Ezra's analysis, as he is using the wrong from of the verb זכר, per @Shimon bM's comment.</p>\n\n<p>In answer to your 3 questions:</p>\n\n<p>1 - I don't think Rashi has to answer \"in response\", as I think Ibn Ezra's analysis is faulty in terms of verb use.</p>\n\n<p>2 - \"Yavin\" has a dual transitive and intransitive use, but in the verse you're using, the transitive usage occurs.</p>\n\n<p>3 - See my answer to #1, which would make the answer, here, irrelevant, probably. However, \"mention\" which <strong>should</strong> be translated in Hebrew as הזכיר is transitive.</p>\n\n\n",

To make this decision, he compares what he decided with a similar letter in a completely different pasuk. (Caveat to this, which I'll mention, below.)

However, the Talmud says that if you see someone fall into a pit filled with snakes and scorpions, you could testify that they died (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=33&format=pdf\">Berachos 33a</a>)!</p>\n\n<p>Were the brothers aware that they were throwing him into a pit in which there were snakes and scorpions? If so, in what way was this saving Yosef?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>The Maharal (Gur Aryeh ibid) explains that the Gemara which says that a person will surely die in a pit full of snakes and scorpions is only when it is <em>full</em> of snakes and scorpions, but this pit just had a few.</p>\n\n<p>The Ohr HaChaim explains that the brothers felt Yosef was deserving of death because he had testified falsely about them to their father in matters involving a death penalty to a Ben Noach (Ohr HaChaim to 37:20, s.v. ואם תאמר).  The brothers intended to prove by killing him that his dreams were false and he made things up at will (Ohr HaChaim ibid s.v. ונראה).  Reuvein saved him from them in that he saved Yosef from the hands of those with free will, as one with free will can kill someone even if he does not deserve to die, as opposed to dangerous animals which will only kill someone if they deserve to die.  Thus, the brothers knew there were snakes and scorpions, and this would be the test of if he really deserved to die (Ohr HaChaim 37:21 s.v. ויצילהו). (Reuvein himself did not plan on Yosef dying there, but that he would survive the pit and Reuvein could take him out and save him (Ohr HaChaim ibid s.v. לא).) </p>\n\n<p>The Kli Yakar (to 37:24) says that they specifically wanted to cast him to the snakes, as they considered him to be a slanderer, and a slanderer is sentenced to be punished by snakes, as we find in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9949#v=5\">Bamidbar 21:5</a> and 6, that they spoke badly about Hashem and Moshe and Hashem sent snakes against them (see Rashi there).</p>\n\n<p>The Nefesh HaChaim is cited (Yeshurun Vol. 6) as saying that Reuvein was saving Yosef from being sent out of Eretz Yisrael, and it is better for a person to be in the Land of Israel surrounded by snakes and scorpions than to be sent out of Israel.  In that respect, even though they were aware of the snakes, he was saving him.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban writes that the brothers must not have known about the snakes and scorpions, because had they seen such a miraculous salvation, they would surely have desisted from their plotting against Yosef.  Rather, either the pit was too deep or the scorpions were in the crevices around the sides.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah Temimah explains (h/t Matt) that they did not know that there were snakes and scorpions in the pit, because it was very deep.  For this reason the Gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=22&format=pdf\">Shabbos 22a</a> juxtaposes the halacha that Chanuka candles placed at a height above 20 cubits do not fulfill the mitzvah because they will not be seen with the account that the pit had snakes and scorpions in it to hint that the pit was 20 cubits deep, and they could not see to the bottom of it.  So they did not know about the snakes and scorpions. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to R.

I don't recall the article off-hand, but it was pointed out a non-observant Jew in Israel would never dream of visiting his Ashkenazic Haredi relatives unless he was wearing a <em>kippa</em> during the visit; if visiting Sephardic relatives, he could walk in without a kippa. Thus many Sephardic children are more used to the idea of non-observant Jews, and being somewhat okay with them.

Therefore, we must gather together before we can properly declare Hashem's One-ness.

Example of this - <em>Na'aseh V'nishma</em> - the response B'nai Yisra'el gave upon accepting the giving of the Torah - means, \"We will do, and we will understand\".</p>\n\n<p>Talmud Brachot (don't recall exact page) mentions that the recital of the Shema is comparable to reciting the 10 Commandments. It seems, fair, then to make a parallel interpretation of the word \"Shema\" in \"Shema Yisrael\" as meaning \"Understand, Israel. Hashem ou G-d, Hashem is one.\" I.e. - understand what you are saying, understand what this basic principle means, understand that you are performing a mitzvah, etc. - thre are multiple layers of understanding required while reciting Shema.</p>\n\n<p>Related - the Gemarah Brachot also debates if the recital of Shema is acceptable if one recited it without <em>kavanah</em> - the proper intent. Part of the reason of that debate, from my recollection, emanates from the translation of the word \"Shema\" as \"understand\".</p>\n\n\n",

The Hagahos Ashiri (Chullin 1:2) writes that one may recite the bracha (bedieved) after the shchita as well. This applies only to birkos hamitzvos and not birkos hanehenin. The Rambam (Hilchos Brachos 11) argues and says that even regarding mitzvos one cannot recite the bracha after performing it. The Shach (Yoreh Deah 19:3) sides with the Rambam, and so does the Simlah Chadasha that was quoted before. However, the Pri Chadash writes that even according to the Rambam one may recite the bracha <em>toch kedei dibbur</em> after the shchita. Although Simlah Chadasha (19:2) rejects this, the Beis Dovid (Yesod Habayis 19:1) cites some sources who agree with the Pri Chadash.</p>\n\n<p>An added note - the Rema (19:1) actually rules that when one slaughters an animal of questionable kashrus, that requires checking after the shchita, one may first slaughter the animal without a bracha, and then if the animal turns out kosher one may then recite the bracha.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does one implement \"zachin leadam shelo befanav\" to give a gift on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am aware that we don't give gifts -- or, more specifically, transfer ownership of an item -- on Shabbat or Yom Tov.  I once <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/14462/472\">asked a question about ransoming the afikoman</a> and received this comment:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... That issue can be circumvented, I think, by having a third party accept the gifts on behalf of the intended recipients before Y\"T. This is OK to do without their knowledge because \"zachin le-adam shelo befanav\" - \"we can do unmitigated good for someone without their presence (or knowledge).  – Isaac Moses Feb 20 '12 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand that this is also done when shuls present a <em>bar/bat mitzvah</em> with a gift on Shabbat.  And I have seen the \"<em>kinyan</em> on another's behalf\" approach used recently by somebody who I know to be careful in <em>halacha</em>.</p>\n\n<p>My question is about the logistics: if one wants to effect such a transfer using an agent to accept in advance on another's behalf, what must one do?  Specifically:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Are there any restriction on who the agent can be?</p></li>\n<li><p>Is there any specific declaration text that either the giver or the agent needs to say, or is anything that gets the idea across (\"I am giving this to Ploni\"/\"I accept on Ploni's behalf\") ok?</p></li>\n<li><p>Can this be done for an unnamed person that can be identified later, such as \"the child who presents me with the <em>afikoman</em>\"?</p></li>\n<li><p>Can this be done for unnamed people who <em>aren't</em> identified in advance, such as \"any guests I have for Shabbat lunch\" (maybe you made up something in advance, like <em>bentchers</em> or something to commemorate a <em>simcha</em>)?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>DoubleAA linked <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d7%96%d7%9b%d7%99%d7%9f_%d7%9c%d7%90%d7%93%d7%9d_%d7%a9%d7%9c%d7%90_%d7%91%d7%a4%d7%a0%d7%99%d7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this page from Hebrew Wikipedia</a> in chat; possibly there are answers to be found within, but I can't read it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://doseofhalacha.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/gifts-on-shabbos.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a general overview and various opinions on giving gifts on Shabbos.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>.. the Beis Yosef (OC 527) allows one to give a gift on Shabbos if it will be used for Mitzva purposes. This is the basis for allowing one to give their Lulav and Esrog to another as a gift on the first day (or 2) of Sukkos.</p>\n<p>The Magen Avraham (OC 306:15) question the practice of giving presents to a Chassan who delivers a speech on Shabbos. The Chasam Sofer, (Hagaos Hachasam Sofer OC 306), however disagrees as such a gift serves a Mitzva purpose by giving true kavod to the Torah. The Aruch Hashulchan extends this , allowing one to give wedding presents at the Shabbos Sheva Brachos, as doing so brings Simcha to the Chassan and Kalla; itself a great Mitzva.</p>\n<p>Likewise, R’ Ovadia Yosef (Yechave Daas 3:21) allows giving Bar Mitzva presents on Shabbos (especially Seforim that may be used that day) as they can serve to encourage the boy in his Torah learning and religious lifestyle.</p>\n<p>The Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa (29:29) writes that one who wants to give a gift on Shabbos should give it over to him via a proxy before Shabbos. The proxy acquires it on behalf of the receiver.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we can't trust children to properly give something back (See Kiddushin 19a; Shulchan Aruch 658:6), the proxy needs to be a adult (man or woman).</p>\n<p>There is no specific formula, though the proxy should understand the role that they are serving.</p>\n<p>One cannot perform this in the case of 'whoever finds the afikoman' as it is considered something that does not yet exist (Davar Shelo Ba L'Olam). Being that we typically understand that what dependent children own technically belongs to their parents, it wouldn't be an issue for their parents to give their younger children  a gift on Shabbos or Yom Tov.</p>\n<p>Likewise, it can't be done for unnamed guests, though it may be permissible as it is for mitzva use..</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In short: I want to gift a [whatever] to my friend Yonah (gender-neutral) on Shabbat. So before Shabbat, I go to my friend Simcha (gender-neutral, but over the age of bar/bat mitzva) and say: \"I would like you to acquire this on behalf of Yonah.\" I hand it to Simcha, and Simcha picks up the [whatever] a few inches in demonstration of acknowledgment. The [whatever] now belongs to Yonah.</p>\n\n<p>This is also, by the way, how you put a \"real\" eruv into effect. After you put the string-and-posts around your neighborhood, converting it into one big courtyard, you need to designate some shared food that's available for all the residents. So the rabbi takes a box of matza (it's convenient and nonperishable) and hands it to -- the eruv chairman, the shul president, whoever -- \"please acquire this on behalf of everyone in this area.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does the language in the 13 Midot of Drasha shift?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In shacharit, we recite the 13 middot (already a strange word) through which a piece of Torah text is explained (explicated?) This comes from Braita d'Rav Yishma'el and, admittedly, I haven't look at this in the original; I am basing myself on the text in the Artscroll siddur.</p>\n\n<p>The opening statement introduces the middot and the first item picks up on the language of the introduction saying \"mikal vachomer\" -- FROM a kal vachomer. The second says \"umi'gezeirah shava\" -- and FROM a gezeirah shava.</p>\n\n<p>This makes syntactical sense because the intro said \"these are the ways:\" (paraphrase mine) so he list says \"from x...\"</p>\n\n<p>But at item 6, the list omits the mem (from) so the item is not connected to the introduction. Number 7 resumes the mem but 8-13 do not begin with it. Aside from inconsistency, does this affect the way in which the item is understood or applied to a Torah text? Is it an arbitrary linguistic quirk or does it mean that the middah is used differently or understood as categorically different from the other items?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't think that this is anything more than language / grammar. In the first 5, the rules are stated in noun or \"title\" form - like headlines. It is like saying, \"These are the rules from which we can derive...\"\nFrom A, From B... etc. - They are not describing how these rules work; they are just telling you the name of the rule, and assuming that you know how it works.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning from rule 6 and rules 8-13, they are describing how the rule works. The phrasing is in a style stating - \"something that has these characteristics ...\". It doesn't seem grammatically correct, to follow the pattern of the other ones to start with the \"mem\", because in these cases you are not just using the title form or the name of the rule, on its own.</p>\n\n<p>I can't say why these rules are ordered this way, and there is a break in the pattern with rule 7. I also can't state why titles were used for the other rules without describing them. I surmise that the ones having titles occur more frequently that, perhaps, people understood how they worked so that the title sufficed.</p>\n\n\n",

Why not simply attack if they believe it is the will of God?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Jews has been unable to defeat the Plishtim (besides for Shimshon -- albeit on a microscale) for around 400 years. They had better technology (i.e. iron armor and chariots as evidenced by the posukim), and the \"covenants\" with the forefathers (from the midrash). Moreover, it is not a given that G-d's \"favor\" would have been with them in a pre-emptive strike in general. Furthermore, from a position of logic, if they \"believed\" that G-d was \"with them\" would it not be even easier to simply defeat 1 man (even if he was big)? This is actually exactly the position King David took, by referencing the fact that battle was indeed HaShem's, and that Golyath's provocation may have actually been the reason G-d's favor switched to the Israelite camp.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Besides for the above, King David having previously been anointed King, need a way to become famous. This episode provided a way for him to upstage the current leader and begin that process. This is similar to how Hashem had elders forget (an) element(s) from their Torah knowledge in order for Hillel haZaken to become well-known in his time.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>2)Would they have been halachically bound, had they lost? Could they have ignored the whole thing and still attacked? It would seem from the simple reading of the verses not, but why not?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>It seems that the issue of desecrating G-d's name would have likely obligated them to fulfill their declarations in an open covenant especially if it was agreed upon by a halachic King.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>3)If they couldn't find anyone for several days, why didn't they either decline and propose and alternative or else why didn't the Plishtim count it as a forfeit?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>As stated above the episode serves as a way for King David to become famous and begin his fated ascension to the throne. For the sake of argument, it is likely the Plishtim did not want open war with Saul's newly formed empire, fresh off their defeat of Nachash, King of Ammon. By displaying their best warrior and having no one want to fight, it was a way to shame the entire nation and their new King, and additionaly through Golyath's actions, desecrate G-d's name. The Israelites never formally declined, thus the Plishtim were able to continue on with their shaming etc. possibly creating defavor in the eyes of the nation.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

I know there are many many reprints out there in bookstores, my bookshelf, and websites like <a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.e-daf.com</a>, but that's not what I want. I want to see the pages of a book which was printed in Vilna and came off a 19th century printing press owned by the Romm brothers. Although I would <em>love</em> to see it in person, that's probably impossible so I'll settle for online scans. While images of a page here or there are nice, I'd really like to see a whole masechet or more including all the title pages, commentaries in the back, etc. Any leads?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 25)\n\n<p>Well it took me almost a year, but I can now answer my own question.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In Person</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.nli.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">National Library of Israel</a> has everything (and I mean everything) you could ever want when it comes to Hebrew books. Although they don't allow people to check out their rare books, you can sit in the reading room and read anything in their collection for as long as you like. They have an <a href=\"http://primo.nli.org.il/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=NLI&docId=NNL_ALEPH001300957\" rel=\"noreferrer\">original Vilna shas</a> so I got to sit down with it when I was in Jerusalem this summer. I even took the book selfie to prove it (although I forgot you're apparently supposed to smile in Selfies. I'm new to that). <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5qlRfs.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5qlRfs.jpg\" alt=\"Vilna shas.\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Online</strong> The library had actually done a high res scan of the entire set a number of years ago. However, it was mistakenly marked as being copyrighted and therefore not accessible to outsiders. After talking to a colleague there he managed to get this corrected, and the scan is now <a href=\"http://rosetta.nli.org.il/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE19940954\" rel=\"noreferrer\">available to the public in high res and full color.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why?</strong> I'm sure some people thought it was an odd thing to want - after all there are plenty of reproductions. This scan is much clearer than any of the other scans online. It's also complete - it includes all the stuff in the back like the Rif, the Maharsha, and Rambam's mishnah commentary that aren't found in most online scans which only focus on the Talmud itself. It also answers definitively what is included in each masechet as not all reproductions do that accurately. Many leave out some of the smaller commentaries like Rashash, Maharam Shiff, the mishnah commentaries, the Tosefta, or others. (Also interestingly many volumes had some other commentaries like the Rif bumped off into a separate volume). I can also see what things have been modified by modern publishers unsurprisingly the censor’s stamp I saw in the original is not present in any modern reproduction, and the printer's identity on the cover page is usually photoshopped out. Lastly it's just awesome to hold and look at. Since the original was printed on a real printing press, you can actually see the imprint in the paper where the force of the movable type made indentations in the paper. It's a little piece of Jewish history and as an avowed bibliophile, I'm thrilled to have had a chance just to hold it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dec 2016 - edit to add</strong></p>\n\n<p>Another source for online scans is the Russian National Library, who is <a href=\"http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/143902/moscow-putin-lubavitcher-library\" rel=\"noreferrer\">currently claiming ownership of a part of the Chabad library</a>. They actually have a very good interface for reading and skimming, you just have to be able to navigate the Russian interface. If you want a specific masechet, go to <a href=\"http://search.rsl.ru/en/search#yf=1879&yt=1890&q=%D7%95%D7%95%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this page</a> and add the name of the masechet you want in Hebrew to the search - it should come up. For example, here's a direct link to the <a href=\"http://dlib.rsl.ru/viewer/01006624106#?page=8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">censor's stamp</a> in brachot (something thankfully not present in reprints).</p>\n\n\n",

A. Emerton (182) that the correct rendering should be Litan. In this Ugaritic passage (lines 1-4) Mot alludes to Baal's defeat of Litan as follows, \"Because you smote Litan the twisting serpent, (and) made an end of the crooked serpent, the tyrant with seven heads, the skies will become hot (and) will shine.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The point in Tehillim is that for Hashem, this is not a creature which rivals his power. It is a mere pet, to play with.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>IIRC, the Maharal, in Beer Hagoleh ch. 4, explains that the Leviathan is a symbol for the world's great materialism (as it's an enormous mass of flesh-life), and 'playing' is something that may be a source of enjoyment without fulfilling a need. Thus, God is described as playing with earthly materialism, because He doesn't need anything from His creations. There are other recorded explanations as well: a quick internet search showed me that this passage is discussed by <a href=\"http://www.aspaklaria.info/030_LAMED/%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%9F.htm\">R. Tzadok Hakohen</a> (scroll down) and R. Yonasan Eibshutz in Yaaros Dvash 1:7</p>\n\n<p>If I may offer my own \"פשט על דרך אגדה\", based (somewhat) on ideas that I've heard from R. Moshe Shapiro: the Leviathan is often used by Chazal as a reference to the reward of the righteous in the future (see Bava Basra 74b, and the Targum Yonasan to the verse quoted, Tehillim 104:26). Thus, God's \"daily\" schedule seems to, at least loosely, parallel the efforts of man as well, just on his own field - we are supposed to study the Torah, use the Torah's yardstick as a guide for how we/the world should operate (parallel to judgement), and implement the Torah's values in order to improve the world and the lives of those who inhabit it. After all the 'work', there is 'play'; in the future, the person who has done what he is supposed to do will be rewarded with being able to enjoy 'the meat of the Leviathan'</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe explains this <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/admur/tm/5/16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The playing represents the Supernal enjoyment from souls that connect the world with G-dliness (לויתן related to הפעם ילוה את אישתי - meaning connection), pleasure here meaning to emphasize the novelty of the matter, like the enjoyment one gets from seeing a parrot talking, even though it isn't able to speak as well as a human, the fact that it can speak at all is what causes the enjoyment.</p>\n\n<p>This playing is a continuation of the previous three activities. First is G-d learning Torah - this means coming from above without prompting from below, in contrast to what it says in general that when a person learns Torah G-d learns opposite him - implying G-d's kindness in providing for the world without any deserving action. Then G-d judges the world - finding nothing worthy (compare to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16406#v=18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Job 4:18</a>) and the first activity tempers the second, causing G-d to sustain all of creation with His mercy. All of this is from above, giving to the world. The last part is creation being connected to G-dliness through its own efforts, which is the ultimate purpose and creates that enjoyment.</p>\n\n\n",

Was Pharaoh's displeasure a miracle from Hashem, or is there a logical way of understanding Pharaoh's displeasure with that interpretation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The <em>Y'fe Soar</em> (commentary to the <em>Midrash Raba</em> 89:6) explains that Pharaoh saw the interpretation of the dream in the dream itself but forgot it. Since this interpretation didn't remind him of the one he'd seen, he knew it was wrong.</p>\n\n<p><em>Y'de Moshe</em> (commentary to the <em>Midrash Raba</em> there) explains that this interpretation didn't fit the dream very well, to Pharaoh's thinking. Specifically, the dream featured the river, the source of sustenance, prominently, and this interpretation wasn't about sustenance. (He seems to be citing a <em>midrash</em> for this, though it doesn't seem to me to be the <em>Midrash Raba</em> there.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I heard the following approach from R' Rivlin, Mashgiach of Kerem b'Yavneh.  Pharaoh was looking for more than just a clever interpretation based on the art of dream interpretation - he was looking for an <em>interpreter</em> who showed himself to know what the dream was and meant.  Pharaoh made slight changes in his relating of the dream, and Yosef identified this point to him.  In Pharaoh's dream, he was standing <em>on</em> the Nile (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8236#v=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereishis 41:1</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהִנֵּה עֹמֵד עַל הַיְאֹר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, when he told the dream to Yosef (and everyone else), he was not going to tell them that he dreamt he was standing on top of the god of Egypt, so he made a slight change (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8236#v=17\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereishis 41:17</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנְנִי עֹמֵד עַל <strong>שְׂפַת</strong> הַיְאֹר</p>\n<p>Behold I was standing on the <strong>bank</strong> of the Nile</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yosef, however, had more than Pharaoh's word to go on - he had Divine inside knowledge of the dream and its meaning.  He therefore pointed this out to Pharaoh (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16302#v=6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tehillim 81:6</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עדות ביהוסף שמו, בצאתו על ארץ מצרים, <strong>שפת</strong> לא ידעתי אשמע</p>\n<p>A testimony He placed in Yosef, when he went forth over Egypt, \"I could not hear [the word] 'bank'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yosef identified to Pharaoh the discrepancy in his relating of the dream, and it was therefore clear to Pharaoh that Yosef had more insight into this dream.  Therefore he accepted his interpretation.</p>\n<p>(I do not know if this comes from any earlier source, but I do not recall R' Rivlin giving one)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In Kovetz Sichos vol. 2 R' Nosson Meir Wachtfogel explains as follows:</p>\n\n<p>A dream's meaning depends on its interpretation (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=55b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berachos 55b</a>).  A positive interpretation <em>yields</em> a positive fulfillment, and the same with a negative interpretation.  When Pharaoh's advisors offered him interpretations, he rejected them because they were undesirable, and so he insisted that they were invalid interpretations in order to avoid them being <em>the</em> interpretation of his dream.  When Yosef came along with his (somewhat) positive interpretation, along with the advice of how to deal with the negative, Pharaoh gladly accepted it.</p>\n\n\n",

This request is then repeated in most of the conversations between the two of them that occur throughout the plagues. Yet, they never returned to Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>Was the original plan to return to Egypt, but that got changed somewhere along the way? If so, when did the plan change, and why? On the other hand, if the plan was to leave forever, why did that have to be done through deception?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>To first clarify, even though lying is usually frowned upon, I'm pretty sure that, at least ethically speaking, there's no reason to frown upon lying to Pharaoh in this situation if it was necessary to save the Jews. The question being dealt with here is why was this deception <em>necessary</em> - couldn't God have saved them without the lie?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/803515/Rabbi_Netanel_Wiederblank/Deception_in_Yetzias_Mitzrayim#\">this shiur</a>, I've heard five separate answers to this question:</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Ramban</strong> addresses this question, and writes (comments to Shemos 3:18) that this message wasn't necessary for Pharaoh, but for the Jews. The Jewish people would have been unwilling to follow Moshe to the land of Canaan where so many strong and fearsome nations resided, until they saw God's mighty hand expressed in the incredible miracles that He performed. According to the Ramban, only after witnessing these miracles did Moshe tell the Jews the true intentions of leaving Egypt. Needless to say, this explanation is considerably difficult to read into the pesukim.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Ibn Ezra</strong> and <strong>Ran</strong> in his Drashos write that telling Pharaoh that they would return after 3 days would (1) help convince the Egyptians to let them 'borrow' their stuff, and (2) cause Pharaoh to chase after the Jews when they didn't return, and thereby be drowned in the sea.  </p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Abarbanel</strong> disagrees with the Ran, since God hardened everyone's hearts anyway. He writes that this request was made of Pharaoh for PR reasons: by refusing such a reasonable request as a short vacation, everyone who hears the story will learn what an obstinate king Pharaoh was. R. Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg in HaKesav VaHakkabalah seems to agree, and he adds that this explains why Moshe stopped referring to the 'three days' request once the plagues got underway.</p>\n\n<p><strong>R. Yaakov Kamenetsy</strong>, in Emes L'Yaakov, suggests that the original plan was actually to only leave for three days. Even though eventually the Jews would be leaving Egypt in accordance with the <em>bris bein habesarim</em>, this would have only occurred after being in Egypt for 400 years, and a 'vacation' was needed of service to God to make sure that the Jews wouldn't sink to the depths of <em>tumah</em> during their slavery in Egypt, which would have continued. However, when Pharaoh refused and God had to begin bringing on the plagues, the plans changed.  </p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Rav Peninim Chumash</strong> includes many interesting 'peirushim' to various parshiyos, and his explanation given here is that God's instruction to deceive Pharaoh has an important educational value, to teach the Jewish people that in future wars they should do whatever is necessary to win, even if it may be deceitful or underhanded. Thus, even though deception wasn't <em>necessary</em> in this case, it will be in the future when we shouldn't be relying on miracles. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>Was Moshe decieving Pharoh, or was the original “Exodus” from Egypt meant to be temporary?</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exodus 3:18  And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come,\n  thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall\n  say unto him, The LORD G-d of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now\n  let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness,\n  that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This was more of a proof test as opposed to a deception or a change of plans.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exodus 3:19  And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go,\n  no, not by a mighty hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pharaoh is requested to make a fairly reasonable concession. His hard-heartedness is a sort of proof to Moshe the G-d knows what will happen and his plans can be trusted.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I addition to @Matt's excellent answer, I would like to add another reason I saw in the commentaries. </p>\n\n<p>The Ohr Hachaim on Shemot 3:18 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.3.18?lang=bi&with=Or%20HaChaim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>: </p>\n\n<p>\"G'd applies the yardstick of \"measure for measure.\" Sotah 11 states that the Egyptians had cleverly inveigled the Israelites into slave labour by sweet-talking them into such patriotic service, whereas gradually they became more and more cruel and demanding. G'd orchestrated the steps leading to redemption in a similar fashion. First He had Moses speak about a three day religious holiday for Pharaoh's labourers as well as borrowings of the Egyptians' silver and of their fancy garments. G'd gradually upped the ante, just as the Egyptians had done in their treatment of the Jews.\"</p>\n\n\n",

If someone wished to be stringent and follow opinions that require a longer duration for the <em>Chanuka</em> lights,<sup>3</sup> perhaps there would be basis for doing so. </p>\n\n<p>Further, contrary to the <em>Magein Avraham</em>'s view that there is no <em>hiddur</em> from more fuel, the <em>M'iri</em> (<em>Shabbos</em> 21b, \"ומ\"מ אם הוסיף מוסיפין לו\") seems to suggest that there is a <em>hiddur</em> from using more fuel. This may suggest a dispute as to the nature of <em>hiddur</em> in <em>Chanuka</em> lights, with the <em>M'iri</em> taking the view that the duration of the flame is subject to beautification and the <em>Magein Avraham</em> maintaining that only the nature of the lights is subject to beautification. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>From what I could find in the <em>Kol Bo</em> (§44) and <em>Orchos Chayim</em> (<em>Hilchos Chanuka</em>), the reason given for long candles is that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_ben_Abraham_of_Sens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbeinu Shimshon</a> required people to light long candles that could last as long as members of the household remain awake. He held that, by that era, the <em>pirsumei nisa</em> was essentially for the household (\"ולשיעורא כתב רבי' שמשון שגם עכשיו כן והוה מצריך לעשות קנדי\"לאש ארוכות\").

(As noted by the <em>Magein Avraham</em>, this quantity would naturally vary depending on the thickness of the wick). This is based on the <em>Orchos Chayim</em> cited above, who also mentions long candles as described in fn. 1. Perhaps, along the lines of the <em>Magein Avraham</em>'s reasoning, the <em>Mishna B'rura</em> simply considered huge candles to be unsightly.</sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> <sub>Possible reasons may include: 1. Uncertainty over whether you should light at sunset or nightfall. Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik <a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/2013/1083/800990.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reportedly used enough oil</a> to last from sunset to around 30 minutes after nightfall for this reason. 2. Uncertainly regarding whether עד שתכלה רגל מן השוק is theoretically variable based on the reality of contemporary society. I heard from a disciple of the Rav that the Rav proposed this. 3.

He\ndeported the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah, and in\nHabor, at the River Gozan, and in the towns of Media.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later in II Kings 18:11 it repeats these places:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֶּגֶל מֶלֶךְ־אַשּׁוּר אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵל אַשּׁוּרָה וַיַּנְחֵם בַּחְלַח\nוּבְחָבוֹר נְהַר גּוֹזָן וְעָרֵי מָדָי׃</p>\n<p>And the king of Assyria deported the Israelites to Assyria. He settled\nthem in Halah, and in Habor, the River Gozan, and in the towns of\nMedia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When this is later recounted in I Chronicles 5:26, we see one of the previous locations removed and one new one added:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיָּעַר אֱלֹהֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶת־רוּחַ פּוּל מֶלֶךְ־אַשּׁוּר\nוְאֶת־רוּחַ תִּלְּגַת פִּלְנֶסֶר מֶלֶךְ אַשּׁוּר וַיַּגְלֵם\nלָראוּבֵנִי וְלַגָּדִי וְלַחֲצִי שֵׁבֶט מְנַשֶּׁה וַיְבִיאֵם לַחְלַח\nוְחָבוֹר וְהָרָא וּנְהַר גּוֹזָן עַד הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה׃</p>\n<p>And the God of Israel roused the spirit of Pul, King of Assyria, and\nthe spirit of Tillegath-Pilneser, King of Assyria, and he deported the\nReubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought\nthem to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and the River Gozan, to this day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So from the Biblical sources themselves we have five places where they were deported, namely: Halah, Habor, the River Gozon, the towns of Media, and Hara.</p>\n<p>The Talmud Sanhedrin 94a asks where were they exiled to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>להיכא אגלי להו מר זוטרא אמר לאפריקי ורבי חנינא אמר להרי סלוג</p>\n<p>Where were they [the Ten Lost Tribes] exiled to? Mar Zutra says, “To\nAfriki” and Rabbi Hanina says, “To the Mountains of Selug”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is worth noting here that Maharal (Netzach Yisrael 34:5) says the Afriki mention in the Gemara here is not the Africa we are familiar with but rather another place as per the Talmud in Tamid 32a which refers to a place we cannot reach.</p>\n<p>In the Talmud Yevamot 16b-17a Rabbi Abba bar Kahana identifies the places mentioned in the Book of Kings (quoted above). He suggests Halah is Hilazon, Habor is Hadiyeb, the River Gozan is Ginzak, and the towns of Media is Hamadan and its surrounding areas. Some say it was Nihar and its surrounding areas. The Gemara asks which are these surrounding areas and Shmuel says they are Kerach, Mushkei, Hidkei and Domkei.</p>\n<p>The Midrash (Pesikta Rabbati 31) says they were exiled to three places:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מהו לאמר לאסורים צאו ששלש גליות נעשו עשרת השבטים אחת גלתה לסמבטיון\nואחת גלתה לפנים מסמבטיון ואחת גלתה לדפנו של רבלתה ונבלעה שם</p>\n<p>What does [the verse in Isaiah 49:9] mean “Say to the prisoners, ‘Go\nfree’”? [It teaches us] that there were three exiles [places] that\nhappened to the Ten Tribes. One was exiled to the Sambatyon, one was\nexiled to beyond the Sambatyon, and one was exiled to Daphne of\nAntiochia, and they were swallowed [assimilated] there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A similar version of this is found in the Jerusalem Talmud (Sanhedrin 10:5):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לְשָׁלֹש גָּלִיּוֹת גָּלוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל. אַחַת לִפְנִים מִנְּהַר\nסַנְבַּטְיוֹן וְאֶחָד לְדַפְנֵי שֶׁלְּ אַנְטִוֹכְיָא וְאַחַת שֶׁיָּרַד\nעֲלֵיהֶם הֶעָנָן וְכִסָּה אוֹתָם.</p>\n<p>There were three exiles for Israel. One was behind the Sambatyon\nRiver, and one to Daphne of Antiochia, and one, the cloud came down\nupon them and covered them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This gives us a good idea in terms of the Biblical and Talmudic/Midrashic sources of where they were exiled to. It does not help us in terms of where are those places located and what happened to them there. Did they assimilate? Did they relocate afterwards? Did they maintain some vestiges of Jewish practice? This topic, however, has thousands upon thousands of books written on this subject and there are many theories which attempt to answer the question.</p>\n<p><strong>In answer to question 2:</strong> Are they spread around the nations?</p>\n<p>Although we can not know definitively, it is highly plausible to suggest that over the more than two and a half millennia since their exile, there was likely a huge amount of movement around the world.</p>\n<p>Dr Avigdor Shachan, in his book, In the Footsteps of the Ten Lost Tribes, (page 45) suggests there was a lot of population movement by the ten tribes after their initial exile by the Assyrians. He says, their first base was Afghanistan, directly east of Israel, where according to some, four of the tribes of Israel established an independent state. This was likely in the region of the Hindu-Kush mountains and the surrounding area. According to Dr Shachan they wanted to reach Japan, and calculated two distinct routes of travel from Afghanistan. The shorter northern route would take them eastward from Afghanistan, by passing north of the Himalayas and traveling through the Pamir mountains via Chinese Turkestan and the Gobi Desert, toward the Korean Peninsula, which was a scheduled meeting point for later expeditions. The southern route would bypass the Himalayas on the south, via what is now Burma (Myanmar), toward the eastern coast of the continent and moving north towards the Korean Peninsula. This southern route was longer than the northern route but much easier to traverse.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, many academics (perhaps most) who suggest that the tribes are lost because they simply no longer exist; only their legend lives on in the hearts of those who seek them. But as an actual body of people they were assimilated shortly after the Assyrian deportations, as was the policy of the Empire to relocate and assimilate peoples in order to expand their empire.</p>\n<p>There are numerous groups around the world who claim descent from the Ten Lost Tribes or others have ascribed this identity to them. Each will have some oral history or tradition as to how they arrived to be where they are. Some of these tribal histories are shrouded in mystery and difficult to prove beyond the oral history of the people telling them.</p>\n<p>In answer to your question, if we assume that the Ten Lost Tribes did not all assimilate entirely, each group would need careful study to determine the validity of their claims and it is fair to say that with the amount of time that has passed, it is unlikely to reach a definitive conclusion.</p>\n<p>Where are they? As one professor of history put it, “Political claims regarding the ten tribes status of various groups have been made since the early modern period, attaching themselves to real and imagined peoples from, literally, A-Z” (The Ten Lost Tribes, A World History, Zvi Ben-Dor Benite, pages 5-6).</p>\n<p>Chronicling all of the groups would be a huge undertaking but to give a sense of just how far this goes, here are some of the more popular claims. From the Pashtun people of Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Bnei Menashe of Myanmar, to the Lemba in Zimbabwe and South Africa, to the Bene Israel of the western coast of India, to the Native Americans, the Beta Israel of Ethiopia, to the Igbo of Nigeria, to the Shinto of Japan, the Kyrgyz people, the Jews of Georgia and Bukhara; even the British people have been identified as lost tribes and adherents to what is known as Anglo Israelism still exist today.</p>\n<p><strong>In answer to question 3:</strong> If they are spread around the nations, how are they Jewish/have they assimilated?</p>\n<p>Regarding whether they assimilated or not, consider the Talmud Yevamot 16b, which states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַב יְהוּדָה אָמַר רַב אַסִּי: גּוֹי שֶׁקִּידֵּשׁ בִּזְמַן\nהַזֶּה — חוֹשְׁשִׁין לְקִדּוּשִׁין, שֶׁמָּא מֵעֲשֶׂרֶת הַשְּׁבָטִים\nהוּא</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rav Asi: With regard to a gentile who\nbetrothed a Jewish woman nowadays, we are concerned that the betrothal\nmight be valid, despite the fact that a betrothal of a gentile is\nmeaningless, lest he be from the ten tribes of Israel who intermingled\nwith the gentiles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can see here that even in the time of these Talmudic discussions, which took place approximately 1,000 years after the exile of the Ten Tribes by the Assyrian empire, there was a clear understanding that assimilation had taken place. So much so that Rav Asi believes that someone who marries a gentile [in certain places where the exiles were sent to…see the Gemara further on] may have actually performed a halachic Jewish marriage as they may have assimilated among the nations but still be Jewish.</p>\n<p>Another important point to consider is when discussing the Ten Lost Tribes, we are not necessarily talking about ‘halachic Jews’ or what we would consider to be a ‘full Jew’ according to normative Rabbinic Judaism today.</p>\n<p>It is worth remembering that tribal heritage goes through the father, not the mother. Perhaps a productive way to consider it is that, they don’t have a [normative] Jewish identity - rather they have an Israelite identity, which is something you can have without being Jewish. An interesting fact to note, the Northern Kingdom [from which the Ten Tribes come] was called the Kingdom of Israel - and many of the groups who lay claim to be descendent have the name Israel (as opposed to Jew/Yehud) in their name. Like the Bene Israel of India, or the Pashtun of Afghanistan (they refer to themselves as Bani Israil), or ones who specifically trace themselves to a specific tribe.</p>\n<p>The Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews) maintained a very strong identity even though they were ostensibly cut off from mainstream Judaism for well over a thousand years. They had probably the strongest claim from any other group as they had actual texts (not everything) in their possession for thousands of years, including some form of an Oral Torah tradition. Rav Ovadia Yosef has argued they are descendent from the Tribe of Dan and much has been written about this which I will not bring here.</p>\n<p>In any event, the identity of groups who claim to be Lost Tribes is a complex one, and one that is difficult to define in the way the question posed here attempts to.</p>\n<p><strong>In answer to question 4:</strong> Are they spread within the Jewish nation?</p>\n<p>Most people within the Jewish nation today would be said to belong to either the tribes of Yehuda, Binyamin or Levi.</p>\n<p>Some suggest that prior to the Assyrian conquest of the Northern Kingdom, many people from the Ten Tribes fled south to their brethren in the Kingdom of Judah and were mixed up among the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. See Otzar Midrashim, Midrashim on the Ten Lost Tribes, Introduction 2.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Talmud Megilla 14b and Arakhin 33a describes how the prophet Jeremiah went to return many of the lost tribes in his day who were then integrated into the tribes of Yehuda and Binyamin and didn’t retain a separate tribal identity. In that case too, it is clear from the commentaries that it was only a minority of these tribes who returned, and their proof is that otherwise the mitzvah of Yovel (Jubilee) would have been reinstituted (as it requires the majority of the tribes living in their respective portions of the Land).</p>\n<p>According to this opinion, the Ten Tribes are integrated within the Jewish people as we know them today.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If you were living in the time of the destruction of the Northern kingdom, you would have many options where to go. Certainly many individuals went south to join the Tribes of Yehuda and Benyamin. By the time of the exile of the North, many individuals had intermarried into different tribes. Once they left the North, there was no longer any reason to keep together as a separate tribe. Sancheriv, the conqueror of the North had an interest in moving people around so they would lose solidarity and loyalty to their conquered land. He moved the 10 tribes into various places. Some of the tribes that stayed in tact were later brought back by the prophet Yirmeyahu. But eventually ALL of the 12 tribes were mixed together in exile and only Levi and Cohen people kept track of their lineage. All the tribes are \"lost\". So the masses of Jews all over the world are a mixture. Some groups of people with Jewish customs, like the ones in Afghanistan, are likely remnants of the original 10 tribes. Possibly also the Ethiopian Jews and some in India. There are small groups of peoples that have been found that say they go back to biblical Israel but there's no proof. The sages say that in the end of days a prophet or Elijah will be able to separate everyone's lineage, and at that time it is understood that the tribal affiliation, including the \"10 Lost Tribes\" will return.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I am not Jewish and I have no formal training in anything.</p>\n<p>I recently came across <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aeQr1tD1rtI?t=189\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an excellent explanation of the lost tribes and the centrality of the promise of the recovery of them</a> given in the Torah and the prophets. While the video was produced by a group that would identify as Christian, the video in the first half is about the history and prophetic texts which I would characterize as a \"pre-Pauline\" or \"anti-Pauline\" perspective that would, I believe, be in line with Jewish scholarship. (However, please see my disclaimer). Note: I cued up the video to where the important part starts. The second part of the video I do not agree with though some here might.</p>\n<p>One very important passage about the resurrection of the dry bones of Israel is explained <em>that it refers to the divine recovery of the lost sheep</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And say to them, So says the Lord God: Behold I will take the children of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and I will gather them from every side, and I will bring them to their land.</p>\n<p>כאוְדַבֵּ֣ר אֲלֵיהֶ֗ם כֹּֽה־אָמַר֘ אֲדֹנָ֣י יֱהֹוִה֒ הִנֵּ֨ה אֲנִ֚י לֹקֵ֙חַ֙ אֶת־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל מִבֵּ֥ין הַגּוֹיִ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֣ר הָֽלְכוּ־שָׁ֑ם וְקִבַּצְתִּ֚י אֹתָם֙ מִסָּבִ֔יב וְהֵֽבֵאתִ֥י אוֹתָ֖ם אֶל־אַדְמָתָֽם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I should also mention the enigmatic statement by Jesus in regard to his mission that falls into place when this background is understood:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Mat 15:21-28 NIV] (21) Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. (22) A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, \"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.\" (23) Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, \"Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.\" (24) He answered, <strong>\"I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.\"</strong> (25) The woman came and knelt before him. \"Lord, help me!\" she said. (26) He replied, <strong>\"It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs.\"</strong> (27) \"Yes it is, Lord,\" she said. \"Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table.\" (28) Then Jesus said to her, \"Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.\" And her daughter was healed at that moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# In what sense is Hanukkah \"a Yom Tov like other yamim tovim\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Machzor Vitry (<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=1nBBAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%D7%A8%D7%9C%D7%93&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§234</a>) finds a scriptural source for Hanukkah in Leviticus 24:2. That the stipulation that Israelites should collect pure olive oil for the menorah should follow on from a description of the festivals would seem to suggest that there would one day be an additional festival that relates in some way to pure olive oil. This is the language of the Machzor Vitry:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רמז לחנוכה מן התורה שכת׳ אחר כל המועדות בפר׳ אמר ויקחו אליך שמן זית\n  זך... ומדכתביה עם המועדות למדנו שהוא יום טוב כשאר ימים טובים</p>\n  \n  <p>There is an allusion to Hanukkah in the Torah in that it is written,\n  after all of the festivals in Parshat Emor, \"collect pure olive oil\n  for yourselves\"... and since it is written together with the other\n  festivals, it teaches us that it is a <em>yom tov</em> like the other <em>yamim\n  tovim</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The gemara also refers to the days of Hanukkah as <em>yamim tovim</em> (Shabbat 21b), but Rashi very carefully stipulates (s.v. ועשאום ימים טובים) that they are not <em>yamim tovim</em> in respect of any prohibition of work, but only in respect of one needing to recite hallel and <em>al hannissim</em>. This is important, since the usual definition of a <em>yom tov</em> is of a festival day on which work is forbidden (cf: Rambam, Hilkhot Shevitat Yom Tov 1:1).</p>\n\n<p>That said, the festivals mentioned in Parshat Emor <em>are</em> all days on which it is forbidden to work, and the drash recorded in Machzor Vitry would seem to be explicitly likening Hanukkah to them. What is more, the stipulation that Hanukkah is a <em>yom tov</em> \"like the other <em>yamim tovim</em>\" would argue against its being a <em>yom tov</em> only in respect of the fact that one recites hallel and <em>al hannissim</em> on it, since one does not recite hallel on Rosh haShana, and one <em>only</em> recites <em>al hannissim</em> on Hanukkah and Purim.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, in what sense can Hanukkah be said to be a <em>yom tov</em> \"like the other <em>yamim tovim</em>\", while still allowing for the permissibility of work? Also, and relatedly, in what sense can this passage be reconciled with the opinion of Rashi in Shabbat 21b? This question becomes more profound when you consider the fact that the author of the Machzor Vitry, R' Simchah ben Shmuel, was a student of Rashi, and that this opinion of his is brought as an addition to Rashi's commentary (מוסף רש״י) on Leviticus 24:2, in the Miqraot Gedolot.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Ramchal in one of his books on logic says that saying one thing is \"like\" another only means there is a minimum of one way in which there is a resemblance.

    "content": "# Why study non-practical tractates of Talmud?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A quick background:\nI recently sat down with my step-father and brother and learned Masechet Makkot with them for a bit - this was their first time learning Talmud. Given that the masechet starts talking about capital punishments more or less from the get go (I gave them some background on the Jewish court system and how difficult it is to actually give the death penalty), they found it a bit hard to relate to, and asked: \"What is the point of learning this if it isn't applied today?\". </p>\n\n<p>So, what is the best answer?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In every tractate, there are parts that are \"practical\" either directly or indirectly. I'll explain by examples:</p>\n\n<p>The first two tractate I learned was Bava Metzi'ah . It talks about two people holding a tallit and arguing about who gets what. OK, How often do 2 people argue about who gets a tallit, unless it's in shul (and then, the SHUL owns the tallit - it's not \"found\") so you can say this is impractical, but it is very practical as often two people find some lost object simultaneously and you have to determine who gets it. (Perhaps, this notion occurs with copyrights and patents where you have to decide who came up with the idea first). So what seems impractical actually does become very practical.</p>\n\n<p>Other things really do not have practical applications - much of tractate Rosh Hashanna discusses witnesses testifying about the crescent moon before the Sanhedrin. That doesn't apply today. OK, but isn't knowing something about history and how things were done useful even if it may not be \"practical\"?</p>\n\n<p>I asked my rebbe in high school the same question you did. (It's a valid question, by all means!) his answer was that studying Talmud is its own reward. Besides the great mitzvah of learning, he emphasized the importance of honing logic and derivation skills. Granted, this could be gained by learning \"practical\" tractates. To this, he explained that sometimes, it is better when you <strong>don't</strong> have a familiarization with the topic - i.e. it doesn't seem \"practical\". This way, you have no \"biases\" towards how things \"are\" or \"should be\", as that can sometimes interfere with your appreciation of the argumentation and logic that the Gemarah uses.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate my Rebbe's point even if, then, and now, I agree with about 60% of his thinking. See YeZ's answer - it concurs with my Rebbe's thinking.</p>\n\n<p>I've also seen another answer, that you should study the \"non practical\" topics so that you know what to do when circumstances make them practical. (See DoubleAA's related link). I used to have trouble with this answer regarding learning, say, tractate <em>Zevachim</em> or most of the tractates in <em>Kodshim</em>. They deal with sacrifices and many laws that don't apply now. Why should I learn them?</p>\n\n<p>Then, I realized, by comparison, in my English class, I was learning 20 vocabulary words each week - many of them I didn't think I would <strong>ever</strong> use. (How often would I use the word \"jejune\"?) Well, guess what? I've used the majority of the words that I learned, because the situations to use them occurred.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson to be learned - Funny how life creates \"practicality\" for you.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><strong>In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7884/jewish/Chapter-5.htm\">Tanya Chapter 5</a>, this question is discussed. There it's explained that Torah is Chochmas Hashem - Hashem's Wisdom, and therefor learning any Torah is an intense union/connection with Hashem. Understanding His Wisdom is valuable in its own right, regardless of whether it's relevant or not. (See the quote below for more elaboration).</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דרך משל: כשאדם מבין ומשיג איזו הלכה במשנה או בגמרא לאשורה על בוריה\n  When, for example, one understands and comprehends a particular halachah in the Mishnah or Gemara, clearly and thoroughly, through strenuous application of his mind,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>הרי שכלו תופס ומקיף אותה, וגם שכלו מלובש בה באותה שעה\nhis intellect grasps and encompasses that halachah, and his intellect is also clothed in it at that time when he strives to understand it.</p>\n\n<p>והנה הלכה זו היא חכמתו ורצונו של הקדוש ברוך הוא\nNow, this halachah is the wisdom and Will of G-d — the rationale underlying the halachah is G-d’s wisdom, and the ruling itself is G-d’s Will, as mentioned in ch. 4.</p>\n\n<p>שעלה ברצונו שכשיטעון ראובן כך וכך, דרך משל, ושמעון כך וכך, יהיה הפסק ביניהם כך וכך\nIt so arose in His Will that if, for example, Reuven would claim thus and Shimon thus, such and such should be the verdict between them.</p>\n\n<p>ואף אם לא היה ולא יהיה הדבר הזה לעולם, לבא למשפט על טענות ותביעות אלו\nEven if it never did nor ever will come to pass that litigation occur over these arguments and claims,</p>\n\n<p>Thus, were the purpose of Torah study only to learn how to practice its laws — in this case: how to resolve this dispute — then the study of such a law would indeed serve no purpose. In fact, however, there is great value in studying even such a halachah, for thereby one knows G-d’s Will and wisdom, and attaches himself to it, as the Alter Rebbe continues:</p>\n\n<p>מכל מקום, מאחר שכך עלה ברצונו וחכמתו של הקדוש ברוך הוא, שאם יטעון זה כך וזה כך יהיה הפסק כך\nyet, since it arose thus in G-d’s Will and wisdom that if one person would claim this way and the other that way, the verdict be such and such,</p>\n\n<p>הרי כשאדם יודע ומשיג בשכלו פסק זה, כהלכה הערוכה במשנה או גמרא או פוסקים\ntherefore when one knows and comprehends this verdict as a halachah set forth in the Mishnah or Gemara or Poskim (the halachic codifiers),</p>\n\n<p>If one arrives at the identical verdict on the basis of any other legal system, this verdict represents human knowledge, not Divine wisdom. If, however, he derives the ruling from Torah,</p>\n\n<p>הרי זה משיג ותופס ומקיף בשכלו רצונו וחכמתו של הקדוש ברוך הוא, דלית מחשבה תפיסא ביה ולא ברצונו וחכמתו\nhe then actually comprehends and grasps the Will and wisdom of G-d, Whom no thought can grasp, nor [can any thought grasp] His Will and wisdom,</p>\n\n<p>כי אם בהתלבשותם בהלכות הערוכות לפנינו\nexcept when they — G-d’s Will and wisdom — clothe themselves in the halachot set before us.</p>\n\n<p>This is one facet of understanding Torah, namely, that thereby one’s intellect encompasses the Divine Will and wisdom. \n...\nוהוא יחוד נפלא, שאין יחוד כמוהו ולא כערכו נמצא כלל בגשמיות\nNow this is a most wonderful unity; in the physical realm there in no unity similar or parallel to it, i.e., of two things as disproportionate as human intellect and Torah, G-d’s intellect —</p>\n\n<p>להיות לאחדים ומיוחדים ממש מכל צד ופנה\nthat they should actually become one and united from every side and angle.</p>\n\n<p>וזאת מעלה יתירה גדולה ונפלאה לאין קץ, אשר במצות ידיעת התורה והשגתה\nThis is the distinctive, infinitely great and wonderful superiority of the mitzvah of knowing and comprehending Torah</p>\n\n<p>על כל המצות מעשיות, ואפילו על מצות התלויות בדבור, ואפילו על מצות תלמוד תורה שבדיבור\nover all the mitzvot involving action, and even over those performed through speech; indeed, even over the mitzvah of oral Torah study.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In some Yeshivos, they deliberately choose Masechtas that are the least practical, as they understand this to be the best manifestation of Torah Lishma - learning Torah just for the sake of learning Torah, and not for any other purpose.

This not only serves the practical purpose of being ready to light on time without delaying to set up later, but it also commemorates the practice in the Beit HaMikdash called Hatavat HaNeirot, whereby the Kohen (Gadol) tended the Menora and prepared it in the morning for kindling in the late, late afternoon. Since our lighting on Chanuka directly commemorates the lighting of the Menora in the Beit HaMikdash, this suggestion provides a nice “added touch” to the mitzva and symbolism of Chanuka lighting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Temple practice of \"<em>Hatavat HaNeirot</em>,\" preparing the lights, actually had a holier status than actually lighting them, as only <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kohanim</a> were authorized to do the former, whereas any Jew could technically do the latter. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rosensweig\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Michael Rosensweig</a>, in an <a href=\"http://www.torahweb.org/torah/2010/moadim/rros_chanukah.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">essay</a> that examines this and many other details of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menorah_(Temple)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Temple menora</a>, suggests that the early preparation of its lights contributes to an overall message of constancy of service of God, and that this message is particularly well-suited to Chanukah: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These themes resonate particularly on <em>Chanukah</em>. Jewish spiritual life was endangered precisely by the effort to disrupt the continuity, constancy and comprehensiveness of <em>halachic</em> life. Particular <em>mizvot</em> and <em>halachic</em> institutions were targeted, undoubtedly also with the purpose of eviscerating the unity and integrity of <em>halachic</em> life. A piecemeal and disjointed <em>avodat Hashem</em> constitutes a corruption of the ideal of <em>halachic</em> life and poses a significant spiritual risk, warranting a rebellion. Moreover, Greek ideology itself promotes the idea of compartmentalization and the fragmentation of spiritual forces and authority, a perspective totally incompatible with Torah life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With this concept in mind, it seems to me that keeping one's menorah in a state of readiness for lighting all day long could serve as a meaningful extension of the menorah's potency as a symbol of Jewish dedication.</p>\n\n\n",

But the Lubavitcher Rebbe citing the Rogatchover Gaon in connection with the subject of the laws associated with a \"Rebellious City\" makes clear that the Avot were not obligated in the 613 commandments, meaning they were not commanded to observe them. Their fulfillment of the 613 commandments of the Torah was voluntary.</p>\n\n<p>One of the consequences of this distinction which the Rebbe explains was that their observing of the 613 commandments could not be in conflict with those prohibitory laws which were obligatory upon a Noahide at that time.</p>\n\n<p>The prohibitions relating to marriages of consanguinity are generally obligations that do fall upon a Noahide in the sources that I have seen. But since Yibum appears to override that prohibition, I am speculating that perhaps Yibum is also obligatory upon a Noahide.</p>\n\n<p>Please explain any reasoning carefully and cite all sources clearly and completely in any responses posted. And thanks to all for your input.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There is a dispute of the Rishonim as to whether or not daughter in law is a relationship prohibited to Noahides (Ramban vs. Rashba).  The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.98a.12?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban (to Yevamos 98a) holds that Noahides have no prohibition of relationships with relatives who are not blood relatives.</a>  He brings a proof to this from the fact that Yehuda absolved Tamar upon discovering her identity, and she was not put to death for violating the prohibition of Father-in-Law/daughter-in-law.  Yibbum, he writes, was a minhag, and therefore Yehuda did not remain with Tamar, but there was no mitzvah which could have overridden the prohibition if it would have existed.  (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.38.2?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Ramban to Bereishis 38:2 explains that there is some mystical benefit that is inherent in Yibbum</a>, and therefore the wise men of the ages practiced Yibbum even though there was no formalized <em>Mitzvah</em>.)</p>\n<p>The Rashba (same place) on the other hand, holds that this is not a proof, and writes that even if Noahides had a prohibition to relatives through marriage, the <em>mitzvah</em> of Yibbum would have overridden it.  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.98a.12?lang=bi&with=Rashba&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Rashba explains that before Matan Torah, Yibbum extended to all relatives, and that <em>Mitzvah</em> overrode the prohibition of relationships with relatives.</a></p>\n<p>Rashba Yevamos 98a s.v. Ger:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותדע לך שהרי יהודה אמר על כלתו צדקה ממני, ואלו היתה אסורה לו משום כלה, אכתי חייבת מיתה היא משום ערוה לכולי עלמא, דהא בית דין של ישראל ממיתין עליה, אלא ודאי עריות דאישות דקרובים לית להו. ומיהו אין תמר ראיה דמותרת היתה לו ליהודה דבר תורה משום יבמה, דקודם התורה היה יבום מותר בקרובין, אלא שרצה יהודה לנהוג בה כדרך שצותה התורה באחים, לא באב שהאח עיקר, ובקי היה בענינו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even the Rashba, however, identifies that this was only before the Torah was given.</p>\n<p>When the Torah was given, it restricted the <em>Mitzvah</em> to the case in which it has the greatest effect, which is the case of a brother, who shares the closest genetic relationship (both parents are the same).  In this case, it overrides (or precludes) the prohibition of brother's wife, but in all other cases, the prohibition supersedes whatever spiritual inherent benefit there may be.  The inherent benefit still exists, however, and therefore the Rashba writes that when there is no prohibition in the way, such as in the case of Boaz, Yibbum is still a value. (This last paragraph is based on the shiurim of R' Tzvi Berkowitz.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/e509.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam Ch. 9 of Kings & Wars</a> lists all prohibited relatives for Noahides, and \"sister-in-law\" is not on the list. Therefore, Yibum is not overriding any prohibition for them. Mr. Noahide, you want to marry your brother's ex-wife? That's totally your choice (<em>well, you have to ask her first</em>), whether there were kids or weren't; whether the marriage ended in death or divorce.</p>\n\n<p>There had been a Yibum-like practice prior to Sinai; and it's possible that for the patriarchs trying to keep the 613, Yibum or quasi-Yibum may have overridden some of those. But for Noahides today? Zero mention of any of this. </p>\n\n\n",

Some use this to explain how helping someone violate a Rabbinical prohibition could be catergorized as a Biblical violation of lifnei iver, because it is bad advice to do so.</p>\n\n<p>So if someone would ask you whether or not they should hooble, and you would answer, as per the <em>psak</em> of your Rabbi, that they shoudn't, then it could be lifnei iver to then help them hooble.  If you feel that they should not be hoobling (which they certainly shouldn't be!), perhaps this help could be considered to be giving them bad advice.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The simple general answer is that:</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you hold its forbidden but they hold its allowed, then you may help them to do it.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But, if you hold its allowed and they hold its forbidden, then you may not help them do it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It all depends only on what they hold, not you.</p>\n\n<p>Explanation and sources with more specifics:</p>\n\n<p>The Torah in Vayikra 19:14 says \"...you shall not place a stumbling block in front of the blind..\" Rashi brings the Sifra which explains it to mean that one may not give bad advice to someone. The Rambam (based on Gemara) explains it to mean one may not help someone sin.</p>\n\n<p>The K'sav Sofer in Yoreh Deah 77 says that if the other person holds something is permitted, then you may help them, but if the other person holds it is forbidden, then you may not help them. It is obvious that helping them do what they think is forbidden is bad advice for them, causing them to sin even if you don't think it is a sin for yourself. However, if they don't have an issur, you are not harming them at all with any bad advice. (even if you wouldn't do it yourself)</p>\n\n<p>Reb Moshe Feinstein (O.C., I.186 by esrogim of shemittah, and Even HaEzer 4:61, by heter mechirah during shemittah in Israel) says that if the other people rely on a legitimate poseik for a heter, then you may supply them with whatever they view as heter, even if you yourself hold it is forbidden. Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach also agrees with this. (Minchas Shlomo A:42,44)</p>\n\n<p>So clearly you may help them hooble and sell them a hoobler device. The fact that you yourself do not hooble is not important. This is because their reliance on the hooble permitting poseik makes what they are doing absolutely not a sin. Tempting them to do it is also not bad advice. Therefore, it cannot be lifnei iver. :)</p>\n\n\n",

If this last judge says guilty, the defendant will go free. Reb Eibshitz therefore says he should say innocent so that what this judge believes is the correct judgment will be carried out.

Say Dayan 23 thinks innocent but all preceding Dayanim have said \"guilty\". If he also says guilty the defendant will go free, if he says innocent the defendant will be killed. So why shouldn't he <em>also</em> say guilty instead of innocent to save the defendant?

The Chazon Ish felt that wearing a long jacket was proper for exactly this issue. In fact he would wear an extra large tallis kattan so that when he went on his health walks in the heat, he would be able to drape his jacket over his shoulders and still have the tallis kattan cover enough of his legs.

However there are some types of trousers that are especially cut, in a manner which accentuates the crotch and the male organ. These latter styles are considered vulgar by thoughtful people who are sensitive to modesty. </p>\n\n<p>In the days of old, even non-Jews were sensitive to this refinement, and therefore wore tunics or robes that covered the crotch area.

The verse (Shemos 20:23) notes that the use of steps would be tantamount to revealing ones nakedness to the holy altar. Rashi (ad loc.) asks, being that the kohanim wore trousers, how would their nakedness be revealed when using steps? Rashi answers, that the mere stretching of the legs which is required when using steps, is considered to be close to revealing one’s nakedness, even when fully clothed. Such was the refinement which was called for in the setting of the holy temple!</p>\n\n<p>The lesson for us in this is to understand, that the revelation of the crotch area, even if covered, is a step down in modesty.</p>\n\n\n",

What was needed was that Vespasian be sufficiently impressed, and thus be merciful.</p>\n<p>It's therefore worth pointing out several differences between the stories, which might show how RYBZ was more impressive than Josephus:</p>\n<p>a) Josephus was captured and facing death.

It is hard to imagine that Josephus would lie about such an event, when even a Flavian could read his <em>Vita</em>. Indeed, <em>Contra Apionem</em> 1:51–52 (cf. <em>Vita</em> 361–362) records: </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So confident was I of [my narrative's] veracity that I presumed to take as my witnesses, before all others, the commanders-in-chief in the war, Vespasian and Titus. They were the first to whom I presented my volumes, copies being afterwards given to many Romans who had taken part in the campaign. Others I sold to a large number of my compatriots, persons well versed in Greek learning, among whom were Julius Archelaus, the most venerable Herod, and the most admirable King Agrippa himself. All these bore testimony to my scrupulous safeguarding of the truth, and they were not the men to conceal their sentiments or keep silence had I, through ignorance or partiality, distorted or omitted any of the facts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It was Titus, not Vespasian, who laid siege to Jerusalem.

This decision was </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...Based on the fact that she completely changed her lifestyle shortly after her conversion, with no remnants of observing the religious commandments (mitzvot) she agreed to uphold\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, another Rabbi in the article disputes being able to revoke a conversion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to Chuck Davidson, a modern Orthodox rabbi and social activist on what he calls “the conversion crisis in Israel,” it is very clear in rabbinic literature that there is almost no instance in which a conversion can be revoked.</p>\n  \n  <p>“From the Middle Ages onwards, the greatest of the rabbis wrote explicitly that even if immediately after the conversion the convert goes off to worship idols, the person is still considered Jewish,” said Davidson, who has published extensively on this subject.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What are the sources for both opinions?</p>\n\n<p>What would/do other Battei Din do?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/48512/21\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/48512/21</a> for more.</p>\n\n<p>If we have some magical machine that can tell us that a person is completely sincere about their conversion, then it can't be revoked by their behavior afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>But if we have reason to suspect an insincere conversion, then their behavior immediately afterwards could be used as an indication. Rabbi Hershel Schachter tells a story that Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveichik was asked of a non-Jewish fellow who was dating a Jewish woman. Immediately after converting, he kept <em>nothing whatsoever.</em> He then married her and then disappeared with her money. Rabbi Soloveichik ruled that if he kept <em>nothing</em>, it was obvious the conversion was a sham for nothing but the sake of marriage, and therefore invalid. (Thus the Jewish woman could remarry without a Jewish divorce.)</p>\n\n<p>Now if someone kept most/all for a reasonable time after conversion, and then later their religious observance slipped, we'd assume their initial commitment was sincere. Now how much has to be kept, and for how long, ... it's really hard to tell.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The opinion expressed by Chuck Davidson is based on a straight reading of the Shulchan Aruch (YD <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=193\" rel=\"nofollow\">268:2</a> & <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=194\" rel=\"nofollow\">12</a>), which states that if a properly functioning <em>beis din</em> performs a conversion, the conversion is final and valid even if the convert subsequently fails to keep Torah law. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, according to most <em>poskim</em>, a <em>beis din</em> is not empowered to accept a convert whom they know to be completely insincere, and if they do so the conversion is indeed invalid. (In fact, this may actually be a unanimous opinion, the disagreement being only on what qualifies as \"completely insincere\".)</p>\n\n<p>An intermediate case is discussed by R' Moshe Feinstein (YD <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&st=&pgnum=350&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">3:106</a> & <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&st=&pgnum=353&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">108</a>). He writes that in a case where a <em>beis din</em> chose to accept a convert who was known to have questionable motives, the validity of the conversion remains uncertain until the convert demonstrates his sincerity through his actions. (R' Moshe says that this is the intent of the Shulchan Aruch's statement, וחוששין לו עד שתתברר צדקתו (YD 268:12), regarding such a conversion.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The only ways to revoke are a conversion are when:</p>\n\n<p>1) The mikveh is found to be not kosher</p>\n\n<p>2) The mila (of a male) is found to be not kosher</p>\n\n<p>3) The \"dayyanim\" are not frum males over the age of 13</p>\n\n<p>4) It can be proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that the convert had no intent of ever joining the Jewish people. Non-observance does not, in and of itself, prove that.

He says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><p>Tax-free income that went into a retirement (or other) account designated specifically for you that has no required vesting period — such as contributions into your 401k, tax-deductible IRA account, or non-qualified deferred compensation program is not considered maaser income in the year it is earned; instead, it will be considered maaser income in the year it is received. (Note: not everyone agrees with this. Some hold that this income is liable for maaser in the year it is earned and is then received \"maaser-free\" later.)</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>As a general rule for other cases not outlined above:\n  don't include income that will be taxable in a coming year (like 401k contributions);</li>\n  <li>include income (or benefits) received this year on a tax-free basis (like FSA income).</li>\n  </ul></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, he seems to be talking about traditional 401(k)s and IRAs.  My question is, what about Roth (post-tax) 401(k) or IRA accounts?</p>\n\n<p>On one hand, he mentions that he is specifically talking about tax-free income or income that will be taxed in a coming year, which would exclude Roth retirement accounts and require maaser to be taken in the year that the income is earned and received \"maaser-free\" upon future distributions. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, it seems odd to me that the fact that the U.S. government takes taxes on a Roth account ahead of time should affect the maaser status of a retirement account. In either case, one could have have the income deducted from one's paycheck and deposited into a post-tax retirement account without ever having actually touched the money. So if the only difference between traditional and Roth retirement savings accounts is when the tax is taken, why is the maaser status different?</p>\n\n<p>So which is it?  Are post-tax retirement accounts subject to maaser now and distributed maaser-free later, or do we skip maaser distributions now and give them upon taking income from the retirement account?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n<p>Actually, it is not as much a matter of paying maaser, but of the ease of calculation. For example, consider an investment of money in tax-free municipal bonds. The money that you take from the bank to pay for the bonds has already had <em>ma'aser</em> \"taken out\". Thus, when you cash in the bonds, only the interest or profit on the bonds is subject to <em>ma'aser</em>. This is similar to a Roth IRA or 401K that you fund from your own bank account. On the other hand, if you take money from your bank account and supplement it with the appropriate amount of <em>ma'aser money</em> for an investment, then all of the money in that investment <strong>including the principal</strong> will be subject to <em>ma'aser</em> when you withdraw it. This makes it easier to perform calculations and to handle the money.</p>\n<p>Using the tax status of the money is merely a convenience to allow you to determine how much of that money is subject to <em>ma'aser</em>. Since the government keeps track of the Roth IRA tax status, you can pay <em>ma'aser</em> on the post-tax investment and let the government calculate the difference for you.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the money came in to the Roth IRA by direct deposit, and you had calculated your <em>ma'aser</em> based on your net paycheck received, then you would consider every penny in that account (including the original post-tax investment) as <em>pre-ma'aser</em>.</p>\n<p>Another analogy would be money that you put into a pushka at home. You wait until the pushka is full before sending a check to the charity. Here to, any <em>ma'aser</em> that is in the account, will be taken and sent to the charity when you take out the money. In fact, I would say that if a bond matures and no longer earns interest, you can send the appropriate amount of <em>ma'aser</em> and consider the entire bond as \"post-<em>ma'aser</em>\". It is as if you had bought that portion of the bond from <em>ma'aser</em> for yourself.</p>\n<p>I hope that this makes the concept clearer.</p>\n<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong></p>\n<p>When I was setting up my accounts, the matter was more a function of the way ma'aser is calculated rather than when the tax is taken. If the money is direct deposit, then you can calculate the ma'aser on the amount that is deposited into your checking and savings account. In that way, the Roth is treated the same as the 401K and is subject to ma'aser when you withdraw it.</p>\n<p>Many discussions consider the tax withheld on your paycheck like the expense in a business and not subject to ma'aser (since you never receive it). In that case, any tax refunds are considered income and subject to ma'aser. Similarly, any money withheld from your paycheck is never received by you and is an expense and not part of your income.</p>\n<p>That is why a store pays ma'aser on the net and not the gross sales as only the profit is subject to ma'aser.</p>\n<p>If something that is not considered a maaser expense is withheld from your pay chack, then you would have to add it back into the calculation. However, this normally does not occur. An example might be if your company withholds a charitable donation that is deductible, you would have to remember to put it on your schedule A. Just counting the net pay is just the normal way of handling matters.</p>\n<p>I go into more detail on the matter at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34095/can-tax-ever-be-considered-maaser/36676#36676\">Can tax ever be considered maaser?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2130768\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maaser Kesafim and the Development of Tax Law</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Books/index.php3?id=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Text on this</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=maaser+kesafim&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=21246075685&hvpos=1t3&hvexid=&hvnetw=s&hvrand=4827999763343182951&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_8wssbgovvm_b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amazon</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maaser Kesafim: Giving a Tenth to Charity Domb, Cyril (editor)    Halacha Feldheim    1999</p>\n<p>From times of old it has been an honored Jewish practice to give maaser, a tenth of our earnings to tzedaka, charity.

If they are, how should indivisible assets be dealt with? Is there a specific \"tax year\"? What expenses are allowed? How is capital investment to be dealt with? How are charities defined, and is there an order of priorities in the matter? To find answers, a research team of the British Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists made a careful study of the Shulchan Aruch and the responsa literature. Where no clear-cut answers could be found, the next step was to turn to the great Torah authorities of our day. This book is a record of the results of their investigations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Suppose a non-Jewish woman wants to convert, and meanwhile there is a Jewish <em>mamzer</em> who would like to get married.

The Chazon writes, among several objection to institution of Heter Mechira in Israel, that since the sale to the Gentile is not recorded in the land authority registry (Tabo) the title is not legally transferred and the sale is not legitimate. Since the sale is not legally binding according to the laws that govern such transactions. </p>\n\n<p>His conclusion applies here equally as it is not an effective sale according to state law. </p>\n\n\n",

Some have נחמות - comforts - instead of war. But comfort for what? (similar to the debate about ונחמתא in Kaddish).

I don't recall ever seeing this question raised when the poskim talk about not wearing a kippa, which would lead one to say it is not a problem.</p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of points to consider. First of all this would be what we call the viewer tricking himself, which is muttar. By that I mean the boss made an assumption on his own volition without the worker saying a word. Much like a homeowner opening a barrel of wine before his guest and the guest thinks it was done in his honor when in reality the homeowner needed to open it anyways. The gemara says this is muttar.\nAs long as no steps are taken to trick the one observing such as dying the hair of an old slave to make him look young. The gemara says that is assur.

He discusses possible dispensation for a life-threatening situation, but the implication is that otherwise it would be forbidden to omit it. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A Kippah is an absolute obligation.  A Kippah is of great importance.  Our Sages explain that a Kippah is meant to instill fear of Hashem within us and is a sign that the Master of the Universe is above us (Shabbat 156b.  Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 3:6).  According to the Achronim, it is even more of an obligation in our times, since wearing a Kippah has been accepted by Torah observant people (Shut Meharshal #72.  Shulchan Aruch Ha-Rav 2:6 based on accepted Jewish practice.  And some say not wearing a Kippah is imitating non-Jewish practice.  Shut Chatam Sofer, Choshen Mishpat #191).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In summary, he states that that B'nai Yisra'el were tested 10 times (The Mishnah lists all 10) but they weren't punished for any of them except for the incident with the spies, because this was Lashon Hara.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the Mishnah, he states, that this is a <em>kal vachomer</em> we should learn, that if G-d punished for Lashon Hara about a parcel of land that has no mouth to speak to defend itself, how much more so must we be careful about speaking Lashon Hara against another person that <strong>can</strong> speak!</p>\n\n<p>I would take this idea a bit further - G-d promised our forefathers not only that B'nai Yisra'el would inherit the land of Israel as an eternal inheritance, but He made sure that this land was a beautiful land flowing with milk and honey. Furthermore, the original idea was that G-d was to banish all the inhabitants for us, so that we could just come and live there without having to fight any wars to gain that land. In short, the land was a beautiful gift. And, B'nai Yisra'el <strong>dared</strong> to speak Lashon Hara about that land. Essentially, they \"bad-mouthed\" a gift, and the essence and very \"reason\" of their own existence! That sounds like not just a crime worthy of serious punishment, but a self-inflicted punishment! Essentially they rejected the gift given to them in a personal way to the ONE that gave them the gift. Thus, they weren't worthy of having that gift.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A couple of things come to mind.

It was only the subsequent mercy of Hashem that their children at least got to go in.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that this would be similar to \"nullifying a prohibition <em>ab initio</em>,\" which is generally forbidden. Perhaps the Star-K wants to prevent this <em>ab initio</em> violation, but rather than get into the complications of intent and timing, just say \"should not\" (which is weaker than \"may not\" in the previous sentence) regarding the action that it's prohibited to intend - the final reheating in the opposite-oriented pot.</p></li>\n<li><p>If I'm right that this is the Star-K's source for advising against reheating in the milk pot, they might say that the spaghetti and pot are both fine after the fact, but they don't want to rule accordingly in a lay-person's guide to prevent the <em>ab initio</em> violation. If this reheating did happen, the cook could consult a rabbi, who would rule that the food and pot are permitted.</p>\n\n<p>At least one additional consideration is whether the pot had sat idle for 24 hours since the last time it was used to cook dairy. Rabbi <a href=\"http://hamodia.com/features/day-history-24-avaugust-20/\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Ortinberg</a> of Berditchev (d. 1910) in <em>Tehila L’Dovid</em> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8003&pgnum=70\" rel=\"nofollow\">YD 20</a>)<sup>2</sup> qualifies<sup>3</sup> the ruling mentioned above, saying that if the milk pot had sat idle, then it is permissible to re-heat the spaghetti in it on purpose. </p>\n\n<p>There may well be other considerations.

Logically that would make sense too, since the reason behind the prohibition of eating nat bar nat that was cooked in a pot of the other min is because we view the act of cooking as a nat rishon and not nat bar nat, thus it would make sense that taking that food that's nat rishon and cooking it in other min's pot would be problematic as well, since obstensibly we view cooking with the other min as eating it with that min itself, so it would follow that cooking it with the other min would be tantamount to mixing it with the other min which is clearly prohibited according to the Rama. This is the view of the Yad Yehuda, although he only hints at this.</p>\n<p>However, you are right that this is not at all obvious, since one can argue that all that was prohibited was to mix food that was cooked in a fleishig pot with actual dairy products, and that itself is only a stringency, to say that one can't cook that in a pot of the other min would be a stringency upon stringency. Indeed the R' Akiva Eiger in his notes (printed on the side in most modern editions under the name of השמטות) is unsure about this, but seems to say in the end that this is actually permitted. A clearer source on this is the Chamudei Daniel (Basar Vechalav din 37) which also clearly permits this. Hope that answers your question.</p>\n\n\n",

HaShem's action as they pertain to B'nei Yisrael). For this reason we switch off been the two - we first thank HaShem for the miracles, then the salvations, then the wonders, then the battles (separate question why we thank HaShem for battles at all...) This back and forth works even when we include all of the 'additional' words which are only mentioned in <em>Al hanisim</em>.</p>\n<p>However, in <em>Haneiros Halalu</em>, we are talking about the candles, which are mainly supposed to signify and advertise the miracle.

In context of the Chanukah story, this refers to the minor battles fought by the Chashmonaim, starting with the uprising in Modi'in and the subsequent skirmishes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>נסים are miraculous events that are clearly supernatural.

This refers to the discovery of the single cruse of undefiled oil, something that could be written off as sheer luck but was extraordinary under the circumstances.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Based on this, perhaps we can say that each tefilla prioritizes different words to highlight different events. Al Hanisim is primarily a prayer of thanks for our triumph against the wicked Greeks and Hellenists, therefore it prioritizes נסים and תשועות in reference to the military victories. Haneiros Halalu, on the other hand, is a song about the menorah lights, so it emphasizes נסים and נפלאות in reference to the discovery of the oil and its longevity.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>They're basically the same, both are four, just the first list doubles each of the first three expressions in praise and in kabbalistic style.</p>\n<p>Both sequence of four like most fours, such as the Holy Name, are the aspect of Abba Imma Zeir Nuqba.</p>\n<p>I would guess that the first one in the Amida is the paradigm but the second one is another paradigm.

(<em>though if someone suspects that they suffer from chronic insomnia, they should see a sleep specialist after Shabbos</em>)</p>\n\n<p>The rules for מיחוש בעלמא are found in chapter 1 of that work; the most basic rule being that one may not do anything medical about it, though there are exceptions to this rule.<br>\nHere are some relevant excerpts:</p>\n\n<h3>Chapter 1, section C/a:</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some Poskim permit the use of medicines on Shabbos for persons suffering from painful ailments if the person crushes the medicine into a food or drink before Shabbos. The medicine in the food or drink must be dissolved in the food before Shabbos, and must be undetectable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein, however, was skeptical of this היתר, only allowing it in certain instances. (אגרות משה או\"ח ח\"ב, סי' פ\"ו)</p>\n\n<h3>Chapter 1, section e/6 (Sleeping Pills):</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some Poskim permit insomnia sufferers to take a sleeping pill on Shabbos, because a sleeping pill does not heal.<br>\n  Other Poskim liken a sleeping pill to medicine, and prohibit it, unless the lack of sleep would debilitate the sufferer to the extent that he would be Incapacitated (חולה שאין בו סכנה), in which case taking medicine is permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One more thing: if something is a regular food item, it doesn't count as a \"medicine,\" even if it has medicinal properties, as per <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1596\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 328</a>:37.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now, as for your specific questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Valerian tea -- <strong>allowed</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm not quite sure if this is a tea that's drunk by healthy people....there are many types of tea I have never heard of, so let's assume that it's normal to drink.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>powder and tablets -- <strong>allowed (some opinions)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is something medicinal, so it would be allowed according to the \"some Poskim\" cited by Rabbi Bodner above, though all agree that if the patient were to become a חולה שאין בו סכנה due to sleep deprivation, that he would be allowed to take this medicine.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>muffin -- <strong>allowed</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Even according to those opinions that insomnia cannot be treated medically on Shabbos, if it's baked into food before Shabbos, then all agree that it's fine, provided that the medicine is not detectable. See the discussion of crushing medicine into food or drink, above.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>melatonin patch -- <strong>allowed</strong> (conditions apply)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A patch that slowly releases medicine is allowed to be used on Shabbos, because the גזירה against medicines on Shabbos was only ever against administering medicine on Shabbos, and not against medicine working on Shabbos (Bodner, page 12). So if the patch was put on before Shabbos, there are no issues with it. Assuming no other Shabbos rules are violated, putting on a new patch should be the same as powder and tablets, discussed above.<br>\nBut besides for the medical aspect of putting it on), putting on and taking off patches are complicated issues. Not knowing much about the makeup of melatonin patches, I would suggest that they should be dealt with in the same manner as band-aids -- opening a paper package is okay for a מיחוש, but the paper protecting the sticky part may be problematic, so that should be taken off before Shabbos, if possible (re-sticking it on is fine, because un-sticking it a second time is not a problem); however, if it wasn't prepared before, it may be taken off. It is preferable not to stick a band-aid to itself. It's also preferable not to remove it, if it might cause hairs to rip out; however, if it will cause pain, then it's okay to take it off. (Bodner, 328-330)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Page number references are in</em> Halachos of Refuah on Shabbos <em>by Rabbi YP Bodner, Jerusalem 2008</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Shmirat Shabbat K'hilchatah 33:16 writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מי שמצטער הרבה מחוסר שינה, מותר לו לקחת כדורי-שינה.</p>\n  \n  <p>Someone who suffers greatly from lack of sleep (insomnia) is allowed to take sleeping pills.

The fact that it's herbal and nonprescription doesn't change its halachic status.

They tell the same exact story but one says Hashem incited David to count the people and the other says Satan incited David. Is this a contradiction? In christianity (or messianism) it would be. But Jews have always known that Satan is not an antagonist to Hashem, but is one of his messengers who is also subservient. Since he is doing what Hashem told him to do, Samuel refers to his a actions as actions directly of Hashem.

Is this story found in non-Chabad Chassidic works?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I can answer the second question. I don't know if or how other Chassidic groups address it. The story is found in a letter written by the Baal Shem Tov printed in Keser Shem Tov (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=3719&st=&pgnum=3&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> it is in a decided non-Chabad print - it was <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=3719&st=&pgnum=1&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">printed by</a> someone from Apt who apparently wouldn't consider himself a follower of the Maggid of Mesritch, let alone Chabad).</p>\n\n<p>However reading the full story as described there, the Chabad interpretation is decidedly interpretative, not straight forward (it takes the principle and extends it beyond its original expression). Rabbi Sholom Ber Weingarten (a Chabad Shliach in Kansas) lays out the argument <a href=\"http://www.haoros.com/Archive/index.asp?kovetz=827&cat=7&haoro=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The full story:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושאלתי את פי משיח אימתי אתי מר והשיב בזאת תדע בעת שיתפרסם לימודך ויתגלה בעולם ויפוצו מעיינותיך חוצה מה שלמדתי אותך והשגת, ויכלו גם המה לעשות יחודים ועליות כמוך, ואז יכלו כל הקליפות, ויהי' עת רצון וישועה, ותמהתי ע\"ז והי' לי צער גדול באריכות הזמן כל כך, מתי זה אפשר להיות, אך ממה שלמדתי בהיותי שם, שלשה דברים סגולות, ושלשה שמות הקדושים, והם בנקל ללמוד ולפרש, ונתקרר דעתי וחשבתי אפשר שעי\"ז יוכלו גם אנשי גילי לבוא למדריגה ובחינה כמותי, דהיינו בהיותם יכולים לעלות וילמדו וישיגו כמו אני, ולא נתנה רשות כל ימי חיי לגלות זאת, ובקשתי עבורך ללמד אותך ולא הורשיתי כלל, ומושבע ועומד אני על זה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Baal Shem Tov asked Moshiach when he will come, and the answer was when your teachings will be publicized and revealed in the world, and your wellsprings will spread out what I taught you and you understood, and they will be able to effect supernal unities and elevations like you are. Then all negativity will be destroyed and it will be an opportune and redemptive time.</p>\n\n<p>The Baal Shem Tov himself was very pained by this answer until he received three Segulos and three holy names that are easy to teach and explain that would enable this, but he was not given permission to reveal them yet. (Presumably he never did).</p>\n\n<p>The argument made by Rabbi Weingarten essentially is that the study of Chassidus in a way that is intellectually understood (the Chabad Chassidus approach) substitutes as a way to create these unities and accomplish this goal.</p>\n\n\n",

Typically such equipment includes a plain metal pot (for boiling water and grain), a wort chiller (copper tubing placed in the pot through which cold water is run), glass carboys (for fermenting), glass bottles (eventually, for bottling the finished product), and various dedicated plastic or rubber items like siphon hoses and fermentation locks.

On the other hand, there might be leniencies <em>bedieved</em>, just as the rabbis instituted the sale of <em>chametz</em> rather than destroying it, for reasons of economics or waste.</p>\n\n<p>I know a convert who was in this situation and was told no, but no reasoning was given and I think the equipment had been used for wine too, not just beer and mead.

A\n  comparative analysis of the two narratives reveals a number of\n  linguitic and content parallels that lead Cassuto to the conclusion\n  that in chapter 38, Yehuda is being punished measure for measure (מדה\n  כנגד מדה) for his flawed behavior in chapter 37:</p>\n  \n  <p>מה שהביאני לידי דעה שאין להפריד בין הפרשה שלנו (פרשת יהודה ותמר)ובין\n  מה שקדם לה הריהי ביחוד העובדה כי בין מעשה תמר ויהודה וביןמכירת יוסף יש\n  להכיר מעין קשר פנימי המשתקף בהקבלת הניבים המורים על אותם הפרטים.[1]</p>\n  \n  <p>What has brought me to the view that our chapter (the story of Yehudah\n  and Tamar) cannot be separated from what preceded it is the fact that\n  there is a kind of internal connection between the episode of Tamar\n  and Yehudah and the episode of the sale of Yosef. This is reflected in\n  the parallelism between a number of details in one episode to details\n  in the other…</p>\n  \n  <p>Cassuto’s use of the concept “measure for measure” is reflected in the\n  following Midrash (Bereshit Rabbah 85:9), which he cites:</p>\n  \n  <p>וישלח יהודה את גדי העזים ביד רעהו\" (בראשית לח:כ): …התורה היא משחקת על\n  הבריות. אמר הקב\"ה ליהודה: \"אתה רמית לאביך בגדי עזים, חייך שתמר מרמה בך\n  בגדי עזים.</p>\n  \n  <p>And Yehuda sent the young goat in the hand of his friend” (Bereshit\n  38:20): … The Torah mocks mankind. God said to Yehudah: “You deceived\n  your father with a young goat, by your life Tamar will deceive you\n  with a young goat.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Because Yehudah and his brothers stained Yosef’s coat with the blood\n  of a young goat in order to trick their father into believing that\n  Yosef had been killed, Yehudah was tricked by Tamar with a young goat.\n  This is but one of the parallels between the two narratives that\n  support Cassuto’s interpretation. The following are a number of\n  additional corresponding elements in the two stories:</p>\n  \n  <p>ויהי כאשר בא יוסף אל אחיו ויפשיטו את יוסף את כותנתו…</p>\n  \n  <p>(בראשית לז:כג)    </p>\n  \n  <p>ויגד לתמר לאמר הנה חמיך עלה תמנתה לגז צאנו. ותסר בגדי אלמנותה… (בראשית\n  לח:יג-יד)</p>\n  \n  <p>And it was told to Tamar saying: “Behold your father-in-law is going\n  up to Timna to shear his sheep.” And she removed her widow’s garments\n  …</p>\n  \n  <p>(Bereshit 38:14)  </p>\n  \n  <p>And it was when Yosef came to his brothers, and they removed Yosef’s\n  coat from him…</p>\n  \n  <p>(Bereshit 37:23)</p>\n  \n  <p>וישלחו את כתונת הפסים ויביאו אל אביהם ויאמרו זאת מצאנו הכר נא הכתונת\n  בנך הוא אם לא.</p>\n  \n  <p>(בראשית לז:לב)    </p>\n  \n  <p>הוא מוצאת והיא שלחה אל חמיה לאמר לאיש אשר אלה לו אני הרה ותאמר הכר נא\n  למי החותמת והפתילים והמטה האלה.(בראשית לח:כה)</p>\n  \n  <p>When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law saying: “By\n  the man to whom these belong I am pregnant.” And she said: “Identify\n  please whose are these signet, cord and staff.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Bereshit 38:25)  </p>\n  \n  <p>And they sent the coat of many colors and brought it to their father,\n  and said: “This we have found. Identify please if it is the coat of\n  your son or not.”</p>\n  \n  <p>(Bereshit 37:32)</p>\n  \n  <p>This comparison indicates that the deceptions in the sale of Yosef and\n  the story of Yehuda and Tamar were parallel from beginning to end. It\n  is interesting to note that the following Midrash, found in the\n  Schechter Genizah, also utilizes the parallel appearance of the young\n  goat to explain the sale of Yosef as a “measure for measure”\n  punishment for Ya’akov:</p>\n  \n  <p>\"וישחטו שעיר עזים\"(בראשית לז:לא): משלם הקב\"ה לבני אדם מדה כנגד\n  מדה,ואפילו לצדיקי עולם משלם מדה כנגד מדה. יעקב אבינו רימה באביו\n  בעורותגדיי עזים ובניו רימו בו בגדי עזים... (תורה שלמה, וישב לז:קפא)</p>\n  \n  <p>And they slaughtered a young goat (Bereshit 37:31) - God repays man\n  measure for measure, and even pays the righteous of the world measure\n  for measure. Our father Ya’akov deceived his father using the skins of\n  a young goat, and his sons deceived him with a young goat …(Torah\n  Shleimah, Vayeshev 37:181)</p>\n  \n  <p>Conclusion</p>\n  \n  <p>A combined look at the commentaries on the stories of Yosef and\n  Yehudah reveal an important common thread between the two events –\n  that both stories must be viewed from both the human and Divine\n  perspectives. Each story involves a drama in which human frailty leads\n  to tragedy, and confrontation with that frailty leads to regeneration.\n  In both stories, as well, the human drama unfolds within a larger\n  picture that is driven by a Divine plan. As such, we can understand\n  that ultimately from these two episodes emerged the two redeemers of\n  Israel – Mashiach ben Yosef, and Mashiach ben David.[2]</p>\n  \n  <p>[1] קסוטו, ב. ד., \"מעשה תמר ויהודה\" בציונים, הוצאת אשכול, ברלין תרפ\"ט,\n  דפים 93-100.</p>\n  \n  <p>[2] There is a tradition among Jewish thinkers that there will be two\n  stages to the messianic redemption involving the advent of two\n  messianic figures – Mashiach ben Yosef and Mashiach ben David.\n  Mashiach ben Yosef is described as a warrior who will effect the\n  national reunification of the Jewish people prior to the arrival of\n  Mashiach ben David.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Identity of the Serpent\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there a consensus on whether the serpent in the Garden of Eden was Satan or not? Is it possible that the application of the word serpent is an adjective? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First let me briefly address your use of \"Satan\".  Another religion has an idea of \"Satan\" as being an evil godlike being or angel, one who is locked in a struggle with God between good and evil.  That idea is not really part of Judaism.  There is a <em>role</em> of \"the satan\", which might not always be filled by the same entity, but this is a servant of God, just like any of the other divine messengers we see throughout the Tanakh (and midrash(.</p>\n\n<p>Now, about the serpent, the plain meaning of the text, both at the beginning of B'reishit 3 and later in the chapter when it receives its punishment, is that it is an animal.  Sure it's a <em>talking</em> animal, but we don't actually know if that was unusual in the garden.  But there is nothing in the text (the <em>pshat</em>, or plain reading) to suggest that it's anything other than one of the animals created that week.</p>\n\n<p>I checked several <em>chumashim</em> and found only one reference to the satan.  According to the Soncino Chumash (ed. A. Cohen), Sforno says that the serpent is evocative of the satan.  He doesn't (according to this tertiary source) say that it actually <em>is</em>; he just draws the comparison.  I have not chased the reference.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8167#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">understands</a> the serpent to have certain human traits (jealousy, in particular), but says nothing about it being anything other than an animal.  Chumashim I checked included other comments from Ibn Ezra and the Ramban but neither raised any connection to the satan.  (I realize that argument from omission is weak.)</p>\n\n<p>I haven't addressed the last sentence of your question because I don't understand what it means.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If I may post an answer to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/40977/snakes-talking\">a similar question</a>, there are different approaches within Jewish tradition as to the identity of the biblical serpent. (The first three here are quoted by the Ibn Ezra)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It could be that the snake in the story is not literally a snake,\nbut a metaphor for the Satan, or some similar evil force. This is the approach taken by r. Ovadia Seforno, that the serpent is the evil inclination. According the Gemara Bava Basra (16a), the evil inclination (יצר הרע) is equivalent to Satan, and several <em>midrashim</em> see to take this approach as well. However, this approach is difficult to read into the actual verses, as the Ibn Ezra himself notes, and he rejects this opinion. The Seforno's position is discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/48298/sforno-on-the-nachash\">here</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Chava was a wise enough person to understand snake language (a\nparselmouth, בלע\"ז)</p></li>\n<li><p>R. Saadia Gaon says that an angel spoke for the snake, even though\nthe 'evil plan' or whatever it was that he did wrong was his own\nfault (the angel just helped give him a voice)</p></li>\n<li><p>Ibn Ezra himself does believe that pre-tree snakes could talk, and\nthough he doesn't mention this lack of punishment, he might reply\nthat by losing his ability to eat normal food and walk on 'legs' are\nsymbolic of becoming less human-like and indicate a loss of the\nability to speak as well.</p></li>\n<li><p>Abarbanel writes that the snake never actually spoke, and though the\nTorah states that he spoke, it means that he gestured in way that\nhis message to Chava was obvious (such as by continually eating from\nthe tree, and shoving Chava into it, etc.)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Although the expression \"Holy Spirit\" occurs in Ps. li. 11 (LXX. πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον) and in Isa. lxiii. 10, 11, it had not yet the definite meaning which was attached to it in rabbinical literature: in the latter it is equivalent to theexpression \"Spirit of the Lord,\" which was avoided on account of the disinclination to the use of the Tetragrammaton (see, for example, Targ. to Isa. xl. 13).

It appears that whoever told me that was mistaken. :)</p>\n\n<p>I ran some code (using my <a href=\"https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal-js\">JavaScript Hebcal API</a>) and discovered that in the 100 years from 5700-5800, Miketz is not on Chanukah 10 times. In 5703, 5706, 5710, 5730, 5733, 5737, 5757, 5761, 5781, and 5784, Miketz fell out on the 4th of Tevet, just after Chanukah ends.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Supplemental to the answer, above, that lists the specific years, here's the general scenario:</p>\n\n<p>The months of Cheshvan and Kislev can have either 29 or 30 days, each, and there are 3 configurations. To understand when and why they occur, see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#Deficient.2C_regular.2C_and_complete_years\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Wikipedia article</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Briefly, if the 1st day of Rosh Hashannah occurs on Shabbat, and the year is \"deficient\", meaning that Cheshvan and Kislev have 29 days, then the 1st day of Chanukah occurs on Friday, and the last day is on Friday, also.</p>\n\n<p>In such situations, Shabbat Chanukah is Vayeshev, thus \"freeing up\" the haftarah for Miketz being read, as it is no longer Chanukah. As listed above, this is a rare occurrence, but if you can wait 6 years, you (and your family) will be rewarded to see and hear it happen. (I'm selling tickets for this event :-) </p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, two other rare occurrences happen whenever the 1st day of Chanukah is on Friday:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>10 Tevet is also on Friday</li>\n<li>The next Pesach will be on Sunday</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I did a luach chart for this. </p>\n\n<p>When Rosh Hashanah falls on Shabbat, Simchat Torah is a Sunday (or Shabbat in Israel) so B'reishit is a whole week later, the latest date it call fall. When Rosh Hashanah (and thus Shmini Atzeret) is on a Thursday you start reading B'reishit at an earlier date.</p>\n\n<p>When Rosh Hashanah is on Shabbat (or Monday) you never get 29 days Cheshvan and 30 days Kislev. They are either both long or both short. When Rosh Hashanah is on Tuesday you always have 29 days Cheshvan and 30 days Kislev. When Rosh Hashanah falls on Thursday, if it is to be a 13 month year, it is like Shabbat and Monday: always both long or both short, but in a 12 month year it is either both long or \"regular\" i.e. Kislev will always be 30 days and Cheshvan could be 29 or 30. This year is one such year.</p>\n\n<p>All this means that Rosh Chodesh Kislev is never on Shabbat (whether it is 1 day or 2) and Chanukah is never Tuesday to Tuesday (thus the 5th day is never Shabbat) but can fall on any of the others.</p>\n\n<p>At this point we don't care whether or not the year will have 13 months, except that we know when Rosh Hashanah is on Thursday we get 3 possibilities, other years only 2.</p>\n\n<p>So for a table:</p>\n\n<p>Rosh Hashanah on Shabbat, B'reishit 29th Tishri, Rosh Chodesh Marcheshvan is Sunday and Monday, Chayei Sarah is 4 weeks later thus 27th Marcheshvan, Rosh Chodesh will start Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>If 30 days then Tuesday and Wednesday, Toldot will be the first sedra read in Kislev either way, either on 4th or 5th, then 3 sedras later is Vayeishev which is 25th or 26th of Kislev and Mikketz will be 7 days after that, 8th day Chanukah or day after (if on Shabbat Kislev will be 30 days, 2nd Tevet, if 29 day Kislev so will be 4th Tevet. Asara Be'Tevet is never Shabbat so 3rd Tevet also can't be). Asara B'Tevet will fall either on Friday (short months) or Sunday (long months).</p>\n\n<p>When Rosh Hashanah begins on Monday, we read B'reishit on 27th Tishri, Rosh Chodesh is Tuesday and Wednesday, Chayei Sarah is 25th Marcheshvan, so if 29 day Kislev we find Toldot is read 3rd Kislev otherwise 2nd. If 29 days, first day of Chanukah will be Sunday otherwise Monday and Miketz which is 4 sedras after Toldot will be read on Chanukah. If 30 + 30 then on first day Rosh Chodesh, if 29+29 then on 2nd Tevet, but penultimate day. Asara B'Tevet will be Tuesday if 30+30 and Sunday is 29+29.</p>\n\n<p>Rosh Hashanah on Tuesday means we always get 29 day Cheshvan, 30 day Kislev. B'reishit 26th Tishri, Rosh Chodesh Wednesday-Thursday and Chayei Sara 24th Marcheshvan, Toldot 2nd Kislev then as above on a 30+30 year, Miketz always on first day Rosh Chodesh. Asara B'Tevet will be a Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Rosh Hashanah on Thursday: Most complex case. Noach is Rosh Chodesh Cheshvan 2nd day, Toldot is erev Rosh Chodesh Kislev which is either 1 or 2 days (i.e. you can have 29+29, 29+30, 30+30). If Cheshvan is 29 days Kislev starts on a Sunday, 25th Kislev is a Wednesday like this year and Miketz is 4 weeks after Toldot which is 28th Kislev. If Cheshvan had 30 days, Monday is also Rosh Chodesh, first day of Chanukah is a Thursday. 3rd day (27th Kislev) is Miketz. Rosh Chodesh Tevet will either be Monday only (29+29), Monday-Tuesday (like this year, 29+30) or Tuesday-Wednesday(30+30) so Asara B'Tevet can fall on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. Note that 29+29 is only an option in 13 month year, 29+30 in 12-month years (like this one).</p>\n\n<p>I do not think Miketz is the least frequently read Haftarah however. Vayakhel and Pinchas are. They are only read in 13-month years when Rosh Hashanah fell on Thursday. The fact that has happened 4 times in the last 10 years makes it feel more frequent than it actually is.</p>\n\n<p>In Israel, Tazria can be read with 5 different haftarot. But only with 4 different ones outside. (In Israel Tazria can be erev-Rosh Chodesh Iyar when Pesach starts Shabbat). However its own is read more frequently than the others mentioned. (Also accompanied by haftarot of Metzorah, of Rosh Chodesh and Hachodesh and in Israel Machar-Chodesh)</p>\n\n<p>A little chart now: the day Rosh Hashanah fell (2,3,5 or 7), number of days in Cheshvan (29 or 30), number of days in Kislev (29 or 30), number of months (12 or 13), the last year it happened (this year being included in it).</p>\n\n<p>If I knew how to do a proper table on here I would. I may revisit in a special \"Luach\" topic.

(So it's obvious why it can't go Tuesday back to Sunday but not obvious why you can't have Tuesday->Tuesday).</p>\n\n<p>A 29-30-12 year goes back 3 days. This shows why it can only be Tuesday->Shabbat or Thursday->Monday. </p>\n\n<p>A 29-30-13 year goes back 1 day, so can only be Tuesday->Monday. </p>\n\n<p>A 29-29-12 year goes back 4 days (or forward 3) so is Shabbat->Tuesday or Monday->Thursday. </p>\n\n\n",

The rabbis offer several interpretations (recorded in various places in the talmud and collected in Vayikra Rabbah, a midrash collection).</p>\n\n<p>On 2:23: Rabbi Akiva sticks close to the text, saying that they died because they offered \"strange fire\", which he does not define. Rabbi Yose says they died because they drew near to God; they entered the holy of holies at a time other then when service was commanded, as it is written: \"When they drew near before the Lord and died\" (Lev 16:1).</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Eleazar agrees that they died for drawing near; further, he says, the \"strange fire\" was not the fire from the continual offerings but was ordinary \"secular\" fire. (To use a modern analogy, instead of taking a flame from the continual fire kept for that purpose, they pulled out matches and started their own.) R. Eleazar doesn't bring a source for this.</p>\n\n<p>Bar Kappara, in the name of R. Yirmiyahu b. R. Eleazar, said they died on account of four sins: drawing near, offering (when not commanded), the strange fire (offering the wrong way), and for not seeking counsel of each other (acting on their own initiative without checking). Another interpretation, noted by R. Yishmael among others, is that they were drunk at the time, because immediately after this incident the torah admonishes Aharon to not enter the sanctuary after having drunk wine. This is explained in Vayikra Rabbah 12:1 (as translated <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9911#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is analogous to a king who had a faithful attendant. [When he found him standing at tavern entrances, he severed his head in silence and appointed another attendant in his place. We would not know why he put the first to death, but for his enjoining the second thus, “You must not enter the doorway of taverns,” from which we know that for such a reason he had put the first one to death. Thus [it is said], “And fire went forth from before the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord.” But we would not know why they [Nadab and Abihu] died, but for His commanding Aaron, “Do not drink wine that will lead to intoxication.” We know from this that they died precisely on account of the wine. For this reason Scripture showed love to Aaron by directing the divine utterance to him alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whatever their error, Vayikra Rabbah 2:23 also notes that God was grieved by their deaths; this wasn't wrathful punishment but unfortunate consequence. This is the meaning of \"Through them that are nigh unto Me I will be sanctified\" (Lev 10:3).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What did Levites do before they turned 30?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The book of B'midbar (Numbers) tells us that the Levites served in the temple from either the age of 25 (8:24) or 30 (4, various verses), until they were 50. What did they do the rest of the time? Did they have regular jobs?</p>\n\n<p>(This question came to me in email and I'm answering here instead of just answering the person who asked me.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Babylonian Talmud, in Tractate Chullin (24a), notes this contradiction in starting age and reconciles it by saying that Levites entered training at 25 and began to serve at 30. (From this we learn that if we don't see signs of progress with a student in 5 years, we don't expect him to succeed.) However, this restriction applied only to the <em>mishkan</em>, the portable sanctuary in the wilderness, because then the job of being a Levite included constructing and assembling the structure. But in the temple, the Levites' duties aren't so physical; they involve singing and assisting the priests. The talmud learns that this applied only in the wilderness from Num 4:47 -- \"to do the work of service and the work of bearing burdens\".</p>\n\n<p>Chullin also addresses the upper boundary, saying that Levites in the temple (but not in the wilderness) continued to serve so long as they kept their singing voices. The importance of the voice is derived from II Chron 5:13 -- \"And it came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one loud sound\" -- this is talking about the Levitical choir.</p>\n\n<p>But we still have a problem: there were way more Levites than Levitical jobs. And further, the Levites were given cities throughout the land of Israel, but commuting to Jerusalem each day wouldn't have been practical. If they all served in the temple and lived in Jerusalem then what about their cities, and if they lived in their cities then what about the temple service? The talmud (Ta'anis 4:2 (26a in the Bavli)) says that they and the priests were <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/8177/472\">divided into rotations</a>, so any given Levite didn't work all year in the temple. Therefore (to get back to your original question), it's not just a question of what he did in his youth and old age -- <em>most</em> of the year he wasn't working in the temple, so what was he doing?</p>\n\n<p>This is speculation, but the fact that the Levites were given cities (instead of land for larger-scale agriculture) suggests that they had ordinary occupations in those cities, probably including teaching torah. Their cities included surrounding fields, so some (smaller-scale) agriculture was also possible. Levites too young or too old, or disqualified due to disabilities, or ones not currently serving would all go about their non-temple lives.</p>\n\n<p>Finally (h/t Fred for pointing this out), the Rambam (Sh'mita v'Yovel 13:12, based on Deut. 33:10) says that the Levites were tasked with teaching HaShem's \"upright ways and righteous laws to the public\".  This could obviously be done anywhere there are people, which certainly includes the Levitical cities.</p>\n\n\n",

The situation was that people were having a lot of guests for Shabbos and wanted to leave beverages in their car to keep cold. He said it was fine as long as this procedure is followed correctly. Of course the light must be disabled. The door itself is part of a <em>kli shemilachto li'issur</em> and the door has this din. As such, it can be moved <em>litzorech gufo umikomo</em>, for its use or to use the space it occupies. Therefore, it is muttar to open it, as the space it occupies is needed to pass through to get to the beverages. Closing it needs a haarama, a legal trick. One should place themselves in a position where they need to walk in the space where the open door is, and use that as a pretext to close it.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: This was the answer I wrote for the original question. As per the clarification in the question, I would add that such an act would seem to qualify as moving 'meichamma li'tzel', a protective act for the item which is assur to do with a kli shemilachto li'issur. Unless of course a good pretence is found.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein addresses this (Igros Moshe O\"C vol. 5 letter 21:11 [translated]): </p>\n\n<p>\"It appears that....it is permitted to open a car door and take out what you need (as long as no light is activated thereby). It appears to be permissible to close the door afterwards as well. For a car is not muktzah because when it is parked in his property, the owner often stores things in it....even in a place where people would be surprised/dismayed to see him open a car door on Shabbos, if they won't see him do it, it is not forbidden to do so.\"</p>\n\n<p>His reasoning would seem to be based on the principle (found in Shulchan Aruch Harav 308:22 and in Mishna Brurah 308:26) that when something that should be muktzah currently contains the type of non-muktzah item which is frequently stored there, the muktzah object becomes tafel to the non-muktzah item and can be moved. </p>\n\n<p>So in your specific case that you want to prevent burglary, presumably there are items being stored in your car, which would render the car halachically non-muktzah. However, it must be noted that you may only open and close the door if **a)**no electrical activation will occur, and **b)**noone is looking. </p>\n\n\n",

The hospital would do genetic tests to determine whether the baby was genetically female or male.

These tests obviously did not exist at the time the torah was given, would the presence of a penis or a vagina render the child male/female (in terms of halacha) irrelevant of the genetic test results or would halachic follow the genetic makeup rather than an external sign.

If he did so, his lighting is invalid (<em>Shaar Hatziyun</em> 672:4).</p>\n\n<p><em>P'lag hamincha</em> is defined (<em>MB</em> 672:3, <em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em> 139:10) as a point in time one and one-quarter season-based \"hours\" before <em>tzes hakochavim</em> (when stars come out). That is, divide the length of the day into twelve, choose one of those divisions as an \"hour\", and subtract one and a quarter such \"hours\" from <em>tzes hakochavim</em>: that's <em>p'lag hamincha</em>, the earliest time to light the <em>Chanuka</em> lights.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the practice in the United States, at least, is this: No matter how late you consider the day to start and end for other purposes, you consider sunset as the start of <em>ben hash'mashos</em> with respect to doing <em>m'lacha</em> on <em>Shabas</em>. To put it more simply, no one lights a flame after sunset on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>But some hold <em>tzes hakochavim</em> is quite late! For example, consider Seattle. During <em>Chanuka</em> this year, its day length (sunrise to sunset) is about 8 hours, 25 minutes. Even if we add 72 minutes to the start and end of that for twilight, we have a 10:49-long day; thus, even if we count \"hours\" including twilight, an \"hour\" is only 54 minutes and 5 seconds. People who hold of a <em>tzes hakochavim</em> that's more than 67.5 minutes after sunset have a <em>p'lag hamincha</em> that's after sunset.</p>\n\n<p>When do they light on Friday of <em>Chanuka</em>, and on what basis?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9663&st=&pgnum=307&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mekadesh Yisrael 252</a> discusses this and says that even though in such a situation one will light prior to Plag, there is no choice here and that is what must be done.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>All this applies equally to lighting regular Shabbos candles.</p>\n\n<p>Common practice in America today is to calculate all <em>z'manim</em> based on a sunrise-to-sunset day, except for <em>Sof zman krias sh'ma</em>, so <em>P'lag</em> will always be before sunset.

The wine was not poured as a libation while it was stored or or being brought to the banquet.</p>\n<p>The \"consecrated\" wine used by the church nowadays is never served in any way other than as part of the \"service\".</p>\n<p>Thus we see that the brothers did not have to worry about yayin nesech at that time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Rambam says in a responsum (p'er Hador) that the Avos DIDNT keep the Torah.  THis can also be inferred from his words in the begining of the 9th chapter of hil. melachim (note Lechem Mishnah thereon).\nHowever, rational mitzvos they presumably still kept.  Thus the Rambam's world who are staunchly opposed to drinking (see hil. de'os 5:3, for example) have the problem that the brothers drinking was obscene if not technically forbidden.  Thus R. Avraham Ben HaRambam approvingly cites R. Shmuel Bar Chofni Gaon who explains that they only got a little drunk, but not to the point that they lost the ability to think straight.</p>\n\n\n",

And yet, the Arizal brought quite a number of innovations to our religion. Although none really change halacha, they certainly do build upon it, and require — or suggest - things of people that were never required nor suggested before...

Now we need to do these things, but even the greatest of men from previous generations did not?</p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, once we establish that we should indeed be following the teachings of the Arizal (and to some extant, we all should be) then why do we not actually follow <em>all</em> of the teachings of the Arizal? Why have we only incorporated some of his teachings into mainstream halacha? If the man knows of what he speaks — and let's take for granted that he does — then why are we not following all of his revelations/suggestions? If indeed they come from God Himself (or angels or what-have-you) then why should we not follow <em>everything</em> he recommends?</p>\n\n<p>I should note, I mean no disrespect in this question. Just trying to get a better understand as a thinking, observant Jew.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I am going to answer this question for kabbalah in general sense it answers most of what you ask about the Arizal as well. Typically there are two ways to deal with kabbalistic teachings: to accept them as divinely inspired or as definitely complimenting what is written in Torah shebichtav (Written Torah; Pentateuch) and to deny them as being fallible teachings. I will address the prior method first:</p>\n<p>Kabbalah, or mysticism, is not necessarily a foreign idea to Jewish thought. As an example, the ayin hara (evil eye) is discussed in context of Bereshit 49:22:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בֵּן פֹּרָת יוֹסֵף, בֵּן פֹּרָת עֲלֵי-עָיִן; בָּנוֹת, צָעֲדָה עֲלֵי-שׁוּר.</p>\n<p>Yosef is a fruitful branch; a fruitful branch <strong>alei ayin</strong> by the fountain, its branches run over the wall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The key phrase here is \"alei ayin\" which can be translated as \"above the eye.\" The implication being that Joseph, as opposed to others, was immune to ayin hara. A reference to the (evil) eye is also seen in Bamidbar 24:2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּשָּׂא בִלְעָם אֶת-עֵינָיו, וַיַּרְא אֶת-יִשְׂרָאֵל, שֹׁכֵן, לִשְׁבָטָיו; וַתְּהִי עָלָיו, רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים.</p>\n<p>And Balaam lifted up his <strong>eyes</strong>, and he saw Israel dwelling tribe by tribe; and the spirit of God came upon him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Balaam had previously been known for setting curses on the Emorite cities (Bamidbar 21:27), so the implication is that when he lifted his (evil) eye[s] towards Israel, God protected them from any curse or mystical consequence.</p>\n<p>Kabbalists see the mystical and esoteric as being very real and as being clearly present within the Written Torah. So when they see kabbalistic works introduced, they do not immediately discard it because they accept that kabbalistic teachings and stories do exist within the Torah.</p>\n<p>There are also plenty of references towards mystical concepts in Talmud Bavli like demons, curses, the composition of the soul, et cetera; but, I will forgo this to skip ahead to the most well known kabbalistic work, the Zohar. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zohar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The narrative goes that the Zohar was composed by many rabbonim over the course of many centures, the most important being the Tanna, R' Shimon bar Yohai.</a> To be more technically correct, kabbalists, for the most part, probably do not affirm the texts legitimate off any unbreakable chain of gedolim that preserved its teachings. It appears that they accept Zohar for some a posteriori reason. The reason itself is not nonsense necessarily. They accept Zohar as legitimate and important because it is clearly important to them today. It seems similar to how Yeshayahu Leibowitz treats halacha. He does not keep halacha because of Har Sinai, he keeps it <em>lishma</em>, for its own sake. I am probably being more confusing the clear, so I will stop here and just say that they have <em>reasons</em>. Later, the Zohar was formally published by Moses de Leon and then published for the Jewish world. This work would be the foundation for many of the Arizal's teachings and the Arizal would spend a large portion of his time to this work.</p>\n<p>Now you ask the question, \"...why do we not actually follow all of the teachings of the Arizal?\" One explanation I've been given with halachic teachings in kabbalistic works it that they are really ad hoc explanations given after the fact. For example, the Zohar speaks about the importance of tzniut, in particular hair covering for women, and says something along the lines of, \"[Some] women shave their heads so that not even a single hair shows through their wigs/hair coverings because she will then have good children. But as my friend explained, the Zohar might have just had this explanation to justify the practice in the first place. Or, in other words, the practice was never done for that reason, but that reason was given to justify that practice.</p>\n<p>Obviously, I do not think most kabbalists will agree with that statement, they will say that the Zohar and its teachings did not come after the practice but was born at Har Sinai. So, typically, if I am not mistaken, the reason why many halachic sayings are not kept by many kabbalists is because it is an issue of being machmir. Not everyone can be super frum and be machmir on all the minhagim. For example, there is a minhag within Chabad to abstain from sugar on Pesah because the Rebbe asked for a brick of sugar on the holiday and when his students fetched it for him, he broke open the brick and found a single wheat grain in it. Do all Chabadniks keep this minhag? Of course not and, in fact, I actually know a family where the father and mother do not keep the minhag but their young son does. Not everyone can be as machmir as the Rebbe or as Shimon bar Yohai. They are not breaking a halacha, but there is always room to improve and serve out God's law better.</p>\n<p>Concerning your other question as to whether or not Torah changed, there are many that argue that the Torah we have today is different from Torah from Har Sinai because of scribal errors (I think there are like 7 differences between Sephardi and Ashkenazi Humashim), but these do not change the meaning of the text all that much. The reason why many Kabbalists can accept what Torah says as true while also accepting a somewhat contradictory kabbalistic teaching is because, in part, due to a midrash Bamidbar Rabbah 13:15:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Torah is learned through 70 faces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The classical understanding of this is that there are many different ways to express a truth in Torah and that even if they seem to conflict, they actually may not and the problem may be that we are stuck in a mindset of thinking they must conflict. This is sort of similar to how we treat Braitot that seemingly conflict with mishnayot, Gemara typically first attempts to reconcile the two.</p>\n<p>I will answer the rest of your question as a catch-all before continuing on with my answer of those that deny kabbalah.</p>\n<p>You ask, \"Now we need to do these things, but even the greatest of men from previous generations did not?\" Kabbalists may say that they actually did kept them, but that keeping of the mystical tradition is never mentioned. This is similar to how we hear midrashim explaining how Jacob never lied and that when he said \"Ani Esav Bechorecha\" he was actually saying \"Ani Yaakov, ve'Esav Bechorecha,\" along with other midrashim explaining how Avraham fed his guests milk products first and then meat (as to avoid the prohibition of eating meat and dairy in the first meal). Kabbalists are not defeated in this regard. They can foster many explanations that support their belief that hazal and other gedolim kept these mystical teachings without their keeping ever being mentioned.</p>\n<p>Now to explain those that deny kabbalah. Those that deny mystical teachings will first and foremost say that there are mystical aspects to Torah but that they are hidden from us and that we cannot lust after it. In Devarim 29:28 it states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַנִּסְתָּרֹת--לַיהוָה, אֱלֹהֵינוּ; וְהַנִּגְלֹת לָנוּ וּלְבָנֵינוּ, עַד-עוֹלָם--לַעֲשׂוֹת, אֶת-כָּל-דִּבְרֵי הַתּוֹרָה הַזֹּאת.</p>\n<p>The secret things belong unto the LORD our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The verse here states that knowledge that we can arrive at and are not secret, we can do with as we wish. However, the things which are esoteric, secret, mystical, et cetera are foreign to us and belong to God. It also states in Devarim 18:14:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי הַגּוֹיִם הָאֵלֶּה, אֲשֶׁר אַתָּה יוֹרֵשׁ אוֹתָם--אֶל-מְעֹנְנִים וְאֶל-קֹסְמִים, יִשְׁמָעוּ; וְאַתָּה--לֹא כֵן, נָתַן לְךָ יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ.</p>\n<p>These nations which you are driving out listen to astrologers and diviners. This is not [what God has granted] you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For those that reject kabbalah, the general idea is that we should stay away from mystical teachings because they will distract us and lead us to idolatry. Which is a main position for many people that reject kabbalah. Rambamists, students of R' Jose Faur, those that follow Yeshayahu Leibowitz, \"Rational Jews\", Dor Deah (the Yemenites that rejected the Zohar and other kabbalistic works), et cetera hold that many teachings in Zohar and kabbalah are idolatrous in nature. The obvious ones to note are ayin hara, kaparot, sephirot, certain explanations of verses in Torah (e.g. that we should read Bereshit 1:1 word by word so that \"Bereshit raba Elokim\" literally means \"In the beginning created God,\" implying that God was created.), so on and so forth.</p>\n<p>Those that reject kabbalah will say that we do not find these teachings in any detail in Torah or anywhere in Jewish cannon, that we do not see them in Gemara, and that major kabbalistic works like the Zohar were written in the 12th century by Moses de Leon himself and that ever since his work was published, more and more anonymous rabbis added onto the text. For these individuals, kabbalistic works are not midrashim and they are certainly not Torah. They are made up, brought by foreign sources, and should ultimately be rejected because they encourage idolatrous thinking. So they reject kabbalah and avoid many of your questions by stating that, \"We have Torah, we have halacha, why do we need these mystical teachings that can only confuse Jewish life and ideology?\"</p>\n\n\n",

Meanwhile, the whole time, Shimon was \"in jail\" and they hung around eating.</p>\n<p>How long was Shimon stuck in Mitzrayim (I know that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.42.24?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.42.24&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rashi on pasuk 24</a> says Shimon wasn't in prison but I doubt he was free enough to leave)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.43.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 43:2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.43.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 43:10</a>, after returning from Egypt, the time taken before setting off back to Egypt was enough to go and return twice. If we take this literally, then from leaving Shim'on in prison to returning to get Shim'on out of prison was the time of three journeys (return to Cana'an, there-and-back x 2, travel to Egypt).</p>\n<p>For estimation purposes, I will assume that Yosef lived in On (= Heliopolis ≈ Cairo) and that Ya'akov and his family were in Ḥevron; this gives a travel distance of about 280 miles (you can check that <a href=\"https://www.freemaptools.com/measure-distance.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, assuming that they have to go along the coast for water, cf. <a href=\"https://orbis.stanford.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">travel in the Roman empire</a>). Camel caravans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_train\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">apparently</a> travel between 10 and 25 miles per day, so let's average that to 17.5 miles per day. This gives us a 16 day travel time. If you wish, bump this up to 18 days to include resting on Shabbat, and you have your travel time one-way.</p>\n<p>Since we're interested in six one-way trips, we consider 6 x 16 (or 6 x 18) to get 96 days (or 108 days). <strong>Thus, Shim'on would have been imprisoned for somewhere between 3 and 4 months.</strong> If we instead take Yehuda's words in Gen 43 as hyperbole, then the real number should be less than this.</p>\n<p>Out of interest, at the slowest rate of travel, he would have been imprisoned for as long as 5.5 months (or 6.4 months, if they rested on Shabbat). At the fastest rate of travel, he would have been imprisoned for as little as 2.3 months (or 2.6 months with resting for Shabbat).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the meforshim (Rashi, Rabbi Munk, Rav Hirsch, etc.) Shimon's status was that of \"honored hostage\". An example of this status can be seen from the history of the Roman empire. The hostages were treated as honored \"guests\" with the status of the nobility, except they could not leave. It is not the same as a prisoner.</p>\n\n<p>One of the Ohr Sameach questions on the parsha states that the food finally ran low after they could have gone to Mitzraim and returned two times. It does not give an exact timing of the events (in months).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How long did it take for Yaakov and family to eat all the food that\n  the brothers brought back from Egypt? Give the answer in terms of\n  travel time.</p>\n  \n  <p>43:2,10 - Twice the travel time to and from Egypt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It does not say any more than that.</p>\n\n\n",

I heard that blood is in fact drained by most butchers, although it is probably not done in the way kashering prescribed by the Talmud. I don't know about the fat.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know the answer to the question in the title. Please include facts about non-kosher meat sold in US supermarkets, as well cite solid halacha in order to make a case one way or the other. I hope that eating non-kosher meat isn't an offense on the level of, say, having sex with a menstruating woman, or murder. But I am concerned.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you have something to say about Kareth and how you view it, please include that, because I think it is relevant in view of the following fact: the vast majority of Jews have at some point eaten nonkosher meat, violated a sabbath, or did something else deserving Kareth. Upon realizing the gravity of the sin, is one supposed snap and stop doing it until the rest of their life, and even one infraction causes the Kareth punishment? There are some opinions that a certain amount of fasting and praying removes one punishment, but these seem to be mere opinions, and for some people an entire lifetime of this wouldn't be enough to make up for the amount of sin, so the whole Kareth concept seems to be, like the Christian hell concept, to be confusing and scary.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The issues that might possibly make it liable to \"Kares\" would be blood (dam) or certain fats (cheilev).</p>\n<p>With regards to blood, not all blood carries a Kares penalty although it is all biblically prohibited. See <a href=\"http://www.oocities.org/tbrunete/eating.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Prohibition Of Eating Blood</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kares, is incurred for blood that issues during karbanot, piercing or decapitation, as long as there is redness in it, and so to blood gathered in the heart. This too is lifeblood when it pours forth, therefore penalty over it occurs.</p>\n<p>This means specifically when it pours out, excluding what drips or flows lightly at the beginning of the bloodletting and at the end, which is not lifeblood: no punishment of kares applies here.</p>\n<p>Blood of limbs and organs such as blood of the spleen and of the kidneys: no penalty applies over it, but only whiplashes. This only applies if the amount of an olive is eaten.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With regards to Cheilev (fat), it has to be the forbidden fat parts and then you have to eat an olive size of it to get Kares and you have to know it's Cheilev, although you'd be liable to a Korban Chatas if you ate it thinking it is Shamen (permitted fat).</p>\n<p>At least we can be certain that meat sold in US supermarkets is not <strong>Nossar</strong> (meat from a sacrifice where the sacrifice went perfectly but the time to eat it has now expired) or <strong>Piggul</strong> (meat from a sacrifice that, at the time of sacrifice, the kohen sprinkling the blood or the person who offered it has the intention that it would be eaten after its expired time.

Someone asked me if this \"valley of darkness\" is metaphorical or physical and, either way, what it refers to more specifically.  I consulted Rashi on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16244#showrashi=true&v=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tehillim 23:4</a>, who says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>in the valley of darkness: Heb. צלמות, in a land of darkness.

However you can sell it in bulk as wholesale, and what the retailer does with it is not your concern. I may not <em>enable</em> a non-Jew to worship idols, but I may enable the enabler. (That's indirect enough.)</p>\n\n<p>It then tells the story of a rabbi who sold firewood to a pagan temple, and was challenged by a colleague about this. He replied that most firewood consumed by that temple would simply be used to heat the building, not in any pagan ritual.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch quotes this law, and then adds -- \"and therefore, don't sell water to a church that will use it for baptisms.\" We see that <em>generally</em>, the rule of \"don't sell pagan supplies\" was applied to churches as well (well at least Orthodox and Catholic churches -- Protestants is a different question entirely). (Though there may have been leniencies about this as well.)</p>\n\n<p><em>However</em>, it's then observed that there is a very strong opinion that the only problem is <em>enabling</em> when I am the only supplier around. If instead of buying from me, the pagan could buy from some other frankincense supplier, then I'm not truly \"enabling\", and it would be permissible.  </p>\n\n<p>In todays' markets, it's virtually unheard-of that my refusal to sell a product will actually prevent them from acquiring it from someone else. Hence selling it would be \"facilitating\", but not \"enabling.\" Most rabbis conclude that \"facilitating\" is not ideal, but it's allowable.</p>\n\n<p>Thus -- as long as there's some other wine they could buy, I'm not prohibited from selling it to them.</p>\n\n<p>(I once witnessed a Catholic woman enter a candy store and say she needed any sort of candy so long as it was red, it was \"for the saints.\" I asked a rabbi about this -- he said firstly, we don't necessarily know what \"for the saints\" means; and secondly, we can rely on the opinion that it's allowable if there's some other place in town to buy red candy.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I just read \"The Golem of Prague\" by Gershon Winkler, which is based on \"Niflaot Maharal: HaGolem MiPrague\" published based on the manuscript of the Maharal's student and son in law, Rav Itzhak ben Shimshon HaCohen Katz. There's a story in there about Jews selling wine to Christian priests ... it leads to them hatching a plot to convert the Jewish girl managing the winery, but there's no mention of it having been a prohibited activity. The book does include other explanations of things that are halachic, and also doesn't mention the Maharal objecting. So that's not conclusive, but slightly indicative. If you looked at the original text, perhaps you'd have some better insight. </p>\n\n\n",

Sometimes in other areas (if I am recalling correctly)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>According to this source:\n<a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5761/kedoshim.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5761/kedoshim.html</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The majority of eggs, however, do not contain blood. Accordingly, one is not required to inspect an egg to see if there is blood in it, since we can assume that this egg is like the majority of eggs, which are blood-free(3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As variable 3 above, whenever I have bought kosher certified organic or free range eggs almost every single egg had a blood spot (pretty sure they were always A grade). I called up the OU last year and they said it was because the hen is still kosher. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/articles/eggs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kashrut.com/articles/eggs/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the times of the Gemorah,3 blood appeared in eggs because of two reasons: 1. The egg had been fertilized and a chicken embryo was being produced. 2. An irregularity in the hen causes a small amount of blood to be deposited in the egg.\n  In the United States, the government requires that Grade A and Grade AA eggs be checked for blood spots, through a procedure called candling. During the candling, the eggs are held before a light in a dark room allowing any blood spots to be easily detected. Accordingly, the chance of finding a blood spot is rare.4</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the quote there should be an irregularity in the hen which causes the blood. \nBut if that is indeed so why is it usually found in the organic and/or free range egg variety? </p>\n\n<p>I think OU is a wonderful organization but still I'm not satisfied with the answer I got in this situation. I still stay away from organic or free range eggs because it's just wasting money when I have to throw most out. </p>\n\n<p>I believe they want the ultimate burden of checking to fall to the consumer still. As that was the impression I got when I called the OU(although I could be mistaken). But if the majority have blood what is the point of certifying them when the consumer usually has to discard the majority of eggs or for Jews less educated in Halacha \"sin\" by eating them?</p>\n\n<p>To clarify what I am asking:  </p>\n\n<p>Why do the majority of organic and/or free range eggs contain blood? Is it from an irregularity in the bird or dare I say fertilization? \nIf all the above is true why are these eggs still certified Kosher? </p>\n\n<p>To say because the hen is kosher seems like a cop out.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I should probably mention it's probably not just OU. I would guess it may be any kosher certified egg in this situation, although I only recall just buying OU certified eggs.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As observed in the comments -- egg farmers \"candle\" an egg by shining a bright light through it to check for blood spots. This works better with white eggs, which are more translucent than brown ones. So if you buy a dozen white eggs at the store, it's more likely they caught the blood spots at the factory and they didn't make it to the shelf.</p>\n\n<p>In short -- have you controlled for egg color? </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.egglandsbest.com/eggspert/eggs/brown-spots.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a> it says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>About 25-30% of brown eggs, irrespective of brand, typically have what are referred to as pigment or protein spots next to the yolk or floating in the albumen. If you look very closely at white eggs, you will see that they have similar particles of protein floating around, but the hens lack the brown pigment in their system that combines with the protein to make them stand out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A Ruv also told me that even by fertilized eggs it is considered <strong><em>blood</em></strong> <strong>only</strong> if it is \"black\" or \"red\" (brown is ok)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The OU has <a href=\"http://oukosher.org/blog/kosher-professionals/eggs-and-blood-spots/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an article</a> addressing spots found in eggs. Of note, it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Today, however, the only concerns are maris ayin or dam beitzim (a small amount of blood from a broken blood vessel in the hen, which is not forbidden). As a result, the entire egg is never assur and mei’ikar hadin removal of the blood spot would suffice ... Rav Moshe, however, writes that it is a proper practice to dispose of the entire egg even today, as eggs are not expensive and a person does not incur any significant loss.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And more significantly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By far the most common blemishes found, these are formed by a microscopic “seed” of foreign matter that enters the egg during the early stages of development. Though found in both brown and white eggs, they are more prevalent in brown.</p>\n<p>o Generally, these look like thick clear jelly in the egg white and may be any size. If the “seed” speck is visible, it looks like a reddish brown piece of dirt at the center of the spot.</p>\n<p>o When appearing on the egg yolk, one generally only sees the “seed” speck.</p>\n<p>Whether in the white or yolk, these blemishes present no halachic concerns and the eggs may be consumed without further action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is quite possible that this what you are seeing, not real blood spots (see the article for how a true blood spot looks). It would also be worth re-contacting the OU and finding out if their certification means you don't have to check the eggs. I know another certification that certifies raw eggs and what they are ensuring is that there are no roosters on the farm (which is the common practice anyway). The certification doesn't really change anything with regards to checking eggs.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why Does the Rambam Assert That It Took Eight Days To Obtain Pure Oil?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n\n<p>In a previous post regarding the quantity of oil sufficient for one day’s lighting of the Menorah the answer given was the quantity of oil is more than one liter, but not more than two liters per day, hardly a large amount.  I have a one liter bottle of olive oil in my pantry, and a four liter can in the basement.  </p>\n\n<p>This response raises a question:   </p>\n\n<p>The Rambam – Laws of Chanukah 3:2, states that it took eight days to press and extract pure olive oil.</p>\n\n<p>והדליקו ממנו נרות המערכה שמונה ימים עד שכתשו זיתים והוציאו מן טהור…</p>\n\n<p>…and they lit the arranged (?) lamps from it for eight days until they pressed olives and extracted pure oil.</p>\n\n<p>Eight days is very long time to obtain a relatively small quantity of oil (16 liters maximum for 8 days).  Theoretically in 165 BCE, you did not have to go far to find jars of oil.  Ramat Rachel, a few miles south of Jerusalem, historically was a collection and distribution center for oil and wine for 100’s of years (Taxes and tribute were paid in oil and wine). </p>\n\n<p>My question then is: Where was the Rambam coming from that eight days were required? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the Beis Yosef in siman 671 they needed to go through the tahara process of para aduma which took seven days and one more for the oil making.

Now, i know shemoneh esrei by heart, and even <em>yaaleh v'yavo</em>, but not <em>al hanisim</em>. Luckily, i had a siddur in my pocket (no, not a smartphone), and was able to read from it. But that made me wonder: What if i didn't have the text?</p>\n\n<p>If i would not have been able to say <em>al hanisim</em> due to not knowing it by heart, <strong>would it be better to say shemoneh esrei in the proper time without <em>al hanisim</em>, or miss mincha, and daven <em>tashlumin</em> at maariv, with the proper additions?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What about <em>yaaleh v'yavo</em>? The difference is that if <em>yaaleh v'yavo</em> is forgotten, the shemoneh esrei must be repeated, while that is not the case with <em>al hanisim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid working around the question: There's no mincha minyan available, no siddur or any text available, and no time to go look it up.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rav Shlomo Zalman was asked what should one do who does not have a siddur available and it is shabbos or yom tov,and he only knows the weekday shmoneh esrei by heart.Rav Shlomo Zalman answered that he should say the weekday shmoneh esrei with yaleh v'yavo,and if it is just shabbos he should say the weekday shmoneh esrei and say yaleh vyavo and insert \"ba'yom ha'shabbos ha'zeh\".</p>\n\n<p>Text of V'aleiu lo Yibul :</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/azFWV.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/azFWV.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I once heard that there was a situation in Russia years ago when things weren't so nice there, and some Jewish people were taken away to Labour Camp or whatever they used to do.</p>\n\n<p>There were a group of them and they didn't have a siddur and it was Shabbat Rosh Chodesh. Nobody knew the Ata Yatzarta prayer by memory but would know the regular \"Tikanta Shabbat\".</p>\n\n<p>A Rabbi present, told them to daven with Tikanta Shabbat because, as he put it \"the lack of a Rosh Chodesh sacrifice would not invalidate the Shabbat sacrifice\".</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if they should end the bracha with the Rosh Chodesh addition or not (M'kadesh Hashabat v'rashei chodashim).</p>\n\n<p>In any case, as Al Hanissim is something you say l'chatchila but b'di eved if you missed it you do not need to repeat, it makes sense to assume you should daven without out rather than not daven at all if you don't know it by memory.</p>\n\n<p>A supplementary question might be whether to recite the opening section (up to \"bizman haze\") which is probably commonly known enough that you would know that part by memory, or whether that would be considered an interruption in absence of the full addition.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Logically, it doesn't make sense to not <em>daven</em> because you don't know <em>al hanisim</em> since you wouldn't repeat <em>shemoneh esrei</em> if you forgot it (i.e. it's not <em>me'akev</em>). By <em>tefillos</em> that are <em>me'akev</em> such as <em>yaaleh v'yavo</em> by <em>shacharis</em>/<em>mincha</em> on <em>rosh chodesh</em> (or even <em>ma'ariv</em> on <em>chol hamoed</em>), I don't have a source but (again logically) if one knew enough hebrew to compose a brief/abridged mention of the day that would presumably suffice, and I suspect a person's native tongue would probably also work b'dieved (see Sotah 32a), which is the case at hand. In which case there should be no justification for delaying past the zman.  (Arguably, if one did wait intentionally, <em>tashlumin</em> would not even be an available option since he might be considered a <em>meizid</em> if he could have really davened, albeit with an alternate <em>nusach</em>; see also <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=21341\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=21341</a>)  Along these lines, l'chatchila he should presumably compose an alternate al hanisim as well even though it's not me'akev bdieved.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Practically speaking, how should I cover my hair?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I belong to a liberal community where married women do not cover their hair. But occasionally I visit other communities  (generally Modern Orthodox or Lubavich) for Shabbat and I would like to fit in when I do (meaning I don't want to stand out and I don't want to make others uncomfortable).  I do not have the automatic fashion sense that is often ascribed to women.</p>\n\n<p>I've seen women wear scarves, caps that they can tuck their hair into (like <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002C4W0F0\" rel=\"nofollow\">snoods</a>, but solid), and dressier hats that cover some but not all hair.  Assuming that I want to use either a scarf or a cap for simplicity and cost  (I assume the dress hats are expensive), what is the easiest thing that I can do to fit in, with my medium-long hair that I'm not going to cut?  I recently tried to cover my hair with a scarf (tied bandana-style, with the knot behind my neck) but couldn't quite figure out what to do that would stay in place, and it left a lot of hair showing.  The caps I've seen some women wear seem like they'd be big enough to stuff my hair into, but I'm not sure where to shop for that and if there are any tricks to wearing them.  I'm a little too shy to approach random women in Kosher Mart to ask these kinds of questions.</p>\n\n<p>Can somebody help me out with some \"hair 101 for visitors\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.doubleheaderusa.com/results.asp?catid=98\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.doubleheaderusa.com/results.asp?catid=98</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.headcovers.com/headwear/hats-turbans/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.headcovers.com/headwear/hats-turbans/</a></p>\n\n<p>The first website is actually a friend of my wife's so you know, cheep plug. But she really does have a lot of items. The second one is from a quick 'head covering option' search. (Apparantly Jewish women and cancer patients shop for the same items.)</p>\n\n<p>There is always the inexpensive wig option like <a href=\"http://www.paulayoung.com/category/brands/paula+young+wigs.do\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.paulayoung.com/category/brands/paula+young+wigs.do</a>\nSome of the women in my family do that, such as my mother and mother in law. But it's a generational thing. My sister and wife would never. Some of the Lubavitch women are very ritzy dressers so if fitting in is important, you might want to think twice. But from what I've seen, the Lubavitch women in Pittsburgh seem to be down to earth in that respect. </p>\n\n<p>As far as modern orthodox, many women in modern orthodox communities don't cover their hair either so you probably won't stick out or feel uncomfortable going without any covering, but if you are asking this, I guess the crowd you are talking about  either do cover their hair or you aren't sure what to expect. </p>\n\n<p>But the best advise would be to observe and inquire.

Always. Simple is best.</p>\n\n<p>Infinity scarves come in a variety of materials but the easiest ones to use are the stretchy kind. I have a few hundred scarves and they stay in the drawer most of the time. </p>\n\n<p>The only ones I actually wear all the time are believe it or not, from the dollar store. </p>\n\n<p>I have a plain black cotton infinity scarf that I paid three dollars for and I can wear more than a few interesting ways.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly it can be put over your head, turned once and looped over again to create an elegant look that leaves a little hair showing. This looks swoopy and has a lovely flowing look.</p>\n\n<p>I also have wrapped it tight from that style into a turban like look just to get everything off my neck on a hot day.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I will cover my head with the scarf and pull it tight around my bunned ponytail looping it like a scrunchie hair tie. It's not a fancy look but it's practical for covering everything nice and tight.</p>\n\n<p>From doing this with a plain cotton scarf I then have the freedom to put a hat on as if the scarf were my own hair. \nI have a few cute hats, a beret, a saucy little derby and one little felt cap that has some pretty little feathers and a bow but honestly let's be real I actually throw on my camouflage ball cap when we go hiking with this style most often. </p>\n\n<p>Tying on a stretchy infinity scarf gives you the same hat options you have without the cover because it acts like your own hair.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the first way of wearing the scarf, sometimes I wear two. For example I do the third style with plain black and then I have a gorgeous long flowery looking scarf I casually wrap around not worrying about what shows because I have the black one on under it. I also have a collection of super cute non stretchy infinity scarves including one full of stars that I absolutely adore. </p>\n\n<p>But my best advice is just play with it. Have fun. Go get some scarves that are neutral and match your favorite clothes. Play with your look until you love it and own it. </p>\n\n<p>Really what you feel good in is the best way for you to go.</p>\n\n<p>If you can't get the hang of infinity scarves don't worry, I also went to an African store which surprisingly sold very cute kippot that fit my son and they often sell what looks like the knee to the thigh of a pair of stretchy slacks. These are my go to when I don't feel like messing around with scarves. </p>\n\n<p>The reason why I'm telling you what they look like is that after buying every print they had I still didn't have a plain black one and plain black is my thing. </p>\n\n<p>You can easily cut off the leg of a pair of tights and sew it at the knee and thigh to make this easy head cover. \nI love to sew and maybe one day I'll whip out a pattern for sewing one from new materials. </p>\n\n<p>I really wish I could show you pictures of all my styles and how easy it is to cover up and look smart.</p>\n\n<p>Best of all aside from being modest and all the benefits of modesty, your hair will thank you. With less environmental toxins, sun bleaching etc. My hair is now healthy and starting to curl again naturally. </p>\n\n<p>For all the efforts, time and money women put into their hair just to abuse it with blow-dryers, curling irons, straighteners, dyes, sprays and Junk it is just so much easier, fun and practical to cover with scarves. </p>\n\n<p>This is my second year covering my hair every day, it takes a while to figure it out , just keep playing with your style, keep it simple, keep it modest. . . And if all else fails pins are your friend. An elegant broach will keep any unruly scarf in place especially on a windy day walking to the shul. </p>\n\n<p>I've got one that says \"Mother\" and a lovely gold rose. Make your look your own. Don't worry about fitting in, you're Jewish be \"Set Apart\" and be yourself. </p>\n\n<p>Hope you have fun trying out some of my scarf styles yourself !</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The easiest option would be a solid snood, but you can also see some <a href=\"https://wrapunzel.wordpress.com/tutorials/the-beginners-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\">easy ways to tie a tichel (scarf) here</a>.

Besides for being an unacceptable interpretation because it makes Yosef HaTzaddik out to be a vengeful person, this also seems textually inadequate, as he wouldn't have tried to imprison Binyamin.</p></li>\n<li><p>R. Avraham ben HaRambam, quoting R. Shmuel ben Chofni, as well as the Ramban and many other commentators, explain that Yosef was trying to make sure that his dreams came to fruition. I used to think that this was a bad explanation, because, as R. Yitzchak Arama points out, how could Yosef cause his family so much pain just because of his dreams? Even if he thought his dreams were divine sings, let God worry about His plans; that shouldn't excuse paining his father for so long! Should Yirmiyahu have destroyed the Temple just because God told him that it would happen?! However, if Yosef felt the dream to be a form a prophecy, then just as a prophet <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%91%D7%A9_%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%95%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow\">has an obligation to tell his prophecy to others</a>, perhaps a prophet also has an obligation to make sure that those prophecies are seen through. Yosef felt that God wanted Him to do this, and as a prophet he was making that judgement as something more important than the mitzvah of kibbud av v'em (much like Avraham understood the prophecy to sacrifice his son as overriding the general prohibition of murder)</p></li>\n<li><p>R. Yitzchak Arama, Abarbanel, and R. Hirsch (though there are important nuanced differences between these three commentators) basically understand that Yosef was trying to put the brothers in a position to do <em>teshuvah</em>, to repent for their selling of him, by causing them to regret their deeds and ultimately put them in a position where they would have to defend one of their brothers (i.e. Binyamin). This position is expounded upon and defended <a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/archive/parsha65/10-65miketz.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">by R. Yaakov Medan, here</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Bechor Shor (36:26, 42:7) writes that when the brothers decided to sell Yosef instead of killing him, they did so on condition that he swear to them that he never reveal to their father how he landed up into slavery. Yosef thought that his brothers would also never tell their father that he is alive even if he revealed himself to them right away as viceroy of Egypt, and so he had to come up with an elaborate plan to force the brothers into telling Yaakov that Yosef became ruler of Egypt. </p></li>\n<li><p>R. Shimon Schwab in Me'ein Beis HaSho'eivah gives what I think is a very beautiful explanation. Yosef knew about the prophecy given to Avraham, that his decsendents would be 'strangers in a foreign land', and that those foreigners would enslave and oppress Avraham's offspring. Yosef, realizing the divine Hand that caused him to sit on the Egyptian throne, understood himself to be the vehicle through which Yaakov and his family would descend to Egypt. He thus devised a plan: he - and his children after him - would play the part of an evil, oppressive king, to fulfill the prophecy, but would all the while be secretly looking out for the benefit of B'nei Yisrael. This way, they would indeed be oppressed strangers, but in a land where the ruler <strong>actually</strong>, secretly, had their best intentions at heart, because he'd be one of them. This plan failed when Yosef became so overcome with emotion that he knew he couldn't go through the rest of his life putting on a facade of hatred every time he faced his brothers. </p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/parsha.61/11vayiga.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Yoel bin-Nun</a>, of Yeshivat Har Etzion, has a novel approach that was roundly criticized and garnered considerable debate when he published it in their first volumes of the <em>Megadim</em> journal. He suggests that Yosef was afraid that perhaps, like Yishmael and Eisav before him, his father Yaakov had actually rejected him and sent him away, never to take part in the heritage of Avraham and Yitzchak. Thus, he thought Yaakov might have been 'in' on the plan, and didn't reveal himself until he heard from his brothers that Yaakov was actually mourning for him for all these years. (While very creative, it's hard to read this into the pesukim)</p></li>\n<li><p>Several non-religious bible critics have understood that Yosef felt estranged from his long-forgotten family, and had little desire to reconnect with them, as he associated his entire family with his own painful past. The only exception was Binyamin, and he had devised a plot to 'kidnap' Binyamin so that he and the only brother that he loved could live in Egypt, far away from his former family. (The problems with this explanation are too numerous to list)</p></li>\n<li><p>R. Chanan Porat had another interesting suggestion: Yosef thought that his father and brothers had already forgotten about him, had moved on with their lives, and were happy with how it all turned out. At great personal sacrifice, Yosef thought that he should do whatever he could to remain 'dead', not to ruin the lives of his family members that they had recreated. I don't really understand how he explains Yosef's motivation for hiding his goblet in Binyamin's sack, though</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/9652294993\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Ari Khan</a> has another novel explanation, built upon midrashim (and, it seems to me, similar to that of R. SR Hirsch). As summarized <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2011/10/biblical-creativity/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, his interpretation is that Yosef was trying to elicit 'brotherly feelings', so that they would come to accept him once he did reveal himself - or better, if he would convince them to start inquiring about 'that Hebrew slave'. \"Yosef was not looking to exact revenge on his brothers but to remind them that there was someone they had forgotten; he wanted them to seek him\". </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(numbers 5,6, and 7 came from <a href=\"http://vbm-torah.org/archive/parsha73/10-73miketz.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/50813/11501\">Matt's answer</a> is most complete. Allow me to take a different angle building on a dvar Torah I wrote in honor of my older son's bar mitsva this shabbat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I think the reason Yosef causes so much anguish to his family is to get to one thing.</strong> He knew he and his brothers would be the fathers of the entire Jewish people, that all Jews would inherit their traits of character. <strong>But he realized there was a big flaw in them: a lack of brotherly love, a lack of ahdut (unity).</strong> He could not imagine that they could be the source of the Jewish people with such a flaw and wanted a tikun (reparation). <strong>So all he does is to force them to correct this major shortcoming, to force them back into ahdut.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>How do we know this is Yosef’s goal?</em> Because as soon as he reaches it, as soon as Yehuda tells Yosef that he will not give away Binyamin, Yosef starts to cry and reveals himself to his brothers. </p>\n\n<p><strong>This cry of Yosef is key.</strong> It is not so much a cry of joy, after all how could Yosef’s joy be complete when he hasn’t yet seen his father? I don’t think it is a cry of sadness either. It is the sort of cry that we feel when we touch something very deep, very pure, when we feel something new being created, for instance when we want to cry at a brit mila, when we feel the kdusha (sanctity) of a new Jew coming into the brit (alliance), or at a wedding when we feel the love of a new couple being born. In Yosef’s case this was the cry of feeling the ahdut of the Jewish people being created.</p>\n\n<p><em>How do we know this?</em> I think we can learn it from <strong>another cry of Yosef</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.43.29?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">a few psukim earlier</a> when Yosef met Binyamin. Rashi explains that Yosef asks Binyamin if he has sons. Binyamin answers yes, 10, and <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.46.21?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Torah gives their names</a>: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, etc. When we read these names we wonder why the Torah brings them, but Rashi and the Midrash tell us that Binyamin explains that each name represents a way for Binyamin to remember his brother Yosef. <em>Bela shenivla ben umot haolam</em>, <em>Becher shehaya bechor leimo</em>, <em>naaman shehaya naim beyoter</em>. Every time Binyamin looked at his sons, he remembered the brother he hadn’t known. And all 10 sons of Binyamin together represented for him his brother Yosef. When Yosef hears that he starts crying, of the cry of one who feels what real love is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So in a nutshell the anguish was justified to create the required unity in Joseph's family - and should be a model for us of the required ahdut in the entire Jewish people.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do brachos on seeing have to be made within four amos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there any source that says that in order to make a bracha for seeing e.g., a sage of Israel, a sage of the nations, or an unusual animal, one must be within four amos of the person/thing? \nI found that the Aruch Hashulchan (Orach Chaim 234:8) says that when making a bracha on a Jewish graveyard, one should do so within four amos, but that if one is unable, he can make the bracha as long as he can see. Does the preference for four amos apply to all such blessings? And is there a source for this ruling? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I found the following teshuvah by R. Betzalel Stern, BeTzel HaChochmah 2:16: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Regarding someone who travels by airplane from Australia to Israel,\n  and on the way flies over mountains and deserts...In my humble\n  opinion, it seems obvious that as long as he has a clear view, even\n  though he only sees them from a plane flying miles above, he is\n  obligated to make the appropriate blessing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He brings a number of proofs for this: in the laws of Purim, one who can see the city is considered part of the city, even from a distance; the prohibition to recite holy matters in the presence of an ervah exists as long as one can see the ervah, despite the distance; and the halachah regarding Mishkan Shiloh that one can eat kodshim as far as one can see it. </p>\n\n<p>The ruling of the Aruch Hashulchan about Jewish graves seems to be based on the following: Although the Talmud Bavli says that this blessing is made by one who \"sees\" the graves, the Yerushalmi (Brachos 9:2) does not mention seeing but instead says \"one who passes through\" a graveyard. If so, it isn't seeing that obligates one to make a bracha, but actually passing through. The Aruch Hashulchan translates this into an ideal requirement of proximity of within four amos. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Difference between books called \"Shulchan Aruch\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Can someone explain the difference between these four books called \"Shulchan Aruch\"?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Shulchan Aruch stam</li>\n<li>Shulchan Aruch Habahir</li>\n<li>Aruch haShulchan</li>\n<li>The Tur Shulchan Aruch</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 32)\n\n<p><strong>The Shulchan Aruch</strong> was written by Rabbi Yosef Karo in the mid-sixteenth century. That is the reference to #1 (\"stam\" means plain, without any additional qualifications. Since then, others have appropriated the name or made names that have allusions to it, when writing books which have a similar purpose - to structure and organize Jewish Law into a relatively terse guide). It is generally printed with commentaries around the main text, and is as well known for those commentaries as for the main text.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shulchan Aruch Habahir</strong> is a specific, recent, reprint of the Shulchan Aruch with commentaries that uses its own pagination format. It is an attempt at making a more readable page, but it contains fundamentally the same information as other prints.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aruch haShulchan</strong> was written by Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein in the late 19th century. It is a more comprehensive but not as widely-regarded-as-authoritative work (although some do indeed regard it as such, just not as many as would regard the Shulchan Aruch itself that way). It also follows the organizational pattern of the original Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tur Shulchan Aruch</strong> is a print that combines the Tur with the Shulchan Aruch. The Tur is the originator of the organizational format used by the Shulchan Aruch, and was written by Rabbi Yaakov Ben Asher in the early 14th century. R. Karo wrote a commentary on it, called the Beis Yosef, which formed the basis for his later work, the Shulchan Aruch. </p>\n\n<p>Because the organization method is the same, it fits naturally to print the two together, and due to the terse nature of the Shulchan Aruch itself, having the Tur and the accompanying Beis Yosef near by helps to elucidate the context of the Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of other prominent texts with the name Shulchan Aruch are:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</strong> by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi written in the late 18th century and published after the author's death in the early 19th century. This follows the organizational structure of the Shulchan Aruch and is more detailed in providing the reasons behind each ruling (following more the style of the Tur than the Shulchan Aruch in that sense), however much of the original manuscripts were lost in a fire, so its coverage is sporadic, with most of what remains focused on the first of the four sections of Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</strong> by Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried was written in the later part of 19th century. It starts a new format and was composed in a very terse format for the layman, and picks the relevant sections of Jewish Law that a layman would focus on. This format has made it a very popular starting point for a student first delving into Halachic works. It has several prints that put in references to other Halachic works like the Mishna Brurah, the Shulchan Aruch HaRav and one with notes by former Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu who references the later Sefardi decisions in these areas.</p>\n\n\n",

I've heard there are a number of opinions on this: what are their sources? \nI've heard that Chasidim don't study anything Xmas night as well as the 6th of January. Is it just Christmas night or day as well?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Nitei Gavriel which @yishai linked has an abundance of info of the customs and history of nittal nacht.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Aviner brings a nice summary from his tshuvot (text):</p>\n\n<p>\"Question: Is it permissible to learn Torah on \"Nittel Nacht\" (Christmas Eve)?</p>\n\n<p>Answer: There is a custom among some Chasidim not to learn Torah on \"Nittel Nacht\" in order not to contribute positive spiritual powers to idolatry. The Lubavitcher Rebbe related in a talk in the name of his father-in-law, the Rebbe Rayatz, that the 5th Lubavitcher Rebbe, the Rebbe Rashab, played chess on \"Nittel Nacht\" (Parashat Vayeshev, 1st Night of Chanukah 5750). And this was indeed the custom of the Lubavitcher Rebbe until midnight of \"Nittel Nacht\" (see Sha'arei Halachah U-Minhag vol 3 pp. 64-67.  There is a famous picture of the Lubavitcher Rebbe and his father-in-law, the Friediker Rebbe, playing chess on Nittel Nacht). But our custom is that one needs to learn Torah on that night, just like every night. Some explain that the reason for not learning Torah of that night is that the Christians would become impassioned on their holiday, would go out and kill Jews (Ta'amei Ha-Minhagim p. 500). We therefore would need to stand guard instead of learning Torah (Ta'amei Ha-Minhagim p. 500). Baruch Hashem, Christians do not act this way today and we need to learn a lot of Torah.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, it is told in the book \"Siach Sarfei Kodesh\" (p. 192) that when the last Lubavitcher Rebbe was sitting shiva, the Satmar Rebbe, Ha-Rav Yoel Teitelbaum, paid a shiva call and asked him: Why do we observe the night of \"Nittel Nacht\" according to the non-Jewish calendar (which is forbidden) instead of according to the Jewish calendar? The Lubavitcher Rebbe answered that we do not learn on that night in order not to give spiritual strength to the god of the Christians and we therefore observe it on the night that they celebrate, which is according to their calendar. And – he added – we must therefore be aware when they celebrate this holiday in the place we are located. In most places, their holiday is on December 25th, but it other places it is on a different day (For example, January 6th). In such places, that is the night of \"Nittel Nacht\".</p>\n\n<p>But as we said, our custom is to learn a lot of Torah on that night. And Ha-Rav Moshe Sternbuch wrote that this custom was unknown in Lithuania and it is only a custom among Chasidim (Shut Teshuvot Ve-Hanhagot 1:551). The Chazon Ish would learn on \"Nittel Nacht,\" and said that it was forbidden to waste time from learning on this night and he criticized those who did not learn on that night. The Steipler Gaon would also learn on \"Nittel Nacht,\" but did so by heart so as not to upset those who have the custom not to learn. The Steipler Gaon also requested not to be informed when Nittel Nacht is so that he would not have to waste time from his learning (Orchot Rabbenu vol. 1 p. 193). And Ha-Rav Ovadiah Yosef has written that no such custom exists among Sefardic Jews (Shut Yabia Omer vol. 7 Yoreh Deah #20). The Lubavitcher Rebbe also writes that this custom does not exist in Eretz Yisrael (Sha'arei Halachah U-Minhag ibid. p. 67), even though it seems that some do have this custom in Eretz Israel.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Netai Gavriel <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46444&st=&pgnum=394\" rel=\"nofollow\">brings</a> just about all there is to bring on the subject of Nitel. In 2:4 he brings two/three customs about the time of day or night it applies to. Although the custom is (perhaps more commonly) only from sunset or dusk until midnight, some (Chernobler, Belz, Bobov, Ger and Galitziyana) start from midday the day before (so that would be represented as the 24th midday until midnight - although the Stotshtein custom is to do that for both the 24th and the 6th).</p>\n\n<p>In addition (2:1), there is a custom that varies the exact time of Nitel based on the season (Tekufas Teves), however there is no overlap between the two groups in those customs, so no one combines them.</p>\n\n<p>So the upshot is any practice of Nitel by day is going to be from midday December 24th or January 6th at the earliest, and everyone stops by midnight (at least vis-a-vis learning Torah).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The answer is slightly different. It is a Jewish custom to learn Torah on the birthday or Yahrzeit of the deceased.  So it became the Jewish custom not to learn Torah so as not to give the appearance of learning on behalf of Jesus on his birthday (which of course, Christmas is not--it was a pagan holiday long before Jesus that Christians adopted as a way of integrating Pagans into Chritianity).</p>\n\n<p>Another strange custom that one sees among the very Orthodox is to write the word Christmas as Xmas.  They dont realize that X was the Greek letter 'chi' which was written by Christians for \"Christ\" because of their regard for the holiness of the word.  Just as we write H for the name of God.</p>\n\n\n",

But presumably while Joseph was alive he didn't allow for this to happen, which made the Israelites stand out as being \"above\" the native Egyptians who all became slaves and were moved around based on the government policy of Joseph.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.47.12-27?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 47:12-27</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יב  וַיְכַלְכֵּל יוֹסֵף אֶת-אָבִיו וְאֶת-אֶחָיו, וְאֵת כָּל-בֵּית\nאָבִיו--לֶחֶם, לְפִי הַטָּף.  12 <strong>And Joseph sustained his father, and\nhis brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to\nthe want of their little ones.</strong> יג  וְלֶחֶם אֵין בְּכָל-הָאָרֶץ,\nכִּי-כָבֵד הָרָעָב מְאֹד; וַתֵּלַהּ אֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם, וְאֶרֶץ כְּנַעַן,\nמִפְּנֵי, הָרָעָב.    13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the\nfamine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan\nlanguished by reason of the famine. יד  וַיְלַקֵּט יוֹסֵף,\nאֶת-כָּל-הַכֶּסֶף הַנִּמְצָא בְאֶרֶץ-מִצְרַיִם וּבְאֶרֶץ כְּנַעַן,\nבַּשֶּׁבֶר, אֲשֶׁר-הֵם שֹׁבְרִים; וַיָּבֵא יוֹסֵף אֶת-הַכֶּסֶף,\nבֵּיתָה פַרְעֹה.  14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was\nfound in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn\nwhich they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.\nטו  וַיִּתֹּם הַכֶּסֶף, מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם וּמֵאֶרֶץ כְּנַעַן,\nוַיָּבֹאוּ כָל-מִצְרַיִם אֶל-יוֹסֵף לֵאמֹר הָבָה-לָּנוּ לֶחֶם,\nוְלָמָּה נָמוּת נֶגְדֶּךָ:  כִּי אָפֵס, כָּסֶף.   15 And when the money\nwas all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the\nEgyptians came unto Joseph, and said: 'Give us bread; for why should\nwe die in thy presence? for our money faileth.' טז  וַיֹּאמֶר יוֹסֵף\nהָבוּ מִקְנֵיכֶם, וְאֶתְּנָה לָכֶם בְּמִקְנֵיכֶם--אִם-אָפֵס, כָּסֶף.\n16 And Joseph said: 'Give your cattle, and I will give you [bread]\nfor your cattle, if money fail.' יז  וַיָּבִיאוּ אֶת-מִקְנֵיהֶם,\nאֶל-יוֹסֵף, וַיִּתֵּן לָהֶם יוֹסֵף לֶחֶם בַּסּוּסִים וּבְמִקְנֵה\nהַצֹּאן וּבְמִקְנֵה הַבָּקָר, וּבַחֲמֹרִים; וַיְנַהֲלֵם בַּלֶּחֶם\nבְּכָל-מִקְנֵהֶם, בַּשָּׁנָה הַהִוא.  17 And they brought their cattle\nunto Joseph.

Lo, here is seed for\nyou, and ye shall sow the land. כד  וְהָיָה, בַּתְּבוּאֹת, וּנְתַתֶּם\nחֲמִישִׁית, לְפַרְעֹה; וְאַרְבַּע הַיָּדֹת יִהְיֶה לָכֶם לְזֶרַע\nהַשָּׂדֶה וּלְאָכְלְכֶם, וְלַאֲשֶׁר בְּבָתֵּיכֶם--וְלֶאֱכֹל\nלְטַפְּכֶם.   24 And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye\nshall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for\nseed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,\nand for food for your little ones.' כה  וַיֹּאמְרוּ, הֶחֱיִתָנוּ;\nנִמְצָא-חֵן בְּעֵינֵי אֲדֹנִי, וְהָיִינוּ עֲבָדִים לְפַרְעֹה.     25 <strong>And\nthey said: 'Thou hast saved our lives.

His first goal is to keep the Israelites from fleeing their slavery, and taking away their land (one of the only lands suitable for shepherds) would almost certainly do that.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "What primacy to give to learning halacha?",
    "content": "# What primacy to give to learning halacha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Consider a person who follows all of the halachos (he is aware of) that are involved in daily living. Any free time that he has is devoted to learning Torah. This person, however, is not proficient at all in the halachos of Shabbos and is certain to transgress Rabbinic and even Torah law every Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>The question is: Is this person allowed to learn anything other than the halachos of Shabbos until he can for sure keep Shabbos without transgressing any laws? Is he allowed to learn daf-yomi, for example, or learn gemara be'iyun if that means that the time spent learning the gemara will translate into time not learning hilchos Shabbos? </p>\n\n<p>My thoughts are: Maybe this person is only allowed to learn hilchos Shabbos at this point because when he has free time and he is choosing what to learn, if he knows that not learning hilchos Shabbos will (indirectly) cause him to transgress a law, he is responsible now to make sure that does not happen.\nAlternatively maybe he is not obligated to only learn hilchos Shabbos because 1) if such an idea is true I would have expected to see Rabbi's make a point of it, which I haven't and 2) a person is supposed to learn a broad spectrum of Torah (Tanach, Mishna, Gemara, Mussar and halacha lema'aseh).</p>\n\n<p>(I chose hilchos Shabbos as an example. The scenario can easily be played out with any other halachos, e.g. hilchos berachos, tefillah, seudah, richuk min ha'arayos, tznius, Rosh Chodesh, bathroom, not to mention Hilchos BEIN ADAM LE'CHAVEIRO etc. etc. etc.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam in hilchos Talmud Torah says that a person should divide up his time learning into thirds: 1/3 written Torah, 1/3 oral Torah, and 1/3 of understanding how to understand and live Torah, and as far as what is mutar and what is assur. </p>\n\n<p>A person obviously doesn't know all the Halacha of everything all the time, and still, the Rambam says to divide your learning time. While hilchos shabbos are important (as are all other halachos) and you are obligated to learn them, the Torah is broad and you are obligated to know it as well. </p>\n\n<p>So, it seems a person can, and should, have a broad learning seder. As far as transgressing in various area of Halacha, as long as he is not transgressing intentionally, he won't be punished.</p>\n\n<p>To finish off with a quote from Pirkei Avos (2, 16): לא עליך המלאכה לגמר ולא אתה בן חורין לבטל ממנה - it's not upon you to finish all the work, but neither are you a free person to be exempt from it; immediately after this the Mishnah proceeds to discuss Torah and qualify what was being discussed. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Logically, anyone not well-versed enough in the halachos of Shabbos and daily life to avoid regular transgressions should prioritize studying practical halacha. (Keep in mind that studying Chumash with Onkelos (or using Rashi as a substitute for Onkelos) is a weekly halachic requirement.) </p>\n\n<p>However, if studying other subjects (such as mussar or chassidic literature or even gedolim biographies) is needed to give you inspiration and motivation to continue in your path of increasing your observance and Torah learning, then of course that kind of study would be appropriate as well.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, even chassidic sources (which often emphasize the study of mystical seforim) sometimes place great importance on the daily study of halacha. For example, see this extraordinarily emphatic teaching of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov:</p>\n\n<p>\"Every Jew must spend a portion of his time every day studying the law codes. This applies under all circumstances. It is a very serious matter, and no one should ever miss his daily session. Even in an emergency, when he has no time for example, if he is traveling he should still learn at least one paragraph of the Shulchan Aruch, even from so mewhere other than the place he has reached in his regular daily study routine. Do not let a single day of your life go by wihtout studying something from the Shulchan Aruch. Under normal circumstances when you are not under pressure, go through each of the four sections of the Shulchan Aruch in turn until you have finished them all. Then go back to the beginning and start again. Follow this practice all your life. It is a great remedy for all the damage caused by sin. The study of the legal codes sifts the good from the bad. It is the ultimate remedy (Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom 29).\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Using Ethiopian oral law to resolve machloket\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/50880/1713\">This question</a> and particularly <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/50880/ethiopians-and-oral-law#comment134415_50880\">my comment</a> on the question got me thinking. Assuming those who became the Ethiopian Jews received the oral law exactly the same as the rest of Israel, could we potentially use Ethiopian oral traditions to resolve machlokot that arose later in the Tannaic and Amoraic periods and were recorded in the Talmud? If this is theoretically possible, has it ever been done? If this does not work for some reason, why not? </p>\n\n<p>My reasoning, if it's unclear, is as follows. If some point about a Torah law is undisputed in the Talmud, it seems to me that we would have a high degree of certainty that that point was successfully transmitted through the generations without ambiguity. If Ethiopians had a machloket about that point, we would be relatively confident telling them which side is correct. Is this logic reasonable, and does it work the other way around? </p>\n\n<p>I originally neglected to mention that this question only applies to deoraita commandments, and not derabanans. Obviously machloket in derabanans is not a result of ambiguous transmission from Sinai that Ethiopian Jews could plausibly have more clarity on than the rest of us.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Note, I'm assuming that Ethiopean Jews are real and kept up their Torah knowledge throughout their exile.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"http://torahinmotion.org/discussions-and-blogs/eiruvin-4a-measuring\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam</a> (he quotes the Introduction to the Mishna) famously said that if there's an argument about something, it's a clear sign it's not a Halacha LeMoshe MiSinai.</p>\n\n<p>It could be an argument in interpretation or whatnot, but it's not a clear cut Halacha LeMoshe MiSinai. Therefore, their Stam doesn't show anything. It's just that they never saw the other side of the Machlokes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Even if one argues on the above mentioned premise of the Rambam, he also <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/rambam.asp?tdate=12/15/2014&rambamChapters=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">writes</a> (which is something <em>pretty much</em> everyone agrees with, even if there are a few caveats thrown in) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These [principles apply regarding] the judgments, decrees, ordinances, and customs which were established after the conclusion of the Talmud. However, all the matters mentioned by the Babylonian Talmud are incumbent on the entire Jewish people to follow. We must compel each and every city and each country to accept all the customs that were put into practice by the Sages of the Talmud, to pass decrees parallelling their decrees, and to observe their ordinances, since all the matters in the Babylonian Talmud were accepted by the entire Jewish people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So even if the Gemara was wrong, we still have to follow it. Which is why we don't find the Rashba explicitly arguing on Raba, for example.</p></li>\n<li><p>Even among the Tanayim, there were times when the Mishna had a machlokes and the Tosefta was \"Stam\".

As we don't know what's the source of the \"Stam Ethiopeans\" (was it an alternate Mishna or was it a much later decision), we may not be able to follow it. </p>\n\n\n",

R' Yehuda understands that the nature of monetary laws is that they are rights, and that is the reason you can stipulate against them - you are forgoing your own right.  Thus the gemara says that the stipulation against שאר וכסות only works because the bride is מוחל.  But <em>no one</em> was entertaining that you could override a Torah law just because.</p>\n\n<p>The third reason is because every time the gemara is searching for an opinion that holds you can stipulate against the Torah, it only brings Rebbi Yehuda.

The Rambam [...] was of the opinion that even when it comes to liquids, reheating is distinct from cooking. In his view, once a solid or liquid food has been cooked, it can never be “cooked” again in the Halachic sense, even after it has cooled. Although the Shulhan Aruch does not accept this view, we may nevertheless rely on it to permit asking a gentile, such as a non-Jewish housekeeper, to reheat a pot of hot food, as long as the fire is covered or if the pot is placed on an electric hotplate. Hacham Ovadia Yosef, in several contexts, accepts this ruling of the Hid”a.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I am not mistaken, the permissibility of reheating a liquid on Shabbat is a question of if \"yesh bishul ahhar bishul belahh\" (it is possible to recook a liquid after it has already been cooked) and I believe the Halakhic debate on the matter renders the law a Safeq MiDe'Oraita (uncertainty concerning a Biblical law).</p>\n\n<p>I read recently in Yalqut Yosef (Hilkhot Shabbat, Volume 1, though I don't have Siman handy) that asking a Gentile do perform melakhah on Shabbat (e.g. to turn on/off lights) for a Jew's benefit is Rabbinically forbidden. If, for example, it is prohibited to ask a Gentile to turn on/off lights for a Jew's benefit on Shabbat, how is it permissible according to HID\"A and Hakham 'Ovadiah to ask a Gentile to perform a melakhah categorized as a Safeq MiDe'Oraita (i.e. reheating food on a hotplate)?</p>\n\n\n",

This would preclude the title of 'Saint' before the names of these individuals. Exclamations like 'For Pete's sake!' are technically referred to as oaths in language, for all such exclamations are meant to invoke Heaven, Hell, or deity. Hence, I would consider it inadvisable to use such an expression for the usage itself conveys an implied reverence which is inappropriate.</p>\n\n\n",

So everyone is quoting רב. If so, he doesn't spell it out, but the answer to your question would have to be that רבי אילעא's statement is being supported as accurately quoting רב, and given the potentially contradictory statement further on, that becomes an important clarification of רב's opinion.</p></li>\n<li><p>He suggests that רבי אבא's statement ends earlier and the conclusion (that one does not fulfill the obligation) is the conlusion of the author of the ברייתא, not a direct quote of רבי אבא.

However, he doesn't seem to stick with that idea in any event.</p></li>\n<li><p>In a long involved point which I would encourage you to read inside to understand, he says there are two distinct cases going on over here. One is about women being Yotzei men with Birchas HaMazon since they don't have equal obligations in them and the other is the man himself saying his own Birchas HaMazon.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Similar treatment is meted out to an impure kohen who performs the Avodah, by the other kohanim.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַגּוֹנֵב אֶת הַקַּסְוָה וְהַמְקַלֵּל בַּקּוֹסֵם וְהַבּוֹעֵל אֲרַמִּית, קַנָּאִין פּוֹגְעִין בּוֹ. כֹּהֵן שֶׁשִּׁמֵּשׁ בְּטֻמְאָה, אֵין אֶחָיו הַכֹּהֲנִים מְבִיאִין אוֹתוֹ לְבֵית דִּין, אֶלָּא פִרְחֵי כְהֻנָּה מוֹצִיאִין אוֹתוֹ חוּץ לָעֲזָרָה וּמַפְצִיעִין אֶת מֹחוֹ בִּגְזִירִין.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara Sanhedrin 82a says that Pinchas killing Zimri was an example of a zealot killing one who has relations with a non-Jewess.  The Gemara says that had Zimri killed Pinchas he would have been exempt because Pinchas was classified as a “rodef”, and had Zimri ceased his sin and Pinchas still killed him, then Pinchas would have been liable in court for murder (for the exemption of a zealot is only applicable while the sin is being committed; Rashi)\nThe Gemara there also states that we don’t encourage the zealot.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א''ר חסדא הבא לימלך אין מורין לו איתמר נמי אמר רבה בר בר חנה א''ר יוחנן הבא לימלך אין מורין לו ולא עוד אלא שאם פירש זמרי והרגו פנחס נהרג עליו נהפך זמרי והרגו לפנחס אין נהרג עליו שהרי רודף הוא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rosh (9:4) and Ramah (Yad Ramah 82a) rule that only the sinner may kill the zealot.  The Rosh adds that anyone else would be considered a murderer for killing the zealot.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the propriety of this zealotry Rambam comments in Peirush Hamishnayos that if the zealot kills he isn’t punished.  This perhaps implies that the actions of the zealot are b'diavad; not optimal.  However in Mishne Torah (Issurei Biah 12:4) he writes that the actions of the zealot are commendable.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּל הַבּוֹעֵל כּוּתִית בֵּין דֶּרֶךְ חַתְנוּת בֵּין דֶּרֶךְ זְנוּת אִם בְּעָלָהּ בְּפַרְהֶסְיָא וְהוּא שֶׁיִּבְעל לְעֵינֵי עֲשָׂרָה מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל אוֹ יֶתֶר אִם פָּגְעוּ בּוֹ קַנָּאִין וַהֲרָגוּהוּ הֲרֵי אֵלּוּ מְשֻׁבָּחִין וּזְרִיזִין וְדָבָר זֶה הֲלָכָה לְמשֶׁה מִסִּינַי הוּא. רְאָיָה לְדָבָר זֶה מַעֲשֶׂה פִּינְחָס בְּזִמְרִי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Raavad writes (there) that it is only commendable if one warns the sinner first.</p>\n\n<p>כל הבועל עכו''ם וכו'. כתב הראב''ד ז''ל בד''א שהתרו בו ולא פירש אבל לא התרו בו לא אמרינן הרי אלו משובחין עכ''ל</p>\n\n<p>see also discussion <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8799/question-about-the-actions-of-pinchas-when-he-killed-zimri\">here</a></p>\n\n\n",

One way (the correct way, imho) is that the Talmud is citing Megillat Taanit as a brayta and asking what the basis is for Chanukka which is mentioned in Megillat Taanit, and the Talmud answers that it was the cruse of oil. However, another way of parsing the gemara is that the explanation of the cruse of oil is part of the brayta, the תנו רבנן, answering the question of מאי חנוכה.

(<a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2006/11/human-initiative-and-divine-providence.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> is a link to the article on Hirhurim but I think it originally appeared elsewhere, though I can't find it at the moment.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This question has disturbed many religious Jews. In 1969, a student at Yeshiva University asked me whether the miracle was attested outside of the famous Talmudic account, and I replied that it was not. At the time, I did not have a satisfying explanation for this, and one individual took my response as a denial that the miracle occurred. This was not my intention, but this episode along with questions over the years from other Jews perplexed by the problem led me to struggle with it more than might otherwise have been the case. I now believe that I can propose an explanation that is absolutely convincing with respect to I Maccabees and reasonably satisfying with respect to II Maccabees.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>A perusal of II Maccabees demonstrates that miracle stories regarding the Hasmonean revolt and the Temple circulated widely. It is virtually beyond question that the author of I Maccabees heard such accounts, and yet he records none at all. This means either that he did not believe them or that he excluded them as a matter of policy. In either case, the absence of a reference to the cruse of oil--which is troubling only because of the inference that the author never heard the story--poses no challenge to one who believes the account of the miracle on the authority of Hazal. Given the author's consistent historiographic approach, we can be almost certain that he would not have recorded this miracle even if he knew about it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the case of II Maccabees, the argument proceeds not from the absence of miracles but from their prominence. Here the author presents various miracle stories so public and so impressive (including, for example, the public appearance of angels) that the miracle of the cruse of oil, which was witnessed by relatively few observers, pales into near insignificance, and he may well have chosen to omit it along with other \"minor\" miracles. II Maccabees is an abridgment of a five-part work by Jason of Cyrene which has been lost. The full work almost certainly contained miracle stories that were omitted from the abridgment. To us, the story of the oil looms very large. To Jason--or to the man who abridged his work--it may have seemed trivial, particularly since he had an alternate explanation for the decision to celebrate for eight days.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In sum, there are plausible grounds to argue that the authors of both I and II Maccabees could have known the story and nonetheless omitted it from their histories. The absence of a reference in Al ha-Nissim, which is a thanksgiving prayer, need not trouble anyone. The miracle of victory requires thanksgiving; the miracle of the oil does not, and it is appropriately omitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also the many sources collected by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_B._Shapiro\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Professor Marc Shapiro</a> in <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2017/04/the-hanukkah-miracle.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> on The Seforim Blog (some of which argue that the miracle of the oil is in fact ahistorical), and <a href=\"http://dafaleph.com/home/2015/12/8/the-historicity-of-the-miracle-of-oil\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> by Devir Kahan on Daf Aleph.</p>\n\n\n",

Would it be a mitzvah for another person from that foreign community, person B, to help them in fulfilling a minhag?

Not necessarily that it's a good thing or something recognized as a normative value within Jewish life.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Mitzvah and halacha are two very different things... halacha is the law, and mitzvah is the commandment to perform. Halacha gives us the direction in how to perform that mitzvah.  So when you ask, \"is it a mitzvah?\", and then say \"is it halacha?\", that's pretty confusing.  For that reason I'm ignoring the word mitzvah and focusing on halacha, since that's your self-correction. </p>\n\n<p>According to R. Moshe Elefant at the OU, who of course quotes someone else, it depends on whether or not you're just visiting or moving there permanently.  If you're moving there permanently, then you're expected to take on the minhagim of the new community. Otherwise you're expected to maintain the halachic standards of the community to which you still belong.</p>\n\n<p>The wrinkle here -- and there always is one -- is that should your own customs conflict or perchance cause some sort of <em>issue</em> within the community you're visiting, you should take steps to ensure that in your practice you should be discreet to ensure not to upset the community or otherwise be rude.

    "content": "# What does למען mean in Tanach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The word למען appears frequently in Tanach and in prayers. When in prayers, it usually means \"for the sake of\". (e.g. עשה למען שמך). However, the meaning in Tanach is less clear:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לֹא תֹאכַל עָלָיו חָמֵץ שִׁבְעַת יָמִים תֹּאכַל עָלָיו מַצּוֹת לֶחֶם עֹנִי כִּי בְחִפָּזוֹן יָצָאתָ מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם לְמַעַן תִּזְכֹּר אֶת יוֹם צֵאתְךָ מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם כֹּל יְמֵי חַיֶּיךָ (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9980#v=3\">Devarim 16:3</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case it seems to mean \"in order that\" which is similar to the meaning used in prayers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהָיָה בְּשָׁמְעוֹ אֶת דִּבְרֵי הָאָלָה הַזֹּאת וְהִתְבָּרֵךְ בִּלְבָבוֹ לֵאמֹר שָׁלוֹם יִהְיֶה לִּי כִּי בִּשְׁרִרוּת לִבִּי אֵלֵךְ לְמַעַן סְפוֹת הָרָוָה אֶת הַצְּמֵאָה (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9993#v=19\">Devarim 29:19</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here it makes little sense that he's ignoring the <em>Tochacha</em> \"in order to\" have his unintentional sins treated seriously (using Rashi's interpretation). Perhaps here it means \"thereby\" or \"resulting in\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּי יְדַעְתִּיו לְמַעַן אֲשֶׁר יְצַוֶּה אֶת בָּנָיו וְאֶת בֵּיתוֹ אַחֲרָיו וְשָׁמְרוּ דֶּרֶךְ ה' לַעֲשׂוֹת צְדָקָה וּמִשְׁפָּט לְמַעַן הָבִיא ה' עַל אַבְרָהָם אֵת אֲשֶׁר דִּבֶּר עָלָיו (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213#v=19\">Bereishit 18:19</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With regard to the first למען, Hashem knows Avraham, \"thereby\" or \"in order that\" Avraham will command his sons to be righteous? Neither alternative seems logical. Maybe here it means \"because\".</p>\n\n<p>For the second למען, it might mean \"therefore\", similar to the usage in the verse in Devarim 16:3.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, my question is: Does למען actually have a specific meaning? Or is it a multipurpose word, so that it can mean anything to fit the context?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It seems that all your definitions collude with the same single definition - \"as a consequence / result of\"</p>\n\n<p>Let's see how this fits into each of your quoted verses:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Don't eat chametz.

Likewise, one who saves a Jewish soul is considered to have saved the entire world. The Mishnah says that another reason for why man was created alone is so that a person will not say to his fellow man, \"My ancestor was greater than yours.\" The Mishnah gives a number of other reasons.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara (38a) cites a Beraisa which adds more reasons for why man was created alone. One reason is so that evildoers will not say that they are evil because they are descended from an evil person (and use this as an excuse not to repent), and so that Tzadikim will not say that they are the sons of a Tzadik (and use this as an excuse not to avoid temptation to sin).</p>\n\n<p>The YEFEI MAR'EH has difficulty with the entire discussion about why man was created alone. All of the animals also were created alone, just like man. Why, then, should there be any uniqueness in the fact that man was created alone?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ANSWERS:<br>\n  (a) The YEFEI MAR'EH answers that at the time of Creation\n  there was a need for more men to be created in order to settle the\n  world. Had more men been created, the world would have been\n  established without Kayin and Hevel having to marry their sisters.\n  However, because of the reasons given by the Mishnah and Beraisa, it\n  was deemed more appropriate to create only a single man.</p>\n  \n  <p>(b)The MAHARSHA argues that this is not the point of the Gemara. The\n  Gemara is not explaining why other men were not created together with\n  Adam ha'Rishon. Rather, it is explaining why Adam ha'Rishon was\n  created alone and only afterwards was Chavah created from him, unlike\n  the creation of all of the animals, where the male and female were\n  created as separate entities at one time.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to the Maharsha, what does the Mishnah mean when it says\n  that man was created alone (i.e. without Chavah, who was created from\n  him only afterwards) so that a person will not say to his fellow man,\n  \"My ancestor was greater than yours\"? Even if Adam and Chavah had been\n  created as separate beings at the same time, everyone would still have\n  the same ancestors!</p>\n  \n  <p>The Maharsha explains that the Mishnah means that had Adam and Chavah\n  been created at the same time, a person would have been able to say\n  that his traits come from Adam and not from Chavah, while his fellow\n  man's traits come from Chavah, or vice versa, as a person's traits may\n  emulate those of one parent more than the other. A person would say\n  that one of the two -- Adam or Chavah -- was more important, or better\n  than the other, and that he resembles one of them. Since Adam and\n  Chavah were created together as a single entity, no one can make such\n  claims, since all human traits ultimately come from the same source.\n  (The TIFERES YISRAEL seems to include both explanations of the\n  question in his understanding of the Mishnah.)

Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi explains in Likutei Amarim regarding permissible food that at the moment one indulges in a desire simply to satisfy the craving of ones body, the “kelipas nogah”(literally “shell that shines”) representing the positive potential hidden in that moment is lowered into the “shalosh kelipos hatemeos” (literally “three shells of impurity”) indicating the wickedness of the person in that moment. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7886/jewish/Chapter-7.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likutei Amarim chapter 7</a> In the case of Adam and Chava eating from the tree wasn’t even a permissible pleasure. The first sin seems to be a series of  events connected to pleasure: first Adam and Chava where engaged in pleasure that was holy for the sake of propagating. Later they took their pleasurable pursuits a bit too far in an attempt to become their own deities as Rashi explains in Genesis 3:5. This type of arrogance is also a modern day sin. Once they came off their high horse and realized that they neglected the one thing their creator and benefactor requested of them they felt shame, guilt and fear.

    "content": "# When ended Beth Shammai?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am looking for a way to recognize members of the Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel when I learn the gemara and mishna. I need to know when the Beth Shammai ended (as well as the Beth Hillel) to find out if the amoraim quoted in the Gemara were members of one of these two schools or if they were members of no school.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Hillel and Shamai themselves were the last of the Zugot -- pairs of scholars who served as the Nasi (prince) and Av Beit Din (chief justice), respectively. The Zugot are listed in the <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1\" rel=\"nofollow\">first perek of Masechet Avot</a> (Pirkei Avot).</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talmud:_The_Steinsaltz_Edition\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steinsaltz Talmudic</a> reference guide contains a nice chart listing the generations of Tannaim and Ammoraim. According to it, the first generation of Tanaaim is from 20-40 CE. This is immediately after the period of Hillel and Shamai, so it stands to reason that Tannaim from this generation participated in one of their academies.</p>\n\n<p>However, the chart lists very few Tannaim as being from this generation. (I found Rabban Gamliel Hazaken, Akavya ben Mehalalel, Rabbi Yonatan ben Uziel, Bava ben Buta, and Bar He He skimming down the list.) My guess is that most of the other scholars were part of the two schools, and did not express many of their own opinions. After the schools ended, we see a lot more from the following generations.</p>\n\n<p>Just because a sage was not in either academy doesn't mean he doesn't follow one or the other, however. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berakhot.1.3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna Brachot 1:3</a> tells a story about Rabbi Tarfon (3rd generation) who followed Beit Shammai, and nearly died because of it. I also remember the Gemara on occasion saying that certain Amoraim held like Beit Shammai \nin certain cases. The majority of sages, however, followed Beit Hillel. Beit Hillel had more members, and was also more lenient, which was easier to adopt than the stringent practices of Beit Shammai.</p>\n\n<p>So, to summarize: The schools ended in approximately 40 CE, at the end of the first generation of Tannaim. However, their influence continued to last throughout the Tannaic and Amoraic periods. Most sages support Beit Hillel, because that's who we <em>pasken</em> like.</p>\n\n\n",

Is he the only one of his generation to enter Egypt with progeny?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Joseph was 39 when he met his family again and Judah is roughly 6 or 7 years older than Joseph (if all the brothers are one year apart). So Judah would be roughly 46 when he entered Egypt. </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, his youngest son Perez is the only grandson of Jacob among the 70 souls who is recorded to have entered Egypt with his own sons!</p>\n\n<p>I've heard the version that Er and Onan were 8 years old when they were married, but I don't think such a thing would be done, nor would it make sense that Er died as a child and especially Onan for committing a sin that would likely be impossible to commit at that age. The earliest I can see any of them getting married is 12, at the onset of puberty. </p>\n\n<p>If Judah was married at 12, Er was born to him at the age of 13. If Er died at the age of 12, Judah would be 25 and Onan died a year later, making him 26. If it took shelah the minimum of 1 year to mature, then Judah would've been 27 when he cohabited with Tamar and 28 when Perez was born. So with these minimum ages I've given Judah and his sons, it would make Perez 18 years old when he entered Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>However, I wonder if there is something more concrete than mere guesses? It just seems strange that Judah and his sons would get married so early when up until this point, Isaac and Jacob didn't marry for a while (perhaps Abraham as well). And yet, here is Judah who must have married early and he has a son that comes into Egypt with his own sons. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Ultimately my question is whether we know how old Perez and his sons were when they went down to Egypt and also, was he really the only grandson of Jacob to enter Egypt with his own sons? Even his brother Shelah, who is at least a decade older, didn't manage such a feat. </p>\n\n\n",

One should be aware that in many places the term \"mamzer\" is translated as \"bastard\", but should be careful to understand that the meaning is the technical and legal term used in the Torah and not the English connotation (which can include the child of two unmarried people).</p>\n\n<p>Point one is that Peretz was <em>not</em> a mamzer. This was acknowledged at the time he was born when Yehudah acknowledged that Tamar had not engaged in forbidden relations with him (\"She is more righteous than me\"). Therefore, none of his descendants were mamzerim and Elazar's mother did not forbid him from becoming a kohen. At the time, the halachah that became Yibum was in effect for other relatives as well.

How did he know\n  [that the child was from him]? Maybe, just as he had been with her,\n  perhaps another had also been with her? Thus, a voice [from Heaven]\n  proclaimed, \"From Me (G-d) are the hidden things!\" (Makkos 23b)   That\n  is, the whole fiasco and near catastrophe originated with G-d.\n  Elsewhere, the Midrash says that Yehudah wasn't even going in Tamar's\n  direction, but that an angel came along and \"steered\" Yehudah towards\n  her.

The <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37555/5323\">Simlah Chadasha</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35269&st=&pgnum=75\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">18:16</a>) says that, in order to have a fallback option in case one's knife is lost before he could check it after (and didn't check it before), he can rely on the fact that his special knife (that was put away, and is never used for anything else) is <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%96%D7%A7%D7%94_%28%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">probably</a> free from nicks. But any knife is fine, provided that it was checked and found to be free of nicks.</p>\n\n<p>The curvature of a cutlass actually isn't a problem, since it isn't curved too much. A curved knife (even with many curves in it!) is not a problem, even <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/702/5323\"><em>lechatchila</em></a>, provided that the curves won't stop the finger from running along the blade (meaning, provided that the curve does not form a פגימה, a nick in the blade). (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35269&st=&pgnum=67\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">18:4</a>) ( <em>although curved knives</em> are <em>harder to sharpen and examine</em> )</p>\n\n<p>However, the point at the tip of the blade <em>is</em> a problem, though only <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/702/5323\"><em>lechatchila</em></a>, as there is a concern that the tip will \"tunnel under\" (חלדה) or tear (עיקור) what needs to be cut. That point should either be shaved down, or covered with a radish or a piece of rubber -- something that will protect the tip from stabbing, but isn't too heavy so that it would make problems with דרסה (pushing down with undue pressure). (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35269&st=&pgnum=36\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">6:4</a>) ( <em>thank you sam for reminding me of this point</em> )</p>\n\n<p>While I don't know how heavy your average cutlass is, I'd imagine that it's probably heavier than your average shechita knife; which is fine, so long as the shochet says that he is certain that he didn't do דרסה (pushing down with the knife with undue pressure). (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35269&st=&pgnum=39\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:2</a>)</p>\n\n<p>I don't either know how long your average cutlass is (anything I'd google only talked about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_Cutlass\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cars</a> :P), I imagine that it's about the right length for a cow -- it should be two times as long as the neck of the animal is thick. That's pretty long for a cow; if I'm accurately judging the length in the <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/MuseeMarine-sabre-p1000456.jpg/250px-MuseeMarine-sabre-p1000456.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">linked Wikipedia image</a>, then it should be fine.<br>\nHowever, it might be too small ( <em>see picture</em> ) -- the knife needs to be able to cut what needs to be cut, while leaving part of the knife outside of the neck (above the cut). If the entire width of the knife is entirely covered at any point, then the meat is forbidden because of חלדה (\"tunneling\"). ( <em>the circled part of the picture is the part I'm worried about</em> ) (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35269&st=&pgnum=106\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">24:9</a> <em>et seqq</em>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XO8Uj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XO8Ujm.png\" alt=\"chalada\"></a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>( <em>click link for larger image; note that this image is <strong>not</strong> to scale</em> )</p>\n\n<p>If you're on a boat, things actually get pretty interesting. You're allowed to slaughter on a boat, even though people might think that you're doing some sort of service to the \"gods of the sea;\" this is not a problem because they don't usually do stuff like this.<br>\nIf, however, the owner of the boat doesn't want you getting his boat all bloody, your options are limited (blood going straight into the ocean <em>is</em> something that idolaters do). You could either slaughter such that the blood hits a board or the side of the boat before the blood goes into the water (which is problematic because it might appear that he is slaughtering in idolatrous service to his own reflection). You might slaughter into a vessel, provided that there is dirt (or dirty [=non-reflective] water) in the vessel (so that it doesn't appear as if he is collecting the blood for idolatrous service). (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35269&st=&pgnum=46\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">11:4-6</a>)<br>\nIf you can't do it, then you can't slaughter such that the blood goes into a (clean) vessel, or into the sea (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=64b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">כל מקום שאסרו חכמים מפני מראית העין אפילו בחדרי חדרים אסור</a>). Also, keep in mind that for כיסוי הדם, you'll need to hang on to some blood that you can cover with dirt. ( <em>although that doesn't apply to cows</em> )</p>\n\n<p>Another thing: pirates are <em>not</em> known for their skills at hygiene. (<em>This is excusable, as they spend a lot of time far away from shore.</em>) If your spot on the boat smells, you can't make a bracha there -- better move to a spot where it doesn't smell, so you could make that bracha. (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35269&st=&pgnum=79\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">19:3</a>)</p>\n\n<p>One thing I would add myself is that if the boat is rocking, you should make sure that you're in complete control over the movements of the animal and the knife, to make sure that the shechita is not ruined by a sudden movement of the boat.</p>\n\n<p>Bon apetit, matey!</p>\n\n\n",

The five coats in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8240#v=22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit 45:22</a> are therefore in parallel with <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16481#v=15&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 8:15</a>, which the Talmud references in b. <em>Megillah</em> 1:13, I.1.A [Folio 16a and Folio 16b].</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AOXJY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aEv0D.png\" alt=\"b. *Megillah* 1:13, I.1.A\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In other words, the Talmudic rabbis understood that Mordecai “. . . went out in royal garb, blue [and white, a large golden crown, and a cloak of linen and purple],” which were reference to his five sets of clothes. Since Mordecai was the descendent of Benjamin, the giving of five sets of clothes to Benjamin from Joseph had presaged the distinguished place of Mordecai in Jewish history.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum</strong></p>\n\n<p>The excellent question was raised: “why is the <strong>ו</strong> present in one word, and missing in the same word later in the same verse?” </p>\n\n<p>First, in old Hebrew (that is, before the eighth century BCE) the Hebrew letter <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe_(letter)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">פ (Pe)</a> did not have the final form, which looks like this --> <strong>ף</strong>. In addition, there were no punctuation marks and no spaces between words. Thus <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8240#v=22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit 45:22</a> would have looked something like this (using square characters, of course). <strong>*Please click the image, <em>below</em>, to enlarge for ease of reading.*</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5M1EQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EhlfU.png\" alt=\"Possible rendering\" title=\"Please click to enlarge\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This grammatical arrangement in this order occurs in the Torah in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9946#v=21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Badmidbar 18:21</a>, where the word <a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H2500&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>חֵלֶף</strong></a> means \"in exchange for\" (and by the way, the same verb <a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H5414&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>נָתַן</strong></a>, <em>to give</em>, occurs in that verse as well!). The Hebrew word for \"pledge\" is <a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H8667&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>תְּשׂוּמֶת</strong></a>, which would be misspelled in this verse by one letter (lamed), and of course the absent waw would be read as an absent waw helper. Thus the reader would have to re-read the verse to catch the correct meaning because the word <a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H8667&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>תְּשׂוּמֶת</strong></a> is misspelled.

The waw helper was needed because there was no final form of the Hebrew letter <strong>פ</strong> in existence, which would have triggered to the reader if the <strong>ף</strong> was the last letter of the word, or not (<em>i.e.</em>, <a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H2500&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>חֵלֶף</strong></a> with the final <strong>ף</strong>, or <strong><a href=\"http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?cscs=1Sa&strongs=H2487&t=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חֲלִפֹות</a></strong>?).</p>\n\n<p><strong>REFERENCES:</strong>   </p>\n\n<p>Kelley, P.

Joseph was placed in charge of storing food from the plenty for use during the famine. But the famine years were not only in Egypt: Canaan had famine also (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0142.htm#5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">42:5</a>). Two years into the famine in Egypt (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0145.htm#11\" rel=\"noreferrer\">45:11</a>), Jacob came down to settle there, and, as <em>Rashi</em> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/8242#showrashi=true&v=13\" rel=\"noreferrer\">47:13</a>, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/8242#showrashi=true&v=19\" rel=\"noreferrer\">:19</a>) describes,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>since Jacob came to Egypt, blessing came with him<sup>[1]</sup> and they started to plant and the famine was ended. Thus we learned in <em>Tosefta</em> of <em>Sota</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So why was there famine in Canaan before Jacob left?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(Someone suggested to me that the famine ended in Egypt when Jacob arrived because God's purpose in bringing a famine was to orchestrate Jacob's descent to Egypt and that purpose was filled on his arrival there. But that doesn't seem correct to me, as <em>Rashi</em>'s language seems to imply that the famine ended not because there was no use for it any longer but specifically because Jacob brought \"blessing\" with him; the context in the <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Sotah.10.3\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Tosefta</em> (<em>Sota</em> 10:3)</a> seems to imply this even more strongly.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>[1] </sup>My translation of \"באה ברכה לרגליו\" as \"blessing came with him\" is per <a href=\"http://chabad.org/8225#showrashi=true&v=30\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Rashi</em> to 30:30</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Three suggestions (none are perfect, or well sourced):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Really, Jacob's merits <em>should</em> have prevented the famine, but God \"overrode\" the normal course of merit-working in order to make sure that Jacob and his family would descend to Egypt. (This is similar to the suggestion that you've heard, but I believe that saying it this way solves the issue of reading Rashi and the Tosefta, because the <em>default</em> is for the tzaddik to stop the famine)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Merit isn't automatic, and is perhaps related to Jacob's spiritual state, which was much higher after being reunited with Joseph. Even though Rashi writes (45:27) that Jacob's divine spirit returned earlier, perhaps this was only on a basic level of 'divine spirit', but became much greater when he was actually in the same country as Joseph and became even happier. (This is admittedly hard to read into the sources though)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>While this may sound strange, it's possible that only the <em>\"coming\"</em> of a tzaddik brings blessing, and not his merely being there. This could be because the blessing is related to the actual influence that a tzaddik has upon the people of the land, which is much greater when he comes to a new place and his presence is thus felt and recognized more strongly (it's announced, or a change is noticed, etc.).</p>\n<p>Another explanation for this phenomenon might be that God wants to make the tzaddik's influence recognizable. If a famine is prevented from occurring due to his merits, nobody would necessarily know why the famine affected the nearby country and not theirs, and they might not even be aware that they were in any danger at all. However, if a famine begins, and stops at the arrival of a tzaddik, it's clear to everyone what caused the famine to stop. Thanks to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/52832/5083\">this answer</a>, I can say that this position is supported by a statement of the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19306&st=&pgnum=311\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chasdei David</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Here are some meforshim I found that discuss this topic:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%94%D7%9F_(%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%22%D7%A9)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מעשה ניסים</a> asks the same question (and adds \"ואדרבה! שם היו תרתי:\nקדושת הארץ, וקדושת יעקב\"). First, he writes the simple explanation which is what you wrote. Second, he writes that we find in Melachim I chapter 8 that Hashem answers the prayer of a non-Jew when they come to the Beis Hamikdash even if they do not repent or change there ways. The reason for this is so non-Jews should see that the G-d of the Jews is real and has power. Similiarly, Hashem wanted to make a Kiddush Hashem in Egypt, so He orchestrated that the Egyptians would see the greatness of Yaakov Avinu that the famine stopped in his merit.</p>\n<p>נתיבות יושר (Leiberman) also asks the same question.

Yaakov went down to Par'o, blessing came down with them as it says \"And Yaakov blessed Par'o\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Netsiv explains in his Peirush to Sifri:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שהצדיקים הולכים כו' ומקריבו אליו ומאריחו בביתו, רש\"י ברכות ד' מ\"ב א'. וכן משמע ברכות ד' ס\"ג ב' המארח ת\"ח כו'</p>\n<p>\"Where righteous people go etc.\" and he brings him close to him and hosts him in his house, Rashi Brachos 42a. And this is also understandable from Brachos 63b \"one who hosts talmidei chachamim etc.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it seems that it's not the fact that a tzadik is someplace that brings that place blessing, rather it's the fact that the people of that place host the tzadik and honor him that causes them to deserve a blessing, which is why when Yaakov was in Canaan he didn't merit stopping the fast, but when he was in Egypt, they did (because they offered him wherever he wanted to live).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Rashi quoted is in Brachos 42a, where it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר אביי אף אנו נאמר תכף לתלמידי חכמים ברכה</p>\n<p>Abayd said: we too say that following the talmidei chachamim is blessing</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And Rashi there explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תכף לת\"ח - המקריבו אליו ומאריחו בביתו. ברכה - בביתו</p>\n<p>Following talmidei chachamim - one who brings him close and hosts him at his house. There is blessing - in his house</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The gemara quoted is in Brachos 63b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פתח רבי נחמיה בכבוד אכסניא ודרש: מאי דכתיב ויאמר שאול אל הקיני לכו סרו רדו מתוך עמלקי פן אוספך עמו ואתה עשיתה חסד עם כל בני ישראל והלא דברים קל וחומר. ומה יתרו שלא קרב את משה אלא לכבוד עצמו כך, המארח תלמיד חכם בתוך ביתו ומאכילו ומשקהו ומהנהו מנכסיו על אחת כמה וכמה</p>\n<p>Rabbi Nechemya began speaking in honor of the hosts: why does it say \"and shaul said to the Keinites go leave the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them, and you did a kindness with all of bnei Yisrael? This is a kal vachomer: Yisro, who only befriended Moshe for his own benefit, merited protection for his descendants, all the more so one who hosts a talmid chacham in his house, gives him food and drinks and let's him use his possessions, would deserve protection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The question posed at the time was whether there should still be a chiyuv to fast on Tisha B'Av if a new Temple was being made (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.7.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zechariah 7:1-3</a>).</p>\n<p>Zechariah goes on to relate Hashem's response (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.7.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7:4-6</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְהִ֛י דְּבַר־יְהוָ֥ה צְבָא֖וֹת אֵלַ֥י לֵאמֹֽר׃ אֱמֹר֙ אֶל־כָּל־עַ֣ם הָאָ֔רֶץ וְאֶל־הַכֹּהֲנִ֖ים לֵאמֹ֑ר כִּֽי־צַמְתֶּ֨ם וְסָפ֜וֹד בַּחֲמִישִׁ֣י וּבַשְּׁבִיעִ֗י וְזֶה֙ שִׁבְעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה הֲצ֥וֹם צַמְתֻּ֖נִי אָֽנִי׃ וְכִ֥י תֹאכְל֖וּ וְכִ֣י תִשְׁתּ֑וּ הֲל֤וֹא אַתֶּם֙ הָאֹ֣כְלִ֔ים וְאַתֶּ֖ם הַשֹּׁתִֽים׃</p>\n<p><em>“[And God said to me:] Say to the people…When you fasted and lamented on the fifth and seventh months [i.e. Tisha b’Av and Tzom Gedalya] during the last seventy years, <strong>have I been fasting?!</strong>  And when you eat and drink (not on a fast day), is it not you who decides to eat or drink?!”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The OU website writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note how God’s rhetorical answer implies that Am Yisrael should not be asking God concerning the laws of the fast days.  After all, the fast days are not God’s commands, <strong>rather they are customs instituted by the people themselves in order to remember Yerushalayim.</strong>  Just as the people decide when and what they eat, they too should decide if and when they should fast....</p>\n<p>...God takes this opportunity to remind Bnei Yisrael (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.7.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7:7-10</a>) that the first Temple was destroyed because of their wayward behavior, for they did not follow the guidance of their prophets. <strong>To make sure the new Temple will be successful, the people must make sure not to repeat those same sins that caused the first one to be destroyed.</strong></p>\n<p>In a nutshell, God is not interested in people fasting; rather that they follow His laws properly, especially those of <strong>social justice</strong>, and not repeat the sins of their forefathers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, after making it clear what His aspirations are for His people i.e. to follow the way of truth and justice, all four fast days are addressed <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.8.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zechariah 8:18-19</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְהִ֛י דְּבַר־יְהוָ֥ה צְבָא֖וֹת אֵלַ֥י לֵאמֹֽר׃ כֹּֽה־אָמַ֞ר יְהוָ֣ה צְבָא֗וֹת צ֣וֹם הָרְבִיעִ֡י וְצ֣וֹם הַחֲמִישִׁי֩ וְצ֨וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֜י וְצ֣וֹם הָעֲשִׂירִ֗י יִהְיֶ֤ה לְבֵית־יְהוּדָה֙ לְשָׂשׂ֣וֹן וּלְשִׂמְחָ֔ה וּֽלְמֹעֲדִ֖ים טוֹבִ֑ים וְהָאֱמֶ֥ת וְהַשָּׁל֖וֹם אֱהָֽבוּ׃</p>\n<p><em>“Thus says the Lord: <strong>The fast of the fourth month (17th Tammuz), the fast of the fifth month (Tisha B’av), the fast of the seventh month (Tzom Gedalya), and the fast of the tenth month (10th of Teves), shall become for the House of Judah days of joy and gladness – happy festivals – [on the condition that] you must love and follow – emes v’shalom – truth and peace.</strong> ”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And as a result:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God declares that should Am Yisrael fulfill their destiny and establish a nation characterized by justice & truth, there will no longer be any reason to fast. <strong>Instead, these fast days will become holidays</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem from this analysis that all of these fast days were characterised by failings in the Jewish people, particularly in the area of social justice. When we as a nation take pains to correct these flaws <strong>all</strong> of these four fast fast days will be celebrated as holidays and that is why so many of our fast days \"revolve around the Beis Hamikdash\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>We don’t commemorate the destruction of the mishkan because the mishkan was meant to be replaced, and therefore its destruction wasn’t much of a loss.\nWe don’t commemorate the rest of the exiles because, like it says in meseches Megillah (daf 11b)  the 70 years of Gallus were counted from the destruction of Jerusalem, possibly because it marks the end of Jewish reign in Israel.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Because all destruction says Rabbi Aharon Kotler is due to the destruction of the Beis Hamikdosh.</p>\n\n\n",

Wouldn't he suspect them doing the same with Binyomin? If so, why didn't Yaakov go with his sons to Egypt to get food knowing the brothers wouldn't harm Binyomin if their father was with them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There appear to be 2 parts to your question, as I understand it.</p>\n\n<p>First, why didn't Ya'akov go down at all? The simple answer appears to be a combination of items - He was very old. He originally planned to settle permanently in Cana'an - after all that was the land G-d had promised, and it was also the land where Avraham and Yitzhak lived. It's also clear that he planned on dying there and being buried in Ma'arat Hamchpela.</p>\n\n<p>The concern that the brothers would kill Binyamin was, essentially gone via several statements that Yehuda made. Most notable is <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=558&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breishit 42:9</a> where Yehuda says that he will be the \"guarantor\" for Binyamin, and if he doesn't bring Binyamin back and stand him before Ya'akov, then he will have sinned all his (Yehuda's) life. See Rashi's comment on the term \"Stand him\" stating that Yehuda was stating that \"I will not bring him back dead, but rather, alive.\"</p>\n\n<p>It seems that it was a combination of trusting Yehuda's statement as well as, probably, moreso his timing. Ya'akov was getting more desparate at that point. He and his family were almost out of food! And, Ya'akov realized that sending the children back without Binyamin would probably end up getting all of the children jailed and / or killed.</p>\n\n<p>Ohr HaCha'im commentary states this more strongly. He focuses on the additional word \"Gam\" - \"also\" at the end of verse 8 (He says we will live and not die <strong>also</strong> you, <strong>also</strong> us...\"</p>\n\n<p>Yehuda was stating - It's understood that we can't go back without Binyamin. So, if we don't go at all, <strong>all</strong> of us will <strong>definitely</strong> die from starvation. But, if we do go down with Binyamin, there's a <strong>possibility</strong> that an accident will happen - it's <strong>not</strong> a definite! And if everything turns out well, at the end, we will bring back food and <strong>all</strong> of us will return alive, and you will also live from the food brought back. In short, it makes more sense to take a chance and send Binyamin with us.</p>\n\n\n",

What is different about the 10th of Teves that one can show tzar on shabbas according to that opinion?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Chassam Soffer in Toras Moshe mahadurei kama in his drush for 7th of Adar d.h. kasuv addresses this. In short he says that just like every generation that the Beis Hamikdosh is not rebuilt is as if it was destroyed, so too every year on the tenth of Teives which was the beginning of the destruction, we are judged and a gezeira is put forth if the Beis Hamikdosh will be rebuilt this year.\nTherefore this is not a fast concerning past losses which are not docheh shabbos, like Tisha biAv or a yor tzeit for a parent. This is a fast for the betterment of the future which is allowed on shabbos, like a taanis chalom, which by fasting makes a person feel better for the future.</p>\n\n<p>See also in his drashos page 99b in the second column d.h. vial davar zeh. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I read a few years ago, possibly it was in one of the Chaba\"d L'Chaim weekly newsletters around 10 Tevet about 2-3 years ago, this concept. (I'll try to hunt down the source, but if someone can locate this, please edit my answer.)</p>\n\n<p>One would think that Tish'a B'Av should get preference because that is the day that both Temples were destroyed. (Tish'a B'Av actually does occur on Shabbat as it will in a few months, HOL\"T.)</p>\n\n<p>However, it is the <strong>beginning</strong> of the tragedy that is actually the most notable. 10 Tevet marked the day that the walls of Jerusalem were first breached, and from that point, things got worse. The start of the tragedy is the most notable, and therefore receives the highest priority.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Tevilat keilim 101: I have these new dishes; now what?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am trying to improve the kashrut level in my kitchen.  The <em>food itself</em> has been kosher for years as best I know (ingredients, separation of meat and milk), but I didn't always know all the other things I needed to do to get this right.  Specifically, <em>tevila</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I have some new dishes now and I want to start off right with them.  I've found <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-containers-tevilas.htm\">this page</a> that explains what does and doesn't require <em>tevila</em>, but my question is more basic: what exactly do I do?  Do I just show up at the <em>mikvah</em> with my box of dishes?  Am I supposed to make an appointment?  I know that <em>mikvaot</em> for people are time-restricted; how does that interact with me and my dishes?  Is there a customary donation or fee?</p>\n\n<p>Assume I've never done this before: what do I need to know?</p>\n\n<p>(In case you're wondering, knowing that my <em>kashrut</em> is deficient I do use disposable utensils when cooking for other Jews.  But I'd prefer that my <em>kashrut</em> just not be deficient in the first place.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In terms of the dipping itself:</p>\n\n<p>You should make sure that the entire vessel, as it is intended to be used, is immersed.  That means that if pieces are meant to come apart, you should separate them, and you should make sure that the water gets into everywhere that it needs to get. This sometimes involves turning things upside down to release air-bubble pockets.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you pick something up and hold it while you dip it, the spot where your fingers are creates an interruption between the water and the object.  One option is to hold one hand below the object, and then drop it from one hand to the other, so it is in free-fall for an instant.  An easier option is the advice of the Rema, to dip your hand in the <em>mikvah</em> water first, so that your hand is wet with <em>mikvah</em> water and the point of contact is not an interruption.  You can also dip a basket into the water, and then drop things one by one into the basket.</p>\n\n<p>If you have objects that require being dipped Biblically and others that require being dipped Rabbinically, you should dip a Biblically-required object first so that the blessing can be made on a Biblically-required dipping. (I'd have to search for a source for that, but that's what I recall being told.)</p>\n\n<p>I recommend bringing some rags with you to dry things off with - <em>mikvahs</em> do not always have the cleanest water, and you probably don't want your car to smell like <em>mikvah</em> when you put everything back into it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Having lived in several places, i've been to my share of <em>mikvaot</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing to do is contact the rabbi or someone else to get some basic information, such as when it's open, and how to get in. Some charge, others don't. Many (most?) places have a separate <em>mikvah keilim</em> besides for the people-<em>mikvah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Once you've gotten in, it's simple enough. Bring your dishes. If you're <em>tovelling</em> something that needs a bracha, say the bracha (watch out for the difference between one and more items -- כלי vs כלים).<br>\nDunk one thing at a time. Move your hand around so that the entire thing gets immersed.<br>\nDon't talk while you do this, unless it's necessary for the <em>tvila</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Silverware is a little harder than plates and cups, because it's small. If you just dunk each one separately, it'll take a long time, and there's a risk of dropping it. My advice is to bring a mesh bag, put all the silverware in there, and dunk it. Shake the bag around so that water can get between each fork, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Advice: Bring a towel to dry the stuff when you're done. Also, make sure to wash it before using it -- most mikvah water isn't too clean.<br>\nNot serious: wait until summer. The water is warmer them.</p>\n\n<p>Also, you don't need a set mikvah -- just a kosher one. We use a river a block away, for free.</p>\n\n\n",

There are a bunch of \"ifs\" going on here, because it appears that \"Meir\" was a nickname so we don't really know who he was.  Also, there is likely more than one R' Yishmael (one of which was Kohen Gadol), so things are a bit murky.

When I asked him why, he said it was because he had eaten \"cereal with milk\" at breakfast.  When I expressed confusion, since as far as I understood only \"hard cheese\" (whatever your interpretation of that) requires waiting before eating meat, he replied that he received his practice from Chabad.</p>\n\n<p>Is this really a known Chabad practice?  If so, what is the source?

See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30483&st=&pgnum=316&hilite=\">here</a> where the Lubavitcher Rebbe would wait at least one hour after eating milk on Shavuos to start eating the Yom Tov meal (that included meat). As the footnotes elaborate, he was against any leniency (as others hold) with regards to Shavuos and waiting times, and this custom of waiting an hour was a practice by the Chabad Rebbes which may or may not be applicable to the Chassidim in general.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, Lubavitchers that I know generally wait an hour, sometimes a half hour and fairly rarely not at all.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Zohar in parshas Mishpatim makes no difference which type of food was eaten first in the requirement to wait to eat the other type. This Zohar is quoted in the Biur HaGra in Yo'd 89 #6 as a source for the minhag recorded in the Ramma to wait six hours after meat. The fact that this Zohar would require six hours after milk too is ignored by the Gra but raised as a question in other places. Also of note, the Zohar never mentions the amount of time to wait as six hours. And the actual intent of the Zohar is not so clear, see the Pri Chadash who says the same idea as the Gra and see the Kreisi & Plasey where he argues on the Pri Chadash.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have never heard of anyone ruling like this.

The waiting 5 days is not a result of being <em>tehora</em> - it is a result of having cohabited with (or having been able to cohabit with) her husband, and therefore having a concern of discharging <em>shichvas zera</em>, which invalidates the counting of those days. The woman who went to <em>mikvah</em> has a concern of discharge, and the other woman does not.  It is not a result of being <em>tehorah</em>, even if it is a consequence.</p>\n\n<p>Someone who consumed meat for their Yom Tov seudah cannot have a glass of milk, while someone who did not have meat can.  The one who consumed meat is not being punished for having made a nicer Yom Tov meal (assuming they both like meat) - he is merely subject to the consequences of having eaten meat, which is incidental to the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>seudas Yom Tov</em>.

So too, it is obvious that if Gentiles were\n  to make a religious law to eat a particular item that is good to eat,\n  halacha would not prohibit eating that item. So too, any item of\n  pleasure in the world cannot be prohibited merely because Gentiles do\n  so out of religious observance.’ ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My opinion, which I feel is supported by the above quote - you are watching fireworks, which per se is not any form of religious observance or practice. You could technically claim that that you are doing so completely unrelated to the New Year's celebration, i.e., it's just fireworks - no different from your watching Independence Day fireworks (i.e. - your disconnecting your watching from the day that it occurs.) There is certainly no problem doing this.</p>\n\n<p>In the worst case, if even in your mind you are celebrating New Years, see the rest of the article that cites most opinions stating that New Years has lost its religious significance.</p>\n\n<p>FYI - There will be a fireworks display just before midnight tonight (1/1/15) over New York Harbor at Liberty Island.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It is permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Source: I was eating a meal with my Rebbi one Friday night (December 31, 2010), and after the meal we all went outside to watch the fireworks.</p>\n\n\n",

They wanted to answer that the Ritva may hold that \"טלי\" is a problem by קידושין as well, rendering \"טלי\" as a \"מילתא דאיתא בקידושין,\" (\"something that [also] applies to קידושין;\" which the gemara determines does not belong in the list on 10a) which would mean that \"טלי\" does not belong in that list.

Chaim's own writings, though it seems to have been popular as an oral tradition. Its meaning is debated even by his closest students. </p>\n\n<p>One written source for the comment is from Reb Chaim's son, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_33371_42.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Velvel</a>, quoted in the linked article as well as in Haggadah L'Beis Brisk (pg 175). His interpretation is I believe the most straightforward one: someone who comes to beleive in heresy through no fault of his own loses his share in the World to Come. The way in which this is phrased by R. Elchonon Wasserman (Kovetz Maamarim pg. 19), another of Reb Chaim's greatest students, is that while in all other areas of Torah there's a concept of 'shogeg', someone being exempt form being punished by the full extent of the law due to being mistaken, this is not so regarding heresy. This is also how the statement is interpreted by <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_48216_385.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Moshe Shmeul Shapiro</a>, by <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_46422_620.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yichiel Michel Feinstein</a>, R. Shimshon Dovid Pinkus (last few pages of Breichos B'Cheshbon, and <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_51366_166.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in other random books and places</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, aspects of this interpretation are still <a href=\"http://www.bhol.co.il/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=1989172&forum_id=1364\" rel=\"noreferrer\">left unclear and subject to debate</a>, and here we get into the question of how Reb Chaim knew this to be the case. If such a person is considered a 'heretic', does that mean that he cannot perform shechita or pour wine for me? </p>\n\n<p>As for a source, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/51079/whats-the-source-for-the-line-nebach-an-apikoirus/51084#51084\">R' Weinberg (quoted by YeZ)</a> shows that the Rambam does state (towards the end of his introduction to Perek Cheilek) that anyone who doesn't <em>know and believe</em> in the 13 principles would be a heretic (meaning, even if he never heard of them, and obviously can't be faulted, he's still a heretic). His definition of heresy in Hilchos Teshuva likewise seem to unequivocally include both the mistaken and unintentional disbeliever. R' Velvel was quoted as using this as an answer to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/13091/what-are-rambams-%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/38254#38254\">why the Rambam formulated 13 principles</a>, seeing as denial of any area of Torah should make one a heretic. The answer is that mistaken disbelief only makes someone a heretic if the disbelief is one of the principles, not another teaching of the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>However, in several places, the Rambam discusses those who believe in heresy due to their upbringing and through no fault of their own. (See his comments to Mishnah Chullin 1:2, Hilchos Mamrim 3:3, Hilchos Shechitah 4:14-16, Moreh Nevuchim 1:36, Shut HaRambam 449, and towards the end of Iggeres Hashemad). In most of these places, the Rambam <em>does</em> seem to believe in a concept of shogeg regarding heresy, as he writes that someone who merely believes in heresy due to a mistake can still be a good shokhet. </p>\n\n<p>Some<sup><em>who?</em></sup> have suggested that the Rambam would differentiate between different forms of heresy, as there are 'minim, kofrim, and apikorsim' (see Hilchos Teshuva ch. 3) and not all of them necessary have the same laws. However, I find this to be a difficult read in the Rambam, and I believe that the true explanation, as indicated by several of the sources quoted above, is that while the 'unfortunate heretic' is not a <em>halakhic</em> heretic for the purposes of wine and slaughter etc. he is still a <em>metaphysical</em> heretic. </p>\n\n<p>What's a metaphysical heretic, you ask? Just about every instance where the Rambam mentions heresy or heretics, he also writes that a heretic (1) loses his share in Olam Haba, and (2) is no longer considered part of the Jewish people. Thus, someone who is a heretic through no fault of his own, but merely due to a mistake, would have lost his relationship with the Jewish people and/or a share in the World to Come. I believe that the sources quoted above indicate that such a person would indeed lose his share in Olam Haba (as does the Abarbanel interpreting the Rambam, in Rosh Amanah ch. 12), but R. Weinberg, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/13091/what-are-rambams-%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/38249#38249\">as quoted here</a> and in the book Even Shesia, has reportedly said that the mistaken heretic loses his relationship with the Creator, but might still be granted access to the afterlife. </p>\n\n<p>R. Elchonon Wasserman (Kovetz Maamarim pg. 19) also quotes this statement, but interprets this statement very differently: there's no such thing as being a heretic 'by accident', since the truth of God is so obvious that only a wicked person would deny it. (I personally have a lot of trouble accepting this though, especially regarding the other 12 principles besides belief in God, though it is perhaps supported by Moreh Nevuchim 1:36).</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/13091/what-are-rambams-%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/38254#38254\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28636/what-if-someone-is-unable-to-believe-in-god/48851#48851\">here</a>, my discussion of these ideas in other contexts. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The way that R' Yaakov Weinberg understood this, it means that someone who has an incorrect understanding of G-d, His Torah, and one's relationship to G-d through the Torah, does not have the relationship of a Jew with G-d.  It specifically applies to the 13 principles of faith, which form the framework of having an accurate understanding of that relationship.</p>\n<p>For example, if someone did not know that G-d is One, because no one ever told them, at the end of the day they still do not have an accurate relationship with G-d.</p>\n<p>It is not a statement of accusation or culpability, it is just a statement of fact.</p>\n<p>There are two sources to the source of this idea.  The first is in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1503.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Teshuva 3:7</a>.  There the Rambam writes that someone who doesn't believe (among other things) that G-d has no body is a heretic.  The Raavad there argues and says that, even though they are wrong, it isn't their fault as they were misled by the simple understanding of scriptures.  The Rambam seems to have held that they are still heretics despite it not being their fault.  R' Weinberg went a step further and showed that the Raavad essentially agrees - he does not argue on any of the other beliefs which the Rambam quotes, and doesn't mention any exemption of accidentalness in either Hilchos Teshuva or in the first chapter of Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah.  The Raavad seems to have agreed otherwise that an accidental heretic is still a heretic.  His argument was that G-d's incorporeality cannot be a principle of faith over which one is a heretic even for accidentally having it incorrect, as G-d would not have written the Torah in such a way as to be potentially misleading about such a basic point. But regarding anything which <em>is</em> a principle of faith, the Raavad agrees to the Rambam.</p>\n<p>The second is from the Rambam's post script to the 13 principles in the introduction to Chelek.  There the Rambam writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכאשר יהיו קיימים לאדם כל היסודות הללו ואמונתו בהם אמתית הרי הוא נכנס בכלל ישראל</p>\n<p>When a person is aware and believes these foundations, he is included in the category of Israel</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Weinberg pointed out that there are two requirements - to know the Ikkarim and to believe them. That means that not knowing one of them disqualifies a person. If a person isn't aware of one of the Ikkarim, they still are not בכלל ישראל.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This was explicitly stated several hundred years prior to R. Chaim. </p>\n\n<p>In enumerating the different categories of heretics, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> writes in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=5&perek=3&halocha=7&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Teshuvah 3:7</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והאומר שיש שם רבון אחד אבל שהוא גוף ובעל תמונה</p>\n  \n  <p>one who accepts that there is one Master [of the world], but maintains that He has a body or form;</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911896/jewish/Teshuvah-Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Disagreeing with this, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_David\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ra’avad</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א”א ולמה קרא לזה מין וכמה גדולים וטובים ממנו הלכו בזו המחשבה לפי מה שראו במקראות ויותר ממה שראו בדברי האגדות המשבשות את הדעות</p>\n  \n  <p>Abraham says: Why does he call this [person] a sectarian? Many greater and better than him went with this idea based on what they saw in verses, and even more from what they saw in the words of the <em>aggadot</em> that corrupt the viewpoints. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=90649&rid=410\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Commenting on Ra’avad’s dissent</a>, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_de_Boton\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Abraham de Boton</a> writes (my emphasis):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>על זה תפס הראב”ד ז”ל בהשגות דאם טעה בעיונו מפני שראה בכתוב נעשה אדם בצלמנו כדמותנו כו’ אין ראוי לקרותו אפיקורוס ורבינו סובר שאין לך אפיקורוס גדול מזה כמ\"ש בפירוש העיקרים במשנה דבפרק חלק</p>\n  \n  <p>On this Ra’avad of blessed memory grasped in his dissent, that if one errs in his analysis because of what he saw in Scripture “let us make man in our image like our form etc.” it is not proper to call him a heretic. <strong>But our teacher [Rambam] holds that there is no heretic greater than this</strong> as he wrote in explanation of the fundamental principles in the Mishnah of Chapter Chelek. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, according to this interpretation Rambam holds that a mistaken heretic is still a heretic. </p>\n\n\n",

I had just gotten down the block after davening by the early minyan on Motzei Shabbos and just took a couple of steps into the street when some guy who was speeding like a lunatic almost ran me over.

If someone is unable to check the <em>simanim</em> after shechita without his glasses on, then he can't shecht without his glasses.<br>\nAnother point to note, Mateh Asher also says (#8) that if someone is using an electric lamp (\"נר עלעקטר\"י\"), he needs to have a back up candle, because \"פעמים נכבה מעצמו ע\"י סבה,\" \"sometimes it will go out for whatever reason.\" However, my rebbi has noted that there is no longer a need for this, as our electric lights are pretty reliable; as far as I've seen, we don't require a back up candle when shechting at night by electric light, though I've been told that some groups of chasidim are still concerned for this.

He can't seem to control his anger, causing great anguish to the litigants, and a big <em>chilul Hashem</em> at times. I have been asked to approach the <em>av beis din</em> to complain, and I would like to make a solid <em>Halachic</em> case.</p>\n\n<p>So:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can someone who cannot control his anger be a <em>dayan</em>?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'd appreciate <em>Halachic</em> grounds and sources regarding the prerequisite of a <em>dayan</em> to be in control of his emotions and outbursts.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Lets ignore all mussar and the horrible things Chazzal say about anger. Let us also ignore that humility is one of the seven qualities a judge needs. And we will also ignore the chillul Hashem that can come out from a judge behaving like a child.</p>\n\n<p>Instead I will quote the one source I think may shed some light on this, but keep in mind your situation is not explicitly mentioned. </p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch in Choshen Mishpat siman 7 siff 8 writes 'Two talmidei chachamim that hate each other are not allowed to sit on a court case together. Due to the animosity between them, each one will put his mind to undo the others words.'</p>\n\n<p>This is not a psul in the judgement bidieved, but the language used  lichatchila is a strong one of psul.\nThe important thing to remember is that in laws such as this, the qualification for hate is to have not spoken to each other in three days, out of this animosity.</p>\n\n<p>The Aruch Hashulchan in siff 17 adds  'and the outcome of the ruling will not be true. Also do not appoint two people who's personalities are different in their nature and dealings (seffer hachinuch). </p>\n\n<p>The common theme is that what we've got here is a failure to communicate, which translates as a psul, lichatchila at least, for judges who need to be able to communicate with one another and the litigants. An angry, argumentative person disrupts the system of justice from being carried out to its truthfulness. Especially if his outbursts cause the other judges and or the litigants from speaking their mind.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I'm not certain the psul mentioned applies to ZaBL'A and a case of pshara krova l'din. But the idea as least seems to hold up.</p>\n\n\n",

The only thing that is \"blue\" about the tzitzit is one of the threads that hangs from the others knotted on the four corners.

Since not everyone agrees with that, you'll find some people where תְכֵלֶת strings on their tallis and tallis katan, and many who don't.  See the discussion of this topic <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/809611/Rabbi_Eli_Ozarowski/Part_1:_Have_we_finally_found_the_real_Techelet?#\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.  So the requirement to wear \"blue\" on our tallis or tallis katan (the one under our garments) is a question as to what is on the corner strings, not on the garment itself.</p>\n\n<p>There are different customs to wearing a tallis katan -- many non-Hassidic Jews wear ones that are plain white like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SES9l.png\" alt=\"tallis katan, completely white\"> </p>\n\n<p>and some people wear them with decorative black stripes, not caring that it shows through their shirts:  </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Nwl17.png\" alt=\"tallis katan with a few black stripes, a few inches from the bottom\">.  </p>\n\n<p>Finally, I know people, mostly Hassidim, who wear a wool black-striped tallis katan, with decorative fringes at the bottom, like this one: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jqnLY.png\" alt=\"tallis katan with a few black stripes, a few inches from the bottom, plus a series of decorative fringes hanging off the bottom edge\"></p>\n\n<p>or like the one that Zero Mostel wore when he did Fiddler On the Roof: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bPQod.jpg\" alt=\"Zero Mostel as Tevye\"></p>\n\n<p>As for the color of the stripes, I've never seen a tallis katan with stripes of any color other than black or white (then the white stripe is a different fabric from the rest of the garment), although many tallisim I've seen have been of many colors.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I haven't worn this type of <em>tallit kattan</em> myself. If I recall, the stripes on some of these tallitot are on one side only, or they're not as pronounced on one side. If so, wear it so that the \"faded\" side faces out; That may help. Otherwise, unless you are specific that you must wear only white shirts, wear a dark one. If you must wear only white, then, the only solution I can think of is to wear an extra layer (white undershirt, etc.) under your dress shirt.</p>\n\n<p>From @NBZ's comment about וּרְאִיתֶם אֹתוֹ \"and you shall see it\", this refers to the strings, not the <em>beged</em> - garment part or the stripes on the garment.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Very simple: Sow on a white piece of cloth to cover up the dark stripes. This is not problematic at all. In fact the corners are likely already reinforced with cotton squares. Just make sure that neither the patch, nor the thread used to sow it on, contain any linen whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Saving an innocent person from being wrongly executed by a Beis Din\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is already a question on this site asking about <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/27594/is-it-a-mitzvah-to-save-someone-from-execution-by-beth-din\">saving a person from being executed (fairly) by a beis din</a>, as well as a question regarding the criminal himself, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10483/is-it-a-mitzva-to-escape-the-death-penalty\">if he may/must attempt to save his own life instead of being killed</a>. </p>\n\n<p>IMHO, the answers to these two questions are definitely not, as a penal system cannot possibly work that way (and because everyone is obligated in ובערת הרע מקרבך to some extent), but one would be hard pressed to find an explicit source addressing the issue because of its obvious answer. </p>\n\n<p>However, I wonder <strong>if any sources specifically address the case of an innocent person</strong><sup>1</sup>. If I know with absolute certainty that Reuvian is not guilty of a crime (punishable by death) for which he was convicted by a Beis Din, and this Beis Din is on their way to executing him, can I intervene?  Let's say that I cannot convince the Beis Din otherwise, such as a case where there was already a psak din that Reuvain was guilty of being a <em>meisis</em>. Can I help Reuvain run away and provide him with sanctuary?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. This is in bold to indicate that I'm looking specifically for sources that address this issue, and not for anyone's '<em>diyuk</em>', though you're welcome to share it in the comments section</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>See Ramban Parshas Shoftim 17 11 on the passuk לא תסור מן הדבר אשר יגידו לך ימין ושמאל. \nEven if they tell you about the right that it is left or the left that it is right, these are the words of Rashi. The point is that even when you think they are mistaken, and it is clear in your eyes like your knowledge of right and left,do as they say. And do not say how can I eat this forbidden fat, OR HOW CAN I KILL THIS INNOCENT MAN, but rather say this is what the Master who had commanded his commandments, that I should do in accordance with the ones standing before him in the place He chose and according to their knowledge He gave me the Torah AND EVEN WHEN THEY ARE MISTAKEN, this is the same idea as found with Rabi Yehoshua with Raban Gamliel on Yom Kippur And its reckoning, Rosh Hashana 25a.</p>\n\n<p>Please excuse the loose translation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I asked R. Tsvi Berkowitz this question, and he replied that the general consensus of acharonim is that the victim may save himself even by killing the beit din, and the same is likely true for a bystander saving him as well. (he didn't tell me which acharonim discuss it).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>I've viewed the answers and comments in the linked items in your question. Based on them as well as what I glean from the requirements of both Bet Din as well as the witnesses as summarized <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_and_corporal_punishment_in_Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, I dismiss the premise of your question, itself.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the possibility of false witnesses, this would need to be proven during the trial itself. In your question, you imply that you are the only one that knows about the person's innocence. You don't have a co-witness. If, in fact, you can bring a co-witness to prove that the other witnesses are false, this should be done during the trial, itself, not afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I am citing <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14085&st=&pgnum=212&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi on Devarim 11:17</a> commenting on the words \"Do not stray from what (Bet Din) has said right or left\" meaning even if Bet Din says that left is right and right is left. I.e. - once Bet Din has made their decision, even if you know that it is wrong, you must follow their decision.</p>\n\n<p>So, Rashi is stating that, yes, it is possible that Bet Din may have erred, but you still must follow their decision once it has been made. Thus, your attempt to intervene would seem to be a violation of \"Do not stray...\". One of the answers in the linked question has already addressed the concept of intervention. In short, if the Bet Din has already decided the person is guilty, even if you can prove otherwise, you must accept its \"wrong\" decision. And next time, perhaps someone else could join you to defend your \"friend\" DURING the trial :-)</p>\n\n\n",

Coming from a non-Orthodox background, this seems shocking to me, since I was brought up to believe that sleeping in the same bed is a major part of being married.  Is there any source for this practice?  Is it halacha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>People are generating a lot of unnecessary fog here, especially with the weird asceticism-within-marriage idea. Let's not go there, please. </p>\n\n<p>A couple will need two separate beds for ~12--15 days per month when the wife is cycling normally; plus at least a few weeks after childbirth. Hence it's very common to have two beds that can be separated (or put together). If there's some other arrangement that works for them, that's fine too.</p>\n\n<p>For the times of the month that the couple doesn't need to separate the beds, it's entirely their decision what to do about the beds. (There are plenty of non-Jewish couples who like having their own space.) It's not shocking that some may find it easier to just keep them separated then too -- and if the couple is happy with that, that's fine and good. There's nothing that can or should be dictated about this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I found this \"Halacha\" in the Kaf HaChaim, Orach Chaim 240:63</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ישכב תמיד במטה מיוחדת בפני עצמו. ואם צריך לשמש לשם מצות פו׳׳ר אחר גמר .השימוש כמו חצי שעה יקום וישוב למטה היוחד לו. אור הצדיקים סי׳ כז׳ אות ג׳</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Furthermore, in Sefer Piskei Teshuvos, (pamphlet on Siman 240, footnote 226), the author quotes his father as being against the practice of having a single bed. (I have a sefer, entirely about Orach Chaim 240, and he quotes a sefer called דרכי טהרה. I have never heard of this sefer, nor can I find it, but apparently it has something relevant to this discussion.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46549&st=&pgnum=276&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nitai Gavriel</a> brings an opinion that the two beds should never be connected, or to have a double bed, due to Maris Ein. So from a practical perspective, sleeping in the same bed can be difficult, as it essentially means sleeping in one bed while leaving a second one empty, not connecting them, that is likely not all that large.</p>\n\n<p>I know of a Rov who paskened about having beds beyond a certain size that it is not Tznius. The specific size isn't relevant for this answer because it would be about what is standard to have in homes.</p>\n\n<p>And many people just prefer/get used to sleeping separately. So when you put it all together, it does add up to a lot of reasons why sleeping the same bed is just impractical and thus not done.</p>\n\n<p>There is, however, no strictly Halachic prohibition against it. I'm confident asserting that because in that whole chapter the Nitai Gavriel (who is a rather thorough collector of stringent opinions) says nothing (that I could find).</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, the man should give the woman a piece of jewelry since he doesn't have rights to her clothing or jewelry (and rings are pretty much the only piece of clothing that can be carried around conveniently). This is somewhat questionable, however, as the object (whatever it may be) <em>would</em> belong fully to the woman for the brief interim period, the Rogotchover brings support for his position from a Ran (ד\"ה מנה אין כאן) that such an object might not be able to be considered to have completely left the ownership of the man. </p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://beisvaad.blogspot.com/2014/12/yehuda-and-tamar-kiddushin-with-ring.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">post from a blog of divrei Torah</a> by Rabbi Eliezer Eisenberg provides several other reasons:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>There is one passuk in which the letter Mem in middle of a word is formed like a mem sofis, an end-of-word Mem, the passuk in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.9.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 9:7</a>-לםרבה המשרה ולשלום אין קץ.  The Tikunei  Zohar mentioned in the Rama in 27 says this letter Mem is ring shaped, and it alludes to the peace and fertility we portend for this couple.  The Gematria of לםרבה is Eizer and Zera.

Unless this doesn't have a din of jewelry, which I doubt.)</li>\n  <li>In Parshas Mikeitz we see that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.41.42?lang=bi&aliyot=1&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.41.42.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pharaoh gave Yosef his ring</a> as a sign of trust and high office and responsibility.

The ring is a symbol of the Shechina because it has no beginning and no end.</li>\n  <li>I'm not sure this counts as a reason, but the Mordechai in Kiddushin 488 says that a 14 K gold ring is something that doesn't need evaluation, it has inherent value according to its weight.  (In fact, some communities use silver rings; it is possible that this is based on the din of כספא טיבעא.)  Perhaps that's why a gold ring is used, because clothing or gems or things need assessment.  Even coins used to vary according to whether they were used locally as currency.  The value of a simple piece of gold is pretty universal, the same all around the world, except, of course, in places of unusual circumstances like war or famine.

He answers that since at the moment of death the woman is no longer his wife, when the גט reaches her, it is worthless.

He goes on to say that the metal devices used for preparing the Matzah do not need tevila.</p>\n\n<p>The Shach there #11 explains the reasoning of the Ramma to differentiate between the slaughtering knife and the matzah devices is a slaughtering knife can sometimes be used for a food item which would necessitate its being toveled, whereas the matzah device are not used for any other food.\nThe Gra #14 takes issue with this Shach quoting multiple sources that a knife for slaughtering is never used for anything else and ends off saying we don't go after the possible uses but rather actual use.</p>\n\n<p>The Pischei Tshuva #6 brings a Shev Yaakov concerning a ladle of sorts used for baking which would not need tevila but is sometimes used for making tea.

Unfortunately in this singular instance the Pischei Tshuva left out the fact that the Shev Yaakov wrote this according to the opinion of the Mechaber, not the Ramma and the little va'v was printed in the text of the Ramma so it is confusing. But taking the parallel of this opinion in the Ramma and that of the Shach into consideration, what we end up with is an opinion of the Ramma to tovel, without a Bracha, the utensils which may be used in the future. \n According to the Gra, this would not be a necessary precaution, but once one chooses to actually use it, it would need tevila at that point. \n He points to siff 8 and there in the Ramma we find explicitly as mentioned before that tevila is needed before its actual use.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Consider the case of a \"magic fork\".

But is it just plain and simple nakedness (that being naked in itself is a sin, something shameful) or is there more meaning we are supposed to glean from this?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>On a bit of a tangent, what exactly is nakedness in this context? What parts of the body must be covered to be <em>not</em> naked (eg. genitals, buttocks, breasts, etc.).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I once heard this idea, I believe quoted from R' Moshe Shapiro:</p>\n\n<p>Being naked is not something that should be intrinsically shameful.  The body, which is the purely physical component of man, is meant to be subservient, and compliment, the spiritual component of man.  It is only when the physical is no longer in line with the spiritual mission that it becomes shameful.  Then, displaying the physical is embarrassing.</p>\n\n<p>When Adam and Chava had not yet sinned, they were naked and not embarrassed - there was nothing to be embarrassed about.  After they sinned, the ramifications of their sin was manifest in the disconnect between their physical and spiritual components.  This is why clothing, the purpose of which is to hide the body, is called a בגד, with the same letters as the Hebrew word for traitor - the clothing is meant to mask the betrayal of the body of its spiritual purpose.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, our Sages teach us that Adam and Chava had כתנות אור, hides of light, before they sinned, which were replaced by כתנות עור, hides of skin.  Before they sinned, their bodies were a portal through which the light of the soul shone through.  Afterwards,  they had bodies which hide and block the light of the soul.</p>\n\n<p>There is a Kabbalistic idea that the difference between א and ע is that an א does not have its own sound, while an ע is a guttural letter with a sound - the א represents something ephemeral while the ע represents something more tangible.  Thus, there transfer from אור to עור was the body going from something ephemeral to something more thick and physical in nature. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, the nature of their sin was expressed in the realization, and shame, of their nakedness - it was the departure of their physical existence being in sync with their spiritual purpose.</p>\n\n\n",

What is the source for this prohibition?</p>\n<h2>Possibility 1: לא תתחתן בם</h2>\n<p>The Torah tells us regarding the 'nations' (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9971#v=3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 7:3</a>-4)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹא תִתְחַתֵּן, בָּם:  בִּתְּךָ לֹא-תִתֵּן לִבְנוֹ, וּבִתּוֹ לֹא-תִקַּח לִבְנֶךָ.  ד כִּי-יָסִיר אֶת-בִּנְךָ מֵאַחֲרַי, וְעָבְדוּ אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים; וְחָרָה אַף-יְהוָה בָּכֶם, וְהִשְׁמִידְךָ מַהֵר</p>\n<p>\"Do not marry them; do not give your daughter to his son nor take his daughter for your son. For he will turn your son from Me and serve other gods, and the anger of God will flare up against you and destroy you speedily\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5112.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Issurei Biah 12:1</a> understands these verses to mean that intermarriage of any kind is prohibited. However, this doesn't count as an answer to the question for two important reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Rambam explicitly prohibits only intercourse 'דרך אישות', by way of marriage. Intercourse that is outside the context of marriage would seem to be permitted. (While the Gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=36b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avoda Zarah 36b</a> seems to understand this verse as referring even to non-marriage-like intercourse, the Gemara is sufficiently ambiguous there to support either interpretation).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Simply reading the Gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=76&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevamos 76a</a> implies that this verse is applicable to gentiles of any nation, and that is indeed the interpretation of the Rambam (cited) and Rabbeinu Tam (Tosfos <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=29&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kesuvos 29a</a>), this is not necessarily the standard interpretation. In its context, this verse is specifically referring to the seven nations that lived in Canaan, and would not apply to most gentiles (or any, nowadays). The Gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=36b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avoda Zarah 36b</a> records that this is a dispute between the Sages and R. Shimon bar Yochai, and normally we'd conclude like the Sages, that marriage is only prohibited (based on this verse) to the seven nations who lived in Canaan. This is the position of the Ramban to Yevamos daf 78, Sefer Mitzvos Gedolos Lav 112, and - importantly - the Tur, in Even Ha'Ezer 16.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Possibility 2: לא יהיה קדש</h2>\n<p>Another possible source one might give for a prohibition of merely being with a non-Jew is by combining two Rabbinic interpretations that refer to two different words for a 'prostitute'. The Rabbinic interpretation of a prostitute in the context of who is not allowed to marry a kohen, אשה זונה וחללה לא יקחו (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9922#v=7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayikra 21:7</a>) includes anyone with whom the Kohen is unable to have a legal marriage (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=34&daf=29b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Temurah 29b</a> and Tosfos <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=42b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevamos 42b</a>).</p>\n<p>The Torah also speaks about a 'prostitute' in another context, which is a blanket prohibition for all Jews, not just Kohanim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹא-תִהְיֶה קְדֵשָׁה, מִבְּנוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל; וְלֹא-יִהְיֶה קָדֵשׁ, מִבְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל</p>\n<p>There shall not be a prostitute among the daughters of Israel, nor a male prostitute among the sons of Israel (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9987#v=18\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 23:18</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Targum Onkelus translates this verse as referring to a prohibition on any man to have intercourse with a maidservant (though not a regular gentile, I'm getting to that). The way that Rashi and Ramban interpret this translation of Onkelos is by explaining that intercourse with anyone who cannot be married is a violation of the 'prostitution prohibition', thus applying the Rabbinic interpretation of <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9922#v=7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vaykira 21:7</a> to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9987#v=18\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 23:18</a>. Rashi also appears to apply this verse to a regular Jew having intercourse with a slave in his comments to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=36b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avoda Zarah 36b</a>, though Tosfos there disagrees.</p>\n<p>According to this logic, someone who has intercourse with a non-Jew should be in violation of this law, because a non-Jew also cannot be married to a Jew (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=76&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevamos 76a</a>). Support for such an idea might actually come from the Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7541\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Even HaEzer 16:1</a>), which states that someone who has intercourse with a non-Jew is punished by lashes משום זונה, because of [the prohibition of] prostitution. However, the Vilna Gaon comments that this is a printer's error, and is indeed very difficult to read the Shulchan Aruch as referring to the Biblical prohibition of לא תהיה קדשה.</p>\n<p>However, this interpretation is problematic for several reasons. First of all, the very question of intercourse with a slave may be a subject of dispute among Tannaim (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=75b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kiddushin 75b</a>). More importantly, the Rabbis themselves (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=82&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 82a</a>) interpret the verse in Devarim 23:18 radically differently and explicitly reject this reading of Rashi/Ramban, making it hard to support such an interpretation according to Rabbinic halakha.  This is noted by the Sefer Yeraim (siman 25), who does actually pasken like this Targum despite it being unsupported by the Gemara. However, even the Sefer Yeraim doesn't believe that the prohibition extends to non-Jews.</p>\n<h2>Possibility 3: הלכה למשה מסיני</h2>\n<p>As seen from the story regarding Pinchas, who killed Zimri for having intercourse with a non-Jew, a 'zealot' is able to kill someone who performs such an act. While a 'zealot' acting in such a manner is not necessary the usual state of affairs, it's inconceivable that a <em>permitted</em> act would warrant being killed, even if only at the hands of a zealot. Thus, the aforementioned Gemara in Avoda Zarah assumes that there must be a prohibition of Biblical origin that was not recorded in the Bible; an oral Biblical tradition, or הלכה למשה מסיני. The Gemara concludes, however, that this הלכה למשה מסיני may only apply if the violator is with the non-Jewish girl in public, but not if he does so in private.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=83&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 83a</a> seems to be working with the same assumption (that if a zealot can kill someone having intercourse with a non-Jew, it must be biblically prohibited), and concludes that it is indeed an איסור כרת. The 'prooftext' for the Gemara is passage in the Book of Nechemia, which is not usually considered to be a Biblical source. Hence, some commentators understand that the Gemara in Sanhedrin is arguing upon the Gemara in Avoda Zarah and saying that there's really a הלכה למשה מסיני prohibiting this act even in private (see Ran and Ramban there, and the Rambam in his commentary to the Mishnah Sanhedrin 9:6 and Beis Shmuel to Even Ha'Ezer 16:4).</p>\n<h2>Possibility 4: Rabbinic Enactment</h2>\n<p>The actual answer that seems to be in line with 'how we pasken' (i.e. the opinion of the Rambam, Tur, Shulchan Aruch, and later poskim), is that the prohibition of having intercourse with a non-Jew is Rabbinic in nature, meaning that while it may not be prohibited from any of the words in the Bible, the Rabbis (either at the time of Shem ben Noach, or the Chashmonaim) prohibited it (see the Gemara <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=36b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avoda Zarah 36b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=82&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 82a</a>, and <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7541\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Even HaEzer 16:1</a>).</p>\n<p>However, this knowing that the prohibition is Rabbinic doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't as important. In many cases, and in this one especially, the Rabbis taught us that their enactments are important enough that one who violates them would be punished more severely than one who violates certain Biblical prohibitions (again, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=83b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 83b</a>) and this was something that we know from the prophets (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16518\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nechemia ch. 11</a>) was an important rule in the eyes of God.</p>\n<p>Since the OP asked for how this prohibition is viewed in the eyes of Kabbalah, I'll add a quick two lines: very very badly. <a href=\"http://www.ykr.org.il/modules/Ask/answer/10549\" rel=\"noreferrer\">This link</a> notes that the Arizal (Shaar Ruach HaKodesh Tikkun 20) wrote that a person who violates this sin is reincarnated as a dog, despite the prohibition being rabbinic in nature.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Torah says \"when you enter the land of Israel, don't marry into the peoples there.\" There are different interpretations whether that applies only to Canaanites, idolaters, or all non-Jews -- but that's a prohibition on marriage-like relationships.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=23#C4259\" rel=\"nofollow\">also prohibits prostitution</a>; fascinatingly, it appears that one interpretation of this (the Targum Onkelos) says as marriage between a Jew and non-Jew doesn't \"take\", therefore any relation with a non-Jew therefore falls under the prohibition of \"prostitution.\" But that's not how most commentaries read it.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, we have the story of Phineas the zealot -- if someone does a brash, shocking thing in public of consorting with an idolatrous woman, then <em>if</em> a zealot (thousands of years ago) were to slay him, we wouldn't prosecute the zealot. (Though if he or she killed the zealot in self-defense, they wouldn't be charged either.) But that's kind of a weird one.</p>\n\n<p>The majority opinion appears to be, however, that the the broad prohibition of all relations with all non-Jews is a very strong rabbinic prohibition. (Rambam, prohibited relations 12:2 writes \"he should be flogged for violating a rabbinic prohibition.\")</p>\n\n<p>As for kabbala, I have no idea and don't really care. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Ishus 4:15</p>\n\n<p>Kiddushin does not exist between a gentile and a Jew and Kiddushin is a requirement before sexual relations.</p>\n\n<p>also Rambam isurei bia 12:4-5</p>\n\n<p>a Jewish man can be killed by zealots for relations with a non-Jewish woman. though there are a long list of restrictions which make this almost impossible to carry out in practice as explained in tractate sanhedrin.. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hasidicuniversity.org/index.php?page=hu_theocracy/mitzvah_profile.php?mitzvah=-52\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hasidicuniversity.org/index.php?page=hu_theocracy/mitzvah_profile.php?mitzvah=-52</a></p>\n\n\n",

To show the sharp edge of his\n  knife, a shochet would take a hair from his beard, and holding the\n  hair in one hand the shochet would see whether the חלף cut the\n  dangling hair.  If the hair was severed, the shochet's steel passed\n  the test.</p>\n  \n  <p>So too, in a similar manner, R' Moshe would often test the sharpness\n  of an electric shaver's blades.  He would take a beard hair and test\n  the blades!  The shaver would be acceptable if the hair was held taut\n  and was not split in half.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It appears that the pop-up trimmer is no sharper than the rotary blades.

    "title": "How is drinking the golden-calf water a sotah-like test?",
    "content": "# How is drinking the golden-calf water a sotah-like test?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9893#showrashi=true&v=20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 32:20</a> Moshe grinds up the golden calf into water and makes the people drink it.  Rashi comments on this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[Those who practiced idolatry both] without witnesses and without warning [died] from dropsy, for the water tested them and their stomachs swelled up (Yoma 66b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That sounds like the same means of death as with the sotah ritual for the wife suspected of unfaithfulness, and \naccording to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/35485/472\">here</a> Avodah Zara 44a makes the connection.  If I understand correctly, the g'mara says that and Rashi alludes to it.</p>\n\n<p>The sotah ritual involves writing the divine name and then dissolving it into water for the woman to drink.  I don't have sources for this, but it seems key that the use of the divine name -- that is, invoking and involving the One in whom she should be in fear and awe as part of the ritual, when otherwise we would <em>never</em> erase the name like that -- is critical.</p>\n\n<p>But the calf is just a lump of ex-jewelry.  It's <em>not</em> divine; it has no power at all.  Grinding <em>it</em> up into sotah-like water doesn't evoke the same image at all.  Why would Moshe want to invoke the so-called \"power\" of the calf in such a ritual?</p>\n\n<p>What am I missing?  Aside from the drinking part how is this like the sotah?  Or if there are other opinions about why Moshe did this, what are those opinions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Ramban says that Moshe's intention was that the substance used for idolotry should end up vomited or defecated out, further humiliating it. But he also quotes the Talmud's reason as brought in Rashi approvingly.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of Rashi's answer, of course the primary similarity is the drinking of water to bring out something that is otherwise unknowable outside the guilty parties and the manner of death caused by the water for the guilty. Also, the fact that the natural course of the water is to be harmless, thus any guilt being clearly Divinely indicated.</p>\n\n<p>The Ibn Ezra says that the earth from the floor of the Mishkan used in the Sotah water is also represented here, as the water used was from a river flowing down Mount Sinai, so this is like the floor of the Mishkan (the inanimate taken from a holy place, I assume is the intention).</p>\n\n<p>But in terms of the Divine name, the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9933#v=23&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">verse</a> about a Sotah actually emphasizes that it is the curse that it erased into the water, not the Divine name. So here, the golden calf is being compared to a curse. The Talmud (in Sotah) makes the point that the curse includes the erasing of the Divine name and that this shows how important the peace between a husband and wife is - that the Divine name is erased over it.</p>\n\n<p>That too has a parallel here - Moshe broke the tablets in order to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9895#showrashi=true&v=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">make peace</a> between G-d and the Jews, just like the Divine name is erased in the Sotah ceremony.</p>\n\n<p>The Medrash Bamidbar Rabbah (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14384&st=&pgnum=57&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">9:54</a>) examines dozens of parallels between the Sotah and golden calf, with G-d as the husband, Israel as the unfaithful wife, Idol worship as adultery, Aahron as the paramour (who made the golden calf), etc. </p>\n\n<p>Among them the holy water of the Sotah parallels the river water from the mountain which was used for the water in this case, the dust of the Mishkan being the gold dust from the golden calf and that dust was from the floor representing how lowly it was to worship it. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&st=&pgnum=536&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sifsei Chachamim</a>, the commentary on Rash\"i expands on this idea stating that one who defiles himself by following idolatry is compared to a woman \"hidden\" from her husband (my loose translation - I may be a bit off). Sifseu Chachamim ends by saying \"as stated in the Midrash\", but he doesn't say which one. He also cross-ref's Rashi's comment on averse from Shir Hashirim and ends by stating \"This is difficult to me\". I'm uncertain if he means that only the Shir Hashirim part is difficult or all of Rashi's comparison to a Sotah is difficult.</p>\n\n<p>My opinion: As you seem to focus a bit on \"the calf is just gold dust\", actually, it wasn't <strong>just</strong> that. The calf was considered a \"god\" to the people. In the Sotah \"mixture\", the name of G-d is blotted into the water. Similarly, Moses took pieces of their \"god\" and put it into the water. I see a close comparison.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Without presenting the finer details, maybe it is important to add that several Midrashim state that the calf was made with a Divine Name, taken when Moses retrieved Joseph’s coffin from the Nile using this name. It was retrieved from the Nile and thrown into the fire forming itself into a calf despite Aaron's attempts to slow down the process (Tanchuma, Ki Sisa 19; Pirkei d’Rebbi Eliezer 45). </p>\n\n\n",

As a scientist involved in biology, professionally, he must assume the existence of biological evolution, and this conclusion is apparent in the papers he writes which discuss how cell biology and behavior evolve over an observable amount of time. On the other hand, he religiously believes that the Torah's account of creation is the truth, although perhaps not literal in all respects. He wonders whether by adopting as true previous science concerning evolutionary biological development, his work directly conflicts with Judaism's fundamental tenets.  He has his own rationale, but are there responsas that address this issue for scientists? I note that there have been some pretty amazing rabbinic scholars who were also scientists, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (a physicist), for one. So I would imagine there must be something. Among the issues I wonder about is whether the rabbis would consider this scientists' representations as being ganeives daas (improper deception).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Torah and religion teach of the world as it is (assuming that we know to understand the teaching correctly) while science deals with the world as we see it.

The Zohar was \"written\" by Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai and his students. Unlike the Mishna and the standard Midrashim, it was not a published work. The Zohar was probably passed only orally to select students. The Mishna and Midrashim most likely were also passed down essentially orally for many centuries, but in a public fashion. Even if the Zohar had been recorded in writing, there were not many copies for many centuries. After the initial spread of the Zohar by Moshe De Leon, many manuscripts were written.

In <a href=\"http://chabadtalk.com/forum/showthread.php3?t=2729\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chabad Talk</a> there are several references to the idea of not saying \"yimach shemo\" about another Jew  (including  Jesus of Nazareth). </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/chrysler/archives/reeh65.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thoughts on the Weekly Parshah by HaRav Eliezer Chrysler, Parshas Re'ei</a> it is clear that Reb  Yosef Chayim Sonnenfeld commented that using the epithet Yimach Shmo was not the way to speak about a fellow-Jew even a secular leader. This despite the fact that  R. Yosef Chayim fought the secular establishment tooth and nail without respite. He did everything in his power to negate their authority. He commented that  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>it makes more sense to pray for them to do Teshuvah than to curse them\n  (as B'ruryah taught her husband [Rebbi Meir] in B'rachos 10a)!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article continues: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We dare not curse the Resha'im. What we have to do is to pray\n  fervently that G-d showers them with a spirit of purity and puts into\n  their hearts the will to do Teshuvah.

(Rambam, Gerushin 1:1,2) If the husband is coerced, the Get is invalid. (Rambam, Hilchot Gerushin, 220[<em>sic</em>]) The oft-quoted dictum kofin osoh ad sheyomar rotzeh ani -- \"we coerce him until he states 'I want to\"' -- applies only in cases when (a) specific grounds for that verdict exist, (b) the Bet Din renders a verdict of kofin (we force him), and (c) the coercion is carried out by the Bet Din or others implementing its verdict.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see that a Beit Din has the authority to coerce the man to give the get, and we can see from Rambam in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/4115.htm#8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">הלכות אישות פרק טו, ב</a> regarding a marriage without children for ten years that the Beit Din physically beats the husband till he gives a divorce (or takes a second wife).</p>\n\n<p>In light of that, I don't understand why it seems that Batai Din refuse to use force in cases where the husband uses the refusal of a get as a means of blackmailing his wife, and where the claim of the Get being invalidated by the use of force comes from.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This one's pretty straightforward -- forcing a Get only works in situations when halacha says beis din can do so. The Talmud gives examples of abusive behavior or intolerable medical conditions; but if they're just annoyed with each other's personalities, we don't have a halacha that says beis din can use coercion.</p>\n\n<p>Hence the beis din has to make a tricky call, \"is this a situation that allows coercion?\" If they rule \"no coercion\" when it should be used, she could be stuck; but if they rule \"yes coercion\" when it shouldn't, then the Get would be invalid. But many batei din can be a bit gun-shy about making this ruling.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam's opinion is that if she simply says \"I get sick at the thought of having relations with him\", that's enough to warrant coercion, but others (e.g. the Rosh) disagree. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Smart thermostat on Shabbos - what to do?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I read an article recently regarding a person who went to a hotel and realized after Shabbos began that all the rooms were controlled by smart thermostats. A smart thermostat detects when one is in the room and conforms to the temperature set previously at that point. When one leaves the room the thermostat goes to a higher setting in the summer and a lower setting in the winter.</p>\n<p>Is one stuck in his room in such a situation until Shabbos is over? What should one do in such a circumstance?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It appears that since the person will be acting regularly and not doing any special actions to affect the turning on or off of any device it is permitted on Shabbat (see Orchot Shabbat vol. 1 page 513 in the name of Rav Vozner; Siach Nachum siman 25). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I am in no strong position to offer opinion, but my understanding is that this situation is Melacha Derbanan, but is <em>not</em> Psik Reisha D'lo Nicha Ley — <strong>unless</strong> maybe if you genuinely do not benefit from the temperature.  If you benefit from the temperature then its Psik Reisha.</p>\n\n<p>I can imagine a crafty person suggesting that you thoroughly embrace and hold the position of the needlessness of the automatic temperature change, by realizing the 'stuffiness' or 'chilliness' of the room — but please don't think of this as justification in anything pragmatic until you consult an acknowledged authority.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if one came from a plane flight to a hotel, and was feeling a sick (that they were exposed to a germ on the airplane), and the controlled temperature of the room was a benefit, maybe it could be considered allowed — if the <em>lack</em> of such temperature control could pose a danger to becoming ill, especially where that illness could have significant secondary impacts.  But I think that would still expose you to ramifications from what were your intentions prior to becoming sick (since you didn't plan on catching a flu on the airplane).  The illness kept you within halacha, but you didn't plan for that.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8380/walking-by-an-automatic-door-on-shabbos\">This is a good related post here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why do books say \"ספר\" on them?",
    "content": "# Why do books say \"ספר\" on them?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Why do Jewish books often say \"ספר\" on the spine, cover, or cover page?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The word is synonymous with \"book\" in modern Hebrew, and some closely related concept like \"document\" or \"scroll\" in Tana\"ch. I find it strange for book titles (or at least the covers that contain them) to have it in them due to redundancy. The numbered hypotheses below are ways I have speculated to mitigate the strangeness, but there are reasons listed explaining my scepticism about each one. </p>\n\n<p><sup>Not included is the absurd possibility that \"ספר\" is intended as a helpful descriptor for a person holding the object in their hand to identify it by.</sup></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. The null hypothesis</strong>\n<br>There is no good reason behind inclusion or exclusion of the word and this decision is simply subject to the writer's or printer's whim. The only way to disconfirm or disprove this argument would be to gather a large volume of indicative evidence, to which I might have access but not the tools to analyze. </p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Association with sanctity</strong>\n<br>The author is going for the connotation of sanctity through association with the \"classical\" meaning of the word. It is used in several places to refer exclusively to biblical books - e.g. <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%92\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in this <em>mishna</em></a>. Perhaps that exclusivity has broader application than \"Scripture\" and people are implying that their works belong in that expanded category, but I haven't seen anyone address this obviously in an introduction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Emphasize length/genre</strong>\n<br>Like \"book\", the word could name a self-contained, long, factual unit of printing. As such, people might wish to specify that right on the cover as opposed to being one of. . .</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>commentary; {<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/14061\" rel=\"noreferrer\">counterexample</a>}</li>\n<li>responsa; {<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/174\" rel=\"noreferrer\">counterexample 1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/922\" rel=\"noreferrer\">counterexample 2</a>}</li>\n<li>compilation; {<a href=\"http://www.lehmanns.co.uk/idvt-amrim-hlq-b-amrim-nlqtim-mskt-det-tvrh-el-htvrh-lpi-sdr-a-b.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">counterexample 1</a> <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%98_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ironic counterexample 2</a>}</li>\n<li>pamphlet; {?}</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>4. Differentiate from generic phrase</strong>\n<br>Less extreme than the absurd possibility mentioned above, if a book has a generic title like <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/40631\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this one</a>, it could be useful to differentiate it from the concept the title names, especially when referred to without context. This does not pragmatically apply to most instances. </p>\n\n<p>In some cases the appendage of the word \"ספר\" varies by printing of a given work, but in others it seems fossilized such that it appears in each printing I encounter. This phenomenon is less explicable in my opinion than the occurrence of the word in general (not specifically Torah-related) contexts, which tend to have obvious reasons for being there, such as fitting naturally into a title which would otherwise be just a topic, as @Yishai mentioned in a comment.</p>\n\n<p>An acceptable answer will make a convincing argument based on a lot of observations and patterns induced from them. An \"Accept\"able answer will invoke express wisdom of printers or publishers (or the people who study them) of many books.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some relevant examples in response to comments: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/14673\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Igros Moshe</em></a>: first edition (I believe) from 1959, includes \"ספר\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/14406\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Sh'nei Luchos Hab'ris</em></a>: commonly abbreviated, includes \"ספר\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/19559\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Halachos K'tanos</em></a>: both</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>When possible, I look for the first place in Tana\"ch that the Hebrew word is used (assuming, of course, that it <strong>is</strong> a Biblically used word.</p>\n<p>\"Sefer\" is mentioned \"early\" in the Torah in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breishit 5:1</a>, \"This is the 'sefer' of the generations of Adam (man - humanity)\" - My loose translation esp. of the word \"Adam\", in the is context.</p>\n<p>I linked to the <em>Mikra'ot Gedolot</em> version, intentionally, because each commentary has a slightly different explanation of the word 'sefer'.</p>\n<p><em>Seforno</em> (I have a feeling that his name originated from 'sefer', BTW, though I don't know what the connection is.) translates it as \"story\".</p>\n<p>Rash\"i translates this as \"accounting\" or \"counting\" - i.e. connected to numerology.</p>\n<p>In terms of using \"sefer\" for the names of most books, either of these terms may apply. Most works called \"sefer\" has some form of \"accounting\". <em>Sefer Minyan Hamitzvot</em> (from Ramba\"m) is an example. The mitzvoth are counted / assigned a number. Why not just leave the word \"sefer\" out? Perhaps, but, maybe for someone who didn't know what the book was about, isn't it nice to know that by saying \"sefer\", now I know this book has some sort of \"counting\" or a method of assigning a number to the ideas in the book?</p>\n<p>The 2nd definition - \"story\" could also mean \"lessons\". I.e. - the \"stories\" being told are not like a bedtime story where it's just nice to hear. These are meant to be examples, morals, or lessons taught on how to behave and conduct your life properly. <em>Sefer Chafetz Chaim</em> has lessons and examples / stories (a few) to teach you individual lessons on how to conduct your life.</p>\n<p>Incorporating from a comment - if it were just called \"Chafetz Chaim\" you would have some general idea that this book had <em>something</em> related about \"desiring life\" or improving how you live. By saying \"sefer\", you have some idea of the structure - it's telling me some stories.</p>\n<p>(Note - Rav Kagan is called \"The Chafetz Chayim\" because it was custom to name people after one of their most notable seforim that they wrote, not the other way around. The book is not named after the Rav!)</p>\n<p>Granted, I'm sure that my explanation may not apply to <strong>every</strong> book with the title \"Sefer\", but, probably a majority. If you think of any that may break this rule, I'd like to know. But, IMO, that may be one of several exceptions to the trend.</p>\n\n\n",

It appears, however, that if one did not do so, the immersion is still valid.  In the note at the end the Shevet Halevi calls for repeating the immersion if it hasn't already become \"overcome by events\", you might say; for <em>geirut</em> I suspect that if you notice immediately (while still in the pool) you'd take them out and repeat,<sup>1</sup> but if you've since left and begun your life as a Jew, then, like the wife who has been with her husband, it doesn't make sense to repeat now.

Seeing that קרח’s rebellion was destined for disaster, she cunningly intervened to prevent her husband from being swept up into the rabble-rousing euphoria. She made און drunk to the point that he was unable to join the throng and then uncovered her hair and sat by the window ensuring that no-one would pass by lest they see an immodest-looking woman. Ultimately, it was through an astute understanding of the situation that she was able prevent her husband from meeting his untimely death. This heightened awareness stems from a unique acuity that only women are blessed with known as בינה יתירה – literally, ‘additional understanding’ (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.45b.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">:מסכת נדה מה</a> - The גמרא writes there, “מלמד שנתן הקב\"ה בינה יתירה באשה יותר מבאיש” – “This teaches that Hashem provides an additional understanding with women, more so than with men”).</p>\n<h2 id=\"mothers-set-the-standard\"><strong>Mothers set the standard</strong></h2>\n<p>It therefore follows that mothers set the standard for the home and create the momentum through which every family member can begin to reach their potential. Since she is so pivotal to the home environment, the מהר\"ל writes that her instinctive understanding and resulting guidance is something that should be followed (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derech_Chaim.1.5.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מהר\"ל, דרך חיים על פרקי אבות א:ה</a>. He writes there, \"האשה יסוד מציאות הבית ויש ללכת אחר עצתה\" – “The woman is the foundation, (and is thus) the reality of the home, and one should resultantly follow her advice”). Indeed, the מדרש relates that it is specifically the women who introduce their children to the Torah way of life - (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.28.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שמות רבה כח:ב</a> where it writes, \"שיהו מנהיגות את בניהן לתורה\"). This approach is echoed by חז\"ל who highlight the fact, that since women go to such lengths to ensure their children have the right חינוך, they are resultantly granted a guaranteed promise of reward, a return that is superior to the men. The גמרא in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.17a.14?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ברכות יז</a> relates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אמר ליה רב לרבי חייא נשים במאי זכיין באקרויי בנייהו לבי כנישתא ובאתנויי גברייהו בי רבנן ונטרין לגברייהו עד דאתו מבי רבנן.\"</p>\n<p><em>“Rav said to Rav Chiya, through what do women merit (eternal life)? Through bringing their children to Shul to learn Torah and through sending their husbands to the study hall to learn and waiting for their husbands until they come back from the study halls.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The mother therefore has a unique role that is rightly lauded. This important position is outlined clearly by the Vilna Gaon זצ\"ל. The פסוק in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.20.20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">משלי כ:כ</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"מקלל אביו ואמו ידעך נרו באשון חשך\"</p>\n<p>“One who curses his father or mother, his light will flicker out in the deepening darkness”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14229&st=&pgnum=119&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vilna Gaon</a> explains this choice of imagery to mean that since a child’s parents inspire the child in both תורה and מצוות which are likened to fire, by cursing them he is causing the source of the light to be extinguished. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אביו הוא מלמדה תורה כמ\"ש ולמדתם וגו' ושננתם וגו' ואמו היא המדרכת אותו לעשות מצות ולילך בדרך ישרה\"</p>\n<p>“His father teaches him Torah as it is written; ‘Teach them [to your children]’ and ‘Teach them thoroughly [to your children], and his mother guides him to do Mitzvos and to go on the straight path”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is evident from this teaching that whilst the onus may be on the father to ensure his child learns Torah, the mother acts as the key influence in encouraging her child in the ideal Jewish lifestyle. Through her endless love and ever-watchful eye she ably ensures that her children tread the path of תורה and מצוות.</p>\n<p>One example where we see a mother’s care and attention praised explicitly, is in the famous משנה in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">פרקי אבות ב:ח</a>. When mentioning רבי יהושע בן חנניה’s name, his teacher, רבי יוחנן בן זכאי states, \"אשרי יולדתו\" – “Fortunate is the one that bore him”.  It is quite amazing that when recalling the greatness of רבי יהושע, רבי יוחנן בן זכאי felt it proper to credit his mother with his success. רש\"י explains that the reason for such lavish praise was that upon hearing that she was pregnant, every day she would travel to the בתי מדרשות in order to expose her unborn baby to the sound of תורה learning whilst asking those in attendance to pray that her child become a תלמיד חכם. This practise was further concretised following his birth, where she permanently stationed his crib there so that he would hear the words of תורה (refer to both <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.8?lang=bi&p2=Bartenura_on_Pirkei_Avot.2.8.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רבינו עובדיה מברטנורה</a>  and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.8?lang=bi&p2=Yachin_on_Pirkei_Avot.2.78&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">תפארת ישראל</a>). It is clear that his mother was all too aware of the power of a positive impression even in the eyes of young child. Such an upbringing is both unique and unparalleled, something which רבי יוחנן בן זכאי clearly realised. It was this selfless dedication, this commitment to raising a child so saturated in תורה that allowed רבי יהושע to become the great תלמיד חכם that he was.</p>\n<h2 id=\"section-1\"><strong>מסירות נפש</strong></h2>\n<p>Throughout the annals of time, the Jewish mother has typically displayed immense מסירות נפש, self-sacrifice, in order for her children to succeed. Her desire to gain true yiddishe נחת knows no bounds and the lengths that they go to, in order to reach these objectives are legendary. רבקה אמינו seemingly does the unthinkable. She dupes her blind husband יצחק, her devoted partner of many years, by helping יעקב with a suitable disguise and has to then watch an incensed עשו set out for revenge (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.5-17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בראשית כז:ה-יז</a>). Her actions and the resulting fallout would have undoubtedly pained רבקה but it is clear that she acted for the greater good. In her mind, עשו was clearly not worthy of the ברכות and something had to be done to intercede on יעקב’s behalf.</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, the גמרא in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.156b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">:שבת קנו</a> relates how the mother of רבי נחמן בר יצחק was informed by astrologers that her son would become a thief. What was her reaction? She told him to always cover his head, declaring, ‘Cover your head so that the fear of Hashem shall always be on you’. The result enabled him to become one of the greatest teachers and תלמידי חכמים of his generation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"striking-the-balance\"><strong>Striking the Balance</strong></h2>\n<p>When defining the perceived roles of both the father and the mother, there is clear delineation in the תורה. The עשרת הדברות states unequivocally that one must ‘honour’ his father and mother (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.12?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שמות כ:יב</a>). In that context, the תורה needed to place the father first, since a child naturally honours the mother more. Yet, when referring to ‘revering’ one’s parents (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.3?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ויקרא יט:ג</a>), the תורה places the mother’s name first as a child tends to have a greater sense of fear for their father (Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.3?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Leviticus.19.3.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רש\"י ד\"ה אמו ואביו תיראו, ויקרא יט:ג</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.30b.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מסכת קידושין ל: - לא</a>.). It would seem therefore, that the mother is naturally the purveyor of love and tenderness in the home. Her careful supervision makes her the figure of compassion. That is not to say the father is regarded as strictly authoritarian, rather, it relates back to our initial point about women’s holistic awareness of the world around them. It is due to their sensory perceptions and intuitive reactions that they are able to respond to situations in a more considered manner.</p>\n<p>This instinctive aura of love allows for the children to have a firm foundation to learn about the world around them. שלמה המלך famously writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"שמע בני מוסר אביך ואל תטוש תורת אמך\"</p>\n<p>“Hear my child, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.1.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">משלי א:ח</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whilst the father may be the one who is the main teacher of תורה, the mother’s wisdom permeates the home creating the correct pathway for the household to tread (Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.1.8?lang=bi&p2=Ibn_Ezra_on_Proverbs.1.8.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אבן עזרה</a> on משלי א:ח which states, \"כי האשה חכמה מורה הדרך ישרה לבנה\" –  “The wise woman teaches the straight path to her children”). Coupled with the boundless love that is ever-present, this allows a child to naturally absorb what is being transmitted. In the הגדה it writes about fourth son, \"ושאינו יודע לשאול את פתח לו\" – “As for the son who is unable to ask, you must initiate the subject for him”. HaRav Shmuel Ehrenfeld זצ\"ל, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4930&st=&pgnum=49&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the חתן סופר</a>, notes that the directive to converse with this child (את) is in the feminine form. This is because when an adult speaks about יציאת מצרים, it must be done in the same patient and gentle manner that a mother interacts with her child.  Thus, the mother’s way with a child is seen as the prerequisite for teaching children. In general, we should employ a gentle and caring manner to help trigger a love for תורה and מצוות.</p>\n<p>However, by the same token, the mother must also find the right balance. Despite having this default maternal characteristic, this affection must not come through a state of over-indulgence. A woman must also be able to rebuke her child when necessary. The problem, according to the של\"ה הקדוש is,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"כי טבע הנשים רכות\"</p>\n<p>“That women are softer by nature” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Shaar_HaOtiyot%2C_Derech_Eretz.27?vhe=Shenei_Luchot_HaBrit,_based_on_Amsterdam,_1698_ed._Part_I&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">של\"ה, שער האותיות, אות ד' – דרך ארץ, פרשה כו</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means to say, women have to be in a position whereby they can fix character defects, it is not just up to the father. If they remain passive, they will cause more harm than good. The של\"ה הקדוש supports this idea with a פסוק from איכה which states, \"ידי נשים רחמניות בשלו ילדיהן\" – “The hands of the compassionate mother ‘cooks’ her children” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Lamentations.4.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">איכה ד:י</a>). Ultimately, if the mother does not take action, she is ‘killing’ her children as she is not correcting their behaviour and thereby, not providing a correct educational standard.</p>\n<p>בת שבע the wife of דוד המלך is a noted example of a mother finding this balance and knowing when to rebuke her child. The מדרש relates that on the day that the בית המקדש was to be dedicated, שלמה המלך overslept due to the fact that he had become inebriated the night before (Various מדרשים allude to the fact that the previous night שלמה המלך had got married to בתיה the daughter of פרעה and the sound of rejoicing over פרעה’s daughter was greater than the rejoicing surrounding the בית המקדש. בתיה went on to spread a canopy above his bed. This canopy was full of gems and pearls which sparkled like the stars and constellations. The result ensured that when, שלמה המלך awoke he saw what he thought was stars and went back to sleep, finally arising four hours into the day. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.964.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ילקוט שמעוני, משלי תתקסד</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.10.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">במדבר רבה י:ד</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.12.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ויקרא רבה יב:ה</a>). To make matters worse, the קרבן תמיד של שחר, the daily morning sacrifice, could not be offered as the keys to the בית המקדש lay under the pillow of the sleeping שלמה. Naturally, out of both respect and trepidation for the king, the people were somewhat nervous to wake the slumbering monarch. They resultantly went to his mother בת שבע who went and woke him up (ילקוט שמעוני, משלי תתקסד).</p>\n<p>בת שבע then proceeded to hit him with her shoe, exclaiming, \"מה ברי ומה בר בטני ומה בר נדרי\" – “What is it, my son? And what is it, O son of my womb? And what is it, O son of my vows?” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.31.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">משלי לא:ב</a>). The explanation of this last clause – “Son of my vows”, is a reference to the fact that when נתן הנביא came to tell דוד that he would have a son called שלמה (Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.22.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">דברי הימים א - כב:ט</a>), all of his wives took a vow that if they were to give birth to שלמה they would bring all the קרבנות of the Torah. בת שבע turned to שלמה המלך and shouted, “I have now come with sacrifices in my hand and you are asleep”!(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.12.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ויקרא רבה יב:ה</a>) She proceeded to tell her son that it is incorrect to behave like non-Jewish kings who drink wine and become intoxicated. שלמה later acknowledged that his mother was right (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.70b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">:מסכת סנהדרין ע</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First of all, all mitzvos chinuch aside, a person in a position of authority to correct others will still have a mitzvah of tochacha.

He is not discussing their halachic requirement to educate children, he is discussing the nature of all females, rich and poor, human and animal, to raise children. He points to the fact that most women are not rich and couldn't afford child care while they occupy their time with mitzvos. This he says is a reason why the chachamim throughout the generations never instituted for women to do mitzvos asei on a dirabanan level at the least.</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, before you gave the gift, you would have to verify that the recipient would be using it on Shabbat.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If it is le-tzorech Shabbos, i.e. necessary for Shabbos use. This is\nactually a broad heter, as many gifts you may want to give, e.g. wine,\nliqueur, chocolate, cake, etc can definitely be construed as\nle-tzorech Shabbos. <strong>The weakness here is that they are not actually\nnecessary for Shabbos use, as your hosts likely planned sufficient\nfood and drink without taking into account the gift that you will\nbring</strong>. So it may be useful for Shabbos, but is it necessary for\nShabbos?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, it seems that the responsibility is more on you prior to giving the gift, but the recipient also must follow up with the action of using it. Don't give a bottle of wine that you think the recipient won't use. Better, call before Shabbat and verify if they will use it.</p>\n<p>(In this context \"tzorech\" is translated as \"necessary\". It's a loose translation, as it seems that they mean using it even if the recipient feels that, technically, they don't \"need\" it.

And that is where the question arises whether the intended recipient will use it on Shabbos or not. And if he will not use it, is it allowed to have given it to him. </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/ostroff/archives/shabbos3_33.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Halachos shown by Rabbi Ostroff to\nHaGaon HaRav Moshe Sternbuch, shlita</a> he says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think though that if one brings a good bottle of wine and it is\n  intended to be opened at the meal then it may be given on\n  Shabbos l’chatchila because it is needed for the sake of Shabbos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I once heard that even if it is not opened, it should still be allowed as the recipient will still have benefit from it on Shabbos in that he knows he has not depleted his stock of wine  (because  the gift makes up for the wine he served).</p>\n\n<p>2) The comments given in (1) above apply when there has been no use of an eruv to transport the gift. But where an eruv is going to be used, we need to remember that as <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/700456/jewish/What-Is-an-Eruv.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... items which will only be used after Shabbat also cannot be carried\n  on Shabbat, even within the eruv.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and so if the eruv has been used the wine will need to be drunk on Shabbos. </p>\n\n\n",

The Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Sforno, and Chezkuni all agree on this: Yaakov was \"legally blind\" to the point that he could not see any details, but was able to see that there was a person there.</p>\n<p>This is actually similar to personal experience. My mother is nearly like this: she can discern shapes, but no details without her glasses.</p>\n<p>To quote those sources:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Genesis.48.8.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ראה שהם בני אדם אבל לא הכיר מי הם:‏</p>\n<p>He saw that there were people, but he didn't recognize who they were.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rashbam_on_Genesis.48.8.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbam</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף על פי שכתוב לפנינו ולא יוכל לראות. יש רואה דמות אדם ואין מכיר דמות פניו.‏</p>\n<p>Even though the preceding verse said that he wasn't able to see, he could see the shape of a person, even if he couldn't see the details on the face.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Genesis.48.8.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואחר שאמר וירא ישראל את בני יוסף איך יאמר לא יוכל לראות. רק טעמו לראות היטב שיכירם.‏</p>\n<p>After the verse says \"And Yisrael saw the children of Yosef,\" how could it say that he wasn't able to see?

He quotes a Medrash Hagadol (8) that Yaakov's eyes got weak because he saw the Yeravam and Achav coming out of Ephraim and Menasheh. This is why Leah's eyes and Yaakov's eyes got weak, because of the eyes of the rishaim. \nSo according to this, Yaakov's eyes were fine up until he saw Ephraim and Menasheh.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi in Vayechi also mentions this idea of Yaakov losing his ruach hakidesh after seeing the bad progeny, Yeravam and Achav from Ephraim and Yehu and his sons from Menasheh. He is quoting the Tanchuma #6 that actually asks how can it be that Yaakov didn't recognize them after spending seventeen years with them.</p>\n\n<p>The answer being the loss of the shechina. It would be possible to combine these two pshatim, the weak eyes being the result of the los of ruach hakodesh, and I'm pretty sure when I was a kid in school that was the standard, but the Tanchuma continues that Yosef prayed for the ruach hakodesh to return, which it did. Rashi mentions this as well, but in passuk 9, before the Torah mentions that Yaakov's eyes were weak, so unless you can claim that part is out of order, or some other idea, it seems these won't work together. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>it doesnt say he could not see. it says his eyes were \"heavy\".</p>\n\n<p>once read a midrash somewhere that says he could not open his eyelids due to their being swollen and they had to be propped open so he could see. probably due to his tremendous hasmada learning day and night.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Halachik issues with SodaStream and similar sodamakers on Shabbos (e.g. molid, hashmaas kol)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is disputed whether soda/seltzer makers are a problem on <em>Shabbos</em> (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1390/making-seltzer-soda-water-on-shabbat-or-yom-tov/51281#51281\">Making seltzer/soda water on Shabbat or Yom Tov</a> ) with e.g. the <em>Shemiras Shabbos K'hilchasa</em> ruling leniently (as cited in Rabbi Dovid Ribiat's \"The 39 <em>Melochos</em>\").  </p>\n\n<p>The focus in these works seems to be primarily <em>m'leches makeh b'patish</em> (completing) (and/or uvda d'chol [weekday activities]).  Is there an explicit discussion in the poskim, with regard to soda-makers, of the issue of molid (creating something new; a la, e.g., the Rabbinic ban on infusing clothing with incense smoke)? </p>\n\n<p>Also, the <a href=\"http://compliant.sodastream.com/faq\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">instructions</a> (at least on the SodaStream sodamaker) make explicit use of the sounds created by the device to determine when the seltzer is ready (e.g. \"press the carbonating button several times until you hear the LOUD BUZZ that indicates carbonation\"). Do <em>poskim</em> address whether this is a problem of the Rabbinic ban on <em>hashmaas kol</em> (making a noise)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Regarding the issue of hashmaas kol, see Darkei Moshe (Orach Chaim 252, 7) who quotes a number of Rishonim who understood that hashmaas kol is prohibited only if the sound will cause people to suspect you did something prohibited on Shabbat, like if they hear the flour grinder churning they will suspect you are operating it on Shabbat (even though you set it up before Shabbat). But if the sound will not cause suspicion (like by a clock which everyone knows is set up before Shabbat) there is no prohibition. Based on this logic poskim have permitted the use of refrigerators, air conditioners etc. even though they may make a lot of noise, since no one will come to suspect that one has operated them on Shabbat.\nAccordingly, if it is permitted to use the SodaStream on Shabbat, then the noise is not problematic as it will not incur suspicion that one is doing something prohibited. \nAdditionaly, the noise usually discussed by hashmaas kol is noise that is loud enough to be heard by people outside (and thus raise the suspicion). I am not sure that a SodaStream is indeed that loud. </p>\n\n\n",

More on this methodology is discussed by R. Kalman Kahane in <em>Heker VeYiyun</em> I, pg. 150-152</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, there are also sources (Gra-related and otherwise) on a similar topic: The Netziv (Sheiltos Bamidbar 128) says דרך הגמרא לעקם פירוש המשנה כדי לאוקמה הלכה, the Gemara will distort the intended meaning of the Mishnaic text in order to have it conform to the Halakha. Such a position was likely influenced by writings of the Vilna Gaon's students, as this is explicitly stated in his name by his student, R. Baruch of Shklov, in his introduction to the Pe'as Hashulchan. </p>\n\n<p>There are a few earlier sources for such an understanding, to give a few examples (out of many): </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Ramban to Gitin 82a says that a particular position is that of the Amoraim alone who are 'hanging' it upon the mishnah</p></li>\n<li><p>Rif (Brachos, Rif 24a) writes that he'd rather pasken the halakha according to the mishnah's simple reading than according to forced explanations in order to fit it with other opinions</p></li>\n<li><p>The Meiri in his introduction to Maseches Avos refers to these odds methods of 'interpreting' Mishna as לחלוק עמהם בקצת דברים, and R. Havlin's footnote there connects his position to that of the Netziv</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Almost all acharonim, particularly chassidim make\n this.

    "content": "# The age of Machir's Sons\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am trying to understand a comment written in the Stone Edition Chuash (page 288) on Bereishit 50:23. On the statement that Yosef was alive to have his great-great grandchildren through Ephraim on his knees, and the sons of Machir, his grandson through Menashe, also on his knees, the commentary reads, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The point has been made that Machir's sons were contemporaries of\n  Moses (Numbers 26:29), and they were among the fourth generation that\n  God had promised to liberate from Egypt (15:16). When they were\n  children, they had seen Joseph, the greatest of his generation, and\n  they would live to enter <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the Jewish Timeline Encyclopedia, Yosef died in 2309, the slavery began in 2332, and the Exodus was in 2448. The slavery was then 116 years long and Machir and his sons were alive for at least 139 years (the youngest, assuming they were born on the day Yosef died) and probably older than that to have been able to spend any appreciable time on Yosef's knees. Ignoring the incredible age to which they lived (minimum 139 years old when even Levi died at 137) how could they enter the land of Israel -- wouldn't they have been condemned to die in the desert as they were older than 20 years old?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's possible that this comment is based on the midrash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bamidbar_Rabbah.14.7?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabbah 14:7</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...הֲרֵי שְׁלשָׁה כְּנֶגֶד שְׁלשָׁה דוֹרוֹת שֶׁרָאָה יוֹסֵף מִן מְנַשֶּׁה שֶׁנָּטְלוּ חֵלֶק בָּאָרֶץ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (בראשית נ, כג): גַּם בְּנֵי מָכִיר בֶּן מְנַשֶּׁה יֻלְדוּ עַל בִּרְכֵּי יוֹסֵף, וְכֵן הוּא אוֹמֵר (במדבר כו, כט ל): בְּנֵי מְנַשֶּׁה לְמָכִיר מִשְׁפַּחַת הַמָּכִירִי וּמָכִיר הוֹלִיד אֶת גִּלְעָד וגו' אֵלֶּה בְּנֵי גִּלְעָד אִיעֶזֶר וגו', מָכִיר וְגִלְעָד וְאִיעֶזֶר, הֲרֵי שְׁלשָׁה דוֹרוֹת שֶׁהָיוּ בָּתֵּי אָבוֹת שֶׁנִּקְרְאוּ עַל שֵׁם יוֹסֵף, כִּי מְנַשֶּׁה עַל שֵׁם יַעֲקֹב נִקְרָא, כְּמָה דְתֵימָא (בראשית מח, ה): וְעַתָּה שְׁנֵי בָנֶיךָ הַנּוֹלָדִים לְךָ בְּאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם עַד בֹּאִי אֵלֶיךָ מִצְרַיְמָה לִי הֵם, וְהָרְבִיעִי זֶה הָיָה יָאִיר בֶּן מְנַשֶּׁה שֶׁנָּטַל חֵלֶק בָּאָרֶץ, כְּמָה דְתֵימָא (במדבר לב, מא): וְיָאִיר בֶּן מְנַשֶּׁה הָלַךְ וַיִלְכֹּד אֶת חַוֹּתֵיהֶם וַיִּקְרָא אֶתְהֶן חַוֹּת יָאִיר...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: So [we] have three against the three generations that Yosef saw from Menasheh that received portions in the land, as it says: \"the children of Machir son of Manasseh were likewise born upon Joseph’s knees\" and it is also said: \"Descendants of Manasseh: Of Machir, the clan of the Machirites.—Machir begot Gilead.—Of Gilead, the clan of the Gileadites. These were the descendants of Gilead: [Of] Iezer etc\" Machir and Gilad and Iezer, therefore three generations which were clans that were named after Yosef, for Menasheh was named after Yaakov, as it is written: \"Now, your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, shall be mine\" and the fourth was Yair ben Menasheh who took a portion in the land, as it is written: \"Jair son of Manasseh went and captured their villages, which he renamed Havvoth-jair\"...\"</p>\n<p>In which case, it seems that the idea is that <em>symbolically</em> Machir and his son(s) entered Yisrael, as there were clans (בתי אב) named after each of them.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What \"end\" was Yaakov prevented from revealing, and to what extent does S'forno disagree?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <em>B'reshis</em> 49:1, <em>Yaakov</em> tells his sons:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Gather, and I'll tell you what will occur to you in the end of the days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>S'forno</em> explains \"in the end of the days\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>at the end of the days, with the coming of a redeemer…. And <em>Yaakov</em> told this in his saying [verses 10–11] \"<em>Shilo</em> will come, and to him a gathering of nations, tying to the vine his donkey foal\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em> agrees with part of this explanation of verses 10–11. He writes in explanation of \"until <em>Shilo</em> will come\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the messiah-king, whose is kingdom</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You'd think, then, that <em>Rashi</em> would explain as <em>S'frono</em> does in verse 1: that <em>Yaakov</em> revealed the \"end\" in verse 10. But he doesn't. He writes instead:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Yaakov</em> sought to reveal the end, and the divine presence left him, and he began to say other things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is the difference of opinion between <em>Rashi</em> and <em>S'forno</em> here? Specifically:</p>\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em> and the <em>S'forno</em> interpret part of verses 10–11 differently from one another. For example, <em>Rashi</em> doesn't mention that the messiah will ride a donkey (as I quote from <em>S'forno</em> above). Is <strong>that</strong> the \"end\" that <em>Rashi</em> says <em>Yaakov</em> was prevented from telling? (That would explain why <em>S'forno</em> doesn't agree <em>Yaakov</em> was prevented: he explains the later verses as <em>Yaakov</em>'s telling those details.) If not — if, in fact, there's <strong>more</strong> that, according to <em>Rashi</em>, <em>Yaakov</em> was prevented from telling — then</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>does <em>S'forno</em> maintain he told it? Or does he agree <em>Yaakov</em> was prevented from telling it?</li>\n<li>what was it? (Most likely we don't know the exact content. After all, <em>Yaakov</em> was prevented from telling it. But what <strong>sort</strong> of information was it?)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rashi says - as I've always been taught - that Yaakov intended to inform them the time of the final redemption. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רש\"י  ואגידה לכם. בקש לגלות את הקץ  ונסתלקה ממנו שכינה, והתחיל אומר דברים אחרים (ב\"ר צח, ב.): (רש\"י) ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At that point the information was withheld from him and he started talking about other things - i.e. blessing each one, as Rashi summarised in verse 28. -  וַיְבָרֶךְ אוֹתָם אִישׁ אֲשֶׁר כְּבִרְכָתוֹ בֵּרַךְ אֹתָם:</p>\n\n<p>The Seforno says that Yaakov is going to speak about the future.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ספורנו  באחרית הימים. לקץ הימין בבוא גואל שיהיה אחרית ימי האומות אויבי ה' ומלכותם שתתמלא סאתם עד סוף מלואה כאמרו כי אעשה כלה וכו' וכזה דבר בלעם באמרו באחרית הימים כמו שהעיד באמרו וקרקר כל בני שת וכן הנביאים באמרם והיה באחרית הימים יהיה הר בית ה' נכון כראש ההרים וזה הגיד יעקב כזה באמרו כי יבא שילה ולו יקהת עמים אוסרי לגפן עירה וכו': (ספורנו)  ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you follow the Seforno on each individual Bracha, you will see that he mentions certain things as being relevant to Moshiach-times. E.g. verse 12: חכלילי עינים מיין - וכאמרם עתידה ארץ ישראל שתוציא גלוסקאות וכלי מילת.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that Rashi says that Yaakov wanted to inform them when the end of days would happen, and what it will be all about, abut he was prevented from doing so.</p>\n\n<p>A hint of this information is given in the Targum Yonathan:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יונתן  וּקְרָא יַעֲקב לִבְנוֹי וַאֲמַר לְהוֹם אִדַכּוּ מִסוֹאֲבוּתָא וְאֲחַוִי לְכוֹן רַזְיָיא סְתִימַיָא קִיצַיָיא גְנִיזַיָא וּמַתַּן אַגְרְהוֹן דְצַדִיקַיָיא וּפוּרְעָנוּתְהוֹן דִרְשִׁיעַיָא וּטְלָנֵיתָא דְעֵדֶן מָה הִיא כַּחֲדָא מִתְכַּנְשִׁין תְּרֵיסַר שִׁבְטֵי יִשְרָאֵל מַקְפִין דַרְגְשָׁא דְדַהֲבָא דִרְבִיעַ עֲלָהּ מִן דְאִיתְגְלֵי אִיקָר שְׁכִינְתָּא דַיְיָ קִיצָא דְעָתִיד מַלְכָּא מְשִׁיחָא לְמֵיתֵי אִיתְכְּסֵי מִינֵיהּ וּבְכֵן אָמַר אִיתוּ וְאִיתְנֵי לְכוֹן מַה דְיֶאֱרַע יַתְכוֹן בְּסוֹף יוֹמַיָא: (תרגום יונתן)  ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Roughly translated as: Yaakov calls his sons and informs then: I will tell you the secrets of the end of days, the reward of the righteous and punishment of the wicked and the details of Gan Eden. So his 12 sons gathered around his golden bed, and when he was about to inform them of the timing of the coming of Moshiach, the information was taken from him and instead he started telling them what each one's role would be in the end of days.</p>\n\n<p>The Seforno seems to think that Yaakov informs each one what his role will be in the future - some to the end  of days, but he doesn't discuss the timing.</p>\n\n<p>Sources can be seen <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01424_part_12.html#%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AAB%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7-%D7%9E%D7%98-%7B%D7%90%7D\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

The names that were given in much older times were so common and so accepted that they are now part of what everyone considers \"Jewish\" names. The names that we today think of as \"double-barreled names\" are combinations of the shem kodesh and the \"street name\". In \"old time\" Germany and France, a child named Shlomo was given the name Zalman at his chol kreisch. He was called Zalman (the exact same as the German secular name Salman or Salomon) on the street and at home, and was called to the Torah as Shlomo. The same is true of Zev, who would be called Volf by most people (with the nickname Velvel at home perhaps); Dov, who would be called Behr; Eliezer, who would be called Lipman; Elyakim, who would be called Goetzel; Meshulam, who would be called Zalman; Shraga or Uri, who would be called Feist or Feit or Feis; Yehoshua, who would be called Falk; Aryeh or Yehudah would be called Loeb/Leib; and on and on. Some of these names have fallen out of usage (such as Falk and Feist), and are today found only among Jews with closer ancestry from Germany. Others, like Zalman and Behr, are very commonly used.</p>\n\n<p>These \"street names\" seem to have entered the \"full\" shem kodesh whenever Jews gave the names in lands where the \"street name\" no longer made sense, since German wasn't spoken in those places, such as Russia or Poland. Even still, while some people may be called to the Torah as Yehudah Leib, for instance, others will be called it only as a nickname. I have two friends named Leibish, one is called \"Aryeh Leibish\" fully, and the other is named Aryeh Yehudah, and goes by Leibish. While many might call it a \"Jewish name\", the fact is that Leibish originated as the German version of Hebrew names connected to \"lion\".</p>\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer has a tshuvah that says you should not call the person to the Torah by both their shem kodesh and \"street name\", like Shlomo Zalman, but only by their shem kodesh. The problem with that today is, since certain areas of Europe were no longer aware that both names weren't the shem kodesh, the \"street name\" entered the shem kodesh, and for many people is inseparable.</p>\n\n<p>When I did my son's chol kreisch, I didn't say the name as it appears on his birth certificate, but the name that we call him, which is the \"nickname\" for his name. This is a bit funny, as he is named after my wife's side, and has a double barreled name that includes the old German-Yiddish \"street name\" in his shem kodesh.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How and when did fedoras arise as acceptable headwear?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Today I <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora\">learned</a> that the fedora was originally a woman's hat, invented/popularized for women in the late 19th century and only migrating into menswear after 1924 when Prince Edward of England started wearing them.</p>\n\n<p>Per the torah men are forbidden to wear women's clothing (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0522.htm#5\">Devarim 22:5</a>), but the fedora is ubiquitous in parts of the Orthodox community so this is clearly not understood as a violation of that commandment.  So how did its use come about in the Jewish community, and when?  (I doubt we were much concerned with the fashion trends of English nobility.)</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps Jewish use of the fedora is fairly recent and by then it was well-established as a man's hat so its origins don't matter?  Is our adoption of it enough later than 1924 for this to be plausible?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we say that the fedora, being only about 125 years old to begin with, didn't have a long-standing association with women (just a few decades) so we can disregard that no matter when we adopted it?</p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps the fedoras worn today harken back to something much older, that was always a man's hat, and a late-19th-century fashion fad isn't relevant?</p>\n\n<p>What is the history of Jewish men wearing fedoras?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Jewish men have worn a plethora of hat wear, but the popularity of the fedora seems to have stemmed from the last Chabad Lubavitch Rebbe, R. Menachem Schneerson. R. Schneerson's adoption of this hat, which would influence the hat wearing of fellow Chabad members, is historically marked to his ascent in becoming the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, after the death of the previous rebbe (R. Yosef Yitzchak) in 1950. As Maya Balakirsky Katz writes, in <em>The Visual Culture of Chabad</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...after the death of his father-in-law, Schneerson actively campaigned for popular favor over his brother-in-law Shmaryahu Gourary. When Yosef Yitzchak's widow demurred from gifting her late husband's signature Hasidic fur hat (<em>shtraymel</em>) to her younger son-in-law, Schneerson adopted the far more American black fedora, which eventually became the standard Chabad choice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By this time, the fedora had already become a stylish American hat for men, popularized by Hollywood male stars (cf. Humphrey Bogart); as a personal aside, I would guess that the glorification of the gangster in film noirs made the fedora probably the <em>least</em> feminine hat imaginable by this time. Whatever R. Schneerson's intentions for adopting this now American hat, its influence was huge and engendered its own mythology. As a January 13th, 2006 editorial from the Haredi <em>Yated Neeman</em> newspaper once put it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...there are certain defining articles that link us to our ideology...One of these signature articles of clothing, if not the most distinguishable one, has been the fedora-style hat. The black hat. It is what marks a ben Torah, and distinguishes him from all other segments of Jewish society. From the time President John F. Kennedy shucked his fedora at his 1960 inauguration ceremony and replaced it with the new look of freedom, the black hat assumed a heightened significance in society at large. It is the declaration that we still cling to the old generation; we still embrace the old values that we were taught and are not embarrassed to be called \"old-fashioned black hatters. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ironically, what once displayed a new direction for a religious movement, marking the transplantation of a Chassidic community into a new land, would later become a prime signifier for unassailable tradition. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>The law regarding wearing men and women's clothing is dependent on the time and community. What is upheld as His Garment now that hat the fedora was worn by men and women. Just different styles, both called \"fedoras\" it became part of a dress style looking culture difference sectsin. \n<br>different movements continued that tradition. The same is with the long black coat that many Jews wear. Because it is held that we must look respectable before God at all times so they will this Garb which includes the dress fedora hat and either a jacket or coat.</p>\n\n\n",

It seems to me that when Yocheved brought Moshe to the daughter of Pharaoh, as a nursemaid brings a child to his mother, <b>Moshe</b> thought that he was the son of Pharaoh's daughter, and this is the meaning of ויהי לה לבן, \"and he was to her a son;\" and to correct this impression of his, she then named him Moshe, in Hebrew, that he should know that he is a child of the Hebrews, and not her son.</i></p>\n\n<p><br />The שפתי כהן offers a possibility that actually resembles your dream-suggestion somewhat: He proposes that \"And Moshe grew up\" may be understood as \"grew into prophecy\" (by parallel with a similar description of Shmuel) and says that it was by his newly-acquired prophetic power that he knew that the enslaved people were his brothers. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עוד נאמר כי ויגדל הוא בנבואה, כמו שאמר בשמואל (שמואל-א ג' י\"ט) ויגדל שמואל וה' היה עמו שהיה גדול לנבואה כן כאן ויגדל שניבא וידע שאותם שהם בגלות הם אחיו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><i>He prophesied, and knew that the exiled ones were his brothers.</i></p>\n\n<p>(Credit for neat summary of possibilities goes to R'Y.Kolatch, who gave a shiur including this.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><strong>Presumably his family told him.</strong> In other words, what makes us think it was a secret?</p>\n\n<p>The Torah gives us this (paraphrased) timeline:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Par'o</em>'s daughter finds Moshe, saying \"this baby is a Hebrew!\" So she knows and is doing nothing close to hiding it.</li>\n<li>Moshe's sister (who is known to <em>Par'o</em>'s daughter) suggests finding a Hebrew nurse for him.

Note that he uses the arbitrary \"they told him\" he was a member of the slave nation, whereas the only antecedents in that snippet are singular. He is not specifying that <em>Par'o</em>'s daughter informed Moshe of his parentage, but rather that he had been told. Again, the simplest assumption would be that he was told by people he knew, and that would be his <em>Ivri</em> family members and acquaintances, interaction with whom I see no reason to assume were limited. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Maybe because he had a brit milah, which the Egyptians didn’t have.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is considered to be \"firstborn\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is probably a bit pedantic and beside-the-point, but here goes: in Exodus 12 (I am reading the Jewish Publication Society translation), we have:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>12 For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. 13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>29 And it came to pass at midnight, that the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle. 30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was wondering about what is meant to be considered \"the firstborn\" in this context, beyond possibly referring to male children - this detail is something I'm not sure of, since I have absolutely no idea where I picked it up. (My guess - from reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firstborn_(Judaism)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> - is that this should be correct.) Moreover, from the second passage, this would suggest that this applies to the firstborn of <em>each</em> intra-family generation to me. However:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I'm merely making an educated guess here. Am I correct on the above points? It strikes me as slightly weird for, for instance, a firstborn elderly man to die, but this is something that I can \"live\" with.</p></li>\n<li><p>Is there any indication (whether textual, or through some sort of tradition) if this applies to the firstborn of a father, or to that of a mother? Naturally in many cases, this shouldn't matter, but in others (e.g. remarriage of widowed individuals) it does.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These aren't really issues that affect the meaning of the text for me, from a \"moral\" angle, but I'm curious about whether or not some specifics are ever actually addressed.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Due to Egyptian immorality, there were actually a lot of firstborns.

However, he doesn't specify <em>in what way</em> we should bless our children to be \"like Efraim and Menasheh.\"</p>\n\n<p>There isn't much discussion of the lives of אפרים and מנשה in Chumash, at least not <em>explicitly</em>. The only thing that comes to mind, at least for me, is what Rashi says (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8243#showrashi=true&v=1\">Bereishit 48:1</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש אומרים אפרים היה רגיל לפני יעקב בתלמוד</p>\n  \n  <p>Some say that [the person who notified Yosef about his father's\n  illness was] Efraim, because he was often found in front of Yaakov, in\n  order to learn [Torah] from him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<em>translation mine</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Spending time learning Torah with your grandfather is a great trait, but I'm not sure if that's the intent of Yaakov's bracha, quoted above; besides for the fact that this is only attributed to Efraim, and not to Menashe (<em>IIRC some would explain that that was the case because Menashe, as the bechor, had to help his father with matters of state</em>) -- this, then, would hardly be a blessing of being similar to \"Efraim <strong>and Menashe</strong>.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what, specifically, is the blessing of being \"like Efraim and Menashe\"?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>I heard nice explanation from my rabbi Boruch Myers.</p>\n\n<p>As they grew up observant in non-jewish society, so we bless our children that outside influences shouldn't influence them.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Ephraim was the younger son and yet he exceeded Menashe, his older brother. The Bnei Yisoschar says that there were two possible negative reactions to this - Menashe could have been jealous of Ephraim having surpassed him, and Ephraim could have become haughty and lorded it over Menashe.  Their greatness was that Menashe acknowledged the achievements of Ephraim, and Ephraim did not pride himself over that he had surpassed his brother.  Yaakov was thus able to put Ephraim before Menashe for the blessing, and this itself is the blessing - that Ephraim is put before Menashe, and there are no qualms about it.  Our children should similarly have shalom and mutual respect.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Here are a couple more explanations:</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Or HaChayim</em> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38295&st=&pgnum=135\" rel=\"nofollow\">ad loc.</a>) writes that Ya'akov gave Ephraim and Menasheh the maximum possible blessing. Therefore, people would give blessings accordingly and reference that they also want to give the greatest possible blessing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פירוש בירך אותם כל כך ברכות עד גדר שאין ברכה למעלה ממנה עד שהכל אומרים בך ראוי לברך ישראל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Maharal (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30848&st=&pgnum=198\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Gur Aryeh</em> ad. loc.</a>) writes that Ephraim and Menasheh would become so renowned that people would invoke their names when blessing their own children:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שכל כך יהיו אפרים ומנשה חשובים עד שמי שבא לברך את בנו יברך אותו כך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

To see the Hebrew original, see <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&pgnum=19\">this page of the Mishnah Berurah</a>. R' Ze'ev Greenwald adds that \"<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Txt4EidAVFEC&pg=PA7\">the hands must be washed immediately</a>\". The Institute for Dayanim notes that ritual handwashing <a href=\"http://www.dinonline.org/2012/04/12/netilas-yadayim-after-shaving/\">might not actually be necessary after shaving</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>I tend to cut my own hair. (Since I own an electric hair clipper, it's not that difficult.)</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch says I must wash my hands, but it doesn't say how many times I must wash each hand.</p>\n\n<p>Can I just rinse my hands (both at once) under a stream of running water from the tap, or must I pour water from a vessel? If I must use a vessel, then how many times must I pour water on each hand?</p>\n\n<p>(Please cite a source. In case it matters, I'm Ashkenazic.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>See the <em>Shaarei Teshuva</em>, a commentary which is printed in most editions of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Shaarei Teshuva</em> on <em>Orach Chaim</em> 4:12, citing the <em>Machzik Bracha</em>, writes that getting out of bed in the morning needs three times and a vessel, but other things (bathroom is a machlokes) do not. Why? Because the <a href=\"//judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/26846/what-is-ruach-rah\" rel=\"nofollow\">ruach ra'ah</a> is not the same level as when one sleeps. However, he mentions two things which <em>do</em> require three because of tumah. Since cutting hair is not mentioned (in the <em>Shaarei Teshuva</em>) it would seem that any washing would be sufficient. </p>\n\n<p>If a vessel is available and there is enough water then one should be concerned for the stringent opinions (cited below) which hold that one does need three pours and a vessel. (<em>Piskei Teshuvos</em> 4:18:169). However, the <em>Shaarei Teshuva</em> seems to hold that to be unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding shaving, the <em>Piskei Teshuvos</em> (4:28, footnotes 262, 263, and 264) writes that only cutting the hair of the head requires washing not shaving (Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach). Cutting other people's hair also require washing but when being honored by an upsherin one does not need to wash for cutting of a few hairs.</p>\n\n<p>For an in depth analysis of this topic the <em>Piskei Teshuva</em> 4:18 goes through the four classes that require washing. In that se'if, he explains and goes through many of the shittos, including the halachic side and kabbalistic side. He also brings the <em>Shaarei Teshuva</em> mentioned above.</p>\n\n\n",

As it is written (Leviticus 19, 17) \"you shall surely rebuke\". If he rebuked and it wasn't accepted, how do we know that he should return and rebuke? The verse says \"surely rebuke\", under all circumstances. One might have thought even if his face changes [i.e. you rebuke him in public and he is embarrassed (Rashi)], so the verse teaches \"do not bear a sin\". We have a teaching: R' Tarfon said \"I would be astounded if there is someone in this generation that can accept rebuke; were one to say 'remove the splinter from between your teeth', he would respond 'remove the beam from between your eyes'.\" R' Elazar ben Azariah said \"I would be astounded if there is someone in this generation that knows how to give rebuke\"...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The gemara goes on to discuss a couple of stories in which various Rabbis were involved in either giving or not giving rebuke and at which point is one legally exempt from giving rebuke.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What are the origins of the תושלב\"ע prayer at the end of holy books?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When I finished the Book of Bereishit this Shabbos, the Tanakh I was reading concluded with this prayer:</p>\n\n<p>תם ונשלם תהילה לאל בורא עולם<br>\n<em>(Finished and completed. Praise to G!d, Creator of the Universe.)</em></p>\n\n<p>I guess I've never noticed this inscription before, but apparently it is typically inscribed at the end of religious books. However, the little information I can find on it says it's usually abbreviated תושלב\"ע, and that it uses the word שבח, not תהילה, for the word translated as \"praise.\"</p>\n\n<p>What are the origins of this prayer, where is it usually inscribed, and what accounts for these differences in the wording about praise? (And why אל instead of a more direct name for G!d typically used in prayer?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Your question is essentially broken into four parts.</p>\n\n<p>1) What is the origin of this <em>prayer</em>?</p>\n\n<p>2) Where is it usually inscribed?</p>\n\n<p>3) What accounts for the two types of praise (שבח and תהלה) used in the inscription?</p>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<p>4) Why is G-d's name (אל שדי) used as opposed to other names?</p>\n\n<p>First it should noted that this is not a prayer in the sense of a request to G-d. It is more like a statement of praise.</p>\n\n<p>As you point out, תושלב״ע is a <em>Notarikon</em> formed from the first letters of the phrase, תם ונשלם שבח לאל (שדי) בורא עולם.</p>\n\n<p>As to its origin, if you mean its first usage, as far as I know, this is impossible to determine. It has been used to mark the completion of Jewish texts for at least 1000 years, but is likely much older.</p>\n\n<p>There are sometimes slight variations from one author or another (<a href=\"http://notrikon.blogspot.com/2012/07/blog-post_30.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">like noted at this link</a>) in regard to intended meaning. But the most common formats are תושלב״ע or תותלב״ע as you noted in your question. The second form stands for: תם ונשלמת תהלה לאל בורא עולם.</p>\n\n<p>The inscription is not mandatory, but when it is used, it usually is placed at the end of books. This is in keeping with the meaning of the phrase it represents.</p>\n\n<p>It is written by the author when they complete a book and is intended to parallel G-d's act of completing creation, which is the root and source of all acts of completion. This is in keeping with the teaching of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Ber_of_Mezeritch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dov Ber, the Maggid of Mezerich</a> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Maggid_Devarav_leYaakov.50.1?vhe=Maggid_Devarav_leYa%27akov,_Koretz,_1781&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maggid D'varav l'Yaakov 50:1</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין דבר למטה שאין לו שרש למעלה כידוע אין לך עשב וכו' ושורש כל השרשים הוא רצון הקדמון שעלה ברצונו לברוא את העולמות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In order to address your question about the two types of praise mentioned, it requires first understanding the meaning of the opening words, תם ונשלם.</p>\n\n<p>תם is from the verb root תמם and means <em>to make (or to be made) whole</em>. This follows the explanation of the word by <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharon_Kotler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Aharon Kotler, z\"l</a> in his introduction to <a href=\"https://www.otzar.org/wotzar/book.aspx?153527&\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Orot HaGra, paragraph 4 on the posuk from Tehillim 19:8</a> where he says:</p>\n\n<p>תורת ה׳ תמימה משיבת נפש, אימתי משיבת נפש כשהיא תמימה כו׳ וחלק הנסתר שבתורה וסודות הדברים מתאימות עם הפשט וההלכה וכולם כקומה שלמה אחת כו׳ וכן הוא בכל חלקי פרד״ס (<em>פשט, רמז, דרוש וסוד</em>) כו׳ וכמו כן נצפנו כל סודות העולמות, מה שהיה והוה ומה שעתיד להיות. (<em>היינו כל עולם הזה וגם כל עולם הבא</em>) .כו׳ </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://he.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%9D_(%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A9)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">binyan of תם is kal and in the first person. It can be either past tense (a completed action) or present (continuous) tense</a>. In the context of a book author, it would be understood in past tense, that the author completed the book. But in the context of the conclusion of the phrase (בורא עולם), it means <em>continuously being made whole</em>. This follows the same format as found in the Yotzer blessing said before morning Shema, how G-d continuously creates and forms all of creation every moment.</p>\n\n<p>Another point to mention from the end of the quote from Rabbi Kotler is that the word תם also suggests an alternate meaning to the <em>notarikon</em> \n תושלב״ע. It also has a meaning of תו שלבי עולם. There are two stages to the creation of the universe. (In keeping with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Yetzirah.2?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Yetzirah 2:3</a>, the letter Tav of תו is exchangeable with the letter Dalet.) And this principle about the two stages is in keeping with what <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.2.4?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi explains to Bereshit 2:4</a>.</p>\n\n<p>נשלם is from the <a href=\"https://he.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%A9%D7%81%D7%9C%D7%9D_(%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A9)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">root שלם meaning complete or perfect and is in the binyan <em>nifal</em> (passive/reflexive)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The change in binyan between תם and נשלם indicates the one doing the action (תם) and the effect upon the receiver of the action (נשלם). That G-d is continuously making the creation whole and as a consequence, the creation is complete or perfect.</p>\n\n<p>With this understanding it is now possible to explain the variations used in the types of praise.</p>\n\n<p>שבח is referring to the <em>Shechinah</em>, G-d's revealed presence, like is explained in Sefer Kehillat Yaacov by <a href=\"http://dailyzohar.com/tzadikim/314-Rabbi-Yaakov-Tzvi-Yalish-Yolles-of-Dinov\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yaacov Tzvi Yolles</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=267\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ערך שבח</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are two aspects of Shechinah discussed in the Torah, Upper level Shechinah which is associated with the Heavenly realm (the aspect Malchut as it relates to Binah) and lower level Shechinah which is associated with this physical, material world (the aspect of Malchut), as explained in Sefer Kehillat Yaacov, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=276&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ערך שכינה</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Malchut, in general, is the completion of all <em>Sefirot</em> and is a vessel to receive the influence of all the Sefirot above it.</p>\n\n<p>תהלה is associated with this upper level aspect of Shechinah like is explained in Sefer Kehillat Yaacov, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=288\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ערך תהלה</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And this explains why there are these two forms of praise used in this expression.</p>\n\n<p>And this leads to the 4th and final part of your question, namely why does it use this particular name of G-d?</p>\n\n<p>This concept is discussed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.12a.15?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 12a</a> in the name of Reish Lakish which explains that the name <em>El Shaddai</em> is the name associated with completing each act of creation. Like it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמר רב יהודה אמר רב <strong>בשעה שברא הקב\"ה את העולם היה מרחיב והולך כשתי פקעיות של שתי עד שגער בו הקב\"ה והעמידו</strong> שנאמר עמודי שמים ירופפו ויתמהו מגערתו והיינו <strong>דאמר ר\"ל מאי דכתיב (בראשית לה, יא) אני אל שדי אני הוא שאמרתי לעולם די</strong> אמר ר\"ל בשעה שברא הקב\"ה את הים היה מרחיב והולך עד שגער בו הקב\"ה ויבשו שנאמר (נחום א, ד) גוער בים ויבשהו וכל הנהרות החריב</p>\n  \n  <p>Reish Lakish said: What is the meaning of that which is written: “I am the Almighty God [El Shaddai]” (Genesis 17:1)? It means: I am He Who said to the world “enough [dai],” instructing it to stop expanding.<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.12a.15?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It might seem curious that G-d would need to tell the process of creation and formation, which is associated with other names of G-d mentioned in parshat Bereshit, to stop. But if one considers what unrestricted and uncontrolled formation means in regard to living things, it is more obvious. Cancer is, in general, the unrestricted and uncontrolled formation of cells. A consequence, so to speak, of the absence of that limit.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why didn't the Israelites fight against being enslaved?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parashat Shemot, the pasuk says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּאמֶר, אֶל-עַמּוֹ:  הִנֵּה, עַם בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל--רַב וְעָצוּם, מִמֶּנּוּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pharaoh was, for whatever reason, worried that the Israelites had become more numerous than the Egyptians, so he imposed extra taxes on them and eventually enslaved them. But if the Israelites were actually greater in numbers than the Egyptians, why did they submit to slavery? Why didn't they fight back against their oppression? They should have been able to overcome with their greater numbers.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As usual, Mefarshim quoted are from <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Shemot/1.9#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<p>Part 1: Were the Jews actually greater in number than the Egyptians?</p>\n\n<p>Ralbag, Chizkuni, R\"A Ben Harambam and others explain that obviously the Jewish population had not grown larger than the population of the entire Egypt, rather, they were growing at a greater rate than the Egyptians, who feared that at some point the Jews would eventually outnumber them.  This approach can be read into the Passuk (1:9) וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אֶל־עַמּ֑וֹ הִנֵּ֗ה עַ֚ם בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל רַ֥ב וְעָצ֖וּם מִמֶּֽנּוּ in one of two ways - either \"they will soon be greater and stronger than us\" or \"they are multiplying and strengthening faster than us\" (see Mefarshim).</p>\n\n<p>Others (RDZ Hoffman, see also <a href=\"http://www.nechama.org.il/pages/109.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nechama Leibowitz</a>) suggest that Pharaoh simply lied to the nation in order to convince them. Daat Mikra (Shemos 1:9, fn16) notes a number of parallels including Bereishis 26:26, Bamidbar 22:6.</p>\n\n<p>There are, however, some commentaries and Targumin that (possibly) understand Pharaoh's comment to be literal.  The most significant and clearly stated would be Ramban 1:10, who gives a number of reasons why Pharaoh did not attack Benei Yisrael directly, the third of which is that the Jews were as strong as the Egyptians at that point.  According to those Mefarshim, we must see how the Egyptians enslaved them.</p>\n\n<p>Part 2: How did the Egyptians enslave them?</p>\n\n<p>Ramban, based on the above, follows many Mefarshim in explaining that the Egyptians tricked them into working for them as \"taxes\" (see 1:11), which began to slowly weaken them, and the Egyptians were eventually able to kill the Jewish male children as well.  There are a number of adaptations of this understanding within the other commentaries, but almost all of them work within a similar framework.</p>\n\n<p>The famous Chazal on this is found in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%98%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%90_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 11b</a>, where the word \"Befarech\" (1:13) is explained as \"Befeh Rach\", with soft words, that the Egyptians convinced them and paid them to work originally (Rashi there in above link).  This is quoted by Chizkuni 5:4, Daas Zekeinim 1:11 and 5:4, and <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Search?mode=basic&p=1&c=0&s=1&t=%D7%91%D7%A4%D7%94%20%D7%A8%D7%9A&distance=2&inorder=1&en=1&notes=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">many others</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, even according to those Mefarshim who felt that the Jewish nation were strong enough to take on the Egyptians before the enslavement occured, once they were already enslaved, they were certainly too weak and broken to fight back, as evidenced by the rest of the Parsha and the commentaries brought above.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Slavery was normal. Slavery was so normal that Hebrew uses the same word/root for slave as for work. Almost all nations had slaves, Jews had slaves, often times even slaves had slaves. I say this to highlight that slavery was a different institution than what was experienced in the Southern US, because in the ancient world being a slave actually had perks compared to the harsh realities of life that we often don't experience now. So on its surface ancient people didn't always feel a need to rebel against slavery. Being a slave meant you didn't have to strive for your livelihood which meant you didn't have to starve because your food and housing was always provided for, and depending on local rules (like found in the Torah) you could be guaranteed certain rights as a slave.</p>\n<p>But just like employers, some slave owners treated their subordinates fairly, and others didn't. And also like employers, a new manager or owner can come to power who changes the whole dynamic for the worse. I would argue that by the time we open up the book of Exodus the Israelites had already consented to being slaves for a while (like nearly all the other Egyptians) and were satisfied with the arrangement. Until a new Pharoah rose to power who decided to make the slavery bad for the Israelites in particular by putting task masters to treat them harshly during their work.</p>\n<p>I mention that the Israelites were probably already slaves for a few reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We read all about how Joseph enacts laws that basically turn the entire Egyptian population [other than Egyptian priests] into slaves. Most people remember reading these rules, but they forget the opening and closing clauses in the Torah narrative. First we read that in the time of this great famine as the Israelites are moved to Goshen that Joseph is the one who sustains all of them, <em><strong>while he is enacting legislation to turn the entire population into slaves.</strong></em> This becomes important because the narrative ends with telling us that these laws leading to a nation of slavery is going to be the law moving forward.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Genesis 47:12-27</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יב  וַיְכַלְכֵּל יוֹסֵף אֶת-אָבִיו וְאֶת-אֶחָיו, וְאֵת כָּל-בֵּית\nאָבִיו--לֶחֶם, לְפִי הַטָּף.  12 <strong>And Joseph sustained his father, and\nhis brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to\nthe want of their little ones.</strong> יג  וְלֶחֶם אֵין בְּכָל-הָאָרֶץ,\nכִּי-כָבֵד הָרָעָב מְאֹד; וַתֵּלַהּ אֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם, וְאֶרֶץ כְּנַעַן,\nמִפְּנֵי, הָרָעָב.    13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the\nfamine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan\nlanguished by reason of the famine. יד  וַיְלַקֵּט יוֹסֵף,\nאֶת-כָּל-הַכֶּסֶף הַנִּמְצָא בְאֶרֶץ-מִצְרַיִם וּבְאֶרֶץ כְּנַעַן,\nבַּשֶּׁבֶר, אֲשֶׁר-הֵם שֹׁבְרִים; וַיָּבֵא יוֹסֵף אֶת-הַכֶּסֶף,\nבֵּיתָה פַרְעֹה.  14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was\nfound in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn\nwhich they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.\nטו  וַיִּתֹּם הַכֶּסֶף, מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם וּמֵאֶרֶץ כְּנַעַן,\nוַיָּבֹאוּ כָל-מִצְרַיִם אֶל-יוֹסֵף לֵאמֹר הָבָה-לָּנוּ לֶחֶם,\nוְלָמָּה נָמוּת נֶגְדֶּךָ:  כִּי אָפֵס, כָּסֶף.   15 And when the money\nwas all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the\nEgyptians came unto Joseph, and said: 'Give us bread; for why should\nwe die in thy presence? for our money faileth.' טז  וַיֹּאמֶר יוֹסֵף\nהָבוּ מִקְנֵיכֶם, וְאֶתְּנָה לָכֶם בְּמִקְנֵיכֶם--אִם-אָפֵס, כָּסֶף.\n16 And Joseph said: 'Give your cattle, and I will give you [bread]\nfor your cattle, if money fail.' יז  וַיָּבִיאוּ אֶת-מִקְנֵיהֶם,\nאֶל-יוֹסֵף, וַיִּתֵּן לָהֶם יוֹסֵף לֶחֶם בַּסּוּסִים וּבְמִקְנֵה\nהַצֹּאן וּבְמִקְנֵה הַבָּקָר, וּבַחֲמֹרִים; וַיְנַהֲלֵם בַּלֶּחֶם\nבְּכָל-מִקְנֵהֶם, בַּשָּׁנָה הַהִוא.  17 And they brought their cattle\nunto Joseph. And Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses,\nand for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses; and he fed\nthem with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year. יח\nוַתִּתֹּם, הַשָּׁנָה הַהִוא, וַיָּבֹאוּ אֵלָיו בַּשָּׁנָה הַשֵּׁנִית\nוַיֹּאמְרוּ לוֹ לֹא-נְכַחֵד מֵאֲדֹנִי, כִּי אִם-תַּם הַכֶּסֶף\nוּמִקְנֵה הַבְּהֵמָה אֶל-אֲדֹנִי:  לֹא נִשְׁאַר לִפְנֵי אֲדֹנִי,\nבִּלְתִּי אִם-גְּוִיָּתֵנוּ וְאַדְמָתֵנוּ.    18 And when that year was\nended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him: 'We will\nnot hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds\nof cattle are my lord's; there is nought left in the sight of my lord,\nbut our bodies, and our lands. יט  לָמָּה נָמוּת לְעֵינֶיךָ,\nגַּם-אֲנַחְנוּ גַּם אַדְמָתֵנוּ--קְנֵה-אֹתָנוּ וְאֶת-אַדְמָתֵנוּ,\nבַּלָּחֶם; וְנִהְיֶה אֲנַחְנוּ וְאַדְמָתֵנוּ, עֲבָדִים לְפַרְעֹה,\nוְתֶן-זֶרַע וְנִחְיֶה וְלֹא נָמוּת, וְהָאֲדָמָה לֹא תֵשָׁם.   19\nWherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy\nus and our land for bread, and we and our land will be bondmen unto\nPharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the\nland be not desolate.' כ  וַיִּקֶן יוֹסֵף אֶת-כָּל-אַדְמַת מִצְרַיִם,\nלְפַרְעֹה, כִּי-מָכְרוּ מִצְרַיִם אִישׁ שָׂדֵהוּ, כִּי-חָזַק עֲלֵהֶם\nהָרָעָב; וַתְּהִי הָאָרֶץ, לְפַרְעֹה.     20 So Joseph bought all the\nland of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field,\nbecause the famine was sore upon them; and the land became Pharaoh's.\nכא  וְאֶת-הָעָם--הֶעֱבִיר אֹתוֹ, לֶעָרִים:  מִקְצֵה גְבוּל-מִצְרַיִם,\nוְעַד-קָצֵהוּ.    21 And as for the people, he removed them city by\ncity, from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end\nthereof. כב  רַק אַדְמַת הַכֹּהֲנִים, לֹא קָנָה:  כִּי חֹק לַכֹּהֲנִים\nמֵאֵת פַּרְעֹה, וְאָכְלוּ אֶת-חֻקָּם אֲשֶׁר נָתַן לָהֶם\nפַּרְעֹה--עַל-כֵּן, לֹא מָכְרוּ אֶת-אַדְמָתָם.    22 Only the land of\nthe priests bought he not, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh,\nand did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold\nnot their land. כג  וַיֹּאמֶר יוֹסֵף אֶל-הָעָם, הֵן קָנִיתִי אֶתְכֶם\nהַיּוֹם וְאֶת-אַדְמַתְכֶם לְפַרְעֹה; הֵא-לָכֶם זֶרַע, וּזְרַעְתֶּם\nאֶת-הָאֲדָמָה.    23 Then Joseph said unto the people: 'Behold, I have\nbought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. Lo, here is seed for\nyou, and ye shall sow the land. כד  וְהָיָה, בַּתְּבוּאֹת, וּנְתַתֶּם\nחֲמִישִׁית, לְפַרְעֹה; וְאַרְבַּע הַיָּדֹת יִהְיֶה לָכֶם לְזֶרַע\nהַשָּׂדֶה וּלְאָכְלְכֶם, וְלַאֲשֶׁר בְּבָתֵּיכֶם--וְלֶאֱכֹל\nלְטַפְּכֶם.   24 And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye\nshall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for\nseed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,\nand for food for your little ones.' כה  וַיֹּאמְרוּ, הֶחֱיִתָנוּ;\nנִמְצָא-חֵן בְּעֵינֵי אֲדֹנִי, וְהָיִינוּ עֲבָדִים לְפַרְעֹה.     25 <strong>And\nthey said: 'Thou hast saved our lives. Let us find favour in the sight\nof my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves'</strong> כו  וַיָּשֶׂם אֹתָהּ\nיוֹסֵף לְחֹק עַד-הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה עַל-אַדְמַת מִצְרַיִם,\nלְפַרְעֹה--לַחֹמֶשׁ:  רַק אַדְמַת הַכֹּהֲנִים, לְבַדָּם--לֹא הָיְתָה,\nלְפַרְעֹה.    26 <strong>And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of\nEgypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land\nof the priests alone became not Pharaoh's.</strong>   כז  וַיֵּשֶׁב יִשְׂרָאֵל\nבְּאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם, בְּאֶרֶץ גֹּשֶׁן; וַיֵּאָחֲזוּ בָהּ, וַיִּפְרוּ\nוַיִּרְבּוּ מְאֹד.    27 <em>And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the\nland of Goshen; and they got them possessions therein, and were\nfruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To sum up this giant block of text. Joseph is the one financially sustaining his family who moved to Egypt and he did his best to set them up well. Joseph also enacted a really harsh policy over the entire country of Egypt in which the entire population will become some sort of slave to Pharaoh eventually. And the giant block of text ends saying that this policy will be the law moving forward, even after the famine is over, and the Israelites remained living in Egypt under this policy. The Torah is setting you up to ask the following question: \"What will happen to the Israelites in Egypt once Joseph dies and cannot financially sustain them anymore?\" My answer is: They will and did become slaves to Pharaoh like the rest of the population, and saw themselves as better off than most because they were able to remain in the land of Goshen while the rest of the Egyptian population would be shifted and moved around according to the needs of the government.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>We find some odd statements in later narratives in which the Israelites look back on their time as slaves and mention things that don't sound like the terrible policies we read at the beginning of Exodus. For example, we don't see anywhere in sefer Shemot in which an Israelite buys food. But we do read about how the Egyptians \"gave them\" bread, leeks, melons, and fish for \"free.\" Which should beg the question, <em><strong>why?</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Exodus 16:3</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ג  וַיֹּאמְרוּ אֲלֵהֶם בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, מִי-יִתֵּן מוּתֵנוּ\nבְיַד-יְהוָה בְּאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם, בְּשִׁבְתֵּנוּ עַל-סִיר הַבָּשָׂר,\nבְּאָכְלֵנוּ לֶחֶם לָשֹׂבַע:  כִּי-הוֹצֵאתֶם אֹתָנוּ אֶל-הַמִּדְבָּר\nהַזֶּה, לְהָמִית אֶת-כָּל-הַקָּהָל הַזֶּה בָּרָעָב.  {ס}  3</p>\n<p>and the\nchildren of Israel said unto them: 'Would that we had died by the hand\nof the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when\nwe did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this\nwilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.' {S}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Numbers 11:4-5</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ד  וְהָאסַפְסֻף אֲשֶׁר בְּקִרְבּוֹ, הִתְאַוּוּ תַּאֲוָה; וַיָּשֻׁבוּ\nוַיִּבְכּוּ, גַּם בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, וַיֹּאמְרוּ, מִי יַאֲכִלֵנוּ\nבָּשָׂר.</p>\n<p>4 And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting; and the\nchildren of Israel also wept on their part, and said: 'Would that we\nwere given flesh to eat!</p>\n<p>ה  זָכַרְנוּ, אֶת-הַדָּגָה, אֲשֶׁר-נֹאכַל בְּמִצְרַיִם, חִנָּם; אֵת\nהַקִּשֻּׁאִים, וְאֵת הָאֲבַטִּחִים, וְאֶת-הֶחָצִיר וְאֶת-הַבְּצָלִים,\nוְאֶת-הַשּׁוּמִים.</p>\n<p>5 We remember the fish, which we were wont to eat in Egypt for nought;\nthe cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the\ngarlic;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Egyptians apparently gave Israelites their fill of free expensive food during a time in history where a day laborer typically only earned enough for one serving of bread? Keep in mind even people who might be considered wealthy like Jacob can find them and their family starving because of a local famine and riches can turn to rags in just a few years. And so I find it unlikely that the Egyptians were so generous that they fed these neighboring Israelites good food day in and day out without charge for <em>hundreds of years</em>. Rather the more likely explanation is that these Egyptians were feeding their Israelite slaves well to try and keep them content and it was working just fine until a new Pharaoh rose to power.</p>\n<p>Based on this I would argue the Israelites initially accepted slavery in order to not die from the famine that was impacting all of Canaan and Egypt. This slavery was tolerable for them as it was a better slavery compared to the slavery other Egyptian was facing, so what is there to fight or rebel against?</p>\n<p>But then at some point the new Pharaoh rose to power and started inflicting them and so now we find the Israelites not just in slavery, but in immoral and torturous slavery. And it seems like at this point the tides had turned against the Israelites so much that they didn't have a way to fight back or protect themselves anymore after being slaves for such a long time. And so when we open the book of exodus we find a people not recently enslaved, but generationally enslaved and who have lost the ability to fight back in a meaningful way. Which is why God suddenly re-enters the picture to help them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I think you're looking in a wrong pond by trying to find \"natural causes\" to it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Jews were enslaved because they knew they should be enslaved.</strong><br>\nThey had the prophecy and the tradition, and they knew the benefits of their enslavement.</p>\n\n<p>When Abraham asked G-d how will he inherit the land, G-d prophesized him with the Egypt exile. The Ariz\"l's tradition says G-d wanted them to totally lose their materialism and to become \"disconnected\" from the physical. Then they will be ready to receive the Torah and be entitled to inherit the Promised Land. Think about going to the dentist. Your kid might ask why you've been hurt. But you'll explain that was made on purpose. </p>\n\n<p>The Jews knew sooner or later that will come. Although some claim that they could replace enslavement with learning Torah, but this does not seem possible after the prophecy.</p>\n\n<p>That desire (to fulfill the prophecy) was so strong, they didn't want to end it prematurely when Moses came only 86 years after it started, instead of the promised 400 (there are different ways of counting it). Moses explained how the rest of slavery can be exchanged for Matan Torah and more.</p>\n\n\n",

It is hard for me to undersand how these views are legitimate concerning what I've ever studied in Torah so far.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Kabbalistic literature in general, and chassidism in particular, contains teachings about tzaddikim that may be somewhat innovative from the perspective of traditional Judaism. However, the importance of the greatest rabbis of each generation is clear in Tanakh and Talmud, and there are some ancient sources supporting the exalted position of the tzaddik in chassidic philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>For example, from the Jerusalem Talmud (Eruvin 5:1): \"All the standing that the prophet Elijah did before his teacher Achiya Hashiloni, were as if standing before the Shekhinah.\"</p>\n\n<p>In Pirkei Avos, we see this extraordinary statement, which could be interpreted to refer to the stature and power of a great tzaddik:</p>\n\n<p>\"Rabbi Meir would say: Whoever studies Torah for Torah's sake alone, merits many things; not only that, but [the creation of] the entire world is worthwhile for him alone. He is called friend, beloved, lover of G-d, lover of humanity, rejoicer of G-d, rejoicer of humanity. The Torah enclothes him with humility and awe; makes him fit to be righteous, pious, correct and faithful; distances him from sin and brings him close to merit. From him, people enjoy counsel and wisdom, understanding and power, as is stated (Proverbs 8:14): 'Mine are counsel and wisdom, I am understanding, mine is power.' The Torah grants him sovereignty, dominion, and jurisprudence. The Torah's secrets are revealed to him, and he becomes as an ever-increasing wellspring and as an unceasing river. He becomes modest, patient and forgiving of insults. The Torah uplifts him and makes him greater than all creations\" (Pirkei Avos 6:1).</p>\n\n<p>If a tzaddik can give people \"power,\" can exercise \"sovereignty\" and \"dominion,\" and is even \"greater than all creation,\" it is conceivable that the spiritual attainments of ordinary people are dependent on connecting themselves to such tzaddikim. Thus, this may be one possible source of the elements of chassidic theology that you identify.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Mishlei 10:25 says וְצַדִּיק יְסוֹד עוֹלָם, which can be translated as the \"Tzaddik is an everlasting foundation,\" or as the \"Tzaddik is the foundation of the world.\"</p>\n\n<p>For a Chabad perspective on the importance of tzaddikim in our avodas Hashem, see this essay: <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/137090/jewish/Tzaddik-The-Baal-Teshuvah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/137090/jewish/Tzaddik-The-Baal-Teshuvah.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>The essay provides these two sources, in addition to others:</p>\n\n<p>\"The Rambam, based on the words of the Talmud, asks, 'How is it possible that one should cleave to G-d? G-d is fire and we are physical. One who touches fire will burn.' The Sages answer,'‘To cleave unto Him’ means that we should cleave to wise men and to their disciples,' i.e., tzad­dikim. We cleave through connection with a tzaddik, who is one with G-d. Furthermore, believing in tzaddikim is based on a verse in Exodus said every day in our morning prayers:'[The Jews] believed in G-d and Moses His servant.' The Mechilta12 queries,'Why is it important to tell us that the Jewish people believed in Moses His servant? How can we equate our faith in Moses with our belief in G-d?' The answer is, without faith in Moses, or the Moses of every generation, there cannot be belief in G-d.\" </p>\n\n<p>Non-chassidic sources also speak of the great importance of tzaddikim. R' Chaim of Volozhin, for example, writes that a tzaddik is \"the beis hamikdah himself.\" (Nefesh haChaim 1:4).</p>\n\n<p>In further researching this topic, keep in mind that in the Gemara, the term \"chassid\" is often used when we would use the term \"tzaddik\" today.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, note that even if you find some aspects of chassidic thought (or Breslov chassidus) to be difficult to accept, you can still benefit from some of its teachings and practical advice, without adopting all the beliefs and practices it contains. A number of non-chassidic rabbis have learned chassidus and been influenced by it in some way or other, while continuing to adhere to the customs and hashkafic norms of non-chassidic Ashkenazim. </p>\n\n<p>For example, see the quotes on this page, which show that several well-known non-chassidic rabbis, such as the Steipler Gaon, R' Eliyahu Dessler, R' Elya Lopian, praised and/or cited the teachings of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov: <a href=\"http://www.breslev-midot.com/eng/hillulat_moharahn_2005.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.breslev-midot.com/eng/hillulat_moharahn_2005.asp</a>.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think this actually might be brought by Rebbe Nachman somewhere, but we see in the Gemara that the leaders sought out Honi, the Circle Drawer to pray to Hashem to bring rain <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l2803.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Ta'anit 23a)</a>, so this is a related concept of having the Tzadik pray for you.

(Is there a mitzvah to use philosophy to inquire into the nature of God and the world vis-a-vis what the Torah has to say on these topics?)</p>\n\n<p>2- Did any Rishon feel that philosophical inquiry could produce something that the Torah does not?</p>\n\n<p>3- Did any Rishon <strong>fundamentally</strong> base their knowledge of God or Torah idea's on the conclusions drawn from their philosophical inquiries? </p>\n\n<p>4- Did any Rishon indicate or explicitly state that their philosophical inquiries took precedence over a straightforward understanding of the Torah (such that the Torah would have to fit whatever the conclusions of their inquiries were)?</p>\n\n<p>(I understand that some of these questions are interrelated, but I split them up anyway because I feel it makes the question/s easier to think about.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<h3>1. Does it fulfill a mitzvah?</h3>\n\n<p>Not only can it fulfill one mitzvah, but three:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Malbim (Shemos 20:2), Maharam Schik (Mitzvah 26) and Seforno (beginning of Ohr Amim) all explain that the commandment of אנכי ה' אלוקיך, believing in God, is a command to philosophically justify those beliefs</p></li>\n<li><p>The Chovos Halevavos (introduction) explains that there is a separate command to \"know God\", as evidenced by the verses ידעת היום והשבות אל לבבך כי ה' הוא האלקים (Devarim 4:39). He also connects this to the second mitzvah (as counted by the Rambam) of belief in God's Oneness</p></li>\n<li><p>The Ramban in Shaar HaGemul doesn't discuss the nature/existence of God, but he does discuss questions of how God runs the world. He writes \"חובת כל הנברא עובד מאהבה ומיראה, לתור בדעתו לצדק המשפט ולאמת הדין כפי מה שידו משגת\", there's an obligation upon those who serve God to justify His actions. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Even without fulfillment of a specific mitzvah, there's still value in asking questions or 'philosophizing' about the truths of Judaism, because it fosters a deeper connection with Judaism (see Divrei Negidim Hagadah by the 4 sons, and R. Hirsch's Nineteen Letters, no. 18)</p>\n\n<h3>2. Can Philosophy Teach Something that is not in the Torah?</h3>\n\n<p>The whole point of utilizing philosophy is that, in some areas, the Torah might not be <em>sufficient</em>. This does not necessarily mean that these truths aren't contained in the Torah, but that only after understanding certain principles (which are better taught from external sources) can one understand the Torah properly. Thus, the Rambam writes in several places (see M.N. 1:71 and 2:12, and Hilchos Kiddush Hachodesh 17:24) that wisdom which he learned from philosophers and scientists originally belinged to the Jews, but was lost due to the exile. </p>\n\n<h3>3. Does any \"Rishon\" base their beliefs fundamentally/entirely upon philosophy?</h3>\n\n<p>If by \"rishon\", you mean traditional Torah scholars who have always been totally part of the Jewish religious community, than the answer is no. There was, for a period of time (during the Rishonim) a school of Jewish rationalists who pretty much believed entirely in philosophy and only tried to fit the Torah in to their philosophical worldview, but these were rejected by the mainstream community. An example of such a person is (Rabbi) <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9806-levi-ben-abraham-ben-hayyim\">Levi ben Avraham</a>, who was excommunicated by the Rashba for his extreme views, and others of his ilk. (With perhaps <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ben_Hofni\">one very early exception</a>) </p>\n\n<p>The real question is one of <em>extent</em>. Some rishonim thought that we should accept much of what would be taught by philosophy, even if it may be a bit of a stretch in terms of how it fits with maamarei chazal, others thought that we should ignore philosophy completely, and of course there are many in between. Despite this, while the Rambam may have used philosophy to an extent that other rishonim were uncomfortable with, he still writes that one must subjugate their knowledge to the Torah, and not the other way around (end of Hilchos Me'ilah) </p>\n\n<h3>4. Did any Rishon prioritize philosophical understandings over simple reading of the Torah?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, but not because they thought philosophy to be above the Torah, ח\"ו, but because they felt that if something was proven philosophically, then it must be that the Torah means something other than its literal meaning. There are many specific examples of this, but as a methodology, is specifically mentioned by the Rambam (M.N. 2:25) and R' Saadia Gaon (Emunos V'Deos 7:1)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To answer 1 - Some (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40081&st=&pgnum=302\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Malbim</a>, for one) explain that the Rambam understood the <em>mitzvah</em> of אנכי ה' אלקך to be a <em>mitzvah</em> to <em>know</em> Hashem, which is different than to <em>believe</em> in Hashem. The Malbim explains that the <em>mitzvah</em> according to the Rambam is to turn the belief into an intellectual awareness.  So having an intellectual awareness of Hashem and the nature of His existence (see the Malbim earlier in the same paragraph there) would be a <em>mitzvah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to 3 - The Rambam was chastised by many later Jewish thinkers for basing his belief that all physicality will end and the World to Come is purely spiritual on Aristotelian philosophy. The Rambam had a fundamental dispute with, for example, the Ramban, based on conclusions developing from his philosophical approach.</p>\n\n<p>To answer 4 - the Rambam in Moreh Nevochim 2:25 says that his philosophical definitive proof that G-d does not have a body led to the necessity to re-explain the verses about G-d's corporeality.  (He has another reason there, but that doesn't detract from this one.)</p>\n\n<p>(Yes, I know I skipped #2)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To add a bit to the answers, the Shaar Yichud of chovos halevavos starts off by explaining the importance of this kind of inquiry.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After investigating after what is the most necessary of the\n  cornerstones and fundamentals of our religion, we found that the\n  wholehearted acceptance of the unity of G-d is the root and foundation\n  of Judaism. It is the first of the gates of the torah, and it\n  differentiates between the believer and the heretic. It is the head\n  and front of religious truth, and one who strays from it - will not be\n  able to perform religious deeds and his faith will not endure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Manoach Halevavos commentary explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>he will not be able to perform the service of G-d, since if one does\n  not believe in Him, that He created the world, and that He is alone in\n  His world, and <strong>that it is fitting to serve Him</strong>, if so, one has no\n  master that he should serve, and there's no greater non-believer than\n  this</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Philosophical inquiry among other things teaches about God and His infinite greatness. The understanding of which is essential for inspiring oneself to dedicate his life to God's service, as the author continues in ch.2</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The philosopher spoke truth when he said: \"no one can serve the Cause\n  of causes and Beginning of beginnings except the prophet of the\n  generation with his senses or the primary philosopher with the wisdom\n  he acquired, but others serve other than Him, since they cannot\n  conceive what exists (without beginning - TL), but rather can only\n  conceive that which is composite (i.e. created things - Tov Levanon\n  commentary)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, we see according to this just how important this kind of study is for one who is capable of delving into it. And that it is a kind of pre-requisite to the wholehearted service of God.</p>\n\n<p>However, as above, the study is very difficult and highly error prone (ex. treating the Eternal with the same logic as the non-eternal). Hence many Rabbis maintain that one should avoid this kind of study (at least without proper guidance).</p>\n\n\n",

It is up to the individual to make his own interpretation, but, at the same time not be foolish about it.</p>\n\n<p>Examples:</p>\n\n<p>A Midrash says that Ya'akov spent years in yeshiva before he went to Padan Aram to Lavan. Questions that I ask when I see this. The \"Yeshiva shel Shem V'Ever\" mystifies me. What did they learn? There was no Gemara; the Torah, perhaps, wasn't \"completed\" as the stories didn't yet occur, and there wasn't yet a nation to receive it. Many other questions can be asked about this \"yeshiva\" based on what we think of a yeshiva. And, if Ya'akov was literally, in some yeshiva learning something, we have no proof of this, elsewhere, anywhere in Tana\"ch. </p>\n\n<p>To take things, literally based on the Torah's story, we assume that Ya'kov was an obedient son. Rivka and Yitzhak send him to Padan Aram to find a wife, and the Torah says, he went there. Did Ya'akov's parents expect him to delay his travel to study? Wasn't he already a \"Yoshev Ohalim\", which based on another Midrash says that means that he studied Torah? What more did he need to learn?

Then, there are the mitzvot that they could have done but didn't. Most notable, perhaps - Ya'akov married 2 sisters.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: A literal translation of this Midrash seems impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Your example about G-d wearing tefillin, has to be allegorical as it contradicts Rambam's principle of faith that G-d has no body.</p>\n\n\n",

This is essentially the same case as ours here in Bereishit; the reference to Ya'akov's household implies that his (surviving) wives, daughter-in laws, daughter(s-- see <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.35?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">37:35</a> ad loc.), and granddaughters.</p>\n\n<p>In the same light, Bait Yosef, Yosef's household, refers to its members who have gone unmentioned: Not the women, included under Bait Ya'akov, but rather his servants and maidservants.</p>\n\n<p>As for the question regarding the young children and livestock, with all probability, when Pharaoh granted permission to Yosef to leave, it was implied that he would care for those who didn't travel during Yosef's absence. After all, why would Yosef need to <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.50.4-5?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">orchestrate a request</a> for a few days off so carefully?</p>\n\n<p>And, if one was to say that a vizier would always need to ask the ruler for permission, he still would not have to manipulate the atmosphere of his request so specifically! This holds especially true for Yosef.\nAfter saving the Egyptian people from a catastrophic famine, after convincing Pharaoh that G-d was with him, after 26 years of faithful work, Yosef could have left without even telling Pharaoh-- and Pharaoh, if he was sensible, would've barely reprimanded him! The fact that Yosef took such precautions so as to stage the whole petition shows that something else is going on.</p>\n\n<p>The request for protection/support of the children is something of qualifying importance, because the Egyptians were <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0146.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">disgusted by shepherds (v. 34)</a> such as the Shevatim, and so by defending the family's livestock and young ones, Pharaoh was effectively siding with Yosef-- at least culturally-- over his people. Thus, this was a huge request.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Pasuk explicates Yosef's brothers, despite being part of Yosef's \"father's house\" due to their importance. Especially important people are often written separately in a list. Yosef is written because it's Yosef's \"father's house\", not Yaakov's.</p>\n\n<p>The Pasuk does not say \"all of his father's house\", only \"all of Yosef's house\". The other brothers left their children and flocks in Egypt as the Pasuk goes on to say. </p>\n\n<p>Who was watching the children? There could be several answers. Family servants, friends or neighbors is a possibility. Older children is another. It's also quite likely that women did not go up, in which case the mothers would watch their kids.</p>\n\n\n",

As to why Tanach uses the emphatic imperative rather than the normal one, there is an <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/27913398\" rel=\"nofollow\">excellent article</a> by Fassberg which discusses this.  It appears that the emphatic imperative שִׁלְחָה is used when the action of the verb is directed towards the speaker.  On the other hand, when the action of verb is not directed at the speaker, the regular imperative שְׁלַח tends to be used.  The example you gave of II Kings 4:22 perfectly demonstrates this:</p>\n\n<p>וַתִּקְרָא אֶל אִישָׁהּ וַתֹּאמֶר שִׁלְחָה נָא לִי ...</p>\n\n<p>Here the action of the verb is coming back to the speaker.  We can also see that the widow chose to include the word נָא which indicates further emphasis on doing the action.</p>\n\n<p>There are other examples in the Semitic languages where adding a letter to the end of a word denotes emphasis.  If you can recall the Aramaic sections of Tanach, you might remember that nouns have an emphatic form in addition to their normal form.  So מֶּלֶךְ means \"a king\" but מַלְכָּא means \"the king.\"  The aleph as the end of the word is a marker for emphasis.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are there any studies that compare Biblical Hebrew to modern Hebrew?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>(I am a Hebrew speaker) When reading the Bible, one encounters sometimes words whose meaning in modern Hebrew clearly does not correspond to what was meant in the text (in Kohelet for example, \"מסכן\" seems to mean poor, and not miserable; for another, perhaps more substantial example, I don't think that \"רשע\" in the Bible corresponds exactly to its meaning in modern Hebrew). This suggests that before modern Hebrew came into existence, the Bible text sometimes had a different meaning for the Jewish scholars (with Yiddish, or Spanish, or Portuguese, or ... being their mother tongue) than the meaning which it has for native Hebrew speakers nowadays (or \"sounded\" differently, so to speak).</p>\n\n<p>Could you recommend any studies which try to compare ancient and modern Hebrew? How this divergence in Hebrew is being approached to in religious studies where students have prior knowledge of modern Hebrew? (speaking about myself, I do feel sometimes misled by my knowledge of modern Hebrew when reading the Bible)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I don't know if it counts as a <em>study</em>, but how about a relevant <em>textbook</em>?</p>\n\n<p>The book <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0300084404\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biblical Hebrew for Students of Modern Israeli Hebrew</a> looks like it will help you.  It's used in the rabbinic program at Hebrew Union College and probably other places (though I only have first-hand knowledge of HUC).  Several non-yeshiva programs I'm aware of start by teaching (or otherwise ensuring that students know) Modern Hebrew and then teach older forms based on that.  I don't know what yeshivot do.</p>\n\n<p>There are, as you observed, key differences between modern and biblical Hebrew (and the idea of <em>one</em> \"biblical Hebrew\" also doesn't stand up to scrutiny).  These differences are in both form/grammar and vocabulary.</p>\n\n<p>From the author's preface:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yet BH and MIH are two different languages -- or at the very least, two substantially different dialects of the same language. MIH is certainly useful for reading the Bible, but no one can understand the Hebrew Bible knowing only MIH. There are significant differences in vocabulary, spelling, verb formation, use of verbal suffixes, and word order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some constructs in BH are unknown in MIH, such as the vav conversive (reversing vav), a particular formation that converts a perfect verb to imperfect or vice-versa. (BH doesn't really have \"past\" and \"future\" tenses so much as perfect and imperfect aspects -- another key difference.) Without knowing about this often-used construct one would make significant errors, some but not all of which might raise contextual alarms (\"that doesn't make sense\").</p>\n\n<p>Some constructs are different. MIH tends strongly to subject-verb-object order and (to my understanding) doesn't use the direct-object marker <em>et</em>. BH, on the other hand, is less consistent; it tends to put the verb first with the subject and object following, but sometimes starts with the object. Since the verb construct tells you the number and gender of the subject, subjects are sometimes dropped as redundant, which can lead to ambiguity.</p>\n\n<p>BH and MIH handle participles differently, and also some verb prefixes and suffixes. The book has extensive discussions of this. Some vocabulary is also different. While MIH vocabulary is derived from BH vocabulary, knowing only MIH doesn't always get you back to the core.</p>\n\n<p>BH itself isn't completely uniform either. From the introduction:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The second problem alluded to in the term biblical Hebrew was that it implies that we have a single, unified language. On the contrary, we actually have several dialects that are merged in the Hebrew Bible. These dialects may be distinguished mainly in terms of chronology, geography, and genre.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He goes on to point out that the language changed over the span of a thousand years, particularly through exile when Aramaic had a stronger influence; that there were differences between the northern and southern kingdoms after the split; and that poetry is rather different from prose.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the book he offers some translation tips, which I quote from to illustrate the types of problems that can arise. (I'm going to sometimes transliterate for ease of composing this answer.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do not assume that a word has the same meaning in BH and MIH. Example: Song of Songs 4:1 שַׂעְרֵךְ כְּעֵדֶר הָעִזִּים, שֶׁגָּלְשׁוּ מֵהַר גִּלְעָד. The word galash in MIH means \"ski\", but here it means \"descend\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(You can see how, given a root for \"descend\" and a need for the concept of downill skiing, the creators of MH might have applied the former to the latter. This isn't a unique example by any means.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Vowels matter. In particular, be sure to distinguish between verbs and nouns. Example: Psalm 13:6 אָשִׁירָה לַיהוָה, כִּי גָמַל עָלָי. Gamal with a qametz is the noun \"camel\", but gamal with a patach as here means \"deal fairly\" or \"reward\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand from this book that vowel-driven nuances are way more common in BH than they are in MIH.</p>\n\n<p>He also points out issues with different classes of defective verbs, and with verbs that look the same in different binyanim (so you need to apply context).</p>\n\n<p>For much more discussion, see the book.</p>\n\n<p>The book lists the following source that sounds promising; I haven't seen it but I trust Davïd's <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/51421/are-there-any-studies-that-compare-biblical-hebrew-to-modern-hebrew/52441#comment139073_52441\">recommendation</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Saenz-Badillos, Angel, <em>A History of the Hebrew Language</em>, Cambridge University Press, 1993 (<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EZCgpaTgLm0C&printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">preview on Google Books</a>, h/t Davïd)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Further recommendations from Davïd:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>massive article on <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08629.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew Language</a> from <em>Encyclopedia Judaica</em></p></li>\n<li><p>Hoffman, Joel M., <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=momIk7nVNdkC&printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">In the Beginning: A Short History of the Hebrew Language</a>, New York University Press, 2004</p></li>\n<li><p>(going the other direction:) Muraoka, Takamitsu, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZhcjKx1QRe8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Modern Hebrew for Biblical Scholars</a>, Harrassowitz, Verlag</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>There are many words in Modern Hebrew which differ vastly to its meaning in Biblical Hebrew.

Sinai be proof that G-d sent Moshe as a messenger?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0203.htm#12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shmot 3:12</a> G-d says that the proof that G-d sent Moses as a messenger to B'nai Yisra'el is that when he takes them out of Egypt, they will worship G-d at the very mountain that G-d is speaking to Moses, now (Mt. Horeb / Sinai).</p>\n\n<p>How is this a proof?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rashi explains that moshe asked what the merit of the Jews are that they will be saved from Egypt. </p>\n\n<p>Hashem answered that their merit is that they will receive the torah. </p>\n\n<p>So this was not intended as a proof. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R' Hirsch understands the אות to be referring back to the previous point - Moshe said (vs. 11) \"Who am I that I should ... bring the Children of Israel out from Egypt?\"  Hashem answered, This that you have asked \"Who am I...\" is exactly the qualification to be the best messenger.  You sense that you lack any qualification for this mission, and that itself will be the sign that I have sent you - it will be clear that the accomplishment was only through Me.  Without this, Israel's departure from Egypt would be no different than any other dynamic leader arising to save his people.</p>\n<p>The <em>result</em> will be the ability to fully serve Hashem on this mountain.</p>\n<p>So the verse should be read and punctuated as follows:</p>\n<p>\"And He said: [You will be able to take them out] because I will be with you!  And the sign that it is because I will be with you is this [your humility].  If <em>you</em> take them out, then you will serve Hashem on this mountain.\"</p>\n<p>The Ohr HaChaim has yet another way to read the verse.  Moshe said that he was unfit to stand before Pharaoh and to take the Jews out.  Hashem told him that he was fit to stand before Pharaoh, because \"I will be with you,\" and therefore your greatness is greater than his.  And the sign that you are fit to take the Jews out is that I am sending you. I wouldn't be sending you if you weren't capable.</p>\n<p>The verse should then be read \"I will be with you.  And the sign [that you are fit to fulfill this mission] is that I am sending you!\"</p>\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1108.htm#2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Yesodei Hatorah 8:2</a> (8:4 in Mechon Mamre's count)) understands that the אות is that which the entire nation witnessed Hashem speaking directly to Moshe at Har Sinai:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כך משה רבינו כל ישראל עדים לו אחר מעמד הר סיני ואינו צריך לעשות להם אות. וזהו שאמר לו הקב\"ה בתחילת נבואתו בעת שנתן לו האותות לעשותן במצרים ואמר לו ושמעו לקולך. ידע משה רבינו שהמאמין על פי האותות יש בלבבו דופי ומהרהר ומחשב והיה נשמט מלילך ואמר והן לא יאמינו לי. עד שהודיעו הקב\"ה שאלו האותות אינן אלא עד שיצאו ממצרים ואחר שיצאו ויעמדו על ההר הזה יסתלק הרהור שמהרהרין אחריך שאני נותן לך כאן אות שידעו שאני שלחתיך באמת מתחילה ולא ישאר בלבם הרהור. <strong>והוא שהכתוב אומר וזה לך האות כי אנכי שלחתיך בהוציאך את העם ממצרים תעבדון את האלהים על ההר הזה.</strong></p>\n<p>(partial translation) All of B'nei Yisroel were witnesses to Moshe's appointment as messenger... Moshe knew that those who believe based on wonders have incomplete faith and remnants of doubt. Therefore Moshe recused himself by saying they wouldn't believe him ... Hashem told him that after they left and stood on this mountain, all their doubts would be removed... <strong>and this is [the meaning of] that which is written \"and this is the sign that I have sent you - when you take the nation out of Egypt, they will serve Me on this mountain.</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The proof means <em>The</em> proof (with a capital t) - the ultimate proof that Moshe was sent by Hashem will be the first-hand witnessing of Hashem speaking to Moshe, which will happen at this mountain.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Elazar ben durdayah and the Metaphors\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in Avodah Zarah (17a) says:</p>\n\n<p>“When Elazar ben durdayah was at the moment of the onset of cohabitation, [the harlot] blew with her mouth and said to Elazar, “Just as this current of air cannot return to its place of origin, so to, they will not receive Elazar ben durdayah in repentance. All of a sudden he had an epiphany and decided that he must try to save his soul, by appealing for mercy. He went and sat between two ranges of mountains and foothills, and he said to them, “Mountains and foothills, beseech mercy for me from Above!” (i.e. “Please help me! Save my soul!) They said to him, “Before we beseech mercy for you, we shall beseech it for ourselves, for it is stated, “For the mountains shall depart and the hills falter.”  Elazar ben durdayah then proceeded to ask the heavens and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, but they all gave him the same response in return,  “Before we beseech mercy for you, we shall beseech it for ourselves.” Having failed to find anyone to assist him, Elazar ben durdayah came to the inescapable conclusion, “The matter depends solely on me!” (I.e. it’s up to me and nobody else!)</p>\n\n<p>Based on this <em>Gemara</em> (mentioned above) I heard someone say in the name of Rav Aron Lewin the following explanation:</p>\n\n<p>\"The <em>mountains</em> and <em>foothills</em> are vicissitudes of life. The obstacles appear like mountains. <em>Heaven</em> and <em>earth</em> is the tension that exists between the <em>physical</em> and the <em>spiritual</em>. The tension that sometimes overwhelms us. The <em>sun</em> and the <em>moon</em> are a metaphor for a person’s parents. How they treated me. How they were too hard on me. How they favored my siblings, perhaps. The <em>stars</em> and <em>constellations</em> is the rotten mazal that I had. There’s always an excuse, “It was my - environment, upbringing, parents, wife, bad rabbeim, but in the end, he came to the realization that it’s up to me.\"</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know the source for this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>You mention that you heard this in the name of <a href=\"http://aaronlevine.info/reisha-rav-harav-aharon-levine-hyd/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Aharon Lewin</a>.

The next part of the phrase says את כל האדם which means \"all of <strong>the</strong> person\".</p>\n\n<p>I heard this great explanation from my Rav when he was teaching his summer Shabbat <em>Pirkei Avot</em> lesson. It says <strong>The</strong> person, and not just the word אדם, meaning \"person\" - that's the word we would expect to see here. By saying <strong>the</strong> person, it means that that one should view all of each person's character as positive, even if he has flaws, which may be starkly noticeable. Even someone's flaws are to be accepted cheerfully. (Related to this, BTW, is the phrasing of the bracha \"Borei Nefashot\" where you praise G-d for creating flaws.)</p>\n\n<p>In order to accept all of <strong>the</strong> person, you have to, of course, greet and meet each individual. As stated, in the above comments, perhaps, in the general context of a large crowd, Gedolim don't appear \"cheerful\" when addressing the crowd.</p>\n\n<p>However, from personal experience, I met the Lubavicher Rebbe a few times. Even though there was a line of people, I know that he smiled and was cheerful to every person he met. And, BTW, you can see him on several youtube videos, where you can see him greeting everyone cheerfully - he doesn't necessarily need to smile with his teeth showing to make you realize that he is \"cheerful\". And, even in cases where people have told the Rebbe about \"flaws\" - they sometimes tell him about things they feel they did wrong, I have seen him (at least on several of the videos) still accept the whole person positively, in support of how I have explained the Mishnah.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Binyamin Kaminetzky, whom I used to see quite often, not only always had a great smile, but had no problem accepting some of my \"unusual\" religious practices and choices, perhaps what he in his own practice would consider a \"flaw\". It was never an issue to him.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion - based on my explanation of the Mishnah, I can't find any justification for <strong>anyone</strong> - not just Gedolim, to not treat <strong>all</strong> of the person cheerfully.</p>\n\n\n",

See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=18&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shabbos 18a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל אין נותנין חטין לתוך הריחים של מים אלא בכדי שיטחנו מבעוד יום מאי\n  טעמא אמר רבה מפני שמשמעת קול </p>\n  \n  <p>But wheat may not be placed in a water-mill unless it can be ground\n  when it is still [Fri]day. What is the reason? Rabbah answered, Because it\n  makes a noise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<em>Soncino translation</em>)</p>\n\n<p>What is this all about?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>Why</em> is making noise forbidden?</li>\n<li>What kinds of noise are forbidden?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/Eng/?CategoryID=198&ArticleID=283#b1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article from Tzomet</a> is mainly focused on the use (non-use) of microphones on Shabbat. Within it, he cites the Talmud Shabbat source and explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to Rashi, mashmi’a kol does not belong to the category of\nmelacha, but is rather forbidden because it constitutes a sort of\n“weekday activity”(uvdin d’chol) and “denigration of Shabbat”\n(ziluta). So too wrote the Meiri: “This act creates noise and is\nwidely known, which constitutes disrespect for Shabbat; but some\npermit even this.” In light of this, any activity which creates loud\nnoise should be prohibited, due to disrespect for Shabbat. And in\nfact, this approach is quoted by the Darkei Moshe in the name of\nMahari Weil: “One is forbidden to set on Erev Shabbat a clock\n[apparently a “grandfather” clock] which will make a loud noise on\nShabbat, due to hashma’at kol.”</p>\n<p>However, the Darkei Moshe also quotes the Agur, who permits setting a\nclock before Shabbat: “This is not similar to the sound of a water\nmill, since one hearing the noise of a water mill on Shabbat will\nthink that the owner placed the grain in the mill on Shabbat itself;\nwhereas regarding clocks, everyone knows that they are set the day\nbefore, and are not set on the day they chime.” According to this\napproach, the entire problem is that others will think that a\nforbidden action was performed on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>The difference between these two approaches (namely, whether\nhashma’at kol is forbidden due to disrespect of Shabbat or the\nimpression that a prohibition was violated) is expressed in a case\nwhere a loud noise is created, but it is clear that no prohibition was\nviolated (such as the case of the grandfather clock).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above is an excerpt. There are various opinions cited in the article.</p>\n<p>Activities that I am aware of (based on my learning about this from local Rabbanim) are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Using a microphone (among other reasons)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Leaving the radio / T.V. on when set on before Shabbat or on an alarm clock (varying opinions on this. See <a href=\"http://www.dinonline.org/2012/05/11/setting-alarm-clock-for-shabbos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Using a regular alarm clock (buzzers, bells, whistles, etc. - also varying opinions)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Running a washing machine or dryer just before Shabbat so that it runs during part of Shabbat</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Leaving a tea kettle on a blech. (Assuming the water wouldn't boil out, of course - safety issue - burning the kettle, which would set off your smoke alarm - possible hashma'at kol :-) :-) )</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein implies that the concern is projecting the appearance of <em>m'lacha</em> being done on <em>shabas</em>. This implication arises from his allowance of an alarm clock's usage on <em>shabas</em> when its sound cannot be heard outside of the sleeper's room (i.e. by other people who might come to the incorrect conclusion that laws had been violated in producing the sound). He adds that if one is using a clock of a type that everyone knows needn't have been set - by means of <em>m'lacha</em> - the night before in order to be making noise now then it should be permissible as well. </p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&st=&pgnum=131\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vol. 6, #70.6</a>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Excerpt from קיצור הלכות שבת - רב יעקב יחזקאל פאזען\nסימן ל''ז</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כ''ד. <strong>השמעת קול</strong>   וכן אסרו להשמיע קול על שיר על ידי שום דבר אלא\n  מותר רק בפה בלבד, והטעם שמא נבוא לתקן כלי שיר. מה נקרא קול של שיר,\n  כשמתכוין להשמיע קול בנעימות קצת כדרך שיר. אין האיסור חל רק אם נעשה\n  דוקא לצורך שיר, אלא כל השמעת קול בדרך זה אסורה, וכגון להשמיע קול נעים\n  בשביל אדם שישן (שקול נעים מרדימו), וזה אסור אפילו אינו נעשה על ידי כלי\n  וכו', וכגון על ידי טפטוף מים וכו'. וכן אסור להכות על דלת בכלי המיוחד\n  לכך וכן כל הדומה לזה, כמו שיתבאר לקמן.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>כ''ה. <strong>דרך שיר</strong>   על כן אסור למחוא כפיים או להכות באצבא על איזה דבר\n  כדרך מנגנים שעושים בזה תנועות עריבות. ומכל מקום בדרך שינוי וכגון למחוא\n  בגב ידו על חברו התירו. כן אסרו כל הדומה לזה כמו לטפוח ברגל כו'. כן\n  אסרו לרקוד בשבת, והכל מטעם גזרה זו. ומכל מקום במקום מצוה, וכגון בשמחת\n  תורה ולשמח חתן וכלה וכו', נוהגים הרבה לעשות ריקודים.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So in short, you have meloche (forbidden activity on Shabbos) to build and destroy, under category is repairing instruments and in order not to come to breaking instruments it's forbidden to play them or to make any sounds.</p>\n\n\n",

They all transcended holiness approaching a Godly level. All 3 people are loftier than time, space and the universe.</p>\n\n<p>The donkey is the only non-kosher animal connected with a <em>mitzvah</em>, namely that it must be redeemed. The Hebrew word, \"Chamor\" comes from <em>chomri</em> meaning \"material\". Kings reign over the material world, symbolized by them riding on an animal. Most kings ride on a horse. But these 3 kings, Avraham, Moshe and Mashiach are spiritual kings and it is more fitting for them to ride on the donkey.</p>\n\n<p>Read the rest of the linked commentary.

From the Essay:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To answer these complaints, G‑d had Moses ride the donkey that Abraham had readily saddled to fulfill G‑d's command, indicating to him that he, too, should fulfill G‑d's command without hesitation. The fact that this donkey was also the one that the Mashiach will ride indicated that Moses should regard the redemption from Egypt not as a failed attempt to reach the ultimate redemption but as a necessary phase in it. Furthermore, by emphasizing that the Mashiach will be revealed riding specifically on a lowly donkey, G‑d was telling Moses that his humility (in wishing to defer to Aaron) was in fact his prime qualification for the role of redeemer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Essay then goes on to bring the Lubavitcher Rebbe's explanation of the different ways Avraham, Moshe, and Moshiach interacted with physicality (As represented by the Chamor/Chomer connection brought by the Gur Aryeh <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/52488/603\">in @DanF's answer</a>), and how that applies to each of us in our own service of G-d.

    "content": "# Should a non-Orthodox Jew wear tzitzit or not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems obvious to me that in general it’s better to keep more mitzvot rather than fewer, but wearing tzitzit seems like a special case. I’ve asked rabbis in my community about this, but I want to ask here to solicit a more diverse response.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Numbers 15</a>:39-40, the section read in the <em>Shema</em> that describes the meaning of tzitzit, says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהָיָ֣ה לָכֶם֮ לְצִיצִת֒ וּרְאִיתֶ֣ם אֹת֗וֹ וּזְכַרְתֶּם֙\n  אֶת־כָּל־מִצְוֺ֣ת יְהוָ֔ה וַעֲשִׂיתֶ֖ם אֹתָ֑ם וְלֹֽא־תָתֻ֜רוּ אַחֲרֵ֤י\n  לְבַבְכֶם֙ וְאַחֲרֵ֣י עֵֽינֵיכֶ֔ם אֲשֶׁר־אַתֶּ֥ם זֹנִ֖ים אַחֲרֵיהֶֽם׃\n  לְמַ֣עַן תִּזְכְּר֔וּ וַעֲשִׂיתֶ֖ם אֶת־כָּל־מִצְוֺתָ֑י וִהְיִיתֶ֥ם\n  קְדֹשִׁ֖ים לֵֽאלֹהֵיכֶֽם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and\n  remember <strong>all the commandments</strong> of the LORD, <strong>and do them</strong>; and that ye <strong>go\n  not about after your own heart and your own eyes</strong>, after which ye use\n  to go astray; that ye may remember and do <strong>all My commandments</strong>, and be\n  holy unto your God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m sure there’s plenty of commentary on this — and I would be honored to be taught more about it — but p’shat seems to me to be clear that tzitzit are the reminder to perform <strong>all</strong> mitzvot and not to subordinate them to going “<strong>after your own heart</strong>.” So what I’m wondering is, if tzitzit are an indication of following “<strong>all the commandments</strong>,” is it appropriate for non-Orthodox Jews to wear them?</p>\n\n<p>Say one dresses liberally by mainstream American standards, let alone Orthodox ones, but wears tzitzit (and a kippah), too. One eats only foods that are nominally kosher, and only eats hechshered meat, but one does eat (vegetarian/dairy only) at non-kosher restaurants. One prays three times a day at the appointed times, but prefers or is at least accepting of egalitarian prayer. One keeps Shabbat in most ways but will still shut off appliances that are no longer being used on Shabbat in order to conserve energy and reduce environmental impact. One is, in other words, the <em>ideal</em> religious Conservative or Reconstructionist Jew, striving hard to incorporate mitzvot into one’s life but sometimes going against rabbinic interpretations for one’s own, personal, ethical reasons (“after [one’s] own heart”).</p>\n\n<p>Should this person not wear tzitzit? Does wearing tzitzit make it a more serious problem to act in these religious but non-traditionally Halakhic ways because of Torah’s clear instruction to keep “all the commandments” while wearing them?</p>\n\n<p>One obvious concern I can think of is <em>marit ayin</em>. Is it better to be seen by the community living this way <em>without</em> tzitzit than with them?</p>\n\n<p>But even privately, what if one does not intend to follow “all the commandments,” at least as rabbinic tradition has conveyed them? Maybe one does aspire to keep “all the commandments” as they interpret them <em>themselves</em>, or in the way their liberal rabbi might interpret them, but certainly not in the way Halakhic tradition does. Is that not a conflict with the pasuk?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The passuk is not saying that tzitzis are a proof to someone's adherence to the other commandments, it is saying that by wearing tzitzis one will come to perform the other mitzvos. If anything, wearing them is a sign of intention to grow, not an award for completion of one's job to. </p>\n\n<p>If one is really worried about maaris ayin one can wear the tzitzis under their clothes. Or another option would be to wear them at home. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I think that you are answering your own question.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, the reason to perform G-d's commandments is because G-d said so. The goal of every Jew is to strive to reach this sense of faith and to act and understand the concept of being an <em>Eved Hashem</em> - a servant of G-d. (When Moses died, the Torah calls him an \"Eved Hashem\".)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, one is required to perform <strong>all</strong> mitzvoth without trying to reason as to why they are done or worse, <strong>if</strong> they should be done. They are not subject to a person's likes or dislikes. As a matter of fact, when we accepted the Torah, we said <em>N'aseh Venishma</em> - We will do, and <strong>then</strong> we will understand. Often, it is the overthinking that prevents us from performing mitzvoth, and that is counter-productive.</p>\n\n<p>I am intrigued by your using the term \"Non-Orthodox\" in your question. I understand your thinking, as you have assumed that \"Orthodox\" equals \"strictly observant\". However, the requirement to perform all mitzvot is incumbent on <strong>all</strong> Jews. Thus, there is no classification or \"sects\", sectors, groups or anything else like that. Every Jew has an equal obligation; every Jew has equal potential; Most importantly, every Jew is required to strive to achieve his own standard of excellence according to his <strong>maximum</strong> ability and nothing less than that. Laziness or making excuses or invalid reasons to not perform a mitzvah is not even an option.</p>\n\n<p>Wearing tzitzit is exactly the reminder, as you have stated, of this concept - not to stray after what the heart thinks! However, wearing Tzitzit is no greater or less important than performing any other mitzvah. As a matter of fact, one is not supposed to evaluate any mitzvah in terms of \"importance\" or in terms of its \"reward\". (Except in some isolated cases, the Torah does not state the reward for the performance of mitzvoth, anyway.)</p>\n\n<p>Having said all this, I realize very well, that the concepts I stated are easier said than done. Nonetheless, a person must strive to do his best, and as Ramba\"m himself suggests in <em>Sefer Mada</em>, every person has the ability to become as great as Moshe, and one is not supposed to diminish his own abilities or think this is impossible. Thus, everyone has the ability to become a true <em>Eved Hashem</em>.</p>\n\n<p>One need not worry that his performance of any mitzvah comes into conflict with his non-performance of any other mitzvoth. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=5353&st=&pgnum=51\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pirkei Avot 4:2</a> says that the performance of 1 mitzvah \"pulls along\" (i.e. causes) the performance of another mitzvah. BTW - the same Mishnah states that one should evaluate the importance of performing a mitzvah against what is lost by not performing it. I.e. - not in terms of punishment, but the missed opportunity & spiritual growth that would be lost in non-performance.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of <em>Marit Ayin</em> is that it applies to something that you're <strong>not</strong> supposed to do, not to something that you <strong>should</strong> do. If you wear your tzitzit outwards and people in your community scoff, let them! It's their problem, not yours!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The only issue that might act against wearing Jewish clothing is if it caused \"Chilul Hashem\".</p>\n\n<p>A man who wears Jewish garb and cheats in business or commits other aveiros is not \"frum\". It doesn't matter how long their peyot are etc. Tzitzit hanging out would be \"chilul hashem\" as it gives an appearance that \"this is how Jews behave\".</p>\n\n<p>One should say \"it is better that he does not cheat in business\" rather than \"better that he didn't wear tzitzit\".</p>\n\n<p>If that is the basis of your reason not to wear them, then maybe. He does one mitzva less but perhaps also one serious aveira less too, so it balances.</p>\n\n<p>The issues you mentioned though, e.g. switching off an electric appliance in your home (have you never heard of timeswitches? And if the device is off due to a timeswitch you can unplug it so it doesn't come back on again, although you can't unplug the timeswitch itself). But in any case, none of these would cause Chilul Hashem so I see no reason why you'd drop the performance of a mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

If the Jewish people during the Babilonian exile would have lived up to the level G'd wanted them to, they indeed would have merited to Yechezkel's structure. However they assimilated there (as is clearly evident from Psukim in sefer Ezra & Nechemia) and in fact the exile really did have to be extended because of that. Because of the danger of further assimilation however, G'd brought them back <strong>as a temporary measure</strong> with a Beth Hamikdash which was never meant to be an everlasting one, and was therefore on purpose not built in that shape, and in which the Aron did not reside. All this in order to make the people realise that this was not yet the final redemption and Beth Hamikdash. During this period the teachings of the oral law became widespread, instead of the way it was studied till then by a select group of people only, so that this would help them afterwards to endure the long exile which was to follow.

But I'm confused by the part that says that two brothers both born after their mother converted (one was conceived before too, and the other not) are also not obligated in <em>yibbum</em>.  I was taught that a child born to a woman who has already converted is fully a Jew (modulo some minor exclusions with, e.g. marrying a <em>kohein</em>); those sons are not <em>bnei</em> Avraham Avinu but, rather, <em>bnei</em> (whoever her Jewish husband is).</p>\n\n<p>The g'mara discusses this on 97 and 98 but I'm having trouble following it.

This is the same as the case of a <em>shifchah</em>, since her becoming free is the same as a free non-Jewish woman converting.</p>\n\n<p>ArtScroll English page 97b4 note 38.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In this case since they were born \"in sanctity,\" after their mother\n  converted, they are <em>not</em> like newborn babes, and they remain related\n  to their mother and, through her, to each other. However, the\n  conversion does sunder their legal relationship with their biological\n  father, as the <em>Gemara</em> will later derive from Scripture (see note 14\n  above). Hence they are maternal, but not paternal, brothers, and like\n  all maternal brothers, they are (Biblically) forbidden to marry each\n  other's wives, and the mitzvah of <em>yibum</em> does not apply (see <em>Rashi</em>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note 14 quotes the Ritva, points to Rashi on 98a ד\"ה לא תימא </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nevertheless, even in this case his relationship with his father is\n  sundered by his conversion (see above, 62a).

The source that you've quoted probably just means that his learning will not 'bear fruit' in that his learning won't be useful to him later when he needs to know what to do, and he won't be able to develop his Torah knowledge properly either. After all, the Gemara also says (Avodah Zarah 19a): אמר רבא לעולם ליגריס איניש ואף על גב דמשכח - a person should always learn even if he will forget. There are even some opinions that state (rather remarkably, I think) that one should even make birkas haTorah on something that he doesn't understand at all (Maharal in Gevuros Hashem ch. 62), which indicates that the mitzvah of learning Torah is not dependent on knowing what one has learned.</p>\n<p>Perhaps a more explicit source is the Mishnah in Avos 5:13, \"ממהר לשמוע וממהר לאבד יצא שכרו בהפסדו\", implying that one quickly forgets his learning 'has lost his reward'. However, <strong>Rabbeinu Yonah</strong> writes on that Mishnah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ההפסד מרובה אחר ששוכח תלמודו, ומה תועלת לענין הידיעה כי מהרה מבין\nהדברים, כי הכל ישכח מלבו. ועם כל זה לא ירפה ידיו מללמוד ש<strong>שכר יש לו\nמחמת הטורח</strong>, כי עושה מלאכת ה' כל היום</p>\n<p>...he does receive reward for his toil, for he's busy with the work of God</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if a person forgets due to negligence, it's probable that he still wouldn't lose the reward for doing the mitzvah in the first place. The Mishnah discussing forgetting one's learning (Avos 3:8 and Menachos 99b) writes that only if one 'actively removes them from his memory' does he violate the prohibition of פן תשכח את הדברים, and while I'm not really sure what that means, I doubt it refers to mere negligence (though the first half of that Misnah might indicate otherwise, so מהא ליכא למשמע מינה).</p>\n<p>However, there is a source to the contrary: Rashi to Brachos 6b. He writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עיקר קבול שכר הבריות הרצים לשמוע דרשה מפי חכם היא שכר המרוצה שהרי רובם אינם מבינים להעמיד גרסא ולומר שמועה מפי רבן לאחר זמן שיקבלו שכר למוד</p>\n<p>The primary reward received by those who run to hear the hear a [Torah] lecture from the scholar is the reward that they receive for running there, because most of them do not understand [the lecture well enough] to recall it and say what they heard from the teacher after some time, that they would receive reward for learning</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi indicates that the only way to receive reward for learning Torah is if one remembers it well enough to have total recall after time has passed. However, the Maharsha (there) argues on Rashi's understanding of this Gemara</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14912&st=&pgnum=10\" rel=\"nofollow\">introduction to the Minchat Elazar</a>.

For example, an old man who has forgotten his Torah (זקן ששכח תלמודו) is still to be shown respect, which would not be the case if his forgetting was due to negligence.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that the same would apply to the value/reward of what was learned and forgotten.</p>\n\n<p>The Minchat Elazar posits very interesting idea that there are two types of Torah study - \"regular\" study which can be forgotten, and that which is taught, which will not be forgotten. He learns this from the medrash relating that when Moshe Rabeinu was first taught the Torah he kept forgetting. Only when G-d gave him the Torah as a gift <em>and he gave it over to בני ישראל</em> did he stop forgetting.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בתחלה הי׳ משה למד תורה ומשכחה עד שניתנה לו במתנה</p>\n  \n  <p>משס נהג נה טובת עין ונתנה לישראל ועליו הכתוב אומר טוב עין הוא יבורך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He includes publishing Torah in the latter category.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In defining the commandment to learn / teach Torah, although Rambam encurages one to retain his learning (e.g. Hil.

The second of each group (2, 5, and 8) are preceded by a warning issued to Pharaoh while sitting on his throne. The third of each group has no warning.</p>\n\n<p>The Maharal explains that the plagues are in 3 groups, working their way up through creation, and each group within itself increases in intensity.

    "content": "# What are Orthodox arguments against Conservative Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What are arguments that Orthodox Jews have published (not on Mi Yodeya) that Conservative Judaism is an invalid form of Judaism?</p>\n\n<p>Have any Orthodox authors written articles or books that made such arguments in detail?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 25)\n\n<p>I'm going to paint this in overly broad strokes, but here goes:</p>\n\n<p>Theologically, the official stance of the Conservative movement is that the Torah was \"inspired by God, but written by man.\" Orthodox theology believes this to conflict with one of Maimonides' principles of faith, that the Torah was dictated by God word-by-word to Moses.</p>\n\n<p>An early practical demarcation between Orthodox and Conservative synagogues was the presence/absence of the <em>mechitza</em>, with many Orthodox rabbis opining that it was <em>prohibited</em> to pray at a synagogue where the men and women sit together. (Much ink has been spilled on this, and at one point a major Orthodox seminary issued all its graduates a copy of <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0881251135\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>The Sanctity of the Synagogue</em></a>, a book all about this subject.)</p>\n\n<p>On various other matters, Orthodox scholars have felt that Conservative rabbis' readings of <em>halacha</em> have been \"overly creative\" in the service of whatever conclusion is desired, put mildly. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2009/07/17/artificial-halacha-two-more-flavors/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here's how Rabbi Yitzchak Adlerstein puts it</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... the responsa of other denominations. I have seen quite a few (they used to be far more popular decades ago, when they made more of a pretense of being halachic) that follow a predictable sequence:</p>\n  \n  <p>1) Decide what conclusion you want to arrive at. This will often be based on predicting what the Jewish ethical response must be in a world that has changed so significantly from the early legal texts of Judaism, that the modern author is given much leeway.</p>\n  \n  <p>2) Find a few gemaros that seem to deal with the issue. If they don’t agree with your conclusion, either ignore them altogether, or find some understanding of each counterexample which will make it irrelevant to our times. This can be done by finding a single Rishon whose explanation of the gemara makes it possible to argue that the rabbis of the Talmud simply would not have said the same thing today. It doesn’t matter if that Rishon’s thinking is outweighed by a huge number of contradictory opinions.</p>\n  \n  <p>3) Alternatively, show why such thinking is simply at odds with contemporary insight and reasonableness, and therefore must be discarded as foreign to the “spirit” of Jewish law and its inherent resiliency and flexibility.</p>\n  \n  <p>4) Find a medrash as a springboard to show how quintessentially Jewish, how much in the spirit of Jewish law your own conclusion is.</p>\n  \n  <p>5) Accept your original argument.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or as our friend Fred put it in a comment below (thank you mori urebbi):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The common thread in those examples is that the Conservative movement (broadly speaking) purports to be a halachic movement but they employ untenable halachic arguments to suit a desired outcome that is itself based in extra-Judaic (or even contra-Judaic) ethics or values.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here are some nice illustrative examples:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Driving a gasoline-powered car on the Sabbath</strong>: (Rabbi Adlerstein gives this example.)</p>\n\n<p><em>Orthodox</em>: The Torah says don't burn things on Saturday, therefore you can't drive a car as it burns gasoline.</p>\n\n<p><em>Reform</em>: The Torah is wrong. The point is to rest, and burning things is only a lot of work when you have to rub stones together. Driving is a much better way of resting than walking a mile!</p>\n\n<p><em>Conservative</em>: Well ... the Torah says don't burn things, <em>but</em> ... well ... the Talmud says it's not as bad if you do it for different purposes than its Biblical use. The Biblical use of burning was to boil water [to cook dyes for tapestries], but when you burn gasoline the purpose is for <em>transportation.</em> (Orthodox response: the Talmud's example of alternate-purpose is burning a document to destroy it. The Biblical use case is burning as a fuel source, which is exactly what a gasoline engine does.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intimate touching between two men.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Orthodox:</em> The Torah says men shouldn't sleep together. It also says \"don't come close to shameful acts\"; just as it's wrong for a married woman to do \"everything but\" with someone other than her husband, it's wrong for two men to do \"everything but.\"</p>\n\n<p><em>Reform:</em> The Torah is wrong. Religion should have no say on what consenting adults do with their private parts.</p>\n\n<p><em>Conservative:</em> Well ... we can't contradict the verse in the Torah ... so we can't actually allow certain actions ... but ... well we'll just have commitment ceremonies, we don't know what they'll really do in private ... and because of human dignity, we'll allow \"everything but.\" (Orthodox response: \"human dignity\" is used Talmudically to allow minor infractions in situations where they've accidentally collided with human dignity, e.g. there's no pre-cut toilet paper in the bathroom and now you're stuck. Not to do away altogether with a prohibition.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>A female cantor reciting the <em>Amida</em> out-loud, and a man in the congregation will listen to fulfill his obligation</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Orthodox:</em> the Talmud says you can only fulfill someone else's obligation if your level of obligation is greater than or equal to theirs. The Talmud also says that men have more obligations vis-a-vis prayer than women; therefore, a woman praying out-loud can't fulfill a man's obligation.</p>\n\n<p><em>Reform:</em> The Talmud is wrong. There should be no gender differences in Judaism. What's more, the whole concept of a monarchical deity dictating is outdated. Prayer should respect personal autonomy and individual spirituality.</p>\n\n<p><em>Conservative:</em> well, we can't argue with the Talmud ... but ... well, we can demand our female cantors take a vow to pray thrice daily, thus reaching the same level of obligation as men. (Orthodox response: that obligation would be due to the force of the vow, not the original obligation to pray per se.) Or ... we will hereby obligate all women to pray thrice daily, and if most of them don't or can't do so, well, that's not our concern.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>One of the consistent promoters of Torah/Orthodox Judaism is <a href=\"https://www.rabbiavishafran.com/a-little-personal-background/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Avi Shafran</a>.</p>\n<p>Already in his first book, \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0872030644\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewthink</a>\" published in 1977 he laid out very clearly the Orthodox perspective that any form of Judaism that claims to be legitimate must (among other things) accept halacha as being binding.</p>\n<p>This would of course delegitimize Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism, since they do not claim to be bound by halacha.\nBut obstensively, Conservative Judaism would still be included, since they claim fealty to halacha.</p>\n<p>Over the past few decades, he has repeatedly demonstrated that the Conservative movement is not actually a halachic movement.\nHis most famous piece discussing this was published in <a href=\"https://momentmag.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Moment Magazine</a> February 2001 under the title \"The Conservative Lie.\" (It's available from Moment through a subscription based archive service <a href=\"https://search.opinionarchives.com/Moment_Web/DigitalArchive.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, along with the follow-up. Rabbi Shafran has made the article available on his own website <a href=\"https://www.rabbiavishafran.com/time-come-home/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.) Here are the opening few paragraphs (slightly abridged):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sincere and dedicated Conservative Jews need to face an uncomfortable\nfact: Their movement is a failure. To make so sweeping a statement is\npainful to me... I hope I will be forgiven by Conservative readers for my forthrightness, but their movement is effectively defunct.</p>\n<p>...But the essential goal of\nthe entire Conservative experiment—to inspire Jews to Jewish\nobservance—not only remains unrealized, but recedes with each passing\nyear.</p>\n<p>That failure has not resulted from any lack of effort. The\nConservative rabbinic leadership has done all it could to set less\ndemanding standards for Jewish religious observance, and has produced\nreams of paper purporting to justify them. It has established pulpits,\nproduced rabbis, and attracted members.</p>\n<p>But even the movement’s radically relaxed standards remain virtually\nignored by the vast majority of Jews who identify as Conservative.\nAccording to the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey, a mere 29\npercent of Conservative congregants buy only kosher meat. A mere 15\npercent consider themselves Sabbath observant (even by Conservative\nstandards).</p>\n<p>A study of Conservative congregants conducted by the Jewish\nTheological Seminary’s Jack Wertheimer in 1996 confirmed that the\nmovement was utterly failing to meet its most minimal goals. A\nmajority of young Conservative-affiliated Jews polled said that it was\n“all right for Jews to marry people of other faiths.” And nearly\nthree-quarters of Conservative Jews said that they consider a Jew to\nbe anyone raised Jewish, even if his or her mother was a gentile—the\nofficial Reform position, rejected by Conservative leaders as\nnonhalachic. Tellingly, only about half of Conservative bar and bat\nmitzvah receptions were kosher, by any standard.</p>\n<p>There are two explanations for Conservatism’s striking failure: (1)\nThe movement is not honest, and (2) it is superfluous.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The dishonesty is regarding their stance on halacha. he first quotes a few major Conservative rabbis who emphatically proclaim that Conservative Judaism is bounnd by halacha.\nHe then goes on at length to cite numerous examples of how the Conservative movement is not a halachic movement, including copious statements from conservative rabbis themselves who openly acknowledge this.</p>\n<p>He mentions there as well a general critique of the Conservative halachic process:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The law of probability leads us to expect that there will be times\nwhen the halachic result will be more lenient than one might expect,\nand other times when it will be more demanding. Tellingly, though, and\npractically without exception, Conservative “reinterpretations” of\nJewish law have entailed permitting something previously forbidden.\nWhether the subject was driving a car on the Sabbath, the introduction\nof “egalitarian” services, or the Biblical prohibition of certain\nmarriages, the “reevaluations” have virtually all, amazingly, resulted\nin new permissions. That is a clear sign not of objectivity but of\nagenda, of a drastically limited interest in what the Torah wants from\nus and a strong resolve to use it as a mere tool to promote personal\nbeliefs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The second point he mentioned, about Conservative Judaism being superfluous, was a separate point about how the Reform movement is more effective at doing what Conservative movement tried to do; it's not relevant for the discussion here.)</p>\n<p>Moment Magazine subsequently published two articles responding to Rabbi Shafran, written by very prominent Conservative rabbis. The magazine then published a rebuttal by Rabbi Shafran in June 2001.\nIn that piece, he apologized for the name of the prior article; \"The Conservative Lie\" was chosen by the magazine, not by him.</p>\n<p>More significantly, he focused on the responses of the two Conservative rabbis. He pointed out how their articles only focused on the fact that Conservative Judaism is thriving, and that they accused him of sinas chinam (baseless hatred). But they never actually offered any evidence contradicting his point that their movement is not halachic!</p>\n<p>Many of the points he makes in the article also feature prominently in his earlier book \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1478215232\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Migrant Soul</a>.\"  It's the story of a man who converts, first to Conservative Judaism and then to Orthodox Judaism. Rabbi Shafran knew the man (and his Jewish wife who is also becoming more religious) while they were going through the conversion process and helped them with the conversion.</p>\n<p>In the book, there are numerous real-life examples of how this sincere convert to Conservative Judaism keeps finding out that Conservative Judaism isn't actually halachically compliant. It describes how the conservative rabbis said the local seafood restaurant was kosher, even though all the fish was cooked with non-kosher oil; shatnez isn't applicable, nor is there a need to kasher dishes which were used for non-kosher food; laws of family purity should not be followed today; and much more. These are actual examples from first-hand knowledge that Rabbi Shafran recounts in the book.</p>\n\n\n",

Why Rabbi?\" I answered The main issue of Orthodox Judaism is the belief that we have been handed down, from generation to generation, father to son and rebbe to student, the Torah and the Mesorah (traditional explanations). Once we have a firm belief in believing that the Torah and Mesorah are the word of haShem, THEN we do our best to keep the words of haShem. \nAnother time, asked to speak to the parent body of a nondenominational school, I shared a point that I heard from one of my Rebbeim, Rabbi Yisroel Miller, currently of Edmonton, Canada.\"After 120 years, I can hope to have one solid 'excuse' for not excelling in keeping all the Mitzvot. \"If I would have had more time, I would have made it!

I'm personally not really a fan of that last one, as it carries with it the implication that dating and marriage isn't really being treated with the seriousness that it deserves, but that's what people say.</p>\n\n<p>This type of \"on the market\" is not related to the שוק of your שלחן ערוך, which is an example given of someone who entered marriage \"on the spot,\" without proper consideration; here, ironically, \"the market\" implies the <strong><em>lack</em></strong> of <em>shidduchim</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Why is it bad if no Shiduch?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Kiddushin.12b.20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on that gemara</a> writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דרב מנגיד כו' - משום פריצותא</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav would administer lashes etc. - because it's not proper (because of פריצות)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<em>translation mine</em>)</p>\n\n<p>This, I believe, is intended to explain all of the reasons that Rav would administer lashes -- among them the מקדש בשוקא (someone who married a woman in the <em>shuk</em>/marketplace), as well as the מקדש בלא שידוכי (someone who got married without <em>shidduchim</em>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Shiduch means a discussion concerning marriage. The mashal my rebbi told me about this was where do you want to live what do you do etc. Basic dating conversation, nothing special really. The flip side is seeing a woman on the street and without saying two words to her first, proposing. How decent does that sound? Does it sound like anything more than pure lust? </p>\n\n<p>The marketplace is just a mashal for an open, public place. In America we would say in the street, like in the example I gave. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Okay, a couple of things going on here.</p>\n\n<p>\"Shidduchim\" translates as \"courtship\", i.e. dating someone and getting to know them before marrying them. A <em>shadchan</em> is a matchmaker.</p>\n\n<p>We say a person is \"in shidduchim\" or \"holding by shidduchim\" if they're at the point in life that they're looking to meet someone to marry. You could say: \"Sara is looking to find a husband\"; \"Sara is in shidduchim\"; or less nicely, \"she's on the market\" (i.e. viewing it as a \"marketplace\" of men and women looking to marry.)</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud is simply saying we don't just go get married out of the blue. To get married \"in the market\" (like the old open-air markets) means out in the middle of the street -- go find a building! The same thing if you just met the lady five minutes ago and now you run off to marry her -- that's not how we do it!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The \"nu\" clause\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The accepted Halacha is that one should not interrupt with unnecessary speech between the blessing on washing hands and making Hamotzi.  There are other situations where talking is prohibited or ideally avoided, such as during the Blessings before Shema, during the blowing of the <em>shofar</em>, and many other examples.</p>\n\n<p>I've noticed a common practice that if it is needed to chastise someone, or tell them to stop what they are doing, during one of these times, people will look at the person and very agitatedly say \"<em>nu</em>?!\"</p>\n\n<p>Is there any reason this is considered less talking than any other gibberish? Does the fact that it has become accepted parlance to mean, basically, \"stop doing what you aren't supposed to be doing\" or \"start doing what you are supposed to be doing\" make it into a word, and therefore perhaps it shouldn't be said? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch rules that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>One may not interrupt between washing and eating, even with doing nothing or walking around.</p></li>\n<li><p>One who interrupts, need not wash again, unless he's become totally distracted from this washing, by doing some [major unrelated] activity or talking a lot.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>He brings this in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0040_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן מא - הלכות בציעת הפת וברכת המוציא</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>סעיף ב':</strong> יֵשׁ לִזָּהֵר <strong>שֶׁלֹּא לְהַפְסִיק בֵּין נְטִילַת יָדַיִם לְהַמּוֹצִיא</strong>, אֲבָל מֻתָּר לוֹ לַעֲנוֹת אָמֵן עַל אֵיזֶה בְּרָכָה שֶׁהוּא שׁוֹמֵעַ. <strong>וּשְׁהִיָּה כְּדֵי הִלּוּךְ כ\"ב אַמּוֹת, אוֹ מִבַּיִת לְבַיִת, אֲפִלּוּ הִלּוּךְ מְעַט, וְכֵן אִם דִבֵּר מַה שֶּׁאֵינוֹ לְצָרְכֵי הַסְּעוּדָּה מִקְרֵי הֶפְסֵק</strong>. וּבְדִיעֲבַד <strong>אִם הִפְסִיק לֵית לָן בָּהּ</strong>, וּבִלְבַד שֶׁלֹּא עָשָׂה אֵיזֶה מַעֲשֶׂה בֵּינְתַיִם, אוֹ שֶׁהִפְלִיג בִּדְבָרִים, דְּאָז הֲוֵי הֶסַּח הַדַּעַת וְצָרִיךְ נְטִילָה שֵׁנִית. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So technically there's not difference between saying \"nu\" and saying \"come already!\" or \"behave yourself!\". If it's required for the meal then it's allowed, if it's not required for the meal to begin, then it's forbidden but one needn't wash again.</p>\n\n<p>I think people say \"nu\" (or \"Ein!\" as we used to say at home) as a self-reminder not to talk more than needed, which is a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, the Mechaber in  <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01975_part_13.html#HtmpReportNum0000_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן קסו - דין הפסקה בין בציעה לנטילה</a> brings an opinion that one need not worry about interrupting between washing and eating, though he recommends being stringent about it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>א:</strong> יֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים <strong>שֶׁאֵינוֹ צָרִיךְ לִזָּהֵר מִלְּהַפְסִיק בֵּין נְטִילָה לְהַמּוֹצִיא</strong>, וְיֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים <strong>שֶׁצָּרִיךְ לִזָּהֵר</strong>, וְטוֹב  לִזָּהֵר. וְאִם שָׁהָה כְּדֵי הִלּוּךְ  כ''ב אַמָּה, מִקְרֵי הֶפְסֵק (תוס' פ' אֵלּוּ נֶאֱמָרִים). ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The last sentence \"וְאִם שָׁהָה כְּדֵי הִלּוּךְ  כ''ב אַמָּה, מִקְרֵי הֶפְסֵק \" is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/14738/759\">in smaller print but not prefixed by <em>הגה</em>, so I'm not sure who wrote it</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>It appears that the same applies to other places you are not supposed to talk. Viz., if you speak - or even sit quietly for long enough - it's not considered a Hefsef requiring you to restart. But talking  - or making any noises or otherwise distracting yourself - is highly discouraged.</p>\n\n<p>E.g. in Hilchos Shma we learn in Shulchan Aruch in  <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01975_part_5.html#HtmpReportNum0007_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן סה - הנכנס לבית הכנסת ומצא צבור קוראין קריאת שמע או שהפסיק בשעת הקריאה</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>א:</strong> קְרָאָהּ סֵרוּגִין, דְּהַיְנוּ שֶׁהִתְחִיל לִקְרוֹת, <strong>וְהִפְסִיק בֵּין בִּשְׁתִיקָה בֵּין בְּדִבּוּר וְחָזַר וּגְמָרָהּ</strong>, אֲפִלּוּ  שָׁהָה כְּדֵי לִגְמֹר אֶת כֻּלָּהּ, יָצָא, אֲפִלּוּ הָיָה הַהֶפְסֵק מֵחֲמַת אֹנֶס: הגה: וְיֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים דְּאִם הָיָה  אָנוּס וְהִפְסִיק כְּדֵי לִגְמֹר אֶת כֻּלָּהּ, חוֹזֵר לְרֹאשׁ (תוס' וְהָרֹא''שׁ פֶּרֶק מ''ש וְהַטּוּר), וְהָכֵי נָהוּג, וּמְשַׁעֲרִין עִנְיַן הַשְּׁהִיָּה לְפִי הַקּוֹרֵא, וְלֹא לְפִי רֹב בְּנֵי אָדָם (רַשְׁבָּ''א ר''פ הָיָה קוֹרֵא) וְכֵן הוּא לְקַמָּן סִימָן ק''ד.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding Psukay D'Zimra, one shouldn't talk, unless it's to be polite, as we learn in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01975_part_4.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן נא</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ד:</strong> צָרִיךְ לִזָּהֵר מִלְּהַפְסִיק בְּדִבּוּר, מִשֶּׁיַּתְחִיל בָּרוּךְ שֶׁאָמַר עַד סוֹף י''ח: וַאֲפִלּוּ לְצֹרֶךְ מִצְוָה אֵין לְדַבֵּר בֵּין בָּרוּךְ שֶׁאָמַר לְיִשְׁתַּבַּח (בֵּית יוֹסֵף בְּשֵׁם כָּל בּוֹ) וע''ל סי' נ''ג וְנ''ד.‏</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>ה:</strong> בֵּין הַמִּזְמוֹרִים הָאֵלּוּ שׁוֹאֵל מִפְּנֵי הַכָּבוֹד, וּמֵשִׁיב שָׁלוֹם לְכָל אָדָם, וּבְאֶמְצַע הַמִּזְמוֹר שׁוֹאֵל מִפְּנֵי הַיִּרְאָה, וּמֵשִׁיב מִפְּנֵי הַכָּבוֹד. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similary regarding Shofar we learn in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01975_part_34.html#HtmpReportNum0011_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן תקצב - תפלת מוסף בקול (רם) וסדר התקיעות</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ג:</strong> לֹא  יָשִׂיחַ, לֹא הַתּוֹקֵעַ וְלֹא הַצִּבּוּר, בֵּין תְּקִיעוֹת שֶׁמְיֻשָּׁב לִתְקִיעַת שֶׁמְעֻמָּד מִיהוּ בְּעִנְיָן הַתְּקִיעוֹת וְהַתְּפִלּוֹת אֵין הֶפְסֵק (מָרְדְּכַי וּמַהֲרִי''ל), <strong>וְאִם סָח דְּבָרִים בְּטֵלִים אֵין צָרִיךְ לַחֲזֹר וּלְבָרֵךְ</strong> (טוּר); וְאֵין צָרִיךְ לוֹמַר שֶׁלֹּא יָשִׂיחוּ  בֵּין בְּרָכָה לַתְּקִיעוֹת, אִם לֹא בְּעִנְיַן הַתְּקִיעוֹת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously if one talks between the Bracha and the first blows, one has to redo the Bracha, as the Be'er Heitev says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>בין</strong>. ואם סח בין ברכה לתקיעה אפי' מענין התפילה צריך לחזור ולברך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All the examples we are discussing, are <em>adjacent</em> Mitzvot, or Mitzvot that start and take a long time to end.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>My 2¢…\n To what extent one must be carefull not to be מפסיק between washing and his Bracha is a dispute between the Rambam and the Rosh, with the Rosh being stringent.\n The Mishna Berura in siman 165 #7 &  siman 166 #2 rules not to speak at all אפילו שיחה מועטת. \nIn the שער הציון in both places he says he is ruling like the Elya Rabba and Magein Giborim in the name of the Magen Avraham (M.A.) in siman 179 and not like the M.A. in 165 where he says one can talk שיחה בעלמא (nothing important) two or three words, taking for granted that the M.A. actualy contradicts himself.\n This idea that there is a contradiction is not so simple as pointed out in the Nesiv Chaim in 179 who says the M.A. there was merely pointing out the opinion of the Rosh. \n The Shulchan Aruch HaRav in 166 rules in accordance with the M.A. (as he does more so than the M.B.)\n So what we have here is a regular old machlokes achronim, directly dependant on a machlokes rishonim. As such minhag, custom, plays a big role as far as psak. The fact that people are accustomed to not talk even two or three words however unimportant means that they have accepted the stringent opinion. However, in cases like this there is a loophole used many times where we can say they did not accept the stringent opinion in all cases. Your case of 'nu' even if it is word would qualify. In fact the M.A. and Shulchan Aruch HaRav mention the custom of saying מזמור ה׳ רועי וגו׳. There are also many people who say 'ברשות' before making המוציא in a public setting, (apparently an attempt to get everyone's attention see 167 2 in Ramma) even though they won't say other words. The idea presented here would work to understand that minhag too.</p>\n\n<p>'Nu' from what I've seen is not commonly used in other places, like When trying to goad the shliach tzibur during Birchas Krias Shema. Usually it's 'uh'. This is much lower on the 'is it a word' totem pole. I think people consistently use 'nu' when hephsek is not such an issue, for instance when trying to get the tzibur to be quite during leining or chazzaras hashatz.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In a place where it's forbidden to make a hefsek, \"nu\" should not be said - especially since this expression has a well-known meaning, so it's basically the same as saying a word.</p>\n\n<p>Between netila and hamotzi, if one says \"nu,\" b'dieved it's perfectly fine and not a problem at all.</p>\n\n\n",

It was a time when there was a rash of stabbings, and stabbing attempts, in the Old City and the cameras were meant to both help catch the perps and to also discourage it in the future, as they will know they could more easily be caught.</p>\n\n<p>The issue was raised that perhaps the cameras operating on shabbos would be a problem with those walking through the Old City on Shabbos to go to the Kotel. Rav Elyashiv was supposedly asked and after being made certain that it was not based on motion sensors and no lights were to be activated based on people walking by he paskened that people could continue to walk to the Kotel on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Kikar Shabbos is reporting, based on a notice in the Yated Neeman, that it seems the security system is not being monitored the way it was meant to be. Therefore, Rav Elyashiv has supposedly said that people should not walk to the Kotel on Shabbos, because they might be tripping security cameras. Until the system is checked to be ok, one should avoid it. According to Kikar, while Rav Elyashiv initially was satisified with the arrangements, at a later time he, or his people, tried to get the police to make some changes to some of the technological aspects of the system to satisfy some more machmir concerns. When the police refused to comply with the request for additional changes, Rav Elyashiv supposedly withdrew his support.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously such a psak will affect thousands of people every shabbos. And not just those who are walking to the Kotel These security cameras are placed throughout the Old City and if the psak is really true as publicized, people throughout the Old City will have to stay in their homes the whole Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n",

He saw an Egyptian man strike a Hebrew man, (one) of his brethren. (Moshe) turned this way and that way and when he saw that no man (was watching), He smote the Egyptian and hid (his body) in the sand” (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9863#v=11\" rel=\"nofollow\">2:11</a>-12).</p>\n\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9863#showrashi=true&v=13\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemot 2:13</a>-15 says that Datan and Aviram snitched to Pharaoh about what Moshe had done. </p>\n\n<p>How could Datan and Aviram have seen the incident if Moshe was sure no one had seen him kill the Egyptian taskmaster?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There is argument among the commentaries about exactly what happened. Some say (like Rashi on verse 14) that Moshe killed the Egyptian by saying the sacred name of God. Others (like the Ibn Ezra on verse 12) say that this is patently wrong and Moshe hit the Egyptian with a stone. The Ramban on verse 14 walks a middle route saying that Moshe might have outstretched his hand when he recited a curse which killed the man and the others might have seen the outstretched hand and (though Moshe figured they would not have connected that with the killing because he simply stretched his hand) jumped to the conclusion that he hit the Egyptian, or that others saw him bury the body and figured that he had the intent to kill and buried the body so that's enough proof.</p>\n\n<p>There is also the explanation that \"there was no man\" (in Rashi on verse 12) that it wasn't that there was \"no man watching\" but that there would be no sufficient man who would have descended from this particular Egyptian so killing him was acceptable.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/raba2/1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">medrash rabba 1: 28</a> the man getting beaten was in fact Dassan the husband of the woman who was tricked. The Radal there #41 wants to amend the text to say she was the sister of Dassan, but either way, he had personal knowledge of what transpired, and turned around and slandered Moshe, the man who saved him, or his relative.</p>\n\n<p>See there also #29 when the Torah says that Moshe buried the mitzri in sand, it means the Jews who are compared to sand, and there was noone there besides Yisraelim so he told them you are compared to sand, and just like sand makes no sound when moved from one place to another so too bury this fact amongst yourselves and tell no-one. And so we find that this was made known only through the Yisraelim when he went out the next day and found two Ivrim fighting.</p>\n\n<p>I would suggest another option is that the Jewish man getting beaten told them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%91_%D7%99%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi on \"וירא כי אין איש\"</a> did not imply that there was no one who saw him kill the mitzri, but that there was no man <strong>would be descended from him</strong>. This would mean that probably someone saw him do that (e.g Datan and Aviram).</p>\n\n\n",

In here, the only differences seem to be related to the funeral and shiva customs. There does not seem to be any difference in the burial, itself, other than what I mentioned, above. Perhaps, the mourners, congregants say fewer prayers, say them in English, etc. However, IMO, these rituals should not prevent anyone from attending the burial. From what I gather, everything else, is the same. The body is buried; it's in a casket (I have heard that in Israel, particularly, there are some that don't bury the body in a casket, and that's a specific minhag.), etc.</p>\n\n<p>If you are aware of any specific rituals that make a Reform burial different, please cite them.

Why is this? </p>\n\n<p>See parshas Bo 10 13 where the east wind is described as bringing the locust. By no other makeh is the physical process for bringing the plague described. </p>\n\n<p>Famously in parshas Bishalach 14 21 a powerful east wind is described as drying the sea bed.</p>\n\n<p>Again in parshas Beha'alosecha 11 31 the quail are brought through a wind. We are never told how Manna was created or brought. </p>\n\n<p>Also of note is ורוח אלקים מרחפת על פני המים in Bereishis 1:2, as pointed out by @Shokhet. Targum there says it was a רוח מן קדם ה׳, a wind from Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>I am not going into descriptions of wind involvement found in the prophets, but if it would help, feel free to reference them. </p>\n\n<p>So what is special about wind that it is mentioned when used by Hashem? There seems to be no other force consistently mentioned when used by Him.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ruach was the first herald to the shechinah mentioned in malachim 19:11, followed by ra'ash, then eish, then the kol demamah dakah (shofar). </p>\n\n<p>That also seems to follow the structure of har sinai - the cloud came first (ruach), then the ra'ash came before the eish, and right before it says the dibros it says \"Kol hashofar halech vichazek me'od.\" </p>\n\n<p>Most situations/nisim are resolved primarily with ruach, and only afterwards come the others  as needed. See Korach - first the annan is seen, then the ra'ash and the eish when they fail to heed the annan.</p>\n\n<p>Eschatological texts in tanach suggest that we go through a period of eish and ra'ash (including an earthquake in Israel) before we reach \"Uvayom hahu yitaka bashofar gadol.\"</p>\n\n<p>So to summarize, the ru'ach seems to symbolize the \"first line\" of miracles. Larger miracles invoke eish and ra'ash, and the shechinah itself seems to be heralded after these via the shofar.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The weather has many variables and is therefore still in the hands of Hashem. We pray for good weather, but we don't pray for the rest of nature to continue. </p>\n\n<p>Although Hashem controls the whole world, when something out of the ordinary happens we can't trace it to Hashem unless it stands out in timing or in its wonder. When the wind causes something it is still not seen as simply nature, since there is no constant nature for the wind.</p>\n\n<p>To be a bit more clear, even during a great miracle there is, or might as well be, some kind of scientific phenomenon going on beneath the surface. The splitting of the sea might have been performed by combining seldom known, or unknown, natural phenomena and lining them up through the variables of nature. These wouldn't be mentioned, since the 'how' is unimportant and diverts attention from the point, which is that Hashem runs and rules the world.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, watching an unexpected wind bring something grand about only adds to the idea that it is intervention from above.</p>\n\n\n",

Rashi (or whatever medieval commentary there pretends to be Rashi) says simply -- \"roughly the same age, not a young man visiting an old man or vice versa.\" Rosh, however, says the visitor needs to be born under the same astrological sign as the visitee; presumably otherwise, I guess the karma (or the personalities?) don't \"click\" the same way.</p>\n\n<p>So let' just leave it loosely as \"with the person suited to him.\" My impression is this was the more traditional wedding notation, at least printed in the direction from the groom to the bride. </p>\n\n<p>\"Im bechirat libo/liba\", \"with the one his/her heart has chosen\", as you indicated, sounds easier to our modern ears; it's gender-neutral; and it avoids the spooky stuff; so many modern invitations simply put this in both directions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A rav explained to me that the word \"Gilo\" come from \"gil\" related to \"gilah\" meaning \"joy\".

What about bentching? If yes, why doesn't it make the Rambam's list of devarim shebikdusha (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2208.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Tefillah 8:4</a>)? If not, why are ten men required to use Hashem's name?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The relevant Gemara here is on Megilla 23b. The Mishna there lists a number of things which require a Minyan. The Gemara explains that \"all Devarim SheBikdusha\" require a Minyan (based on some verses). It then gives reasons for requiring a Minyan in the last few instances of the Mishna (including Zimmun beShem and Birkat Chatanim), namely, that it isn't appropriate (\"אורח ארעא\" the way of the land) to say those without a Minyan.</p>\n\n<p>The Arukh haShulchan you cite seems to be understanding that the last things on the list are not Devarim SheBikdusha even though they require a Minyan and that's why there is an additional reasoning brought. So he would answer your question in the negative.</p>\n\n<p>My own thought: the Gemara in a number of places (eg. MK 28b, Nedarim 62) lists among the things which a Kohein get precedence in both Devarim SheBikdusha and first rights at \"blessing\" (let's work with most Rishonim that this refers to leading Zimmun). Perhaps we could argue that it needed to specify this because leading Zimmun is not a Davar SheBikdusha. (This only works if we take לפתוח ראשון like Rashi in Gittin 59 unlike Rashi in Horayot 12.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Mishna (megillah 23b) there lists a number of things which require 10 men, and includes saying God's name in the zimun for birkas hamazon. The Gemara then goes on to explain the reason for everything on the list: all \"Devarim SheBikdusha\" require a minyan (based on some verses), and, in the last few instances, (including Zimmun beShem and Birkat Chatanim), the reason is that it isn't appropriate (\"אורח ארעא\" the way of the land) to say those without a minyan. Thus, the implication appears to be that, while all devarim shebikdusha require a minyan, not all things that require a minyan are a Davar SheBikduasha, and zimun seems to belong in the latter category. This is most likely the Aruch Hashulchan's reading of the Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Mishnah Berurah (199:15) and Kaf Hachayim (199:20) statee explicitly that Birkas HaZimun is actually a Davar SheBikdusha, based on the Levush, and this appears to be the position of the Kesef Mishnah (Hil. Berachos 5:7) as well. </p>\n\n\n",

These people tend to call themselves Talmidei HaRambam.</p>\n\n<p>Do any poskim hold that it is permissible for one not raised in a Teimenite minhag to switch to following his rulings (and by implication ignore contradicting rulings from later poskim)?  If not, how are such people treated in halacha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>In the responsa collection of the Beth Yosef, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=636&st=&pgnum=70\">Avqath Rokhel #32</a> he defends those who conduct themselves according to the Rambam, even in a place where the majority of people follow another <em>poseq</em> (in this case, the Rosh). The turn of phrase that indicates that one can do so regardless of their familial tradition is: \"...especially if they have a tradition from their fathers...\" In other words, a person should not be forbidden from following the Rambam ESPECIALLY if they have a family tradition of doing so, which implies that one should not be forbidden from doing so even if they don't.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are other very important considerations to such an undertaking:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>To be a \"Talmidh HaRambam\" one must follow ALL of his leniencies and ALL of his stringencies</em></strong>: This is even stated by the Beth Yosef here in this <em>teshuvah</em>. This means only eating eating certain <em>shekhittoth</em> of meat (which cannot be found easily in Israel, and not at all outside of Israel), your wife wearing a <em>hi-jab</em> to cover her hair and neck, your young girls covering their hair as well, and this is only to name a few. The Jewish reality codified by the Rambam is a completely different reality in many respects to the one occupied by religious Jewry today. One cannot become a <em>\"Talmidh HaRambam\"</em> in order to eject from many of the stringencies of mainstream orthodoxy today and not follow the Rambam when he is strict or a <em>da`ath yahidh</em>.</li>\n<li><strong><em>There never in history existed \"Talmidhei HaRambam\" as such</em></strong>: Throughout Jewish history since the publication of the Mishneh Torah there has never been a concept of only and always following the Rambam. Not in Yemen, not in Aleppo, not in Eress Yisra'el, nowhere. There were always minor exceptions in both matters of <em>minhagh</em> and <em>halakhah</em> as there most likely was even among those whom the Beth Yosef defends in his <em>teshuvah</em>. Even the Rambam himself and his son, Rabbenu Avraham, did not follow the rulings codified in the Mishneh Torah 100%. There are various reasons for this, not the least of which are situations of halakhic need which require certain innovations or the invocation of other opinions. To be a \"Talmidh HaRambam\" in the sense of following the Rambam in absolutely every opinion he holds - to the exclusion of all else - is a relatively new phenomenon that is not at all possible and has caused many problems among those who have tried.</li>\n<li><strong><em>One needs a competent Rav in the tradition of the Rambam</em></strong>: The best way, <em>le-`aniyuth da'ati</em> to follow the Rambam in our time - and in any time - is to connect oneself with a Rav in the tradition of the Rambam. This would mean either a Yemenite, a Syrian, or many of the Sefardic <em>rabbanim</em> in the world today. Or, one could also find a <em>meqori</em> Rav to learn from who is largely based on the Rambam (but not exclusively so), such as Rav Dawidh Bar Hayyim of Yerushalayim. The fact is that Rav Qaro in the Shulhan Arukh rules like the Rambam through direct quotations approximately 85% of the time, so Sefaradim who are true to the Gemara over the Qabbalah are fairly close to the Rambam most of the time. Not only will this help to avert the plethora of errors made by those who try to forge their own path in the Rambam (often without even being able to read and understand Hebrew), but it will also help a person be consistent and able to navigate all of the non-ideal halakhic situations that arise in the course of normal everyday life.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As far as how such people are treated in <em>halakhah</em>, they are treated like every other religious Jew. However, in today's <em>haredi</em> world, anyone who does anything different than the status quo is often branded an \"apikoros\" for daring defy the words of the [Ashkenazi] \"gedolim.\" If Sefaradim are often treated like second-class citizens, I can tell you that Yemenites are treated even worse than that many times for the \"crime\" of following the Mishneh Torah over the Shulhan Arukh. Many reading this may not like such a statement, but I maintain that my assessment is true and accurate. So, I am not saying that one should not pursue such a path, but only that one should know what they are getting into before they do so.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that this helps.</p>\n\n<p>Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Tzitzis: does the same string need to be used for all windings?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While there are over a dozen customs as to how exactly one should tie tzitzis strings, all are in agreement (I think) that it involves winding one string around the others some number of times. I have always seen this accomplished by making one string significantly longer than the others, so that it can act as the 'shamash'.  However, is this necessary, or a hiddur? Does the same string need to be used for all of the windings?</p>\n\n<p>Regarding tzitzis with t'cheiles, the Gemara (Menachos 39a, see <a href=\"http://tekhelet.com/tekhelet-tying-tools/tying-tzitzit/\">here</a>) does say to \"start with white and end with white\" even though the windingings in between are done with the blue string, but does that indicate that one can switch strings even within the same color?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Yes, it is preferable, but not mandatory. The Mishnah Berurah (O.C., Siman 11, Se'if Katan 22) writes that if the <em>shamash</em> string is not long enough you can switch to another string. In fact, he explains that this is learned out from techelet tying, where you are definitely going to switch <em>shamash</em> strings (i.e. from white to blue, etc.).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The windings are made with what is called the \"shamash\" string which would be from the techelet (blue string). For an excellent discussion of this entire subject, I strongly recommend seeing the following link. The entire site is worth checking out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://tekhelet.com/tekhelet-tying-tools/tying-tzitzit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tekhelet.com/tekhelet-tying-tools/tying-tzitzit/</a></p>\n\n<p>If you are tying them correctly, the requirement would be to use the same string. A video showing one of the ways how to tie is on this link and also the specific language from most of the major poskim on this subject.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://tekhelet.com/tekhelet-tying-tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tekhelet.com/tekhelet-tying-tools/</a></p>\n\n<p>Some people think that Rambam suggests that more than one string can be used. But Rambam holds, unlike all other poskim that the thread of techelet is half blue and half white. So when he is saying use a white thread and then use a blue thread, he is still referring to the same thread.</p>\n\n\n",

In this case, the first one becomes a Revi'i as usual and the second becomes a Yetiv as usual, resulting in the unusual formation of Yetiv followed by Pashta (confusing, as it looks remarkably like a standard Mahpach-Pashta combo).</p>\n\n<p>There is no reason a Pesik should be relevant to these situations, so your case is a regular Mahpach-Pashta with a small pause in between.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>I understand that a psik is a \"rest\", i.e., it is unsounded trope. I am unaware of any instance where there is a psik between a mapach and pashta, as these 2 notes, I believe, are connected and are a group. AFAIK, a psik should not change the manner of cantillation other than to cause a pause (nice rhyme, huh?) If you can link to where you saw a psik betweena mapach and pashtah, that would help.</p>\n\n\n",

If yes, then does it make a difference if a minority (halachikly valid) opinion supports them?</p>\n\n<p>(I would think that there is liability and it is a shogeg because it is not a deliberate violation. However, if they know the science behind it, then they are consciously doing the melacha action; therefore, if they suspect that it is a problem, they may be considered a meizid. On the other hand, the suspicion may need to be an obvious one--like where everyone knows it is a halachik prohibition--to even consider this person a meizid. </p>\n\n<p>The other factor is when a minority opinion supports this person's incorrect view. One can argue that even though the view is not normative halacha, because there is no Sanhedrin there is no liability all together, even if the person is a meizid (there may be other issues in heaven for such an individual, but not connected to chillul Shabbat liabilities). However, one can argue that the future Sanhedrin can retroactively cause liability when they vote on what the law follows. This aspect of the question is a whole other lengthy topic.).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> writes as follows in his commentary to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitzavim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parshat Nitzavim</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>התועלת השני הוא להודיע שמי שירצה להסיר מעליו עול התורה בשלא יכוון לדעת\n  עניניה כדי שיהיה שוגג בכל מה שיעבור עליו מדברי התורה ולא יענש על זה\n  הנה לא תועילוהו המחשבה הנפסדת הזאת [להצילו] מן העונש אבל יענש יותר\n  ומחה ה' את שמו מתחת השמים כאמרו כי אז יעשן אף ה' וקנאתו באיש ההוא</p>\n  \n  <p>The second lesson is to make known that one who wants to remove the\n  yoke of Torah from himself by not directing [himself] to know its\n  contents, in order to be [classified as an] unintentional [violator]\n  in everything that he violates of the words of the Torah and\n  [therefore] not get punished for this, will not be helped by this\n  disgraceful thought to save him from punishment.

(G'mara goes into this issue). So if they, say, did something that constitutes building, then remembered the halacha, then forgot again and did again something that constitutes building, that is 2 korbanot because there were 2 separate periods even though it was one category.</p>\n\n<p>Of course nowadays we do not have korbanot, but it is useful to learn chapter 7 of Shabbat for the sake of learning.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara mentions someone how knows there is a concept of Shabbat and that Melacha is prohibited on it, but did not take the effort to find out more when they could have done. That is really the case you are discussing. There is also mentioned the person who did not know anything about Shabbat and it says they require one korban for everything, although I think the Gemara questions how such a person can be liable at all. They also discuss the person who is liable for 39 chatot, who only knew the law of Techumim.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, to be liable for korban chatat, it has to be a bibical prohibition, not a Rabbinic one. </p>\n\n<p>With regards the minority opinion, it could even be that both agree that something is forbidden but they disagree whether the prohibition is biblical or Rabbinical, but I believe that sometimes the majority opinion even determines what the Biblical halacha is. I can't therefore give specifics to that particular use case but hopefully by the time the Moshiach comes and builds the Temple, you'll be able to get the shayla answered as to how many korbanot you (or whoever) owes.</p>\n\n\n",

Also, a staff was a symbol of authority and every major person had his own. See the statement by Yaakov or Yehudah and Tamar as an example.</p>\n<p>The magicians also had their own staffs as well which they used when performing magic (as when Moshe and Aharon first came to Par'o).</p>\n<p>This was also stated in that way to show that there was nothing \"magical\" about the staffs, as opposed to what the magicians tried to convince everyone.

The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.2.28a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar 2:28a</a> clearly delineates between Moshe and Aharon's sticks. It writes there as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שמות ז׳:ט׳ וְאָמַרְתָּ אֶל אַהֲרֹן קַח אֶת מַטְּךָ. <strong>מַאי טַעֲמָא מַטֵּה אַהֲרֹן, וְלא מַטֵּה מֹשֶׁה</strong>. אֶלָּא, הַהוּא דְּמֹשֶׁה אִיהוּ קַדִּישָׁא יַתִּיר, דְּאִתְגְּלִיף בְּגִנְתָּא עִלָּאָה בִּשְׁמָא קַדִּישָׁא, וְלָא בָּעֵי קוּדְשָׁא בְּרִיךְ הוּא לְסָאֳבָא לֵיהּ בְּאִינּוּן חוּטְרִין דְּחַרְשַׁיָּא</p>\n<p>\"And you shall say to Aharon: Take your stick\" (Shemos 7:9). <strong>What is the reason (he was told to take) the stick of Aharon and not the stick of Moshe?</strong> Rather it was because Moshe's (staff) was more holy since it was cut/forged for the sake of a higher purpose with a holy name, and Hashem did not want it to become defiled (through touching) the staffs of the Egyptian magicians.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem from the Zohar that Aharon very clearly had his own staff, and his stick was chosen above Moshe's to perform the sign in front of Pharaoh and his court, lest Moshe's staff, which was of a holier nature, would become defiled in some way.</p>\n\n\n",

Use your common sense and CYLOR. </p>\n\n<p>As far as yogurt, you will find a few questions on this site trying to get to the bottom of whether to consider it a liquid or a solid. I will relate my experience with Rabbi Dovid Feinstein concerning this. I had your same exact question and presented it to him as such. Is yogurt a drink which would qualify it to be drunk before shacharis? He asked me 'what?' multiple times as I repeated the question. Finally he said why do you want to? I said I get bad heartburn from the Chulent and if I can have yogurt in the morning before davening, it would help alleviate the problem. He paused for a moment, looked at me very seriously and shook his head yes. I am quite certain his allowance was based on some type of choleh she'ein bah sakana (or yeish bah, depends on how you view heartburn) but he definitely avoided answering the yogurt liquid issue.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The poskim don't differentiate between liquids and solids.

This is interpreted as a person who eats and drinks and feels haughty first and then only decides to daven to HaShem.</li>\n<li>There are a group of drinks that are permitted since they do not fall into the category of haughtiness. The Tur and Shulchan Aruch 89:3 write that water is permitted since haughtiness does not apply to it. The Pri Chadash 89:3 writes that this is talking about water without sugar because sugar is the pinnacle of haughtiness and is forbidden. He continues that this applies to coffee as well which is mutar, and especially in Egypt where the mind isn’t settled without coffee (sugar has to be omitted). The Mishna Brurah brings the Pri Chadash and adds that milk is prohibited as well. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However, the Sefer Hagaos HaMarsham 89:3 is lenient with sugar in tea and coffee. He writes that nowadays since the whole world drinks tea and coffee with sugar (for many they can’t drink without sugar) it is now permissible. He writes that milk in coffee is also permitted and there is no concern for haughtiness (one should not drink from a silver cup which is a problem before davening). The milk is considered batel b’rov and is negligible (Pri Megadim Ashel Avrham 608:6).</p>\n\n<h1>Types of drinks</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Coffee and Tea</strong> – one can drink a coffee or tea with sugar and milk (shouldn’t be an overwhelming amount of milk)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Soda</strong> – The Avnei Yashfei writes that carbonated drinks depends on the person. If they feel full from it then it is assur, but if they do not feel full then they can drink it. The Rivevos Ephraim 8:22:2 brings Rav Mordichai Fridlander who permits Coca-Cola and the Rivevos Ephraim agreed with that psak. Rav Belsky is of the opinion that one should not drink soda.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Orange juice and apple juice</strong> – Rav Belsky is of the opinion that the minhag is to be lenient with orange juice. The Avnei Yashfei holds one should be stringent and refrain from drinking all fruit and vegetable juice before davening (based on a machlokes).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Beer, whisky and malt beer</strong> – Beer is forbidden according to all opinions. Some hold that one can drink a little whiskey before davening to give some strength. The Avnei Yashfei refers to a drink called black beer (sweet malt that isn’t intoxicating) which he holds is mutar to drink unless one feels satiated from it then its assur.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Milk</strong> – From the words of the Maharsham (who held a drop of milk is ok) it seems that a cup of milk is assur, and only a minimal amount of milk in coffee and tea is permitted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hot Cocoa</strong> – Rav Belsky(Shulchan Halevi siman 7) holds that hot coca is a chashuv drink that contains a lot of sugar, chocolate, and milk ,and one should not drink it before davening(a child who is bar mitzvad already, may be allowed to drink it if he needs strength).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cappuccinos and iced coffee with a lot of milk</strong> – According to Rav Belsky(Piskei Halacha) one should not drink these before davening(in general he holds that a chasuv drink is assur but one that gives strength is mutar).</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The Avnei Yashfei holds that one can chew gum since all he is doing is swallowing the sweetness of the gum but isn’t eating it (like chewing on licorice- Mishna Brurah 90:45). However, when it comes to the sugar candy he is hesitant to allow it since eventually the whole candy is swallowed.  Rav Belskey (Shulchan Halevi 7) holds that a sucking candy is surely prohibited.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I compiled this recently.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Doctor recommends pacemaker. Does the patient have to listen?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Suppose a doctor recommends a patient receive a pacemaker, both improve the quality of life and extend the patients life. However, the patient has no interest in getting one. Does Halacha compel the patient to get a pacemaker?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There is a responsum from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein\">Rav Moshe</a> about a patient refusing medical care, in the fifth volume of <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/eng/\">Tzomet</a>'s halachic journal, <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/Eng/?pg=sitemap&CategoryID=169\">תחומין</a>. Here is a very loose translation/summary of what he writes there.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When a patient refuses to take (life-saving) medicine, it depends on\n  <em>why</em> he is refusing. If he still believes that he could be healed by this doctor, but is reluctant to do something which is painful for\n  him, which is a מעשה שטות ומעשה תינוקות, a juvenile/stupid thing to\n  do, then we force the patient to take the medicine, as much as we are\n  able to.<br>\n  However, if he does not think that this doctor will be\n  successful at healing him, then we have to find doctors that he\n  believes will be effective at healing him. But if there are no doctors\n  who the patient thinks will be effective, or if it is impossible to\n  make the patient understand that what we are doing is for his benefit,\n  then we force him to take the medicine, so long as all the present\n  doctors feel that this is beneficial for him.  </p>\n  \n  <p>However, the only cases where we force a patient to pursue healing are\n  those where the patient will not become upset (שלא יתבעת מזה); for if\n  the patient should get upset, this can be be harmful, even\n  life-threatening. Thus, in those cases, it is better to do nothing.<br>\n  Therefore, in every case where there is a patient that is unwilling to\n  undergo treatment, all of these variables need to be weighed\n  carefully, before forcing treatment on a patient; the only time\n  doctors should force treatment on a patient is when they do so לשם\n  שמים, with good intent.</p>\n  \n  <p>Additionally, if there is any amount of סכנה, danger, in the pursuit\n  of this treatment, even if the doctors usually administer this\n  treatment, because the illness is more dangerous, the patient cannot\n  be forced into treatment.</p>\n  \n  <p>With regards to administering a treatment that is dangerous, but the\n  danger of the illness is still greater (i.e., in general, and not in a \n  case where the patient is refusing treatment) -- one should not always\n  administer this treatment, because even if the treatment was proven to\n  be safe <em>for healthy people</em>, there isn't necessarily proof that it's\n  safe for a very ill patient. A potentially dangerous treatment should\n  <em>never</em> be administered, unless there is proof that <em>more than half</em> of the people who are sick with this illness, to the degree to which\n  this patient is sick, have recovered from their illness.<br>\n  This calculation must be done carefully, because it is hard, even for very\n  great doctors, to calculate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the halacha in this case, according to Rav Moshe, is dependent on many factors -- the mindset of the patient, the chance of recovery, and the danger of the illness and the treatment. As with all halacha questions on Mi Yodeya, it's best to ask a knowledgeable rabbi for a final ruling.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Hershel Schachter's reading of the Rambam is that in some cases where treatment is painful and the outcome uncertain, this may be the patient's choice -- within reasonable limits. (He wrote a fascinating article in the <em>Journal of Halacha & Contemporary Society</em> many years ago in which he compared this decision to Israel's decision of land-for-peace.) But if the prognosis is so good that any reasonable person would go with it, the patient is obligated to go with treatment.</p>\n\n<p>He clarified on a yutorah shiur that an otherwise healthy seventeen-year-old who needs a diseased limb amputated and can live into his 70s with a prosthetic is obligated to do so, rather than say \"no I'd rather die at 17 than have an amputation!\" His student, Rabbi Kenneth Brander, describes (also in a yutorah shiur) the tale of a fellow who'd always been a powerful and influential figure who developed a host of serious medical problems around age 60 or so. He wanted to leave the earth now, rather than live on for many years as a shadow of his former self, always on the receiving end of others' kindness and treatment. Rabbi Brander wasn't sure if this passed the reasonable-person test; Rabbi Schachter came down to Florida, met with the patient, examined the details of this situation, and concluded that it did -- i.e. this was the patient's choice.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0031_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">סימן לב - שמירת הגוף על פי הטבע</a>  says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>סעיף א':</strong> הוֹאִיל וֶהֱיוֹת הַגוּף בָּרִיא וְֹשָלֵם מִדַּרְכֵי הַֹשֵם הוּא, שֶׁהֲרֵי אִי אֶפשַׁר שֶׁיָבִין אוֹ יֵדַע דָּבָר מִידִיעַת הַבּוֹרֵא וְהוּא חוֹלֶה, לְפִיכָךְ צָרִיךְ הָאָדָם לְהַרְחִיק אֶת עַצְמוֹ מִדְּבָרִים הַמְאַבְּדִין אֶת הַגוּף, <strong>וּלְהַנְהִיג אֶת עַצְמוֹ בִּדְבָרִים הַמַבְרִין וְהַמַחֲלִימִים אֶת הַגוּף</strong>. וְכֵן הוּא אוֹמֵר, וְנִֹשְמַרְתֶּם מְאִד לְנַפְשׁוֹתֵיכֶם. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based in the Pasuk  וְנִֹשְמַרְתֶּם מְאִד לְנַפְשׁוֹתֵיכֶם one has an obligation to actively keep the body healthy and help it heal.</p>\n\n<p>And again in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0191_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">סימן קצב - דין החולה והרופא ובמה מתרפאין</a> we learn:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>סעיף ג'</strong>: הַתּוֹרָה נָתְנָה רְשׁוּת לָרוֹפֵא שֶׁיְרַפֵּא, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר, וְרַפֹּא יְרַפֵּא. וְלָכֵן אֵין לוֹ לַחוֹלֶה לִסְמֹךְ עַל הַנֵּס, אֶלָּא <strong>חַיָב לְהִתְנַהֵג בְּדֶרֶךְ הָעוֹלָם לִקְרוֹא לְרוֹפֵא שֶׁיְרַפֵּהוּ</strong>. וּכְבָר כַּמָה חֲסִידֵי עוֹלָם נִתְרַפְּאוּ עַל יְדֵי רוֹפְאִים. וּמִי שֶׁמּוֹנֵעַ אֶת עַצְמוֹ מִלִּקְרוֹא לָרוֹפֵא, שְׁתַּיִם רָעוֹת הִנֵּהוּ עוֹשֶׂה, הָאַחַת, דְּאָסוּר לִסְמֹךְ עַל הַנֵּס בְּמָקוֹם שֶׁיֵּשׁ סַכָּנָה, וְדָבָר זֶה גּוֹרֵם שֶׁיִזָּכְרוּ עֲוֹנוֹתָיו בִּשְׁעַת חָלְיוֹ. וְעוֹד, דַּהֲוֵי יֻהֲרָא וְגֵאוֹת שֶׁסּוֹמֵךְ עַל צִדְקָתוֹ שֶׁיִתְרַפֵּא בְּדֶרֶךְ הַנֵּס. <strong>וְיֶשׁ לוֹ לִקְרוֹא לָרוֹפֵא הַיוֹתֵר מֻמְחֶה</strong>, וּבְכָל זֹאת לִבּוֹ יְהֵא לַשָׁמַיִם, וִיבַקֵּשׁ רַחֲמִים מֵאֵת הָרוֹפֵא הַנֶּאֱמָן יִתְבָּרַךְ שְׁמוֹ, וְאַךְ בּוֹ יִבְטַח לִבּוֹ (ברכי יוסף) (וְעַיֵּן לְעֵיל סִימָן סא סָעִיף ד). ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A person has an obligation to heal himself - and to do so with the best medical team available. </p>\n\n<p>Like any other Torah obligation, one does not have a dispensation simply because one is  depressed.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore we learn in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0193_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">סימן קצד - דיני גוסס ושמירת המת</a> that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>סעיף א'</strong>: הַגּוֹסֵס (פֵּרוּשׁ, הַמַּעַלֶה לֵחָה בִּגְרוֹנוֹ מִפְּנֵי צָרוּת הֶחָזֶה, וְזֶה יִקְרֶה סָמוּךְ לַמִּיתָה, וּלְשׁוֹן גוֹסֵס הוּא מִלְּשׁוֹן מֵגִיס בִּקְדֵרָה, שֶׁהַלֵּחָה מִתְהַפֶּכֶת בִּגְרוֹנוֹ, כְּמוֹ הַמֵּגִיס בִּקְדֵרָה תוספת יום טוב, פרק א דערכין) הֲרֵי הוּא כְּחַי לְכָל דְבָרָיו. וְלָכֵן אָסוּר לִגַּע בּוֹ, שֶׁכָּל הַנּוֹגֵעַ בּוֹ, הֲרֵי זֶה שׁוֹפֵךְ דָמִים. לְמָה הַדָּבָר דּוֹמֶה. לְנֵּר מְטַפְטֵף, שֶׁכֵּיוָן שֶׁנּוֹגֵעַ בּוֹ אָדָם, מִיָד נִכְבֶּה. <strong>וְאַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהוּא גוֹסֵס זְמַן אָרֹךְ וְיֵשׁ צַעַר גָדוֹל לוֹ וְלִקְרוֹבָיו, מִכָּל מָקוֹם אָסוּר לִגְרֹם שֶׁיָמוּת מְהֵרָה</strong>, כְּגוֹן לְהַשְׁמִיט הַכַּר וְהַכֶּסֶת מִתַּחְתָּיו, מֵחֲמַת שֶׁאוֹמְרִים, שֶׁיֵשׁ נוֹצוֹת מִקְּצָת עוֹפוֹת שֶׁגּוֹרְמִים לְעַכֵּב אֶת הַמִּיתָה, אוֹ לָשׂוּם מַפְתְּחוֹת בֵּית הַכְּנֶסֶת תַּחַת רֹאשׁוֹ, כָּל זֶה אָסוּר. אֲבָל אִם יֵשׁ שָׁם דָּבָר שֶׁגּוֹרֵם עִכּוב יְצִיאַת הַנֶּפֶשׁ, כְּגוֹן קוֹל דוֹפֵק וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָזֶה, מֻתָּר לַהֲסִירוֹ, דְּאֵין בָּזֶה מַעֲשֶׂה, אֶלָּא שֶׁמֵּסִיר אֶת הַמּוֹנֵעַ וְאֵינוֹ נוֹגֵעַ בּוֹ. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even somebody in his death throes - who is clearly in pain - even if it's taking a long time for them to expire - is considered fully alive and one commits murder if one hastens his demise.</p>\n\n<p>The קיצור ש''ע ילקוט יוסף is even more explicit about the absolute obligation to heal oneself.

But there might well be other species similar to the\n  young camel? — That should not enter your mind. For a Tanna of the\n  school of R. Ishmael taught: It is written: The camel because it\n  cheweth the cud. <strong>The Ruler of the universe knows that there is no\n  other beast that chews the cud and is unclean except the camel</strong>;\n  therefore the verse particularly stated ‘it’. R. Hisda further said:\n  If a man was walking in the desert and found an animal with its mouth\n  mutilated, he should examine its hoofs; if they are parted he may be\n  certain that it is clean, but if not he may be certain that it is\n  unclean; provided, however, he recognizes the swine. You admit then\n  that there is the swine [which is the exception to the rule]. But\n  there might well be other species similar to the swine? — That should\n  not enter your mind. For a Tanna of the school of R. Ishmael taught:\n  It is written: And the swine because it parteth the hoof. <strong>The Ruler\n  of the universe knows that there is no other beast that parts the hoof\n  and is unclean except the swine</strong>; therefore the verse particularly\n  stated ‘it’. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Chullin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When The Talmud states that the camel is the only exception to the chewing cud rule Rashi adds: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וחבריו האמורים בפרשה </p>\n  \n  <p>And its fellows that are mentioned in the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I.e. the Talmud means that the three animals mentioned in the Torah are exceptions to the rule.</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing here about a proof to \"TORAH MIN HASHOMAYIM\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>All camelids can interbreed, which is the general guideline for determining if two animals are the same “species” in Halacha. Camels, llamas, alpacas, etc are all camelids.\nSimilarly, their are many types of “swine” that all fall under the category of “chazir”.\nRhinos don’t have split hooves, nor do they chew their cud, aardvarks also have neither of those attributes, so It’s not clear why the article (or Rabbi Slifkin) would claim that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Torah's description of taxonomy which is meant for iron age people is not like 19th-century phylum and genus type taxonomy.

But you can point to the llama and tell the iron age man \"hey, don't eat that camel\" and achieve your goal. Is there any non-kosher near-eastern animal that is sort of like a llama that you could use besides camel?</p>\n\n\n",

Typically, I have noticed that it is also customary to place a \"pulpit\" directly in front of the amud for the rav's sermons. However, I have also noticed in some schuls that there is also a pulpit on the back-side of the bimah, directly opposite the shulchan.</p>\n\n<p>What is the purpose of this second pulpit in such schuls and why is it not in sufficient to have just the one on the duchan?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Read the supplement to <a href=\"http://www.beureihatefila.com/files/2007-12-14_Tefila_Newsletter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> which discusses the various designs of shuls in terms of the placement of the <em>Shulchan</em> and <em>duchan</em> as well as the nomenclature used throughout time.</p>\n\n<p>He states that Rambam suggests that everything should be in the middle of the shul, but there are few people / places doing that mainly b/c of space and design constraints. Thus, a suitable option was to have a dais next to the Aron. Excerpt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The dais occupied a great deal of room, preventing those whose place\n  was behind it from seeing and hearing. In order to eliminate both\n  problems, most modern synagogues have no almemor in the middle; thus,\n  more room for seating is available for worshipers, and everyone has an\n  unobstructed view of the precentor's desk and the ark. The new\n  arrangement came up against considerable opposition, and had to be\n  justified by numerous rabbinical opinions, but in view of its\n  practicality it has come in nearly everywhere. In America, Germany,\n  and Austria-Hungary, synagogues are only rarely built with the almemor\n  in the middle, but rather the dais is placed directly before the steps\n  leading up to the ark. On it stand the precentor's desk (also called\n  cenr) and the reader's table, with the former facing the ark and the\n  latter, the congregation. In a few rare exceptional cases these are\n  the same. Another furnishing of the dais, since ancient times, is a\n  chair (`qk) or bench on which the person sits who holds the Torah\n  while it is being rolled and awaiting its return to the ark. In\n  ancient times the sermon was delivered from the dais, and in the Greek\n  synagogues the speaker used a special platform; in recent times the\n  platform is situated directly before the ark or, in individual cases,\n  on a pillar by one of the side walls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In most shuls I have attended, including my current one, there is a lectern on the bima, and when the rav gives his drasha from the lectern, his back is towards the Aaron facing the congregation.</p>\n\n<p>My current shul is somewhat unusual in style as the table is in the back of the shul (Sefardi style) and there is only one table that is used bith for davening and Kri'at Hatorah. There is no shtender *lectern) in front of the shul below the bimah.</p>\n\n<p>Another shul in my neighborhood has no bimah - everything is on the same level. One lectern is to the right of the Aron where davening is done. The rav sits to the left of the aron. There is another larger table in the middle of the room for Torah reading and this is where the rav delivers his sermons from. His back is to the aron when he speaks.</p>\n\n\n",

But on Shabbos, the body must be totally subordinate to the soul, and the life of the soul also affects the body, that it conduct itself with life and not by rote.</p>\n<p>And this is why the language is precise (<em>Y'sha'yahu</em> ibid.): \"If you restrain your foot (<em>raglecha</em>) because of Shabbos (<em>miShabbos</em>)\" [lit. \"from Shabbos\"]. Because it apparently should have said, \"If you restrain your foot on Shabbos\".

After each miracle, the Torah speaks of how Pharaoh's magicians replicated them, at least superficially. After the first two replications, Pharaoh dismisses Moshe's and Aaron's act (the transforming staff and Nile in blood) as just magic. But then after (frogs) Pharaoh demands from Moshe to stop the plague, instead of his magicians? Why not consult the magicians first? I mean if his magicians are replicating all of these 'signs', why not ask them first? What reason was there for Pharaoh to believe that Moshe's acts were different from those of his necromancers?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>If O.K., I shall disconnect your two questions.

Pharaoh called Moshe and Aharon only for plagues that affected him physically to the point that he thought he would die if the plague continued. With the Nile turning to blood, he was able to find water surrounding (outside the Nile) or buy water from the Israelites. The frogs were <strong>inside</strong> the person, so he thought he would eventually die if this continued. Though Ohr Hachaim doesn't explain, directly, I think we can deduce that Pharaoh's own magicians would not do something magical to cause this type of physical harm to Pharaoh. (That wouldn't be in their best interest if they wanted to remain on their job, let alone be alive if Pharaoh discovered who did this.)</p>\n\n<p>View the commentary for a detailed explanation regarding which plagues Pharaoh called for Moshe, and which he didn't as well as why.</p>\n\n\n",

If so what exactly are we gaining?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>R Yaakov Weinberg explained that an eved, a servant, is someone who is nullified to someone or something else.  When you serve Hashem, it should be as a servant, as someone who is doing the will of Hashem and <em>not</em> his own will.  If you serve Hashem because you see how beneficial it is, then you are not really serving Hashem, you are actually serving yourself and it just happens to coincide with what G-d wants (R' Hirsch explains this to be the meaning of תחת אשר הלכתם עמי בקרי - you walked with Me, but it was coincidental that you were walking with me). An eved Hashem is someone who serves Hashem because he understands that he <em>must</em>, not that he chooses to do so as his best available option. The question of \"what's in it for me\" is a way of making your <em>mitzvos</em> not an act of doing Hashem's will.  The reason to be a \"servant of G-d\" is not because of any self interest.  We should want to be servants of G-d in order to be doing the right thing, as the Rambam describes in the introduction to Chelek.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, it happens to be that we are still gaining, although this shouldn't be our agenda.  What are we gaining?  What we are gaining is an attachment to the only real existence.  As the Nefesh HaChaim describes in Shaar Gimmel, chapters 2 and 3, Hashem is the only authentic existence.  We, by nullifying ourselves to Him, are accessing our only means of connection to real existence.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is the topic of the Gate of Service of God in the Chovos Halevavos</p>\n\n<p>see <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=416\" rel=\"nofollow\">there</a> at length</p>\n\n<p>some quotes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is proper to open this treatise with an exposition of the various\n  kinds of benefits human beings render each other, and the\n  corresponding obligations of gratitude.

If one smells a bad smell should also wait until the smell goes away.</p>\n\n<p>What should a Shaliach tzibbur needs to pass gas do? Should he wait and be embarrassed or just continue because of kavod habriyos (human dignity)? Same question if he smells a bad smell: does he wait?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Your issue is discussed by the Ramma there, and his source. He quotes the Trumas Hadeshen #16 who used the idea of kavod habrios to relinquish someone praying publicly from moving four amos away, and from saying the yehi ratzon brought in the Mechaber. </p>\n\n<p>What the Ramma didn't mention is that the Trumas Hadeshen specifically mentions a kol shekein for a shliach tzibur to be embarrassed. </p>\n\n<p>The Trumas Hadeshen did say he thought it was hard to invent Halakhic ideas not mentioned or hinted to in the gemara and geonim.</p>\n\n<p>But apparently the Ramma had no problem using this idea. However the Ramma did end off by saying one must wait for the smell to dissipate, something not specifically addressed in the Trumas Hadeshen. Apparently, the Ramma was not willing to rely upon this idea as concerns the smell.</p>\n\n<p>If, however the person did not pass gas yet, and we are discussing holding himself back from doing so,  the Trumas Hadeshen is willing to assume he can continue praying and there is no prohibition against praying while holding back bodily needs, which he is willing to accept is only said concerning urine and feces, when continuing to pray without first going to the bathroom makes his prayers a to'eyva, disgusting and worthless (see <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/hashoneh-halachos/sat_12_10_11/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> for halachic specifics and conditions).</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, the Ramma seems to have liked this particular Trumas Hadeshen so much, that he weighed it against a Tshuva from the Rashba in siman 92 siff 2.</p>\n\n\n",

If there is no need, then one should not change his place.</p>\n\n<p>The poskim in Israel say clearly that in case of danger (e.g., animals, rockets), one has to change his place (e.g., to go to a shelter).

There is a logic to this as well. During shmone esre we are speaking to the King of the World. Interrupting this discussion by speaking with someone else is problematic.

See for instance <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=21b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 21b</a> where a possible change of language and alphabet from ancient times is discussed. </p>\n\n<p>Concerning some of the points you raised, the Talmud Yerushalmi  in Rosh Hashana chapter 1, right in the beginning of the gemara on halacha 2, tells us that the names of the angels and the months came up from the Babylonian exile. Again, honest and straightforward.</p>\n\n<p>See now the begining of the last chapter in Sanhedrin called Chelek. Chazzal spend a lot of time telling us how important belief in the messiah is and that it's not enough to believe in the concept. We must also believe that this is an ancient belief hinted to multiple times in the Torah. This would mean that under no circumstance can one think this idea came from an outside source. Also, as mentioned before if it would have come from an outside source, chazzal would have told us.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Reading the definition of Zoroastrianism in different places seems to imply a belief in tw \"gods\" with one being good (creator) and one being evil (destruction), even though modern people claim that it is monotheistic. In any case, people living in a society have been influenced by that society in the way they think and act, as we see nowadays. However, the statement as you give it or, as places like Wikipedia seem to try to imply, that Zoroastrianism influenced the foundation of Judaism is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Jews were part of the Persian Empire (as in the time of Purim or in Bavel in the time of the gemora), then there would have been influence in the same way that we are influenced by the nonJews today. However, since the Jews were not under the influence of the Persian Empire before Persia conquered Bavel (after the destruction of the first Temple), Zoroastrianism could not have had any influence on the Jews before then. Thus they had no influence on the inception of Judaism or any other point in Jewish history until then.</p>\n\n<p>While it is theoretically possible that a dualistic religion arose during the 292 years between the flood and the birth of Avraham or during the 752 years before the Bnei Yisrael went down to Egypt, They would not have had any influence on them during that time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Zoroastrianism, the creator Ahura Mazda is all good, and no evil\n  originates from him. Thus, in Zoroastrianism good and evil have\n  distinct sources, with evil (druj) trying to destroy the creation of\n  Mazda (asha), and good trying to sustain it. While Ahura Mazda is not\n  immanent in the world, his creation is represented by the Amesha\n  Spentas and the host of other Yazatas, through whom the works of God\n  are evident to humanity, and through whom worship of Mazda is\n  ultimately directed.</p>\n  \n  <p>Zoroastrians believe that there is one universal, transcendent,\n  supreme god, Ahura Mazda, or the \"Wise Lord\". (Ahura means \"Being\" and\n  Mazda means \"Mind\" in Avestan language).[8] Zoroaster keeps the two\n  attributes separate as two different concepts in most of the Gathas\n  and also consciously uses a masculine word for one concept and a\n  feminine for the other, as if to distract from an anthropomorphism of\n  his divinity. Some Zoroastrians claim Ahura Mazda as the uncreated\n  Creator to whom all worship is ultimately directed, thereby\n  formulating a panentheistic faith with a transcendent divinity, widely\n  believed to have influenced the theology of Isma'ilism.[9] Other\n  scholars assert that since Zoroastrianism's divinity covers both being\n  and mind as immanent entities, it is better described as a belief in\n  an immanent self-creating universe with consciousness as its special\n  attribute, thereby putting Zoroastranism in the pantheistic fold where\n  it can be easily traced to its shared origin with Indian\n  Brahmanism.[10][11] In any case, Ahura Mazda's creation—evident is\n  widely agreed as asha, truth and order—is the antithesis of chaos,\n  which is evident as druj, falsehood and disorder. The resulting\n  conflict involves the entire universe, including humanity, which has\n  an active role to play in the conflict.[9]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and <a href=\"http://www.religionfacts.com/zoroastrianism/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zoroastrianism</a></p>\n\n<p>The Zoroastrian concept of God incorporates both monotheism and dualism. In his visions, Zarathustra was taken up to heaven, where Ahura Mazda revealed that he had an opponent, Aura Mainyu, the spirit and promoter of evil.</p>\n\n\n",

He goes on to to say this applies not only to wasteful things but even to learn chachmos haolam is assur to occupy ones time with because it says vidibarta bam. </p>\n\n<p>You get the point. What should be pointed out, and perhaps members of Lubavitch can chime in if there is a tradition amongst them concerning this, is he keeps bouncing back and forth between 'doing' something productive for one's livelihood verses wasting time. But each time he discusses wasting time he specially mentions talking about worthless things. Even when discussing the learning of other knowledge he comes back to the idea concerning talking. So it may be argued that he is only concerned with time wasting which is talking related due to the high regard this religion puts on talking. Especially amongst the Kabbalisticaly leaning, which the baal hatanya definitely was.* </p>\n\n<p>Also, even if you don't agree to this, at least agree that the only person who can claim to use this source to disallow a hobby or any other act that wastes time would have to first claim that they never shmooze. Ever.</p>\n\n<p>None of this takes into consideration that a hobby or anything else that helps a person relax may be a necessary health benefit that is ignored amongst most teachers of the modern version of the far right extreme of orthodoxy, along with exercise and eating healthy. </p>\n\n<p>One last point concerning a musical instrument, the students of nevua would play instrument to get themselves into the right state of mind for prophecy. More recently though the Chavos Yair in siman 205 discusses whether a Talmid Chacham can play guitar for a Chassan and Kalla or if it a bizayon to do work publicly. This is mentioned in the Pischei Tshuva in siman 244 #4. But notice he doesn't say it's a bizayon being proof that he wastes time and doesn't learn. The time this talmid chacham spent learning his instruments apparently does not bother anyone.</p>\n\n<p>*See Ksuvos 5b The Rabbis taught, a person should not let dvarim bateilim into his ears because they are the first part of the body to get burnt. The Maharsha explains that 'hearing is the only sense that chazzal said to keep away from what is muttar and only talk about mitzvos. As opposed to other senses, for instance sight, a person is never warned not to look at things that are allowed to be looked at. The reason is because they get burnt first, meaning it is very easy to go from hearing things that are muttar to things that are assur, which is why they are burnt first, because issur is found by them more.'</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R Gil Student has a nice article on this topic (<a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2019/06/is-leisure-kosher-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Is leisure kosher?</a>) where he identifies a number of \"kosher hobbies\" focused on constructive or distractive leisure</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>opportunities for personal development (e.g., for creative hobbies such as drawing, painting, music)</li>\n<li>exercise (sports, hiking) which is important for health (see Mishneh Torah, Hilkhos Dei’os ch. 4) or increasing our appreciation of Hashem's creations</li>\n<li>relieving pressure, e.g., napping, speaking with friends</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2019/06/is-leisure-kosher-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a> for sources and examples.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My source text for this question is the comment of the <em>Mesilas Yeshorim</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מסילת ישרים פ\"א</strong>: \n  נמצינו למדים כי עיקר מציאות האדם בעולם הזה הוא רק לקיים מצוות ולעבוד ולעמוד בנסיון <strong>והנאות העולם אין ראוי שיהיו לו אלא לעזר ולסיוע בלבד לשיהי' לו נחת רוח וישוב דעת למען יוכל לפנות לבו אל העבודה הזאת המוטלת עליו.</strong> ואמנם ראוי לו שתהי' כל פנייתו רק לבורא יתברך ושלא יהי' לו שום תכלית אחר בכל מעשה שיעשה אם קטן ואם גדול אלא להתקרב אליו יתברך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The bold translated) The pleasures of the world are only to be used as an aid and a support for the person to have satisfaction and peace of mind to enable him to turn his heart towards the divine service of which he is obligated.</p>\n\n<p>What is the goal of the hobby?

It follows, then, that the offering\n  are not a mere concession to polytheism. <em>The offerings antedate\n  polytheism</em>.

How exactly did they come away\nfrom the encounter with Shechem with more energy? It somehow focused\nthem on their core greatness, their unique portion. The Shem MiShmuel\n(Vayishlach 5762) calls this hinas'us, the elevation of the self. Upon\nentering Eretz Yisrael, Avrhaham went to Shechem to draw strength.\nYaakov went to Shechem after years of personal exile in order to get\nhis power back. And Yehoshua takes Klal Yisrael there as soon as\npossible to seal the covenant and returns there before his death to\nfortify it. They did this knowing that in Shechem lies a great danger.\nThe Torah shows us up cloe the damagaing, intoxicated delusions of\nShechem bas Chamor. A place that helps people focus on their perosnal\ngreatneess carries the risk of causing them to think of thesmevles as\nmore than what they really are, and conseqeuntly to grow out of touch\nwith the people around them. This is what happened to Yosef's brothers\nwhen they gathered in Shechem to garner strength after feeling\ndeflated in the wake of Yosef's dreams, but it was also there that\nthey turned around and ended up condemning him to death. This is why\nYeravam ben Nevat established his breakaway monarchy there as well,\nwith the belief that the Northern Kingdom of Israel could exist\nindependent from Yehudah, Binyamin, and Yerushalayim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps Yaakov Avinu realized Yosef HaTzaddik exhibited the necessary inner strength to harness the power of the esteem-boost provided by Shechem, and would best use the potentially dangerous gift. Yosef showed profound self-restraint in the immorality of Mitzrayim regardless of being in the lowliest or highest of positions.</p>\n<p>A second answer <em>I think</em> I heard from Rabbi Frand is that Yaakov saw Yosef had the incredible bitachon/power to turn a painfully tragic situation into one of tremendous success - as evidenced through everything Yosef went through as a slave until becoming a leader of Mitzrayim while still holding steadfast to Hashem. Therefore, Yaakov wanted to give the tragedy-filled city of Shechem to the one person who personified transforming sadness into happiness.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Jew raised in a secular home wants to connect again, Switzerland\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a friend living in Switzerland whose mother was born Jewish and converted to Christianity. </p>\n\n<p>The short story. His grandfather got lost during the Holocaust, his grandmother went to Switzerland and married again a Swiss guy bringing in her three children, converted to Christianity and rised up their children under the new Swiss name (adoption). One of this children is his mother. Now you might understand that he lost kind of all connection to the Jewish culture ... but he wants more. He found out about his family history only at age 24, because he asked his mother why he feels so different to all the people around. She kept it secret for all his life; it hurt him much, and he feels separated now. </p>\n\n<p>In Switzerland there is a big Jewish community in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zürich</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bâle/Basel</a>, but mostly of them orthodox and very strict. Connecting to a rabbi there, not telling the whole story, but his intention to join the tribe, he received no feedback at all.</p>\n\n<p>What do you advise him? Considering knowledge is identity and culture, which sources for literature you would advise him to check out. Can a Jew be seperated but living Jewish only by connection to the writings of the tribe (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talmud</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tanakh</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah\" rel=\"nofollow\">Torah</a>)? Maybe you do know any people he can connect to in Switzerland in his situation? - At the moment, he feels separated from everything, the culture he grew up within and also the Jewish people. </p>\n\n<p>Please be aware that your suggestion might be adopted forming his future being. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>I don't have a lot of time now, but just a few thoughts:\nIf he presented himself to the Rabbi as a non-Jew looking to convert, I would expect a lukewarm response at best. This is because Judaism does not proselytize, and is not interested in accepting converts unless they are strongly motivated to join the Jewish people and accept all of the responsibilities that this entails. Thus, potential converts are traditionally turned away several times to ensure that they are sincere and determined to convert.</p>\n\n<p>However, if he goes back and explains that he is a Jew, because his mother is a Jew, and that he would very much like to learn more about Judaism and become a part of the Jewish community, he might receive a very different response.</p>\n\n<p>He is, by the way, 100% Jewish already. Judaism is determined by one's mother, not one's father or knowledge/practice.</p>\n\n<p>There is no shame in his background - on the contrary, he is a \"lost soul\" finding his way home, a small victory over Hitler and his attempt to eradicate the Jews.</p>\n\n<p>It is theoretically possible to \"live Jewish\" by oneself, but highly unpleasant, undesirable, and impractical. </p>\n\n<p>I'm sure that there is more than one Orthodox Rabbi in Switzerland, and even though all Orthodox Jews seem the same from the outside, there are actually differences between them (ideologically, lifestyle-wise, and personal personality differences). He can try contacting several Swiss Rabbis - hopefully even if some are less than supportive, others will be helpful. If he doesn't find the Jewish community in Switzerland to be receptive to him (and this would be a bad reflection on THEM, not on him) he should consider reaching out to Rabbis by e-mail or phone. There are Jews all over the world, not just in Switzerland, and in this age of instant communication, it shouldn't be too hard to connect to them.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, he could start with the following. Hopefully they would be able to direct him to more people/resources closer to home, and perhaps recommend some reading material.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Danny Kirsch\nThe Jewish Learning Exchange\n152 Golders Green Road\nLondon NW11 8HE\nTel: +44 (0)20 8458-4588\nFax: +44 (0)20 8458-4587\nE-mail: jle@jle.org.uk Home Page: www.jle.org.uk </p>\n\n<p>Here's the contact information for the Aish branch in Manchester, England: aishmanchester@aish.org.uk\nAish is a worldwide organization dedicated to helping Jews reconnect with their heritage.

I beg of him to find them - because we are here!</p>\n\n<p>-Rebbetzin HaQoton</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Your friend does not need to join the tribe, because he is already part of the Jewish people. </p>\n\n<p>I suggest that your friend read some introductory material to learn about Judaism. I am sure there are some good introductory books in German. The only good German books I know of are Horeb by Rabbi Shimshon Rafael Hirsch and 19 Letters, by the same author, but these are from the 19th century. Even so, they are very much worth reading. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, Chabad's website is a great source of introductory material. Here's their German website: <a href=\"http://www.de.chabad.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.de.chabad.org/</a> It's possible that the English website, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org</a>, has more material.</p>\n\n<p>Your friend should also attend Jewish community events and try to meet people there, including rabbis. For example, attend a purim party. Many such parties are open to the entire Jewish community and do not require synagogue membership. Keep in mind that Purim is a kind of unusual holiday and people act differently than they do year-round.</p>\n\n<p>Try meeting rabbis from various synagogues and attend services at several synagogues. Once you find one you like you might want to start attending regularly. I recommend only attending Orthodox synagogues, because non-Orthodox Judaism is a very recent breakaway from traditional Judaism and does not represent the ancestral heritage that your friend wants to re-connect with. Modern Orthodox or Chabad synagogues could be good choices, because they are Orthodox but tend to involve people who are less strict.</p>\n\n<p>Chabad has tons of experience with helping Jews who know little about Judaism re-connect to their heritage. Their mission is to help all Jews however they can, especially by helping them learn about Torah and mitzvos. Chabad tends to create a very relaxed atmosphere because they do not try to pressure anyone to do anything. They know that most people will not become just like them (with their style of dress, for example), and that is fine with them. But if your friend wanted extra help, for example if he wanted to meet with a Chabad rabbi each week to learn, the rabbi would most likely agree to do so. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the list of links to Chabad houses in Switzerland: <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/centers/default_cdo/country/Switzerland/jewish/Chabad-Lubavitch.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org/centers/default_cdo/country/Switzerland/jewish/Chabad-Lubavitch.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>I wish your friend much success in re-connecting to his people and heritage!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>To expand on Kordovero's answer, <a href=\"http://www.victorgoldschmidt.ch\">Victor Goldschmidt Verlag</a>, based in Bâle, has a decent catalogue of works on Judaism, including the above mentioned works of R' Hirsch as well as translations of the Torah, Siddur (Sefat Emet - Rödelheim and Schma Kolenu), Machzorim, and other assorted works. They also carry ritual items, although those should wait until your friend feels more comfortable and has found a rabbi with whom he feels comfortable.</p>\n\n<p>I would also advise that he learn what he can about his mother's Jewish heritage, as it may help in his search for a community. If he is in the Francophone region, I would advise also contacting some of the French communities (mainly in Alsace-Lorraine and Paris, as far as I'm aware). </p>\n\n<p>Bonne chance à votre ami!</p>\n\n\n",

He was not himself a Tanna.  Baraisas that went through the academy of R' Chiya were assumed to be authoritative.  However, if R' Chiya taught something which had no reference or hint to it in the Mishna, it is assumed that it is a mistake.  R' Chiya is not talking on his own authority, and therefore when his Baraisa is seemingly corrupted, it is worse than even just the statement of an Amora.</p>\n\n<p>Tosefos in Niddah 62b says that this rule only applies when it is clear that the point of the Baraisa is not hinted to in the Mishna.

I have always had an interest in my father's religion, even though he was non-practicing.

When she sold her flat, she left her Mezuzah. The flat is now rented by a non-Jewish couple. I called her and asked whether I could take the Mezuzah and hang it on my door. I have recently been diagnosed with a chronic disease, and rightly or wrongly she said \"yes\", as she felt I was in need.</p>\n\n<p>I followed the rules very strictly when hanging the Mezuzah. However my next door neighbour, who is also Jewish, told me I was \"breaking the rules\".  </p>\n\n<p>I did not do this for fun. I take things like this very seriously. It means a great deal to me to have a Mezuzah on my door, I understand a little of the meaning, and was given this by someone who cares about me.</p>\n\n<p>Have I done anything wrong according to the law? </p>\n\n<p>Very many thanks.

Fatty, greasy cheese and cheese that has developed holes would both qualify as ‘hard’ (See Taz and Aruch HaShulchan YD 89:11). The Shach (YD 89:15) writes that cheese that has aged for 6 months, such as ‘swiss cheese’ (Taz 89:4) generally qualifies as hard cheese.  While some measure the 6 months from the time of production, R’ Yisroel Belsky maintains that the cheese only matures while in the factory, before it is packaged. Mild cheddar is typically a couple of months old, though mature cheddar is often older than 6 months.</p>\n<p>R’ Aharon Kotler held (Ohr Yisroel 6:p89) that only cheese which needs a sharp grater to cut up is considered ‘hard.’ Following this, R’ Moshe Heinemann classes parmesan cheese as one of the few ‘hard cheeses’. R’ Moshe Feinstein (Mishneh Halachos 16:9) and the Chazon Ish (Maaseh Ish 5:p22) likewise, held rather leniently.</p>\n<p>The Yad Yehuda (89:26) writes that if hard cheese is used in baking, it loses its ‘hard cheese’ status when it melts. R’ Yosef Shalom Elyashiv (Kovetz Teshuvos 1:582) disagrees, however, as melting the cheese doesn’t change its taste.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Questions on judaism.stackexchange.com often stand out because of its rich and --to me as an outsider-- exotic vocabulary, as well as the almost surreal --to me at least-- problems that seem to arise in day-to-day Jewish life.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the question I viewed a few minutes earlier titled <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/52781/8746\"><em>What defines “hard cheese”</em></a>, which seemed to have arisen from the <em>minhag that after \"hard cheese\", one must wait for 15 minutes before one may eat meat</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Let me be clear that I have no intention whatsoever of questioning anyone's faith, in God or otherwise, or making any related value judgments. Rather, I can't help but wishing to understand, at least on a rudimentary level, what thought-processes tend to drive the faithful followers of the doctrine/customs/tradition of a religion such as yours.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, I wonder about the answers to such questions as \"Why does God care if the cheese I consumed was hard or soft? Why does it matter to Him whether there was 14 or 15 minutes in-between hard cheese eating and meat eating? Why is this so important to Him?\"</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, is there any form of consensus in the Jewish community on how such questions should be resolved?</p>\n\n\n",

B&H has been successfully sued several times for discriminating against non-Jewish employees, including for paying them less than Jewish employees, and blocking them from management positions.  In the article, Rabbi Daniel Lapin, who is an Orthodox rabbi and an author of several Jewish business books is quoted in the article as saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lapin maintains that none of the aforementioned allegations undermine B&H’s integrity. “Where in the Torah does it say that you have to pay all employees the same rate? Where in the Torah is equality depicted as a virtue?

It may not be fair, it may not be legal, those are not my areas. But to say that there is a clash with Jewish values simply would not be true,” said Lapin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is Lapin's view correct? <strong>Excluding <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dina_d%27malkhuta_dina\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>dina d'malchuta</em></a> issues</strong>, is it correct that there is no moral problem in Judaism with workplace discrimination?

They often have a certificate declaring the legitimacy of their cause (although people don't necessarily recognise the names of the Rabbis/institutions that sign the approbation).</p>\n\n<p>Some people give more freely which is perhaps a middat chassidut; or perhaps people are uncomfortable questioning the status of such a person and give minimally in any case. However, some feel it is necessary to scrutinise the collectors' certificates, reading if indeed their cause is something that they would like to support or whether it is a reliable certificate (in date, etc.). This could be embarrassing for the collector, that someone is 'evaluating whether they are worthy' to receive charity.</p>\n\n<p>To what extent is one allowed to scrutinise a collector's legitimacy and cause before giving them money? Is there ever an assumption/clause that defines them as legitimate without the need for in depth investigation?</p>\n\n<p>An extreme example being: After someone had enquired of a collector, in a synagogue I attended, it became apparent that the collector was collecting in order to fix his roof...</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This is a very interesting and difficult question not addressed directly by any of the many sources I consulted. So here are a few relevant sources I collected on the topic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It emerges that you do not have an obligation to research the credentials of a random collector, neither are you obligated to give him much.

In practical terms the minimal gift is the smallest coin which can buy some food item in the market, in the US 25 cents is acceptable, some say even a dime. In Israel R Y Fisher from Badatz ruled 10 agorot is the minimal gift.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is further restricted in situations where many beggars congregate in the same place</strong> (e.g., synagogue, wedding). R Chaim Ozer Grozensky, R Yaakov Yisrael Kanievski (the Steipler) and R Chaim Kanievski are quoted to say that is simply impossible to give everyone in a place where many ask as it becomes <em>ein ladavar sof</em>, a never-ending collection, although for them the rationale is that it becomes too large of a gift for which the donor is exempt.</p>\n\n<p>R Avrohom Chaim Feuer writes </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a peremptory perusal of the documents displayed by the random\n  collector is quite sufficient. It is not necessary to carefully\n  research the letters of recommendation and credentials because it is\n  beyond the ability of most people to properly verify these documents\n  and the halacha doesn't require it from them. As stated above,the\n  halacha is \"one who collects from door to door - give him a minimum\n  token donation\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea is of course to be able to channel his tzedaka funds to <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2010/08/12/laws-of-tzedakah-part-ii-who-to-give-first/\">sources of higher priority</a> or ones we prefer, not to donate less.</p>\n\n<p>Sources for many of these are in</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578195145.html\">The tzedakah treasury</a> by R Avrohom Chaim Feuer</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578195893.html\">The laws of tzedakah and maaser</a> by R Shimon Taub</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>both highly recommended for those interested in the topic</p>\n\n\n",

What problem could there be in attaching those strings to my <em>tzitzis</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 34)\n\n<p>You ask, \"let's say that Murex is not the chilazon, and we have some strings that have been dyed blue for <em>no reason</em>. What's the problem with that?\" (<em>my emphasis</em>)</p>\n\n<p>If there really is <strong>no</strong> reason to dye them blue whatsoever, then doing so would be a violation of the Shulchan Aruch (9:5), who says that careful people use strings of the same color as the garment, and we use a white garment, and the Rama there who notes that the custom is to use white (this is pointed out by R. Elyashiv in his collected teshuvos, 1:2). While the Chazon Ish (3:25) and the Radziner Rebbe (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34404&st=&pgnum=166\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ein HaTecheiles 1:40:1</a>) don't think that this applies to all of the strings, many poskim seem to assume that all four strings should be white, in the absence of techeiles.</p>\n\n<p>This stringency, however, would not be enough of a reason to say not to use techeiles if there's any reason at all to assume that it might be correct.</p>\n\n<p>Let's assume, then, that it's a matter of doubt, and (the assumption is) that one should be stringent as ספק דאורייתא לחומרא. Why not dye them with the new blue? </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>A halachik reason: Many (including R. Moshe Shternbach, Teshuvos V'Hanhagos 1:26 and 4:5) have written that placing something extra on tzitzis with the intent to possibly perform a mitzvah, even out of doubt, is violating the prohibition of bal tosif. (This is the indication of the Gemara in Zevachim 81a, and though the Ritva Sukkah 31b says otherwise, there were many poskim throughout history on both sides of this question).</p></li>\n<li><p>A kabbalistic reason: There are apparently kabbalistic reasons to avoid using real techeiles strings nowadays anyway, which was the objection of R. <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0020_0_20068.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yisrael Yehoshua Trunk</a> (Shu\"t Yeshuos Malko O.C. 1-3). (It's hard for this to be understood literally as Kabbalah can't uproot a biblical obligation. Rav Asher Weiss suggests the intention might be more along the lines of: kabbalah tells us that the true techeiles has been lost and so anyone who thinks they are wearing it nowadays must be donning a spiritually destructive fake.)</p></li>\n<li><p>A meta-halachik reason: I've been told by a posek that he was worried that if we come to dye them blue from the murex out of doubt, then future generations might mistakenly believe that there's a tradition that this is the proper chilazon. This is problematic because (1) it is a 'ziyuf hatorah', a misrepresentation of the Torah, which the Maharshal (Yam Shel Shelomo B.K. 4:9) thinks is so terrible as to be worth dying for (2) if Eliyahu does come and provides us with a different snail, things could get very awkward and we might not know what to do.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you are going to wear it in public, then we can add that R. Shternbach (ibid.) prohibits wearing blue tzitzis in public because of the prohbition of 'lo tisgodedu', of making apparent divisions in halakhic practice among different people.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the assumption above that there is a formal halachik doubt here is debatable as well. R. Shternbach (ibid.) writes that something without a tradition cannot even be considered a safek. Also, R. Soloveitchik (Shiurim L'Zecher Abba Mori, pg 228) as well as several others quote the Beis Halevi (though <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/8363/\">there is some debate</a> if he actually said this) as saying that something that has been lost to tradition is equivalent to a tradition that something has been lost; meaning, it's as if there's a mesorah <em>not to use anything as blue</em> until Eliyahu or the like can reinstate it from their own mesorah, not just from arguments.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, it isn't at all true that the evidence is 'compelling' to everyone that the murex trunculus is the correct fish for dying techeiles. There are good answers to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7554/why-is-techeles-not-universally-accepted/8363\">this question</a>, both in terms of archaeological evidence and halakhic literature regarding the identity of the <em>chilazon.</em> Rav Asher Weiss and <a href=\"http://kollel.com/sites/default/files/rav_miller_shiurim/RSM-Techeilis-all.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Shlomo Miller</a>, both widely accepted poskim, do not think that there is enough evidence to even raise a doubt, and discourage the use of techeiles (without really providing an answer to this question). For many people, the fact that these poskim are unconvinced is enough of a reason not to view it as a doubt. (The list of poskim that have discouraged it extends far beyond these, though of course it isn't unanimous, and those who do wear techeiles have answers to the above issues. You asked about the potential downsides).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Heinemann says that there is a problem of the curse brought in the Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.61b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baba Metzia 61b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבא למה לי דכתב רחמנא יציאת מצרים ברבית יציאת מצרים גבי ציצית יציאת מצרים במשקלות אמר הקב\"ה אני הוא שהבחנתי במצרים בין טפה של בכור לטפה שאינה של בכור אני הוא שעתיד ליפרע ממי שתולה מעותיו בנכרי ומלוה אותם לישראל ברבית וממי שטומן משקלותיו במלח וממי שתולה קלא אילן בבגדו ואומר תכלת הוא</p>\n<p>Rava says: Why do I need the mention of the exodus from Egypt that the Merciful One wrote in the context of the halakhot of the prohibition against interest (see Leviticus 25:37–38), and the mention of the exodus from Egypt with regard to the mitzva to wear ritual fringes (see Numbers 15:39–41), and the mention of the exodus from Egypt in the context of the prohibition concerning weights (see Leviticus 19:35–36)? Rava explains: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I am He Who distinguished in Egypt between the drop of seed that became a firstborn and the drop of seed that did not become a firstborn, and I killed only the firstborn. I am also He Who is destined to exact punishment from one who attributes ownership of his money to a gentile and thereby lends it to a Jew with interest. Even if he is successful in deceiving the court, God knows the truth. And I am also He Who is destined to exact punishment from one who buries his weights in salt, as this changes their weight in a manner not visible to the eye. And I am also He Who is destined to exact punishment from one who hangs ritual fringes dyed with indigo [kala ilan] dye on his garment and says it is dyed with the sky-blue dye required in ritual fringes. The allusion to God’s ability to distinguish between two apparently like entities is why the exodus is mentioned in all of these contexts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even though the Gemara is clearly saying that this is on one who comes to trick people, Rav Heinemann applies the rule of קללת חכם אפילו על תנאי היא באה, the curse of a Sage, even if it is stated conditionally, it comes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Makkot.11a.21?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkos 11a</a>).</p>\n<p><del>Note that this problem is only if Murex indigo is included in the category of kala ilan. This is arguable. If we take kala ilan to be the name of the indigo plant and not the dye produced from it, we can say definitively that the Murex is not that plant. I think this is the reason no one else has brought up this issue.</del></p>\n<p>I had understood that only actual kala ilan was included in the curse, but in a question and answer session <a href=\"http://podcast.headlinesbook.com/e/6521/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (1:07-1:09) Rav Heinemann says that even if it is not kala ilan, if it is not certainly techales, the curse applies. (He seems to apply this even to what in fact is techales if one doesn't know that with certainty. I don't know how he includes that in the curse, this not being kala ilan in any sense.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To defend the second answer of MichoelR, that a layman should not wear techales when he sees that his Rabbanim do not, this is clearly spelled out in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Berurah.63.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Brura (63:6)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתב ביש\"ש פ\"ז דב\"ק סימן מ\"א מי שמחמיר ... ואפילו אם אינו פשוט כ\"כ להתיר לא יחמיר נגד דברי רבו אם לא שיש לו ראיה לסתור דבריו עכ\"ל:</p>\n<p>Someone who is stringent ... even if it is not so clear to permit (or require) the act, one should not be stringent against the word of his Rabbi unless he has a proof to contradict his word.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(My adding the case of some positive act being required is based upon the context where the Mishna Brura brings this.)</p>\n<p>This is not like the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/94587/19563\">case</a> of where one's Rabbi does not wear tefilin, brought in the comments on that answer. (I kid you not; that is the case there.) There it should be clear to everyone that every person must wear tefilin. Here it is not clear to people that Murex dye is techales, so one who does not posses the proofs to that effect should not be stringent against the word of his Rabbi.</p>\n\n\n",

Customs relating to \"fence\" prohibitions can never be undone (as Rebbi Yochanan told the people of Bishan in Pesachim 50b) but other customs can be permitted by <em>hatarat nedarim</em> (YD 214.2, 228.25-26). Rav Moshe (OC 2.21) does not consider a negative minhag binding - you don't say, \"Well, we never did that before.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>The basic structure of the blessings which comprise <em>tefila</em> are <em>matbea sh'tavau Chachamim</em>, the way the Sages put it together. You can't change these parts (Brachot 11a, 40b) - but the definition of \"change\" requires clarification:</p></li>\n<li><p>The Shulchan Aruch (OC 68.1) holds like Rashi and Rambam that you cannot add anything to the received text, but the Rema holds like Rabbeinu Tam, Rabbeinu Yona, and Rashba that you can add (but not subtract - you must keep the content of the blessing plus the ending). The Mishna Brura, Aruch HaShulchan, and Shulchan Aruch HaRav all agree this is the Ashkenazi custom, and while they note the Arizal did not say <em>piyyutim</em> which were not authored by extremely ancient authorities, his student Rav Chaim Vital said the traditional <em>nusach</em> when leading Rosh Hashana/Yom Kippur (i.e. with all the familiar <em>piyuttim</em>). They mention that this is in reference to the <em>brachot</em> on <em>Shema</em>, but adding to the chazan's repetition is anyhow more lenient because an individual can add his own words to each blessing as appropriate.</p></li>\n<li><p>According to this, the sections of <em>tefila</em> which are clearly from the Sages are: <em>baruch sh'amar/pesukei d'zimra/yishtabach</em>, the blessings before and after Shema, and the <em>amidah</em>. <em>Baruch sh'amar/pesukei d'zimra/yishtabach</em> must be recited first or the blessings cannot be made (OC 52). Shema and its blessings should be recited before <em>amidah</em> in <em>shacharit</em> (OC 58).</p></li>\n<li><p>The Magen Avraham (OC 68) quotes the Arizal there were 12 original <em>nusachot</em> of <em>tefila</em>, one for each tribe, corresponding to 12 gates in Heaven, and they are therefore equally valid. Rav Moshe (OC 2.24) agrees with the Chatam Sofer (I.16) who does not like the claim that <em>nusach Sfarad</em> (or <em>nusach Arizal</em>) is the <em>sha'ar hakolel</em> which anyone can use, and therefore holds it is permitted to switch from <em>nusach Sfarad</em> back to <em>nusach Ashkenaz</em> but not any other way; however the Chatam Sofer's reasoning in Rav Moshe's understanding would seem to indicate that all <em>nusachot</em> we have may really be the same <em>nusach</em> since they share the same fundamental structure, in which case as above it is not clear there is any problem in switching. In any case, <em>hatarat nedarim</em> would seem to be sufficient to switch.</p></li>\n<li><p>Rav Moshe Shternbuch (I.160) says that finding a <em>tefila</em> which inspires you overrides the usual rule of <em>b'rov am hadrat melech</em> (\"multitudes of people are the glory of the King\") which obligates one to join the largest available <em>minyan</em>, since the essential goal of <em>tefila</em> is <em>kavana</em> (\"intent\" or \"concentration\"). It seems obvious that since adding liturgy is permitted, if doing so will increase <em>kavana</em>, it is a good idea.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>TL;DR: If you are Ashkenazi, you can add, but not subtract from the core parts of <em>tefila</em>. While major authorities used this power with reserve, it is fundamentally allowed. If you are Sefaradi, you should play it straight and stop causing trouble.</p>\n\n\n",

The Maharal explains that this is because a person is defined by speech, as Onkelos translates ויהי האדם לנפש חיה, Man became a living being, as רוח ממללא, a speaking being.  Man is defined by the intersect between the intellect and the body, which is exemplified in the bringing out of the thought into speech, which requires the combination of intellect and action (this is expanded in Gevuros Hashem ch. 28). The intellect, and therefore thought, is not <em>really</em> part of the person (this is expanded on in ch. 9), and therefore involvement in Torah in thought is not <em>really</em> the person himself being involved.  It is only through speech that the person is considered to himself be involved in Torah.</p>\n\n<p>The Maharal does not explicitly say that this is not considered Talmud Torah, but the implication of not requiring the Birkas haTorah implies that this is not a fulfillment of the mitzvah of Talmud Torah. </p>\n\n\n",

(If I recall there was some fellow who begged the local rabbinate to impose protectionism against a new competitor of his; the rabbinate replied that their attitude until then had been laissez faire; if they were to step in, then they would also enforce the policy of maximum margins, as well as demanding to see his books to determine that in fact the upstart was impinging on his livelihood. </p>\n\n<p>There's an mp3 where Rabbi Yitzchak Breitowitz acknowledges that other than the 100%-on-food comment, there's not traditionally a lot in the literature about this. <em>Ona'ah</em> is the prohibition of mis-representing the going market rate for a product, assuming there is one. (He admitted that by that definition, if several sellers colluded to raise the market rate, there would be a new market rate and ona'ah wouldn't apply.) We're dealing with much bigger businesses than those in Talmudic times; thus, some local rabbinates will choose to apply other controls in the best interest of consumers.</p>\n\n<p>We also have the Gemara in Pesachim where there was a town whose practice was to buy new clay pots after Pesach (as the chametz pots were deemed not kosher). The new rabbi in town told the pottery sellers that if they marked up their prices, he would respond with halachic policy by pronouncing that the buy-new-pots practice wasn't necessary. (Similarly, it's said that ... was it the Baal Shem Tov or the Baal HaTanya? told his followers to stop buying fish before Shabbos, as the fishmongers were making the Friday prices far too high.)</p>\n\n\n",

Dov Berish Weidenfeld, who was the Tshebiner Rav and author of Dovev Meisharim, ruled that freezing water to make ice cubes on Shabbos is not permitted due to the prohibition of molid (creating a new entity), or nolad (benefitting from something that came into existence on Shabbos). Other poskim argue that it might be similar to the melachah of boneh (using existing ingredients to construct something).</p>\n\n<p>However, the majority of poskim rejected both these positions, and ruled that making ice cubes on Shabbos is permitted, provided they are intended for use on Shabbos. In a case where there is a tzorech (need), there is even more room for leniency, as the Rama tends to be lenient regarding similar aspects of nolad on Shabbos and Yom Tov if there is a tzorech. Obviously, this discussion doesn’t refer to an automatic ice-maker which is forbidden to be used on Shabbos and Yom Tov. </p>\n\n<p>בסוגיא זו דנו כו״כ אחרונים מכמה צדדים. ואא״פ להעתיק כל המובא בעניננו, כי האר״ש רחבת ידים היא, ואין לנו אלא לצטט עיקרי הדברים, וראיתם את האר״ש מה היא, כי מציו״ן תצא תורה, בספרי המלקטים שבנו אצלם ציו״ן המצויינת. </p>\n\n<p>ונקודת הדברים, שכשאינו מרסק בידים והוא נימוח מאליו, קייל״ן (רמ״א סשי״ח סט״ז. אדה״ז שם סכ״ז) שבמקום הצורך אפי׳ לכתחילה יש להקל.</p>\n\n<p>ובפי׳ צורך כאן – כ׳ הלבוש ״צורך אורחין וכה״ג״. ולכאו׳ כל שהוא צורך שבת – ג״ז בכלל. וכ״ה להדיא במשנ״ב בשעה״צ ס״ק קלג. וכ״כ בשו״ת צי״א ח״ו סל״ד סקי״א (לעניננו – הקפאת נוזלים). ואילה״ק שלפ״ז הכל בכלל, ומהו פשר ד׳ הרמ״א (שם סט״ז) שנהגו להחמיר – שהרי יל״פ באופן שיש לו מאכלים שנימוחו כבר. וגם פשטות ד׳ הרמ״א מיירי גם בדברים שאינם אוכלים, ואי״ב משום עונג וצורך שבת.

In our case where delaying Shema until he can recite the blessings will <em>certainly</em> make him miss the time, <em>a fortiori</em> he should recite Shema without worrying about the blessings.

I think the Rishonim and others may differ on that opinion, as well as when the zman actually is, but I think in general this is the accepted procedure.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, if it's a weekday he should also wear Tefillin whilst reciting Shacharit (brachas before and after Shema, Amidah and if said that day Tachanun). Possibly, if rushed, he might not have time to put Tefillin on before the z'man.</p>\n\n<p>The 3rd hour is the proper time by which to say Shema but the 4th hour will suffice for the purpose of b'rachot (and some allow 6 or even all day according to Rambam but only in times of Ones).</p>\n\n\n",

This forms the main body of his commentary, will only occasional digressions to bring in salient points from other sources.</p>\n<p>The citation from the Sifrei in question reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וידבר ה' אל משה בעצם היום הזה: בשלשה מקומות נאמר בעצם היום הזה, נאמר בנח (שם ז, יג) בעצם היום הזה בא נח וגו', במראית אורו של יום, לפי שהיו בני דורו אומרים בכך וכך אם אנו מרגישין בו אין אנו מניחין אותו ליכנס בתיבה, ולא עוד אלא אנו נוטלין כשילין וקרדומות ומבקעין את התיבה. אמר הקב\"ה הריני מכניסו בחצי היום, וכל מי שיש בידו כח למחות יבא וימחה. במצרים נאמר (שמות יב, נא) בעצם היום הזה הוציא ה', לפי שהיו מצרים אומרים בכך וכך אם אנו מרגישין בהם אין אנו מניחים אותם לצאת, ולא עוד אלא אנו נוטלין סייפות וכלי זיין והורגין בהם. אמר הקב\"ה הריני מוציאן בחצי היום וכל מי שיש בו כח למחות יבא וימחה. אף כאן במיתתו של משה נאמר בעצם היום הזה, לפי שהיו ישראל אומרים בכך וכך אם אנו מרגישין בו אין אנו מניחין אותו, אדם שהוציאנו ממצרים וקרע לנו את הים והוריד לנו את המן והגיז לנו את השליו והעלה לנו את הבאר ונתן לנו את התורה אין אנו מניחין אותו. אמר הקב\"ה הריני מכניסו בחצי היום וכו':</p>\n<p>And the Lord spoke to Moses on that very day: Heb. בְּעֶצֶם הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה. In three places Scripture employs the phrase: בְּעֶצֶם הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה [which has the meaning, “at the strongest light of the day”]. First, regarding Noah, Scripture states,“On that very day (בְּעֶצֶם הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה) Noah entered [… the ark]” (Gen. 7:13), which means in the glare of full daylight. Noah’s contemporaries said: “We swear by such and such, that if we notice him about to enter the ark, we will not let him proceed! Moreover, we will take axes and hatchets and split open the ark!” So the Holy One, Blessed is He, said: “I will have Noah enter at midday, and let anyone who has the power to prevent it, come and prevent it!” Second, regarding Egypt, Scripture states, “On that very day, the Lord brought [the children of Israel] out [of the land of Egypt]” (Exod. 12:51). The Egyptians said: “We swear by such and such, that if we notice them about to leave, we will stop them! And not only that, but we will take swords and other weapons, and kill them!” So, the Holy One, Blessed is He, said: “I will bring them out in the middle of the day, and let anyone who has power to prevent it, come and prevent it!” Likewise here, regarding Moses’ death, Scripture states,“on that very day (בְּעֶצֶם הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה) .” The children of Israel said, “We swear by such and such, that if we notice Moses [ascending the mountain to die], we will not let him do so! The man who brought us out of Egypt, divided the Red Sea for us, brought the manna down for us, made flocks of quails fly over to us, brought up the well for us, and gave us the Torah-we will not let him!” Thereupon, the Holy One, Blessed is He, said: “I will have Moses ascend the mountain [to his resting place] in the middle of the day!” - [Sifrei 32:47]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It appears in Sifrei on this verse at the end of Haazinu (in Sefer Devarim), but serves to analyze three pesukim throughout Torah which contain this phrase -- one in parashat Noach (sefer Bereishit), one in Bo (sefer Shemot), and one in Haazinu. And Rashi cites the local midrash on the local verse.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in parashat Bo in Shemot, Rashi cites from his go-to midrash for Sefer Shemot, the Mechilta, and writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויהי מקץ שלשים שנה וגו' ויהי בעצם היום הזה: מגיד שכיון שהגיע הקץ לא עכבן המקום כהרף עין, בחמישה עשר בניסן באו מלאכי השרת אצל אברהם לבשרו, בחמישה עשר בניסן נולד יצחק, ובחמישה עשר בניסן נגזרה גזירת בין הבתרים:</p>\n<p>It came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, and it came to pass in that very day: [This] tells [us] that as soon as the end [of this period] arrived, the Omnipresent did not keep them [even] as long as the blink of an eye. On the fifteenth of Nissan, the angels came to Abraham to bring him tidings. On the fifteenth of Nissan Isaac was born; on the fifteenth of Nissan the decree of “between the parts” was decreed. — [from Mechilta]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To restate your question with this new information, you are asking why, if Rashi finds the midrash in the Sifrei relevant to Devarim, and that Sifrei is also commentary on the pasuk in parashat Bo, then why does Rashi in parashat Bo not make use of the same midrash and the same explanation of the phrase?</p>\n<p>And, I think the answer is that Rashi does not see the need to be consistent and always proffer the same consistent explanation across Tanach. Rather, his aim is to present a midrashically grounded traditional approach that explains salient points of the text, and particularly those which address issues of peshat or make sense of irregular phrases in a way that works well in the overarching context. In order to do this, he reworks classical works of midrash.</p>\n<p>Here, local to parashat Bo, he already had a midrash from the Mechilta which addressed the phrase בעצם היום הזה, and one which fit into his framework of other midrashim from the Mechilta. He therefore had no need to look for a non-local midrash to explain the phrase. This even though he used that non-local midrash elsewhere, in a place where it was, in turn, local.</p>\n<p>Note: I think the above answer is correct and answers not just this question but a plethora of other questions. However, an interesting related question is why, in parashat Noach, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8170#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> turned to this Sifrei and not to the parallel midrash (with the same idea as presented in the Sifrei) from <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&mefaresh=raba&perek=7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit Rabba</a>:</p>\n<p>בעצם היום הזה בא נח\nאמר רבי יוחנן,\nאמר הקדוש ברוך הוא: אם נכנס נח לתיבה בלילה, עכשיו יהיו כל דורו אומרים כך: לא היינו יודעים בו, ואלו היינו יודעים בו, לא היינו מניחין אותו ליכנס! אלא בעצם היום הזה בא נח, דרגיש ליה ימלל.</p>\n\n\n",

Can he be traced to Aaron? Was he related to Zadok?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Aviatar (or Abiather) was descended from Eli the prophet who was also a Kohen Gadol before him.</p>\n\n<p>The lineage from the book of Shmuel is: Eli->Pinchas->Achituv->Achimelech->Aviatar.</p>\n\n<p>Do not confuse the fact that there is also an Achituv in the line down to Tzadok (book of Ezra that traces his lineage as well as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chronicles 5:30 - Eleazar begot Phinehas, Phinehas begot Abishua; 31\n  and Abishua begot Bukki, and Bukki begot Uzzi; 32 and Uzzi begot\n  Zerahiah, and Zerahiah begot Meraioth; 33 Meraioth begot Amariah(I), and\n  Amariah(I) begot Ahitub(I); 34 and Ahitub(I) begot Zadok(I) and Zadok(I) begot Ahimaaz; \n  35 and Ahimaaz begot Azariah(I), and Azariah(I) begot Johanan; 36 and Johanan begot Azariah (II)—he it is that executed the priest’s office in the house that Solomon built in Jerusalem—: 37 and Azariah(II) begot Amariah(II), and Amariah(II) begot Ahitub(II); 38 and Ahitub(II) begot Zadok(II), </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The text seems rather strange as there are 4 generations between Zadok (I) and Azariah (II) that is the one claimed to have executed the office in the Temple. And then there are 3 more generations to Zadok (II). And is the text here to indicate that the first Azariah (2 generations before) did not execute the Priest's office (Kohen Gadol) </p>\n\n<p>Chronicles (I) chapter 24 describes how the Kohen Gadol role was shared for a period between the sons of Elazar and the sons of Ithamar. And also that Ahimelech and others were clearly from the line of Ithamar:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I Chronicles Chapter 24 1 And the courses of the sons of Aaron were\n  these. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 2 But\n  Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children;\n  therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office. <strong>3 And\n  David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of\n  Ithamar</strong>, divided them according to their ordering in their service. 4\n  And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the\n  sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided: of the sons of Eleazar\n  there were sixteen, heads of fathers’houses; and of the sons of\n  Ithamar, according to their fathers’houses, eight. 5 Thus were they\n  divided by lot, one sort with another; for they were princes of the\n  sanctuary and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the\n  sons of Ithamar. 6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who\n  was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the\n  princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and\n  the heads of the fathers’houses of the priests and of the Levites: one\n  father’s house being taken for Eleazar, and proportionately for\n  Ithamar</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ahimelech there is listed as a son of Aviatar, not his father, and we know Aviatar had a son called Jonathan but may have also had a son called Ahimelech.</p>\n\n<p>Of course being Kohanim they were both descended from Aharon. Eli was actually descended from Aharon's 4th son Ithamar (Chronicles). The line of Eliezer / Pinchas became unworthy after a period and therefore the title of Kohen Gadol which isn't guaranteed to be passed from father to son.</p>\n\n<p>In the book of Shmuel, there is a curse placed on Eli and all his descendents, and bad things start to happen to them, including the destruction of the whole town of Nov, from which Aviatar is the only survivor.</p>\n\n<p>In the book of Kings when Solomon sends Aviatar back to his home town there is a pasuk that tells how the curse of Eli was now fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the lineage from Pinchas (ben Elazar) down to Ezra might not be complete, i.e. he may have missed out some of the names in between. I read in a commentary that there were some gaps at the point where the less worthy Kohanim were.</p>\n\n\n",

This is especially true when the person is a guest coming for a Bar Mitzvah occasion. The gabbai feels that he has to give certain people the honor of Hagbah.</p>\n<p>In many cases, the person directly tells the gabbai that he’s not confident he’ll do Hagbah correctly, but the Gabbai assures him that people will help him. I watch and instruct, but if the person hasn't done it before, he'll just pick up the Torah completely closed and sit back down.</p>\n<p>I don't think it's a problem retroactively if the Gabbai didn’t think this would happen. However, if the Gabbai knows in advance that such people won’t properly display the writing when doing Hagbah, is he halachically allowed to invited them to do so regardless?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>It is halachically forbidden for the gabbai to honor an individual with Hagbah if he knows he will not be able to do it properly. It is imperative that the congregation be able to see the writing in the Sefer Torah well, and therefore the Torah must be opened enough and for long enough to see the writing in the Torah. If the person being called up is unaware of how to do Hagbah properly, he should be shown how to do so prior to being called up. If he is not confident he can do it properly, someone who is prepared to do Hagbah properly should receive the Hagbah. If it is difficult for a person, or he is physically incapable of doing Hagbah properly, it is forbidden to give him the Aliyah.</p>\n\n<p>This teaching is based on the Sha'arei Ephraim (Rav Ephraim Zalman Margolis) and is quoted in the \"Mishna B'rura\" (Siman 147, S\"K 7).</p>\n\n<p>The below is a translation from the \"Sha'arei Ephraim\" on this matter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The gabbai is not allowed to honor with the mitzva of hagbah someone who has very shaky hands or an elderly person or a weak person, for whom it is known that he will pick it up in such a manner so that he can sit down immediately, for he cannot lift the Torah with strength for a period of time facing the congregation so that they could take a good look as a result of him turning around slowly. Also, the person himself should avoid doing Hagbah, since he is unable to fulfill the mitzva as it was instituted, and Chazal were very strict about this that the mitzvos be done by someone who is able to fulfill it as it was instituted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35730&st=&pgnum=287\">Sha'arei Ephraim 10:14</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואין הסגן רשאי לכבד עם מצות הגבהה למי שידיו רותתין הרבה או לזקן ותש כח שידוע שהוא מגביהו לשבת מיד כי לא בכח יגבר להחזיקה זמן מה כלפי העם שיוכלו להסתכל  היטב ע\"י שהוא פונה לסובב בנחת וגם האיש ההוא ימנע נפשו מזה אחרי שא\"א לו לעשות המצוה כתיקונה וחז\"ל החמירו בזה מוטב שתעשה המצוה ע\"י מי שיש סיפוק בידו לעשותה כתיקנה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%9E%D7%96\">Mishna Berura 147:7</a> follows this ruling:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאין הסגן רשאי לכבד במצות הגבהה למי שידיו רותתין הרבה או לזקן ותש כח שידוע שהוא מגביהו לשבת מיד כי אין לו כח להחזיקה זמן מה כלפי העם שיוכלו להסתכל היטב וגם האיש ההוא צריך למנוע נפשו מזה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Naturally, if this assumption is false, the entirety of this answer would fall off...</p>\n\n<p>With that being said we have to figure out what's enhancing what. In other words, is the cookie enhancing the cream, cream enhancing the cookie, or neither? Believe it or not, this is generally subjective. In other words, we ask the person why he's eating it.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I would say that for me the cream is enhancing the cookie. I really want to eat a cookie, but without the cream it would be pretty bland and dry. However, I could imagine that there are others out there (as you allude to in your question) that think otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Once that's determined, we get to the Halacha part. Because the cookie is Mezonos (and is used in a significant way) it gets a bracha either way. So:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If the cream is enhancing the cookie, it's simply Mezonos.</li>\n<li>If the cookie is enhancing the cream, it would require 2 brachos.</li>\n<li>If neither is enhancing the other, it would also require 2 brachos.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All of the above applies to the case where the cookie is eaten as it is sold. However, if you were to go ahead and separate it, both components would require their own separate bracha. This is once again true due to the underlying assumption that this is a \"enhancing\" type Ikar V'tafel (if it would be a mixture, it would be a Machlokes if you separate it, IIRC)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Question about Shemitah years etc\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>20/01/15  Trying to find out- --I know a \"shemitah\" is a 7 yr. period. What confuses me is this: how do we know what specific years are the \"shemitah\" (e.g. Sept./07 to Sept./14\nor Sept./08 to Sept./15. Then, is a \"shemitah year\" the 7th year of a \"shemitah\" or is it\nthe 8th year - e.g. the first year AFTER a \"shemitah\"?  I thought a \"shemitah year\" is the 7th year- e.g. Sept./13 to Sept./14. So then what year is the Jubilee year (This now being 50 years since the last Jubilee)- is it 2014-2015 or sept./15-Sept./16 ??\n  I'm trying to nail down exactly (Gregorian) what are the 7 year periods*, the shemitah year, and the Jubilee year.  ---*I mean what year is the first year and what year is the 7th year (7th year being 2013 to 2014  OR 2014 to 2015, and is 2015 0r 2016 the Jubilee year. Know what I mean?  ----T Y V M</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Sabbatical year, \"sh'viis\" begins at Rosh Hashanah and actually occurs in years divisible by 7, such as the current year 5775. This isn't because they are counted since creation, but there was a tradition passed down since the time the 2nd Temple was destroyed as to when this year was.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that during the Temple period the cycle was still used to determine years of Maaseh Sheini etc.</p>\n\n<p>The actual regulations are a bit more complex. There are 3 issues: produce from the ground, produce from trees and recovery of debt. Produce from the ground is generally based on when it is reaped (although it is still forbidden to work the ground during the year), whilst fruit trees is when it budded and then I think Tu Bishvat (coming in 2 weeks time) is the start of the year for budding. Thus there is an issue with Shviis fruit well into next year.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to recovering debt, the normal Minhag is that the Pruzbul document is written just before the end of the Shmitta year although there are a few who write one at the start.</p>\n\n<p>The Yovel does not apply anymore and didn't apply during the 2nd temple period either.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to the \"Gregorian\" calendar, the year before one divisible by 7 is a Shviis year (i.e. January up to Rosh Hashanah) and of course the few months before it. So 2016 is divisible by 7 and 2015 is such a year. An easier way to remember now is to ignore the 2000 part and know that if the last 2 digits are divisible by 7, a Sh'viis year will start at Rosh Hashanah on that year (e.g. 14 is divisible by 7 and 2014 had such a year start in it).</p>\n\n\n",

Do not regard this as a difficulty, for it is not fitting for a man to abandon the prevailing law and raise once again the counterarguments and replies (that preceded its enactment).

There he tells Shlomo to kill Yoav and Shimi ben Gera.  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why are these his final instructions in the first place?  I expect a mafia don to give kill orders on his deathbed.  From a person as righteous as David, I expect more spiritual instructions.  Granted, David was also a general and a war-time king.</li>\n<li>The reason he gives for killing Yoav seems to ignore some more major reasons to be upset with Yoav.  <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15886#v=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Melachim I 2:5</a> David mentions Yoav killing Amasa and Avner, but not killing Avshalom or the people with Uriah, both of whom David explicitly says not to kill.  So why mention Avner & Amasa, but not Avshalom?</li>\n<li>The reason not to kill Shimi ben Geira is listed, but the reason not to kill Yoav is not.  Why didn't David kill Yoav before this?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I may have an answer for #3</p>\n\n<p>In the first chapter of Melachim we are told of some prominent people who were not part of in Adoniahu's coup</p>\n\n<p>\"And Zadok the priest and Benaiahu the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei and Rei, and the mighty men, who were with David, were not with Adoniahu\".</p>\n\n<p>If the Shimei here is the same as Shimei ben Gera, then Solomon might think that Shimei was one of his supporters. David quotes the reason why to kill him to tell Solomon to kill him despite his apparent loyalty now.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Answer to #1 - read either Rash\"i or Rada\"k who agree on a general theme regarding each of the people David mentions. He states that Shlomo should not kill them immediately, but each of these people, by their own behavior, will eventually perform some action that requires being killed. In fact, each of them did just that, eventually.</p>\n\n<p>The general point is that each of these 3 people did something at the original time that was rebellious against the king. The king is allowed to kill someone who rebels against the throne. For various reasons, David did not do this, so he commands Shlomo to \"finish business.\"</p>\n\n<p>I am surmising, though, that a new king, perhaps cannot execute someone who was rebellious against a previous king and was not executed then. I.e. - the execution status is not \"inherited\". (Something I have to check in Ramba\"m). Regardless, see the above explanation, which was David's intention.</p>\n\n<p>Answer to #2, heard from my Rav when we were studying Melachim:</p>\n\n<p>David didn't mention that Yoav killed Avshalom because that was actually a benefit to Shlomo, at the end. Had Avshalom not been killed, either he may have succeeded in killing his father (David) and / or usurping the throne, then (which was his intention), or he would have tried doingthe same with Shlomo, now. Either way, it would have been less likely that Shlomo would have been king.</p>\n\n<p>The point is, that David intentionally, didn't mention Avshalom being killed so as not to put any positive thoughts in Shlomo's head, at least not directly. (We can assume that the wise Shlomo, knew this angle, anyway.)</p>\n\n<p>I believe that Rash\"i may mention this aspect as well.</p>\n\n<p>For #3 - I have to explore further. Offhand (Guess), there may have been a tactical reason to spare Yo'av at the time. I have to read Shmu'el, again, to recall what happened. </p>\n\n\n",

In the first instance, they did not bring him a mincha, and he overlooked his honor. In the second instance, people asked whether he was worthy to be king, and he did not punish them.</p>\n\n<p>From the very beginning of his kingship, מחתילת  מלכותו, he assumed this attitude. (I would add to the two incidents mentioned by the gemara an additional two incidents: when he hid among the luggage when first being appointed; and when he did not successfully insist to the people that they wait for Shmuel for the sacrifice, a failure for which Hashem stripped him of kingship.) He did not assume the honor of kingship.</p>\n\n<p>For Shaul, then, perhaps besides being a punishment from On High, this is a natural consequence of not comporting himself in a kingly manner and assuming the mantle of rulership. </p>\n\n<p>For David, this was not at the start of his rule but an incident much later on (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08b16.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">II Shmuel 16:10</a>), in the rebellion of his son Avshalom. He was already established in his kingly role. Also, this wasn't a general character flaw in his approach to kingship.</p>\n\n<p>Update: Also, you might find this relevant. David was not all-forgiving. While he was forgiving at the time, he instructed Shlomo (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a02.htm#8\" rel=\"nofollow\">I Melachim 2:8-9</a>) to find a way to punish Shimi ben Gera.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Pronouncing Hebrew Letter (zayin) in Prayer Correctly\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When praying in a whisper, especially during the amidah (shmoneh esrei), does one have to stress the zayin ('z' sound)--which would make one sound like a buzzing bee to surrounding people--or is it okay to say it in a whisper which sounds like a samach ('s' sound) as long as you modify it slightly (I don't know how different from an 's' this would be, but you can be creative)?</p>\n\n<p>(My question is general, but is focused on a case where you don't want to make noise which may bother people. Meaning: even if the answer is that you should say it like a 'z', is it really essential for prayer that you would not have to be concerned that it may possibly bother somebody).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong><em>First, some background information</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<p><em>Hilkhoth Tefillah Uvirkath Kohanim</em> chapter five lists eight requirements that are necessary for <em>tefillah</em>, but are <em>me`aqev</em> if not performed. Among the list [5:10] is <em>hashwayath haqqol</em> - \"the leveling of the voice.\" This is explained as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The leveling of the voice. How? One should not raise his voice during his prayer, and he should not pray in his heart [i.e. without words], but rather should \"cut\" the words [i.e. mouth them] <strong><em>with his lips</em></strong> and cause his ears to hear them <strong><em>in a whisper</em></strong>. And he should not raise his voice, unless he is ill or is not able to properly direct his heart until he causes his voice to be heard - it is permitted [in such cases] to do so. Except he should not do so in a congregation so that their minds are not disturbed by his voice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Elsewhere, in <em>Hilkhoth Tefillah</em> 4:18, it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And thus we also do not stand to pray from the midst of joking, nor from the midst of frivolity, nor from the midst of common conversation, nor from the midst of dispute, nor from the midst of anger - but rather from the midst of words of Torah. And not from the midst of determining <em>halakhah</em> (although such things are words of Torah) so that his heart will not be distracted by <em>halakhah</em>. Rather, [we stand to pray] from words of Torah that do not require investigation, like <em>halakhoth pesuqoth</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As for the require to properly and exactly enunciate each letter of <em>lashon ha-qodhesh</em> in areas of the liturgical prayers of the <em>beth kenesseth</em>, it is required in only three places:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Shema</strong> - In <em>Hilkhoth Qiryath Shema`</em> 2:8 it says: \"<em>wa-ssarikh le-dhaqdeq be-othiyyothehah wa-im lo dhiqdeq yassa</em> - And it is necessary to be exacting in [the pronunciation of] its letters, and if one was not exacting he [nevertheless] fulfills his obligation.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Birkath Kohanim</strong> - In <em>Hilkhoth Tefillah Uvirkath Kohanim</em> 14:11 it says: \"<em>ein birkath kohanim na'amarath be-khol maqom ela bilshon haqqodhesh</em> - In every place that the priestly blessing is said, it is not said except in the holy language [i.e. Hebrew].\" And in 15:1-2 it says: \"<em>shishah devarim mon`in nesi'ath kapayim: hallashon... Hallashon kessadh? ha-'illghin she-ein mossi'in ha-othiyyoth ke-thiqnan, ke-ghon shaqqorin le-'ilfin 'aynin ule-'aynin ilfin, o le-shibbolth sibboleth wa-khayyosse ba-han, ein nos'im eth kapeyham. wa-khen kivdhei peh wa-khivdhei lashon, she-ein divreiham nikarim lakol, ein nos'im eth kapeyham</em>. - Six things prevent the lifting of the hands: the language [used]... The language [used]. How? Those who pronounce Hebrew in an incorrect manner and do not produce the letters as they were instituted, like those who pronounce alefs like ayins and ayins likes alefs or who pronounce '<em>shibboleth</em>' as '<em>sibboleth</em>' and other similar things, such [<em>kohanim</em>] do not lift their hands. And also those who are stammerers and of unclear speech whose words are not readily recognized by all, such [<em>kohanim</em>] do not lift their hands.\"</li>\n<li><strong><em>Hazarath HaShass</em> by the <em>Shaliah Ssibbur</em></strong>: In <em>Hilkhoth Tefillah Uvirkath Kohanim</em> 8:12 it says: \"<em>wa-khen ha-`illegh keghon mi shaqqore' le-ayin alef o le-alef ayin wa-khol mi she-eino yakhol le-hossi eth ha-othiyyoth ke-thiqnan ein memanin otho shaliah ssibbur</em> - And also the one who pronounces Hebrew in an incorrect manner, like one who pronounces an ayin like an alef or an alef like an ayin, and everyone who cannot produce the letters as they were instituted, we do not appoint such a one to lead the prayers of the congregation.\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In no other part of the service is this type of precision in pronunciation required, including one's whispered, personal prayer.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Now, to answer your question</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<p><em>Le-`aniyuth da'ati</em>, not only is it permissible to not emphasize the <em>zahnim</em> in your <em>tefillah</em> so that they sound in a whisper like you pronounce a <em>samekh</em>, but it seems that it is correct to not worry about such things at all during your <em>tefillah</em>. What is important is directing your heart toward the Creator.</p>\n\n<p>I say this because the pronunciation of the letters is a matter of <em>halakhah</em> that requires a bit of investigation and the Rambam states that such matters of Torah only serve to distract us during prayers [cf. Hilkhoth Tefillah 4:18].</p>\n\n<p>So, my answer and advice to you is pray the words of the <em>tefillah</em>, focus on their meaning and completely forget about their exact pronunciation. The halakhic imperative of the silent <em>shemoneh `esrei</em> is to direct your heart and not disturb the concentration of others praying around you. \"Buzzing like a bee\" is sure to disturb people and will not serve to make your prayer any more acceptable, but possibly - <em>has wa-shalom</em> - the opposite.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The question of pronouncing letters such as zayin correctly, while whispering the Amidah, is asked <a href=\"http://www.ykr.org.il/modules/Ask/answer/15442\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ישנם <strong>אותיות שאי אפשר לבטאם כהוגן כשמדברים בלחש. כגון; האות ז'</strong> תשמע כס' כמו שאפשר לראות כשמנסים לבטא ז' ארוכה בלחש. וכן האות ב' כשהיא רפויה בלחש תשמע תמיד כפ' רפויה, וכן ד' תשמע כת'. וא''כ שאלתי היא, <strong>היאך אנו מתפללים בלחש</strong> (אף למ''ד שישמיע לאזניו) כאשר חלק גדול מהאותיות אינם מבוטאות כראוי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The response of R. Hanokh Hakohen is that as long as a person can hear his own pronunciation, one can indeed differentiate between the zayin and sammakh, and between other similar sounding letters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם אדם לא משמיע לאוזניו אינו יכול לבטא היטב כמ\"ש בספר עטרת צבי על הזוהר (דף כ\"ב ע\"א) ומשמע מדבריו שאם משמיע לאוזניו יכול לבטא. ולענ\"ד כן הוא אלא שצריך שימת לב מרובה באותיות מסוימות כמו ז' שהזכיר כבודו, וכן ה\"א וכל כיוצ\"ב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Evidently, bee-like buzzing is unnecessary.</p>\n\n\n",

Not trying to sound sexist but is that not the logical conclusion? </p>\n\n<p>Surely there are a number of 'feminist rights activists' who have come up with a politically correct interpretation why this practice isn't prejudiced against women. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The reason is that women are obligated in fewer mitzvos than men. So Jewish men thank Hashem for not making them women, because we should be happy to have more opportunities for serving Hashem, rather than seeing it as a burden. </p>\n\n<p>This is not a newfangled feminist interpretation. This is the original reasoning for why we say this bracha. This explanation (specifically, that men say shelo asani isha because women are obligated in fewer mitzvos) appears in the tosefta, which dates from before the Gemara was compiled, and in the Yerushalmi. (J.T. Berakhot 9:1; Tosefta Berakhot 6:18). </p>\n\n<p>The fact that men have to do more mitzvos does not mean men are better -- on the contrary, some have argued that men need more mitzvos because men have a stronger evil inclination. Similarly, some argue that women do not need certain mitzvos such as tefillin because they are inherently more spiritual than men. <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/m/w/Women--Mitzvot.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.aish.com/jl/m/w/Women--Mitzvot.html</a></p>\n\n<p>I would also note that even if women have quantitatively fewer mitzvos which they are obligated to perform, this does not mean at all that the total number of mitzvos and maasim tovim that they accomplish will be less than a man. She might have fewer mitzvos overall to do, but she could do them more often (which I think women often do, given the countless acts of gemilus chasadim involved in care work, chesed volunteerism, and the helping professions). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This does not imply men are better than woman, this implies that men are better off than women. </p>\n\n<p>This is apparently the intent of the first explanation of Rashi in Menachos 43b when the gemara says a slave is the same as a woman, Rashi says 'for she too is a servant to her husband like a save to his master'. Rashi's other explenation is the one cited in classic works of halacha starting with the Tur inn siman 46, but I would like to focus on this one.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout history women have been subjugated and abused. This unfortunately seems to be ingrained in human nature. Whether you believe in a literal reading of the story in Eden or an allegorical one, at the end of the day the Torah was compelled to point out this unfortunate reality.</p>\n\n<p>We in the modern world have learned to respect and appreciate women, but any step backwards proves the unfortunate reality, as seen in all backwards societies where the woman are subjected and abused.</p>\n\n<p>It is in light of this unfortunate state that we thank Hashem for not putting us in that position. But we should remember that we can overcome all the curses of Eden. We can easy without sweating, we can raise children happily, and we can have equal partnerships with our spouses. </p>\n\n\n",

An extreme case is the Rambam but also Rabenu Tam goes the same way. </p>\n\n<p>When did we start not to try to be posek like one shita but rather to try to be machmir like both of them? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This is an oversimplification, but the question is also very general. I will preface with another two questions. Why is it that if someone rules according to Beis Shamai, or for that matter any opinion in the gemara that we don't rule with he is chastised, even when being stringent, but when it comes to geonim and rishonim there is an allowance to use other opinions, even to be lenient. The answer to this will set up the next question. And the answer is something called Siyum HaShaas (the end of the Talmudic era).<br>\nQuestion number two what is Siyum Hashaas and how does it work?\nFor this I will try to phrase my answer based on Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's guidebook to Jewish thought but I don't remember his exact terminology or sources, so I will paraphrase.<br>\nSiyum Hashaas, or for that matter the end of any halachic era is when the entire body of the Jewish community is in agreement on a certain set of laws. End paraphrase. I think he was quoting geonim. So when Jews decided to rule like Beis Hillel, whether by vote or heavenly proclamation, this became the end game for Beis Shamai. Same for any ruling in the gemara which was accepted by all before the times of the geonim. Later when new disagreements arose, there was never a point where the entire Jewish world agreed with any given opinion, and if there was it was final. That means that the onion of let's say a Rashba which is not how we rule is worth more in a halakhic scale than the opinion of Abaye whom we didn't rule with. Nothing personal. </p>\n\n<p>Back to your question, being that we have no definitive path to take, whether to be lenient or stringent, we are left wondering how to properly serve God. As such, many times we are chayash, worried, and try to be stringent. This is a requirement when dealing with rules on a deoraisa level, as we can understand very clearly based on the above, but this is also an indication for mitzvah observance in general, which shouldn't seem so foreign, based again on the above.<br>\nImagine two people telling you where a treasure was buried and you don't know who to listen to. Wouldn't you try to figure out a way to take both into your plans? If however it is clear to you which one of them is giving proper directions, obviously the rules change. That's where poskim, or lets say learned people, play in as a factor and say 'I am ruling with this opinion'. That is fine. It's an educated opinion.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This stems from lack of independent psak and dependence on other poskim.  Earlier Rishonim Rif and Rambam, for example rarely quote others.  THus they will be more meikel since at most they only need to worry about one opinion (their own).  Later poskim tend to be more reliant and hence need to consider more possible opinions and be machmir based on the machmirest common denominator.  Thus Shulchan Aruch who relies on the earlier Rishonim is usually more mikel than Rama who relies on later poskim who tend to be less independent, and thus more machmir.\nEven much later than Rambam some e.g. Shaagas Aryeh and to a lesser degree Aruch Hashulchan retained more independence \n(My own analysis which seems pretty pashut)</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Retzuah Problems",
    "content": "# Retzuah Problems\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've recently been having a couple of problems with the <em>retzuot</em> (straps) for my head tefillin. First and foremost, the knot (\"double-dalet\" or \"square\" if it makes a difference for answers) has been riding up from the hollow of my neck by as much as an inch! In addition, the loose portions of the <em>retzuah</em> have a tendency to flip over, which may be a halachic problem (I don't have double-black ones).</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know any practical solutions to keep the knot and straps in place?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As for your strap and know issues with the head <em>tefillin</em>, I suggest that you make adjustments until it fits properly, with the knot at the base of the skull and the <em>tefillah</em> sitting just at the front of the spot on the head that is soft when a baby is born. [see <em>Mishneh Thorah</em>, <em>Hilkhoth Tefillin</em> 4:1]</p>\n\n<p>If you are unable to make it work, then I would confer with a competent rabbi or scribe. If this does not work, then I would seriously consider replacing your <em>ressu`oth</em> with newer, more predictable straps.</p>\n\n<p>One of the common problems that I see is that people do not give their <em>tefillah shel rosh</em> enough slack around the sides of their head because they either are wanting the <em>bayith</em> to sit almost directly on top of their head, or they are concerned about it sitting too close to their hairline, or both. This is especially a problem if your <em>batim</em> are larger. But if one gives more slack and aims to set the <em>shel rosh</em> more toward the front of their head, just a centimeter or so above their front hairline, then everything will sit better and will be worn more comfortably.</p>\n\n<p>A more expensive option is to trade in your current <em>tefillin</em> for something closer to 2x2 cm in size, as made by many Temani <em>soferim</em> in <em>Eress Yisra'el</em>. Many find them to be the \"Cadillac\" of <em>tefillin</em> in both quality and comfort, and once they make the switch they rarely go back. </p>\n\n<p>As for the excess straps flipping over, it is not a halakhic problem at all unless the underside is red. Otherwise, if it the usual white-gray or greenish color, it is completely fine. This is explicitly stated and explained in <em>Mishneh Thorah</em>, <em>Hilkhoth Tefillin</em> 3:14.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The way the square knot as practiced by ashkenazim is tied leads to the loose part of the retzua being prone to flipping. Thinner retzuos tend to flip less. You can also retie the knot so that the pinched side faces down, which also helps. As Maimonist said, you can prevent the knot from riding up on your head by loosening the strap.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Did any classic rabbinic sources discuss static electricity?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Not much more to add here, I've just always wondered if static electricity was discussed in any Chazzal or Rishonim. Someone from those times must've gotten a good zap and I'm wondering what they had to say about it.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Birshus Double AA. To clarify, I am not necessarily looking for a halakhic discourse on the subject. But being that there was always available glass and fur and silk and other common household items that aid in the production of static electricity, I'm wondering if any of our great Rabbis ever discussed experiencing just such a phenomenon. Whether it was an unexpected spark, or a piece of paper sticking to a glass cup. Anything that would have seemed curious. Perhaps they might have even given an explenation.\n Considering that words like ברק, חשמל, פולתא דנורא abound in all our holy books I would think if someone experienced anything close to the aforementioned it would peak his curiosity. \n Various other natural phenomenon have found their place in our sfarim. Rashi and Rashba both mention magnets for instance.\n And considering that amongst our Rabbis there have been alchemists and mention of alchemy for almost a millennia, scientific curiosity was not something they would shy away from. So perhaps this was mentioned in a professional, scientific way.\n This is what I seek. Someone mentioning something.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Based on some research, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/static_materials.htm#.VNB-IGhh95Q\">this link</a>, I would venture that the Chazzal, the Rishonim and even early Achronim never heard of it and rarely if ever experienced the <em>zap</em> of static electricity.</p>\n\n<p>About the only way to <em>accidentally</em> produce static electricity <strong>without synthetic materials</strong> is by rubbing silk on glass, or fur on copper. </p>\n\n<p>Since they didn't wear synthetic clothing nor walk on synthetic carpets with synthetic shoes they wouldn't gotten that <em>zap</em> we have gotten to love when peeling off our woolen Tzitzis from our polyester-mix shirt.</p>\n\n<p>So until we started living with lots of synthetic materials, home-grown static electricity mus have been very rare, if at all possible for the layman.</p>\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/~kskeldon/PubSci/exhibits/E7/\">this</a> about early uses of static elecricity:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The effects of static electricity were first discovered by the Greeks. In the sixth century BCE the Greek philosopher Thales found that amber, when rubbed with fur, could attract little pieces of dry straw. The Greeks didn't understand what was happening, and thought of the experiments as tricks.</p>\n  \n  <p>However the peculiar effect did have its uses. In spinning silk using amber spindles, the attraction force would cause the threads to cling and that in turn made them easier to control. The Greek word for amber is in fact our word 'electron' and is the origin of the term electricity and all its derivatives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note there is no mention of sparks - just the \"Flyaway hair\" effect.</p>\n\n<p>Since spinning silk is forbidden on Shabbat anyways, it would not have attracted Halachic attention.</p>\n\n\n",

If it was really as common 100 years ago as these authors claim, I would expect there to be communities in America that preserve it.  I am sure that there would be a tendency for \"modernists\" to make it silent like in standard Israeli Hebrew, but many orthodox communities preserve older pronunciations out of a desire not to change their mesorah.

Only the cholam 'ou' we would have in common.</p>\n<p>I spoke about it with many rabbis and academics but no one can tell me where it is from.</p>\n<p>I myself think it must be old and maybe Ashkenazi Jewry started out with the ayin as a 'ng'. How else would we explain why until today Eastern Europeans say 'Yankele' also with the 'ng' sound?</p>\n<p>On the other hand the Dutch sephardim (Portugese) also pronounce the ayin as an 'ng'.

But that wouldn't make much sense since we learn that the nusachos have just the opposite background: Ashkenaz was majorly influenced by Eretz Yisroeil and Sephard by Bavel...

According to this, if the <em>tafel</em> was not there and you did not have intention to eat it when you made the blessing, then it wouldn't be covered.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is another approach, which is that a food that is secondary is not significant enough to require a blessing at all (Rashba citing the Ba'al HaMeor in Berachos 41b s.v. Amar Rav Papa)! According to this approach, the blessing on the primary is not covering the secondary, but rather the secondary does not need a blessing because it is not a significant part of this meal.  If that is the case, your <em>tafel</em> would still not need a blessing, because it is still a <em>tafel</em> and not significant enough to require a blessing.</p>\n\n<p>Normative halacha seems to follow the first approach, although there are arguments to be made for the second.  (Of course, CYLOR.)</p>\n\n<p>If you had it in mind, then even according to the first approach it could be you would not need a new blessing, since the blessing on the <em>ikar</em> would extend to the <em>tafel</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://westmountshul.com/documents/Review%20Sheet%2016.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>. Excerpt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>A bracha she'ayna tzricha is an unnecessary bracha -- i.e. it was said on a food that was already covered by a previous bracha. Although\n  the bracha is in one sense \"fulfilled\" (i.e. the food is eaten),\n  nevertheless the bracha is unnecessary and hence improper. For\n  example, you begin your meal with bread, saying the bracha Hamotzee.\n  You then take a piece of chicken and say the bracha Shehakol.</li>\n  <li>One is not even allowed to cause a bracha she'ayna tzricha to be said. This means that you may not say a bracha when it could have been\n  avoided, as in the following case: You sit down to a meal and first\n  say the bracha Shehakol on the chicken. You then proceed to say a\n  bracha on the bread.</li>\n  <li>This last rule, however, only applies only when you are planning to eat the second food right away. If, however, the second food is not\n  going to be eaten right now, the first food may be eaten with its own\n  bracha. For example, you come home, wile waiting for dinner to be\n  ready, and grab a drink to quench your thirst, saying the bracha\n  Shehakol. Since the meal was not ready yet, and you were thirsty right\n  now, you were not obligated to wait to take a drink.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This doesn't sound like a case of \"tofel\", but rather a separate eating of food that wasn't initially there for which rule #3 above applies. Granted, the example is that \"dinner wasn't ready\". But, the beginning of the paragraph implies that you weren't <strong>planning</strong> to eat the 2nd food right away, which is your case. It doesn't specify anything about \"tafel\", and, my understanding is that there is no situation of \"tafel\" unless it's there already prior to your eating the mixture. I.e. - adding it later, does not make it \"tafel\" after the fact.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, for both reasons - it's not tafel and you didn't think of eating it at the beginning, you would make a separate bracha on the toppings.</p>\n\n\n",

We are coming to that later.</p>\n<h2>Can a man who cannot make Chalitsa perform a Ybum?</h2>\n<p>Mishna and Gemara in the second chapter of Sanhedrin dealt  a very similar issue.</p>\n<p>Mishna Sanhedrin 2, 2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַמֶּלֶךְ ... לֹא חוֹלֵץ וְלֹא חוֹלְצִין לְאִשְׁתּוֹ . לֹא מְיַבֵּם וְלֹא מְיַבְּמִין לְאִשְׁתּוֹ.‏</p>\n<p>he [the king] may not perform halizah nor may it be performed to his wife.  he may not perform yibbum {because Chalitsa is an humiliation and <strong>one who cannot be released by chalitsa cannot be \"married\" by Ybum, Bartenura and Rambam</strong>} nor may it be performed to his wife {because she can not marry again, Rashi; since  she can not marry, she is not concerned by Chalitsa. The explanation of Rashi is valuable  according to Rabanan, but not according to Halacha. Halacha is that she can be married by an other king (for this we agree to Rabbi Yehuda). If this other king is a Yabam, after all, since we can not make a Chalitsa between the two, since this other king needs honors, he can not make Yibbum with this widow of his brother (who  was the first king), thist last explanation is on Rambam's commentary on our mishna}.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>We learn from the Rambam, cited in Tosfot Yom Tov that one who is unable perform Chalitsa is also unable to perform a Ybum.</h3>\n<p>Let's examine the Rambam carefully: Sefer Shoftim, hilchot Melachim, Chapter 2, halacha 3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאֵינוּ חוֹלֵץ--שֶׁנֶּאֱמָר \"וְיָרְקָה בְּפָנָיו\" (דברים כה,ט), וְזֶה בִּזָּיוֹן; וְאַפִלּוּ רָצָה, אֵין שׁוֹמְעִין לוֹ--שֶׁהַמֶּלֶךְ שֶׁמָּחַל עַל כְּבוֹדוֹ, אֵין כְּבוֹדוֹ מָחוּל.  <strong>וְהוֹאִיל וְאֵינוּ חוֹלֵץ, אֵינוּ מְיַבֵּם</strong>; וְכֵן כֵּיוָן שְׁאֵי אִפְשָׁר לְיַבַּם אֶת אִשְׁתּוֹ--כָּךְ אֵין חוֹלְצִין לָהּ, אֵלָא תֵּשֵׁב לְעוֹלָם בְּזִיקָתָהּ. ‏</p>\n<p>... He may not perform chalitzah, for concerning that ritual, it is said Deuteronomy 25:9: 'And she shall spit before him.' This would be disrespectful to the king. Even if he desires to perform this mitzvah, he is not given the opportunity because a king's honor must be preserved even though he is willing to forgo it. <strong>Since he is not allowed to perform chalitzah, he is not eligible to participate in yibbum</strong>. Similarly, in the event of his death, since it is forbidden to initiate yibbum with his wife, chalitzah is also not performed for her. Rather, she must remain in her state of attachment forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>But this principle established by Rambam (in bold characters above) is not written in Gemara.</h3>\n<p>Acharonim (including Tosfot Yom Tov) on the Mishna of Sanhedrin asked this.\nThe Rashash on Mishne Torah (mekorot Harambam) and on Mishnayot Sanhedrin (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37945&st=&pgnum=530&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) reports the same reasoning seen Rambam in <strong>Tosfot Yebamot 44a</strong>. Tosfot is discussing a Girsa. The case is: A man who deceased and left  two widows without  children. The Gemara (i.e. the discussed Girsa of the Gemara)asks: Why not to make Chalitsa to one wife and Yebum to the second? The Gemara answers: The verse says \"who do not build\", \"Who has not built could not build\". Tosfot says that this girsa is wrong because this case is obvious and we do not need this verse. The explanation of Tosfot is: After the Chalitsa of the first widow, the Yabam cannot make Chalitsa to the second widow (בית אחד הוא חולץ ואינו חולץ שני בתים, he makes chalitsa for one house and he doesn't make chalitsa for two houses). <strong>Since he can not make Chalitsa to the second wife, he cannot make her Ybum.</strong></p>\n<p>Anyway the reasoning of Tosfot shows that he agrees to the principle written in Rambam.</p>\n<p><em><strong>In conclusion, Tosfot and Rambam read this material implication as a logical equivalence</strong></em>.</p>\n<h2>With Isur Keddusha, Yabam makes Chalitsa but not Ybum.</h2>\n<p>In Gemara Yavamot 20a, there is an opinion, apparently <strong>rejected</strong> at the end of the Sugia, <strong>the opinion of Rav Gidel in name of Rav</strong>. He rules from the verse \"Yebimto\" that Isur Kedusha, that is Chayve Lavin have Chalitsa and not Ybum. An exception against the Rule \"כל העולה ליבום עולה לחליצה, כל שאינו עולה ליבום עולה לחליצה\" (A Yabam).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R`Giddal replied in the name of Rab: Scripture stated, Then his brother's wife shall go up to the 'gate, where there was no need to state his brother's wife; why then was 'his brother's wife' specified? [To indicate that] there is a case of another brother's wife who goes up for halizah but does not go up for levirate marriage.(46) And who is she? One of those prohibited by a negative precept.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the conclusion of the Gemara is that Miderabanan the cannot make Ybum wiiht Isur Keddusha. but min Hatora it's permitted. (see Rambam Ybum 6.10).</p>\n<h3>Difference between Issur Kedusha (lav) as Mamzeret and King:</h3>\n<p>After all the Yabam can make Chalitsa to a Yebama, so why a king cannot make a Ybum? In the case of Isur Kedusha both Y. and Ch. are regulatory. In the case of a King, the action of Chalitsa is itself a sin, despite that it is a Mitsva. so Chalitsa can not reject its proper problem, no Ase Doche Lo Taase. This is the reasoning of Chachamim against Rabbi Yehuda. Since Chalitsa and Ybum are prohibited Min Hatora.</p>\n<p>See shut <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1024&st=&pgnum=277\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ber Ytschak from Rav Ytschak Elchanan Spector Mikovno</a></p>\n<h1>Conclusion:</h1>\n<p>Case: The Yabam has no legs and Chalitsa is not possible. The woman will remain Aguna. I think that such Yabam is not allowed to make Ybum at all (But may be that my demonstration is wrong d/t difference between technical impossibility and halachical prohibition.)</p>\n<p>There is an other possibility to understand the Rambam. In  Gemara we have two statements.</p>\n<p>(1) One who can make ybum can make chalitsa:</p>\n<p>A => B</p>\n<p>(2) One who cannot make ybum cannot make chalitsa</p>\n<p>~A => ~B</p>\n<p>So, a logical result of the both statements is</p>\n<p>A <=> B</p>\n<p>~B <=> ~A</p>\n<p>A man man who is not able to perform chalitsa is not able to perform ybum.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Mishnah and gemora  on Perek 14 of Yevamos (Charais Shenisa - 112b to 113b) seems to deal with it by not mentioning any case except that of the two sisters (as the basic case of a yevama). That is, the implication is that in any case where the cheireish is faced with the problem of having to give chalitzah to a woman who is asur to him, it is treated exactly as if she is the sister of his wife. Since the gemora does not bring up the case of isur derabbanim, such as the cases that you mention they are treated in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Had there been a difference, the gemara would have asked that question.</p>\n\n<p>I see that you changed the question to \"for practical reasons\". This makes it more explicit. In other locations, earlier, the gemara deals with someone without a leg and how much must be missing to invalidate the chalitzah. However, the answer above still applies. If he or she cannot do chalitzah for any reason, then she is stuck unless he is allowed to do yibum or unless the reason they cannot do yibum is an isur from the Torah (such as the sister of his wife).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>The Rabbanan forbade a <em>Yisralis</em> to do Yibbum with a <em>mamzer</em> even though <em>asei doche lo taaseh</em></strong> i.e  positive mitzva of Yibbum overrides the negative Mitzva of marital relations with a Mamzer (Chalitza would not be considered a Mitzva at all to replace mitzva of Yibbum).<br>\n<strong>This is because, though the first cohabitation is a Mitzva of Yibbum,  every subsequent cohabitation is no longer Yibbum and would be forbidden as a negative Mitzva and they might just remain together doing many Aveiros,</strong> so the Decree is not to do one Mitzva of Yibbum that could lead to many Aveiros.\nSource: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.20b.2-17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 20b</a>, Rambam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Levirate_Marriage_and_Release.6.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Yibbum V'Chalitza 6:10</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חכמים גזרו שלא יתייבמו חייבי לאוין ולא שניות גזירה שמא יבוא עליה פעם שנייה והרי ביאתה אסורה ואין שם מצוה שאין מצות עשה אלא ביאה ראשונה בלבד לפיכך אם עבר ובעל יבמתו האסורה לו משום לאו או משום עשה וא\"צ לומר שנייה ה\"ז קנה קנין גמור ומוציאה בגט</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We can see that the <em>Gezeira derabanan</em> forbids any <em>Mamzer</em> even when the legs are amputated above the knee* to do Yibbum because of the potential sins in the subsequent marriage so over here this woman unfortunately has no solution and has to wait till this guy dies though if he transgresses this <em>Gezeira derabanan</em> and does Yibbum anyway we force him to divorce her straight away.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*according to ashkenazim, normally when people are not forbidden to marry each other, if chalitza is impossible to fulfil when the legs are amputated above the knee, Yibbum is performed followed by a divorce from the husband as technically since they are permitted to each other and there is no Aveira in their relationship: נקטעה רגלו מעל הברך, לדברי הכל חליצתה פסולה; ועל היבם לייבם את האשה ולהוציאה אחר כך בגט בשו\"ת שרידי אש, ח\"ג סי' מט, בדעת גדולי האחרונים - שבות יעקב, בית מאיר, חת\"ס, הגר' חיים עוזר גרודזנסקי, וכן כתב באו\"ז סי' תרסה, בשם ריב\"ן</p>\n\n\n",

There was no point for revenge from a visitor, only from a slave. He goes on to explain why it is that they did die. He says that any Egyptian firstborn had to die as he is still an Egyptian even though he is out of the country. He says if they were simply visiting the other countries we wouldn't need a drasha for this, it would be simple. The drasha is telling us that even an Egyptian captive in other country was subject to the Makka. The reason the foreigners, had to die, would have also been simple had they been there to stay. But he has a secondary drasha to include Kushites and Chamites which he says is coming to include temporary travelers, as the lands of these people were close, and travel was common.</p>\n\n<p>What comes out is that according to him there was actually no reason to kill the travelers, but we are dealing with Hashem waging a total war against Egyptian firstborns, and what we have is a drasha to tell us that he did in fact kill them, not a reason why.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# \"bechor hashifcha\" and \"bechor hashvi\" -- why the change? (Shemos 11:5, 12:29)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During <em>leining</em> today, I noticed that the Torah changes its wording, when describing the breadth of <em>Makkas Bechoros</em> -- when Pharaoh is warned, in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9872#v=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemot 11:5</a>, we have:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּמֵת כָּל בְּכוֹר בְּאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם מִבְּכוֹר פַּרְעֹה הַיּשֵׁב עַל\n  כִּסְאוֹ עַד <strong>בְּכוֹר הַשִּׁפְחָה אֲשֶׁר אַחַר הָרֵחָיִם</strong> וְכֹל בְּכוֹר\n  בְּהֵמָה</p>\n  \n  <p>and every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn\n  of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the <strong>firstborn of the slave woman\n  who is behind the millstones</strong>, and every firstborn animal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, when the <em>makka</em> actually hits (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9873#v=29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemot 12:29</a>), the wording changes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִי | בַּחֲצִי הַלַּיְלָה וַיהֹוָה הִכָּה כָל בְּכוֹר בְּאֶרֶץ\n  מִצְרַיִם מִבְּכֹר פַּרְעֹה הַיּשֵׁב עַל כִּסְאוֹ עַד <strong>בְּכוֹר\n  הַשְּׁבִי אֲשֶׁר בְּבֵית הַבּוֹר</strong> וְכֹל בְּכוֹר בְּהֵמָה</p>\n  \n  <p>It came to pass at midnight, and the Lord smote every firstborn in the\n  land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to\n  the <strong>firstborn of the captive who is in the dungeon</strong>, and every\n  firstborn animal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<em>Judaica Press translation, copied from Chabad.org</em>)</p>\n\n<p>So the mention of \"בכור פרעה הישב על כסאו...וכל בכור בהמה\" doesn't change, while the middle example <em>does</em> change, from \"בכור השפחה אשר אחר הרחים\" to \"בכור השבי אשר בבית הבור.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The mipharshei Rashi on 11:5 try explaining why Rashi chose to explain the reason for the death of the firstborns of the captives as being so they should not think it was their gods punishing the Egyptians, even though they are not mentioned in that passuk. </p>\n\n<p>See the Sifsei Chachamim, his words are basically from the Mizrachi and Gur Aryeh. From what they are discussing I think there lies an answer to your question.</p>\n\n<p>There seems to be an understanding that the maidservants are higher up in hierarchy of Egyptian society than the captives, as the maidservants were Egyptians who had to sell themselves for monetary reasons. As such, when warning the Egyptians about the Makas Bechors, the captives were not mentioned as that fact wouldn't persuade them to let the Bnei Yisroel out. So while mentioning who will die from the top down, the list was stopped at the firstborn of the maidservants. However, by the actual plague, the full list was given, from the top all the way down to the firstborn of the captives. </p>\n\n<p>As to the question these pirushim were dealing with, the placement of Rashi's comment, one of the answers was this was a preemptive move to avoid a question. Rashi just finished explaining that the term around midnight was used so Moshe would look like a liar. But now, if the warning was different than the Makka concerning the sons of the captives, he would also look like a liar. So Rashi chose to explain that the death of the firstborn of captives had nothing to do with Makkas Bechoros and everyone knew it. </p>\n\n<p>Based on this idea, there is another chidush found in the seffer Birchas Ish from R' Avraham Shein in the name of his friend R' Dovid Grossman. He uses this fundamental difference between the reason for the death of the firstborn of the captives and all the other first borns to explain a different question found in the mipharshim. How is it that we find Hashem in passuk 11:4 saying He will personally kill the firstborns, a point emphasised in the Hagada, and yet in chapter 12 passuk 23 we find explicit mention of a mashkhis, destructive force, which due to the blood on the door posts will not be able to enter the Jewish houses. He answers that the mashkhis was there to kill the firstborn of the captives. In 12:29 it simply says Hashem smote, this term is used for his use of emissaries as well as found by the destruction of Sedom. But in 11:4 where it does not discuss the death of the captives is where we find the term 'ani', Hashem doing the killing by himself.</p>\n\n\n",

Compare these words in this verse with the actual oath that Yosef said as quoted in the 2nd to last verse in Breishit. The last word \"Itchem\" that is in the verse in Shemot is not mentioned by Yosef.</p>\n\n<p>I viewed the commentaries and they seem to explain what this extra word means. But, according to the way the verse reads, it looks like they are quoting what Yosef actually said. So, did Yosef say the word \"Itchem\" as part of his oath? If yes, how do we know; If not, why is this word included to make it seem as if he did? Or, is the quote not meant to be exact?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch in Vay'chi 50:25 points out that this oath was not just designed to bind the brothers, but was meant to bind whichever generation actually managed to leave Mitzraim. Thus, he could not make the original oath use the word Itchem. However, when the exodus actually occurred, the oath then took effect and the word \"itchem\" now applied.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One of the purposes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash_halakha#The_two_schools\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">halakhic Midrash</a> was the exegesis of the Bible. In this regard, the halakhic midrash extant for the Book of Exodus comes from the school of R. Ishmael, which is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekhilta_of_Rabbi_Ishmael\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael</em></a>. The word Mekhilta comes from the Aramaic word מכילתא, which means a collection of rules of interpretation, which is what we today would call Biblical Hermeneutics.</p>\n\n<p>In tractate <em>Beshallaḥ</em>, Chapter 1, we read the following in regard to Exodus 13:19:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>And Ye Shall Carry Up My Bones Away Hence</em>. I might understand this to mean immediately after his death, but it says: “With you”— when you go up. And whence do we know that they also carried up with them the bones of all the other founders of the tribes? From the expression: “Away hence with you.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The midrash recognizes that Moses in the Book of Exodus was quoting words from Joseph that were not recorded in the Book of Genesis. Thus when Moses quoted the expression “with you,” the implication was that Joseph was talking to his brothers <strong><em>whose bones would go with the bones of Joseph</em></strong>. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, had the Book of Genesis mentioned the phrase “with you,” the idea in the Book of Genesis would have suggested that the bones of Joseph (and only those of Joseph) move immediately out of Egypt upon his death. The reader of the Book of Genesis could make the logical inference that the Exodus (in the mind of Joseph) was imminent at the time of his death.</p>\n\n<p>Many manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible (to include the Samaritan Pentateuch) and various other translations <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2RkVp.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">have edited and included the words “with you” in the Book of Genesis</a>. While this editorial clarification in the book of Genesis brings the quote into perfect alignment with the quote from Moses in the Book of Exodus, the well-intentioned editorial change loses the very fine and nuanced meaning as discovered by the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekhilta_of_Rabbi_Ishmael\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael</a></em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong><br>\nLauterbach, Jacob Z.

Why use this term instead of the more common term \"Pharoah\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't have an authoritative answer but one comment that the Ohr Hachayim makes made me think. He cites an opinion (and, admittedly, the abbreviation for the source is unfamiliar to me) that Par'oh wrote a <em>get shichrur</em> for the nation, freeing them. If that is taken as a fact, then the people who informed Par'oh would have to have grounds to appeal to him -- but Par'oh can't go back on the contract he signed (yes, I'm borrowing liberally from the kingly notion of ein lehashiv from the megillah). </p>\n\n<p>So the text indicates that there is this loophole the king tries to employ by being thought of as another \"personality\", the 'king of Egypt' as opposed to the \"Par'oh\" who signed the document. But the later use of Par'oh in the pasuk, and the use of the combined terms in pasuk 8 allow the text to destroy that loophole: the two personalities are one and the same person and he should be bound by his signature. Semantic games can't be employed to give him deniability.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I could be completely misunderstanding the Ohr Hachayim, and am just making this up to explain what could be a simple stylistic textual choice. Take it with as much salt as you need.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Without any sources, I think Pharoh is how you perceived Pharoh subjectively when you are in Mitzrayim.

Historically and etymologically the word \"pharaoh\" actually <a href=\"http://thetorah.com/the-title-pharaoh/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">means \"Great House\"</a>, that is, the palace of king, not the king himself. In this sense \"king of Egypt\" would be more especific (although without naming) depending on the usage in its time.  </p>\n\n<p>According to Joel Forman in <a href=\"http://jbqnew.jewishbible.org/assets/Uploads/431/jbq_431_formanpharaoh.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The use of the Term Pharaoh in the Bible</a> (Jewish Bible Quarterly, Vol. 43:1 (169) January – March 2015: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The kings of Egypt were not originally called pharaohs by the ancient\n  Egyptians. The term \"pharaoh\" for the king of Egypt developed over\n  time, and was also used by the Hebrews and Greeks to describe the\n  Egyptian ruler. In Ancient Egypt, the term \"pharaoh\" was not\n  originally a royal title. Translated literally, the earliest meaning\n  of the Egyptian word per-o was \"great house\", that is the palace or\n  residence of the king and his administration.  <strong>The term \"pharaoh\"\n  referred to the ordinances and commands the king issued in his\n  administration, but not to the person of the king himself</strong>. In New\n  Kingdom times (sixteenth century BCE), it began to designate the king\n  himself, rather like our use of \"The White House\" to refer to the\n  American president or \"The Crown\" to refer to the British monarch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there a halacha that limits the use of stretching letters in the Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/43753/what-is-the-reason-for-stretched-letters-in-the-torah\">this related question</a> . That question explains the reason for having them. My question asks if there are any halachot that limit its use.</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago - I think it was parshat Shmot, I read from a Sefer Torah in my shul where one column had almost every letter stretched. I find it extremely annoying to read from such a Torah. I can tolerate seeing this occasionally, but almost every word with a stretched letter???</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if there are any halachot that limit its use. Specifically if there are limitations on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Where it can be used in a row. First / last letter or only in the middle?</li>\n<li>How often can it be used within a row or a parsha (a Torah / ktav \"parsha\", i.e. a paragraph)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While there are halachos for the size requirements of each letter (as brought down by the Mishna Berura in Mishnas Sofrim - found in Chelek Alef), these are l'chatchila. Since spacing can be difficult, many sofrim (especially beginners) will extend letters to fill space, since space is an issue an separates the various parshiyos in the torah. So, as long as the letter fulfills the halachic requirements of its shape (not completely the same as the halachic requirements of its size, though they are inherently interrelated) it is kosher. But, while kosher, it would not have the status of being mehudar. </p>\n\n<p>As a side point, sometimes there are specific places where Halacha/mesora does require a size change of the letters. </p>\n\n<p>ADDED AFTER ORIGINAL POST:\nIn regard to matters of l'chatchila and b'dieved this is stated both explicitly and through basic understanding of what the Mishna Berura writes in Mishnas Sofrim and in the Beur Halacha. Specifically, when he discusses the kashrus of letters and what to do in a matter of safek, namely sheilos tinok. This is a process where an average child is asked to read the letter and determine what it means while other letters around it are covered up to avoid using context. He also discusses the size of each letter based on kolmus length (the width of the tip of the quill is considered a single kolmus length) from which appropriate letter proportions are determined. Finally, as to my assertion of beginner sofrim versus those who are more skilled, this is a comment made based on my own experience in learning safrus And producing my own writings. </p>\n\n\n",

Tanya CH.4 says that a soul has 613 organs like the \"organs of the King\". I'm assuming that since man is made in the image of G-d, then it's describing the organs of a <em>nefesh haAdam</em>. Is this describing the <em>nefesh haAdam</em> as having 613 organs?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are indeed several sources among the works of Chassidus and later kabbalistic works which describe the soul as being a spiritual counter-shape to the shape of the physical body. In other words, just as the physical body has 613 parts, so does the soul. (I believe that this idea is based on the Zohar, Beraishis 9a but I won't go into details)</p>\n\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22245&st=&pgnum=117\" rel=\"nofollow\">Me'or V'Shemesh</a> (Parshas Bechukosai) quotes this as a teaching that he had received:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קבלנו על הנשמה שיש לה צורה והיא כצורת אדם זכר לזכר ונקבה לנקבה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And, in a fascinating application of this idea, the Pardes Yosef says that a person whose limb was cut off can still pray for his 248 limbs, for this reason: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נסתפק במי שחתך לו הרופא אבר רחמנא לצלן, אם יכול לומר בתפילתו רמ״ח אברים שלי... אין קפידא, דאע״פ שלא נשאר לו רק רמ״ז, מכל מקום אברים הרוחניים של הנשמה הם בשלמות כידוע דגם בנשמה יש אברים וגידים\n  (פרשת משפטים קט״ז) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, if we were discussing another Chassidic thinker I would answer this question in the positive. <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, because you're asking specifically about the Tanya, this is probably incorrect, because the Rebbe also writes in that same book (Liutei Amarim 51):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין שינוי קבלת הכחות והחיות שבאברי הגוף מן הנשמה מצד עצמה ומהותה שיהיה מהותה ועצמותה מתחלק לרמ\"ח חלקים שונים, מתלבשים ברמ\"ח מקומות כפי ציור חלקי מקומות אברי הגוף, שלפי זה נמצא עצמותה ומהותה מצויר בציור גשמי ודמות ותבנית כתבנית הגוף חס ושלום, אלא כולה עצם אחד רוחני פשוט ומופשט מכל ציור גשמי ומבחינה וגדר מקום ומדה וגבול גשמי מצד מהותה ועצמותה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, the Baal HaTanya doesn't seem to believe that the soul has parts. Instead, what he probably means (in chapter 4) is that the soul has 613 <em>aspects</em> or something like that. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1556513/jewish/What-Is-the-Significance-of-the-Number-of-Gds-613-Commandments.htm#footnote1a1556513\" rel=\"nofollow\">this footnote at chabad.org</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They are not counted according to scientific methods.

Please cite sources</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>While your question is overly broad, the short answer is \"yes\" - at least so far as Rishonim are concerned, and only because I don't know of any examples from geonim. (There are numerous examples of humour being employed in the Talmud, but that's beyond the scope of what you asked).</p>\n\n<p>There are two famous examples from Ibn Ezra, who lived from approximately 1089-1164 and who composed a couple of commentaries on the Torah. In Exodus 21:35, he takes issue with the opinion of a Karaite scholar named Ben Zuta, who held that the noun רעהו (\"his friend\") had שור (\"ox\") as its referent, and that rather than providing a scenario in which one man's ox gores the ox of another (literally, \"the ox of his friend\"), Ben Zuta suggested that the injured ox was the friend of the one that gored it. In responding to Ben Zuta, Ibn Ezra gibes that the only friend that oxen have is Ben Zuta himself (ואין לשור ריע רק בן זוטא לבדו).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in Genesis 29:17, Ibn Ezra takes issue with a Karaite scholar named Ben Efraim who suggested that the description of Leah's eyes as being \"soft\" (רכות) was missing an <em>alef</em>, and that it should say \"long\" (ארוכות). In response, Ibn Ezra suggests that it is Ben Efraim who should be missing the <em>alef</em> and that his name, therefore, be בן פרים (\"son of cattle\"). That these statements are humorous might seem obvious, but for an explicit assertion to that effect, see Avi Ezer on Genesis 15:11.</p>\n\n<p>Humour, of course, doesn't have to be used for the purpose of mockery. One particularly famous example where it is not used in such a fashion (and depending on whether or not you consider him a Rishon) is in the Rema's response to an assertion made by the Bet Yosef in Yoreh Deah 87:3. There, R' Yosef Karo points out that one should be careful not to mix fish with milk, since the combination is a dangerous one (אין לאכול דגים בחלב מפני הסכנה), and cites Orach Chayim 173 as a support. The problem is, the Tur in OC 173:2 makes this statement as regards fish and <em>meat</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It has long been suggested that the reference to milk in YD 87 is a typo, and an easy one to make when you consider that \"meat\" and \"milk\" are often used in connection with one another. The Rema (Darkhei Moshe, <em>ibid.</em>) suggests as much, but does so by way of what surely must be considered a joke! After mentioning that he has never heard of the tradition of avoiding admixtures of fish and milk, and after noting that the passage referenced by the Bet Yosef mentions fish and <em>meat</em>, the Rema concludes that the Bet Yosef appears to have mixed meat and milk (ולכן נראה שנתערב לרב בית יוסף בשר בחלב).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14486&st=&pgnum=62\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Korei Dorot</em> Chapter 3</a> records the following story featuring <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Aboab_I\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mahari Abuhav</a> (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמרו על הרב מהר\"י אבוהב ז\"ל שהיתה עינו אחת סמויה...פעם אחד היה מהלך בדרך בשדה וישב לו הרב על שן סלע אחד, וב' נכבדים ישבו אחד מימין ואחד משמאל, והיה בחור אחד תלמידו עומד לפניהם, והרב ז\"ל בדיחא דעתיה והיו מדברים בדברי צחות, ופנה הרב אל התלמיד ואמר ליה אמור אתה, א\"ל תן לי רשות שאשב, א\"ל שב, ישב על האבן ואמר על אבן אחת שבעה עינים</p>\n<p>And they said about Rabbi Mahari Abuhav OB\"M that one of his eyes was blinded...one time he was walking on the way in a field and sat on a certain rock outcropping, and two honored [companions] sat on his right and left, and a certain young student of his was standing in front of them.

Rashi explains that there are different species of locusts one of which is called <em>arbeh</em>. He explains that this plague of locusts in Egypt was only of that species called <em>arbeh</em>. So, I'm assuming that the use of the definite article in your verse parallels this idea, that Moshe should cause <strong>the</strong> arbeh, meaning to exclude the other species of locusts.</p>\n\n<p>English has similar usage of the definitive article.

(We're looking to make a rollable \"mat\", like the reed ones, but out of 1x2 or 1x3 lumber)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to the Rambam, who is basing himself on an explicit <em>Mishnah</em> and both <em>Talmudhim</em> (i.e. <em>Bavli</em> and <em>Yerushalmi</em>), it is completely <em>mutar</em> to use such lumber.</p>\n\n<p>In <em>Hilkhoth Sukkah</em> 5:6-8 (according to the numbering of the Yemenite editions), the Rambam writes that it is permitted to use the shafts of arrows as <em>sekhakh</em>, as long as they are the \"male\"-ended ones, rather than the \"female\"-ended ones - into which an arrowhead can be placed - since it then is considered to have a <em>bayith qibbul</em> and is therefore subject to <em>tum'ah</em>. Substances subject to <em>tum'ah</em> is one of the invalidating factors of <em>sekhakh</em> (cf. <em>Hilkhoth Sukkah</em> 5:1).</p>\n\n<p>In 5:8, the Rambam says explicitly that planed boards are valid for use as <em>sekhakh</em>, as long as either their width or thickness does not exceed <em>arba` tefahim</em> (approx. 12 inches) since boards wider than that could be mistakenly construed to be like a roof (i.e. <em>bal tiqrah</em>) and people may mistakenly reason that they can be <em>yosse yedhei hovatham</em> by sitting in their own homes. Whether they are pressure-treated or not does not seem to have any bearing on their viability as <em>sekhakh</em>. The treating of wood with oils, saps, and other substances is very ancient in the history of wood preservation. The need to keep it from rotting, decaying, or being eaten by worms - and thereby weakening - was of central importance. See <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=history%20of%20chemically%20preserving%20wood&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCgQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fcda%2Fcontent%2Fdocument%2Fcda_downloaddocument%2F9783540415800-c1.pdf%3FSGWID%3D0-0-45-75297-p1488337&ei=kdjHVOvULIatyQSX1oGAAw&usg=AFQjCNFEXF-lWzxTMdfsWFl-_8_Sr6huYw&sig2=OQzwLFmdiF4oWEcNS3abuw&bvm=bv.84349003,d.aWw\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for a discussion of various practices. Since it seems that wood treatment was common in the times of Hazal and the Rishonim, and they did not mention it as a concern for the use of boards and arrows as <em>sekhakh</em>, it seems that we do not need to take it into account either.</p>\n\n<p>This type of <em>sekhakh</em>, especially that of furring strips as you describe, has come back into use recently and many in both <em>Eress Yisra'el</em> and in the <em>Golah</em> use them. </p>\n\n<p>While it is true that the <em>Shulhan Arukh</em> was <em>mahmir</em> and brought the <em>shittah</em> of the Semag that since roofs in his time were made out of such planed boards, one should not use boards for <em>sekhakh</em>, lest it be seen as a roof (<em>bal tiqrah</em>) - in our times roofs are made of plywood, plaster, shingles, etc. and one would not become confused by such boards any longer. This reasoning was given to me by several of my teachers - may they live and be well - regarding this question.</p>\n\n<p>See the <em>`Arokh HaShulhan</em>, <em>Hilkhoth Sukkah</em>, <em>Siman</em> 629:31-32 for a discussion of the relevant sources and the opinion of HaRav Epshtein z\"l regarding the issue of use of boards and planks of all widths - there he seems to go even further and prohibit the use of even thin strips of wood due to the fact that to him (apparently in his locale in Lita) they appeared like a roof (i.e. <em>bal tiqrah</em>), however the Rambam's clear statements in 5:9 seems to alleviate these concerns which have their origination in the words of the Semag and not Hazal at all, who even permit one to sit in his home as long as he detaches the roof boards of his house from the walls, they (of course) meet the width requirements, he resets them over his house, and the boards do not have any plaster or mortar on them.</p>\n\n<p>To answer your question specifically regarding the mats, such mats are explicitly permitted when made out of <em>qanim</em> (cf. 5:7), but there is no indication that the use of narrow boards would be any different. To the contrary, <em>le-`aniyuth da'ati</em>, since cane mats made for sleeping or lying upon are not kosher for <em>sekhakh</em> since they retain the status of a <em>keli</em>, a mat made from thin boards would be all the better since no one uses such \"mats\" for any kind of sitting or lying at all - making it plain to all that your intention is for <em>sekhakh</em> alone.</p>\n\n<p>Just make sure that the twine you use is a completely natural substance that is approved of by the modern <em>poseqim</em> for such purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n",

O.C. 167:1 with Magen Avrohom 3).  This cut should be made such that it is not deep enough that were you to lift the smaller part the larger part would not come up with it (ibid).  However, that is only for actually cutting into the bread.  When the bread is cut this way, there is a concern that one may come to cut too deeply and separate the bread such that it is no longer one piece of bread.  That being the case, on Shabbos when there is an additional concern of Lechem Mishna, we'd rather not risk it, and therefore it is best to not do so on Shabbos (Rema ibid with Magen Avrohom 5).  The Kaf HaChaim (167:7) implies from the Rosh that with soft or thin bread, there is no need to make any slice into the bread.</p>\n\n<p>What you may have seen done is actually not really cutting into the bread.  We (I include myself among those who have this practice) merely make a mark, as you indicated in your question. The source for making the mark is the Magen Avrohom (O.C. 274:1, citing the Bach citing the Maharshal). One supercommentary there suggests the reason for the mark is still based on minimizing the interruption (Levushei S'rad to Magen Avrohom 274:1). Another (Machazis Hashekel to Magen Avraham 274:1, s.v. המדקדקים) says the concern is to avoid the interruption of finding a place to cut and measuring off the correct sized piece of bread after the blessing. While this may seem like a negligible amount of time, I suggest that the concern is based on that which the Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 167:1, 274:2) writes, that on weekdays you should not cut off a piece larger than a <em>kezayis</em> because it is gluttenous.  The Rema, as explained by Magen Avrohom 6, writes that you need to give a <em>kazayis</em> of bread <em>from the piece which you cut off</em> to each person at the meal.  Therefore, you need to make sure that the piece you are cutting off is big enough to divvy up from it a <em>kazayis</em> sized piece to all present, but on weekdays not larger than that. Therefore, for those who follow this opinion, it is quite reasonable that this measuring, if done after the blessing, could take several seconds of estimation, and therefore is better to be done (and marked) before the blessing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rechovot.blogspot.com/2009/08/beit-midrash-vs-shul-theory-vs-practice.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Mordechai Torczyner has a nice blog post about it</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We want to minimize the interruption between reciting HaMotzi and eating the bread, but we also want to recite the berachah upon a whole loaf, if possible, to show respect for the berachah. So when do we actually cut the bread?</p>\n<p>Early sources ... felt that cutting the bread does not constitute a significant interruption. Others agree, particularly with thin-crusted bread like ours. Nonetheless, some suggest one should satisfy the “interruption” concern by starting to cut the bread - without cutting too deeply - before reciting HaMotzi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize his conclusion: The Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 167:1 discusses this. Many, many sources write that on Shabbos, it's actually better to not \"pre-score\" the bread. However, in the yeshiva world it's taught to always pre-score the bread, probably for consistency throughout the week.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I have heard that it is because the bread is supposed to be ready to eat, but at the same time, hamotzi should be made on a whole loaf. The compromise is to make a small slice, so that it's \"cut\", but still whole.</p>\n\n<p>Going to try and find sources soon.</p>\n\n\n",

For more on Reform theology, look up Samuel Holdheim and Abraham Geiger.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To me, I don't think you can really quantify \"Reform Jewish theology\". It's really dependent on the individual Reform Jew. Unlike in traditional Judaism, there really isn't a \"creed\" per se (I'm thinking of the Rambam's principles), people just think whatever seems best to them. </p>\n\n<p>You will find Reform Jews who are atheist and believe the entire Torah was written by men, and you will find Reform Jews who believe the Torah was given by G-d, but was amended afterwards. I wouldn't be surprised to find a Reform Jew who believed the Torah was unchanged since Moshe, but chose not to follow it for x-y-z reasons. </p>\n\n<p>Reform Judaism puts a lot of emphasis on the cultural aspects of Judaism. So, it's not really important what you believe. To Reform Judaism, pretty much anything flies as long as you're a moral person and are active in your community.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I am not a Reform Jew. If we have any Reform Jews on here, please comment and tell me why you agree or disagree. I only have experience with the Reform Jews I run into and chat with, and the things I've read in the newspaper from the local Reform synagogue.</p>\n\n\n",

According to a strict interpretation (such as is followed in modern-day Saudi Arabia), women are not allowed to leave the house on their own, must be (fully) covered, and are generally required to submit to their \"dominant male\".</p>\n\n<p>Christianity gives women some more free reign. From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Christianity#Women_in_church_history\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Christianity#Women_in_church_history</a>, it appears that while women historically were not appointed to high positions, they were certainly considered people in their own right, and did not have the restrictions mentioned above. See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/46171/what-is-the-source-for-rav-soloveitchiks-assertion-that-1st-century-christians\">What is the source for Rav Soloveitchik's assertion that 1st Century Christians introduced mixed seating for prayers?</a></p>\n\n<p>Now that we've clarified some of the surrounding culture, let's move on to the Jewish sources.</p>\n\n<p>The classic position held by Ashkenazim is that even if women are exempt, they are still allowed to make the bracha. Sefardic poskim hold that she should not make the bracha. The classic source for this is <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.17.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA OC 17:2</a>, where the Rama has to point out that women should say the bracha on tzitzit.</p>\n\n<p>(Interestingly, this position seems to be sort of reversed when it comes to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28701/what-do-sephardic-sources-have-to-say-about-women-wearing-tfilin\">women wearing tefillin</a> - Ashkenazim discourage them from wearing it (while still allowing the bracha if she does), while Sephardim don't discourage it (but also without allowing a bracha).)</p>\n\n<p>I don't have a source for this, but i have heard that while Ashkenazi women are supposed to follow the standard text of davening, Sfardi women just make up a prayer from the heart once a day.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the two things i just mentioned, and there are probably more, it seems that Ashkenazi women take a bigger role in communal/religious life than Sfardi women.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any sources that indicate that the positions on women were influenced by the surrounding culture?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://haemtza.blogspot.com/2012/07/yct-and-psycho-social-method-of-psak.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Yosef Gavriel Bechhofer debated this point</a> (or at least the extent of it) with Rabbi Dov Linzer of Yeshiva Chovevei Torah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the course of the debate, as a further example of his methodology, Rabbi Linzer discussed the permissibility of women reciting berachos on mitzvos aseh she'ha'zman grama. This is the subject of a machlokes between Rabbeinu Tam, who permits, and the Rambam, who forbids. This machlokes is formalized in current practice, in which women affiliated with Ashkenazic communities do recite berachos on mitzvos aseh she'ha'zman grama, while women affiliated with Sepharadic communities do not.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Linzer explained the machlokes thus: The Rambam lived in the misogynistic environment of countries dominated by Islam. Accordingly, his psak reflects the attitudes he absorbed from his environment. Rabbeinu Tam, on the other hand, lived in the more enlightened (proto-feminist) environment of Christendom. Accordingly, his psak reflects the attitudes that he absorbed from his contrary environment.</p>\n  \n  <p>I countered that the machlokes is very straightforward: Whether the nusach of asher kideshanu b'mitzvosav v'tzivanu applies to the individual – in which case it does not apply to women, and who therefore may not be – or whether it applies to the nation as a whole, in which case a woman may recite this nusach on a mitzvas aseh she'ha'zman grama.</p>\n  \n  <p>(I also noted that the psycho-sociological analysis is flawed, as Rabbeinu Tam is responsible for the most regressive “anti-feminist” law in our system [overturning, in the process, the law as hitherto established by the Gaonim] – viz., that a woman cannot compel her husband to give her a get on the basis of the simple her assertion that she finds it impossible to live with him, for perhaps she is lying and only initiated the divorce proceedings because eineha nasna b'acher.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is snow Kosher? Icicles?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The recent snow storm got me thinking about this. So are you allowed to eat snow? What about icicles?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I wish that I could locate a definitive source to answer your question, but, in a way, the answer seems a rather obvious \"yes it is kosher. My deduction:</p>\n\n<p>Almost all drinking water occurs \"naturally\". If you or anyone else has hiked into a forest or anywhere that has a spring, esp. in the beginning of the Spring season, that water originated from snow that melted and seeped into the ground or flowed into a stream or river. Along the way, who knows what else may have gone into that stream - traces of animal feces, microorganisms (amoeba, hydra, etc.), perhaps traces of non-kosher pork chops from a camper's barbecue next to a stream somewhere. People either drink from the stream directly, or if buying bottled water, they're drinking that.</p>\n\n<p>If you're wondering why does bottled water have a heksher, I asked someone from the OU a while ago and he explained that it has to do with the processing plant which may process other non-kosher products in the same plant. But spring water itself needs no heksher.</p>\n\n<p>If you drink tap water, there's no heksher on that. (Yes, I know that there have been attempts to get one on NYC tap water, but so far, those efforts failed.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to make a \"kal vachomer\" in a way. If you're essentially drinking melted snow without a heksher, I think that whole unmelted snow doesn't need one. Granted, I don't recommend eating \"dirty\" snow from the street and certainly not from the road. Personally, the concern with such dirty snow is not its heksher but far worse - I don't recommend drinking a slush mix of gasoline and calcium chloride.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is textual rabbinic evidence for the consumption of snow, and therefore its permissibility.</p>\n<p>Eikhah 4:7</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זכו נזיריה משלג צחו מחלב אדמו עצם מפנינים ספיר גזרתם</p>\n<p>Her Nazirites were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their appearance\nwas ruddier than gems, their form, a sapphire</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%94_%D7%93_%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eikhah Rabbah 4:10</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זכו נזיריה משלג אלו שהיו שותין את השלג</p>\n<p>Her Nazirites were purer than snow for they would consume snow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Meshekh_Chokhmah%2C_Eikhah.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meshekh Hokhmah</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מדרש זכו נזיריה משלג אלו שהיו שותין את השלג. פירוש שהיו נשמרין לאכול\nעל טהרת תרומה טהרת הקודש... והשלג אינו מקבל טומאה שאינו אוכל ולא משקה כמפורש פ' כל\nהיד (נדה י\"ז ע\"א), לכן שתו השלג.</p>\n<p>The Midrash stating \"Her Nazirites were purer than snow for they would\nconsume snow\" the explanation for this is that they were careful in\ntheir consumption <em>'al taharath terumah taharath ha-qodesh</em>... and\nimpurity does not devolve upon snow, since it is neither food nor\ndrink as is explained in <em>Pereq Kol ha-Yad</em> (Niddah 17a), accordingly\nthey would consume the snow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also H. <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=10&hilchos=61&perek=1&halocha=22&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tumath Okhalin 1:22</a></p>\n<p>From the fact that a Nazir, whose diet is even more restricted than most, we see that consuming snow is not only permissible but under certain halakhic circumstances may even be preferred.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Just to add a source to the excellent answers above: Iyov 9:30 seems to make the point that snow is kosher, and especially pure:</p>\n<p>‘Even if I bathed in liquid snow, and were pure down to my hands, You would plunge me into the pit until even my clothes detested me.’ (Koren translation).</p>\n\n\n",

The Torah itself informs us that prophecy would continue after Moses and gives us commandments on how to recognize a true prophet (Deut. 18:15-22).  Inclusion in the canon (the only books we would consider Biblical) is a recognition that the work was written under some degree of prophetic inspiration and that it has a general application to the Jewish people. That the work/prophet does not transgress the prohibition of adding or subtracting from the Torah is a prerequisite, and tradition records that a great deal of effort was placed in reconciling apparent contradiction in Ezekiel with Torah law before it was finally accepted.</p>\n\n<p>I will attempt to beef up the sources as I am able.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The prohibition to add or subtract to the Bible was concerning the laws as commanded by God, not concerning the amount of books we concider holy, as per Seffer Hachinuch #454 and #455 quoting Yad HaChazaka chapter two of Mamrim. There was always an allowance for prophets to enforce those laws, as seen for instance in Deuteronomy 18:15 God will set up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren. There is never found an admonition not to canonize those prophets words for all generations, and they were in fact kept specifically for this purpose as seen in the Talmud Megila 14a. On that same page we find the single instance of a commandment which was added based on an understanding from the books of Moses.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, any man, no matter how great, who stands up and claims that through prophecy he has a new law to add to the old, or that he is subtracting a law is called a false prophet, Yad HaChazaka Yisodei HaTorah chapter 8. An allowance is given for him to to say prophecy which temporarily adds or subtracts to the original laws, but not permanently. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>After entering the land of Israel under Joshua, had the Jewish people kept the commandments and not turned to idolatry, the \"bible\" would have consisted of only the Torah (first 5 books) and the book of Joshua (because it contained the details of the division of the land amongst the tribes).  But because the Jewish people sinned, the bible included the other books.  I will try to find the source for this and update my answer.</p>\n\n<p>The source is the Overview to the ArtScroll edition of the Book of Joshua (ArtScroll Tanach Series).  It states that \"Nedarim 22b teaches that ... Had Israel not sinned, only the Torah and the Book of Joshua would have been given to them; the Book of Joshua would have been given because it contains the boundaries of the tribal portions of Eretz Yisrael - information of divine origin and is essential to the nation.\"</p>\n\n<p>The other books, consisting mostly of the rebukings of the prophets, would have been unnecessary.

However, if part of it remains unpeeled, or if it has already been mixed with any other food, it may be eaten (Kaf Hachaim OC 504:1; YD 116:92). Some, therefore, add salt to remove this prohibition (See Tzitz Eliezer 18:46; Minchas Yitzchak 6:75).</p>\n  \n  <p>There is a machlokes as to whether cooking it helps. The Darkei Teshuva (116:74) and R’ Shmuel Wosner (Shevet Halevi 3:169) writes that it doesn’t apply once it’s been cooked, though other poskim hold that it is only a problem when cooked (See Minchas Yitzchak 4:108).</p>\n  \n  <p>There is a further machlokes as to whether commercial cooks and bakers need to be concerned for this. While the Klausenberger Rebbe (Divrei Yatziv YD 1:31) and Chelkas Yaakov (3:YD 39) rule stringently, the consensus of poskim is to be lenient (Igros Moshe YD 3:20; Shevet Halevi 3:169; 6:11; Minchas Yitzchak 2:68; Yabia Omer YD 2:7).\n  While R’ Ovadia Yosef (Yabia Omer YD 2:7) allows such foods that were left overnight to be eaten, others (Chelkas Yaakov YD 39) write that they should be discarded (See Minchas Yitzchak 2:68; 9:28).</p>\n  \n  <p>This halacha is not mentioned in the Rif, Rambam or the Shulchan Aruch and even some later poskim including the Pischei Teshuva and Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, likely because they held that this evil spirit no longer exists (See Lechem Mishne, Hilchos Shevisas Asor 3:2; Teshuvos Pri Hasadeh 3:61).</p>\n  \n  <p>Nonetheless, it is mentioned by many of the poskim including the Rosh (Betzah 1:21), Pri Chadash (116), Shulchan Aruch Harav (Shemiras Haguf Vehanefesh 7) and Aruch Hashulchan (YD 116:22).</p>\n  \n  <p>There is, therefore, a machlokes as to whether one who hasn’t kept this halacha needs to at all. The Darkei Teshuva (116:74) quotes sources on both sides, though R’ Moshe Feinstein (YD 3:20), R’ Yitzchok Weiss (Minchas Yitzchak 2:68:13), R’ Ovadia Yosef (Yabia Omer YD 2:7) both write that one should ideally observe this custom. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

While we were discussing different meats, one of the jokers in school asked if you could eat a mermaid, since it would have scales and fins. Would it be possible to eat one?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 50)\n\n<p>The Torah says that we may not eat anything without fins and scales if it is among the \"sea-life\" or of the \"beasts of the sea\" (Vaykira 11:10) which the Ramban thinks refers specifically to sea creatures that have two legs like those of land-creatures. Assuming that he's talking about mermaids, he implies that they have two legs, instead of fins, and are therefore not kosher. </p>\n\n<p>However, the mermaids that I've seen in Disney movies do not have legs, but do have scales and (I believe) fins. Raavad, though, in his commentary to Toras Kohanim (to the verse above) includes sirens (a.k.a. mermaids) in the list of non-kosher animals. As far as psak halacha, the Aruch Hashulchan (Y.D. 83:10) also states that mermaids are not kosher. His reasoning is that the Torah only permits <em>fish</em> that have fins and scales, and even if a mermaid were to have those features, she is not actually a fish. </p>\n\n<p>As always, be sure to contact your local orthodox rabbi if this becomes a matter of practical concern. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 23)\n\n<p>The gemara in Bechoros 8a, which discusses mermaids, says they can be impregnated by people. As such, they would be non-kosher due to the qualification found there (Bech. 7b) a kosher fish lays eggs and a non-kosher fish births a live creature. This is the simple understanding found in the pirushim on the Tosefta (1:5) there. </p>\n\n<p>Tosafos there complicates things for this discussion by bringing a gemara in Avoda Zara 40a where both kosher and non-kosher fish lay eggs, but at the very least it is the non-kosher fish there whose eggs are impregnated internally, so that would still work with the understanding here.</p>\n\n<p>As per Matt's request to quote some poskim I'll quote the Machklokes brought in Darkei Tshuva 83:5. He quotes the Halachos Kitanos 2:5 who says someone brought him a humanoid fish with arms and legs and fins and scales, he ruled that it was not kosher as only creatures that <em>look like fish</em> with these signs are kosher. The D.T. goes on to quote a Shiurei Bracha who quotes this Halachos Kitanos and argues with him, setting out the position that any sea creature with fins and scales is kosher. The Darkei Tshuva does not side with either opinion, seemingly leaving the question of whether or not 'fins and scales' help to permit any and all sea creatures as a machlokes.</p>\n\n\n",

This strongly implies that there's no biblical obligation to study these laws. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Aruch Hashulchan (there) writes that he finds this ruling difficult, as the Gemara (Megillah 19, Brachos 5a) indicates that even the rabbinic laws were told to Moshe at Sinai</li>\n<li><strong>R. Ahron Leib Shteinman</strong>, (Ayeles Hashachar to Nedarim 37a) writes that although this halacha indicates that studying rabbinic laws such as eiruvin or channukah wouldn't fulfill the mitzvah of Talmud Torah, he writes that this is not the case. Perhaps the mitzvah really is fulfilled, but the rule of teaching Torah without pay doesn't apply because Moshe himself never 'taught' these laws. </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>According to Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah (Brachos 11b), one only makes a bracha on studying Talmud or the like because it is an explanation of the Written Torah. (Based on this, the Aruch Hashulchan (47:8) is hesitant to make a bracha on studying <em>aggados</em>, because they do not explain any scriptural verses.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It would appear, therefore, that studying laws which do not explain scripture (such as the laws of Chanukah) are not subject to <em>birkas haTorah</em>, probably because Rabbeinu Yonah felt that such study cannot be considered <em>talmud Torah d'oraisa</em></li>\n<li>However, the Eshel Avraham (47:2) writes based on the Rambam that one does make a bracha on studying purely rabbinic laws as well (could this be a dispute between Rambam and Rabbeinu Yonah?)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Besides for R. Shteinman, here are the words of R. Soloveitchik as recorded in שעירוים לזכר אבא מרי ז\"ל, pg 253:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האם נאמר למשל כי מכיון שמצות מגילה היא רק מד\"ס גם הלכות מגילה אינן מוטבעות בחותמה של תורה שבע\"פ דבר תורה ומסכת מגילה מהווה חפצא של תורה רק מדבריהם שמדאורייתא אין בה חלות תורה כלל וכלל... שהלומד אותה אינו מקיים מצות תלמוד תורה מדאורייתא כי הלא כל הדברים שמסכת זו עסוקה בהם אינם אלא רשות דבר תורה? ...נראה פשוט כי התפיסה השניה נכונה וכי כל דיני מצוות דרבנן חפצא של תורה הויין ואין שום הבדל ביניהם לבין הלכות מילה או חמש הלכות שחיטה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Soloveitchik then shows how this is evident from the Rambam (Hil. Mamrim 1) who includes the laws made by the rabbis as <em>התורה אשר יורוך</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Building on this principle, <strong>Rabbi Zvi/Hershel Schachter</strong> writes in Nefesh Harav (pg. 41) that these laws become an integral part of the Torah itself, and therefore studying them is very much a fulfillment of the Biblical command. He relates this to the rule that כל דתקון רבנן כעין דאורייתא תקון, the rabbis pattern their enactments similar to the ways of the Torah, because it's all one inter-related package. In person, I've heard him take this a step further: there are times when one can understand a biblical law better because we can extrapolate from a detail in a rabbinic law which was patterned after the biblical one (he pointed to Kovetz he'Aros of R. Elchanan Wasserman, no. 66 for examples). We therefore see that even rabbinic enactments can indirectly clarify scriptural verses, perhaps answering the problem posed by the implication from Rabbeinu Yonah above.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch HaRav writes in Hilchos Talmud Torah (<a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh5/6/2/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:1</a>) that the obligation to study Torah includes דיקדוקי סופרים, which Rashi (<a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh5/6/2/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Succah 28a</a>) defines as Rabbinic enactments.</p>\n\n<p>(Note that, pace the Aruch Hashulchan, he paskens (<a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/6/47/2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 47:2</a>) that Birchas HaTorah applies to Medrash as well).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Additional evidence that one doesn't fulfill a biblical obligation can be adduced from Rambam's opinion that one is obligated to teach his son specifically the written law (Hil.

This would imply that one's personal biblical obligation to study also includes only the written law.</p>\n\n<p>Maharam Shik himself however assumes that the obligation to teach students, and presumably one's personal obligation <strong>does</strong> include the oral law, and therefore doesn't understand Rambam's ruling about teaching specifically the written law. </p>\n\n\n",

Why is it that it is accepted that she wasn't a harlot but an innkeeper and someone who sold mezonot (wheat).\nSome opinions that I read  say because she made herself available to everyone as she sold many provisions and because she was an innkeeper  (\" הַזּוֹנָה\").  </p>\n\n<p>I just want to know why we cannot take this literally? It says it quite a few times. Why couldn't the Torah just say that she was a provisioner or an innkeeper?</p>\n\n<p>And I know not everything is made to be taken literally in the Torah, like 'an eye for an eye'.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<ul>\n<li>Targum Yonassan followed by Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Joshua.2.1.4\">2:1</a>) explain that she was an inkeeper (that \"zona\" in this context relates to the word \"mazon\" for bread).</li>\n<li>Radak explains that she was actually a prostitute and that even Targum agrees, and that sometimes Targum uses the term for innkeeper to mean harlot.</li>\n<li>Abarbanel writes that the two explanation arent mutually exclusive and that the secondary role of an innkeeper was usually being a prostitute</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>The Talmud Bavli (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=29&daf=116b&format=pdf\">Zevachim 116b</a>, top) states quite plainly that she was a harlot:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דאמר מר: אין לך כל שר ונגיד שלא בא על רחב הזונה. אמרו: בת י' שנים היתה כשיצאו ישראל ממצרים, וזנתה [כל] מ' שנה שהיו ישראל במדבר, אחר נ' שנה נתגיירה, אמרה: יהא מחול לי בשכר חבל חלון ופשתים. </p>\n  \n  <p>[A]s a master said, There was no prince or ruler who had not possessed Rahab the harlot. It was said: She was ten years old when the Israelites departed from Egypt, and she played the harlot the whole of the forty years spent by the Israelites in the wilderness. At the age of fifty she became a proselyte. Said she: May I be forgiven as a reward for the cord, window, and flax. (For hiding them in flax, and then letting them down by a cord through a window (ibid. 6, 15).)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<em>Soncino translation</em>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There is a basic idea that whenever we have an opportunity to say good about a good person, we will. Likewise whenever there is the opportunity to say bad about a bed person we will. Rachav was a nice lady, professed a deep belief in and fear of God. She endangered herself to save the Jewish spies. As such she qualifies for chazzal and our mipharshim to find a way to explain the things said about her as meaning something nice. </p>\n\n<p>As an aside it is not universally accepted that she was dealing with mezonos, but it is widely mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Here's a third explenation for the word zona in this type of context. Rabbeinu Bichaya in Parshas Masei 36:8 says it means a women who had no brothers who married out of her tribe. By doing so her father's inheritance is lost from the tribe, and she would be called zona, as we find Yiphtach bring called the son of a zona, Shophtim 11:1.</p>\n\n\n",

For instance: the prevailing custom had been (in his world) to write only the Hebrew date on a tombstone, and suddenly many people wanted the secular (i.e. Gregorian) date on there as well. He fiercely resisted this change. Yet we have documents/letters where he used the Gregorian date.

If the clothing is not wearable because it is sticking so badly, (even if the reason is because now it isn’t tznius), then using the static guard is considered fixing it on shabbos and problematic.</p>\n<p>The second issue is if the static guard has a scent. Then it may not be sprayed onto one’s clothing on Shabbos because it is scenting the clothing, which is milod reicha( creating a scent in the clothing) , and not something we do on Shabbos. Putting water directly onto one’s clothing if it will make the clothing wet is also an issue of melabain. For this issue there is however an option, lightly wet your hands then brush them over the surface of your clothing to reduce the static cling.</p>\n<p>Have a good Shabbos</p>\n<p>Sources:\nסי’ תרנ”ח סעי’ ב’, “ואסור לסחוף כוס מבושם על הבגדים, משום דמוליד בהן ריחא” מ”ב (סי’ תרנ”ח ס”ק ז’, “דמוליד ריחא. בבגד והוי כתיקון מנא”, מ”ב ס’ שכב” ס”ק י”ח</p>\n\n\n",

Their halachic ruling is impeccable even if it would never actually apply in reality.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Slifkin addresses Mermaides, concluding that they are probably dolphins, in a post entitled \"<a href=\"https://www.rationalistjudaism.com/p/wisdom-of-artscroll?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2Fmermaid&utm_medium=reader2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Wisdom of ArtScroll</a>\" (for once, not sarcastically) which he features in his book Sacred Monsters.</p>\n<p>As a summary he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In brief: The Gemara provides a perfectly accurate account of dolphins. Rashi, however, for reasons that I discuss in my book, (mis)understood the Gemara to be referring to mermaids. Which, in the view of most (but not all) people, do not exist.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then quotes the Artscroll:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“There are marine animals,” writes Rashi, “half of whose bodies are of human form, and half in the form of a fish. They are called sereine in French.” Rashi clearly refers to mermen (the French sereine derives from Latin siren, meaning mermaid), whose existence was widely accepted in the ancient and medieval world and indeed until recent centuries. (According to Raavad in his commentary to Toras Kohanim 3:7, sirens are mentioned as well in Toras Kohanim ibid.) As understood by Rashi, then, the Baraisa teaches that humans and mermen can interbreed.</p>\n<p>Others suggest that the dolphins of the Baraisa are none other than the familiar dolphins of the order Cetaceans. These endothermic (warm-blooded) air-breathing mammals “reproduce as do humans” (following the variant kbnei adam) in that they copulate ventrum to ventrum (the manner ascribed to humans later in the Baraisa), bear live young, suckle their calves, and rear them intensively for six or seven years, to near adulthood. Dolphins were known by very similar names in the milieu of the Baraisa: Latin delphinus, from Greek delphis. Delphis is related to delphys, meaning womb, so that the genitive delphinos probably denoted [a sea creature] possessed of a womb; the very name dolfinin thus suggests that the animals in question “reproduce as do humans.” Rav Yehudah may have called dolphins sons (or people) of the sea because of their affinity for humans (they commonly approach and accompany boats), and because they often evince humanlike intelligence in their behaviors and social interactions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So to answer your question: mermaids are actually dolphins. Primarily found in the sea.</p>\n\n\n",

(For instance, the Talmud <em>seems</em> to say that certain kinds of fish are kosher because their parasitic worms do X, and now the scientists are saying that parasitic worms do Y.) There was one hyper-traditionalist Hungarian rabbi who felt that Chinese food was dangerous because it was newfangled and nontraditional!  Very few follow his opinion, put mildly. Many have opposed the Internet, but not because it was technological per se -- out of concerns of what it could do.</p>\n\n<p>So anytime new technology comes along, it's reasonable to ask, \"how does Jewish law and philosophy view this?\", and \"is it wise for us to adopt this with arms wide open?\" But that doesn't mean ban it outright.</p>\n\n<p>I have heard that there are some Hassidic individuals who drive cars, use cell phones, and the like; but will only wear a mechanical pocketwatch, not a quartz wristwatch, as they prefer that <em>their personal dress</em> follow tradition.

In response, Rabbi Moshe Heinemann of Baltimore (a man who was frequently spotted tinkering with his car engine in between Talmud classes) worked with engineers at the appliance companies to add in programming for a \"Sabbath mode\" -- you enter the right key combination, and suddenly the oven is programmed to behave like a 1950s model.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'm unaware of any rabbi that completely banned the use of modern technology for whatever was \"modern\" in their time.

Why? Because he has (I think) 3 deaf kids with implants. Then he wrote a few significant books on the subject. I guess he could have easily rejected the use of implants altogether and had his kids use ASL, but because he didn't, he benefitted not just his family, but numerous others since he wrote about his halachic findings.</p>\n\n<p>I need not list the thousands of medical inventions, esp. many of them invented in Israel, that have saved lives - sonograms, MRI's, etc. What \"honest\" rav would reject using these?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I have often seen a team of rabbanim state outright to others, \"Don't use the internet for any reason at any time.\" Several years ago, they even had a huge \"rally\" in Shea Stadium (or was it Citifield, by then.) Yep, an \"anti-internet\" rally. One huge problem - Guess how these same rabbanim advertised the event? Yup!

    "content": "# Why are observant Jews so reluctant to admit that Chazal could ever make mistakes?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have great respect for many of our sages of blessed memory, but there seems to be a tendency among Jews to refuse to admit the possibility that they could have ever made mistakes.  I have been grappling with this question as I was trying unsuccessfully to write an answer to a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/53255/3483\">this recent question</a>.  It is extremely hard to speak of the fallibility of our sages in a socially acceptable way.</p>\n\n<p>One way to see this is to look at some of the reasoning on why we no longer follow Talmudic medicine. You often find something along the lines of the reasons given by the Maharil, that the descriptions are unclear, that we cannot understand what they mean, that if we tried it and did it wrong one might come to belittle the sages.</p>\n\n<p>I almost never see an orthodox rabbi say: they were men who worked with the knowledge that was available at the time. They tried to apply Jewish principles to the world as they understood it, but they may have been mistaken in specific facts about the world.</p>\n\n<p>The notion that any human could be infallible bothers me. I would gladly agree that Chazal were righteous, intelligent people with much integrity. I would also agree that is not good for people like us who have lesser moral qualities to criticize those who are greater than us, but does this mean that it is wrong to make respectful observations that such-and-such person was wrong about one particular issue that we can now understand in a completely different way? So they didn't know anything about germ theory or which creatures were real and which were mythical. Why is that so bad to say? Why do we tie ourselves in knots to avoid saying that they could be wrong occasionally?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The book Torah Chazal And Science by R. Dr. Moshe Meiselman goes through the topic at great length (e.g. p. 33-4). His main thesis is that the primary approach of Jewish authorities through the ages has been to treat all <strong>undisputed</strong> statements of Chazal as correct.  He asserts that they assumed that just like in the halachic arena in which Chazal were clearly fallible as evidenced by their many disputes and the proofs brought against them, their conclusion is assumed to be correct and binding, so too in other matters although we know that they were fallible, we assume that their conclusions reflect truth.\nHe cites several examples of this and manages to present almost every statement to the contrary in Geonim or Rishonim as being somehow limited to the matter at hand.\nBesides asserting that this approach is the traditional one, he asserts that as such this constitutes our Mesorah from which we will only deviate with absolutely indisputable evidence.\nsee also <a href=\"http://slifkinchallenge.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> where this opinion is discussed (albeit in a sometimes acerbic tone).</p>\n\n\n",

Not only that, they will skip to the next line right in the middle of a word. It is SO much more difficult to read a text this way. And if I had to guess as to one of the major reasons the Jews adopted the Ashurit font is because it has final ending letters. These final endings letters are usually the most common ending letters for words, whether they be nouns or verb conjugations.  By having mem-sofit, nun sofit, kaf sofit, etc. you are able to read a text that has no spaces much easier. Even today we have proven that in modern languages most people read words by quickly reading the first letter and last letter of a word</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn’t mttaer\nin waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is\ntaht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae.

Tihs is\nbcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the\nwrod as a wlohe.</p>\n<p>This paragraph was circulated on the Internet several years ago. The\nphenomenon it describes, known as typoglycemia, is the ability to\nunderstand words when the first and last letters are stable, but the\nintermediate letters are scrambled. Your brain puts the letters back\ninto a sequence again.</p>\n<p>According to Ashwini Nadkarni, MD, director of Digital Integrated Care\nin Psychiatry and Instructor at Harvard Medical School, typoglycemia\nis a neologism (a newly coined word) made up from the prefix “typo”\nand the suffix “glycemia.” Typoglycemia enables us to recognize words\nby matching inner letter content guided by a few clues, such as\nexterior letters. “As long as the exterior letters of the words remain\nthe same, typoglycemia captures our preserved ability to comprehend\nthem,” she says. \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://observer.com/2017/03/chunking-typoglycemia-brain-consume-information/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://observer.com/2017/03/chunking-typoglycemia-brain-consume-information/</a></p>\n<p>When you have the ending letters of \"ךםןףץ\" you are able to quickly identify first letters and last letters of words when there are no spaces.\n\"בניםשלךבחוץ\" . In this sentence with no spaces you can quickly tell the first word ends with mem, and the next word begins with shin. You can also quickly tell the word that begins with shin ands with khaf, and that the last word begins with bet and ends with tzaddi all because of those ending letters.</p>\n<p>Therefore my argument is as follows. The Torah was originally Given in K'tav Ivri, which most semitic cultures in the time and area used without any kind of spacing. When the Jews went to Babylon and were introduced to the Ashurit script that contains ending letters, they adopted it because it made literacy much easier for most people. By adopting Ashurit they opened the door for more people to be able to read and understand the Torah, not just a specific scholar or  scribal class. And then as time went on, as most languages started adding spaces, Jews themselves also started adding spaces, even though it makes the final letters superfluous now.</p>\n\n\n",

Many languages have no \"gender neutral\" pronoun that can be applied to a human being or an animal with a sexual identity. That is, \"it\" refers to something inanimate and cannot be used for a being. Thus it does not have a term that can refer to Hashem. English does not have a gender neutral pronoun like \"heesh\".</p>\n\n<p>Spanish and Hebrew (for example) must refer all object with a masculine or feminine pronoun (as for example at <a href=\"http://spanish.about.com/od/nouns/a/gender_inherent.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gender, an Inherent Characteristic of Spanish Nouns</a>) even for objects. Indeterminate or mixed nouns also use the masculine form.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, the listed prophets (male and female) are only those whose prophesies were meant for future generations. We see from the incident of Chizkiyahu consulting Chuldah that a prophet could be male or female and the fact was not considered unusual. the only question that arose was why he did not consult Yirmiyahu who was the leading prophet of that generation. We also see from the fact that Devorah was the Judge of the nation and from Miriam sister of Moshe that a female prophet was accepted as normal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to Jewish tradition, there was not a \"group of intermediary humans who wrote the Tanach.\"</p>\n<p>The Rambam in his 13 fundamentals of Jewish faith, in the introduction to the 10th chapter of Sanhedrin, in the 8th principle, writes the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כלומר שהגיע אליו כולה מאת ה' הגעה שקורין אותה על דרך השאלה דבור</p>\n<p>Which means to say that the entire Torah reached Moshe from G-d on a level which we call \"speech\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The entire Torah was dictated, at the pinnacle of clarity, by G-d to Moshe.

The actual commandment is \"Do not Murder\" not \"Do not Kill\". Your question implies that one may not even kill in sef-defense which is untrue.</p>\n\n<p>That is, you start the question \"Is it allowed to kill\" which implies under any circumstances and connect it with the settling of the land. This makes it sound as if causing any death (of any human being) for any reason is forbidden. You also do not show my you ask about \"settling the land\" with respect to this alleged violation of the sixth commandment. Are you saying that because the Israeli army must fight and kill during a war, they are violating the sixth commandment?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> The question has been changed to now address the question of \"Mitzvah Haba Ba'aveirah\" This will require a different answer.</p>\n\n<p>Given that one is attempting to fulfill a prophesy and not actually obeying the command of a Navi (such as Eliyahu on Har Carmel) , it is forbidden to violate halacha in order to do so. For example, if one thought fulfilling a prophesy to resettle in Eretz Yisrael by taking an airplane on shabbos, then one would be forbidden to do so (unless an actual navi came and made a one time prophesy). If someone claimed to be a navi and attempted to claim that one no longer had to keep shabbos to fly to Eretz Yisrael (or to drive to shul on shabbos) then he would be a navi sheker.</p>\n\n<p>It is not a matter of the fact that the isur of murder is in the Aseres Hadibros (I prefer Ten Statements to Ten Commandments) but that it is one of the 613 Mitzvos. The made up situation would not apply as unless there was a direct revelation from Hashem (and a person would not get such a revelation unless he was already at the level of Moshe Rabbeinu) there is no way to allow such a violation.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, such a necessity is only when someone is faced with a direct and immediate problem such as Yael seducing Sisra in order to be able to kill him or Shmuel mandating that all of Amalek be killed (and killing Agag at the direct command of Hashem).

This focus effect was noticed to work for more than a mile near small bodies of water. That was as far as we were measuring, but it seemed like it could work for larger distances. I don't know the geography of the Jerusalem/Jericho region, but a cool pocket of air near the ground between them might have had the effect of focusing the sound.

The one-off gig turned out to be a <em>probeh</em>, an audition, and he was offered the job of full-time rabbi.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>From a Rabbinic Search <a href=\"http://www.yicherryhill.com/rabbinic_search.shtml#ProbehSchedule\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">notice</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...

I have only ever heard it in this specific context - rabbinic audition.</p>\n\n<p>What language is this word from? Yiddish?</p>\n\n<p>What is its etymology and derivation?</p>\n\n<p>How far back does its usage go in this context?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p><em>פּראָבעה</em> is apparently a Yiddish word meaning \"test\" or \"tryout\". See <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/#yi/en/%D7%A4%D6%BC%D7%A8%D7%90%D6%B8%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%94\">Google Translate</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I don't actually speak Yiddish, but the etymology is probably from German <em><a href=\"https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Probe\">Probe</a></em> (approximately pronounced <em>probuh</em>, per Wiktionary), with the same meaning. It is related to the English <em>probe</em>, with both deriving from Latin <em>probare</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I can't answer for historical usage.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>it is from the common European word for 'examine, test, prove, try', originally from the Latin word probare (infinitive - 'to try, etc.') and late latin proba (noun for proof, whence our English word 'proof'). It gives us the English word probe, probation (trial, proof, demonstration). It has taken on the meaning 'audition' because the chazan/rabbi is trying to prove his worth. Our modern usage of the word comes from Yiddish.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>To add to the other (correct) answers, it is indeed a Yiddish word (פּראָבע), and Weinreich's dictionary translates it as \"test, tryout; assay; hallmark; probation; rehearsal\".  In addition, it has אױף פּראָבע (<em>af probe</em>) meaning \"as a test; on trial\", which neatly fits into the OP's context.  Beinfeld and Bochner's dictionary adds the phrase מאַכן פּראָבע (<em>makhn probe</em>) with the definition \"(theat.) to rehearse\".  As a Yiddish speaker myself (but not in <em>Chassidish</em>-Yiddish circles), I can attest to the usages in the context of auditions (for a play, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>In terms of history of usage in the OP's specific context, I found an <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/nybc202594#page/n172/mode/1up\" rel=\"nofollow\">example</a> from Sholem Aleichem's Monologue מיסטער גרין האָט אַ דזשאַב (Mister Green has a Job, from at latest 1915), about a <em>shofar</em> blower who is auditioning in various <em>shul</em>s for a job (on the 17th line in the link).</p>\n\n<p>I found another example cited in דער גרױסער װערטערבוך (The Great Dictionary) from Solomon Maurer from the story זײַ נישט קײן װאױלער יונג from 1925:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האָט די קהילה... דעם חײמלען אױף אַ <strong>פּראָבע</strong> אױף שבת אײַנגעלאַדנט</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Hot di kehile... dem khaymlen af a <strong>probe</strong> af shabes ayngeladnt</em></p>\n  \n  <p>The congregatation... invited this Chaiml for Shabbos for a <strong><em>probe</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't have access to the book, but the context is likely the same as the OP's.</p>\n\n\n",

Each officer was so titled, the Ibn Ezra suggests, for having 1,000 attendants and aides-de-camp. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_ben_Elijah_Ashkenazi\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Eliezer Ashkenazi</a> (<em>Ma'asei HaShem</em>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14040&st=&pgnum=92\" rel=\"nofollow\">מעשי תורה, ch. 5</a>) rejects this suggestion of the Ibn Ezra, and instead argues that \"שרי אלפים\" is a broad category of senior officer including those who were basic שרי אלפים, commanding 1,000 men each (roughly equivalent to a modern day colonel), and extending up to the שרי מאות, who each presided over 100,000 men. Accordingly, the top generals listed in II <em>Divrei HaYamim</em> 17 were שרי אלפים, but they were in the upper echelon thereof. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>\"תנו רבנן ושמת עליהם שרי אלפים שרי מאות שרי חמשים ושרי עשרות שרי אלפים שש מאות שרי מאות ששת אלפים שרי חמשים שנים עשר אלף שרי עשרות ששת ריבוא נמצאו דייני ישראל שבעת ריבוא ושמונת אלפים ושש מאות\"</sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>See <em>M'tzudas David</em> who appears to provide two different interpretations for the term \"שרי אלפים\" when used in II <em>Divrei HaYamim</em> 17:14 and in 25:5. In the former case, he interprets it to mean \"officers over camps of thousands\", perhaps suggesting that such an officer could command many thousands. In the latter case, however, he indicates that each such officer commanded 1,000 troops. This may suggest that the term can carry various meanings even in later usage. </sub></p>\n\n<p><sub>Also see Ralbag (ad loc., 17:14), who points out that the army expanded dramatically under Y'hoshaphat's reign. Perhaps, then, an alternative explanation could be that the five generals described in II <em>Divrei HaYamim</em> 17 were previously commanders over only 1,000 troops each but were then promoted to lead the army under Y'hoshaphat's military reorganization. </sub></p>\n\n\n",

There's alcohol content, sure, but it doesn't look good, and it doesn't taste good.<br>\n<strong>Is such wine subject to <em>yayin nesech</em></strong> (the prohibition to drink wine from gentiles, due to concern of idol-worship)<strong>?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I suppose the question hinges on whether the prohibition has to do with the <em>alcohol content</em> of the liquid, or whether people call this liquid \"<em>wine</em>.\"</p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking that it's probably not a problem, because it doesn't feel very likely that such wine would be used to worship, as it's certainly not quality wine, but I'm curious to know if something like this has been discussed in halacha.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch in Yoreh Deah 123 17 rules that fermented grapes which has turned into wine is not subject to the laws of Yayin Nesech until the wine has been separated from the pits and peels, see there for the various laws.

    "content": "# When did the word challa start being used to mean our Shabbos bread?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Torah we seem to only find this word associated with Temple related breads. In Rabbinic writings the word challa was the word referring to the amount of dough separated to be given to a kohen. We who don't give it to a kohen burn it. When, and perhaps how, did people start calling the Shabbos lekhem, the distinctive bread we make for Shabbos, by this name? </p>\n\n<p>It seems extra odd on the list of colloquial expressions being that we use the name of what we treat as prohibited to refer to the product we use. Imagine people start calling a Bris Mila an Orla, or start referring to Matzah as chametz. Strange.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>from <a href=\"http://menachemmendel.net/blog/the-origins-of-shabbat-challah/#sthash.pb8yniG4.dpuf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Menachem Mendel</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The earliest apparent source for using the term ḥallah in connection\n  with the bread that is eaten on Shabbat can be found in the 15th c.\n  German work Leket Yosher (p. 49) [See John Cooper’s Eat and Be\n  Satisfied: A Social History of Jewish Food]:</p>\n  \n  <p>וזכורני שבכל ע”ש עושין לו ג’ חלות דקות הנילושות בביצים ושמן ומעט מים. וחלה האמצעית נתן בלילה על השלחן באמצע שלחנו, כי שלחנו היה מרבע,\n  על המפה האמצעית. ותחת החלה היה ככר גדול שהוא שלם, אע”פ שהוא שחור ולא\n  על לחם לבן קטן גלוסקא שהוא זעמל. ובשחרית נתן החלה הגדולה וככר גדול על\n  השלחן כמו בלילה. ולסעודה ג’ לקח החלה הקטנה ולחם שלם.</p>\n  \n  <p>I remember that on every Friday afternoon they would make three thin ḥallot that were kneaded with eggs, oil, and a little bit of\n  water. In the evening, since the table was square, the middle ḥallah\n  was put in the middle of the table on the middle tablecloth. Under the\n  ḥallah was a large whole loaf…In the morning the large ḥallah and a\n  large loaf were put on the table like in the evening. For the third\n  meal the small ḥallah and a small bread was taken.</p>\n  \n  <p>Not only is the use of ḥallah in the context of Shabbat relatively\n  late, but it also wasn’t uniform. The following is from a Philologos\n  column that discussed the use by South African Jews of the word\n  “kitke” to describe the bread eaten on Shabbat:</p>\n  \n  <p>Mr. Cole can find the answer to his question in Volume III of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research’s Language and Culture Atlas of\n  Ashkenazic Jewry, in which no fewer than nine pages, complete with\n  linguistic maps and charts, are devoted to the various words by which\n  Sabbath and festival breads were known to the Jews of Central and\n  Eastern Europe. Although “challah” has taken over completely among the\n  Jews of the United States, effacing all its rivals, a look at\n  Ashkenazic Europe from Alsace in the West to Belarus and Ukraine in\n  the East reveals, in addition to Western and Eastern Yiddish khale,\n  five other words for such a bread: berkhes, dacher, koylatsh, shtritsl\n  and — the word asked about by Mr. Cole — kitke.</p>\n  \n  <p>Khale was by far the most widespread of these words, thus explaining its predominance in America. It derives from Hebrew\n  h.allah, which has the meaning in the Bible of a flat cake, baked on\n  coals, that constituted the simplest and most inexpensive of\n  sacrifices that could be offered on the altar. (Its association with\n  sacred ritual was very likely the reason that h.allah later became\n  attached to Sabbath and holiday breads.) Apart from much of Germany,\n  Czechoslovakia and Transylvania, khale was used in almost every part\n  of Ashkenazic Europe, often in conjunction with other terms. Sometimes\n  but not always, khale was the general term for a Sabbath and holiday\n  bread while another word designated to a local variety, or else khale,\n  referred to a plain bread as opposed to a fancier one. Thus, for\n  instance, the word koylatsh was used widely throughout Poland and\n  Russia to denote, in some areas, a braided challah; in others, a\n  decorated challah baked for weddings and celebrations, and in still\n  others, any braided roll, braided yeast cake, or even filled cake or\n  pastry. (The word koylatsh itself, though its ultimate etymology is\n  unclear, already was in use among French Jews in the lifetime of\n  renowned 11th-century rabbinic commentator Rashi; he speaks of a\n  coilush as a kind of long, thin bread, like a baguette.) Shtritsl\n  (apparently from medieval German Struz, a swelling — as of dough with\n  yeast? — or a protuberance) had much the same range of meanings as\n  koylatsh but was more restricted in its geographical range and was\n  used occasionally to designate a festive Christian bread rather than a\n  Jewish one.</p>\n  \n  <p>I mentioned this to my colleague Rabbi Jill Hammer, and she suggested\n  that I look into the connection between ḥallah and goddess worship.\n  Not really knowing what to expect, I found the following in The\n  Woman’s Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects (p. 482):</p>\n  \n  <p>The braided bread loaves of Germanic tradition were invented by the women of Teutonic tribes, who used to make offerings of their own\n  hair to their Goddess. Eventually they learned to preserve their\n  braids by substituting the imitative loaf, which was called\n  Berchisbrod or Perchisbrod, bread offered to the Goddess Berchta, or\n  Perchta. The name of the braided Sabbath loaf among German Jews,\n  Berches or Barches, was copied from this tradition.</p>\n  \n  <p>Could it be that those nice braids that my wife makes when she bakes\n  ḥallah really have their source in pagan goddess worship? The linguist\n  Paul Wexler thinks that the original name was actually the German\n  Holle which was</p>\n  \n  <p>the name of a pagan Germanic goddess to whom braided bread was once given in offering. [The German] Holle was replaced at a later\n  date-under the pressure of Judaization-by the [Hebrew] ḥallah, which\n  bore formal and semantic similarity. (See his book The Non-Jewish\n  Origins of the Sephardic Jews, pp. 68-69 and numerous other places in\n  his writings.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It is because the reason we bake the Shabbos bread in the first place is to rectify the sin of Eve, who caused the death of Adam, who was the \"Challah of the world\", i.e. the small holy part for which everything else was made. In order to protect and emphasize this reason, we call the entire batch of dough \"Challah\", since the the actual challah is discarded.</p>\n\n\n",

Shaul Lieberman</a> z\"l cites\na variety of sources in support of the view that Ramban should be\nconstrued as having meant exactly what he said. He concludes with near\ncertainty, as he puts it, 'that also in this case, the holy mouth of our master\ndid not speak a lie, even if it would have been a permissible one.' (Sheki'in (Jerusalem, 1939), 81-3.) (quoted in <a href=\"http://aleph.nli.org.il/F/N2MHNHRT84GXUQXFLQFICXC26U6U39UKJUAEI8J2KF4G2YKMJH-17691?func=find-b&amp=&amp=&amp=&request=000030850&find%5Fcode=SYS&local%5Fbase=RMB01&pds_handle=GUEST\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abravanel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a> too, understands that Ramban as having expressed his true view, and attaches no qualifications to it. (as noted by @jake)</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that Ramban does frequently dispute midrashic interpretations in his commentary to the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally he writes (chiddushim to Yevamot 61b) that we do not respond to words of aggada in the context of rejecting a teaching of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seder_Olam_Rabbah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Seder Olam</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואין משיבין על דברי אגדה דלית לן מאי דאמרינן באגדה ובסדר עולם שרבקה בת שלש שנים היתה באותה שעה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This same expression (ein meishivin al divrei aggada) is used by his student <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_ben_Aderet\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashba</a> (Chiddushim to Megillah 15a) in the context of the Tosafists' question on an aggadah in the Gemara that states that Ester was married to Mordechai and became forbidden to him. The Tosafists ask why he didn't divorce her, and answer that the necessary witnesses for the divorce would have caused (or risked) publicizing his relationship with her. Rashba asks that he could have written the get himself thus obviating the need for witnesses. He answers that we don't respond to matters of aggada. This seems to mean that the Midrash may be wrong. (See also his responsa 1:50 and 3:340). </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Meiri\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meiri</a> uses this expression as well, and definitely means that the Midrash may be wrong. He discusses the opinion in the Gemara (Shabbat 55a) that suffering is always as a result of sin.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב אמי אין מיתה בלא חטא ואין יסורין בלא עון</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara (55b) concludes that this opinion is mistaken.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ותיובתא דרב אמי תיובתא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Meiri writes there that it is fundamental to Judaism that everything that happens to man is the result of divine oversight. He continues by writing that even though the Gemara concludes by rejecting this view, <strong>the fundaments of Judaism aren't determined by simplistic interpretations of Scripture, or by aggadot, as you know that we do not respond to aggadot.</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואע\"פ שנשאר דעת האומר כן בתיובתא אין עקרי האמונות תלויות בראיות של פשוטי מקראות ואגדות וכבר ידעת שאין משיבין באגדה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simhah_ben_Samuel_of_Vitry\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Machzor Vitry</a>  (428) who uses this expression regarding a Midrash about the age of Bil'am at the time he was killed, who notes that \"we do not respond to aggadot, and perhaps there is Amoraic dispute in the matter. And <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah_ben_Manoah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> (Exodus 4:26) who uses this expression regarding a disagreement between the Gemara and \"<em>rov haolam</em>\"; i.e. most commentators over whether Moses failed to circumcise his older son, or his younger son. See also the almost identical formulation in Chidushei HaRitva (Avodah Zara 8a), Paneach Raza (parshat B'reshit), Halakhot Ketanot of Mordechai (Menachot ch. HaT'khelt: 940), responsa of Rema (100), responsa of R. Menachem Azzaryah of Fanu (36), and Abarbanel (I Samuel ch. 4) who cites this in the name of \"Chazal\".</p>\n\n<p>It is thus clear that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maharal</a> erred when he wrote (B'er Hagolah: B'er HaShishi; ch. 15) that the expression (he quotes it from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissim_Ben_Jacob\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Nissim Gaon</a> ) means that we don't question aggadot since they may have hidden meanings:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזהו בעצמו מה שאמרו אין משיבין בדברי אגדה כי אפשר האומר אותה אמרו על דרך נעלם, ולפיכך אין משיבין ואין מקשין באגדה לפשוטה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As this certainly isn't the intent of the Meiri, and it is almost certainly not the intent of Rashba, or the Machzor Vitry.  Lastly it is difficult to reconcile with the usage of the Chizkuni who deals with a Midrash of simple textual analysis. It is difficult to claim that he means that there may be deep meaning to the Midrash about which son Moshe circumcised.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Mevo Hatalmud</em> (generally printed at the end of tractate berakhot) attributed to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Shmuel Hanagid</a> (11th century) writes very similarly to the Meiri et al. \"one should only learn from it that which seems reasonable...everything else disregard\" (translation my own. I rendered \"ein somchin aleihem\" as disregard).]</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_ben_Barzillai\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yehudah Ben Barzilai of Barcelona</a> (11th century) writes in his <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21827&st=&pgnum=152&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to the Sefer Yetzira</a> that there are drashot that we disregard \"ein somchin aleihem\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לכך דרשו רבותינו בקצת דרשות כי המלאכים עתידים לשאול לצדיקים מה פעל אל...ואע״פ שיש מי שמפרש פסוק זה בנביאים והכי מתראה עיקר פירושו מכל מקום הרבה פנים בתורה ואין מספר להגדיות. ואע״פ שאין מי שסומך על הגדות הללו...וכו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although in context his exact intent isn't fully clear (to me).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherira_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Sherira Gaon</a> quoted by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_Isaac_of_Narbonne\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer HaEshkol</a> (Hilchot Sefer Torah) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמר מר [רב] שרירא הני מילי דנפקי מפסוקי ומקרי מדרש ואגדה אומדנא נינהו, ויש מהן שהוא כך...והרבה יש שאינו כן, כגון מה שאמר ר' עקיבא דמקושש היינו צלפחד...והם הזכירו דעתו של כל אחד ואחד, ואנו לפי שכלו יהולל איש. וכן...תנחומא...וזולתם, רובם אינו כן, ולכך אין אנו סומכין על דברי אגדה. והנכון מהם מה שמתחזק מן השכל ומן המקרא מדבריהם,   </p>\n  \n  <p>These words that are derived from verses and are called midrashim or aggada are estimations (umdena)...Some are indeed correct, but many are not correct...Therefore we do not rely on aggada...Accept as reliable only those that follow from logic or from the verses. (Also cited in the introduction to Menorat Ha-Maor p. 47)].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Hai Gaon</a> cited there writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגדה ומדרש אף על פי שכתובין בתלמוד אם לא יכוונו ואם ישתבשו אין לסמוך עליהם, כי כללינו הוא אין סומכין על ההגדה, אלא מה שקבוע בתלמוד שאנו מוצאין להסיר שבושן ולחזקן יש עלינו לעשות, כי לולא שיש בו מדרש לא נקבע בתלמוד. ומה שאין אנו מוצאין דרך לסלק שבושו נעשה כדברים שאין הלכה. ומה שלא נקבע בתלמוד אין אנו צריכין לכל כך, אלא מעיינין בו אם נכון הוא ויפה, דורשין אותו ומלמדין אותו, ואם לאו אין אנו משגיחין עליו.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Even if Aggadot and Midrashim are written in the Talmud, if they do not make sense disregard them, for we have a principle that we do not rely on the aggadot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, Rav Hai Gaon is quoted (Otsar HaGeonim Berakhot; Peirushim: 67) as repeating the assertion that aggadot are not based on tradition, and therefore we do not rely on them. (Note that R. Hai precedes R. Nissim, the source for Maharal's quote about Aggadot. Unlike Maharal who claimed that the reason for not relying on aggadot is that they are cryptic, R. Hai Gaon writes that the reason is that they are not authoritative, and are mere conjecture:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הוו יודעים כי דברי אגדה לאו שמועה הם, אלא כל אחד דורש מה שעלה על לבו כגון אפשר, ויש לומר, לא דבר חתוך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_Moses_ben_Maimon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Abraham the son of Maimonides</a>  writes in his Torah commentary (Exodus 14:11) that a midrashic identification of characters in an incident is an estimation, rather than a definite fact.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזו השערה על ההצעה האומרת כל שאתה יכול לתלות ברשעים תלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Boaz_ben_Simon_Baruch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shiltey Gibborim</a> to Avodah Zarah (6a) writes that some Midrashim state things that they themselves know are untrue as a poetic sort of non-literal interpretation of the text:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנה תראה מה שדרש ...יעקב אבינו לא מת...והשיב לו מקרא אני דורש, כלומר גם אני יודע שמת אלא אני מתכוין לדרוש את המקרא בכל ענין...ועוד אמרו בתלמוד א\"י בפ\"ס דנזיר וכי המדרשות אמנה הם דרוש וקבל שכר הא לך הדבר מבואר שלא אמרו חכמים המדרשים על דרך אמונה ועיקר אלא להרבות טעמא למקרא ולדרשו בכל פנים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> (cited and discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/52930/does-the-zodiac-really-have-influence-on-our-lives/53765#53765\">here</a>) writes in his letter on astrology:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I know that you may search and find sayings of some individual sages in the Talmud and Midrashim whose words appear to maintain that at the moment of a man's birth, the stars will cause such and such to happen to him. Do not regard this as a difficulty, for it is not fitting for a man to abandon the prevailing law and raise once again the counterarguments and replies (that preceded its enactment). Similarly it is not proper to abandon matters of reason that have already been verified by proofs, shake loose of them, and depend on the words of a single one of the sages from whom possibly the matter was hidden. Or there may be an allusion in those words...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, he maintains the possibility that the sage was mistaken regarding this non-halakhic matter, but his language leaves open the possibility that he would only suggest this regarding the view of individual sages, but not the consensus of the sages. It is noteworthy, however, that this possibility of the erring sage being an individual view is not backed up with any proof-texts of disputants. This suggests that practically Rambam would be willing to form opinions independent of Chazal even when their statements appear to disagree. It would appear, then, that the appeal to theoretical disputants is a mere formality.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, he writes in a responsum (Blau: II: 458) responding to a reference to a Midrash, that it is a mere aggada, and we do not concern ourselves with aggadot, for are they matters of tradition, or are they reasonable? Rather, they are the personal musings of individuals that do not relate to law and are therefore not to be reckoned with. This applies whether or not the Midrashim are recorded in the Talmud.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולעניין יוצאי תיבה כל אותן הדברים דברי הגדה ואין מקשין בהגדה וכי דברי קבלה הן או מילי דסברא אלא כל אחד ואחד מעיין בפ[ירושן?] כפי מה שיראה לו בו ואין בזה לא דברי קבלה ולא אסור ולא מותר ולא דין מן הדינין ולפיכך אין מקשים [בהן]. ושמא תאמר לי כמו שיאמרו רבים וכי דברים שבתלמוד אתה קורא הגדה כן כל אלו הדברים וכיוצא בהן הגדה הן בענינם בין כתובין בתלמוד בין שהיו כתובין בספרי דרשות בין שהיו כתובין בספרי אגדה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Radak</a> (Joshua 5:14) goes so far as to state that a Midrash is based on faulty recollection of the verses:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד כי כותב הדרש הזה טעה בפסוק וילן, כי שני פסוקים הם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He is quoted without objection by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%9D_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94_(%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9F)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbenu Avraham ben Sh'lomo</a> in his commentary to Joshua (p. 28).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elia_del_Medigo\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Eliyahu Del Medigo</a> (15th century) writes in Bechinat Hadat (Viena, 1833 pp. 55-56):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>התלמוד נחלק לב׳ הלקים, הלק בהודעת הדינים כלם וחלק במדרשות ואגדות. והחלק הראשון אין ספק אצל כל בעל דת מאנשי אומתנו שאין ראוי לחלוק עליו כלל כאשר כבר נאמר, אולם החלק השני הוא אשר יתכן לפעמים שלא נסכים בו ולא יקרה בזה חטא, וזה כי התורה לא חייבתנו לשמוע לחכמים אלא בעניני הדינים אשר בם מעשה או בענייני שרשי האמונדה המוסכמים מהם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is: the Talmud is divided into two parts: the part that includes all the laws, and the part that includes Midrashim and Aggadot. Regarding the former, there is no doubt among every practicing member of our religion, that it is improper to disagree with it whatsoever. However, the second part is the part which it is conceivable to sometimes disagree with, and this is not a sin. This is because the Torah only required us to listen to the Sages regarding practical laws and the universally agreed upon fundaments of faith.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Samson Rahael Hirsch</a> wrote that aggadic statements are not part of Torah Shebaal Peh from Sinai, and that we should not part from the great authorities such as Rav Sherira Gaon, Rav Hai Gaon, Rabbeinu Nissin, Rabbeinu Chananel, Rabbeinu Shmuel HaNaggid, Ritva... who taught that we do not accept aggada unconditionally, but only accept that which seems reasonable. Furthermore, claiming the opposite, actually opens the doors to heresy!</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Faur\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hakham Yosef Faur</a> writes in Tradition (<a href=\"http://traditionarchive.org/news/originals/Volume%209/No.%204/Understanding%20the.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">vol. 9 no. 4</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Traditionally for normative Judaism only the halakhic elements of the Talmud are authoritative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is possibly Talmudic precedent for this general approach to aggadot from the Palestinian Talmud Sanhedrin (10:1) as cited by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_ben_Zemah_Duran\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashbats</a> (Magen Avot to Tractate Avot 2:14):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמרו בירושלמי שם, אבל ספרי המירם והספרים שנכתבו מכאן ואילך, כל הקורא בהם כקורא באגדות, מאי טעמא, 'ויותר מהמה בני הזהר עשות ספרים הרבה אין קץ ולהג הרבה יגיעת בשר' [קהלת יב יב], להגיון נתנם ולא ליגיעה נתנם</p>\n  \n  <p>Regarding books that are written from know on, reading them is like reading aggadot. Why? [because it is written \"of making many books there is no no end,\" and] \"much study is weariness of the flesh\" (Eccless 12:12), for reading they were given but for toil [i.e. study], they were not given! (Trans. R. Dr. Jose Faur Golden Doves With Silver Dots p. 100)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given the overwhelming body of literature expressing the view, including the writings of Ramban's predecessors, contemporaries, successors, and his own writings, it seems that there is no evidence that he believed anything other than what he wrote, and it is reasonable to assume that the Abarbanel and R. Lieberman are correct in their understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, Ramban's argument about the non-authoritative role of Midrashim was repeated in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disputation_of_Tortosa\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Disputation at Tortosa</a> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astruc_ha-Levi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Astruc Halevi</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Others, however take the stance that one must believe (in at least some) Midrashim.  This is the opinion of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_B._Soloveitchik\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Soloveitchik</a>  according to R. Moshe Meiselman in his Torah Chazal & Science (see p. 654) regarding the source for the dirt used to create Adam, the story of Avraham being thrown into the fiery furnace, and Adam's sacrifice the day he was created. R. Hershel Shechter attributed similar sentiments to R. Soloveitchik, in a conversation I had with him.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avrohom_Yeshaya_Karelitz\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chazon Ish</a> (Iggerot Chazon Ish I:15) also regards as dogma the belief that all aggadot in the Talmud have their origin in the sages' prophetic power.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משרשי האמונה שכל הנאמר בגמ'...בין בהלכה ובין באגדה, הם הם הדברים שנתגלו לנו ע\"י כח נבואי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Somewhat of an intermediate approach seems to be adopted by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechiel_of_Paris\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yechiel of Paris</a> in his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechiel_of_Paris#Disputation_of_Paris\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Disputation in Paris</a> in which he writes the following in response to the question of whether he believes in the Talmud from which questions will be raised:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Included there are fantastical things which are difficult for heretics to believe, and regarding them there is no need to respond to you. If you wish, believe them, and if you don't want to, don't believe them. For law isn't determined on their account. However, I know that the scholars of the Talmud didn't write mistakes, but only correct and true things. And if they seem fantastic to listeners, [bear in mind]: are there not many similar things in Scripture, such as Lot's wife who became a pillar of salt, and the mouth of Bilam's ass which spoke with him...and many similar events.</p>\n  \n  <p>ויש בהם דברי פלא שקשה להאמין לכופר ולאפיקורוס ולמין, ועליהם אין צורך להשיבך, אם תרצה תאמין ואם לא תרצה לא תאמין בהם. כי אין משפט נכרת על פיהם. אמנם ידעתי כי החכמים בתלמוד לא כתבו מאומה רק דברים כנים ואמתים, ואם מופלאים הם לשומעיהם הלא יש כאלה רבים במקרא, כמו אשתו של לוט שהייתה נציב מלח, ופי האתון של בלעם שדיבר עמו ומלחמת סיסרא שנלחמו הכוכבים ממסילותם. ומעשה יונה וקיקיון של יונה שבין לילה היה ובין לילה אבד, ומעשה דאלישע שהחיה את המת מקברו וכיוצא בהם רבים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is although he personally believes that all the words of the Talmud, even the Midrashim, are true and wise, and he implies that the only ones who have difficulty accepting them are heretics, he nevertheless writes that they do not not need to be accepted as they do not determine law.</p>\n\n<p>(As with Ramban's dispute there is some latitude to suggest that some or all of what he said was a result of the necessity of the debate and doesn't reflect his true view). </p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.hashkafacircle.com/journal/R2_DS_aggada.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://hakirah.org/Vol%204%20Eisen.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Chaim Eisen's article in Hakirah vol. 4</a> at length. Significantly, R. Eisen writes that he is unaware of any Geon or Rishon who held of Maharal's view.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>R' Tzvi Berkowitz told me that R' Yaakov Kaminetzky told him that the Ramban was only saying that for the purposes of the debate, in order to avoid addressing a question to which they would not accept the answer.  This was along the lines of the principle of being \"דוחה בקש\" (pushing off with straw) someone who asks from an illegitimate standpoint.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the notes to the Chavel printing of the Vikuach, he brings sources from other Rishonim who made similar remarks and concludes that there is no reason to assume that the Ramban did not mean it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Early Rabbinic Views on Understanding Aggadah/Midrash</p>\n\n<p>Rav Sherira Gaon 906-1006, head of the Pumbedita Academy Sefer Haeshcol, Hilkhot Sefer Torah, p. 60a Those points brought out from scriptural verses called Midrash and Aggadah are assumptions. Some are accurate such as Rabbi Judahs statement that Simeons portion was included in that of Judah, for we find it corroborated in the book of Joshua but many are not we abide by the principle, According to his intelligence is a man commended (Prov. 12:8). As to the aggadot of the students’ students - Rabbi Tanhuma, Rabbi Oshaya, and others - most of them [the realities] are not as they expounded. Accordingly we do not rely on aggadot. The correct ones of them are those supported by intelligence and by Scripture. There is no end to aggadot.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hai Gaon, son of Sherira 939-1038, head of the Pumbedita Academy Sefer Haeshcol,Hilkhot Sefer Torah, p. 60a Aggadah and Midrash, even concerning those written in the Talmud, if they do not work out properly and if they are mistaken, they are not to be relied upon, for the rule is, we do not rely on Aggadah. However, regarding what is ensconced in the Talmud, if we find a way to remove its errors and strengthen it, we should do so, for if there were not some lesson to be derived it would not have been incorporated. Concerning what is not in the Talmud, we investigate if correct and proper we expound and teach it and if not we pay no attention to it.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hai Gaon, Comments on Hagigah You should know that aggadic statements are not like those of shemua (heard, a passed-down). Rather, they are cases of each individual expounding what came to his mind, in the nature of it can be said, not a decisive matter. Accordingly we do not rely on them.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hai Gaon ibid \"Rabbenu Hai was asked: What distinction is there between aggadoth that are written in the Talmud (the error of which we are obligated to remove [through interpretation]) and aggadoth that are written outside the Talmud? He answered: Whatever has been fixed in the Talmud is clearer than what has not been fixed in it. Nevertheless, if the aggadoth that are written in it (i.e. in the Talmud) are not [logically] founded or are erroneous, the are not to be relied on, for there is a rule: We do not rely on aggadoth. However, whatever is fixed, the error of which we are obligated to remove [through interpretation], we should do so. For had it not possessed substance it would not have been fixed in the Talmud. If we find no way to remove its error [through interpretation], it becomes like unaccepted dicta. But in the case of what has not been fixed in the Talmud (i.e. non-Talmudic aggadoth found in the Midrashim) we do not need [to do] all this. If it (i.e. the aggadah) is correct and fine, then we discourse on it and teach it; otherwise, we pay not attention to it.\" (This is the basic source of Rabbi Shemu'el haNagid ibn Naghrela's similar statement printed in his Mebo HaTalmud in the back of Messecheth Berachoth of the Vilna Shas).</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hai Gaon ibid Words of Aggadah are not like a tradition; rather, everyone expounds what arises in his heart — like ‘it is possible’ and ‘one may say’ — not a decisive statement. Therefore, one does not rely upon them.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides Introduction to Pereq Heleq Regarding those who interpret all aggadot and midrashim literally, the Rambam states: “they destroy the Torahs glory and darken its brilliance; they make G-ds Torah the opposite of what was intended. He stated in the perfect Torah regarding the nations who hear about all these statutes, that they will say, What a wise and insightful people this great nation is (Deut. 4:6). But when the nations hear how this group relates the words of the sages in a literal manner they will say, What a foolish and ignorant people this insignificant nation is. Most of these expounders explain to the public what they, themselves, really do not understand. Would that they be quiet or say, We do not understand what the rabbis mean in this statement or how to interpret it. But they think they understand and endeavor to make known according to their poor understanding not according to the sages intention and expound at the head of the assembly the derashot of tractate Berakhot, the chapter Heleq and other sources, literally, word by word.” “These subjects do not contain that which is fitting to be publicly taught and demonstrated even in academies [whose students are replete with] wisdom. Indeed, [the subjects] discussed are hinted at in the Torah in well-concealed illusions. When God will remove the veil of ignorance of those whom He chooses - after that person has exerted himself and ingrained himself with wisdom - then that person shall partially comprehend their meaning commensurate with his intellectual capabilities. And when God does remove the veil from that man's eyes and shows him whatever He shows, he must conceal the information from others.”</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides, in his introduction to the last chapter of the tractate Sanhedrin As concerns the words of the Sages, people can be divided into three categories: the first...believe them literally and do not see them as containing a hidden message; they see them as fact. They do so because they do not comprehend wisdom and are far from not on the level that would give them the ability to discern the true intent by themselves and lack the teachers who would give them this ability. They are convinced that the Sages intended no more than what they [these people] understand and that all of the Sages' words must be taken literally: a contention that the simpleton - let alone a wise man - rejects, for an examination of some of the Aggadah leads one to conclude that there could not possibly be people who accept them fully or view them as matters of faith. One must feel sorry for those weak-minded people, for, in their foolishness, they feel that they are honoring and elevating the words of the Sages, whereas in reality they drag them down to the lowest level... This category of men destroys the glory of the Torah, darkens its brightness, and perverts the Torah of God into the reverse of what was intended. God said in the Torah that the nations will hear its laws and will say how wise and understanding is this great people. This type of person causes the nations who hear their [literal] interpretation to comment how foolish and despicable is this small people...</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides The Guide to Perplexed (III:15) [Our Sages] use the Bible text as a kind of poetical language [for their own ideas], and do not intend thereby to interpret the text. This style was widespread in ancient days; all adopted it in the same manner as poets...Our Sages say, in reference to the words, \"And a paddle (yated) thou shalt have upon thy weapons (azeneka)\" [Deut 23:14]. Do not read azeneka \"thy weapon,\" but ozneka, \"thy ear\" if you hear a person uttering something disgraceful, put your fingers into your ears. Now, I wonder whether those ignorant persons [who take the Sages literally] believe that the author of this saying gave it as the true interpretation of the verse quoted, and as the meaning of this precept...I cannot think that any person whose intellect is sound can accept this. The author employed the text as a beautiful poetic phrase, in teaching an excellent moral less poetically connected with the above text. In the same sense you must understand the phrase, \"Do not read so, but so, wherever it occurs in the Midrash. Maimonides The Guide to Perplexed (III:43) They [i.e. Sages] use the text of the Bible only as a kind of poetical language [for their own ideas], and do not intend thereby to give an interpretation of the text. As to the value of these Midrashic interpretations, we meet with two different opinions. For some think that the Midrash contains the real explanation of the text, whilst others, finding that it cannot be reconciled with the words quoted, reject and ridicule it. The former struggle and fight to prove and to confirm such interpretations according to their opinion, and to keep them as the real meaning of the text; they consider them in the same light as traditional laws. Neither of the two classes understood it, that our Sages employ biblical texts merely as poetical expressions, the meaning of which is clear to every reasonable reader. This style was general in ancient days; all adopted it in the same way as poets [adopt a certain style]. ...... You are thus told, that if you hear a person uttering something disgraceful, put your fingers into your ears. Now, I wonder whether those ignorant persons [who take the Midrashic interpretations literally] believe that the author of this saying gave it as the true interpretation of the text quoted ....... The author employed the text as a beautiful poetical phrase, in teaching an excellent moral lesson.....I have departed from my subject, but it was for the purpose of making a remark useful to every intellectual member of the Rabbanites.</p>\n\n<p>Abraham ben Moses ben (1186, 1237) the son of Maimonides who succeeded his father as Nagid of the Egyptian Jewish community Introduction to Agadah, Ein Yaakov Let it be known that the greater part of whatever is found in the Talmud or in the other books of the sages, blessed be their memories! as the Midrash (Biblical exposition) is entirely concealed from us; and even they who wrote commentaries upon the Talmud, never made an attempt to fathom its meaning. And my father, my teacher, blessed be his memory! contemplated writing an explanatory commentary, as he mentions in his “Commentary on the Mishnah,” but refrained from doing so. And Moses was afraid to approach it, as he says in the beginning of his Hamore {FN: A book of philosophy by Moses Maimonides, called Hamore (The Guide to the Perplexed).} Nevertheless, after my father’s death, I devoted considerable energy to make some explanations regarding this subject, and I did not withdraw from this step because, after all my study, I came to the conclusion that it is of great importance. My explanation shall, however, merely serve to call the attention to thy heart and thy thought so that thou shalt open thine eyes and comprehend the manner in which the sages spoke in their so-called Midrashim. From my words, shalt thou be able to determine what are the real meanings of their words” \"Know that it is your duty to understand that whoever propounds a certain theory or idea and expects that theory or idea to be accepted merely out of respect for the author without proving its truth and reasonableness pursues a wrong method prohibited by both the Torah and human intelligence. From the standpoint of intelligence, such a method is worthless for it would cause one to minimize the importance of those things which, after scrupulous observation and proofs, ought to be believed, and from the point of view of the Torah - because it inclines from the true path and from the straight, leveled road. The Lord, praised be He! said: Thou shalt not respect the poor person, nor honor the great person; in righteousness shalt thou judge, etc. (Lev. 19, 15). And it also says, Ye shall not respect a person in judgment (Deut. 1, 17)... According to this preamble, then, we are not in duty bound to defend the opinions of the sages of the Talmud, concerning medicine, physics and astrology, as right in every respect simply because we know the sages to be great men with a full knowledge of all things regarding the Torah, in its various details... Thou canst see that even the sages themselves say very often of things which cannot be proved by discussions and arguments, “I swear, that even had Joshua b. Nun said it, I would not obey him.” This means that I would not believe him although he was a prophet - since he cannot prove the reason for such a thing in accordance with the rules of the Talmudical construction. The following evidence will be sufficient proof for it and none will venture to dispute it. Since we find that the sages themselves had said, concerning medical knowledge that the opinion of such and such a Rabbi did not prove to be true, as for instance, the eagle-stone (Sabbath Fol. 66b), or other things mentioned. We infer from this that they did not arrive at the true ultimate conclusion of everything outside of the Torah.\" \"there are also stories which actually occurred, but were exaggerated in the belief that no thoughtful man would mistake their meaning. And the sages admitted using such a style, as they say (Tamid Fol. 29) “The Torah spoke in exaggerated language, the prophets spoke in exaggerated language, and the sages spoke in exaggerated language; the Torah - for it is said (Deut. 1, 28) The cities are great and fortified up to heaven; the prophets - for it is said (I Kings 1) So that the earth was rent at their noise. The sages - when they speak of the heap of ashes on the altar; what the Mishnah says (Ib.) in regard to the vine which stood at the entrance of the Temple, and what they say concerning the curtain which separated the holy of holies from the Hechal.” These are but three instances in the Mishnah, but in the Gemara, they are numberless. An illustration of this may be found (Megilla Fol. 7b): “Raba and R. Zeira were banqueting together; during the banquet Raba stood up and slaughtered R. Zeira. He prayed to God for mercy and R. Zeria returned to life.” The meaning of this is that Raba beat R. Zeira and wounded him so severely that the latter was at the point of death; he uses the term “slaughtered him” because it was severe, or it might have been at the throat. And the word Achaye (made him return to life) means he became well. The word is frequently used for that meaning {FN: See II Kings 20, 7 and Isaiah 38, that the word is used for “becoming well.”} Many similar stories are found in the Talmud.\" read the full essay (short): <a href=\"http://mesora.org/AinYaakov-Intro.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://mesora.org/AinYaakov-Intro.html</a></p>\n\n<p>R.

Shemu’el ben Hofni Perush ha-Torah And it is impossible for us to believe in the veracity of a matter for whose negation there are corroborations, only because some of the ancient [Sages] said it. Indeed, it is necessary that we contemplate the matter with our intellect. If a proof may be found for its veracity, we shall accept it. If there comes corroboration for its possibility, we shall believe in it as something possible. And if it is found to be impossible, we shall regard it as impossible.</p>\n\n<p>R. Shemu’el ha-Naggid 993-1055, Talmudic scholar, grammarian, and philologist, who lived in Iberia Mevo ha-Talmud Aggadah is every explanation that comes in the Talmud regarding any matter that is not a mizvah. This is Aggadah; and you should learn from it only what arises in the mind.... What[the Sages] interpreted in [Scriptural] verses is [for] each one according to what occurred to him and what he saw in his mind. And according to what arises in the mind from these interpretations, one learns it; and one does not rely upon the rest.</p>\n\n<p>Shmuel ha-Nagid, in his \"Introduction to the Talmud “Mavo HaTalmud” (Intro to the Talmud) found at the end of Tractate Brachot Aggadah comprises any comment occurring in the Talmud on any topic which is not a commandment (not halachic), one should derive from it only that which is reasonable. The value of Aggadah is found only in the gems of wisdom one derives from it. If one derives nonsense, it has no value. Very few people are capable of diving into the deep water and coming up with pearls [Ramban metaphor]. Other individuals have no business delving into Aggadah. They would do better refraining from trying to interpret that which is beyond them. “Bmufrosh mimcha al tidrosh.” Such people cannot discern between something literal or metaphorical.</p>\n\n<p>Abraham ben Isaac of Narbonne (Raavad II) d.1210, was a Provençal rabbi Sefer ha-Eshkol One should not rely upon Aggadah and Midrash, even though they are written in the Talmud, if they are unattuned or erroneous. For our principle is: One does not rely upon the Aggadah. Rather, what is fixed in the Talmud, [in] which we find [the means] to remove its error and reinforce it — we should do so; for, if it had no basis, it would not have been fixed in the Talmud. And what we do not find a way to clear of its error — becomes like matters that [do] not [accord with the] Halakhah. [With] what is not fixed in the Talmud, we need not [do even] this much. Rather, one ponders it; if it is correct and becoming, one expounds it and teaches it; and, if not, we pay it no attention.</p>\n\n<p>R. David Kimchi (Radak) (1160–1235) Iggerot Qena\"ot, III Concerning the aggadot we explain them in accordance with the laws and [rational] evidence, since they are bonded to reason and allude to wisdom, as we were taught by our predecessors the Geonim, such as our teachers Sherira, Hayye, Isaac Alfasi, and the rest of the Geonim, pillars of the world and the foundations of the earth! Concerning the [interpretation] of aggadot, we depend and rely on their teachings and words, not on others!</p>\n\n<p>R.

In addition to him, many Geonim, fathers of the Talmudic legacy and qabala, and there is nothing higher than their words to measure them by—[confirm to this principle], particularly R.

E.g. Human food, the size of a dried fig etc. (see rest of list in mishna shabbos ch. 8). Those shiurim are humongous for him!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Would any of these (or other) <em>shiurim</em> (measurements) be scaled down to match the shrunk person?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The question is extremely relevant as some people (e.g with allergies to gluten) are unable to eat Matza on Pesach and more than a few crumbs could be fatal, so as far as we're concerned they are the \"shrunk kids\" and whether it’s worth it for them to eat a few crumbs which they are able to muster is a very important question.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch O.C 612,1 says that the giant Og melech haboshon would be chayav on Yom Kippur on a measurement of a cacoseves Hagaso (a large date) just like everyone else because even though he ate a far greater amount he had some sort of degree of satisfaction as it says in Yuma 80a:  מתקיף לה רבי זירא כל העולם כולו ככותבת ועוג מלך הבשן בככותבת אמר ליה אביי קים להו לרבנן דבהכי מייתבא דעתיה. The Shulchan Aruch continues that Ben Nanos the dwarf would also be chayav on Yom Kippur by eating a date size even though it was a lot for him. </p>\n\n<p>Hence we see the same measurement for everyone in that case of a date size.</p>\n\n<p>We also see with the measurement of a Cabeitza (egg) and a cazais (olive) that the same measurement applies.</p>\n\n<p>The Tanna Rabbi Tzoddok who was fasting for 40 years, and even though he had such a small stomach he couldn't eat more than the juice of an a fig when he was being healed as stated in Gittin 56a: ר' צדוק יתיב ארבעין שנין בתעניתא דלא ליחרב ירושלים כי הוה אכיל מידי הוה מיתחזי מאבראי וכי הוה בריא מייתי ליה גרוגרות מייץ מייהו ושדי להו. He was potur from eating in the succah (succah 27a) - which one fulfills ones mitzva with a Kebaitza (egg size) during the 7 days of succos - as he always ate a very small amount which was even less than a cazayis. He would have likewise been exempt from eating a kezais on the first night in the succah where there is a smaller measurement of a cazais as it states in Shulchan Aruch O.C. 639,3: אכילה בסוכה בליל יום טוב הראשון חובה. אפילו אכל כזית פת יצא ידי חובתו. And the Mishna Brura explains :בליל יו\"ט הראשון חובה - ר\"ל דבליל יו\"ט הראשון מחוייב לאכול בסוכה ואפילו אם אינו אוכל אלא כזית משא\"כ מליל זה והלאה אפילו בשבת ויו\"ט דמחוייב לאכול פת אינו מחויב לאכול בסוכה אלא אם אוכל יותר מכביצה דהוי אכילת קבע. והטעם דלילה זה חמיר דגמרינן ט\"ו ט\"ו מחג המצות מה התם רק לילה הראשונה חובה מכאן ואילך רשות אף ה\"נ לענין סוכה: i.e first night one eats a kezais (olive size) in the succah, rest of the 7 days more than a cabaitza (egg size). So we see a shrunk stomach does not change measurements with regards to eating.</p>\n\n<p>However with melo lugmov (a cheek full) which is how much kiddush wine the mekadesh needs to drink (S.A O.C 271,13) and the amount of liquid to drink on Yom kippur to be chayav koreis (S.A O.C 612,9) is dependent on how big the persons cheek is. </p>\n\n<p>Just to note with eating or drinking on Yom Kippur, remember chatzi shiur (Half measurements) ossur min hatorah (are still prohibitted from the Torah), which means while one is not chayav kareis (Death under 60) it is still prohibited to eat unless Pikuach nefesh (saving a life).</p>\n\n<p>With regards to carrying food on shabbos, food is definitely a fixed amount the size of a fig according to the mishna brought in the question and in fact all of the following measurements are the exact fruit size regardless of the size of the person:</p>\n\n<p>Eiruvin 4a:שיעורין דאורייתא הוא דכתיב (דברים ח, ח) ארץ חטה ושעורה וגו' ואמר רב חנן כל הפסוק הזה לשיעורין נאמר חטה לכדתנן גהנכנס לבית המנוגע וכליו על כתיפיו וסנדליו וטבעותיו בידיו הוא והם טמאין מיד דהיה לבוש כליו וסנדליו ברגליו וטבעותיו באצבעותיו הוא טמא מיד והן טהורין עד שישהא בכדי אכילת פרס פת חיטין ולא פת שעורין מיסב ואוכל בליפתן שעורה דתנן העצם כשעורה מטמא במגע ובמשא ואינו מטמא באהל גפן כדי ורביעית יין לנזירתאנה אכגרוגרת להוצאת שבת רמון כדתנן בכל כלי בעלי בתים שיעורן כרימונים (דברים ח, ח) ארץ זית שמן (ודבש) ארץ שכל שיעוריה כזיתים כל שיעוריה ס\"ד והאיכא הני דאמרן אלא אימא ארץ שרוב שיעוריה כזיתים דבש גככותבת הגסה ליום הכיפורים - measurement are from the Torah as it says Devarim 8,8 \" a land with wheat\" this is the half loaf of wheat bread that a person eats.In This time frame his clothes will be contaminated in a House of tzaraas. \"barley\" This is the size of a human bone to be contaminated with i.e the size of a kernal of barley. \"grapes\" the amount of wine for a nazir to drink to be liable to lashes for profaning his nazirrus i.e reviis (1 and half eggs), \"fig\" a dried fig he is liable when he carries on shabbos, \"pomegranate\" the size of hole in a big container used to store big things that will render the container tahor (uncontaminated),\" a land of olives\" most measurements are the size of olives,\"and dates\" one is liable to eat a large date size on Yom kippur.</p>\n\n<p>As with regards to cubits and hand-breaths they are also nonnegligeble. This is because their are 7 hairs in an agudol which is the thumb of an average personah . (Source Rambam Sefer Torah 10,20:שיעור גודל של אדם בינוני הוא כרוחב ז' שערות זו בצד זו בדוחק, וכן באורך ב' שערות ברוחב. הרמב\"ם פרק י מהלכות ספר תורה דין ט). there are 4 agudols(thumbs) in a tefach (Handbreath)(source menochos 41b)(פרק התכלת מא:] טפח דאורייתא ד' אצבעות בגודל שית בקטנה חמש ותילתא באצבע), and there are 6 handbreaths in a regular cubit (Source Menachos 97a according to Rabbi Yehuda: אמה וטפח באמות בינוניות יהא מאמותיו אמה וטפח דאמותיו והן בשל חמשה דהוה ליה של ששה אמה וטפח באלו. וחיק האמה כלומר באלו אמות אני אומר שיהו בנות חמשה וחיק האמה דהיינו יסוד. אלו הקרנות זרת אמה האחד דמאמצעית) and 5 handbreaths in a cubit of the keilim in the Beis hamikdosh (source Keilim 17,10:י\"ז דכלים (משנה י') תנן רבי יהודה אומר אמה של בנין בת ששה טפחים ושל כלים ה')  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Arukh haShulchan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Aruch_HaShulchan.1.363.34?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 363:34</a>) contrasts the ammah used for measuring for an eiruv, and the ammah used for measuring the maximum 4 amos at which carrying an object is prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>One may carry in public on Shabbos less than four amos distance. When measuring those 4 amos, a person built according to the norms for human beings should measure out their own amos -- 4 personal forearms.</p>\n\n<p>But because an eiruv has to be sharable, we use a standardized ammah. (Although in the previous se'ifim he discusses the fact that even with a given opinion of what an ammah should be in modern measures, this is still a range with a \"stingy ammah\" or \"generous ammah\" to be used as appropriate. Humans having only human abilities to measure, Hashem gave Moshe a range, not a specific value.)</p>\n\n<p>When speaking of fasting on Yom Kippur (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Aruch_HaShulchan.1.612.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 612:8</a>), the Arukh haShulchan rules that when we speak of drinking less than  \"melo lugmav -- the fill of his cheeks\" (eg a sick person who must drink but is able to minimize the violation) is indeed his own cheeks.</p>\n\n<p>However, when it comes to food, the measure for Yom Kippur is a kekoseves hagasah (the volume of a particular breed of date, a \"fat\" date). Or in your case of birkhas hamazon (\"bentching\") and most other mitzvos, the unit is a kezayis (olive volume). These would be measured using standard measures. Which makes sense, since even an individual doesn't have a connection to any one particular olive. It's not like an ammah, which refers to a forearm, and a person has only two (one hopes).</p>\n\n<p>So, it would seem the kezayis of bread would stay the same, but the other measures.... Well, remember I wrote about the person being anatomically typical? For example, a thalidomide baby wouldn't have incredibly short amos. Maybe being shrunk would qualify. Maybe not, since everything is still to scale.</p>\n\n<p>But there is another problem with the kezayis. Beyond the kezayis, there is the measure of sevi'ah -- being satiated. For example, by Torah law, birkhas hamazon is only in the context of \"ואכלת ושבעת וברכת - you shall eat, you shall be satiated, and you shall bless.\" We held ourselves to a much stricter standard, and bless G-d for even just a kezayis of food.</p>\n\n<p>But that is assuming that a kezayis is much less than sevi'ah. Your hypothetical shrunk person will be satiated with far less and therefore may be biblically obligated way before reaching the rabbinic limit. And perhaps on Yom Kippur too one can't eat to satiation if someone would have far less than a kekoseves of capacity.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, the Arukh haShulchan doesn't discuss your case. I guess the guy was just.... overlooked?</p>\n\n\n",

However, this assumes that the person willfully intended to commit the sin, which in your case is speaking slander.  It would seem that if you accidentally spoke לשון הרע under your breath AND no one else heard or even saw you forming words, then by the letter of the law you are guiltless.

However for lighting candles on both Erev Shabbat (Friday evening) and Havdalah (Saturday night), I was taught to light them, cover my eyes, say the blessing, then look at the light.</p>\n\n<p>This order of operations does cause one to say the blessing before looking, but \nit seems like there are opinions for Erev Shabbat where men should say the blessing, then light the candles, which seems simpler and seems to be more consistent with the usual \"bracha first\" rule.

And - <em>le-^aniyuth da^ati</em> - even on <em>^erev</em> <em>shabbath</em> it is more correct to recite the <em>berakhah</em> for lighting and then to light afterwards [cf. <em>Hilkhoth Shabbath</em> 5:1].</p>\n\n<p>It is clear according to all, however, that the <em>berakhah</em> of <em>borei me'orei ha-esh</em> is fundamentally different from the <em>berakhah</em> of <em>le-hadliq her shel shabbath</em> in that the former is on the actual lighting of the lamp while the later is on the light itself. Thus, the Rambam writes in the <em>Mishneh Thorah</em>, <em>Hilkhoth Shabbath</em> 29:25, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"[At <em>havdalah</em>] we do not pronounce the blessing on the lamp <strong>until\n  we benefit from its light</strong> to the point that [the light is bright\n  enough that] it is possible to distinguish between coins of various\n  countries.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[See <em>Hilkhoth Shabbath</em> 29:24-29 for a complete set of instructions and regulations regarding the essential <em>miSwah</em> and elements of <em>seder ha-havdalah</em>]</p>\n\n<p>As you correctly noted in your question, this language certainly not only implies but <strong>requires</strong> that the <em>havdalah</em> lamp be lit <strong>before</strong> reciting the <em>berakhah</em> of <em>bore me'orei ha-esh</em>. Most commonly, in order to specifically benefit from the light, people are accustomed to \"inspect\" their fingers and fingernails in the light or to read from a book/<em>siddur</em> during <em>havdalah</em>. [Making a <em>berakhah</em> on the candle while your electric lights are on is almost certainly a <em>berakhah le-vaTalah</em> (a blessing said in vain)!]</p>\n\n<p>One last note. As someone who routinely interacts with and answers questions from those who are either new Jews or newly religious Jews, I can tell you that it is extremely important to always seek the guidance of a competent Rav in any halakhic matter. If one has a friend who is knowledgable in a certain area, then one may rely on that as well (i.e. <em>^aseh lekha rag, uqneh lekha Haver</em> - \"appoint for yourself a Rav, and acquire for yourself a knowledgeable scholar/friend). Confusion abounds from well-meaning Hebrew school teachers and <em>mikveh</em> ladies who feel that they are \"rebbetzins.\" To avoid such confusion, always ask a competent person who is adequately knowledgable in the dictates and principles of the <em>halakhah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.

The entire source of the Biblical <em>mitzvah</em> is, as the Rambam says in Halacha 1, just the one verse of \"ועבדתם, את ה' אלוהיכם\" - \"And you shall serve Hashem your G-d\" (Shemos 23:25).  How did the Rambam derive this 3-part formation of prayer?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The first two are explicitly in the Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=32&format=pdf\">Brachos 32a</a> at the bottom), as pointed out by many commentaries on the Rambam. However, the third is often questioned, either left without a source (the Lechem Mishna) or claimed to be logical (the Maaseh Rokeah).</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=8077&rid=516\">Or Sameach</a> on the Rambam however finds that this is explicitly sourced in the Sifri in Zos HaBracha and in a Tosefta in Munachos (where all three components are essential, and since the Rambam holds the obligation is biblical, thus the component requirements are biblical as well). <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=50513&rid=516\">Kovetz Al Yad HaChazakah</a> spells out the biblical source as quoted in the Yalkut: the structure of Moshe Rabbeinu's blessings in Zos HaBracha, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9997#v=5\">33:5</a> is the praise, followed by the requests, and concluded with the thanks in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9997#v=26\">33:26</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

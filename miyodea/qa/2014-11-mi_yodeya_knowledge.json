The 2 people that they did help happen to be non-Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>Is this true?</p>\n\n<p>If it were true, why is it true?</p>\n\n<p>What did Naaman and the widow do that not one of the Israelites did that Elijah and Elisha helped those gentiles instead of any Jew?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Well, Eliyahu's most-famous, grandest miracle, the battle with the priests of Ba'al on Mount Carmel, was for the benefit of the Israelites who were straying from God's path.  I think that counts for something.  Tradition accords many other miracles to Eliyahu, again for the benefit of Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Elisha performed other miracles than the ones you list.  Here are some, summarized from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/464001/jewish/Elishas-Miracles.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Saving the widow of the prophet Obadiah from poverty and saving her children from being sold into slavery (the pot of oil).</p></li>\n<li><p>Saving the life of the Shunemite woman's child.</p></li>\n<li><p>Sustaining the prophets (who were Jewish) at Gilgal with a miraculous bounty of food (that other guy didn't invent the multiplying-loaves miracle).</p></li>\n<li><p>The miracle of the ax-head at the Jordan, done for one of Elisha's disciples (assumed to be Jewish).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[OP]: Is this true that Elijah and Elisha didn't perform any miracle to help Jews?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course not. See the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/44569/6603\">previous answer</a> for a few details.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[OP]: Christians claim that Elijah and Elisha helped almost nobody.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not a Christian claim, nor is it claimed in the text cited. The New Testament quote is quite clear that the point being made is that Elijah did not aid Israelite <strong>widows</strong> (which, as it happens, is true), and Elisha did not heal Israelite <strong>lepers</strong> (which, again as it happens, is also true). These are not summary statements on the whole of their prophetic careers.</p>\n\n<p>Two other brief observations relevant to the question. (1) Similar sorts of \"incident citation\" can be seen in the Tanakh itself, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16023#v=18&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jeremiah 26:18</a>, which cites a single verse from Micah (3:12). Was this the only thing Micah said? No, of course not. The dynamic is similar in the Luke 4 quote.</p>\n\n<p>(2) Elsewhere in the New Testament Elisha in particular is held up as a model intercessor on behalf of Israel. Even Christian sources understand that these prophets spent themselves primarily for the sake their own people.</p>\n\n\n",

One wants the \"Queen\" to stay as long as she likes.</p>\n\n<p>Those who say tzaischem learn in a way similar to Yaakov and \"Machanaim\" of malachim. That is, as he left Eretz Yisroel the malachim of Chutz Laaretz greeted him and the Malachim of Eretz Yisrael left him. When he returned, the Malachim of Eretz Yisrael greeted him and the Malachim of Chutz Laaretz left.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Boachem are the malachim of Shabbos and the Tzeischem are the Malachim of the rest of the week.

(Now ask an interesting question, is a group like ISIS considered \"a time of concerted effort\", or just a band of individual rogues -- my sense is that if some poor hapless Jewish tourist got lost and found himself in the middle of ISIS-controlled Iraq, he could claim he bumped into some rogues and preserve his own life; whereas if God forbid an extremist Islamic group took over Israel, I'd call that \"a time of concerted effort against our faith.\") Yet in Maimonides' letters to Jews actually in such situations, of massive forced conversions to Islam (it was in Yemen then, I believe?), he told them to do whatever they needed to stay alive. There are some suggestions on how to resolve this, but at first glance, there may be a theoretical law on the books, but practically we recommend that people stay alive. </p>\n\n<p>Note that the Jews of medieval France and Germany chose death over conversion to Christianity, whereas many from Spain a few centuries later chose to become crypto-Jews.

    "content": "# How can the Rambam's Eighth Principle of Jewish Faith be believed in light of Hazal?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam's eighth Principle of Jewish Faith states that the entire Torah in our possession - every verse - was dictated to Mosheh Rabbenu and that it has not changed. </p>\n\n<p>However, we have explicit passages in Hazal that tell us that the Torah had to be critically reconstructed from a multiplicity of scrolls, each with slightly different wording in certain passages (cf. <em>y.Ta`anith</em> 4:2) and that these were apparently used by Ezra HaSofer in his reconstruction (cf. <em>Avoth De-Rabi Nathan</em> 30b). </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we have an explicit text in the <em>Gemara</em> that says that the <em>Amoraim</em> were not experts in defective and plenary spellings in the words of the Torah (cf. <em>b.Qidhushin</em> 30a). </p>\n\n<p>And in the Rambam's own day there were multiple versions of the Torah (differing only in a very few, slight ways), including the <em>mesorah</em> of Yemen which differs from Ashkenazi and Sefaradi <em>mesorah</em> in five places! </p>\n\n<p>Not to mention the accurate placement of <em>petuhoth</em> and <em>setumoth</em>, which has enough halakhic weight to <em>pasul</em> a sefer Torah if made incorrectly.</p>\n\n<p>My question is:</p>\n\n<p>Surely the Rambam knew these passages from <em>Hazal</em> and the facts on the ground, so how could he write such a seemingly dogmatic statement regarding the Torah \"in our possession\"? Are we missing something? Was he?</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: I am aware of the simplistic and non-Maimonidean wording of the popular \"Ani Ma'amin\" on this principle of faith and <strong><em>I reject it</em></strong> as not accurately representing the intent of the Rambam in his fuller, more original wording of the eighth principle.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>R' Yaakov Weinberg, in an audio recording, addressed this issue (as an issue with the ani maamin, which R' Weinberg, like you, rejected), and he explained that the point of the Rambam is <em>not</em> to say that the specific texts which we have now are identical to the one transmitted to Moshe.  Rather, the point of the Rambam is to say that Moshe was a faithful transmitter of the Torah, and did not err nor alter the Torah as it was told to him.  Thus the Rambam writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כלומר שהגיע אליו כולה מאת ה' הגעה שקורין אותה על דרך השאלה דבור</p>\n<p>Which means to say that the entire Torah reached Moshe from Hashem on a level which we call \"speech\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and the Rambam's proof text for this Yesod is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בזאת תדעון כי ה' שלחני וכו ולא מלבי</p>\n<p>With this (the earth swallowing Adas Korach) you shall know that Hashem has sent me ... and I did not make it up</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the source text is a verse stating that Moshe did not make up the Torah.  The point of this Yesod is the accuracy of Moshe's transmission.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I've asked this question to several talmidei chachamim, and all of them have given me the same general response: the Rambam shouldn't be taken too literally, as after all, he certainly knew the passages in Chazal which you've quoted. What he means is that, for all intents and purposes, we have the same Torah. The very slight differences of a plene spelling here or an extra ו there are not meaningful differences that would cause us to say that our Torah is 'a different Torah'. This point is also made in an <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/h/sh/tat/48969731.html\">aish.com article</a> which claims that the words 'colour' to 'color' can still be considered to be the same word. (In reality, the differences in the Torah's text are more significant, but the idea is plausible enough). Even a difference that is <em>halakhically</em> significant (in terms of making the Torah pasul) it still may not be meaningfully significant for the purposes of calling it \"the same Torah\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Like others have pointed out, Rambam's 8th principle speaks to Moshe's personal transmission of the Torah and nothing more.</p>\n<p>However, the logic for why people thought this was a good question in the first place, which I'll briefly recite:</p>\n<p>Premise: Rambam would never disagree on anything any Chazal member would say\nA) Chazal says the last 8 verses were written by Joshua, not Moshe\nB) Rambam says the whole torah was written by moshe (misunderstood)</p>\n<p>Conclusion: There is a problem here, because rambam would never disagree with Chazal, much less call any of them a kofer.</p>\n<p>I can think of two instances where Rambam called out chazal for stating a heretical idea, or a Rishon saying it for him.</p>\n<p>In Moreh Nevuchim when discussing the concept of creation ex nihilo (out of nothing), he quotes 2 sages in Midrash Rabba that say time existed always. Rambam says this is heresy, plain and simple.</p>\n<p>Also, at the beginning of R Yosef Albo's Sefer on Ikkarim, he begins it by saying Rambam is wrong about the 13th principle, Mashiach, because according to Rambam then Rebbe Hillel (Sanhedrin 99a) would be a heretic! Because he says there is no Messiah coming.</p>\n<p>So clearly Rav Yosef Albo thought Rambam had the audacity to go against the sages and even call one of their ideas heretical. Of course, this is only against individual members of Chazal, not the \"Chachamim\", or the majority.</p>\n<p>So, even though I agree that Rambam would have no problem when it comes to the 8th Ikar and reality, the premise of the question (at least as so far related to Chazal saying Moshe didn't write last 8 pesukim) is wrong.</p>\n<p>I say this not to be technical, but to show an important point that we can all learn from.</p>\n\n\n",

A frum guy approached me and asked if I would mind moving as I was sitting in his \"makom kavu'ah\" (designated place).</p>\n\n<p>I was astounded. As this was the train's first stop, and the train was empty (it always is at this stop), I told him that there were plenty of other seats and, as I understood, there was no such thing as a \"makom kavuah\" for commuting on the subway. The guy explained that he recites Tehillim on his trip, and this is a form of davening, and he needs my specific seat. In brief, I didn't budge, and he sat somewhere else.</p>\n\n<p>To simplify my question, I won't address the claim that reciting Tehillim when it's not part of Shacharit or other tefillah would still be considered \"davening\". Perhaps, it is, but I'll leave that for some other question.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, the \"makom kavuah\" is only in a shul or one's home or some other private dwelling and applies only for tefillah. Regardless, I understand that there can not be a \"makom kavuah\" in a public place such as a subway where 1st to occupy a seat gets it. Likewise, if you were to daven by sitting on a park bench in a public park, you could not claim that bench is your \"makom kavu'ah\".</p>\n\n<p>Am I assuming correctly, or can a public spot really be a \"makom kavu'ah\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Heard from my rav last night:</p>\n\n<p>The concept of \"makom kavu'ah\" came from Avraham in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39996&st=&pgnum=80\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breishit 13:3-4</a> where Avraham returned to the same place to daven.

The Shulchan Aruch 206:2 holds that it works, while the Mishna Berura 206:10 cites opinions who disagree.  So if coffee were to get a Ha'adama, and you held like the opinions cited in the Mishna Berura, your shehakol would not work.  If you held like the Shulchan Aruch, it would work, as far as the issue of making the correct blessing is concerned.</p>\n\n<p>If you hold that coffee is a shehakol, it depends on why it is shehakol.  If it is shehakol because the water is the primary element and the coffee is just a flavoring (implication of the Shvus Yaakov 2:5 in comparing it to beer, in which the grain does not go into the water, but just flavors it (Tos. 37a s.v. Hai Duvsha)), then the water is the same water and there is nothing to discuss - your brewed coffee is the same water, with a secondary ingredient added in.  If it is because the coffee is not edible and is therefore not a real \"pri\" (this possibility is mentioned in Panim Meiros 2:190) then the coffee is shehakol, and now that it has been brewed, it remains shehakol, but now it is shehakol as the resulting product of the coffee bean, not as the original bean.  In that case, you have a \"new\" shehakol here that was not present before.  Even so, I would think the Mishna Berura (206:8) is applicable, namely that if you are explicitly intending to cover a food that is not present, it is still covered by the blessing.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, if the blessing on coffee is ha'adama, then it may not work.  If the blessing on coffee is shehakol, then it almost certainly works.</p>\n\n<p>CYLOR.</p>\n\n\n",

[כ\"כ מ\"א וא\"ר ובישועות יעקב מגמגם בזה ועיין בחתם סופר בחלק אה\"ע ח\"ב סי' פ\"ב שדעתו דאף שאנו אין מאכילין אותו מחמת שהוא בחזקת בריא מ\"מ החולה עצמו היודע מרת נפשו יוכל ליקח לעצמו ולאכול <strong>בין ביוה\"כ בין בשאר איסורין</strong> כיון שמרגיש בעצמו שיוכל - לבא לידי סכנה]: If his face didn't change coulour we don't feed him. But The Chassam sofer says that even though we don't feed him (because he looks healthy), if he feels endagered he can take food for himself as much as he needs to save himself because a man knows his own pain and can act accordingly This applies whether yom kippur or other forbiddon foods (i.e eating treif, chometz on pesach etc. in a situation of pikuach nefesh).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So its all dependent on the person if he really feels he has to eat because he feels his life is threatened he may eat regardless of other peoples opinions.</strong><br>\n (The following siman S.A O.C 618 talks in detail about someone who is unwell from the start, when we are allowed to feed him but it is beyond the scope of this article to quote that entire siman and was also left out of the question).</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong> However if one is not expecting any kosher food and only has treif food available for the foreseeable future (e.g in a desert), instead of waiting forever he may eat straight away what he needs to keep him going. This is comparable to Shulchan aruch orach chaim 344 which states that he is allowed to work seven days a week straight when he is in a desert in order to to find drink and food to keep himself alive for that day (he can start doing Melacha to find food and drink as soon as the day begins) when each day is Saphek Shabbos. (if he knew then when shabbos was he would make sure to get enough to drink and eat in 6 days so there woudn't be pikuach nefesh). </p>\n\n<p>S.A O.C 344,1 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ההולך בכל יום במדבר ואינו יודע מתי הוא שבת \n   ואז יעשה מלאכה בכל יום כדי פרנסתו מצומצמת  -<br>\n  one who goes in the desert every day and doesn't know when shabbos is,he can do melacha every day according to what he needs to live for that day only.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The mishna berura states:     </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כדי פרנסה מותר שנוגע לפקו\"נ שאם לא יעשה מלאכה ימות -<br>\n  To save ones life its permitted to do melacha for up to what he needs and transgress Shabbos (working 7 days in a row is definitely transgressing Shabbos) otherwise he will die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>When stranded and not expecting Kosher food, he eats treif straight away when he needs</strong>(as long as its just what he needs to survive),<strong>since each bite is keeping him alive longer he is saving his life through that action of eating treif.</strong> (once one knows he definitely needs to eat treif, he doesn't have to wait till just before he drops dead, rather start now and only eat as a necessity from now on). </p>\n\n\n",

If so, I assume it's so the <em>ger</em> knows what he's getting into and/or so he gets practice, but is that demand codified in <em>halacha</em>  or only a practical measure taken by <em>bate din</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A perspective convert is not obligated to keep any extra mitzvos for it. Today it is common for a beis din to independently decide as a matter of policy to require the show of commitment of a candidate practicing while readying him/herself for the actual conversion. After all, the person could try the lifestyle and find it leaves them cold, avoiding a possible mistake. But at least the person will be in practice, and less likely to forget to wash hands before eating or make a berakhah, or the like. But it's not a halachic duty on the person, as there is no special halachic category of being \"pre-conversion\". Nor is such observance a mandatory part of the conversion process.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, a problem for prospective converts are the one or two mitzvos that  non-Jew ought not keep.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Shabbos. Hashem describes Shabbos as \"an eternal sign between Me and the Jewish People.\" A non-Jew observing Shabbos is somewhere between theft and pseudo-adultery. For men, one clever solution is to wear tzitzis. For a Jew, who is obligated in wearing tzitzis, the tassles are considered subsidiary to the garment, which is worn on Shabbos. For a non-Jew, the tassles are unnecessary in terms of attire, so they are being carried no less than if they were in the person's pocket. There is also a question whether an eiruv works for a non-Jew, so carrying in an eiruv would be something the prospective convert can do without standing out amongst his shul mates.</p>\n\n<p>The limits of Torah study for a non-Jew is more complex, with many extant rulings. Obviously they're allowed to learn the things they need to know to be good Jews day one -- applicable laws, the fundamental beliefs (which the Chovos haLvavos would also call \"applicable laws\", the title of the book is \"Duties of the Heart\"), and likely Tanakh. Paritcularly someone living in a Christian culture, where Tanakh is respected, if under a different name and in a translation that has a number of alterations. But because there is a variety of rulings, the applied rules would depend on the beis din.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I heard from R. Nota Greenblatt, one of America's foremost poskim, that this is a relatively recent development.  In Europe converts expressed dedication to keep mitzvos, and then \"learned on the job\"</p>\n\n\n",

At one point, the Alter Rebbe offered the Tzemach Tzedek to give him a blessing for great insight into Torah, and the Tzemach Tzedek demurred, saying he wanted to earn the Torah through his own efforts.</p>\n\n<p>When he was older, the Tzemach Tzedek said he regretted that decision, since in Torah there are always higher levels to earn, and he could have been so much further.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/ta/5769/beraishis.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Efraim Levine:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the fourth blessing of the shemona esrei\n  prayer we recite “You graciously endow Adam with\n  da’as and teach Enosh, binah.” In this phrase we\n  encounter two different titles for man and two different\n  terms for wisdom. The commentators explain the word\n  Adam relative to Enosh connotes a positive reference\n  to man whereas Enosh connotes the weakness, frailty\n  and mortality of man.\n  <br><br><br></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R' Levine goes on to explain that <i> Adam </i> can only be singular, which connotes a solitary presence, whereas <i> Enosh </i> has a plural version, <i> Anoshim </i>.  This teaches us that <i>Enosh</i> refers to humans that are willing to work with each other.  Kain and Hevel weren't willing to work together (or at least Kain wasn't).  When Seth had a son, he named him Enosh, to signify people working together from then on.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We may return to our question as to why we\n  match the term binah with Enosh. The commentators\n  explain the da’as represents the basic building blocks\n  of wisdom. Binah represents a deeper form of\n  understanding. Binah requires one to combine multiple\n  pieces of information and compare them one to\n  another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R' Levine also points out that <i> binah </i> is mentioned in Avot 6:6, that we gain binah through pilpul hatalmidim; students discussing law with each other, each sharpening the others' binah, or understanding.\n<br><br></p>\n\n<p>We now see that, \"melamed l'enosh binah\" can be understood to mean that G-d 'taught', i.e. created within the quality of Enosh, the potential to have 'binah', i.e. pilpul, working with others, making each other better.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, there is no contradiction.  G-d created Enosh to have binah and work with others, but binah is still a pure gift, just like everything else that G-d gives us. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Sefer HaIkarim 1:15 and the Avnei Eliyahu from the Gra\"h on the siddur explain that \"da'as\" is the \"מושכלות הראשונות\" - the simple matters, the initial innate knowledge that a person has.  This knowledge, which is similar to instinct, is given to man.</p>\n\n<p>Binah, on the other hand, is when someone extrapolates from that primal body of information and forms new understandings.</p>\n\n<p>The Sefer HaIkarim explains that thus da'as is paired with Adam, man, as it is the lowest common denominator and everyone has and uses it.  Binah, however, is a higher level, and requires \"natural\" learning, i.e. personal effort to understand, which only Enosh reaches (Maharal Derech Chaim 3:17 demonstrates this implication of Enosh from Tehillim 55:14 - ואתה אנוש כערכי).  Therefore, binah goes a step further and requires \"teaching\" and \"learning.\"</p>\n\n<p>(Up until here primarily from the Sefer HaIkarim)</p>\n\n<p>However, binah (and all Torah knowledge) still requires a gift from Hashem.  The requisite \"learning\" is on top of that which it must be given by Hashem.  Torah knowledge is not naturally learned - it is Divine knowledge, which must be given by Hashem.  R Weinberg demonstrated this from the famous statement of Chazal (Eicha Rabba 2:13) - חכמה באומות תאמין תורה באומות אל תאמין - \"If you are told that there is wisdom in the Nations, believe it, but Torah in the Nations, do not believe it\" - Torah is different than \"wisdom\" and is not just another body of information.  Similarly, the Alei Shur points out that the Gemara in Megillah 6b says \"יגעתי ומצאתי תאמין\" - \"If someone says they put in effort <em>and found</em>, believe them\" - even once you put in your effort, Torah knowledge is still \"found\" - it is something that, in a certain sense, you stumble upon, because its attainment is not the natural result of your efforts.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, \"binah\" necessitates the higher level of \"melamed,\" but that is in addition to the baseline requirement of \"chonein,\" which all knowledge requires.</p>\n\n\n",

He specifically mentioned the importance of getting up to get a sefer off the shelf, as opposed to having everything at your fingertips.

You need to invest effort into furthering your learning.</p>\n\n<p>We had a \"post-game\" discussion about how far this goes - should you poke out your left eye to make learning more strenuous? - but the basic attitude of the Rosh Yeshiva is pretty clear.

It says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here we do not expel God's presence. Here there are no computers or\n  other devices that can receive / display internet or movies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This attitude is very strong among a certain segment of the Ultra-Orthodox population in Israel.  Different subgroups have different levels of stringency, ranging from absolutely forbidden to permissible if it's necessary for work.  So for example, I've seen computer smashing ceremonies for Baalai Tshuva, but on the other hand I've seen many UltraO. here with laptops and smart phones in their homes.  It's still a very contentious issue, so for example most UltraO. schools here require that there not be a TV or computer in the home, and if they get wind of one the children will be expelled from school. Yet as I pointed out above there is also a recognition that for some people computers may be unavoidable due to their work.  So for example ten years ago, my chiropractor, who is a UltraO. Rav, used to hide his computer in a closet in his office, and made sure to tell me not to mention it to anyone because his kids would be kicked out of school.  Now he has a laptop on his secretary's desk because it's recognized as needed for work.  </p>\n\n<p>I'd like to take this beyond computer's.  It used to be fairly common here that people in the UltraO. community would have radio's in their homes, which were modified to only receive UltraO. stations.  And then there are the UltraO. newspapers which have Rabbinic review and supervision of their content, such as Yated and Mishpacha.  Basically, there is an attitude that people don't want to be exposed to objectionable material, and that includes objectionable ideas or information, from the UltraO point of view.</p>\n\n<p>So basically, the main stream attitude here is that computers are spiritually dangerous, but for many people are a necessary evil in order for them to earn a living.  Beyond their potential for exposing one to visually immodest material, they are also a potential source of exposure to ideas and information which hasn't been vetted by the Rabbinic establishment.  So that's one reason why you won't see them in most Betai Midrash even though it's technically possible to completely lock them down, and as Shmuel pointed out there exist collections of religious writings which have been fully vetted and had objectionable ideas or information removed from them.</p>\n\n\n",

It does not seem from the <em>G'mara</em> that they considered just turning around rather than passing by either one so this is tantamount to a forced choice.</p>\n<p>The transgression in either case seems to derive from the same source (cf. <em>Tosafos</em> \"nezil\"), which is the <em>pasuk</em> in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.5.8?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 5:8</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַרְחֵ֣ק מֵעָלֶ֣יהָ דַרְכֶּ֑ךָ וְאַל־תִּ֝קְרַ֗ב אֶל־פֶּ֥תַח בֵּיתָֽהּ׃</p>\n<p>Keep yourself far away from her; Do not come near the doorway of her house</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The actual prohibitions involved are at least <em>mid'rabanan</em>, with the prohibition of physically approaching an opportunity for sexual misconduct being <em>mid'oraisa</em> according to some (e.g. Ula). I'm not sure what the status of physically approaching an opportunity for theopractical misconduct is in this <em>g'mara</em>.</p>\n<p>This qualifies as \"classic\" by appearing in the <em>G'mara</em>, but I don't know how often it is quoted.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One case that comes to mind is the Mishnah in BM 33a, where one must decide between \"you are not able to hide\" from taking your father's lost object and \"you are not able to hide\" from taking your Rebbi's lost object. One should take his Rebbi's unless his father is also a Talmid Chacham. It continues with other cases of deciding between positive commandments, but those aren't applicable for the sake of this question. Nevertheless, even this case is deciding between two applications of the same prohibition. </p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah in Horayos 13a gives a few other cases, which are still applications of the same prohibition to two people: \"you are not able to hide\" of a man's lost object versus a woman's (man wins) and \"do not stand [by idly] by your friend's blood [being spilled]\" of a man versus a woman (man still wins), in addition to several positive commandments between man and woman (in which woman wins).</p>\n\n<p>The tenth perek of Eiruvin opens up with several cases involving bringing lost pairs of tefillin inside the Eiruv on Shabbos; this is both \"you are unable to hide\" and disrespecting the Tefillin (which, although their place is unspecified in the Mishnah, may very well be on the ground or in a place where they will be ruined) versus violating Shabbos (of which the passuk says שמור, an expression of a negative commandment). The Mishnah paskens that Shabbos is more important, and one should either wear the Tefillin into the Eiruv and then take them off, or, if there are too many or if they're tangled (as untying is a violation of Shabbos) one must stay by them until after Shabbos and then carry them back inside. </p>\n\n\n",

An analogy can be made using the difference between honey and milk. Manure is actually that which is rejected by the non-kosher animal. It is not created in the animal's body. As a result, it is considered as external chemical that have been separated from the food that the animal ate, broken down into chemical components (so it is no longer considered as having the status of that food) and then excreted without ever having been part of the animal.</p>\n\n<p>The analogy of honey and milk is based on this fact. The honey is totally exterior to the bee and does not get the status of the bee as I explain at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/38785/was-the-honey-that-samson-ate-from-the-lion-kosher/38797#38797\">Was the honey that Samson ate from the lion kosher?</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/38783/is-honey-extracted-from-a-dead-bee-kosher/38796#38796\">Is honey extracted from a dead bee kosher?</a> Similarly, the manure is not \"created\" from the body of the animal and is kosher in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, you are not \"eating\" the manure. It is totally broken down, absorbed by the plants and used as food. An animal is allowed to eat non-kosher food and does not become non-kosher from doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Another example would be the fact that fish eat worms and other non-Kosher things but that does not make them non-Kosher. Once the animal eats it, it loses its identity. Note that this means after it has been digested and absorbed into the animal. If it has not yet been digested, and is excreted unchanged, then it retains its original identity.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the halachos of asur behana'ah do not apply with this matter.</p>\n\n\n",

The Pasuk says \"לֹא-תֵלֵךְ רָכִיל בְּעַמֶּיךָ\" - \"Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people\" (Leviticus 19:16). The words \"among thy people\" teach you that one is only forbidden to speak Lashon Hora about those who are included within \"thy people\". This goes so far as to include a Jew who has removed himself from the category of amongst his people (by committing certain sins that classify him as a wicked person; what those sins are is a whole different discussion). This limitation of \"עַמֶּיךָ\" also excludes non-Jews form the prohibition of Lashon Hora, as they are not included in עַמֶּיךָ.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, as you mentioned in your question and other comments, there might be other considerations with regards to speaking 'Lashon Hora' (note: to simplify things, when I write Lashon Hora in quotations, I'm referring to words that would be considered Lashon Hora if they were said to/about a Jew). You brought up Chillul Hashem, which has it's own separate Halachos as to what it is. If what one says is a Chillul Hashem, it is of course forbidden, even though it might not be a sin of Lashon Hora.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason to avoid speaking 'Lashon Hora' about non-Jews is because it creates a bad habit. We humans are creatures of habit, and if we get in the habit of speaking 'Lashon Hora' when it is permitted, we might accidentally start speaking Lashon Hora when it is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>This does have a few important practical applications. For example, if your Jewish coworkers are badmouthing your Jewish boss (even without you joining in, just listening),  you might have an obligation to protest the Lashon Hora in some manner. If he were non-Jewish, you would likely not need to make a protest over the 'Lashon Hora' (as there is no prohibition of Loshon Hara). (You may need to protest due to other factors such as Chillul Hashem depending on the situation, but this answer is just focusing on the Loshon Hara aspect.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In one the hayom yoms it says that it is even worse to speak lashon horo about a goy because it can also be a chilul Hashem</p>\n\n\n",

There is a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon whether performing an action that is a dvar sheinamitchaven is permitted or forbidden.

So one part of something forbidden to 60 parts of something permitted. This is derived from a verse, but the idea is that once something is one to sixty you can be assured that the taste is not there.</p>\n\n<p>The classic case is if a drop of milk spills into a large pot of meat stew - if the drop of milk is less than 1 to 60 then the mixture did not become forbidden. There are limitations to this principle (like if the problem can be found and discreetly removed or if the item is a flavoring ingredient and thus has a stronger taste than typical for its volume), but that is the idea.</p>\n\n<p>One important point of this is that it is only permitted if it was done by accident or without intention to remove the problem. So Batel BeShishim LeChatchila is the idea of doing this mix on purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Mevatel Issur LeChatchila is the general idea of doing something to remove the prohibition of some mixture without actually removing the forbidden substance. So lets say, in the above example, a piece of butter fell into the meat stew (less than 1 to 60). You could remove it before it melts, but instead it is mixed on purpose into the stew and melted in. Well, if that happened by accident, it would be fine, but since this was intentionally done it creates another set of problems, with only specific circumstances permitting it.</p>\n\n<p>Another example of the latter that doesn't involve the 1 to 60 ratio is an infested produce where the bugs are already less than 1 to 60. It is still forbidden to eat that as long as the bugs are whole, so in order to remove the problem, the produce could be pureed (or according to some, frozen) to break down the whole bug into parts, thus permitting the mixture. Again, this can only be done in a limited set of circumstances.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The phrases refer to the nullification of an unacceptable substance (the first, in a larger substance 60 times the amount, the second in general) intentionally.</p>\n\n<p>Often, the presence of a forbidden substance can be nullified AFTER THE FACT if there is a halachic method, but one cannot go into a situation introducing a forbidden substance with the a priori intention of considering it nullified by invoking the a posteriori logic beforehand. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some added sources courtesy of the Star-K</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One may not mix even a small amount of non-kosher food into kosher\n  food.23  This is known as “ain mevatlin issur l’chatchila.” \n  Similarly, one may not put a small amount of milk into a very large\n  pot of meat, even though the milk will be batel b’shishim.  If one did\n  this intentionally, he, his family, and the person for whom he is\n  mevatel it may not eat it.24  However, if a gentile company adds a\n  non-kosher ingredient and the non-kosher ingredient is batel, a kosher\n  consumer may buy this product as there is no prohibition of “ain\n  mevatlin” for the gentile.25  This is only true if it was not done\n  explicitly for Yidden.</p>\n  \n  <p>23 Y.D. 99:5</p>\n  \n  <p>24 Y.D. 99:5 and Taz 98:10. See also Reb Akiva Eiger. In regards to\n  selling it, see Rama & Taz 99:12.</p>\n  \n  <p>25 See Darchei Teshuva 108:20.

What is a \"forbidden\" food? Are there foods that are \"permitted\" but not kosher/not kosher-certified? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>That answer has follow-up comments discussing exactly your question. The answerer is assuming that the Halachah under discussion (not to recite a Berachah on \"forbidden\" foods) is worded carefully by the Shulhan 'Aruch and relates not only to foods that have an inherent Kashruth problem, but also to foods that a person has forbidden to himself or someone else has made forbidden to him - ie., through a vow.  It is not that the food itself is \"unkosher\"; but it is still forbidden for the person to eat it.</p>\n\n<p>{It is worth noting that the plain reading of the Halachah is that the Shulhan 'Aruch was discussing \"unkosher\" foods, and was emphasizing their \"forbiddenness\" as relates to the <em>level</em> of the prohibition - Torah vs. Rabbinic - not the <em>nature</em> of the prohibition.  This seems to be @DoubleAA's main objection, but he is free to comment here to correct me.}</p>\n\n\n",

But the debt of the wicked he repays to them in their presence, and it is not repaid by their children unless they also sin, lest the children die for the fathers:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One can also add one important detail, that repentance of the wicked can immediately change their status as explained by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.10?lang=bi&with=Da%27at%20Zekenim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daas Zekeinim</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומשלם לשונאיו אל פניו, “but He will make a reckoning with those who hate Him to their face,” i.e. He will make a reckoning immediately and not wait one thousand generations for their descendants to become penitents. <em>But as soon as such people become penitents</em>, they will become the beneficiaries of My promises to their forefathers. Therefore, as Moses said in Deuteronomy 7,12: והיה עקב תשמעון וגו', “it will come to pass as an immediate result of your listening to My voice that all My promises will be showered upon you.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Traditionally, the status of a person as righteous vs. wicked is determined based on the full account of mitzvos and transgressions after a person dies. Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.39b.2?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 39b</a> discusses this subject in some detail. To summarize the discussion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Yehuda said ...: Anyone who performs one mitzva in addition to his other merits, and thereby tips the scale of all his deeds to the side of righteousness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, a righteous person has his/her scale tilted in favor of mitzvos, and the wicked person in favor of his/her aveiros. Additionally,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Pe’a 1:1): These are the matters that a person engages in and enjoys their profits in this world, and the principal reward remains for him for the World-to-Come, and they are: Honoring one’s father and mother, acts of loving kindness, hospitality toward guests, and bringing peace between one person and another; and Torah study is equal to all of them.</p>\n<p>Rav Shemaya said: The mishna serves to say that if one’s sins and merits were of equal balance, i.e., he has accrued an equal amount of merit and sin, one of these mitzvot tilts the scale in his favor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

That is a good idea, regardless, as the compatibility is more likely to be there. (The only exception to your list is persons of color - my observation is that they tend to find a person of a different color who doesn't have a hangup about it).</p>\n\n<p>In addition, There are other members of the community that aren't on the \"inside track\" of shidduchim with which to make a shidduch, such as children of ba'alei Teshuva, etc. Compatibility has a lot to do with the age at which the person became a ba'al teshuva. If they started at 13/14 years old, and went through the regular school system at the end of their school years, it is very different than the 30 year old.</p>\n\n<p>The main problem with this is that there is some view that those who are frum from birth from families with a long history of observance are somehow an inherently superior shidduch for a ba'al teshuva. In fact, compatibility in their life together is much more important.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of where to find a Shadchan to make such a shidduch, the way to look is to find recently married people of similar circumstances and ask them how they made their shidduch, and follow those leads. You can also ask people who aren't married in a similar circumstance - perhaps they found a lead and are \"in the parsha\".</p>\n\n<p>In the type of groups you are talking about, there are always people in the group who are very into knowing who is related to who and how they form the circle of the group (call it Olympic level Jewish geography). As such, some people always know who the Ba'al Teshuva is, so you can find out by asking around.</p>\n\n<p>I am reminded of a story where a Ba'al Teshuva wrote to the Lubavitcher Rebbe that he was having a hard time finding a shidduch for his children. The Rebbe wrote him back that the other Chassidim he inherited from his father-in-law, the Ba'alei Teshuva he chose as Chassidim.</p>\n\n<p>I'll tell you another story about someone I know who is in a Chabad community. He is not a Ba'al Teshuva at all (from a long line of non-Chabad Chassidim with many generations of Yichus) however he had a hard time with a Shidduch for his son because he kept the traditional clothing - streimel, etc. which was out of the norm for a Chabad family. So he looked for a Shidduch in Chassidic communities that demand large dowries from the girls (there is no such thing in Chabad circles). He found a good family that happened to be poor - and they were more than happy to make the Shidduch.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the bottom line is that there are many such shidduchim made all the time, where people don't fit the pre-defined mold, and shadchanim who specialize in them. However, there does need to be an adjustment of expectations, which is a good thing for a happy marriage.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Many baal-teshuva yeshivas in Israel specialize in making shiduchim, often between their talmidim and an affiliated girls' seminary. For example, I attended a yeshiva in Jerusalem made up mostly of baalei teshuva (already frum; not a kiruv yeshiva). During my time there, many students became engaged and married, often to students at the yeshiva's sister institution. Many of the rebbeim teach at both the yeshiva and the seminary, so they are in a good position to make shidduchim. In addition, there is the additional benefit (depending on your perspective) of being set up with another BT who understands where you are coming from and is being taught in a place with a similar hashkafa to where you are learning.</p>\n\n\n",

In a synagogue with no mourners, they'll usually have someone say at least one kaddish (usually the one after Aleinu). I had a teacher who lost a parent relatively early in life; years later, he was working at one yeshiva that asked him to say every mourner's kaddish, which he found difficult as it brought up memories of the first year of loss. But he was fine doing one kaddish per service.</p>\n\n<p>So if there's no one saying kaddish, and the chazzan (or any person in the congregation, for that matter) lost a parent years ago (or has his parents' permission), he certainly could and likely should do so. The question here is saying it along with an uncomfortable mourner. (Keep in mind there are synagogues that give each mourner one kaddish of his own, so the mourner would be used to saying it solo! But most mourners at this point are used to a chorus -- or cacophony -- of sorts.) I think this will be the local rabbi's call (plus whoever's being asked to say kaddish) whether the mourner's comfort warrants having someone unnecessarily saying kaddish, plus any discomfort to whoever's saying it. </p>\n\n\n",

He concludes that if one relates one's problems to the dead hoping that they will intercede with God it is permissible, but if one wants help from them directly, it would be forbidden. He emphasises that even using them as intermediaries is forbidden according to many authorities.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Schick\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Ish Hai</a> writes in a responsum (Rav P'alim Vol II YD 31) that it is forbidden to make requests of a dead person directly. Doing so constitutes doresh el hametim. One may only ask that the dead intercede with God. He writes this in explanation of the Zohar (Acharei Mot: 71) which is quoted by some as a source to permit praying to the dead:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>נמצא לא הותר לאדם להתפלל על קברי הצדיקים, לשאול בקשתו מן הצדיקים עצמן, כי זה חשיב דורש אל המתים, אלא הוא מתפלל ושואל בקשתו מהקב\"ה, ורק מבקש מנפש הצדיק שתתפלל עליו לפני הקדוש ברוך הוא, שישמע תפלתו ויעשה בקשתו</p>\n<p><strong>Always forbidden</strong></p>\n<p>Others, take an even harsher stance; that it forbidden even if the request from the deceased is just that it intercede with God. <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Some invoked this story in Sotah as justification. However, those authorities who prohibit such activities clarify that the passage is not a proof. For example, R. Hayim Paltiel of Magdeburg cited by the Bach (ibid), writes that the passage in Sota refers to praying to God, and merely using the grave-site as a holy location which at which it is advantageous to pray:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דלא מצינו רק גבי כלב שנשתטח על קברי אבות- היינו שמתפללים לה', ומקום קדוש גורם שתהא תפילתם נשמעת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[It is not clear to me exactly how he read the passage in Sotah; perhaps he had a variant text.]</p>\n<p>Most sources saying it is forbidden do not mention the passage. Perhaps this is because it is aggadic <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/53349/belief-in-midrashim/53351#53351\">and does not carry the same authority as halakhic passages</a>. Additionally, even were the passage in Ta'anit halakhic, not every halakhic position in the Talmud is accepted. In this matter, for example, we have already noted commentators who understand the matter of addressing prayers to the dead to be the subject of a Talmudic dispute. Accordingly, the passage in Sotah could be aligned with the view in Ta'anit that permits, while the aforementioned authorities could nevertheless rule against it, in accordance with the other view in Ta'anit.</p>\n<p><strong>And if so is there any teaching in Judaism that the deceased can hear when someone calls to them</strong></p>\n<p>Although you are only asking for sources that the deceased can hear one praying according to those who invoke the passage in Sotah as a source to beseech the dead, in reality, the question exists in a vacuum; that is, even if it is forbidden to beseech the dead, they may still be able to hear the living.</p>\n<p>An aggadic passage in Berakhot 18b indicates that the dead are aware of the goings on in the world, and can hear people talking to them. However, others are of the opinion that the dead are not aware of what is happening in their vicinity. (See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Qafih</a>'s explanation of Rambam's Hilkhot Evel (14:13). One verse that indicates the contrary is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.9.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ecclesiastes (9:5)</a> which states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַחַיִּים יוֹדְעִים, שֶׁיָּמֻתוּ; וְהַמֵּתִים אֵינָם יוֹדְעִים מְאוּמָה</p>\n<p>The living know they will die; but the dead don't know a thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a similar vein, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_ibn_Balaam\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yehuda ibn Bil'am</a> writes in his commentary to Isaiah (8:19):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנפש אין לה שום ידיעה אחר פרידתה מן הגוף</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The soul has no knowledge after its separation from the body.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> similarly implies that he understands the verse in Ecclesiastes simply, and that for this reason, any prayers to or through the dead, are absurd in his commentary to Isaiah (8:19):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל זה שאתם אומרים לנו שנדרוש אל האובות והידעונים זהו דבר שאין הדעת סובלתו  כי הם מתים, ואיך נדרוש בעד החיים אל המתים, כי המתים אינם יודעים מאומה</p>\n<p>But this that you say to us, that we should seek out the <em>ovot</em> and <em>yidonim</em>, this is something that the intellect does not accommodate, for they are dead! And how can we beseech the dead on behalf of the living, for the dead don't know anything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>If Judaism allows praying to ancestors then how would that be distinguished from the forbidden practice of necromancy</strong></p>\n<p>At this point I will mention some of the opinions of those who permit such practices. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_ben_Samuel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Eliezer of Metz</a> writes in his Sefer Yereim (334-335) that the prohibition of doresh el hametim only includes involvement with the body of the deceased; involvement with the spirit of the deceased, however, would be permitted. This is one of the sources cited in justification of the practice to distinguish it from forbidden practices.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See tshuvas Binyan Tzion from Rav Etlenger siman 67 where he says 'even being <em>doresh</em> from [requesting of] the dead in the grave is <em>muttar</em> [allowed] as we find the greatest amoraim doing doing so, as long as one is not doresh from the body of the deceased but rather from his spirit'. \nThis is an idea mentioned in the Beis Yosef in Yoreh Deah siman brought in the Shach there siff kattan 16 where he mentions a Taz who disagrees with this distinction, but settles it. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>In a nutshell, yes. There are many stories in the talmud and medrash where great men prayed to their ancestors. </p>\n\n<p>It is halachicaly accepted as seen in Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim siman 579 with Magen Avraham 11. </p>\n\n<p>The source of confusion is found in the Mishna Berurah siman 581 siff katan 27 where the simplistic reading would seem that we may not pray to the dead. I'll quote and translate his words \"a cemetery is the resting place of the righteous and prayers are accepted there more readily, but do not pray to the dead, rather request that God should have pity on him in the merit of the righteous who rest in the ground\". </p>\n\n<p>But considering that it is against many chazzal, we must assume he means something else. First let's quote Chazzal which are explicitly not like this simplistic reading. See Taanis 16a where one opinion says we pray in the cemetery so the dead can ask mercy for us. See also Chagiga 22b where Rabi Yehoshua stretched out on Shamai's grave, begging him for forgiveness. This, of course, is not a prayer per se but it is a conversation and a request made to a dead person. Also see the famous medrash in the pesichta to eicha rabba 24 where Yirmiyahu went to the avos and Moshe to ask them to beseech Hashem for mercy.</p>\n\n<p>We must assume then that the Mishna Berurah means something else. We can easily read his words as saying that the dead are not empowered to help of their own accord, rather we pray to them to in turn go pray to Hashem. \n This is in fact the end of the  narrative in Eicha Rabba where Rachel  went to beseech Hashem to have mercy on us. </p>\n\n<p>Also of interest, if you look up the gemara in Taanis you will see another opinion why to pray in the cemetery, and that is to show Hashem that we are as if dead. The gemara says the practical difference between the two opinions is whether or not to go to a non-Jewish cemetery, and as Rashi explains, a place with no Jewish graves to ask for rachamim even upon themselves, and certainly on us. We see from here that the dead do pray, and for themselves as well.</p>\n\n\n",

However, the Torah does recognize the differences between races, in that those differences have been encouraged and cultivated throughout the generations to the extent that those traits are programmed into the makeup of the person. The Torah differentiates groups based on the character and morals of the people, and that if those traits are negative, then the people are to be viewe negativly.

But if they have legally\nconverted, and as I have heard they are doing, we shall consider them\nlike all Jews, and one must assist them and support them for all needs\nof livelihood, both physically and spiritually. <strong>And I suffered great\nanguish because I have heard there are those in Israel who are not\ndrawing them close in spiritual matters and are causing, G-d forbid,\nthat they might be lost from Judaism. And it seems to me these people\nare behaving so only because the color of the Falashas' skin is black.\nIt is obvious that one must draw them close, not only because they are\nno worse than the rest of the Jews – and because there is no\ndistinction in practical application of the law because they are black\n– but also because one can say perhaps they are gerim [converts], and\nare therefore included in the mitzva \"and you shall love the convert.\"</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1TcMP.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1TcMP.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Different people are subject to different halachos (Jewish laws), based on three subdivisions of human beings:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Gender</li>\n<li>Age</li>\n<li>Jew / Gentile <br><br>\n(Within Jews, there are of course several categories, including Kohen, Levi, Mamzer, Nazir, etc., but they aren't relevant to a discussion of racism)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are never any legal differences based on skin color, eye color, or hair color.</p>\n\n<p>Any differences based on ethnic origin (Amalek, Moav, Ammon) are unenforceable today, simply because we have no clue who is considered to belong to those nations, in modern times.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, one who wishes to base his or her worldview on Jewish law, cannot believe that any ethnic or racial group is inherently different than any other such group. <br><br> (By contrast, men and women <i>are</i> inherently different; even if they are equally capable of many many things, they do have predetermined physical, emotional, and spiritual differences.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>we recognize that certain nations have negative predispositions. for example the talmud says arabs tend towards sexual immorality more than any other nation (Kidushin 49b).

    "content": "# Why did God create us in such a way that we enjoy things most if we work hard to attain them?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Book Mesilat Yesharim, the Ramhal, states that the reason we were put on this world is to work hard, fight the yetzer hara, and accept the reward in the World To Come. He goes on to say that if we just receive the rewards for free it wouldn't be as enjoyable to us.</p>\n\n<p>If God wanted to give us reward with maximum enjoyability, he could have just created us with the ability to enjoy free stuff without any work just as well. </p>\n\n<p>Since God is without any limitations, why would he restrict us to only enjoy rewards in this particular way?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In Derech Hashem 1:2, the Ramchal provides the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובהיותו הוא לבדו יתברך הטוב האמיתי, לא יסתפק חפצו הטוב אלא בהיותו מהנה לזולתו בטוב ההוא עצמו שהוא בו יתברך מצד עצמו, שהוא הטוב השלם והאמיתי. והנה מצד אחר, הטוב הזה אי אפשר שיימצא אלא בו. על כן גזרה חכמתו, שמציאות ההטבה האמיתית הזאת יהיה במה שיינתן מקום לברואים לשיתדבקו בו יתברך באותו השיעור שאפשר להם שיתדבקו; ואז נמצא, שמה מצד עצמם אי אפשר שיתוארו בשלימות כשלימותו יתברך, הנה מצד התדבקם בו יגיע להם באותו השיעור שאפשר לתאר בשלימות ההוא יתברך, מצד היותם מתדבקים בו,</p>\n<p>Since Hashem alone is authentic good, it would not be sufficient for His desire to bestow good except through giving the good that He Himself is, which is complete good.  And from a different angle, this good is impossible to exist except in Him.  Therefore, His wisdom decreed that the existence of this good should be in that which He gives the opportunity to His creations to cling to Him to the degree possible for them. The result is that that which they in and of themselves were unable to achieve, namely His perfection, they will reach, to the degree possible, through their clinging to Him.</p>\n<p>אולם גזרה חכמתו, שלהיות הטוב שלם, ראוי שיהיה הנהנה בו בעל הטוב ההוא; פירוש - מי שיקנה הטוב בעצמו, ולא מי שיתלוה לו הטוב בדרך מקרה. ותראה שזה נקרא קצת התדמות, בשיעור שאפשר, אל שלימותו יתברך. כי הנה הוא יתברך שמו שלם בעצמו, ולא במקרה, אלא מצד אמיתת עניינו מוכרח בו השלימות, ומשוללים ממנו החסרונות בהכרח.</p>\n<p>However, in order that the good be complete, it is fitting that the beneficiary should be the master of that good, meaning, he should be one who has acquired it himself, and not one who has it incidentally.  See that this qualifies as a measure of being similar to His perfection, because He is perfect of Himself, and not incidentally, but as a function of His absoluteness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize, we as created beings cannot achieve real perfection like that of Hashem.  However, that very perfection which we cannot achieve is what Hashem wants us to experience.  So by becoming like Him, in a sense, we can attach to His goodness.  Therefore it is necessary that the perfection that we have be acquired through our own efforts, in order that it be similar to His perfection.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Ramchal answers this question himself in his other book, Daas Tevunos, where he says that in order to be the most pleasurable, the 'good' has to be the most God-like. God Himself didn't have His nature given to Him by an external force, but rather it was a natural outgrowth of his existence. Therefore, a good that is given to a person by an external force would remain external to that person, and not be as full of a good as possible unless the good comes as a natural consequence of that person's efforts</p>\n\n<p>(Caveat: I don't really understand this myself, I'm just paraphrasing as best as I can)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/avot/11-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avot D'Rav Natan 11:1</a> provides on explanation of the purpose of work:</p>\n\n<p>אהוב את המלאכה כיצד</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>?</p>\n  \n  <p>מלמד שיהא אדם אוהב את המלאכה ואל אדם יהי שונא את המלאכה. כשם שהתורה\n  נתנה בברית, כך המלאכה נתנה בברית, שנאמר: (שמות כ) \"ששת ימים תעבוד\n  ועשית כל מלאכתך, ויום השביעי שבת לה' אלהיך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"How does one love work? This teaches us that man should love work and\n  not hate work. In the same way that the Torah was given to us by a\n  covenant, work was given to us by a covenant, as it says (Shmot 20): 6\n  days shall you work and complete all your creative work, and the 7th\n  day is Shabbat to your G-d\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a sense, work is a \"covenant\" between G-d and us. When we accepted the covenenat of the Torah, we accepted the covenant of doing work, as well. (According to this explanation.)</p>\n\n<p>I realize that this verse doesn't DIRECTLY answer your question. But, it provides an aspect of undrestanding why G-d asks us to work vs. being idle, which is part of what you asked in the 2nd paragraph of your question.</p>\n\n\n",

Don't be disappointed though- he covers a period wide enough that there's very little in depth analysis or discussion, and the book is meant as more of an introduction (I think), nor does he really discuss the question of semikha vs. minuy shoftim or the like. </p>\n\n<p>Even though you said that you've seen articles on the topic, the best is probably Lawrence Hoffman's article, \"The Origin of Ordination\" which was published in \"Rabbinic Authority: Papers Presented Before the Ninety-First Annual Convention of the Central Conference of American Rabbis\".  </p>\n\n<p>If you'd really like to do an in-depth study, and you still don't want anything in Hebrew, then the next best option is to look at articles that discuss particular changes, innovations and developments that occurred throughout history regarding semicha, such as the forms of semikha mentioned in the beginning of Maseches Sanhedrin, how the Geonim viewed their 'heter horaa', the controversy surrounding R. Yaakov Berav, and the Rabbinate as viewed by their own members in every time and place from 12th century North Africa to 20th century England and everywhere in between. What the word 'semikha' even means has varied over the many times and places, with the most major difference noted in the comments (that today 'semikha' refers to a heter horaa but that there's a whole separate form of semicha required for certain halakhic rituals and decisions)</p>\n\n\n",

The first half of the prayer seems to be thanking Hashem for making us uniquely believers in Him, in other words, we are happy that we are the only ones who serve him. This seems like a step further than merely thanking Hashem for singling us out to give us the Torah or the like, because we seem to be happy about the fact that other nations continue to worship idols. </p>\n\n<p>Not only does such an interpretation fly in the face of most people's intuition that we really do want the other nations to also believe in Hashem, but it contradicts the next paragraph of the very same prayer: we hope for the day when all nations will bow to Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>Are we happy about the fact that other nations worship (or worshiped) idols, which is what give us our uniqueness?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Actually, the first paragraph of Aleinu, can be viewed as an explanation or \"list\" that expounds on the first sentence:</p>\n\n<p>\"It is our obligation to praise the Master of all...\" (Why???):\n... \"That he did not make us like the nations of the earth...\"</p>\n\n<p>This is not any insult to the other nations by any means. I am thanking G-d for making me DIFFERENT than other nations, by giving me (Jews) the task of performing mitzvot. THAT is the focus of the thanks. G-d chose Jews to carry the responsibility and task of observing mitzvot. There is nothing implied that this makes us superior to other nations, in any way. By analogy, it's like thanking your boss for giving you a project rather than to someone else. That doesn't necessarily imply that the other person was inferior or unworthy. Perhaps, your co-worker got a different project that may be MORE \"important\". </p>\n\n<p>Likewise, it is not that we are \"happy\" that \"they bow down to idols...\" That sentence is a further explanation of why we are thankful that G-d didn't place us like the other nations. The REASON G-d didn't place us with their \"share\" is BECAUSE ... \"they bow down...\" </p>\n\n<p>FYI - See the Art Scroll (among other places) that explain why many places have eliminated that last phrase. Historically, it was eliminated for a while b/c non-Jews thought that this was insulting to them - a claim similar to yours - and Jews were trying to prevent pogroms or other violence that might have happened b/c of this misunderstanding. Too bad that Jews at that time didn't have the means or opportunity to explain it to them similar to what I am doing. I doubt even that would have mattered, though.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The simple answer is that you're reading the prayer wrong: we aren't saying that we're happy that no other nations serve Hashem, but we're merely happy that at least we get to, for without the Torah, we too would be bowing to emptiness and nothing</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Gematria accepted by all?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is widely accepted that each letter of the Hebrew alphabet has a Gematria (numerical value) attached to it. These numerical values often provide insight when comparing one Gematria to either another Gematria, or a significant number in Judaism. We possibly even learn out <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11553/halachot-learned-from-gematria\">Halacha</a> from gematria.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any authorities that reject the existence of this numerical value system, <strong>and/or</strong> the meaning and insights that they provide? I am looking for Rishonim preferably, or Achronim. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra appears to reject gematria as a means of discovering meaning. In response to Rashi's equating the 318 men with Eliezer (see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8209#showrashi=true&v=14\">Genesis 14:14</a>), he <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&mefaresh=ezra&perek=14\">writes</a>:</p>\n\n<p>\" חניכיו -\nשחנכם פעמים רבות במלחמה ואם לא נזכר.\nוחשבון אותיות אליעזר דרך דרש, כי אין הכתוב מדבר בגימטריא, כי יכול יוכל הרוצה להוציא כל שם לטוב ולרע, רק השם כמשמעו.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"and the count of the letters Eliezer is by way of derash, for the Scriptures does not speak in gematria, for anyone who wishes is able to cast any name for good or for bad. Rather the name is as its simple implication.\"</p>\n\n<p>As I discuss in <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2009/11/did-eliezer-or-318-men-accompany.html\">this post</a>, it seems that he regards this as allegorical, because one can twist gematria any which way one chooses. To emphasize the point, note that when Ibn Ezra says that a midrash is דרך דרש, he does not mean that it is a historical fact which happens to be a midrash. It is obvious that this is a midrash, which comes from a midrashic source and employs midrashic methods. Rather, he is saying that there is a homiletic point, a \"drush\", which Chazal wish to convey, and they use the midrash as a way of clothing that point. So the midrash is not historical, nor is it a way of extracting any intended meaning from the text. </p>\n\n<p>Also, here is another instance in which Ibn Ezra is silent in the face of gematria. This is interpretable in different ways, but see his comment on <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=32&perek=2&mefaresh=ezra\">Rut 2</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[ב, יז]\n  ויהי כאיפה שעורים. פעם אחת שאלני אדם, מה טעם באיפה שעורים. אמרתי לו, אין טעם לשאלה הזאת, כי הכתוב ספר מה היה. אז נקלותי בעיניו, ויאמר לי כי יש לו טעם, ואני החרשתי ממנו ולא שאלתיו. \n  והנה בא ביום אחד ואמר לי, כי יש לו טעמים הרבה. \n  האחד שראתה רות בדרך נבואה כי עתיד היה אחד מבניה להעמיד עמוד על שם בעלה, וטעם 'איפה' - צ\"ו רמונים שהיו על העמוד, וזה בגימטריא 'איפה', ופירוש 'שעורים' כמו 'שיעורים' כמו 'שער בנפשו'. \n  וטעם אחר, 'ויהי' - שתי מלות, ארמית ועברית. והיא כאשר ראתה שיתלה אבשלום שהוא מבניה, והנה כ\"ף עם אל\"ף רמז לשנות אבשלום במותו. ואחר כך 'איפה שערים' - לשון רבים, בעבור היותו כבד עליו.\n  וטעם אחר, כי תחילת אות כאיפה עם תחילת שעורים הוא בגמטריא 'ישי' שהוא צדיק גמור. \n  אז שמח וישב לבו בקרבו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_of_Modena\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

He holds that after 50% dilution any more means that it is not wine at all and that is why the bracha rishona is Shehakol and the bracha acharona is boreh nefashos no matter how much wine would have been in the mixture if you extracted it.</p>\n\n<p>After shacharis he spoke of the halachos of solid food (such as cereals) and kugels as to when they become shehakol from having been ground up. The SA and Mishna Brurah state that once the bracha becomes shehakol (such as corn chips or many cereals) then the bracha acharona changes also. He added that the halacha with rice and wheat (mezonos) is different as far as the bracha rishona changing is concered. However, that is not involved in the question. I just mentioned it to point out that the bracha acharona follows the status of the bracha rishona for more than just the wine mentioned in the question.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore Moshe told them to eat it, as שומר מצוה לא ידע דבר רע, one keeping a Mitzvah will not know evil [from the keeping of the Mitzvah].

Suppose it would either not be possible for him to arrive early enough to daven the whole davening in time for shmoneh esrei with the group or extremely inconvenient (such as a very early pre-work minyan). Would it be preferable for him to stay home and daven on his own while saying all of psukei d'zimra with focus and attention, or is it better for him to rush, not saying all of it, but saying shmoneh esrei with a minyan?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/03-14-05/#_te02ftn14_9\">My Rav</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Say Elokai Neshama, Bircat HaTorah, and Bircat HaShachar</li>\n<li>Say Baruch She'Amar, Ashrei, and Yishtabach</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you can put on tallit and tefillin, and say just the above passages, in the time that it takes the rest of the minyan to say all of Psukei D'Zimra, then it's better to do so, in order to pray with a minyan.  </p>\n\n<p>This is assuming that the person is able to keep up with the minyan for shema and shemoneh esreh itself.</p>\n\n<p>If not, (quote from above link)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If one notices that he does not have time to say these berachot [bircat hatorah, elokai, bircat hashachar] and Ashrei and still succeed in praying with the minyan, he should pray individually without omitting anything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=158\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siman 52 in Shulchan Aruch</a> is all about the Halachos of which parts of Pesukei D'zimra to skip if one comes late to shul. From the first Mishna Berura there it is apparent that the motivation for skipping parts of Pesukei D'zimra is in deference to the value of davening Shmone Esrei together with the rest of the congregation. Being that that is the case, I would extrapolate that in your case you should be skipping some of your Pesukei D'zimra as well in order to insure that you daven Shmoneh Esrei with the tzibbur. Tefila betzibbur is important enough to require one who is in shul to skip parts of davening in order to make it, I don't think that it would give any preference to staying home in order to say all of Pesukei D'zimra</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You might do what I'm doing today, which is to practice at home with a tape of the service or videos available online.

But for\n  the body, it's primary desire is to the evil inclination, because both\n  are from the side of evil (physicality), and also they are closer to\n  each other. It is because of this that there is a battle between the\n  physicality and the soul. Because since the soul cannot do the mitzvot\n  except through the body, which tends towards the evil inclination,\n  because of this there is a great difficulty to subjugate it (the evil\n  inclination).</p>\n  \n  <p>We have clarified that the soul has the power of choosing to follow\n  the good inclination, but since it needs the actions of the body, it\n  has great exertion in subjugating the evil inclination.

    "content": "# Why does the Cave of Machpelah have special significance?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Avraham spends considerable money and effort to acquire the cave of machpelah. I think the medrash mentions that Adam and Chava were buried there. My question is,  is the Cave of Machpelah special because of the people who were buried there, or was that area special and therefore the Avot and Imahot wanted to be buried there? If the Cave of Machpelah has some sort of significance apart from the people who are buried there, what is it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The source of the name Maaras Hamachpeila could shed some light on this question. - According to one opinion in Eiruvin 53a, either Rav or Shmuel (the Gemara doesn't say which one said it) says the cave is named because it is \"doubled with couples\" i.e. there are many couples there.  This would seem to imply that its main significance is who is buried there. (The other opinion says that it was named for its multiple levels.)</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Yalkut Reuveini brings from the Zohar on Chayei Sarah that this cave is the entranceway through which souls enter Gan Eden.  This is why, the Zohar says, Adam chose to bury Chava there, and may very well be why Avraham wanted to bury Sarah there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>After <a href=\"http://rabbishimon.com/tzadikim/showz.php?p=azulai.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rav Avrohom Azulai</a> (1570-1643) in his sefer <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44570&st=&pgnum=140&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chesed L'Avrohom</a> explains that the lower Garden of Eden is entered by way of the Garden, and that both the Garden and Gehinom - the dwelling place of harmful creatures and angels of destruction - are located on the north side of this lowly world, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Because it is difficult for both the living and the dead to go to the Garden of Eden because of the fear of the harmful creatures of Gehinom who are located on the north side of the world, Hashem’s wisdom decreed the making of an underground tunnel from the Cave of Machpelah which is in Chevron to a place outside of this lowly world next to the Garden, in order that the souls of the tzaddikim can go there directly without encountering any harmful creatures.</p>\n  \n  <p>Adam and Chavah (Eve) knew this secret and therefore they endeavored to be buried there, and after they were buried there the mouth of the cave was sealed so that no one would\n  know about the specialness of the place.</p>\n  \n  <p>But on the day that Avrohom went with his son Yishmael to take three bulls from his herd, the angel Refael, on a mission from Hashem, secretly followed him, and after Avrohom took two bulls and gave them to the lad to take home, Refael appeared before him in the guise of a very superior looking bull (this is alluded to by the name פר אל - רפאל\n  - an superior bull), and thus this was the third bull that Avrhom planned to take. But when Avrohom tried to take it, the bull evaded him and ran a little way off.</p>\n  \n  <p>This process repeated itself until it brought him to the entrance of the Cave of Machpelah and the entrance of the cave opened. When he saw Adam and Chavah buried there and smelled the fragrance of the Garden of Eden, he immediately understood the specialness of the place and desired that his burial should be there.</p>\n  \n  <p>The bull now delivered himself into the hands of Avrohom, but when he reached his tent he only found two bulls, and so Avrohom had to create a third bull using the Sefer Yetzirah\n  in order not to cause distress to his guests, because if he returned to the herd to take a third bull the time when it is fitting to eat would have passed. This is what the posuk in Bereishis 18:8 means “and he took…the young bull which he had made” - which he had actually made.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Full text in English can be found <a href=\"http://www.shlomokluger.com/Other-Books/Various-Commentaries/Chesed-L'Avrohom-Chapter-5.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Since most of the eastern Ashkenazi siddurim I've seen have both of these portions, as well as gemara excerpts before Zevachim 5, I have wondered when they were added. Is there any documentation, such as old siddurim or writings of Acharonim, which points to an origin of the usage of these passages in birchot hashachar?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is possible that addition of these sections coincided with familiarity with Sefard siddur among ashkenazim (which Arizal intended as one prayer book for sefardim and ashkenazim). However, the likely origin of these additions is not <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/02-13-06/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kabbalistic</a>. The <em>shacharis</em> service has been a substitute for the <em>tamid shel shachar</em> offering. In part, additions were done due to a desire to have preparation for geula, since many people were expecting the <a href=\"https://www.gefenpublishing.com/product.asp?productid=1026\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">coming of moshiyach in mid to late 1700s</a> due to kabbala calculations. The added details are explained as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Namely, the early morning tying of the <em>tamid</em> offering following morning <em>brachos</em> is done according to mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tamid.4.1?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tamid 4:1</a>: they would bind it by fastening each hind leg to the corresponding foreleg, as explained by RaABaD, ROSh, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tamid.4.1?vhe=Vilna_edition&lang=bi&with=Rambam&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RaMBaM</a>: they would not bind him so that they would not imitate the nations that bind their sacrifices, but they would only hold his hands and feet, and this is what they said, binding hand and foot <strong>like Isaac son of Abraham</strong>: And they would always slaughter him at dawn on the western side of the slaughtering place so that he would face the sun, and always at dusk he would slaughter him on the east side. Hence the connection with <em>Akkeida</em> in the brachos section.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Amida</em> corresponds to the application of blood on the <em>mizbeach</em>, which is considered as the moment of <em>kapara</em> (Zevachim perakim 1 - 4).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Application of blood is followed by lighting of 2 candles on the menora and then burning of <em>ketores</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.33a.2?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Yoma 33a</a>). In fact, Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tamid.5.2?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tamid 5:2</a> describes the lottery for <em>ketores</em>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tamid.5.4?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tamid 5:4</a> describes the first action of the lottery for <em>ketores</em> winner, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tamid.6.3?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tamid 6:3</a> describes burning of <em>ketores</em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Certainly, one can ask, why do we read about ketores in the morning section of korbanos if we could read after the <em>tefila</em>?

    "content": "# Hugging a crying close friend of the opposite sex?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Would hugging or otherwise comforting a close friend of the opposite gender who was visibly upset/crying be a violation of Negiah (prohibition against touching a member of the opposite sex)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, in Igros Moshe Even HaEzer 1:56 did not want to allow shaking hands, even when the other person offers their hand first, as it is likely considered an affectionate act.  Hugging, whatever the reason, seems to be much more of an inherently affectionate act, and would be similarly discouraged.</p>\n\n<p>Even according to those who would permit handshakes, hugging is seemingly worse.  Handshakes may be excluded because they do not, by nature, lead to anything more, whereas hugging customarily can be associated with, and lead up to, sexual relations.  Thus hugging is more inherently an act of physical attraction, as opposed to shaking hands.  This is significant because some (Rabbi Yehuda Henkin, among others) want to allow handshakes on exactly this basis, that handshakes are inherently not a sexual act.  They base themselves on the words of the Rambam, לא תקרבו לדברים המביאין לידי גילוי ערווה - do not do things which lead to illicit relations (rough translation), which they understand to exclude the <em>types</em> of things which do not lead to such. </p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the Rambam's formulation of the prohibition (Hilchos Isurei Biah 21:1) is limited to that which is done as an act of lust:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל הבא על ערווה מן העריות דרך אברים, או שחיבק ונישק דרך תאווה ונהנה בקירוב בשר--הרי זה לוקה מן התורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, it is difficult to assess when an act of physical affection passes that threshold.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It is worth noting first what the Rema writes in Shulchan Aruch Even haEzer 21:5 regarding rules against being served by a woman, etc: \"And there are those who are lenient regarding all of these matters...and there are those who say these rules (against touching) were only in private (yihud) but in a place where many people are found, like a bath-house, it is permissible to be washed by a non-Jewish maidservant, and so is our custom. And there are those who say that any (touching) which is not in an affectionate way (hibah), rather his intention is for Heaven, then it is permissible. Therefore, we are accustomed to be lenient regarding these matters...\"</p>\n\n<p>Many poskim use this comment of the Rema to allow non-affectionate touching. A nice example (noted in the comments by sam) is the Ben Ish Hai, in his book Od Yosef Hai, on parshat Shoftim #22, where he employs this Rema to justify kissing hands of the opposite sex in greeting in a case where the circumstances make it clear that the kissing is merely to show honor and respect and not an indication of affection.</p>\n\n<p>And more specifically, in the sefer Yaskil Avdi (vol 6, Yoreh Deah #25, subsection 6) Rav Hodaya is asked about the practice of clasping hands and blessing someone in mourning. He concludes:  \"...And therefore it appears to my impoverished understanding that there is no concern of (the prohibition of) greeting mourners, nor any concern of inappropriate affection (hibah); just the opposite, in a place where this is the custom, one is obligated to behave this way so that he does not appear as if he were separating from the community of comforters...\"</p>\n\n<p>So we see that comforting someone is certainly not affectionate (hibah) and the Rema lists many reasons to be lenient in different cases of touching (including bathing!) when the touching is not affectionate.</p>\n\n\n",

I will give a summary of what his sources tell us, and then give useful quotes from the book itself.</p>\n\n<p>Synagogue orientation/construction is based on custom, not halakha. As with any customs that develop their origins are often muddled and sometimes blasphemous. In general the design of Ashkenazi synagogues are either based on the church designs of their Christian neighbors, or as a response to their Christian neighbors. The same can be said of Sephardim with their Muslim neighbors.</p>\n\n<p>So while it is true that the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/920174/jewish/Tefilah-and-Birkat-Kohanim-Chapter-Eleven.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam in his Mishneh Torah</a> describes the ideal location for the Bimah being in the Middle of the Synagogue, Yosef Karo (Kesef Mishneh ad loc) comments on this Rambam as follows: \"its positioning in the middle is not obligatory, rather it is contingent on the place and time.\"</p>\n\n<p>So you have large sources on both sides of these arguments. So now let's take a look at some of the sources brought down by Zvi Zohar in Rabbinic Creativity in the Modern Middle East pages 291-292:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In nineteenth century Europe it became common practice in the Reform movement to position the bima at the front of the synagogue hall. In reaction, the Orthodox rabbis, led by the Hatam Sofer (Responsa Hatam Sofer, Orah Hayyim, Responsum 28), ruled that there is an unequivocal obligation to situate the bima only in its traditional place --i.e. in the middle of the synagogue. This reaction reached its height in 1886, when 100 rabbis signed a declaration excommunicating anyone who prayed in a synagogue in which the bima was not located in the center.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems clear from the sources that the Reform movement seems to have permeated into common Ashkenazic practice despite the Orthodox movement's best efforts. Contrast that to the reponse of the former Chief Rabbi of Egypt Rabbi Aharon Raphael ben Shim'on (in his responsa umiTzur Devash 3b) in 1896.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If situating the bima in that place (the center) would impair the beauty of the synagogue, or, if in that location the bima will lack clear light, such that the Torah reader will not be able to read comfortably and will not be able to peruse the letters of the Torah scroll and to verify that the spacing [between the letters of the scroll] is at it should be, then that which is lost is greater than that which is gained....Thus it seems, in my humble opinion, ...that the bima should be set in the place most conducive to the fulfillment of its functions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Zvi Zohar brings ample evidence that Rabbi ben Shim'on knew of the Hatam Sofer's ruling but clearly did not agree with it. Rabbi ben Shim'on's ruling is consonant with the position taken on this issue by one of the greatest Italian rabbis of modern times. Rabbi Yishma'el haCohen (1723-1811) in his book Zera' Emet details his response to a similar question. A synagogue was destroyed in which the \"duchan\" was in the center of the building and now the synagogue was being rebuilt, and the members of the community wanted to put the \"duchan\" somewhere else. Rabbi Yishma'el haCohen ruled in accordance with Karo that there was no obligation and that such a decision \"everything is in accordance with the time and place...and there's nothing more to discuss on the matter.\"</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that Rabbi Ya'akov Shaul Elyashar (1817-1906) who was serving as Rishon le-Tzion at the time ruled against both Rabbi ben-Shimon and Rabbi Yishmael haCohen to side with the Chatam Sofer which was not surprising considering there was a larger amount of Ashkenazi influence in Eretz Yisrael than there was in Egypt.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>R. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/2401/eliezer-eisenberg\">Eliezer Eisenberg</a> has a very nice theory of the traditional stucture of a synagogue <a href=\"http://beisvaad.blogspot.com/2009/02/terumah-mishkan-in-synagogue-hidden-in.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, he argues that the layout of a synagogue is supposed to parallel the structure of the <em>mishkan</em> / <em>beit hamikdash</em>.</p>\n\n<p>With respect to your specific questions: the Ark parallels the <em>kodesh hakodashim</em> / <em>aron hakodesh</em> and is thus placed at the front. The <em>bimah</em> parallels the <em>mizbach ha'olah</em> and is thus placed somewhere between the entrance to the synagogue and the <em>amud</em> of the <em>chazzan</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some more detailed quotes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Bimah is the Mizbach Ha'olah. This has been pointed out by the Chasam Sofer (Teshuvos OC 28) and the Netziv (Meishiv Davar OC 15). (The Chasam Sofer calls it the Mizbei'ach Hapnimi, which sounds like the Mizbach Haketores, but he can't possibly mean that, as Reb Moshe points out in Igros OC II 41.) The reason for the correspondence is the Gemara in Menachos 110a; אמר ריש לקיש מאי דכתיב זאת התורה לעולה למנחה ולחטאת ולאשם כל העוסק בתורה כאילו הקריב עולה מנחה חטאת ואשם-- It is at the Bimah that we read the Torah; Reading the Torah is our equivalent of sacrificial service, our Avodas Hakorbanos. (In OC 660, the Gaon and the Pri Megadim in Mishbetzos Zahav sk1 bring that on Sukkos we are makif the Bimah that has a Sefer Torah on it as a zecher le'mikdash based on Megilla 31b, that reading the Parshios of Korbanos is mechaper like physically bringing korbanos. Why, you may ask, don't they bring the Reish Lakish memra from Menachos which seems to be on eisek Torah in general and not just parshos hakorbanos? I suppose that they are mechalek between 'kor'in' in Megilla and \"oseik' in Menachos. Now, the Gaon/PM are mashma that the ikkar thing to be makif around is the sefer Torah, that the Sefer Torah, not the Bimah, is like the Mizbei'ach. But the Taz in sk 1 says that the Bimah is like the Mizbei'ach \"when it has a sefer Torah on it,\" and there is no reason to say that the Gaon or the PM are saying different than him.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Just as the Mizbeiach was elevated, our Bimah, too, is elevated. The elevation is not just for better acoustics or line of sight, it is minhag Yisrael, to the extent that one is prohibited from taking a shortcut from one side of the shul to the other by way of the Bimah platform, because the platform is considered a different, and more holy, reshus (Mekor Chaim OC 151:5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And, of course, the Aron Hakodesh. The Paroches/Curtain in shul and the niche containing the Sifrei Torah is the Paroches of the Mishkan, behind which reposed the Aron Hakodesh, which contained the Luchos and the Sefer Torah written by Moshe Rabbeinu.  Sometimes people are confused by the fact that in a synagogue, the closet is called the Aron Kodesh, whereas in the Mikdash/Mishkan, the Aron Kodesh refers to the box that contains the tablets/Torah, and the area is called the Kodesh Kadashim.  So in the synagogue, we are conflating the Kodesh Kadashim and the Aron container of the Torah and calling it the Aron Kodesh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there any halachic problem with an ark having a \"lazy susan\" for the Sifrei Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Our shul has a small ark. There is room for 4 Sifrei Torah with 2 on each row.</p>\n\n<p>As a Ba'al Kri'ah / Gabbai, I find it difficult, sometimes, to shuffle Sifrei Torah between the front and back row, esp. when there are different Torah readings in a short time span. Rosh Hashannah and the days following will prove to be a real challenge.</p>\n\n<p>I need 2 for Rosh Hashannah up front. Shabbat afternoon, I need the regular parsha reading; Sunday - a fast day Torah and Monday the weekday parsha again. A lot of juggling around, and usually I am the only one doing it.</p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if it is permissible to install a \"lazy susan\" to hold the Sifrei Torah, so that we can just revolve the platform until the Sefer Torah we need is accessible?</p>\n\n<p>Each Torah has its own \"cage\" or backrest so that they can lean against something. The entire series of cages is nailed down to a large circular platform and the platform rotates. Note, that obviously, because the platform rotates, not all the Sifrei Torah will be facing the same way, and, actually, a few will be facing the back of the ark.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any halachic problem with having Sifrei Torah in the ark facing different directions, or, in this case, since the platform rotates, some of them will be facing the back of the ark.</p>\n\n<p>I know it sounds like a crazy idea, and I've never seen this done anywhere. But, is there any halacha forbidding doing this? It would make things much easier for so many people. I'm sure I'm not the only person with this challenge!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6796\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoreh De'ah Siman 282</a> there is nothing in the halachos of respecting a <em>sefer Torah</em> which dictates what direction the <em>sefer Torah</em> should face when it is in the Aron, as long as it isn't placed on its side or upside down.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Tam (who holds that <em>sifrei Torah</em> should be placed laying down) brings one of his sources from the way in which the <em>sefer Torah</em> and the <em>luchos</em> were lying in the Aron, and <em>perhaps</em> he would similarly say that a <em>sefer Torah</em> should be facing the same direction, but this is pure speculation on my part.</p>\n\n<p>However, one should be very careful whenever making changes to accepted norms, even when they are seemingly innocuous.  In Igros Moshe O.C. 4:40:22, R' Moshe was asked about a possible problem of writing/erasing when closing/opening a two-piece paroches which opened by spreading the two halves to the sides.  R' Moshe responded that the opening and closing was not a problem of writing or erasing, but that ideally such a paroches should not be made because it deviates from the accepted <em>minhag</em> of having a one-piece sheet paroches for the <em>Aron Kodesh</em>. Obviously, there are limitations to these kinds of concerns, but these things should be done with careful consideration.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I would suggest that as long as when you open the ark you cannot see any facing the wrong way it is allowed.\nSo you must put some divider on your 'revolving' platform so that one cannot see the 'back' ones. \nThe front ones are always facing the front so they wont be any problem.\nI hope I have understood the 'system' properly.</p>\n\n\n",

Wouldn't this constitute as a ברכה שאינה צריכה?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>First of all, making a new bracha on desert usually isn't a violation of bracha she'eina tzricha, since most deserts require a bracha anyway, even if eaten after the meal. The pursuing discussion is therefore about foods that would be exempt had they been eaten before the final bracha (bentching). </p>\n\n<p>The Shelah is quoted by the Magen Avraham (215:6) as saying that indeed, one is allowed to make brachos on more foods on Shabbos even if those brachos may be unnecessary because one is obligated to make 100 brachos - thus, the brachos aren't unnecessary because it's otherwise too hard to make the full count. The Magen Avraham himself argues, and he doesn't believe that this is a sufficient reason to permit making unnecessary brachos. Therefore, if these desert foods are already out, he must eat them without a bracha rishona before making a bracha achrona on the meal.</p>\n\n<p>However, indirectly causing a need to make more brachos by not having the foods brought to the table until after bentching is, according to the Machatzis Hashekel (290:1) permitted even according to the Magen Avraham. This is also the opinion of the Maharam Galanti quotes in the Shaarei Teshuvah there. Rabbi Elazar Melamed (Peninei Halakha Klalei Brachos 1:2) explains that the logic here is that even though technically this may be an unnecessary bracha, since it's normal enough to want to finish your meal without desert and not eat desert until later, than for the purposes of this halakha it isn't considered a problem to consider 'ending your meal' early even if your real intention is for the purpose of making more brachos. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.hakhel.info/March12DailyEmail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Situation 85 in this article:</a></p>\n\n<p>When one recites a bracha, he is not only reciting a bracha--he is also performing, at the very least, a Mitzvah D’Rabbanan. Thus, assuming that one is not making a bracha MiD’Oraysa (such as bentsching or perhaps Birchas HaTorah)--if he makes 100 brachos a day, he is also fulfilling 100 Mitzvos D’Rabbanan!</p>\n\n<p>My inference from this quote - Birkat Hamazon is D'oraita, and since you had a s'eudah, you are required to say it, so there's no violation, here. There is also a requirement to say 100 Brachot per day, and the Bracha rishona on the desert is D'Rabbanan. You are making the bracha rishona on the desert for the purpose of another mitzvah, namely, getting to the goal of 100 mitzvoth.</p>\n\n<p>The vague part within this evaluation is - how does the term \"tzricha\" - necessary - apply, here? While there is a mitzvah to say 100 Brachot daily, I don't think it is a requirement to do it.

Eleazar4 b. Pedath, for instance. It was said of K. Eleazar that he sat and studied Torah in the lower market of Sepphoris while his linen cloak lay in the upper market of the town. R. Isaac b. Eleazar related: A man once came to take it and found a venomous serpent in it.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi says:</p>\n\n<p>באהבתה תשגה תמיד. בשביל אהבתה <strong>תעשה</strong> עצמך שוגה ופתי להניח עסקיך ולרוץ לדבר הלכה:</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know what the difference would be betwen what Rashi did say (Ta'aseh) as opposed to if he said \"<em>bishvil ahavasah</em> <strong>assei</strong> <em>atzmecha etc.</em> \"</p>\n\n<p>My motivation for asking this question is: either I will learn something about grammar and/or I will learn something about Rashi's intention by contrasting a similar wording of the same idea with a slight variation. Whether the inference resulting from the variance was part of what Rashi had in mind could end up being debatable (<em>diyuk eino muchrach</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Additionally I do not feel the need to provide why I think any alternative would be better in order to ask this question (contrary to what some people wrote in the comments) since my question is a standard question to be asked on Rashi when applicable. This is clear from the sefer Darchei HaTalmud by Rav Yitzchak Kanpanton (1360–1463) (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Canpanton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> ) who writes \"At the beginning of your inquiry into the Commentators on the Talmud... And after you know the intention of his words and his explanation, be exacting and see what is the opposite <strong>and alternative</strong>... </p>\n\n<p>You can see this paragraph here: <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21689&st=&pgnum=18&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darchei HaTalmud Siman 1</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's in the second-person future form rather than the command form. \"Out of the love of Torah, this is what will happen.\" The distraction is not the end-goal per se (which is what would be if it were phrased as a command), just a consequence of the love of Torah (which is the goal).</p>\n<p>More importantly, Rashi is helping us understand the pasuk. The pasuk uses the second-person future for \"you will go crazy\", so Rashi fills that in for us a bit more.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Assei is an action as referring to the one doing it. Taaseh is passive inflexive of who or what the action was done do. A mitzvas lo saasei means an act which should not be done, it does not mean an act of not doing. When reffering to a person doing something to himself the wording is inconsequential in many cases in English, but in Hebrew refocuses the intent. In English we say a person dressed himself, we don't say he made himself dressed. Sometimes you can say both terms, such as a person got himself ready or a person readied himself. Taaseh atzmicha shogeh upessi refocuses the intent on the subject, to make of yourself a fool and simpleton. Assei atzmicha is reffering to act involved to achieve it.</p>\n\n\n",

For a moment, I thought that a mitzva only referred to mitzvot d'oreita, but there are obviously mitzvot d'rabanan. So, are they synonyms or do they have technical differences in definition?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It seems that the comments, above, explain the meaning of the two words.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the roots - \"Mitzvah\" comes from \"tzavah\" (zvh) meaning \"to command\". The Torah has mitzvot - commandments, because it states \"Do (or don't do) this\". rarely does it explain HOW to do or not do something. (Technically, mitzvot lo ta'aseh are \"easier\" b/c you just don't do what it says not to do. However, it doesn't really work that way, in actuality.... another topic.)</p>\n\n<p>\"Halacha\" comes from \"holech\" (hlc) meaning, \"to walk\" or \"to go\". In other words, halacha is the WAY to do the mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>I can see where the terms may be confused because when the Shulchan Aruch states \"halacha\" in terms of \"you should do this\" it looks like a mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>Also, \"mitzvah\" is sometimes used to mean \"good deed\" as when your teacher says, \"Do you want to do a mitzvah? Please clean the board for me.\"  Of course, there is no mitzvah - commandment that says, \"Thou shalt clean the teacher's blackboard when he asks you.\" There is a mitzvah to honor your teacher. There are halachot explaining HOW to honor your teacher, and, in a sense by helping your teacher, you honor him. But, in the context of this question, the teacher meant, \"good deed\". He probably should have used the term \"chessed\" instead of \"mitzvah\" in this question. Then again, showing \"chessed\" definitely is a mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

במנחות דף מ עמוד ב : ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>טלית שהקטן מתכסה בו ראשו ורובו, והגדול יוצא בו דרך עראי – חייבת בציצית. אין הקטן מתכסה בו ראשו ורובו, אף על פי שהגדול יוצא בה עראי – פטורה. \n  עיין שם. ובוודאי שיש שיעור לקטן זה, דאין סברא לומר לקטן בן שנה או שתים או מעט יותר. ובאמת כתב הרמב''ם ריש פרק שלישי: ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>קטן המתהלך לבדו בשוק ואינו צריך אחר לשומרו. \n  עד כאן לשונו. וגם שיעור זה לא נתברר, דאין לומר דזהו קטן שאינו צריך לאמו דהוא כבן ארבע או חמש כדאמרינן בריש פרק שמיני דעירובין, דאם כן הוה ליה להרמב''ם לומר לשון זה. אלא וודאי דכוונתו לגדול מזה. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>והטור כתב בן תשע שנים, עיין שם. ואולי יצא לו שיעור זה מפני שמצינו בש''ס (יבמות צו ב) דבן תשע ראוי לביאה – הרי שעתה יצא לכלל גדלות קצת. והנימוקי יוסף כתב: קטן המתבייש לצאת לחוץ בלא כסות, עיין שם. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>ונראה לי כיון דהטור פירש השיעור, והמה לא פירשו – קיימא לן כהטור. ואולי גם הם סוברין כן דאלו אם באנו לשער בשיעורם – עדיין לא ידענו כמה. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>הט''ז מביא מפעוטות, וצריך עיון. ודייק ותמצא קל. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>ב</strong> והנה הרמב''ם לא הזכיר כלל הך תנאי דגדול יוצא בו דרך עראי, אלא שהקטן מתכסה בו ראשו ורובו, עיין שם. אבל הטור כתב שיעור טלית להתחייב בציצית: כל שקטן בן תשע שנים יכול לכסות בה ראשו ורובו, וגדול אינו מתבייש בה לצאת באקראי לשוק. אבל אם אין הקטן מתכסה בה ראשו ורובו, אף על פי שגדול יוצא בה באקראי לשוק – פטור. עד כאן לשונו. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>ורבים תפסו שהרמב''ם והטור מחולקים: דהרמב''ם סבירא ליה דדי בתנאי דקטן מתכסה..., והטור סבירא ליה דתרתי בעינן. ועל פי זה כתב רבינו הרמ''א על דברי רבינו הבית יוסף שהם כלשון הרמב''ם. כתב הוא וזה לשונו: ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>ודווקא כשהגדול לובשו פעמים עראי ויוצא בו לשוק. \n  עד כאן לשונו. וגם דקדקו: למה לא שנה התנא האופן השני, אם קטן מתכסה ואין גדול יוצא בו דרך עראי. והאריכו כל אחד לפי דרכו (עיין בית יוסף, וב''ח, ודרישה, וט''ז, ומגן אברהם). וגם חקרו איך הדין כשגדול יוצא בו בקבע ואין הקטן מתכסה בו, והסכימו דחייבת בציצית (ב''ח ומגן אברהם ואליה רבה). ובוודאי כן הוא, דבגד שגדול יוצא בו בקביעות למה יפטור? ‏</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>ג</strong> אמנם לעניות דעתי כל טורח זה בחינם. דהנה זהו וודאי דכל הדינים הם לגדולים, דקטנים לאו בני מצוה נינהו. ולכן הרמב''ם לא הוצרך לפרש רק דבר של קטן שהוא לסימנא, והגדול לא הוצרך להזכיר דסתמא בגדולים מיירינן. והברייתא הכי קאמר: טלית שהקטן מתכסה בו ראשו ורובו – חייבת בציצית. והדבר תמוה: הא התורה אמרה ''אשר תכסה בה''. ולגדולים נאמרה, ופשיטא דבגד שהקטן מתכסה בו ראשו ורובו לא יספיק לגדולים, דאין דרך גדול לצאת בבגד קצר כזה, והיוצא – בטלה דעתו. וזה מתרץ הברייתא: והגדול יוצא בה דרך עראי, כלומר: אף על גב דלקביעות וודאי אינו ראוי, אבל במקרה יוצא בה, והתורה חייבה גם כשיוצא בה דרך עראי. ופסיקא להו לרבנן דכל שהקטן מתכסה בה ראשו ורובו – ראוי לגדול לעראי. אך לפי זה אולי יאמרו דלעראי ראוי אף פחות משיעור זה, לזה אומר דאם אין הקטן מתכסה בה ראשו ורובו, אף על פי שהגדול יוצא בה עראי – פטורה. אבל להיפך אי אפשר לומר, דזהו מן הנמנעות דאם רק קטן מתכסה ראשו ורובו יש לגדול עראי. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>ונמצא דכל עיקר הדין תלוי בהקטן, ולכן לא הזכיר הרמב''ם יותר. והטור העתיק לשון הגמרא ונפרש בו כמו בגמרא. מיהו על כל פנים הרמב''ם והטור לא פליגי כלל. וגם מה שחקרו הגדולים כשגדול יוצא בו בקבע – חקרו בנמנעות לדברינו. ואם אחד עושה כן – בטלה דעתו. </p>\n  \n  <p>(כן נראה לעניות דעתי. ונראה לי שזה דעת רבי יצחק אבוהב שהובא בבית יוסף אלא שקיצר מאוד. ולפי מה שכתבתי אתי שפיר כל מה שהקשו בזה. וכן מה שכתב המגן אברהם סעיף קטן ב', דאם הגדול מתבייש פטור, עיין שם – וזה אינו, דכיון דחכמים שיערו שבשיעור זה יוצא הגדול עראי מי יחלוק בזה? והמתבייש בטלה דעתו, וכל שיעורי חכמים כן הוא.) ‏</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>ד</strong> עוד חקרו הגדולים וצווחו על המנהג שנושאים טליתות קטנים מאוד, ועושין בהן ציצית, והולכין בהם לרשות הרבים בשבת. וצווחו ככרוכיא, וכתבו דלכל הפחות יהיה אורך הטלית אמה וחצי, שלוש רבע אמות מלפניו ושלוש מלאחריו. ואם נחשוב לפי אמות הש''ס, יהיה בשלוש רבע אמה – תשעה ווייערסקעס לפי המידה של מדינתינו רוסיא. ולדבריהם אותם שנושאים קטנים מזה – אינם יוצאים ידי חובת ציצית. כלומר: דזהו כהולך בלא בגד החייב בציצית. ולפי זה אסור לצאת בהם בשבת, דהציצית חשיבי ולא בטלי. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>ולכן תמיהני על מי שכתב דמוטב לילך בו מלילך בלא ציצית כלל (מגן אברהם בשם רמ''א), והרי בשבת הוי כמשוי? וכתבו להזהיר ההמון שלא יעשו כן (ט''ז וב''ח וכו'). ולפחות יהיה שלוש רבע אמה אורך בכל צד, וחצי אמה רוחב. והכתפיים יהיו רחבים, כלומר: שהרי פתוח באמצע, ואם לא יהיו רחבים – מיחזי ככולו פתוח. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>(מה שכתב המגן אברהם דלא ליתי אוירא דהא גיסא... – פשיטא דאין זה ענין לכאן, ורק במחיצות ובמקום הנחשב כסתום אמרינן כן. אך כוונתו כמו שכתבנו, וכן כתב המחצית השקל.) ‏</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>ה</strong> ולעניות דעתי כל חקירה זו בחינם, והעולם מקיימים מצות ציצית בטליתות הקטנים. דכבר בארנו בריש סימן ח מהנימוקי יוסף ומהריטב''א, שיש מהראשונים שאמרו דציצית אינה אלא בבגד שמעטף הראש ורוב הגוף. ולפי זה כל טליתות קטנות שלנו אינם חייבות בציצית. ונדחו דבריהם, ומן התורה כל בגד של ארבע כנפות שנושא על גופו – חייב בציצית, עיין שם. וגם דעת רבינו הבית יוסף כן הוא, כמו שכתבתי שם. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>והא דבעינן עיטוף רוב הגוף – זהו בטלית העליון, שהוא כמו הסודר שבזמן הגמרא, שהיה הילוכם בזה כידוע. ולכן מברכינן עלייהו ''להתעטף בציצית''. ובזה בעינן שיעור מפני שהוא על הבגדים. אבל טלית קטן שתחת הבגדים אינה צריכה שיעור כלל, דאם רק יש בו ארבע כנפות – חייב בציצית. וכן מבואר להדיא מדברי הריטב''א והנימוקי יוסף שהבאנו בשם בסעיף ד, עיין שם. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(It may have been written by someone from OU.)

Maybe that is what iscausing the question. Depending on which side the buttons are placed many people regard the shirt made for a man or a woman and some women's shirts also include,the side pleats. It makes for a modest and classic styled shirt when the collar is buttoned to the top and the sleeve's cuffs are buttoned at the wrist.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>women may not wear men's clothing. this question is assuming a particular shirt is women's clothing. If it were to be women's clothing then women could wear it but since the question is based on a false premise then these shirts would stay remain male clothing and no women may not wear them.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Bishul Yisroel requirements following the food item rather than its preparation\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When I was in Yeshiva, it was often quoted that \"some opinions\" require Bishul Yisroel on any food item that has a form that is served \"Al Shulchan Malachim\". So, for example, potatoes would always require Bishul Yisroel even in the form of potato chips because some form of potatoes are prepared for state dinners and the like.</p>\n\n<p>A while ago I was talking to a serious Talmid Chocham about some Kashrus issues, and that opinion came up and he started saying \"That opinion ...\" and caught himself. I assume he didn't want to denigrate it (this is my personal projection onto the conversation), but didn't hold by it. (His personal practice was to buy only Bishul Yisroel potato chips in a neighborhood where they are readily available and even cheaper than the other kinds, but when traveling he didn't worry about it).</p>\n\n<p>Who's opinion is it that has that stringency of following the food item instead of the specific way it is being made?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In Igros Moshe yoreh deah 4 siman 48 ois 5 he says potato chips should be bishul yisroel, because it is not so clear that they don't need to be. He also adds that \"it is like many foods made in factories that people say reasons to be lenient and most people are lenient and with this issur dirabanan one cannot chastise the people who are lenient.\"  </p>\n\n<p>The explanation supposedly given by word of mouth is that the food item (ingredient; in this case, the potatoes) are oleh al shulchan milachim. This is what I've heard from various rebbeim/poskim of mine. Two of whom had ongoing relationships and opportunities to talk to reb Moshe. I can't name names being that I don't recall anyone ever saying explicitly 'I heard this exact idea from Reb Moshe'.</p>\n\n<p>Also see Pri Migadim in his Mishbitzos Zahav on siman 112 ois 3. His opening line at face value seems to indicate that a food which if spiced and prepared properly would in fact be olah al shulchan milachim than it is in fact subject to laws of bishul akum. </p>\n\n\n",

Today their numbers are relatively small.  Wikipedia gives a worldwide estimate of about 45,000 people, but the source of their numbers is not given. Karaite Judaism is probably the closest analogue to the <em>Sola Scriptura</em> movement that you mention in Christianity.</p>\n\n<p>There have of course been other movements through history that have declared themselves to not be bound by at least certain aspects of rabbinic law. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Christianity\">Pauline Christianity</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_judaism\">Reform Judaism</a> are two of the more famous religious movements that did so.

He also says that their difference from each other as well as the point that they were actually the first place that Avrohom built an altar could account for this. </p>\n\n<p>Note that as described, one mountain is lush and green and the other is completely bald and desolate. Thus, they signify the blessings and the curses. The kohanim in the middle would turn to Har Grizim and say a blessing and the people would answer amen. They would turn to Har Eival and say a curse and the people would say amen.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shimshon Rafael Hirsch in R'ei (11:29) points out that they are in the Ephraim range of mountains. Har Gerizim, to the south of the valley of Shechem is a \"smiling green slope rising in fruit covered terraces to its summit.\"  Har Eival, on the other hand, is on the north side and is \"steep, bare, and bleak.\"</p>\n\n<p>Also, there is the significance of their being farther west than just at the Jordan. Since they were near Shechem, Bnei Yisrael would have had to travel farther than where they crossed the Jordan to get there. However, the pasuk implies that they were to deliver the blessings and the curses (at the mountains) as soon as they crossed the river.</p>\n\n<p>According to Rav Yehuda in Sota 33b, they were at the actual location near Shechem and Bnei Yisrael had to travel farther west in order to get there. According to Rav Elazar they actually had to build two mounds at the crossing point to symbolize the two mountains. In either case, he is pointing out that the blessings and the curses and the mountains involved are unusual and would require extraordinary actions on the part of Bnei Yisrael.</p>\n\n\n",

However, if one uses separate grates, can one eat the vegetables with dairy?</p>\n\n<p>4- Is there a way of kashering a grill to the point where even the grates do not need to be replaced? For example, could one conceivably leave the grill on for a while, and then immediately use the grill for dairy/fish/food expected to be eaten with dairy?</p>\n\n<p>5- Reverse the questions.

    "title": "When something is lost, tie a knot",
    "content": "# When something is lost, tie a knot\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have a question regarding a possibly Jewish tradition that I learned from my mother. My mother is from Iraq; back in the 70's Jews used to inhabit Iraq, and she said that this is who she learned it from. I suppose they still do since there is but 7 left. </p>\n\n<p>So whenever I lose something, my mom tells me to tie a knot from a towel, paper towel, maybe it doesn't matter, maybe it does. You fold the towel diagonally, and then you fold the outside tip to the crease, and then continue folding likewise until you get some type of thing that looks like a string. From that, you make a knot. She heard that this ties up the testicles of Satan, causing him pain and he'll concentrate on the pain rather than making trouble in your life, or something to that effect.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering where does this belief come from? Is it specific to Iraqi Jews? Does anyone else know about it? My mom said that there are some people in Iraq who know this that are not Jewish, but they learned it from the Jews as well. I recalled my mother saying a specific word for this type of \"fix\" if you will. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Another part to the belief was that as soon as the item that was lost is found, you must untie the knot, because (again, I'm not quite sure if I heard this correctly, or even if my mother remembers it correctly) the demon may cry out loud, and cause another demon to show up to break the charm. So then it was bad luck to keep the knot going.</p>\n\n<p>As to it solely concerning Eastern Jews (I assume it's meant Jews in the Middle East), I think that some of the family married into the European side of Jewry, since the family (who we still keep in contact today) has 40 and 50 year old relatives with both their last name (it's Arabic sounding) and the last name common among European Jews. However, I do not claim that I know that for a fact. It could have very well been that there were Jews in Iraq with European sounding names. </p>\n\n<p>Another Edit: \nI think I may have found something. Initially, I ignored this source because it said \"Jewish Magic\", as it could prove to be written by an anti-Semitic person as it was printed before the Holocaust, but according to the book <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/jms/jms11.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Jewish Magic and Superstition</em>, on page 127</a>, it states that this type of \"segulah\" is a sort of binding (which I weakly referred to as it \"ties the testicles of Satan\" and \"prevents him from doing harm\"), and it also lists the Talmud as a source and goes as far as to say the Islamic prophet Muhammad was bewitched by this type of binding.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The practice of tying a knot to find a lost object is found <a href=\"http://witchatchurch.blogspot.co.il/2010/05/little-knot-magic-for-lost-things.html\">in wiccan practice</a> , and may have <a href=\"http://okieshadow.homestead.com/Spells/index8.html\">originated in ancient Greek culture</a></p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, even if these foreign practice somehow snuck into Jewish forklore, doing 'spells' , or 'charms' , or anything of the sort, is inconsistent with the Torah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When you have come to the land the Lord, your G-d, is giving you, you shall not learn to do like the abominations of those nations.

Watch on this commandment and remember other commandments, what is it?  Kriat Shema as says the Mishna regarding morning kiriat shema: \"from the time in which you can distinguish between white and blue wool yarns. An other Berayta taught... What is it?  mixture of wool and flax,  because the next verse after shaatnez addresses tsitsit. {I want just remember that tsitsit are a kind of knots on garments} </p>\n\n<p>Afterward RAYM quoted a Midrash Rabba addressing explicitly knots (Bereshit Rabba paragraph  90) The Sar Hamashkim did not remember Yosef. ...  <strong>he was tying knots and an angel was unraveling them</strong>...  to tie knots is an example of the mnemonics based on linking the memorization to sensory. </p>\n\n<p>So,  the function of the knots is rather to avoid oversight. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Some people I suppose do this in Jamaica. My grandma always does it and she tells my mom to do it. She tells me and my mom reminds me to do she says because grandma said to do it. So it's known elsewhere.

In this particular case, the only remaining (undivided) inheritence was the shares in the \"family burial plot\". Avraham bought the entire cave (2 graves used, 6 graves available). Yitzchak was the only heir so he got the entire cave (4 graves used, four available). When he died (6 graves used 2 available), Esav claimed that one grave was to go to him and one to Yaakov.

Meanwhile, Chushim son of Dan who was deaf and did not know what the delay was, found out and became so upset he killed Esav. This fulfilled Rivkah's statement \"lose both of you on the same day\". They then went ahead and buried Yaakov in the last available grave.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn't so much that Esav wanted to be buried there as he wanted to deny part of the inheritence to Yaakov.

It would just be more difficult, as his mindset would be working against him. </p>\n\n<p>And before I get to the main part of my answer, I'll head off comments by saying, no, I do not know where the sources for these statements are off the top of my head, so if anyone else does, I will gladly edit them in:</p>\n\n<p>To the best of my knowledge, the Gemara and Midrashim are filled with cases of people who did Teshuva after living what some would consider the worst of lives. Even one of the greatest Amoraim, Reish Lakish, originally was a reformed bandit.</p>\n\n<p>I believe there is only one case in the Gemara where someone was told (via a Bas Kol - Heavenly Voice) that 'everyone could do Teshuva except for Acher'. Even in that case, it seemed like the Tanaim themselves might have disagreed with the Bas Kol, as Rabbi Meir (a student of Acher) implied that Acher could still do Teshuva. (One explanation for the Bas Kol that I remember hearing, again I don't remember the source, is not that Acher couldn't do Teshuva, just that he wouldn't be given Siyata DiShemaya - Divine Assistance)</p>\n\n<p>As to your comment in the beginning of your question about not being forgiven for the 3 cardinal sins, do you have a source for that? As Yishai also commented, I don't believe they are unforgivable. While one might still be obligated in a punishment on this Earth, which might in itself be the Teshuva, G-D has His own 'accounting', where a person could be forgiven.</p>\n\n\n",

Young people are easily influenced by their sports heroes and so many European youth are exposed to their favorite stars wearing \"Fly Emirates\" kits (aka uniforms.) Arsenal fans (my favorite team) are not only exposed to the Fly Emirates kit, they also watch the team play at Emirates Stadium in North London!</p>\n\n<p>Several articles I have read suggest that these acquisitions and sponsorships are an attempt to create a positive attitude towards Arabs and Muslims. My question is, are there any halakhic reasons why an Israeli (especially a Jewish owned) corporation could not sponsor a European team? (The teams play on Shabbat, etc.) El Al, Bank Leumi, Ahava and Sabra are several companies that come to mind. My ulterior motive would be the same as above; that by doing so, it could  shed Israel in a positive light. Israel, after all, does not have the best PR.

How far does this go?  Do I have to exercise daily?  Do I need to be in peak physical condition?  Am I required to stay current on nutrition news to follow the healthiest eating and living habits?  In short, how far do I have to go?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your question can be broken up into two parts (at least)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What physical state of health is one required to maintain?</li>\n<li>How much time/effort needs to be invested in this endeavour?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I will try to answer part 2 & maybe after that we won't need to answer part 1.</p>\n\n<p>I want to start with a small introduction:</p>\n\n<p>It is a basic tenet of Judaism that everything which happens is all a direct result of G-d willing it to happen. It follows that when we, say, go to work to provide for our families it is not really our effort that brings about the results, rather the will of G-d, we are only \"going through the motions\". This raises the following question: If we aren't really accomplishing anything with our act & efforts, why do them at all? The short answer is simply that G-d desires that the world run in a specific manner where it seems as if we are an active force but in reality we are not at all. </p>\n\n<p>Based on this, it is accepted that the more one internalizes this concept, that everything, no matter what, is in the hands of G-d, the less effort he actually has to put in to achieve the same end result.</p>\n\n<p>This means that every individual has a different minimum required effort which he or she is commanded to do. This applies to many aspects of life, though the commandment  most often discussed is the obligation of a man to support his family, however the rule should hold true over here as well. For one person it may be doing exercise for 20 minutes a day, while at the same time his friend is required to do double that & go an intense diet.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, I believe there is no clear-cut one-size-fits-all answer, rather every individual needs to seek guidance from their LOR, to see how much effort is required of them to properly fulfill the commandment of staying healthy. I will leave it to the community to decide if I answered part 1.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are three mitzvos related to this, as enumerated by Rambam in Hilchos Rotzeach Chapter 11 and Shulchan Aruch C.M. 427.</p>\n\n<p>1) ועשית מעקה לגגך</p>\n\n<p>2) לא תשים דמים בביתך</p>\n\n<p>3) השמר לך ושמור נפשך</p>\n\n<p>(Note that ונשמרתם מאד לנפשותיכם is not even mentioned; see Maharsha Berachos 32b and Minchas Chinuch # 546 which point out that the pasuk of ונשמרתם has nothing to do with physical health. Although, the same argument should apply to the pasuk of השמר as well.)</p>\n\n<p>These three commandments all relate to avoiding/preventing danger. The first one is a mitzvas aseh to protect against dangerous situations; the second one is a mitzvas lo sa'aseh to not keep dangerous things in your house; and the third one is a mitzvas aseh to remove and avoid things that present a danger.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Rabbis added a whole list of things that are prohibited because they are dangerous (also enumerated in Chapter 11).</p>\n\n<p>However, this entire discussion is about avoiding specific dangers. It does not say that there is also a general mitzvah to be healthy, and there can be many unhealthy things that do not fall under the category of \"directly life-threatening\".</p>\n\n<p>It would thus appear that you do not have to do anything, as long as you stay away from life-threatening dangers. (While it is possible that there are other sources about being healthy, your question was based on the Shulchan Aruch here which is only discussing dangers.)</p>\n\n\n",

See the last mishna in chapter 23 of maseches shabbos, page 151b in shas, it mentions closing the eyes of a dead person, which we can't do on shabbos. The gemara there discusses that closing a person's eyes prematurely is murder, and if someone WANTS to close a dead man's eyes there is a proper procedure so as not to accidentally kill him while he is still a goseis. </p>\n\n<p>The mipharshei mishnayos quote an Aruch who simply says 'the closing of the eyes is so they won't be open, as is written and Yosef will place his hands on your eyes, parshas vayigash ch 46 vs 4.'</p>\n\n<p>If you look in the Ibn Ezra on that passuk he simply says 'he will place his hands on your eyes, when you die, thats the practice of the living with the dead'. \nIn any event, the practice is apparently very old.</p>\n\n\n",

One of the main funeral homes in his neighborhood had a special room for <em>kohanim</em> that was <em>tum-a</em>-isolated from the main funeral room, but visible in both directions via large windows and audible in both directions via microphones and speakers (similar to the small triangular building in <a href=\"http://connectingdirectors.com/articles/3259-wow-check-out-this-funeral-home\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this funeral home in Chicago</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, and with less requirement for accommodating infrastructure, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/6591/user6591\">user6591</a> reported in a comment knowing a kohen rabbi who would give eulogies from outside the cemetery gates.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://spartacus-educational.com/Jjoad.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor Joad</a> would have said \"It depends what you mean by Rabbi\".</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipeida</a> uses the traditional meaning of Rabbi as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a teacher of Torah.

    "content": "# How does the Conservative Movement address issues with women leading davening?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Conservative movement started to allow women to count in a minyan in 1973 without publishing a halachic justification. In 2002, Rabbi David Fine <a href=\"http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">published a teshuva on the issues of women counting in minyanim and serving as שליחות ציבור</a> to explain the ruling. In examining the teshuva, I had a hard time understanding a few of the parts of the logic, and I was wondering how those issues are explained by the Conservative movement.</p>\n\n<p>1) In footnote #1, the author states that he did not consider קול אשה to be a \"significant objection\". Why not?</p>\n\n<p>2) The whole argument rests on the idea that women can obligate themselves in a mitzvah. But doesn't everybody agree that women have at least a derabanan obligation for tefila? It seems to me that accepting the obligation upon themselves would not effect an obligation any higher than the level of a neder, even if such an acceptance is possible. So is the point that women can take upon themselves an obligation on a Torah-level even though it was not originally commanded to them on a Torah level? If this is not the case, why would women be able to be motzi men in davening if their level of obligation is still lower than that of men?</p>\n\n<p>3) Related to (2), Rabbi Fine bases his argument that women can accept mitzvot upon themselves on the Magen Avraham saying that women have taken the mitzvah of counting the Omer upon themselves. But how does he interpret that to show that women have a greater-than-neder-level of responsibility for counting Omer, or that women can be motzi men in the counting of the Omer? This seems to be a necessary logical step for his argument to work.</p>\n\n<p>4) One issue that Rabbi Fine addresses is the argument that most Conservative women have, in practice, clearly <em>not</em> accepted the obligation of tefila, considering the vast majority of them do not daven thrice daily. His rebuttal is that Conservative women have, as a class, accepted that they have an <em>obligation</em> to daven three times a day, but that they simply fail to live up to that obligation and commit a sin every time they do not daven. </p>\n\n<p>I have a very hard time with point (4) in particular. It seems to me that he is instituting a chumra (women must daven three times a day) that the majority of people do not follow, causing them to sin. That is definitely something that at least the modern poskim have gone to great lengths to avoid doing. This makes it seem like the author jumped through many hoops to arrive at a pre-determined conclusion, which is something that the Conservative movement claims not to do.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Kol Isha -- presumably, the gemara in Megilla says that theoretically a woman could receive an aliyah. In those times, receiving an aliyah meant reading the Torah as well. Hence many rabbis (including some Orthodox ones) would say that <em>kol isha</em> wouldn't be a problem reading the Torah, and if that kind of singing isn't provocative, one could argue that leading the davening isn't either. (Again, there's singing, and then there's singing. There's chanting, and then there's chanting ... but there is a theoretical source on the books here.)</p>\n\n<p>\"Everyone is obligated\" -- good question. Until recently, if I understand correctly, a woman could only be ordained by JTS as a Conservative rabbi if she took an oath to say the full prayers thrice daily (whereas her default obligation was to do <em>some prayer</em> each day), known as the \"Roth neder.\" The argument was that she's now obligated, so she can help others fulfil their obligations. This logic ignored the distinction between those obligated <em>per se</em> in the rabbinic obligation to pray the specified prayers, versus those obligated by force of a vow.</p>\n\n<p>As for the concept of extending obligation and then ignoring it -- well I'd say the approach of the responsum is more \"how can we enable\" instead of \"how were we obligated.\" (And conveniently ignoring Rambam's point that before enacting any new law, a Sanhedrin must seriously consider whether most people will be able to uphold it.)</p>\n\n\n",

The declaration is made in front of hashem and the cohen because this is the individual making an offering to hashem and making a public declaration of his attachment to hashem along with it.</p>\n\n<p>The second (very well known) answer is the midrashic one that originates in the Mechilta. The Mechilta interprets this entire section midrashically (as I suppose one would expect from a midrashic source) and interprets this line as meaning \"An Aramean tried to destroy my father\", referring to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_(Bible)\">Laban</a>. The instructions for the Pesach seder in the Mishnah (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Pesachim.10.4\">Pesachim 10:4</a>) says to drash from the line \"Arami Oved Avi\" until the end of the section. Ultimately the drash from the Mechilta became the commonly used text for this exercise, and since it's printed in the haggadah it has become extremely well known.</p>\n\n<p>In case you're curious what some of the meforshim say, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rashbam_on_Deuteronomy.26.5.1\">Rashbam</a> says the Aramean was Abraham, and <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Deuteronomy.26.5.1\">Seforno</a> says the Aramean was Yaakov. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Deuteronomy.26.5.2\">Rashi quotes</a> the midrashic interpretation and says the Aramean was Laban. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The standard Jewish interpretation of the verse that most everyone will know, as that is what Rashi says, and that is what the Passover Haggadah does with the verse, is that the Aramean is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_(Bible)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lavan</a>, who sought to destroy my father (Jacob).</p>\n\n<p>A detour first about the root word here. אבד - means lost or destroyed. \"Wandering\" is fairly interpretive.</p>\n\n<p>The Ibn Ezra relates that root to the idea of destitute (thus related to the destroyed) interpretats closer to the translation you are using. The point is that Jacob was destitute and poor in Aram (with Lavan) and then went to Egypt where he was further a stranger in small number - the point being to emphasize humble beginnings.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43656&st=&pgnum=5&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Radak</a> suggests relating to the idea of the great suffering that Yakov experienced while living with Lavan.</p>\n\n<p>The point being that this emphasizes the great gift bestowed by G-d in giving the land for which the first fruits are being brought, and that this is not some family inheritance to which the bringer is rightfully entitled (see <a href=\"http://www.kipa.co.il/jew/pash/84/4350.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Going back to the source for the <em>Bikurim</em> ritual, (Devarim 26.1-11) verse 10 tells us to end this <em>Bikurim</em> (First-fruits) Recitation <em>with our definitive connection to the Land of Eretz Yisrael!</em> \nThe Torah is emphasizing that we are no longer <em>landless</em> subject to the whims and wages of a foreign master [<em>Laban</em>]: \"you have changed my wages these ten times,\" <em>B'rashith</em> 31.41) but we, as <em>Ya'acov's</em> children are the object of <em>HaShem's</em> blessing in the Land of Eretz Yisrael, that which HaShem has sworn to our fathers and has given to us: <em>Devarim's</em> emphasis in 26.2, and 10 is on <strong><em>the land</em></strong> (<em>ha'Adamah</em> הָאֲדָמָה that <em>HaShem</em> chose, [<em>Moriah</em>] the place of sacrifice <em>B'rashith</em> 8.8, 13, 21; 22.14) which the Children of <em>Ya'acov</em> possess for an inheritance! </p>\n\n<p><em>Devarim</em> 26.2 \"that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which thou shalt bring in from thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee;\" here, the emphasis is on the land and the first-fruits which belongs to the Priest in the place <em>HaShem</em> chose.  \"pri haAdamah\" - \"which thou shalt bring in from thy land....\"</p>\n\n<p>\"And it will be when you are come into <em>the land</em>... and possess it, etc.\"; \"I profess this day unto the L-RD thy G-D, that I am come unto <em>the land</em> which the L-RD swore unto our fathers to give us.'\"<br>\n<em>Devarim</em> 26.10 \"And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of <em>the land</em>, which Thou, O L-RD, hast given me.' And thou shalt set it down before the L-RD thy G-D, and worship before the L-RD thy G-D.\"  </p>\n\n<p>The <em>Midrash</em> changed \"oved\" to \"ibed\":</p>\n\n<p>The <em>midrash</em> tells us that if you change the vowels from \"oved\" to \"ibed,\" the meaning is changed from \"wandering\" to \"destroyed.\" Thus, \" A wandering <em>Aramean</em> was my father\" will read, \"An <em>Aramean</em> tried to destroy my father.\" </p>\n\n<p><em>Ya'acov</em> lived in <em>Aram</em>, while courting <em>Rachel</em> and working for her father <em>Laban</em>, an <em>Aramean</em> [viz, which we would call a modern day Syrian]. Consequently, in the <em>Pesach Hagaddah</em>, <em>Laban</em> is usually seen as the <em>Aramean</em> who would have sought to destroy <em>Ya'acob</em>, reminding us of the treachery of <em>Laban</em>, who tricked <em>Ya'acov</em> into marrying <em>Leah</em> before <em>Rachel</em>, then tricked him into twenty years of servitude, and finally tried to deny him his dowry. Therefore, <em>Laban</em> may be viewed as the symbol of everyone who has tried to destroy the Jewish People.</p>\n\n<p>While <em>Rashi</em> accepted this reading, <em>Ibn Ezra</em> strongly rejected it, in favor of the interpretation that the verse refers to <em>Ya'acov</em>, who, when he was in <em>Aram</em>, was lost.</p>\n\n<p>In reading the <em>Midrash (Hagaddah)</em> together with <em>B'rashith</em> 31.43, if one takes into account the accusation of <em>Laban</em> that <em>Ya'acov</em> stole <em>Laban's</em> idols, we can see how this accusation might suffice to \"uproot everything\" (as the penalty for theft of idols would be a death sentence); yet, we are left with the phrase \"he went down into Egypt,\" so identifying who went down to Egypt tells us who the <em>Aramean</em> is. </p>\n\n<p>\"A wandering <em>Aramean</em> was my father [’arami ’oved avi]; he went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he became a great nation, mighty and populous.\" \nThe Torah says, \"he went down into Egypt..., and there he became a great nation....\" This <em>passuk</em> serves to identify who the wandering <em>Aramean</em> is: \nClearly, our Torah teaches that Laban <strong>returned</strong> to <em>Aram</em> (32.1) and <em>Ya'acov</em> went down to Egypt and [there] became a great nation (46.27).</p>\n\n<p><em>Ibn Ezra</em>, rejects the interpretation of the <em>Midrash</em> and says, <em>Ya'acov</em> was lost while in <em>Aram</em>! (Which I interpret to mean he was without roots in the land [of <em>Paddan Aram</em>], that is, he was a landless dweller in tents (he kept to his \"family trade\" and to tradition.</p>\n\n<p>While it might make sense to reconcile the <em>Hagaddah's Midrashic</em> interpretation (\"An <em>Aramean</em> attempted to destroy... etc.\") with the Torah's statement, \" A wandering <em>Aramean</em> was my father;\" one cannot escape the Torah's context, \"he went down into Egypt.\" </p>\n\n<p>The Torah never tells us that <em>Laban</em> went down to Egypt, but only that <em>Ya'acov</em> became a Great Nation there (in <em>Mitzrayim</em>) AFTER wandering landless as a shepard in <em>Paddan Aram</em>....</p>\n\n<p>In answer to the second question, \"Why was this response required to be made before the L-RD?\":\nAgain, the Torah is emphasizing our definitive connection to <em>the Land of Eretz Yisrael</em>! <em>HaAdamah</em>, \"the ground\" is prefixed with the definitive article <em>Hey</em> (the) to focus our attention on the place <em>HaShem</em> chose! </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "If water accidentally spilled on my laining sheet and rubbed out the ink, is it still shaimos?",
    "content": "# If water accidentally spilled on my laining sheet and rubbed out the ink, is it still shaimos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have a computer program that I use to print the Tikkun, so that I can practice the parsha while at work (instead of shlepping the huge Tikkun book.)</p>\n\n<p>Today, I accidentally spilled water on the sheets and the ink smudged to the point where the letters are barely readable. Is it still considered shaimos because of what it originally was when it was legible, or does the fact that the water destroyed the letters nullify it from being shaimos even if it was an accident.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the question is does the status of shaimos depend on the original properties of the document regardless of whatever accidents may occur to it afterwards?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edited:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In light of one of the comments, received - These sheets are printed from a computer program called \"Trope Trainer.\" They are <strong>not</strong> photocopies of a Tikkun book or from any other printed source. The ink used is from an HP Inkjet printer, and it's printed on \"el cheapo\" white printer paper.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to my understanding שמות (Shaimos) isn't only if it contains legible text or even text at all, as we see that the sidֵֵֵֵes of a ספר (sefer) have a din of שמות (shaimos) even though it doesn't end/or never had any text on this specific area, and from what I know that a burnt ספר תורה (sefer torah scroll) needs to be buried.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Shaimos is governed by the idea that holy information, ideas, history, etc. should not be destroyed. What, then, is considered holy enough information to be kept? The general consensus among orthodox rabbis is that shaimos worthy stuff consists of everything from hand written parchments such as Torah scrolls and Tefilin scrolls, all the way to a child's parshat hashavuah homework. What is not considered shaimos worthy stuff could include audio or video materials, computer disks, diagrams or pictures without text, etc. The concept that holds true through all of this is that if it would possible for a rabbi a couple hundred years from now to study from the work, then it should be kept and stored with other shaimos worthy stuff.</p>\n\n<p>So in your question you state that the words are barely legible... But the real question is: Could the sheets in any way possibly be read, and understood by a rabbi from the future? If the page truly looks like an inky mess of which no one could possibly draw any information from no matter how analytic you are, then I would say that it's fine to throw them away, unless you'd like to keep them, as a reminder not to spill water on your laining sheets :P</p>\n\n<p>If you are really still unsure, it takes only a few minutes to fold em up, put em in an envelope, close da envelope, and in big bold letters on the front write: \"Shaimos?\" then drop it in your rabbi's mail box the next time your on your way to synagogue...</p>\n\n<p>I was told to put a source in... <a href=\"http://www.shaimos.org/Desposing%20of%20Shaimos%20by%20the%20KOF-K.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.shaimos.org/Desposing%20of%20Shaimos%20by%20the%20KOF-K.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It appears from the Gemara in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00879.html#HtmpReportNum0228_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shabbat 116a</a>   that a Kosher Sefer Torah that has faded and less than 85 letters are legible no longer has the status of a Sefer Torah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת''ש ס''ת שנמחק אם יש בו ללקט שמונים וחמש אותיות כגון פרשת ויהי בנסוע הארון מצילין ואם לאו אין מצילין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I cannot find a corresponding entry in Shulchan Aruch for this.</p>\n\n\n",

Could they support an opposition force?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemora in Kesubos 111a says explicitely that there were three oaths in exile which are mentioned in shir hashirim 2,7 3,5 and 5,8: כדרבי יוסי ברבי חנינא דאמר: ג' שבועות הללו למה? אחת שלא יעלו ישראל בחומה, ואחת שהשביע הקדוש ברוך הוא את ישראל שלא ימרדו באומות העולם, ואחת שהשביע הקדוש ברוך הוא את העובדי כוכבים שלא ישתעבדו בהן בישראל יותר מדאי -These 3 Shavuos  are for what reason? </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>G-d made us swear that should not go up to the land of Israel by force,</p></li>\n<li><p>That we should not rebel against the nations.</p></li>\n<li><p>G-d made the nations swear that they should not subjugate the Jews too much.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So if the nations treat us well we cannot rebel. </p>\n\n<p>But if they don't keep their oath not to oppress us too much, then tit for tat we can rebel like the Gemora says in Sotah 9b-10a with regards to shimshon: והוא יחל להושיע את ישראל אמר רבי חמא ברבי חנינאהוחל שבועתו של אבימלך דכתיב (בראשית כא, כג) אם תשקר לי ולניני ולנכדי - Shimshon made mundane the oath that Avraham swore to Avimelech not to deceive his children and rashi explains  הוחל שבועתו של אבימלך - בטלה לשון לא יחל דברו (במדבר ל) לפי שהם עברו על השבועה תחילה- Because they transgressed their oath first to deceive us by oppressing the jews see Shoftim 13 for the whole story.</p>\n\n<p>The sefer ויואל משה By Rav Yoel Teitelbaum who survived the holocaust and died in 1979 goes at length to prove how these oaths are still halachicly binding today, in first section the section called \"Maamar Shalosh Shevuos\" (Treatise about the Three Oaths), which is also the main part of the book, is a classical Judaic sources and citations book sourced and interpreted by Rav Teitelbaum on everything about those Three Oaths. but it is beyond the scope of this article to go through. But see here for more halachic examples of the 3 oaths in Jewish history  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Oaths\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Oaths</a></p>\n\n<p>Stay out of politics in a country which favors the jews, just like the Sanhedrin were silent when Achashveirosh asked them whether to kill vashti or not (Ester 1,13). in the end Homon told the king what to do(1,16 see Rashi Memuchan is Homon) and ultimately sufferred when the king was in his full wrath when he got hanged. </p>\n\n<p>Even if we joined the opposition, Who's to say they will keep their promises to helpus ? they might turn around persecute us and be worst then their predecessors.</p>\n\n<p>In Mishlei 21,1 it says לב מלך ביד ה the heart of a king is in the hands of G-d, He ultimately makes desisions and we should beseach Him. </p>\n\n<p>Pirkei Avos mishna 2,3 also gives advice:<br>\n הוו זהירין ברשות, שאין מקרבין לו לאדם אלא לצרך עצמן.<br>\nBe careful with the Government (or the opposition who claim to be a better option to replace the govenment), for they only get close to a person for their own benefit<br>\nנראין כאוהבין בשעת הנאתן.<br>\nThey look like they like you when they gain<br>\nואין עומדין לו לאדם בשעת דחקו\nBut they don't stand up for you when you really need them.<br>\nOne only needs to look at our \"friend\" who we voted for Franklin Roosevelt who paid no heed to the plea of the very same Jews who had supported and voted for  him. He let blood of our breatheren spill like rivers disregarding the cry to save their lives during the holocaust, right until 1941 (where he joined the war for his own benefit because of Pearl harbor), when their bretheren, european Jewry had already been almost decimated By the Nazis Yimach shemom and too few were saved. And he also sent away refugee ships back to europe for a cetain death. We can only pray to G-d who runs the world to truly be our Savior.</p>\n\n\n",

Second, most probably it is under the dome, so then that's off limits at least for now.</p>\n\n<p>However, it says in the Torah that G-d commended Israel to worship and sacrifice in the \"place that G-d will choose\" for His name to be honored. Shilo was such a place and still is the place that for 369 years the kodosh kodoshim was present. There is strong evidence we know the exact spot there. The mishkan was always a temporary spot till the Temple was built. Why not rebuild the mishkan and wait for the building of the third temple later as a final resting place?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>The <em>Bavli</em>, <em>M'gila</em> 10, clarifies that once the temple in Jerusalem was built there is no longer anywhere else we can offer sacrificial offerings.

It says so to speak\n  \"Wake up you sleepers from your sleep and you slumberers from your\n  deep slumber and examine your deeds and return in repentance and\n  remember your Creator.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems that we should be thinking of our deeds, how good they are and what needs teshuvah and before Whom we are repenting. I think the blowing in Elul is a preparation for Rosh Hashono and the intention should be the same. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The source for the minhag to blow shofar the whole month of Elul is the Pirkei Dirabi Eliezer chapter 46. After the eigel incident, and the ensuing tshuva, Hashem told Moshe to come back up the mountain and blow the shofar so nobody would make the same mistake counting the second time and get lost after avoda zara again. Hashem was 'elevated ' with that shofar sound and therefore the chachamim instituted the blowing of the shofar on rosh chodesh Elul every year. \nThe Radal brings the Tur in siman 581 that adds 'and the whole month in order to get Bnei Yisroel to do tshuva as it says \"if the shofar is blown in the city, and the people won't be afraid?\" & to confuse sattan'.</p>\n\n<p>The Radal adds that we find these additional words in many earlier works so he assumes that was in the version of the Pirkei Drabi Eliazar they all had. </p>\n\n<p>The Aruch Hashulchan also adds along those lines that being that the shofar saved them from sin and Elul is the special month for tshuva, we therefore blow it then. </p>\n\n<p>Seems from all this that the shofar in Elul serves the same basic purpose as on Rosh Hashana. Malchus, & tshuvah. So those would be what we are concentrating on.</p>\n\n\n",

(According to this <em>g'mara</em>, he returns to his usual seat a week later, or R' Yehudah says two weeks.)  I haven't paid close attention, and anyway people in my community are not particularly attached to specific seats.  Is this the custom today, that a mourner makes a point of sitting elsewhere after <em>shiva</em>?  If it is not the custom today, when did it change?

This past year, I noticed that 3 families of mourners all sat in different places in both the the Shabbat shul as well as the weekday chapel.

Until, the rav informed me that one should not display public mourning on Shabbat. Though, he had a \"caveat\" to this. Most of the congregants are occasional attendees on Shabbat. So. most others wouldn't recall someone's \"regular\" seat, and thus would not recognized if they sat elsewhere. As I am the Torah reader and sit in the same place each week, people would notice a difference.

This mystical concept is rejected by rationalist schools of thought in favor of a more practical concept of what <em>mitzvot</em> accomplish: \"According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam</a>, mitzvos affect society, our intellects and our personalities; \nother authorities express the function of mitzvos as creating a relationship with God.\nEither way, mitzvos do not produce spiritual energy, such that one could transfer this \nto others.\"</p>\n\n<p>He cites (pp. 4 - 5) a collection of instances of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geonim\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geonim</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishonim\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rishonim</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acharonim\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acharonim</a> rejecting the idea of transferring mitzva credit and provides quotations of two Geonim, as cited by later authorities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherira_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rav Sherira Gaon</a>, cited by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_ben_Aderet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashba</a> in his Responsa, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1379&st=&pgnum=336&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vol. 7 #539</a> (this and the next translation presumably by R' Slifkin, source links added for Mi Yodeya):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A person cannot merit someone else with reward; his elevation and greatness and \n  pleasure from the radiance of the Divine Presence is only in accordance with his deeds.

Back in the day when Belshazzar\n  was still king, Daniel had a dream in which he saw visions. He woke up\n  and wrote down the main points, so he wouldn’t forget anything. From\n  here, the Book is in the first person, since it is what Daniel wrote\n  after his dream. (We’ll tell it in the third person, mostly.)</p>\n  \n  <p>In his vision, Daniel saw four winds from Heaven and churn the sea.\n  Four huge beasts, each different, rose up out of the water. The first\n  was a lion with wings like an eagle. Daniel watched as the wings were\n  plucked and it stood like a human being, with a human heart. The\n  second was like a bear. It had three ribs between its teeth and it was\n  told to eat much flesh. The third beast was like a leopard with four\n  wings and four heads. The leopard-thing was given authority to rule.\n  The fourth beast was a terrifying creature with iron teeth, that\n  trampled everything in its path. It had ten horns and was completely\n  unlike any other that Daniel had seen. While Daniel was examining the\n  horns, a new one sprouted, while three of the old ones fell out. There\n  were eyes like a human’s on this horn and a mouth speaking arrogantly.</p>\n  \n  <p>Daniel watched as thrones were brought and G-d was seated. (G-d is\n  here called “Atik Yomin,” which is Aramaic for “The One of Ancient\n  Days.”) In Daniel’s vision, G-d was clothed in white, His “hair”\n  (whatever that means) was like wool, and His throne was of flame, with\n  flaming wheels. There were a million angels attending Him and a\n  billion more on call. G-d sat in judgment and the record books were\n  opened before Him.</p>\n  \n  <p>As Daniel watched, the horn on the fourth beast continued to mouth\n  off, so it was declared in contempt of court. The beast was killed and\n  its body destroyed, given to the fire. The rest of the beasts lost\n  their authority, but their lives were spared, at least for the time\n  being.</p>\n  \n  <p>Daniel continued to watch as a man (or something that looked like a\n  man) was brought before G-d. G-d gave this person dominion over all\n  the world, never to cease.</p>\n  \n  <p>This vision made Daniel feel anxious (as well it might!) and it\n  perplexed him (as it does us!). In his dream, Daniel asked one of the\n  angels to explain what exactly was going on. The angel told him that\n  the four beasts are four empires that will rule the world. Then the\n  holy ones (Israel) will inherit that role.</p>\n  \n  <p>Daniel wanted to understand what made the fourth beast, who had been\n  slain, so different from the others, with its iron teeth, copper claws\n  (not mentioned earlier), and ten horns. Daniel had seen the fourth\n  beast antagonize G-d until it was destroyed. The angel replied that\n  the fourth beast represented a different kind of kingdom, one that\n  would trample the entire world. The ten horns represent ten kings that\n  would rule it. A new king would arise, who would be different from the\n  others, and he would topple three other kings. However, this new king\n  would speak against G-d and trouble the Jews, planning to change the\n  times and the law. The Jews would be under his thumb until some future\n  time, when the tables will be turned. Then, in the Messianic era, the\n  Jews would have dominion that would not cease.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is as much of the vision as Daniel chose to reveal. He wrote down\n  the main points, but he kept the details to himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In NYC as well as many other U.S. cities where large shul buildings were constructed in the early 1900's, even prior to the mass immigration following the Holocaust, almost every shul had a women's balcony. I can't think of any shul from that era that was NOT built with a balcony.</p>\n\n<p>Lincoln Square Synagogue, a.k.a. Rabbi Riskin's shul, is circular and the seats are arranged as in a stadium. I understand that at the time that it was built, there was much controversy regarding this arrangement - both b/c of people facing different directions when davening as well as the mechitzah problem b/c with different levels of seating, the mechitzah didn't serve the purpose of men not seeing women (and vice versa) while davening.

Even if the attacker is scared away, you need to be ready to act if he is not stopped.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the Torah explicitly allows a person to kill a home invader unless \"it is clear as day\" that the invader is not a danger. For example <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/5775/print\" rel=\"nofollow\">Self-Defense</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jewishjournal.com/torah_portion/article/law_and_order_20080201/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Law and Order Parashat Mishpatim (Exodus 21:1 - 24:18)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://vbm-torah.org/archive/salt-shemot/18-6mishpatim.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"ba ba-machteret,\"</a> actually states that this is not a matter of \"Pikuach Nefesh\" but it is a case of rodef and the homeowner is in effect an agent of bais din carrying out a sentence of death that the invader has drawn upon himself. However, this would not prevent the homeowner from using his gun on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We read in Parashat Mishpatim the law of \"ba ba-machteret,\" a special\n  provision concerning a thief breaking into a house: \"If the thief is\n  seized while tunneling, and he is beaten to death, there is no\n  bloodguilt for him\" (22:1). Rashi, based on the Gemara in Masekhet\n  Sanhedrin (62), explains that a thief breaking into a home may be\n  killed. The Gemara bases this halakha on the principle of, \"ein adam\n  ma'amid atzmo al mamono\" - we assume that a person will attempt to\n  protect his property against intruders. By extension, then, we assume\n  that the thief anticipates confrontation with the homeowner and is\n  prepared to kill him. This assumption renders the burglar a \"rodef,\" a\n  \"pursuer,\" attempting to kill, in which case others may come kill him\n  to defend the intended victim.</p>\n  \n  <p>Later in Masekhet Sanhedrin (72b), the Gemara observes that this verse\n  does not specify who kills the burglar. The verse rather says simply,\n  \"ve-huka\" - the thief is beaten to death. There is no indication in\n  this verse as to whether it was the homeowner or a third party who\n  killed the intruder. The Gemara derives from this ambiguity that\n  anybody may kill the thief, not only the homeowner, whom we presume\n  the burglar is prepared to kill. The Gemara explains that were it not\n  for this textual indication, we would have limited this provision to\n  the homeowner, and have forbidden the killing of this intruder by any\n  outsider.</p>\n  \n  <p>Why is this so? Once we have determined intent to kill, thus inviting\n  the application of the standard halakha of rodef, why would we\n  restrict this license to kill? Generally, anyone may and in fact\n  should kill the rodef, the pursuer. Why should this case be any\n  different?</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Avraham Yitzchak Sorotzkin, in his \"Gevurat Yitzchak,\" answers by\n  carefully dissecting this halakha of rodef. What precisely entitles\n  someone to kill a pursuer? Rav Chayim Brisker (in Hilkhot Rotzei'ach)\n  argues that the interest in saving the victim's life itself does not\n  provide sufficient grounds to allow killing the pursuer. This is due\n  to a principle in halakha called, \"ein dochin nefesh mipenei nefesh\" -\n  we may not discard one life in favor of another. In a rodef situation,\n  one person will be killed; either the intended victim or the pursuer.\n  We do not have the right to make this decision. What produces the\n  license to kill the pursuer is a different notion - a \"chiyuv mita\"\n  (death sentence) issued by the Torah upon him. The Torah legislates\n  that one pursuing another to kill him deserves to be killed. This\n  entitles - and in fact obligates - onlookers to intervene and kill the\n  pursuer.</p>\n  \n  <p>In certain situations, a person may technically attempt to kill\n  another but will not have a chiyuv mita issued against him. Rav\n  Sorotzkin suggests that one could have viewed the case of ba\n  ba-machteret as such an example. The burglar has not broken into the\n  house to kill; he wants to steal money, not to take a life. Thus,\n  although technically he might be deemed a pursuer, in that he is\n  prepared to kill, one could have argued that no chiyuv mita can be\n  applied in this case, since his primary intent is not to kill.</p>\n  \n  <p>This, Rav Sorotzkin explains, answers our original question. Before\n  extracting from the verse the permission for all people to kill the\n  burglar, one would have thought that he does notbear a chiyuv mita. As\n  such, the principle of \"ein dochin nefesh mipenei nefesh\" would\n  prevent the license to kill the ba ba-machteret. Only the homeowner,\n  who is himself threatened, would have the right to kill the burglar\n  because of a separate halakha sanctioning killing in self defense:\n  \"Ha-ba le-horgecha hashkem ve-horgo\" (\"Someone who comes to kill you -\n  arise and kill him\"). Therefore, only once the verse informs us\n  otherwise can we extend the license to all people, besides the\n  intended victim himself.</p>\n  \n  <hr>\n  \n  <p>Yesterday we discussed the halakha of \"ba ba-machteret,\" introduced in\n  Parashat Mishpatim, by which we assume that a burglar breaking into a\n  home is prepared to kill the homeowner should he attempt to resist the\n  theft. This then activates the halakha of \"rodef,\" which allows for\n  the killing of anyone attempting to himself kill another person.</p>\n  \n  <p>Although the Gemara clearly classifies the ba ba-machteret under the\n  general category of rodef, an important distinction between the two\n  arises from the writings of the Rambam. In presenting the standard\n  halakha of rodef, the Rambam (Hilkhot Rotzei'ach 1:6) describes it as\n  a mitzva for onlookers to come to the aid of the intended victim and\n  kill the assailant. By contrast, when the Rambam introduces the\n  halakha of ba ba-machteret (Hilkhot Geneiva 9:7), he writes that\n  people have permission to kill the burglar, mentioning nothing about a\n  mitzva or obligation.</p>\n  \n  <p>Why does the Rambam distinguish between ba ba-machteret and rodef, if\n  the Gemara explicitly describes the former as an instance of the\n  latter?</p>\n  \n  <p>The answer seems to lie in the two-step process involved in the\n  provision of rodef. Apparently, according to the Rambam, this halakha\n  itself does not introduce any mitzva to kill the pursuer. Rather, the\n  halakha of rodef merely sanctions this killing. This is the first\n  stage. Once the Torah permits onlookers to kill the rodef, the general\n  mitzva of saving lives now requires that they do so; once one is given\n  an opportunity to save someone's life, he bears an obligation to do\n  so. But this obligation stems not from the concept of rodef, but\n  rather from the general mitzva of saving lives. The concept of rodef\n  merely \"sets the stage\" for this obligation to take effect, by\n  permitting the killing of the assailant.</p>\n  \n  <p>In the case of ba ba-machteret, however, we do not reach this second\n  stage. Recall that this institution stems from our assumption that a\n  person will attempt to forcefully resist the theft of his property.\n  This yields a second assumption, that the burglar, aware of this human\n  tendency, is prepared to kill the homeowner should he attempt to\n  resist the burglary. In most situations, however, the homeowner can\n  easily save his life by remaining passive and allowing the thief to\n  take whatever property he wants. Given that his life is not actually\n  in immediate danger, the mitzva to save his life obviously cannot take\n  effect. Only the rule of rodef applies, by which the burglar brings\n  upon himself a chiyuv mita (death sentence) which allows other people\n  to kill him. No mitzva, however, is involved in this killing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

While of course there is no actual biblical or ancient rabbinic decree about TV, Rabbis do have the authority to make decrees that their followers will follow. The problem with TV is that many Rabbis were worried that it will bring outside influences into the house, for example, things that are inappropriate, violence, in addition to it being considered a waste of time. Also, some communities are \"secluded\" (not in a bad way, but you preserve the Jewish spirit), and avoid any influence from the secular world. In chareidi (ultra-orthodox) and chassidic (which is probably included in chareidi) communities, it's very rare to find a TV, being that many Rabbis, and also those societies, either ban TV or hold strongly against it. In modern-Orthodox, mizrachi, or dati leumi communities, you'd find TVs in many homes. It's a good idea to find out what the community you want to join does, although if you want my personal opinion, stay away from it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You may want to review the laws of Talmud Torah in Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah, <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01976_part_35.html#HtmpReportNum0001_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">סימן רמו - שחיב כל אדם בתלמוד תורה</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you feel that watching TV is in line with these Halachot, then (after consulting with your LOR) you probably can do so. </p>\n\n<p>Amongst other things we learn there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>א</strong> כָּל אִישׁ יִשְׂרָאֵל חַיָּב בְּתַלְמוּד תּוֹרָה, בֵּין עָנִי בֵּין עָשִׁיר, בֵּין שָׁלֵם בְּגוּפוֹ בֵּין בַּעַל יִסוּרִים, בֵּין בָּחוּר בֵּין זָקֵן גָּדוֹל. אֲפִלּוּ עָנִי הַמְחַזֵּר עַל הַפְּתָחִים, אֲפִלּוּ בַּעַל אִשָּׁה וּבָנִים, חַיָּב לִקְבֹּעַ לוֹ זְמַן לְתַלְמוּד תּוֹרָה בַּיּוֹם וּבַלַּיְלָה‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That everybody needs to learn Torah every day.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>יח</strong> תַּלְמוּד תּוֹרָה שָׁקוּל כְּנֶגֶד כָּל הַמִּצְוֹת. הָיָה לְפָנָיו עֲשִׂיַּת מִצְוָה וְתַלְמוּד תּוֹרָה, אִם אֶפְשָׁר לַמִּצְוָה לְהֵעָשׂוֹת עַל יְדֵי אֲחֵרִים לֹא יַפְסִיק תַּלְמוּדוֹ, וְאִם לָאו יַעֲשֶׂה הַמִּצְוָה וְיַחֲזֹר לְתוֹרָתוֹ. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Torah learning is more important  than some Mitzvot.

So a man who chose to be castrated is allowed to marry a convert, but not a born-Jew.  \"What is the spiritual significance?\" Don't go there. It's a technical law on the books. For all other aspects, he's a Jew like anyone else. <em>No one</em> needs to know anything about this person's private parts, except for a woman he's considering marrying! The commentaries (e.g. Sefer HaChinuch) suggest that in Biblical times, a person could make good money and honor by choosing to be castrated (required for service in many royal palaces), so the Torah had to institute some sort of penalty to discourage it, effectively by making finding a partner significantly less convenient.</p>\n\n<p>There is no analogous prohibition for non-Jews. (The Talmud debates whether non-Jews are allowed to get castrated, but there is certainly no penalty clause prohibiting categories of marriage if it was done.)</p>\n\n<p>There's a contemporary text on Jewish law vis-a-vis medicine, <em>Nishmat Avraham</em>, that deals with your other questions exhaustively. <a href=\"http://artscroll.com/Products/NI3H.html\">Here's a link to an English version of the book.</a> As to what counts as injured, this gets technical and graphic so I'll refer you to the above text. (But the Talmud says explicitly that the prohibition applies to someone who got their vas deferens damaged, too.)</p>\n\n<p>In short, the prohibition is only on <em>getting</em> married, not staying married; hence if Joe Mainstream Jew marries Judy Mainstream Jew, and a few days later Joe is in some accident that damages his private parts, he's allowed to remain married to Judy. </p>\n\n<p>And the Talmud says there is no penalty on someone whose anatomy was damaged by disease; I don't know the details but if I recall correctly this is applied as well to someone who had a testicle surgically removed because of cancer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>These laws are found in Shulchan Aruch Even Ha'ezer siman 5. Many of these laws are based on the inability to procreate and therefore in modern times where there have been medical discoveries, many poskim rule slightly different than the straight Shulchan Aruch & Ramma. For instance, no difference is made between which testicle is damaged. </p>\n\n\n",

You went to war, G-d made you successful, and you took all its captives שבי .</p>\n\n<p>Now, you have all these captives. You see a beautiful woman. You want her as your wife. The woman has emotions about her being imprisoned, and the Torah is speaking about her state of captivity and what that does to her and how you should treat her feelings; not so much of her \"physical\" status of being a captive. Hence, the use of the term שִּׁבְיָה, since the Torah is instructing you how to deal with her feelings of captivity - the emotions and her captivity status, not the fact that she is a \"captive\". A careful analysis of the following verses indicates that once you intend to take her as your wife, she is no longer like the rest of the \"captives\", but, since she has to shave her head and mourn her parents (who may still be alive, actually), she is still in the state of \"captivity\" until she officially becomes your wife a month later.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to view things:</p>\n\n<p>The 1st verse means - \"You shall take its (the enemy's) CAPTIVES\"\nThe 2nd verse means - \"You shall see a woman in captivity\" vs. having said (if it had used the word שבי in the 2nd verse,) \"You shall see a woman among the captives\".</p>\n\n<p>So, there is a BIG difference in meaning.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah (G-d) chooses (His) its words very carefully...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Malbim, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40103&st=&pgnum=282\" rel=\"nofollow\">commenting on the second of the two verses</a>, explains that שבי refers to someone who is already definitively a captive, i.e. it has already been decided that they will be taken and kept as a captive/slave.  שביה, on the other hand, refers to those who are still under consideration whether they will be taken as captives.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the Midrash understands ושבית שביו - you shall take their captives - to include even Canaanite captives, who normally we must not let live, we can take as captives.  The Midrash understands the verse to say that we can take those captives who were captives of the nation we defeated - those who were already decidedly captives before the war, which could include Canaanim.  Even them we can take as potential captives.  The next verse is referring to the camp of prisoners that have just been captured and are being considered for whether or not they should be kept.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>My dikduk skills are lacking but the word שביו is the posessive of the nation. שביה on the other hand is not a possesive term as evidenced by the fact that it is not written with a מפיק הא, in פסוק י׳ג for instance her שמלת שביה does have a מפיק הא. This also holds true also in Targum where שביו is given possesive treatment שביהון, &  on the other hand בשביה is בשביתא. </p>\n\n<p>Why the plural of שבי is שביה I'm not sure. Perhaps being conquered is effeminate. But that would be a different question.</p>\n\n\n",

Would he commit actions that disallow him from עולם הבא, that will not be the case. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha#Flexibility\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Wikipedia's</a> definition of \"halacha\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Orthodox Jews maintain halakha is derived from the divine law of the\n  Torah (Bible), rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees and customs\n  combined. As such it should be adhered to as an unalterable authority.\n  They also believe there are traditional formulas that date back to\n  Moses on how the divine law may be interpreted – see above, \"Rules by\n  which early Jewish law was derived\". While Conservative Jews have\n  varied views regarding the origin of the Torah and its authority\n  today, and believe it can be continuously reinterpreted. Their view of\n  halakha has given rise to substantial differences in approach as well\n  as result.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In relating this definition to attempting a fair answer to your question, I am making some assumptions which may be incorrect, but here goes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The fact that you cited the Gemarrah and the tone of your question leads me to sense that you are seeking the \"Orthodox\" viewpoint</li>\n<li>Mi Yodeya does state in its overall philosophy as well as answers to many questions, CYLOR, \"We are not rabbis\" and other similar disclaimers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that Mi Yodeya seems to imply that only views from an Orthodox rabbi are \"valid\" for your own personal purposes. I read some question on meta that asks about accepting non-Orthodox viewpoints, and I couldn't quite glean a conclusion about how the moderators deal with them. So, you may want to follow with a related question on meta.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, since Mi Yodeya is making a disclaimer that we are not people dictating or deciding halacha, then, I would say the answer to your question is \"no\". You can learn a lot of Torah ideas from this site, and, perhaps get your Olam Haba points for learning Torah, but, I don't think, specifically for leaning \"halachot\", based on the above definition and Orthodox view of halacha.</p>\n\n<p>With that, I suggest both CYLOR as well as CYFMYM (Contact your friendly Mi Yodeya Moderator.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is the chabad performing under valid Orthodox Judaic rules\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I see many Chabad centers around , is Chabad an Orthodox Jewish organisation ? And which major authorities (Like Chief Rabbinate of Israel) recognize them as such?</p>\n\n<p>To clarify further , is Chabad an Orthodox Jewish organization or a Messianic one?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Let's pretend you asked this question in 1990.</p>\n\n<p>Chabad-Lubavitch (Chabad refers to its philosophy, Lubavitch the town in Europe from which this sect originates) operates with their own brand identity, and the look and feel are occasionally a <em>little</em> different than what you'd see in most Orthodox synagogues, but the differences are minor enough that they'd be considered Orthodox. A person who converted through Chabad-Lubavitch, for instance, would be considered Jewish in almost all Orthodox circles. (However some of the practices s/he picked up may be a little bit different, so there may be a little bit of relearning if s/he wanted to fit in with the non-Chabad crowd. And that's okay. Plenty of people reaffiliate within streams of Orthodoxy.)</p>\n\n<p>Note that some Chabad synagogues are designed as outreach centers, rather than a place the Chabad rabbi would choose to pray if he was visiting New York. So you might see prayers in English or the like. But if you ask any Chabad rabbi \"what does an unadulterated prayer service look like\", it will have the same core structure as any Orthodox service.</p>\n\n<p>Now here's what's happened in the past few years that has troubled many folks in \"mainstream\" Orthodoxy: many Lubavitchers hoped that their grand rabbi, the late Menachem Mendel Schneurson, would turn out to be the Jewish messiah. Then he died. This effectively resulted in three streams of thought within Lubavitch:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A.  <em>Rabbi Schneurson stood a good chance of becoming the messiah. So had many other great Jewish leaders throughout the centuries; e.g. the Talmud says King Hezekiah came close. But for whatever reason, the time wasn't right, or the generation wasn't worthy, or whatever -- God decided otherwise. We hope that someone else becomes the messiah soon.</em> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This approach is entirely compatible with mainstream Orthodox thought -- it's basically reading right out of Maimonides' code of law.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>B. <em>Rabbi Schneurson will still be the messiah. Either he isn't really dead, or he's going to come back from the dead to become the messiah.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Mainstream orthodoxy say these attitudes are philosophically wrong. (Now <em>how</em> wrong? It's possible there were Talmudic opinions that espoused something like them, but the majority has ruled otherwise.) While quite dangerous (it starts to look like another religion), most Orthodox rabbis have ruled that such beliefs are considered foolishness, but not technically heresy. (The list of such rabbis includes Rabbi Yehuda Hertzl Henkin, in a responsa published in Bnei Banim -- there's already a link to it here on J.SE; Rabbi Hershel Welcher, head of the Vaad of Queens (he's said it publicly repeatedly); and Rabbi Hershel Schachter (an acquaintance of mine in the pulpit mailed the question to Rabbi Schachter and received a written reply, which I saw).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, a cow slaughtered by someone who doesn't believe in God is not kosher; but it would be kosher if slaughtered by someone who follows mainstream Orthodox theology but believes Rabbi Schneurson gets a second coming. And you can count such a person for a minyan.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>C. <em>Rabbi Schneurson transcended the human experience and negated his own interest to that of God to the point that they're virtually indistinguishable; it is permitted to bow to a picture of Rabbi Schneurson because he was so close to God.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At this point we've crossed a theological line. </p>\n\n<p>So: minor difference in look, feel, and practice? No issue at all. Philosophy A about Schneurson? Entirely mainstream. Philosophy B? Rejected by mainstream Orthodoxy but not to the point of severing ties. Philosophy C? Beyond the pale. Now what percentage of Lubavitchers today espouse A vs. B. vs. C, and where are the trends headed? That's hotly debated today.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# In Levirate marriage, can the widow refuse marriage to the brother-in-law?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Levirate marriage, the Torah text gives the option for the brother in law to refuse when it says: <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9989/jewish/Chapter-25.htm\">Devorim 25 (7)</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But if the man does not wish to take his brother's wife, the brother's\n  wife shall go up to the gate, to the elders, and say, \"My husband's\n  brother has refused to perpetuate his brother's name in Israel he does\n  not wish to perform the obligation of a husband's brother with me.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and then the chalitzah ceremony is needed. </p>\n\n<p>Question 1: Does the widow (sister-in-law, yovomoh) have the right to refuse the deceased husband's brother (yovom)?</p>\n\n<p>Question 2: If the yevomoh can refuse the yovom, is there chalitzah?</p>\n\n<p>Question 3: If there is chalitzah, will the yevomoh:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“approach him before the eyes of the elders and remove his shoe from\n  his foot. And she shall spit before his face and answer [him] and say,\n  \"Thus shall be done to the man who will not build up his brother's\n  household!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Devorim 25(9))?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Rambam deals with this situation as with many others <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960620/jewish/Yibbum-vChalitzah-Chapter-Two.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yibbum vChalitzah - Chapter Two</a> The quoted sections below should answer your questions. It appears that the choice is completely with the brother(s). Also note that if a brother jumps in and performs chalitzah (or yibum) the other brothers cannot do anything about that. The Rambam also deals with cases in which two brothers cause problems for each other, forcing chalitzah. Chapter six deals with cases in which the brother can do either chalitzah or yibum, can do neither chalitzah or yibum, can do yibum but not chalitzah, or can do chalitzah but not yibum. The Rambam brings up a number of complicated cases.</p>\n\n<p>In chapter 1 the Rambam says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Halacha 2<br>\n  If the yavam does not want to perform the rite of yibbum, or\n  if the woman does not consent,4 he should [free her from this\n  obligation through the rite of] chalitzah. [Only] afterwards is she\n  permitted to marry another man.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is a positive commandment5 of Scriptural law for [a brother] to\n  perform chalitzah for [the deceased's widow], if he does not want to\n  perform the rite of yibbum, as [Deuteronomy 25:9] states: \"She\n  shall... remove his shoe.\"6</p>\n  \n  <p>The mitzvah of yibbum takes precedence over the mitzvah of chalitzah.7</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means that if the woman refuses, the man <strong>should</strong> perform chalitza, but he is able to insist on yibum even if the woman does not want to. Note that if the woman insists, halacha 10 below states that she loses her kesuvah. This is similar to the halacha of a \"rebellious wife\". It does appear that if the woman does not want to perform yibum and the brother is willing to let her go, that would be preferable. Note that in Chapter 2, Halacha 10,we say that we \"compel\" him to perform chalitzah. This means that like a get, he must still make the decision.</p>\n\n<p>However, the quotes from Chapter 2 should give the basic halacha. I am not posting the footnotes, but you can see them at the site. I left the footnote number in the quotes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Halacha 3<br>\n  When [a yavam] engages in marital relations with his yevamah, \n  he acquires her [as his wife]. [This applies] regardless of whether he\n  entered into these relations unintentionally10 or with a licentious\n  intent,11 under duress or willingly, whether he acted with a\n  licentious intent and she acted unintentionally or under duress, or\n  she acted with a licentious intent and he acted unintentionally or\n  under duress, whether she was asleep12 or awake, whether he performed\n  vaginal or anal intercourse,13 whether he inserted merely the head of\n  his penis or the entire organ.14</p>\n  \n  <p>Halacha 10<br>\n  The laws pertaining to a yevamah who is fit to perform yibbum30 and\n  refuses to do so are the same as those governing a woman who rebels\n  against her husband.31 We compel her yavam to perform chalitzah with\n  her,32 and she forfeits [the money due her by virtue of her] marriage\n  contract.</p>\n  \n  <p>When the deceased is survived by many wives, the one that the yavam\n  asks to perform yibbum and refuses is considered to have \"rebelled.\"\n  He should perform chalitzah with her, and she forfeits [the money due\n  her by virtue of her] marriage contract.33The other wives who were not\n  asked [to perform yibbum] receive [the money due them by virtue of\n  their] marriage contracts, as other widows do.</p>\n  \n  <p>Halacha 11<br>\n  If [the deceased was survived by] many [brothers], and the\n  eldest brother states that he wants to perform yibbum with [one of the\n  deceased's wives], [she is under obligation to him].34 Even if she\n  does not desire [to marry] him, but is willing to marry one of his\n  brothers, her desire is not considered. For the mitzvah is that the\n  eldest brother perform yibbum.</p>\n  \n  <p>Halacha 12 [The following rules apply when] the eldest brother says:\n  \"I do not want to perform either yibbum or chalitzah. Behold, my\n  brother is present.\" If one of the brothers asks her to perform\n  yibbum, and she does not desire [to marry] him, but she does desire\n  [to marry] another brother, and he desires [to marry] her, she is not\n  considered to have \"rebelled.\" Once the eldest brother upon whom the\n  mitzvah is incumbent demurs, all the brothers are equal.35 Since she\n  desires [to marry] one of [the brothers], and he desires [to marry]\n  her, she is not considered to have \"rebelled.\"36</p>\n  \n  <p>Moreover, if one of the brothers was in another country, and the woman\n  says: \"I would prefer to wait for him to come and perform yibbum with\n  me. I do not want [to marry] this one,\" she is not considered to have\n  \"rebelled.\" [Since] the brother who asks [to marry her] is not the\n  eldest, we tell him: \"If you desire to perform chalitzah and pay her\n  [the money due her by virtue of her] marriage contract, you may.37 If\n  not, she wants to wait until your brother comes. Since you do not have\n  a prior claim, [she is granted that prerogative].38</p>\n  \n  <p>Halacha 13<br>\n  If the brother [whom the yevamah desired to marry] returned\n  and did not desire [to marry] her, we turn again to the brother who\n  desired to perform yibbum, but was not desired by the woman. We tell\n  the woman: \"There is no one who desires to perform yibbum with you\n  except this one, and the mitzvah of yibbum is given priority. Either\n  perform yibbum with this one, or leave without receiving [the money\n  due because of your] marriage contract, as is the law with regard to\n  all women who rebel.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Does the widow (sister-in-law, yovomoh) have the right to refuse the deceased husband's brother (yovom)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Before yibbum, yes:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמר רב ששת אמר ר' אלעזר משום רבי אלעזר בן עזריה מנין ליבמה שנפלה לפני מוכה שחין שאין חוסמין אותה שנאמר לא תחסום שור בדישו וסמיך ליה כי ישבו אחים יחדיו</p>\n<p>Rav Sheshes said in the name of Rabbi Elazar in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya -- how do we know that a yevama who \"fell in front of\" (became a yevama to) a מוכה שחין, someone who is afflicted by boils, that we do not \"muzzle\" her [see Rashi], as it says (Devarim <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9989#v=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">25:4</a>) \"do not muzzle an ox while it is threshing,\" which is followed by the parsha of yibbum (ibid. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9989#v=5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5</a>).</p>\n<p>Rashi there:<br />\nשאין חוסמין. אין [סותמין] טענותיה לכופה להתייבם לו אלא כופין אותו וחולץ....‏<br />\n\"We do not muzzle her\" -- this means that we do not \"shut down\" her arguments, to force her to marry him in yibbum, rather we force him to do חליצה....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>( <em>Yevamos <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=4&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4a</a>, translation mine</em> )</p>\n<h3>After yibbum, no:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הבא על יבמתו בין בשוגג בין במזיד בין באונס בין ברצון אפילו....היא אנוסה והוא לא אנוס....קנה.‏</p>\n<p>Someone who had relations with his yevama, whether by accident or on purpose, forced or willingly even....if she was forced and he was not....they are married.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>( <em>Yevamos <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=53b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">53b</a>, translation mine</em> )</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> If the yevomoh can refuse the yovom, is there chalitzah?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Yes, there is chalitzah.</h3>\n<p>See the Rashi quoted above (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=4&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4a</a>, sv שאין חוסמין), as well as Yevamos <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=106&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">106a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תנו רבנן חליצה מוטעת כשרה אי זו היא חליצה מוטעת אמר ר''ל כל שאומרים לו חלוץ ובכך אתה כונסה אמר ליה רבי יוחנן....אלא כל שאומרים לו חלוץ לה ע''מ שתתן לך מאתים זוז.....ומעשה באשה אחת שנפלה לפני יבם שאין הגון לה ואמרו לו חלוץ לה על מנת שתתן לך מאתים זוז ובא מעשה לפני רבי חייא והכשירה.‏</p>\n<p>It was taught in a <em>braysa</em>; חליצה מוטעת is כשר.

    "content": "# How does a Braille siddur work?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A member of our minyan has a degenerative vision problem and has, for a time, been using a home-made very-large-print siddur.  After an absence, she returned this Shabbat with a guide dog and said she can no longer use the siddur.  She said the stuff she has memorized and listened to the rest.  I've started to work with her to help her learn/memorize more (and we'll get recordings), which helps some, but that's not an ideal solution.  I mean, being able to do the Shabbat t'filah from memory is helpful, but it doesn't help with seasonal changes, and memorizing the whole service is a big task.  What she really needs, I suspect, is a Braille siddur.</p>\n\n<p>But does her knowledge of standard Braille help with Hebrew?  I know that it's possible to have a Braille siddur, because I once saw somebody using one, but I didn't ask him about it at the time.  Do they transliterate the Hebrew, so you use the Braille alphabet you already know?  Or is there a scheme of writing Hebrew in Braille that requires the reader to learn a new Braille alphabet?  I got the sense in talking with her that she's probably not ready to learn a second Braille system yet (she's still learning the first).</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to help her get the best tools to be able to participate in the minyan.  But before I approach the siddur publisher to ask about a Braille edition, I want to know if that would actually be helpful to somebody who only knows \"regular\" Braille for the English language.  And that leads me to the question: how do Hebrew texts get set in Braille, linguistically speaking?</p>\n\n<p>(This question arises out of a Jewish situation, but I recognize that it might be borderline here as it's about language (in a way) and publishing.  If people think it's off-topic, please speak up.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Being blind myself, I can more specifically address Hebrew Braille and how siddurim work.  As the first answer says, a person who knows English Grade 2 braille does not need to start from scratch, because there are many similarities.  However, it is not transliteration; the Hebrew letters are represented character for character, with the vowels, when used, following the consonants, nut under them.  Hebrew, as any other script, and even music notation, is written from left to right in braille.  Most of the consonants correspond to their English equivalents, with some exceptions.  For example, the Vav is represented by the symbol that is the W in english (the symbol for English V is used for Vet), the Chet is X, the Tav is an inverted T (which in English Grade 2 is the contraction for OU.  Most of the vowels are similar to english vowels, but some are different.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the siddurim themselves are concerned, they are usually in many volumes, and the ones produced by the Jewish Braille Institute typically have the Hebrew text on the right side of the binding, and the English on the left  The specially made Sidurim from CSB Care, and the ones that come from Mesillah in Israel do not have English, and the instructions are usually in unvoweled Hebrew.  In my opinion, the representation of the entire Sidur page for page is not always ideal.  The Birnbaum Siddur and Machzor provided with JBI often, especially on holidays, require you to have several volumes in front of you,  In one point, on Yom Kippur, it is necessary to switch from one volume to another in the middle of the silent Amidah.  The Artscroll Siddur, also provided by JBI, tries to set up each volume to have all that is needed.  It does not always succeed, as Shacharis has many parts to it, and with English translation included, it cannot fit into one volume.  My first preference is those provided by CSB Care or by Mesillah, which have no English, and can fit even an entire Morning Service in one volume.  But I only state this as my opinion, as English is sometimes a necessity for others.  In addition, braille Siddurim are in general bulky, and sometimes slow the user down, especially in a fast-paced Minyan.  I have resorted to memorizing as much as possible.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I have a friend who is blind. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Braille\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew braille does <em>not</em> have its own alphabet</a>, but rather uses the same symbols that English braille does.

The Artscroll Stone Edition Tanakh does not list the specific source for this, but it says that Israel was commanded to do three things once it settled in the land, the first being the choosing of a King.

In chapter 12, Shmuel recaps the mistake that the Jewish people have made in requesting a king.  In verse 17, he tells them the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הֲלוֹא קְצִיר-חִטִּים, הַיּוֹם--אֶקְרָא אֶל-יְהוָה, וְיִתֵּן קֹלוֹת וּמָטָר; וּדְעוּ וּרְאוּ, כִּי-רָעַתְכֶם רַבָּה אֲשֶׁר עֲשִׂיתֶם בְּעֵינֵי יְהוָה, לִשְׁאוֹל לָכֶם, מֶלֶךְ</p>\n<p>Is it not wheat harvest to-day? I will call unto the LORD, that He may send thunder and rain; and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.' (Translation from Mechon Mamre)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The message (which Bnei Yisroel took - v. 19) was conveyed by the rain in the wheat harvest season.  Rain in the harvest season is terrible, as it makes the ground soggy and causes the crop in the ground to rot.  In its proper time, rain is a great blessing.</p>\n<p>The Malbim (s.v. אקרא) explains that the message to the Jewish people was that just as rain in the right time is a blessing, but in the wrong time is a curse, so too their request of a king is out of place.  In a time when Israel was led by Shmuel, who performed miracles for them and guided them, asking for a king was a terrible mistake.  After Shmuel died, and they were subject to the rule of nature and did not have a leader of the caliber of Shmuel, asking for a king would have been appropriate.</p>\n<p>Certainly it was a mitzvah, but it has its proper time and place.</p>\n\n\n",

However, before it had made it all the way around, he continued on to the beracha on the candle light, to which they needed to respond amen and to use the light.  Some of them, as far as I could tell, had not yet gotten the besamim by the time havdallah was over.</p>\n\n<p>Did those who did not smell the besamim before answering amen to other berachos, and holding their hands up to the candle light, make an interruption which invalidated their inclusion in the beracha on the besamim?

The people should have the intention to fulfill their obligation through the leader and the leader should have the intention to fulfill their obligation as well. The listeners must hear the entire blessing and after the blessings respond with Amen and they are yotze.  Whether or not there is an interruption in some cases is an argument between Rashi in Sukkah 38b and Tosfot in Brachot 21b, and this might differ on your local accepted posek.<br>\nYalkut Yosef 216.8 sites an example where it would be an interruption if they added passages after the blessing of besamim but before smelling and 297.6 where it explains it is forbidden to speak during havdala.</p>\n\n<p>Generally if they did not speak and waiting for the opportunity to smell the besamim even tough they said amen to the next blessing there is no interruption because their obligation is already fulfilled through the leader.  An example of this is Yalkut Yosef 295.3 where the leader is the person responsible to drink the wine after havdala and the people fulfill their obligation after the leader drinks the required amount.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I believe that brachot that require an action following it cannot be interrupted, except for things that are needed to fulfill that action. This is true for the person making the blessing as well as those who answer \"Amen\" to become part of it.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if the mavdil (person making havdallah) interrupted between the bracha and smelling the spices, the fact that everyone answered \"amen\" would be invalidated in your being motzi in the bracha, b/c the mavdil would have to make a new bracha, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, this is a bracha for which the action of the mavdil cannot exempt you from performing the same action. I.e. - it's not like Kiddush where you don't have to drink the wine, also to be yotzei Kiddush. You have to smell the besamim, yourself. Thus, if you answer \"amen\" to the candle's bracha, you have interrupted your besamim bracha, which means you would need to make your own. Had you not answered, \"Amen\", to the 2nd bracha, you'd be fine, except, possibly, if it takes a long time between the bracha and the time you smell the besamim. I don't know, offhand what that time limit is, but, in typical cases, unless you're at a huge \"Carlebach style\" Havdallah with hundreds of people, I don't think you'd exceed the time limit, anyway.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Being as it is a <em>birchas hanehenin</em> there is a definite hefsek and they were forbidden to smell without new bracha.\nsee שולחן או''ח ס' רטז and see משנה ברורה סיף א source is from גמרא ברכות דף מג that states just like one must make a blessing on food so to on a good smell.\nsee  שולחן ערוך ס'רו סיף ג that there must not be any interruption between the blessing and what you are making the blessing for (eat, drink, smell) </p>\n\n\n",

Similarly, the Meiri\n  quotes the gemara almost verbatim, and Rav Ovadiah Yosef (Shu\"t Yabi'a\n  Omer OC 5:36) proves that according to the Meiri, women should say the\n  short version:</p>\n  \n  <p>ומוכח דלקושטא דמילתא הוא, שהנשים מברכות בר' הלבנה בקיצור</p>\n  \n  <p>Yet, the minhag seems to have evolved that women do not say kiddush\n  levana</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Several reasons given in this article, but the two that makes most sense to me are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2) Maharam Shik (Shu\"t, OC #90) - When to say kiddush levana is based\n  upon figuring out the calendar, and this was a skill performed only by\n  men.</p>\n  \n  <p>4) Magen Avrohom (OC 296:11) - Has difficulty understanding (and\n  ultimately disagrees with) the Rama that women cannot make their own\n  havdalah, but should rather hear their husbands'.

Meyer presents this ostensible proclamation from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Four_Lands\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Va'ad Arba' Aratzos</em></a> in Hebrew and in Latin translation in his <em>Toledoth Immanuel</em> (1722, pp. <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=c9xjAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">73-74</a>), a cloying missionary screed against Judaism and rabbinic Jews. </p>\n\n<p>I don't have access to manuscripts of any real proclamations made at the <em>Va'ad</em>'s autumn assembly at Jarosław in 1631, but I doubt the authenticity of this proclamation on technical grounds:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>Va'ad</em> would <a href=\"http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4705-council-of-four-lands\" rel=\"noreferrer\">compose its proclamations in Yiddish</a>, not Hebrew. </li>\n<li>The Hebrew proclamation contains multiple linguistic oddities.</li>\n<li>It would be particularly odd to compose this proclamation in Hebrew, as the content of the proclamation regards how to mitigate the effect of hostile Christians who understand Hebrew. </li>\n<li>Meyer indicates that the assembly took place during Elul and Tishrei, but the autumn assemblies in the first half of the 17th century would actually end before Tishrei, presumably due to the holidays (as testified by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_ben_Moses_Hannover\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Nathan Hannover</a> in <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/history/tkufot/yon-2.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Yeven Metzula</em></a>, ch. 16, \"והיו יושבים בכל יריד לובלין בין בין פורים לפסח, ובכל יריד יערסלב בחודש אב או אלול\"). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is possible, if unlikely, that Meyer simply translated the Yiddish proclamation to Hebrew, and failed to mention that he was producing a translation. If so, this would not be the only instance of Jewish self-censorship in the Talmud. In 1508, Gershom Soncino printed a Talmud in Pesaro <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/loc/Early.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">with substantial lacunae</a>, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ESy1R-mnl6kC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">especially in tractate <em>'Avoda Zara</em></a>.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<p>William Popper (<em>The Censorship of Hebrew Books</em>, 1899. <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=XVYbAQAAMAAJ&pg=105#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pp. 105-106</a>) notes that censorship of the Talmud in Poland by non-Jewish authorities would be consistent with events at that time, but he uncritically takes for granted the authenticity of the 1631 proclamation calling for self-censorship.<sup>3</sup> </p>\n\n<p>In any case, I am unaware of any editions of the Talmud that replace text in those relevant parts with mysterious, unexplained symbols. If there was any self-censorship of the Talmud in Europe immediately after 1631, it was not very widespread or did not last very long. The 1644-1648 Benveniste printing of the Talmud in Amsterdam, for example, was <a href=\"https://www.kestenbaum.net/content.php?item=3294\" rel=\"noreferrer\">uncensored</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>Some later sources (e.g. <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=HJEkAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA134#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Bww_AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) inexplicably place the putative assembly at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotrk%C3%B3w_Trybunalski\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Petrikau</a>, which is a <a href=\"http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4705-council-of-four-lands\" rel=\"noreferrer\">very unlikely venue</a> for an assembly of the <em>Va'ad Arba' Aratzos</em> in the 1630's. </sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>It is noteworthy that the <em>signore</em> and vicariate of Pesaro, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Sforza\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Giovanni Sforza</a>, was a former son-in-law of a previous pope. He faced serious political and personal threat from the papacy and the Borgia family, and he was only able to eventually return to Pesaro by the imprimatur of Pope Julius II. Gershom Soncino may have been afraid to risk provoking the papacy, and by extension Sforza, by publishing an uncensored Talmud.</sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> <sub>Strangely, Popper cites an even more rabidly antisemitic source for this proclamation: <em>Théorie du Judaïsme</em> (1830. <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=FjO8p1-1UDUC&pg=PA161#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pp. 161-165</a>) by <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=WigEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA104#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Luigi Chiarini</a>.</sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are no circles like that in a Gemara for censored passages, so I'd probably weigh the reliability of the rest of the information on that website with little credence.</p>\n\n<p>There <em>is</em> censorship of the Gemara over the course of many centuries. Scholars have reconstructed the censored passages and the result is a very slim book that contains only a folio page or two's worth of content, most of which was censored not because it dealt with Christian religious figures, but because people construed it as dealing with them incorrectly. (In comparison to the Vilna edition's 20 folio volumes that have more writing in them than the Encyclopedia Britannica.) </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara, even when uncensored, talks about the religion of Christianity and any of its major figures very little, and has little to say that is relevant to a Christian in this regard. By the time it enters the historical scene, it is after the Gemara is being written in far-away Babylonia which was at the time a Zoastrian country, it was a religion of the gentiles of the Roman empire, far away from the authors of the Gemara and far from their concerns of Jewish law and lore. The Mishnah, which was written when Christianity began in Israel, doesn't even mention it at all in any form, censored or not. Thus like most gentile religions it concerns our Rabbis as much as, l'havdil, a minister is concerned with Buddha.</p>\n\n\n",

Today, <em>aniyei ircha</em> are the people with whom you associate, with whom you have a <em>kesher</em>. There are so many shuls in New York, but I don’t <em>daven</em> in all of them.

While\n  the latter are allowed to slaughter for a Jew, if they are being\n  adequately supervised, the Karaites are not. The Karaites who lived at\n  the time of the Simlah Chadashah, did not accept the oral laws, even\n  those pertaining to shechitah. As a result they were not considered to\n  be בר זביחה and that which they slaughtered is neveilah. Once a\n  person is not a ‫בר זביחה‬ the meat this person slaughtered is\n  forbidden regardless of the level of certification. The meat is\n  neveilah even if every action of this person were observed to be\n  correct and the knife was inspected prior to the shechitah and found\n  to be perfect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is the above quote accurate? How do Karaites slaughter animals to avoid the prohibitions of <em>neveilah</em> נבילה (Deut. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9978#v=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">14:21</a>) and <em>treifah</em> טריפה (Ex. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9883#v=30\" rel=\"nofollow\">22:30</a>)?<br>\n<strong>Question 2:</strong> How would a Karaite explain Deut. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9976#v=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">12:21</a>, \"וזבחת...כאשר צויתיך\" \"and you shall slaughter...how I commanded you\" -- where is that צווי if it was not written down anywhere in the Torah?</p>\n\n<p><hr>\n* <em>Because it is written (Deut. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9976#v=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">12:21</a>) \"וזבחת...כאשר צויתיך\" \"and you shall slaughter...how I commanded you.\" The problem is that there is no mention of a method of slaughter recorded anywhere in Tanach.

Indeed there are many requirements laid down in the Talmud as to the \"proper\" way of killing an animal; however, these are the customs of those writing the Talmud rather than the laws of God. The most misleading aspect of the claim that this passage refers to an alleged Oral Law is that it ignores the context of the passage. Not more than 5 verses earlier we see that the Torah itself dictates how we are to slaughter animals: \"Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it upon the earth like water\" (Deuteronomy 12:16). From this, we learn that to properly slaughter an animal we must do it in a manner that pours its blood on the ground — as opposed to letting it harden in the veins of the slaughtered animal (e.g. by strangulation). This reading is confirmed by the lines directly succeeding the verse in question: \"Only be sure that you eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and you may not eat the life with the meat..\" (Deuteronomy 12:23). In fact, this verse states that the only requirement of slaughter is that we do not eat the blood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Prof. Adam Zertal and a team of archaeologists from\n  the University of Haifa are working on the hypothesis that this is the\n  site of biblical Gilgal.</p>\n  \n  <p>The large cave was discovered by Prof. Adam Zertal and a team from the\n  University of Haifa which has been conducting a survey of the region\n  since 1978. “When we reached the entrance to the cave, two Bedouin\n  approached us and warned us not to go in, because it was cursed and\n  inhabited by wolves and hyenas,” Zertal said yesterday from the site.</p>\n  \n  <p>They entered anyway, discovering a ceiling supported by 22 gigantic\n  columns on which various symbols were carved, including 31 crosses, a\n  possible wheel of the Zodiac and a Roman legionary symbol. The columns\n  also had niches for the placement of oil lamps and holes that\n  apparently served as hitching posts.</p>\n  \n  <p>Potsherds found in the cave and the carvings on the columns led Zertal\n  to date the first quarrying of the cave to around the beginning of the\n  Common Era. It was used mainly as a quarry for 400 to 500 years, “but\n  other finds give the impression it was used for other purposes,\n  perhaps a monastery or even a hiding place,” Zertal said.</p>\n  \n  <p>Zertal said scholars wondered why people would dig a quarry\n  underground considering the effort needed just to pull the stones out\n  of the ground.</p>\n  \n  <p>A possible answer may be in the famous Madaba Map of ancient\n  Palestine, found in Jordan. In it, a place named Galgala is marked and\n  an accompanying Greek word meaning “12 stones.” The map also depicts a\n  church near the site. Archaeologists say they have found two ancient\n  churches near the cave.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Zertal, scholars had always assumed that “12 stones”\n  referred to the biblical story of the 12 stones the Israelites set up\n  at Gilgal after they crossed the Jordan. However, the discovery of the\n  quarried cave may mean the reference was to a quarry established where\n  the Byzantines identified Gilgal. Zertal explains that in antiquity\n  sanctuaries were built out of stones from sacred places.</p>\n  \n  <p>The inscription reads “Galgala, also the twelve stones.” Below the\n  inscription is a small church with its entrance hidden by a long\n  structure with 12 white spots on it (two rows of six). The Madaba map\n  is dated to about A.D. 560 to 565</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can't access some of the links and images on this web page, and, in any case, the article suggests a possibility, rather than anything definitive.

You may want to reword your question.  Throughout Jewish history and up until the present, Aramaic targumim have been recited in the synagogue alongside the traditional Hebrew Torah.  Currently the Jews of Yemen read from Targum Onkelos during the Torah reading.  However, the practice of solely reading from a scroll written in a language other than Hebrew, such as Aramaic or Greek, was never common practice.  There are many reasons for this, a few of which are given below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Talmud [Sotah 33] discusses praying in Aramaic instead of Hebrew and states that the angels do not understand Aramaic.  The message here is that Hebrew is preferable over Aramaic since it allows the person reciting it to have a closer connection to heaven.</li>\n<li>This notion is further reinforced by the practice שנים מקרא ואחד תרגום [Berakhot 8a].  This is referring to the practice of twice reading the weekly Torah portion in Hebrew with the congregation, while reading once from the Targum.</li>\n<li>There is a general concept in Rabbinic writings that Hebrew is the holy language in which the Torah was given to Moses on Mount Sinai.  Therefore, as a general rule we should be using Hebrew over any other language.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Well, I have a semi-personal connection with Rabbi Chaim Richman of the Temple Institute in Jerusalem, and when he was down here in my town visiting, I asked him the same question. Basically, he told me that when Rabbi Gamliel II says a Torah scroll can be written in Greek, it does not mean that a Torah written in Greek is kosher for use in shul, public reading, etc. What it means is that Greek is the only language the Torah can be accurately translated into, since Greek shares the same expressions and influctions as Hebrew. As a studious Hebrew and Ancient Greek learner, I know this for a fact. Greek and Hebrew are extremely similar in grammar! I know this isn't what you were asking, but what I'm meaning to say is - Aramaic is also very close in relation to Hebrew. So Aramaic makes a good targum language, but doesn't mean it can make a kosher Sefer Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

That's because all sacrifice must be in the temple and once the temple is build it'll be too impractical to go to (or fly to/wait till rebuilding of) the temple first to sacrifice every time a jew wants to eat steak.</p>\n\n<p>Here God uses gazelle and deers as samples. You don't sacrifice them, but you can eat them because they are kosher.</p>\n\n<p>However, even though gazelle and deers are kosher, jews don't hunt anyway and hence, jews at that time most likely don't eat gazelle and deers per question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/29933/can-jews-eat-hunted-animals\">Can Jews eat hunted animals?</a></p>\n\n<p>So why God pick deer and gazelle as samples because jews don't eat them anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Here, I presume that deer and gazelle are hunted animals. They may be trapped but that's more of theoretical possibility.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Leviticus Ch. 1 makes it clear that the only mammals available as sacrifices were cattle, sheep, and goats. So as soon as the Torah said (a few chapters later into Leviticus) that \"deer and gazelle are kosher animals\", that meant you could eat them (by trapping and slaughtering them) without them being sacrifices. Yes they're wild, so they're a bit inconvenient to kill in a kosher way, but not at all impossible.</p>\n\n<p>During the time in the desert, the <em>only</em> way you could have kosher beef or lamb was if you brought it to the portable Temple as a sacrifice (they'd burn some of the fats and give you plenty of meat to eat). Moses is saying when they enter the land of Israel they can have kosher beef that's non-sacrificial -- <em>just like kosher venison was non-sacrificial since Day 1.</em></p>\n\n\n",

As an example, everyone being included should preferably stand (Mishna Berura 592:2), and if a man is blowing for a woman, the woman should make her own blessing.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I have done this several times in the past. In viewing the Mishnah Brurah, now, I discovered several things that I was unaware of. As there are many laws regarding blowing / hearing the shofar, what I am providing may be a partial list, only:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>589:3 - a woman is exempt from hearing the shofar b/c it is a time bound mitzvah. The mechaber states that they should not make a bracha and others should not make one for them.</li>\n<li>Magen Avraham (see Mishnah Brurah par. 11) states that one should not blow during the 1st 3 hours of the day. There are other caveats mentioned there, as well, that I couldn't quite decipher (sorry.)</li>\n<li>Regarding standing, the only item I noticed was something about the person blowing the shofar should stand. As for the congregation, in actuality, the shofar blowing that precedes Musaph is called \"teki'ot dimeyushav\" - \"blasts of SITTING\" to contrast this with \"Tki'ot d'meumad\" - blasts of standing which refers to the blasts done during Shmoneh Esreh (b/c people stand for Shmoneh Esreh.) Sefardim do teki'ot during the silent Amidah as well as the chazan's repition, but in both forms, people should stand, there. Apparently, standing for the blasts prior to Musaph, has become an accepted minhag - I have to locate the source for that; don't recall, offhand, where I saw this.</li>\n<li>An individual at home should not have the blasts done in the middle of his Shemonah Esreh, but rather should wait to hear them after he is finsished. Also, he cannot hear shofar blasts until after he has said Shemoneh Esreh - see 592:2 and 594:1.</li>\n<li>From my understanding of 585:5, the use of a \"makri\" - someone who announces the order of the blasts is primarily for the Shat\"z, so that he does not become confused. However, the commentaries, there, state, that if he is confident that he would not become confused, he does not need a \"makri\". I am devising a \"kal vachomer\" that if this is said about the Shat\"z, who is performing 2 tasks, and there is a leniency for him, than someone who is NOT a Shat\"z does not require a \"makri\" either in shul or when blowing privately, if he will not be confused. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In shul, I have had a \"mix\". (I am not the shat\"z for Musaph, BTW). The makri has been present at the beginning of the blowing (the first 30), but since we have 2 concurrent minyanim, he tends to disappear and be the makri at the other minyan. (Don't ask me why he never returned to us, later. Personally, I think he went home, as the other minyan finished long before us.) I did the remaining blasts without a makri, and I was not confused (other than why the makri didn't reappear :-) At the person's home, there was no makri.</p>\n\n<p>Other than these, I didn't notice any significant differences between what happens in home vs. in shul. Again, I may have missed something buried in the commentaries, so check them, again.</p>\n\n<p>When I have done shofar blowing in someone's home, it has usually been after shul is finished and after I have blown shofar in shul. I am quite exhausted, so I have taken the leniency to sound 30 blasts, and if I'm really tired or the person I'm blowing for is too frail or impatient (True story - one year, a woman died 3 hours after I had left her home from blowing shofar for her. When the rav in my shul heard this story, he jokingly said that my shofar blowing killed her! Weird incident... can't make this up!) I blow just 10 blasts to fulfill the Torah commandment.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi David Zvi Hoffman\n  (1843-1921), the rector of the famous Hildesheimer yeshivah, explains\n  the evolution of this prohibition in his responsa Melamed Leho'il\n  (first part, Orah? H?ayim, chapter 16). He writes that the Rabbinic\n  Court in Hamburg published a series of letters by different halakhic\n  authorities under the name of Eleh Divrei Habrit in 1819 in which they\n  all prohibited playing musical instruments (particularly the organ) in\n  the synagogue even if the instruments were played by a non Jew. This\n  was a reaction against the Reform synagogues' custom of playing\n  instruments during services.</p>\n  \n  <p>He notes that the halakhic authorities were not clear about playing\n  musical instruments on weekdays. Some of them did not address the\n  issue and might have allowed it, while others permitted playing\n  instruments during weekday services. Other authorities cited\n  definitely prohibited this practice.   Noting that Jews are not\n  permitted to follow Gentile practices, in 1820, Rabbi Abraham\n  Lowenstein, the head of Emden's rabbinic court, prohibited playing an\n  organ in the synagogue on Shabbat, Holidays and weekdays because we\n  are not permitted to follow the Gentiles ways. </p>\n  \n  <p>Beginning in 1863, many rabbis relied upon this proscription, and in\n  fact the Hildsheimer Yeshivah in Berlin ordained rabbis on the\n  condition that they would not serve in synagogues with organs (in any\n  service. Organs were singled out as both churches and Reform\n  synagogues used this instrument).   Rabbi Hoffman asserts that the\n  musical instruments in the Temple were not like the organ. Moreover,\n  he noted that the organ used in the Al Tnai synagogue in Prague was\n  played before Shabbat started.   He provides three explanations for\n  prohibiting instruments at synagogue services:  a) Not to follow the\n  Gentile practice  b) Not to follow the heretics' ways  c) Not to\n  forget our grieving for the Temple's destruction</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My added commentary - Shlomo Carlebach often played his guitar during Havdallah in the shul. <a href=\"/q/66379\">I've asked elsewhere about this.</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are Bikkurim and burial different from each other?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In this week's parsha we read about the mitzvah of Bikkurim. The Torah tells us to bring our first fruits of the season to the Beit Hamikdash, and offer it to the Kohanim. We are also told that the people would bring the fruits in baskets. The Sifri explains that there was a practice for the wealthy to bring their fruits in baskets overlaid with gold or silver, while the poor would use woven baskets. This would ostensibly show their love for the mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>However one could ask a question on this practice: We often find that the Rabbis would regulate standards in regards to mitzvah practices that could differentiate between the poor and wealthy. For example, the Gemara in Moed Katan (27a-b) tells us that the original custom was for the wealthy to bury their dead in fancy and expensive caskets, however this caused the poor to be embarrassed, thus the Chazal enacted that everyone be buried in simple caskets. Seemingly, the minhag for the wealthy to use gold and silver laden baskets would also embarrass the poor. If so, why didn't the Chazal regulate this practice as well?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I would venture to say that it's date related.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>shrouds enactment</em> was <em>enshrined</em> by Rabban Gamliel \"עד שבא רבן גמליאל ונהג קלות ראש בעצמו ויצא בכלי פשתן ונהגו העם אחריו לצאת בכלי פשתן\". I'm not sure which  Rabban Gamliel, but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamaliel_(disambiguation)\" rel=\"nofollow\">it seems</a> that the first  Rabban Gamliel lived close to the destruction of the 2nd Temple.</p>\n\n<p>By then it was <em>too late</em> to institute Bikkurim-related decrees. IIRC by then there was little agriculture going on and most people were living in Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<p>If that is true, then we could assume that until then people were buried <em>on the family farm</em>. It was only once they congregated into cities that <em>public burials</em> became a <em>fashion show</em> and an issue.</p>\n\n<p>While searching for a proof - which I have not found - I discovered that the Ikkar Tosfos YomTov asks  this very question and answers that the expensive vessels were an honor for the Temple, and the honor of the Temple takes precedence over people's potential embarrassment.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>עיקר תוי\"ט</strong>  {יב} ערבה קלופה. נצרים הם ענפים או שבטים. כמו ונצר משרשיו יפרה (ישעיה י''א). ופירוש קליפה שמסירין קליפתה תרגום מחשוף הלבן קליף. הר''מ: {יג} וק''ל דאי הכי <strong>עניים מתביישים ולמה לא תקנו כדי שלא יתביישו העניים שאף העשירים יביאו בנצרים</strong> כמו <strong>שמצינו בכמה מקומות. וי''ל</strong> משום כבוד בית אלהינו ומשרתיו לא חשו על שיתביישו העניים. תוי''ט:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See the Malbim on the sifri</p>\n\n<p>Malbim, in his commentary here in Parashat Ki-Savo (26:4), explains that since the kohanim had to eat the bikkurim in a state of ritual purity, the farmers would need to bring brand new utensils to bring their first fruits, to ensure that the fruit remain ritually pure.  The poor farmers would weave their own baskets, whereas the wealthier ones purchased utensils for this purpose.  Malbim says that because it was made by their own hands, they were honored that their handiwork was used for the mitzvah. </p>\n\n<p>My own addition: And as @ray pointed out, the fact that the wicker baskets were left by the kohanim, while the rich would bring theirs back, would seem to indicate the \"chavivus\" of the Hashem to the handiwork of the poor.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>My take -- there's less shame in seeing that this year, so-and-so can afford nice baskets and so-and-so can't, because people's fortunes can change. Maybe next year will be different.</p>\n\n<p>But you only get one chance to be buried. For something that final, we make it all equal.</p>\n\n<p>Another possible distinction -- bringing a cheap basket means \"<em>I</em> can't afford a pricey one.\" Whereas Raban Gamliel's enactment was concerned with people who couldn't dress <em>their loved ones</em> in fancy clothes (and would therefore just dump the body). \"I can't afford a nice basket\", eh whatever. \"I couldn't afford anything nice to bury my mother\", that was seen as a real shame. </p>\n\n<p>(And of course you can put the two ideas together. \"I can't afford something pricey for myself this year\", vs. \"I can't afford final honors for my parent/spouse.\")</p>\n\n\n",

In earlier times (and in some places even today) you can't really do that (even if there are enough people living there to support it).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Tashlumin has to be <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/8/108/7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">specifically connected</a> to a time of obligatory prayer, and follow it in reasonably short order. This seems to imply that praying with a second minyan would be a contradiction to this idea.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Tashlumin is a special request for mercy outside of an obligation, so it is more comparable to a Tefilas Nedava, in that it is not something congregational.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above facts, my answer would be no, there is no reason to specifically go looking for a Minyan, and it doesn't count as a group praying together.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I've done the following (though now I cannot recall who advised me to do so):</p>\n\n<p>Daven the regular Tefillah (silent Shemoneh 'Esreh) with the Minyan, and then do Tashlumin during the repetition.(Point 1)  This follows from the idea that there are two requirements of Tefillah/Tzibbur - one is <strong>Tefillah BETZIBUR</strong> (praying WITH the congregation), which is fulfilled by praying in sync with the congregation, and one is <strong>Tefillath HATZIBUR</strong> (praying OF the congregation), which is usually fulfilled by the Shaliah Tzibur in the repetition, but which can be fulfilled by anyone who prays in sync with him.(Point 2) I have also heard this latter idea in the name of R' JB Soloveitchik, though I've no idea when/where he said it, along with the idea that if you miss <strong>Tefillah BETZIBUR</strong> you should at least attempt to fulfill <strong>Tefillath HATZIBUR</strong> immediately following.(Point 3)</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the unknown-origin idea (first point above) appears to me to be an extension of the unknown-origin-Rav idea (second/third points above).</p>\n\n<p>It's not clear to me if the first idea actually is preferable or not, and I can see reasons to advise for/against it.</p>\n\n\n",

I think it might be a sneaky case of nasog achor because Lo is a one syllable word.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Mechon Mamre <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0529.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">has</a> the kadma modifying the 'yod' of <em>yom</em>, as does the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo_Codex\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aleppo Codex</a>, as seen in this screenshot taken by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/759/double-aa\">DoubleAA</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9vY3w.png\" alt=\"\"*Hayom lo*\" in the Allepo Codex \"></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Actually, I am looking at my print out of the Trope Trainer (overall, I like it - so much easier to shlep a few sheets during my daily commute), and the kadma is at the very end of the letter heh, just before the yud of the word yom. The correct pronunciation is as you suspected - on the 2nd syllable - yom. If you placed in on the 1st syllable, it may sound like a question (the \"Heh Hashe'ela concept), which is not the idea, here.</p>\n\n<p>I can see where you would get confused. While Trope trainer is usually accurate, I have seen various errors crop up. I noticed that some things may also depend on your printer translating some fonts and such. For example, a Kri / Ktiv problem appears as giant bold letters on my HP 6700 printer. My previous HP 4775 printer didn't do this. (Go figure! I may email the Trope trainer author / developer and ask him about this problem.) I also noticed that sometimes, in the Tikkun column, the letters get squeezed, so sometimes I can't tell where words really end. Fortunately, after laining for so long, I have pretty much memorized the Torah, so I can figure it out. But, I can see where a novice can get confused - not that I'm suggesting that you're a novice :-)</p>\n\n<p>Re the \"nasog achor\" - interesting theory, and I have to review the rules, again. But, I noticed that there is a psik between \"hayom\" and \"lo\" - something I don't expect, here. I wonder if the reason for that psik is to \"cancel\" the nasog achor?</p>\n\n\n",

This is the opinion of R. Menashe Klein (Mishnah Halakhos 6:277), R. Zalman Nechemiah Goldberg (heard from someone who heard it directly), R. Zvi Pesach Frank (Sheelos UTeshuvos Y.D. 126, see also Zeraim 2:43), R. Shternbach (I assume, based on what he says regarding chametz on Pesach in Moadim UZmanim 1:54), and Rav Asher Weiss (Sh\"t 1:105-106)</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Minchas Yitzchak (1:3, 4:1) says that corporations with any Jewish shareholders are subject to Jewish laws, but probably not biblically, and this appears to also be the view of R. Yitzchak Ahron Ettinger (Shut Mahari Halevi 2:124). Maharshag (Shut Y.D. 3) goes even further, and says that all of the shareholders are no worse than partners in ownership, and therefore all the laws of ownership - including Biblical prohibitions - would apply, even if there's only one Jewish shareholder. </p>\n\n<p>Some might say that there's a difference if the Jew is merely a shareholder, or a controlling shareholder in that he would have a say in how the corporation's business is run. This may be the opinion of R. Moshe (Igros Moshe Y.D. II:63) but I'm not so sure</p>\n\n\n",

This could mean that Moshe did indeed show the Bnei Yisrael all of the animals, including the ones mentioned above. However, not all animals are mentioned in the Torah, probably because listing all kosher and non-kosher animals would occupy an unnecessarily large part of the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.42a.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 42a</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מלמד שתפס הקב\"ה מכל מין ומין והראה לו למשה ואמר לו זאת אכול וזאת לא\n  תיכל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Did Moshe hold up all animals in world or just those relevant or mentioned in the Torah (I'm not sure if it is clear from the Gemara and Rashi)?</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the Torah mentions animals that are found only in and around Israel to make this passage relevant to the readers of the Torah. However it seems like the Ramban quoted above extends this to 'בעולם'. I am unaware that בעולם is ever used to only mean Israel. </p>\n\n<p>In light of this, how do we understand the Ramban given that there are indeed many other animals, outside Israel and the region, that posses only one kosher siman?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems to me that despite Double AA's saying that Min in the Torah is very narrow, according to Pirkei D'rav Eliezer, it is very broad:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hence thou mayest learn that there were 366 kinds of cattle [animals in this context] on the earth, and 366 kinds of fowl on the earth, and 366 kinds of reptiles on the earth, for thus was (the number) in the lowest compartment, so in the second compartment, and so in the third floor, as it is said, \"With lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it\" (Gen. 6:16). (Pirkei D'rabbi Eliezer 23)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus if there is only 366 kinds of animals on the earth, it's obvious that camel and llamas are the same min, and the same with piccaries and pig. </p>\n\n<p>A further proof to this is that there are only 10 kosher species according to the way the Rambam understands this gemara, yet we know there are far more. The same with kosher birds and unkosher birds. Hence, the definition of species must be pretty huge. </p>\n\n<p>(Thus the Shafan must be the hyrax, as if it were the rabbit, it's hard to imagine the rabbit and the hare are not the same min.)</p>\n\n<p>In regards to kilayim, we are forced to say that Kilayim isn't dependedant on the large definition of min, but on whether they can interbreed, hence it must use a narrower definition of min.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore this statement is brought to show that learning the halachos of meseches Niddah itself is what brings a person to Olam Habah.  (The Maharsha there explains how he knows this statement of learning halachos refers to halachos of Niddah which were made obsolete by Rebbi Zeira's stringency.)  There is an intrinsic value to learning Torah.</p>\n\n<p>R' Moshe Feinstein in Igros Moshe Orech Chaim 1:20 explains that this was the mistake of the generation in which the Mikdash was destroyed - they did not make a blessing on learning Torah (Eicha Rabba) - which means they did not relate to learning Torah as a mitzvah in its own right, but only as a means to knowing what to do.  They failed to see the intrinsic value in learning Torah.</p>\n\n<p>On a separate note, when I was in Ner Israel, my Rebbe was often asked why we don't learn things that are practical.  He explained that if you are learning Gemara and it doesn't become practical, you aren't learning it correctly.  If you think learning Gemara is one discussion, and learning the halacha is a separate discussion, you haven't learned either properly.  You cannot fully appreciate the Rambam, or Shulchan Aruch, or wherever your halacha is coming from, if you do not know the ins and outs of the sugya in the Gemara.  Learning Gemara is a necessary step in learning the halacha, and just perusing the Mishna Berura does not give you a true understanding of the subject at hand.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<h2><strong>1) Inculcating Toil</strong></h2>\n<p>Gemara study does not just represent a new concentrated degree of learning, the intricacies contained within its pages, usher the onset of heightened עמילות – toil.</p>\n<p>The Chofetz Chaim (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33083&st=&pgnum=36&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Toras HaBayis, maamar 'Elbona shel Torah\"</a>) explains in length that this עמילות inspires an unparalleled level of דביקות - closeness to Hashem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יסוד אומתינו ויסוד תקנת איש יהודי נאמן לאלקיו להשאיר בנו אחריו דבוק בד' תורתו ואשר לא תהיה זאת רק מלימוד הגמרא בעמל ויגיעה שבדבוקתם בקדושתה באורה ובכבודה</p>\n<p>The foundation of our nation and the foundation of perfecting a Jewish man faithful to his G-d is to leave his son behind him clinging to his Torah, and this is only from studying the Gemara with toil and effort and it will come that you cling to it in its holiness in its light and honour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Building on this point - it is worth taking a look at Rav Yitzchok Hutner's Pachad Yitzchok on Shavuos (17:1). He notes there Rambam's advice in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Torah_Study.1.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Torah 1:11</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְחַיָּב לְשַׁלֵּשׁ אֶת זְמַן לְמִידָתוֹ. שְׁלִישׁ בַּתּוֹרָה שֶׁבִּכְתָב. וּשְׁלִישׁ בַּתּוֹרָה שֶׁבְּעַל פֶּה. וּשְׁלִישׁ יָבִין וְיַשְׂכִּיל אַחֲרִית דָּבָר מֵרֵאשִׁיתוֹ וְיוֹצִיא דָּבָר מִדָּבָר וִידַמֶּה דָּבָר לְדָבָר וְיָבִין בַּמִּדּוֹת שֶׁהַתּוֹרָה נִדְרֶשֶׁת בָּהֶן עַד שֶׁיֵּדַע הֵיאַךְ הוּא עִקַּר הַמִּדּוֹת וְהֵיאַךְ יוֹצִיא הָאָסוּר וְהַמֻּתָּר וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶן מִדְּבָרִים שֶׁלָּמַד מִפִּי הַשְּׁמוּעָה. וְעִנְיָן זֶה הוּא הַנִּקְרָא גְּמָרָא</p>\n<p>A person is obligated to divide his study time in three: one third should be devoted to the Written Law; one third to the Oral Law; and one third to understanding and conceptualizing the ultimate derivation of a concept from its roots, inferring one concept from another and comparing concepts, understanding [the Torah] based on the principles of Biblical exegesis, until one appreciates the essence of those principles and how the prohibitions and the other decisions which one received according to the oral tradition can be derived using them. The latter topic is called Gemara. (Sefaria translation and notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam continues in the subsequent halacha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בַּמֶּה דְּבָרִים אֲמוּרִים בִּתְחִלַּת תַּלְמוּדוֹ שֶׁל אָדָם אֲבָל כְּשֶׁיַּגְדִּיל בְּחָכְמָה וְלֹא יְהֵא צָרִיךְ לֹא לִלְמֹד תּוֹרָה שֶׁבִּכְתָב וְלֹא לַעֲסֹק תָּמִיד בַּתּוֹרָה שֶׁבְּעַל פֶּה יִקְרָא בְּעִתִּים מְזֻמָּנִים תּוֹרָה שֶׁבִּכְתָב וְדִבְרֵי הַשְּׁמוּעָה כְּדֵי שֶׁלֹּא יִשְׁכַּח דָּבָר מִדִּבְרֵי דִּינֵי תּוֹרָה <strong>וְיִפְנֶה כָּל יָמָיו לַגְּמָרָא בִּלְבַד לְפִי רֹחַב שֶׁיֵּשׁ בְּלִבּוֹ וְיִשּׁוּב דַּעְתּוֹ</strong></p>\n<p>The above applies in the early stages of a person's study. However, when a person increases his knowledge and does not have the need to read the Written Law, or occupy himself with the Oral Law constantly, he should study the Written Law and the oral tradition at designated times. Thus, he will not forget any aspect of the laws of the Torah. <strong>[However,] he should focus his attention on the Gemara alone for his entire life, according to his ambition and his ability to concentrate.</strong> (Sefaria translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Hutner builds off the Rambam to make the following point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הרי לנו דעצם עצמיותה של תורה הוא רק לימוד גמרא, וכל מהלכי הלימוד הם כמו הדרך המוביל אל המטרה. וזהו חידוש נפלא, דבעצם עצמיותו של תלמוד תורה אין אנו דנים על כל חלקיו בהשואה אחת. אלא דהכל נידון בערכין. ובערכה של תורה, כל המהלכים מלבד תלמוד גמרא כמכשיר הם נידונים</p>\n<p>After all, for us, the essence of Torah's identity is only the study of Gemara, and from all the approaches to learning they are like the road leading to the ultimate goal (i.e. learning gemara). And this is a wondrous chiddush, since the very nature of Talmud Torah is such that we do not discuss all its parts equally. Rather, everything is judged on its merits. And with the value of Torah, all approaches other than the learning of Gemara are considered part of the preparation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, Rav Hutner tells us that all our other Torah learning is to be regarded as a means to get to the end goal, which is purely that of Gemara study. Now why is it regarded as the ultimate aim? Rav Hutner continues that it inspires a greater sense of toil. This toil that is so part of Gemara study is not to be deemed as added value but rather  represents the very definition of Torah study.</p>\n<p>In 17:5 Rav Hutner notes that Rambam defines the learning of Gemara as the final third  (as this is the final piece that everyone should be building up to) as understanding and conceptualising the derivation of a concept from its roots, inferring one concept from another and comparing concepts. As such:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוא עיקר מקומו של השכל העמל בהתבוננות העיון לעומקו ולהקיפו של ענין, בהתאמצו להוציא דבר מתוך דבר</p>\n<p>It is the main place of the intellect that toils in the observation of the study to the depth and scope of a matter, in an effort to extract something from something.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the more regularly we do this, the more ingrained it becomes in our thinking process, thereby refining our ability to probe Torah thought as well as enhancing the breadth of our Torah knowledge.</p>\n<h2><strong>2) Foundational Building Blocks</strong></h2>\n<p>Rav Aharon Kotler זצ\"ל in <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/21343/p/1/t/0.63243860969848041234/fs/0/start/0/end/0/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnas Rebbi Aharon, cheilek gimmel</a>, shaar asiri, p. 168 asserts that the study of גמרא must be emphasised as it concretises a person’s basic ידיעת התורה – knowledge of Torah, and it must already be firmly introduced from a an appropriate age because it plays such an important part of further study in a person’s life.</p>\n<p>In this vein, it is worth bringing the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.60b.6?lang=bi&with=HaKtav%20VeHaKabalah%7CQuoting&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 60b</a> which notes the primacy that Torah sheba'al peh is afforded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן לֹא כָּרַת הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא בְּרִית עִם יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶלָּא בִּשְׁבִיל דְּבָרִים שֶׁבְּעַל פֶּה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר כִּי עַל פִּי הַדְּבָרִים הָאֵלֶּה כָּרַתִּי אִתְּךָ בְּרִית וְאֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, made a covenant with the Jewish people only for the sake of the matters that were transmitted orally [be’al peh], as it is stated: “For on the basis of [al pi] these matters I have made a covenant with you and with Israel” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.27?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 34:27</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, whilst Torah Shebichsav represents the written word of G-d, the Oral Torah is to be understood as the process and application of His word, that Hashem gifted uniquely to us. It is the means through which the Rabbonim throughout the ages, as well as each and everyone of us throughout the generations have the ability to attach ourselves to in order to gain a greater foothold of understanding and that is why it is prioritised.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the Ksav VeHakabbalah on the pasuk quoted in the gemara there puts it best:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ביאור הדבר שהיה נפלא ומכוסה ונעלם הידיעה, והיא התורה שבעל פה המסורה לנו לבאר התורה שבכתב</p>\n<p>The explanation of the matter is wondrous and covered up, and the knowledge is concealed, and the Oral Torah was given to us in order to explain the Written Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>3) Acceptance of G-d's Kingship</strong></h2>\n<p>When delving deeper into the piece from Gittin 60b above, I came across this  <a href=\"https://dafdigest.org/masechtos/Gittin%20060.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> which provides yet another reason why the learning of Gemara is emphasised above that of other Torah learning.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Pinchas Koretzer, zt”l, gave another reason. “If Hashem had chosen to commit the oral Torah to writing, we would not be able to say any more than what was written down, just as one may not add or subtract to scripture. This would be very detrimental, since <strong>the only way to truly master the intricacies of oral Torah is to speak in learning and review the material\nin an individualized way. With each review, it gets clearer and clearer to the learner. This is why the Tikunei Zohar teaches that the oral Torah is an aspect of accepting Malchus Hashem. The difficult process of mastering the oral Torah is how we truly accept Hashem’s Kingship over us!</strong>”</p>\n<p>(אמרי פנחס, שער התורה, מ\"ג)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In truth you can't necessarily pasken directly from Halacha seforim either.

On one such occasion, the neighbor called him over and told him a story:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>There were two Jews arguing over a bit of land. They went to the rabbi, who heard their case and said that it was a very difficult case and he would have to ask the land for its adjudication. They went to the land, and he put his ear to it. Then he told the litigants: \"You say 'the land is mine' and you say 'the land is mine', but the land says 'in just a short while they will both be mine'.\"</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>The Italian neighbor concluded: \"And do you know where I heard that story?

A din Torah, litigation between two\n  disputants, once took place in Volozhin, and its venerable Av Bais\n  Din, Horav Chaim Volozhiner, zl, presided over the proceedings.

The litigants accompanied\n  the Rav to the land that seemed to obsess each of these men. The Rav\n  bent down to the ground, placing his ear directly on it, as if he was\n  listening for something. It must have looked quite strange to see the\n  venerable gadol hador, preeminent Torah leader of the generation,\n  resting his ear on the ground. A few moments went by, and Rav Chaim\n  arose, and said, \"Gentlemen, I wanted to hear what the actual ground\n  had to say concerning your disagreement.

However, the Yalkut Shimoni says explicitly that Moshe did not cohabit with her because she was a descendant of Cham, and Moshe remembered the vow that Avraham had Eliezer take to not marry his child off to a descendant of Canaan.  Therefore, having a child with her would have been quite difficult.</p>\n\n<p>A translation of the relevant segment of Yalkut Shimoni, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/35807/did-moses-marry-twice/35834#35834\">courtesy of Gemini Man</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>they placed him on the throne and placed the royal crown on his head, and also the Cushite noble woman (the wife of the previous dead king, as it mentions earlier) they gave to him for a wife. But Moshe feared the God of his forefathers and did not sleep with her, because he remembered the oath which Avraham made his servant Eliezer swear, saying: Do not take a wife for my son from the daughters of Canaan. And so too did Yitzchok when Yaakov fled because of Eisav - he commanded him and said to him: Do not marry from the descendants of Ham, because we remember that God gave the descendants of Ham as servants to the descendants of Shem and to the descendants of Yefes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See it <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9757&st=&pgnum=102\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, on the right side column.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You have two questions regarding this tale.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is it true?</li>\n<li>If so, why isn't it mentioned in the Torah?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I will answer the second question first. This <em>is indeed</em> mentioned in the Torah. When Moshe names his son Gershom, he gives the following explanation<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0202.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> [Shemot 2:22]</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתֵּלֶד בֵּן, וַיִּקְרָא אֶת-שְׁמוֹ גֵּרְשֹׁם:  כִּי אָמַר--גֵּר הָיִיתִי, בְּאֶרֶץ נָכְרִיָּה</p>\n<p>And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said: 'I have been a stranger in a strange land.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This pasuk can also be translated as \"... for he said: I have been a stranger in the land of a Nochriah [gentile woman].'\"</p>\n<p>The land of a gentile woman would mean that the monarch is a queen, rather than a king. How do we know which land, and that he married that woman? Another pasuk <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0412.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> [Bemidbar 12:1]</a> states that he had married a Cushite, that is, Ethiopian, woman:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתְּדַבֵּר מִרְיָם וְאַהֲרֹן בְּמֹשֶׁה, עַל-אֹדוֹת הָאִשָּׁה הַכֻּשִׁית אֲשֶׁר לָקָח:  כִּי-אִשָּׁה כֻשִׁית, לָקָח.</p>\n<p>And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By putting two and two together, we get four, that this Ethiopian woman was the queen of Ethiopia, and Moshe had married her. Perhaps other details of the story come from other ambiguously phrased verses, or from logical deductions. For instance, Moshe's meteoric rise to power, from rags to riches, is based on the fact that he was at some point גֵּר הָיִיתִי, an unaccepted stranger, yet he eventually married the queen.</p>\n<p>However, we must admit that this is not mentioned <strong>explicitly</strong> in the Torah, but only alluded to. Why?</p>\n<p>This question has been asked before on Mi Yodea, why midrash is not in the Torah. For instance, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34367/why-is-midrash-not-in-the-torah\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>There are many possible answers. For instance, (a) it might be that the Torah is meant to be a multilayered document, with meaning on both the surface (peshat) level and the deeper (midrashic) level. And not everything can be on the surface, or the Torah would be a much longer text, without any deeper meaning to be dug out. (b) it might be that this was left out of the peshat narrative because it was not critical to the story. (c) it might be that this was some author, perhaps not even a member of Chazal, who filled the vacuum which was the missing years in Moshe's life, such that this story is not at all true. (d) it might be that Chazal intended this story homiletically, such that it is not historically true. Answers (c) and (d) would answer your first question in the negative.</p>\n<p>Rashbam, a pashtan, considers this story of marrying the Kushite queen to be historical, as well as the primary peshat of that verse in Bemidbar mentioned above.

    "content": "# Recommendation for good \"complete siddur\" (siddur shalem)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Friends,</p>\n\n<p>I am looking for a pocket-sized complete siddur (one that has weekday, Shabbat, holiday and High Holy Day prayers), and I am having trouble finding one. Complete siddurim seem to be hard to find. Does anyone have any thoughts on such a siddur?</p>\n\n<p>ETA: Fair enough :)  I'm looking for something in Hebrew and English (my Hebrew davening abilities can best be described as \"slight\"), either nusach Ashkenaz or Ari. I really like the idea of having everything right there in one book that I can have with me at all times. This is at least in part because the siddur with which I really became observant in my prayer does not have a corresponding machzor, so I never knew exactly which machzor I should get if I want one. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Artscroll's סידור יצחק יאיר is a good choice, as a good, complete <em>siddur</em> with a clear print. It is the standard <em>siddur</em> used in most <em>shuls</em>. You can buy them in practically any Jewish book store, or online (for example, <a href=\"http://zbermanbooks.com/?subcats=Y&status=A&pshort=Y&pfull=Y&pname=Y&pkeywords=Y&search_performed=Y&q=%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8%20%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7%20%D7%99%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8&dispatch=products.search\">here</a>). There is a pocket-sized edition of the <em>siddur</em>.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: this <em>siddur</em> is <em>nusach Ashkenaz</em>; the Artscroll <em>nusach Sefard</em> equivalent is the <a href=\"http://zbermanbooks.com/product-53414.html\">סידור תפילת שלמה</a>)</p>\n\n<p>These <em>siddurim</em> contain the prayers for weekday, Shabbos, <em>chagim</em>, fast days, as well as High Holy Day prayers.</p>\n\n<p>There are also English translations of these <em>siddurim</em> (with a running commentary), see <a href=\"http://artscroll.com/Books/9780899066509.html\">here</a> for an example of the older translation, and <a href=\"http://artscroll.com/Books/9781422609682.html\">here</a> for the newer English <em>siddur</em>, with an updated commentary.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I have not seen any all-inclusive siddur that includes everything you need - i.e. - every possible prayer for every day of the year including all the complete service (piyuttim) said for all the Rosh Hashannah and Yom Kippur prayers.</p>\n\n<p>If you have seen the \"combo\" Birnbaum Rosh Hashannah / Yom Kippur High Holiday machzor (no longer in print), it was hefty. As it is, Birnbaum's machzor made you flip pages back and forth, a lot esp. for Kol Nidre & Ne'ilah services.</p>\n\n<p>An all inclusive siddur would be so huge and hefty that you'd probably need a forklift to put it on the shtender :-) You'd have to have a pocket the size of Og's hand.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Birnbaum siddur comes with tefillot for practically the whole year. As it is out of print, I am unsure about finding a pocket-sized copy, although I have one at home so I know they exist. The only things I can think of which would need a separate volume are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Selichot (particularly for Yom Kippur)</li>\n<li>L'David Mizmor for Maariv (Rosh Hashannah and Yom Kippur)</li>\n<li>Poetry for the repetition of the Amidah</li>\n<li>Shir haMa'alot mimamakim (for 10 days and Hoshannah Rabbah)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

As with the healing of the body, if the physician administers powerful drugs, or if the physician must completely amputate a limb, would the patient plead to him that he shouldn't administer the drugs or amputate the limb? Lo, the patient himself has hired him for that reason; thusly, how can he pour out his heart/mind before him (blessed be His name) to remove from upon him the torments, for aren't they the bandage and the life-preserving drug to atone for his sins? And the sage (OBM) stated (Shabbos 58a): \"There are no torments without sin\", for if it weren't so, how, using what method, could the sinning Nefesh achieve atonement. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Paragraph Later)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As so too the individual, regarding his own suffering, even if there is no desecration of the name in the matter, there is an opening to supplicate Him regarding the large amount of supernal suffering that occurs when a person merits suffering in the lower world..\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When we go to a Rabbi for a Bracha about a particular situation, we are asking him to add his additional supplication for Hashem <em>about supernal suffering</em>.

It seems that אתה חוננתנו is not \"self-contained\", i.e. it is part of the larger bracha, which is part of Shmoneh Esrei; contrast with the bracha of ברוך המבדיל which is self-contained.</p>\n\n<p>A practical difference between them would be if the light goes out on a timer, and you are able to flip the switch - must it wait until you finish your Shmoneh Esrei, possibly causing trouble to other people davening? Alternately, the alarm on your watch beeps.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>These quote are all from Rambam's Mishne Torah, so it might be different according to other authorities. The first thing to determine is when Shabbat ends:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/3105.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow\">הלכות שבת פרק ה,ד</a></p>\n  \n  <p>משתשקע החמה עד שייראו שלושה כוכבים בינוניים, הוא הזמן הנקרא בין\n  השמשות בכל מקום; והוא ספק מן היום, ספק מן הלילה, ודנין בו להחמיר, בכל\n  מקום.  ולפיכך אין מדליקין בו; והעושה מלאכה בין השמשות שבת ובין השמשות\n  במוצאי שבת, בשוגג--חייב חטאת מכל מקום.  וכוכבים אלו--לא גדולים הנראים\n  ביום, ולא קטנים שאין נראין אלא בלילה; ומשייראו שלושה כוכבים אלו\n  הבינוניים, הרי זה לילה ודאי.</p>\n  \n  <p>From sundown till three medium stars are seen, is the time which is\n  called twilight in every place; and it is doubtful if it is day,\n  doubtful if it is night, and the law is to be strict in every place. \n  And accordingly, we don't light during twilight; and one who does\n  melacha during twilight prior to Sabbath or twilight after Sabbath, by\n  mistake -- must bring a sin offering in every place.  And these stars\n  aren't the large ones which can be seen by day, or the small ones\n  which can be seen only at night [ i.e. in total darkness  ]; and once\n  three medium stars have been seen, it is certainly night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So first of all once three medium stars have been seen ( or could be seen ) the Shabbat day is certainly over and it would seem to imply that the biblical punishments for doing melacha on Shabbat would no longer apply.</p>\n\n<p>Now why do we say Havdalah?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/3129.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">הלכות שבת פרק כט,א</a></p>\n  \n  <p>מצות עשה מן התורה, לקדש יום השבת בדברים--שנאמר \"זכור את יום השבת,\n  לקדשו\" (שמות כ,ז), כלומר זוכרהו זכירת שבח וקידוש; וצריך לזוכרהו\n  בכניסתו, וביציאתו--בכניסתו בקידוש היום, וביציאתו בהבדלה.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is a positive commandment from the Torah, to sanctify the Sabbath\n  with certain acts -- as it is said, \"remember the Sabbath day, and\n  sanctify it\", namely commemorate it in an honorable and sanctified\n  way; and one must commemorate it's beginning, and it's end -- at it's\n  beginning with Kiddush and at it's end with Havdalah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We say it in order to fulfill the commandment of commemorating the Sabbath, just as the Sabbath begins whether or not we say Kiddush, it ends whether or not we say Havdalah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/3129.htm#5\" rel=\"nofollow\">הלכות שבת פרק כט,ה</a></p>\n  \n  <p>אסור לאדם לאכול או לשתות יין, משיקדש היום--עד שיקדש.  וכן משייצא היום,\n  אסור לו להתחיל לאכול ולשתות, ולעשות מלאכה, או לטעום כלום--עד שיבדיל;\n  ולשתות המים, מותר.  שכח או עבר, ואכל ושתה קודם שיקדש או קודם\n  שיבדיל--הרי זה מקדש ומבדיל, אחר שאכל.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is forbidden for a person to eat or drink wine, from the time\n  Sabbath starts -- until he sanctifies it.  And also from when the\n  Sabbath ends, one is forbidden to start to eat or drink, and to do\n  melacha, or to taste anything -- until he makes a separation ( does\n  havadalah ); and to drink water is permitted.  He forgot or\n  disregarded it, and ate and drank before doing Kiddush or before\n  making Havdalah -- the person makes Kiddush or Havdalah after they\n  finish eating.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems to me that we have a prohibition of melacha here which is specifically tied to the commandment of making Havadalah, since the Sabbath has already finished and together with it the prohibition of melacha which carries the death penalty.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we fulfill the biblical requirement of Havdalah so that we may eat and do melacha?  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/3129.htm#6\" rel=\"nofollow\">הלכות שבת פרק טכ,ו</a></p>\n  \n  <p>ו  מדברי סופרים לקדש על היין, ולהבדיל על היין.  ואף על פי שהבדיל\n  בתפילה, צריך להבדיל על הכוס; ומאחר שיבדיל ויאמר בין קודש לחול, מותר לו\n  לעשות מלאכה, אף על פי שלא הבדיל על הכוס.</p>\n  \n  <p>And there is a Rabbinic requirement to make Kiddush on wine, and to\n  make Havdalah on wine.  And even though he made Havdalah in the\n  prayers, he needs to make Havdalah on a cup; and as soon as he made\n  Havdalah and said, \"between the holy and profane\", he's permitted to\n  do melacha, even if he hasn't made Havdalah on a cup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So as soon as he has said, \"between the holy and profane\" during his prayers he fulfills the biblical requirement of Havdalah and is allowed to do melacha.  So what prayer is being referred to here?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2202.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow\">הלכות תפילה פרק ב,ד</a></p>\n  \n  <p>וכן במוצאי שבתות וימים טובים--אינו מתפלל הביננו, מפני שצריך לומר הבדלה\n  בחונן הדעת.</p>\n  \n  <p>And also on Motzai Shabbaths and Yom Tovs -- one does not pray\n  \"havi'nenu\", because one must say Havdalah in \"Chonen Ha'Da'at\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Hillel on the other hand, did not accept financial assistance from his brother Shevna (or <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/40524\">Shachna</a>).

Assuming that the congregation and the rabbi do not object, he says there is no halakhic problem with this, as long as the sefer Torah is treated with the respect due to it (from both men and women). However, it is also forbidden to cause machloket, such that if this will do so it would be prohibited. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Not voicing an opinion, just providing sources that it's <strong>impractical</strong> to allow women to dance with the Sefer Torah.</p>\n\n<p>See the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0152_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">סימן קנג - הלכות נדה</a> that says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>סעיף טז</strong>' אִשָּׁה נִדָּה, בִּימֵי רְאִיָתָהּ קֹדֶם יְמֵי לִבּוּנָהּ, נוֹהֲגִין שֶׁאֵינָהּ נִכְנֶסֶת לְבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת וְאֵינָהּ מִתְפַּלֶּלֶת. אַךְ בַּיָמִים הַנּוֹרָאִים, דְּהַיְנוּ מִיּוֹם רִאשׁוֹן דִּסְלִיחוֹת וּלְהַלָּן שֶׁרַבִּים מִתְאַסְּפִים בְּבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת, וְיִהְיֶה לָּהּ עִצָּבוֹן גָּדוֹל אִם לֹא תֵלֵךְ, מֻתֶּרֶת לָלֶכֶת וּלְהִתְפַּלֵל. וְכֵן כְּשֶׁהִיא מַשִׂיאָה אֶת בְּנָהּ אוֹ אֶת בִּתָּה, אוֹ כְּשֶׁהִיא יוֹלֶדֶת שֶהִגִּיעַ זְמַנָּה לָלֶכֶת לְבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת, וְכַיוֹצֵא בָזֶה, מֻתֶּרֶת. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Roughly translated as: <code>The custom is that as long as she's menstruating, she doesn't enter a Shul and doesn't pray. However, during the High Holidays - starting from the first day of Selichot - she may go to Shul. The same applies for family affairs where not being in Shul would upset her.</code></p>\n\n<p>Obviously holding a Sefer Torah would be forbidden according to this custom. Having to separate the women into 2 groups would be religiously unhealthy.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine the embarrassment  of those women who would have to decline holding the Sefer Torah!</p>\n\n<p>Similarly in the Rema on Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01975_part_5.html#HtmpReportNum0030_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">סימן פח - בעל קרי מתר בקריאת שמע</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>הגה</strong>: יֵשׁ שֶׁכָּתְבוּ שֶׁאֵין לְאִשָּׁה  נִדָּה בִּימֵי רְאִיָּתָהּ לִכָּנֵס לְבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת אוֹ לְהִתְפַּלֵּל אוֹ לְהַזְכִּיר  הַשֵּׁם <strong>אוֹ לִגֹּעַ בְּסֵפֶר</strong> (הַגָּהוֹת מַיְמוֹנִי פֶּרֶק ד') וְיֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים שֶׁמֻּתֶּרֶת בַּכֹּל, וְכֵן עִקָּר (רַשִׁ''י הִלְכוֹת נִדָּה) אֲבָל הַמִּנְהָג בִּמְדִינוֹת אֵלּוּ כַּסְּבָרָא הָרִאשׁוֹנָה. וּבִימֵי לִבּוּן נָהֲגוּ הֶתֵּר, וַאֲפִלּוּ בְּמָקוֹם שֶׁנָּהֲגוּ לְהַחְמִיר, בְּיָמִים  נוֹרָאִים וּכְהַאי גַּוְנָא שֶׁרַבִּים מִתְאַסְּפִים לֵילֵךְ לְבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת, מֻתָּרִין לֵילֵךְ לְבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת כִּשְׁאָר נָשִׁים, כִּי הוּא לָהֶן עִצָּבוֹן גָּדוֹל, שֶׁהַכֹּל מִתְאַסְּפִין וְהֵן יַעַמְדוּ חוּץ (פִּסְקֵי מַהֲרִי''א סי' קל''ב): ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He explicitly mentions that some have the custom that they don't touch Seforim; so obviously holding a Sefer Torah would be an issue. </p>\n\n<p>The Taz (brought down in the <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01582.html#HtmpReportNum0087_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aruch HaShulchan</a>) says that they (i.e. menstruating women) <strong>shouldn't even look inside the Sefer Torah</strong> during Hagbah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ולא תביט בספר תורה בשעת הגבהה</strong> (ט''ז). ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01355_part_5.html#HtmpReportNum0017_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yalkut Yosef</a> also mentions this custom - so it's not only an Ashkenazi custom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ג</strong> יש נשים שנוהגות להחמיר על עצמן שלא להכנס לבית הכנסת בימי טומאתן, <strong>ושלא להסתכל בספר תורה בעת שמגביהים אותו</strong>, ואף על פי שמעיקר הדין הכל מותר להן, מכל מקום רשאות הן להחמיר על עצמן בזה. אולם בימים נוראים שנשים רבות מתאספות ובאות לבית הכנסת, לא נהגו להחמיר, כי עלבון גדול הוא להן, שהכל נכנסות לעזרת נשים והן ישארו בחוץ.

There is a concern when consuming any permitted blood that no one think you are consuming forbidden blood. A classic solution to this is including fish scales in a cup of fish blood (ibid. :9). It seems to me that a transfusion bag serves this purpose sufficiently. Even were one to argue on this point the prohibition would remain at a rabbinic one and not a biblical one, and hence can be lifted for any seriously ill individual even if their life is not threatened.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, one is only prohibited from consuming forbidden food through the throat (Rambam MA 14:3).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>That verse in Leviticus says don't eat blood.

Some sins are less bad than these [and therefore wouldn't], however the  rabbis said \"one who does these regularly will lose his share in the World to Come\" in order to make a point and distance a person from them. They are: dubbing a friend with derogatory nicknames or using such nicknames, deeply shaming someone in public, putting oneself on a pedestal by taking advantage of someone else's shame, disgracing scholars or one's own teachers, disgracing the holidays or holy matters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, there's a responsum from Rabbi Moshe Feinstein -- OC4:116 -- for someone overcome with sexual guilt. He says when the Zohar, and subsequently the Shulchan Aruch, say a certain sin is \"as bad as all others combined\", it's \"lav davka\" -- it doesn't really mean that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Tosefos seems to take at least one of them literally.</p>\n<p>Tosefos Sotah 10b s.v. נח לו:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נראה האי דלא חשיב ליה (פסחים דף כה.) בהדי ג' עבירות שאין עומדים בפני פקוח נפש עבודת כוכבים וגילוי עריות ושפיכות דמים משום דעבירת הלבנת פנים אינה מפורשת בתורה ולא נקט אלא עבירות המפורשות</p>\n<p>It seems that that which embarrassing someone is not counted among the 3 sins for which one must give up their life is because it is not explicit in the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosefos is bothered that embarrasing someone should be on the halachic list of things for which you give up your life, because the Gemara says that you should throw yourself into a fire rather than embarrass someone.  Tosefos answer is not that it is hyperbolic, but that it was disqualified by a technicality.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is addressed in a responsum by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_ben_Sheshet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Isaac Ben Sheshet</a> (Shu\"t HaRivash # 171). He states that the Sages frequently exaggerated the severity of sins in order to keep the populace from committing them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה שאמרת שהגאונים והרשב\"א ז\"ל כתבו שהעובר על החרמים והשבועות הוא בכלל\n  לא ינקה והיינו כעובד ע\"ג דכתיב בה ולא ידבק בידך מאומה מן החרם ע\"כ אם\n  הפליגו להגדיל העון ההוא כמו שעשו חז\"ל שאמרו שבכל עברות שבתורה נאמר בהן\n  ונקה וכאן לא ינקה וכן שנפרעין ממנו ומכל העולם לא אמרו בו שיהרג ואל\n  יעבור כמו באותן ג' עברות וזה לא עלה על דעת שום אדם ולא חשב אנוש אלא\n  שדרך החכמים להפליג בהגדלת העונות כדי שישמר אדם מהכשל בהן אמרו בפ' יש\n  בערכין כל המספר לשון הרע מגדיל עונות כנגד שלש עברות ע\"ג וגלוי עריות\n  ושפיכות דמים וכו' וכן במס' נדרים יצא ר' עקיבא ודרש כל שאינו מבקר את\n  החולה כאלו שופך דמים ובפ' ר\"א דאורג אמרו הקורע בגדיו בחמתו וכו' יהיה\n  בעיניך כעובד ע\"ג היאמר אדם באלו וכיוצא בהם יהרג ואל יעבור הא ליכא\n  למימר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechezkel_Feivel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Ezekiel Feivel</a> similarly states (Toldos Adam Chapter 13) that the Sages frequently exaggerated in these types of matters.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכמו כן כשרצו חז\"ל להרחיק בכל כח את האדם מן העברה הפליגו בזכרון נזקיה\n  עד למעלה דרך משל על עם הארץ אמרו מותר לנחרו ביום כפורים שחל להיות בשבת\n  ולקרעו כדג ומגבו [ועיין בר\"ן] אשר דבריהם אלה ואלף כיוצא בהם אין לחשוד\n  כל מי שיש לו לב שיקחם כפשוטם חלילה אבל כך היא דרכן של חכמים להפליג\n  במליצותיהם במקומות רבים ולערב בדבריהם במליצות קשות ומפליאים עד שירגיזו\n  לב הקורא והיא באמת חכמה נפלאה להעיר לב הקורא או השומע להתבונן מה ראו\n  חכמים להעלות המשל הקשה על זה על שפתותיהם ומה הגיע אליהם שיאמרו כזאת\n  וכשיתבוננו היטב יבין האמת יותר מאם היו מבארים לו הדבר באורך ורוחב כי\n  אולי לא היה נותן לב לדבריהם ועכשיו הוא נותן לב ויעשה האמת את שלו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He goes on to quote R. Isaac Ben Sheshet (cited above), and claims that Rambam was alluding to this idea in his Commentary to Sanhedrin 7:4 where he wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכבר הזהירו חכמים מאד על ההרהור והרחיקו מגורמיו והאריכו לירא ולהפחיד\n  מקשה עצמו לדעת ומוציא שכבת זרע לבטלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rashi explains \"tznius\" in either of two ways: (a) keeping one's emotions within appropriate bounds (e.g., not being over-mournful at a funeral, or giddy at a wedding); (b) not drawing attention to what one is spending.</p>\n<p>It would seem that both of these come down to the same idea: keeping private what should be private. This would fit with what we find about the three personages mentioned in the Gemara you quoted: each of them knew how to keep a secret. It therefore also yields the common definition of tznius - keeping to oneself (and one's spouse) certain areas and aspects of one's body, behavior and emotions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your daughter probably has a grasp of the notion of private body parts and private information. Teach her the values of humility, bashfullness and respect. If someone grasps the essential elements of Tz'niut and doesn't feel a need to show off, then issues of clothing and sexual-modesty will hopefully follow (somewhat) naturally as they become more and more relevant.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I have seen this done in two ways.</p>\n\n<p>First, in one Orthodox school I know of, teachers explain that we are all in Hashem's \"army\" (I know, many hate war metaphors) whose job it is to do mitzvos, and that we all have a uniform we wear. Boys wear a kippah and tzitzis as their uniform, and girls dress tznius as their uniform. The issue of war metaphors aside, I think this is a nice way of doing it, because it makes girls feel as important as boys despite not having special Jewish clothing items. (A potential downside is that it fails to recognize that tznius also applies to men.)</p>\n\n<p>Second, people often explain tznius by simply saying \"some parts of the body are private\" and not for other people to see. This is not that different from the basic boundary-drawing that occurs in virtually every society. Every culture has their own boundaries in terms of which body parts can be displayed and in what ways. There is generally no need to explain specifically why our boundaries are drawn one way and not another.</p>\n\n<p>Apologies for the lack of sources, but I thought I would provide this answer in case it is useful.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.lmaanyishmeu.com/pdf/Tznius%20-%20Gluckowsky.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this nice article / pamphlet.</a> Excerpted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We Are What We Wear</p>\n<p>The Chasam Sofer explains, the reason Rivkah\ndressed Yaakov in Esav’s garments was to enable him to lie to Yitzchak\n(to receive the brochos), for clothing influence one’s behavior.</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, the Amshinover Rebbe explains why Potifar’s wife\ngrabbed onto Yosef’s clothing. She was trying to catch him thru his\nweakness – the way he dressed, in the Egyptian dress.</p>\n<p>Beauty With Tznius</p>\n<p>The Midrash states: When Vashti made a seuda for\nthe women, emphasis was placed on the external décor, for women\nappreciate external beauty more than food and drink. For this reason,\nwhile creating Chava, Hashem commanded each limb as he formed it, “Be\nmodest. Be modest.” Hashem was reminding her that although He created\nwoman with a natural affinity for beauty, Tznius must always come\nfirst.</p>\n<p>Children Have Eyes Too</p>\n<p>According to the Zohar, our actions affect the\nYiras Shomaim of our children. What children see in the home has a\nlasting impression on them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Children are impressed by stories and parables, especially, when they relate to events and stories that they learnin school and at home. The one about Yosef and Potifar is a familiar story, but I admit, that until I read this, now, I never viewed this in terms of Tzniut. The one about Chava is also news to me. I think young kids - male and female can learn a basic concept about how tzni'ut was incorporated into creation.</p>\n<p>The article also emphasizes that tzni'ut means dressing \"like a Jew\" even if you wear \"modest\" clothes, i.e. - it stresses the idea not to dress like the Gentiles do. Your kid's yeshiva already emphasizes a dress code. Good thing! (My elementary school yeshiva, in Washington Heights, NY, hindsight, was a bit too lenient. Perhaps, the Breuer's boys chiding my school about that were right, after all!) Now, you can explain to your daughter WHY there is a dress code!</p>\n<p>Lastly, kids are more impressed by watching how their parent's dress and behave. It would be foolish to tell them to do something that you can't follow.</p>\n<p>It's extremely important while your kids are in yeshiva to follow what their rebbe's /morah's tell them to follow, halachically, even if you don't believe them yourself. (Unless, of course, the suggestion is absolutely frivolous or dangerous (rare, but not impossible) or physically, can't be done (e.g. - it becomes an economic hardship, your kid has a special need, etc.)) I.e. - if their teachers tell them that women must wear sleeves a specific minimum length, you should do that even if you think the rebbe / morah is \"ridiculous\". Otherwise, you're asking for some \"trouble\" in the future that you may not know how to deal with...</p>\n\n\n",

Gentiles were allowed to bring an olah in our Temple, unlike the rest of the kinds of qorbanot, which were reserved for Jews alone within the Temple itself; it should be remembered, however, that Gentiles are permitted to build their own place for qorbanot, and offer them to God themselves, and are promised reward for this meritorious behavior. \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, gentiles are allowed to give burnt offering in the temple. \nIt also says gentiles are allowed to build their own place to give this burnt offering.</p>\n\n<p>What are the specifications of such an alter built by gentiles, and after building, what is the process of such an offering done by a gentile?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The Korban does need to be brought on an altar (Rambam Maaseh Korbanot 19:1). This altar though does not have the requirements of horns, a ramp, a base, and square corners which regular altars (including a Bamah Gedolah, though that isn't the case here (Megilla 9b)) have (Zevachim 108b). I don't see any other listed exclusions, so presumably other requirements of the altar apply, such as a minimum size of 1x1x3 Amot (Rambam Beit HaBerchira 2:17). The materials for the altar (including the wood for the fire) may not have been used constructively for humans beforehand (Zevachim 116b).</p>\n\n<p>They can offer any kosher mammal or bird even if it has a blemish (ibid. 115b) unless it is missing an entire limb (ibid. 116a).</p>\n\n<p>The gentile may slaughter his own Korban even though generally gentiles cannot perform a valid Shechita.</p>\n\n<p>I see no indication or reason why the procedure of catching and sprinkling the blood should be any different.</p>\n\n<p>Jews may instruct the gentiles regarding the proper methodology but cannot assist in any way. This can be done nowadays even outside of Israel. (Rambam Maaseh Korbanot 19:16)</p>\n\n\n",

He was carrying a load on his head fit for ten men and running as fast as a horse. R. Akiva made a decree about him and had him stand in place. R. Akiva said to that man, \"Why are you doing such hard work; if you are a slave and your master is doing this to you, I will redeem you from him; and if you are [doing so because] you are poor, I will make you rich.\" He said [back] to him, \"I plead with you, do not delay me, lest those who are appointed over me will get angry with me!\" He said to him, \"What is this and what are you doing?\" He said to him, \"That man (referring to himself) is dead; and every day, they send me to cut wood and burn me with them.\" He said to him, \"My son, what was your work in the world from which you came?\" He said to him, \"I was a tax collector and I was from the leaders of the people, but I would favor the rich and kill the poor.\" He said to him, \"Have you not heard anything from those appointed over you, whether there is a remedy for you.\" He said to him, \"I plead with you, do not delay me, lest those in charge of punishments over me will get angry with me, as there is no remedy for that man. However I did hear one thing that cannot be: That were this poor man to have a son who would stand in the congregation and say, 'Bless the Lord who is blessed,' and they would answer after him, ''Blessed be the Lord who is blessed forever and ever,' or if he should say, 'May He be exalted,' and they answer after him, 'May His great name be blessed forever and ever,' they would release that man from [further] punishment. But that man did not leave a son in the world; he left his wife pregnant, but does not know, [even] if she gave birth to a male, who will teach him. For that man does not have a friend in the world.\" That instant R. Akiva took upon himself to go and find out if he fathered a male child, in order to teach him Torah and stand him up in front of the congregation [to lead them in prayer]. He said to him, \"What is your name?\" He said to him, \"Akiva.\" \"And your wife's name?\" He said to him, \"Shoshniva.\" \"And the name of your town?\" He said to him, \"Ludkiya.\" R. Akiva immediately grieved greatly and went to ask about him. When he came to that place, he asked about him. They said to him, \"May the bones of that wicked man be ground up!\" He asked about his wife. They said to him, \"May her memory be erased from the world.\" He asked about the child. They said to him, \"He is uncircumcised; we have not even troubled ourselves about the commandment of his circumcision.\" R. Akiva took him immediately and circumcised him and placed him in front of him. But he could not absorb Torah, until he sat and fasted for forty days for his sake. [Then] a heavenly voice emerged and said to him, \"R. Akiva, go and teach him.\" He proceeded teach him Torah, the recitation of Shema, the Eighteen blessings (of the standing prayer) and the grace over the meals. Then he had him stand in front of the congregation and say, \"Bless the Lord who is blessed,\" and the congregation answered after him, ''Blessed be the Lord who is blessed forever and ever.\" [He continued], \"May He be exalted,\" [and they answered], \"May His great name [...].\" That instant, they immediately released the dead man from his punishment. He immediately came to R. Akiva in a dream and said, \"May it be the will in front of God that He should ease your mind in the Garden of Eden, for you have saved me from the punishment of Geihinnom.\" Immediately R. Akiva began and said, \"May Your name, Lord be forever; Your fame, Lord, through all generations.\" And my teacher, Rabbi Elazar of Wurms, accordingly found [in] the Tanna debei Eliyahu Rabba, that a child who says, \"May He be exalted,\" saves his father from punishment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which midrash or gemara is this story taken from?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The story, in much the same wording, is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Machzor_Vitry%2C_Laws_of_Shabbat.144.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machzor Vitry, Motzaei Shabbos</a> (preceding the Ohr Zarua by about a generation).</p>\n<p>There's a very similar story in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tractate_Kallah_Rabbati.2.9?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kallah Rabbasi, ch. 2</a>, and presumably it's the Machzor Vitry's/Ohr Zarua's source:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דר׳ עקיבא נפק לההוא אתרא אשכחיה לההוא גברא דהוי דרי טונא אכתפיה ולא הוה מצי לסגויי ביה והוה צוח ומתאנח, א״ל מאי עבידתיך א״ל לא שבקנא איסורא דלא עבידנא בההיא עלמא ועכשיו איכא נטורין עילוון ולא שבקין לי דאינוח א״ל רבי עקיבא שבקת ברא א״ל בחייך לא תשלין דדחילנא ממלאכי דמחו לי בפולסי דנורא ואמרין לי אמאי לא תיתי בפריע א״ל אימא ליה דקא ניחותך, א״ל שבקית אתתא מעברתא אזל ר׳ עקיבא עאל לההיא מדינתא, אמר להו בריה דפלוני היכא (ליה) אמרו ליה יעקר זכרו דההוא שחיק עצמות א״ל אמאי אמרו ליה ההוא לסטים אכל אינשי ומצער בריתא ולא עוד אלא שבא על נערה המאורסה ביום הכפורים. אזל לביתיה אשכח אתתיה מעוברתא נטרה עד דילדה, אזל מהליה לכי גדל אוקמי׳ בבי כנישתא לברוכי בקהלא לימים אזל ר׳ עקיבא לההוא אתרא איתחזי ליה א״ל תנוח דעתך שהנחת את דעתי</p>\n<p>R.

Akiva] said to him, \"Tell him (alternative version, from Menoras Hamaor: tell me) what will give you rest.\" He said, \"I left my wife pregnant.\" R. Akiva thereupon went to that city and asked, \"Where is X's son?\" They replied, \"May the memory of that one, who deserves to have his bones ground up, be uprooted!\" He asked them, \"Why?\" They replied, \"That robber consumed people and harassed everyone. Not only that, he fornicated with a betrothed maiden on Yom Kippur!\" [R. Akiva] went to his house and found [the man's] wife pregnant. He waited until she gave birth, circumcised [the baby], and when he had matured, brought him to the synagogue to say a blessing in public. Later R. Akiva went to the same place, and [the man] appeared to him, saying, \"May your mind be at ease, as you have put my mind at ease.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that at the beginning of the story, this unfortunate creature refers to \"that world,\" implying that R.

During 10 days of Teshuva, we are \"beinonim\" - i.e. - the fate of our future awaits in G-d's hands (a recurring theme mentioned esp. in UN'Taneh Tokef, among other prayers.) We ask G-d to listen to us and we pray that He will seal us in the book of life. We pray that we be successful in our endeavors, but we also need G-d's help to do that - a theme mentioned in this Psalm.</p>\n\n<p>Another concept is alluded to by <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50393&st=&pgnum=719\" rel=\"nofollow\">Torah Temimah</a> which says that this Psalm is a reference to Abraham praying for G-d's help for a miracle to occur so that he wouldn't have to sacrifice Yitzhak.

The brothers described it as something \"found\" which they wanted him to \"recognize,\" which is exactly how the Torah describes the rights of the firstborn.  The brothers were hinting to Yaakov that it was not right of him to favor Yosef in this way.</p>\n<p>In other words, the sons of Yaakov felt that your question was a valid challenge to Yaakov's behavior.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Indeed, in Devarim 21:16 - 17 it states that the father cannot favor the son of the beloved wife over the older son of a hated wife. But that is with all else being equal, with the only reason one favors the younger firstborn being love for the more beloved wife.</p>\n\n<p>Reuven lost his firstborn rights for sleeping with Bilhah, his father's concubine. This is stated explicitly in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25a05.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Divrei Hayamim I, 5:1-2</a>:</p>\n\n<p>א  וּבְנֵי רְאוּבֵן בְּכוֹר-יִשְׂרָאֵל, כִּי הוּא הַבְּכוֹר--וּבְחַלְּלוֹ יְצוּעֵי אָבִיו, נִתְּנָה בְּכֹרָתוֹ לִבְנֵי יוֹסֵף בֶּן-יִשְׂרָאֵל; וְלֹא לְהִתְיַחֵשׂ, לַבְּכֹרָה.\nborn.\nב  כִּי יְהוּדָה גָּבַר בְּאֶחָיו, וּלְנָגִיד מִמֶּנּוּ; וְהַבְּכֹרָה, לְיוֹסֵף.</p>\n\n<p>1 And the sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel--for he was the first-born; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father's couch, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, yet not so that he was to be reckoned in the genealogy as first-born.\n2 For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came he that is the prince; but the birthright was Joseph's.</p>\n\n<p>As I note in <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2010/12/incident-with-reuven-and-bilhah-in.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a>, this idea roughly corresponds to the legal codes in the time of Yaakov. We see in the Code of Hammurabi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"158\">\n  <li>If a free man has sexual relations with his father's first wife, who is the mother of sons, after the death of his father, that man shall lose his paternal inheritance.</li>\n  <li>If any one be surprised after his father with his chief wife, who has borne children, he shall be driven out of his father's house.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case, it was a concubine during his father's lifetime, and he did not lose the entirety of the inheritance, but just the firstborn rights. Still, it is of a similar nature.</p>\n\n<p>So, even if we want to say that this Torah law applies to Yaakov prior to the giving of the Torah, there is a cultural and legal context in which to apply the law, just as is stated in Divrei Hayamim (and quite possibly in the ambiguous and cryptic parallel text in parshat Vaychi).</p>\n\n\n",

We are saying the following: G-d, if we\n  transgressed any part of Your Torah which is found in 24 books, please\n  forgive us, G-d, with Your utmost compassion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, his explanation seems even stronger to relate this to Torah reading!</p>\n\n<p>However, Machzor Vitri, 93: (the article is a PDF, and I have trouble copying Hebrew from there to here. See page 2 in that article) starts by just mentioning that this is said \"on Monday's and Thursday's\" without mentioning any connection of Kri'at Hatorah. Of course, the Torah is read each Monday and Thursday, anyway, but, perhaps, since he does not state any connection to it, we MIGHT infer that it should be said even if you can't read.</p>\n\n<p>My own thinking:</p>\n\n<p>It's connected to Torah reading, not Tachanun. The reason is that Half Kaddish is said before Kel Erech Apa'im, not after it. (See <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=p2qC-G9wR1EC&lpg=PP1&dq=rite%20and%20reason&pg=PA145#v=onepage&q=rite%20and%20reason&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rite and Reason, p. 68</a> for an explanation of why Half Kaddish is said between Tachanun and Ashrei.)</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion - \"tzarich iyun\". B\"N, we'll both keep hunting. Not that I'm lazy, but, I hope that you discover the answer before me, as I'd rather learn from you!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If kings get up at 3 hours past sunrise, wouldn't they need some extra time to say Shma?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h11.htm\">Mishna Brachot 1</a>:2 gives the times for saying Shma in the morning.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מאימתיי קורין את שמע בשחרים:  משיכיר בין תכלת ללבן; רבי אליעזר אומר, בין תכלת לכרתן.  עד הנץ החמה; רבי יהושוע אומר, עד שלוש שעות, שכן דרך בני מלכים לעמוד בשלוש שעות.  הקורא מכאן ואילך, לא הפסיד, כאדם שהוא קורא בתורה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to רבי אליעזר, it must be finished by sunrise, presumably because that's when people get up. רבי יהושוע gives until 3 halachic hours into the day, because that's when kings get up.</p>\n\n<p>However, if that is when people get up, wouldn't they need time to get up, wash, dress, and say whatever davening comes before it? How could it be set at the time that people get up?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><em>NOTE: both of these are only partial answers; the 1st may be against the Rashba and the 2nd is disputed</em> </p>\n\n<h2>First Answer</h2>\n\n<p>The simplest answer might be that the times of getting up and going to sleep are based on when non-Jews, who are exempt from Shema, wake up (after all, non-Jews do make up the vast majority of the human population). Rishonim (see Tos. 2b) ask a similar question regarding the time of night-Shema, if it depends on a poor person's meal time - when does this person say Shema? The Rashba (and other rishonim) writes that 'certainly we aren't dealing with a non-Jewish person', so presumably the Rashba thinks that wake up times of the Torah are dependent on those of Jews. </p>\n\n<p>I haven't seen anyone who argues on this Rashba regarding the poor man, but I should note that the Gemara states David woke up at daybreak (daf 4a), and the Gemara specifically says there that 'all the kings of the west and east wake up at three hours', meaning, that this was the wake-up time for non-Jews kings.</p>\n\n<h2>Second Answer</h2>\n\n<p>When the Mishna says that one can read Keriyas Shema until 3 hours, it isn't clear whether this means 'the beginning of the third hour' (meaning, one can only read for two hours after sunrise), or 'the end of the third hour' (which would allow reading for three hours after sunrise). The Gemara asks this question regarding praying into the 4th hour (Berachos 26b-27) and answers that the mishnah means that it means the <em>end</em> of the 4th hour, so all four hours are included. Thus, we pasken (see Beis Yosef O.C. 58) that the same is true regarding Shema, that 'the 3rd hour' includes the entire 3rd hour. </p>\n\n<p>However, regarding the actual wake-up time of princes, the Gemara states pretty clearly (see 3b) that they did so at the <strong>beginning</strong> of the 3rd hour, meaning only 2 hours after sunrise. Thus, Rabeinu Peretz (hagahos Semak Keriyas Shema 104) writes that the discrepancy exists specifically because the princes themselves need to say Keriyas Shema, which they do anyway. Similarly, the Bach (O.C. 58:2) writes that the princes needed time to get up and get dressed, meaning that the statement of the Mishna, דרך בני מלכים לעמוד בשלוש שעות, is that that's when they start their day, after they've gotten dressed and davened, etc. Thus, kings get up about an hour before the end of the zman according to R. Yehoshua. </p>\n\n<p>The other time in the mishna, sunrise, also sounds like it was not a common wake-up time, but rather by which time most people were ready for prayer, as the mishna has cases of people being in the Mikvah from beforehand (Brachos 22b). However, this might not necessarily be the case, as the Gemara (daf 25b) notes that this mishna isn't necessarily referring to the latest time for shema, but merely the ideal time (kevasikin). Thus, it might be true that most people are not yet awake by sunrise, but because that's the beginning of the time that people rise, it's still זמן קימה. The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1917&st=&pgnum=9&hilite=\">Kehilas Yaakov</a> therefore writes that the time of 'waking up' (as well as that of 'going to sleep') required for reading Shema must take this into consideration, and so the actual time intended by the Torah (he writes 'the Rabbis' but I assume he means the Torah) is actually slightly after wake-up time, enough to say Shema. </p>\n\n<p>However, I should note that this position isn't universally accepted. Rabbeinu Simcha, quoted by the Hagahos Mordechai, (as well as other rishonim) believe based on the Gemara on daf 3b that the time for Keriyas Shema is actually only <em>until</em>, but not including the 3rd hour, and that they don't have that extra hour to get dressed and say Shema. </p>\n\n\n",

This person is a drunkard, since it is stated (of him in Gen. 9:21), ‘Then he drank of the wine [and became drunk].’” [When] Abraham came, they said to Him, “Is this the one?” He told them, “This is a stranger (ger), from which Yishmael came out.” [When] Isaac came, they said to Him, “Is this the one?” He told them, “This one loves My enemy, as stated (in Gen. 25:28), ‘Now Isaac loved Esau.’” <strong>When Jacob came, they said to Him, “Is this the one?” He told them, “Yes, for so it says (in Gen. 35:10), ‘God said to him, “Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but your name shall be Israel.”’ So all Israel was called by his name.” At that time the Holy One, blessed be he, sanctified them because of His name, as stated (in Is. 49:3), “Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”</strong> The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Since you were sanctified for My name before I created My world, be holy as I am holy.” It is so stated (in Lev. 19:2), “[You shall be holy,] because I am holy.” To what is the matter comparable? To a king who betrothed a wife. He said to her, “Because you have been betrothed (literally, sanctified) to my name, I am a king and you, a queen. Just as it (i.e., my name) is an honor for me, so it is an honor for you. Why?

I personally don't like unnecessary embellishments. Is the tallis kosher without an atara?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The source of the attara is found most easily in the Mishna Berurah siman 8 siff 4. It is based on chazzal who tell us the krashim (beams) in the Mishkan (Tabernacle) had signs written on them, so that the ones that merited to be on the north side would always be on the north side. So too the sides of the talis -- the side that is in front should always be in front. The Mishna Berurah quotes the Arizal that this is not so important with regards to talis. The Aruch Hashulchan in siff 10 mentions that if you have a piece of material sewn on the inside on top to keep the talis from getting ruined with sweat, this is good enough for keeping track of which side is supposed to be in front. He also mentions his dislike of a silver attara due to the fact that it seems to imply the the main point of a talis is to cover one's head as opposed to ones body, which is against our final ruling of the gemara. </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, this same argument about whether to compare other mitzvos to the krashim in this sense (meaning, to take care to make sure that what's on top stays on top) is found with regards to marking one's succah walls, to make sure they end up facing toward the same compass direction. The Bikurei Yaakov dismisses this completely and the Mishna Berurah brings his opinion in the Biur Halacha. But in that same piece, the Bikurei Yaakov also dismissed the comparison between the talis and the krashim. So in fact, it's pretty hypocritical when we all sit in our succas without assigned walls while wearing our taleisim with ataras on.<br>\nThats where the old excuse of minhag (tradition) comes in handy. We are \"noheg\" (have a tradition) to do this but not that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>see <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=1356\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> from Rabbi Eliezer Simcha Weisz</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Question: Must a Talit have an Atara?</p>\n  \n  <p>Answer: No - in the sense that you mean an Atara of silver etc. -\n  usually there is a cloth on the Talit to indicate which side should be\n  used for covering the head.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>of course. it is actual a specific custom not to have an embellished atarah. there is an idea of mitzvah b'hidur. there are two ways of looking at this. one way is to add something to make the mitzvah beautiful such as the embellished atarah or decorations on the walls of the sukkah. </p>\n\n<p>the other view is the mitzvah itself is beautiful already and we fulfill the mitzvah b/hidur when we do so in the fullest manner. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The Orthodox approach to R. Benamozegh's theology?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Benamozegh\">R. Elijah Benamozegh</a> was a 19th century rabbi and kabbalist, who wrote many works of biblical commentary and Jewish responsa, but is chiefly known in the non-Jewish world for his book on religious universalism, <em>Israel and Humanity</em>. </p>\n\n<p><em>Israel and Humanity</em> is quite singular in that it shows an orthodox rabbi incorporating non-Jewish religious sources (esp. Christian verses) in order to advocate his vision for a Noahide world coexisting with a Jewish one. In 2005, R. Adin Steinsaltz <a href=\"http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/common_knowledge/v011/11.1steinsaltz.html\">wrote an essay</a>, \"Peace without Conciliation,\" that quoted R. Benamozegh (on Benamozegh's assertion that \"Christianity is but a distorted Kabbalah\") to support his own view of correcting gentile nations and live according to Noahide laws. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I have heard, but cannot source, that most rabbis disapprove of R. Benamozegh's theology. Can someone help me out here? I don't know another religious Jewish person here in Israel who has even heard of him, and the English translation of <em>Israel and Humanity</em> is from a Catholic Publisher (Paulist Press). </p>\n\n<p>So, what rabbinic literature has been written about R. Benamozegh's Noahide works, from his lifetime to today? Is he accepted and learned in orthodox institutions (and why not)? Is it appropriate to study his works generally, and his Noahide theology specifically? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>While R. Elijah Benamozegh was apparently somewhat controversial in his day, he is hardly a \"unquotable\" figure: R. David Zvi Hoffmann and R. Mendel Kasher quote him in their work repeatedly, his work בשבילי המוסר was published by Mossad Harav Kook, and he is included in R. Avraham Bick-Shauli's anthology of Jewish thought. R. Yoel Schwartz (of Meah Shearim) quotes him in many of his seforim, he is the father of the modern Noahide movement, and he was one of the most original Jewish thinkers of the past 200 yrs.

Therefore, he remained in Hevron for seven years, until he was fit to receive the kingship properly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe another interesting explanation can be found in the sefer called <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/194765/p/33/t/4038911501234/fs/YMeta5wPGEIG0TuBlKsUp31Lf8iZgvWE5dc63P2ToUXk/start/558/end/612/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"מעלין בקודש\" , p. 37, it can be found on Otzar HaChochma</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מלכות תלויה ברציפות מדור לדור בחברון ניתנה המלכות לאבות ושם הם נקברו על כן על פי הזוהר שבע שנים צריך היה דוד לשהות שם על מנת להתחבר אליהם ולזכות בה אולי מסיבה דומה קדמה חברון ונבחרה לנתינת המלכות לאבות על מנת שיורישוה לבנים שם על פי המסורת קבורים אדם וחוה אדם הראשון שכלל בתוכו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the sefer \"מעלין בקודש\" the author explains that the kingship is dependent on the continuity of the generations.

Jacob is clearly shown to be in Hebron in Genesis 37:14. At Hebron, Jacob sends Joseph to see his brothers in Shechem/Dothan. Then his brothers sell him over to the Midianites/Egypt.\nWhen Judah and the brothers show Joseph's bloody coat of colors to Jacob, the first born blessing may have been automatically given to Judah. Since Joseph is no longer supposedly alive to Jacob. And this is possibly done in Hebron, where Jacob is residing at the time of them selling Joseph away.</p>\n<p>So, God feels that David needs to pray tribute to his ancestor Judah and be anointed King in Hebron, just like Judah was.  2 Samuel 2:4.</p>\n<p>There's a story or two at Hebron in Genesis. But there hasn't really been a story/event in Hebron post-Israelite conquest (after the book of Joshua), until 2 Samuel when God tells David to go there. Every location in Genesis is revisited in the post-conquest of Israel. In the book of Judges especially. Places like Beersheba, Bethel, Shechem, Mizpah of Gilead, Succoth, Penuel, Bethlehem, etc are introduced in Genesis and revisited in the post-conquest of Joshua/the Israelites. Interestingly enough, similar things happen at these certain locations as they did before/after the conquest.</p>\n\n\n",

Both of these play important roles in Halacha.  The monthly cycle establishes what is called a וסת קבוע, which affects what days a woman has to take into account that her menstruation is about to begin.  The sensation (הרגשה) is a Biblical prerequisite the absence of which prevents blood from creating ritual impurity, according to most opinions.</p>\n\n<p>At some point in history, women stopped having both of these.  The earliest discussion of the cessation of הרגשה that I have seen is in the שב יעקב, circa 1750.  The Aruch HaShulchan (early 20th century) asserts that women still have הרגשה, they just don't know what it is well enough to recognize it, but this is just a different way in which it was lost (it became undetected).</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yaakov Kaminetzky reported that when he was in Europe most women had regular Monthly cycles.  Today, it is very rare, although apparently not unheard of, from what I have been told.</p>\n\n<p>My question is - is there any Rabbinic speculation about why these changes, with significant Halachic ramifications and/or implications, occured when they did?

    "content": "# Why is the day of Rosh Chodesh announced before every month except Tishrei?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why is Tishrei the only month not included in the custom of announcing the day(s) of Rosh Chodesh on the Shabbos before the month begins?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>R. Reuven Margolios in his sefer Ollelos <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34361&st=&pgnum=62\">here</a> explains that when the Sanhedrin used to determine the date of Rosh Chodesh according to the sighting of witnesses of the new moon, it was of course impossible to announce beforehand on which day Rosh Chodesh would fall. But later, when the Romans made decrees which disrupted the announcements of the Sanhedrin concerning the fixing of the calendar, the Rabbis declared that from then on the calendar would be fixed according to their calculations, and thus it became possible to announce to the general population beforehand when the next Rosh Chodesh would be. This they did in the synagogues on the Shabbos before Rosh Chodesh just before Mussaf, since this was the time when most people were gathered together.</p>\n\n<p>However, this announcement was only necessary when the people would have had a doubt as to which day of the week would be the upcoming Rosh Chodesh. This doubt existed almost every month, because even if, for example, they knew which day Rosh Chodesh Nisan had been they still would not know on which day Rosh Chodesh Iyar would fall, because this required knowing whether the month of Nisan that year was 29 or 30 days.</p>\n\n<p>But the Gemora in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=8&daf=6&format=pdf\">Beitzah 6a</a> teaches that from the time of Ezra the month of Elul always had 29 days, and thus since everyone already knew which day had been Rosh Chodesh Elul, they all knew for certain which day was to be Rosh Chodesh Tishrei - Rosh Hashanah. </p>\n\n<p>Hence, there had never been a need to announce Rosh Chodesh on the Shabbos before the month of Tishrei, and thus this is still our custom today.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Mishna Berura 417:1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר\"ח וכו' - מנהג קדמונינו לברך את החודש בשבת שלפני ר\"ח חוץ מלפני ר\"ח תשרי ורמז לזה בכסה ליום חגנו</p>\n<p>The custom is to bless the new month on the preceding Shabbos, with the exception of Rosh Chodesh Tishrei.  A hint to this is the verse \"in hiding the day of our Holiday\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I once heard an explanation that this is in line with the idea of \"confusing the Satan\" by not giving him a heads up that Tishrei is coming.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://divreichaim.blogspot.com/2011_09_01_archive.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article</a> states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unlike all other months, Tishrei was not preceded by a kedushas\n  Shabbos -- Shabbos only came into existance after Rosh HaShana/Rosh\n  Chodesh Tisrei. I should have given that idea more thought and\n  explained it better. Putting aside the mysticism, what R' Leibele\n  Eiger means (and it's also in the Shem m'Shmuel) is that what makes,\n  for example, Kislev into Kislev is that fact that it comes after\n  Cheshvan (or to be technical, after the last Shabbos in Cheshvan);\n  what makes Teves into Teves is that it comes after Kislev. The flavor\n  of each month comes from the accumulation of the past that preceded\n  it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This reason is \"drash\", but I think it's a nice explanation.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Pinchas ben Yair, Father-in-law or son-in-law of Rebbi Shimon?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does anyone have any understanding how to settle this?</p>\n<p>We have R' Pinchas ben Yair, son-in-law of Rashbi, as mentioned in Gemoro Shabbos (:ג\"ל) appearing in the Zohar countless times as - his father-in-law! And dying before him\ntoo, as mentioned in the Idra Zuta.</p>\n<p>There have been some pathetic responses to this argument:\nOne was to be Magiha in the Gemoro text to חותניה instead of חתניה.\nThere are two problems with this. Firstly, there is no such word as חותניה in Aramaic, since it's a confusion between the Aramaic yud-hay ending, and the Hebrew word חותן. The\ncorrect word would have been חמוהי.\nSecondly, both R' Shrira Gaon's letter, and the Seder haKabbalah of the Raavad, state that\nR' Pinchos ben Yoir was a member of the Generation after Rashbi.</p>\n<p>Another response is that it is the Zohar text that should be emended - from חמוך to חתנך. This is impossible since the Zohar clearly states that R' Pinchas ben Yair was father of\nRashbi's wife, and grand-father of his son, and I quote from the Zohar .ו\"ל שמיני\nר\"א הוה אזיל באורחא אשכחיה לרבי פנחס בן יאיר, פתח ר' אלעזר ואמר עטרת זקנים בני בנים. ע\"כ.</p>\n<p>פרשת פנחס בדף ר\"מ: Another proof is from Zohar:\nא\"ר שמעון- בריך ברי לקב\"ה! עלך אתמר (משלי כג) ישמח אביך ואמך ותגל יולדתך. ישמח אביך דלעילא ואמך דא כנסת\nישראל. ותגל יולדתך דא ברתיה דרבי פנחס בן יאיר חסידא. אלעזר ברי וכו .'</p>\n<p>But most importantly, neither of these two feeble attempts deal with the fact that the gemara implies that Rashbi died before R' Pinchos ben Yair as demonstrated by R' Aharon\nHeiman in his Toldos Tanoim vAmoraim. Since it says in :ד\"פ מ\"ב:\nיסורי בתורה מאי היא? דכי הוו יתבי רבן שמעון בן גמליאל ורבי יהושע בן קרחה אספסלי יתבי קמייהו רבי אלעזר ברבי\nשמעון ורבי אארעא מקשו ומפרקו אמרי מימיהן אנו שותים והם יושבים על גבי קרקע עבדו להו ספסלי אסקינהו אמר להן\nמי שיש לו אב יחיה ומי שאין לו אב ימות אחתוהו נמי לרבי אלעזר ברבי שמעון. רבן שמעון בן גמליאל פרידה אחת יש לי ביניכם ואתם מבקשים לאבדה הימני אחתוהו לרבי אמר להן רבי יהושע בן קרחה</p>\n<p>So we see that Rashbi, but not Rebbi's own father - Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel - had already died\nwhilst Rebbi was still a young student.</p>\n<p>Yet in א\"ה ג\"פ תענית ירושלמי ובגמרא ,:ז חולין it says that Rabbi Pinchos ben Yair came to Rebbi to contest an enactment concerning Shviis that he had decreed on the Jewish community in his capacity as Nasi - This implying that his father had died by then and that he was already an authority in his own right. So, R' Pinchas ben Yair clearly died after Rashbi.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://files.daf-yomi.com/bookfiles/daf-al-hadaf-shabat/daf-al-hadaf-shabat177.pdf\">Here</a> the suggestion is to ammend the gemara to say בחתניה - Rabbi Pinchas Ben Yair heard about his son-in-law. No Aramaic problems. Note that the context there fits that better in two ways. One, it shows that Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai became more advanced than RPBY only after his 13 years in the cave, something that would apply more naturally to someone younger, and the language there is very much that of a younger person to an older one, looking for the older person to take pride in the younger one's accomplishment in learning. Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai is one of the most quoted Tanayim, with appearances in the vast majority of Masechtos and Rabbi Pinchas Ben Yair not so much. All of that accomplishment seems out of place in the context of his being the older one.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, other Rishonim/Geonim could have had (and held by) a different Girsa and not had the traditions of the Zohar, so that is a rather side point.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding Rabbi Pinchas Ben Yair's appearance to Rebbi in that context, I still need to investigate more, but there is no indication (that I know of) that this person is the same one or related to Rabbi Shimon. Note that in the Zohar there is a similar point (brought in <a href=\"http://files.daf-yomi.com/bookfiles/daf-al-hadaf-shabat/daf-al-hadaf-shabat177.pdf\">the link</a> above) of Rabbi Eliezar referring to Rabbi Shimon as father and Rabbi Pinchas by his first name. So this would be a further indication that there was a second one. And note that the respect there is a bit incompatible with his being a brother-in-law.</p>\n\n<p>It would be difficult to just say that he had a father-in-law and son-in-law with the same full name, but there is no particular reason that I know of to think there has to be only one Tanna across two generations with the same name.</p>\n\n<p>ועצ\"ע</p>\n\n<p>It should be pointed out that there is no <em>a priori</em> reason to really think that the Zohar and Talmud have to agree on this point, any more than the Bavli and Yerushalmi would have to agree on the relationships of a certain person, but harmonization would be preferable.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Perhaps there was more than one tanna named Pinhas ben Yair, This was spoken of in Shaar HaGilGulim by Rav Chaim Vital.</p>\n\n<p>To me though, its not clear if Rav Pinchas ben Yair was niftar or not in the Idra. Nevertheless, Rav Chaim seems to assume he was. </p>\n\n\n",

Rav Lichtenstein argues that since there is no separate Mitzva of honoring a king as there is by Talmidei Chachamim (Chinukh #222) [or parents (Chinukh #27)] but rather it is a part of the nature and Mitzva of appointing a <em>king</em> as opposed to any other leader, a pseudo-king ruling in the Diaspora would not even need to be honored there as his formal powers do not apply, as above.</p>\n\n<p>Since, as he notes in footnote 6, the Yerushalmi (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/r/r4803.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Horayot 3</a>:2) seems clear that kings can gain and lose their status depending on de facto leadership (eg. through a temporary coup, such as with David and Avshalom), it seems to me that, combining all the above, the individual in your question would no longer have the status of a king, neither regarding his powers nor the obligation to honor him, since he no longer has any de facto control of any territory in the Land of Israel. (It may still be appropriate to honor him if he is the de facto ruler in his current location (or perhaps just as a remembrance of the past), but it is not part of the formal biblical rule of kingship so much as part of Dina deMalchuta.)</p>\n\n<p>[I don't see anywhere where he deals with the fact that some laws (eg. those in 2:2) of honoring a king still apply after the king dies and is (presumably therefore) no longer king. Perhaps we should distinguish between a king who dies in office and one who leaves before dying, or perhaps between those laws honoring the person of the king versus those that honor his office. These would of course also then be relevant in understanding II Samuel 16:20-23 and 20:3.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Note that Zerubavel was not treated as a king even though he would have become the king (as the desxcendant of malchus bais David) had they been completely redeemed. Yehoyachin was still regarded as the king (at least in terms of continuing the Davidic line). I point out the descent through Zerubavel in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/31776/which-kings-must-moshiach-descend-from/37097#37097\">which kings must Moshiach descend from?</a></p>\n\n<p>Thus we see that Yehoyachin was still considered a king and Zerubavel and his descendants were potential kings.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>All descendants of the house of David have Kingship as an inheritance. This is the plain meaning from the \"Samcheinu\" prayer said following the reading of the haftorah each Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>\"We rejoice HaShem, our G-d, in regard to Eliyahu the prophet and in regard to the Kingship of the house of David, Your anointed. He will come speedily and our hearts will rejoice about his throne upon which no stranger sits. And no others will inherit his glory. Because with Your holy name, You swore to him that his candle will never extinguish ever. Blessed are You, HaShem, shield of David.</p>\n\n<p>This inheritance by the descendants of the Davidic line is in all places and all times.</p>\n\n<p>Anointing is something that is done for non-Davidic line kings or when there is more than one potential king making claim in the Davidic line. The anointing, which was generally done by a prophet, resolves any question as to who becomes King.</p>\n\n<p>What your question seems to be more directed toward is whether someone has the \"din of Malchut\" during exile. Meaning, are the halachic obligations of the King's  subjects present during exile? And if so, are the legal consequences for failure to meet those obligations also present?</p>\n\n<p>According to Sefer Yechi HaMelech, based upon the teachings from the Lubavitcher Rebbe, this is one of the primary distinctions between the status of \"Presumed to be Moshiach\" and \"Moshiach with certainty\". The final halachic status of \"Moshiach with certainty\" carries with it the obligations of the subjects toward the King and the consequences of failure to perform those obligations.</p>\n\n<p>Another consideration with this question is in regard to when the nation is required to appoint the King. This is discussed by the Tzemach Tzedek in Sefer Derech Mitzvotecha and also by HaRav Yitzchok Ginzburg in Sefer Malchut Yisroel. Although this is associated with the return of the Jewish nation into the land of Israel as the ruling government, it is generally held that thcommandment becomes obligatory when the majority of the global Jewish population resides within the borders of the land of Israel. This is one of the compelling ideas of the current time. Because each year, the census in Israel shows we are extremely close to that tipping point, if it hasn't actually been achieved already.</p>\n\n<p>The general laws for both Kings from the house of David and those of other tribes can be found in Mishnah Torah, Laws of Kings and their Wars, chapter 1, laws 7-9.</p>\n\n<p>7: \"Once a king is anointed, he and his descendents are granted the monarchy until eternity, for the monarchy is passed down by inheritance, as Deuteronomy 17:20 states 'Thus, he the king and his descendents will prolong their reign in the midst of Israel.'</p>\n\n<p>If the king leaves only a young son, the monarchy should be held for him until he matures, as Yehoyada did for Yoash. The order of inheritance of the monarchy is the same as that governing the inheritance of property. An older son is given precedence over a younger one.</p>\n\n<p>Not only the monarchy, but all other positions of authority and appointments in Israel, are transferred to one's children and grandchildren as inheritances forever.</p>\n\n<p>The above applies if the knowledge and the fear of G-d of the son is equivalent to that of his ancestors. If his fear of G-d is equivalent to theirs but not his knowledge, he should be granted his father's position and given instruction. However, under no circumstance should a person who lacks the fear of G-d be appointed to any position in Israel, even though he possesses much knowledge.\"</p>\n\n<p>8: \"If a prophet appoints a king from any other tribe of Israel and that king follows the path of Torah and mitzvot and fights the wars of God, he is considered as a king, and all the commandments associated with the monarchy apply to him.</p>\n\n<p>Although the kingship was primarily given to David and one of his descendents will be serving as king, there is halachic legitimacy to the rule of other kings. Behold, Achiyah of Shilo appointed Jeroboam and told him (I Kings 11:38): 'And it shall be that if you obey all that I command you... I will build you a faithful house as I built for David.' Similarly, Achiyah told him (ibid.: 36): 'To his (David's) son, I will grant one tribe, so that David, My servant, will always have sovereignty before Me in Jerusalem.'\"</p>\n\n<p>9: \"The kings of the Davidic dynasty will prevail forever (II Samuel 7:16): 'Your throne shall be established forever.' In contrast, should a king arise from other Israelites, the monarchy will eventually cease from his descendents. For behold, Jeroboam was told: I Kings 11:39 'I will afflict the House of David.... but not forever.'\"</p>\n\n\n",

For, \"His judgments are throughout the world\" (Psalms 105:7), and the judgments of God are in accordance with the laws of the Torah. Therefore, just as we must understand the words of the Torah and delve into it, so too we must contemplate all the events that take place in the world and find their basis according to the judgments of the Torah. However, a person must not rely upon his own understanding, for his intellect is insufficient to understand the knowledge of the One Above; rather, it is necessary to listen to he who is recognized in the Oral Torah <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1216/lazera\">2</a>. This is the intent when the verse adds, \"ask your father and he will recount to you, your elders and they will tell you.\" This is akin to the fact that it is impossible to understand the stories of the holy Scriptures from the texts alone, except with the commentaries of the Sages.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכדי להבין דברי ימי עולם (וועלט געשיכטע) מסרה לנו התורה מפתח גדול, לידע את הציר אשר עליו תסוב ההנהגה העליונה בעולם, והוא בכתוב מיד, \"בהנחל עליון גוים בהפרידו בני אדם יצב גבולות עמים למספר בני ישראל כי חלק ה' עמו יעקב חבל נחלתו,\" ופירושו כי מאחר שמובן מאליו כי כל היצורים נבראו לעשות רצון קונם, ומכל סוגי הנמצאים העיקר הוא המין האנושי, ומהמין הזה העיקר הוא עם ישראל שהם חלק ה' ועבדיו... ונמצא שתכלית כל הבריאה היא רק בשביל ישראל, וכמו שפירש\"י (בראשית א:א) \"בראשית — בשביל ישראל שנקראו ראשית.\" וא\"כ גם המעשים הנעשים בעולם תכליתם רק בשביל ישראל. וזה מפורש בכתוב (צפניה ג:ו-ז) \"הכרתי גוים נשמו פנותם החרבתי חוצותם... אמרתי אך תיראי אותי תקחי מוסר.\" ומזה למדנו שאין פורענות באה לעולם אלא בשביל ישראל (יבמות סג.). ולדוגמה, גבולות העמים והמדינות בשנים האחרונות שנקבעו אחרי המלחמה, צריך להבין ולזכור כי טרם שנכתבו בוורסייל כבר נכתבו ונחתמו בבי\"ד של מעלה. ושמה עיקר השקפתם היא רק בשביל ישראל, לטובתם או לפורענותם להוכיחם, כמו שכתוב \"הוי אשור שבט אפי\" (ישעי' י:ה).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to understand world events, the Torah gave us an important key by which to know the axis upon which the Heavenly conduct of the world turns, and this is in the verses immediately following, “When the One Above divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel. For His people is His portion, Jacob is the portion of His inheritance.” The explanation of this verse is as follows. It is self-evident that all creatures were created to serve the will of their Owner. From all the categories of existence, the primary is the human race, and from this race, the primary is the people of Israel, for they are the “portion” of God and they are His servants. … The purpose of creation is only for the sake of Israel, as Rashi <a href=\"http://shesileizeisim.blogspot.com/2012/01/why-study-jewish-history-part-4-zechor.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3</a> comments [on Genesis 1:1], \"B’reshis – for the sake of Israel which is called reshis (first).\" Therefore, everything that happens in the world is only for the sake of Israel. This is explicit in Scripture (Zephaniah 3:6-7), \"I have cut off the nations, their towers are desolate, I have destroyed their streets… I said, 'Just fear me, accept admonishment.'\" From this [verse] we learn that no suffering comes to the world except for the sake of Israel (Talmud, Yevamos 63a). For example, by the setting of the boundaries between nations and countries that was done after the war,[4] it is necessary to understand and remember that before they were set in Versailles, they had already been written and sealed in the Heavenly Court. And there the primary outlook is only for the sake of Israel, either for their benefit or to afflict them for the purpose of admonition, as it is written, “Woe to Assyria, the rod of my anger” (Isaiah 10:5).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וזהו שכתוב \"יצב גבולות עמים\"—תמיד בכל דור—\"למספר בני ישראל\" (דברים לב:ח), והטעם \"כי חלק ה' עמו,\" כי ישראל לבדו הוא חלק ה' ולא שאר האומות, וע\"כ כל ההנהגה העליונה מתאימה לצורכי עם ישראל. ואף כי דעתנו קצרה מלהבין איזה יחס יש בין צורכי ישראל לגבולות איים רחוקים בקצוי ארץ, אבל קורא הדורות מראש יודע שיש בזה איזה צורך לישראל בהוה או בעתיד, כמ\"ש הרמב\"ם (פיהמ\"ש, הקדמה) שלפעמים נבנה ארמון גדול ומפואר, וכל תכלית מציאותו הוא כי לאחר מאה שנה יעבור איש חסיד בעת זרם מטר ויכנס תחת גג השער מהארמון הזה לחסות ממטר או משלג</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is what is meant by the verse, \"He set the boundaries of the peoples\" — continually, in every generation — \"according to the number of the children of Israel.\" The reason for this is, \"For His people is His portion.\" Israel alone is the portion of God, and not the other nations, and therefore, all of the Heavenly direction of the world is directed for the needs of the nation of Israel. Even though our understanding is insufficient to grasp what connection there is between the needs of Israel and the boundaries of distant isles at the ends of the earth, but \"He Who knows the generations from the beginning\" [5] knows that there is some necessity for the Jewish people, in the present or future. As Maimonides writes, sometimes a great and glorious palace will be built, and the entire purpose of its existence is because a century later a pious man will pass by during a rainstorm and he will go under the roof of the palace gate to shelter himself from the rain or snow.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Moshe_Hillel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reb Yakov Hillel</a> (a great mikubol).

If you do accomplish a valid conversion, then certainly it was meant to be and you had a Jewish soul all along.

Most converts don't. If you continue the Noahide path for now, there are many organizations and resources available. As you probably already know, there is a Noahide prayerbook (siddur) now, called Service From the Heart.

There is a saying, \"If you always do what you always did, you will always get what you always got.\" That is applicable here. Constantly feeling Jewish will keep you constantly feeling Jewish. Taking certain actions to commit yourself to a purpose through a physical action, is innovating a resolution you have only thought of earlier.

The more lenient ones argue that the 13 attributes should be said as one reads the Torah, with the correct tune and trop.</p>\n<p>In context:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ה:</strong> אֵין הַיָּחִיד רַשַּׁאי לוֹמַר שְׁלֹשׁ עֶשְׂרֵה מִדּוֹת דֶּרֶךְ תְּפִלָּה וּבַקָּשַׁת רַחֲמִים, דְּדָבָר שֶׁבַּקְּדֻשָּׁה הֵם; אֲבָל אִם בָּא לְאָמְרָם דֶּרֶךְ <em>(ה)</em> קְרִיאָה בְּעָלְמָא, אוֹמְרָם.‏<br/> <strong>הגה</strong>: <em>וְכֵן אֵין לְיָחִיד לוֹמַר סְלִיחוֹת אוֹ</em> (ו) <em>וַיַּעֲבֹר</em> (מַהֲרִי''ל בְּשֵׁם אוֹר זָרוּעַ). ‏</p>\n<p><strong>באר היטב</strong>  <em>(ה) קריאה</em>. בניגון ובטעמים. כשאומר ויקרא בשם ה' יש להפסיק מעט בין שם לה'. אין לומר האדרת והאמונה בצבור כ''א ביה''כ. אין לומר קודם חצות לילה שום סליחה ולא י''ג מדות בשום פנים לעולם חוץ מביה''כ. אחרונים עיין מ''א:‏<br/>\n<strong>באר היטב</strong> <em>(ו</em>) ויעבור. כ' הב''ח זה אינו אלא משום ויעבור אבל סליחות ותחנונים בלא ויעבור אין איסור בדבר <strong>אבל הט''ז כתב דאפי' סליחות בלא ויעבור אסור</strong> משום שמזכיר בסליחות וזכור לנו היום ברית שלש עשרה וכן בהרבה סליחות שימצא י''ג מדות אותם אין לאומר' אפי' בלא ויעבור אבל אותם סליחות שאין נזכר בהם י''ג מדות ודאי יכול לאומרם ע''כ: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, those Selichot written in Aramaic should not be said without a Minyan, as the Mishna Berurah says (תקפא ד)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן אותם הבקשות שהן בלשון תרגום כגון מחי ומסי וכו' ומרן די בשמיא וכו' לא יאמר כשאין שם מנין עשרה. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, since it's a 1,000-year-old Minhag, ignoring it should not be taken lightly.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is free will something that the Torah has to tell me I have? Is it a chiddush?",
    "content": "# Is free will something that the Torah has to tell me I have? Is it a chiddush?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The most oft quoted <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16615/how-do-we-know-that-we-have-free-will\">proof from the Torah</a> that humans have free will is a pasuk in Devarim 30:19. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַעִדֹתִי בָכֶם הַיּוֹם, אֶת-הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֶת-הָאָרֶץ--הַחַיִּים\n  וְהַמָּוֶת נָתַתִּי לְפָנֶיךָ, הַבְּרָכָה וְהַקְּלָלָה; וּבָחַרְתָּ,\n  בַּחַיִּים--לְמַעַן תִּחְיֶה, אַתָּה וְזַרְעֶךָ</p>\n  \n  <p>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have\n  set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore\n  choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Firstly, I would like to know if this is a <em>chiddush</em>? In other words, without the Torah telling me that I have free will, would I not be able to reach that conclusion on my own?</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, and this seems related to me, can a person tell <strong>when</strong> they have exercised their free will? (Not everything a person does or seems to choose is in fact a free-will choice. <em>Ramchal in Derech Hashem</em>)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Yes, it is a chidush. Many people use the escape route, to avoid taking the responsibility of their actions. \nFor example, someone might say, \"I was very mean to my wife, but I couldn't help it, because G-d knows what I will do and He didn't stop me, so it's not my fault, and He allowed me to do it.\" However, we must realize that even though G-d knows what we will do, that does not mean that He made us do it. He truly gives us Free Choice in most areas, and we can't sneak out the back door. Therefore, the Torah tells us that we have free will as a new piece of information, because many would have thought that all is predestined. Along comes the Torah to inform us that we must be mature and realize that no one placed a gun to our heads and said, \"You better do this bad action!\" He gave us Choice and we used it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Yaakov Weinberg said that it is <em>not</em> a chiddush that you have free will.</p>\n\n<p>R' Weinberg asked the question why the Rambam put the concept of free will in Hilchos Teshuva, as opposed to in Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah.  His answer was that free will only becomes a relevant discussion when it comes time for Teshuva.  When a person is in the act, it is self-evident and obvious to everyone that they have free will.  They can sense for themselves that they are making the choice that they are making.  It's only later, when the time comes to take responsibility for their actions, that a person starts to try to explain their way out of it, and say that they really didn't have any choice, and it was beyond their control.  The Rambam therefore, in Hilchos Teshuva, dismisses that argument.</p>\n\n<p>As to what R' Yaakov would say is the chiddush of the posuk in light of the above, there are many possible answers, but I'll give one that I remember.  The Torah gave a multi-layered choice: Life and blessing, and death and curse.  The Torah only tells us to choose life, leaving out blessing.  Because the two are not synonymous concepts - one is to see Torah as a positive thing, an important thing, something beneficial.  The other is to see Torah as life itself.  The Torah tells us to choose life - choose the path in which learning and living Torah is life itself.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If you read the quoted pasuk carefully, you'll see that it isn't actually <em>teaching</em> that man has free will as if that were something that the Torah needs to teach. It's merely saying that, <em>given that man has the freedom to choose</em>, I'm telling you that the decisions that you make are ones of life and death, blessing and curse - so choose the path of life!</p>\n\n<p>The reason why this verse is brought as a proof that, according to the Torah, man has free will, is merely because <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16615/how-do-we-know-that-we-have-free-will\">some people question</a> (or even deny) its existence. Thus, this verse is used to show that the Torah was working with the background assumption that man has free will. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the Ramchal's opinion: in Derech Hashem (I, ch. 5) he does write that some decisions may be 'forced' מצד גזרה עליונה לשכרו או לענשו, in order to reward or punish him. It seems like those actions, though, would be recognizable to the person as actions that don't originate in his will, but from external forces (like a reflex). It could be that this is the Ramchal's intention in the continuation of that paragraph:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>במה שהוא נמשך אחר הגזרה שעליו, יהיה משפטו כשאר עניני העולם, שתנועתם מלמעלה למטה, כפי מה שיניעום הכחות העליונים. ובמה שמצד בחירתו, תהיה תנועתו מלמטה למעלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ramchal also writes (Derech Chochmah 12) that some actions of a person aren't a result of free will, but of מה שטבעו מכריחו, או קיבוצו המדיני - his nature, or his societal/political surroundings. I'm not entirely sure how one would be able to tell this from acting upon other desires according to the Ramchal, but it could be that he'd agree with Rav Dessler's explanations in his many discussions of free will in the books Michtav Me'eliyahu. In a few places he writes that a person's point of free will is where he recognizes what he's supposed to do, but has a perfectly equally strong desire to do what he knows is wrong as he does to do what's right. In what's probably the most succinct formulation (vol. 5 pg 500): בחירה אמיתית מתרחשת רק כשהאמת שהוא מכיר וכח יצרו מתנגשים בקרבו שוה בשוה</p>\n\n\n",

It seems that according to the Ramban it is close to a d'Oraaisa to show the Torah to everyone. It is interesting to note that he says the chazan is the one  who does hagabah,and another point of interest is that he holds women also must see the Torah as well( which can be hard for them due to the mechetzia).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The sefer Piskei Teshuvos Siman 134 #5 Says the following (I'm paraphrasing):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The language of the Shulchan Aruch is \"Show the writing of the sefer\n  torah to the people that are standing to his right and to his left and\n  turn it to the front of him and to the back of him etc\"</p>\n  \n  <p>This is the language of Meseches Sofrim and is giving the halacha for\n  their times when there minhag was to do hagbah with the writing facing\n  outward toward the people and away from the one holding the sefer torah\n  (like the Sefardim do nowadays). Therefore when the magbiah turns to\n  the people standing to his right he is turning the sefer torah to his\n  right as well and is fulfilling (very well) \"all turnings that you\n  turn, turn to your right\".</p>\n  \n  <p>However, according to the minhag of the Ashkenazim, there are a few ways\n  that hagbah can be done 1) first turn to your right and show the\n  writing to the people standing on the left (because you must turn\n  right first) and then reverse (turn left) and show the writing to the\n  people standing on the right (and you have to make sure that people\n  standing on the Eastern side of the shul see the writing too). 2) Do a\n  complete turn by turning right until you're back in your original\n  position.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't remember where I saw it but I read somewhere that you can fulfill what it says in Meseches Sofrim and \"All turnings...\" according to minhag Ashkenaz. This is how- after you pick up the sefer torah, don't move your feet but turn your hands/arms in a way that the writing is shown to the people on the right side then turn your whole body to the right doing an entire circle. (This is what I do).</p>\n\n\n",

It's death. But Jews are not now supposed to impose our religion on others; as G-d decreed that due to our sins we are exiled and our Temple and rulership has been destroyed. Incidentally, as a non-Zionist, I don't believe we have the right to establish a state, secular or Jewish, in the state of Israel (almost all Zionists believe in a western secular state...) prior to the Messiah's arrival, but that's neither here nor there.

The girsa in Horios 12a is to look at the simanim. In situations where one cannot eat the siman, we rely on simply looking at them. This was the Ben Ish Chai's practice when a certain one of the simanim was too bug infested to be allowed to be eaten.</p>\n\n<p>Being that the link was to a human shrunken head I will only adress that. See the Yad Ephraim printed in the standard Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah in the begining of Siman 117 where he rules that mummies, which were thought to have medicinal properties, are assur bihanaah. See also the end of siman 142 where the Shulchan Aruch rules that looking at something for pleasure is called getting hanaah, and although the Shulchan Aruch is discussing avoda zara, the Shach there tells us that other issurim are even more simple to us as being assur.\nAssuming that the looking at the item for a good siman is hanaah, it would be assur to use the shrunken human head.</p>\n\n<p>And besides, ew. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Basically, what kind of a head are you talking about. If you mean a human shrunken head, then it is subject to all the rules of a  body of a human being.

That one experiences permanent gehenna? That one's soul goes to heaven but does not experience the resurrection of the dead? That one's soul must reincarnate again?</p>\n\n<p>The reason I ask is that the standard belief appears cruel, and inconsistent with Hashem's mercy. According to some versions of the belief cited above, if an atheist is a good person and never breaks any of the other Noahide laws (besides the requirement to believe), or if a person follows all the other laws but is a polytheist, he will not experience the afterlife. Isn't this cruel and unjust? It seems Hashem would have mercy and allow non-Jews to have an afterlife consistent with what they deserve based on the preponderance of their deeds, as He does with Jews. </p>\n\n<p>I often hear that unlike Islam and Christianity, Judaism doesn't belief all non-believers go to hell. But this belief is very similar to that.</p>\n\n<p>I note that \"has no share in the world to come\" phrases are extremely common in rabbinic literature, including the Talmud, and it seems extremely unlikely we are required to believe in them all. For example, Rabbi Akiva said that one who sings Song of Songs in a disrespectful way has no share in the world to come. Yet few people would literally believe one forfeit's one's afterlife for singing a single song the wrong way. Many of these statements sound like they are meant as exaggerated ways of emphasizing the importance of something, rather than a literal statement of cause-and-effect regarding the afterlife. In any case, Rav S.R. Hirsch writes that we need only accept hashkafic statements (other than main tenets of belief) in rabbinic literature, including that Talmud, that accord with our reason and intellect.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In the beginning of cheilek we are told a Jew who believes in techiyas hameisim but does not believe that it is hinted to in the Torah, does not rise from the dead when it happens. Rashi explains who needs him and his beleifs. Meaning, as far as just payback from Hashem goes, you get what you give. The Rambam explains that a good nonbeliever jew gets his reward in this world. Either he or his kids down the line will get paid back for all his and their good that they did, for the sake of goodness. Its only when someone does something on a Godly spiritual level that they get their payback in the Godly spiritual realm. Again, you get what you give. An atheist gets the reward deserving of an atheist, and a believer gets the reward of a believer. This is not crule at all. This is justice on the level expected from the person awaiting that justice.</p>\n\n\n",

In practice the application of such a punishment can only be carried out by humans whose system of justice is nearly perfect, a situation which has not existed for some time or never existed at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why then did G-d instruct Jews in this manner? Do I have to interpret this as meaning that the old Jewish society is considered nearly perfect (which I have a hard time believing in the light of the mistakes that were made as described in the Torah)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I'd like to answer along two dimensions, one about capital punishment and one more broad.</p>\n\n<p>First, it is possible for the conditions to be met under which capital punishment can apply.  Tractate Sanhedrin in the talmud discusses in great detail the relevant laws.  We know that sentences of capital punishment <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/7739/472\">were carried out</a> in the past.  They were rare, with Rabbi Eleazar famously saying in the talmud (Makkot 1:10) that a court that executes once in 70 years is bloodthirsty (others say once in seven years).</p>\n\n<p>Because these laws <em>can</em> be applied -- not today, but in the past and maybe in the future -- the torah needs to give them and we need to learn them.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the broader point: the torah sometimes gives us laws that we cannot carry out.  According to tractate Sanhedrin (h/t user6591, DoubleAA), the laws of the stubborn and rebellious son and of the idolatrous city were never carried out.  (However, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/7751/472\">some disagree</a>.)  So why were these laws given?  I was taught that, according to those who say it never happened, it's so that we will have the merit of torah study in learning it.  Even if we do not <em>apply</em> a law, God had some reason for wanting us to learn it -- some principle we can derive from it, perhaps.  God, being perfect, gave us a perfect torah, even if we imperfect people cannot understand <em>why</em> in some cases.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I am sorry that I don't remember who I heard this from, but I recall learning that the idea behind the death penalties was to show how serious the matter under discussion is.  Violating Shabbos, for example, has a death penalty, even though it is almost never carried out, in order to teach that observance of Shabbos is more valuable than one's life.</p>\n\n<p>The penalties are assigned in order to show how significant these ideas are.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It is possible for someone to be mistakenly executed for a crime he was innocent of. The system is reconciled by the belief that God knows that the person executed was guilty anyway of some other sin or otherwise deserved to die.</p>\n\n<p>For example: see the story of \"Vinegar son of Wine\" in Bava Metzia 83b. (This story, however, did not involve a beit din, but a Rabbi who had been appointed sheriff by the Roman Government. It still works, nonetheless)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://halakhah.com/babamezia/babamezia_83.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://halakhah.com/babamezia/babamezia_83.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

I understand that people don't want to do things until the last minute. However, in my opinion, the earlier one starts putting his Sukkah up, the less enthusiasm one has for the mitzvah. Why? If one puts his <em>Sukkah</em> up earlier, it appears that it's a burden on him that he wants to get done with as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What does <em>halacha</em> say about this? </li>\n<li>When should one start putting up his <em>Sukkah</em>?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Ramma both in siman 624 (end of hilchos Yom Kipur) and in the begining of hilchos succah siman 625 says to begin right after Yom Kippur so as to go from mitzvah to mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT</p>\n\n<p>The seffer Minhag Yisroel Torah in siman 602 ois 3 brings the following. The Elya Rabba says to be carefull not to build the succah before Yom Kippur because going out to the Succah is like going to exile and if one gets a psak din on Yom Kippur to go to galus, he would have been able to fulfill the gzeira by building the succah, if its already built, he can't use this. He brings from the Shaarei Tshuva however that says building the Succah is not what the Medrash means about a Succah being like galus, sitting in it is. So it would be better to act in accordance with the Levush and build it before Yom kippur so as to have more Zechussim. He then adds on in the from the Birkei Yosef to at least put the walls up before Yom Kippur so as to get the zchus like the Levush and still be yotzeh the Elya Rabba. </p>\n\n<p>The seffer then goes on to quote some Chassidish sfarim, how some would start building the succah on the 6th day of the aserres yomei tshuva because the slichos of that day mentions sitting under Hashem's shade. Also another minhag was to start preparing the decorations before Yom Kippur, but not the actual Succah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Based on <a href=\"http://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Building_the_Sukkah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When should one build the Sukkah?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The pious are careful to build to begin building the Sukkah on Motzei Yom Kippur and finish it the next day in order to go from one\nmitzvah (Yom Kippur) to another (Sukkot).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If there is a shabbat between Yom Kippur and Sukkot some poskim say that there is an obligation to build it before that shabbat. Avnei\nNezer 459 writes that this obligation isn't just because of zrizin\nmakdimin limitzvot and therefore it is an obligation. However, the\nMinchat Elazar 4:55 writes that this is not an obligation but just the\npreferred option, and this is the conclusion of Yalkut Yosef page 118\nand Chazon Ovadia Sukkot page 99.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Preferably, one should build it for himself, but if this isn't possible he should appoint an agent to do it for him and strive to at\nleast take part in the building in some form even if this means\nmissing out on more learning time.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If a Sukkah was set up with the S'chach from before 30 days before sukkot and it wasn't made for the purpose of the mitzvah of Sukkot one\nmust change or improve one thing (such as putting down S'chach) of an\narea a Tefach by a Tefach or the whole width even if it's of minimal\nlength (or vice versa). However, if it was made within 30 days of\nSukkot or was made for the express purpose of Sukkot it's fit even\nwithout any change. However, if the Sukkah was originally built for\nSukkot and stands unchanged year to year it requires some change the\neach year. This is only if the S'chach was put in advance but if just\nthe walls were putup in advance and not the S'chach there's no issue.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From these rules, I infer that it is preferable to start after Yom Kippur, but there doesn't seem to be a problem starting before. One year, my shul put up the succah before Tish'a B'Av. Yes, I thought it was bizarre, but they explained that the shul's maintenance supervisor, who constructed the succah each year, was going a long vacation, and he wasn't planning on returning until just before Succot, not leaving enough time to do it. (Separate question, perhaps, re the maintenance guy wasn't Jewish...)</p>\n<p>My understanding is that the succah isn't complete (i.e., it's not an official Succah) without the schach. So, based on rule 4, above, I believe that if you put the scach on after Yom Kippur, you're fulfilling the technical terms of \"building a succah\", no??</p>\n\n\n",

Although this custom has no source or basis in Halachah - indeed, it may be halachically objectionable - it has nevertheless become almost universally accepted.</p>\n<p>Rav Yaakov Emden reports that he, personally, objects to this custom. Indeed, he rules that if a woman does not have the definite custom of reciting shehecheyanu at candle-lighting time, she should not do so. Nevertheless, he says, his wife - who saw this custom in her parents' home - does so, and he does not object. Since it is not halachically forbidden, he does not feel compelled to reject her minhag which she witnessed in her home.</p>\n<p>Surely, Rav Yaakov Emden was aware that upon marriage, a woman ought to change her customs to follow her husband's. Still, he did not insist that his wife abandon her mother's custom and adopt his own. Perhaps Rav Yaakov Emden held that customs pertaining to candle-lighting are an exception to the general rule. Since, as mentioned above, our Sages made it the woman's responsibility to light candles, it becomes \"her\" mitzvah, to be followed according to her customs. Apparently, it is not incumbent upon the husband to insist that his wife alter the customs which she learned from her mother.

Why do we care that the document was lost and then found? if the borrower and lender wanted to defraud the purchaser, they could do so even without \"losing\" the document first. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Even if such a database existed, in the case of the Gemara it would not have helped the purchaser.  The Gemara (12b) sets up the concern of this case to be that the document was written, but then not given to the borrower until later, in which case a purchase made between the time it was written and the time it was given would in reality not be subject to the lien, but the loan document would imply that it is. (However, there is a second explanation brought in the Gemara - 13b)</p>\n<p>In any event, the impression I have gotten is that there was no formal documentation or registry of these kinds of things (liens).  The fact that a buyer was expected to know about a lien is only because of the \"kol\" - the tumult that is created by the sale.</p>\n<p>In answer to your final question, the Gemara (12b) asks that very question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אי הכי כל שטרי דאתו לקמן ניחוש להו הכי כל שטרי לא ריעי הני ריעי</p>\n<p>Q: If so, we should suspect all documents of this!  A: All documents are not suspicious</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הני ריעי - הואיל ונפל אתרע דיש לומר אם היה כשר היה נזהר בו:</p>\n<p>Since the borrower dropped the document, the document is under suspicion, since if the document were valid, the borrower would have been more careful with the document.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we are concerned that the borrower dropped the document because the borrower knew the document wasn't valid.</p>\n\n\n",

Joe Lieberman was sworn in on, seeing as he is fromm.</p>\n\n<p>Note 2: While according to Koren's catalogue, a first edition of their Tana\"ch is used for swearings-in of Jewish officials in Israel, it does not mention whether this is done by religious politicians or only secular ones.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Article 2 section 1, clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution</a> allows the president to use the term \"affirm\" instead of \"swear\" when s/he (O.K., we haven't yet had a female U.S. president, but it will happen, some day.) takes the oath.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitution also does not require the use of a Bible or any book, whatsoever. Theodore Roosevelt did not use a Bible, and John Quincy Adams swore on a book of law. See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States#Option_of_taking_an_oath_or_an_affirmation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> for additional info.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know what the rule is regarding Senators, governor, or mayor, etc. However, since freedom of religion is a strongly held U.S. law, I assume that the same rules applying to presidential swearings would apply to everything else.</p>\n\n<p>You may want to email Mr. Lieberman directly, regarding both what he's done and what the U.S. (and perhaps, Jewish) law is. From my understanding, even though he is quite busy, he does eventually answer such questions. FYI, he is no longer senator, so, perhaps, he is not as busy! (You can relay him Shanah Tovah from me, too :-)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>My problem with this question is that it presumes that Federal employees or elected officials must be \"sworn in.\"  The rabbi who was m'gaier me, Rabbi Bertram Leff, said that I should avoid taking \"oaths\" or \"swearing\" whether in becoming a Federal employee or being a witness in court.  Fortunately, Federal law gives me that option.  The text of the \"oath of office\" is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since I can \"affirm\" there is no shavua here.</p>\n\n<p>The second assumption that bothers me is that one is required to swear on a Bible or some other religious tome.  Most Federal employees are sworn in without a Bible, because there is usually a room full of us taking the oath at the same time.  The use of Bibles is for photo-opportunity occassions, like the swearing in of an elected official or a Presidential appointee.  Also members of the military often use a Bible for the photo-op of their taking the oath on commission, enlistment or reenlistment. I've attended some such swearing in ceremonies -- the last one for an Orthodox Jew who was an assistant secretary of Treasury.  As I recall, he used a Tanach -- but he just as well didn't use anything.   Since there is no obligation to use a Bible there is no issue about choice of religious text from the Federal point of view.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Federal and state courts permit a witness to declare or affirm, rather than swear, that they are testifying truthfully or risking penalty of purgery or making a false statement to the Government, whichever is applicable.  Given that, use of the court's Bible, or substitution of one's own is irrelevant.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I recall seeing a video of an Orthodox Australian official being sworn in while holding an ArtScroll Tanach</p>\n\n\n",

For example, in <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/cons-seasonal-schach.htm\">this</a> guide from the Star-K to using sechach mats, they require that sechach-eligible measures be taken to make it so that the mat would not fly off in a normal wind before one ties sechach down to preserve it in the case of an abnormal wind. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How, practically, should one assess what would or would not happen under \"normal wind\" conditions?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I suppose one way would be to experiment with different setups over the years and see what happens, but that seems excessively risky, time-consuming, and unreliable due to small sample size. Also, the results would be completely unavailable the first few years. Another method could be to get someone who already has a great deal of sukka experience to assess the situation, but given that every site is different, and sukkas come in all different designs, it would seem to be difficult to get a reliable assessment for one sukka and site based on anecdotal experience in others. I expect that a <em>full-blown</em> engineering study would do the trick, but it seems unlikely that that's required, as \"the Torah wasn't given to the ministering angels\" (Berachot 25b), a class of which engineers are probably a subset.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>From your assessment about the impracticality of observing and experimenting it seems your understanding of ruach meyzuyah is a wind that under normal circumstances can and might eventually blow, I would suggest that this is not the case. Rather, Ruach metzuyah means a wind that does blow. Practically constantly. </p>\n\n<p>First of all is the Mechaber in hilchos succah siman 630 siff 10 about using hanging trees like willows as succah walls the mechaber says they must be tied well and be strong 'so the ruach metzuyah doesn't blow them CONSTANTLY'.</p>\n\n<p>There are two other places that discuss ruach metzuyah and I think we should all be willing to assume its all the same wind. </p>\n\n<p>In Taanis 3b we find Rabbeinu Chananel and Rashi explaining the ruach metzuyah in the Gemara means it is 'eino ne'etzarim' never withheld, much like dew, and unlike rain.</p>\n\n<p>Also in Choshen Mishpat siman 418 which discusses the mazik called fire we find a term in siff 9 'ruach sheino metzuya tamid'. The Sma quotes the Magid Mishnah to explain 'ruach sheino metzuya means (a wind) that the world does not have constantly, but rather only at times, even though it comes often. And we don't even need to mention a hurricane that only blows from time to time'. </p>\n\n<p>The normal wind when you step outside is called ruach metzuyah. Put your schach up and if it doesn't get blow down almost immediately, you are good to go. The wind gust is the ruach sheino metzuya about which you don't need to worry. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/cons-seasonal-schach.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Star K article</a> states: (highlighted words are mine)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a normal <strong>prevailing wind</strong> (ruach metzuya) can blow the schach\n  off the sukkah, one may not tie the schach down to hold it in place.\n  The reason is that an item which is not kosher for schach (e.g.\n  string) may not be used to hold down kosher schach. Instead, one must\n  place a wooden beam (e.g. 2x4) on top of the schach which is resting\n  on the walls thereby sandwiching the schach between the beam and the\n  top of the walls. This beam should be placed perpendicular to the\n  bamboo sticks, so that the beam would hold down the sticks without the\n  presence of the fishing wire. Once this is done, one may then tie a\n  string around the schach to anchor and protect it from falling off in\n  a <strong>gusting wind</strong> (ruach she'ayna metzuya).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't think you are required to take an anemometer to calculate this. I think the term \"prevailing\" applies to your location. If you placed your Succah atop Mt. Washington, NH (Thanks @DoubleAA!!) (assuming it's not too cold for you, then), where it is almost always windy with frequent winds above 40 MPH, that's the prevailing wind, there. If you live near the ocean where strong sea breezes are common, at say, 20 mph, that's your prevailing wind. In most inland NE U.S. metro areas, during October the \"prevailing wind\" on most days is calm to under 15 mph. In most cases, such a wind would not blow down a large bamboo schach mat, but if it does - then you know that's a problem. Similarly, that same bamboo mat that works fine in the metro area could not be used in your Mt. Washington succah, since it has a much stronger prevailing wind.</p>\n\n\n",

It isn't very popular, I assume due to availability, but one year they had them (well, a lamb's head) in the local store, but I was unable to find any way to prepare it in a way that would be edible.</p>\n\n<p>How do you cook a ram's head for eating on Rosh Hashana night?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>From my experience as a kosher Chef. This is quite an endeavour but not impossible. One lambs head will not provide much meat but enough for all to taste. Here is one with usage of Moroccan spices/ Sephardic flavours which go nicely with lamb and garnished with glazed apples appropriate for the holiday.\nFor the head;\n1 whole lambs head brain removed.( note you may not need salt due to the salting of the meat when Kashered)\n2 Tablespoons olive oil\n2 large brown sweet onions such as vidalia cut into  8 wedges each\n6 cloves garlic sliced \n6 sprigs of fresh thyme\n4 cups chicken stock\n3 bay leaves\n8 black peppercorns\n4 pieces of whole clove\n1 stick of cinnamon\n1 tablespoon of coriander seed\n1/2 cup of red wine vinegar</p>\n\n<p>Set oven at 350 degrees F. Rinse head well under cold water. in a roasting pan set on top of the stove heat the oil, cook the onions  until they begin to turn an amber brown. Turn off the heat and add the garlic, thyme, chicken stock, bay, clove, cinnamon,coriander seed, peppercorns and vinegar.Place the head on to the onions. cover with parchment paper and a tight fitting lid or aluminium foil securely so not to lose the liquid inside pan. Cook for 2.5 hours until cheek meat is fork tender.</p>\n\n<p>For the glazed apples; \n4 Granny smith green apples peeled, cored and cut into quarters\n2 tablespoons demarara sugar or light brown sugar\n1 tablespoon oilve oil\n4 cardamom pods crushed\n1 tablespoon coriander seed roughly crushed\n1 star anise piece crushed\n1 dried red chill such as chill di arbol crushed\n1/2 cup of strained cooking liquid from the head\n1/2 cup honey</p>\n\n<p>Toss apple in the brown sugar to coat. In a saute pan heat oil and carefully add apples in a single layer. lightly caramelize on all sides and place in the 350 degree oven  for approximately 15 minutes until  apples can be pierced easily with a knife.When ready removed apples from pan and set aside. place pan back onto stove and over a medium flame. Add the crushed spices cook for a minute or two  to release their flavours. then add strained cooking broth and honey  Bring to a boil and lower to simmer for ten minutes or until the glaze has thickened. Remove from heat and strain over roasted apples to coat. Taste and adjust with salt black pepper and vinegar if needed.  Place head onto a platter of watercress or arugula ( optional) and pour apples and glaze over the head.</p>\n\n<p>Chag Sameach</p>\n\n\n",

Then I searched and found that Jews use <em>Yad</em> when they read Torah. But I've seen many documentaries where people was reading hand-held Torah without <em>Yad</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But it seems interesting to me that I found a similar tradition in the Indian Subcontinent Hindus and Muslims, when they read their scriptures.</p>\n\n<p>I'm interested-</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>why the Jews use the <em>Yad</em>?</li>\n<li>what's the reason behind the tradition?</li>\n<li>is that only a traditional thing, not a daily Jewish lifestyle?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>wikipedia:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A yad (Hebrew: יד‎) (Yiddish: האַנט), literally, \"hand,\" is a Jewish\n  ritual pointer, popularly known as a Torah pointer, used by the reader\n  to follow the text during the Torah reading from the parchment Torah\n  scrolls. Beyond its practical usage, the yad ensures that the\n  parchment is not touched during the reading. There are several reasons\n  for this: handling the parchment renders one ritually impure and the\n  often-fragile parchment is easily damaged. Moreover, the vellum\n  parchment does not absorb ink so touching the scroll with fingers will\n  damage the lettering.[1] While not required when chanting from the\n  Torah, it is used frequently and is considered a hidur mitzvah\n  (\"embellishment of the commandment\" of reading the Torah).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having been a Torah reader for about 30 years, I can verify how easily the ink can fade or smudge if it is rubbed too hard or there is a build-up of liquid or the humidity level in the ark is too high. Too low humidity can cause the parchment to become brittle - a separate problem. Thus, when the Torah is read and people are called up, the rabbi and I encourage people to kiss the Torah on its side in the rolled up area (i.e. - non-written side that's rolled on the wooden scroll, rather than on the words themselves.</p>\n\n<p>While using the pointer is not required, i.e. - you can read by sight or pointing with your finger in the air above the parchment, I find that using the pointer helps both me and the person receiving the Torah honor better follow and locate where I am. This is esp. helpful for people with weakened vision.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a link to the Bengali expression that you found, please edit your question. It is an interesting expression, though, I'm not sure if that can be applied as a universal principle towards everything Jews do. I see the analogy to the Yad, but, Jews touch numerous holy books containing G-d's name with their bare hands.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Don't forget too that the one called up to the Torah to make the blessings must follow the ba'al koreh verbally albeit silently in fulfilling his brachah, that the blessings not be in vain or for naught. Don't forget too that many people wear glasses, or need glasses, and where the ba'al koreh reads is much easier to follow when a pointer is used. And if you were to sample in most congregations the ages of those called up for aliyot, you'd probably find the mean on the older side, for whom good vision is usually more of a problem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>a yad is used because they do not want to damage the torah e.g. smudge the ink or rip the parchment. this is because it usually takes 5 years to write the torah because if you make one mistake it cannot be used.</p>\n\n\n",

So, first, one could argue that Jews are obligated to love other monotheists, which includes Muslims; I don't think we count that as a commandment, however.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/45739/are-jews-commanded-to-love-muslims/45764?noredirect=1#comment121499_45764\">Double AA notes</a>, we are told to love the \"stranger\" because we were strangers, and we are enjoined from hating the Edomite or the Egyptian.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from that, however, there is no specific commandment to love anyone but our neighbors (alternatively translated as \"fellows\", aka other Jews).</p>\n\n<p>For the question to make sense as asked, the chronological history of the world would have to be different. Islam - that is, the religion founded by Muhammad and practiced today by that name - was established in approximately 610CE. Judaism predates Islam by well over 1500 years (depending on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/8646/5\">when</a> you <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/9044/5\">date</a> the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/8515/5\">origin</a> of \"Judaism\").</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Based on the answer of @Yishai <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/60788/what-happened-to-the-mitzvah-to-love-the-stranger-as-yourself\">here</a>: the Torah speaks in several places about loving the stranger (e.g. Leviticus 19:33) and helping him (ibid 25:35, Deuteronomy 14:21).</p>\n\n<p>A non-Jew who fits this category is called a \"<em>ger toshav</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above verses, Rambam (Melachim 10:12) writes that a \"<em>ger toshev</em>\" has to be treated with the same respect and kindness as a Jew.</p>\n\n<p>The definition of \"<em>ger toshav</em>\" according to Rambam ( <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1410.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hil. Oved Kochavim 10:</a>6) is one who accepts the 7 Noahide laws (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/40554/what-exactly-do-noahides-do/40570#40570\">here</a>. They are 1) The commitments to uphold social justice 2) A prohibition to blaspheme God 3) A prohibition against idolatry 4) prohibition of several sexual relations: certain forms of incest, homosexuality, and bestiality, 5) prohibition against murder 6) prohibition against theft 7) prohibition to consume limbs severed from a still living creature.)</p>\n\n<p>Is should be noted that if a Muslim were of the opinion that he is required to kill non-Muslims, then he would not be included in those who accept the prohibition of murder.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming that a Muslim accepts these, he ought to be included in the category of <em>ger toshav</em>, and thus Jews would be required to be gracious towards them, as with fellow Jews.</p>\n\n<p>However, Rambam adds another requirement to qualify as a <em>ger toshav</em>. In Hil. Melachim (8:11) he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּל הַמְקַבֵּל שֶׁבַע מִצְוֹת וְנִזְהָר לַעֲשׂוֹתָן הֲרֵי זֶה מֵחֲסִידֵי אֻמּוֹת הָעוֹלָם. וְיֵשׁ לוֹ חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא. וְהוּא שֶׁיְּקַבֵּל אוֹתָן וְיַעֲשֶׂה אוֹתָן מִפְּנֵי שֶׁצִּוָּה בָּהֶן הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא בַּתּוֹרָה וְהוֹדִיעָנוּ עַל יְדֵי משֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ שֶׁבְּנֵי נֹחַ מִקֹּדֶם נִצְטַוּוּ בָּהֶן.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyone who accepts the 7 commandments and makes sure to perform them is considered one of the righteous members of the nations, and he has a share in the World to Come. <strong>But that is if he accepts them and performs them since God commanded them in the Torah and informed us through Moses our master that Noahides are commanded in them.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thus to qualify, a Muslim would need to not just independently perform these, but also recognize their Mosaic source. I don't know if a Muslim would qualify, given that (please correct me if I am mistaken, they believe that the Torah was superseded by the Qur'an). However, perhaps given that they acknowledge (again, correct me if I am wrong) that Moses was a prophet, then perhaps that suffices, assuming (as specified above) that Muslims concede that aforementioned 7 laws of of Mosaic origin.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>We are to love, help, and bless those whom HaShem loves, helps, and blesses. Abraham gave gifts to his 6 sons  ( of Keturah ) and sent them east. HaShem rescued Hagar and Y'ShmaEL and blessed them. A Persian King financed the rebuilding of Yerushalayim. Another Persian King favored Hebrews and told them to protect themselves. Y'ShmaEL and his brother Yitsaq both buried their father Abraham. The Quran states that it was only sent to confirm the Tanakh. Not loving Muslims is like not loving Hebrews...same DNA,same blood type...and most important \"pure monotheism\".</p>\n\n\n",

Is there any information showing if the current Molad calculation is accurate scientifically? If it is off by how much is it off? How far off culmitavely are we now from the actual timing of the new moon?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I would recommend having a look at <a href=\"http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/molad.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this site</a>. The maths is much too complicated for me, but the <a href=\"http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/molad.htm#shorter\" rel=\"noreferrer\">upshot</a> is that our molad is two hours later than the molad when the calendar was formulated, and is getting progressively later every year. The author includes a <a href=\"http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/Molad-All-Months.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">chart</a> (and good luck to you if you can read it) that indicates the relationship between the actual lunar conjunction and the molad.</p>\n\n<p>The same author (Dr Irv Bromberg) has written <a href=\"http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a number of online articles</a> that concern the Hebrew calendar, some easier to understand than others. He has also advanced various proposals for calendrical reform, which he refers to as <a href=\"http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/rect.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the rectified Hebrew calendar</a>. It's definitely worth a look.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Just because the \"error\" in the molad moment seems small doesn't mean that it is insignificant. The approximately +2h delay relative to the mean lunar conjunction moment currently causes the provisional date of Rosh HaShanah (before the application of the postponement rules) to land on the \"wrong\" date (one day later) in 2/24 = 1/12 of years.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I am glad you asked this question, esp. just before Rosh Hashanna! I have been wondering about the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>You may want to read <a href=\"http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/molad.htm#calc\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article.</a></p>\n\n<p>It states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the present era the median length of the lunar cycle is about 29\n  days 12 hours and 30 minutes, the MSM is slightly more than 29 days 12\n  hours and 44 minutes, the shortest lunations are about 29 days 6 hours\n  and 30 minutes, and the longest are about 29 days and 20 hours. Thus\n  the length of the synodic month varies over a range spanning about 13\n  hours and 30 minutes! These variations were greater in the past and\n  will diminish in the future:</p>\n  \n  <p>The longest lunar cycles occur when Moon is moving slowest (near\n  apogee) and Earth is moving fastest (near perihelion).  The shortest\n  lunar cycles occur when Moon is moving fastest (near perigee) and\n  Earth is moving slowest (near aphelion).  The declining mean Earth\n  orbital eccentricity tends to reduce the range of lunar cycle\n  variations.  The average lunar cycle (mean synodic month) has\n  miniscule long-term change compared to short-term periodic variations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article is quite technical, and I wasn't able to understand much of it. But, the summary, above, mentioning aphelion and perihelion, makes sense, if you understand the basic concept that gravity causes an object to accelerate as the gravitational force increases. Thus, when the moon is closest to the Earth, it will have a faster orbit.</p>\n\n<p>There are other web sources that may explain this concept simpler. B\"N, I will edit my answer after Yom Tov. Again, great question!</p>\n\n\n",

However, the focus of the article seems to indicate that if one experiences joy on receiving the new item, and assuming that the gift is not underwear, socks, etc., I infer that that person should recite \"Shehechiyanu\". Personally, while I am not great at remembering to say \"shehechiyanu\" on a new coat that I purchased with my own money, (I have to take those memory pills, if only I can recall where I hid them!) but, if someone gave me a free suit (that fits well!), I would be VERY happy about that!</p>\n\n\n",

For the latter: if he stops to tie an untied shoelace, people might think he is delaying to avoid participating in the ritual because of a problem with his personal status.  (A kohein is not allowed to marry a divorcee, so if his father did so that would affect him.)</p>\n\n<p>The tallit is used to cover the hands because we are not supposed to look at the koheins' hands; I imagine that pulling it over the head is the easiest way to accomplish this (while still letting them move their hands freely).</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about <em>birkat kohanim</em> at <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0016_0_16089.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Virtual Library</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Teshuva and non-Jews?",
    "content": "# Teshuva and non-Jews?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam explains the basic requirements of doing <em>teshuva</em> and seeking forgiveness from another person: acknowledging the transgression, making amends, and seeking forgiveness (presumably publicly per <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=6&daf=87&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoma 87a</a>).  If a person wrongs us and does these things, we're to forgive him.  (He also has to not do it again, but that's for God to judge later, not for us.)</p>\n\n<p>There is, nonetheless, a \"release clause\" in the Yom Kippur liturgy, where we forgive even people who haven't done this so that no one should be punished on our account.  <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10361/472\">This answer on another question</a> points out that this explicitly excludes people who owe financial damages and people who transgressed knowing we'd have to forgive them.  I can't say why exactly, but I've always understood this passage as being about fellow Jews -- a Jew who has wronged me non-financially, and didn't do it knowing I'd have to forgive him -- I forgive even if he didn't do <em>teshuva</em>, because we're all imperfect and if we're favorable to others maybe God will be favorable to us.  I am not sufficiently fluent to be able to tell if the passage quoted there actually says \"anybody at all\" or means just <em>klal Yisrael</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So my understanding is: if a Jew does <em>teshuva</em> we forgive, and if a Jew <em>doesn't</em> do <em>teshuva</em> but these other conditions are met, we forgive anyway.</p>\n\n<p>A non-Jew, by definition, is not participating in this mutual \"release clause\" on Yom Kippur, nor is he bound by the laws of <em>teshuva</em>.  So, two questions here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>According to Judaism, what, if anything, is a gentile required to do if he wrongs a Jew?  (We have laws about Noachides, so <em>halacha</em> might have something to say here.)</p></li>\n<li><p>If a gentile has wronged us and not done anything about it, is he included in our blanket forgiveness or not?  Does \"anyone\" mean <em>anyone</em>, or just Jews?  If I make no specific exclusions, have I passively forgiven a gentile who's wronged me or is he not part of the scope in the first place?<sup>1</sup></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In both cases, does it matter if the gentile is a Noachide, an idolater, neither, or of unknown status?</p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> I don't know if it's actually kosher to make exclusions -- to say \"except Ploni\" -- but it happens sometimes.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Non-Jews are certainly able to do teshuva and be forgiven, as evidenced by the story of Jonah and Ninveh (who were forgiven, despite having sinned both against man and God). The Mabit, in Beis Elohim Shaar Teshuvah chapters 13-14 writes that although non-Jews are able to do teshuva, their repentance is fundamentally different than that of Jews in several important ways. However, all of the differences that he lists are metaphysical differences (such as not being forgiven right away, or not being able to exempt themselves from punishment in the afterlife). Regarding the actual <em>procedure</em> of repentance, however, it appears that Jews and non-Jews are equal in this regard. This is also borne out of the fact that the Gemara (and many later poskim) learn laws regarding the teshuvah of Jews from the story of Ninveh as it's portrayed in the book of Jonah (see Taanis 15a, for example). </p>\n\n<p>Thus, just as a Jew has to be forgiven by his fellow who was the subject of his wrongdoing, a gentile must also be granted forgiveness from the person whom he has wronged before being forgiven by God. The \"release clause\" that is included in the pre-Yom Kippur prayer may not suffice for <em>anyone</em>, Jew or non-Jew. This issue is discussed at length in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=881&st=&pgnum=156\">this teshuva from R. Binyamin Zilber</a>. However, given that it does work for Jews, it's possible that the original intent of the prayer is to only refer to Jews. Having said that, if you as the person reciting the prayer have in mind to forgive the non-Jews as well (and, better yet, if you say that explicitly), then whatever power it has for Jews is probably just as effective for non-Jews too. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I want to point out that the answer is not nearly as cut and dry as @Matt made it sound.</p>\n\n<p>The Midrash Tanchumah (Warsaw edition) Ha'azinu 4 writes that Goyim can not do Teshuva.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מדרש תנחומא (דפוס ורשא) האזינו ד - וכתיב (במדבר ו:כו) ישא ה' פניו אליך וכתוב אחד אומר (דברים י:יז) אשר לא ישא פנים, עושה תשובה נושא לו פנים, יכול לכל ת\"ל אליך ולא לאומה מעכו\"ם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rama Mipano also holds that Teshuva doesn't work for Goyim (unless they convert) in עשרה מאמרות, מאמר חוקר דין חלק ב פרק יא for additional reasons and gives three reasons why Ninveh was different:\n1: Because it was such a large city and there were many innocent people and animals.\n2: They went way above and beyond what they would have had to do.\n3: All the Teshuva did was push off their punishment.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0rUpZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0rUpZ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/he/Default.aspx?HalachaID=645&PageIndex=18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Ovadya Yosef gives another explanation</a>. He says that for Goyim Teshuvah doesn't erase the sin, it just stops them from getting punished.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not saying they can't do teshuva. I'm merely saying its really not clear. It's still worth it for them to do Teshuva as even if it doesn't work it still may prevent them from getting punished or at least delay the punishment signifigantly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The seventy bullocks sacrificed on Tabernacles were offered to atone for the seventy nations.

    "content": "# What is the meaning of surnames that number-related?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I deal a lot with names, whether given names or family names, especially as I collect genealogical information.  So recently I'm puzzled about some Germanic-Jewish names that are related to numbers.  \"EINZIG\" is someone who is one or unique.  I have friends whose family name is ZWANZIGER.  They told me that it derived from where the family lived, that they had a town council in their community/kehila consisting of 20 people.  So if you were a member of the council you were one of the 20, or a Zwanziger. \nChecking in Alexander Beider's book of \"A Dictionary of Jewish Surnames from Galicia,\"\nhere are a few more names, and I haven't exhausted the list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ZWEI or ZWEIER a two;\n<li>DREISIGER is a thirty-year old;\n<li>SIEBZIGER is a septuagenarian;\n<li>HUNDERT is 100;\n<li>TAUSEND is 1000. \n</ul>\n\n<p>Some names could have more than one meaning, such as DREIER, which mean a three; a turner, or drayer.</p>\n\n<p>So here's another one that I don't get: SIEBZEHNER -- someone who was a 17-er.  Can anyone come up with a reasonable explanation for being one of the 17?  (One of a family of 17 kids?, a council of 17? Something to do with the kehila's standards of conduct? something kabbalistic?)  I'm at a loss.</p>\n\n<p>How about any other numerical names?</p>\n\n<p>Gmar vechatimah tovah to all!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Based on a translation of the WP page on <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siebzehner_bei_Welzheim\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Siebzehner</strong> bei Welzheim</a>, it would seem it's an area in SE Germany:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The <strong>Siebzehner</strong> in Welzheimer forest were seventeen farms...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "How to make Purim more female friendly?",
    "content": "# How to make Purim more female friendly?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At a recent Shabbat meal the conversation was about how Purim was a \"guy holiday\" where women felt like second class citizens, especially married women who often found themselves cooking the seuda, serving it to their husbands, guest, and the bevy of half-drunk people who come by. As well as watching the kids while the husband gets drunk, trying to make sure the house doesn't get destroyed, cleaning up, etc. All the women at the table wholeheartedly concurred (they had similar feelings about Simchas Torah). Simply put they did not feel that Purim, post shaloch manos time, had anything positive for them to relate to.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, assuming this is true, what can be done to make Purim more enjoyable for women, especially married women? Please only post answers which have proven to be successful, not just conjecture.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I have found that at Purim meals where <a href=\"http://rechovot.blogspot.com/2013/02/drinking-and-purim.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">no one gets seriously drunk</a>, everyone tends to have an equivalently-good time. How good a time that is, of course, depends on the quality of the company, conversation, etc., just like at any other gathering. If you're looking for a great source of both holy and fun holiday-appropriate conversation-starters, I recommend our free Purim book, <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1568/mi-yodeya-publications#2013\"><em>Purim - Mi Yodeya?</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, at Purim meals where some people get drunk to the point of severely impaired judgement, others at those meals who choose not to attain that state, of any gender, tend to have a less good time as a result. I would advise people who want to enjoy the holiday without getting seriously drunk to try to avoid gatherings where others do.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, if I was a woman with children whose husband was intent on getting seriously drunk, I would consider having him attend a meal with like-minded individuals (making sure that he has a safe way to get home!) and attending or hosting a separate meal for people in my and my children's situation. I am not in that situation, so I can't testify personally as to the effectiveness of this approach.</p>\n\n<p>I can testify to this: A couple of years ago, I decided (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12231/bli-neder-loophole\"><em>beli neder</em></a>!) to not drink enough on Purim to noticeably affect my behavior, where my previous practice had been to get drunk enough at the <em>Se'uda</em> to act pretty silly. This decision was influenced by multiple rabbis that I look up to preaching against Purim drunkenness year after year, as well as by my wife's annoyance at my relative uselessness, while tipsy, at dealing with the kids. My wife reports (and urged me to add after I showed her the previous paragraphs of this answer) that her Purim experience has, in fact, been enhanced by my drastically reduced inebriation and consequent enhanced usefulness.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As a man, I can only tell you what my wife tells me she enjoys about Purim.</p>\n\n<p>My wife enjoys dressing our kids up in costumes that sometimes match a theme with our Shaloch Manos and sometimes are just cute, and then showing them off.</p>\n\n<p>When I was single, I did not get drunk on Purim - I followed the opinion of the Rema, to drink more than my usual (which was any amount, since I never drink), and then take a nap.  My wife thought this was too boring, and she actually <em>asked</em> me to get a little bit drunk.  I try to do it with moderation, but now I get a little bit tipsy on Purim.  My wife says this is one of the highlights of her Purim, to see what I'm like when I'm loosened up a bit.  (Apparently I have made a good impression thus far.)</p>\n\n<p>We have visitors who come by and we sing and dance with them.  My wife likes having people come into the house to just stop by to celebrate with us, and she likes watching our kids dance with the people who come in.</p>\n\n<p>I make sure my wife has time to daven at a pace she would like.

Perhaps, one can also order these <em>viduim</em> accordingly by day. Interestingly, Rabbeinu Yonah in <em>Shaarei Teshuvah</em> descrives 20 different steps to achieve repentance in the first Shaar and also orders transgressions in accordance with <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/146397/36610\">10 levels of stringency</a> in the third Shaar.

When a person puts in the time that he can and works at it, he gets the schar of that effort.

    "content": "# Ensuring that a community is mainstream\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A newcomer to Orthodox Judaism may not have a feel for what is mainstream and what generally considered beyond the pale of normative Judaism. How does one find and join a Jewish community without getting involved with Sabbateans, Karaites, cults, etc.?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The vast majority of shuls self-identified as Orthodox are mainstream. So chances are, any Orthodox shul or community you approach will be mainstream. </p>\n\n<p>Sabbateans are non-existent, as far as I know. </p>\n\n<p>Karaites are very rare and will not pretend to be Orthodox. </p>\n\n<p>Any Orthodox shul without a mechitza (I hear there are a few left) is outside of the mainstream, at least on that issue.</p>\n\n<p>Messianic (that is, Christian) Jews will sometimes present themselves as practicing legitimate Judaism (though the website of the shul will nearly always reveal the fact that they are Messianic). But if you hear people talking about \"Yeshua\" being G-d or providing salvation or anything of that nature, you'll know you're dealing with Messianists. </p>\n\n<p>Lubavitcher (Chabad) shuls that are openly meshichist (ie, believe their late Rebbe is Moshiach) are considered outside the mainstream by most Orthodox Jews. Official Chabad houses, listed on Chabad.org for example, are virtually never meshichist, and thus would be considered mainstream by the vast majority of Orthodox Jews (except those few that see contemporary Chabad as illegitimate in general.)</p>\n\n<p>To determine whether a Chabad shul or community is openly meshichist, look at associated websites to see whether there are references to their Rebbe being Moshiach. In addition, attend community events, shul, etc. and see if anyone is wearing yarmulkes with the \"yechi\" slogan on them. Even if there are some people with such yarmulkes, that does not mean that the entire community is meshichist.</p>\n\n<p>There are a small number of charedi cults. These can be identified in the same way a non-Jewish cult can be identified -- that is, by looking for particular cult characteristics researchers have identified, or by seeing if the group has been labelled a cult by ex-members or cult experts.</p>\n\n<p>As a final method of determining whether a community is mainstream, look at the website of the shul, and specifically at the bio of the rabbi. If he got his rabbinic ordination from Yeshivat Chovovei Torah, the shul may be considered \"open Orthodox,\" a philosophy which according to some Orthodox Jews is not truly Orthodox, because of the many ways in which the statements of associated rabbis resemble Conservative Judaism. </p>\n\n<p>Conversely, if the ordination is from a well-known institution, such as Yeshiva University (Modern/Centrist Orthodoxy), Rabbinical College of America-Lubavitch (Chabad), or Beth Medrash Govoha (Yeshivish), this may be an indication that the community is mainstream. However, since as noted above non-mainstream communities are rare, semicha from a less well-known institution does not mean there is a significant chance of the community being out of the mainstream.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, its lettering is changed because י-ו \"resembles a divine name.\" </p>\n\n<p>This exemplifies our sensitivity to desecrating God's name (other examples include writing BeSiyatta DeShamaya in correspondence or writing Yehudah with a final Aleph - \"lest one accidentally leave out the letter Daleth and write the Tetragrammaton\").  </p>\n\n<p>As for the examples that you mention, it's important to remember that biblical names with weak letters are often abbreviated, but when written in full, י-ו become י-ה-ו  names, which definitely include a biblical name of God. For example, in II Sam. 1:22, Yonatan is fully spelled יְהוֹנָתָן and in 2 Chron. 28:12, Yochanan is יְהוֹחָנָן. \nThus, such names commonly spelled with י-ו  refer to Hashem because their \"full\" names include a divine name, י-ה.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See the Gemara in Sukka 5a in discussing the Mitznefet, there Tosafot (s.v.

This is found in the Ohr Olam Mishna Brura vol 3a p. 441.

Nevertheless he sees the following possible three Rabbinic restrictions</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Mekach u'mekar</strong>: the prohibition of any kinyan (acquisition) on Shabbat (even without writing contracts or exchanging money) to avoid possible Shabbat violations such as writing. On the other hand, since an online transaction is completely automated without any active involvement or knowledge from the site owner, he says this doesn't apply, in the same way one can give money to a non-Jew to buy an object on Shabbat if we do not instruct him to do it specifically on Shabbat and he can do it at other times as well. He therefore concludes \"passive business\" is allowed on Shabbat</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. S'char Shabbat</strong>: the Rabbis prohibited profiting from a forbidden activity engaged in on Shabbat. But the poskim understand this to be related to services rendered on Shabbat, not to sales (e.g., food bought on credit on Shabbat is allowed). Thus a website owner if permitted to keep his profit from Shabbat shales</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.

Summary:</p>\n\n<p>Rav Gamliel, who was the Nassi (\"chief\") at the time and Rav Yehoshua had a disput regarding the validity of accepting a certain type of witness claiming the citing of the 1st crescent moon. Such citing affected the day of the Molad (in this case, it was Molad Tishrei), which, in turn, affects the day of Rosh Hashannah and Yom Kippur. Rav Gamliele challenged Rav Yehoshua to appear before him carrying his stick on the day that was Yom Kippur according to his (Rav Yehoshu'as) calculation (i.e. - Rav Gamliel challenged him to violate Yom Kippur based on R. Yehoshu'as calculation.) At the end, Rav Yehoshua did visit Rav Gamliel, and Rav Gamliel praised him. He acknowledged and even praised his scholarship (thus showing that he was not PERSONALLY offended by what he did) and also praised him for accepting his (Rav Gamliel's) ruling.</p>\n\n<p>Briefly, Rav Gamliel did not take any personal offense. But he was concerned that there should not be different opinions regarding the molad and thus this would divide B'nai Yisra'el, and you would have different people celebrating Yom Kippur on different days! Yom Kippur, esp., is a day that demonstrates unity among Klal Yisra'el. Rav Gamliel wanted to be sure that everyone follows his opinion being Nassi. What makes his opinion \"right\" is a worthwhile discussion that you can find in the Mishnah / Gemarra pages, there.</p>\n\n<p>Personal note: After reading this story, I understand a bit better our great loss in not having the Bet Hamikdash. Then, even with personal disagreements, they deferred to the opinion of the Nassi. Halevai, we could have a SINGLE world-wide \"Va'ad Harabanim\" whose opinion EVERYONE would follow automatically, even if we have our personal disagreements. To relate it to your question, the tanna'im and amoraim were concerned far more about communal unity than personal offense. If anything, I think that we have a bigger problem NOW than then. </p>\n\n\n",

White, because perhaps i won't merit [olam haba], and will be like a bridegroom among mourners. Black, because perhaps i will merit [olam haba], and will be like a mourner among bridegrooms. Rather, [bury me] in clothes of \"אוליירין הבאין ממדינת הים\" (colored clothing).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why then is the common custom to bury people in a white kittel? His concern should still apply today.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Gr'a was apparently bothered by this as well. See his glosses on Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah siman 352 siff two. I'll try my best to translate and fill in the blanks. </p>\n\n<p>The Mechaber mentions the minhag is to be buried in white. The Gr'a says even though R' Yanai said not to, in the Yerushalmi (Klayim 9:3 and Kesuvos 12:3) we find Rebi Yashia commanding to be buried in white. They asked him 'are you better than your rebi?' (This is a reference to Rabi Yochanan, mentioned right beforehand, who  commanded to be buried in a color similar to techeiles and not to be buried in black or white. The Pnei Moshe explains his reasoning as being the same as R' Yanai's) To which Rebi Yashia responded 'am I embarrassed of my actions?' The Pnei Moshe adds that he said this in order to bring his students to yiraas Hashem. (I'm assuming he means that Rabi Yashia was explaining the command of Rabi Yochanan as being a means to bring his students to yiraas Hashem).\n The Gr'a also mentions the next amora there, Rabi Yirmiya who also commanded to be buried in white, and the Gr'a ends off by saying and from here the minhag spread. </p>\n\n<p>One point of clarification though, from that gemara it is apparent that Rabi Yirmiya commanded to be buried in white because that is what he always wore in his life. This was his way of strengthening the belief in Techias Hameisim. He wanted to be buried in his regular clothes, with his shoes and walking stick,laying on his side ready to get up when Mishiach comes. But I guess the Gr'a sees the very fact that he was willing to be buried in white also shows he wasn't worried about Rabi Yochanan and Rabi Yanai's concerns. </p>\n\n<p>Also interesting is this idea of strengthening the belief in Moshiach with burial shrouds is brought in the Shach #1 of that siman from Darkei Moshe that whoever makes nice clothing for the dead is confirming his belief in Techias Hameisim. The Shach explains he must be talking about nice linen, however anything too nice would be assur. I assume he means so as not to ignore the enactment of Raban Gamliei to be buried in linen mentioned in Moed Katan 27b and Kesuvos 8b. </p>\n\n\n",

My own surmising based on what I see as a general pattern:</p>\n\n<p>\"Kakatuv\" usually is a \"support\" or \"proof\" to the previous statement, as in Kedusha, \"Nekadesh et shimcha .... k'shem shemakdishim bishmei marom\". How do we know that this is done this way? \"Kakatuv ... \" Also, it seems that \"kakatuv\" is often followed by the location, \"Al yad nevi'echa\", similar to \"Ubetoratcha katuv...\" where it also tells you where. Offhand, I don't recall the location mentioned with \"Ne'emar\".</p>\n\n<p>\"Ne'emar\" seems to be more of a \"supplementary\" phrase or proof. In other words, we know why something is done, there's just another verse mentioned as an example. That would explain why most of the verses in Malchuyot in Rosh Hashannah Musaph start with \"Kakatuv\" for the 1st verse (or \"Al yedei avadecha katuv...\") and the additional verses use \"Vene'emar\")</p>\n\n<p>I also noticed that there is a difference in tense. \"Katuv\" is \"pa'al\" / active; \"Ne'emar\" is in \"niph'al\" which is passive. I have to investigate this a bit more, but, I sense that there is something to this.</p>\n\n<p>There are probably many exceptions to the rules that I mentioned, but, this seems to be the common pattern that I'm noticing.</p>\n\n\n",

If he has kids (i.e. yotzeh pru urvu), or if he does not have kids, or just to get married so as not to live alone and possibly come to aveira. The Beis Shmuel explains that marrying to have more children is only Derabanan and therefore we are not so machmir so we wouldn't force him to marry (back when that was enforced).</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly though is the Ramma who mentions some cases where he should not mary a women of childbearing capabilities, one of them is if he already has many kids and he is afraid that marrying a new woman who will have kids will cause fighting between his children and his wife, than it is allowed to marry a woman who cannot have children. </p>\n\n<p>This is the closest to population planning you will get. Its all on a personal level, which the mitzvah is, personal, not societal. Notice also its only about a new wife, no hetter to be mishamesh bimoch with the childbearing wife, even for fear of yorshim fighting. One more point is he is addressing a real fear of yorshim fighting. Worrying about running out of earth started with Kayin and Hevel and has continued ever since, as of yet it is hard to justify as a real fear, but then we might not need a real fear, just the type of fear that gets people to fight. And land is definitely a good one at that.</p>\n\n\n",

If he does this under normal circumstances, if I'm not mistaken, this would be a problem of usury (it might also be a problem for other reasons, such as theft, but my question is exclusively about usury - in any case, it's possible that Shim'on is not Makpid how much Reuven uses, and it's therefore not theft).</p>\n\n<p>However, in this case, Reuven was unable to repay Shim'on before Shemittah cancelled the debt. Technically, he doesn't need to repay the debt (again, there may be other issues, but assume that any burden of theft doesn't apply). If he wants to be neighborly, may Reuven repay Shim'on with a new bottle of milk, or is this still prohibited as usury (רבית)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If it wasn't shemittah, you are right in thinking that returning more than the borrowed amount, if that addition is a recognizable amount, would be usury. This is true despite the fact that returning the same volume is allowed even if the product has increased in value, because it's assumed that such fluctuations aren't significant to neighbors or people who borrow small food items. (Mishna Berura O.C. 450:2 quoted in \"The Laws of Ribbis\" by R. Reisman, pg 269)</p>\n\n<p>The laws of Shemitta do apply to lending objects (as in, where the deal was that the object would be replaced, not returned, which would be a case of borrowing) as it is no different than lending money. Thus, as long as the 'debt' was already due before shemittah (which, if not stipulated, is a period of 30 days) then shmitta would cancel that debt as well. (\"The Laws of Ribbis\" by R. Reisman, pg 359 quoting Chayim Shaal 2:38:13)</p>\n\n<p>Returning money after shemittah can either be done as a repayment despite the shemittah, or as a gift of goodwill. If done as a gift, then as long as it's reasonable to look at the extra milk as such and not as reimbursement, then this would probably be allowed (as the Shach Y.D. 160:8-10 writes regarding a regular loan that wasn't cancelled by shemittah). </p>\n\n<p>However, if the food is referred to as 'repayment', the question of whether or not extra food would be considered interest is probably dependent on a question of the Minchas Chinuch (mitzvah 477) as to whether or not shemittah cancels loans automatically, without any action or intent of the lender and borrower, or if it is a mitzvah incumbent upon the lender. According to the latter view, which believes that the loan itself isn't cancelled, it's likely that one would violate the prohibition of usury even after shemittah. (On this, see Minchas Asher Gittin siman 59- he doesn't mention this specific issue but he does discuss the meaning of shemitas kesafim in general at length).</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line, I'd say (besides for saying to first CYLOR) that 'being neighborly' should be clarified that this is meant merely a gift, and not repayment, so that there's no problem.</p>\n\n\n",

But it was moved to make it more obvious that we are doing it for the Mitzvah, and not to appreciate the nice weather.  This seems to imply that there isn't any corresponding event for which it made sense to have it at the time that it is.</p>\n\n<p>The Vilna Gaon (Shir HaShirim 1:4) explains, based on the opinion that the sukkas correspond to the Clouds of Glory, that after the sin of the golden calf the Clouds of Glory left.  The Jews got repentance for that sin on Yom Kippur, 10th of Tishrei.  On the eleventh, Moshe commanded the construction of the Mishkan.  Supplies were gathered for the next three days, and on the 15th of Tishrei, construction began.  When the Jews began construction of the structure that would bring Hashem's presence back to them, the Clouds of Glory returned.  Thus, the 15th of Tishrei is the date of the return of the Clouds of Glory, which we \"reenact\" by going out into the Sukkah on that date.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Gra (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14230&st=&pgnum=10&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Canticles 1:4</a>) explains that the Clouds of Glory returned to the Jewish camp on 15 Tishrei after leaving due to the sin of the Golden Calf.</p>\n<p>(He reasons that Moshe came down with the second set of tablets on 10 Tishrei. <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0235.htm#1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">He immediately gave the command to build the Mishkan</a> on 11 Tishrei. <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0236.htm#3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The people brought gifts for two mornings.</a> On 14 Tishrei the donations were distributed to the workers and on 15 Tishrei the work began, and with it came the return of the Clouds.)</p>\n<p>Additionally, it's a harvest moon and Sukkot is the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0223.htm#16\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Holiday of the Harvest</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

It is also proper to do so in the piyut. This helps the opinion of Ri\"tz ibn Geyus, Tur O\"Ch Siman 621. [Same Mishna Yoma 4:2, but not Mishna Yoma 6:2 as explained there.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Melekhet_Shelomoh_on_Mishnah_Yoma.3.8.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melekhes Shelomo</a> adds here additional point regarding the second <strong>אָנָּא הַשֵּׁם</strong> in the mishna.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אנא בשם.</strong> גרסינן בבית וכן בתוספתא ובירוש' א\"ר חגי בראשונה הוא אומר אנא השם ובשנייה הוא אומר אנא בשם. אבל ר\"ח ז\"ל גריס במתני' בשניהם אנא השם ודחה הירוש' ועיין בטור א\"ח בסימן תרכ\"א. וכתוב שם בספר הלבוש ומה שאומרי' אותו בלשון אנא השם ולא בכנוי באל\"ף דלי\"ת מפני שהכהן לא היה קורא אותו במקדש כמו שאנו קורים באל\"ף דלי\"ת אלא היה קורא אותו במקדש בד' אותיותיו בכתיבתו מה שאין אנו רשאין לקוראו וכן כי הוא הנקרא שם המפורש שהוא המקור לכל השמות ע\"כ בקיצור:</p>\n<p>We use <em>girsa</em> בשם (with ב) and so it is in the Tosefta and Talmud Yerushalmi: Said Rabbi Chagai, in the first case He said אנא השם and in the second case אנא בשם. However Rabbeinu Chananel had girsa אנא השם in both cases and rejected Yerushalmi. And see in Tur O\"Ch Siman 621. It is written there in Sefer haLevush that when we use the wording אנא השם, and not in the substitute name א-ד, because the Kohein Gadol did not call it in the Temple as א-ד, rather he used the name of 4 letters as it was written. We are not allowed to say it so, because it is called an ineffable name (Tetragrammaton), which is the source to all other names.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Practically speaking, this means that everything inside gets wet when it rains.....unless your sukkah has a \"<em>shlock</em>,\" some device that does not stay permanently on the sukkah (so you can remove it when it doesn't rain) and will keep the water out.<br>\nYou can buy a <em>shlock</em> from some sukkah retailers, but those are either expensive or low quality (i.e. just a tarp).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I'm looking for is a complete plan to construct your own DIY <em>shlock</em>.</strong><br>\nI don't think that the just-a-tarp-<em>shlock</em> is a good idea, because it will just fill with water and break. Hard plastic is better, but difficult to make it that it's easy to remove. A sloped, retractable awning (made out of soft plastic) would be a great idea, but sounds very complicated. (if you could make it simple, that would be a great answer!)</p>\n\n<p>Best answers should come from your own experience, and be well-explained.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I made a <em>sukkah</em> with hard wooden covers like the top of a cardboard box:<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aGY7E.png\" alt=\"Box sukkah\"><br>\nEither the <em>schach</em> must be wholly within the walls, or the <em>shlak</em> has be affixed to protrusions at each upper corner (yellow) so it covers the entire <em>sukkah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The hinges (yellow) have to be able to rotate 270°.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>shlak</em> can be covered with tarp (blue) to improve its water resistance.</p>\n\n<p>It only needs a very slight slant for the water to run off, as it does not pool on a solid surface.</p>\n\n<p>I attached sticks (red) at the center corners (similar to those moving high window shades), which are used to swing the covers over the wall and hanging straight down the long walls, thus avoiding being caught in the wind.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I have not built a cover for my sukkah, but I can draw from past experience\ncamping in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">yurt</a>.  A yurt is designed\nto support a small fire inside, in the center, for which purpose there is a\nsmoke hole in the top.  Because you don't want to get rained on when not\nburning a fire, the smoke hole has a cover.  The best yurt designs have a\ndomed ring in the center (that the cover goes over), to prevent pooling; you\ndon't have that option with a sukkah, so we'll have to use a sloped approach\ninstead, like for a lean-to.</p>\n\n<p>First, get a pair of 2x2s that are a foot or so longer, per 8' of cover length, than your sukkah is tall.  (A one-foot difference from front to back provided enough slope for drainage for an 8-foot-deep canvas lean-to in my camping group this summer.  If you're trying to cover 20 feet, though, you'll need more height to get that slope.)  In the top of each, set a spike that protrudes a couple inches -- a large nail works.  Also prepare two blocks of wood thicker than the spike is long and drill a hole partway through each into which the spike can fit.  (Chunks of 4x4 would do.)  Sand all exposed cut sides of these blocks, as you'll be pulling your cover over them and don't want to risk tearing it on a rough edge.</p>\n\n<p>Choose one side of your sukkah (you might opt for the one that is \"ante-windward\", the one the wind is least likely to come from) and attach these poles to your existing vertical supports by screwing, bolting, or lashing.  Do this on the outside of the sukkah to avoid interfering with your <em>s'chach</em>.  We will call this the \"tall side\" henceforth.  If your sukkah is oblong, I recommend doing this on a short side, so your cover is \"longer but narrower\" as opposed to \"shorter but wider\".  It'll be easier to roll it on and off that way.</p>\n\n<p>Procure (or assemble) a covering of the right size plus a few feet in\nlength.  A plastic tarp is easy but can tear, particularly once you add\ngrommets (below).  Canvas will do a better job of keeping you dry, but\nyou'll probably have to sew as the widest canvas I've seen for sale is about\n58\" wide.  If your canvas didn't come pre-treated, apply water-proofing (and it's a good idea to seal your seams too).\nSet grommets at all four corners.  (Note: if setting grommets in\ncanvas, it's best to do it through a leather patch -- sew leather to canvas\nand put grommet through both.  This helps against tearing in high winds.)</p>\n\n<p>Next, position two of the corners on the opposite side of your\nsukkah at the top (get somebody to hold them in place for this step or tie\nthem down), and spread the cover over the top until you reach your new\npoles.  Mark the places on the cover where they meet the spikes, and set\ngrommets there.  (Feel free to give yourself some extra length if you want a\nbit of overhang at the lower side.)  You should have a couple feet of cover\nyet on this side, enough to hang down past your <em>s'schach</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Attach a rope to each corner, long enough to reach the ground from where the cover will sit, plus a foot or two.  Quarter-inch rope is sufficient.  Use actual rope (like hemp), not something that stretches like clothesline.</p>\n\n<p>Position the cover over the sukkah, with the non-corner grommets going over the poles with the spikes.  Once the cover is in place, put one of the blocks over each spike; this will protect your cover from the spikes when you fold it back.</p>\n\n<p>If you are setting your sukkah up on grass, pound a tent-stake near each corner, make a loop in each rope with a slider-knot (err, I wasn't a scout, sorry -- a knot that you can slide along the rope to lengthen or shorten it), put the rope loops through the stakes, and tighten.  To pull the cover back, loosen the ropes on the short side, remove from the stakes, and walk the cover back, guiding it with the ropes, until you've pulled the cover back over the tall side.  It will hang down the outside.</p>\n\n<p>If you are setting your sukkah up on pavement, you'll need something on the sukkah itself to attach the ropes to.  Assuming your sukkah has a \"baseboard\" (something that sits on the ground to which the uprights are attached), you can tie a loop of rope around it at each corner with a very small amount of \"give\".  If you don't have a \"baseboard\" you'll need to rig something on your corner posts.\nOnce you have something on the frame to attach to, either tie off your ropes like above (threading through those ropes instead of tent stakes) or attach a <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004HAZELO\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">trigger-snap hook</a> to each rope.  I highly recommend that you use the hooks for the ropes on the short side, as you'll be fastening and unfastening them a lot (assuming you're keeping your sukkah covered when not in use).</p>\n\n<p>Here is a low-fidelity side view:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/m9S0K.png\" alt=\"side view of cover, ropes, grommets, and tall poles\"></p>\n\n<p>This won't keep 100% of the water out, because there's space on the sides between the <em>s'chach</em> and the cover, but it will keep most out.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This plan was originally made for a sukka where the schach mat was just a little too short for the frame.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Take a heavy-duty tarp about the size of your sukka and a length of PVC pipe about 2 feet longer than the width of the passul spot on the end of your sukka</li>\n<li>Lay the tarp flat on the ground and place the PVC pipe so that it sticks out on both sides (fold the tarp if necessary)</li>\n<li>Roll the tarp up around the pipe (think a roll of paper towels) and tie with a couple pieces of string so it stays in one piece.</li>\n<li>Put your schlock roll in the passul spot.

Offhand, it seems that sitting in the succah is \"more important\" than the 4 species, but I don't think that's the real reason.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Taking the four species is much more obviously a mitzvah than sitting outside in a hut. Thus, one could argue that to make it more noticeably a mitzvah, it was commanded for 7 days. See Guide for the Perplexed 3:49.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Feast of Weeks is the anniversary of the Revelation on Mount\n  Sinai. In order to raise the importance of this day, we count the days\n  that pass since the preceding festival, just as one who expects his\n  most intimate friend on a certain day counts the days and even the\n  hours. This is the reason why we count the days that pass since the\n  offering of the Omer, between the anniversary of our departure from\n  Egypt and the anniversary of the Lawgiving. The latter was the aim and\n  object of the exodus from Egypt, and thus God said, \"I brought you\n  unto myself\" (Exod. xix. 4). As that great revelation took place only\n  on one day, so we keep its anniversary only one day: but if the eating\n  of unleavened bread on Passover were only commanded for one day, we\n  should not have noticed it, and its object would not have been\n  manifest. For it frequently happens that we take the same kind of food\n  for two or three days. But by our continuing for a whole period [of\n  seven days] to eat unleavened bread, its object becomes clear and\n  evident.</p>\n  \n  <p>New-Year is likewise kept for one day; for it is a day of repentance,\n  on which we are stirred up from our forgetfulness. For this reason the\n  shofar is blown on this day, as we have shown in Mishneh-torah. The\n  day is, as it were, a preparation for and an introduction to the day\n  of the Fast, as is obvious from the national tradition about the days\n  between New-Year and the Day of Atonement.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Feast of Tabernacles, which is a feast of rejoicing and gladness,\n  is kept seven days, in order that the idea of the festival may be more\n  noticeable.

Thus the 7 days of Succos remind us of the holiness and separateness of God.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ralbag Joshua Chapter 6</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה היה זה המספר לשביעיות ר\"ל שהקיפו העיר שבעה ימים והיו שם שבעה\n  כהנים ושבעה שופרות היובלים וביום השביעי הקיפו העיר שבע פעמים [לסיבה\n  בעינה] שזכרנו במספר השבעה שזכרנו בתורה כמו השמיטה ושבעה שמטות ושבע\n  שבתות שהם שבעה ימים שבע פעמים ושבעה ימי הפסח ושבעה ימי סוכה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Ralbag Exodus Chapter 20 The Tenth Lesson</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה ימצא עוד תועלת בו בדעות והוא שכבר למדנו מענין השבת שבכאן לצורות\n  שבע מדרגות והמדרגה השביעית היא קדש והוא ה' יתעלה והם צורות היסודות והם\n  האיכויות כאילו תאמר החום והקור והלחות והיובש וצורות המתדמי־החלקים\n  המורכבים מהיסודות וצורות הצמחים וצורות הבעלי חיים וצורת האדם — והוא\n  השכל ההיולאני וצורות השכלים הנבדלים והצורה השביעית אשר שפעו ממנה כל\n  אלו הצורות היא ה' יתעלה והנה לשאר הצורות ימצא דבקות־מה בחומר ומלאכות\n  מיוחדות יסודרו מהם זולתי לה' יתעלה וזה כולו מבואר במעט עיון למי שעיין\n  בדברינו בחלק השלישי מהמאמר החמישי מספר מלחמות ה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Ramma 581 siff one says to blow shofar in the erev. The Mishna Berurah when tagging on the minhag to say lidovid mentions that erev is after mincha. The Chayei Adam and Aruch Hashulchan say the same. The Igros Moshe in O'ch part 4 siman 21 ois 5 explains the minhag of blowing shofar in the evening had to have been during the day because we can't blow shofar from the beginning of the night untill chatzos due to it being a time of din. He explains that erev means after mincha and brings a proof for this. Or he says it was actually after Maariv but only if they davened mib'od yom, while it was still daytime. He goes on to explain why we only blow once in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>I will add that being that the shofar blowing and saying lidovid are put together in this sugya, than its possible the ashkenazi minhag started when everyone was davening maariv before nightfall and continued even when people started davening after nightfall.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Neither.

If the witnesses didn't come, Rosh Hashana would (biblically) automatically be deferred to the next day, but Melacha would continue being prohibited due to the fear that people would Mezalzel the first day of Rosh Hashana the next year.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, Rosh Hashana always falls out on the 1st and 2nd. So the calendar is programmed \"as if\" the witnesses came the first day.</p>\n\n<p>Why do we have a second day?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It was actually the subject of a machlokes Rishonim if Rosh HaShana should be two days in Jerusalem/Beis HaVaad/Israel.  The Baal Me'or (Beitza 3a) cites part of the discussion, and records that the practice was to only keep one day, until it was changed per the psak of the Rif.</p>\n\n<p>The Rif claims that based on Rava (that R' Yochanan would agree even after the enactment of Raban Yochanan Ben Zakai to return acceptance of testimony to the whole day, that an egg born on day 1 of Rosh Hashana is still forbidden on day 2) that even in Israel Rosh Hashana should be 2 days.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Efraim (cited by Rosh and Baal Me'or) says that once the calendar was established, all of Israel is like the Beis HaVaad where there is no doubt and they keep one day.</p>\n\n<p>The Rashba and the Rosh defend the Rif.  The Rashba says that from the fact that outside of Israel didn't change with the establishment of the calendar, we see that the establishment of the calendar didn't change these things.  The Rosh says a slightly different variation - that from the fact that outside of Israel they still forbid an egg born on day 1 of Rosh Hashana to be eaten on day 2 of Rosh Hashana, we see that even after the establishment of the calendar it is still treated as one long day.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban says a different proof - that all that needs to be proven is if the 2 days of Rosh HaShana were an enactment or just a reaction to a doubt.

Amongst the points raised there is a claim made in letter 18, pg 134. I quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When primitive Christianity arose as a sect in the Holy Land, and began to slowly introduce reforms, one of the innovations which the sect established at once in the externals of synagogue practice was to have men and women sit together. In many instances mixed seating was the unmistakable sign by which a Jew could recognize that he had found not a place of sanctity for Jews to pray, but rather a prayer-house for a deviant sect; for in those times the Christians had not yet formally differentiated themselves from traditional Jewry. As a sect they endeavored to hide their identity, and only through certain definite signs could they be recognized. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Where is the source for this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/6954/when-and-how-did-men-and-women-start-sitting-together-in-church/7031#7031\">In this answer from Christianity.StackExchange</a> there is good evidence that Christians were not mixing the sexes during prayer/worship gatherings in the 1st century.

You can see that countries that outlawed it usually did so in the last 100 years.</p>\n\n<p>I think that it is safe to say that no other civilization 1900 years ago was putting severe limits on capital punishment and so the Rabbis were clearly ahead of their times on this social issue.

Do you have to treat Mr. 'X' as a Jew? Would it matter if Mr. 'X' himself said he is Jewish?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This is a very complicated issue.  I'll start with the point of if Mr. X himself says he is Jewish.</p>\n<p>The Talmud in Pesachim 3b has the story of a non-Jew who was given to eat from the Korban Pesach when he said he was Jewish.  Tosefos there writes (s.v. ואנא):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מכאן אין ראיה שנאמין לכל הבא לפנינו ואומר ישראל אני דשאני הכא דרוב ישראל היו ואזלינן בתר רובא אך יש להביא ראיה מפרק החולץ (דף מה. ושם) דאמר ליה זיל גלי או נסיב בת מינך וכן מההוא דאתא לקמיה דרבי יהודה ואמר נתגיירתי ביני לבין עצמי אמר ליה נאמן אתה לפסול את עצמך ואי אתה נאמן לפסול את בניך והיינו משום דמצי למימר ישראל אני</p>\n<p>From here ther is no proof that someone who says they are a Jew is believed, as here there was a majority of Jews.  However, proof could be brought from Yevamos 45a [in which someone who claimed to be the son of a non-Jew with a Jewess] was told to go somewhere that they didn't recognize him and marry a Jew, and from the case of a man who said he converted, and Rebbi Yehuda said he was not believed to invalidate his son, the reason being because he would be believed [מגו] to say that he is a born Jew.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbeinu Tam in Yevamos 47a says that there is a rov (majority) that most people who claim they are Jewish, are (and therefore proof can even be brought from the Gemara in Pesachim).  The Rosh in Yevamos 4:37 cites this opinion as well, and Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 268:10 codifies according to this reasoning (Shach there).</p>\n<p>R' Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe E.H. 1:6) wrote that even if the person does not \"act\" Jewish, just claims as much, they are believed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובדבר מה שאין ראיה על אם אשתו שהיתה יהודית רק מה שהיא אמרה לבתה ולו שהיא יהודית, נראה דלתוס' ורא\"ש יבמות דף מ\"ז דבאדם שבא ואמר ישראל אני נאמן משום דרוב הבאין לפנינו בתורת יהדות ישראל הם, אינו דוקא שראינום שומרי תורה ומצות אלא אף על אמירתם לבד שהוא ישראל הוו הרוב משום דעכו\"ם לא יאמר על עצמם שהם ישראלים בכל המדינות שידוע שרובא דרובא דהעכו\"ם ואולי כולם הם שונאי ישראל ומתביישים לומר שהם ישראלים, וכ\"ש באשה שהיא נשואה לעכו\"ם שאם היא ג\"כ עכו\"ם לא תאמר על עצמה שהיא ישראלית ויש להאמינה למה שאמרה שהיא ישראלית</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Paraphrased:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we have no proof that she is Jewish, just that she says she is, it seems that the words of Tosefos and the Rosh is not specifically by those who keep Torah and Mitzvos, but by anyone who says they are Jewish...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, if there are previously established assumptions (chazaka) that a person is not Jewish, then they are not believed - Tosefos Pesachim 3a.  R' Moshe (E.H. 1:8) asserts that even the Rambam (who makes no mention of the rov or מגו qualification) would still not accept it if there was a chazaka to the contrary.</p>\n<p>If someone tells you Mr. X is Jewish, I imagine it would depend on how they know.  If Mr. X told them, and the person telling you is Halachically trustworthy, then you would believe them.  If they are just assuming, then I don't see why they would be believed.  If they have circumstantial evidence, it would depend on the level of evidence.  For example, R' Moshe rules (E.H. 2:10) that someone with a Jewish name that is not normally used by non-Jews is assumed to be Jewish (and vice-versa).  Shu\"t Zichron B'Sefer quotes from R' Moshe that the Russian Olim could be assumed to be Jewish if they spoke Yiddish and had Jewish on their Russian passport.</p>\n\n\n",

(Of course the remaining <em>hadas</em> is placed on top of the lulav, slightly leaning towards the right).</p>\n\n<p>If someone could please confirm the correct arrangement, it would be appreciated! If it makes any different, I am interested in the minhag according to the Ben Ish Chai.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are various Sephardic customs for how to arrange the arba minim. The Ben Ish Chai's halakhic works and responsa never explicitly refer to what he did. Nevertheless, the most common custom today among Sephardim is follow the Arizal, who was a primary influence on the Ben Ish Chai and many Sephardic authorities generally. </p>\n\n<p>The custom of the Arizal is referenced in Magen Avraham (651:4):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הטעם ע\"פ הקבל' [ד\"מ מהרי\"ו] עיין בלבוש ובכתבי האר\"י כת' לאגוד ג' הדסים א' בימין הלולב וא' בשמאל וא' באמצע וב' ערבות א' בימין וא' בשמאל ושל\"ה כת' בשם מט\"מ ערבה בשמאל והדס בימין ולולב באמצע</p>\n  \n  <p>The custom to raise the hadassim higher is according to our master R. Yaakov Weil. Also see the <em>Levush</em> and the writings of the Arizal, which state that one must bind the three hadassim so that one is to the right of the lulav, one to the left, and one in the middle. For the two aravot, one is to the right [of the lulav] and one to the left. The <em>Shelah</em> writes in the name of the <em>Mateh Moshe</em> that the aravah is to the left and the hadassah is to the right and the lulav is in the middle. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ashkenazim generally follow the latter approach, where the hadassim are to the right and the aravot is to the left (Mishnah Berurah 651:12). </p>\n\n<p>The Yalkut Yosef (651:10) follows the Magen Avraham in declaring it the Sephardic custom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יתן ההדסים אחד מימין ואחד משמאל, ואחד באמצע על גבי השדרה, ונוטה יותר לצד ימין, והערבות אחת מכאן ואחת מכאן, ויקשור</p>\n  \n  <p>One hadas is to the right and one to the left and one in the middle on the spine [of the lulav], and one aravah here and one there [left and right], and you bind them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As noted, placing the hadassim at a higher level than the aravot is also a popular custom, particularly among Ashkenazim. The Rema (651:1) brings down R. Weil as the source (and Magen Avraham is commenting from there), and this is also a common custom among Sephardim. </p>\n\n\n",

It doesn't really look like thats what tosafos is saying though, see there d.h. ee ba'i.\nHere is a side theory though. The Rosh in Brachos ch. 7 siman 23 also requires eating in the succah the first night even when it is raining. The Rosh's rebbe was Maharam of Rothenberg who has been reffered to by the grand title the Aruch Hashulchan used, the greatest Rabbi of Tsarphas. So maybe this ruling was assumed to be in the name of his rebbe? Maybe.</p>\n\n<p>But untill we check the Kook edition let's go with Rabbeinu Yehuda.</p>\n\n<p>Ok. After some research it turns out there is no Rashba on maseches Succah. When the Aruch Hashulchan quoted the Rashba on the sugya, he was apparently reffering to the chidushei HaRitva, a student of the Rashba, on the sugya. However, the Ritva wrote the chidush on the sugya in the name of his rebbi. He reffers to him as Mori Neru, the term he reserves for the Rashba, and not the title the Ritva calls his other rebbe the Ra'ah. This can also be proven by the fact that the Rashba has a responsa in chelek 4 siman 78 outlining this same idea. Checking in the footnote of the Kook edition Ritva you will find that they don't name who the gadol hador from tzarfas is but rather just send to the likeminded Rosh mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramma does paskin to sit in the succah the first night even in the rain.

    "title": "Is Building a Succah a mitzva?",
    "content": "# Is Building a Succah a mitzva?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have seen contradicting sources on whether building a succah is part of the mitzva to dwell in it. I want to know if there is a machlokes on whether building a succah is preparation of a mitzva or a mitzva in and of itself.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi (Sukka 1:2) and Tosefta (Brachos 6:9) write that one should make a bracha on 'the mitzvah of building a sukkah'. However, the Bavli (Sukka daf 46a and see Rosh there) disagrees. </p>\n\n<p>The simplest way to explain the dispute would be to say that the Yerushalmi believes that there's a mitzvah to build the sukkah, and the Bavli disagrees. I believe that the Rambam understood the dispute in this way, as he writes in a Teshuva (142) המצוה היא ישיבת הסוכה לא עשייתה ואין אנו עושין אלא כדי לישב, ולכן נברך לישב ולא נברך לעשות - the mitzvah is only to dwell in the Sukkah, not to make it, which is why the bracha is phrased as \"לישב\" instead of \"לעשות\". However, R. Zzi Pesach Frank (Mikraei Kodesh Sukka I, pg 111) explains that the Yerushalmi merely believes that even a preparation for a mitzvah requires a blessing, and I believe that this is the opinion of the Or Zarua (Hil. Tefilin 583) as well.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are several indications that even according to the Bavli or how we'd pasken, there is still a mitzvah of sorts to build the sukkah:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Mishnah (Shevuos 3:8) gives examples of someone who swore <em>not to do a mitzvah</em>, and includes someone who swore that he won't <em>make</em> a sukkah</p></li>\n<li><p>Rashi to Makkos (8a) writes that there is a mitzvah to build a sukkah, but that one would be exempt from doing so if he found one already made. (This is noted by the Aruch L'ner (there) but the Avnei Nezer O.C. 459 disagrees with this reading of the Gemara)</p></li>\n<li><p>Rama, quoting Maharil, writes that one should build the sukka immediately after Yom Kippur, because מצוה הבא לידך אל תחמיצנה - one shouldn't delay a mitvah (referring to building the Sukkah as a mitzvah)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thus, it appears that building a sukka is a quasi-mitzvah, in that some rules of 'mitzvos' apply but some do not. The Netziv clarifies this in his commentary to the She'iltos of Rav Achai Gaon (169:1), where the She'iltos writes מצוה למעבד מטללתא ולמיתב בה - there is a mitzvah <em>to make a sukkah</em> and live in it. The Netziv explains, that while the main part of the mitzvah is the dwelling in it, and building a sukkah is merely a הכשר מצוה - a preparation for the mitzvah, there is significance to the fact that this is 'a preparation that is written in the Torah'. (I assume that he means וחג הסוכות תעשה לך, which, while al pi pshat seems to be referring to the holiday itself, is taken by the Gemara daf 11a to refer to the sukkah structure as well).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes, as HaRav Eliyahu Mansour <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=684\" rel=\"nofollow\">explains</a> (citing specific poseqim), the poseqim (Halakhic authorities) are divided on whether building a sukkah is a mitzwah itself or simply a preparatory activity for a mitzwah. He summarizes that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"[...] There is a Machloket if building the Succah is a Mitzvah itself. We hold that it is a preparatory Mitzvah. There is no Beracha in the building, but one should involve himself in the construction. Specifically, try to begin on Motzae Yom Kippur to build the Succah or start learning the Halachot in regards to the Succah.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The reason there is a minhag to build Sukkot the day after yom kippur is to start the year off immediately with mitzvoth. Due to this reasoning, it is quite clear that building a sukkah is a mitzvah, or this reasoning would not be applicable.</p>\n\n\n",

This is explained either as meaning a third of it's size or a third of it's price. \nThe reason for the opinion concerning size is that we are dealing with an esrog that is the bare minimum size and we are afraid it might shrink, so we get a larger, i.e. nicer, one to avoid this worry. According to this opinion, even if one already bought his bare minimum esrog, he should switch it any time possible to a larger one. The opinion who explains hidur as applying to the price understands the hidur to be na'ah, pretty, in it's more simple sense.\nThe Biur Halacha also mentions that if there is a safeik of psul such as a machlokes if this particular esrog is kosher or not, than everyone agrees to add a third of the price to upgrade to an esrog that all agree is kosher.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Five conditions of a hiddur esrog according to the Tiferes Yisrael Sukkah 3:37 from most to least important. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>That it should be completely clean,and especially by the chotem (when the middle starts to bend in) there shouldn't even be pin drop of something unclean.</p></li>\n<li><p>The esrog should have many bumps and not be smooth skinned. </p></li>\n<li><p>The ukatz (bottom stem of esrog) should be indented into the esrog that its surrounded by the esrog itself.</p></li>\n<li><p>It shape should be like a tower (wider on bottom and then narrower on top), and not look like a ball.</p></li>\n<li><p>The shoshanta (crown on top of pitum) should be completely intact and should be symmetrical with the ukatz on bottom.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Text of Tiferes Yisrael:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/frOOP.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Mehudar (מהודר) can be translated as 'pretty', but is generally used to mean 'above and beyond' what is strictly required.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a kosher etrog can be ugly, but there is no problem with using it.

The גמרא reads that by telling a child you will give him something and then failing to do so, this teaches him to lie. But in reality it is the father who is doing the lying. So why does the גמרא not say that the father is transgressing the עשה of מדבר שקר תרחק? The עורך לנר answers that in our case the father is not in fact lying. The גמרא was talking in the context of taking לולבים. It instructs that a person should not give his לולב to his child on the first day of יום טוב because whilst the child has the power to be מקנה (acquire) the לולב he does not have the Halachic capacity to give it back. Should this happen, the father will be without his ארבע מינים for the rest of יום טוב. Says the עורך לנר; a father can still give the לולב to the child not as a מתנה, but temporarily, for חינוך purposes. The father is consequently not lying as his intention is not to fully hand over the לולב but rather to show his child what to do with it. However, when the child grows up and learns the הלכות he will see that he never really fulfilled the מצוה since he did not actually own the לולב. The עורך לנר writes: “ועל ידי זה מלמדו לדבר שקר במרמה” – “And through this he will learn to speak falsehood in deceit”. This means that whilst his father had good intentions, it nevertheless created a situation whereby the child feels deceived by his trusted teacher – his father. This being the case, he might come to learn that lying is justified, and this is why the גמרא had to specifically state that it will teach the child falsehood. </p>\n\n<p>So taking this within the context of your question it is perhaps best practise to acquire at least a kosher set (doesn't have to be מהדרין מן המדרין) so when he becomes more familiar with the halochos he will be happy that it was done כדת וכדין.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If your child is truly below the age of chinuch, he can have a lemon. If your child is of chinuch age, he must use a kosher set, but his set does not need to have additional d'rabbannan stringencies. These chinuch sets are also ok for adults if there are no other sets to be had.</p>\n\n<p>Source: I am a L & E vendor.</p>\n\n\n",

The Torah also mentions that the episode happened while we were traveling to point out that even though the whole nation had to wait because of her, they still did.

They mention that after chag, etrogim cost about $2 a pound (not to mention the ones which were passul to begin with). Does anyone know where to purchase etrogim in the US for human consumption?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I know what I state will seem \"over simplified\", but seriously, I would contact some shuls immediately after Yom Tov, esp. Hoshannah Rabbah morning, if you can.</p>\n\n<p>Most congregants leave their etrogim in the shul after davening Hoshannah Rabbah. I can't say who takes them away, but in my shul, I suspect that since the janitor cleans the shul, he may just throw them into the trash! Point is, if you can at least contact the shul and get the rabbi or someone in charge, you can probably get a bunch of etrogim for free!</p>\n\n<p>Some communities such as Flatbush, Teaneck, Passaic, Baltimore, etc. have web post forums. Look them up in Google. You may want to place a posting to the effect - \"If you're disposing of your etrog, please contact me ... etc.\" You may get more responses than you care to handle, actually.</p>\n\n<p>Request - if you collect a bunch of etrogim and make jelly, I request a jar. I haven't had this in years!</p>\n\n<p>I can't agree or disagree with @DoubleAA's comment about pesticides. But, I have eaten etrogim, before, and I had no ill effects other than a bitter taste in my mouth, and I think it was from the etrog and not DDT. FYI - Someone told me that the bracha is \"shehakol\" and not \"ha'etz\" as it's uncommon to eat raw etrogim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have friends that are esrog dealers so I get them for free after sales end.

And while there may have been many decisors in the past that allowed the use of electricty, most of them are from 30+ years ago, describing things like the use of lightbulbs, microwaves, etc so i would not dare to claim how they might answer regarding a smart phone since they would have never seen one in their lifetime. But here is a list of every Rabbi that i'm aware of that allowed the use of electricity on Yom Tov, and you can go ahead and read their responsa to decide if any of them might apply to your question.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1903 Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein (the author of the Aruch Hashulchan)\n  in Bet Va'ad LeHakhamim allows turning lights on on Yom Tob.</p>\n  \n  <p>1903 Rabbi Yosef Yehoudah Strazberg (author of Yad Yosef, & Ab Bet Din\n  of Makasov, Galitzia) in Bet Va'ad LeHakhamim also allows turning them\n  on.</p>\n  \n  <p>1912 Rabbi Refael Aharon Ben Shim'on (Chief Rabbi of Egypt) (He wrote\n  this in 1901) in his UMitzor Debash allows turning them on.</p>\n  \n  <p>1913 Rabbi Binyamin Aryeh HaKohen Weiss in his Eben Yeqarah allows\n  turning them on.</p>\n  \n  <p>1924 Rabbi Yehuda Yudil Rozenberg in his Maor HaHashmal in Montreal,\n  Canada allows turning them on.</p>\n  \n  <p>1932 Rabbi Ruben Margaliot in his Nefesh Hayah allows turning them on.</p>\n  \n  <p>1934 Rabbi Yosef Messas (Rabbi of Tlemcen, Algeria and Meknes, Morocco\n  and Haifa, Israel) in his Mayim Hayim allows turning them both on and\n  off and he reiterated his position in numerous other places.</p>\n  \n  <p>1934/35 Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank (Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem) in Qol Torah\n  allows turning them on.</p>\n  \n  <p>1935 Rabbi Ben Sion Meir Hai Uziel (The Rishon LeSion himself) in his\n  Mishpete Uziel allows both turning them on and off and he reiterated\n  this in 1947.</p>\n  \n  <p>1936 Rabbi David HaKohen Saqli (Rosh Ab Bet Din in Oran, Algeria) in\n  his Qiryat Hanah David (volume 2) allows both turning them on and off.</p>\n  \n  <p>1945 Rabbi Eliezer Yehoudah Waldenberg in his famous Tzitz Eliezer\n  (volume 1) allows turning them on.</p>\n  \n  <p>1948 Rabbi Masoud HaKohen in his Pirhe Kehounah (Casablanca) allows\n  turning them on.</p>\n  \n  <p>1964 Rabbi Shraga Faivel Frank in his Toldot Ze-eb allows turning them\n  on.</p>\n  \n  <p>1973 Rabbi Shabetai Sheftel Weiss in his Hilkhita Rabeta LaShabeta\n  allows turning them on.\n  Source: List compiled by Joseph Mosseri.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The example normally given is an electric stove top which is already on before Yom Tov, can the stove top be changed in the same way that gas can be changed? The answer to that is that if the switch is a continuous rheostat, then it can be changed in the same way that gas can be changed. However, many stove tops have switches which actually \"click\" between settings. That is, you are, in effect, turning the electricity off and then on when the settings change. This is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, turning it on is like lighting a new flame which is forbidden and not like lighting a gas flame from a pilot flame. That is why one must unplug the electronic ignition of a gas stove top before Yom Tov. One can only light the gas from a pre-existing flame.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yisharon.org/shabbatmode\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Halakhot of Stove and Oven Use on Shabbat and Yom Tov</a> explains the modern \"Sabbath Mode\" ovens.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ottmall.com/mj_ht_arch/v12/mj_v12i27.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mail Jewish</a> has a related article which goes into detail on the subject.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As far as electricity goes, the only available  leniency would be if you ruled with the minority opinion that it is treated as real fire. In that case, the Aruch Hashulchan, who did treat it as fire, has a responsa allowing one to shut off his light on yom tov sheini. But nobody I've heard of rules like that. In fact, his great grandson told me that his mother, the A.H.'s granddaughter did in fact act in accordance with that ruling allong with her family, but has since stopped after getting married. \nBut getting back to your case, if you can establish that it is in fact fire and not let's say nolad or molad, you would then have to prove that the use of electricity is shava lichol nefesh and or rely upon mitoch. This would all be in order to actually manipulate the device. If in fact you would like to just leave the device on without touching it, you would still need to rule like everything mentioned just to get away from from any gezeira or harchaka so as not to come to manipulate it.</p>\n\n\n",

Does Qabalah theses on <strong>אין סוף</strong> make any implication upon the <strong>סף</strong> that Ezekiel is told to use to measure the temple's dimension?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Yam Suph (mentioned in the Torah) clearly means the sea of reeds not the sea at the edge. The word סוף when pronounced like <em>suph</em> always means reeds and never connotes edge. (see Isaiah 19:6). In Parshat Shmot 2:3-6 too the word <em>suph</em> means reeds. (It says that the daughter of Pharaoh saw Moses in the <em>Suph</em> (בתוך הסוף) which clearly means \"between the reeds of the sea\". See also verse 3 (וַתָּשֶׂם בַּסּוּף עַל שְׂפַת הַיְאֹר) where it clearly reads \"between the reeds on the edge of the Nile\"). It is reasonable to assume that the word <em>suph</em> mentioned in chapter 2 has the same meaning as the one in chapter 10 and 13. (The reed was also a common used grass in Egypt and indigenous to the area, so most likely it was the same weed found near the Nile that was also found near the Yam suph).  </p>\n\n<p>Some scholars even think that the word <em>suph</em> used in sefer Shmot is an egyptian loan word (<em>twf</em> in egyptian hieroglyphics <a href=\"http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2008/08/New-Evidence-from-Egypt-on-the-Location-of-the-Exodus-Sea-Crossing-Part-I.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2008/08/New-Evidence-from-Egypt-on-the-Location-of-the-Exodus-Sea-Crossing-Part-I.aspx</a>). On the other hand, The word סוף which is pronounced like <em>soph</em> meaning edge or end did not exist, as part of the Hebrew language, until much later. The first instance it is used in the context of edge/end is in Kohelet 3:11; 7:2.  </p>\n\n<p>As for how the word <em>suph</em> (reeds) evoloved into <em>soph</em> (edge/end) it is not so clear, but some suggest that that \"After this event at Yam Suph, perhaps the verb Soph, meaning \"destroy\" and \"come to an end,\" originated\". <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_Suph\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_Suph</a>. It is also possible that they are two different words altogether and bear no relation to each other though their roots are very similar.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n",

I understand that some people believe there is no point/need because I am not Jewish (nor married) and therefore it has no meaning, however, I would still really like to visit one one day. I feel like I need to fill this spiritual void within myself. Is this permissible? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The most accessible form of mikva is a natural lake or the ocean (assuming you live near a coast). These are considered the ideal mikvaos though most use man-made mikvaos for a variety of other reasons. Natural springs also qualify as mikvaos and in fact purify from things which conventional mikvaos do not. All of these are easily accessible to anyone.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I cannot answer this question for all non-Jews but as a Jew by choice who had an Orthodox conversion almost 30 years ago I can say that I was denied the use of one mikvah (after presenting my conversion papers) and encouraged to have (another) Orthodox conversion before requesting to be able to use another one.  So I'm going to say that it depends on the people running the particular mikvah but it is probably not allowed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>No you should not be visiting the mikvah. Mikvahs are specifically built for the Jewish community (exception being those who wish to join via conversion are required as part of that process). Whilee the idea of mikvah be seem nice it is important that G-d has a designed path for each of us to follow.

The Gemara gives answers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The teacher must be joyful but the student must be in fear</li>\n<li>Both are in the teacher. Before starting to teach he must be joyful but them when he begins teaching he must be serious.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Gemara says that Rabbah would say a joke, all the students would laugh and then they would sit in fear and Rabba would teach. The Gemara says that this is according to the second answer.</p>\n\n<p>Now the second answer doesn't mention students. Both joy and fear are for the teacher (and <em>not</em> the students). </p>\n\n<p>Why are the students laughing and then sitting in fear? Either be in fear the whole time or be happy the whole time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Maharal in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14202&st=&pgnum=32\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nesiv HaTorah ch. 6</a> explains the concept of the second answer with a parable, that someone who is going to see the King is happy on his way there because he is going to get to see the king, but once he gets there, the appropriate awe of the king's presence sets in.  So, too, before you learn you have the happiness of what you are about to engage in, but once you begin the awe should set in.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the second answer does not mean to be exclusive to the teacher, as the students are in the same position.  It merely means to say that even the teacher, who is already \"used to the Torah\" (as the Maharal explains in the Gemara's first answer), should still have awe once he begins his involvement in it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I haven't looked at the <em>g'mara</em> except as you've quoted it, but in that quotation it says \"לסוף יתיב באימתא\", \"at the end <strong>he</strong> would sit in reverence\" (emphasis supplied), which seems to fit right in to the <em>g'mara</em>'s second answer: he would first say something funny and then sit in reverence.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How old is the Earth?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are few versions of the age of the Earth <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_Bible\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Wikipedia Article</em></a> but they seem to be mostly (all?) from christian interpretations. Are there estimations from the Tanakh, with Jewish interpretations? </p>\n\n<p>This question is asking for a religious answer, without regard to scientific evidence or lack of same. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>@DoubleAA pointed out that I should mention that the dates based on the birth of a child do not account for however many months after each father's birthday a child was born. That would add some months to the timeline in each generation. This could add an extra year every two generations, but it would be too complicated to go into. That is why the meforshim who use this method do not go into it.</p>\n\n<p>Someone else pointed to the analogy of the Chinese counting ages from New Years. If that analogy holds, the time is counted using Rosh Hashannah. Thus, the extra months would be dropped rather than being added in as an extra year as occurred for the reigns of the kings. I do not know if this is true or not, but it could be a consideration.</p>\n\n<p>I should also note that if the secular estimate of 586 BCE for the destruction of the first Bais Hamikdash is used, then 3338 would have been 2604 years ago, making the current year 5942. The statement that the current year is 5778 is based on the destruction of the second temple in 68 CE and 3828 AM.</p>\n\n<p>There are those who do not have the zero point at the creation of Adam. Thus, some count <em>year 1</em> as the <em>time</em> before Adam, and year 2 as the year after Adam was created. This would add two years to the year number but not change the number of years elapsed. Thus, after 3828 years, the second Bais hamikdash would have been destroyed in the year 3830 which would match with the year 70 CE. The conversion factor of 3760 would stay the same.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>We should note that the Torah only discusses time passing after the creation of Adam. That is, the age of the universe is only counted from the creation of Adam. Once the Adam was created, we have the timeline that I show as part of <a href=\"https://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2015/05/rabbi-leibtag-shiurim-hebrew-calendar.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Leibtag shiurim: The Hebrew Calendar and its Missing Years- Parts 1 - 3</a>. Thus the flood occurred in 1656, Avraham was born in 1948, The Exodus occurred in 2448, The first temple was built in 2928, etc. This gives the current year as 5778. The dates that I mention (from the creation of Adam until the destruction of Bais Hamikdash Harishon) are directly from the pesukim in the Tanach.</p>\n\n<p>The wikipedia article that you quote apparently has certain dates that are either mistaken or based on philosophical reasoning. I would say that the dates shown are mistaken as I show in the timelines below. The article claims that the first temple lasted 430 years, However, it neglects to account for the fact that partial years in the reigns of kings were counted as full years.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In order to calculate the duration of the first Beit HaMikdash, Sefer\n  Melachim records the length of each king’s reign. Adding up the reigns\n  of the kings from Shlomo – in whose fourth year as king the Beit\n  HaMikdash’s existence began – to Tzidkiyahu – in whose reign it was\n  destroyed – we have a total of 433 years[7]. However, because the\n  dating system then was focused on the king and not on an absolute,\n  continuous calendar (as we mentioned above), the final partial year of\n  a king’s rule was counted as a full year, and the rest of that year\n  was also considered to be a full year for the next king. Therefore, we\n  can conclude that there was an extra year of overlap recorded for each\n  king. Accounting for the 19 rulers, and therefore 19 years of overlap,\n  our total reduces to 414 years. We also need to remember that\n  construction began in the fourth year of Shlomo’s reign. We therefore\n  remove four years to give the final count of 410 years for which the\n  first Beit HaMikdash stood. Thus, the Beit HaMikdash was destroyed in\n  year 3338.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The time line that I show is</p>\n\n<pre><code>Name    Father’s age at time of birth    Year of birth  \nAdam                N/A                        0  \nSheit               130                      130  \nEnosh               105                      235  \nKeinan               90                      325  \nMahalaleil           70                      395  \nYered                65                      460  \nChanoch             162                      622    \nMetushelach          65                      687  \nLemech              187                      874  \nNoach               182                     1056    \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The flood occurred when Noach was 600 years old (1656).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8175#v=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noach 10:10</a> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These are the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old, and\n  he begot Arpachshad, two years after the Flood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means in 1658.

This assumes that Avraham was the eldest born when Terach was 70, or the youngest so that the verse means that when Terach was 70 all three <em>had been born</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15890/jewish/Chapter-6.htm#v=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim I 6:1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And it was in the four hundred and eightieth year after the departure\n  of the children of Israel from Egypt, in the fourth year, in the month\n  Ziv, which (is) the second month of Solomon's reign over Israel, that\n  he did (begin to) build the house of the Lord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first temple was built 480 years after the Exodus or 2928. It lasted 410 years, bringing us to 3338. This was based on the count of the kings in Tanach and Seder Olam. This brings us to the end of the Tanach.</p>\n\n<p>I carefully do not use the common secular date that is written for the destruction of the first Bais Hamikdash as there are disputes in the matter which would affect the actual date that we derive for the current year and the age of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>The meforshim and the gemara tell us that the galus bavel lasted 70 years (from the destruction) and the second bais hamikdash lasted 420 years. See the timelines at the end of the post that I cite for details. Seder Olam tells us that the building of the second temple occurred at the end of the 70 years of galus bavel (3408) and lasted 420 years, being destroyed in 3828.</p>\n\n<p>We are told that this was the equivalent of 68 CE in the modern secular calendar. Thus, the conversion factor is 3760 years. That is, add 3760 to the current secular year to get the age of the universe count. That is, when the secular and Hebrew years are again in sync (after January 1, 2018), we see that our count of the age of the universe is 5778 years.</p>\n\n\n",

As to the outlet pipe, there is some delay and disconnect between the flush of your toilet and waste coming out the other end. You will contribute to the flow, but the stuff you flush only pushes out the stuff that flows out, so this action is a grama. </p>\n\n<p>I would say that unless you have your own personal sewer, your flushings will become batul in the rest of the city's flushings and by the time it leaves the sewer, it will no longer be your halachic problem.</p>\n\n\n",

There are many types of muktza. From the two you mentioned, rocks should be designated for the use you intend forever. This is how the mishna berurah ruled. Pets are tough. Many huge poskim all come from an answer that the Rosh gave about birds in cages that animals stay muktzah under all circumstances. Chacham Ovadia and the seffer Bitzel Hachachma from the Debertziner' s brother come to mind. Reb Moshe Feinstein is quoted in the newest chelek of the Igros Moshe as being lenient for pets, the muktzah of animals is reserved for non useful farm animals. Pets are specifically designated as useful for fun and companionship. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Howard Jachter, in an excellent article on Halachic Perspectives on Pets (<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/halacha/jachter_1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/halacha/jachter_1.htm</a>), footnote 44, quotes \"Rabbi Shmuel David (Sheilot Uteshuvot Meirosh Tzurim 38:6) (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22624&st=&pgnum=270\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22624&st=&pgnum=270</a>) [who] cogently argues that one who is accustomed to move his pets is analogous to <strong>someone who prepares a rock prior to Shabbat for use on Shabbat. In such cases the rock is no longer muktza since he has demonstrated that the rock has utility for him on Shabbat</strong> (ordinarily, rocks are muktza since they serve no purpose on Shabbat; once one demonstrated his use for a rock then it is no longer classified as muktza). Similarly, one who ordinarily moves his pets demonstrates thereby that they have utility on Shabbat and hence are not muktza\".

    "content": "# Torture in Jewish Law Used Against the Enemy\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does Halacha allow Jews to commit physical or psychological torture against their enemies when necessary (e.g. in a time of war, to get vital information from them, etc.) and to what extent is it allowed?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The earliest source I found concerning physical torture is in Judges 1:6-7 (Book of Shoftim), where it says וַיָּנָס אֲדֹנִי בֶזֶק וַיִּרְדְּפוּ אַחֲרָיו וַיֹּאחֲזוּ אֹתוֹ וַיְקַצְּצוּ אֶת בְּהֹנוֹת יָדָיו וְרַגְלָיו. \nוַיֹּאמֶר אֲדֹנִי בֶזֶק שִׁבְעִים מְלָכִים בְּהֹנוֹת יְדֵיהֶם וְרַגְלֵיהֶם מְקֻצָּצִים הָיוּ מְלַקְּטִים תַּחַת שֻׁלְחָנִי כַּאֲשֶׁר עָשִֹיתִי כֵּן שִׁלַּם לִי אֱלֹהִים וַיְבִיאֻהוּ יְרוּשָׁלַםִ וַיָּמָת שָׁם: Ralbag explains this was done to intimidate the Canannate rulers and also to punish Adoni-bezek measure for measure for what he did to his own victims. Retracting my previous assumption, I noticed that Ralbag implies that this was not commanded by God, but it was done by His will anyway. Malbim says that God put in their minds to do this to him. </p>\n\n<p>I haven't seen a source for this, but it may be that God directly commanded them in a prophecy, through the Urim V'tumim, or that the leaders were divinely inspired to do this retribution (Malbim implies this last option). I look at it this way: First of all, this man was as good as dead in God's eyes because he was from the 7 nations. Also, the Jews repaid him measure for measure, without putting him through extra torture than necessary to accomplish their goals. They even let him live after he confessed his sins and he died in Jerusalem as the verse states (It may be though, that they let him live because that would show their control over Adoni-Bezek, and this privilege is not given to the average individual of the 7 nations even if he confesses).  </p>\n\n<p>This case is the only case of the sort I can find, so it seems that this measure is only allowed when: 1- the person is going to be killed anyway, 2- it supports the cause of an obligatory war (milchemet mitzvah), 3- It is done exactly measure for measure according to one's deeds, 4- It seems to require some form of divine sanction (but this point is not clear). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The story of Yom Har Gerizim comes to mind. The 21st of Kislev was a holiday mentioned in Megilas Taanis and explained in Yoma 69a. Short version the Kusim slandered the Jews in an attempt to have the Beis Hamikdosh destroyed. Alexander the great famously meets Shimon Hatzadik, and hands the Kusim over to him to be done as seen fit. Their heels are punctured so as to be tied to the tails of horses and they are dragged to Har Gerizim which is subsequently razed and used for planting, as mida kineged mida for their plans to have this done to the Beis Hamikdosh.</p>\n\n\n",

Gerizzim for over 20 years. He discovered evidence that some sort of Samaritan temple was active during the Persian and Hellenistic eras there on the mountain. This fits in well with Jewish traditions about the existence of a Samaritan temple during said eras (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillat_Taanit%2C_Kislev?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillat Taanit, 21st of Kislev</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chullin.6a.3?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 6a</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews.11.8.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Antiquities of the Jews 11:8</a>; and some believe that the Dead Sea Scroll labeled 4Q372-1, line 12 refers to this same temple (see <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24608989\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)) and directly contradicts Samaritan traditions about the place. According to Samaritan tradition, they - as the only members of Am Yisrael who remained loyal to the first location of the mishkan (tabernacle), Mt. Gerizzim - continued to worship in the mishkan until it was destroyed due to the sins of Israel sometime before the destruction of the Temple (they don't deny that a Temple in Yerushalayim existed, they just think it shouldn't have been built there in the first place. Never mind now why; there are a number of reasons). The supposed destruction of their tabernacle is recounted in their various chronicles. Here's the description from Sefer Hayamim (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the days of Hoshea ben Elah who ruled over eight of the tribes of Israel<sup>1</sup> and in the days of the [Samaritan] high priest Akavyah and in the days of Chizkiyahu king of Judah the king of Assyria came to the city of Shomron, laid siege upon it for three years and exiled all who were in it and in its [neighboring] cities to the cities of Babylon, and afterwards came to the city of Shechem and gathered all of the elders of the congregation of the Children of Israel the guardians of the truth<sup>2</sup> and they are the sons of Yosef ben Elazar the priest and the sons of Yosef were trustworthy in the chosen place Mt. Gerizzim, the house of God [beit E-l], and he [the king of Assyria] said to them: Rise and travel to Charan...the high priest Akavyah rose and took the holy vessels and buried them in the chosen place Mt. Gerizzim, the house of God and wrote in the book of his people (another possibility: the book that was with him; in Hebrew: ויכתב בספר עמו) the location that they were buried in...and they exited...in mourning...\"...but we are to be blamed and for this, this predicament has befallen us and the LORD has exiled us from the seat near the hose of God Mt. Gerizzim, the house of God...and since then the LORD hid the holy tabernacle for 494 years.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The various chronicles continue to describe how not long after that, the Samaritans were able to return to Samaria and they continued to worship on Mt. Gerizzim but without a tabernacle, until this day.</p>\n<p>As stated above, archeological evidence directly contradicts this. Although no ruins of an actual temple structure have been found yet (leading to the theory that perhaps the temple was actually really a tabernacle), there has been found other evidence that some kind of temple or temple-like site did exist there. For one, piles of kosher animal bones were found around the site - probably the remains of sacrifices. For another, many inscriptions were found, attesting to the existence of the temple. One inscription reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"הקריב יוסף [על] [אש]תו ועל בניו [לפני א]דני במקדש\"</p>\n<p>\"Sacrificed Yosef [for] his [wi]fe and for his sons [before the L]ORD in the temple\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And another:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"זי הקרב דליה בר שמעון עלוהי ועל בנוהי אבנ[ה דה לד]כרן טב קדם אלהא באתרא דנה\"</p>\n<p>\"This was sacrificed by Delayah son of Shimon for him and his sons [this] ston[e] [in] good [me]mory before God in this site\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For more on these inscriptions and others, see <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23682362?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Since these findings contradict their traditions, the Samaritans have chosen to ignore the findings, for admitting they exist would devastate their religion,<sup>3</sup> which is on the verge of dying anyway (it was only in recent decades that they began to convert outsiders to their religion - when they realized they had no other choice).<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>Other fallacies would probably come down to quibbling over textual differences and the like.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Because some had already been exiled during the time of King Pekach ben Remalyahu (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.15.29?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 2:15:29</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.5.26?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:5:26</a>).</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> One of the titles the Samaritans use to refer to themselves, particularly in old texts.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> This I heard from the person who organized our tour to Mt.

Per Tosafoth, those actions do not immediately fulfill any Mitzvah - they enable later Mitzvah fulfillment (giving the retrieved object to the father, feeding the father, bringing sacrifices). Per Rashi, though, they are Mitzvoth themselves, and they cannot be fulfilled without directly violating a prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason, the teacher of the class calls Rashi's approach \"shver\" (strange), and says \"we learn like\" Tosafoth. </p>\n\n<p>Granted, as far as I know, the interpretation of Tosafoth is the more common use of this term (that is, \"Hechsher Mitzvah\", when I encounter it, usually means that your actions right now enable later performance of Mitzvoth). But what's so \"shver\" about Rashi here?</p>\n\n\n",

All too often, I have run across Rabbis who have been know-it-alls or who haven't given me the time of day. The Rebbe's words have served me well in this regard.</li>\n<li>My Rabbi back in the US, who I'm certainly still in contact with, always taught us that a true Rav should know his student well: his strengths and his weaknesses. And that a true Rav should know when to be gentle and when to be tough. Some Rabbis love the nonstop fire-and-brimstone/mussar approach to teaching, while others throw some love in with the rebuke.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>IMHO, at the end of the day, only the individual can decide for him or herself who will be their Rav. I don't think anyone can make that decision for anyone else. The Rav-student relationship is (or should be) a very intimate one.

Ultimately the discovery, knowledge and theory about dinosaurs is a scientific one; one that is not really discussed in classic Judaic literature due to the discovery of dinosaur fossils begin relatively recent.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Slifkin has a chapter devoted to this in '<a href=\"http://zootorah.com/books/the-challenge-of-creation\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Challenge of Creation</a>' (chapter 17 entitled 'Dinosaurs and Sea Monsters').</p>\n\n<p>I will try to summarise some of this chapter:</p>\n\n<p>'And Hashem created the great taninim...' (Bereishit 1:21). Some say that this refers to giant sea monsters, however in Devarim 32:33, where 'tannin' is used in the singular, it refers to snakes. Yechezkel 29:3 they are referred to as crocodiles. Slifkin argues against Schroeder (Science of G-d p.193), who says that taninim refer to the general category of reptiles. Slifkin goes on to argue that the modern term 'reptile' bears no place in classic Judaic thought since the Torah's classification of animals has nothing to do with modern taxonomy that is based on DNA. He argues that claiming that 'taninim' as being dinosaurs is sensationalist, at best. Furthermore, seeing as the majority of dinosaurs were terrestrial, Slifkin questions why the Torah would have made a reference to dinosaurs in general as the sea dwelling 'taninim'.</p>\n\n<p>Slifkin argues that there is 'no reason to expect to find dinosaurs in the Torah any more than we would expect to find ammonites or mammoths'. There are countless species (extinct and present) that bare no necessity that the Torah should find the need to mention them.</p>\n\n<p>He brings another 'contender' for dinosaurs from Iyov (40:15-24):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טו  הִנֵּה-נָא בְהֵמוֹת, אֲשֶׁר-עָשִׂיתִי עִמָּךְ;    חָצִיר, כַּבָּקָר יֹאכֵל.\n  טז  הִנֵּה-נָא כֹחוֹ בְמָתְנָיו;    וְאוֹנוֹ, בִּשְׁרִירֵי בִטְנוֹ.\n  יז  יַחְפֹּץ זְנָבוֹ כְמוֹ-אָרֶז;    גִּידֵי פַחֲדָו יְשֹׂרָגוּ.\n  יח  עֲצָמָיו, אֲפִיקֵי נְחֻשָׁה;    גְּרָמָיו, כִּמְטִיל בַּרְזֶל.\n  יט  הוּא, רֵאשִׁית דַּרְכֵי-אֵל;    הָעֹשׂוֹ, יַגֵּשׁ חַרְבּוֹ.\n  כ  כִּי-בוּל, הָרִים יִשְׂאוּ-לוֹ;    וְכָל-חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה, יְשַׂחֲקוּ-שָׁם.\n  כא  תַּחַת-צֶאֱלִים יִשְׁכָּב--    בְּסֵתֶר קָנֶה וּבִצָּה.\n  כב  יְסֻכֻּהוּ צֶאֱלִים צִלְלוֹ;    יְסֻבּוּהוּ, עַרְבֵי-נָחַל.\n  כג  הֵן יַעֲשֹׁק נָהָר, לֹא יַחְפּוֹז;    יִבְטַח, כִּי-יָגִיחַ יַרְדֵּן אֶל-פִּיהוּ.\n  כד  בְּעֵינָיו יִקָּחֶנּוּ;    בְּמוֹקְשִׁים, יִנְקָב-אָף.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and in English:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Behold now behemoth, which I made with you; he eats grass like an ox. Behold now, the strength of his loins, and the power in his belly. He thrusts his tail like a cedar, his testicles are bound by twisted cords. His bones are like tubes of bronze; his limbs are like bars of iron. He is the head of the works of G-d; let He who made him bring near His sword to him. The mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. He lies under the shady trees, in the cover of the reeds and swamp. The shady trees cover him with their shadow' the willows of the brook surround him. Behold, he plunders a river without hurry; he trusts that he can draw the Jordan into his mount. He takes in the river with his eyes, his nostrils are as though pierced by hooks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Slifkin makes reference to a number of creationists that suggest that these verses refer to dinosaurs (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda\" rel=\"nofollow\">saurapods</a>, to be exact), but says that 'no dinosaur lived at the same time as Iyov'. He goes on to suggest that these verses are quite explicitly talking about the hippopotamus.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, he sees no reason for dinosaurs to be mentioned in the Torah. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>NOTE: I am not a science guy but found the following interesting. <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/238/Q1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Copy/Paste from the Ohr Somayach \"Ask The Rabbi\"</a></p>\n<p>Far from being frightened by dinosaurs, Rabbi Yisrael Lifshitz, author of the Tiferet Yisrael commentary on the Mishna, received the news of fossil discoveries in the nineteenth century with delight. As he had undoubtedly expected, they confirmed everything that we knew all along. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…As regards the past, Rabbi Abahu states at the beginning of Bereishet\nRabbah that the words \"and it was evening, and it was morning\" (in the\napparent absence of the sun) indicate that \"there was a series of\nepochs before then; the Holy One created worlds and destroyed them,\napproving some and not others.\" The Kabbalists expanded upon this\nstatement and revealed that this process is repeated seven times, each\nShemita achieving greater perfection than the last…They also tell us\nthat we are now in the midst of the fourth of these great cycles of\nperfection…[Editor's note: Interestingly, many paleontologists also\nconsider there to have been four eras: the Precambrian, Paleozoic,\nMesozoic and Cenozoic.]</p>\n<p>We are enabled to appreciate to the full the wonderful accuracy of our\nHoly Torah when we see that this secret doctrine, handed down by word\nof mouth for so long, and revealed to us by the Sages of the Kabbalah\nmany centuries ago, has been borne out in the clearest possible way by\nthe science of our generation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tiferet Yisrael then goes on to describe all sorts of discoveries that point to evidence of epochs that were created and destroyed preceding ours including the discovery of <em><strong>\"a monstrous type of elephant, some three or four times larger than those found today…\"</strong></em></p>\n<p>(<em>Tiferet Yisrael, in Derush Ohr HaChayyim, found in Mishnayot Nezikin\nafter Masechet Sanhedrin</em>)</p>\n<p>So it would seem that according to the Tiferet Yisrael the dinosaurs lived in one of the preceding epochs and not in our current experience starting from Bereishet.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to read the full article linked above.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I discuss some of the logical reasoning in <a href=\"http://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2011/10/breishis-creationism-and-evolutionism.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breishis - Creationism and Evolutionism</a></p>\n\n<p>Logically, we can consider Creation in a way like building a computer program from modules. Each \"day\" is a different module turned on and off for the unit testing. This is why the first time, when time is created, is יום אחד (one day) and the following days are of the form \"a second day\". It is only on \"the sixth day\" and the finish (ויכולו) that the actual execution begins. As a result, nothing before the beginning of man and civilization (Adam) needs to be mentioned. </p>\n\n<p>Speaking of creation in a theoretical sense, the universe could have been created with this post on your screen and we would have no way of <strong>proving</strong> that it had been created 5 seconds or 5 billion years ago. In either case, the carbon dating and other <strong>internal</strong> evidence would be the same.</p>\n\n<p>I also point this out in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/47419/and-it-was-evening-and-it-was-morning-one-day/47423#47423\">\"And it was evening, and it was morning, *one* day\"?</a></p>\n\n<p>The fact is that with the initial creation of space and time, a day was created. Once that was done and a second dark/light cycle created, it was a second day. Something that somewhat duplicated the existence of a cycle a second, third, fourth, and fifth time. It was only with the creation of \"the sixth day\" that the universe reached the point of being able to continue \"according to the laws of nature\" and had enough parts in existence to be able to continue to exist. However, it was only with the creation of \"rest\" that the \"program\" actually began running.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the third day was the \"plant module\" and the fourth day was the \"sun moon and stars module\". This implies that the light of the stars was created reaching the Earth no matter how far away the stars were. These \"modules\" could not run independantly.</p>\n\n<p>Note that this also answers how vegetation could be created \"before\" the sun. It also answers why dinosaurs do not have to be mentioned. Just as trees were created with rings (showing an \"age\"), the stars were created already visible from Earth, dead trees were created to allow mushrooms to grow, etc. Thus, fossils would logically be created as part of the Earth. The sixth day just says that Hashem created all the land animals as they were found when Adam was introduced to the world.</p>\n\n\n",

The question, then, is about the pesukim/mizmorim. </p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch there writes that one may, after finishing davening, go back to say the parts of pesukei dezimra that he skipped, and it sounds a bit like he feels that this is the proper thing to do. This also seems to be the position of the Mishna Berurah (52:9). The Aruch Hashulchan (52:4), though, believes that according to the Shulchan Aruch this is merely optional. There doesn't seem to be a time limit, as the Shulchan Aruch's reasoning is that saying pesukei dezimra is no different than saying tehillim, which can be said at any time.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Aruch Hashulchan himself (52:5) believes that one is prohibited from saying pesukei dezimra after prayer, and he insists that this is the position of the Tur and geonim. His reasoning is that \"pesukei dezimra was only established for pre-prayer\" (in addition to kabalistic reasons). Another reason may also be that it's improper to praise God after praying to Him (see Maharal in Nesiv Ha'Avodah ch. 12 based on Megillah daf 18a)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In shulchan aruch siman nun beis it says \"<strong>afterwards</strong> you should say the psukei dizimra without the brocho before and brochoh after (meaning boruch sheomar and yishtabach) - (see shulchan aruch harav there where he explains why you don't say the brochos -)  there are two opinions whether you should say it after davening or not therefore the halachah is to say it without the brocohos see also mishnah brurah ois tes where he uses the words ואחר התפלה and after davening...</p>\n\n<p>So you say it after you finish davening.</p>\n\n<p>But see mishnah brurah and others on this who say that there is a custom to not skip any part of davening even for the benefit of tifilah bitzibur.<br>\nSee also igros kodesh of the lubavitcer rebbe cheilek yud ches page pay aleph who writes that there are those who are against skipping davening even to daven shmonah esrei with the minyan (even if you came on time and the minyan is davening too fast for you).</p>\n\n\n",

A little over ten years ago, when I was getting my bar mitzvah tefillin the sofer showed my father and I both types of battim but we were told in school that \"all tefillin these days are gassos\".

    "content": "# Why don't we wear tefillin on Yom Tov sheni?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <em>Hilkhoth Tefillin</em> 4:10, the Rambam states the basic and well-known <em>halakhah</em> that \"...<em>shabbathoth wi-yamim tovim enan zeman tefillin</em>...\" (<strong><em>Translation</em></strong>: \"<em>Shabbat</em> and <em>Yom Tov</em> are not times for [wearing] <em>tefillin</em>\"). This is due to the <em>pasuq</em> that <em>tefillin</em> are meant to be an <em>oth</em> (\"sign\") [cf. <em>Shemoth</em> 13:9; <em>Devarim</em> 6:8, 11:18, et al] and <em>Shabbath</em> and <em>Yamim Tovim</em> are already an <em>oth</em> by themselves [cf. <em>Shemoth</em> 31:17; <em>Hilkhoth Tefillin</em> ibid.]</p>\n\n<p>However, there is an interesting statement in <em>Hilkhoth Evel</em> 10:10 which says:</p>\n\n<p>הקובר את מתו ביום טוב שני שהוא יום טוב האחרון או ביום טוב שני של עצרת נוהג בו אבילות:  הואיל ויום טוב שני מדבריהם ואבילות יום ראשון מן התורה יידחה עשה של דבריהם מפני עשה של תורה.  אבל אם קבר ביום טוב שני של ראש השנה אינו נוהג בו אבילות ששניהן כיום אחד ארוך הן מהטעם שביארנו בהלכות קידוש החודש</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>Translation</em></strong>: \"The one who buries his dead on the second day of Yom Tov [<em>yom tov sheni</em>], which is the last Yom Tov, or on the second\n  day of the Yom Tov of <em>Shemini</em> <em>Assereth</em>, conducts himself on it\n  according to all the rules of mourning. Since the second day of Yom\n  Tov [<em>yom tov sheni</em>] is rabbinic in nature and the first day of\n  mourning in Biblical in nature, <strong><em>the positive commandment of the\n  rabbis is displaced by the positive commandment of the Torah</em></strong>. But\n  if one buried [his dead] on the second day of Yom Tov [<em>yom tov\n  sheni</em>] of <em>Rosh HaShannah</em>, he does not conduct himself on it\n  [according to all the rules of] mourning since both days are together\n  considered one long day for the reason that we explained in <em>Hilkhoth\n  Qidhush HaHodhesh</em>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this <em>halakhah</em>, the Rambam seems to communicate a general principle that any <em>misswath `aseh</em> (positive commandment) from the Torah displaces a positive directive of rabbinic enactment - in this case, <em>Yom Tov Sheni</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is, if the <em>gezerah</em> of <em>Yom Tov Sheni</em> does not displace <em>aveyluth</em> [halakhic mourning] since it is a <em>misswath `aseh min ha-torah</em>, then why would it displace the obligation to wear <em>tefillin</em>, since it is also a positive commandment on a Biblical level?</p>\n\n<p>(<strong>NOTE</strong>: I am assuming the position that <em>tefillin</em> must be worn on <em>Holo Shel Mo`edh</em> and that the Rambam also takes this position in the <em>Mishneh Torah</em>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Rambam himself says in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_02013.html#HtmpReportNum0041_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הלכות שביתת יום טוב - פרק ראשון</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כב יוֹם טוֹב שֵׁנִי אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהוּא מִדִּבְרֵי סוֹפְרִים כָּל דָּבָר שֶׁאָסוּר בָּרִאשׁוֹן אָסוּר בַּשֵּׁנִי. וְכָל הַמְחַלֵּל יוֹם טוֹב שֵׁנִי וַאֲפִלּוּ שֶׁל רֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה בֵּין בְּדָבָר שֶׁהוּא מִשּׁוּם שְׁבוּת בֵּין בִּמְלָאכָה בֵּין שֶׁיָּצָא חוּץ לַתְּחוּם מַכִּין אוֹתוֹ מַכַּת מַרְדּוּת אוֹ מְנַדִּין אוֹתוֹ אִם לֹא יִהְיֶה מִן הַתַּלְמִידִים. וּכְשֵׁם שֶׁהָרִאשׁוֹן אָסוּר בַּהֶסְפֵּד וְתַעֲנִית וְחַיָּב בְּשִׂמְחָה כָּךְ הַשֵּׁנִי <strong>וְאֵין בֵּינֵיהֶן הֶפְרֵשׁ אֶלָּא לְעִנְיַן מֵת</strong> בִּלְבַד:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the  מגיד משנה there who brings sources, explaining that essentially both days of Yom Tov have the identical status, <em>with the exception of certain Halachot related to burying and mourning.</em></p>\n<p>In other words, the question is the other way round: Why is some form of mourning allowed, since the 2 days of Yom Tov are identical?</p>\n<p>The answer - based in the sources (ibid) - seems to be that we pasken like Rav Ashi in ביצה <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00884.html#HtmpReportNum0008_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daf 6a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רב אשי אמר אפילו לא אישתהי מ''ט יו''ט שני לגבי מת כחול שויוה רבנן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Even if there's no risk of the body decaying, the 2nd day of Yom Tov has the status of a weekday as regards burial.</em></p>\n<p>As I understand it, when they decreed the 2nd day of Yom Tov, they excluded burial and essential mourning - and hence it (and only it) is allowed. The Rambam reinforces this by reminding you it's a Torah obligation to mourn on the first day, and you may not choose to forgo your mourning <em>in honour of Yom Tov</em>.</p>\n<p>With regards to Tefillin, they did not include it in the decree - and therefore one may not wear Tefillin on 2nd day Yom Tov.</p>\n\n\n",

The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.99.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah (99:4)</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עד שיסיר יינו - ואף אם רגיל לשתות הרבה ואינו שיכור כלל ברביעית אפ\"ה לא יתפלל לכתחלה אם שתה רביעית יין [ברכי יוסף]:‏</p>\n<p>Until his removes his wine - and even if he is used to drinking a lot, and is not \"Shikor\" at all from a revi'is, even so, he may not pray lechatchila if he drank a revi'is of wine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Birkei Yosef (OC 99:1), cited above, notes that this person is not considered a \"Shikor\", since he is able to speak in front of the king, but rather, simply a \"Shasui\".\nTherefore, he definitely still feels the effects (perhaps he's a little light-headed), but due to his regular drinking, these are not severe symptoms that classify him as a \"Shikor\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שתה כדי רביעית יין וכו'. פירוש אף שהוא רגיל ביין, <strong>שאם שותה הרבה אינו בסוג שיכור, אלא יכול לדבר בפני המלך, ולא קרינן ביה אלא שתוי</strong>, עם כל זה אם שתה רביעית אל יתפלל לכתחילה, וכמו שביאר מרן בב\"י דברי הטור, <strong>שכתב שתוי כל שיכול לדבר בפני המלך</strong>, ומ\"מ לכתחילה לא יתפלל אפי' אם שתה כדי רביעית. ע\"ש. ובב\"ח. ודוק.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This difference is noted by the Poskim (the Birkei Yosef cites the Beis Yosef here, and the Mishnah Berurah himself mentions this difference, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.99.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">99:16</a>, for example), and in no way unique to the Birkei Yosef.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion: Therefore, in this case, he should wait until the wine no longer affects him in any way, and then he may daven.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

The bad angel boasts that in a single instant he could undo years of the good angel's work. They decide to test this out. They find a human being, and the good angel has 3 years to do whatever he wants. The man lives in a kingdom where the king wants the milk of a lion, and will pay a considerable reward for it. (The usual Jewish legend stuff - probably the hand of his daughter and half his kingdom). The man, with the assistance of the angel, goes through all sorts of travails and manages to secure the milk of a lion. He returns after years of adventure with the milk in a jug, and presents it to the king. Just as he opens his mouth the 3 years end, and the bad angel takes over, causing the man to say \"I have brought you the milk of a... sheep!\" The king is angry and orders the man executed. Somehow the man manages to talk his way out of it, but the lesson (or at least the lesson that we were supposed to learn) is that even a moment of indiscretion can destroy a lifetime of good works.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone recognizes this story (some details may be off) and can tell me where it's from, I'd be much obliged.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The story is found in מדרש שוחר טוב to Tehillim (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14050&pgnum=376\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">39:2</a>).

    "title": "Why does belief in Judaism require irrationality?",
    "content": "# Why does belief in Judaism require irrationality?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In conversations with Rabbis, and in watching debates between Rabbis and atheists, I have often found that the response to questions which attack Judaism either on the basis of some of its perceived picayune laws (for example, “Why does God care what food we eat?”) or on the ramifications of its theology (for example, “Over the history of civilizations, Jews have historically been very small in number; why would God want only a minor percentage of his creation to experience ‘the truth’ and serve him properly?”), has been some version of “there are some parts of the Jewish faith which require a person to go beyond rational belief and simply have faith”.</p>\n\n<p>My basic question is, Why would God create Judaism in such a way as to require irrational beliefs? If the goal is to lead a moral life in the face of temptation and to serve God, why not create Judaism in such a way as to be 100% rational? People would still have free will to do bad things, act irrationally, etc.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>You might just be asking the wrong Rabbis. However, to give you a sort-of answer to why this is the case regarding specific details of the religion (such as the food question, and similar questions), <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18653/how-can-we-be-sure-that-judaism-is-the-truth\">belief that the Torah in all its details as it's been passed down to us as the will of God <em>is</em> a rational belief</a>. Therefore, even if certain aspects of it (either its laws or theological positions) seem irrational, we can presume that God knew what He was doing. It is a rational thing to believe a doctor when he or she tells me that a certain medication will help me and another one could kill me, even if I do not understand why (and might think he is wrong based on what instinct or what I have heard elsewhere), because it is rational to believe that the doctor, as an expert, knows what he is doing. Similarly, as the benevolent, omniscient creator of the universe and all its inhabitants, it is rational to believe that when God tells us something, as expressed through the Torah, it is right. </p>\n\n<p>There's another question as to why God would give us laws that seem inherently unintelligible to human beings. Some, such as the Rambam (Moreh Nevuchim 2:40 and elsewhere), believe that in fact all laws should be intelligible to humans and merely require some thought to figure out what their purpose actually is. The Ramban (Vaykira 19:19) indicates that God gave such laws in order to drive home the point that human intelligence is so vastly far from God's, so that we'd have a greater fear of Him. The Ramchal in Adir Bamarom gives a mystical reason for this, and though I don't understand it myself I'll quote it for the sake of completeness: חוקים הם דברים שטעמם נעלם, והקב\"ה רצה להעלים הדברים כך, כדי שהסטרא אחרא לא תוכל להדבק. </p>\n\n<p>R. Mecklenberg, the Ksav Vehakabbalah, also notes that כפי שהשי\"ת נהג עמנו למעלה מהטבע, כן נעבדהו בעבודה נעלית משכל אדם - just as God acts on our behalf in a way that sometimes contradicts the natural laws of the universe, He obligates us in performing commandments that may not have any reason or function according to the natural order of the universe. However, almost all Jewish thinkers believe that even the חוקים, the commandments that don't seem to have any reason, do provide some metaphysical benefit. (see for example the Alshich to Shemos 20:8)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I wanted to address the general question without getting into your specific examples of which beliefs require accepting irrationality.</p>\n\n<p>G-d is infinite and we are finite.  The most basic thing that we can understand about G-d is that He is beyond our understanding.  The Rambam writes in several places (Hilchos Teshuva, Moreh Nevochim part 3) that G-d's \"knowledge\" is not in the same realm as our knowledge, and we cannot comprehend what G-d's knowledge is.  Even the fact that G-d is unlimited is not a description of essence, but just an expression of the fact that we cannot assign any definitions (Vilna Gaon's explanation of אין סוף).</p>\n\n<p>I once heard R' Yaakov Weinberg explain that this is a function of G-d's existence being absolute while the existence of everything else is not (Rambam Yesodei Hatorah 1:1-5 and 1st Ikkar).  Thus, this state is inherent in the nature of existence, and not merely something G-d held back from us.</p>\n\n<p>That being the case, there will obviously be some things that we cannot grasp, because they are beyond the faculties of human knowledge to grasp, and a person only understands what he can experience (Derech Hashem 1:1:5).  The infinite is beyond our grasp, and how an infinite Being could create or relate to a finite creation is also beyond our grasp, and there will therefore be parts of existence which are inherently incomprehensible to us.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The second question about being small in number is flawed, because, we don't believe that everyone should be jews. There are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_Noah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7 Noahide commandments</a> for the rest of the world, and the 613 for us. Note that the seven basically amount to being an upstanding human being who participates in civilized life. Non-jews who keep the seven are considered by rabbinic judaism to be righteous gentiles and merit the hereafter. So clearly there is not one objectively right way to serve God.</p>\n\n<p>As to the first question, in light of the above, evidently there are different roles in this world. My understanding of the role of Jews stems from <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0219.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ex 19:6</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1042.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 42:6</a>. We are meant to be held to a higher standard of devotion to God, so as to set and example for the rest of the world, so that they can keep their seven.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes living an upstanding, moral life by the 7 is hard. Sometimes doing something wrong may feel right. Sometimes the reason you do something is not because you want to or because its fun and easy, but because it is for the greater good. So you disregard your own thoughts and feelings, and do what needs to be done.</p>\n\n<p>As a holy nation of priests, and a light unto the nations is our role, our way of life takes that discipline to an extreme. We do many things that don't even make a particular amount of moral or rational sense, that put us out and inconvenience us, that draw attention and are strange, solely out of devotion to God; to principle. We do those things so that when people notice those practices, that commitment, and see the community it cultivates, the caliber of people it raises, and the favor it evokes, the can be inspired to maintain their moral code, one which is a purely rational and morally upright one, even when it is hard or their feelings and desires pull them away, and misconstrue basic morality to \"not make sense\".</p>\n\n<p>So our role as Jews is to be held to an inconceivably high standard, that doesn't make rational sense, so as to help the rest of the world maintain the simple standards that do, even when their thoughts and feelings dissuade them from what is just bottom line the way you should live.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> It bears mentioning that, since we entered Canaan over 4000 years ago, we have at best tenuously upheld our end of <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0326.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the deal</a>, (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0528.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see also</a>). Consequently, the curses detailed in the two preceding sources have come upon us, in place of the blessings. So currently our observance is a more introverted exercise, as we are attempting to show that we have changed and that we can 'do it', so that we may witness the messianic era, be restored to our position, and in earnest fulfill our role. see Ray's answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/47513/4682\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>All of that said, by design, the irrational portions of our faith in fact have an ultimately rational function. May we <strong><em>SOON</em></strong> realize that purpose!</p>\n\n\n",

It has a function, but doesn't have a בית קיבול (receptacle).<br>\n<strong>Are wooden knives מקבל טמא?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'd prefer a <em>halachic</em> source (<em>Rif, Rosh, Rambam, Shulchan Aruch</em> et al) who discusses wooden knives directly, if possible.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Closest I could find for you. \nMaseches Keilim chapter 15 is where we find the laws of pshutei kli eitz (from here on p.k.e.). While it is true that p.k.e. are not mikabel tumah on a dioraisa level, they are mikabel tumah on a rabbinic level. But this only applies to certain types of p.k.e.</p>\n\n<p>In mishna 2 we find that a kneading board which is a p.k.e. is not mikabel tumah if it is a personal homeowner's board, as opposed to the professional baker's board. The difference being that the professional board is made 'in the shape of a keili', while the board for personal use does not resemble a kli. This was reason enough for the rabbis make this gzeira, and distinction.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the mishna there is a dispute about another p.k.e. called a Maarokh, and the rishonim have a dispute what the keili is, if it is a board for final scaling of the bread or a wooden spatula to remove the bread from the oven.  But what I want to point out is the Tiferres Yisroel #39. He explains the opinion of the chachamim in this machlokes as being that we were only gozer tumah on a p.k.e. that an item is placed upon, such as a board or a table being that it functions to a degree as a receptacle. As opposed to a p.k.e. that is used to carry an item from place to place, this is not considered a receiving receptacle. He brings a proof from chapter 12 mishna 2 where we find a pole of a scale that is not mikabel tumah in and of itself.</p>\n\n<p>This seems pertinent to your question although a knife per se was not discussed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=3&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chullin 3a</a> says that a tamei person can slaughter with a sharpened reed which cannot become tamei to avoid making the slaughtered animal tamei. This sharpened reed is a  פשוטי כלי עץ (see Tosafos mentioned below) and is essentially a wooden knife (although I doubt whether practically speaking a knife made from other wood could be made sharp enough to slaughter with).</p>\n\n<p>Tosafos on <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=7&daf=5&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Succah 5a</a> state that such a utensil does not become tamei even d'rabanan.</p>\n\n\n",

This פיוט, written by רבי אלעזר הקליר, was originally split into seven parts (hence, why it is known as a <strong>שבע</strong>תא). Each part was for a different ברכה in חזרת הש''ץ.

Yehuda does not subscribe to the general exposition that the verse ובשכבך means that Shema is to be recited at the time of lying down; thus, R Yehuda's view sets the time for <em>Ma'ariv</em> (and presumably Shema) much earlier at <em>plag haminchah</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תימא תיקשי ליה לנפשיה שהרי פלג המנחה מבעוד יום היא והוא אומר מיד כשיעבור פלג המנחה הוי זמן תפלת ערבית ויש לומר דלדידיה לא קשיא דלא דריש בשכבך ובקומך אבל לרבנן דדרשי קשיא דאינו זמן שכיבה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Joshua_Falk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Jacob Joshua Falk</a> objects to the idea that the tannaim are actually disagreeing about the fundamental nature of the time for Shema. In his opinion (hesitatingly offered against the earlier authorities) it is unreasonable to assume that they're all disputing when the time for lying down is. There are really only three possibilities:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Each person has their own time based on when they lie down.</li>\n<li>We follow the time that the majority of people lie down.</li>\n<li>Once the first person lies down it is the time of lying down.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Since there are no other possibilities and it would be strange for the tannaim to be debating the reality of when people actually lie down, they must all agree as to the essential biblical level law (which is that Shema is recited at the time of lying down which is determined via one of the above three methods). Rather, they are debating the rabbinic decrees surrounding the recitation of Shema. Because the Sages didn't want to burden the congregation they needed to set a time for everyone before they ate. Thus, the difference of opinion is whether that time is when kohanim eat, when the poor eat, or when the regular people eat, etc.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכל זה כתבתי לשיטת הגאון ולולי שאיני כדאי היה נראה לי לפרש בדרך אחר משום שנראה לי דוחק גדול לומר דכל הני תנאי פליגי בזמן ק\"ש דאורייתא דלכאורה אין לספק בזמן שכיבה דאורייתא אלא באחד משלשה פנים או שנאמר דכל חד וחד קודם שכיבה שלו או דהכל תלוי בשכיבה לרוב בני אדם או דמיד משיתחיל זמן שכיבה לשום אדם מתחיל זמן ק\"ש כדקי\"ל זריזין מקדימין למצות א\"כ ממילא תו אי אפשר לפרש להעמיד מחלוקת דכל הני תנאי בשיעורי טובא שאין טעם לדבר שיחלוקו במציאות לכך היה נראה לי לפרש דכל הני תנאי לאו בשיעורא דאורייתא פליגי דמדאורייתא בודאי ליכא אלא באחד מג' פנים שזכרנו מיהו לעולם פשטא דקרא דסמוך לשכיבה בעינן היינו אחר זמן אכילה דהוה ביממא כדאיתא ביומא אלא דכל הנך תנאי דפליגי בשיעורא דזמן ק\"ש היינו בשיעורא דרבנן קמיפלגי א' שתקנו תפלת ערבית ועשו ג\"כ סייג לדבריהם שלא יאכל קודם שיתפלל ותקנו ג\"כ להסמיך ק\"ש לתפלה שיהא קריאתו בציבור או משום ברוב עם הדרת מלך ומשום טורח הציבור הוצרכו לקבוע זמן מיוחד לכולם שיהא קודם זמן אכילה לכל חד כדאית ליה מר באכילת כהנים ומר באכילת עניים ואין בזה עקירת דבר מן התורה היינו כדפרישית במתני' דק\"ש שעל המטה עיקר כדפרישית לעיל בלשון רש\"י וגם התוס' מודים דיוצא בזה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do you have to consider neighbors when building a shul?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any halachic obligations to consider the averse effects that building a shul may have on Jewish neighbors? This may include things like lowering property value, noise and other disturbances, parking etc. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I haven't, yet, located any articles or sources that address this issue directly. However, there is a general rule that \"The law of the land is law\" - of course hwen the local or gov. law doesn't directly contradict halacha.</p>\n\n<p>Many townships / municipalities have already instituted certain laws that are geared to considering enighbors and maintaining a semblance of neighborly \"peace\". In my town, a shul being built must follow these rules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The building structure must not exceed a certain height. This is to preserve the beauty of the neighborhood. One shul in my neighborhood was built to tall, and they did not receive a building permit until they redesigned the shul.</p></li>\n<li><p>A new shul must provide a minimum number of parking spaces so that people don't park their cars on the side streets during Shabbat and Yom Tov. BTW - This is a HUGE problem in numerous communities, and during a Town Hall meeting, this along with the Eiruv issue are the 2 reasons many people vote against a shul (besides anti Semitism, which has its own problems.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Since I mentioned Eruv, this is a \"causal\" problem to building a shul. Many neighbors are anti-Eruv. One of the reasons mentioned is that they don't want people walking in the middle of the road on Shabbat \"hogging\" the roads. I agree with the neighbors. If you want the shul built, you need to convince the neighbors that you will behave properly and walk on the sidewalks where there is one or avoid hogging the road.</p></li>\n<li>Many shuls in my neighborhood do not allow <strong>any</strong> form of alcohol which includes wine. Correct! Kiddush is either not made in shul at all, or it is made on grape juice. Certainly, there is no schnapps in the shul anywhere. The reason? Kids got drunk and some of them got loud and rowdy and a few vandalized some cars. Neighbors complained, the kids were arrested. Point being - yes, parents <strong>should</strong> have been responsible to discipline the kids long before they got an arrest record. But, if the parents won't the shul and or community needs to take over. This policy has worked extremely well.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've mentioned some of the concerns that I believe are all valid. No doubt, there are others. Overall, yes, I do think that you NEED to consider your neighbors a lot when building the shul. In the end, it will be a huge help.</p>\n\n\n",

The statement of Abayye is very vague in this regard, but taken in aggregate with Rav Dimi's statement it seems fairly conclusive if one does not have the pre-conceived notion of embossed Shins.</p>\n\n<p>[b] Rashi's comments seem to be a concession to some understanding either of or akin to the <em>Shimmusha Rabbah</em> (cf. \"...on the outer compartment...\"), but makes it very clear (along with the <em>Mussaf Rashi</em> and the <em>Shittah HaMequbesseth</em> that he does NOT mean a literal Shin but something like creases that can be likened to a Shin but are not a Shin. His comments seem to be a bit inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>[c] The use of phrases \"slit\", \"creases\", \"reach to the stitching\", et al and the fact that the commentators repeatedly assert that what is on the <em>tefillin</em> is NOT a Shin, but only the \"likeness\" or shape of a Shin all seem to point to the divisions between the compartments in the <em>tefillah shel rosh</em> and not letters on the outer surfaces.</p>\n\n<p>[d] The wording of the <em>Shimmusha Rabbah</em> (cf. \"...and if the sides are reversed, it is of no concern to us...\") seems very imprecise for something which is supposedly a <em>halakhah le-Mosheh mi-Sinai</em>.</p>\n\n<p>[e] In light of the discovery of ancient <em>tefillin</em> at Qumran, Masada, Bar Kokhba caves, et al (see <a href=\"http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jtigay/nelc150slides/slide23.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) - that consistently are made the way and do not have Shins embossed on them (neither three nor four-headed) - it would seem that Shins are a much later development based on, but not necessitated by Abayye's statement.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Question</em></strong>: In light of the above, could it be that the \"Shin of the tefillin\" spoken of by Abayye and Rav Dimi of Neharde`a is really a reference to the pronounced division of the compartments of the <em>tefillah shel rosh</em> and not the practice of embossed Shins on the outer surfaces of it?

One day, with as much obviously fake pomp as he could muster, he said to the chavrusa \"It's not you - it's me.\"  The humor of the bad cliche broke the tension, and the chavrusa he broke up with actually told me about it with a positive association because of the humor.  That worked for him, probably won't work in every situation.</p>\n\n<p>If you are in a situation where you could switch subjects and are comfortable doing so, you could say that you are switching topics and therefore won't be able to continue.  If you are worried that he may be willing to switch along with you, you could line up a chavrusa before you tell him.  I once had a friend who switched what shiur he was in in order to switch chavrusas.  This depends on how flexible you are in your learning material.</p>\n\n<p>When I broke up with chavrusas, I was very straight-forward, although I tried to find things to say that weren't objectively negative about him. I would point out differences in our learning styles or preferences, and perhaps point out that <em>we</em> as a unit were not getting so much done.  This worked for me, but I always had very good friendships with my chavrusas.</p>\n\n<p>I had a Rebbe who told me the following account, although you have to have the patience for it - every time his chavrusa would walk out, or fall asleep, or space out or whatever, he opened up a very small masechta (I think his choice was Megillah, but you could pick a smaller one).  When he made a siyum, his chavrusa got the message that he needed to shape up.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Definitely a good idea to lay the blame on yourself and not on him as others have been saying as this will always be most comfortable for the other person.

Starting something new often gives someone a boost so he may understand this easily.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>What has worked for me is telling the Chavrusa that my schedule changed and I am unable to continue learning at this time, thereby blaming me and not him, so it does not get personal.</p>\n<p>For one in Yeshiva, perhaps a Rabbi or Rosh Yeshiva can approach the one you want to drop, and suggest that he has a Chavrusa that would be better for him.

Often, he does this voluntarily including \"mundane\" tasks such as sweeping the floors and turning on the lights and heat before people came in to daven. (Used to be more common decades ago than it is now. Seems that now, we pay NON-Jews to do this job! Sad, in a way.)</p>\n\n<p>One explanation I heard from someone a while ago is that \"shamash\" is spelled the same way as \"shemesh\" meaning \"sun\". In the case of Chanukah candles, like the sun, the shamash provides the light for the other candles. Of course, this is stretching the explanation, a bit, but, then again, it's possible that the word \"shemesh\" used for \"sun\" may have originated from the word \"shamash\", anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Also, slight nuance. \"Eved\" means \"worker\" or \"slave\", implying that there is a boss or master or someone controlling the eved. \"Shamash\" doesn't imply that there is a boss, necessarily (it could, though). The shamash candle has no \"boss\". As a matter of fact, it IS the boss!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Israel Am v.s. Goy\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is Israël an Am or Goy or both?\nwhats the Torah definition and best translation of both terms?</p>\n\n<p>Because it seems that Israël is being called both Am as a Goy. \n(Am Kadosh: Devarim 26:19 and Goy Kadosh: Bamidbar 19:6)</p>\n\n<p>Both terms seem to refer to a group of people, \nI once heard that Am is related to Im 'with/togetherness', and Goy to Geviyah 'body', any thoughts on this ? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Malbim from <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32825&st=&pgnum=168\">ספר הכרמל entry for גוי</a>:</p>\n\n<p>Goy is a gathering of individual entities, without any higher purpose. It is derived from גוה, a body or unit.  It is also used as a reference to a large group, which is what it means when used in reference to the Jewish people.</p>\n\n<p>Am is a higher level, which references a unified group with a guided purpose, whether it be governmental or otherwise.  Therefore, a person can belong to an am - עמי.  But a person never belongs to a goy - there is no גויי, my nation.  (Hashem has גוייך, but that is not His belonging to it, but his owning it.)</p>\n\n<p>I would translate it as Am = nation and Goy = people, or group of people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>The two terms have held different meanings at different times, eg. the Israelites were referred to as a 'goy kadosh' (holy nation) in the Bible, but today the term 'goyim' more frequently is used for non Jews. Language changes over time, and this is true within the Tanakh too, as terms' meanings change as a result of the passing of time between the various authors. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of the differences between Deuteronomy and Numbers, as you pointed out, again it is the matter of different authors. Scholars frequently date Deuteronomy as a \"later\" text (that is, in relation to the rest of the Pentateuch). For example <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/3263006\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moshe Weinfeld, in \"Deuteronomy--The Present State of Inquiry\"</a> (<em>Society of Biblical Literature</em>, 1967), argues in favor of the theory of W. M. L. de Wette, who claimed as early as 1805 that Deuteronomy's law code matched the reforms of Josiah and specifically the efforts to centralize the Temple cult in Jerusalem. Josiah's discovery of a \"book of the law\" and his efforts to reform Israelite religion (2 Kings 22-23) are commonly taken to refer to the \"discovery\" of a fifth book of Moses. In this light, differences in language between Numbers and Deuteronomy (not to mention the rest of the Pentateuch, e.g. the commandment to שמור vs. זכור the Sabbath) come into focus.</p>\n\n<p>When the terms are used in the <em>same verse</em>, we can see them as complementary terms. As @YEZ pointed out, one example is Chronicles 1 17:21, which reads:</p>\n\n<p>וּמִי כְּעַמְּךָ יִשְׂרָאֵל, גּוֹי אֶחָד בָּאָרֶץ:  אֲשֶׁר הָלַךְ הָאֱלֹהִים לִפְדּוֹת לוֹ עָם, לָשׂוּם לְךָ שֵׁם גְּדֻלּוֹת וְנֹרָאוֹת--לְגָרֵשׁ מִפְּנֵי עַמְּךָ אֲשֶׁר-פָּדִיתָ מִמִּצְרַיִם, גּוֹיִם.  כב</p>\n\n<p>In the first phrase, \"U-mi ke-'amha yisra'el, goy 'ehad ba-arets,\" we find a classic example of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelism_(rhetoric)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Biblical parallelism</a>, the main rhetorical and poetic form of the Hebrew Bible. In part A of the phrase, the term \"Am\" is used, and in the second, its synonym, \"Goy,\" replaces it.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3264466?seq=7\" rel=\"nofollow\">E.A. Speiser</a> has argued, the terms have complementary meanings. \"Am\" does not exclusively reference the Jewish people, but it is also the only term to be used on conjunction with the tetragrammaton, e.g. Am YHWH - the people of God. \"Am\" has more of a relationship with family and kinship, and perhaps can be best translated as \"people,\" whereas \"Goy\" is a <em>nation,</em> which can be established, built, destroyed, etc. In the end, Speiser argues that Israel was <em>both</em> an \"Am\" and a \"Goy.\" Though the terms had different meanings, they were complementary and together characterized the Israelite people.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Das Torah regarding taking notes during Shiurim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I wanted to know what the Seforim for Bnei Torah say about writing notes during a shiur.<br>\nShould one listen without writing anything and only later listen to a recorder while writing notes?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm unaware of specific halachic rulings or teshuvot regarding this, so this is my observation.</p>\n\n<p>About thirty years ago, when I was in high school, my freshman rebbe would absolutely forbid recording him, and occasionally confiscated anyone bringing a recorder into the shiur. I will explain his thinking, later. I can't say what was done at adult shiurim, as I never really attended them at the time.</p>\n\n<p>My kids recently graduated high school, and I think their yeshiva also did not allow recorders, so I don't think that attitude has changed.</p>\n\n<p>I do see people bringing recorders to adult shiurim. My rav gives a bi-weekly shiur on Sefer Yeshayahu. No one I know brings a recorder, but the rav himself records his own shiur and uploads it to a web site the next day.</p>\n\n<p>My take - I understand why high schools forbid recording, and, furthermore, I think adults attending shiurim should take notes rather than record. I think recorders tend to be used as a crutch to get the material and allows the listener to slack off and even fall asleep. Certainly, this is done often in High Schools, i.e. kids doze off more when they record (they may doze off, anyway, for other reasons) - at least that's what rebbes and principles have found and some have told me this. This is besides other problems that high school kids have been using their recorders for that cause other behavioral problems.</p>\n\n<p>I have also found that even after I recorded a shiur, I had to write notes from the recording, anyway - esp. if I had to study for a test. So, it would have been more efficient had I written the notes in the first place. In summary, I think notes are better than recordings - it encourages better attention during the shiur, and, if you take notes as you're listening, you may write a question that pops up at the time which you'll ask the rav / rebbe then - something, I think is less likely when you passively let your recorder tape everything and you rely on listening to it afterwards. By then, you may not be able to ask your question!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In meged givas olam Rabbi Shurkin quotes reb Moshe Feinstein as saying never record a shiur! Learn HOW to listen to a shiur by listening to it live. Whatever you get, you get, and by the next days shiur hopefully your skills to listen to a shiur will have improved and you will grasp more. And so on each day.</p>\n\n<p>But to answer your question, it all depends on you. Are you skilled at shorthand note taking or is it a distraction? There is no one size fits all answer. I wasted many shiurim learning the proper note taking skills, but at the same time developed a skill that helped me keep record of many other shiurim. Is that yotza schar bihefsed or yotza hefsed bischar? Tough call.</p>\n\n\n",

What, if anything, is it a segulah for? Why is it done on shmini atzeret/simchas torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>During Simchas Torah we have the minhag of giving everybody an aliyah. Most shuls will call up boys under bar mitzvah who are old enough to know what thay are doing/ The final aliyah is considered a zechus because the person says the bracha with all of the children around him to show that they too are included in the mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>By this, I mean that he is introducing the children to the Torah and impressing them with importance of the Torah. He is showing them that they are part of the kahal and that they too can be part of the inheritence of the Jewish people. That is also part of the reason that we repeat the bracha of Yaakov (Hamal'ach hagoel ... ) The person who brings them to the Torah and the bracha of Yaakov can be considered to have a segulah of meriting children and grandchildren just as Yaakov Avinu did (as shown in the quote below).</p>\n\n<p>Another reason is that there are statements that someone who brings bracha on someone else can then receive that bracha. For example, someone who arranges shidduchim for others merits his (or her) own children finding shidduchim. Someone davening for refuah of someone else receives a refuah. Here bringing the children under the \"chupah\" of Torah merits his own children and grandchildren being brought under the \"chupah\" of Torah (and of course he has to have some for this to happen).</p>\n\n<p>In Kol Hanearim under the Talis, he actually shows them that they are as dear to him as his own children.</p>\n\n<p>Another point is that it is similar to the mitzvah of Hakhel in which the children who are too young to understand are brought as well. This last is a point that I thought of myself as I have not seen it mentioned. The similarity just struck me.</p>\n\n<p>The following is an exerpt that illustrates this point. Follow the link for the whole article.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishjournal.com/articles/item/all_the_children_19981009\" rel=\"nofollow\">All the Children</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One year, however, the auction for Kol Hanearim in my synagogue was\n  unusually competitive. When finally over, I asked the man who fiercely\n  bid the highest, why he vied for this honor.</p>\n  \n  <p>Surprised by my question, he replied as if it were self-evident: \"The\n  one who supervises scores of little children crowded under the tallit,\n  reciting the same blessing Jacob uttered over his grandchildren, is\n  himself guaranteed Jewish grandchildren. Could I want less for\n  myself?\"</p>\n  \n  <p>These words come to me again and again, whenever I contemplate the\n  unique Torah portion, Vezot Haberakha, the only parasha not identified\n  with a specific Shabbat. Rather, it is reserved for the joyous Simchat\n  Torah holiday, with its unique Kol Hanearim ceremony, and as such\n  deserves close analysis.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Talmud, in Sukkah 42a, referring to Vezot Haberakha, provides a\n  provocative comment: \"Our rabbis taught: A minor who is able to speak,\n  his father must teach him Torah.... What could be meant by Torah? Rav\n  Hamnuna replied, the Scriptural verse [Deuteronomy 33:4], 'Moses\n  commanded us a law, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.'\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Certainly these lessons are themes that the beautiful Kol Hanearim\n  ceremony emphasizes. First, each child has a right to Torah, an\n  inheritance that comes with birth.</p>\n  \n  <p>Second, Kol Hanearim suggests that Torah requires effort. Neither\n  children nor adults will acquire knowledge unless they work at\n  studying Torah. If they put in the effort, they will be rewarded with\n  the greatest gift: the Torah itself.</p>\n  \n  <p>And, finally, we must appreciate that a Jewish life must include the\n  community of fellow Jews. The little children are blessed as part of\n  an entire group -- part of a future community -- because Torah can't\n  be lived in isolation. Instead, our blessing emphasizes the need for\n  everyone to be involved with the Jewish community, for only together\n  do we comprise the congregation that both Vezot Haberakha and Simchat\n  Torah celebrate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Technically, she should first say the bracha and then light the candles. However, once she has said the bracha, she has accepted Shabbos and is forbidden to light the candles. Thus, she lights the candle, put the match or lighting device away, closes her eyes, says the bracha, and then opens them to accept the \"new\" light <strong>after</strong> the bracha.</p>\n\n<p>Note that she does not close her eyes until <strong>after</strong> she has extinguished the match or other lighting device.

He seemed to accept this.</p>\n\n<p>Then when myself and other people started to point at stars (with our fingers, a laser pointer, and the binocular) this same inquisitive lad started telling us that in Judaism it is forbidden to point at stars. Being Ashkanazi I had never heard this, but other children were familiar with the tradition. I explained to them that the rule <em>probably</em> has root in the differentiation between our religion and that of the Greeks, who believed that the stars represented their false deities. Because I am not pointing to explain a false deity but rather to explain a scientific concept, the pointing should be acceptable. This explanation was <em>not</em> accepted so I again suggested to the young man to consult his father on the issue.</p>\n\n<p>In the great Jewish tradition, I've now told a story and here follow the questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What is the basis of the tradition (minhag) to not point at stars?</li>\n<li>Assuming that this is not a Mizvah from above, did the wise man who made the rule explain why?</li>\n<li>Considering that I regularly give sky tours to the devout and also to those who do not express their relationship with their creator on a daily basis, how might I better anticipate and cater to the unique traditions of our people? Simply \"not pointing\" will not work, I probably do more pointing than talking.</li>\n<li>Should I warn groups that I point at stars before we start, at the same time that I ask them to disable cellphones and other sources of light?</li>\n<li>Are there any resources for specifically Jewish tales and observations of the stars?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would actually love to give the tours a more Jewish angle, especially considering the heavy Arab influence in the stars' names due to their research on the topic (before Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, anyway). Being sensitive to Jewish traditions is therefore very important, however I stress that the tours should remain a scientific exercise and not a religious exercise.

The Be'er Heitev in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01975_part_28.html#HtmpReportNum0009_L2\">Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 426:2:(6)</a> mentions this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בשל''ה והג''ה י''נ שלא יסתכל בה רק פעם הראשון שיראה עמידתה ואח''כ אסור להסתכל בה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding the <strong>stars</strong> it says in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01975_part_21.html#HtmpReportNum0003_L2\">Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 227:1</a> that one makes a Bracha on shooting stars, but it says nothing about not pointing or staring at them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>א</strong> עַל הַזִּקִּים, וְהוּא כְּמִין <strong>כּוֹכָב</strong> הַיּוֹרֶה כְּחֵץ בְּאֹרֶךְ הַשָּׁמַיִם מִמָּקוֹם לְמָקוֹם וְנִמְשָׁךְ אוֹרוֹ כְּשֵׁבֶט; וְעַל רְעָדַת הָאָרֶץ; וְעַל  הַבְּרָקִים; וְעַל הָרְעָמִים; וְעַל רוּחוֹת שֶׁנָּשְׁבוּ בְּזַעַף, עַל כָּל א' מֵאֵלּוּ, אוֹמֵר: בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה' אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם עוֹשֶׂה מַעֲשֵׂה בְרֵאשִׁית; וְאִם יִרְצֶה יֹאמַר: בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה' אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם שֶׁכֹּחוֹ וּגְבוּרָתוֹ מָלֵא עוֹלָם. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: <strong>Mainstream Halacha does not mention anything about pointing at the stars</strong>. If certain families have a custom not to point at them, they have no right to make others feel inferior about not keeping their custom, nor may they impose their views on others.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# A theological problem with the Miriam \"Magdalene\" story in Chagiga 4b\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is an interesting story at the bottom of  Chagiga 4b, top of 5a.</p>\n\n<p>The Angel of Death is telling a Rabbi of an incident that happened.</p>\n\n<p>The AoD has an assistant. The AoD tells him to reap Miriam A but he accidentally reaps Miriam B instead. The assistant asks if he should rectify the mistake by exchanging the two but AoD says not to. The unspent years allotted to Miriam B are given to a talmid chacham who will generate mitzvos for Miriam B but Miriam B does not enter the afterlife proper. She just sort of hangs around with the AoD in limbo until her years run out.</p>\n\n<p>I accept that this may be an allegory, but how is it theologically acceptable that this sort of \"creative accounting\" goes on at the expense of people in a universe where God meticulously decrees every year \"who by fire, who by water etc?\" It seems that the answer to \"why do bad things happen to good people\" is because God tends not to care sufficiently to stop them as he can retroactively resolve the injustice by giving people more schar (heavenly reward) at the end, like an omnipotent airline that gives you free passes to the airport lounge because they were able to not lose your baggage but did anyway. Does God believe that he can create suffering such as the death of Miriam B (Which was the fault of heaven and not a human actor) and just make up for it by awarding schar? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Chagigah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Chagigah.pdf</a>\nTosafos says that Miriam (probably Miriam A) was the mother of A Certain Person. Both Miriams are titled \"Magdala\" with different spellings.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Gemara you quote asks and answers that very question.</p>\n\n<p>Miriam B was doing something dangerous and thereby she was at high risk of dying. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היכי יכלת לה? הות נקיטא מתארא בידה והות קא שגרא  ומחריא תנורא שקלתא ואנחתא אגבה דכרעה קדחא ואיתרע מזלה ואייתיתה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>היכי יכלת לה</strong>. מאחר שלא הגיע זמנה: <strong>הות נקיטא מתארא בידה</strong>. היתה אוחזת בידה האוד של תנור שקורין פרגו''ן: <strong>וקא מחריא תנורא</strong>. מכבדת את התנור: <strong>אותיבתיה אגבה דכרעה</strong>. הושיבתו על גב רגלה ונכות והורע מזלה: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"How did you manage to kill her? She was cleaning out the oven, and [accidentaly] put the [burning hot] instrument on her legs, got burnt and - because of her bad luck - was easy prey for the AoD.\"</p>\n\n<p>Part of your yearly decree \"who by fire\" includes \"if statements\". <em>If you are at the wrong place at the wrong time - and do not have special merits - you're going to be one of the victims.</em></p>\n\n<p>We have a similar <em>rule</em> that <em>the Satan prosecutes at a time of danger</em>. He has more <em>power</em> then, as you've stepped into a dangerous \"if statement\".</p>\n\n<p>So Miriam B was <strong>not</strong> killed by accident - it was part of the divine plan. No injustice and no need to rectify such.</p>\n\n<p>As to why some Talmid Chacham gets her \"unused miles\"? That's harder to explain, but it seems that there are a certain amount of \"man hours\" that are pre-defined need to be filled.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Michtam L'Dovid, Berachos 2:8, in addressing a different question, writes that this Gemara is not an example of Hashem acting unjustly, because it wasn't Hashem who did it, but  rather the Angel of Death - דמלאך המות הוא דעבד הכי, ולאו הקב\"ה אמר לו להמיתו.  This would then be an example of an angel making a mistake, not of Hashem being fast and loose with people's lives.</p>\n\n<p>This, of course, doesn't really address your question until we explain why Hashem should allow/create angels making mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>In Da'as Tevunos Chelek 2 Simanim 29-35 he discusses how it comes to be that angels make mistakes.  I summarized it <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/34684/4794\">here</a>.  The Ramchal explains that this is a necessary step in the existence of the Sitra Achra / forces of Evil and thereby the Yetzer Hara.  G-d did not directly create Evil, because Hashem is the Source of Good, and evil would not come forth (directly) from Him (Da'as Tevunos simanim 104 and 106).  Therefore, in order for an entity of evil, and really all evil, to come into existence, Hashem \"orchestrated\" that it would come about through a lack of His providing the necessary spiritual energy or awareness for the angel to understand its task, and through its misinterpretation it would fulfill that role.</p>\n\n<p>So in short, this is a result of the allowance of the ability for angels to make mistakes, and angels making mistakes was an integral part of the creation by an entirely good G-d of the framework of a world with a choice between good and evil.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Elayshiv in his commentary on that gemarah indicates that the entire episode was a dream and therefore we cannot extrapolate from it. </p>\n\n\n",

But She lies in the arms of Her husband and returns from there to be with the righteous, then returning to Her husband, as it is written: <em>In the evening she would come, and in the morning she would go</em> (Esther 2:14). <em>In the evening she would come</em>—to her husband; and in the morning, <em>She would go</em>—to be among the righteous of the world, everything being done with the permission of Her husband [cf.

Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>Please kindly cite your sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>First</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>The <em>`Arokh HaShulhan</em>, <em>Hilkhoth Tefillin</em>, <em>siman</em> 43:1-14, explains the laws relating to bodily functions and the proper donning/treatment of <em>tefillin</em> at those times.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Rambam appears to be more <em>mahmir</em> and only allows one to urine in his <em>tefillin</em> under duress or if he forgot and began to relieve himself (see there), the <em>Shulhan Arukh</em> (and the plain meaning of the <em>Gemara</em>) indicate that - <em>me-`iqqar ha-din</em> - it is permissible to urinate while wearing <em>tefillin</em> in certain permissible locations (again, see there). It seems that the <em>Hazal</em> made a <em>gezerah</em> against it lest someone come to defecate or flatulate while wearing them, activities which are expressly forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, it would seem that the unintentional possibility of urinary incontinence would not prevent one from wearing <em>tefillin</em>, at least during a time when they do not expect it to be likely to experience such incontinence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Another approach</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Gemara</em> in <em>b.Berakhoth</em> 22b (cf. Rambam, <em>Hilkhoth Tefillah</em> 4:10) indicates that if someone experiences urinary incontinence during the <em>Shemoneh `Esre</em> he simply needs to pause until it stops before continuing. However, various <em>Rishonim</em> discuss the implications - <em>le-qula</em> - if urine is contained, splashed on one's garment, and/or  covered by a clean, dry outer garment. Other <em>Rishonim</em> discuss this issue as well and most agree that urinary incontinence during one's <em>tefillah</em> is only a problem which requires action when one is aware of it and/or it drips or pools on the ground beneath him.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, it would seem that a disabled person who wears an adult diaper could continue to pray even when experiencing known urinary incontinence, and all the more so when it is unknown.</p>\n\n<p>What does this have to do with <em>tefillin</em>? Because the <em>iqqar</em> time to wear <em>tefillin</em> is during the <em>Shemoneh `Esre</em> (cf. Rambam, <em>Hilkhoth Tefillin</em> 4:26; <em>b.Berakhoth</em> 15a). And, since <em>Hazal</em> does not even mention the need to remove one's <em>tefillin</em> in a such a case of involuntary incontinence, it would appear that they are not concerned about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>So, <em>le-'aniytuh da`ati</em>, it would seem that - pending certain reasonable details and conditions - the answer to this question is: <strong>MUTAR</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Thus, only Shabbat has to be considered a 24 hour day. For example the sun moon and stars were created on the fourth \"day\" so that \"before\" then could not have been days as we know them. Before Yom HaShishi, each day was turned on and off explicitly. It is only at the very end (Vayechulu) do we have the actual time being significant.</p>\n\n<p>Also consider that only man has an appreciation of time.

Here to, once we have skipped tachanun for most of the month, we don't say it for the rest of the month. First there's Rosh Hashanah (2 days), Yom Kippur (2 days), between YK and Sukkot (4 days), and Sukkot (9-10 days). That totals more than half, so there's no tachanun.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'll attempt to answer both your question and what's in the recent comments:</p>\n\n<p>It was estimated that it took 5-7 days for travelers who made the pilgrimage (aliyah laregel) from the furthest places to return home. Thus, the week after the end of Succot is considered a semi holiday.</p>\n\n<p>Why is Tishrei different than Nissan when there is no Tachanun the whole month? I surmise that Tachanun is said during Aseret Y'mei Teshuva already. Since this is a period when you are confessing your sins and are asking for G-d's mercy and forgiveness, it is a time you'd WANT to say Tachanun. So, no matter how you view things, you're saying Tachnaun during some part of the month, anyway. Perhaps, that's what went into the thinking of those that restart Tachanun on Tishrei 24 (Tishrei 25 in years such as this year.)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, based on what I mentioned the question should be \"reversed\" - Why is Nissan different than Tishrei? I understand cancelling Tachanun after Pesach, but why before it?</p>\n\n\n",

Another point is even the leftovers from Chanuka lights can be used as long as they were used to complete the mitzvah.

Taking his words into consideration, if wearing leftover shabbos clothes would confuse this distinction, it might be better to avoid doing it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I'm not following the context / reasoning behind your question. Clothes do not get a \"huktzah lemitzvah\" status (attached to a specific mitzvah or purpose) with regards to wearing it for Shabbat. People wear their Shabbat clothes midweek often. My son has about 50 identical white shirts (don't ask me why!) I know that he doesn't have shirts specifically marked \"Shabbat only\".</p>\n\n<p>If you can wear a Shabbat shirt during weekdays when it is good, why can't you wear it when it's worn out? As to whether you should EVER wear worn out clothes - that's a separate question that you're not asking.</p>\n\n<p>If I'm missing a factor in the intent of your question, you may wish to edit and clarify it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# A rabbi asked me to light candles before weekday Mincha/Ma'ariv. Is this customary? Is there a bracha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Last night, I was pulled in off the street to help an unfamiliar shul make a minyan for Mincha/Ma'ariv. The rabbi greeted me, and when he learned I do not speak Hebrew, he gave me a very nice blessing about my future with Hashem. Then he said, \"We're going to light the candles. Please, …\" and he ushered me toward a table covered with candlesticks. Then he went to start davening, and I was left to figure out what to do.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a Conservative Jew, though I feel pretty comfortable in an Orthodox environment, however this was probably only my second or third time davening with a mostly Hasidic minyan. I have never heard of lighting candles on a weekday night when there is no holiday, and I didn't know whether to say a bracha, and if so, which one. I just lit the candles without a bracha, and then we went on to daven. Does anyone know more about this practice?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 28)\n\n<p>Many synagogues - mainly Orthodox, not specifically Hassidic, light two candles in front of the Chazzan's (cantor's) table. The candles are on during the duration of the prayers and extinguished afterwards. (Some places use electric \"candles\"; others use wax. I prefer the wax, though it is a bit more dangerous, smelly, and messy.) It has nothing to do with yahrtzeit or any occasion other than praying, itself. </p>\n\n<p>I located the reason for this custom in \n<a href=\"http://www.dinonline.org/2011/02/24/parashas-vayakhel-the-mini-temple%E2%80%94halachos-of-shuls/\">this article</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Shulchan Aruch (151:9) writes that it is customary to light\n  candles in order to honor the shul. The Mishnah Berurah (27) explains\n  that this corresponds to the practice in the Temple. He goes even\n  further and rules (514:31) that although it is prohibited to light a\n  candle at home on Yom Tov during the daytime (because the light is\n  superfluous), it is permitted to light candles in shul. The Shelah\n  (Tetzaveh 33) adds that candles should stay lit throughout the\n  prayers, comparing this to the ner tamid in the Temple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The Shelah's comment is exactly as I had conjectured before I read the article. However, it does question if this is redundant if the shul already has a Ner Tamid. Many Hasidic shtiebels that are in a home, do not have one, so this makes more sense.</p>\n\n<p>IMO, this is a nice custom, as it adds light to the shul, and, in a sense, signals everyone that prayers are about to start. (This could be one of the reasons for the custom, BTW.) It's a lot \"friendlier\" than someone banging on the bimah or even worse, on his Siddur. (In many places, I've found, the rabbi or gabbai yelling \"Shah!\", doesn't really do the job of getting the shmoozers' attentions.)</p>\n\n<p>There is no blessing for the lighting, so you acted properly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Many chasidim light candles on the yahrtzeits of important figures in chasidic history. One of the more widely-practiced ones (in the US) is to light a candle on the Yahrtzeit of R' Mendel of Riminov, which is the night after Lag Ba'omer. Chasidish shuls or shuls with lots of chasidim tend to leave out candles for people to light in the shul. </p>\n\n<p>I've even seen one place which has a lot of minyanim where they leave a tray out all the time on the assumption that someone will have a reason to light a candle just about every night. No bracha is made.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I agree with DanF's answer above. This has nothing to do with yahrzeit candles. If someone has a yahrzeit they should light a 24 hour candle to help remind him to think about the special qualities of the person who passed away, doing Mitzvos and/or learning Torah in his/her memory, and normally it is lit at home where one spends time and will notice the candle. </p>\n\n<p>Just one point: the custom was (as you quote) to show honor to the shul. Similarly we light candles before Shabbos to honor the day. This is a very practical thing. Before electric (or gas) lighting, people would often not bother (often due to poverty) to light candles when it got dark. They would just eat quickly and go to sleep.</p>\n\n<p>Chazal required us to honor Shabbos with lights, so that we would not be sitting in the dark every Shabbos eve. This would make for dismal quick meals, with many opportunities for lack of Shalom Bayis (domestic tranquility). The Rabbis felt that shalom Bayit  was such an important factor to Shabbat that they declared it to be a Rabbinic Mitzvah. Therefore we make a Bracha before we light them.</p>\n\n<p>People carried this idea of honor to the shul and began the custom of lighting up the shul as well, during the davening. Since it is a custom, we do not recite a Bracha. </p>\n\n<p>Some people use two candles. Others use 6 candles, to be similar but not exactly like the menorah in the Bait haMikdash, which had 7 branches with a light on each.\nOthers use an electric light or 6 branch menorah to add \"special light\" besides the normal overhead light.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, today, we are just adding lights (which is still a plus and we therefore should still make a Bracha on Shabbat). Originally these lights were the only ones and added greatly to the atmosphere of the home and shul.</p>\n\n\n",

He taught that one should speak to Hashem in one's own words for at least an hour each day, thanking and praising Him, doing teshuvah, asking to come close to Him, and asking for any material or spiritual things we need. Though the main emphasis in much of his writings is on praying about spiritual matters, Rebbe Nachman also taught that one should pray for any physical thing one needs, even something as insignificant as a missing button on one's coat. Here is one paragraph partially summarizing his approach:</p>\n\n<p>\"It has already been explained how important it is to seclude yourself and pray, and how powerful a method this is. It is the path by which we can come close to God. Everybody should set aside fixed periods every day and express himself before God in his own native language. It is much easier to say what you need to say when you are using your own language. <strong>You should set forth whatever is in your heart. Use every kind of appeal and argument. Use words that will endear you to God and win His favor.</strong> Plead with Him to draw you closer. Every individual knows his own personal pain and sorrow and the distance that separates him from God. It is impossible to convey the true greatness of this method. It is superior to all others. It is the way of serving God, and through following it everyone can attain the ultimate good in this world and in the World to Come. <strong>There is nothing that cannot be accomplished by prayer and entreaty.</strong> The greatest of the Tzaddikim achieved what they did only through this practice. Think about it carefully and you will see the greatness of this path. Set aside one hour every day for this, the rest of the day be happy -- and then you will be truly blessed.\" (Likutei Eitzot, Hitbodedut).</p>\n\n<p>More can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.azamra.org/Advice/meditation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.azamra.org/Advice/meditation.html</a> and here: <a href=\"http://www.azamra.org/Advice/prayer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.azamra.org/Advice/prayer.html</a> and here: www.azamra.org/Essential/hisbodedus.htm</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Shalom Arush, a Breslover Rosh Yeshivah in Israel, has two additional teachings regarding praying for a particular thing. If one is in need of something very important, he teaches that one should pray for six hours straight for that thing, or for an hour a day for that thing for a whole month.

Many scholars are convinced that the biblical Israelite day started at daybreak.

When the Bible states “there was evening and there was morning, one day” in Genesis 1:5, its meaning is literal: God completed what was stated earlier during the “daylight period” and this was followed by evening, and when morning came, the day ended – “one day.” The Hebrew is erev and boker. The first means “evening” and the second “morning” or “daybreak.” <a href=\"http://booksnthoughts.com/why-women-must-start-shabbat-before-men/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://booksnthoughts.com/why-women-must-start-shabbat-before-men/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the festival calendar clearly alludes to a division of time that regards the evening as part of the day just ended. ... Second, the talmudic innovation of reckoning a day from the eve before suggests a larger view of life.

While it may be true that the Rashbam interpreted verse in question (Genesis 1:5) in a way that implies that night follows the day, he is in no way making a legal statement, and as he himself says several times (see especially his comment to Exodus 21:2) his interpretations aren't meant to have practical import or refer to a practice by any historical group. </p>\n\n<p>In the Temple, it's true that 'the night follows the day', but that's a limited statement referring to sacrificial law: a sacrifice brought during the day can still be eaten or burned the following night. (Temura 14a) However, for most laws, such as when the Shabbos/Sabbath begins, the Mishna describes that it began the previous evening even in the time of the Temple. (See Mishna Sukka 5:5, for example)</p>\n\n<p>Some scholars merely assume that, because the Bible doesn't explicitly say that the day follows the night, that the earlier Israelites began their days at daybreak. Perhaps <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=GTjS1ADrbMkC&lpg=PA98&ots=rcRKG9y23q&dq=%22The%20Jewish%20day%2C%20like%20the%20Roman%20day%2C%20was%20divided%20into%20twelve%20equal%20hours%2C%20from%20sunrise%20to%20sunset.%20That%20of%20course%20means%20that%20the%20length%20of%20an%20hour%20varied%20according%20to%20the%20length%20of%20the%20day%20and%20the%20season%20of%20the%20year.%22&pg=PA97#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Jewish%20day,%20like%20the%20Roman%20day,%20was%20divided%20into%20twelve%20equal%20hours,%20from%20sunrise%20to%20sunset.%20That%20of%20course%20means%20that%20the%20length%20of%20an%20hour%20varied%20according%20to%20the%20length%20of%20the%20day%20and%20the%20season%20of%20the%20year.%22&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">some also believe</a> that this is the implication of the Gospel of John 11:9-10:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Are there not twelve hours in the day?

Based on the above reasoning, why should we say tachanun at all during the month of Tishrei? (<em>assuming that we don't say tachanun after Sukkos</em>)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Nissan starts without Tachnun because it is the time when the Mishkan was inaugurated - that is the first 12 days. Then the 13th is the Isru Chag of those 12 days (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1609&pgnum=182\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Tzemach Tzedek quoting the Maharil</a>), and then there is no Tachnun on the 14th because the Korban Pesach was brought, and then Pesach. So there is no opportunity to say Tachanun until the majority of the month is already without Tachnun. (See Shulchan Aruch HaRav O.C. <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh3/1/429/9.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">429:9</a>).</p>\n\n<p>In Tishrei, that situation only exists when the end of Succos is reached, so it would seem that the rule that once you don't say Tachnun for the majority of the month you don't say it for the rest of the month only applies once the majority of the month has actually passed without Tachnun.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rav of our shul spoke about this when discussing our shul minhag of not saying tachanun until Rosh Chodesh Cheshvan. Note that this is our shul minhag as other shuls in the community start tachanun after Isru Chag (or maybe on Isru Chag, I am not sure).</p>\n\n<p>The first part of the month continues tachanun because of the inyan of teshuvah and din. After Succos, we continue not saying tachanun because of the inyan of simcha and adding to Shmini Atzeres because it is a \"Regel bifnei Atzmo\" rather than the end of the chag (like the last day of Pesach). We also do not say tachanun for the week after Shavuos since there was a week afterwards that the korbon chagigah could be brought.  Even though a separate chagigah was not brought on Shmini Atzeres (and the Ymei miluim of Succos are over) we still extend the simcha of the Chag. </p>\n\n<p>This is from memory as to the explanation that our Rav gave for our shul minhag (which goes back to the founding of our shul as a separate minyon.  Note that other shuls do not have this minhag (as I said earlier).</p>\n\n<p>I do not recall the sources that our rav brought. Since there are those that do say tachanun, there is what to rely on in both ways.</p>\n\n\n",

It may also be a form of genevat da'at, as you are definitely misleading someone - you THREATEN to sue, but in your own mind, you don't intend to do this.

    "content": "# Significance of Noach's actions upon leaving the ark\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The whole world has just been destroyed due to the failures of the generation of Noach. Noach and his family live for many days in the ark and after the waters subside they leave.</p>\n\n<p>Noach builds an alter to Hashem upon leaving the ark and brings up sacrifices (Bereishit 8:20-21):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כ וַיִּבֶן נֹחַ מִזְבֵּחַ, לַיהוָה; וַיִּקַּח מִכֹּל הַבְּהֵמָה הַטְּהֹרָה, וּמִכֹּל הָעוֹף הַטָּהוֹר, וַיַּעַל עֹלֹת, בַּמִּזְבֵּחַ.  כא וַיָּרַח יְהוָה, אֶת-רֵיחַ הַנִּיחֹחַ, וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֶל-לִבּוֹ לֹא-אֹסִף לְקַלֵּל עוֹד אֶת-הָאֲדָמָה בַּעֲבוּר הָאָדָם, כִּי יֵצֶר לֵב הָאָדָם רַע מִנְּעֻרָיו; וְלֹא-אֹסִף עוֹד לְהַכּוֹת אֶת-כָּל-חַי, כַּאֲשֶׁר עָשִׂיתִי</p>\n  \n  <p>And Noah built an altar to the Lord, and he took of all the clean animals and of all the clean fowl and brought up burnt offerings on the altar. And the Lord smelled the pleasant aroma, and the Lord said to Himself, \"I will no longer curse the earth because of man, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth, and I will no longer smite all living things as I have done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How did Noach know that building an alter for Hashem would 'inspire' Him not to carry out another armageddon. What is the significance of Hashem smelling the pleasing aroma upon Noach making the offering? </p>\n\n<p>(I have heard that there is a connection between, רֵיחַ הַנִּיחֹחַ, and the fact that the sense of smell was the only sense not to be contaminated by the sin of Adam. Is that connection relevant here?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From logic, Hashem is not a physical being that \"smells\" the physical odors of cooking meat. The sense of smell is the only one that is considered a \"physical touching\" with the \"nonphysical\". Similarly as part of havdallah we smell the basamim because of the loss of the neshamah yeseirah.</p>\n\n<p>Hashem is stating that from Noach's actions he sees that he is attempting to raise himself above the purely animal and that <strong>even though</strong> the Yeitzar Hara is active, people are still capable of reaching the heights. Thus, each person will be judged by what he has managed to accomplish and the entire world will be able to continue.</p>\n\n<p>It was only because everyone had lowered themselves to the animal (and below) that the world no longer had a purpose. Now that Hashem sees that even though people had fallen they retained their ability to create a \"pleasant odor\" (a spiritual rise), thus the world has a purpose and can exist.</p>\n\n<p>Note the connection between the words Reiach (smell) and Ruach (spirit). Also note Moshiach is called \"mari'ach veda'in - he is able to judge a person by merely \"smelling\" him.\" (Sanhedrin 93b) </p>\n\n<p>Rav Shimshon Rafael Hirsch translates רֵיחַ הַנִּיחֹחַ as \"expression of compliance\" rather than as a literal smell. He has a large section explaining this and why the idiom of smell is used, but it is too long to copy into this post. Look up Rav Hirsch on Noach 8:21</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lchaimweekly.org/cgi-bin/calendar?holiday=pesach104206\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a> we see</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Judaism teaches, \"Which sense does the soul enjoy but not the body?\n  This is the sense of smell.\" In other words, smell is spiritual.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, we attempt to revive a person who has fainted with smelling\n  salts, because scent reaches the essence of the soul, which is never\n  unconscious. The soul, which is revitalized by the scent, then infuses\n  new life into the body. At the Havdala ceremony performed after\n  Shabbat has ended, we make a blessing on aromatic spices, and then\n  smell them, to refresh our souls which are saddened by the loss of the\n  special Shabbat dimension.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For example in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/464473/jewish/The-Kabbalah-of-Smell.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Kabbalah of Smell</a> we have an excerpt</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In my grandfather’s synagogue there was a bottle of pungent-smelling\n  salt. A senior member of the congregation explained to me that the\n  bottle was set aside for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish\n  calendar, a day when all fast. “In the event that someone faints,” he\n  said, “we pull out the bottle and place it beneath the individual’s\n  nose. It does the trick. It brings the person back to consciousness.”\n  While I never personally witnessed such an incident, it got me\n  thinking. Why not just stuff a piece of cheesecake in the person’s\n  mouth? Would that not do the trick?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly there is a comment</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Sense of Smell is directly wired to the area of the brain where we\n  retain our memories. Remove this sense and a human being's identity\n  loses its internal compass (and to a degree, its spiritual compass\n  based on what you have shared). Anosmia is the name for the loss of\n  the sense of smell; and it is a loss in the highest sense. Anosmia is\n  one of the early signs of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Taste\n  +Smell = Flavor so one cannot enjoy food as much when one loses their ability to smell. These are facts, not opinions. Kindly consider them\n  the next time you write about the sense of smell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Consider <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/j/fs/48917132.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> person's account of what happened when she lost her sense of smell. It is indeed more significant than we can know.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Noach knew he was supposed to bring sacrifices based on the amount of 'extra' clean animals he was commanded to save as mentioned in Rashi 8 20. As far as the smell goes, this is a standard description of a pleasure that is connected to neshama, not to physicality, see for instance Brachos 43b.</p>\n\n\n",

His main focus is the weekly parsha along with any upcoming holidays. He also likes to talk about the Jewish calendar, the land of Israel, and the Hebrew language. He plays Jewish songs to break up the show. I have enjoyed this show a great deal and learned a lot from it, partly because I happen to be very interested in a lot of the same things that Chernofsky is into. He does a great job of making his show accessible to people with a wide range of backgrounds. There's an RSS feed available <a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Radio/Author.aspx/1230\" rel=\"noreferrer\">via Arutz Sheva</a>. The associated print publication, Torah Tidbits, is also great. I don't think there's an RSS feed for it, but you can sign up to receive an email when he puts up a new issue, which is available in PDF and plain text.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.kimitzion.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ki Mitzion Teitze Torah (KMTT)</a></strong> is a [supposedly] daily Torah Podcast, from <a href=\"http://www.haretzion.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yeshivat Har Etzion</a>. (I say \"supposedly\" because it <a href=\"http://www.kimitzion.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">looks like</a> they've lately been putting up two or three classes each week.) The podcast consists of up to five weekly classes on different topics, which are switched up each semester. I have particuarly enjoyed classes on philosophical topics by R' Ezra Bick, in which he delivers deep insights from medieval thinkers with a conversational delivery that I find engaging.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.ou.org/torah/ou-torah-podcasts/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OU Torah Podcasts</a></strong> from the <a href=\"http://www.ou.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Orthodox Union</a> offers a whole bunch of podcasts, updated on various frequencies from daily to sporadic. I haven't listened to most of them, but I listen to Nach Yomi, which teaches one chapter of the post-Pentateuch books of the Bible per day, completing the whole set every ~2.5 years. They switch lecturers at the beginning of each book. The classes tend to stick pretty close to the text of the chapter at hand, explaining what's going on according to the various commentaries. I'm using this series (plus actually reading the chapter on paper before listening) as a way of becoming familiar with the parts (read: large swaths) of the Bible that I've had little experience with. These lectures were recorded two cycles ago and a re-run each cycle, and I believe similar is true of other of the daily podcasts (e.g. Daf Yomi), so the content's not necessarily new, but it is realeased daily anew via RSS.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I wish you great success in making good use of your downtimes!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Really, it should be <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/501/danny-schoemann\">Danny Schoemann</a> giving this answer, but i'll do him a favor and recommend his <a href=\"http://halocho.blogspot.co.il/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halocho a Day</a> blog.

(There's the story in the Soloveichik dynasty of the young man who is to be drafted into the Czar's army. His father said they wouldn't study the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> codifying the laws of shabbat, as that text simply says \"X and Y are prohibited\" without telling you that X is Biblical and Y is rabbinic. Instead, they studied Rambam's code. As there would be times when the army would force compromises to be made, and then better to violate something rabbinic than something biblical.)</p>\n\n<p>We have plenty of discussions about \"if I have to break shabbat to save a life, what's the best way to do X\" (whether for doctors or soldiers). A few rules of thumb:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Better something rabbinically prohibited than something biblically prohibited. For instance if you bring your child to the ER and they'll only administer a vital medication if you sign an agreement form, sign with your non-dominant hand (e.g. left hand for righties), as non-dominant writing is only a rabbinic prohibition. Operating an electronic device (with the significant exceptions of the incandescent lightbulb and combustion engine) is often a rabbinic prohibition.\n<ul>\n<li>Some rabbinic prohibitions -- e.g. <em>shvus</em> -- are stronger than others (e.g. <em>gezeira.</em>)</li>\n<li>Some acts violate multiple prohibitions, while others violate only one. If I recall correctly Rabbi Moshe Feinstein discusses someone who would have to eat a lot on Yom Kippur (one violation per serving of food) vs. get an IV (one violation when they insert the IV, and none subsequently). Fishing on shabbat, for instance, violates both \"trapping\" and \"slaughtering.\"</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

So the fox eats a rabbit or a squirrel or what have you, and now there is not a pair of rabbits left to reproduce.  Even a relatively short gestation period in the animal kingdom is several weeks.</p>\n\n<p>I know that Noach fed the animals on the ark in such a way that the predators weren't eating other animals.  Do we have to assume that Noach continued to feed them until all of the animals had reproduced sufficiently to let the food chain start again?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rabbi Sorotzkin in Oznayim Latorah (Insights to the Torah) says that Noach continued to feed all the animals for the year after they left the teivah. In Noach 8:17, Hashem gives a bracha which includes the term שרצו which implies increasing like the \"creeping things\" (such as insects). Thus, Rabbi Sorotzkin says that immediately upon leaving the ark they began repopulating the world miraculously and being fed miraculously until there were enough to live as a balanced ecology.</p>\n\n<p>Note that many animals have a minimum viable population size. Consider what happened to the passenger pigeons when the flocks were thinned below the critical level.</p>\n\n<p>Also note that the flood lasted a full solar year and the normal lifespan of some species is less than that.

It also alludes to a special warning, stemming from the unique\n  situationin which all the animals found themselves upon leaving the\n  Ark. During the twelve months of their sojourn in the Ark, the\n  carnivorous birds and animals had refrained from violence; the lions\n  had eaten hay like cattle. This was achieved either by Noach placing\n  the carnivores and herbivores in separate rooms, \"by their families\",\n  or because even the animals and birds heeded Hashem's commands in\n  those terrible days (as they did in not cohabiting in the Ark), and\n  left their fellow animals in peace.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now however, that they were leaving the Ark for freedom, if they were\n  to return immediately to their normal way of life, they would surely\n  wipe out some of the unclean species of which only two remained, one\n  male and one female, and the world would lose those species. They were\n  therefore commanded upon leavin to live for some time (at least twelve\n  months, the gestation period of the largest unclean beasts) \"by their\n  families\" - carnivores and herbivores separately - until all had a\n  chance to produce offspring. This obviated the fear that the world\n  would be left without some species created by Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why does Hashem allow Noah et al to eat *all* animals?",
    "content": "# Why does Hashem allow Noah et al to eat *all* animals?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Reading the parsha today, I noticed for the first time that Bereishit 9:3-4 seems remarkable (JPS translations):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.כָּל-רֶמֶשׂ אֲשֶׁר הוּא-חַי, לָכֶם יִהְיֶה לְאָכְלָה:  כְּיֶרֶק\n  עֵשֶׂב, נָתַתִּי לָכֶם אֶת-כֹּל</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Every creature that lives shall be yours to eat</strong>; as with the green grasses, I give you all these.</p>\n  \n  <p>.אַךְ-בָּשָׂר, בְּנַפְשׁוֹ דָמוֹ לֹא תֹאכֵלוּ</p>\n  \n  <p>You must not, however,\n  eat <strong>flesh with its life-blood in it.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Every</em> living thing shall be for food for you, unless you eat its blood? I know the prohibition against eating the blood remains in the laws of Kashrut as we understand them today, but it’s surprising to think about Noah and his family eating animals that Hashem later prohibits His people from eating. Why is only this partial Kashrut included in Hashem’s covenant with Noah, instead of all the laws at once?</p>\n\n<p>One thing that occurred to me: There are far fewer animals around for now, so perhaps Hashem is giving Noah and his family all the animals to eat for pragmatic reasons, until a sustainable number of animals are born. But then again, we see in Bereishit 7:2 that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מִכֹּל הַבְּהֵמָה הַטְּהוֹרָה, תִּקַּח-לְךָ שִׁבְעָה שִׁבְעָה—אִישׁ\n  וְאִשְׁתּוֹ; וּמִן-הַבְּהֵמָה אֲשֶׁר לֹא טְהֹרָה הִוא, שְׁנַיִם—אִישׁ\n  .וְאִשְׁתּוֹ</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Of every clean animal you shall take seven pairs, males and their mates, and of every animal that is not clean, two, a male and its\n  mate;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So why, then, does Hashem command Noah to take more of the clean animals than the unclean animals, if not because clean animals are the ones fit to eat?</p>\n\n<p>Shavuah tov and hodesh tov!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As we see farther on, the \"clean\" animals are the ones designated for the altar. While Noach and the others are allowed to <strong>eat</strong> any animal, the ones being given to Hashem as a sacrifice are restricted more.</p>\n\n<p>See the relevant pesukim and the meforshim on the sacrifice upon exiting the ark.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Shimshon Rafael Hirsch, for example, goes into a long analysis of the word \"tahor\" and points to Zevachim 115a as a source that even Noachides may only bring a korbon from tahor species. He also says that Jews (because they are like \"kohanim\" to the rest of the world) may only eat that which can be brought as a korbon by the rest of the world (though this is only after matan torah).</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Sorotzknin in Oznayim Latorah (On Noach 7:2)states that it can be considered a hint that Hashem will (after the flood) allow the consumption of animals, however he does not elaborate on that. In Noach 9:3 he explains that the purpose of permitting \"all\" animals is to differentiate between people and animals and show that they are qualitatively <strong>different</strong> from human beings. In fact in Bereishis, the terms used for the vegetation that people ate and the vegetation that animals ate are different. Before the expulsion, Adam at \"of the fruit of the garden\". In the curse (Bereishis 3:18-19), Rav Hirsch say \"If you would want to live as in the garden, you would have to eat grass. However, you will eat bread \"by the sweat of your brow\". This means that even after the curse people and animals are different.</p>\n\n<p>Since people before the flood lost this concept, Hashem allowed animals as food in order to emphasize the difference and show how people must behave. Indeed we see that there are people nowadays (such as the members of PETA) who have lost sight of this and would hesitate (or answer wrongly) if asked \"A child and a pet are drowning, which would you save?)\"</p>\n\n<p>In any case, Rabbi Sorotzkin does not refer back to the 7 (pairs of) clean animals in his explanation of the permission to eat \"all\" animals.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Sorotzkin Noach 7:2</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Take unto you seven pairs</em>. \"Unto you\" - for all your future needs. Future offerings were not the only reason that extra kosher animals were gathered. Noach broughtt only four offerings (<em>Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer</em> Ch. 23). THese animals were for food as well; Hashem was hinting to Noach that after the Flood He would permit him to eat meat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Sorotzkin on Noach 9:3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you</em>. Many theories have been advanced to explain Noach's descendants being permitted what was forbidden to Adam. In my humble opinion, this allowance has the educational value of teaching man his great worth, his superiority over the animal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The rest of this commentary is too long to type in, but this is the basic concept.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> in his commentary there explains why Noah and his descendants only got partial laws:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה הספיקו אלו המצות לבני נח לתקון קבוציהם לפי שכבר ידע השם יתע' שלא יאות בהם בכללם שיקבלו מהשלמות יותר מזה ואולם לבני ישראל צוה נימוס [יותר] שלם להגיעם אל השלמות האנושי להיותם נכונים להתנהג בו</p>\n<p>And behold these commandments sufficed for the children of Noah, for upkeeping their settlements, for God already knew that it was not appropriate for them in general to accept greater perfection than this. However, to the children of Israel he commanded a law of [greater] perfection in order to let them reach human perfection, since they were fitting to act with it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Back in Parshat Bereishit he wrote that God forbade things to Israel that He had permitted to Noah because He intended Israel to be holier.)</p>\n\n\n",

Likewise, because of Kvod Malchut, it is forbidden to call a king by his name. These restrictions are not limited to calling them, it is also forbidden to reference them by their name. Instead, we call them in referencing terms with general meaning - mod, dad, the king. When used, all those terms refers to specific identity - the speaker's father or mother, the king who's identity is understood by the context. But while the reference in any specific use (speech act) refers to a specific identity, the meaning of the term is general.<br>\n Sometimes a term may change a meaning, like the term אל, El, which initially meant any god and so saying it was fine. Nowadays, the referencing of other gods is done almost exclusively by the term אליל and so it became forbidden to say אל when referring to God.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding rachmana, I'm not sure. The word does literally mean something different in Aramic and I guess it was used in the past in the literal sense but it isn't anymore. I don't see it used to refer to God either, except within prayers.</p>\n\n\n",

On\n  one occasion when a bochur was expelled from a yeshiva, he  reacted\n  with the following: 16 </p>\n  \n  <p>I don't understand, he said. Have you ever heard a hospital  to\n  expel a patient because he is too ill?! If he is ill, he belongs  in\n  the hospital! </p>\n  \n  <p>A yeshiva expels a boy because he is not as he should be.  Well if\n  he is not as he should be, where should he be if not  in the yeshiva? </p>\n  \n  <p>But the answer is that the individual does not interest them.  All\n  that matters is that their enterprise (i.e., organization,  yeshiva,\n  cheder, school and the like) continue to function. </p>\n  \n  <p>16 I heard this from Rav Aryeh Weinberg, shlit\"a of Jerusalem to whom\n  the  Chazon Ish said this. It has since been published in the 4th\n  volume of the  sefer Maaseh Ish by Zvi Yabrov, Bnei Brak 5761, p. 46</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p></p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>Sadly, there are children who are expelled from the more right wing\n  yeshivas, and their parents find themselves with no alternative for\n  their education. IMO, in these cases the last statement of the Chazon\n  Ish, \"But the answer is that the individual does not interest them.\n  All that matters is that their enterprise (i.e., organization,\n  yeshiva, cheder, school and the like) continue to function.\" is far\n  too often on the mark. </p>\n  \n  <p>Professor Yitzchok Levine<br>\n  Department of Mathematical Sciences \n  Stevens Institute of Technology  Hoboken, NJ 07030 \n  llevine@stevens.edu  [personal.stevens.edu]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ou.org/life/israel/teaching-students-subjects/\">Teaching Students, Not Subjects</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to “Chadrei Chareidim” (www.bhol.co.il), the Rav pleaded with the educators to keep in mind two thoughts as the new school year begins.  One, to continually relate to each and every student as a neshama, a pure and precious soul.  Two, to stop expelling students from yeshivas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dailyhalacha.com/WeeklyParasha.asp\">Parashat Noah- Noah’s Ark and the Yeshiva</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hence, unlike in generations past, Yeshivah education is not an\n  option, but a vital necessity. We cannot imagine Noah trying to\n  survive the flood outside the Teba. By the same token, it is\n  impossible to expect impressionable young souls to survive the “flood”\n  of immorality and decadence that has overtaken the world in our time\n  if they remain outside the insular, protective framework of the\n  Yeshiva.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is a vital message for not only parents, but also educators. The\n  Hazon Ish (Rav Avraham Yeshaya Karelitz, 1878-1953) cautioned that in\n  our times, the decision to expel a student from Yeshiva requires a\n  23-member Bet Din. According to Halacha, life-and-death cases cannot\n  be brought before a standard, three-member court; they require the\n  adjudication of 23 expert judges. In our day and age, the Hazon Ish\n  said, expelling a student is a matter of spiritual life and death.\n  This is not a decision that may be made on a whim. </p>\n  \n  <p>Unfortunately, many schools today are so caught up with preserving\n  their reputations that they forget this vital message. Administrators\n  must understand that in our society, where an expelled student could\n  end up in a street or in public school, expulsion can very well become\n  a spiritual death sentence.

When someone doesn't say <em>atta chonantanu</em> altogether, they would not need to repeat in order to say it.  However, if one says <em>atta chonantanu</em> in the second shemoneh esrei, they are showing that their second shemoneh esrei was their maariv, in which case they davened their make-up mincha before the current maariv, and their mincha is invalid .  Therefore, you should not say <em>atta chonantanu</em> in the second shemoneh esrei (O.C. 108:10 and M.B. 29). </p>\n\n<p>S.A. 108:10</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בדיל בראשונה ואינו מבדיל בשניה ואם לא הבדיל בראשונה והבדיל בשניה שניה עלתה לו ראשונה לא עלתה לו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[However, if you explicitly had in mind that the first was for Maariv and the second was the mincha make-up, and did not switch the order, you do not need to repeat shemoneh esrei and both count (M.B ibid).]</p>\n\n\n",

It reads, in part:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא שמעתי הוראה בסדר סליחות ליום זה (וכן — אם לאמרם באשמורת הבוקר, או בתפלה בסדר התחנון)‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In my own translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I haven't heard any direction about the order of <em>s'lichos</em> for today (<em>Tzom G'dalya</em>) (nor, indeed, whether to say them in the wee hours of the morning or during <em>tachanun</em> during the prayer service).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How does it happen that in two-hundred-odd years of Lubavitch custom there is no established custom regarding whether to say <em>s'lichos</em> in the early morning or during <em>shacharis</em>? Did the rebbe not see what his father-in-law (the previous rebbe) did? Is there no record of what the previous rebbes did? of what the community of <em>chasidim</em> did? How can this be?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As explained in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30510&st=&pgnum=181&hilite=\">אוצר מנהגי חב\"ד</a>, the practice in the main Shul in Lubavitch where the Rabbeim davened was not indicative of the official Chabad practice, but rather represented what the crowd chose to do. So whatever the practice was was not indicative of the actual position of the Rabbeim (i.e. what they would do in private). Often the Rabbeim would daven on weekdays in private, only coming out for Krias HaTorah or other special occasions, so there would be no clear public practice directly from them.</p>\n\n<p>In 5711 (1951) when the question came up after the passing of the Previous Rebbe, the Lubavitcher Rebbe said that he didn't hear a clear directive of when to say the Slichos (before Shacharis like during Elul, or after Shacharis like on a fast day), so he left both possibilities open in his directive about how to say the Slichos. However, he himself said the Slichos as part of Shacharis, and thus that became the established Chabad practice.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, as explained in the Otzer, the official Chabad practice as established by the Alter Rebbe is to never say Slichos or Avinu Malkeinu on the other fast days, but the most recent Lubavitcher Rebbe did so, so that has become the Chabad practice.</p>\n\n<p>The siddurim retain the ambiguity of the original statement from 5711.</p>\n\n\n",

Those that do so, God promises here, will get withered from the inside.</p>\n\n<p>R' Hirsch doesn't make it clear, here, why God delivers this existential blow to nations that hurt the Jewish nation.

This week's parsha, perhaps, represents the 1st such \"usage\" in Breishit 12:2, \"An I shall make you into a great nation\" (Heb. - \"Goy Gadol\").</p>\n\n<p>\"Nachri\" means \"stranger\" - usually, referring to non-residents of the current land. In most cases in Tana\"ch, the term is used to refer to non-Jews, but, I think that there are a few places where Jews are called \"nachri\" when they have been in foreign lands. Offhand, I can't think of an example, but I think there are one or two in Sefer Breishit.</p>\n\n<p>\"Akum\" is an abbreviation that developed in the time of the Mishnah, I believe, and clearly refers to non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p>When I was learning Masechet Avodah Zarah with my rav, he was careful to differentiate between \"akum\" and \"Nachri\" in terms of referring to non-Jewish Americans. He said that every \"akum\" is a \"nachri\", but not every \"nachri\" is an \"akum\". The discussion arose as to whether Christianity is Avodah Zarah, and there are different opinions. According to those abiding by the ruling that it is, a devout Christian would be \"Akum\". But, as not every non-Jew practices any religion (there are many American atheists, e.g.), these would be considered \"nochrim\" but not \"akum\".</p>\n\n<p>\"Goy\", for some reason, received a derogatory connotation, but I don't quite understand why, when, or how.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>the R\"ITVA on Makkos 9a clarifies the 3 major gedarim/categories of non-Jews.

Whoever <strong>loves silver</strong> will not be sated with silver, and he who loves a multitude without increase-this too is vanity.</a> - ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I can't help with a source of the story, but the distinction in usage seems to be clear.  A fish is an animate being, with things that are detrimental to its own interests and things that the fish itself does not like.  Therefore, love in that context would mean to look want what is best for it.  Killing and eating the fish is not in the fish's best interest.  The silver, on the other hand, does not have feelings and does not have its own interests.  Love of silver therefore contextually does not have anything to do with the best interests of the silver, and instead would mean that you enjoy the silver, which manifests in wanting to have it.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, they could both be working with the definition of love that R' Hirsch gives in ch. 9 of Horeb, namely that to love something means you see your completion through it.  So someone who loves silver sees his completion through silver.  He will never have enough silver, because silver cannot bring him true fulfillment.  Someone who loves fish sees his completion through the fish, and therefore wants to keep the fish around.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, the Rebbe of Kotzk did not mean to re-define what \"love\" is, but to drive home a message to the Chassid in a memorable way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The line with the fish in the story is also printed in Lev Eliyahu from R' Elya Lopian tz\"l in parshas Vayeitzei where he discusses the love Yaakov had for Rochel - a 'beautiful' peice if you can get you hands on it.</p>\n\n<p>( Obviously, Reb Elya was using the line to describe true love, making @Shmuel's question valid)</p>\n\n<p>I think the lesson from the kotzker / Reb Elya applies to what Shlomo Hamelech was saying in Koheles since loving silver means caring  for it as one would care for another human being that they love (ex. the concept that men who love their cars, wash it and care for it). Of course the underlying idea here is like @YEZ mentioned that they really care about themselves and loving silver (they believe) will make them feel good.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, he cites for example from <a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=2898\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Bava Kama</em> 55</a>, seeing the letter <em>tes</em> in a dream is good omen, because the first time <em>tes</em> appears in the Torah is in the word \"<em>tov</em>\" (\"good\").</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There might be a big difference between \"ideas\" and \"lessons\", but perhaps you are referring to the assumption that the <em>g'mara</em> gives preference to earlier <em>p'sukim</em> over later ones when choosing prooftexts. </p>\n\n<p>For example, <em>Tosafos</em> assumes that a <em>pasuk</em> from <em>Vayikra</em> should have been preferred over one from <em>Yirmiyahu</em> by default in the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=2b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">discussion of monetary transaction sources on <em>Kidushin 2</em></a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>והא דלא מייתי קנין שנכתב בתורה</strong>\n   מכסף מקנתו (ויקרא כה) משום דבעי לאתויי קנין לשדה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another possible example of this (once again, exemplified by its absence/exclusion) is that Rava should have preferred to teach how to interpret the Torah's legal round numbers (as in \"40\" == 39) from a <em>pasuk</em> in <em>Vayikra</em> rather than the one in <em>D'varim</em> that he chose.

However, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0106.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breishit 6:21</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to\n  thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Considering that many animals are carnivores, does that mean that Noach took extra animals as food for the other animals? If so, should we assume that all that food was eaten or was there a possible food shortage or leftover live animals? Was Noach an expert in animal food consumption, assuming that each animal ate the same quantity (for that animal), daily?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>As pointed out by many meforshim, the food in the teivah was provided miraculously.

    "content": "# Why the different wording for the three proofs atop שבת דף מ ע״א?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=202\" rel=\"nofollow\">The <em>Bavli</em>, <em>Shabas</em> 40 <em>amud</em> 1</a>, cites a disagreement between <em>Rav</em> and <em>Sh'muel</em>. It then brings three proofs to <em>Sh'muel</em>'s view. Each proof quotes what appears AFAICT to be a <em>b'raysa</em>, and each proof is introduced differently from the way the others are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חמין שהוחמו מע״ש רב אמר למחר רוחץ בהן כל גופו אבר אבר ושמואל אמר לא התירו לרחוץ אלא פניו ידיו ורגליו <strong>מיתיבי</strong> חמין שהוחמו מע״ש למחר רוחץ בהן פניו ידיו ורגליו אבל לא כל גופו תיובתא דרב אמר לך רב לא כל גופו בבת אחת אלא אבר אבר והא פניו ידיו ורגליו קתני כעין פניו ידיו ורגליו <strong>תא שמע</strong> לא התירו לרחוץ בחמין שהוחמו מע״ש אלא פניו ידיו ורגליו ה״נ כעין פניו ידיו ורגליו <strong>תניא כוותיה דשמואל</strong> חמין שהוחמו מע״ש למחר רוחץ בהן פניו ידיו ורגליו אבל לא כל גופו אבר אבר ואצ״ל חמין שהוחמו בי״ט</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you see, the first proof is introduced with \"מיתיבי\", the second with \"תא שמע\", and the third with \"תניא כוותיה דשמואל\". Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The first <em>beraita</em> is presented as a <strong>direct attack against Rav</strong>. The second is a <strong>support for Shmuel</strong>. Neither of these is ultimately dispositive. The third <em>beraita</em> is <strong>certainly in accordance with the position of Shmuel and not that of Rav</strong>. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Details</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here's my (admittedly not particularly well-sourced) take on the <em>sugya</em>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The first proof is a direct attack on Rav's position. Rav said you can wash your whole body (limb by limb) in hot water. To which the gemara records a (seeming) refutation:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מיתיבי</strong> חמין שהוחמו מע״ש למחר רוחץ בהן פניו ידיו ורגליו <strong>אבל לא כל גופו</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.daf-yomi.com/AramicDictionary.aspx?wordID=13724&source=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">They asked</a></strong> [against Rav]: \"Water that was heated on Friday, the next day one may use it to wash his face hand and feet, <strong>but not his entire body</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The second proof does not directly attack Rav. Rather, it seems to assert Shmuel's postion (which would then implicitly refute the position of Rav). Shmuel said that hot water may only be used to wash face, hands and feet. The gemara backs this up with:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>תא שמע</strong> לא התירו לרחוץ בחמין שהוחמו מע״ש <strong>אלא פניו ידיו ורגליו</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.daf-yomi.com/AramicDictionary.aspx?wordID=19660&source=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Come and listen</a></strong> [to a proof for Shmuel]: \"They only permitted using water heated on Friday <strong>to wash one's face, hands and feet.</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Note that for the first two proofs for Shmuel's postion, the gemara points out that they are not dispositive. Now the gemara brings a third proof which it knows is watertight, i.e. a <em>beraita</em> which is definitely in accordance with Shmuel and not Rav:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>תניא כוותיה דשמואל</strong> חמין שהוחמו מע״ש למחר רוחץ בהן פניו ידיו ורגליו\n  אבל לא כל גופו <strong>אבר אבר</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.daf-yomi.com/AramicDictionary.aspx?wordID=19902&source=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">It was taught like Shmuel</a></strong>: \"Water that was heated on Friday, the next day one may use it to wash his face, hands and feet, but not his whole body, <strong>even limb by limb</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Immigration to the Arabian Peninsula began in earnest in the 2nd century CE, and by the 6th and 7th centuries there was a considerable Jewish population in Hejaz, mostly in and around Medina...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would be placed around the times of the Savoraim or early Geonim.</p>\n\n<p>Is there mention in the writings of the Savoraim, Geonim, or early Rishonim of any encounters between Jewish leaders/scholars of the time and Mohammed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>No, there are no extant texts from Jewish scholars on meeting Mohammed. There has been much academic scholarship on the Jewish presence of Saudia Arabia during the formation of Islam. A good place to begin is <em>The Jews of Arab Lands</em> by the brilliant scholar Norman Stillman. But the history is complicated and this is a serious question, so the long answer that follows is a summary of Mohammed's encounters with Jewish communities and, at the end, the available textual evidence on rabbis meeting Mohammed (feel free to stop reading).</p>\n<p>As Stillman points out, the only documentation available on Mohammed's encounters with non-Muslims were written by Muslims, and years after Mohammad's death. We do know that the Jews who came into closest contact with Mohammed \"were merchants, either in Mecca itself, or at one of the annual fairs\" (Stillman, 5). Some historians speculate that some of his mentors in Mecca were sectarian Jews, but this is uncertain. If these merchants were at all missionary, as was common at that time, they were amateurs with little Jewish education.</p>\n<p>It was only when Mohammed went to Medina that he actively confronted Jewish communities, which were organized into tribes. As opposed to other communities, they did not invite Mohammed to Medina, be present at the Aqaba negotiations, or accept him as a prophet; they also, apparently, publicly upbraided him for mangling the narratives of biblical stories. There are no documents from the Jewish tribe of craftsmen, the Banu Qaynuqa, who surrendered to Mohammed's army and were then banished to Syria. Nor, obviously, are there documents from the Banu Qurayza, the Jewish tribe in Medina that stayed neutral during the Muslim siege and were totally executed (with women and children enslaved). After this, the few remaining Jews in Medina were forced to leave and we have no record of them. There were other Jewish communities, like the Jews of Khaybar, that Mohammad's army fought with, but they were not of scholarly stock and did not leave a historical record (although the Jews of Khaybar were later mythologized in Arabic folklore).</p>\n<p>Considering the often hostile (to put it lightly) depictions of the Jewish communities, the impressions of Mohammed from Jewish scholars are merely conjectural. Documents that specify individual Jews during Mohammed's life typically detail their conversion to Islam. To give an example, from Stillman's anthology of sources, here is an account of Mohammed's first Jewish convert from the one of the earliest biographies on Mohammed (compiled orally around 100 years after Mohammed's death):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ibn Ishaq stated: The following is part of the story of Abd Allah b. Salam concerning him and his conversion as told to me by one of his relatives. He was a rabbi and a scholar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Abd's testimony is then recounted on how he heard about Mohammed and then converted after meeting him. He then decries the Jews and asks Mohammed for safety before they hear of his conversion. He reportedly said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So the Apostle of Allah...took me into one of his apartments, and they\n[the Jewish community] came before him. They spoke with him and asked\nhim questions. He in turn asked them, \"What kind of a man is al-Husayn\nb. Salam [Abd's name prior to conversion] among you?\"</p>\n<p>\"He is our chief and the son of our chief, our rabbi and our leading scholar,\" they replied.</p>\n<p>As they finished speaking, I came out in front of them and said, \"O Jews, fear Allah and accept what he has sent you! For by Allah, you surely know that he is the Apostle of Allah. You will find him foretold in the Torah both by his name and his description. I bear witness that he is the Apostle of Allah. I believe in him. I declare him to be true. And I acknowledge him.\"</p>\n<p>\"You lie!\" they cried, and went on to slander me.</p>\n<p>---from Ibn Hisham, <em>al-Sira al-Nabawiyya</em>, (Cairo, 1955) vol. 1, pp. 516-17</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is very difficult to gauge the veracity of this encounter with Mohammad considering the vantage point of the speaker and the lacuna of time between its occurrence and when it was finally written down. But this is as close as you will get. The early Muslim encounters with Jewish leadership after Mohammed's death, such as those with the <em>resh galuta</em> Bustanay, deserves its own question.</p>\n\n\n",

That’s poshut pshat. The Targum Yonasan ben Uziel (Devarim\n24:6) says לֹא יַחֲבֹל  refers to not tying up a chosson or kallah\nbecause רֵחַיִם means the woman and the רָכֶב is a משל to the man.\nThere’s a certain kishuf you can do to prevent the chosson and kallah\nfrom being נזקק with one another, so the Torah says a special איסור\nbeyond kishuf to not tie up the chosson and kallah. However, there are\ntwo things the chosson and kallah can do to ensure the kishuf doesn’t\nwork. The first thing they can do is not have any knots. The second\nעצה is for the chosson to put gold in his pocket. For this reason, the\nminhag was to give the chosson a golden watch, often a pocket watch,\nso he could put the gold in his pocket to prevent this kishuf from\ntaking effect. I’ve never heard of anyone who knows how to do this\nkishuf today, so we don’t really have anything to worry about. They\ndon’t have to untie all the knots, and if they do then they’ll have\nsome problems with the button sewed onto the jacket which likely have\nknots on the end of the thread. If it makes you happy to untie all the\nknots, then you can do it, but you don’t have to do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Is this possible and if so how?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You might be thinking of a self cleaning oven. The self cleaning cycle is sufficient to kasher it. Non self cleaning ovens may be kashered by running at the highest setting for a set period of time.</p>\n\n<p>For example</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/623729/jewish/How-do-I-kosher-an-oven.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">How do I kosher an oven?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If your oven is of the self-cleaning variety, koshering it is fairly simple. All you need to do is self-clean it. If you need to kosher the oven racks too, just leave them in the oven while it self-cleans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-passover-kashering.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">THE STAR-K PESACH KITCHEN</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The Oven</strong><br>\n  In a conventional oven, whether gas or electric, an oven\n  cleaner may be necessary to remove baked-on grease. Be sure to check\n  hidden areas, including corners, door edges, the area behind the flame\n  burners, and the grooves of the rack shelves. If a caustic type of\n  oven cleaner (such as Easy-Off) was used to clean the oven, and some\n  stubborn spots remained after a second application with similar\n  results, the remaining spots may be disregarded. Once the oven and\n  racks have been cleaned, they may be kashered by libbun kal. The\n  requirement of libbun kal is satisfied by turning the oven to broil or\n  the highest setting for forty minutes. In a gas oven, the broil\n  setting will allow the flame to burn continuously. In a conventional\n  electric oven, the highest setting (550°F) kashers the oven. Only\n  libbun kal is required for the oven racks since it is usual to cook\n  food in a pan and not directly on the racks themselves.</p>\n  \n  <p>In a continuous cleaning oven, one cannot assume that such an oven is\n  clean because the manufacturer claims it to be continuously clean. A\n  visual inspection is required. Since caustic or abrasive oven\n  cleaners, e.g. Easy Off, cannot be used without destroying the\n  continuous clean properties of the oven, a non-abrasive and\n  non-caustic cleaner must be used to clean the oven. Grease spots will\n  usually disappear if the top layer of grease is cleaned with Fantastik\n  and a nylon brush. Then the oven should be turned on to 450°F for an\n  hour, so that the continuous clean mechanism can work. If the spots do\n  not disappear, the oven should be left on for a few hours to allow the\n  continuous clean mechanism to deep clean, or else the spots should be\n  removed with oven cleaner or steel wool. If the spots are dark and\n  crumble when scratched they can be disregarded. In all of the above\n  cases, the oven should then be kashered by turning it to the 550°F\n  setting for forty minutes.</p>\n  \n  <p>In a self-cleaning oven; before using the self clean cycle, one should\n  clean the inside face of the oven door, as well as the opposing outer\n  rim of the oven outside the gasket, since these areas are not\n  necessarily cleaned during the cycle. Easy Off manufactures one\n  product that is safe for self-cleaning ovens. One should ensure the\n  gasket itself is clean on the area outside the oven seal. (Note: The\n  gasket is sensitive to abrasion). The self-cleaning cycle will then\n  clean and kasher the oven simultaneously. Caution: There is a\n  potential risk of fire during the self-cleaning process, especially if\n  there is a great collection on the bottom of the oven. It is\n  recommended to apply Easy Off that is made especially for self-clean\n  ovens to lift and remove the grease. The oven should not be left\n  unattended while in the self-cleaning mode. Due to reports of fires,\n  one should not leave other operating heating appliances i.e. dryers,\n  toasters, coffee makers, toaster ovens, microwave ovens, or\n  dishwashers unattended. In fact, toasters and toaster ovens should be\n  unplugged (by pulling on the plug and not the cord) when not in use.</p>\n  \n  <p>Most oven manufacturers instruct the consumer to remove the oven racks\n  before self cleaning, so they will not discolor. However, one may self\n  clean the oven with the racks inside, even though they might discolor.\n  After the self clean cycle use a little oil on the side of the racks\n  to easily slide them in and out of the oven. Also, there are some\n  manufacturers that require removal of the racks before the self clean\n  cycle can start. In this case, one should take the racks out, clean\n  them very well, and then put them in the oven at the highest\n  temperature (usually 550°F) for 45 minutes. This procedure kashers\n  them.</p>\n  \n  <p>Some ovens come with a convection feature. This feature allows for\n  more uniform heat distribution by using a fan to circulate the heat.\n  If the convection oven has the self-cleaning feature, it will be\n  sufficient to kasher the fan as well. If there is no self-cleaning\n  feature, the entire oven including the fan, while it is circulating\n  must be sprayed with a caustic cleaner and cleaned well. The oven\n  should then be kashered by turning it on to the 550°F setting for\n  forty minutes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://oukosher.org/passover/articles/modern-kitchen/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OU statement</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>SELF-CLEAN OVENS<br>\n  LIBUN   >\n  Remove any visible food.

Obviously, it hadn't yet happened.</p>\n\n<p>As to why such cases occur, in general, this fits into the notion that the events in the Torah were not written in sequential order, necessarily, and were edited, later.</p>\n\n<p>I have to explore the message behind this specific verse that you mentioned, as to what important info the Torah is telling us. </p>\n\n<p>Offhand, I think the Torah is emphasizing Lot's character, He was surrounded by righteous men, esp. his uncle Avraham, who took care of him and showed him the acts of kindness. At the point that there was an argument between the herdsmen, and Avraham gives Lot the option to chose where to live, Lot specifically plants his tent in Sodom - an area that was corrupt, and Lot knew that it was corrupt. Yet, it didn't bother him to live there, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>That's what I heard in drashot from my rav and a few Divrei Torah in the past. Have to further research why the Torah foreshadows, here.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Follow up - See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=179\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Rash\"i and Sifsei Chachami, mark 'ayin</a> on the verse you mentioned. The Torah mentions the destruction of Sedom as a decription of the previous phrase that the land was \"completely watered\". I.e. - Sedom was fertile / watered only prior to the destruction, but it wasn't that way afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>I have trouble understanding that this is a decription of the previous phrase, since there is an etnachta prior to it, thus, making it seem like the description is disconnected from its subject. Maybe an etnachta doesn't form this type of disconnect?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Another one that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.2.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.2.14.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi actually points out</a> is in Bereishis 2:14 d.h.

The most famous instance is the Rashi at the start of parshas Vayera (18:13) quoting the gemara in bava metzia where Hashem changed Sarah's words. </p>\n\n<p>Matt mentioned in his comment that a woman can claim she is married when she is not in order to prevent annoyance, which seems to point in the direction that lying to telemarketers is perfectly acceptable. </p>\n\n<p>There are also many occasions where a woman will make false claims to prevent bad situations, such as saying that she took a neder against wine to avoid becoming drunk among men or dressing like a niddah to avoid harassment on the street. The latter situation is discussed in the gemara in ketuvot vis a vis the husband - is he required to treat her like a niddah if her actions/dress seem to state that she is, but she claims that it was to avoid an uncomfortable circumstance?</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, it's clear that lying is permitted and may even be preferable to confrontation in uncomfortable situations. When discussing tzedaka organizations, there is another wrinkle, since you are lying to avoid the performance of a mitzvah. While I can't think of any sources that deal with that issue explicitly, a person <strong><em>can be forced by beis din (or have possessions taken) to fulfill his communal tzedaka obligations.</em></strong> See Bava Basra 8b, though commentators reinterpret this story. In either case, this clearly implies that one has a personal obligation to engage in charity that certainly couldn't be shirked with lying simply due to inconvenience or annoyance. However, one is not required to give to people simply because they ask for tzedaka (the only exception being Purim), especially if doing so would impose financial hardship. </p>\n\n<p>The gemara at the end of Yevamos discusses a rav who temporarily dodged a tax/fine from the reish galusa by wearing a disguise when he appeared before him to learn. It refrains from passing judgement on whether this was an appropriate act.</p>\n\n<p>I guess a major unknown is how you are defining \"personal benefit\" in your question. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If it is to avoid a potential aveirah, socially difficult situations, to save from danger, or to preserve shalom, then lying is certainly permitted. </li>\n<li>If you are lying for purely financial or personal benefit reasons, then lying is certainly forbidden. </li>\n<li>Lying to avoid tzedaka or other mitzvos, while murkier, would probably be forbidden as well - you should explain why you prefer not to be contacted again.</li>\n<li>Lying in social situations where there is no substantial personal benefit nor general problem (e.g.: saying you're sick when you don't feeling like hanging out) is murkier, but would probably be forbidden under the provision of <a href=\"http://halachafortodaycom.blogspot.com/2013/02/archives-hilchos-midvar-sheker-tirchak.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Midavar Sheker Tirchak.\">Midavar Sheker Tirchak. </a> If you are lying to avoid hurting another person's feelings, then that would fall under #1 and would be permitted.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><em>Lying</em> </p>\n\n<p>By our words, we transmit some life to things which are spoken, because we're images of hakadoch baruch hu.</p>\n\n<p>Lying is forbidden as it is a way of blowing life into something which shouldn't be, a way of providing truth to something which is untrue.</p>\n\n<p>When someone is feeling embarrassed at the idea of lying, this is because her/his yetzer tov is warning her/him.</p>\n\n<p><em>Avoiding annoying calls</em></p>\n\n<p>A good way is to ask Hachem for help (quick mental prayer) to tell truth without hurting the caller.</p>\n\n<p>In Hilkhot Matanot Aniyim, Maimonides list the 8 levels of giving. The list puts \"giving unwillingly\" in latest position, which is the least preferable way of giving.</p>\n\n<p>My answer to such calls is thus following Maimonides sayings, I prefer to give willingly to someone than giving unwillingly as I would give the same amount for a lesser reward. And when I give tzedaka, I force myself not to think about the reward.</p>\n\n\n",

Not only because the \"real\" Jesus will always be shrouded in mystery due to the contradictory portrayals of his life, character, and teachings in the four \"gospels\" and other writings, but also because these writings contain many things that were innovations of Jesus and are contrary to the <em>halakhah</em> (both current <em>halakhah</em> and that of his own day), as well as false prophecies and a myriad of other issues. There is even an account in the Gospel of John where the <em>Sanhedrin</em> rejects him after openly performing <em>melakhah</em> on <em>Shabbat</em> (cf. John 9). It is unlikely that this event ever took place, however the fact that the author of John saw no issue in including it proves that he neither cared about nor sought the approval of the true leaders of Torah Judaism. These, and a great many other factors, preclude Jesus' teachings ever to be accepted into the body of authentic Jewish religious writings.</p>\n\n<p>The Qumran sectarians bequeathed a vast amount of literature written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. The texts discovered there include religious calenders, legal rulings of their sect, mystical texts, liturgies, et al. Perhaps the most oft-quoted texts by those wanting to absorb their literature into the current Jewish \"canon\" are the Biblical manuscripts with variant readings from the Masoretic text. However, for similar reasons to Jesus, they are also disqualified. These groups were unambiguously sectarian; diverging from normative and authentic Judaism in manifold ways. They had strong Gnostic - and even dualist - tendencies, were aligned with the defunct and aberrant halakhic positions of the Sadducees, they followed a leader known as the \"Teacher of Righteousness\" whom they claimed was the sole mediator of salvation, and other things. They and those like them are fully and explicitly rejected by the sages of Israel in the records of the <em>Mishnah</em>, <em>Tosefta</em>, and the <em>Talmudhim</em>. Accordingly, in keeping with the <em>halakhah</em> recorded in <em>Masekheth Shabbat</em> 116a-b, their Torah scrolls are <em>pasul</em> and must be destroyed, even if written according to the <em>halakhah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There are also some equivocations that so-called \"messianic\" groups make when assessing either the Gospels, Qumran texts, or other pseudopigrapha in this manner:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jewish equals \"Kosher\"</strong> - This is the most common and widespread mistake in this regard. People feel that if they can prove that Jesus or the Qumran sectarians were Jews with religious ideas, then their writings/teachings are just as valid as any other Jewish literature. This is simply not correct. Jewish history is filled with a great number of heretics, most of whom held firm religious ideas, believed in God, and were convinced that their own ideas were correct. Nevertheless, they were rejected by the courts and authorized leaders of Israel and they remain heretics in perpetuity.</li>\n<li><strong>Hebrew equals \"Kosher\"</strong> - This mistake is also extremely common. People feel that if something is written in Hebrew (or sometimes Aramaic), then it has a status and sanctity alongside the texts of Hazal or other authentic halakhic texts. For instance, many people try to redeem Jesus from being a heretic by translating the Greek texts of the \"gospels\" into Mishnaic Hebrew, as if the words of a heretic become acceptable if they contain rabbinic idiom. Rabbi Elisha` ben Abuyah (known also as \"Aher\") spoke in rabbinic idiom also, yet remains a heretic! Shabtai Tzvi - <em>yimah shemo</em> - also wrote in Hebrew, as did Theodore Herzl, yet they remain heretics in perpetuity. For this, and the reasons listed above, this idea is also false. </li>\n<li><strong>Living in the Tannaitic era makes one a Tanna</strong> - I have read time and again that not only was Jesus a \"Pharisee\" but he was also a \"Tanna\" since he lived during the general era of the sages of the <em>Mishnah</em>. A \"Tanna\" means \"one who communicates [authentic] halakhic teachings\". Jesus did not do this, and had he done so, then his words would likely have been in the <em>Mishnah</em> or the <em>Tosefta</em> or one of the <em>Baraytoth</em> in the <em>talmudhim</em>. Neither Jesus nor the Qumran sectarians were \"tannaim\" simply because they were alive and expressed their respective religious ideas during that era.</li>\n<li><strong><em>\"Lo ba-shamayim hi\"</em> & <em>\"aharei rabbim le-hattoth\"</em></strong> - These statements, found in <em>Shemoth</em> 23:2 and <em>Devarim</em> 30:12, mean \"it [the Torah] is not in heaven\" and \"[one must] incline after the majority\", respectively, and are foundational principles of halakhic authority. They absolutely preclude either Jesus, the \"Teacher of Righteousness,\" or their respective sects, to innovate spiritual ideas or halakhic rulings outside the authority of the authorized Sanhedrin. Essentially, these two rules serve as important safeguards against charlatans and those claiming to have prophecy; those attempting to single-handedly corrupt or alter halakhic Judaism. <em>Lo ba-shamayim hi</em> means that miracles, fortune-telling, pseudo-prophecy, threats of divine retribution, etc. have absolutely NO standing in making halakhic decisions and are completely inadmissible in court (cf. <em>Devarim</em> 12-13). Thus, Jesus' and his followers' claims that his supposed \"miracles\" were somehow a proof of his message only shows their ignorance of true Torah law. Ignorance, or perhaps they were in open defiance of it. <em>Aharei rabbim le-hattoth</em> means that even if Jesus, or any other sectarian leader, were to sincerely hold to orthodox Judaism in every way while maintaining a different opinion of Jewish law such a person would be obligated to follow the majority ruling of the court. In fact, for someone to teach his own views as practical <em>halakhah</em> when they do not accord with the majority ruling(s) of the <em>Sanhedrin</em> carries with it a death penalty by strangulation (<em>Mishneh Torah, Hilkhoth Mamrim</em> 1-3). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong>: </p>\n\n<p>What I have mentioned here is only a very small portion of what explains the eternal rejection of Jewish heretics and their writings. Much more could be written and elaborated upon, but this is not the place. </p>\n\n<p>The point that I am trying to make clear is that the halakhic reasoning in the above answer can ONLY be applied to authentic and verifiable Jewish writings that might be discovered. It CANNOT be applied halakhically to sectarian and/or heretical texts, such as the \"gospels\" or those documents discovered at Qumran.</p>\n\n<p>Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n",

Infectious disease represents a damaging agent (most likely eish) that a person is culpable for. If his carelessness results in damage to others, he is fully culpable for those damages (see Bava Kama - one shita says it doesn't matter how deep into his own property the fire is lit, he is always liable). Since an unsuspecting person is incapable of \"running away\" from the \"fire\" of an infectious disease, they would be like an eved tied to a post and you would be liable for essentially murdering them PROVIDED that you knew you were infected and failed to properly notify. If you take appropriate precautions but STILL manage to spread disease, then you couldn't be held liable for ensuing damages. Regardless, this line of reasoning would suggest that Beis Din can only <em>react</em> to damages caused by a diseased individual, and would not have the power to quarantine.</li>\n<li>Lo Sa'amod Al Dam Rei'echa - Much more straightforward. If you pose a substantial threat to other people, <strong><em>anyone may act to mitigate the threat you pose</em></strong> as long as the action taken directly addresses the threat. This is true <strong><em>even when the person has no intent to harm.</em></strong> That is why late term abortions are explicitly permitted to save the mother - we treat the fetus as a rodef achar chaveiro lehargo. The caveat here is that <em>after</em> the emergence of the head we consider the child a separate person, and we cannot \"choose\" between the two lives. If a person is intentionally trying to harm, you absolutely have permission to kill them, but it is preferable to incapacitate if given the chance. See Sanhedrin 73a. The upshot here would be that <strong>anyone up to and including beis din</strong> can force you into quarantine if you pose a discernible risk to others, and possibly even in the case of a safek risk. If you are knowingly infected and attempt to infect others, they are even authorized to kill you assuming that would nullify the threat you pose.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So if a person knows they are diseased, they would be obligated to quarantine themselves or be held liable for the damages or deaths they cause. Anyone else who is aware of the potential threat may take action to initiate a quarantine in order to protect other people. Beis Din wouldn't even be required in this case since Lo Sa'amod is incumbent upon every individual.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi\n  Taplin explains: “When sheimos gets buried, it needs to be done in a\n  way that is the least damaging to the sefarim and other holy objects\n  we bury. We put the sefarim and papers in polyethylene bags because\n  that preserves them the most. We also line the hole in which the\n  burial takes place.”</p>\n  \n  <p>“People think, ‘Oh what’s the big deal? You just open up a hole, put\n  in the sheimos and you’re done,’” says Rabbi Taplin, “but it is not\n  that simple.” Besides for the halachic aspects, sheimot burial must be\n  done legally, which is made complicated by the Department of\n  Environmental Protection. The DEP is not enthusiastic about the burial\n  of large quantities of paper because they want to recycle it, and\n  therefore they require special permits that are difficult to access.\n  In fact, there have been a number of scandals by other sheimot\n  companies in the past where sheimot was dumped in landfills and other\n  illegal areas. Rabbi Taplin explains that 1866shaimos “has worked for\n  23 years with the DEP to bury sheimos according to law.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Purchasing land to bury sheimot is also expensive, which is why Rabbi\n  Taplin does not want to mention exactly where the sheimot is buried.\n  He worries that it would invite trespassers who would try to bury\n  their sheimot on his plots. The DEP does not allow burial in heavily\n  populated areas, and the land is cheaper away from population, so the\n  plots are not nearby.</p>\n  \n  <p>Just as Jews confirm meat is kosher through a hechsher, people also\n  use hechsheirim to sanction halachic sheimot burial. 1866shaimos has\n  two hechsherim, one from a local rav in Lakewood, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman\n  Friedman, the other from the Satmar beis din. Rabbi Taplin explains:\n  “We live in Lakewood so we used a local rav, who knows us. Regarding\n  Satmar, we are not officially affiliated with Satmar. However, the\n  Satmar community in Williamsburg is one of our biggest customers; they\n  give us four or five trailer loads of sheimos a year. Even though we\n  have our own local hashgacha, they wanted their own beis din to also\n  give a hashgacha; they are exacting and have very high standards.”\n  Rabbi Taplin says that they have also gone in front of other\n  communities’ batei din (rabbinic courts) to prove their kosher sheimot\n  practices, although those communities don’t all officially give out\n  hechsherim as Satmar did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(The response is supposed to be \"immediate\" which we take to mean within a few seconds. See <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.124#8\">OC 124</a>:8 and <em>Mishna Berura</em> #34 <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.124\">there</a>.) I've seen this happen, typically, due to the reader searching for the place to read after the blessing and not answering \"<em>Amen</em>\" until he finds the place and is about to read. Practicing \"Amen\" as part of the reading makes this problem more likely to manifest.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend, instead, a practice method for this \"Amen\" that is more frequent and therefore more effective, takes no time out of your reading practice time or out of your life in general, and promotes more <em>Halacha</em>-compliant behavior both when you read for the congregation and at other times: <strong><em>Every time</em> you are present for a Torah reading, in any capacity (other than the guy making the blessing, naturally) and you hear the blessing, say \"Amen\" right after the blessing nicely, singing it the way you would before reading.</strong> If you're not the Torah reader, I suggest doing this relatively quietly, so as not to distract people who aren't expecting that tune from anyone other than the reader. I used to do this habitually, and it was effective at keeping me in the habit of saying \"<em>Amen</em>\" at the right time, when reading and otherwise.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>אמן יתומה typically means waiting too long to respond to Amen after berachah has been given. I think your case is similar to אמן יתומה since it is an Amen which is not connected to any berachah.  The focus of your Amen during a real aliyah is that you are sharing the beracha with the oleh.  Originally, each oleh read his own aliyah, and so he said a beracha and then read. You are the shaliach of the oleh, so it is important to focus on his beracha and say amen to him. (Even more originally, there was only one beracha before and after the entire reading).  Personally, I wouldn't worry about practicing amen, and just focus on practicing the leining -- and assume you'll do it right.  </p>\n\n<p>Also, my rabbi once told me that if I delayed too long saying amen to the oleh's berachah, it would be better not to say it at all, and just start leining.  So practicing saying Amen might get you more accustomed to connecting the Amen to the leining and not to the berachah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>\"Amen\" is not necessarily a word attached to a bracha - i.e. - ones starting with \"Baruch atah Hashem...\". Some examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>When you are practicing laining parshat Ki Tavo, and you read Devarim 27:15-26, you are saying \"Amen\" 11 times.</p></li>\n<li><p>Have you answered \"Amen\" when someone gives you a bracha (e.g. - a rebbe or friend wishes you and your family long life)?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are saying \"Amen\" in these situations, I don't see that saying \"Amen\" while you practice laining should be a problem, in any situation.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to your concern that \"sometimes the ba'al kri'a gets the aliyah\", I hear you, having been a Ba'al Kri'a, myself. I occasionally get an aliyah, and I sometimes make that mistake - not the worst thing that can happen. Personally, I wouldn't worry about this, as your being called for aliyah is probably a small percentage of the time. If you do get called, daily, e.g. - you're the only Cohen, then, chances are, you've developed the habit of knowing NOT to say it, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Suggestion, that I've heard from a Rav who is also a frequent B'al Kri'ah: Don't say \"Amen\" out loud, as it gives listeners the impression that the word \"Amen\" is part of what's in the Torah, when in fact, \"Amen\" appears in the Torah only 13 times. (You can verify this, and edit if I'm wrong.) Same idea applies when saying \"Chazak, chazak, v'nitchazek\" - Look away from the Torah when you say it.</p>\n\n\n",

Today academicians, historians, and the like diligently present historical inaccuracies in the bible. For example the story of creation; it is not factually accurate to say that the world was created in 6 distinct 24 hour days. To my knowledge nearly every Jewish commentary does not read this story literally. </p>\n\n<p>The general response to historical inaccuracies I have heard is that the torah is not interested in presenting history, it is a book which teaches us how to lead a moral life by serving God.

Thus, when we pass a sign that says \"George Washington slept, here\", how do we really know that's true? Did the person who posted the sign witness G.W. sleeping? Of course not.

Hell isn't the right word, because Gehenna (Purgatory) isn't permanent. Kaddish is only said for less than a year for the dead because we presume they won't be in gehenna that long. However, according to some views there are a few extremely evil individuals whose souls are extinguished with death, or who experience eternal punishment.</p>\n\n<p>After the Resurrection of the Dead, souls will again live in bodies (either for a long time or permanently -- there are different views). This is what is often referred to as Olam HaBa. Before that occurs, however, the souls will be in \"Heaven,\" often called Gan Eden (the Garden of Eden).</p>\n\n<p>In any case, Heaven or Purgatory are not physical places. The Resurrection, however, will occur in a physical place.</p>\n\n<p>Kabbalistic Judaism also believes in reincarnation. Although belief in reincarnation did not become widespread until after the popularization of the Zohar, it is widely accepted by many Jews. It is difficult to find a widely-respected Orthodox rabbi in the last few hundred years who questions or opposes this belief. However, it is not technically required to believe in it (because Kabbalah is not considered a binding source of belief by all Orthodox Jews), and most Jews rarely discuss it.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud states that all nations (that is, all non-Jews) have a share in the World to Come (Olam HaBa). Some sources say that non-Jews will go to Heaven as long as they observe the Seven Noahide Laws (basic rules of morality that apply to all people).</p>\n\n<p>Many books and articles are available on this topic.

Out of fear of the lions, the Cutheans converted to Judaism, but\n  the rabbis of the Talmud debated whether their conversion was valid or\n  not. The Cutheans’ Torah observance was spotty — extremely strong in\n  some areas, but very weak or nonexistent in others.</p>\n  \n  <p>Settling in the Samaria region of Eretz Israel, over time the Cutheans\n  became known as Samaritans. Fearing that the Jews returning from\n  Babylonian exile would reclaim their ancestral lands, the Cutheans\n  became bitter enemies of the Jewish people, even going so far as to\n  attempting to sabotage the construction of the Second Temple.\n  Disguising their evil intentions, the Cutheans offered to help build\n  the Temple. Realizing the Cutheans’ real goal, the Jews rebuffed their\n  proposed aid. Stung by this rejection, the Cutheans convinced\n  Ahasuerus that the Jews wished to foment rebellion against Persian\n  rule, so he suspended construction.</p>\n  \n  <p>On a number of occasions during the Second Temple Era, the Cutheans\n  were an anathema to the Jewish people. Finally, when the rabbis of the\n  Talmud discovered that the Cutheans were worshiping idols and not\n  keeping the commandments, the sages expelled the Cutheans from the\n  Jewish fold and declared them to be gentiles. Although most of the\n  Cutheans eventually died out, a small group exists today, living\n  around Mount Gerizim in Israel. <strong>While they have ancient scrolls that\n  bear some resemblance to the Five Books of Moses, these descendants of\n  the ancient Cutheans have no connection to the Jewish people.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/230/Q3/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ohr Somayach</a> explains further</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Samaritans were non-Jews brought to Israel by the Assyrians to\n  populate the North after the exile of the Ten Tribes. They ostensibly\n  converted to Judaism, but in reality they continued worshipping idols,\n  save for a period when they were mistakenly considered genuine\n  converts; <strong>hence the Samaritans were not considered Jews, neither by\n  Jewish law nor by the Jewish people.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>They did not accept the Oral Tradition, which forms the overwhelming\n  bulk of Jewish law. They also did not accept any books of the Bible\n  except for the Pentateuch and the book of Joshua. Today, the Samaritan\n  version of the Torah manuscript differs from ours by about 800\n  letters.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Samaritans often acted as enemies of the Jewish people. They tried\n  to destroy the Temple and to inform against the Jews to Roman\n  authorities.

Some of the common problems found in new ovens are\ntwelve hour safety cut off, lights, icons and temperature displays\nthat may be turned on by opening the oven door, and time bake features\nthat must be manually turned off to silence the bell. In certified\nmodels, many of these features are disabled. (See appliance section\nfor details of individual models.)</p>\n<p>In addition, some Sabbath mode features such as temperature adjustment\nare quite practical and allow for easier use of the ovens on Yom Tov\nwhere the restrictions of cooking and burning are lifted when done\nunder prescribed conditions. However, the Sabbath mode features do not\nin any way circumvent the regular restrictions involved in food\npreparations on Shabbos Kodesh.The laws of Bishul, Havarah, Shehiyah\nand Chazarah must still be observed even when using a Sabbath mode\noven (see memo regarding oven use on Shabbos).</p>\n<p>Please note that these are limited to the oven and do not apply to the\nuse of the stovetop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-GettingaHandleOnYourFaucet.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Getting a Handle On Your Faucet</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Torah observant Jews know that turning on the hot water faucet during\nShabbos causes cold water to be heated, which transgresses the melacha\nof Bishul, cooking.  What many don’t know is that even turning on what\nyou think is cold water can also be a problem – if it’s a one-handled\nfaucet.</p>\n<p>Let’s first analyze why using hot water causes cold water to be\nheated.  In a typical home setting, cold water arrives from the city\nsupply under pressure.  Turning on the hot water faucet allows this\ncold water into the hot water tank which, in turn, forces out the hot\nwater already in the tank.  Since the water in the tank is typically\nmore than 120oF, the minimum temperature for bishul on Shabbos, the\nincoming cold water is immediately heated by the hot water that is\nalready in the tank. 1</p>\n<p>In a one-handled faucet, both hot and cold water are controlled by one\nhandle.  Generally, it works as follows:  When turning on the faucet\nwith the handle set in the middle position, there will be an even\nmixture of hot and cold water.  As the handle is turned towards the\nright, a valve closes off the hot water and the water will be mostly\ncold; if the handle is pushed all the way toward the right, the water\nwill be only cold.  In this case, to avoid Shabbos transgressions, one\nwould use the one-handled faucet with the handle turned towards the\nfar-right position.2</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this handle poses a Shabbos challenge since one always\nhas to remember to first push the handle lever towards the far right\nbefore turning on the faucet.  This is not how it is normally done, as\nusually someone who wants cold water turns on the faucet with the\nhandle facing the middle and then pushes it over to the right.  Force\nof habit might cause one to do this on Shabbos.  Also, a guest or\nchild may not realize that this is an issue at all, and may\nunwittingly transgress the issur of bishul on Shabbos!3  An additional\nconcern is that some one-handled faucets do not have a way of turning\n“all the way to the right.”  They turn 360 degrees around and around.  A\nperson can easily misjudge where to turn the handle.</p>\n<p>There are some one-handled faucets which have another problem, since\nby design they never shut off the hot water completely.  This means\nthat even when the handle is turned completely towards the right, some\nhot water still comes out.</p>\n<p>Practical Recommendations:</p>\n<p>Turn the hot water shutoff valve underneath the sink to the “off”\nposition every erev Shabbos.5 This could also be done on Shabbos, as\nthere is no melacha involved.</p>\n<p>Install a two-handled faucet to avoid the problem.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>If the hot water in the tank is less than 120oF, one would not be heating the cold water coming in. However, letting cold water in would\nbe forbidden anyway since it activates the gas or electric heat.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Some one-handled faucets swivel from front to back and are functionally identical to faucets that swivel from side to side.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Older shutoff valves will not bear repeated turning week after week and may eventually leak. It is best to install a lever type control\nthat turns off the water with a twist of 90 degrees.  One can reroute\nthe control so it is close to the opening of the under-sink doors,\nmaking it easy to reach.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I will quote his original question and his answer, leaving out his hava aminas, but it's worthwhile to check out the whole thing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תנא בספרי מינין כו'. בירושלמי (אמצע הלכה א') איתא, רבי עקיבא אומר אף\nהקורא בספרים החיצונים כגון ספר בן סירא וספרי בן לענה, אבל ספרי המירוס\nוכל ספרים שנכתבו מכאן ואילך הקורא בהן כקורא באגרת, מאי טעמא ויותר מהמה\nבני הזהר וגו' (קהלת יב, יב) להגיון ניתנו ליגיעה לא ניתנו ע\"כ. משמע\nשספרי בן סירא ובן לענה אסורים אפילו להגיון בעלמא, אבל מבן סירא ובן\nלענה ואילך הותרו להגיון ולא ליגיעה. וקשה בעיני טובא, חדא הלא חכמי\nהגמרא עצמם הן בירושלמי הן בבבלי הביאו כמה דברים של בן סירא, כגון בפ\"ב\nדחגיגה (יג, א), ובפ\"ו דיבמות (סג, ב), ובפרק שני דייני גזירות (כתובות\nקי, ב), ובפרק המוכר פירות (ב\"ב צח, ב), ובפרק מי שמת (שם קמו, א) וכהנה\nרבות (נדה טז, ב), עד כי רש\"י בההיא דעירובין פרק הדר (עירובין סה, א\nעי\"ש בתוס') בצר אל יורה, כתב וז\"ל בדקתי אחר מקרא זה בכל הכתובים ושמא\nבספר בן סירא הוא, וכן כתבו התוס' בפרק החובל (ב\"ק צב, ב ד\"ה משולש\nבכתובים) על ההיא דכל עוף למינו ישכון ובן אדם לדומה לו, וכן תמצא\nבירושלמי דנזיר פרק בית שמאי (הלכה ג') ובברכות פרק ג' שאכלו (הלכה ג')\nוכהנה רבות שהביא דברי בן סירא, א\"כ בהכרח למדום הימנו. ועוד קשה היאך\nמיקל יותר בספרי מירוס מבספרי בן סירא, הלא אדרבה איפכא מסתברא, כי ספרי\nמירוס הם ספרי מינים, כדתנן בהדיא בפרק בתרא דמסכת ידים (משנה ו'), ואלו\nספר בן סירא אין בו דברי מינות אלא דברי הבאי ובא עליהם לידי ביטול,\nכדמוכח בהדיא בשמעתין, וכן פירשו רש\"י (ד\"ה רב יוסף) והרי\"ף (יט, ב)\nוהרא\"ש (סימן ג') בהדיא, וז\"ל אף בספר בן סירא שיש בו דברי הבאי שאין בהן\nצורך כו':</p>\n<p>ונ\"ל שהרמב\"ם ז\"ל וסייעתו סמכו על המשנה בפ\"ב דאבות (משנה י\"ד) דקתני רבי\nאלעזר אומר הוי שקוד ללמוד תורה ודע מה שתשיב לאפיקורוס ודע לפני מי אתה\nעמל כו', ומייתי לה לעיל בפרק אחד דיני ממונות (לח, ב), וא\"ר יוחנן עלה\nלא שנו אלא אפיקורוס עבודה זרה אבל אפיקורוס ישראל כל שכן דפקר טפי. כתב\nהרמב\"ם בפירוש המשנה (אבות שם) וז\"ל ואמרו אף על פי שתלמוד דעות האומות\nלדעת איך תשיב עליהם השמר שלא יעלה בלבך דבר מן הדעות ההם, ודע שמי\nשתעבוד לפניו יודע צפון לבך, והוא אמרו ודע לפני מה אתה עמל, רצה לומר\nשיכוין לבו באמונת השי\"ת עכ\"ל. הרי גילה דעתו מבוארת ומבוררת בכוונת\nהמשנה זו, שצוה התנא שילמוד דעות האפיקורסין ויהא שקוד ללמוד תורה, כדי\nשידע מה ישיב להם על דעותיהם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary, he was bothered by the following question, Rabbi Akiva says that one who reads \"sefarim hachitzonim\" loses his portion in olam haba, and examples of sefarim hachitzonim are sefarim \"Ben Sira\" and \"Ben La'ana\". However, we see in many places in the gemara where sefer Ben Sira is brought down, which obviously means that the chachmei hatalmud had read this book. We also see that some of the rishonim have read the book. What could their heter have been?! The Be'er Sheva answers that the mishna in pirkei avos allows one to read such book in order to know what to respond to heretics.</p>\n<p>Here is the Rambam's peirush to that mishna:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>למד דברים שתשיב בהם על האפיקורוסים מן האומות, ותתווכח עמהם ותענה להם אם יקשו לך. ואמרו: \"לא שנו אלא אפיקורוס גוי, אבל ישראל כל שכן דפקר\", רצונו לומר: שהוא יוסיף זלזול ולגלוג, ולפיכך אין ראוי לדון עמו כלל, לפי שהוא לא יתוקן, ואין לו רפואה כלל, \"כל באיה לא ישובון ולא י(ס)[ש]יגו אורחות חיים\" +משלי ב יט+. ואמר, ועם היותך לומד דעות האומות כדי שתדע איך תשיב עליהם, היזהר שלא ידבק בדעתך דבר מזה, ודע כי אשר תעבוד לפניו ידע צפונותיך, והוא אומרו: ודע לפני מי אתה עמל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The main point in the Rambam that I wanted to bring down is that one should study these types of books, but one should also be careful not to let it slip too far, and one should always delineate between that which he believes and that which he knows in order to answer heretics.</p>\n<p>(Derech Agav, I've seen the Medresh Shmuel on this mishna in avos say that the way one should study these ideas is certainly not on a superficial level, because then one won't be able to hold his own in a real debate. Rather, one must study these ideas and incorporate them into his own knowledge as well as any other topic and really make it his own.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>As you mentioned, the verse says in Deut. 12:</p>\n<p>כט  כִּי-יַכְרִית יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֶת-הַגּוֹיִם, אֲשֶׁר אַתָּה בָא-שָׁמָּה לָרֶשֶׁת אוֹתָם--מִפָּנֶיךָ; וְיָרַשְׁתָּ אֹתָם, וְיָשַׁבְתָּ בְּאַרְצָם.   29</p>\n<p>When/because/definitely Hashem your God shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go in to dispossess them, and you shall dispossess them, and dwell in their land;</p>\n<p>ל  הִשָּׁמֶר לְךָ, פֶּן-תִּנָּקֵשׁ אַחֲרֵיהֶם, אַחֲרֵי, הִשָּׁמְדָם מִפָּנֶיךָ; וּפֶן-תִּדְרֹשׁ לֵאלֹהֵיהֶם לֵאמֹר, אֵיכָה יַעַבְדוּ הַגּוֹיִם הָאֵלֶּה אֶת-אֱלֹהֵיהֶם, וְאֶעֱשֶׂה-כֵּן, גַּם-אָנִי.</p>\n<p>30 take heed to yourself that your <strong>be not ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that you inquire not after their gods, saying: 'How used these nations to serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.'</strong></p>\n<p>לא  לֹא-תַעֲשֶׂה כֵן, לַיהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ:  כִּי כָל-תּוֹעֲבַת יְהוָה אֲשֶׁר שָׂנֵא, עָשׂוּ לֵאלֹהֵיהֶם--כִּי גַם אֶת-בְּנֵיהֶם וְאֶת-בְּנֹתֵיהֶם, יִשְׂרְפוּ בָאֵשׁ לֵאלֹהֵיהֶם.</p>\n<p>31 You shalt not do so unto Hashem your God; for every abomination to the LORD, which He hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods.</p>\n<p>Among other verses.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now, beyond straight up idolatry, even works of philosophy and even rationalistic philosophical approaches to the Torah that have entered our Rabbinic literature for whatever reason, are a severe, severe prohibition - so all the more so the ways of heresy God forbid - except only certain extraordinary Tzaddikim needed to descend into them for specific reasons on \"special missions\" to repair \"souls\" and extricate holiness, and repair and redeem things - per Likutei Moharan #64.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Likutei_Etzot%2C_Philosophy_and_Secular_Wisdom.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Likutei_Etzot%2C_Philosophy_and_Secular_Wisdom.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he</a></p>\n<p>ט. אִסּוּר גָּדוֹל לְעַיֵּן בְּסִפְרֵי הַמְחַקְּרִים. כִּי יֵשׁ כַּמָּה קֻשְׁיוֹת שֶׁנִּמְשָׁכִין מִבְּחִינַת חָלָל הַפָּנוּי שֶׁאִי אֶפְשָׁר לִמְצֹא עֲלֵיהֶם תֵּרוּץ בְּשׁוּם אֹפֶן, רַק לֶעָתִיד לָבוֹא יִתְגַּלֶּה הַתֵּרוּץ, אֲבָל בְּזֶה הָעוֹלָם אִי אֶפְשָׁר לְיַשְּׁבָם בְּשׁוּם שֵׂכֶל. וּמִי שֶׁמְּעַיֵּן בְּאֵלּוּ הַחָכְמוֹת הַנִּמְשָׁכִין מִשָּׁם, יִהְיֶה נִשְׁקָע וְנֶאֱבָד שָׁם לְעוֹלָם, כִּי עָלֶיהָ נֶאֱמַר: \"כָּל בָּאֶיהָ לֹא יְשׁוּבוּן\". כִּי אִי אֶפְשָׁר לִמְצֹא בָּהֶם אֶת הַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ וּלְהָשִׁיב עַל הַקֻּשְׁיוֹת וְהַמְּבוּכוֹת שֶׁבָּהֶם בְּשׁוּם שֵׂכֶל. רַק יִשְׂרָאֵל, עַל־יְדֵי אֱמוּנָה עוֹבְרִים עַל כָּל הַחָכְמוֹת וְעַל כָּל הַמְּבוּכוֹת שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם. כִּי הֵם מַאֲמִינִים בְּהַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ וּבְתוֹרָתוֹ הַקְּדוֹשָׁה בְּלִי שׁוּם חֲקִירָה וְחָכְמָה, רַק בֶּאֱמוּנָה שְׁלֵמָה. וְעַל שֵׁם זֶה נִקְרָאִים יִשְׂרָאֵל \"עִבְרִים\", עַל שֶׁעַל־יְדֵי אֱמוּנָתָם הֵם עוֹבְרִים וְעוֹלִים עַל כָּל מִינֵי חָכְמוֹת וַחֲקִירוֹת. כִּי אֵינָם צְרִיכִים לַחֲקֹר אַחַר הָאֱמֶת כְּלָל, כִּי הֵם יוֹדְעִים הָאֱמֶת לַאֲמִתּוֹ עַל־יְדֵי אֱמוּנָתָם הַשְּׁלֵמָה, שֶׁמַּאֲמִינִים בְּהָאֱמֶת כְּפִי מַה שֶּׁקִּבְּלוּ מֵאֲבוֹתֵינוּ וְרַבּוֹתֵינוּ זַ\"ל. וְעַל־יְדֵי זֶה הֵם עוֹבְרִים וְעוֹלִים עַל כָּל הַחָכְמוֹת כֻּלָּם: (לק\"א סי' ס\"ד אות ב')</p>\n<p><strong>It is forbidden to delve into philosophical works.</strong> There are certain questions which stem from the chalal hapanui, “the empty void,” to which it is impossible to find any answer. In time to come the answers will be revealed. But in this world it is impossible to put these questions to rest merely with thought and ingenuity. Whole philosophical systems have been built up around them. <strong>Anyone who delves into them will be sunk in them and lost eternally, as it is written: “None that go unto her return” (Proverbs 2:19). God is not to be found in these philosophies. Through intelligence alone it will never be possible to solve the intellectual tangles they contain. The Jewish people, with its faith in God, is beyond all these philosophies and their complications. Israel believes in God and His Holy Torah without needing philosophical justifications. They have pure faith. The Hebrew word for “beyond” is עבר, e-ver, and the Jews are called עברים, Ivrim — Hebrews — precisely because they are beyond all this speculation. With a faith which transcends philosophy we do not need to speculate about the truth. We know it. We have received it from our fathers, of blessed memory (Likutei Moharan 64:2).</strong></p>\n<p>י. וְדַע, שֶׁיֵּשׁ צַדִּיקִים גְּדוֹלִים שֶׁהֵם צְרִיכִין דַּוְקָא לְעַיֵּן בְּאֵלּוּ הַחָכְמוֹת, כִּי עַל יְדֵי עִיּוּנָם בָּהֶם הֵם מַעֲלִין וּמוֹצִיאִין מֵהֶם כַּמָּה נְשָׁמוֹת שֶׁנָּפְלוּ וְנִשְׁקְעוּ בָּהֶם. וְעַל־כֵּן אַל תָּבִיא לְךָ רְאָיָה מִמַּה שֶּׁמָּצִינוּ כַּמָּה גְּדוֹלֵי הַקַּדְמוֹנִים שֶׁעָסְקוּ בְּאֵלּוּ הַחָכְמוֹת, כִּי הָיוּ מֻכְרָחִים לָזֶה כַּנַּ\"ל. וּלְגֹדֶל קְדֻשָּׁתָם הָעֲצוּמָה הֶעֱלוּ נְשָׁמוֹת שֶׁנָּפְלוּ בָּהֶם, כַּנַּ\"ל. אֲבָל אֲנָשִׁים שֶׁאֵינָם גְּדוֹלִים בְּצִדְקוּת כָּל כָּךְ, מִכָּל שֶׁכֵּן אֲנָשִׁים פְּשׁוּטִים, בִּפְרָט בַּדּוֹרוֹת הַלָּלוּ, חָלִילָה לְהִסְתַּכֵּל וְלִכְנֹס בָּהֶם, כִּי יִהְיֶה נִשְׁקָע וְנֶאֱבָד שָׁם לְעוֹלָם רַחֲמָנָא לִצְלָן: (שם אות ג')</p>\n<p><strong>Certain of the great Tzaddikim were obliged to go into these philosophies in order to extricate and elevate the souls which have fallen and become sunk in them.

    "content": "# Why is it important that God created the first pair of tongs?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It says in Pirkei Avot 5:6 that God made the first pair of tongs immediately before creation.</p>\n\n<p>Could not one have made tongs out of bone or wood wrapped in leather or made with a metal, such as gold, that can be \"cold forged\" and shaped without heat?</p>\n\n<p>Why is it theologically important that noone could have made tongs without tongs and that God made the first pair?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>As quoted <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/40949/440\">here</a> from the Lubavitcher Rebbe, the theological significance of tongs is that they are preparatory - they exist for the purpose of making something else - and the idea of G-d creating them is that even things which are preparatory to something holy and significant can itself be worthwhile and significant.</p>\n\n<p>As for the second question, creation of new things was limited to the first 6 days. Anything that was going to be made directly from G-d had to be made then. (See <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16462#showrashi=true&v=9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Koheles 1:9</a> and Rashi there).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You need a pair of tongs to make a pair of tongs. So, where did the first blacksmith get that first pair of tongs? HaKaddoshBaruchHu provided the necessary as part of creation. Problem solved. Note that this is in the same neighborhood as the list of other items that, more or less seriously, could not have come about in the normal course of things.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ten things were created at twilight of Shabbat eve. These are: the\n  mouth of the earth [that swallowed Korach]; the mouth of [Miriam's]\n  well; the mouth of [Balaam's] ass; the rainbow; the manna; [Moses']\n  staff; the shamir; the writing, the inscription and the tablets [of\n  the Ten Commandments]. Some say also the burial place of Moses and the\n  ram of our father Abraham. And some say also the spirits of\n  destruction as well as the original tongs, for tongs are made with\n  tongs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The theological issue is how to account for a list of phenomena that don't fit into the orderly operations of the natural world. And then, at the end, we get, 'some also say', which is a definite weakening. Since it takes tongs to make tongs (if you don't think practically about wooden alternatives), the first pair of tongs is in the same category as the mouths. I tend to see this as a bit of rabbinic wit. The thinkers of Pirkei were, perhaps not entirely seriously, solving the problem of 'tongs all the way down.' </p>\n\n<p>A more serious view of this comes from Be'er Avot:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tongs, which are made with tongs – The tongs are a metaphor for the\n  human ability to invent. In truth, no invention is really new, for all\n  the raw material and creative thinking needed to develop new\n  technology was given to Man by G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's important that tongs start from G-d and not from people to make a point, perhaps theological, about ultimate origin of creativity.</p>\n\n\n",

It is also better to wait until they are old enough to understand its seriousness and appreciate the value of tefillah.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Where in <em>halacha</em> does it say this? (i.e. <em>Shulchan Aruch, Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em> or <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>)</p></li>\n<li><p>What is considered below <em>chinuch</em> in <em>halacha</em>?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This is from the Mishna Brurah 98:3 who quotes the Shla Hakodosh:</p>\n\n<p>ג) בניו הקטנים - בשל\"ה קורא תגר על המביאים ילדים לבהכ\"נ והיינו קטנים שעדיין לא הגיעו לחינוך מטעם כי הילדים משחקים ומרקדים בבהכ\"נ ומחללים קדושת בהכ\"נ וגם מבלבלים דעת המתפללים ועוד גם כי יזקינו לא יסוקו ממנהגם הרע אשר נתחנכו בילדותם להשתגע ולבזות קדושת בהכ\"נ אבל כשהגיעו לחינוך אדרבה יביאנו אתו לבהכ\"נ וילמדהו אורחות חיים לישב באימה וביראה ולא יניחנו לזוז ממקומו ויזרזהו לענות אמן וקדיש וקדושה עי\"ש בסוף עניני תפילה וקה\"ת. ועיין בתנא דבי אליהו ח\"א פי\"ג גודל העונש שיש להאב שמניח את בנו לענות דברים של הבל ותפלות בבהכ\"נ:</p>\n\n<p>In Short: The Shla was very against those who bring children who aren't the age of chinuch and run around and disturb the cong and disgraces the beis hakenesses. It also leaves an impression on a child who ran around in shul as a child. As an adult he still might treat the shul with no respect because of it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To add to what @sam has already answered...</p>\n<p>Essentially, when it comes to bringing children to shul we need strike a careful balance. On the one hand children should be trained to daven properly<sup>1</sup> but at the same time, they should only be brought to shul,<sup>2</sup> providing they do not disturb others.(As noted above in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.98.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berurah 98:3</a>)</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Aseret_HaDibrot%2C_Tamid%2C_Ner_Mitzva.130?vhe=Shenei_Luchot_HaBrit,_based_on_Amsterdam,_1698_ed._Part_II&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">של\"ה הקדוש</a> writes at length at how children can be incredibly disruptive, whether it be running around, shouting, laughing, singing etc. all of which disturb the sanctity of shul. He writes rather strongly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"והמביא טף בזה האופן לבית הכנסת אין ראוי לו לקוות על זה שכר כי אם לדאג מן הפורענות\"</p>\n<p>“And one who brings a child in this manner to shul, it is not fitting for him to aspire to receive reward and should rather worry of the punishment that is befitting him”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aside from the parent having to interrupt their own davening to play with the child, it can have untold effects of the child’s future outlook, as their strict treatment in Shul may well be something that they negatively associate with shul into adulthood.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>It is therefore worth noting that as well as ensuring that one's child is able to act with the correct conduct in shul, a lot of it is down to the timing. Rav Wolbe\n(זריעה ובנין בחינוך, 'בית כנסת ותפילה', עמוד מו) asserts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"בתפילה צריכה להיות נשמה של יהודי. אם מכריחים את הילד להתפלל כהרגל חיצוני, ואולי גם מכים לו אם אינו מתפלל, ממאיסים עליו את התפילה. אחר-כך, כאשר הוא כבר בחור מבוגר – אין לו שום קשר נפשי עם התפילה, והאשמה רובצת כל ראשם של ההורים שהכריחו אותו להתפלל בגיל מוקדם מדי.\"</p>\n<p>“Tefilla should be in a Jew’s neshama. If one forces a child to daven in a superficially habitual manner, perhaps striking the child if he doesn't daven, they make him despise tefilla. Ultimately, when he is older he will feel no inner connection with tefilla, and the fault will lie with his parents who forced him to daven before he was ready.”<sup>4</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.106.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 106:2</a> where it writes about children within the context of tefillah - \"וקטנים שהגיעו לחינוך חייבים לחנכם\" -\"And children that arrive at the age of chinuch, one is obligated to educate them (i.e. in tefillah)</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.3a.17?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Chagigah.3a.17.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">.תוספות ד\"ה 'כדי ליתן שכר למביאיהן', מסכת חגיגה ג</a> which learns from the מצוה of הקהל (which requires children to be brought as it provides reward to those who bring them), that \"ועל זה סמכו להביא קטנים בבית הכנסת\" – “And upon this, [people] have relied to bring small children to shul”.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> The Shelah adds there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"כי יגדלו הנערים על זה המנהג הרע והתכונה הזרה וכל אשר יגדלו עוד יוסיפו סרה להבזות בעיניהם ענין בית הכנסת  וקדושתו ולא יתנו כבוד לתורה\"</p>\n<p>“When the child will grow up accustomed to his ill treatment (of davening) and all who grow up will continue to despise the concept of shul and its sanctity and will not give honour to the Torah”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>4</sup> On the flipside, if a child is ready but they need a lot of assistance as they familiarise themselves with the סידור and the mechanics of תפילה, it may well be worth the father davening properly at an earlier מנין and then be more readily available to help them at a later מנין. In a similar vein, HaRav Chaim Kanievsky שליט\"א records a question in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50216&st=&pgnum=18&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חנוך לנער, פרק א', 'חינוך ל'תפילה' עמוד יח</a>, where the questioner asks what to do if he wants to daven at an earlier מנין (i.e. to daven ותיקין), but he also wants to train his child by taking him to shul but it is too early for the child. In that instance, Rav Kanievsky advises him to daven at the earlier מנין and then go with his son to the later מנין. A lot of it would seem to be basic, comment sense that a parent should use to see whether their child is of the correct maturity to behave in shul and gain from the experience.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What's the Bishul Akum heter for hard-boiled eggs?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've seen prepackaged hard-boiled eggs in the grocery store with an OU. As eggs are relatively inedible raw, what is the heter vis-a-vis bishul akum for them? (Or are they having a Jewish mashgiach turn on the equipment in the factory?) Would we say they're not fit for a state banquet?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>These eggs are cooked by boilers that run constantly. The OU ensures that when the boiler needs to be restarted, it is done with a Mashgiach.</p>\n\n<p>Source: I heard it from a Rabbi who asked the OU and got that answer. Of course we may not be talking about the same company, but the point being that the OU requires the Bishul Yisroel and makes arrangements for it.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the OU publishes <a href=\"http://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/master-list-of-bishul-akum-status-of-foods/\">9 reasons</a> why something may not be required to be Bishul Yisroel. Of particular relevance to this case is #8:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"8\">\n  <li>Steamed in a factory’s specialized equipment:\n  Foods cooked with direct steam and in a factory which uses equipment which is radically different than the type used in a home aren’t subject to the prohibition of bishul akum.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So in addition to the first point (which applied to one egg making operation, but perhaps not the one you are looking at), if the eggs are cooked with direct steam - if that is possible - then no Bishul Yisroel would be required, according to the OU. This is a position which many other certification agencies take, and certain types of manufacturing processes often use direct steam instead of traditional cooking, so it is a very common leniency.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is the response I received to my query from the OU. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dear Gershon,   Thank you for contacting the OU.

It stands to reason that if you can't benefit from the work anyway, there's no benefit to you in asking him to be your \"Shabbat goy\", so let's look first at the case where there was no asking -- he just did it on his own.  The answer there, citing OC 318:1 and Mishna Berurah and Biur Halacha there, says, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><p>If a biblical prohibition was violated purposefully (deoraita bemeizid) then no one can derive benefit from it for the rest of shabbat, and the violator himself cannot derive benefit forever.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If a rabbinic prohibition was violated purposefully (derabanan bemeizid) then no one including himself can derive benefit from it for the rest of shabbat and everyone is permitted to derive benefit after shabbat.

Asking a Jew to do work is a more serious transgression than asking a non-Jew, as it causes someone who is obligated to keep Shabbat to violate it. By asking a fellow Jew to violate Shabbat, the requester violates \"Lifnei Iver lo Titen Michshal\" - the issur forbidding a Jew to cause another Jew to violate a law he is obligated in.

That is the items that were not part of the normal \"laws of nature\" that had been created during the first six days of creation had to be created just before Shabbos, which put a stop to \"creation\".

I understand that basically this is a zecher l'mikdash. However, is there a source for the minhag to place specifically two menorot? The first Beit Hamikdash only had one menorah, and the second Beit Hamikdash had 11 I think. An additional difference from the Beit Hamikdash is that many shuls have menorot that do not have 7 branches (either more or less) and have a decorative center piece rather than a shamash.

If a mistake is considered \"stealing\" then why is it suddenly allowed? And if a mistake is not considered \"stealing\" then why isn't it allowed by Jews as well?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are a few issues that should be pointed out before we can try to understand these laws. There is a difference halachicaly between stealing and damaging vs returning and reparations. Whereas stealing and damaging is not allowed whether done to a Jew or a nonJew, payment and reparation is reserved for members of the Jew club. A similar point is mentioned in a note on the shulchan aruch in the beginning of the laws concerning interest. Hopefully after the proliferation of insurance policies and buyers clubs this idea will be more readily accepted. However this idea that a Jew would not pay reparations for damages his ox caused to a nonjew is recorded in the Talmud as causing animosity between its and the nonjews.</p>\n\n<p>Back to our Ramma. The first situation the Ramma discusses is tricking the nonjew, such as confusing him in his reckoning. In this situation what ends happening is an agreed upon transaction with misgivings. A transaction with misgivings between Jews is either not valid or there is a need to repay the one who got ripped off, as we find in laws of onaa and mekach taos. Again, these are laws reserved for members of the Jew club. This allowance to trick the nonjew is not a simple permission as the Ramma himself ends off that some say this is not allowed unless the nonjew mixes himself up. The Shach. #3 quotes the Maharshal who says even in this situation the Jew must tell the nonjews 'see, how i am relying upon your reckoning', so as to absolve himself from all involvement in this mistake.</p>\n\n<p>The Second case in the Ramma gets back to our discussion before about payment and reparation. To repeat with clarification, stealing from a nonjew is not allowed, possibly even on a biblical level see Shach #2, with the need to return a stolen item depending on that classification. However,  the payment of a debt is different. This is quantified in Shach #3 in the name of Maharshal, a debt such as an old loan or a tax is what is allowed to be ignored (הפקעת הלואתו) as long as there is no desecration of Hashem's name.

Apparently, this type of amendment was not applied to Yekum Purkan. Why would we not care about uttering words that are not proper?

It may be that at the time this prayer was written, the institution of the resh galuthah, the Exilarch , might still have been extant.

    "content": "# Recommend introductory resources on Jewish traditions in the Balkans\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A couple of years ago I found out that I have some Jewish ancestry when investigating my family's history. I know that my great grandfather perished in the holocaust, but I was led to believe that it was not because he was Jewish but simply one of the other types of \"undesirables\" (people from my parents' homeland were killed alongside Jews so this was highly plausible). </p>\n\n<p>After some research I found that he was Jewish. Though this relative is on my mother's side, he is the father of her father so from my understanding this would mean I am not considered Jewish by Orthodox standards (I am looking to find out more information about my other relatives but most I've researched so far do have church records, so it seems unlikely they were Jewish).</p>\n\n<p>Despite not being considered Jewish, I would nevertheless like to learn more about Jewish traditions and beliefs so I can understand more about my background and get a sense of what life was like for someone like my great grandfather growing up. I was wondering if there are introductory resources that talk about Jewish belief and tradition in the Balkans as I would love to read them.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>First of all, you might want to be a bit more specific. \"The Balkans\" comprises a large land mass and includes half a dozen different countries - some of which, like Greece, have a great deal of literature written about them. If it is only material of a very general nature that you are looking for, I would start with the following article, and then follow up on its sources:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Annette B. Fromm, \"Hispanic Culture in Exile: Sephardic Life in the\n  Ottoman Balkans\", in <em>Sephardic & Mizrahi Jewry: From the Golden Age\n  of Spain to Modern Times</em> (ed. Zion Zohar; New York University, 2005),\n  145-166.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, there appears to be some material of relevance in this article as well, which might also be of interest to you:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Aron Rodrigue, \"The Ottoman Diaspora: The Rise and Fall of Ladino\n  Literary Culture\", in <em>Cultures of the Jews: A New History</em> (ed. David\n  Biale; Schocken Books, 2002), 863-885.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you also want to find material that pertains to their experiences in the Shoah, you should start with Raul Hilberg, <em>The Destruction of the European Jews</em> (3 vols.; Holmes & Meier, 1985), 679-860. Given the German re-appropriation of land to their allies, you will find material there about Hungary as well - which I expect will be less of relevance to you.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Understanding a Fine Point in the Rambam's Laws of Yibbum",
    "content": "# Understanding a Fine Point in the Rambam's Laws of Yibbum\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In MT, <em>Hilkhot Yibbum veChalitzah</em> 7:11, the Rambam presents the case of three brothers, two of whom are married to two sisters and the third of whom is married to an unrelated woman. In the event that one of the brothers who is married to one of the sisters dies, the childless widow is forbidden to the brother who is married to her sister, but may perform either chalitzah or yibbum with the third brother. Supposing that the third brother marries her, that her sister (who is married to the first brother) subsequently dies, and that he (the third brother, currently married to two unrelated women) dies after her, the twice-widowed woman is forbidden to the remaining brother since she was already forbidden to him once before.</p>\n\n<p>To phrase it differently, imagine that Reuben, Shimon and Levi are brothers, that Reuben and Shimon marry Rachel and Leah - both of whom are sisters - and that Levi marries Miriam, who is related to none of the others. Reuben dies and his wife, Rachel (who is forbidden to Shimon, since he is married to her sister) performs yibbum with Levi. Subsequently, Leah dies, after which Levi dies as well. Levi's widows, Rachel and Miriam, now come before the remaining brother, Shimon, who is forbidden to marry Rachel on the grounds that she was already forbidden to him once before.</p>\n\n<p>This same scenario (almost verbatim) appears in the Mishna (Yevamot 3:7), on which the Rambam comments that no law is provided - neither in the Talmud nor in the writings of any of the geonim - as regards whether or not this remaining brother (Shimon) can perform yibbum with the <em>other</em> widow (Miriam: the one who is unrelated to the two sisters). He rules strictly, that she should perform chalitzah just in case, but famously changes his mind between writing his commentary on the Mishna and writing his Mishne Torah, and rules in the later source that she is exempt from both chalitzah and yibbum.</p>\n\n<p>In trying to understand the Rambam's reasoning for this new opinion, I am struck by another difference between the two passages: in <em>Hilkhot Yibbum veChalitzah</em> 7:11, the Rambam also declares that the first of the two women (Rachel: the twice-widowed woman, whose sister was Leah) is forbidden to the remaining brother (Shimon), not only because she was already forbidden to him at one time (that time being when her husband, Reuben, died), but also in accordance with a seemingly unrelated principle: that a man is forbidden to marry the widow of a brother who died before he was born (כדין אשת אח שלא היה בעולמו).</p>\n\n<p>My question is two-fold:</p>\n\n<p>1) What is the relationship between this law (אשת אח שלא היה בעולמו) and the situation under discussion (נאסרה עליו עולמית משום שנאסרה עליו שעה אחת)? How are they in any way similar?</p>\n\n<p>2) Does a recognition of the relationship between these two principles shed light on why the Rambam might have felt that her co-wife was <em>also</em> forbidden to him, and thus exempt from needing to perform either chalitzah or yibbum - in contrast to the ruling previously published by him?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The relevant passage in the Rambam reads as follows:</p>\n\n<p>שלשה אחין שנים מהן נשואין שתי אחיות והשלישי נשוי נכרית. מת אחד מבעלי אחיות ויבם הנשוי נכרית את אשתו ואחר כך מתה אשתו של שני ואחר כך מת השלישי ונפלו שתי נשיו לפני השני שאין לו אשה הרי אלו פטורות מן החליצה ומן היבום. <strong>האחת מפני שהיתה אחות אשתו בשעה שמת אחיו הראשון נאסרה עליו לעולם משום אשת אח כדין אשת אחיו שלא היה בעולמו</strong> והנכרית משום צרתה.‏</p>\n\n<p>The part that I have difficulty with is in bold.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Mishnah says that the sister Rachel is forbidden to do yibum with Shimon because of the rule \"since she was forbidden at one time, she is forbidden forever\".</p>\n\n<p>But the Rambam when he wrote his commentary on the Mishnah was in doubt whether this rule was D’Oraissa (from the Torah) or D’Rabbanan (Rabbinic). This question affects the law of the non-sister Miriam, which is not stated explicitly in the Mishnah.</p>\n\n<p>If the rule is D’Oraissa then Miriam is forbidden to do yibum with Shimon and is free to marry someone else without having to do chalitzah, like the normal law of a co-wife of an ervah (a female relative that one is forbidden to marry).</p>\n\n<p>But if the rule is D’Rabbanan then the law would be like that of the secondary ervahs which are forbidden D’Rabbanan, in which case the rule is that the co-wife Miriam is not allowed to do yibum because otherwise people might mistakenly think that one can do yibum with an ervah, but she cannot marry anyone else until she does chalitzah since according to the Torah Rachel is not a real ervah.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, because of this doubt, the Rambam wrote in his Mishnah commentary that Miriam must do chalitzah as a stringency.</p>\n\n<p>But by the time that he wrote his Mishneh Torah he had decided that the rule \"since she was forbidden at one time, she is forbidden forever\" is a D’Oraissa rule and Rachel is an ervah according to the Torah. Therefore Miriam can marry someone else without doing chalitzah,  like the normal law of a co-wife.</p>\n\n<p>And to make it clear that Rachel is forbidden D’Oraissa to do yibum with Shimon, the Rambam did not write the rule cited in the Mishnah - that she is forbidden because \"since she was forbidden at one time, she is forbidden forever\" but instead wrote that she is forbidden <strong>like</strong> the law of \"a man is forbidden to marry the widow of a brother who died before he was born\". That is, just as in that case she a forbidden ervah D’Oraissa forever, so too in our case Rachel is a forbidden ervah D’Oraissa forever, and therefore Miriam can definitely marry without having to chalitzah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The Origins of the Zohar - Why is it accepted as being true?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've read arguments and counter arguments for the origins of the <em>Zohar</em> and I'm perplexed.</p>\n\n<p>I personally accept the truths in <em>kabbalah</em> and <em>chassidut</em>, but I didn't realize how the <em>Zohar</em> sort of just \"appeared\" one day in 13th/14th century. <em>Le-havdil</em>, this sounds like how other religions start; with one man claiming to have found an ancient text he won't let anyone else see.</p>\n\n<p>For sure, there are traditional arguments - and even secular academic ones - that paint a better picture of events and present other possibilities for the provenance of the texts of the <em>Zohar</em>.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: With such a shaky story, do we say that <em>Zohar</em> is accepted based on the truth it contains (i.e. regardless of where it is actually stems from) rather than the <em>mesorah</em> (since it apparently doesn't have one)? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>According to the <em>haqdamah</em> of the <em>Mishneh Torah</em>, it seems that any book(s) or commentary(s) which may have arisen after the <em>hhatimath ha-talmudh</em> (\"the sealing of the <em>Talmudh</em>\") - such as the writings of the <em>geonim</em> or even the Rambam's own book - are measured by their faithfulness to the halakhic and aggadic literature bequeathed to us by <em>Hazal</em> and their students (i.e. <em>Mishnah</em>, <em>Tosefta</em>, <em>Mekhiltoth</em>, <em>Sifra</em>, <em>Sifre</em>, <em>Bavli</em>, <em>Yerushalmi</em>, and the Tannaitic <em>midrashim</em>/<em>baraytoth</em>). Much like the prophets were tested against the collective <em>mesorah</em> up until their time, and by abrogation of it they themselves were rejected, so also are books composed since the close of the Talmudic age in need of such \"testing.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now, granted that there are two types of potential errors in such books:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unintentional errors of interpretation or logical understanding, etc.</strong> - In other words, a certain <em>talmidh hakhamim</em> codifies the <em>halakhah</em> as he sees it and explains <em>hashqafah</em> as he understands it from <em>Tanakh</em> and <em>Hazal</em>, but perhaps the <em>halakhah</em> is not like him and perhaps he misunderstands such issues as the nature of suffering or the function of <em>sekhar wa-`onesh</em> (or similar issues). These types of potential \"mistakes\" do not necessarily disqualify the author, rather we see that to attempt to understand Torah is a process where have to accept that different views of Torah from the sources is not only possible but probable. </li>\n<li><strong>Departures from <em>mesorah</em> or attempts to replace it/abrogate it</strong> - Should a new book or treatise be written that stands in opposition to the <em>halakhah</em> or <em>hashqafah</em> as expressed by <em>Tanakh</em> and <em>Hazal</em> - especially that which seeks not to understand but to supplant - is to be rejected. Examples are \"new revelations\" that, rather than seek to understand the statements of <em>Hazal</em> in aggregate, attempt to make the case for \"secret teachings\" or \"hidden meanings\" that are in contradiction to established <em>mesorah</em> - such books and their authors are to be rejected.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: I am aware that the above are fairly general and that it could be discussed in more detail, such as when to set aside <em>midrashim</em> in favor of <em>peshat</em> or outdated \"scientific\" ideas in order to incorporate new ones. However, for now these definitions should suffice for this answer.]</p>\n\n<p>Certainly each of the above has limitations. For example, and perhaps most importantly, there are ideas about which different views are not acceptable and cannot be tolerated, such as the nature of the <em>yihhudh</em> <em>HaShem</em>, or the fact of a physical, bodily resurrection, or the permanence and immutability of the Torah. Such things (and those like them) define <em>apiqorsim</em> and <em>minim</em> (cf. <em>Hilkhoth Teshuvah</em> 3:14-17f) , and the Rambam - drawing on the text of the <em>Mishnah</em> and logical monotheism - composed his 13 Foundations of Jewish faith to show us where our speculation may go before it is undone and where we are not allowed to budge in our basic religious ideas and ideals.</p>\n\n<p>Many books have come on the scene - both pre-Talmudic and post - claiming to be authentic to our <em>mesorah</em>, or to extend it, or to replace it. Examples include the \"New Testament,\" the \"<em>Qur'aan</em>,\" the \"Kebra Nagast,\" the books of the Shabbateans (followers of Shabbetai Tzvi, <em>yimahh shemo wa-zikhro</em>, and many others. Many of them were accepted by great people. If <em>Shelomoh HaMelekh</em> could worship idols, if <em>Elisha` ben Avuyah</em> (\"<em>Ahher</em>\") could accept the idea of <em>ribbui reshayoth</em> from the books of the dualists, if Yohhanan Kohen Gadhol could become a <em>Ssaduqi</em> at the end of his life, if the Hakham Ssvi z\"l could accept Shabbetai Tzvi (<em>yimahh shemo</em>) as the <em>mashiyyahh</em>, and if the Hafess Hhayyim z\"l could be led to accept the blatantly forged (supposedly lost) <em>Seder Qodhashin</em> of the <em>Talmudh Yerushalmi</em> (and even changing his halakhic practices based on the forgery), then the fact that the <em>Zohar</em> was accepted by many great scholars when it first published should neither surprise us nor become the sure basis for its acceptance.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, one of the most common misconceptions is the equating of <em>qabbalah</em> with the <em>Zohar</em> literature; if the latter is rejected, it is thought, then the former ceases to exist. Such an idea is patently false, but nevertheless demonstrates how entrenched in the minds of contemporary Judaism is the idea that all authentic spirituality or \"mysticism\" in Judaism is inextricably linked to the ideas expressed in the <em>Zohar</em>. The fact is that the bodies of knowledge known as <em>ma'aseh merqavah</em> (\"Workings of the Chariot\" - i.e. metaphysics) and <em>ma'aseh bereshith</em> (\"Workings of the Creation\" - i.e. physics) - as mentioned in the <em>Mishnah</em>, <em>masekhet Hhaghighah</em> - preceded the 13th century publication of the <em>Zohar</em> by [possibly] thousands of years, as did the <em>Sefer Yessirah</em>. The <em>Sefer Yessirah</em> is referred to and expounded by the <em>Kuzari</em> and Sa'adyah Gaon, among others. The Rambam himself makes veiled references to these ideas in his <em>Moreh HaNevokhim</em>, expounding (where possible) mystical and philosophical concepts related to both <em>ma'aseh bereshith</em> and <em>ma'aseh merqavah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But this leads to another fact that is often overlooked in the history of the <em>Zohar</em> - many qabbalists at the time of its publication (and afterward) <strong><em>rejected it as being authentic</em></strong>. Rabbi Avraham Zacuto, in his <em>Sefer HaYuhhasin</em>, relates the extant portion of an account written by the well-known qabbalist Rabbi Yisshhaq De-Akko (a <em>talmidh</em> of the Ramban) who traveled to the home of Mosheh De Leon and offered to purchase the original manuscripts of the <em>Zohar</em> from his widow, whereupon she confessed to him that there were no original manuscripts and that her late husband had forged it and attributed it to Shimon ben Yohhai in an effort to gain acclaim and a higher purchase price. Other well-known qabbalists who rejected the <em>Zohar</em> as an authentic book of <em>mesorah</em> were Rabbi Ya'aqov Emden and the <em>Hhathem Sofer</em> (who was the student of the famed and intense mystic, Rabbi Nathan Adler). Their use of language is strong against the <em>Zohar</em>, using words like \"forgery\" and \"lies\" to describe it. All the while, however, these men and others maintained a highly-developed mystical system based on earlier literature.</p>\n\n<p>The facts are clear to all who are willing to take an honest look: the <em>Zohar</em> contradicts a great many things which came before it in both the realm of <em>halakhah</em> and <em>hashqafah</em> - even surround such things as are \"off limits\" such as the nature of the <em>yihhudh HaShem</em>. And these things are well-known, they are not my invention nor the invention of secular scholars seeking to defame religion. They have been discussed and wrestled with for hundreds of years by rabbis and scholars in every area of Jewish literature. It has been proven that the Zohar borrows and incorporates sections of Rashi, <em>Tosafoth</em>, the Rambam, and other works which preceded it. It also contains a vast amount of original material, much of which is controversial when compared to works containing established <em>mesorah</em> from <em>Hazal</em>. This being the case, it is true that there are genuinely positive statements and spiritual truths expressed in the <em>Zohar</em>, however it is also true that there are severe statements of polytheism and dualism expressed there as well. So, the operating principle (it seems) is that anything good in the <em>Zohar</em> may already be found in uncontested and authentic works that preceded it, and anything questionable is of it's own invention. Such an observation makes the <em>Zohar</em> superfluous and the attempt to incorporate it into the corpus of Jewish literature as being more trouble that it is worth. The continuous heretical movements which base themselves upon it (e.g. the Shabbateans) and the seemingly endless stream of charlatans offering miracle cures, instant wealth, and superpowers of protection to those who embrace the Zoharic qabbalistic system are a proof that giving <em>Zohar</em> a prime place in Judaism has proven almost disastrous. The fact is that much of the good brought by <em>hasidism</em> could have been brought without the aid of Zoharic literature.</p>\n\n<p>The historical Jewish response to the <em>Zohar</em> can be divided into three basic approaches:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Full acceptance</strong> - The full acceptance of the <em>Zohar</em> and its attendant literature as being 100% authentic is most aptly characterized by the Hasidic movement(s) and the North African <em>Sefaradim</em>. These adherents hold it as the holiest text in Judaism and should be used to \"correct\" all other texts - especially those which came before it - which are viewed as being \"ignorant\" or \"unaware\" of the secret tradition that it holds.</li>\n<li><strong>Modified acceptance</strong> - This approach, most commonly associated with the Gr\"a and his <em>talmidhim</em>, is to effectively accept the Zohar, but to reject its commentaries. In other words, the Gr\"a took great liberties to \"re-read\" the text of the <em>Zohar</em> in order to make it fit into the established <em>mesorah</em>. By doing so, he rejected many of the ideas of Lurianic <em>qabbalah</em>, and sought new readings (many of which are either based on his own emendations of the text or forced readings of the plain meaning of the Aramaic) to remove conflict and controversy. However, in doing so, the Gr\"a also \"re-reads\" the text of the <em>gemara</em> in certain places and in some cases reverses generations of clear and uncontested <em>pesaq halakhah</em> from the <em>gemara</em> to accommodate the clear ruling of the <em>Zohar</em> to the contrary (one example of this is the wearing of <em>tefillin</em> on <em>Hholo shel mo'edh</em>). </li>\n<li><strong>Full rejection</strong> - Characterized most aptly by the 19th-century <em>Dor De'ah</em> movement in Yemen led by Rav Yihhyah Qafihh z\"l. Rav Qafihh authored a book entitled <em>Milhhamoth HaShem</em> (\"The Wars of HaShem\") wherein he effectively demonstrates (like other <em>hakhamim</em> before him) that the Zohar simply cannot be a product of <em>Hazal</em> and their students, is subsequently not an authentic work of <em>mesorah</em>, and therefore must be rejected. This and other groups rely instead on the works of previous and established authors for spirituality, such as the Rambam (<em>Moreh HaNevokhim</em>), Rabbi Yehudhah HaLewi (<em>Kuzari</em>), Rabbi Bahhyah ibn Pequdha (<em>Hhovoth HaLevavoth</em>), Sa'adyah Gaon (<em>Pirush 'al Sefer HaYessirah</em> and <em>HaNivhhar Emunoth Wa-De'oth</em>), and others.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We have a principle of \"<em>lo ba-shamayim hi</em>\", i.e. that the Torah is not \"in heaven\" and therefore we do not base our belief in any certain book or teacher based on purported \"miracles\" or claims of special \"revelation\" or \"prophecy.\" Instead, we are charged with being faithful to the texts and the <em>mesorah</em> that we have to judge all that comes after it. This is why the latter two approaches (i.e. any approach beyond blind acceptance) take measures to study the relevant sources in order to formulate their opinions, rather than seeking a sign or relying on the fact that the likes of the Arizal gave it their approbation.</p>\n\n<p>To answer your question directly, the <em>Zohar</em> has been accepted - and continues to be so - based on \"mob rule\" so to speak. In other words, since it has been read and used by a lot of Jews for a long time, we assume that it is true. In reality, however, there is no basis for its acceptance, but rather to the contrary. And as has been shown, there is nothing on the part of its supporters to substantiate their claims other than dogmas and the attribution of \"special powers\" or \"revelations\" or mystical \"prophecy\" on the part of those famed historical figures who did accept it, while attributing error and arrogance to those scholars who argued against it. It is exactly as you said, it is no different than the many false religious movements that have arisen in world history; they begin with charismatic and bold claims based essentially on nothing and demand blind obedience from all with whom they speak. But in the end, their claims are empty and their reasoning is circular. </p>\n\n<p>Have you ever wondered why those who merely question the authenticity of the <em>Zohar</em> are threatened with excommunication and charges of heresy, while those who propose that a section of the <em>gemara</em> should be emended (and other such normal acts of Torah scholarship) are met with none of these? <em>Le-`aniyuth Da'ati</em>, it seems that those without truly substantive arguments have nothing left but threats of Divine judgment and <em>ad hominem</em> attacks. Sound familiar?</p>\n\n<p>And <strong>PLEASE</strong> do not take my word for it - go and see for yourself. Investigate the matter thoroughly and with an open mind. If you come thereby to another conclusion, then you will have no threats and suffer no humiliation from me. And I certainly will not threaten you with a charge of \"arrogance\" for not seeing things the way that this or that scholar has.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that this helps. Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Another point mentioned by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan <a href=\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/faqs/Kaplan-SimpleToRemember.com.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Around three years ago, someone came to me and\n  asked me to translate parts of a manuscript of Rabbi\n  Yitzchok deMin Acco, known as Otzar HaChaim. There is\n  only one complete copy of this manuscript in the world, and\n  this is in the Guenzberg Collection in the Lenin Library in\n  Moscow. This person got me a complete photocopy of the\n  manuscript and asked me to translate certain sections. I\n  stated that the only condition I would translate the\n  manuscript is if I get to keep the copy. This is how I got my\n  hands on this very rare and important manuscript.</p>\n  \n  <p>Of course, like every other sefer in my house, it had to be read. It\n  took a while to decipher the handwriting, since it is an ancient\n  script. One of the first things I discovered was that it was written\n  some 20 years after Rabbi Yitzchok investigated the Zohar. He openly,\n  and clearly and unambiguously states that the Zohar was written by\n  Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. This is something not known to historians,\n  and this is the first time I am discussing it in a public forum. But\n  the fact is that the one person who is historically known to have\n  investigated the authenticity of the Zohar at the time it was first\n  published, unambiguously came to the conclusion that it  was an\n  ancient work written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He writes in the footnote</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One can view this manuscript today on micro film at YU or Brandeis\n  University\n  (<a href=\"http://library.brandeis.edu/specialcollections/collections/mancoll3.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://library.brandeis.edu/specialcollections/collections/mancoll3.html</a>). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However the link no longer works.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>See Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's Inner Space chapter 1 (through page 7) along with footnotes. His basic argument is that all of Jewish mysticism (works like Sefer Yetzeira, Bahir, Heichalot material, Zohar, etc.) were transmitted to Moshe at Sinai and were orally transmitted after that. Throughout the time of prophecy this knowledge was guarded and only really accessible to those who had attained prophecy (note: as indicated in Tanach, there were schools of prophecy and there were many thousands who achieved this spiritual level, only prophecy which was relevant to all generations was recorded for posterity). After the destruction of the temple and the cessation of prophecy these oral traditions were in danger of being forgotten. Various \"schools\" coalesced around spiritual giants such as Rabbi Akiva (who transmitted the secrets of the Merkava) and Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai who transmitted (orally) the main material of the Zohar. These transmissions were an amalgamation of oral tradition and divine or semi-prophetic revelation (via the prophet Elijah). Over time in order that this wisdom not be forgotten students began to write it down. The compilation of several such works became canonized as the Zohar. </p>\n\n<p>He also refers to Rabbi David Luria's Kadmut Sefer HaZohar 5:2. In footnote 30 he states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...In the case of Rabbi Shimon's school, the Zohar consisted of volumes of notes in manuscript form which were hidden away in a vault and not uncovered until the 13th century. After limited circulation in the 1270's and 1280's, these notes came into the hands of R. Moshe de Leon (1238-1305) who finally edited and published them in the 1290's...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, to answer your question in short, the material in question was not deemed appropriate for public consumption and was therefore transmitted orally to only select individuals for many hundreds of years (Judaism is not the only example of this type of secret oral transmission). It was finally gathered and published at the end of the 13th century but certainly didn't simply pop up out of nowhere. If it had (I'm editorializing here, Rabbi Kaplan does not say this) I cannot imagine it gaining such immediate and widespread acceptance.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# This is on the RamBam isurei biah Chapter 15 - Halacha 25...Asufi of possible Gentile lineage?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is stated in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=5&hilchos=27&perek=15&halocha=25\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Isurei Biah - Chapter 15 - Halacha 25</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When an asufi is found in a city inhabited by gentiles, whether the majority are gentiles or the majority are Jews, the child is considered as gentile of indefinite status with regard to his lineage. If he consecrates a woman, she needs a bill of divorce because of the doubt. If someone kills him, he is not executed for doing so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My question is, if this person ended up marrying a Jewess of non-doubtful status, is the child a safek asufim? Is a safek asufim a sfake sfaka and permitted to marry into the kehila?</p>\n\n<p>And also in the related Gemara (final perek Kiddushin), it lists several indications where the asufi would be considered kosher (i.e., if he had milah already, etc.). If someone had a relative three or four generations removed and such details have been obscured, would this also be a sfake sfaka?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The first question is pretty easy -- Jewish status is entirely matrilineal. Mom's Jewish? Child is Jewish. Mom's not? Neither is the kid. So if mom is an <em>asufi</em>, the same would apply to her children. Makes no difference who the dad is. (There's only one safek here -- is mom Jewish or not. The safek about dad is irrelevant.)</p>\n\n<p>Second question: you mean something like -- \"I know my mother's mother's mother was picked up off the streets, but I don't know whether she had Jewish identfying marks?\" Not good enough. That's a <em>safek bedavar echad.</em> The only doubt here is \"was great-grandma Jewish?\" Identifying signs can help <em>resolve</em> that doubt. But there's only one doubt here.</p>\n\n<p>Try spelling it out as a <em>sfek sfeka</em>, and you'll see where it falls apart. \"Maybe she was Jewish, maybe she wasn't. And even if she wasn't Jewish .... maybe she had Jewish identifying signs?\"</p>\n\n<p>So if someone's mother's mother's status was we-can't-tell-if-she's-Jewish, then the same would apply to that person. </p>\n\n<p>(Practically, a smart rabbi is going to recommend a just-in-case conversion at some point here.)</p>\n\n\n",

Whether or not the grace period is usable lichatchila or bidieved you are for sure responsible for the bike and would be considered renter of the bike. This would be similar to using your phone for a short while not on break at work that is not stealing as the company calculates that in.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Let's start with Bava Metzia, ona'ah. This is interest on a loan, and verbal abuse. </p>\n\n<p>Judaism generally deals with days, from my personal experience. There wasn't such a developed time system - before this position of the sun try to do this and definitely before the sun sets do this. Jewish Standard Time, Indian Standard Time, Irish Standard Time, and all the social conventions which allow us to maintain this relaxed human perspective that comes from 15 or so minutes grace period are so important with the introduction of accurate clocks.</p>\n\n<p>When you rent something, you become responsible for it. For its damage, for its care - if its living you feed it, if it you still protect it. If you pay for the use of said property, there is a different level of responsibility. </p>\n\n<p>We are now in the three weeks, and we are supposed to remember the destruction of the temple. Some of the explanations for its destruction are baseless hatred and not saying a bracha on learning Torah. One of the primary means of expressing baseless hatred is lashon hara, slander - but it also is encompassed by ona'ah - walking into a store with the intent not to buy anything, repeating a mistake verbally that another did. </p>\n\n<p>Our words are very important. When you make an arrangement verbally with another, your words have to mean that you will fulfill them - you are probably wearing a kippah, and even if you aren't they can tell you're Jewish. Will G-d's name be slandered because you didn't keep to your arrangement? You agreed on a time, and then intended before the words left your lips not to keep to your words!!!</p>\n\n<p>Yet Hashem himself is willing to erase his name in order to keep a marriage together. How could it be that your bike lender would be so upset over a few minutes unless he really needed the bike? </p>\n\n<p>That is why I think our clocks, while important, shouldn't be the only ones dictating time. They are merely a tool in our houses for making sure we don't waste the time we were given.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your question is based on the assumption that the grace period given is only given  to be used when it cant be avoided because of some unforeseen reason, \"beshaas dochek\". However the industry has most certainly included the idea that the grace period will be used a certain percentage of times. As such they lechatchila build into their pricing or their cost of doing business, so there is strong reason that it a case is zeh nehene vezeh lo chasar. \nAnother answer is that it is muttar and i bleieve lechatchhila to be mafikia a chov owend to a non jew (public corporations included). Which means that unless the non jew is tovaya the yid to din and wins the case, one has no obligation or chov to the non jew. So even if there was klapai shmaya a chov on the renter because they intentionally used the grace period, they would not be mechuyav anything unless the rental car company was tovaya them to din and won the case before that there is no chiyuv.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# A good beginner study Talmud for a student\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am looking to begin studying the Talmud. I have grown up a reform Jew and know most of the basic principles of Judaism, but I am looking to go deeper into the religion, ultimately with the goal of becoming a more religious person.</p>\n\n<p>I am a high school student so I cannot attend any of the local classes at Synagogue (they are all during school), so I am looking for a Talmud with concurrent translations (I have a very rudimentary knowledge of Hebrew) that also would have some sort of explanation of the commentary (commentary on the commentary? :P), and preferably one meant for young adults. I don't really know what I mean by that, but perhaps something that puts the commentary of the Rabbis into context for people around the age of 18.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any suggestions for such a book?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As Noach mi Frankfurt said in a comment, there are four English translations: Soncino, Neusner, Artscroll, and Koren/Steinsaltz, and  Kfir Shlomo noted a fifth edited by A. Zvi Ehrman.  I've worked with three of them; I don't know Neusner or Ehrman.  Based on my experience, for a beginner I recommend the Koren/Steinsaltz, <em>accompanied by</em> a study partner or, at the very least, an introduction to talmud.  None of these translations are particularly aimed for young adults, though; you will encounter unfamiliar words, concepts, and styles of reasoning.  (That's why the study partner and the introductory text are important.)</p>\n\n<p>The Koren edition is nearly complete now, a new volume every couple months to keep up with the <em>daf yomi</em>.  Here's an Amazon link to the first volume, <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/965301563X\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B'rachot</a>.  This edition has extensive notes; they're not targeted for young adults and you may find some of the concepts a little difficult, but with talmud you just have to dive in.  The Koren/Steinsaltz edition, unlike the others, does not use a facing-page layout where you can easily see the original text alongside the translation; for a more-advanced student this is an impediment but, based on my experience when I was just starting, I don't think you'll mind this.</p>\n\n<p>Talmud is hard to do on your own, especially as a beginner, so if you can get yourself a <em>chevruta</em> (a study partner), please do.  When I wanted to start learning some years ago I asked my rabbi if he could match me up with another member of the congregation; if you belong to a congregation, try that.</p>\n\n<p>If you are going to study alone, and perhaps even if you will study with a partner, I also recommend first reading a book about the talmud and how it works to help orient you.  One such book is <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B003S9VNJM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Essential Talmud by Rabbi Steinsaltz</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I also come from a Reform background and am not fluent in Aramaic and Hebrew (working on it, ever so slowly).  I've studied from Artscroll with a rabbi (who could alert me to the liberties they sometimes take as we encountered them), I use the Soncino translation to try to follow along, sporadically, with the daf yomi (because I have a digital copy of the whole thing), and I'm slowly adding the Koren/Steinsaltz volumes to my personal library and exploring them as they come in.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Beyond the \"classic\" Steinsaltz/Artscroll translations, one book worth considering is Dr. Henry Abramson's Reading the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8saNlAfXI0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">video introduction by the author</a>, digital version <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291947380_Reading_the_Talmud_Developing_Independence_in_Gemara_Learning\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/book/194040380/Reading-the-Talmud-Developing-Independence-in-Gemara-Learning\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>It takes one chapter of <em>gemara</em> (Baba Metzia's Perek HaMafkid) and, over 43 chapters/<em>shiurim</em>, breaks down the text in small parts, provides a small introduction, the original text, a vocabulary for every word of the <em>gemara</em> and Rashi and a list of questions to allow you to check your understanding of that part. It is the closest you can get in book form from learning a chapter with a Rav.</p>\n\n\n",

And He\n  said: 'Nay; but thou didst laugh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apparently, Sarah laughed because she didn't believe that G-d would create a miracle to let her give birth at such an old age. Some questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Apparently, G-d asks Avraham, why did Sarah laugh. The question is\naddressed to Avraham, but he doesn't answer. Why not?</p></li>\n<li><p>If the question was asked to Avraham, how does Sarah know the\nconversation. Was she eavesdropping?</p></li>\n<li><p>If Sarah did hear the question, and she understands that G-d is\n\"angry\" with her laughing, why does she deny and, essentially lie to\nG-d that she didn't laugh?</p></li>\n<li><p>It says, \"because she was afraid\" ... afraid of what?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To me, the conversation seems somewhat \"childish\" - Like a parent asking a child, \"Why did you do this\", and the kid says, \"No I didn't\", and the parent answers, \"yes, you did!\" What is the Torah trying to tell us by including this whole back-and-forth conversation? Is it so important that we know that Sarah had a lapse of faith and then, denied that she did? What message is the Torah trying to teach us?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>To answer the last two questions:</p>\n\n<p>The Ohr HaChaim explains that Sarah's denial was actually a manifestation of a certain degree of righteousness.  When a servant who has genuine awe of his master does something inappropriate towards his master, his intense awe of the master makes him unable to confess.  This is what the verse means that she was afraid, she had awe of Hashem and therefore was unable to bring herself to confess.  (The Ohr HaChaim explains that she did not outright lie, and this is why the verse says \"she denied, saying...\" and not just \"she said...\", because she didn't actually say it.  She somehow implied it in such a way that it conveyed that she wanted to deny it but also that she really acknowledged that she did it.  He doesn't give specifics of how she conveyed this.)</p>\n\n<p>Avraham then corrected her by telling her that it was more appropriate to confess outright, as Hashem desires our confession and teshuva.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>No biblical characters were ever perfect, not even the most righteous ones. Their standards were a lot higher than ours but they were not perfect.</p>\n\n<p>Sarah's denial was obviously a fact that she did recognise that G-d could do miracles and it was not beyond G-d to give Sarah a child.</p>\n\n<p>Abraham also laughed at the end of last week's sedra. The name Yitzchak means laughter. You might ask why G-d told them to call their son by that name, but it seems to link the name into the story which is perhaps why there is a fair bit of emphasis about the laughter.</p>\n\n\n",

(I'm not sure how <em>beis din</em> or whoever would know about the person's thought, but I'm asking anyways).</p>\n\n<p>1b) (a bit of a nuanced question) If the answer to 1a is no: is that because the Torah essentially does not allow for it or is it a pragmatic issue (e.g. not knowing or being able to prove that a person had a certain thought) but  would that it were that we could get around the pragmatic issues a <em>beis din</em> would punish?</p>\n\n<p>2) Can a person be punished by God (<em>be'yedei shamayim</em>) for a thought the person had even (if no action was performed)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><code>1a)</code> See the Rambam <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_02038.html#HtmpReportNum0017_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">הלכות סנהדרין והעונשין המסורים להם - פרק שמונה עשר</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ב</strong>: כָּל לָאו שֶׁאֵין בּוֹ מַעֲשֶׂה אֵין לוֹקִין עָלָיו חוּץ מִנִּשְׁבָּע וּמֵימֵר וּמְקַלֵּל אֶת חֲבֵרוֹ בְּשֵׁם. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Bet Din would not punish for <em>non-actions</em></strong>  with the exception of [false]-oaths, persuading others to transgress and cursing.</p>\n\n<p>So Bet Din would not punish you for your [evil] thoughts - even if all other requirements for punishment were met.</p>\n\n<p>(The first two exceptions obviously require actual talking, and cursing requires one to <strong>say</strong> the name of G-d.)</p>\n\n<p><code>1b)</code> This is a general rule - not related to <em>not being able to prove it</em> - since <em>talking</em> is considered a <em>non-action</em>, yet is easily proven.</p>\n\n<p><code>2)</code> We learn in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01324.html#HtmpReportNum0075_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kidushin 39b</a> that for thoughts one does not get punished - with the exception of idolatrious thoughts.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודלמא מהרהר בעבירה הוה? מחשבה רעה אין הקב''ה מצרפה למעשה! ודלמא מהרהר בעבודת כוכבים הוה <em>וכתיב {יחזקאל יד-ה} למען תפוש את בית ישראל בלבם</em>? איהו נמי הכי קאמר... ‏ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I don't know if this is what you're looking for, but not knowing the motivation of your question, maybe this will be helpful to you.  It isn't being punished <em>directly</em> for the thought, but a person could be punished as the result of a thought:</p>\n\n<p>The Tiferes Yisroel commentary to Keilim 25:9 writes that both Rashi (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=41b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kiddushin 41b</a>) and the Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/8718.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchos Pesulei Hamukdashim 18:1</a>) hold that the prohibition of pigul is violated through thought without speech.  So if a person had thoughts of eating a Korban outside of the proper time or place, it then becomes pigul.  If they then ate that Korban, in the right time and place, they would get malkus for eating pigul (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=25&daf=13&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Makkos 13a</a>).  This would be as a result of their thought.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, the gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=29&daf=29b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zevachim 29b</a> says that according to Rebbi Yehuda, who holds that לאו שאין בו מעשה לוקין עליו (you can get lashes for prohibitions that do not involve an action)(<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=26&daf=3b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sh'vuos 3b</a>), you can get lashes just for the <em>thought</em> of eating the Korban in the wrong time or place. So according to this opinion, you could get a Beis Din punishment <em>directly</em> for a thought.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Apple Watch on Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Tech experts: Is there any way in which the Apple Watch could be used by shomrei Shabbat with limited functionality?</p>\n\n<p>Note: this question does not seek to ascertain whether the full gamut of features could be used on Shabbat (they can't as far as I'm aware), it seeks to ascertain whether it is at all possible to use this device, pending its release, on days when electricity is proscribed.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Apple’s default alarm behavior on iOS is to have the alarm go off indefinitely, so if one wants to use the iPhone or iPad alarm on Shabbat, one has to use a third-party app <a href=\"https://www.rustybrick.com/iphone-shabbos-clock.php\">like this one</a> that shuts the alarm off by itself. The only other thing I can think of to do with an iOS device on Shabbat is play media (like music) on a playlist, which would of course have to start before Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>You could theoretically also play media that way from the watch. We don’t know what third-party developers will be able to do yet, but it may be possible to make a Shabbat timer that works the same way. (<strong>Update:</strong> It looks as though full-fledged apps like the ones you’d need to write to make a Shabbat timer <a href=\"http://david-smith.org/blog/2014/11/06/expectations-for-watchkit/\">won’t be possible</a> until the second version of WatchKit.)</p>\n\n<p>You wouldn’t be able to wear the watch on Shabbat under normal circumstances because the screen sleeps until you lift the watch to look at it, which causes it to light up. Since the device is unreleased, we don't actually know if it's possible to keep the display from sleeping. Assuming it’s possible, though, the first-generation watch is almost certainly not going to make it through Shabbat with the screen on. Apple has indicated that the battery life will only last through one day of normal use, and that’s with the screen off at all times except when the user is looking at it.</p>\n\n\n",

See Shulchan Aruch 21:6 and Aruch Hashulchan on that chapter; also see the last Ritva in Kiddushin (82a) who is quoted in Aruch Hashulchan. See Rabbi Nissim Karelitz in Chut Shani on Even Haezer Chapter 21:6, Note 16 on pg. 59 and in other places in that work (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/48274\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hebrewbooks.org/48274</a>). Also, the beginning of Mishna Avot (Mishna 5) says not to excessively chat with women because it ruins your life in many ways.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting discussion for the Jewish sociologists: <a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/saying-good-shabbos-to-girls-men/page/4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/saying-good-shabbos-to-girls-men/page/4</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In a strict halachic sense, the main issue, as Rashi on that gemarah in Kiddushin says about talking to a woman (definitely to who is an erva and maybe even one who isn’t) is the creation of closeness between a man and woman (and is quoted by Aruch Hashulchan). This may possibly be because of the bad thoughts that accompany it and/or the possibility of it leading to worse sins. Nonetheless, having derech eretz is the first priority (as I heard from a Rav in the name of R Yaakov Kamenetsky and as is stated in Aruch Hashulchan and in Ben Yehoyada), so saying 'hi' or 'how are you' in America (or the equivalent greetings in other cultures) is usually allowed. The application of how you should converse will differ depending on the social circumstances: Many Hassidic and Yeshivish people don’t talk to the other gender at all (even the work place has very limited talk), some religious circles don’t refer to women by their first name, other religious Jews are more lenient for derech eretz reasons to say hi or shalom but try to avoid excessive closeness (Chut Shani is strict with saying shalom because it probably creates closeness), other religious Jews have friends from the opposite gender (which seems to be halachicly incorrect, unless there are unique practical reasons for the friendship other than desire); Western secular societies have no such boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>Based on Rashi's definition (and reasons of maintaining peace and derech eretz, making a living, and accomplishing essential life needs), it seems that practical relationships like mitzvah, business, shidduch related, and familial relationships are permitted, yet should be kept under control (i.e., avoid excessive chatter and levity), and should not go against the accepted custom of the community you live in.</p>\n\n<p>There is a defense for Jews who are lenient with having platonic relationships with non-married (or non-erva) women, based on what R Moshe Feinstein (Book 9: Even Haezer 5 Letter 16) told his son R Reuven--that the prohibition in the Talmud (of sh'eilat shalom) may only be by married women and not by non-married women (see Meiri ibid.). Practically he rules to be strict in general, especially considering that most young women are a Niddah. He also rules in another letter (Even Haezer 4 Letter 60), that it is forbidden to have platonic relationships because of the sins it leads to, and does not believe that “halachic” platonic relationships really work (<a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/22288885/R-Moshe-Feinstein-on-Platonic-Relationships\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.scribd.com/doc/22288885/R-Moshe-Feinstein-on-Platonic-Relationships</a>). I am merely defending the practice (but not endorsing it) based on his idea. Anyway, I don't see the need for having this type of relationship if it is not used to accomplish practical and permissible goals.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if a man has issues dealing with thoughts, I would advise him to avoid talking to women unless needed for derech eretz, business, or other essential needs, and should try to get to the bottom of why he is plagued by thoughts when around women, so he can deal with them in a healthy manner.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Here is some info.

G-d says \"it's not good for the human to be alone.\" So the very first source we have on marriage isn't about procreation, it's about emotional support. </p>\n\n<p>Now the humans are told to \"be fruitful and multiply\", so procreation is important. Some rabbis have said that getting married <em>per se</em> is an obligation because it's the only legal way to procreate, but that doesn't mean that's the sole purpose of marriage! The Talmud makes it clear that if someone already had children and is now widowed or divorced, in theory his rabbi should step in and tell him \"it's not good for the human to be alone\", he should look to remarry. If having more kids is an option that's even better, as we value procreation, but that's not required. Clearly, procreation isn't everything.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible also says that if one takes a second wife, he needs to ensure that he doesn't reduce the <em>onah</em> -- \"physical and emotional attention\" -- he's giving his first wife. Nothing about procreation. Similarly the Talmud says a husband is obligated to pay extra attention to the physical and emotional needs of his pregnant wife. Again, nothing to do with procreation.</p>\n\n<p>Oddly, there were members of the Ger hassidic movement that would practice abstinence after they had \"enough\" children (where \"enough\", given the disease rate in Eastern Europe 150 years ago, was about ten); but that basically flies in the face of everything above.</p>\n\n<p><em>So.</em> An odd form of asceticism made its way into our tradition at some point, which said things like \"you're not allowed to enjoy it, it can only be about your wife; or procreation; or just getting it over with, shame on you, so you can stay out of trouble and focus on something else. View it like paying the bills.\" But that's not the prevailing view you'd see in the Talmud; that's not how it's described in the Code of Jewish Law in the laws of marriage; that's not how the Aruch HaShulchan (early 1900s) describes it when he modifies the ascetic description (he writes it should \"<em>also</em>\" be intended for loftier purposes). It's not the advice you'll hear from virtually all centrist rabbis today.

He gives the example of marital relations, which he says are not meant to be for pleasure but rather for the mitzvah, and therefore even when it is for pleasure it would be inappropriate to establish a blessing for it as that would imply condoning the involvement for the sake of pleasure.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, involvement for pleasure is inappropriate to the point that they did not institute a blessing when they otherwise would have lest it lead people to think it is OK to be involved in relations for the sake of pleasure.</p>\n\n\n",

Not just concerning Avraham, but by many of the situations mentioned in 'Mi Sh'ana', we never find the people mentioned actually praying or asking anything of Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>The answer I've told myself is based on an Or HaChaim in Shmos chapter 2 vs 23-24. The Torah tells us that the cries of the Jews from their work went up to Hashem And Hashem heard their cries. The Or HaChaim explains 'it was not the case that they prayed to Hashem to save them,but they cried from the pain like a person crying from his pain. And the Torah tells us that this crying went up before Hashem etc'. </p>\n\n<p>It seems that Hashem is able to equate a person's cries of pain to a prayer when He sees fit. Now, although we don't find Avraham or any of the others in Mi Sh'ana actually crying out, the fact of the matter is they would have liked the situation to be different, otherwise this would not be a test. Hashem's intervention is called a  response, even if there was no actual prayer.</p>\n\n<p>I am aware Rashi in vs 6 says Avraham went with desire and happiness to slaughter his son, but this was a description of his actions And convictions based on Hashem's command, not what he personally would have chosen to be. Otherwise it would not have been a test as I mentioned before.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Jerusalem was only destroyed because of these 8 things - how?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.119b\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masechet Shabbat 119b</a>, it brings 8 statements saying \"<em>Jerusalem was only destroyed because x</em>\". Each time, <em>x</em> changes.</p>\n\n<p>How can it say that Jerusalem was <strong>only</strong> destroyed for one particular thing - 8 times?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The eight statements are from eight different sages.  Presumably, as in other places where the g'mara says \"A says X, B says Y, etc\", they are disagreeing with each other.  Sometimes when there are multiple opinions the g'mara reconciles them (A was talking about this specific case where X applies, B was talking about this other case where Y applies, they don't disagree), but here the g'mara doesn't do that.  So we are left with eight options.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, and this is my own idea, the last of these eight statements (from Raba) says that Jerusalem was destroyed only because men of faith ceased therein.  Men of faith ceasing therein would <em>cause</em> the issues raised by the other seven -- desecrating Shabbat, neglecting education of children (by which surely they mean education in torah), not rebuking, despising scholars, and so forth.  So each of the first seven identifies an aspect of the problem but its \"only\" is too narrow, and Raba's \"only\" covers all the rest too.</p>\n\n\n",

Just as he followed Hashem's command to bring Yitzchak to the Akeidah, he realized that, just as Yitzchak had been placed in his hands for be raised to the level of kedushah (which also prevented him from leaving Eretz Yisrael), so too  was he responsible now for following through on providing the wife that would be worthy of the bracha and inheritence.

He actually raised Rivkah (especially according to the commentary that she was three years old at the time).</p>\n\n<p>Yitzchak could not go himself and (apparently) did not have an Eliezer to send. Note that he sent Yaakov specifically to Lavan to marry into the family. Also note the meforshin on Leah having \"tender\" eyes.

In fact, this arrangement may have been set up by Avraham as well.</p>\n\n<p>Had Esav fulfilled his father's expectationsa that is being Yaakov's partner, like Yissachar and Zevulun, that would ha been the course of events.

Reb Moshe says that it is a nice stringency to keep, but one is not obligated to be stringent, especially since most people are not stringent. As opposed to the need to wear a head covering while sitting around which is also a stringency according to the shulchan aruch, that is a stringency one must keep being that everyone does it. And especially in light of the ruling of the Taz who says starting from his times being bareheaded falls under the prohibition of walking in the paths of the nonjews. And of course wearing a head covering while walking 4 amos or saying Hashem's name or walking into a beis harnesses which requires a headcovering by law.</p>\n\n<p>But the point I'm tying to bring out is covering a majority of one's head is a nice stringency but not binding, hence the various types of kipot and yarmulkas.</p>\n\n\n",

But by the akeida, there was no such message, because he was the key player involved and there was no reason he shouldn't have been told.</p>\n\n<p>On another note, someone once pointed out to me that in Selichos, one of the aneinus is addressed to \"He Who answered Avraham on Har HaMoriah\" - the only time we know of that Avraham went to Har HaMoriah was for the Akeida, and a teacher of mine suggested that he was being answered on a request to spare Yitzchok.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>My rav explained: (IY\"H, when I see him next week, I will ask him where he got this source, and edit it.) For now, the explanation sounds credible. Sorry - I don't want to reveal his name...</p>\n\n<p>Child sacrifice was common and customary at that time. Therefore, Avraham did not protest the request. Yes, Avraham probably was pained that he would have to sacrifice his own son, but, as he was devoted to G-d's commandment, he surmised that since this was something that everyone else did, it wasn't unusual of G-d to request this of him.</p>\n\n<p>As a matter of fact, this was part of the \"test\". Hashem tells him at the end, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14020&st=&pgnum=269&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breishit 22:12</a> , \"NOW I know that you are a G-d fearing person...\". Didn't G-d (the angel) know all this before? But, it was to prove that BECAUSE Avraham was G-d fearing, this was the reason that Avraham sacrificed his son, and not because everyone else did it and he was following local custom. In other words, by doing so, Avraham made clear to everyone in the future that Jews DON'T sacrifice their children.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps the answer is gleaned from this take on the Akeda, which is from a drasha I wrote for Parashat Vayera 5785:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The test of the Akeda is something that the Torah gives to his credit,\nbut it is we who are baffled, and wonder how Avraham could have done\nit. Sacrificing one’s child is of course the issue, and is something\nwe see as barbaric and horrible today. We would at least expect\nAvraham to protest, and do so reluctantly, yet we find that he did it\nwith out any hesitation, and with joy. This gives him a bad name\nsometimes, chas veshalom, especially among more secular people. What\ncan we say to defend him?</p>\n<p>As many commentaries point out, one must try to get into the mindset\nof the times, and turns out it is not that hard. At the time, it was a\ncommon belief that one should sacrifice their child, and it was\nconsidered as a moral thing to do. Back then, people believed that the\nultimate kindness one can do for their child is ensure they have a\nsuccessful afterlife in the highest of heavens. The priests and\nshamans of the time would indeed teach that this would happen for\nchildren who were sacrificed properly to the right god in the right\nway. Therefore there was tremendous peer pressure on parents to go\nwith the moral of the time, and go ahead with it. We see something\nsimilar even today, with parents, due to secular ideology and morality\nin our zeitgeist, are being pressured to do things that we would\nconsider wrong, to their children. They really do believe that they\nare doing the right thing, and are very scared to be cancelled or\ncalled horrible parents for not doing it. It is indeed a tremendous\nchallenge.</p>\n<p>Avraham would always speak against this. His message was effectively:\nyou are wrong! This is not good for your child! It does not send him\nstraight to the highest of heavens, and even if it did, that is not\nwhat Hashem wants. He wants us to live a full life down here, and\nnever kill each other. We earn our Olam Haba through performing\nMitzvot down here on earth, and you are ruining it for your child, as\nwell as committing a terrible sin!</p>\n<p>He was ridiculed and laughed at for this, and accused of being\nimmoral. Peer pressure, and society can be a very great test, as we\nsee even today.</p>\n<p>So when Hashem came to Avraham and told him to sacrifice Yitzchak, the\nchallenge wasn’t just about losing Yitzchak. Actually, the big\nchallenge was, was Avraham wrong? What about his life’s work? His\nreputation? Can you imagine Hashem coming and asking you to transition\nyour kid into a korban? How is it going to be possible to continue\ntelling people not to do this, if he himself has done it? He was of\ncourse sad about losing Yitzchak, and tested to see if he would doubt\nHashem’s brachas, yes.</p>\n<p>But we now can understand that he wasn’t a monster, who didn’t care\nabout his child. In fact, the opposite, on the inside he was thinking\n“wow, Yitzchak really is going to go to the highest of heavens, what a\nprivilege!” Indeed the Alshich on his commentary on the Akeda\ndescribes that Moriah was the link point between heaven and earth, and\nthe mizbe’ach that Avraham built was positioned right under the\nheavenly mizbe’ach, and indeed Yitzchak’s Neshama was going to be\noffered directly to Hashem Himself. The Chida explains in detail the\nbenefit Yitzchak would get out of this.</p>\n<p>So, the test wasn’t a test of love, and Avraham wasn’t a terrible\nparent. He was the greatest of all parents because he actually did\nspeak to Hashem, and had every reason to believe that Yitzchak was\ngoing to gain a tremendous amount from this test (see Or Hachaim);\nindeed for Yitzchak, it wasn’t even considered a test for this reason.</p>\n<p>So, Avraham’s main worry was whether he would be able to continue his\nmission in life, according to Rabbeinu Bachaya, Saadia Gaon, to teach\npeople about Hashem, and educate them about Hashem’s Will, which was\nagainst Avodah Zara, and child sacrifice. In the end, Avraham going to\ndo the Akeda, and then being told “No” by Hashem, was the best way to\nconvey the message that Hashem doesn’t want child sacrifices. It\nreached far and wide and now everyone knew that Avraham was being\nhonest.</p>\n<p>So, turns out, whenever we look a little bit deeper at the events in\nthe Torah, even the negative ones, we find tremendous depth and\ninsight into the gadlut of the Kadmonim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Avraham didn't protest because this action was not perceived as a \"punishment\" in the zeitgeist of the times. It was seen as a wonderful opportunity for Yitzchak to go straight to the highest heavens and greatest Olam Haba. The test was actually that Avraham thoguht Hashem didn't want that, as he had been trying to convince others his whole life.

    "title": "Can a court declare a minor's lulav ownerless? Has one?",
    "content": "# Can a court declare a minor's lulav ownerless? Has one?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Orach Chayim</em> 658:6, says that one should not give his <em>lulav</em> to a minor as a gift, as the minor cannot give it back to him. (Minors cannot give anyone legal ownership in anything.)</p>\n\n<p>According to some views outlined in the <em>Mishna B'rura</em> there (:28), this presents a problem on the first day of <em>Sukos</em>. After all, the adult cannot give the <em>lulav</em> to the minor, as he won't get it back. He cannot lend it to the minor, as (according to this view) such a loan would be useless: the minor will not accomplish anything by shaking a borrowed <em>lulav</em> on the first day. One solution is to make sure no adult (see <em>MB</em> :24) needs to use it any more that day, and then give it to the minor: it's his, then, for the rest of <em>Sukos</em>, but that's okay, as a borrowed <em>lulav</em> is valid after the first day, and the adult can borrow it from the minor.</p>\n\n<p>It seems, though, that there's another solution. There's a general rule of <em>hefker bes din hefker</em>: \"the ownerlessness of a court is ownerlessness\", meaning that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/17980\">a court</a> can declare anything ownerless. Indeed, there are instances (which I can't think of specifically at the moment) when this is done as a blanket rule: a court has decided that any possessions fitting certain criteria are ownerless, and that rule is in effect for years to come, applying to any possessions that eventually meet those criteria. It seems that a municipal court (<em>bes din</em>) can do the same here: issue a decree prior to <em>Sukos</em> that any <em>lulav</em> acquired by a minor on or before the first day of <em>Sukos</em> is ownerless as soon as the minor's done with it and the legator wants it back. (The wording would need to be better thought out, but that would be the general idea. And the legator would then acquire it from its ownerless state.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Has any court done this?</li>\n<li>Has any source discussed the utility or validity of this, or, indeed, anything else about it?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It is indeed a problem to \"give\" the lulav to a minor for the reasons you have stated.</p>\n\n<p>Lending somebody a lulav does indeed mean that they have not performed the mitzvah as they must own it. However as a minor does not perform mitzvot anyway and you only give the lulav to him for practice, you can \"lend\" him the lulav so he can learn to perform the mitzvah with it.</p>\n\n<p>You could of course buy him one of his own, assuming you can afford it. (They are not that expensive really).</p>\n\n<p>The issue here is the difference between ownership on a rabbinic level and d'oraysa and lulav ownership is d'oraysa.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>do kinyanei derabbanan have a chalos d'oraysa?\n  Does a kinyan derabbanan create a status of ownership on a d'oraysa level? This question is debated by the classical Achronim and comes into play on sukkos where the first day requires ownership of lulav and esrog to fulfill the requirement of \"lachem\". (We once discussed a proof of the Ketzos to resolve this question.) </p>\n  \n  <p>Perhaps this question is at the heart of the machlokes Rambam and Ran regarding the gemara's warning (Sukkah 46) not to give a lulav and esrog to a child on the first day of sukkos before fulfilling one's own mitzvah. The gemara explains that a child can be koneh the 4 minim, but cannot be makneh the items back. Ran writes that the gemara must be speaking only of a very young child, because the Chachamim made a takanah that slightly older children (p'eutos) can buy and sell things, otherwise sending a child to the grocery story to buy something would be impossible. The Rambam, however, does not draw any distinction. </p>\n  \n  <p>Apparently the Ran understood that the takanah empowering children to buy and sell is sufficient to allow them to be makneh the lulav back so its owner fulfills \"lachem\" on a d'oraysa level. The Rambam, however, did not think a kinyan derabbanan has any validity on a d'oraysa level.</p>\n  \n  <p>The problem with such an approach is that there seem to be many proofs that the Chachamim can through hefker beis din make takanos that have a chalos d'oraysa. A few sugyos in shas (e.g. Kesubos 3) refer to the ability of the Chachamim to annul a marriage by declaring the kesef kiddushin ownerless. Clearly the women effected by such a takanah is not merely no longer married on a derabbanan level!</p>\n  \n  <p>R' Shlomo Eiger's suggests (Shu\"t RAK\"E 221) that Chazal may be able to effect removal of ownership on a d'oraysa level, but cannot effect a transfer of ownership to a new party.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Telzers (both R' Shimon Shkop and R' Y. L. Bloch) reject this distinction. Hefker without the ability to transfer ownership is an incomplete hefker because it has no effect on anyone other than the original owner. (This question fits well with R' Shimon's rejection of the Ketzos' model of hefker that we discussed back here.) R' Yosef Leib concludes that even the Rambam accepts the idea that a takanah derabbanan can effect a chalos d'oraysa in monetary matters. Where the Rambam and Ran differ is regarding the scope of this rule. According to the Ran, once the cat is out of the bag and there exists a takanah to allow children to shop in a grocery store, the same takanah has a chalos d'oraysa with respect to lulav. The Rambam disagrees and argues that the chalos d'oraysa is limited in scope to the narrow context that motivated the takanah's original creation. (Very Telzerish sevara -- the \"sibah\" is the geder hadin.) In the case of kesef kiddushin, the marriage is annuled; in the case of minor's kinyanim, only with respect to shopping is there a chalos d'oraysa to the kinyan. However, consequences that are a byproduct of the original takanah, e.g. now the child who can go shopping can also return a lulav, are not included in the scope of the chalos d'oraysa.</p>\n  \n  <p>R' Bloch and R' Shimon's point relates more globally to how dinim derabbanan function. As opposed to dinim d'oraysa that say something inherent and intrinsic about a person or an object, dinim derabbanan just serve a functional need, but do not change the legal status or nature of things. This is a powerful sevara that explains many other ideas.... maybe more another time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://divreichaim.blogspot.co.uk/2009/10/do-kinyanei-derabbanan-have-chalos.html\">Divrei Chaim</a></p>\n\n\n",

And as Islam is clearly a monotheistic faith, it avoids the problems posed by laws about \"idols\" or \"pagans.\" (E.g. <em>halacha</em> has a lot of problems with a Jew entering a pagan temple, but not a mosque.) Maimonides wrote (just before the year 1200) that Islam spread the language of prophetic monotheism to many peoples that Judaism didn't reach. He also wished that Jews would show the same decorum in their synagogues that Muslims do in their mosques.</p>\n\n<p>However, good fences make good neighbors, too. Islam and Judaism are two different faiths, and we honor neither of them by confusing that line. Judaism did not and can not accept that its tradition of laws were -- abrogated, deprecated, reinterpreted, whatever you want to call it -- by Mohammad. Jews are allowed to drink alcohol. (Now you'll find Jewish cultures that drink more, and some that drink less, and many Jews may even find the Islamic practice of abstinence to be laudable, but Judaism never did and never will ban alcohol entirely.) Muslims are monotheists but not Jews, and thus Jews are not allowed to marry them. And if a Jewish man married a Muslim woman, <em>neither</em> faith would consider the child to be legally one of their own. (<em>Halacha</em> defines Jewish status as matrilineal; <em>sharia</em> defines Islamic status as patrilineal.)</p>\n\n<p>I've never heard of the rabbi you're quoting, and I really don't care. It's the same now as it was when Maimonides wrote extensively about this 800 years ago. They are two different faiths.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Judaism is not for <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16560.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reformation</a> </p>\n\n<p>it is for jews to do the will of G-D almighty </p>\n\n<p>we have enough to do without any changes</p>\n\n<p>Judaism supports Islam's trying to keep the Seven Laws of Noah (keep it up)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The singularity of God.

When the payment of interest is not certain, and it is possible that in the end the borrower will not pay back more than he had borrowed, the interest is only forbidden by rabbinic decree (e.g., karov le-revach ve-rachok me'hefsed).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, further down the article says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein proposed that it is permissible to lend money at interest to corporations, for the assets of corporations are absolutely separate from the assets of the companies' owners and management. According to him, the focus of the prohibition of ribbit lies in the personal lien - the responsibility which the borrower assumes upon himself to repay the loan. Since a corporation is not a person, and the liability for its actions is cast solely on the company's assets, there is no personal lien, and so no prohibition to lend at interest.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach came out sharply against Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's ruling, and the simple sense of the Gemara implies that the prohibition of ribbit is not connected in any way to the personal lien created by the loan. It should be remembered that Halakha makes explicit mention of particular bodies to whom it is permissible to lend at interest (e.g., the community)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But it's not really clear to me specifically what's being said here.  Is the idea of the lien identical to the obligation of the borrower to repay in full or is it distinct and in addition to it?  And it actually seems like the fact that one may loan to the community at fixed interest would support Rav Feinstein's position that it's the lien / repayment obligation which is part of defining a loan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what, specifically, defines a loan?</strong></p>\n\n\n",

This partnership is based upon the\n  stipulation that, upon request, every loss must be attested to by two\n  trustworthy witnesses, and all profits verified by oath. All\n  consequent profits and losses are then equally shared. However, in\n  order to avoid these very stringent requirements, the provider of the\n  funds, under this “Shtar Isko”, agrees to waive his share of the\n  profits in lieu of receiving a fixed percentage of the money advanced.\n  This percentage is then considered profit, rather than interest on a\n  loan.

We have to take care of it while alive because we are borrowing it for our time on Earth. It is widely believed that our Neshama moves on to another body until it has really completed its mission. From dust to dust.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we visit the cemetery to see our relatives, we visit burial sites of Tzadikim, we try not to show our Tzitzit to the dead, and we are told that Hashem will make the dead rise at the end of days.</p>\n\n<p>To me, it seems those 2 aspects of Judaism contradict each other somehow. If the body is a temporary container, why do we care so much about burial sites?</p>\n\n<p>If our soul visits several bodies - which of our bodies will rise at the end of days?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Many Jewish thinkers have actually challenged your assumption that the body is merely a \"vessel\" for the soul.  I'll just copy and paste from an answer of mine elsewhere:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R' Yaakov Weinberg in Fundamentals and Faith explains that the resurrection of the dead implies a profound and fundamentally necessary understanding of the relationship between the body and the soul. The body could be viewed as a vessel, which is shed at the end of your life and is now a thing of the past, while your soul is \"you.\" Resurrection is what shows that \"you\" is the combination of the soul and the body, and your existence as an \"entity\" is defined by that combination. Therefore, the soul must be reunited with the body to meet the \"person's\" final destiny.</p>\n<p>He uses Chazal's analogy (Sanhedrin 91b) of the blind man and the lame man who join forces, by the lame piggybacking on the blind, to steal fruit from an orchard and then each claim innocence, as each of them individually was incapable of committing the act independently. The owner of the orchard puts them back together and punishes them that way. So too, the soul and the body do not make up an entity with free will until they are together, and so too do they receive their reward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>(building on yez's answer) have heard rabbi becher say in his <a href=\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/authors/a/rabbi-mordechai-becher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">shiurim</a> that the soul without the nefesh (which is associated with and bound to the body even after death to some extent) is like an intellect without a personality.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are two general approached to this question. </p>\n\n<p>One approach, which I have seen in multiple sources, is that the body is also a future vessel of the soul, after the resurrection. This body will ultimately be reunited with the soul share in the pleasures of the ultimate reward post-resurrection. The earliest source that I know of for this idea is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kol_Bo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kol Bo</a> (siman 114):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>החזק והצריך לאמונתנו בתחיית המתים, כי אלו היו משליכין גוף האדם המת כאחת הנבלות, היו בני אדם אומרים נמשל כבהמות נדמו ולא היו מקבלין אמונת התחייה, כמו שהן מקבלין עם קבורתו, בראותם כי יבנו לו בית וילבישנו. וכל שכן בראותם כי יקברוהו אצל אבותיו ובני משפחתו, להיות עתידים לעמוד יחד בני המשפחה ולקיים זאת האמונה ההכרחית נכתב בתורה, מה שבא בקבורת האבות ובקפדותם במקום קבורתם ושכבתי עם אבותי, ורבותי ז\"ל אמרו על זה, למה האבות תובעין ומחבבין קבורת ארץ ישראל, אמר רבי פלוני דברים בגו \"אתהלך לפני ה' בארצות החיים\" נמצא שהכוונה היא לאמונת התחייה לחזק האמונה הזאת אמרו \"עתידין צדיקים שיעמדו בלבושיהן\" ולא על כל אדם אמרו רק על הצדיקים, ועל הדרך הזה היא ההקפדה ברוב כבוד גופות המתים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another approach is that specifically because the body was used as a tool for the soul does it retain some of that holiness. This is stated by the Chosam Sofer (Y.D. 336) in distinguishing between how the non-Jews and Jews treat their dead bodies: non-Jews have no need to respect the body once there's no longer 'someone in there', so to speak, but because we believe that the soul <em>uses</em> the body, it's only the combination of body and soul that is actually called \"man\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דכל העכו\"ם חושבים בפירוד הנשמה מהגוף נשאר הגוף בלי שום לחלוחית\n  רוחניות, על כן קוראים הרוח זעליג (=רוח) והגוף פגר (געקערפערט), שהוא\n  כולו גוף (קערפער), ועל כן מנתחים אותו ואינם חוששים לביזיונו... אך בני\n  ישראל מאמינים גם אדם כי ימות באוהל עדיין במותו נקרא אדם פנימי ולא פגר,\n  כי גם בגופו שהיה נרתק לנשמה נשאר בו לחלוחית קדושה, ונוהגים בו כבוד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Talmud (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 71 <em>amud</em> 1] cites an opinion that such a case has never happened and never will. Nonetheless, the Torah discusses what to do if it does happen. That is, the Torah itself is engaging in a sort of vacuous-hypothesis truthtelling.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>While <a href=\"http://adderabbi.blogspot.com/2007/10/translating.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this blog post</a> is not a definitive answer, he cites Ramba\"m's statements at the beginning of Hilchot Yesodei Hatorah, pointing out how Ramba\"m uses the word \"Emet\" in various ways that go beyond the common translation as \"truth\". Excerpt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rambam here is not talking about what is True, but about what is\n  Real. </p>\n  \n  <p>Aside from general accuracy, I think that the difference between the\n  different translations is profound. 'Truth' is an abstract concept\n  that we essentially borrowed from the Greeks. They invented or\n  discovered (not getting into that here) logical rules and postulates\n  which allowed them to categorize statements as being 'true' or\n  'false'. Something which is 'True' corresponds to some kind of Ideal\n  Form, and something which is false does not. </p>\n  \n  <p>At some point, the Hebrew terms 'emet' and 'sheker' came to correspond\n  to these Greek concepts. As we got used to the Greek way of thinking,\n  it was important to have the vocabulary to communicate it. The problem\n  is obviously that it ends up 'Hellenizing' ideas and statements that\n  appear in early Jewish works. Those early sources are not necessarily\n  concerned with abstractions. The Torah and the Neviim, and Chaza\"l in\n  their wake, are amazingly concrete, often expressing abstraction in\n  very 'earthy' ways. They were interested in what's real and what's\n  fake, what's authentic and what's phony, what's original and what's\n  imitation. The problem with lying is not the violation  of some\n  abstract category, but the representation of something which is\n  misleadingly non-real.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a supporting idea, you often see the term \"Emet\" following \"Chesed\", as in this week's parsha in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14020&st=&pgnum=302\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breishit 24:49</a> where Eliezer asks that Rivka's family perform \"Chesed V'Emet\". I encourage you to view Ibn Ezra's commentary, there. Essentially, he says that \"Chessed\" is something that is not required and \"Emet\" is something done to establish the \"chesed\". The point is, that Eleizer prefaces this with the word \"osim\" - to DO, meaning a physical, realistic act. Thus this lends support to the notion that \"Emet\" is based on physical reality and not just plain \"vacuous\" concepts of \"truth\" referring to things that don't exist.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It appears that Judaism does accept such a logical construct in halacha.  Heter iska is an example of such a construct.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If I am a chicken then this money I pay you is profit and not interest</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a true statement in the empty sense and is accepted as valid by Jewish law.

This approach accepts that chodosh applies equally in chutz la’aretz as it does in Eretz Yisrael, but contends that when one is uncertain whether the grain available is chodosh or yoshon, one can rely that it is yoshon and consume it. Because of this double doubt, called a sefek sefeika, many major authorities permitted people to consume the obtainable grain (Rama, Yoreh Deah 293).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>2</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Other authorities permitted the chutz la’aretz grain, relying on the minority of early poskim who treat chodosh as a mitzvah that applies only in Eretz Yisrael (Taz; Aruch Hashulchan).

(Niddah 9b).</p>\n<p>This dispute then embroils one in a different issue: When the Gemara rules that under extenuating circumstances one may rely on a minority opinion, is this true only when dealing with a rabbinic prohibition, or may one do so even when dealing with a potential Torah prohibition? The Taz and Aruch Hashulchan, who permitted chodosh for this reason, conclude that one may follow a minority opinion even when dealing with a potential Torah prohibition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>3</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another halachic basis to permit use of the new grain is that chodosh applies only to grain that grows in a field owned by a Jew, and not to grain grown in a field owned by a non-Jew. Since most fields are owned by gentiles, one can be lenient when one does not know the origin of the grain and assume that it was grown in a gentile’s field, and it is therefore exempt from chodosh laws. This last approach, often referred to simply as “the Bach’s heter,” is the basis upon which most Ashkenazic Jewry relied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>4</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is also an original position of the Kenesses Yechezkel who concludes that, although chodosh applies both in chutz la’aretz and to grain of a gentile, it does not apply when both circumstances apply simultaneously (Shu’t Yoreh Deah #41).

It’s also not so simple to rely on the <em>chiddush</em> of the Bach (or Knesses Yechezkel) since he is explicitly arguing with the mainstream <em>rishonim</em> and is generally rejected by the subsequent <em>achronim</em>, including the GR”A, Shach, and Taz (to name a few).</p>\n\n<p>Because of these weaknesses, and for the sake of intellectual honesty, I would argue that the basis for the lax custom is better answered from a socio-historical perspective rather than a strict Halachik one. Specifically, I would suggest that the <em>kula</em> nowadays is based on a \"perfect storm\" of factors that caused Jews otherwise quite strict in matters of <em>kashrus</em> to be lax with regard to chodosh. </p>\n\n<p>Firstly, as opposed to other <em>maachalos assuros</em> which are fairly fixed, <em>chodosh</em> varies in applicability both by location and season.  As such, communities that never had to worry about <em>chodosh</em>, when transplanted to a different locale, suddenly did.  Furthermore, since alternatives were not readily available, there was a genuine concern on the part of <em>poskim</em> that a stringent ruling would just be ignored (see Rama and Rosh mentioned earlier \"<em>mutav sheyehu shoggegin</em>\").  In addition, there is a fairly obvious trend in the <em>derech hapesak</em> of <em>Chachmei Ashkenaz</em> going back to the <em>Baalei Tosfos</em> to be \"<em>melamed zechus</em>\" on a <em>minhag yisrael</em>.  As such a diverse set of arguments were presented to try and justify the lenient attitude.  (Hassidim, who often are amongst the most stringent on issues of maachalos assuros, are also lax because of a tradition that the Bach appeared in a dream to the Besht and encouraged him to be lax.  Interestingly, it's recorded that while the Besht was indeed lenient for a while, he subsequently returned to his original observing of yoshon.) Finally, in an ironic twist on \"chodosh assur min hatorah\" there is a contemporary popular view in right-wing circles to keep old practices even when the original reasoning no longer applies. In spite of this, there is a growing trend toward yoshon-observance.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, I would add that nowadays people generally rely on popularly accepted kosher symbols which shifts the a question to why are the rabbis behind the symbols lax.  With regard to the most famous kosher symbol, the O-U, Kashrus guidelines are set by Rav Herschel Schachter, Rav Yisrael Belsky, and Rav Menachem Genack. </p>\n\n<p>Rav Schachter justifies the custom based on the Aruch Hashulchan who cites the then recently discovered Ohr Zarua that was <em>melamed zechus</em> by combining 2 <em>chidushim</em>: 1. We follow the view that Chodosh in <em>chutz laaretz</em> is only <em>miderabanan</em>; 2. that gezeira was only applied to nearby lands to Israel. Rav Belsky has suggested that while Hassidim perhaps rely on the Bach, misnagdim should really follow the Rama who forbids chodosh. He subsequently suggested that even misnagdim perhaps rely on the Bach. Rav Belsky himself, as well as Rav Genack, are themselves strict and don't eat chodosh (though the O-U does still certify it, even apparently where there is no doubt that it is chodosh. - perhaps they reason that for the O-U it would be a shaas hadechak since they would lose clients;).</p>\n\n<p>(Rav Mordechai Willig also rules leniently, though he apparently doesn't trust the USDA crop reports or the guide to chodosh and maintains that US grain doesn't hit store shelves till it's yoshon.  This reasoning may also be used by Rav Nachum Rabinovitch who I believe also invokes the Taz in his sefer, Siach Nachum.  The O-U presumably does not cite such a position since they themselves separately certify yoshon flour for bakeries and restaurants which they discontinue once the flour is chodosh [at which point they just affix a regular O-U].)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, with regard to the final question of: \"Is it a commandment...\" The answer is yes. No posek <em>matirs chodosh</em> in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> since that is not up for debate.  It has been a generational practice however to justify the already prevalent lax attitude in the Diaspora where there is more room for debate, at least with the <em>d'oraissa</em> issue.  I think every intellectually honest person would agree that none of the lax positions would have been taken, however, had the masses not already been lax, or (at least in earlier generations) had they been likely to follow a ban on the practice.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Fourth Graders, Museum and Chillul Hashem\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When I was in fourth grade I remember our field trip to the museum. However, I always beared in mind what our teacher said either before we went to the museum or on the bus going there. She told us, \"Remember to make a <em>kiddush Hashem</em> and not a <em>chillul Hashem</em>.\"</p>\n\n<p>I recently learned in <em>halacha</em> that ten adults males - 13 or above - make a <em>minyan</em>. For the <em>shechinah</em> does not dwell in a group with less then ten people.</p>\n\n<p>If non-Jew comes to a person and says, \"Eat this pig or I will kill you!\" What do you do? It depends on the situation. Meaning, if there are ten Jews present, one must give up his life rather then transgress. Why? Because a <em>chillul Hashem</em> is defined as ten people watching a Jew transgress something in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>If one of the fourth graders (i.e. that are below 13) on the trip makes a scene in the museum, how would that constitute a chillul Hashem? If a non-Jew sees this fourth grader misbehaving and says to himself, \"It must be that Jews like him misbehave on trips\" that would be stereotyping.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>With the scenario above, what does <em>halachah</em> define as a <em>chillul Hashem</em>?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>There are two relevant segments of the idea of <em>chillul Hashem</em>.  One discussion is the discussion of when it necessitates giving up your life.  That has one set of standards, laid out in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1105.htm#1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah 5:1-4</a>.</p>\n<p>The other is the <em>chillul Hashem</em> of degrading the impression of Hashem and His followers.  This is discussed in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1105.htm#10\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yesodei HaTorah 5:10-11</a>.  Halacha 11 there says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש דברים אחרים שהם בכלל חילול השם, והוא שיעשה אדם גדול בתורה ומפורסם בחסידות, דברים שהברייות מרננים אחריו בשבילן, ואף על פי שאינם עבירות--הרי זה מחלל את השם</p>\n<p>There are things which are included in <em>chillul Hashem</em>, which a person who is an acknowledged Torah scholar and sage may do, which people find degrading, which even though they are not technically sins, they are still <em>chillul Hashem</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the concept that someone who represents Hashem doing something which brings disgrace is a <em>chillul Hashem</em> even though it is not even a sin.  This can apply within the presence of 10 Jews or not, as Halacha 10 there clearly demonstrates.</p>\n<p>The children would be performing that kind of <em>chillul Hashem</em>, which does not obligate sacrificing their lives, but is still forbidden.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The chillul Hashem to give up your live is chillul Hashem is not the regular chillul Hashem -- see below.</p>\n<p>By the 4th graders, if they might cause a real chillul Hashem (not just PR for the Jewish community) they should not go to the museum (see the end of the halacha \"One who could, however, escape and flee from under the power of a wicked king and fails to do so is like a dog who returns [to lick] his vomit.\")</p>\n<p>If a child under the age of 13 makes a scene in the museum, it would not constitute a chillul Hashem, (i understand chillul Hashem means doing something against G-d's will, children are not obligated by G-d to do anything so if they misbehave it is more a chillul for the teacher since it is his will that they are not listening to)</p>\n<p>I do not know what gives the right for a teacher to make a judgment of a child and declare that the child is responsible for a chillul Hashem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904980/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Mishneh Torah » Sefer Madda » Yesodei haTorah - Chapter Five</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Halacha 2</h3>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>However, if he forces him [to transgress] with the intention that he\nviolate [a mitzvah] in the presence of ten Jews, he should sacrifice\nhis life and not transgress. [This applies] even if [the gentile]\nintended merely that he violate only one of the [Torah's] mitzvot.</p>\n<h3>Halacha 3</h3>\n<p>All the above [distinctions] apply [only in times] other than times of\na decree. However, in times of a decree - i.e., when a wicked king\nlike Nebuchadnezzar or his like will arise and issue a decree against\nthe Jews to nullify their faith or one of the mitzvot - one should\nsacrifice one's life rather than transgress any of the other mitzvot,\nwhether one is compelled [to transgress] amidst ten [Jews] or one is\ncompelled [to transgress merely] amidst gentiles.</p>\n<h3>Halacha 4</h3>\n<p>If anyone about whom it is said: \"Transgress and do not sacrifice your\nlife,\" sacrifices his life and does not transgress, he is held\naccountable for his life. When anyone about whom it is said:\n\"Sacrifice your life and do not transgress,\" sacrifices his life and\ndoes not transgress, he sanctifies [God's] name. If he does so in the\npresence of ten Jews, he sanctifies [God's] name in public, like\nDaniel, Chananiah, Mishael, Azariah, and Rabbi Akiva and his\ncolleagues. These are those slain by [the wicked] kingdom, above whom\nthere is no higher level. Concerning them, [Psalms 44:23] states: \"For\nYour sake, we have been slain all day, we are viewed as sheep for the\nslaughter,\" and [Psalms 50:5] states: \"Gather unto Me, My pious ones,\nthose who have made a covenant with Me by slaughter.\"</p>\n<p>When anyone about whom it is said: \"Sacrifice your life and do not\ntransgress,\" transgresses instead of sacrificing his life, he\ndesecrates [God's] name. If he does so in the presence of ten Jews, he\ndesecrates [God's] name in public, nullifies [the fulfillment of] the\npositive commandment of the sanctification of [God's] name, and\nviolates the negative commandment against the desecration of God's\nname.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, since he was forced to transgress, he is not [punished\nby] lashing, and, needless to say, is not executed by the court even\nif he was forced to slay [a person]. The [punishments of] lashes and\nexecution are administered only to one who transgresses voluntarily,\n[when the transgression is observed by] witnesses, and [when] a\nwarning [was given], as [Leviticus 20:5] states concerning one who\ngives his children to [the worship of] Molech: \"I will turn My face\nagainst that person.\"</p>\n<p>The oral tradition teaches [that we can infer]: \"that person\" and not\none who is forced [to transgress, who transgresses] inadvertently, or\n[who transgresses] because of an error. If, concerning the worship of\nfalse gods, which is the most serious [of sins], a person who is\nforced to worship is not liable for karet, nor, needless to say,\nexecution by a court, how much more so [does this principle apply]\nregarding the other mitzvot of the Torah? [Similarly,] regarding\nforbidden sexual relations, [Deuteronomy 22:26] states: \"Do not do\nanything to the maiden.\"</p>\n<p>One who could, however, escape and flee from under the power of a\nwicked king and fails to do so is like a dog who returns [to lick] his\nvomit. He is considered as one who worships false gods willingly. He\nwill be prevented from reaching the world to come and will descend to\nthe lowest levels of Gehinnom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It is prohibited to fool, mislead or\n  deceive customers, clients or any other people in the process of\n  conducting business or any other interpersonal matters. This is\n  referred to in Halacha as “Geneivas Da’as “(literally: stealing\n  knowledge) The prohibition of Geneivas Da’as applies to men and women\n  and to Jews and non Jews alike. (See Talmud Chulin 94a-b, Shulchan\n  Aruch Choshen Mishpat Siman 228) 2) If one is selling merchandise that\n  has a defect, they must notify the prospective buyer of this\n  defect. (See Pele Yoetz, Topic: Sheker, Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim\n  Siman 156:1 and Aruch HaShulchan 156:3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again this certainly applies to the advertiser. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the publisher, Dr. Meir Tamari, director of the Center for Business Ethics at the Jerusalem College of Technology in an <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ethics/Business_Ethics/In_Practice/Ethical_Practices_at_Work/Assisting_a_Perpetrator.shtml?p=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">article on lifnei iver,</a> writes (in relation to arms sales but I believe the principle can be used in this question too)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One violation of the biblical injunction not to \"place a stumbling\n  block in the path of the blind\" is <strong>aiding and abetting an illegal or\n  unethical transaction</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus an advertiser who makes promises that may not be completely accurate transgresses and the publisher who aids the advertiser also sins. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R' Moshe has a teshuva (Igros Moshe CM 2:30) about cheating on the NY Regents, in which he says that g'neivas da'as that leads to actual monetary results is g'zeila.

However the gemarah megillah 12a based on the pasuk in Esther 1:7 seems to indicate that the utensils that Achashveirosh used at his party were those of the Beit Hamikdash.

Why?</p>\n\n<p>Is it because the right hand is considered \"preferable\" by Judaism? ...Because the ring is put on the right hand under the chuppah? ...Because that is how rings were (and are) worn in Russia? </p>\n\n<p>Also, who and which groups have this custom?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It appears that the wedding ring worn on the right hand is originally a European custom. The custom at the chupah is to put the ring of the kallah's right pointing finger not the \"ring finger\". The \"ring finger\" on the right and left hand is a custom picked up from the nonJewish inhabitants of a local area.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.netplaces.com/jewish-weddings/the-ceremony/ayrusin-the-ring-ceremony.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">How the Ring Is Given</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Despite the fact that rings today are typically worn on the finger\n  next to the pinky, the bride receives the ring from the groom on her\n  right index finger. Many reasons are given for this long-standing\n  tradition. The most straightforward reason is given by Rabbi Samuel\n  Segal of Mezeritch, Poland, in the seventeenth century in his book\n  Nachalat Shivah. He writes that since the index finger is the finger\n  most commonly used to point to things, and therefore the finger most\n  in the forefront and visible, this is the one we use for the giving of\n  the ring before witnesses.</p>\n  \n  <p>Why is the wedding ring placed on the right index finger?</p>\n  \n  <p>The right index finger is the one that we point with, and the right\n  side is considered one of love in Jewish mysticism.</p>\n  \n  <p>The index finger of the right hand is utilized because the right hand\n  is seen as having precedence in Judaism since a majority of people use\n  their right hand dominantly. The right is also appropriate because in\n  the Kabbalah, the right “side” of the divine is a reference to the\n  characteristic of love. Additionally, many people suggest that in\n  ancient times, rings, as is still the case in some eastern cultures,\n  were worn on the index finger, and that this tradition may have just\n  remained with us since that time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_ring\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wedding ring</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Depending on the local culture, it is worn on the base of the right or the left ring finger. The custom of wearing such a ring has spread widely beyond its origin in Europe.<a href=\"http://www.julietoliver.com/blog/where-do-wedding-rings-come-from-/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://engagementrings.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Wedding_Ring_on_the_Right_Hand\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wedding Ring on the Right Hand</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to Reader's Digest, the custom of wearing a wedding ring on\n  the left ring finger is a fairly recent invention, even in\n  English-speaking countries. In fact, before the 1700s, people\n  frequently wore their wedding rings on their right ring fingers. An\n  1869 article entitled The Wedding Ring postulates that this right-hand\n  wearing may have been changed to the left, or generally non-dominant,\n  hand as a way for women to show deference to men, who did not wear\n  wedding rings at that time.</p>\n  \n  <p>Reader's Digest also asserts that the Romans wore wedding rings on\n  their right hands. This may have been due to a cultural belief that\n  the left hand was sinister or untrustworthy. Even today, when people\n  make an important vow or take an oath, they place their left hand on a\n  Bible and raise their right hand. This emphasis on the right hand as a\n  symbol of honor may be related to the historical mistrust of the left\n  hand.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to <a href=\"http://weddingdetails.com/lore-tradition/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wedding Details</a>, people in many central and northern\n  European couples wear wedding rings on their right ring fingers. This\n  is customary for couples from the following countries:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Norway\nAustria\nDenmark\nPoland\nSome parts of Belgium\nGermany\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>German couples traditionally use a simple gold band as an engagement\n  ring and place that band on the left finger before the wedding. After\n  the wedding, they move the ring to the right ring finger, where they\n  wear it as a symbol of their union. Russia and Surrounding Countries</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://masterrussian.com/russianculture/russian_wedding.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master Russia</a> reports that Russians also wear their wedding rings on\n  the right ring finger. According to Latvian jeweler Sudraba Nams,\n  brides and grooms in many Eastern European countries also follow this\n  tradition. These include Latvia, Bulgaria, and Ukraine. Greece</p>\n  \n  <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.greekweddingsandtraditions.com/greek-traditions/greek-wedding-tradition/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greek Wedding Traditions</a>, Greek brides and grooms have\n  worn right-hand wedding rings for many years. Those who are Orthodox\n  Christians continue this custom. However, modern Greek couples living\n  in Western cultures often wear their rings on the left hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it important to learn Mishnah before Talmud?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have recently started learning Talmud / Gemara recently, and though I am enjoying the experience greatly, something tells me that it would be helpful if I actually went about learning Mishnayot first and making siumim on the 6 sedarim before pursuing finishing Shas full time. </p>\n\n<p>With that said, I have heard opinions that there is no need to learn Mishnayot on their own, because you will learn them as you go through Gemara. Some have even said that one might not get as much out of learning just Mishnayot as opposed to pursuing Gemara. </p>\n\n<p>What is the logic behind this thinking? Is this in fact a wide spread opinion? I would think that logically one should learn Mishnah before learning Gemara, no?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>This answer is from my personal experience.</p>\n\n<p>I made a siyum hashas on mishna for my bar mitzvah before ever opening a gemara. We (my father and i) learned with Perush Kehati.</p>\n\n<p>When there was something ambiguous in the mishna that was explained by the gemara, Kehati would bring it. We didn't have to look it up in the gemara, which was good, because i had not yet learned how the gemara works.</p>\n\n<p>Now that i'm learning gemara, i find that knowing the concepts from learning mishna is very helpful. For example, the different levels of tumah.</p>\n\n<p>So, i think it is helpful to learn the mishna before starting gemara. I got plenty out of it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Disclaimer: the answer is based on my personal experience.</p>\n\n<p>Learning Mishna before learning the Gemara is very helpful to get the basic knowledge. However, learning <em>all</em> the mishnayot is very time consuming. Also, in many cases, learning mishnayot may be less pleasurable then gemara (warning: this is a subjective statement). And getting pleasure from the learning is an important value. Not only because of egoistic goal to get pleasure from the life. Recieving a pleasure is an integral part of fulfilling the mitzva of talmud torah (see preface of Iglei Tal).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I found the following to the excellent balance. Before (or at least very close after starting of) learning a tractate of a gemara, I try to finish all the mishnayot of that tractate. This makes it much easier to understand gemara when it cites a mishna from the following part of the tractate.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You've asked an interesting and useful question. I don't have a definitive answer, as I think both views are valid.</p>\n\n<p>To start, Pirkei Avot (Chapters of the Fathers) <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31565&st=&pgnum=42\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chapter 5, Mishnah 21</a> cites Yehudah ben Tamai who said that when one turns 10, he should learn Mishnah, and at 15, he should learn Gemarah. Perhaps, this is the source of separating the two. I hunted, but I haven't found a commentary that elaborates on why Yehuda ben Tamai said this. But, apparently, the Mishnah, encourages, or at least Yehuda ben Tabai, himself, suggests, separation. I surmise that since he places ages, his opinion is based on mental maturity / capacity.</p>\n\n<p>So, what I state below is my opinion, based on having done both methods - together and separately.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of the Mishnah is in Hebrew and most of the Gemarah is in Aramaic. In elementary school, I learned Hebrew first, so in 5th grade, I studied only Mishnah. In 6th grade, prior to learning Gemarah, we had to memorize several pages of common Aramaic Gemarah words before we could even begin learning Gemarah. Bear in mind, that this was in the pre Art Scroll era. (I'll address this, briefly, later.) In hindsight, while my rebbe was harsh, and a bit meshugah in his pedagogy, I think this method did get us to better understand the gemarrah. So, in short, if your Hebrew is good, but your Aramaic is next to zero, you MIGHT want to follow some of my original methodology.</p>\n\n<p>Having stated this, we are now in a wonderful era of Art Scroll, Soncino and Steinzaltz. I prefer Steinzaltz, even in the Hebrew version, though the English one is wonderful for beginners as well. Point is, that even if your have no Hebrew or Aramaic knowledge whatsoever, and even if you can't read Hebrew, you can understand Gemarrah well.</p>\n\n<p>Preference? I find that learning Gemarah together with the Mishnah is better, esp. if you have a good command of Hebrew and enough of a command of \"common Gemarah Aramaic\" to follow the most common words as well as understand Gemarah methodology (it's rules). The Mishnah is an \"overview\". It states the facts along with different opinions, sometimes, of what to do. Rarely does the Mishnah state the Torah source or describe the details of how or why it said what it did. As a matter of fact, often when you look at Rash\"i commentary on the Mishnah, he will say nothing more than \"The Gemarra will explain this, further.\" So, in a sense, you're FORCED to view the Gemarrah! And even if you used Steinzaltz, Art Scroll, etc., for just the Mishnah, where do you think most of their explanations came from? The Gemarah, of course!</p>\n\n<p>(I am, generally, not in favor of someone using any of these English translations, as, no matter who good they are, anything translated can not be as good as the original source. Something is almost always lost in translation. However, I do understand that not everyone is competent in English, Aramaic or \"Yeshivish\", so these translations certainly are useful for this crowd. But if possible, better to learn Hebrew and some Aramaic. Don't learn \"yeshivish\", though ... PLEASE don't. I get irked when people call them \"tallaysim\" and people stay \"BY\" someone for 3 \"Shabbosim\".)</p>\n\n<p>Summarizing - If you're satisfied with a quick overview, the Mishnah will suffice. But, if you really want to appreciate what you are learning, understanding better the source of things as well as seeing different opinions and gaining a better appreciation of logic and honming your logical skills (a side-effect o following Gemarah methodology), then learn it with the Gemarah.</p>\n\n<p>One last small note - There are many tractates that have no Gemarah! In the order of Zera'im, only Brachot has a Gemarah. As a matter of fact, the phrase I quoted at the top, from Pirkei Avot, is another tractate with no Gemarrah. So, if you were to just concentrate on Gemarrah ... my oh my... you'd be missing out on quite a bit :-)  Just something to keep in mind!</p>\n\n<p>Note: Yerushalmi includes many of the tractates left out of Bavli...</p>\n\n\n",

If the couple later become baalei teshuvah, are they required to perform <em>kiddushin</em> again (or, I suppose, if the first wedding didn't count, for the first time)?</p>\n\n<p>Is the case any different if the couple was married in a Conservative ceremony? </p>\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/48415/are-civil-divorces-recognized-by-orthodox-rabbis\">Are civil divorces not recognized by Orthodox rabbis?</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>One of the biggest deal-breakers in the ceremony -- more than the language of the ketubah -- is if the witnesses were shabbat-observant. There are other issues in non-Orthodox ceremonies, but that's by far the biggest. </p>\n\n<p>In theory the Talmud talks about situations where a couple would have in mind that if the wedding ceremony itself isn't valid, they would still want to be married vis-a-vis halacha; as we are all witnesses that they are living together as husband and wife, that could count. However it's not clear whether this applies to couples who aren't cognizant of traditional halacha.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the penalty for adultery is far worse than that for premarital relations, so rabbis lose a lot more sleep about \"maybe her divorce wasn't valid before she remarried\" than \"maybe this happily-married couple didn't have a valid marriage.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hence if a baal teshuva couple tells their rabbi that they didn't have shabbat-observant witnesses, he may very well recommend (if it won't burn bridges) that they undergo an Orthodox wedding ceremony. I've seen one of these. They ask everyone to stay for after davening on Sunday morning so you have a minyan, it takes ten minutes. (And no you don't need a band, a caterer, photos, any of that.)</p>\n\n<p>On the flipside, though, an Orthodox rabbi will play it safe and always ask that a divorcing Jewish couple go through an Orthodox divorce ceremony (a <em>Get</em>). It can't hurt.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>R' Yosef Eliyahu Henkin (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2875&st=&pgnum=87&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">פירושי אירבא סימן ד</a>) held that it does not actually matter if the wedding was valid, as they are living together with intent to be married.  Rav Henkin adopted the novel view that even if their intent to be married is not necessarily through <em>Kiddushin</em>, and even if they don't know that consumation of marriage can create <em>Kiddushin</em>, they are still married.  According to this opinion, the question about the wedding itself really becomes moot.</p>\n\n<p>However, most opinions did not accept the view of R' Henkin.</p>\n\n<p>I was told that R' Elyashiv held that there is a problem with the normal procedure of a Reform and Conservative wedding which would invalidate the <em>Kiddushin</em>.  <em>Kiddushin</em> is effected by the man <em>giving</em> something of value to the woman.  R' Elyashiv understood that a two-ring ceremony is not a \"gift\" from one to the other, but is rather an exchange.  The bride giving a ring to the groom in reciprocation to his giving a ring to her invalidates this as an act of <em>Kiddushin</em>.  I was once at a Conservative wedding where the officiating Rabbi was sensitive to this issue - after the groom gave the ring to the bride, the Rabbi announced \"The <em>Kiddushin</em> ceremony is now over.  However, Cindy has indictated that she would also like to give a ring to Joel, which will be done now.\" I think this would obviate R' Elyashiv's concern, but it is atypical to your standard Reform or Conservative wedding.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I heard from R. Nota Greenblatt that although we are are stringent in accordance with R. Henkin's view that the marriage is valid, and we would require a get, even in the event that she is dating a kohen and would be prohibited to him from an actual get, she may marry the kohen. Even though a rabbinic prohibition exists after giving an invalid get, this prohibition only applies where giving a get indicates an actual divorce. In contemporary America, however, where so many non-halachic marriages take place, followed by gittin that are mere chumros, this decree wouldnt apply, and she would be permitted even to a kohen.</p>\n\n<p>(Although this seems contradictory since why obligate a get in the first place if it isnt valid, it isnt a contradiction because we are extra stringent with the get because hinged on it are biblical prohibitions of adultery, and mamzerus isues. Marriage to a kohen is a much lest stringent prohibition.)</p>\n\n\n",

Eliezer had a daughter whom he wanted to marry off to Yitzchok, but this was not accepted by Avraham because Eliezer was a descendant of Canaan and was accursed, whereas Yitzchok was blessed (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8219#showrashi=true&v=39\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi to  Bereishis 24:39</a>).  This was reflected in his being an eved (servant), as this was the curse that Canaan was given (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8173#v=25\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereishit 9:25</a>).  R' Yaakov explained that during the course of Eliezer's mission, he started out as \"eved\" (verses 2 - 17), but upon finding Rivka and completing his mission, he became \"blessed\" (as Lavan declares in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8219#v=31\" rel=\"nofollow\">verse 31</a>), and therefore was transformed into an \"ish\" (verses 21 - 32).  However, after having removed his ineligibility to marry his own daughter to Yitzchok, Eliezer tried to ruin the match by implying there was some problem with Yitzchok (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8219#v=39\" rel=\"nofollow\">verse 39</a>), and at that point he reverts to being an eved (verses 52 - the end, with two exceptions that R' Yaakov explains).  So the absense of his name is in order to refer to him by his status, which is important to the story line.</p>\n\n<p>(I have my own explanation of this labeling pattern, but I'll defer to R' Yaakov for this forum.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If we go with the opinion that Eliezer had his good servitude repaid in full by being made king of the Bashan, known famously by his other name Og, see Pirkei DiRabi Eliezer 16, than I think the personality of this person itself would answer why we don't mention his name alongside his good deeds. He was not really a nice person doing nice things, rather simply a servant doing his master's bidding, the medrash there in fact calls him a rasha. So there is no reason to attribute the actions to him.</p>\n\n<p>Again in chapter 31 of Pirkei DiRabi Eliezer we find Eliezer's true intentions where we find him happy to see Avraham taking Yitzchok to sacrifice him leaving himself, Eliezer, to inherit Avraham.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How could Avraham feed his guests milk?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the gemarah (Sanhedrin 21 I think) milk was considered the limb of a living being - <em>eiver min ha'chai</em> - until matan torah. If so, how could Avraham serve it to his guests if a ben Noach was forbidden to consume it? Is this not placing a stumbling block before a blind man?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Quoting from <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/h/sh/r/48969771.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, #7:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a general prohibition of \"eating a limb from a live animal\" (ever min hachai), which logically should also include milk, the product of a live animal. Ever min hachai is actually one of the Seven Noahide Laws which the Jews observed prior to Sinai (and which has applied to all humanity since the days of Noah).</p>\n<p>However, upon receiving the Torah, which refers to the Land of Israel as \"flowing with milk and honey\" (Exodus 3:18), dairy products became permitted to the Jews. In other words, at the same moment that their meat became prohibited, dairy became permitted. They ate dairy on that original Shavuot, and we do today, too.</p>\n<p>If the Jews ate dairy for the first time at Mount Sinai, this raises the question how Abraham could have fed dairy products to his three guests (Genesis 18:8).</p>\n<p>The answer requires a technical understanding of the prohibition of ever min hachai, \"limb from a live animal.\" One way is to define a \"limb\" as a piece of meat which contains bones and/or sinews. It is this type of ever min hachai which has always been forbidden to non-Jews. This prohibition does not include milk, because although milk comes from a live animal, it does not contains bones or sinews. Hence, Abraham was permitted to feed milk to his non-Jewish guests.</p>\n<p>There is a second, expanded definition of ever min hachai, which encompasses all products from a live animal -- including milk. It is this definition which is prohibited to Jews. Thus it was not until the giving of the Torah, with its reference to \"land of milk and honey,\" that dairy products became permitted to Jews.</p>\n<p>This distinction is spelled out clearly by the great Rabbi Shlomo Kluger, in \"HaElef Lecha Shlomo\" (Yoreh Deah 322).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Sanhedrin 21 has the halachos of a king. I did not see a reference to matan torah and milk in it. I checked other sources and the reference is to Bechoros 6b (ArtScroll 6b2 notes 24, 25, and 27) Part of the reasoning as to why Avraham could serve milk is based on an implication that milk was not considered eiver min hachai (for Ben Noach) that seems to be derived from those notes.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the fact that </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rabbipauli.blogspot.com/2014/11/parsha-vayeira-stories-and-news-updates.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parshas Vayeira</a>l</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good,\n  and gave it unto the servant; and he hastened to dress it. 8 And he\n  took curd, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it\n  before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note there are two commentaries here: First he serves milk and then\n  later meat while the other commentary says at this point Avraham is a\n  Ben Noach and not bound by the prohibition s of waiting between milk\n  and meat and the reverse. For a Ben Noach can even eat together milk\n  and meat together and therefore no conflict within.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the implication here is that <strong>even</strong> eating milk and meat together is permitted a Ben Noach. Thus milk by itself is of course permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Milk is blood changed to feeding material which in its turn is changed to blood. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, he shows that it is not forbidden to ben Noach as aiver min hachai.</p>\n\n<p>Also note the explicit prohibition of consuming blood. That is because it is not aiver min hachai. That is, while it is contained within the body of the animal, it is not a dependant limb of that animal (like a leg).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://haemtza.blogspot.com/2007/05/refuting-rav-moshe-sternbuch-dairy.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Refuting Rav Moshe Sternbuch</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In his Sefer Moadim U’Zmanim(V.8 - 79:319), Rav Moshe Sternbuch brings\n  a novel reason for this Minhag. He says it is based on the Gemarah in\n  Bechoros(6B) that discusses whether milk taken from a cow was\n  considered Eiver Min HaChai (eating the limb of a live animal) before\n  Matan Torah. If that is so then it is at MatanTorah that we are\n  informed that milk is no longer considered Eiver Min HaChai and is\n  Mutar. Rav Sternbuch says we eat dairy meal on Shavuos to symbolize\n  that.</p>\n  \n  <p>But Rav Sternbuch’s reason is difficult. The fact is the we see from\n  an earlier incident in the Torah that milk was permitted.</p>\n  \n  <p>Avraham Avinu gave cheese and milk to his guests and did not worry\n  about feeding them something which is forbidden to them. If dairy\n  products were forbidden by virtue of Eiver Min HaChai he would have\n  been guilty of Lifnei Iver Lo Setein Michshol, the forbidden act of\n  putting stumbling blocks in front of others. Lifnei Iver applies to\n  Jews putting stumbling blocks in front of non Jews equally as it does\n  to non Jews. We see that milk was not considered Eiver Min HaChai or\n  Avraham wouldn’t have served it.</p>\n  \n  <p>But one can find in the Meshech Chachama a scenario that can be used\n  as a defense of Rav Sternbuch’s reason. It is possible that milk\n  served by Avraham was from a Ben Pakua. A Ben Pakua is a surviving\n  fetus within an animal that was properly slaughtered. Such an animal\n  is considered Kosher without Shechita. And as such, taking milk from\n  the ‘Shechted fetus’ would not be considered Ever Min HaChai under\n  these circumstances. And therefore, pre Matan Torah under normal\n  circumstances milk was considered Eiver Min HaChai.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Sternbuch is still difficult, however. If one looks at the\n  Talmudic source of Rabbi Sternbuch’s reason, one will see an\n  expounding of the words “land of milk and honey” (Shemos 3). If it\n  were true that milk was considered Assur before Matan Torah because of\n  Eiver Min HaChai, it would never have used it as an element in\n  extolling the virtues of Eretz Yisroel. And this Pasuk in the Torah is\n  written before Matan Torah during God’s encounter with Moshe Rabbenu\n  at the burning bush. Since milk was used in this way, it shows that\n  milk must have been permitted well before the revelation at Sinai,\n  thus refuting Rav Sternbuch’s explanation.</p>\n  \n  <p>Taken from <em>Torah L’Daas</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Art Scroll Gemoro in Bechoros 6b2 note 24\nהואיל וליכא מידי דאתי מחי ושרייה דרחמנא</p>\n\n<p><strong>Since there is nothing that comes from a live animal that Hashem permitted.</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>note 24</em>: There is a Bilical prohibition against eating the limb (or meat) of a live animale. We would therefore think that milk is\n  included in this prohibition (<em>Rabbeinu Gershom</em>; see also <em>Shach,\n  Yoreh Deah 81:12</em> and <em>Maharit Algazi</em> 2:7) as the Gemara proceeds to\n  state</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>והאי חלב כעבר מן החי הוא ושרי</p>\n\n<p><strong>yet this milk</strong> (of a kosher animal) <strong>is like a limb from a live</strong> animal <strong>and</strong> nevertheless <strong>it is permitted</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>note 25</em>: It is thus a novelty to say that the milk of a kosher animal is\n  permitted for consumption (<em>Rabbeinu Gershom</em>)</p>\n  \n  <p>The categorization of milk as a limb or meat of a live animal, however,\n  is difficult to understand; while the limbs and meat are living parts\n  of the animal, the milk is and independant entity held in animal's\n  udder, and <strong>presumably not subject to the prohibitions applying to\n  living parts of an animal</strong> (emphasis added). For this reason a number\n  of Acharonim understand that the prohibition the gemara is referring\n  to is actually <strong>not</strong> the classic prohibition against eating the the\n  limb of a live animal (<em>and thus not prohibited to a Ben Noach - my\n  understanding of the quote</em>), but is rather based on the fact that the\n  milk is a product of a living animal lacking <em>shechitah</em> (see <em>Noda\n  BiYehudah</em>, <em>Tinyana</em>, <em>Yoreh Deah</em> 36; <em>Meromei Sadeh</em> and other\n  commentaries to our <em>sugya</em>). See <em>Pleisi</em> 81:7, and <em>Chasam Sofer,\n  Yoreh Deah</em> 70 ד\"ה נחזי; for further discussion of this issue see\n  <em>Kehillos Yaakov</em> 6 at length.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>וחלב דבהמה טהורה מנלן דשרי</p>\n\n<p>Now milk of a kosher animal, from where do we know it is kosher.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>note 27</em>: I.e. why is it indeed not forbidden like a limb [or meat] of a live animal, or due to the fact that it originates from forbidden\n  blood?</p>\n  \n  <p>[*Shitah Mekubetzes 2 cites <em>Tos. Chitzoniyos</em> who ask why the Gemara\n  does not derive the permissibility of milk from the fact that Avraham\n  served milk to his guests (see Bereishis 18:8) See <em>Maharit Algazi,\n  Leisi</em> (ibid.) and <em>mitzpeh Eisan</em> for further discussion.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think you are reffering to the gemara in בכורות ו׳ ע׳ב. There, the gemara is discussing a certain different limud according to one opinion and in order to understand his logic proposes a הוה אמינה that  חלב כי אבר מן החי. The use of the word כי and the fact that this is never mentioned as actually being אבר מן החי anywhere would mean that it is in fact not. The following sugya discussing how we know milk is allowed are just proofs to the fact, not actual drashos.</p>\n\n\n",

Remember that Allah sent His torment on the village that disobeyed Him and broke their pledge and their covenant to observe the sanctity of the Sabbath. They began using deceitful means to avoid honoring the Sabbath by placing nets, ropes and artificial pools of water for the purpose of fishing before the Sabbath. When the fish came in abundance on Saturday as usual, they were caught in the ropes and nets for the rest of Saturday. During the night, the Jews collected the fish after the Sabbath ended. When they did that, Allah changed them from humans into monkeys, the animals having the form closest to humans. Their evil deeds and deceit appeared lawful on the surface, but they were in reality wicked. This is why their punishment was compatible with their crime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(And ask them (O Muhammad ) about the town that was by the sea; when they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday): when their fish came to them openly on the Sabbath day, and did not come to them on the day they had no Sabbath. Thus We made a trial of them, for they used to rebel (disobey Allah).)(7:163)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I got the above Quran verse from the link, and the fishing net story is not recorded in Quran but some other secondary sources. So were  some Jews transformed for actually fishing on sabbath on seeing large amounts of fish?</p>\n<p>Do Jewish sources record this miracle?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 23)\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://people.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/SEGAL.html\">Prof. Eliezer Segal</a>, in an essay entitled \"<a href=\"http://people.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/Shokel/070419_MonkeyBusiness.html\">Monkey Business</a>,\" discussing the unfortunate contemporary phenomenon of \"Islamicist clerics\" preaching that Jews, generally, are descended from apes and pigs, says that there is no Jewish source to be found for this story:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unfortunately, in all the vast stores of ancient rabbinic literature, no text has yet been discovered that corresponds to the Qur'an's motifs of Jews who caught fish on Saturday, or of their being transformed into swine and monkeys.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He cites a suggestion that this story could somehow be a multiply-corrupted version of the story in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9877#v=15\">Exodus 16:15-31</a>, when God started providing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna\">manna</a> to the Israelites in the dessert:</p>\n\n<p>First, God commanded the people to collect one day's worth of manna each day, and not keep any leftovers for the next day. Some people violated this commandment by keeping some manna overnight, and it got wormy and rotten. Then, God commanded that on Friday, the people should collect two portions, keep the second one for the Sabbath, and <em>not</em> collect on the Sabbath. When Sabbath came, the extra portions did not get wormy or rot, but some people violated this commandment, too, by going out to collect manna on the Sabbath. God reprimanded Moses about this violation, but the text doesn't say anything about a punishment.</p>\n\n<p>So, maybe, as the story got retold imperfectly, manna sprouting worms became people turning into worms, which became people turning into monkeys, which got moved to the second violation, which turned from collecting manna to pre-setting fish traps. It sounds pretty farfetched to me, but maybe that's where this story comes from.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to Prof. Segal's inability to locate a Jewish source for this story, its incorrect allusion to Jewish law makes it very unlikely to be true (well, that and the part about people being turned into monkeys). As ShmuelBrin and Daniel pointed out in the comments, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnah\">Mishna</a> (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shabbat.1.6\">Shabbat 1:7</a>) records the ruling of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Hillel\">Academy of Hillel</a> that exactly the type of net-laying described in the story is permitted. With very limited exceptions (this not being one of them), the rulings of the Academy of Hillel have been accepted as final.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, bais din was required to have the witnesses testify. The leap year was determined by analysis of the facts put before bais din, such as the crops, the relationship of the solar position to the current calendar, etc.That is, witnesses would be required to establish the facts being put before bais din. This is sufficient to determine the new month. However, once the facts of the case had been established, the leap year required expert analysis of those facts. For this, witnesses were not sufficient. In fact, that is why only those who were sufficiently expert would be invited to assist in the deliberations.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Yibum and Chalitzah: stringency or leniency?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=8&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Yevamoth</em> 8a</a>, we discuss a group of women (enumerated in <em>mishna</em> 1:1) with whom neither <em>yibum</em> (levirate marriage) nor <em>chalitzah</em> (the rejection of levirate marriage) takes place.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <em>gemara</em>, there are two places in <em>Torah</em> whence we can learn about levirate marriage: a man's brother's wife and a man's wife's sister.  The former is a situation in which a man A performs either <em>yibum</em> or <em>chalitzah</em> with his brother B's wife when B dies without children (where normally a man's brother's wife is forbidden to him); the latter is that a man may not perform <em>yibum</em> or <em>chalitzah</em> with the sister of his wife.</p>\n\n<p>Up to this point, the <em>gemara</em> has compared the group of women (enumerated in the first <em>mishna</em>) with a man's wife's sister (and hence they are exempt from <em>yibum</em> and <em>chalitzah</em>).  The <em>gemara</em> now asks why we don't compare this group to a man's brother's wife, and hence permit <em>yibum</em> and <em>chalitzah</em> with them.  The first answer given reads as follows.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר ליה רב אחא מדפתי לרבינא מכדי כל עריות איכא לאקושינהו לאשת אח ואיכא\n  לאקושינהו לאחות אשה מאי חזית דאקשת לאחות אשה אקשינהו לאשת אח איבעית\n  אימא לקולא וחומרא לחומרא מקשינן</p>\n  \n  <p>Said R. Aha of Difti to Rabina: Consider! All forbidden relatives\n  might be compared to a brother's wife and might equally be compared to\n  a wife's sister, what reason do you see for comparing them to a wife's\n  sister? Compare them rather to a brother's wife! — If you wish I might\n  say: When a comparison may be made for increasing as well as for\n  decreasing restrictions, that for increasing restrictions must be\n  preferred. [translation from <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/yebamoth/yebamoth_8.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>gemara</em> answers that permitting <em>yibum</em> would be a leniency, since we would be permitting a marriage where normally (outside of a <em>yibum</em> situation) it would be forbidden.  The <em>gemara</em> asserts that we prefer not to do that if there is a stringency that could be applied instead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question: is this stringency not a stringency that might lead to a leniency (חומרא דאתי לידי קולא)? Should we not also require <em>chalitzah</em> as a stringency before the woman marries someone else?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Consider, for example, the case of two brothers A and B, where A is married to X, and B is married to Y, who is X's mother.  Say that B dies without children, and Y comes to A for either <em>yibum</em> or <em>chalitzah</em>.  The <em>gemara</em> says that as a stringency, we do not allow A to perform <em>yibum</em> or <em>chalitzah</em> with Y. However, Y is now allowed to go marry C, another man who is not forbidden to her.  If we really should have compared the group of women to a man's brother's wife and not to a man's wife's sister, do we not now have a situation where Y and C might be in an adulterous relationship, as Y wasn't properly cleared from her previous marriage to B?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note: Many of the unqualified statements in this question should be qualified, but for the sake of trimming an already long question, I left out the qualifications.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As suggested in one of the comments, the Gemara is describing an exegetical rule, rather than a principle of erring to the side of stringency when in doubt. This understanding is supported by the gemara's alternative answer there:</p>\n\n<p>איבעית אימא הכא תרי איסורי והכא תרי איסורי ותרי מתרי ילפינן אבל הכא חדא איסורא ותרי מחדא לא ילפינן</p>\n\n<p><em>If you prefer, however, I might say: In the former\ncases there are two prohibitions in the one as well as in the other, and a double prohibition may\njustly be inferred from a double prohibition; in the latter case, however, only one prohibition is\ninvolved, and a double prohibition may not be inferred from a single one.</em></p>\n\n<p>This answer is clearly a rule that is used by an ambiguous <em>hekesh</em>, and presumably these 2 answers are not miles apart. </p>\n\n<p>It is possible that the <strong>source</strong> for this rule is the principle that when in doubt we follow the stringent ruling, but once written in the \"Drasha rule book,\" it is simply a guideline for figuring out what the pasuk is teaching us.</p>\n\n\n",

(emphasis mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apparently, the Avos were careful to separate maaser. But who did they give their maaser to? Though we find Avraham giving a tithe to Shem who was a Kohen of sorts (see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8209#showrashi=true&v=20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beraishis 13:20</a> with Rashi there), that was in a situation of dividing war spoils.</p>\n<p>Since the separating being discussed here is the regular tithes of all crop yields--if it was for Shem, then it should've been referred as \"Teruma.\" Were there Leviim at that time too?</p>\n<p>I would be intrigued to hear an answer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The one Av we find mentioning maaser outright was Yaakov in parshas Vayeitzei chapter 28 verse 22. That Maaser is explaned by Rashbam to be Korbanos. Radak, Seichel Tov and Pirkei diRabi Eliazar all explain it was a separating of one of his children for heavenly servitude, a job detail Levi filled. Only Rashi in chapter 32 verse 14 seems to learn it was an actual maaser on animals. The Meshech Chochmah explains Rashi opinion to mean that the animals were sacrificed. </p>\n\n<p>Chazal explained that the מאה שערים mentioned in in chapter 26 verse 12 was hinting to Yitzchok giving מעשר, see Bereishis Rabba 64 6, mentioned in Rashi and Ibn Ezra on the passuk. This Maaser was given as Tzedaka to the poor see Pirkei DiRabi Eliezer in the begining of chapter 33 & the first chapter of Tanna DiBei Eiliyahu Zuta. </p>\n\n<p>This is all besides the fact that it is quite possible that until the establishment of the Levite class post the sin of the Eigel, no such position existed. There were Kohanim, who were the firstborn, and perhaps the entire tribe of Levi after the firstborns lost their status at the Eigel, but no such idea of Leviim in the sense that we know them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/44081/how-could-avraham-feed-his-guests-tongue/44309#44309\">How could Avraham feed his guests tongue?</a> I point out that technically, Avraham Yitzchak and Yaakov were kohanim themselves. Thus, they could have separated ma'aser and \"given\" it to themselves for Hashem. Also, since they funded their own Yeshivos, they could have used their ma'aser kesafim for that purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Another point is that since it was before matan torah, ma'aser in general would have been similar to ma'aser kesafim nowadays. That is, a midus chassidus and not a davar kedushah (sacred). As a result, it could all have gone to poor people.</p>\n\n<p>The analogy is brought because even if the avos kept the mitzvos, they were not required to do so. Thus, Eisav's questions (about salt and straw) were designed to make it look as if he had already accepted and carried out all other aspects of ma'aser.</p>\n\n<p>Since it was before matan torah, the equivalent of kohanim and leviyim were not really \"officially\" appointed. While Shem was the initial kohen in the family of Noach, he would have passed it down through the line. Apparently Hashem appointed the Avos as kohanim by giving them the bracha.</p>\n\n<p>Eisav by selling the bechorah showed that he did not want to have the kehunah come to him, which meant that Hashem appointed Yaakov. Levi and his descendants took on that role in Mitzrayim.</p>\n\n\n",

Avimelech was a perverted rasha and always kept an eye out to peep on them. Apparently one time he got what he wanted.

With this point he answers how Yitzchok could have behaved indecently, and of course Yitzchok was careful to be tznius from the regular neighbors windows, but Avimelech's peeping window was unexpected. </p>\n\n\n",

If so, why did he go ahead and bless him, instead of waiting to make sure?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The sefer Tsror HaChaim (added to beginning of the sefer Shoshanas Ya’akov) <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=52651&st=&pgnum=4&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yitzchok was afraid that Ya’akov might come and trick him, as he in fact did. So what did he do to forestall this possibility? He figured that if Ya’akov was going to try to trick him into thinking that he is Eisav, he would change his voice and speak harshly like the voice of Eisav. Therefore he instructed Eisav that when he returns from hunting to receive the blessing he should change his voice and speak gently like the voice of Ya’akov. Thus, if the one coming for the blessing spoke like Eisav, he would know for sure that\n  it is Ya’akov.</p>\n  \n  <p>But Rivkah knew about Yitzchok’s plan through prophetic vision, as we see from an earlier posuk “And Rivkah spoke to Ya’akov, saying (לאמר): Behold, I heard your father speak to Eisav your brother, saying” (27:6). The Alshich asks why the posuk writes the word “saying” twice, but we can explain it according to the well known rule that wherever the Torah writes an expression of דיבור it connotes a harsh\n  way of speaking, and wherever it writes an expression of אמירה\n  it connotes a gentle way of speaking.</p>\n  \n  <p>Hence, the posuk means that “Rivkah said to her son Ya’akov, לאמר” - she told him to speak gently and not to change his voice from how he normally speaks. And why did she tell him to do this? Because “behold, I heard your father speaking to your brother Eisav, לאמר” - he told Eisav that he should speak gently. Therefore if you change your voice and speak harshly like Eisav, he will realize that you are Ya’akov.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, when Ya’akov came before Yitzchok he did not change his voice, and therefore Yitzchok confidently said “the voice is the voice of Ya’akov” - that is one sign that this is Eisav, “and the hands are the hands of Eisav” - that is another sign. And so “he blessed him” - because he had no doubt in the matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The full text in English can be found <a href=\"http://shlomokluger.com/Other-Books/Various-Commentaries/Tsror-HaChaim-Toldos.html#27.22\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

He explains that Halacha forbids possessing figures of human beings because they give the appearance of idolatrous articles. When it comes to toy dolls, however, it is clear to all that they serve as toys for children, and are not used as objects of worship. Furthermore, children generally use dolls in a disrespectful manner, throwing them around on the floor, stepping on them, and so on, and therefore they cannot be mistaken for articles of idolatry.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, if a person receives a trophy with a complete image of a\n  human being, and he wishes to place it on his mantle, this may,\n  indeed, violate the prohibition of possessing images of a human being.\n  One should therefore disfigure the image or remove one of the trophy's\n  body parts, such as an arm or the nose. The Shulchan Aruch rules that\n  the prohibition applies only to complete images of a human being, and\n  therefore once a body part is removed from the trophy one may keep it\n  in his home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Assuming a trophy is considered something that could be misconstrued as an idol (though it is highly unlikely that anyone in the contemporary western world would do so), some of the chess pieces would likely be subject to the same ruling.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2012/03/29/childrens-dolls-in-halachah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dinonline.org/2012/03/29/childrens-dolls-in-halachah/</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Shevet Ha-Levi is stringent concerning dolls (based on Yoreh De’ah 141).</p>\n  \n  <p>However, many are lenient, because the doll is clearly a children’s\n  toy, and not something that any self-respecting idolater will worship.\n  This is parallel to the halachah of keilim mevuzim, which are\n  permitted even when they have a tzurah on them, because they are\n  certainly not intended for idolatry.</p>\n  \n  <p>The common custom is to be lenient in this matter; though this is\n  possibly out of ignorance of the issue, I know many yerei shamayim who\n  are not particular about buying dolls.</p>\n  \n  <p>If somebody has such dolls in his possession, he must be careful not\n  to “fix” them if they break, for this can be involve a severe\n  prohibition.</p>\n  \n  <p>See: Shut Oznei Yehoshua (1:13); Yabia Omer (3: Yoreh De’ah 8);\n  Yecheveh Da’as (3:64).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In contrast, <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/ask/ask058.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ohr Sameach's \"Ask the Rabbi\"</a> cites the Chokhmath Adam (85:6) that suggests that nowadays in the western world where there is no longer such a concern of suspected idolatrous uses for these types of objects, ownership alone is not as problematic.

Another stands in front of an open Torah holding the yad- the reader. Person getting the aliyah makes the bracha. The reader opens the Torah. The rabbi reads a few words from his chumash with the trope. The reader repeats exactly what the rabbi said - the words and the trope. But the reader is not moving the yad and not following any of the words in the Torah itself. He knows where the parsha starts, but has no idea, when looking in the Torah where the pasuk ends, or where the sequence of words that the rabbi said ends. In short, the open Torah is there as a \"prop\".

He starts off by pointing out that we find in hilchos Megila siman 690 that one may not help the chazzan out of a chumash for fear of the listeners listening to the helper and not the reader, and we must therefore assume the makrei in our case is reading out of the Torah and not a chumash. But he then goes on to defend the idea that the makrei is reading out of a chumash by saying he is not reading at the same time as the Olah, and one need not worry about the aforementioned fear.</p>\n\n<p>Your case as clarified is not called a Torah reading and no blessing should be made on it. In fact, if the one standing in front of the open Torah had actually been reading out of the Torah, but for some reason unable to be corrected from mixing up words like Cheilev and chalav, this too is not called a Torah reading according to some. But the Torah should be read anyway without a blessing, see Mishna Berurah siman 142 #7.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why put Psalm 130 right before barchu?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've seen the custom quoted in many siddurim to recite <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16351\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalm 130</a> (שיר המעלות ממעמקים), with the Ark open, between ישתבח and ברכו during עשרת ימי תשובה. This particular Psalm was chosen because <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/45911/5323\">it's very apropos for the time period</a>, since it deals with forgiveness for sins.</p>\n\n<p>Given that, why say it particularly there? Is there something special about that part of davening?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If we want to add this to our prayer this is practically the best place. Before Baruch She'amar is before we start, especially in Nusach Ashkenaz, and would not be an actual part of the prayer. After Shmona Esrei is too late. We can't add it to Birchas Krias Shma and we don't want to add something to Psukei d'Zimra either, being that it is considered a Bracha. </p>\n\n<p>Pesukei d'Zimra is where we recite chapters of Tehillim and so it fits best as being attached to it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why doesn't this gemara interpret the mishna as meaning they sell it back?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=120&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shabbos 120a</a>, the Mishna (first Mishna there) is quoted as saying that after Shabbat, the people who save things from a fire (which become <em>hefker</em>, ownerless) can make up their payment with the owner. The gemara asks what kind of people these are, that they would want payment for their work on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, why didn't the gemara interpret the mishna as saying that the owner buys back the things, and this way, they are paid for their troubles, in a way that is entirely halachic (not even a hint of being wrong).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mishna says that if they are <em>wise</em> they would <em>make a deal</em> with the owner after Shabbat. </p>\n\n<p>If it's theirs, then why can't they keep it? As Rashi says  ואם פקחים הם יעכבו הכל הוה ליה למיתני.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara also says:  חשבון מאי עבידתיה מהפקירא קזכו</p>\n\n<p>IOW: The gemara is asking \"why discuss what happens after Shabbat?\". It's theirs. Why are you \"wise\" if you sell your own [extra] property?</p>\n\n<p>So the Gemara wants to come up with something better than saying that it means \"they sell it back\".</p>\n\n\n",

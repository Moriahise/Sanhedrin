    "content": "# Why was Yom HaShoah not established as a fast day?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why was Yom HaShoah, the memorial day for the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, not established as a fast day?  That would be consistent as we fast on other days when we commemorate past mass destruction and murder.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This is because Yom HaShoah is held on the 27th of Nissan, and it is <a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/41334/#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">halachically forbidden to establish a fast during the month of Nissan.</a> (the fast of the firstborn does not fall under this prohibition).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In our kinnos (kinnah 25, about the first crusade) the paytan writes: \"שימו נא על לבבכם מספד מר לקשרה, כי שקולה הריגתם להתאבל ולהתעפרה, כשרפת בית אלקנו האולם והבירה, וכי אין להוסיף מועד שבר ותבערה, ואין להקדים זולתי לאחרה, תחת כן היום לויתי אעוררה\"</p>\n<p>It was for this reason certain gedolim in Europe didn't want to establish a new day for Churban Europa. Another source for this same idea can be found in Rashi on Divrei Hayamim 2 (35:25).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Similar to the already answered answers, in the sefer הדור והתקופה page 65 it is brought down that when the Israeli Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Hertzog came to speak to Rabbi Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik, the Brisker Rav, about setting a fast day for the horrific events of the Shoah, the Brisker Rav responded by quoting Rabbeinu Klonimus' Kinna \"אין להוסיף מועד שבר\".\nAt that time the Eida Chareidis didn't join the Rabbanut in their call to establish a fast day, and it seems that that was the reason for the Rabbanut to not try and create a fast day.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in the book פאר הדור ח\"ג עמוד קכ\"ד it is brought that Rabbi Binyamin Mendelsohn asked the חזון איש why we don't establish a fast day for the Shoah, even though the ט\"ז established one for גזירות ת\"ח ות\"ט. The חזון איש responded that firstly, it is not clear in the ט\"ז and additionally,  we are not on the מדריגה of the ט\"ז to copy him.</p>\n<p>For further reference see שיחות בהלכה (Brooklyn,NY 2022) pages 81-83.</p>\n<p>This Sefer also mentions the halachic issue of setting such a date in Nissan.</p>\n\n\n",

Different halachic views on whether a food will be a fruit or vegetable will depend on which part of the tree withers away during the winter months (if at all), and consequently when/where the fruit will fall off and regrow again.</p>\n<p>For example, the accepted view is that only if the third part, the part where the fruit grows upon, is the one which regrows each time, whereas the rest of the tree remains standing the entire year, only then it is considered a fruit. So grapes grow on a vine, which has branches on which the grapes grow, while the rest of the vine remains throughout the entire year, thus rendering them fruits according to Halacha.</p>\n<p>With bananas, however, the entire branch on which the bananas grow, withers away and regrows and therefore they are considered vegetables for these intents and purposes.</p>\n<p>Of course the terms \"fruit\" and \"vegetable\" are relevant mostly for the sake of knowing which bracha/blessing to make on the said food.

    "content": "# Gathering of the tribes: contradiction between Rambam and mefarshim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is a well known principle that <strong>Moshiach</strong> will gather all the people that are in exile, and bring them into Eretz Yisrael (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.11.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshayahu 11:12</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.11.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah Hilchos Melachim uMilchamot 11:1][1]</a>).</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yisachar Shlomo Teichtal in his work \"Em Habanim Smeicha\" (p. 47) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The essential point is that <strong>Hashem is waiting for us to take the initiative</strong>, to desire and long for the return to Eretz Yisrael. <strong>He does not want us to wait for Him to bring us there</strong>. that is to say, when we, of our own volition, truly and with all our strength, desire and strive to return to the Land, then G-d will bring our work to an succesful end. (emphasis mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Rav Teichtal, G-d does not want us to wait until exile ends, but wants us to return to Zion instead.</p>\n<p>There is a similair statement that can be found in the commentary of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.30.3?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Haamek Davar on Devarim 30:3</a>. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And gather you from all of the nations: <strong>After the main exile returns\nfrom the nations</strong>, the Lord will return to gather the small pockets\namong the nations where the Lord scattered you. Likewise did Ramban\nwrite 1 in his commentary on Song of Songs (8:12), \"you may have the\nthousand, O Solomon\" - <strong>that at first, there will be a partial\ngathering of the exiles with the permission of the governments.</strong> And\nafterwards, the Lord will bring back His hand a second time, as it is\nwritten, \"and He will return and gather you.\" (emphasis mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Micah.4.8?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> says that the exiled will begin to return to Zion.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>He will build the Sanctuary and gather in the dispersed of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There seems to be a contradiction in these two statements.</p>\n<p>My question is: How does this fit with the famous statement of the Rambam, namely that all of the above is done by Moshiach? Are there any mefarshim (commentaries on this Rambam or else) that discusses this contradiction? On the one hand, Hashem wants us to return (according to the above mentioned sources), but according to the Rambam and many explanations from a \"Satmar-perspective\" we are meant to wait until Moshiach takes us \"from the four cornes of the world\", as we pray daily.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The answer to these contradictory statements: The future is not decided yet.</p>\n<p>Certain incidents that are definitively meant to occur are decided. For example, Moshiach coming is a definite future event. If you lived 4000 years ago, then the Exodus from Egypt was a definite future event.</p>\n<p>But there can be a billion different ways that Moshiach can come. He can come wearing a suit or while eating a sandwich etc. He can come while Biden is President or while Trump us President.\nThe \" how do we get there \" part is not decided and depends on us; because of free choice.</p>\n<p>There could have been a billion different ways the exodus could have happened. It wasnt necessary that it should have happened after a lot of suffering. The suffering could have come in the form of anguish at living outside the land of Canaan.</p>\n<p>Same way , the ingathering of the exiles is bound to happen but how it will unfold  is not set in stone. This is one of the reasons why even when prophets prophesied, they couldn't clearly see every detail of future events. This is because the lesser motions that help realise something big like the destruction of the temple for example, were not set in stone.</p>\n<p>But it is upto you personally to put in motion a certain chain of events. You can make Aliyah with the kavvana that you are beginning the ingathering of the exiles or you can stay where you are and pray for the ingathering of the exiles. Either way, it will happen. We just dont know if it will be through you or someone else.</p>\n<p>Everything I said here is from the Rambam more or less.</p>\n\n\n",

Same as if they signed an agreement to buy/sell a \"keg\" of beer, then afterwards they each had a plausible source for a different size of \"keg.\" That's still enforceable; this happens all the time in monetary cases where one side claims <em>kim li</em> -- I follow Rabbi so-and-so.

This latter explanation cannot be correct as what is described here occurred only in the second year of the people’s being in the desert, and we have no evidence that Joshua who was only about 24 years younger than Moses already served in that function in Egypt. I believe that the proper explanation is that Joshua was one of several men who attended to Moses’ needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.11.28?lang=bi&with=Avot%20D%27Rabbi%20Natan&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot D'Rabbi Natan 27:4</a>, it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everyone should learn from Moses our teacher, who said to Joshua (Exodus 17:9), “Choose men for us.” He did not say: Choose for me, but “choose for us.” This teaches that Moses treated Joshua like an equal, even though Moses was the master and Joshua was his student.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this we can learn that this pasuk means that Moshe Rabbeinu equated Yehoshua with himself.

The source for this is found in Numbers 12,11 where Aaron, Moses' older brother, addresses him with the words: בי אדוני, \"Please my lord!\" The honour of one's teacher should be treated as equivalent to the honour of G–d Himself. We derive this from Numbers 11,28 where Joshua pleads with Moses to kill Eldod and Meydod for prophesying the death of Moses. The words used are: אדוני משה כלאם. Joshua felt that insubordination against his teacher Moses deserved the same penalty as insubordination against G–d Himself. We can now understand why we are taught in Avot 4,1: \"Who is truly honoured? He who honours G–d's creatures.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In contrast, \"the abode of the divine soul is in the brains ... [and] also in the heart, in the right ventricle\". However, Tanya also maintains that the animal soul and divine soul <em>each</em> have three intellectual faculties and seven emotional faculties (\"Just as the divine soul consists of ten holy sefirot ... the soul of sitra achara consists of ... ten 'crowns of impurity'\" (Chapter 6)).</p>\n<p>Does this mean the animal soul's intellectual faculties abide in the heart?

For this, it is often recommended to appeal to a knowledgeable individual who can make the concepts clear to the student.</p>\n<p>In this case, \"abode/abides\" does not mean so in even the slightest literal sense. It means that the essence of the intellectual power of an individual is what serves as the primary vessel for the GS's dwelling. On the other hand, the coarseness of the heart is the primary vessel for the AS.</p>\n<p>Does this negate the fact that either soul can make use of the intellectual or emotional powers of the body? Of course not! It merely points to where their natures lie. Intellect is objective. A person can argue and say, \"Well, I disagree!

This is thus where the AS finds its roots - in the \"I\" exist part of things. A person with this inclination, can of course use his brains - but it will be with a strong interest/subjectiveness towards what HE decides to understand...like those people who use very intellectually-sounding nonsense to excuse their own ideas (but when faced with opposing facts will often cower behind their \"logical\" ideas as though they were being intellectual).</p>\n<p>You get the gist...</p>\n\n\n",

He reckoned that if Hashem let him go there, perhaps Hashem annulled his decree of not entering E\"Y, and (putting in the interpretation of the sifsei chachamim) with prayer, perhaps Hashem would let him enter eretz yisroel proper.</p>\n<p>This is why Moshe prayed to enter E\"Y. Aharon, was niftar in parshas Chukas prior to Klal Yisroel entering עבר הירדן, and never considered that perhaps Hashem annulled his decree (Bamidbar 20,12) of not entering E\"Y.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Toldos Yitzchak (Rabbi Yitzchak Karo) offers two answers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Moshe's purpose to enter E\"Y was in order to fulfill the mitzvos התלויות בארץ.Because Ahron (being a Kohen) was to gain from those, as the Kohanim get many of the products of these Mitzvos (Teruma, Challa...), Ahron was afraid that people will say that he only wants to enter E\"Y for that purpose.</li>\n<li>Moshe wasn't zoche that his children should succeed him as leaders of Klal Yisroel so he wanted to enter. Ahron's children , on the other hand, succeeded him with the Kehuna which sufficed for him.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do Chazal refer to the emergence of a baby from the womb as pesichas hakever\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A term throughout <em>Chazal</em> is פתיחת הקבר, <em>pesichas hakever</em>, translated literally as the opening of the grave. For example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.21a.19?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah 21a</a>. This term refers to the emergence of a fetus or baby from the womb (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Niddah.21a.19.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi ad. loc.</a>, Aruch § קבר [1]).</p>\n<p>Why did Chazal refer to the womb, רחם, as a קבר, a grave?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Refer to the Gemoro in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.92a.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 92a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ר' טבי אמר ר' יאשיה מאי דכתיב (משלי ל, טז) שאול ועוצר רחם ארץ לא שבעה מים וכי <strong>מה ענין שאול אצל רחם אלא לומר לך מה רחם מכניס ומוציא אף שאול מכניס ומוציא</strong></p>\n<p>§ The Gemara returns to the topic of the source for resurrection in the Torah. Rabbi Tavi says that Rabbi Yoshiya says: What is the meaning of that which is written: “There are three that are never satisfied…the grave, and the barren womb, and earth that does not receive sufficient water” (Proverbs 30:15–16)? And what does a grave have to do with a womb? Rather, they are juxtaposed to say to you: <strong>Just as a womb takes in and gives forth, so too a grave takes in and also gives forth, with the resurrection of the dead</strong>. (Sefaria translation and notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alternatively, the womb is to be seen as a child's \"ticket\" out to the world. Providing it is open, there is access to the world but once closed that's it. It can be seen an expression that is relevant to the unfortunate circumstance where there is a still birth. In such a situation the child is essentially born dead and thus the womb is its grave - For example, refer to the Mishnah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Oholot.7.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohalos 7:4</a></p>\n<p>Building on this line of thinking, we can quote <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.20.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 20:17</a>, where it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־מוֹתְתַ֖נִי מֵרָ֑חֶם וַתְּהִי־לִ֤י אִמִּי֙ קִבְרִ֔י וְרַחְמָ֖הֿ הֲרַ֥ת עוֹלָֽם</p>\n<p>Because he did not kill me before birth so that my mother might be my grave, and her womb big [with me] for all time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Radak writes there the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאם מותתני קודם צאתי מרחם היתה לי אמי קברי</p>\n<p>That if I was dead before I came out of the womb that my mother would be my grave.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In the Mishnaic manuscripts, some Bavli girsaot, alternate versions, etc. this is clear. The fullest version is found in the Sifrei Devarim, where the two are interrupted by other material:מה ת\"ל בכל מאדך בכל מדה ומדה שהוא מודד לך, בין במדת הטוב בין במדת הפורענות . . . ובכל מאדך הוי מודה לו כיעקב אביך שנ' קטנתי מכל החסידים (This is the version from MS Vat. 32; also found in Yalkut Shimoni). A shorter version is found in all Mishnaic manuscripts (Kaufmann A50, de Rossi 138, Cambridge Add. 470.1), which is very similar to the printed girsa quoted above except with בכל used for framing the second drasha: דבר אחר בכל מאודך בכל מידה ומידה שהוא מודד לך בכל הוי מודה לו בכל מאד מאד. Here there is the same division between the drashas, but the second is framed as an explanation of בכל instead of מאודיך. This was further shortened to דבר אחר בכל מאודך בכל מידה ומידה שהוא מודד לך בכל הוי מודה לו מאד מאד, where the keyword is repeated to introduce the drasha but not found within the drasha itself, which is what's found in many Bavli manuscripts, some Mishnaic printings, the Lekach Tov, etc., and finally the keyword was lost, blurring the distinction between the two drashos. Melekhet Shlomo, for one, knows that this is important and reinserts it. The wordplay used in the second drasha isn't helpful for clarity either.</p>\n<p>Tl;dr it should be translated <strong>Another explanation: \"With all your <em>m'ods</em>,\" i.e. with every <em>mida</em> by which G-d measures you. [\"With <em>all</em> your m'ods\"], i.e. Confess to him with utter completeness.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

If the woman then proceeds to have a child with another man, the child is not a mamzer. A mazer would be if a Jewish man and woman got halachically married, and then the woman had a child with another man without divorcing her husband.</p>\n<p>I do recall my 9th grade rebbi saying that there is a teshuva from R' Moshe that a Jewish man and woman living together for a long enough time with other people witnessing may constitute a marriage, with the people witnessing being the witnesses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How would this change if the husband or wife had been previously\nmarried?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So technically in halacha a man can have more than one wife, so the man being married to another woman would not be a problem. A woman, however, can only have one husband. So if the woman had been halachically married to a man and never got a divorce, any child from this new relationship would be a mamzer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How about if both parents are Jewish but they signed a kesubah with\ninvalid witnesses?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are 2 parts of a halachic marriage; kiddushin, where the husband gives something of value to the woman and says 'haray at mikudeshes li bitabas zu', and nisuin, where the marriage is consumated.</p>\n<p>I would think it would still be a marriage as long as the kiddushin happened that would go through even without a kesuba, making the woman married to the man.

But isn’t it written: “And they shall stumble one upon another” (Leviticus 26:37)?

And, if a group of people sins, they all recieve the brunt of the punishment. However, he gives three examples of instances when it would appear as though one person/group committed a sin, yet others who didn't sin join in bearing the punishment. 1) a father who sins, the family is punished. 2) a king who sins, the nation is punished. 3) a group within a city sins, the whole city is punished, even those who did not take part in the sin. He then says that all three of these make sense logically and also have scriptural support.</p>\n<p>I hope this was helpful.</p>\n\n\n",

I could not find any Oral Torah law that states this, and the proponents of this theory do not provide one themselves.

Certainly a farm containing both cows and pigs would prevent a Jew from buying a bucket of milk from the farmer, as how do we know it's all cow milk in this bucket?

All three of your sources list kindnesses that G-d granted to the Jews. Matan Torah is the crucial event in Jewish history, but it is not that kind of event. Rather, it imposed an obligation. That is why at Matan Torah, G-d referred to the Exodus in the first commandment, to justify the Jews' level of obligation as being the reason for that kindness.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Although your assumption that any summary of key events would include Matan Torah would seemingly be correct like we find in the Haggada by Dayeinu, the cases you mention are not necessarily summaries of grand events.</p>\n<p>Devarim 26 is explaining why we are bringing Bikkurim and for that the only things that are relevant are the events of leaving Egypt and receiving Eretz Yisroel.</p>\n<p>Yehoshua 24 is explaining the reason to heed the Torah and serve Hashem because of all the kindness he did with us in taking us out of Egypt and throughout the midbar and giving us Eretz Yisroel. To say that you need to heed the Torah because Hashem gave us the Torah would seem counterintuitive.</p>\n<p>The one place that does seem to summarize the kindness of Hashem is Psalm 136. However, for this there can be a simple answer based on the Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.118a.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 118A</a>. The Gemara explains the 26 verses are parallels to the 26 generations that Hashem sustained the world before the Torah was given. If so, it is self explanatory why the Torah isn’t mentioned as one of the kindness’s.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בֶּן לֵוִי: הָנֵי עֶשְׂרִים וְשִׁשָּׁה ״הוֹדוּ״, כְּנֶגֶד מִי — כְּנֶגֶד עֶשְׂרִים וְשִׁשָּׁה דּוֹרוֹת שֶׁבָּרָא הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא בְּעוֹלָמוֹ וְלֹא נָתַן לָהֶם תּוֹרָה, וְזָן אוֹתָם בְּחַסְדּוֹ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: These twenty-six mentions of the word hodu, give praise, in this hallel (Psalms 136), to what do they correspond? He explains: They correspond to the twenty-six generations that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created in His world, and to whom He did not give the Torah. There were ten generations from Adam to Noah, another ten from Noah to Abraham, and six generations from Abraham to Moses and the revelation at Sinai, i.e., Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kehat, Amram, and Moses. And why did these generations survive, despite the fact that they did not learn Torah or perform mitzvot? They survived only because God sustained them through His mercy, even though they were undeserving.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(והמגן אברהם סעיף קטן ב' קיצר בזה. דוודאי להרמב\"ם כן הוא, אבל לרש\"י ותוספות וודאי חייבות בכל התפילות כאנשים ובזמנן. ותלמידי רבנו יונה כתבו: אף על פי שיש לה זמן קבוע, אפילו הכי כיון שאמרו הלואי שיתפלל אדם כל היום כולו – כאין הזמן גרמא דיינינן לה, ולפיכך נשים חייבות. אי נמי: מפני שהוא רחמים. עד כאן לשונם. ולא ידענא טעם הראשון למאי צריך? דלרש\"י ותוספות הא מפורש הטעם משום דרחמי נינהו, ולהרי\"ף והרמב\"ם לא קשה כלל. וצריך לומר דסבירא להו דהיא דרבנן, ולפניהם לא היה הגירסא \"דרחמי נינהו\", והוה קשה להו: הא הזמן גרמא? וסבירא להו כתוספות דגם בדרבנן שייך זמן גרמא. ולזה תרצו שני תירוצים: ולתירוץ ראשון יש לומר דנשים לא נתחייבו רק פעם ביום, כמו להרמב\"ם. והלבוש כתב טעם אחר לגמרי, עיין שם. וזה וודאי תימא: שהרי ראה גירסת רש\"י ותוספות \"דרחמי נינהו\", וגם בבה\"ג יש טעם זה וכן בירושלמי, עיין שם. ולפי זה בדוחק יש ליישב מה שנשים שלנו אינן זהירות בכל השלוש תפילות לשיטת רש\"י ותוספות, ולהרי\"ף והרמב\"ם אתי שפיר. ודייק ותמצא קל.)</p>\n<p>And this is definitely true that according to Rashi, women are required to pray three times a day, the same way men are obligated, since according to him, there is no difference in Rabbinical law [regarding prayer] between a time-bound (which women are mostly exempt from Biblically) and a non-time-bound obligation. Tosfot would opine similarly, since according to their view, the Talmud explicitly states: although [prayer is] a time-bound obligation, nonetheless, since [the drive to pray stems from a universal human tendency] to seek [G-d's] mercy, the Rabbis obligated them, and naturally, they are obligated the same way men are. However, according to Rif and the Rambam, whose text [of the Talmud] does not include the reasoning that [the obligation to pray stems from a universal human tendency] to seek [G-d's] mercy, rather, argue that [women] are obligated Biblically [in prayer] since it is not a time-bound commandment, would naturally say that [women] are only required [to pray] once daily and [can choose any words they desire express prayer] (lit. \"in any textual version\"). It is impossible to say that the Rabbinic decree to pray three times daily and in [their obligated] time applies to [women] as well, for if that were so, why would the Talmud [rhetorically] reply \"But that is obvious?!\" (to the Mishna's statement that women are obligated in prayer, See Aruch HaShulchan : Chelek 1 : Siman 106 : 5)? [That rhetorical question is not logically sensible since the Mishna's statement is not at all obvious] rather it teaches us a great deal! Really, what I previously wrote is the correct way [to explain the matter].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, in the end, the Gemara rejects this reasoning and says it’s simply because one cannot have benefit from this world without blessing first (according to some this is only drabbanan). He explains that initially, the Gemara thought the blessing was to give thanks and praise for the food you ate, in which case the kal vchomer stands. However, the Gemara determines at the end that the blessing is to avoid a feeling of haughtiness and control that inevitably comes when one is full and satisfied. By making the blessing, after eating, the person is reminded that it’s all from Hashem. Therefore, the bracha beforehand is not connected to this at all, and is only drabbanan.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומסיק שם דברכה שלפניה הוא דרבנן, וכן בד\"ת. וטעמא נראה, דאם נעיין על התשלום על גמול הטוב שגמל לו הקב\"ה, אז הוא קו\"ח מעליא מה על חיי שעה מברך על חיי עולם לא כש\"כ, וכן מה כשהוא שבע מברך כשהוא רעב לא כש\"כ, שזה תודה וברכה עבור גמולו הטוב שגמל אליו השי\"ת. אך באמת אין הברכה על זה בלבד, רק הוא ענין ומכוון אחר, שכשאוכל ושבע, אז הוא עלול לבעט, וכמוש\"א אכלת שבעת כו' שכחת שם ד' אלדיך מלי כריסי זני בישי (ברכות ל\"ב), לכן צוה השי\"ת שכשיאכל וישבע יזכיר שם אלוד' בתודה ויברכנהו ויזכור כי הוא הנותן לך כח לעשות חיל ומידו לוקח האוכל למלאות נפשו כי ירעב, וזה שאמר בסמוך השמר לך פן תשכח כו' פן תאכל ושבעת כו' ורם לבבך ושכחת וזכרת כו' כי הוא הנותן לך כח לעשות חיל, הראה לנו טעם הברכה שלא יקשיח לבבו מדרכי השי\"ת ועדותיו, וזה יתכן דוקא כשהוא שבע לא כשהוא רעב</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You will eat and be full and you will bless Hashem. This is thanksgiving, for the great kindness that Hashem gives each individual. However, the truth is that the blessing is not only for this purpose … When a person eats and is full, he is more likely to rebel against Hashem … therefore Hashem commanded that when a person eats and is satisfied he should mentions Hashem and offer Him thanks by blessing Him. In this way the person will remember who gave him the strength to act, and from whose Hand he takes the food to ease his hunger. This explains the connection to the following verse, “Look out for yourself lest you forget Hashem, your God … Lest you eat and be full …” (Sefaria, not a full translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I can’t say this is a consensus explanation, it is definitely an explanation from a reputable source.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "How does Torah learning without working fit in to Jewish thought?",
    "content": "# How does Torah learning without working fit in to Jewish thought?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently I posted a question on the order of removal of tefillin.  I am most grateful for the  responses. I subsequently read in ETHICS FROM SINAI by Reb Irving M. Bunim Z”TL. Perek II, Mishnah 2 the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Rabban Gamliel, the son of Rabbi Yehudah ha-Nai, said: It is good to\ncombine the study of Torah with an occupation, for the exertion of\nboth keeps sin forgotten. All Torah study that is not accompanied by\nwork will come to nothing and bring sin its wake.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The essential point of Reb Bunim's commentary is that at the Giving of the Torah the people  “responded vibrantly, and in unity, ‘na’aseh v’nishma—We will do and we will understand’ (SHEMOT 24:7). <strong>This is the twofold program of Judaism: doing and learning, studying the precepts of Torah and then weaving them into everyday lives, in our worldly pursuits.</strong> The two tefillin symbolize this. On the arm, they connote na’aseh, our readiness to act; on the head, to symbolize nishma, our learning. We put on the tefillin of the hand first and remove it last; the tefillin of the head is never alone. The significance is: Judaism rejects learning without doing.  Judaism cannot live and grow in the mental hothouse of an ivory tower. The Torah insists on thought for action, study for observing the mizvos.”</p>\n<p>So from the wording of the mishnah and the commentary it seems that Torah study must be accompanied by a worldly occupation. Yet, I believe that some engage only in Torah learning without working.</p>\n<p>How does Torah learning without working fit in to Jewish thought?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein writes in Igros Moshe Y”D chelek 4 siman 36 that the shitah of the Rambam is not quite what it would appear to be from simply reading the one halacha in hilchos talmud torah perek 3 halacha 10 where it seems like he would strongly disapprove of someone learning in a system like a modern kollel . This is because in the very next halacha he writes that it is simply a “ma’alah gedolah” to earn your own money. Rav Moshe learns that there are two levels of the mitzvah of talmud torah (according to the Rambam at least, he brings down a dissenting view from Tosfos in Makkos, ayin sham). One level is for ordinary folks and that only requires a little learning in the morning and a little at night. For such a person halacha 10 is the appropriate way of life. However, for someone who is matzliach in their learning and wants to learn, it is the biggest kiddush HaShem out there to be nisparnes from tzedakah to learn.</p>\n<p>It’s a fascinating teshuva, albeit a little long. Very much worth everyone’s while to read. And everyone should see it inside because I was mekatzer a lot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I would like to start from the quote you cite in your question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the twofold program of Judaism: <strong>doing and learning</strong>, studying the precepts of Torah and <strong>then weaving them into everyday lives</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last part, e.g. \"weaving them into everyday lives\" is exactly the point the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.2?lang=bi&with=Rabbeinu%20Yonah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Yonah</a> brings in his commentary on the Mishnah (Avos 2:2). He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And all [study of the] Torah in the absence of a worldly occupation comes to nothing in the end: Like the matter that they said in our treatise (Avot 3 17), \"If there is no flour, there is no Torah.\" The matter is like its simple understanding - <strong>when he neglects work, it brings him to poverty and it drags along several sins and its evil is great</strong>. As on account of it, he will 'love gifts and not live,' and flatter people even if they are evildoers, in order that they give to him. Also <strong>when the money from the gifts runs out, he will become a thief or a kidnapper</strong> (or gambler) and will bring 'home loot taken from the poor' so that he not die of hunger. <strong>And when a person reaches these traits, his spirit knows no restraint and he will not rest and not be still until he transgresses all of the commandments that are stated in the Torah</strong>, since 'one sin brings along [another] sin.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mishnah says <em>\"for toil in them both keeps sin out of one’s mind\"</em>. This can be explained by what the Rabbeinu Yonah writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and he will not rest and not be still until he transgresses all of the commandments that are stated in the Torah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If one does not learn Torah, and works, there is a chance that he will eventually transgress mitzvos. If one does not accept how much he earns, he might get involved in criminal behaviour, like stealing etc... The Torah teaches us that that is a forbidden act. Hence combining those two (learning and doing) is better than only one, since one does not know how to implement what he learned in real life.</p>\n<p>I'll give you a parable: if you learn all the halachos concerning lashon hara and know what falls under the categories of lashon hara. That's great. However, imagine working with a few people who are known to be people that speak a lot of lashon hara about other people. You join them during lunch, and hear them speak some lashon hara. They ask you \"what do you think?\". What will your answer/action be? That depends on if you can combine the Torah with the daily life. Knowing the halachos is a must, but you'll need to implemenmt those laws into your own life. Torah is called \"Toras Chayim\",   Torah of life.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.2?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bartenura</a> explains that if one only learns Torah, without any occupation (work), at some point, the person needs food and because he has no work, so no income, he needs to steal the bread.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.2?lang=bi&with=Orchot%20Tzadikim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orchos Tzadikkim (9:37)</a> writes:\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, if a man were freed from the necessity of work and did not have to trouble himself about his sustenance, he would kick out against all restraint and pursue wrongdoing as it is written : \"When Jeshurun prospered, he kicked\" (Deut. 32:15). And our Sages said : \"The study of the Torah is good when combined with making a living, for the exertion necessary for both activities causes one to forget all thought of sinning\" (Aboth 2:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2835414/jewish/Chapter-Two.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vedibarta Bam</a>, Rav Bogomilsky gives another interpretation.

See the footnote at the beginning of Gate 4 for a discussion of what “involvement with Torah” means to Rav Chayyim., to be involved [instead] with earning a living, during which time he would be completely lacking involvement with Torah (heaven forefend). However, Rabbi Yishmael hinted in his holy statement: “behave in them per the ways of the world,” to imply “with them” i.e., with the words of Torah—that at the same brief moment and time that you occupy yourself with earning a living to the extent necessary to stay alive, even so, in your thoughts you should be preoccupied only with the words of Torah.</p>\n<p>And there it is stated that many did per Rabbee Yishmael’s directions and they succeeded, and many did per Rabbee Shim’on Bar Yo-khai’s words and they did not succeed. It says specifically “many” because definitely, for most of the masses it’s nearly impossible that they could dedicate all of their time only to involvement with Torah, to not turn away from it even a brief time for the sake of earning a living sustenance203Heb.: par-na-saht m’zo-note. And about this the sages stated in Avot: “that all Torah that is not accompanied by labor...”. But an individual, if it’s possible for him to only be involved his entire lifetime with his Torah and his service to the One (blessed be His name), the obligation is definitely upon him to not separate even a brief time from Torah and service to earn a living (heaven forefend), in accordance with Rabbee Shim’on Bar Yo-khai’s opinion [*].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Ovadia has said this in various drashot and shiurim that he has given. Here is how it was transcribed from a drasha, collected in a volume of mussar called <em>Ma'adanei Ha-Melekh</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הכרתי תלמידי חכמים גאונים שלא הורגלו בצעירותם לכתוב, וכשהיו אחר כך בגדלותם כותבים, היו יוצאים הדברים מסורסים מהופכים ומבולבלים, הם בעצמם לא היה נוח להם במה שכתבו ולא היו שבעי רצון, כיון שלא הורגלו</p>\n<p>אומרים 'וקָנה לך חבר', בקמץ. כשאתה לומד לבד הדברים אינם ברורים, אתה\nלומד עם חבר, אתה מסביר לו והוא מסביר לך, אתה מתווכח אתו</p>\n<p>העט שלך הוא חברך והוא מתווכח אתך, אמנם אתה מכתיב לו, לא הוא מושל עליך,\nאבל התרחבות הדברים מרחיבה את דעתך ומעמידה אותך על האמת, כשמתחיל לכתוב\nרואה אין דמיון בין זה לזה, וכך הוא מגיע באמת לגופו של הלכה. ולכן כמה\nזה חשוב שאדם ירגיל את עצמו לכתוב</p>\n<p>I knew students of genius scholars who didn't write in their youth, and when they later grew up and started writing, the words would come out garbled, distorted and confused. They themselves weren't comfortable with what they wrote and weren't satisfied because they were not used to it.</p>\n<p>They say 'acquire [kanei] for yourself a friend', with\na <em>kamatz</em> vowel under the word acquire [meaning quill]. When you study alone things\nare not clear. But when you study with a friend, you explain to him\nand he explains to you, and you argue with him.</p>\n<p>Your pen is your friend and he argues with you. Even though you\ndictate to him what to write, he does not rule over you, but the\nexpansion of words expands your knowledge and positions you toward the\ntruth. When one starts writing, one sees that there is no similarity\nbetween one another, and thus he really reaches the body of Halakha.\nThat is why it is so important that a person gets used to writing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And here are his words, also in <em>Ma'adanei Ha-Melekh</em>, from another drasha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל אחד ישתדל כפי כוחו להעמיק בתורה, וגם יקיים בעצמו 'וקָנה לך חבר', זהו העט שיהיה חברך. אם אין לך חברותא, כתוב את הדברים וחזור עליהם. בדרך כלל אדם שמבין היטב את הסוגיא יכול לשכחה אחרי כמה ימים, אך לא כן אם ירשמנה יזכור בדיוק את כולה</p>\n<p>Everyone should strive as hard as he can to delve deeper into the Torah. He will also fulfill by himself the mitzvah 'acquire for yourself a friend.' This is the pen that will be your friend. If you don't have a ḥevruta, write the words down and repeat them. Usually, a person who understands well the sugya can forget it after a few days, but not if he writes it down. He will remember it exactly in its entirety.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And the Creator, may He be blessed, commanded that this light first be brought down into the brain through the head tefillin and that the brain, and the soul in it, be refined through it. Then it expands afterwards to the heart through the arm tefillin that is across from it, so that it too is refined by it.</strong> And through this, it comes out that man is completely included in the drawing down of this holiness to all of his characteristics; he is crowned by it and attains a great holiness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This all might be the reason why the evil kingdom of Rome once issued a decree that one who was wearing the tefillin shel rosh, was going to be pierced through the brains, as the Gemara notes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mei_HaShiloach%2C_Volume_I%2C_Deuteronomy%2C_Ki_Teitzei.8?ven=Living_waters,_the_Mei_HaShiloach._Trans._and_edited_by_Betsalel_Philip_Edwards,_Jerusalem,_J._Aronson_2001_%5BRevised_digital_edition,_2021%5D&lang=bi&p2=Shabbat.49a.7&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Shabbos 49a, cited by the Mei HaShiloach, volume 1, Devarim, Ki Teitzei)</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara asks: And why did they call Elisha Man of Wings?

Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai encouraged his students to \"raise their hands in prayer\", exactly the way evangelicals do now. When idol worshippers began to pray using the same gesture, Chazal had the Jews stop (as an interesting side note, the Ethopian Jews were not in contact with the rest of Am Yisrael by that time and continue praying with their hands raised to this day).</p>\n<p>In the Beit HaMikdash and even in reglar synagogues we prayed kneeling on the floor. Once idol worshippers adopted this practice, it, too became prohibited, though as @robev pointed out, since this was the derech tefillah in the Beit HaMikdash it will be permitted there when possible (may it be soon!).</p>\n<p>These were our two main forms of prayer for centuries, and now such practices are <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1508300/jewish/Do-Jews-Kneel-in-Prayer.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">forbidden</a>.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The commentaries on that Rashi ask a similar question: If we cannot use a single-stone altar because the non-Jews use it, why aren't we forbidden from using a many stone altar, as the non-Jews also do?</p>\n<p>The Ramban and Mizrachi answer that while they did use altars occasionally, they always used pillars, in every temple. Thus, pillars were strongly identified with idol worship in temples, but altars were not.</p>\n<p>The Maharal says that altars were standard and universal, but pillars were specifically associated with idol worship. Something universal does not become forbidden because idol-worshippers use it, because it does not become identified with them. Pillars were more unusual, and thus became identified with idol worship.</p>\n<p>So this would answer your question too. Things like kneeling and lifting up of hands which are associated with churches were discontinued, as the previous answer pointed out. Praying in general is universal and not just done in churches or as part of idol worship, so it is ok.</p>\n\n\n",

The <a href=\"https://laeruv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/la-eruv-booklet-5782-EMAIL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">official policy of the Los Angeles Eiruv</a> is that,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You should never assume that the eruv is “UP”\nfor Shabbos.

It seems to imply you do not have to assume that those sources are wrong. Moreover, and far more interesting, if the Eruv is down and others can not fix it, they have a duty to <strong>NOT</strong> inform you,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the eruv cannot be fixed, this should not be announced publicly. This information is withheld out of concern that some people will carry anyway, desecrating Shabbat knowingly, and it is better that they transgress unknowingly rather than knowingly. The only people who should be informed are those who will definitely follow the halakha and refrain from carrying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it seems the only time the Eruv can be announced down is if it can be reasonably fixed which means checking can only ever cause a minor inconvenience: that's it's better for you to err in ignorance is explicit.</p>\n\n\n",

This is alluded to [in the verse] \"And these words shall be...<strong>on your heart</strong>.\"</p>\n<p>(Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Parenthetically, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.24.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah</a> at this point tells us about taking the tzitzis also in the right hand during the third paragraph of Shema:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ביד שמאלית - כתוב בכתבי האר\"י ז\"ל שיאחזם בין קמיצה לזרת וכשיגיע לפרשת ציצית יקחם גם ביד ימין ויביט בהם ויהיו בידו עד שמגיע לנאמנים ונחמדים לעד ואז ינשק הציצית ויסירם מידו</p>\n<p>With your left hand - It is written in the writings of the Arizal that [one should] hold them (the Tzitzit strings) between the ring and pinky fingers. And when you get to the Parsha of ציצית, take them also in your right hand and gaze at them. And they should remain in your hands until you reach [the words] \"נאמנים ונחמדים לעד\"... at which point you kiss the Tzitzit and release them from your hands.</p>\n<p>(Sefaria translation))</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see that part of the rationale for at least starting holding the tzitzis in the left hand is because it is opposite the heart which hints how we should make the words \"על לבבך\" \"on your heart\". Also refer to the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3269376/jewish/Shulchan-Aruch-Chapter-24-Reward-for-Wearing-Tzitzis-and-Punishment-for-Ignoring-This-Obligation.htm#v4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch HaRav 24:4</a></p>\n<p>This point is developed even further by <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41248&st=&pgnum=51&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eishel Avrohom 24:1</a> which adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לכן יטול ביד שמאל נגד לבו וכתיב בהו ולא תתורו אחרי לבבכם כי ציצית מצילין מחטא זנות</p>\n<p>Therefore he takes them (the tzitzis) in the left hand opposite one's heart as it writes about it \"So that you do not follow after your heart\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.39?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 15:39</a>) because tzitzis saves a person from the sin of immorality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Conversely, an obligation of the land, that is, a mitzva that applies specifically to the earth and its growths, applies only in Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מְנָא הָנֵי מִילֵּי דְּתָנוּ רַבָּנַן אֵלֶּה הַחֻקִּים אֵלּוּ הַמִּדְרָשׁוֹת וְהַמִּשְׁפָּטִים אֵלּוּ הַדִּינִים אֲשֶׁר תִּשְׁמְרוּן זוֹ מִשְׁנָה לַעֲשׂוֹת זוֹ מַעֲשֶׂה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara asks: From where are these matters derived? The Gemara answers: This is as the Sages taught in a baraita: The verse states: “These are the statutes and the ordinances that you shall observe to do in the land that the Lord, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that you live upon the earth” (Deuteronomy 12:1). This verse is interpreted as follows: The phrase “these are the statutes” means that these are the expositions that the Sages learn from verses. With regard to the phrase “and the ordinances,” these are monetary laws. With regard to “that you shall observe,” this is referring to the study of matters that must be observed for one to perform them. And as for the phrase “to do,” this is referring to action, the actual performance of mitzvot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>בָּאָרֶץ יָכוֹל כׇּל הַמִּצְוֹת כּוּלָּן לֹא יְהוּ נוֹהֲגִים אֶלָּ בָּאָרֶץ תַּלְמוּד לוֹמַר כׇּל הַיָּמִים אֲשֶׁר אַתֶּם חַיִּים עַל הָאֲדָמָה אִי כׇּל הַיָּמִים יָכוֹל יְהוּ נוֹהֲגִים בֵּין בָּאָרֶץ בֵּין בְּחוּצָה לָאָרֶץ תַּלְמוּד לוֹמַר בָּאָרֶץ</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The baraita continues: From the phrase “in the land [ba’aretz],” one might have thought that all mitzvot apply only in Eretz Yisrael. Therefore, the verse also states “all the days that you live upon the earth,” i.e., wherever you live. Furthermore, if the Merciful One had written only the phrase “all the days,” one might have thought that all mitzvot should apply both in Eretz Yisrael and outside of Eretz Yisrael. Therefore, the verse also states “in the land.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>אַחַר שֶׁרִיבָּה הַכָּתוּב וּמִיעֵט צֵא וּלְמַד מִמַּה שֶּׁאָמוּ בָּעִנְיָן אַבֵּד תְּאַבְּדוּן אֶת כׇּל הַמְּקֹמוֹת אֲשֶׁר עָבְדוּ שָׁם וְגוֹ' מָה עֲבוֹדָה זָרָה מְיוּחֶדֶת שֶׁהִיא חוֹבַת הַגּוּף וְנוֹהֶגֶת בֵּין בָּאָרֶץ בֵּין בְּחוּצָה לָאָרֶץ אַף כֹּל שֶׁהִיא חוֹבַת הַגּוּף נוֹהֶגֶת בֵּין בָּאָרֶץ בֵּין בְּחוּצָה לָאָרֶץ</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The baraita continues: Once the verse includes areas outside of Eretz Yisrael and also excludes areas outside of Eretz Yisrael, how is it determined which mitzvot apply outside the land and which do not? The baraita answers: Go and learn from what is stated with regard to a different issue that appears in the next verse: “You shall destroy all the places where the nations that you are to dispossess served their gods” (Deuteronomy 12:2). Just as the prohibition of idol worship is distinct in that it is an obligation of the body, and it applies both in Eretz Yisrael and outside of Eretz Yisrael, so too, any mitzva that is an obligation of the body applies both in Eretz Yisrael and outside of Eretz Yisrael. Conversely, mitzvot that are an obligation connected to the land apply only in Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Ramban writes on Vayikra 18:25,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומן הענין הזה אמרו בספרי (עקב מג) ואבדתם מהרה (דברים יא יז) <strong>אף על פי שאני מגלה אתכם מן הארץ לחוצה לארץ היו מצויינין במצות שכשתחזרו לא יהו עליכם חדשים</strong> משל לאדון שכעס על אשתו ושלחה לבית אביה אמר לה הוי מתקשטת תכשיטים שכשתחזרי לא יהיו עליך חדשים...והנה הכתוב שאמר (דברים יא יז-יח) ואבדתם מהרה ושמתם את דברי אלה וגו' <strong>אינו מחייב בגלות אלא בחובת הגוף כתפילין ומזוזות ופירשו בהן כדי שלא יהו חדשים עלינו כשנחזור לארץ</strong> <strong>כי עיקר כל המצות ליושבים בארץ ה'</strong> ולפיכך אמרו בספרי (ראה פ) וירשתם אותה וישבתם בה ושמרתם לעשות (דברים יא לא-לב) ישיבת ארץ ישראל שקולה כנגד כל המצות שבתורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This oft quoted Ramban says that the purpose of most mitzvos in chutz la'aretz is simply in order to remain in touch with them so that when the galus ends they aren't new to us.

    "content": "# For how many years, aggregate, were the requiremenst of the Law actually carried out?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am certainly no expert on Hebrew history so pls be patient with me :). I do read a bit and have not been able to put together an answer on my own - maybe because there are too many nuances, and too little detailed history. From the Law given to and through Moses, unto the destruction of 2nd temple by the Romans appears to be a span  of about 1600 years, depending on whose calcs one chooses. Sadly during much of that span the provisions and demands of sacrifice, tithes, penal enforcement etc weren't carried  out. Putting together the periods when the faithful held sway and the requirements of the Law were well-kept, enforced, implemented - how many years was that? Or for what portion %-age of that history were the people 'faithful' in their obligations?</p>\n<p>Links would be fine... I have tried searching but it is unwieldy. Timelines [which I prefer  when well-done] really don't detail what is necessary to try to educated-guess it.</p>\n<p>thank you!!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Gentile Participation in Non-Jewish Wedding Ceremony\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Concerning wedding ceremonies that may include idolatrous elements in which a gentile might be asked to participate due to family custom, Rabbi Moishe Wiener writes (in \"The Divine Code\"):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is generally forbidden to participate in a wedding event that is\nheld in a house of idol worship, or as a gathering in some other\nplace, if the wedding ceremony is conducted through their priests,\nsince they give praise and recognition to their idols. But if the\nceremony is completely secular, and they only make a celebrating with\na gathering in a social hall (not in the sanctuary that is used for\ntheir worship services), and there is no service of idols involved, it\nis permitted to participate, even if a priest is attending the event\n(footnote: clearly one may enter a house of idol worship for his own\npractical needs).</p>\n<p>But if bad feelings, anger or hatred will arise if one does not\nparticipate in a wedding that is connected with idol worship - for\nexample, if one's brother or sister is getting married in a house of\nidol worship, and most of the family will be participating - one is\nallowed to participate even if the others engage in idol worship in\nhonor of the occasion. Obviously, an individual is forbidden to\nparticipate in any type of ceremony or prayer in which the idol is\nmentioned (footnote: See Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah 148:9, 12).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have two questions concerning this.</p>\n<p>First, which propositions is the Shulchan Aruch being cited to support here (I have not found an English translation of this section)?</p>\n<p>Second, the mention of \"bad feelings, anger or hatred\" seems to allude to some general principle of leniency not explicitly cited. To paraphrase: participation in aspects of such a ceremony that are not themselves worship can be justified so as to avoid causing animosity within the family. Where has this general principle articulated?</p>\n\n\n",

I am aware that the Conservative movement has altered the nusach of the bracha to include the well-being of the entire world based on an alternative option in the siddur of Saadia Gaon. However, after looking at Rav Saadia's edition of the bracha, I am still not too convinced it was necessarily meant to include goyim, and even if it was, we nowadays do not accept that variation of the bracha. So, am I allowed to have kavana to include non-Jews even if that doesn't agree with the text? And is Judaism really not concerned with the well-being of ummot haolam?

And this is the way of the righteous ones, as David, peace be upon him, stated (Psalms 35:13), \"As for me, when they were ill, my dress was sackcloth, I afflicted myself in fasting.\" As a person should not make his supplications and his requests for his needs alone, but rather to <strong>pray for all people, that they be at peace. As with the welfare of the government, there is peace in the world.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it seems to me a good place to daven for the Gentile nations would be after Shabbos leining.</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Zeira  would not accept gifts but would accept meal invitations because of the assumption  the person inviting him was doing for his own benefit (he wasn't looking for the invitation) Based on that Gemora the Rambam (Zechiyah uMattanah 12:17) and the mechaber (Chosen Mishpat 249:5) both say the righteous  practice is not to accept anything given as a free present.</p>\n\n\n",

(Numbers 6:19)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the foreleg is cooked along with the entire ram, the rest of the ram is still kosher for non-priests to eat. The sages determined that the foreleg is one-sixtieth of a ram, which establishes the general concept:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מאן דאמר בששים סבר בשר ועצמות בהדי בשר ועצמות משערינן והוה ליה בששים מאן דאמר במאה סבר בשר בהדי בשר משערינן והוה ליה במאה</p>\n<p>The Gemara now returns to the dispute about whether non-kosher food is nullified in sixty or one hundred times its volume of kosher food, and explains how each opinion is derived from the halakha of the foreleg of the nazirite’s ram. <strong>The one who said</strong> that non-kosher food is nullified <strong>in sixty times</strong> its volume of kosher food <strong>holds</strong> that <strong>we assess</strong> the ratio of <strong>meat and bones</strong> of the foreleg <strong>to</strong> the <strong>meat and bones</strong> of the rest of the ram, <strong>and this</strong> <strong>is</strong> a ratio of one to <strong>sixty</strong>. (Steinsaltz Talmud)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The other cases of 60 in the Talmud appear together in Brakhot 57b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֶחָד מִשִּׁשִּׁים לְגֵיהִנָּם. דְּבַשׁ — אֶחָד מִשִּׁשִּׁים לַמָּן. שַׁבָּת — אֶחָד מִשִּׁשִּׁים לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא. שֵׁינָה — אֶחָד מִשִּׁשִּׁים לַמִּיתָה. חֲלוֹם — אֶחָד מִשִּׁשִּׁים לַנְּבוּאָה.</p>\n<p>Our fire is one-sixtieth of the fire of Gehenna; honey is one-sixtieth of manna; Shabbat is one-sixtieth of the World-to-Come; sleep is one-sixtieth of death; and a dream is one-sixtieth of prophecy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's logical to assume that these cases (fire, honey, Shabbat, sleep, and dreams) follow the food nullification principle in that they are marginal when compared to a grander model. In fact, this is precisely what the Ben Ish Hai says in his commentary (<em>Ben Yehoyada</em>) on the sugya in Brakhot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל שיעורים אלו של אחד מששים דנקיט הכא אינם אחד מששים, אלא ודאי שיש בהם\nיתרון למאות ואלפים ויתר כל אחד לפי עניינו, והא דנקיט בכולהו אחד מששים,\nמפני כי בעלמא שיעור הביטולים הוא בששים, שכל דבר אסור יתבטל אחד בששים\nוחשיב כאלו אינו כלל ועיקר, וכן הענין בא ללמדנו, אש המצוי כה יתבטל כוחו\nלגבי כח אש גיהנם כמו ביטול האיסור שיתבטל אחד בששים וחשיב זה חלק האחד\nכאילו אינו, אבל לעולם ודאי כח אש גיהנם הוא עצום ורב וגדול על כח אש\nהמצוי אצלינו יותר ממאה אלפי פעמים וכן הענין בשאר מינים אשר מזכיר פה.</p>\n<p>All of these one-sixtieth measurements are not actually one in sixty... but <strong>they're all called that because nullification is measured as one-sixtieth</strong>. Every forbidden thing is nullified in a volume of sixty, where it is then considered marginal and unessential. The principle teaches us that the power of common fire is nullified with respect to the fire of Gehenna, <strong>just like a forbidden thing is nullified in a volume of sixty</strong>. This one part is considered as if it did not exist, unlike the power of Gehenna fire, which is eternally vast and mighty. It is more than a hundred thousand times greater than the power of common fire that we have. And the same [metaphorical analogy] is true of the other cases brought down here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>A more mathematical answer shows that working with parts of 60 is actually a very efficient mathematical choice, especially in Babylonean times. To this day we still work with '60', such as in our system of time, the 12 star signs, etc.</p>\n<p>To understand why parts of 60 work, you need to understand what a mathematical base is. Each digit raises the base to power based on the position (going right to left). The first digit is the base to the power 0, the second digit is the base to the power 1, etc.</p>\n<p>We are used to a base 10 system, so when we add things we count up to nine, before starting anew in a cycle. 11 means '10 and 1'. Most are also familiar with the base 2 system, aka the binary system. You count from zero to one, before 'restarting the clock'. 11 means '2 and 1'.</p>\n<p>It is known from ancient texts that in the Babylonian region a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">base 60 system</a> was used.</p>\n<p>This system has some incredible properties in regards to counting without tools, such as an abacus. In a base 10 system, we count on our fingers to ten, and then things start to get difficult. How do you count to 11 on your fingers? In a base 60 system that is much easier, and the Babylonian writings reflect their 'counting on fingers system'.</p>\n<p>Take your left hand, and don't count on your thumb. Start counting the sections of your fingers. You have four fingers (if you exclude the thumb), with three parts each, so twelve parts in total. The trick is to count up to twelve by pointing on your 12 finger-parts with your index finger. As soon as you have counted 12, you start anew by counting with your index and middle finger. This allows you to count up to 24. After adding your ring finger and ultimately your pinky, you will have reliably counted up to 60.</p>\n<p>The base 60 system also has other big advantages for a world without computers. 60 is easily divided into parts, which is why it is still popular in our time-system, which is also a base-60 system (60 minutes in one hour). If you need to divide it in half, you get 30, which can be divided in quarters to get 15 etc. But most importantly: 60 has a wonderful property woefully lacking in the base-10 system, and that is that it is divisible by 3. The fraction 10/3 is much more difficult to work with than 60/3, because 10/3 is not an integer, whereas 20 is a whole number.</p>\n<p>Base 10 can be divided into whole numbers by two factors only, namely, '5' and '2'. Other systems have advantages over base-10, especially in the ancient world that hadn't invented the decimal points yet. Base 30, the smallest base that is divisible by 2, 3, and 5. Base 60 is at the tipping point where it can be counted 'naturally' such as explained above, and is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Higher than sixty doesn't really help improve upon base-60. To get a clean fraction like 1/7 using an analogous representation, you’d have to go up all the way to the basically unusable base 210 system.</p>\n<p>A bit more technical: base 10 only has the prime factors '2 x 5', whereas the prime factors of 60 are '2 × 2 × 3 × 5'. More prime factors are a good thing if you need to divide things in parts. Any system that allows you to divide things in clean equal parts is superior to a system to forces you to 'wing it' when you need to divide it in anything other than 2 or 5. As mentioned, you need to go up to 210 to get a qualitative improvement upon 60 with the prime factors '2 × 3 × 5 × 7'. But counting in cycles of 210 is a cognitive strain of biblical proportions.</p>\n<p>So, in a world where you count, and most importantly, divide a lot of 'real' things (as opposed to the more abstract things we use mathematics for nowadays), and you don't have the luxury of computers, the base-60 system has a lot of advantages over other systems of counting, mostly because it has a lot of prime factors, i.e. is easy to divide into whole numbers. Base-10 has other advantages, but in the old world of the Babylonian Talmud the base-60 system is superior.</p>\n\n\n",

Te following verses are important to gain some Understanding of G-d.</p>\n<p>Shemot 20:3 “There shall not be to you other gods ‘al panai’.” The words al panai mean ‘in addition to My presence’, ‘besides My presence’ or ‘in My visible surface’; although the literal translation would be ‘upon My face’, or over My face; literally replacing the face (appearance) of G-d (i.e. the way He presents Himself to us) with another face or false representation of who He truly is. See also Devarim 5:7</p>\n<p>Shemot 20:23 “you will not make for you gods with Me” - The Talmud derives further, based on a slightly different interpretation of that verse, that we may not produce an image of G-d Himself (“lo ta’asun oati” rather than “iti”). Nor may we turn to idols, or make any (see Shemot 20:4, 34:17, Vayikra 19:4 for example) nor worship any other G-d; Shemot 34:14 “You shall not bow down [in worship] before another god”.

Then you have to filter out the stories that are due to mental illness or drugs. As for the remaining stories, the Bible (Deuteronomy 13) teaches us that G-d sometimes sends false prophets to test us. Sometimes these prophets can even perform miracles.</p>\n<p>It is also possible for people to be fooled by receiving visions from unholy sources. This is explained at length in the classic work <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derech_Hashem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Way of G-d:</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the false prophets: However the essence of this matter is that which we wrote in Part I, Chapter 5 (On the Spiritual Realm 8) about <strong>those powers of impurity that exist in the world</strong> and which work according to that which is embedded in their natures and given over into their hands. <strong>And behold they have the power to fool people to bring down influences on people in ways similar to the ways of true prophecy and reveal true and false things to them. And some wondrous things will happen for him [in this way], as it is written in Scripture explicitly about the false prophet (Deuteronomy 13:2-3), \"and he gives you a sign or a wonder. And the sign or wonder happens.\"</strong> <strong>And note that it is possible for this thing to happen to a person without willing it, and it is possible that it happen to a person willfully.</strong> This means that it is possible that this thing happen to him when he did not make efforts towards it or [even] when he made efforts towards its opposite; but it came to him [regardless], because he had not perfected his deeds and his efforts. But it is [also] possible that he wants it and evilly makes efforts to attain it. This means that he follows these powers and makes efforts to cleave to them, due to his desire to attain that which he wants to attain from them - meaning that matters be revealed to him, as we mentioned; so that through them he can hold himself up to be a prophet in front of people and mislead them as he desires or become honored in their eyes. And of this type were the prophets of Ba'al and Asheirah. For see that they made efforts towards this until they were cleaving to those powers and attained some knowledge of things - through which they they would seduce those who believed them - and also bring forth wonders through this power, as a sign of their being prophets. But they themselves would know that this only came to them from the angle of the impurity they had chosen for themselves. So they themselves did not think they were prophets, but did it out of the evil of their hearts. Yet it was also possible that this would happen to someone who was not making efforts towards it, as we have mentioned. And therefore those making efforts to [attain true] prophecy needed an established teacher to teach them, as we have written - so they would be prevented [from such errors] by him. And all of this is until they would reach the level of true prophecy. For once they reached it, they would already see the great difference and recognize it. Then it would be impossible for them to have doubts about it at all, as we wrote.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately there have been people in history who claimed to be Rabbis and yet encouraged people to pray to them, which is idolatry. Their followers will tell of the many miracles these so-called Rabbis performed; yet it is all idolatry.</p>\n<p>We do not pray to Rabbis, we only pray directly to G-d. As we say in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Sefard%2C_Additional_Prayers_%2C_Thirteen_Principles.6?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Thirteen Principles of Faith:</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>I believe with complete faith that the Creator, blessed is His Name, is the only One to Whom it is proper to pray, and to no being beside Him is it proper to pray.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

During the recitation of the Shema, he should take hold of them in his left hand. During the recitation of the Shema,  he should take hold of them in his left hand, between his forefinger and middle finger, opposite his heart.</p>\n<p>When he reaches the passage vayomer, the passage concerning the tzitzis, he should hold them in his right hand. When he recites the verse ur'isem oso, he should place them on his eyes, look at them and kiss them. It is customary to kiss them every time one recites the word \"tzitzis\".</p>\n<p>Practically this means that initially he hold the tzitzis just with the left hand and during the passage concerning tzitzis while still holding the base of the tzitzis in the left hand he also takes hold of the tzitzis in his right hand in order to bring them to his eyes and to kiss them. Note in this passage quotes it might sound like a switch but it is not, as it only says to take hold of them implying that one does not release them from his left hand only that he also takes hold of them with his right hand for the third paragraph of Shema.</p>\n<p>additions from shulchanharav website footnotes in regards to this matter:</p>\n<p>[14] Arizal in Shaar Hakavanos p. 27b “When one begins Vayomer he is to take hold of the Tzitzis also in his right hand, leaving the roots in the left hand”; Kaf Hachaim 24/8; Ketzos Hashulchan 19/25; Custom of Rebbe as witnessed by congregants; See Sefer Haminhagim p. 24 [English] of the custom of the Rebbe Rashab “They were held [in the left hand] throughout the Shema, including the stages when they were kissed.”</p>\n<p>Other opinions: Some Poskim write that at Vayomer one is to hold the Tzitzis only in the right hand.

And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, <strong>Alas my brother!</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why did the people of the city cry out ה֥וֹי אָחִֽי?

However, that does not explain the use of the word brother in this posuk.</p>\n<p>Any commentaries that explain the deeper meaning behind the use of the word אָחִֽי when speaking of a man?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It was a call-and-response initiated by the prophet in Beit El.</p>\n<p>Abarbanel and others take the track that the fellow was a retired, one-time legitimate prophet, who wasn't being malicious here.</p>\n<p>In that vein, you could explain that he felt that it wasn't worth speaking up when the North Kingdom veered the wrong way. \"Hey, let's just take it easy.\" He is symbolic of a whole society of people who choose to do nothing when evil occurs. He thought if he could take it easy, so could the young visiting prophet -- and then saw vividly how wrong he was, by how severely God punished the younger prophet for a minor diversion. So he led the chant \"woe, my brother\" -- i.e. my fellow prophet who was in the same position I was, but made the right choice instead. And got the city to respond with him. \"We all should identify with that young man who spoke out.\"</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.13.30?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_I_Kings.13.30.3&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudas Dovid</a> it was a term of endearment bemoaning the situation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוי אחי. רצה לומר: צר לי עליך רעי</p>\n<p>Alas my brother - this means to say: I feel sorry for you my friend.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.13.30?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_Zion_on_I_Kings.13.30.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudas Zion</a> adds about the use of the word \"הוי\" that precedes the term \"אחי\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוי. הוא ענין לשון יללה</p>\n<p>It is an expression of lamentation / howling</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where do the Jewish prayers in the Siddur come from?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am new to Judaism, and just bought the <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1578191513\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">transliterated artscroll siddur</a>. I have yet to consume the entire introduction, but have glanced through it, interested in getting to the prayers. I realize I have no idea where the prayers come from though. In the introduction it says many come from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Psalms</a>, but it doesn't show exactly the passage in which book everything is from.</p>\n<p>Are all prayers in this siddur I got exact word-for-word copy/pastes from something in the Tanakh? Or are any of them found in the Talmud copy/paste? Or from elsewhere, or were some/all the prayers take from these places, yet slightly modified to \"improve them\" in some way, more suitable for prayer?</p>\n<p>I would like to know where the prayers in this siddur come from, if they are copy/pastes from other texts, or they have been created or modified from some other sources. If they are copy/pastes from the Tanakh, for example, then I would next be curious to go and look them up there, and see the surrounding context, for example.</p>\n<p>If some/many of the prayers are not direct copy/pastes from some other text, I'd be curious to know how they were constructed and why they made it into the official prayer book if not from a more central source. But maybe can save that for a future question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Try the translated (not transliterated) Artscroll. It will tell you which pieces are direct Psalms, and have footnotes when pieces are lifted (verbatim or paraphrased) from where in Tanach.</p>\n<p>The main three paragraphs of <em>Shema</em> are in the Torah; the main texts of the blessings surrounding them, and the silent prayer (<em>Amida</em> or <em>Shmoneh Esrei</em>) were developed during the Second Temple period -- with one last bit added around the year 100. The Talmud refers to many of them (assuming you know what they are), but doesn't list out the complete texts. Other parts are lifted straight out of the Talmud, such as the wayfarer's prayer; or slightly modified, such as one particular Talmudic rabbi's daily prayer for \"a life of blessing, a life of sustenance, a live of health ...\" became the prayer when announcing a new month is coming.</p>\n<p>If you compared the Siddurs across the world 300 years ago you'd see some minor variations between those of the Middle East, Central Europe, and the Mediterranean -- do you pray for \"knowledge, intuition, and enlightenment\" or for \"wisdom, understanding, and knowledge\"? But they're very clearly minor variations on the same original text.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a complicated question to answer. The siddur is made up of different prayers brought together from different eras. I will not give you an exhaustive list as that could be the subject of a whole book, but instead give you some examples so you can recognize the literary layers.</p>\n<p>The oldest strata of prayers in the siddur are those from the Tanach: most commonly from the book of psalms, but also from other books such as Exodus, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Chronicles. Some examples of these would be:</p>\n<p><strong>Torah:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Song at the Sea (Exodus 14:30-15:19)</li>\n<li>Mi khamokha before the Shemoneh Esrei (Exodus 15:11)</li>\n<li>Shema paragraph 1 (Deuteronomy 6:4-9)</li>\n<li>Shema paragraph 2 (Deuteronomy 11:13-21)</li>\n<li>Shema paragraph 3 (Numbers 15:37-41)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prophets:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nehemiah 9:6-11</li>\n<li>Ovadiah 22:29, Zekhariah 14:9</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Writings:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In P'sukei D'Zimra (I Chronicles 16:8-36, Psalm 100, pastiches of fragments from other psalms, assembled in the rabbinic period)</li>\n<li>Daily Hallel (Psalms 145 - Psalm 150)</li>\n<li>After the psalms of the daily hallel (I Chronicles 29:10-13)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Statutory Prayers</strong>\nAppended to this most ancient layer are the prayers composed from roughly 516 BCE to CE 120. Sometimes these were new verses created afresh, and sometimes they would be built from biblical verses that were assembled or reworded in new ways. The most prominent addition from this period would be the 19 benedictions that make up the Shemoneh Esrei or Amidah (standing prayer). These are credited to \"the men of the Great Assembly\" with the 19th addition added by Rabbi Gamaliel II. Also dating from this period are pieces of the two benedictions before the Shemoneh Esrei, \"Creator\" and \"With Great Love\", but their text remained fluid through the Gaonic period (roughly 589 CE to 1038 CE), with some parts like the Kedusha of Creator being dated as later Gaonic poetic additions.</p>\n<p><strong>Aramaic Material</strong>\nThe most prominent set of Aramaic prayers is the Kaddish, found in several different forms. Some parts of it may be as early as 100 BCE but we do not have it as a complete written text until the <em>Siddur of Amram Gaon</em> around 900 CE. There is evidence that the contents of it was fluid during this interval.</p>\n<p>Another Aramaic prayer on the Sabbath is \"Yekum Purkan\" which was likely composed in Babylonia near the end of the Gaonic period, but which we do not have a text of before <em>Machzor Vitry</em> from around 1100 CE in France. This is an example of a relatively late addition that is found in the Ashkenazic (Northern European) rite, but not Sephardic (Spanish) or Mizrachi (Eastern) rites.</p>\n<p>Much more could be written on this subject. My source for much of this is <em>Jewish Liturgy: A Comprehensive History</em> by Ismar Elbogen, but it is written at a scholarly level probably above what you should be studying right now. The primary takeaway for you is that the siddur was not given as a revelation all at once like the Torah. It was built and reworked by rabbis, mystics, and poets over a long period of time to express their ideas about the relationship between man and G-d.</p>\n\n\n",

In the book ופקדת נווך by R' Erez Abrahamov, p. 70, it says (emphasis in the original):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וראיתי בספר \"חנוך לנער\" המבוסס על דבריו של הגאון הרב חיים קנייבסקי שליט\"א (עמ' ל\"ז ואילך) שדן בכמה נקודות מעניינות לחינוך לשקר או מידות רעות:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"פיית השיניים\" והמלאך זורק הסוכריות - בספר \"בטוב ירושלים\" לרב ידלר מובא מנהג ירושלים, שהיו מביאים את הילד לראשונה לחדר ללמוד, אזי היו זורקים עליו ממתקים ומעות מלמעלה ואומרים לו שהמלאך זורק לו את זה מהשמיים ואם הוא ילמד הוא יקבל מהמלאך הרבה יותר, ושאלו את הגאון הרב קנייבסקי שליט\"א כיצד הדבר מותר, וענה:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...אומרים כן בעלמא והילד יודע בסופו של דבר שלא המלאך הוא הזורק. אנחנו תמיד ידענו שזה לא נכון, <strong>ואפילו אם הילד לא יודע - הוא יידע</strong>\".\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And I saw in the book \"Chanoch La'naar\" that is based on the words of the gaon Rabbi Chaim kanievsky (p. 37 and onwards) discussing a number of interesting points regarding teaching to lie or bad middot (traits):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Tooth Fairy\"<sup>1</sup> and the Candy-throwing Angel - in the book \"Betuv Yerushalayim\" by Rabbi Yadler a custom of Yerushalayim is brought, where they would bring a child for the first time to the Cheder to learn, and would then throw upon him candies and coins from above and would tell him that the angel threw it on him from the heavens and if he will learn, he'll recieve from the angel much more than that,<sup>2</sup> and they asked the gaon Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky Shlit\"a (now Zt\"l obviously...) how such a thing is allowed and he answered:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...they say so as a common form of exaggeration and the child eventually comes to know that it is not the angel that throws. We always knew that this is not true, <strong>and even if the child does not know - he will know</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the minhag of the Candy-throwing Angel there are more sources.</p>\n<p>First of all, Rabbi Shmuel Halevi Horovitz in his book שבח הברית, p. 142 sources this custom to a book called ספר בראנדשפיגל, which, from what I gather, is more commonly known as <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/42613\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ברנט שפיגל</a> (for more info on the book, see <a href=\"https://jewishpubliclibrary.org/collections/rare-books/online-exhibit/sefer-brant-shpigl/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46552&st=&pgnum=26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). However, it's in Yiddish and I have not been able to find any related keywords from a quick search. Rabbi Horovitz wrote that this book sources the custom to the book שבילי אמונה (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/43517\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">one</a> of several editions), but there I have also been unsuccessful in finding the relevant source in the book itself. With that said, the relevant source from Shvilei Emunah is brought in R' Simchah Asaf's book <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22413&st=&pgnum=84\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">לתולדות החינוך בישראל, pt. 1, p. 59</a>. I suspect that this is where other sources got their quote from.<sup>3</sup> In this source, the angel is nameless and instead of candy, fruit were tossed.</p>\n<p>Second, a discussion on why this minhag is okay by the Rebbe of Chabad can be found in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25059&st=&pgnum=82&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torat Menachem 5720, pt. 1,  pp. 82-85</a>. In the Rebbe's version, the angel is said to be Michael.</p>\n<p>Side-question: Going back to the first source that connects the angel to the fairy, I am not entirely sure why the comparison should hold, given that the angel, among other things, represents a kind of \"מתוך שלא לשמה יבוא לשמה\", whilst what positivity does the fairy bring about exactly?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> In terms of the format of the quote in the book ופקדת נווך it looks like the Tooth Fairy is explicitly mentioned in the book חנוך לנער, but it's not. This appears to be a connection made by R' Abrahamov.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> הרב בן ציון יאדלר, בטוב ירושלים, עמ' נ' - Rabbi Ben Tzion Yadler, Betuv Yerushalaim, p. 50</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> Interestingly, R' Yisrael Shtzifanski in התקנות בישראל, vol. 4, p. 331-332, footnote 496 argues that since the Brantshpigl brought this custom as well as a number of others in the name of Shvilei Emunah, that means that this was no longer a custom in his time and/or place, otherwise he would have simply stated it was a traditional custom.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "How much can we control emotions",
    "content": "# How much can we control emotions\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems that Torah/Judaism maintains that we have the ability to arouse certain emotions (e.g. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/15911/all-you-need-is-love\">All you need is love?</a>). How far does the idea that we can control our emotions reach? Specifically, I'm wondering:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do we have the ability to both arouse particular emotions (positive) and suppress particular emotions (negative)?</li>\n<li>Does this ability extend to all possible emotions, or just a select few (e.g. love of Hashem, not despising others, not harboring resentment, etc)?</li>\n<li>Does this ability extend to all times and all places, or just a select few (e.g. on holy days like Shabbos, while davening, while learning Torah, while devoting 100% of our attention to the particular emotion)?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a really interesting question.</p>\n<p>Firstly, a quick introduction:</p>\n<p>The huge number of emotions we have are often a reason why we feel a mixture of feelings when things happen. Indeed, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Akeidat_Yitzchak.97.1.4?ven=Akeydat_Yitzchak_by_Eliyahu_Munk&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Akeidas Yitzchak 97:1</strong></a> notes that the most difficult war a person faces, is the struggle between conflicting emotions or characteristics that goes on within one's personality:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמנם יש מלחמה אחרת יותר נסתרת ויותר מסוכנת והיא התקוממות התכונות ורוע הפעולות כקנאה והתאוה והחמדה והזדון והכילות ושאר הפחיתיות המתגברות באדם להרים יד במלך הוא החלק השכלי כי זה באמת חולי רע הוא ונפש הוא חובל ועם שזה כבר יוכר בפני האדם כמ\"ש החכם לב שמח ייטיב גהה ורוח נכאה תיבש גרם (משלי י״ז:כ״ב). ושמחת הלב תתחזק בתוכן הפעולות הישרות כמו שתדאג הרוח בהפכיהם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is therefore not easy to control our emotions as there are often multiple emotions at play. The only immediate control one has over his emotions is when he sleeps. As the <strong>Ramchal</strong> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_Three%2C_On_the_Soul_and_Its_Activities.6?vhe=Handwritten_Manuscript_EH_47_C_32._1896.&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Hashem</a> asserts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה בהיות האדם ישן כחותיו נחות והרגשותיו שקטות והשכלתו ג״כ נחה ושוקטת</p>\n<p>And note that when man sleeps, his faculties rest and his emotions are quiet; and his intellect also rests and is quiet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That being said, there are ways to train our emotions and to channel them when needed and is something that we should strive to master. <strong>Rabbi Mordechai Leiner, the Ishbitzer</strong>, in his Mei HaShiloach when commenting on the verses in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.29-30?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 25:29-30</a> which discusses houses in a walled city interprets the use of the keri kesiv in a more symbolic fashion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי האיש אשר אין מעצור לרוחו נקרא אשר לא חומה, וזה שיש לו מעצור לרוחו נקרא אשר לו חומה, וזה שישארו כל זכיותיו של האיש אשר אין לו מעצר לרוחו ביד האיש אשר עצר את רוחו ושתק לו</p>\n<p>A man who has no control over his emotions has no wall, and the one who controls his emotions has a wall. And so we find that one who cannot control his emotions will remain in the possession of the one who controlled is emotions and remained silent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So how then does one learn to control his emotions? Well, <strong>Rambam</strong> advises that one should try and maintain a degree of equanimity and if someone struggles with a specific emotion or character trait, they should go to the opposite extreme to help cure that defect. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Human_Dispositions.2.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Hilchos De'os 2:2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מִי שֶׁהוּא בַּעַל חֵמָה אוֹמְרִים לוֹ לְהַנְהִיג עַצְמוֹ שֶׁאִם הֻכָּה וְקֻלַּל לֹא יַרְגִּישׁ כְּלָל. וְיֵלֵךְ בְּדֶרֶךְ זוֹ זְמַן מְרֻבֶּה עַד שֶׁיִּתְעַקֵּר הַחֵמָה מִלִּבּוֹ. וְאִם הָיָה גְּבַהּ לֵב יַנְהִיג עַצְמוֹ בְּבִזָּיוֹן הַרְבֵּה וְיֵשֵׁב לְמַטָּה מִן הַכּל וְיִלְבַּשׁ בְּלוֹיֵי סְחָבוֹת הַמְבַזּוֹת אֶת לוֹבְשֵׁיהֶם וְכַיּוֹצֵא בִּדְבָרִים אֵלּוּ עַד שֶׁיַּעֲקֹר גֹּבַהּ הַלֵּב מִמֶּנּוּ וְיַחֲזֹר לַדֶּרֶךְ הָאֶמְצָעִית שֶׁהוּא דֶּרֶךְ הַטּוֹבָה. וְלִכְשֶׁיַּחֲזֹר לַדֶּרֶךְ הָאֶמְצָעִית יֵלֵךְ בָּהּ כָּל יָמָיו. וְעַל קַו זֶה יַעֲשֶׂה בִּשְׁאָר כָּל הַדֵּעוֹת אִם הָיָה רָחוֹק לַקָּצֶה הָאֶחָד יַרְחִיק עַצְמוֹ לַקָּצֶה הַשֵּׁנִי וְיִנְהֹג בּוֹ זְמַן רַב עַד שֶׁיַּחֲזֹר בּוֹ לַדֶּרֶךְ הַטּוֹבָה וְהִיא מִדָּה בֵּינוֹנִית שֶׁבְּכָל דֵּעָה וְדֵעָה</p>\n<p>We tell the wrathful man to train himself to feel no reaction even if he is beaten or cursed. He should follow this course of behavior for a long time, until the anger is uprooted from his heart. The man who is full of pride should cause himself to experience much disgrace. He should sit in the lowliest of places, dress in tattered rags which shame the wearer, and the like, until the arrogance is uprooted from his heart and he returns to the middle path, which is the proper path. When he returns to this middle path, he should walk in it the rest of his life. One should take a similar course with each of the other traits. A person who swayed in the direction of one of the extremes should move in the direction of the opposite extreme, and accustom himself to that for a long time, until he has returned to the proper path, which is the midpoint for each and every temperament.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to the Rambam they way we control our emotions is to go to the other extreme which helps balance us and thereby over time, supress the emotion and gain mastery over it.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Whilst this might not necessarily be easy or practical, there may be more readily accessible approaches that can help us re-orient our emotions. For example, we are told in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.3.14-15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Melachim II 3:14-15</strong></a> that Elisha had become angry and therefore asked for a musician to help calm him and thereby make him ready to receive prophecy. <sup> 2</sup> Similarly, the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.30b.25?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 30b</a> - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.31a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">31a</a> talks about Mar who broke an incredibly expensive cup when he saw that the Rabbonim had become excessively merry which had the effect of making them become more sombre.</p>\n<p>So perhaps for most of us that can't just 'flick the switch' when they need to arouse or suppress an emotion we can take active steps to allow us to channel the right emotion. In other words, try to find something that will trigger or lessen the feeling.</p>\n<p>I'll conclude with a nice story I once read about <strong>HaRav Simche Zissel Ziv, the Alter of Kelm זצ״ל</strong> who had a unique and novel way to cope with anger. He was the proud owner of a special coat that he referred to as his ‘garment of anger’. On the occasion that he felt feelings of anger pervade his soul, he went to the closet to put on his coat. More often than not, by the time he had found and donned his coat his anger had already subsided.</p>\n<p>Thus, emotions are both numerous and varied. They are ever-present and on many an occasion emerge without our control. Trying to gain mastery over emotions can be a life's work and even then it is not a foregone conclusion that we will master every area. However, there are methods that we can try that can help us to get better at controlling our outbursts or trigger a outpouring of an emotions. Hatzlacha to us all!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup>Just as an aside, it is interesting to note that the <strong>Piaseczna Rebbe - Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira</strong> in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mevo_HaShearim.3.11-12?ven=Entrance_to_the_gates,_trans._and_annot._by_Jon_Kelsen,_2019&lang=bi&with=About&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mevo HaShearim</a> actually does not like this approach:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Until the chasidic period, the sequence of avodah was to first subjugate one’s body along with one’s feelings, and to quiet one’s emotions—indeed, to afflict oneself, in order to control them all so that they would not act at all, for they are all evil. Only then could one draw light to oneself, be it the light of his soul which he awakens and releases from his soul, or a light higher than his soul. All this was accomplished through apprehension, wisdom, thought, kavannot and yihudim...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly he argues that emotions and the like should not be suppressed as even the bad emotions are a channel to reach higher, spiritual holiness.</p>\n<p><sup> 2</sup>Refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Metzudat_David_on_II_Kings.3.15.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudas Dovid</a> there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is the popular idea in chassidus that we are able to control our thoughts, which then leads to our character speech and actions.</p>\n<p>In all of Judaism, there is the notion that we have the ability to control how we act. As it says in Pirkei Avot (3:15) \"Everything is foreseen, yet freedom of choice is granted.\"</p>\n<p>Specifically to answer your question:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>We absolutely have the ability to arouse and suppress emotions. That is basic emotional self-control. The question becomes what constitutes a negative emotion versus a positive one? Judaism points towards humility and joy rather than anger and pride.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>All possible emotions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>All times and all places. There is no time or place where G-d is unaware of our choices.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Sefer hachinuch in mitzva 416 on the prohibition of Sisave (thou shalt not desire) writes:</p>\n<p>ואל]] תתמה לומר ואיך יהיה בידו של אדם, למנוע לבבו מהתאוות אל אוצר כל כלי חמדה שיראה ברשות חבירו, והוא מכלם ריק וריקם? ואיך תביא התורה מניעה במה שאי אפשר לו לאדם לעמד עליו? שזה הדבר אינו כן, ולא יאמרו אותו, זולתי הטפשים הרעים והחטאים בנפשותם, כי האמנם, ביד האדם למנע עצמו ומחשבותיו ותאוותיו מכל מה שירצה, וברשותו ובדעתו להרחיק ולקרב חפצו בכל הדברים כרצונו, ולבו מסור בידו, על כל אשר יחפץ יטנו,</p>\n<p>Loosely translated he says “do not question how is it in the hands of a man to prevent himself from desiring beautiful vessels that his friend possesses? How could the Torah command something which is not in a persons ability to withstand? This is not the case! Only fools and sinners would say this. Rather it is in the hands of an individual to stop his thoughts and desires for anything he wants, and it is in his ability to distance or bring close his desires for everything as he wishes. His heart is given in his hands for all he wishes etc.”</p>\n<p>He seems to state that we could both fight off and positively evoke emotions.</p>\n\n\n",

The factors on which the ruling hinges, in short, are: a) the number of children the couple already has – i.e., whether they have already fulfilled the Torah commandment or the rabbinic commandment, and to what degree; b) the man’s age – the more time that has passed since he turned twenty, the harder it is to permit the use of contraception before the fulfillment of the mitzva to procreate; c) the woman’s age – the older she is, the greater the risk that using contraception will end up preventing the couple from having the number of children they desire, or even from fulfilling the Torah commandment; d) the reasons for seeking contraception – they may include physical or mental illness, financial difficulties or psychological issues, the need for personal fulfillment, difficulty with raising children, or prevention of anger and tension; e) the metod of birth control... <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Peninei_Halakhah%2C_Simchat_Habayit_U%27Virkhato.5.20.1-2?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(source)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Herschel Schachter deals with this case in an <a href=\"https://download.yutorah.org/1982/1053/735664.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article on family planning</a> (p.21-24)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, the permissibility of sterilizing a woman through medication is\nexplained by the Talmud to apply only in such a case where the\nhusband will not be prevented thereby from fulfilling his mitzvah\nof Piryah V'riuyah.

Some, however, rule that\nthere still exists a rabbinic prohibition which may only be lifted if\nthe woman is known to suffer unusual pain at childbirth.\nAccording to this view, this Heter (lenient ruling) is similar to the\nlaw allowing violation of rabbinic prohibitions on Shabbos for the\nsake of a sick person (Choleh She'ein bo Sakona) even though\nthere is clearly no danger of life or limb. \"In a situation of pain\n(tza'ar) the Rabbis did not insist upon the observance of their\nprohibitions.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Further on the Rav records an opinion cited in the name of the Chasam Sofer that the story cited in Yevamot cannot be used as precedent today because in those times the husband had the option of marrying a second wife to continue his biblical obligation to be fruitful and multiple whereas (according to the predominant opinion) today that option does not exist.</p>\n\n\n",

You are asking a good question. The whole background is basically this: God gave us 613 general commandments, and then an Oral Torah to explain them, as well as a general charge to the Rabbis to work out more details, add guards and fences around them, and innovate time sensitive decrees according to the rules and methods laid out etc. There are also customs.</p>\n<p>All of the above is what you mean when you say you are looking for something more than just the 613 commandments, and quite right. Until Maimonedes, there was never a comprehensive book that just collects and categorises it all neatly and without extraneous discussion. Since then, we have several, arguably the most important is the Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch is very long, and itself has dozens of commentaries. Even though it is very long, it doesn't cover everything! Not just laws that are no longer possible to practice (such as laws pertaining to when the Temple is standing) are omitted either. Trying to condense <em>everything</em> in the Oral Tradition is an endless endeavour and the author did have to draw some lines. Gaps are filled by later works and commentaries (a big one is Mishna Berura), and there have been further attempts to condense things even more concisely and practically, as N.T. has mentioned.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive and complete work on this is the Mishneh Torah by Maimonedes. It is available online on Sefaria in English and claims to cover the entire Oral Tradition. It seems more in line for what you are looking for, if I am understanding the question correctly. Contained in these laws are what gentiles are and are not allowed to learn, so anyone reading this should bare that in mind.</p>\n\n\n",

Should it be worn, or not?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The contemporary normative Ashkenazi approach to the topic generally follows the BaH (OH 18:1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בתענית ציבור כשלובשין טלית במנחה כשמגיעים לברכו של ערבית יסיר הטלית\nמעליו דכיון שאין לובשין טלית אלא לקיים מצות ציצית נראה כאילו סובר לילה\nזמן ציצית הוא אם לא יסירנו מעליו מלבד ערב יום הכפורים שלובשין מבעוד\nיום לאחר מנחה ואין מסירין מעליהם בלילה לפי שדומין למלאכים לובשין לבנים\nומתעטפים לבנים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With the exception of Yom Kippur, a talleth is not worn at night as doing so erroneously signals that one has reasoned that the night is a zeman sisith (a period within which one fulfills the miswah of sisith). This position is endorsed and cited authoritatively by the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%9F_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%9D_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%99%D7%97#%D7%9E%D7%90_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Abhraham (OH 18:1:1)</a>, and the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%99%D7%97#%D7%95_%D7%9E%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah (OH 18:1:6)</a>.</p>\n<p>The Shaliah Sibbur however wears a talleth during all prayers, even at night, as a function of כבוד הציבור (the honor due to the congregation). See MB ad loc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>is there a kabbalistic reason why some customarily wear a tallis gadol during kabbalas shabbos?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First it is worth reiterating that there is firm halakhic basis for this practice. As you note this was the conduct of the Amora R. Hanina (Shabboth 119a). One also finds earlier evidence of this practice in the Tannatic era as well, Shabboth 25b reports this as the conduct of R. Yehudah b. 'Ilai:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כך היה מנהגו של רבי יהודה בר אלעאי ערב שבת מביאים לו עריבה מלאה חמין\nורוחץ פניו ידיו ורגליו ומתעטף ויושב בסדינין המצוייצין ודומה למלאך ה'\nצבאות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Further one might argue against the BaH's concern, that wearing it on Friday night does not signal that one has reasoned that it is a zeman sisith as it is apparent that one is wearing it in order to greet the Shabboth (just as he maintains that it is apparent on Yom Kippur when an alternative consideration is at play).</p>\n<p>In terms of surveying the practices extant in the larger Jewish world: Temanim, who historically largely accepted the Mishneh Torah as authoritative (as you note H. Shabboth 30:2), have preserved this practice (I have observed this at several Baladi minyanim). However there are other pockets of Jewry that retain the practice as well, such as some Hasidic sects (Karlin, Slonim, Lelov and Toldoth Aharon) that don it before Minhah and and take it off either after Maaribh or Qiddush. Even among Hasidic sects that do not generally observe this practice, many of their rebbes/admorim do. Anecdotally, I have also been told that some Moroccan families continue this tradition as well.</p>\n<p>Now, to return to your question. On the more esoteric side of things it's a bit of a mixed bag. The Radbaz wrote (Mesudath Dowid, miswah no. 84):</p>\n<p>ואין מצות ציצית בלילה משום לא תחסום שור בדישו דא\"כ קשרת מדת הדין שלא תפעול בלילה ואסור לבטל מנהגו של עולם</p>\n<p>Accordingly, R. Haim Vital reported that R. Isaac Luria (who was a student of the Radbaz) was generally careful to remove his talleth before the onset of sunset (Sha'ar Hakawanoth, Tefilah ha-Minhah, Derush 2). Of this camp, R. Immanuel Hai Ricci and R. Yosef Gikitila both castigated the practice of wearing a talleth at night, lest one arouse דינים קשים (difficult judgements).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7869&st=&pgnum=11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalqut ha-Gershoni (OH 18)</a> accordingly questions, on what basis do the various rebbes who wear one on Friday night elect to conduct themselves contrary to the aforementioned kabbalistic considerations:</p>\n<p>ועיין בספרי קבלה המתעטף באותו שעה גורם כמה ענינים ומעורר דינים קשים...עכשיו בימינו נתפשט המנהג בין הרבנים והצדיקים להתעטף בערבי שבתות וימים טובים בתפילת ערבית ולא ידע על מה סמכו</p>\n<p>Some argue that the kabbalistic sources that speak against wearing a talleth at night do not intend to include Friday night (see Birkhath Eliyahu, p. 142 question no. 2). And further point to the Siddur Qavanoth ha-Ari as endorsing the practice. Some also cite the precept that the holiness of the night of Shabboth renders it לילה כיום יאיר (a \"night that shineth like the day\") and thus the general concerns at play during the weekday do not come into effect. There are also those that in an attempt to reconcile the kabbalistic opposition to talleth at night with the practice of wearing it on Friday night, lower the talleth from their head to their shoulders (I'll cite the source for this later, time permitting).</p>\n<p>Another aspect of kabbalistic consideration is, according to some sources, the spiritual prowess of the wearer. The Osar ha-Haim: Minhage Rabbenu ha-Qadosh m'Sanz (p. 198) reports in the name of R. Mordekhai Matili that it is only appropriate for those that are capable of effectuating a tiqun nefesh (cosmic rectification of souls) to wear a talleth for Qabbalath Shabboth:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבינו שאל פעם את חתנו הרה\"ק ר' מאטילי ז\"ל מדוע אינו לובש טלית בליל שבת\nקודש לקבלת שבת וקידוש כמנהג צדיקי זמנינו והשיב לו שראה בספה\"ק שמי שאין\nבכוחו ואינו יכול לתקן נפשות ישראל לא ילבוש טלית לקבלת שבת ע\"כ גם הוא\nאינו לובש אמר לו רבינו שמי שתיקן את נפשו רשאי וצריך ללבוש</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In light of all of the above, it would seem that even among those sensitive to kabbalistic considerations, there is no definitive one answer as to the propriety of wearing a talleth on Friday night in order to greet the Shabboth. Rather there are many competing traditions on the matter.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Evidence for the divine inspiration of the Torah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What evidence is there that the Torah was divinely inspired? Historical evidence, prophecies, etc, for example.</p>\n<p>Further reading on this topic would be appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This might not directly answer the question. However, I think it is a good starting point, especially what the Rebbe wrote. I will give a short introduction, and then proceed to the words of the Rebbe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Torah starts with the letter \"beth\" בְּ (bold letter, see below), as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 1:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>בְּ</strong>רֵאשִׁ֖ית בָּרָ֣א אֱלֹהִ֑ים אֵ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְאֵ֥ת הָאָֽרֶץ - IN THE BEGINNING G-d created the heaven and the earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash gives multiple explanations why the Torah starts with a \"B\" and not with a \"A\" (Beth and Aleph), as can be read in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.1.10?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 1:10</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why with a \"bet\"? Because it is an expression of \"blessing.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Midrash, the letter bet symbolises \"berachah\" - blessing(s).</p>\n<p>The same can be read in the commentary of the Shelah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Toldot%2C_Torah_Ohr.10?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Toldot, Torah Ohr 10)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The letter ב symbolises ברכה, blessing. The letter א would have been inappropriate, because it is the first letter of the word ארור, cursed. Had the Torah started with א, many would have thought that this was proof that the whole enterprise of Creation was doomed to failure, i.e. cursed. As a result of such considerations, G–d decided to create the universe by using the letter ב first, hoping that the universe would endure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rebbe however, explains something wonderful, yet different than the opinions in the above cited Midrash and Commentary. The Rebbe explains that these explanations share a common meaning, namely <em>\"that the study of Torah is predicated on an awareness of its divine source\"</em>, as Rabbi Yanki Tauber writes, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/2619825/jewish/1-The-Divinity-of-Torah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe then goes on to explain what exactly the phrase <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Ashkenaz%2C_Weekday%2C_Shacharit%2C_Amidah%2C_Thanksgiving.7?vhe=The_Metsudah_siddur,_1981&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"להשכיחם תורתך\" - to make them forget Your Torah</a> means (in the context of the Romans and the Chanukah miracle). The Rebbe explains <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15851&pgnum=79\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Likkutei Sichos, vol. 3, p. 815)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They had no objection to Jews studying the intellect and wisdom of Torah; all they wanted was that this study should be devoid of any sense that <strong>this is G‑d’s Torah</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Abarbanel in his commentary to the Pesach Haggadah (Zevach Pesach) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zevach_Pesach_on_Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_The_Four_Sons.1.2?ven=Zevach_Pesach,_translated_by_Rabbi_Mark_B._Greenspan,_Oceanside,_N.Y._2019&lang=en&with=About&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>G-d’s teachings are geared to all types of people, answering them “according to each person’s needs.” (Esther 1:8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Torah answers every single person, according to their own needs. Does this not prove the divinity of the Torah? That G-ds own essence is clothed in it.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Bereshit%2C_Torah_Ohr.10?ven=Shney_Luchot_Habrit_by_Rabbi_Eliyahu_Munk&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shelah</a> learns us the deeper meaning behind the phrase \"there are 600.000 words in the Torah\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kabbalists who are deeply immersed in these esoterics described it in these words: \"Torah is the imprint (רושם) of Divinity, whereas אדם is the imprint of Torah. The true revelation of G–d's Divinity is through His holy names, and Torah itself is a string of G–d's holy names. It consists of 600,000 letters which represent the 600,000 souls of Israel. Torah also consists of 248 positive commandments and 365 negative commandments; they represent expressions of G–d's attribute of Mercy and G–d's attribute of Justice respectively. The 365 negative commandments correspond to 365 sinews or tendons in man. Seeing the latter are red, the Kabbalists see in this a symbolism for the attribute of Justice. The 248 positive commandments, however, represent the bones of man, something white, symbolic of the attribute of Mercy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>E.g.: The true revelation of G–d's Divinity is through His holy names, and Torah itself is a string of G–d's holy names.</strong></p>\n<p>Similary, Rabbi Yanki Tauber (adapted from the teachings of the Rebbe) explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The study of Torah requires its student to engage the faculty that is the crowning glory of the human being—the intellect; yet an equally crucial requirement is that the person empty himself of the arrogance and pretension that a human mind—even the most astute and accomplished of human minds—is capable of apprehending the infinite and supra-rational mind of G‑d. The knowledge of and understanding of Torah is a divine gift, bestowed on those who approach its study with the humility and the commitment to “conceive, understand, listen, learn, teach, keep and do”18 that which G‑d desires of us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is the maamid har sinai - what happened by har sinai. 600,000 Jews heard Hashem say the aseres hadibros (10 commandments), and saw the whole event happen. They told their kids, who told their kids, who told their kids... Down to us. There is also the Mesorah from rebbeim - my rebbi's rebbi's rebbi's rebbi's rebbi, all the way back, was taught by Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n\n\n",

If, however, he said to him: \"Your oath is void,\" or \"Your oath is eradicated,\" or something similar in meaning, what he said is of no avail, because none except a husband or a father can revoke an oath.

Isaiah says, “I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood seraphims,” etc. (Isa. 6:1 seq.). Our Sages have already stated all this clearly, and called our attention to it. For they say that the vision of Ezekiel is the same as that of Isaiah, and illustrate their view by the following simile:—Two men saw the king riding, the one a townsman, the other a countryman. The former, seeing that his neighbours know well how the king rides, simply tells them that he saw the king; but the villager, wishing to tell his friends things which they do not know, relates in detail how the king was riding, describes his followers, and the officers who execute his order and command. This remark is a most useful hint; it is contained in the following passage (Ḥagigah, 13 b): “Isaiah saw all that has been seen by Ezekiel: Isaiah is like a townsman that sees the king, Ezekiel like a countryman that sees the king.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.6.1?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a>, that seems to explain that when it says that G-d sits on His throne, this is to mean the kingship of G-d and that He rules, e.g. \"He sits on His throne\". (my own interpretation of this Malbim) As the posuk states \"upon a throne, high and lifted up\".</p>\n<p>Because of the well-known principle, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.1.26?lang=en&p2=Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_1.46.7&lang2=en&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">“The language of the Torah is like the language of man.”</a> - the Rambam explains, G-d is described in Ezekiel for example, with physical features.

These brachos would not be l'vatala because one needs to make a bracha before eating but they would be she'eina tzaricha because if that person would have washed first then they wouldn't have made those brachos.</p>\n<p>A bracha l'vatala on the other hand is a bracha that should not be made at all.

Is there leniency in consuming cholov stam if one can easily afford Yisroel, but wants to save some money? Or if there's a stam product that tastes much better, or doesn't get moldy in 2 minutes like cholov Yisroel? Conversly, which sources prohibit this lenient use? Thanks.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>First, you are mistaken about Rav Moshe's position. I know from his son Rav Reuvein that they routinely had chalav hacompanies at home. Rav Moshe held chalav yisrael was no required when the milk had USDA certification. Full stop. He did say it was a nice chumerah (stringency) for schools, as a teaching opportunity. Now, on to your answer.</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe coined the term \"chalav hacompanies\" to distinguish it from the prohibited milk, \"chalav stam\" (literally: just plain milk). But most observant Jews in the US were drinking it already before Rav Moshe got to America, never mind writing any of his series of <em>teshuvos</em> on the subject. And this was not a lack of observance, but the ruling of rabbis like R Jacob Joseph (rav of New York), the Ridbaz (R Yaakov Dovid Wilovsky, when he was rav of Chicago), R Yisrael Avraham Abba Krieger (rav of Boston), and others.</p>\n<p>According to the Chazon Ish (Yoreh Dei'ah 41:4), the precedent was 17th century Italy, which also had government regulations on milk. The Peri Chadash (R' Chizkiya da Silva) ruled (Yoreh Dei'ah 115:6) that chalav yisrael was a ruling in the gemara. Not a new law, but an application of existing halakhah to the fact that we cannot really know what's in the milk we buy. And since they did have reason to believe the cow's milk was really entirely cow's milk, the gemara's ruling didn't apply.</p>\n<p>The Chasam Sofer (YD 107) disagreed, saying that chalav yisrael was indeed its own derabbanan (a piece of rabbinic legislation) and is therefore prohibited whether or not the fear of non-kosher milk is realistic. And this is the position of the Pischei Teshuvah (YD 115:2 cites the Chasam Sofer), the Chayei Adam (Chokmas Adam 67:1) and the Arukh haShulchan (YD 115).</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (starting with Igeros Moshe YD vol 1, #46-48) had to defend existing norms of his new community. He didn't use the Peri Chadash; rather he argued that even according to the Chasam Sofer chalav hacompanies is permitted. Rav Moshe gives other examples where knowing with some certainty is equivalent to seeing. And therefore chalav hacompanies is \"watched\" and therefore conforms to the legislation.</p>\n<p>In that sense, Americans only think they're following Rav Moshe and his take on the Chasam Sofer when they drink chalav hacompanies. This is only because his teshuvos were the first in print.</p>\n<p>And notice that either way, drinking chalav hacompanies isn't framed as a qulah (leniency), but baseline law. As per Rav Moshe's own consumption, and his phrasing in all his teshuvos on the subject, except for the one (YD vol II, #35) written to a day school adminstrator, where he makes an argument about teaching the idea of willingness to sacrifice to do beyond the minimum.</p>\n<p>When can you be lenient? How much motive? Rav Moshe would actually allow you (if you're not shopping for a yeshiva) to simply buy whichever you choose. Maybe he would say -- although I am just guessing -- it is better to buy chalav yisrael because it means supporting more Jews.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To be clear about my own biases: R Kreiger, the aforementioned rav of Boston who was among those I cited who allowed chalav hacompanies, was my great-grandfather. I personally grew up drinking chh\"c, and my family still does. I personally switched to chalav yisrael only when my first cycle of Arukh haShulchan Yomi got to Yoreh Dei'ah 115. (Compounded by the fact that so much of the junk I shouldn't be eating but was buying from the vending machine at work anyway were OUD.)</p>\n\n\n",

Why cant Jesus exist to scoop up the lost?? Why cant I practice Judaism and still believe God sent Jesus, to point us back towards Judaism?Thank you for your time and advice.</p>\n<p>Im trying to picture a life not believing in Jesus, I just cant it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You can be a Jew and recognize Jesus as being real. I recognize Jesus as a literal person who existed. I say recognize because Jesus existing is not a fact, we don't have enough extra biblical evidence to prove Jesus existed in the way we can prove that Pontius Pilate existed. I just believe Jesus existed because of the dedication his followers showed in spreading the teachings of Jesus and were willing to die for these teachings, I can't imagine doing that for someone that never existed.</p>\n<p>But in terms of can you be Jewish and believe in Jesus as Messiah... That's almost impossible to do, for many few reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Messiah was supposed to bring world peace. I believe Christians as a group have killed more people than anyone else. Peace came no closer to reality because of Jesus.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Messiah was supposed to help the tribes of Israel first, and through the nations of Israel reaching such a high point of righteousness, the rest of the world would be enriched. Even Jesus himself claimed he was here only for the lost sheep of Israel. Unfortunately within his lifetime Jesus did not help the 12 tribes of Israel in any meaningful way. Even though his disciples apparently accomplished a lot more, it did not bring about a positive change for the 12 tribes of Israel.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It can be argued that Jesus had no intention of starting a new religion, and I believe this is true based on my readings of the gospels and on historical realities of early christians before the centralization of the catholic church.  Early church communities such as the Ebionites are known from Catholic records as having Hebrew copies of Matthew that taught that Jesus was a man, the son of Joseph, and that all \"Christians\" need to be observant, and possibly even Pharisaical Jews. As a result of these very Jewish beliefs, they were destroyed by the Catholic church. Fast forward thousands of years to all major sects of modern Christianity, we find you MUST believe Jesus was not the son of Joseph, you MUST believe Jesus did away with the laws of Israel/God, and you MUST believe that Jesus is somehow also God? All of those ideas are impossible to have in Judaism.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Continuing with that line of thinking, if you want to \"be a Christian,\" you are required to have beliefs that are incompatible with Judaism. If you want to believe in Jesus in a real legitimate Jewish way like the Ebionites, then you are not a Christian. If you want to believe that Jesus was a Rabbi, one of many Rabbis that have existed, you could possibly remain a religious Jew, but Christians would reject you. The only way to be a part of a modern Christian movement is that you are required to have beliefs that are just incompatible with Judaism. Even organizations like Jews for Jesus preach things that are incompatible with Judaism.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Is it possible to believe in a figure named Jesus and still be religiously Jewish? Sure I think it's possible, but so unlikely that it's almost impossible. Because you would have to reject 99% of Christian dogma, teachings, and beliefs about Jesus AND you'd have to reject all Christian scriptures outside of the gospels, and also exclude Luke from being part of the gospels.</p>\n<p>Update</p>\n<p>For those who want to know about historical sources for Jesus. We have a reliable source by the Roman Senator and Historian Tacitus. You can read the background of the text in the source but I'll post the contents of the source below. I'm posting it to show how possible it is that Jesus existed, and to illustrate how little we know of the actual historical Jesus. Most of the best sources are really only discussing the current existence of the followers of Jesus.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But all human efforts, all the lavish gifts of the emperor, and the\npropitiations of the gods, did not banish the sinister belief that the\nconflagration was the result of an order. Consequently, to get rid of\nthe report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite\ntortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by\nthe populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered\nthe extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one\nof our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous\nsuperstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in\nJudæa, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all\nthings hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their\ncentre and become popular.

This was in 1994 or 1995; as it was published before Princess Diana died, the \"Prayer for the Royal Family\" included references not only to \"Our sovereign lady, Queen Elizabeth\" and \"Elizabeth, the Queen Mother\" but also to both the Prince of Wales and the Princess of Wales.  (This is from memory; unfortunately, I lost the siddur some time in the early 2000s, so I no longer have it in my collection.)</p>\n<p>The recent death of Queen Elizabeth and the ascension of Charles to the throne means, I suppose, that future editions of the Authorised Daily Prayer Book will include a new version the \"Prayer for the Royal Family\".  This has me wondering:  How many different editions of the Authorised Prayer Book have there been?  Did they issue a new version every time there was a change in the Royal Family?  For example, did they revise it when Charles and Diana divorced, and then again after her death?  What about when Charles was born, or when the Queen Mother died?

One example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shim'on bar Yohai said: If a person was perfectly just all his days and at the end he rebelled, he lost all he worked for his entire life... Shim'on ben Lakish said: ...If a person was perfectly evil all his days and at the end he repents, the Holy One, praise to Him, receives him. [Peah Y 1:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I believe earthly punishment by a bet din (death penalty, lashes, fines, shunning, etc.) is not waived even if the perpetrator repents.  Is this correct?

[This is] like the matter that is stated (Genesis 4:13-14), “My punishment is too great to bear! Since You have banished me this day from the soil, and I must avoid Your presence; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whoever finds me will kill me.” However through repentance, most of his iniquity was forgiven, the main part of his punishment was removed and he was rescued from death - as it is stated (Genesis 4:15), “and the Lord put a mark on Cain, lest anyone who met him should kill him.” But the punishment of exile remained for him, as it is stated (Genesis 4:12), “and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.” Yet he had mentioned [his] migration with a double expression (fugitive and wanderer); whereas after the repentance, it is [only] stated (Genesis 4:16), “and he dwelt in the land of wandering.” (Sefaria)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shaarei_Teshuvah.4.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4:17-</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל מה שכתוב (שם). כי ביום הזה יכפר עליכם לטהר אתכם שהוא אמור על הטהרה שהשם יתברך מטהר אותנו מן העון ומכפר עלינו כפרה שלמה ביום הכפורים בלא יסורים. זה נאמר על מצות לא תעשה. אבל על כרתות ומיתות בית דין תשובה ויום הכפורים תולין ויסורין ממרקין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But that which is written (earlier in Leviticus 16:30), “For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to purify you” - which is written about the purification that God, may He be blessed, is to purify us from iniquity and atone for us [with] a complete atonement on Yom Kippur without afflictions - is stated about [simple] negative commandments.

In addition thereto he should take to witness Him Who knoweth all secrets that forever he will not turn to repeat that sin again, according to what it is said: \"Say unto Him.… neither will we call any more the work of our hands our gods\" (Hos. 14.3–4).

Many of the later Aharonim/Poseqim use the term בלורית to describe this haircut, however they are not using it in the technical sense in which it originally refers to a forbidden heathen haircut (the Tosefta Shabboth 7:1 deems a בלורית darkhei ha-Emori, the ways of the Emorites).</p>\n<p>There is a debate about what exactly the classical בלורית consists of (see Rashi on Sotah 49b and Rambam, H. AZ 11:1, and Beth Yosef YD 178 for different interpretations of the Rambam). However what is contemporarily known as a בלורית does not satisfy these positions. Rabbi Yaaqov Sasson (following the rulings of his grandfather R. Obhadia Yosef) clarifies (<a href=\"https://halachayomit.co.il/he/Default.aspx?HalachaID=4577&PageIndex=78\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">האם מותר לגדל בלורית</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין איסור בגידול הבלורית באופן שמגדל קצת שיער לצד הפנים. (שנקרא\nבזמנינו \"בלורית\"). ואין איסור בגידול בלורית כפי שנוהגים בזמנינו, משום\nשאין זה בגדר חוקות הגויים.</p>\n<p>There is no prohibition in growing a בלורית in a manner wherein the hair on the sides is grown shorter (which is called in our times\n\"בלורית\"). And there is no prohibition on growing a בלורית in the\nmanner that people are accustomed to in our day, since this does not\nfall within the purview of following gentile ways.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Aharonim/Poseqim that criticize the contemporary בלורית (aka a \"tshup\") primarily condemn it on two grounds: 1) That it is a conceited hairstyle, and 2) its effects on the proper donning of tefillin.</p>\n<p>For example, the Mishnah Berurah 27:15 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתב בספר מחצית השקל ורע עלי המעשה של אותן האנשים שמגדלין בלורותיהן\nמלבד כי הוא דרך שחץ וגאוה עיין מה שכתוב ביו\"ד סימן קע\"ו יש בו איסור\nבהנחת תפילין דכיון דגדולין הרבה ליכא למימר בהו היינו רביתייהו וחוצצים\nעי\"ש ובלאו חציצה נמי בשביל הני שערות המרובים א\"א לצמצם שיהיו מהודקין\nומונחין על מקומן כדין</p>\n<p>In the work Mahasith ha-Sheqel, the author writes \"I am vexed by the\nconduct of those people who allow their forelocks (בלורותיהן) to grow. Apart from\nthe fact that this is haughty and arrogant behavior (see YD 176), it\nalso involves the transgression of a prohibition, when one dons\ntefillin. For in view of the fact that the locks of the hair are very\nlong, one cannot argue that they constitute normal growth and they are\ntherefore ruled as an interposition between the tefillin unit and the\nflesh.\" See there. Actually this practice would also be objectionable\nwithout the question of the interposition. For because of those\nnumerous hairs it is impossible to adjust the position of the tefillin\nwith exactitude so that they will be tightly donned in their proper\nplace, in accordance with halakhic requirements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as the first concern comes into play, this is more in the realm of middoth than outright din per se, and accordingly some take a more lenient tact whilst cautioning against growing the hair too long and/or being preoccupied with looks. On the issue of an interposition between the tefillin and the head, the Arukh ha-Shulhan takes the position that even long hair in its own natural place is not a problem of interposition, however where a בלורית is grown such that its hair encircles/envelops the hair of another area of the head then it would be a problem (AH 27:15):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש רוצים להחמיר גם כשהשיער גדול מאוד. ואיני רואה בזה שום טעם, דאיזה\nגבול תתן להשיער? ושיער הראש כעצם הראש דמי. ואולי אם יש לו בלורית שמסבב\nגם צדדי השיער של מקום אחר למקום הנחת תפילין – בזה וודאי יש חציצה, אבל\nלא השיער הטבעי הגדל במקום זה. וכן המנהג פשוט, ואין לפקפק כלל בזה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This perspective seems to allow for a minor/moderate \"tshup\" provided that it doesn't fall subject to the aforementioned consideration.</p>\n\n\n",

H. Beth ha-Behirah 1:2-3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כיון שנכנסו לארץ, העמידו המשכן בגלגל ארבע עשרה שנה שכבשו ושחלקו.  ומשם\nבאו לשילה, ובנו שם בית של אבנים; ופרסו יריעות המשכן עליו, ולא הייתה שם\nתקרה.  ושלוש מאות ותשע ושישים שנה, עמד מקדש שילה.  וכשמת עלי, חרב ובאו\nלנוב ובנו שם מקדש; וכשמת שמואל, חרב ובאו לגבעון ובנו שם מקדש.  ומגבעון\nבאו לבית העולמים.  וימי נוב וגבעון, שבע וחמישים שנה. כיון שנבנה המקדש\nבירושלים--נאסרו כל המקומות כולן לבנות בהן בית לה', ולהקריב בהן קרבן;\nואין שם בית לדורי הדורות אלא בירושלים בלבד, ובהר המורייה שבה--שנאמר\n\"ויאמר דויד--זה הוא, בית ה' האלוהים; וזה מזבח לעולה, לישראל\" (דברי\nהימים א כב,א), ואומר \"זאת מנוחתי, עדי עד\" (תהילים קלב,יד).</p>\n<p>After [the Jews] entered The Land [of Israel], they erected the\nSanctuary in Gilgal during the fourteen years in which they conquered\nand divided [the land]. From there, they came to Shiloh, built a house\nof stone, and spread the curtains of the Sanctuary over it. It did not\nhave a roof. The sanctuary of Shiloh stood for 369 years. When Eli\ndied, it was destroyed.[Afterwards,] they came to Nobh and built a\nsanctuary. When Samuel died, it was destroyed. And they came to Gibh'on\nand built a sanctuary. From Gibh'on, they came to the eternal structure\n[in Jerusalem]. The days [the sanctuary stood] in Nov and Givon were\n57 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this it would seem that the Mishkan at Shiloh and Nobh were destroyed. It was then rebuilt in Gibh'on. From Gibh'on we transitioned to the Miqdash in Yerushalayim. The components of the Mishkan which would not naturally be incorporated into a permanent structure were sequestered away, as it states in Sotah 9a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאמר מר: משנבנה מקדש ראשון, נגנז אהל מועד, קרשיו, קרסיו ובריחיו\nועמודיו ואדניו. היכא? אמר רב חסדא אמר אבימי: תחת מחילות של היכל</p>\n<p>After the first Temple was erected, the Tent of Meeting was stored\naway, its boards, hooks, bars, pillars and sockets. Where [were they\nstored]? — R. Hisda said in the name of Abimi: Beneath the crypts of\nthe Heikhal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this tradition, those components which were not incorporated into the Miqdash were sequestered away beneath the outer sanctum (Heikhal). I do not believe we have information on what happened to those components after the destruction of the first Miqdash.</p>\n<p>Q2</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What happened to the set of tablets that were housed inside?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The luhoth (tablets) were within the Aron (Ark), what happened to the Aron after the destruction of the first Miqdash is a bit of a mystery. The Rambam states (H. Beth ha-Behirah 4:1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבן הייתה בקודש הקודשים במערבו, ועליה היה הארון מונח, ולפניו צנצנת המן\nומטה אהרון.  ובעת שבנה שלמה את הבית, וידע שסופו ליחרב, בנה מקום לגנוז\nבו הארון למטה, במטמונייות עמוקות ועקלקלות; ויאשייהו המלך ציווה וגנזו\nבמקום שבנה שלמה, שנאמר \"ויאמר ללויים המבינים לכל ישראל הקדושים לה',\nתנו את ארון הקודש בבית אשר בנה שלמה בן דויד מלך ישראל--אין לכם משא,\nבכתף; עתה, עבדו את ה' אלוהיכם . . .\" (דברי הימים ב לה,ג). ונגנז עימו\nמטה אהרון והצנצנת, ושמן המשחה; וכל אלו לא חזרו בבית שני.  ואף אורים\nותומים שהיו בבית שני--לא היו משיבין ברוח הקודש ולא היו נשאלין בהן,\nשנאמר \"עד עמוד כוהן, לאורים ותומים\" (ראה עזרא ב,סג; נחמיה ז,סה); ולא\nהיו עושין אותן אלא כדי להשלים שמונה בגדים לכוהן גדול, כדי שלא יהא\nמחוסר בגדים.</p>\n<p>The Ark was placed on a stone in the western portion of the Holy of\nHolies. The vial of manna and Aharon's staff were placed before it.\nWhen Solomon built the Temple, he was aware that it would ultimately\nbe destroyed. [Therefore,] he constructed a chamber, in which the ark\ncould be entombed below [the Temple building] in deep, maze-like\nvaults. King Josiah commanded that [the Ark] be entombed in the\nchamber built by Solomon, as it is said (II Chronicles 35:3): \"And he\nsaid to the Levites who would teach wisdom to all of Israel: 'Place\nthe Holy Ark in the chamber built by Solomon, the son of David, King\nof Israel. You will no [longer] carry it on your shoulders. Now, serve\nthe Lord, your God.'When it was entombed, Aharon's staff, the vial of\nmanna, and the oil used for anointing were entombed with it. All these\n[sacred articles] did not return in the Second Temple. Similarly, the\nUrim V'Tumim that existed in the Second Temple did not answer with\nRuach HaKodesh (Divine inspiration) and questions were not asked of\nthem, as stated [in Ezra 2:63]: \"until a priest will arise with the\nUrim V'Tumim.\" [In the Second Temple,] they only made them to fulfill\nthe requirement of eight garments for the High Priest. Thus, the High\nPriest would not lack one of the required garments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this view, the Aron is still somewhere deep beneath the earth on Har ha-Bayith (the Temple Mount) in Yerushalayim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Where are its components?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam writes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Chosen_Temple.1.2?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=bi&with=Har%20HaMoriyah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Hilchos Beis HaBechirah, Halacha 1:2)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From Givon, they came to the eternal structure [in Jerusalem].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Chosen_Temple.1.2?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=bi&with=Har%20HaMoriyah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The HarHamoriyah</a>, a commentary written by Rabbi Meir Yonah Brancki (1817 - 1891 CE) writes on halacha 2 from Mishneh Torah; Hilchos Beis HaBechirah, chapter 1 that the parts of the Mishkan were disassembled and put away, e.g. stored away (my own, loose translation of this piece).

It is because a prosecutor [kateigor] cannot become an advocate [sanneigor].

A man who has relations with his arusah in his father-in-law’s home is punished with “stripes for rebelliousness”.

If so, in the second step mentioned, only a second sexual intercourse is therefore forbidden, but not the first? In fact I noticed “again” in Hebrew sheniyyah thus implying a previous sexual intercourse already occurred precisely with the “consecration” and which cannot be repeated before the nisuin.

(Or for that matter, avoid places/times where it's clear that almost everybody assimilated -- forced or otherwise.)</li>\n<li>Live in a Jewish community, maintaining a connection to the outside world's Jewish mainstream. You'll at least need to get wind of the <em>Yad HaChazaka</em> circa 1200; ideally someplace where you'll obtain a Shulchan Aruch in the 1500s as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ashkenaz, Sefard, Edot Mizrach, you name it.</p>\n<p>What's the best strategy?

A group  of several hundred Jews led by Temple Service Cohenim arrived there after the destruction of the first Beit haMikdash, so a strong Jewish community was already in place. The island is on the Mediterrenean, and so was in contact with the major centers of Jewish learning throughout history, but given its remote location, it was far enough from centers of power to avoid forced conversions or expulsions.</p>\n<p>As for avoiding relocation, there are still over a thousand Jews living there today, some of whom claim to be able to trace their ancestry to that first boatload of Cohenim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The first part of my strategy would be to reconsider my goals.</p>\n<p>Relocation, is, what primarily has saved the Jewish people. Holding on to a specific region or area is not the strategy route for survival. I would be open and willing to relocate.</p>\n<p>For a high quality of life, living near ports or large epicenters, anywhere with an access to commerce or trade routes, would be ideal. These areas are wealthier and lead to higher quality life, such as access to more foods and service, ie. fresh foods and doctors. This also plays into obtaining Jewish books and culture through trade routes and visiting rabbis.</p>\n<p>In terms of attacks, persecutions, and forced assimilation, I would refer back to the ability to relocate. It is far easier to move away from war and persecution than to find the root of evil and try to change its ways (if that is even possible). Practically speaking this would mean living in the suburbs of a city or in a city itself, and being wealthy enough to travel, if necesssary.</p>\n\n\n",

So, while Moshe didn't need the earlier texts, G-d in His Wisdom did at times choose to use them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bereihis 5:1 refers to the Book of the Descendents of Adam. Bereishis Rabba 25:1-4 takes this as a literal book.</li>\n<li>Shemos Rabba 5:22 has Moshe in Egypt reading about the Flood in an already-existing book of Bereishis.</li>\n<li>Similarly Rashi (Gittin 60a \"katuv\") talks about pre-existing books about Creation, Noach, and Avraham.

This is a slightly different topic, so I will just mention their existence. Shemos 24:7 speaks of the existence of a Seifer haBeris, which existed already even though the Torah hadn't been (according to R Yochanan) or at least most of it (Reish Laqish).

Significantly less-so, and I'll explain:</p>\n<p>While we cannot say with utmost certainty that we have found every ancient record from that time period, we don't currently have any clear, straightforward sources that state that the Danites invaded Greece and took over Sparta (personally, I'm not entirely sure why you suggested the Danites of all tribes.

On the face of things, it seems that the Danites (ודן; and Dan) are mentioned here, trading alongside Greece (יון). However, in context this interpretation doesn't make much sense because all the other names are place-names. The distinctions between ethnic groups and places is made by usage of terms such as '<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.27.21?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nesi'ay</a>' (princes of) or '<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.27.15?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bnei</a>' (sons of). It's possible that this is a reference to the City of Dan in northern Israel, but then why would Dan be paired with Greece? All pairs mentioned in the chapter are places that neighbored one another. For these reasons, I think the verse was interpreted both by Sefaria's translation and some commentators as referring to a place called ודן, \"Vedan\".<sup>2</sup> By the way, trading ties between the Levant and Greece during the Late Assyrian and Babylonian periods are also evidenced in archeological. See <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/archaeology/cilicia-pottery-shows-israel-part-of-vast-trade-route-in-persian-period-639349\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for example.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The strongest basis for an ethnic connection between Sparta and the Nation of Israel comes from the story of the attempted treaty between the Maccabees and the Spartans during the 2nd century BCE. The story is brought both in Maccabees 1 and Antiquities of the Jews. The Spartans had first reached out for a treaty during the time of the High Priest Chonyo (Onias) some decades prior:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"King Arius of Sparta to Onias the High Priest, greetings. <strong>We have found a document about the Spartans and the Jews indicating that we are related and that both of our nations are descended from Abraham</strong>. Now that we have discovered this, please send us a report about your situation. In reply, we will send you a letter indicating that we are willing to share our possessions, including cattle and property, if you will do the same. We have given orders to our ambassadors to give you a full report about these matters.\" (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Maccabees%2012&version=GNT\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maccabees 1:12:20-23</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a very interesting claim, discussed a bit further in the various answers brought to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12310/how-are-spartans-the-son-of-abraham\">this question</a>.<sup>3</sup> With that said, we must ask: If the Spartans were actually Danites, shouldn't they have leaned on that as basis for a treaty with Judah? Why claim cousinship via Abraham if you can claim brotherhood via Israel? The Jewish reply, likewise, makes no mention of such brotherly-tribal connections. So it seems that neither group, during the 2nd century BCE, was aware of this hypothetical closer connection.</p>\n<p>On to archeological evidence: The City of Dan was most prominently excavated by the late <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Biran\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avraham Biran</a>. Currently Yifat Thareani is in the process of continuing and publishing his work. She believes that though the city was destroyed during the initial Assyrian conquest, it was subsequently rebuilt as an Assyrian governmental center. Further archeological evidence shows that the people of Dan and neighboring sites were not exiled. This falls in line with Dan's lack of mention in the list of places in the Galilee exiled by the Assyrians (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.15.29?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kings 2:15:29</a>) (see <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/37344620/Revenge_of_the_Conquered_Paths_of_Resistance_in_the_Assyrian_City_of_Dan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26751861#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for example). I believe it goes without saying that neither is there evidence that the people of Dan simply up and left, moving westward towards the sea and from there towards Greece.</p>\n<p>On the Grecian end (i.e., in Greece itself), there is evidence for ties between Grecian peoples and the Phoenicians (<a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/42166093/1_The_Archaeological_Background_of_the_Earliest_Graffiti_and_Finds_from_Methone_in_J_Strauss_Clay_I_Malkin_Y_Z_Tzifopoulos_eds_Panellenes_at_Methone_Graph%C3%AA_in_Late_Geometric_and_Protoarchaic_Methone_Macedonia_ca_700_BCE_Trends_in_Classics_Suppl_Vol_44_2017_20_35\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">for example</a>), but nothing, from what I can tell, of Israelites and Greeks.</p>\n<p>So, in short, I don't think this thoery is really plausible at the moment. Perhaps one day we may yet uncover a strong piece of evidence for it, but that seems unlikely at the moment, from the sheer lack of evidence anywhere.</p>\n<p>Side-note: It would be helpful if you could provide the sources you refer to in your question, as I did not manage to find any info on Israelite tombs in Sparta.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I am familiar with the conspiracy theory that the Danites were originally Greek before journeying to the Land of Israel in the Bronze Age or early Iron Age. Other than a single etymological connection (Dan-Danoi) there isn't any hardcore evidence for this. If it's because of the verse ודן למה יגור אוניות (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.5.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Judges 5:17</a>), a much more plausible understanding of the term יגור is fear; \"why does Dan fear the ships?\". See <a href=\"https://tanachthoughts.blogspot.com/2022/02/dans-naviphobia-sequel.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this post</a> I wrote on the matter.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Ho'il Moshe <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31890&pgnum=152\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">seems to understand</a> also Uzal (אוזל) as a place-name (per <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.10.27?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 10:27</a>), though this complicates the meaning of ודן ויון. But unfortunately he doesn't clarify further.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> On the other, people don't always wonder why the Spartans even approached the Jews in the first place. We're talking about supposed genealogical relations that had branched out and separated thousands of years prior. Some scholars believe this letter was a forgery (<a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=I8LDFCBmNQ4C&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=academia%20letter%20of%20areus%20abraham&source=bl&ots=ZXfuMh31su&sig=ACfU3U03bqfFM4HnM6vVrt_QhF7GOSNXDQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBncyOqqD6AhUBWcAKHfD4CCMQ6AF6BAgWEAM#v=onepage&q=academia%20letter%20of%20areus%20abraham&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">for example</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi H. Guggenheimer discusses this point in his commentary on Chumash \"<a href=\"https://www.urimpublications.com/reading-the-torah.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reading the Torah</a>\", <em>parshat Bemidbar</em>. In a song of Devorah, there are words critical of <em>shevet Dan</em>, who during the war with Sisera boarded the ships. As we know, Dan was the 2nd most populous tribe after Yehudah in the desert, but they provided only 600 warriors in all of the book of Judges (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.18.11?ven=The_Early_Prophets,_by_Everett_Fox._New_York,_Schocken_Books,_2014&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">18:11</a>). According to historian Yigal Yadin, the words of Devorah suggest that people from the tribe of Dan made exodus to establish the state of Sparta and Mycenaean civilization. It seems that they were the Danaos mentioned by Homer in the Trojan war. Simcha Jacobovici made a video where he showed that the pottery in the city of Dan fully matched the pottery from Mycenaean Greece.</p>\n\n\n",

In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.14.28-29?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 14:28-29</a>, it states, concerning the \"gifts to the poor\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth in that year, all the tithe of thy produce, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:and the Levite, (because he has no part or inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the L-rd thy G-d may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam in his Mishneh Torah explains <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Gifts_to_the_Poor.6.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Hilchos Matnot Aniyim 6:4)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>In the third and sixth years of that cycle</strong>, by contrast, after the first tithe is separated, a different tithe is separated from the remainder and <strong>it is given to the poor</strong>. It is called the tithe for the poor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last week, my chavrusa and I were discussing this topic, since it was in last weeks parasha. My chavrusa asked me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>why are the gifts to the poor only in the 3rd and 6th year?, why not\nimmediately in the 1st year?, since poor people are really in need of\nany support of that kind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is there any source that explain this? <strong>Why wait until the 3rd year for gifs to the poor?

As mentioned before, there are sins that are far worse, and I know there are some that go beyond to what I have written, (Willfully rejecting a brit milah, and not fulfilling Korban pesach on your table)</p>\n<p>So why, \"Incest, Murder, Idolatry\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Concerning your question on why these are the three cardinal sins, the Gemara learns us the following <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arakhin.15b.19?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Arakhin 15b)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With regard to forbidden sexual relations it is written that when Potiphar’s wife attempted to seduce Joseph he responded: “How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against G-d” (Genesis 39:9). With regard to bloodshed it is written, after Cain murdered his brother: “And Cain said to the L-rd: My punishment is greater than I can bear” (Genesis 4:13). The Torah describes each of these three cardinal sins with the word “great” in the singular, whereas malicious speech is described with the plural term “great things,” indicating that it is equivalent to all three of the other transgressions together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the Gemara is teaching us that the Torah uses the word \"great\" in describing these sins.I'll demonstrate it in the posuks below:</p>\n<p><strong>Incest</strong>:With regard to forbidden sexual relations it is written that when Potiphar’s wife attempted to seduce Joseph he responded: “How can I do this <strong>great wickedness</strong>, and sin against G-d” (Genesis 39:9)</p>\n<p><strong>Murder</strong>: With regard to bloodshed it is written, after Cain murdered his brother: “And Cain said to the L-rd: My punishment is <strong>greater</strong> than I can bear” (Genesis 4:13).</p>\n<p><strong>Idolatry</strong>: And it is written with regard to idol worship: “And Moses returned to the Lord, and said: Oh, this people have sinned <strong>a great sin</strong>, and have made for themselves a god of gold” (Exodus 32:31).</p>\n<p>Concerning lashon hara, the Gemara explains further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara asks: Granted that with regard to malicious speech the verse uses the plural: “Great things,” but the plural indicates a minimum of two. If so, one can only say that malicious speech is equivalent to two of the cardinal transgressions. The Gemara responds: Which of them could be taken out as less than the other two? All three are equal. Therefore malicious speech must be equivalent to all three.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The base for lashon hara in this Gemara is found in a posuk in Tehillim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“May the L-rd cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks <strong>great things</strong>” (Psalms 12:4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Extra sources: <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/50002/p/1/t/0.31993801526058221234/fs/iWuO4wJFNumY1ilXgSSxVuP3ov9Jh5ZPQM2DTDICJ0Df/start/240/end/272/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">תלמוד בבלי</a>, see also footnote 31-32 in sefer <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/626752/p/15/t/0.31993801526058221234/fs/iWuO4wJFNumY1ilXgSSxVuP3ov9Jh5ZPQM2DTDICJ0Df/start/3032/end/3072/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הקדמת הרוקח</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אולי עפ\"י מדרש תהלים מזמור יב יכרת ה' כל שפתי חלקות לשון מדברת גדולות תהילים יב ד בר קפרא בשם רבי יונתן אמר קשה לשון הרע שכבר בא דוד וכרתו ברוח הקודש שנאמר יכרת ה' כל שפתי חלקות קשה לשון הרע משלש עבירות שנקראו גדולות עבודה זרה וגלוי עריות ושפיכות דמים בעבודה זרה כתיב אנא חטא העם הזה חטאה גדולה שמות לב לא בגילוי עריות כתיב ואיך אעשה הרעה הגדולה הזאת בראשית לט ט בשפיכות דמים כתיב גדול עוני מנשוא בראשית ד יג ובלשון הרע כתיב יכרת ה' כל שפתי חלקות לשון מדברת גדולות\"' אולי עפ\"י אבות ג יג רבי עקיבא אומר שחוק וקלות ראש מרגילין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shaarei_Teshuvah.3.209?lang=bi&p2=Sanhedrin.74a.12&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaarei Teshuva 3:201-209</a></p>\n<p>But why?</p>\n<p>The Gemara elsewhere (Sanhedrin 74a) explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With regard to all other transgressions in the Torah, if a person is told: Transgress this prohibition and you will not be killed, he may transgress that prohibition and not be killed, because the preserving of his own life overrides all of the Torah’s prohibitions. This is the halakha concerning all prohibitions except for those of idol worship, forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed. Concerning those prohibitions, one must allow himself to be killed rather than transgress them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reason why there are three cardinal sins, and these are incest, murder and idolatry, I would like to begin explaining, by bringing a Rambam.</p>\n<p>In his <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904980/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah; Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah 5:5</a> he explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, if gentiles told [a group of Jews]: \"Give us one of you to kill. If not, we will kill all of you,\" they should allow themselves all to be killed rather than give over a single soul to [the gentiles].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Concerning forbidden sexual relationships, the Torah compares this to actually murdering someone:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But if a man find a betrothed girl in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: <strong>then only the man that lay with her shall die</strong>: See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.22.26?lang=bi&with=Yoma&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 86a</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Concerning idolatry, during Shema, we read \"And thou shalt love the L-rd thy G-d with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Devarim 6:5)</a>.</p>\n<p>On this posuk in Devarim 6:5, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Yoma.82a.11&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara in Yoma 86a</a> explains that \"with all thy soul\" (as we read in the Shema), actually means that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rather, it is to teach that if there is a person whose body is more beloved to him than his property, therefore it is stated: “With all your soul.” The verse teaches that one must be willing to sacrifice his life to sanctify God’s name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You ask \"What is the ultimate sin?\"  There isn't one.  The commandments are not ranked.  The Mishnah says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וֶהֱוֵי זָהִיר בְּמִצְוָה קַלָּה כְבַחֲמוּרָה, שֶׁאֵין אַתָּה יוֹדֵעַ מַתַּן שְׂכָרָן שֶׁל מִצְוֹת. רַבִּי אוֹמֵר\nRabbi [Yehudah haNasi] said: Be as scrupulous in observing a [seemingly] minor commandment as a [seemingly] major commandment, because you do not know the value of each commandment.  [Pirkei Avot 2:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, there are hints that the 3 cardinal sins should be on top, or the Ten Commandments, or the 7 Noahide laws, or the \"suprarational\" commands (chukkim), or the commandments that recur most frequently, or that cost the most, or any commandments strongly emphasized by Chazal:  \"Idolatry is so serious a sin that its rejection fulfills the whole Torah. [Nedarim 25a]\";  \"Whoever speaks slander increases his sins even up to [the degree of] idolatry, sexual immorality and murder.[Arakhin 15b, Peah Y 1:1]\"; \"Tzedakah is as important as all the other commandments put together. [Bava Batra 9a]\"; \"Not giving tzedakah is tantamount to idolatry. [Ketubot 68a]\"; \"One mitzvah involving pain is worth a hundred mitzvot that do not.\" [Avot de Rabbi Natan 3:6, Jerusalem Talmud]; even \"tzitzit is equal to all the mitzvot, because the gematria of tzitzit is 613!\".  When the Rambam put out his 13 primciples of faith, the reaction [Hasdai Crescas, Yosef Albo] was:  Is the rest of Judaism any less important?</p>\n<p>So there is no No. 1 mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>What is the ultimate sin?</p>\n<p>Answer: The next one you are about to do now.</p>\n<p>Why? Logic: The ones you have committed you cannot go back in time and avoid. The ones you have not done yet are not in your reality to deal with. So the ultimate sin is the one you can stop now. whatever it is.</p>\n<p>As for the Cardinal three?</p>\n<p>Traditionally it is because these are the three mentioned by which one must give up their life rather than commit them.</p>\n<p>Other sins do not have the obligation of giving up one's life to avoid them.</p>\n<p>See Talmud Sanhedrin 74a.</p>\n<p>א\"ר יוחנן משום ר\"ש בן יהוצדק נימנו וגמרו בעליית בית נתזה בלוד כל עבירות שבתורה אם אומרין לאדם עבור ואל תהרג יעבור ואל יהרג חוץ מעבודת כוכבים וגילוי עריות ושפיכות דמים</p>\n<p>§ The Gemara now considers which prohibitions are permitted in times of mortal danger. Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: The Sages who discussed this issue counted the votes of those assembled and concluded in the upper story of the house of Nitza in the city of Lod: With regard to all other transgressions in the Torah, if a person is told: Transgress this prohibition and you will not be killed, he may transgress that prohibition and not be killed, because the preserving of his own life overrides all of the Torah’s prohibitions. This is the halakha concerning all prohibitions <strong>except for those of idol worship, forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed.</strong> Concerning those prohibitions, one must allow himself to be killed rather than transgress them.</p>\n<p>By the way, This Gemara from about this point (maybe some before too,) to the end of the chapter with Rashi and Tosfos is one of the most fundamental pieces of Judaism in the Talmud. Enjoy learning it. :)</p>\n\n\n",

(I've also heard 2 things - 1 bein adom lamokom and 1 bein adom lachaveiro.)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we're supposed to have everything sorted so we've stopped all our aveiros and are keeping all mitzvos before we die, otherwise we'll just get sent back again.

Every year I feel more anxious at this time of year to the point where the last few years I've been feeling physically ill from anxiety (not from fasting) on YK. (I do suffer from anxiety anyway)</p>\n<p>There are plenty of shiurim and sefarim that talk about the seriousness of Elul/RH/YK and how much we need to daven and work on ourselves.

His response is that G-d expects every person to achieve the growth possible to them each year, so that they reach their potential over time.

This is where having a Rebbe or Rav is invaluable. One must do the introspection, but it is also crucial to get personalized advice from a wiser mentor.</p>\n<p>One thing I would recommend is to look for areas to improve upon [for example: dedicate more time to learning; improve your concentration during tefillah; work on a specific character trait, etc.] and set as your goal to work on a specific area and monitor your progress. Make whatever specific kabbalos you choose be part of working on that area. Have in mind that you may have to be flexible on the specifics, but you will keep improving in that area. If you decide there is a better way to go about your goal, that's ok and probably natural. If you feel that your original kabbalah was too big or too small, adjust accordingly.

He talks about the obligation to do it before Yom Kippur, and how we are judged on Rosh Hashana.<br />\nMuch later, starting in perek 5, the Rambam begins to speak at length about free will, our ability to change anything at all about ourselves, and finally - in perek 7 - our obligation to do teshuvah even on bad midos.<br />\nI think people mix these up. That second one is a long process (see his Hilchos Deios), perhaps a lifetime process, the process of becoming better and better. No one expects you to finish it before Yom Kippur.<br />\nRemember how the Rambam began: \"If a person transgresses any of the mitzvot of the Torah, whether a positive command or a negative command...\" That is what we are required to do each year, as soon as possible really. We are supposed to <em>notice</em> when we mess up badly, catch ourselves, and make sure it doesn't happen again.<br />\nWe should not forget to do this, not let it get swamped by the overwhelming idea of fixing every single thing about ourselves that we should improve.<br />\nYou mentioned, \"take on a single small thing to improve on\". That's for the second process, for building yourself up gradually. If someone had a serious collapse we don't tell them that. We tell them, Get up right away, get the help you need. You don't want to stay where you fell. Let's find ways to protect you from its happening again.<br />\nHow often have you heard drashos that take for granted that right after Neilah, most people are going to go back to where they started? It's not supposed to be that way. We are supposed <em>make sure that we are shomrei Torah and mitzvos</em>, make sure that when we did mess up, we fix it and find ways to make it stay fixed. That's possible, because we aren't talking about an ingrained habit of our character, we're talking about something done wrong, carelessly, once. Or twice, ח\"ו, but then it gets harder, so don't wait!<br />\nOr drashos about how very hard is it to have charatah today? Well, of course it's hard, if you're talking about bad midos that you haven't fixed yet and will need to continue working on for years. But charatah for something you are shocked that you ever did, that you never imagined you could have done? That charatah is natural.<br />\nI feel that this could make a big difference to people. If they do this, even if they have a million other things to fix, they are true בעלי תשובה and שומרי מצות. And they have fulfilled the mitzvah of teshuvah.<br />\n-Update: I was reading <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.13?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos</a>, \"נדרים סייג לפרישות\" - oaths are a [helpful] fence for building self-control. One way to understand this, maybe, is that nedarim are a tool to convert some part of the \"working on oneself\" process, which is fuzzy and slow, into issur v'heter, which is more clear and sharp-edged.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What are we supposed to achieve during our lifetime?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I originally asked this- <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/130991/feeling-overwhelmed-with-too-much-teshuva-to-do/\">Feeling overwhelmed with too much teshuva to do</a> and I've realised that there is a more basic question that I should have asked.</p>\n<p>What are we supposed to achieve during our lives?  Have we failed if we're not keeping every halacha and we've not done teshuva for every aveira?  That's the terms that I'm thinking of it in, and there are plenty of stories of people apparently being reincarnated to fix things that their neshamah didn't do or did wrong in a previous life.</p>\n<p>Maybe that's not a problem though - maybe we're not supposed to do everything in 1 life and maybe we're supposed to need a few to get it all done?  Still, I can't imagine that many people ever finish their lives without having added some more mess to fix for the next time around.  Surely we can't all be doomed to keep going round and round fixing the previous lives' problems and adding more?</p>\n<p>I feel like in Elul/RH/YK, it isn't enough to just think about the teshuva that is in front of me - I need to know what I should be aiming for long term (assuming I have a longer term than that - who knows!)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, in his work <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesilat_Yesharim.1.26?ven=Path_of_the_Just._Trans._Rabbi_Yosef_Sebag&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mesilat Yesharim (1:26)</a> the primary purpose of man is to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>fulfill the commandments, serve [G-d] and stand up to trials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In 1952, people asked the Lubavitcher Rebbe \"What is the purpose (תכלית) of life?\". The Rebbe <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/664336/jewish/What-is-the-Purpose-of-Life.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">answered</a> them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To bring light (ליכטיקייט) into the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, the Rebbe states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When one has ליכטיקייט then he will have found the תכלית. A person cannot feel that which he lacks. One looks for what he does not possess. If he had what he was lacking for he would not search.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/letters/default_cdo/aid/2456771/jewish/What-Is-My-Lifes-Purpose.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">20 Adar 1, in the year 5711 (26th February 1951)</a>, the Rebbe writes in one of his many letters to a person, what exactly is our purpose in life. The first lines are the most important to this specific question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The life’s purpose of every Jew, man or woman, has been clearly defined as far back as the Revelation at Mount Sinai more than 32 and a half centuries ago, when we received the Divine Torah and became a nation. We were than ordained as “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” This means that every one of us must be holy in our private life, and in our association with the outside world every one of us, man or woman, must fulfill priestly functions. The priest’s function is to “bring” G‑d to the people, and to elevate the people to be nearer to G‑d. Similarly, every Jew and Jewess fulfills their personal and “priestly” duties by living a life according to the Torah.</p>\n<p>The extent of one’s duty is in direct proportion to one’s station in\nlife. It is all the greater in the case of an individual who occupies\na position of some prominence, which gives him, or her, an opportunity\nto exercise influence over others, especially over youths. Such\npersons must fully appreciate the privilege and responsibility which\nDivine Providence vested in them to spread the light of the Torah and\nto fight darkness wherever and in whatever form it may rear its head.</p>\n<p>This is your duty and privilege as one of the student officers in\nrelation to your coreligionist colleagues and student body in general.\nI would also like to convey this message to your colleagues in the\nJCF. You are all no doubt aware of this, but perhaps there is room for\nadded emphasis and the conviction that “it cannot be otherwise.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also: Likkutei Sichos, Volume 15, Bereishis, Sicha 3 (a text-based translation and study can be found <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/4729012/jewish/Bereishis-Giving-a-Name-Defining-a-Purpose.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>But, back to your question: what are we supposed to achieve in our lifes? The Rebbe explains that we are supposed to be \"priests\". <em>\"We must fulfill priestly functions. The priest’s function is to “bring” G‑d to the people, and to elevate the people to be nearer to G‑d. Similarly, every Jew and Jewess fulfills their personal and “priestly” duties by living a life according to the Torah.\"</em>. That is our purpose in life, and that we are supposed to achieve. Also to be a light unto the nations and spreading G-ds holy word, His Torah.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On a side note, please read the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Baal_HaSulam%27s_Introduction_to_Zohar.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction to the Zohar by the Baal HaSulam</a>, who writes that we need to transform things in life to the  \"holy side\":</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And through Torah and Mitzvot the person transforms his desire to receive into a desire to give, and becomes a \"receiver in order to give\". That person can now receive all the goodness from G-d, and at the same time have a strong connection with Him, because through Torah and Mitzvot he has acquired similarity of form to his Creator. This stage is called \" the last state of tikun\", or \" the thought of creation\". Now there is no longer a need for the impure \"other side\". When this occurs, \"death will be no more\". Being diligent in Torah and Mitzvot during these \"6000 years\" and in a person's lifetime, is for them to attain this final stage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>We have been brought into this world to praise G-d and make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>As it says in Pirkei Avot 2:16</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is not incumbent upon you to complete the work, yet you are not free to desist from it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, try your best, put in effort to be a good person and  study Torah, but don't beat yourself up. Each of us are born into different circumstances with unique traits, and keeping Jewish laws is a life-long journey that evolves over time.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that during the month of Elul it is much easier to access G-d (the King is in the field, is a common term). When focusing on teshuva, it is important to incorporate love and acceptance of the past along with self-improvement.</p>\n\n\n",

They explain how to fit the situation into the words they say, and the Ramban adds:</p>\n<p><strong>וגזירת הכתוב שכל חולצת תקרא מאן יבמי ושיקרא הוא לא חפצתי לקחתה</strong></p>\n<p>I assume the same is true for the parts at the end, which seem to criticize the yavam, \"<em>Thus</em> shall be done to the man who refuses to build his brother's house...\"</p>\n<p>I vaguely recall that there was some Rishon who questioned this, but I can't find it. Does someone know such a source?</p>\n<p>Addendum: The language of the Teshuvas HaRosh there leans heavily on the fact that he holds that all these cases are really עולה ליבום מה\"ת. I'm wondering if even he would say it would be different according to the hava amina on daf chaf, where either because of a posuk יבמתו or because אין עשה דוחה ל\"ת ועשה, there are cases where there is no yibum from the Torah, just chalitzah. And some poskim hold that way even in the maskanah, or for some other cases like sotah and machzir gerushas, see the Rashba there from the BeHag. Once the Torah divides into two cases, perhaps it would be easier to say that those parts of the procedure are for the stam case where they could have done yibum?</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is it achievable to keep all of Halacha?",
    "content": "# Is it achievable to keep all of Halacha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a principle that the Torah doesn't ask us to do anything that is unreasonable/unachievable (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/48788/27180\">here</a>). Surely that means that we don't have any excuse to say \"this is too much for me\".  If something is Halacha (EDIT: and it is applicable to me now), it should be achievable and therefore we should be following it now.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we're told to only try to take on small incremental improvements when trying to do teshuva.  I know that there are plenty of sources for this approach.</p>\n<p>How do we reconcile these two seemingly conflicting ideas?</p>\n<p>Even if you say that it is all achievable, but not immediately, how many people will achieve it all during their lifetime, or even in any number of lifetimes?  I think it is the gemara that says that only 4 people didn't sin during their lives, so how do we understand the idea that it is all achievable for everyone?</p>\n<p>Surely we can't say that it means that any single halacha is achievable, but we can't keep all of it because it is too much all together?</p>\n<p>(This is closely related to 2 recent questions that I've asked, so sorry if it seems repetitive and thank you to those who have answered on those.  I think it is different enough though that it is worth asking though.)</p>\n<p>BEGIN EDITs: I'm only referring to mitzvos which are actually possible for us to keep.  Obviously those which aren't don't apply</p>\n<p>If we aren't expected to keep all of halacha that applies to us, what does it actually mean that it is halacha?  What are the parameters for what we are expected to keep and what we aren't?  Are we saying that the goal is to optimise our adherence to halacha, but not expect to actually ever make it all of the way there?  Does that mean that if we sincerely make a real effort, anything that we do wrong is not counted as a real aveirah when it comes to judgement because it is beyond our capability to overcome?</p>\n<p>Sorry, I don't have sources - I'm terrible at remembering them, but these are things that I have heard repeatedly in the past.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>I once heard an amazing, simple, vort from a rebbi of mine. He used to say it each year around this time.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.20b.9?with=Commentary&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avoda Zara 20B</a> says the following;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ת\"ר (דברים כג, י) ונשמרת מכל דבר רע שלא יהרהר אדם ביום ויבוא לידי טומאה בלילה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara cites another source that interprets the verse cited above. The Sages taught a baraita explaining the verse: “And you shall keep yourself from every evil thing” (Deuteronomy 23:10), which is immediately followed by the verse: “If there be among you any man who is not ritually pure by reason of that which happened to him by night” (Deuteronomy 23:11). This teaches that a person should not think impure thoughts by day and thereby come to the impurity of an emission by night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Avodah_Zarah.20b.9.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosfos</a> in this Gemara explains that this a real bonafide mitzvah, not an asmachta. He then asks, if so, every Jew is commanded to follow this, why was it so special that Yechezkel hanavi achieved it? He answers that although we are all commanded to follow it, hardly anyone actually gets there.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שלא יהרהר אדם ביום - האי קרא דרשה גמורה היא ולא אסמכתא כדמוכח פרק נערה שנתפתתה (כתובות דף מו.) והקשה ה\"ר אלחנן א\"כ מאי רבותיה דיחזקאל דאמרינן פרק שני דחולין (דף לז:) ונפשי לא מטומאה שלא הרהרתי ביום ובאתי לידי טומאה בלילה ואור\"י דמכל מקום רבותא היא ממה שהיה מציל עצמו מהרהור מה שאין כן בשאר אדם דאינו ניצול מהם בכל יום כדאמרי' בבבא בתרא פרק גט פשוט (בבא בתרא דף קסד:) שלשה דברים שאין אדם ניצול מהם בכל יום וקא חשיב הרהור</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My rebbi proved from this Tosfos that there are halachos, even doraisa, that the vast majority of Jews can’t keep in their entirety. Yet the Torah still wrote it! Obviously, our job is to continually strive to perfection even if it’s hardly attainable.</p>\n<p>With this it’s easily understood the rest of that Gemara that exhorts us to strive for the highest levels (and is the basis of the sefer Mesilas Yesharim) because although most will never reach there, we are still obligated (midoraisa) to give it our best shot (and then some)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מכאן א\"ר פנחס בן יאיר תורה מביאה לידי זהירות זהירות מביאה לידי זריזות זריזות מביאה לידי נקיות נקיות מביאה לידי פרישות פרישות מביאה לידי טהרה טהרה מביאה לידי חסידות חסידות מביאה לידי ענוה ענוה מביאה לידי יראת חטא יראת חטא מביאה לידי קדושה קדושה מביאה לידי רוח הקודש רוח הקודש מביאה לידי תחיית המתים וחסידות גדולה מכולן שנאמר (תהלים פט, כ) אז דברת בחזון לחסידיך</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From here Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir would say: Torah study leads to care in the performance of mitzvot. Care in the performance of mitzvot leads to diligence in their observance. Diligence leads to cleanliness of the soul. Cleanliness of the soul leads to abstention from all evil. Abstention from evil leads to purity and the elimination of all base desires. Purity leads to piety. Piety leads to humility. Humility leads to fear of sin. Fear of sin leads to holiness. Holiness leads to the Divine Spirit. The Divine Spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead. And piety is greater than all of them, as it is stated: “Then You did speak in a vision to Your pious ones” (Psalms 89:20).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.55b.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 55b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.17a.6?\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 17a</a>) names four people who didn't sin, and only died because the original snake got Chava and Adam to choose mortality. Meaning, they must have performed every obligation that came their way as well as avoiding every prohibition.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן אַרְבָּעָה מֵתוּ בְּעֶטְיוֹ שֶׁל נָחָשׁ וְאֵלּוּ הֵן בִּנְיָמִין בֶּן יַעֲקֹב וְעַמְרָם אֲבִי מֹשֶׁה וְיִשַׁי אֲבִי דָּוִד וְכִלְאָב בֶּן דָּוִד\nThe Sages taught [in a beraisa]: There were four people who died [only] because of the advice of the snake. And they are: Binyamin, son of Jacob; Amram, father of Moshe; Yishai, father of David; and Khileav, son of David.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Commentaries discuss whether this list is exhaustive, four people in all of history, or if the intent is that of all the people in Tanakh, only these four. It seems clear that the overwhelming majority of people don't perfectly keep all of halakhah. Including Avraham, Yitzchaq, Yaaqov, Sarah, Rivqa, Moshe, Aharon, Miryam, David... All of the major figures in history became who they were despite their less-than-perfect observance.</p>\n<p>For that matter, the gemara appears to emphasize the point by naming each of the four in terms of how they relate to someone else. The gemara's target audience knows who Binyamin, Amram, Yishai and Khiliav were. (Even if I personally didn't recognize that last one.) But Amram isn't just Amram, he is \"Amram, Moshe's father\". And \"Yishai, David's father\". (The use of \"ben\" is less startling, but still in these cases, redundant. There is only one default \"Binyamin\" and only one \"Khiliav\" in Tanakh.)</p>\n<p>One can only conclude (as other answers said), our job isn't perfect observance.</p>\n<p>To give you an idea just how out of reach that is, there is this mitzvah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.133b.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 133b</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַבָּא שָׁאוּל אוֹמֵר: ״וְאַנְוֵהוּ״ — הֱוֵי דּוֹמֶה לוֹ, מָה הוּא חַנּוּן וְרַחוּם — אַף אַתָּה הֱיֵה חַנּוּן וְרַחוּם.\nAba Shaul would say: \"<em>Ve'anveihu</em>\" [\"and I will glorify him\", to be reread \"<em>ve'ani-veHu</em> -- and I and He\"] -- become like Him. Just as He is Gracious and Compassionate, so too you should be Gracious and Compassionate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think we can agree at the outset that no human is ever going to perfectly emulate the Divine. We're limited; Hashem isn't.</p>\n<p>So what does this <em>mitzvah</em> mean? And how did (e.g.) the Avos or Moshe did succeed in ways their perfectly observant family members did not?</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Kotzker Rebbe once asked his students: There are two people on a ladder, one on the fourth rung, and another on the 10th, which one is higher?\nThe book where I saw this thought doesn’t record his students’ answers. I assume some recognized it as a trick question, and answered that it was the one on the fourth, some answered the 10th figuring the rebbe was leading them somewhere, and others were silent. But the rebbe’s answer was succinct, “It depends who is climbing the ladder, and who is going down.”</p>\n<p>Once I told the story, the idea was likely familiar. The idea of spirituality is not where you are, as that is largely a function of forces beyond your control (your upbringing, your genetics, etc…) Rather, it’s the direction you’re heading in, and how rapidly you’re getting there. To apply a notion from Kierkegaard, it’s not about <strong>being</strong> a good Jew, it’s about <strong>the process of becoming</strong> one. The journey, not the destination, is what matters.</p>\n<p>This should be clear when we look at the mitzvah of emulating G-d. We are never going to get to the end state, behaving exactly like Hashem. No matter how far we go, we're still only an infinitesimal fraction of the way there. Our job is to keep on working to get there. The one way in which we can be like Hashem is by not being what we were made to be, but to keep on becoming what we choose. The most transcendent thing about humanity is our very ability to transcend.</p>\n<p>Holiness is measured by our engagement in <strong>becoming</strong>, so why do we think of <em>teshuvah</em>, repentance, in terms of who to <strong>be</strong> by Yom Kippur? My dream that this would be “The Year” I finally get in gear was my deciding to <strong>be</strong> someone new. <em>Teshuvah</em> as motion, getting from point A to the desired point B. Fighting motion is always inertia, and this dream was really my expecting to shift that on the proverbial dime. Expecting sudden relocation to get to that point B is as unreliable as setting oneself a destination without planning the journey.</p>\n<p>A different metaphor: <em>teshuvah</em> as acceleration – changing the direction and speed we’re taking in our lives, changing the course of life’s journey to aim for that “point B”, rather than simply expecting to leap there. Not “getting there” by Yom Kippur, but turning to head toward the right direction, and taking more effort to pick up speed.</p>\n<p>Wow, that ended up longer than I thought it would be! I hope, though, it helped dispel some of the feeling of being overwhelmed, keeps away despair, and gives you ideas planning a next step.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/131073/1570\">my answer to \"Being punished for things beyond bechira point\"</a>, which involves the need to gradually move what Rav Dessler calls the <em>nequdas habekhirah</em>, the \"decision point\". The place where the desire to do the right thing and the wrong one battle, and the decision gets conscious attention and therefore fully subject to free will.</p>\n<p>With each good decision, we habituate ourselves with doing the right thing. We move our \"comfort zone\". And thus move the <em>nequdas habechirah</em>. And since we are primarily judged for the decisions we make of our own free will, the result is that judgement revolves on which direction that point is moving, not on where it is.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here are some sources that it is natural for a Jew to keep all the mitzvot:</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 30:14</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּֽי־קָר֥וֹב אֵלֶ֛יךָ הַדָּבָ֖ר מְאֹ֑ד בְּפִ֥יךָ וּבִֽלְבָבְךָ֖\nלַעֲשֹׂתֽוֹ׃        \nKnow, the thing is very close to you, in your mouth\nand in your heart, to observe it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Alexander would pray (Berachot 17a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Master of the Universe, it is revealed and known before You that our\nwill is to perform Your will, and what prevents us? On the one hand,\nthe yeast in the dough and the subjugation to the kingdoms on the\nother.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Succah 52a</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda taught: In the future,God will bring the evil inclination\nand slaughter it in the presence of the righteous and in the presence\nof the wicked. For the righteous the evil inclination appears to them\nas a high mountain, and for the wicked it appears to them as a mere\nstrand of hair. These weep and those weep. The righteous weep and say:\nHow were we able to overcome so high a mountain? And the wicked weep\nand say: How were we unable to overcome this strand of hair?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it seems that it is fully expected that we should find keeping the mitzvot natural, like breathing. However, the situation on the ground seems different, and the above sources indicate that the yeitzer hara, the שְׂאוֹר שֶׁבָּעִיסָּה, is the problem. The above sources paint a picture that this problem is something that is actually paper thin. A little bit of clarity and knowledge can dispel it. If Hashem were not hidden, for example, we wouldn't be able to sin. This indeed will be the case when the Moshiach comes.</p>\n<p>Why aren't we privileged to that knowledge? Why are so many people born to assumptions and darkness, a ruach shtus that causes them to sin (Sotah 3a), and find it very hard to keep the mitzvot properly? How is it possible that one day Hashem will say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I testify that they [the Jewish people] fulfilled the Torah in its\nentirety. [The nations] say before Him: Master of the Universe, is\nthere a father who can testify about his son? As it is written:\n“Israel is My son, My firstborn” (Exodus 4:22). The Holy One, Blessed\nbe He, said to them: Heaven and earth will testify about them that\nthey fulfilled the Torah in its entirety.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, there are many answers but we turn to Tanya (this the central theme of Likutei Amarim, specific chapters to start would be 1, 11, 14) to make it crystal clear, which is we are born into these situations, the situation of being a rasha, a benoni or a tzaddik as part of His Plan. There is a plan for all this. The truth is that it <em>is</em> very natural for us to keep all the mitzvot, but there is some value in \"Yerida L'tzorech Aliyah\", going down and doing teshuva, in order to reach a new closeness with Hashem that wasn't possible before-hand. This is the chassidic explanation of the kabbalistic idea of \"rescuing sparks\".</p>\n<p>Hashem only knows if you \"should have known better\". Try your best, but realise that many poskim have declared that we are tinokei shenishba (see The Tinok Shenishbah written by Rabbi Chaim Rapoport for the London Beth Din in 5757). Hashem is a righteous judge, carries our sins (accepts that He put you in a difficult situation, to fulfil His plan, and is grateful and we offer a korban on His behalf for doing this - see Bereshit Rabba 1:14, Zohar beginning of Parashat Vayigash, V'Habriach Hatichon 5658, Chayav Inish 5718), considers us all Tzaddikim, and one day will reveal how every Jew never deviated from Hashem's Ratzon even for a second!</p>\n<p>The Ishbitzer says (Mei Hashiloach - Yitro):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Emor l'nafshi yeshuaseich ani\" - The term 'amira' connotes whispering.\nHashem whispers in the ear of the penitent sinner, 'I am your\nsalvation. For even though you have transgressed the words of the\nTorah, there is nothing that stands in the way of <em>teshuva</em>'. Later\non, Hashem will illuminate for this individual that, in fact, he did\nnot cross the boundary of His Desire at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The conclusion of being told that we can do it, but also being told that Hashem is going to put us in situations that we will end up sinning is this: don't be disheartened! You are in a foreign, dark land, subjugated by powerful nations, far from home. There is a reason and a purpose for this, and you are a faithful servant. If you only knew who you were, you'd know how natural it is to be humble, to always judge favorably, to love and fear Hashem, to love mitzvot and keep all of the amazing mitzvot that feel are way greater than you. Keep going and hope for His salvation every day when we will all say \"thank you Hashem for having rebuked us\" (based on Isaiah 12:1) and we will receive the clarity we need to match our faith that there is an incredible purpose to the galus. Emet.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, remember, Hashem is \"marbeh lisloach\" (Amida), and while we continue to struggle, and to sin, He will always forgive us, and He has shown us how to attain that forgiveness.</p>\n<p>Shana tova</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How did the Jews in Egypt have children if they couldn't go to the mikveh after giving birth?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This question is based on a few assumptions, which are based on a couple of Midrashim.</p>\n<p>First of all, <em>Shemos Rabbah</em> 9:10 and <em>Tanna D'Vei Eliyahu</em> Chapter 7 say that the Egyptians were punished with the plague of blood because they prevented the Jews from going to the <em>mikveh</em> (<em>Yefeh Toar</em> and <em>Maharzu</em> say they must have kept the tradition of <em>taharas hamishpacha</em> from their ancestors). At the same time, <em>Midrash Tanchuma</em> Metzora § 9 says that the Jewish women, due to the dread placed upon them by the Egyptians, stopped getting their monthly cycles. I would add that there must have been a miracle that they were able to conceive in such large quantities, despite not getting their cycles.</p>\n<p>I would say that there's no contradiction here, as the Egyptians were punished for their nefarious intentions, even though in the end no harm was done (no Jewess even needed the <em>mikveh</em>). However, <em>Anaf Yosef</em> ad. loc., quoting <em>Gevul Binyamin</em>, sees a contradiction, and therefore says that even though the Jews' monthly cycles stopped, they still needed the <em>mikveh</em> after giving birth.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>במצרים לא היו רואות דם.</strong> והא דאיתא לעיל למה הביא עליהם דם לפי שלא היו מניחין בנות ישראל לבטול מטומאתן הרי שהיו רואין דם ונראה והנה כבר כתיב אשה כי תזריע וכו' ואפילו נפתח הקבר בלא דם אמו טמאה לידה וישראל היו פרים ורבים מאד לכן היו צריכות טהרה במקוה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since this is all assuming the Jews kept <em>halacha</em>, and we see that the Jews had an unusually large population explosion, how can this be reconciled? Once they gave birth, seemingly they couldn't continue having children with their husbands, as the <em>mikvehs</em> were closed. This <em>Gevul Binyamin</em> created a new problem instead of just answering one (which I anyways feel wasn't a problem). He does give a different answer, but I'm curious according to this one.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Perhaps the Egyptians closed the Mikvaos but they didn't close the Nile River.</p>\n<p>There is a machlokes between Rav and Shmuel in <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=65b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 65b</a> whether rivers are permissible as mikvaos. Rav holds the majority of water in a river (unless you know otherwise) is presumed to be rainwater. Because they water is moving (zochlin) it is therefore posul as a mikvah.  Shmuel (in one version) holds that the majority of river water is assumed to be from underground acquifiers and therefore has the status of a mayan (a spring) and it permissible as a mikvah even though the water is moving.</p>\n<p>Although we are machmir for Rav as a l'chatchila, in places without a proper mikvah, the <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5565\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rama</a> brings down that the minhag was to be meikel like Shmuel. יש על מי שיסמוכו.</p>\n<p>So although the Egyptians shut down the mikvaos, the Jewish women would bathe in the Nile (or its tributaries) as a mikvah in order to be mutar to their husbands. The Egyptians thought that they were stopping Jewish families or causing sin but the nashim tzidkoniyos found a way to build the Klal Yisrael anyway.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>For each midrashic author, you need to explore his world and see the underlying assumptions. When the author of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.9.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot Rabba</a> wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מִפְּנֵי מָה הֵבִיא הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא עֲלֵיהֶן דָּם, מִדָּה כְּנֶגֶד מִדָּה. שֶׁכָּךְ אָמַר לְאַבְרָהָם (בראשית טו, יד): וְגַם אֶת הַגּוֹי אֲשֶׁר יַעֲבֹדוּ דָּן אָנֹכִי וגו'. לְפִי שֶׁלֹא הָיוּ מַנִּיחִין בְּנוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל לִטְבֹּל מִטֻּמְאָתָן, כְּדֵי שֶׁלֹא יִהְיוּ פָּרִין וְרָבִין, לְפִיכָךְ לָקוּ הַמַּיִם בְּדָם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, \"because they did not allow the daughters of Israel to immerse from their niddah impurities, so that they (the Jewesses) would not be fruitful and multiply\", it does not specify just how they so prevented them.

Initially, he decreed and commanded the taskmasters to pressure them so that they would produce their quota and they would not sleep at home. He thought to diminish their procreation. He said: If they do not sleep at home they will not have children. The taskmasters said to them: ‘If you go to sleep in your homes, by the time we send to gather you in the morning, an hour or two of the day will have passed, and you will not meet your quota,’ as it is stated: “The taskmasters pressured them saying, [fulfill your work, your daily task]” (Exodus 5:13).\nThey would sleep on the ground. God said to them [the Egyptians]: ‘I said to their forefather Abraham that I will multiply his descendants like the stars, as it is stated: “For I will bless you, and I will multiply, etc.” (Genesis 22:17), and you are outsmarting them so they will not multiply? We will see whose matter prevails, Mine or yours.’ Immediately, “but the more they would afflict them, the more they would increase…” (Exodus 1:12).\nRabbi Akiva expounded: On account of the righteous women who were in that generation, Israel was redeemed from Egypt. What did they do? When they would go to draw water, the Holy One blessed be He would arrange for them small fish in their jugs, and they would draw half water and half fish. They would take it to their husbands and would place two pots on the fire [veshoftot], one with hot water and one with fish. They would feed them, bathe them, anoint them with oil, and give them to drink, and they would consort with them between the pots [shefatayim], as it is stated: “Now you may lie within the sheepfolds [shefatayim], wings of the dove covered with silver” (Psalms 68:14). In reward for having lain between the pots, Israel merited the loot of Egypt, as it is stated: “wings of the dove covered with silver.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of this was before they moved to the next level, the killing of the male infants.</p>\n<p>Thus, the midrashic author assumes that the Egyptians are taking steps to prevent them from immersing, but the Israelite women took steps to circumvent those restrictions. Thus, if the Egyptians closed bathhouses, it stands to reason that they might have immersed in the Nile itself, from where they drew fish. It doesn't explicitly specify this, but I don't think it needs to specify this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Amazing question. The simple answer is that before Mattan Torah and particularly in Chutz Laaretz, Klal Yisroel kept the Torah as a Rishus and not a Chiyuv. The Ramban says this explicitly regarding Yaakov marrying sisters that the Torah was not binding in Chutz Laaretz (hence Rachel had to die prior to entering EY). As such, although the Jewish women would have liked to be keep Taharas Mishpacha, they would not be forbidden to their husband's if they were prevented.</p>\n\n\n",

It shall be a sacred occasion for you: you shall practice self-denial, and you shall bring an offering by fire to יהוה; you shall do no work throughout that day. For it is a Day of Atonement, on which expiation is made on your behalf before your God יהוה.

G-d answers with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, I will not do that</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/127824/27180\">Bereishis 15:9</a>, G-d instructs Avraham to bring five different animals for sacrifice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old she-goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young bird.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the Gemara, citing this pasuk in the Torah, explains that G-d suggested to Abraham that even if his descendants will sin, they will be able to achieve atonement through sacrificing offerings.</p>\n<p>However, what to do when there is no Holy Temple standing in Yerushalayim? That is the question Avraham asks G-d. The Gemara explains as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abraham said before Him: Master of the Universe, this works out well when the Temple is standing and offerings can be brought to achieve atonement, but when the Temple will no longer be standing, what will become of them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, what to do when there is no Holy Temple standing in Yerushalayim?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>G-d said to him: I have already established for them the order of offerings, i.e., <strong>the verses of the Torah pertaining to the halakhot of the offerings</strong>. <strong>Whenever they read those portions, I will deem it as if they sacrificed an offering before Me, and I will pardon them for all of their iniquities.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, the Gemara in for example two places discusses the relationship between Torah study and atonement for sins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone who engages in Torah study need not bring a burnt offering, nor a sin offering, nor a meal offering, nor a guilt offering (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.31b.4?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachos 110a</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>The Gemara ([Rosh Hashanah 18a][4]) explains the pasuk in [1 Shmuel 3:14][5] where it says \"Assuredly, I swear concerning the house of Eli that the iniquity of the house of Eli will never be expiated by sacrifice or offering means that through Torah study and acts of kindness, \"the sin of Eli's house\" is atoned.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abaye said: With sacrifice or offering the sin of Eli’s house is not atoned, but it is atoned through Torah study and the performance of acts of kindness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to all the above. The Gemara explains that through Torah study, especially the sections that are speaking about the offerings, are an atonement for sins. However, Teshuva (repentance) can alse be seen as something that brings atonement for someone.</p>\n<p>Similary, [Hosea][6] says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For I desire goodness, not sacrifice; Obedience to G-d, rather than burnt offerings</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this pasuk, the Avot d'Rabbi Natan [explains][7]:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once, Rabban [our rabbi] Yohanan ben Zakkai, left Jerusalem, and Rabbi Yehoshua followed after him. <strong>And he saw the Holy Temple destroyed</strong>. [Rabbi Yehoshua said: Woe to us, for this is destroyed –] <strong>the place where all of Israel’s sins are forgiven</strong>!2 [Rabbi Yohanan] said to him: My son, do not be distressed, <strong>for we have a form of atonement just like it</strong>. <strong>And what is it? Acts of kindness</strong>, as it says (Psalms 89:3), “For I desire kindness, not a well-being offering.” And so we find that Daniel, the precious man, would busy himself with acts of kindness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is a law for all time\nthroughout the ages,</p>\n<p>for you must distinguish between the sacred and the profane, and\nbetween the impure and the pure; and you must teach the Israelites all\nthe laws which יהוה has imparted to them through Moses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Deuteronomy 33:9-10</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‏וּלְלֵוִ֣י אָמַ֔ר תֻּמֶּ֥יךָ וְאוּרֶ֖יךָ לְאִ֣ישׁ חֲסִידֶ֑ךָ\nאֲשֶׁ֤ר נִסִּיתוֹ֙ בְּמַסָּ֔ה תְּרִיבֵ֖הוּ עַל־מֵ֥י מְרִיבָֽה׃</p>\n<p>הָאֹמֵ֞ר לְאָבִ֤יו וּלְאִמּוֹ֙ לֹ֣א רְאִיתִ֔יו וְאֶת־אֶחָיו֙ לֹ֣א\nהִכִּ֔יר וְאֶת־בָּנָ֖ו לֹ֣א יָדָ֑ע כִּ֤י שָֽׁמְרוּ֙ אִמְרָתֶ֔ךָ\nוּבְרִיתְךָ֖ יִנְצֹֽרוּ׃ יוֹר֤וּ מִשְׁפָּטֶ֙יךָ֙ לְיַעֲקֹ֔ב\nוְתוֹרָתְךָ֖ לְיִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל יָשִׂ֤ימוּ קְטוֹרָה֙ בְּאַפֶּ֔ךָ וְכָלִ֖יל\nעַֽל־מִזְבְּחֶֽךָ׃</p>\n<p>‏ And of Levi he said: Let Your Thummim and Urim Be with Your\nfaithful one, Whom You tested at Massah, Challenged at the waters of\nMeribah;</p>\n<p>Who said of his father and mother, “I consider them not.” His brothers\nhe disregarded, Ignored his own children.

The verses you cite refer to the general class of rabbis and educators, who tended to be from Shevet Levi and were therefore supported by the public in the Biblical agricultural system. But they were not necessarily the ones who were the universally recognized sages whose names were recorded for all time, although Kohanim and Levites were overrepresented in that group also.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Reducing aveiros vs increasing mitzvos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is it more important to focus on reducing our aveiros than increasing our mitzvos?  Does that depend on anything?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is the principle that \"doing one mitzvah, leads to performing another mitzvah\" - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 4:2</a>. However, when one sins, the yetzer hara will do anything in his power to lead a person to performing another sin, G-d forbid. See also: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.2?lang=bi&with=Shaarei%20Teshuvah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaarei Teshuva 1:39</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.2?lang=bi&p2=Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Re%27eh%2C_Torah_Ohr.23&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shelah (Torah Shebikhtav, Re'eh, Torah Ohr)</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_Chayim.4.2.1-12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Chaim</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And that which he said, \"since a commandment leads to [another] commandment,\" is meaning to say that the doing of one commandment is also the beginning of another one, since all of the commandments are one thing. Hence one commandment leads to [another] commandment. For anything that is one is not divisible at all. So when he does a commandment - which is half a thing - that commandment leads to another; until he does all of the commandments, which are one thing. And since the whole Torah is one thing, sins - which are the opposite of the commandment - are also one thing. [So] in the same way that a commandment leads to [another] commandment, so too does a sin lead to [another] sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You ask:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it more important to focus on reducing our aveiros than increasing\nour mitzvos?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well, let's look at what the above-mentioned Mishnah is teaching us. If a person does one sin, the \"reward\" of that is another sin, e.g. the yetzer hara tries to convince a person to \"just do another sin, it does not matter\". G-d helps the one who wants to purify himself, but leaves the \"way open\" for one who will defile himself, G-d forbid <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.2?lang=bi&with=Ikar%20Tosafot%20Yom%20Tov&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(see: Ikar Tosafos Yom Tov; and sources cited there)</a>. However, doing a mitzvah, leads to performing another mitzvah, will lead to rewards and the possibilty to purify oneself. When one does a mitzvah, one gets rewarded. What's the reward?

Having fear of God is a positive character trait in Judaism. Is that the same as this scenario though? What I mean is in this scenario could it not be considered the person is \"placing his last bet\" in hopes he still gets counted even after living a non-observant life?</p>\n<p>How does Judaism rationalize this situation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam's laws of Teshuva</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Who has reached] complete Teshuvah? A person who confronts the same situation in which he sinned when he has the potential to commit [the sin again], and, nevertheless, abstains and does not commit it because of his Teshuvah alone and not because of fear or a lack of strength.<br />\nFor example, a person engaged in illicit sexual relations with a woman. Afterwards, they met in privacy, in the same country, while his love for her and physical power still persisted, and nevertheless, he abstained and did not transgress. This is a complete Baal-Teshuvah. This was implied by King Solomon in his statement [Ecclesiastes 12:1] \"Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, [before the bad days come and the years draw near when you will say: `I have no desire for them.'\"]<br />\n<strong>If he does not repent until his old age, at a time when he is incapable of doing what he did before, even though this is not a high level of repentance, he is a Baal-Teshuvah.</strong><br />\nEven if he transgressed throughout his entire life and repented on the day of his death and died in repentance, all his sins are forgiven as [Ecclesiastes, op. cit.:2] continues: \"Before the sun, the light, the moon, or the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain...\" - This refers to the day of death. Thus, we can infer that if one remembers his Creator and repents before he dies, he is forgiven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Yonah of Gerona, Shaarei Teshuvah, Second Gate, XXXIII:</p>\n<p>‘...When one grows old and his evil inclination grows weak, he is not rewarded for repentance as for perfecting his heart in his youth. Our Sages of blessed memory have said, ‘“Happy is the man who feareth the Lord” (Ps. 112:1) - when he is yet a man’ (Avodah Zarah 19a), and they have said that when a thief has nothing to steal he fancies himself upright (Sanhedrin 22a).’</p>\n<p>Also Second Gate, XXXIV:</p>\n<p>‘... During old age, when one’s senses lose their intensity, one cannot summon up enough strength to blaze new trails in his heart and to put forth thoughts with which to war against the evil inclination, to acquire virtues and to toil and to labour in Torah and good deeds, as it is written, ‘Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when you shall say: “I have no pleasure in them” (Koheleth 12:1). A man should therefore be quick in securing shelter for his soul, as David, May peace be upon him, said, “I made haste, and delayed not, to observe Thy commandments” (Ps. 119:60).’</p>\n<p>Hope that helps :)</p>\n<p>P.S.

His nephew Yokim Ish Tzeruros (יקים איש צרורות) was a Jewish renegade who switched to the Greek side, and he went to watch his uncle's impending death. Seeing this as a good opportunity to goad his uncle and prove that he had made the right life decisions, he sneered, \"Look at you now!\". Gazing at his nephew, Yosi ben Yoezer responded swiftly, noting, \"If this is the reward for a רשע (an evil person) (i.e. his nephew was riding on a stallion), how much greater is the reward for a צדיק (a righteous person) in the next world!\". יקים איש צרורות countered, \"Is there a greater tzaddik than you?!\" to which יוסי בן יועזר answered, \"If this is the punishment (i.e. a great torture) for a צדיק, how much greater is the punishment for a רשע!\"</p>\n<p>This exchange had a profound impact on יקים איש צרורות who reasoned that due to his ill behaviour he was guilty of the death penalty according to halacha. He consequently built a contraption that would kill him simultaneously with all four of the death penalty methods.</p>\n<p>This served as such a כפרה (atonement) that a moment before יוסי בן יועזר was killed he saw a vision of his nephew and he related that my nephew entered עולם הבא (the Next World) one moment before me.</p>\n<p>(Sources: See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.65.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 65:22</a> - \"נִתְנַמְנֵם יוֹסֵי בֶּן יוֹעֶזֶר אִישׁ צְרֵידָה וְרָאָה מִטָּתוֹ פָּרְחָה בָּאֲוִיר, אָמַר בְּשָׁעָה קַלָּה קְדָמַנִּי זֶה לְגַן עֵדֶן\".

One is the Tanya, and one is Mesilat Yisharim.</p>\n<p>The former has become the main philosophical treatise of the chassidic movement, and the latter of the litvish movement. The former suggests our job is to struggle in order to make this world a dwelling place for Hashem, Who will come and dwell in it. The latter suggests our job is to ascend and reach perfection. It is not clear if they are different in their end goals, but clearly both philosophies are self-contained philosophies to bringing the Moshiach.</p>\n<p>In the litvish world, it is now accepted that the chassidic movement is not only kosher, but Toras Emes, holy, and you may not speak badly of it or any of the Rebbes. At the same time, there seems to be quite little active learning of chassidic works in litvish yeshivas. You may hear in passing the story of the Besht and the אגרת הגאולה, but it's unlikely you'll view that as a charge to go and learn and teach chassidus.</p>\n<p>The litvish world have their own path to geula, and therefore are focussed on it. As some of the comments to your question indicate, they would feel it's not their job or responsibility to \"help out\" with the chassidic path.</p>\n<p><em>[This is hearsay, I admit, but generally my experience over the last 15 years has been one of the litvish viewing chassidus as an 'alternative', for those with that sort of personality, or born that way. There are other tropes and misconceptions that float around, some of them have a hint of the original points made by the misnagdim (check out the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misnagdim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wikipedia article</a> and see if you agree), although now of course the tone is not one of \"heresy\" but more \"not for us\", hopefully in a way that doesn't close the mind but simply keeps it focussed on the task at hand...]</em></p>\n<p>It seems, from the chassidic side, that the litvish approach is one that is meant to be part 1, and the chassidic approach is more part 2. If you liken Mesilat Yisharim to a \"manual on how to be the perfect wife\", and the Tanya to \"getting to know your Husband\", you wouldn't be too far off. Of course, Tanya and other chassidic teachings also try to incorporate a \"marriage training manual\" approach in their own way, and the litvish certainly have plenty of holy Torah on Yediyat Hashem (and over the 300 years they have had tremendous influence on eachother, both the litvish world has many chassidic ideas in every day life, and visa versa, in no small way thanks to the work of the gedolim on both sides, perhaps starting with R Chaim of Volozhin in Nefesh Hachaim teaching the \"tzimtzum shelo k'peshuto\" ideas), but the chassidim will say that at some point you have to put that book down, stop endlessly \"working on yourself\" (for <em>everyone</em> would admit that it is <strong>endless</strong>) and settle down and get married and get to know your Husband.</p>\n<p>So there's no need for the litvish to learn and spread chassidus as a duty. Whatever chassidic ideas need to be in the \"global consciousness\" in the lead up to Moshiach will happen, and certainly the great work the litvish are doing is essential and part of things too. The Besht's promise that the Moshiach will come when the whole world knows the wellsprings of his teachings is an indication that when the world is more interested in getting to know Hashem than working on themselves, we are indeed ready to welcome Hashem into His Eternal Bayit. For now, we should focus on building more bridges between both worlds, learn from eachother, increase shalom, and keeping our little designated areas of Hashem's world as tidy and welcoming to Him as we can, each in our unique way.</p>\n<p>Hopefully not too heliographic, her is a good video on this topic. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/multimedia/video_cdo/aid/3521399/jewish/Competing-Ideals-of-Ascent-and-Struggle.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/multimedia/video_cdo/aid/3521399/jewish/Competing-Ideals-of-Ascent-and-Struggle.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

I see The King! And the robbers, out of fear run away. We too scream Hamelech from our seats, so that the Soton, that tends to rob us from having proper concentration and devotion in our tefilos on this most crucial and important day, should run away.\nHe also quoted Horav Melech Biderman Shlit’a that everyone experiences the presence of the King of the Universe in his own particular way, understanding and perception, so to say; from his own seat</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The wedding takes place in a conventional event venue (i.e., not a mosque or any other religious building). Can I attend his wedding?</p>\n<p>Most online responsa, including <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/22978/attending-a-relatives-non-jewish-wedding-in-a-non-jewish-place-of-worship\">this one I've seen here</a>, deal primarily with Christian weddings conducted in a church. There are fairly evident halachic issues regarding gatherings of idolaters and entering an idolatrous house of worship. However, those reasons don't apply here. I know that the prevailing view is that Islam is not idolatrous, and one answer to that responsum says that you could attend a Muslim wedding, but does not elaborate. In my mind, this would be even more the case since the venue is not a house of worship, even if it seems like the poskim tend to permit entering a mosque. Would this be the correct view here?</p>\n<p>P.S. I know there are tangential <em>halachic</em> issues. For <em>kashrut</em>, I won't be eating anything, and there's no alcohol served. The couple are fairly devout and I must assume that most of the guests would be expected to conform to Islamic dress customs, so I would think that there wouldn't be very many issues of <em>tzniut</em> here either.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Socializing_with_Non-Jews#cite_note-45\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachapedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yabia Omer Section 10, Yoreh Deah 13, Rav Ovadia argues that since Muslims are not idol worshipers the prohibition of eating and drinking at a non-Jewish wedding does not apply to Muslim weddings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, Shut Chessed L'Avraham 14:26 pg. 127a, Darkei Teshuva 114:1, Ben Yisrael Lenachri pg. 398 disagree.

I know there is the existent question on mixed dancing but it doesn’t address this particular situation.

Afterwards, they met in privacy, in the same country, while his\nlove for her and physical power still persisted, and nevertheless, he\nabstained and did not transgress.

I know he has done full teshuva for the specific aveira that Rambam was referring to, but it seems strange to choose an example where he is still doing another aveira?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I am not quite sure what exactly your question is (might be worth editing your current question). But, the Lechem Mishneh, in the commentary on this halacha writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What is full teshuvah ('repentance')?... This is full teshuvah...\" In Tractate Yoma 86b, they said: What is a ba'al teshuvah (\"one who has repented\") like? Rav Yehudah said: It is like one into whose hands some transgressive matter came one time, but, in the second time, that person was 'saved from it.' Rav Yehudah showed [further what he meant by stating]: With the same woman, at the same time, at the same place. And the reason for this, according to Rashi, in his words: So long as it is all and all similar to the time when the person would have failed and had their [evil] inclination conquer them and say to them, \"Look, it is the same What's-Her-Name and the same place, and it's the same time; get up, and do what you've done before.\" (That's the end of Rashi's comment.\" And our teacher [Maimonides] did not write [specifically] \"one time\" and \"second [time]\", for it was not in his version [of the Babylonian Talmud]; rather: It is like one into whose hands some transgressive matter came, and Rav Yehudah showed an explanation: With the same woman, at the same time, at the same place, etc.. And such is the language of RYF (i.e., Rav Yitzhak Alfasi) in Hilkhot Makkot (\"The Laws of Striking\"). \"And in that time\" means \"with the strength of one's body,\" which is to say, \"in the time of one's youth.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You ask why the Rambam uses illicit sexual relations as a example in this halacha. It might have something to do with the fact that illicit sexual relationsare one of the three cardinal sins, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/130987/27180\">here</a> which the Torah describes as \"a great sin\".</p>\n<p>Furthermore, you state: <em>\"surely he is transgressing hilchos yichud?\"</em></p>\n<p>I do not think this is the primary focus in this halacha. The focus of this halacha is that Rambam explains what complete teshuva is, what is a baal-teshuva? How does a baal-teshuva acts when confronted with the same challenges as before, the challenges that made him do a certain sin. Rambam then goes on to say that a person is a baal-teshuva, aka someone who has done a full teshuva, when:</p>\n<p>the same context in which the sin was done, so \"same place, same \"woman\", same time etc...\" is applicable at another time, but, despite of his urges, the person choses not to \"follow his heart\", and instead, choses the right path to follow. See also the commentary of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.2.1?lang=bi&with=Maaseh%20Rokeach&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maaseh Rokeach</a>.</p>\n<p>When doing teshuva, G-d often places a person in exactly the same situation in which he sinned. This is done by G-d in order to help the person repent, and make sure that the same error is not done again. See: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesilat_Yesharim.1.7-8?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mesilas Yesharim, chapter 1,</a> by R'Chaim Luzatto:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, has put man in a place where the factors which distance him from the blessed G-d are numerous. These are the physical lusts which if he is drawn after them, behold, he draws away and goes ever further from the true good.</p>\n<p>Thus, we see that man is truly placed in the midst of a raging\nbattlefield. For all matters of this world, whether for the good or\nfor the bad, are trials for a man. Poverty from one side versus wealth\nfrom the other. This is as Shlomo said: \"Lest I be satiated, and deny\nYou, and say, Who is G-d? or lest I be poor, and steal...\"\n(Prov.30:9). Tranquility on one hand versus suffering on the other,\nuntil the battle is waged against him from the front and from the\nrear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When G-d places a person in exactly the same situation, in a situation in which the person used to stumble and sin, but this times is strong enough to keep following the right path. Then his teshuva is complete. That is what the Rambam is talking about.</p>\n\n\n",

The Sages prayed and asked for God to have mercy on him, and his learning was restored.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another version appears in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kohelet_Rabbah.7.7.2?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kohelet Rabbah 7:7</a>, where Rabbi Elazar follows his wife to Emmaus. None of his friends come with him and he eventually comes to forget basic laws:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai had five disciples. As long as he was alive, they would sit before him. When he died, they went to Yavne, but Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh went to his wife in Emmaus, a place with good water [/beautiful waters] and a beautiful view. He waited for them to come to him, but they did not come. When they did not come, he sought to go to them, but his wife did not allow him to do so. She said: ‘Who is in need of whom?’ He said to her: ‘They are in need of me.’ She said to him: ‘A leather container [of food] and mice, which typically goes to which; the mice to the container, or the container to the mice?’ He heeded her and remained until he forgot his learning. Sometime later they came to him and asked him: ‘A wheat loaf or a barley loaf, which can be eaten faster with a relish?’ He did not know how to respond to them, or the meaning of “with relish [liftan].” Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yosei say: It is two food items joined [lefutin] together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It should be noted that two other versions of this story appear in Avot D'Rabbi Natan version A and B (see <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38247&st=&pgnum=93&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) but neither specifically say that he forgot his Torah learning. They just say that he did not become great in the field of Torah because he went to Dimsit<sup>2</sup>/Emmaus because of their 'beautiful waters'. It has been suggested by <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/goldin-judah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Judah Goldin</a> in his Hebrew essay \"משהו על בית מדרשו של רבן יוחנן בן זכאי\" (Something About the Study Hall of Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai), The Tzvi Wolfson Jubilee Book, pp. 79-80 that these 'beautiful waters' symbolize study material that wasn't considered entirely acceptable in rabbinic circles, i.e., Hellenistic philosophical studies.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>These stories contain a lot of symbolism and a number of essays have discussed them. One particularly key point is, with regards to your question, that the Torah has also been compared to water (see for example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Kamma.82a.5?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 82a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Taanit.7a.15?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanit 7a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereishit_Rabbah.41.9?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbah 41:9</a>), so it seems that going after other sorts of 'watery' pleasures (whether physical or intellectual) brings about loss of truly important 'water' - Torah.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> There are different views as to which place this name refers to. Sefaria translated it as Phrygia, but there are equally plausible suggestions that it refers to somewhere in the Galilee or in Transjordan.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Though in Shabbat 147b and Avot D'Rabbi Natan version A Deyomset/Dimsit is presented as a place-name, the word literally means 'hot water bath'.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> Goldin also published an English version of this essay: J. Goldin, 'A Philosophical Session in a Tannaite Academy', Traditio 21 (1965), pp. 1-21 (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/27830787#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JSTOR link</a>) but I was not able to find this particular idea mentioned there, though it's possible I missed it. The Hebrew essay is not available online to my knowledge, but I can provide a scan if it interests you.</p>\n\n\n",

What that amount is is a scientific question, but seemingly one with no practical halachic implications, as if anyone can see it it must be visible!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>However, the Brisker Rav, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41469&st=&pgnum=30\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 12:2</a> writes that knowing the time of minimum human visibility does have a practical ramification, in the case where Rosh Chodesh is being calculated. Since:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>technically the moon begins to get bigger one second after the molad/conjunction,</li>\n<li>physical seeing is anyway not being relied upon here,</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One might assume that this knowledge is good enough, and a calculated new month would be able to start any time from the calculated molad. However this is not so, contends the Brisker Rav - even in this case enough time must elapsed for it to be visible to the naked eye, despite not needing any witnesses or testimony.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As such, it is necessary to know the minimum amount of time needed. This is difficult to know, and indeed the Brisker Rav writes that this is what Rashi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 12:2</a> means by:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moshe found it difficult to understand the birth of the new moon, when it is visible and able to be sanctified.

This is also indicated by our calendar (based on the above argument), which allows Rosh Chodesh to fall on the day of the molad provided it is before mid-day.</p>\n<p>The Ba'al Hamaor there says at least 24 hours are required for sighting, and he reinterprets the Gemara and the midday requirement to conform with this.</p>\n<p>From the discussion in the Talmud we see another ramification - if not enough time has elapsed Beis Din would be able to reject the witnesses as liars.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If testimony was not brought on day 30 of the month that the moon was visible, then day 31 is automatically considered the first of the new month. This causes the old month to be 30 days,</p>\n<p>If several months occurred like this, the new moon will eventually show up earlier than day 29. When this happens, bais din will refuse to hear testimony so that the old month will be 29 days. This causes the months of the year to average 29.5 days and the holidays come out properly.</p>\n<p>There are people who go to the hills around Yerushalayim to attempt to see the moon in order to be ready for the coming of the mashiach and the reestablishment of the Sanhedrin.

I am married (and I have children if that makes any difference), and TG that has helped a great deal, and TG, my problems are not as bad as they once were.  I'm familiar with most of the practical advice with dealing with these problems as I've had a good look around at previous questions, so I'm not looking for that.  I'm also not looking for justification, or even to minimise the severity of these sins.  (I'm not trying to make any excuses, but I do think that there are a couple of complicating factors that make it hard for me to completely stop.  I won't deny though that there is a definite element of it being a constant battle trying to overcome my temptation and sometimes I win for a period of time before relapsing - I feel that I am very much the addict who can't ever seem to quite shake it).</p>\n<p>My problem is that I'm familiar with what many of the sources say about spilling seed and how severe it is, and I'm completely wracked with guilt to a degree that I think is very unhealthy, but I feel that if I take these sources at face value (eg. the Talmud, I think in Niddah that compares it to the three Cardinal Sins), then I can't help but feel that level of guilt.  I'm really not sure how to deal with this, and I don't feel that this is something that I can discuss with my Rabbi. I'm not expecting there to be any scope for this being allowed, but the severity that is described seems so harsh and difficult to deal with when it is something that I think many men find very difficult.</p>\n<p>Should all of these sources be taken at face value or is there any scope for it not being taken as literally as that and that it isn't really that severe?

Therefore it is very good that before some [bad] thing starts to be done as a result of it, God forbid, the man should preempt, and immerse and purify himself.\n<br>\nAnd he urged us very much that a man should not fear this at all, for fear, worry and melancholy in this matter are very, very harmful, especially since he has revealed to us the ten chapters of Tehillim/Psalms to remedy this error, namely: 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, 150, as explained in the books which have already been printed [Tikkun Haklali; Likutei Moharan #205 and II:92; Sichot Haran #141]. At that time he said, \"Whoever manages to fulfill this, to say these the ten chapters of Tehillim on the same day he has a mikreh, God forbid, will surely have his error corrected, and should not [think] back and worry about it at all.\" He also made mockery of those chassidim and God-fearing people who, whenever some thought arises in their minds, have fear of having a mikreh, and due to this they are accustomed [to do the prohibited, God forbid] as if it were permitted — and he, of blessed memory, would make mockery of this. And his main intention was: that a man needs to not be scared or fear such things at all, without thinking any thoughts at all regarding this, but only be a valiant soldier standing against his craving and detach his mind from this completely and not be scared at all, and Hashem shall only let what is good in His eyes happen with him, whatever the Blessed One desires.\n<br>\nAnd he hinted with his words that this is the aspect of the blemish of King Dawidh, obm, with Batsheva, etc., but he did not explain the thing thoroughly. But a person very, very much needs to make himself strong in joy continuously, and not be cast down in his mind at all due to any thing in the world, no matter what happens to him. And if he is strong in his mind and does not get frightened at all, and does not contrive thoughts at all (which they call iber trachten/ over-thinking), but goes wholesomely in joy, he will merit to ultimately pass through everything in peace. And these things are impossible to explain in writing, \"but a prudent one will discern the straight way he should go\" [Prov. 14:15].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Free will after Moshiach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Rosh Hashana amida (at least nusach Ashkenaz), there is a tefilla that the whole world should recognise Hashem as King and that all wickedness should evaporate like smoke. I presume that this is referring to the time of Moshiach. I was wondering though, does this mean that there will be no sin anymore at all? I have heard claims that there will be no sin after Moshiach, but I was thinking about this today, and surely that means no more free will if we are unable to sin? Perhaps that is the case, but are we really saying that we won't have free will after Moshiach comes? This seems quite surprising if it is the case?</p>\n<p>EDIT: I find this hard to understand.  Surely the point in serving Hashem, doing mitzvos and avoiding aveiros is that we're choosing to do so and it is the yetzer hara that gives us that choice by giving us a desire to do wrong?  It seems strange that we'd lose the choice to serve Hashem and the reward for doing so? Surely we'd have no personal growth then anymore either?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The prophet Zechariah writes (13:1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And it shall come to pass on that day, says the L-rd of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the <strong>unclean spirit</strong> to pass out of the land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"Unclean spirit\"</strong>- this refers to the evil inclination <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.13.2?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Rashi, on this verse)</a>.</p>\n<p>See also what the Malbim writes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.13.2?lang=bi&with=Malbim%20on%20Zechariah%7CQuoting&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have already explained in my commentary on Ezekiel that this is a metaphoric representation of the spreading forth of the waters of knowledge and the stream of Torah and faith, which are compared to water. After the first war, the waters of knowledge will begin to spread out from the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and remove the sin of external consciousness and to purify the impurity of foolishness, stupidity and false belief and every trace of idolatry as is explained shortly. “It will come to pass on that day that I will cut off all the names of the idols from the land…” (Zechariah 13:2) This is an explanation of the nature of this source and its faithful waters that flow from the upwelling of wisdom and holy consciousness. After the final war of Gog and Magog the waters will spread outwards and “the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” (Isaiah 11:9) On this it says “And on that day living waters will go out from Jerusalem…and the Lord shall be king over all the earth…” (Zechariah 14:8-9) This is the meaning of the ‘water,’ that everyone will recognize the unity of the Creator and the truth of divinity. This itself is the water which Ezekiel saw, as I explained there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.chabadnj.org/page.asp?pageID=%7BC59FCC35-5E70-46D6-A6D5-4FF754AEA78B%7D&displayAll=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this question-answer article, Chabad of New Jersey</a> cites the Rambam, who says, that when Moshiach comes, our sole business will be to \"know G-d\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.12.5?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Mishneh Torah; Laws of Kings and Wars 12:5)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>.And at that time there won't be any famine or war there, and there won't be jealousy or competitions, for good will be flowing freely, and all delights will be as common as dust, and the only business will be to know G-d. Therefore, Israel will be great sages and they will know the hidden things and they will attain knowledge of their creator as much as people can, as it is said, \"For the earth will be filled with knowledge of G-d like water covers the oceans. ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The article then goes on to explain what Rashi meant with the referal to the evil inclination, and that the prophet Zechariah says that \"on that day\", the unclean spirit, e.g. the evil inclination will be removed. It means that our choices will not longer include anything bad:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maimonides writes that when Moshiach comes, our sole occupation will be to know G-d. Since G-d is infinite, we will have unlimited opportunities to expand our understanding of Him. We will have the choice to know G-d through studying holy texts, through delving into the mysteries of creation, or appreciating the beauty around us. We will be able to express our relationship with Him in myriad ways - through art, music, poetry, or through intellectual growth and advancement. As mentioned, our choices will not include anything negative or harmful; yet we will be faced with endless possibilities for personal growth and awareness of the Divine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, yes, we will still have a free choice. However, whatever we chose, it will be good, since there will be no evil inclination anymore. One will serve G-d with music, the other with learning Torah all day.</p>\n<p>For further reading, see <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2312400/jewish/Chapter-11-Mitzvos-After-the-Resurrection.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 11: Mitzvos After the Resurrection</a> by Rabbi Nissan Dovid Dubov.</p>\n\n\n",

Is it not already written (Isaiah 50:1) \"Where is your mother's bill of divorce by which I sent her away, or to which of My creditors have I sold you!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this, I have the following question:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Gemara (Yoma 86b; sefaria-edtion) states: \"it should be prohibited for the Jewish people to return to God from their sins, yet repentance overrides this prohibition\" - What is the foundation of this statement?

Even if we were to take it very seriously in a halachic context, the simplest answer to this question is why do you need to assume this is \"adding\" or \"removing\" from the Torah? If the Torah itself says it, then that's not an addition or a subtraction. It is a clarification of the circumstances of the application of the halacha.</p>\n<p>The Zohar states: ישראל ואורייתא וקודשא בריך הוא חד הוא</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.102b.14?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 102b</a> we have the following (Koren commentary between the lines):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Parenthetical to this discussion, the Gemara relates: A certain\nheretic said to Rabban Gamliel: You, the children of Israel, are a\nnation whose Master removed [ḥalatz] Himself from them, for God has\nleft you in much the same way in which a yavam would perform ḥalitza\nwith his yevama, as it is written: “With their flocks and with their\nherds they shall go to seek the Lord, but they shall not find Him. He\nhas removed [ḥalatz] Himself from them [meihem]” (Hoshea 5:6). The\nheretic tried to use this verse as scriptural support that God has\nperformed ḥalitza with the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>He, Rabban Gamliel, said to him: Imbecile, does it say: He performed\nḥalitza to them [lahem]? Rather, it says “ḥalatz from them [meihem],”\nmeaning it is as if they, the Jewish people, performed ḥalitza on Him.\nBut if a yevama had her shoe removed by her yevamin, does this have\nany significance? Here too, the meaning of the verse is that the\nnation of Israel abandoned God by removing themselves from Him, and\nthis abandonment has no significance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There can be no separation, ultimately, between the Jewish people and Hashem.

This is what David exhorted us saying: \"Serve G-d with joy, come before Him with song\" (Tehilim 100:2), and \"the righteous will rejoice, they will exult before God and delight with joy\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.68.4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 68:4</a>). And our sages said: \"the Divine presence rests on a person only through his rejoicing in a mitzva\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.30b.5?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 30b</a>). On the aforementioned verse: \"Serve G-d with joy\", our sages said in a Midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.100.2?vhe=OYW&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shocher Tov, Tehilim 100</a>): \"Rabbi Abahu says: 'when you stand to pray, your heart should rejoice, for you are praying to the Almighty of whom there is none like Him'\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Aruch_HaRav.1.1.8?vhe=WikiSource&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Shulchan Aruch HaRav 1:1</strong></a> who adds that not only davening but also learning Torah practically is a way to embody this command:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ומכל מקום התורה והתפלה צריך להיות בשמחה, כמו שכתוב: \"עבדו את ה' בשמחה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Devarim.28.47.1?vhe=Midrash_Rabbeinu_Bachya_%5Bben_Asher%5D._Warsaw,_1878&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachya (Devarim 28:47)</a></strong> - You accomplish it when performing the mitzvos of Hashem in a happy manner.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תחת אשר לא עבדת את ה' אלהיך בשמחה. יאשימנו הכתוב בעבדו השי\"ת ולא היתה העבודה בשמחה, לפי שחייב האדם על השמחה בהתעסקו במצות, <strong>והשמחה במעשה המצוה מצוה בפני עצמו, מלבד השכר שיש לו על המצוה יש לו שכר על השמחה</strong>, ועל כן יעניש בכאן למי שעובד עבודת המצוה כשלא עשאה בשמחה, ולכך צריך שיעשה אדם המצות בשמחה</p>\n<p>תחת אשר לא עבדת את ה' אלוקיך בשמחה, “because you did not serve the Lord your G-d joyfully.” The Torah accuses people who do serve G-d not to have done so joyfully. A person is obligated not merely to carry out G-d’s instructions but to do so gladly, in a happy frame of mind. <strong>Joy when performing any of G-d’s commandments is considered as fulfillment of a commandment by itself, meriting additional reward</strong>. This is why one may be punished for failing to perform the commandments with a joyful heart. This is why the Torah requires that its commandments be performed with full intent and joyfully.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pele_Yoetz.198.28?vhe=Torat_Emet&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Pele Yoetz 198:28</strong></a> for a similar approach.</p>\n<p>So we see that these two first methods essentially are spiritually based. If we make efforts to work on our tefillah, talmud torah and kiyum mitzvos (prayer, torah study and fulfilment of the commandments) this is a sure way to embody the concepts of עבדו את ה' בשמחה. I saw on p.104 of Rabbi Twersky's <em>The Enemy Within</em> (Shaar Press: 2002) in his chapter entitled <em>\"Finding Joy in Life\"</em> that the two are inherently linked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch</strong> points out that the Hebrew word <em>same'ach</em> (= happy), is closely related to the word <em>tzome'ach</em> (= growing). This is because human happiness is contingent on spiritual growth. If we fail to feel the joy of mitzvos, it is because we are unaware that mitzvos make us grow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Chasidim.68.1?vhe=Sefer_Chassidim,_Zhitomir,_1857&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Chasidim</a></strong> - One final way to practically achieve this tenet is to use it to frame your life view. The Sefer Chasidim sees it is a balancer, keeping us in check. In other words, you accomplish it by ensuring we have the right outlook on life, synthesising our view on the present together with our view of mortality.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עבדו את ה' בשמחה (תהלים ק ב) וכתיב (תהלים ב יא) עבדו את ה' ביראה הא כיצד אם אדם שמח מאד יזכור לו יום המיתה זהו ביראה ואם הוא עצב ישמח לבו בדברי תורה דכתיב (תהלים יט ט) פקודי ה' ישרים משמחי לב:</p>\n<p>It is written, “Serve the Lord with gladness” (Ps. 100:2)1 and “Serve the Lord with fear” (Ps. 2:11), but how so? 2(both fear and gladness?) If a man is over-joyful, let him recall the day of death,3 this is fear. If he is sad, let him rejoice his heart with matters of the Law,4 as it is written, “The precepts of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart” (Ps. 19:9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Best answer I ever heard from Rabbi Manis Friedman (chassidish answer) is that the charge \"serve Hashem b'simcha\" is not a charge to be happy when serving Hashem. It's a result. If you truly serve Hashem, meaning you are serving Him, you finally get to escape yourself for a while! Serving ourselves, making our lives about us (even if it means \"my spiritual growth\"!) is what makes us depressed. If we realise that we are fulfilling Hashem's essential Ratzon, it's about Him not us, and at the same time doing the vitally important work of bringing His plan to completion, fulfilling your very purpose, then automatically you will be b'simcha.</p>\n<p>So read it \"if you serve Hashem, you'll be b'simcha\"</p>\n<p>He says this in many videos. This is a chassidic answer (but based on rational thinking just like all of Chabad Chassidus), so I assume you aren't going to pursue it, but if you would like a source video I can find one.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It sounds to me like you are seeking a manner with which to intellectually fulfill this dictum... demanding a sustained emotional transformation can seem quite onerous and indeed unnatural for some psychological dispositions. Perhaps you can find some comfort in the Maggid Mishnah's (R. Vidal de Toulouse) commentary on the Rambam.</p>\n<p>To place it context, here is what the Rambam wrote (H. Sukkah 8:15):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שהשמחה שישמח אדם בעשיית המצוות ובאהבת האל שציווה בהן, עבודה גדולה היא;\nוכל המונע עצמו משמחה זו, ראוי להיפרע ממנו, שנאמר \"תחת, אשר לא עבדת את\nה' אלוהיך, בשמחה, ובטוב לבב\" (דברים כח,מז).  וכל המגיס דעתו, וחולק\nכבוד לעצמו, ומתכבד בעיניו במקומות אלו--חוטא, ושוטה.  ועל זה הזהיר\nשלמה, ואמר \"אל תתהדר, לפני מלך\" (משלי כה,ו).</p>\n<p>The happiness with which a person should rejoice in the fulfillment of\nthe miswoth and the love of God who commanded them is a great service.\nWhoever holds himself back from this rejoicing is worthy of\nretribution, as [Deuteronomy 28:47] states: \"...because you did not\nserve God, your Lord, with happiness and a glad heart.\"  Whoever holds\nhimself proud, giving himself honor, and acts haughtily in such\nsituations is a sinner and a fool. Concerning this, Solomon warned\n[Proverbs 28:10]: \"Do not seek glory before the King.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maggid Mishnah (ad loc):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דברי רבינו מבוארים בכ\"מ בגמרא ובבמה מדליקין (שבת ל':) אמרו ושבחתי אני\nאת השמחה זו שמחה של מצוה. ועיקר הדבר הוא שאין ראוי לו לאדם לעשות המצות\nמצד שהן חובה עליו והוא מוכרח ואנוס בעשייתן אלא חייב לעשותן והוא שמח\nבעשייתן ויעשה הטוב מצד שהוא טוב ויבחר באמת מצד שהוא אמת ויקל בעיניו\nטרחן ויבין כי לכך נוצר לשמש את קונו וכשהוא עושה מה שנברא בשבילו ישמח\nויגיל לפי ששמחת שאר דברים תלוים בדברים בטלים שאינן קיימים אבל השמחה\nבעשיית המצות ובלמידת התורה והחכמה היא השמחה האמיתית. וזהו ששלמה בדרכי\nמוסרו שבח שמחת החכמה ואמר בני אם חכם לבך ישמח לבי גם אני</p>\n<p>The words of our Rabbi [the Rambam] are explained in many places in\nthe Gemara and in the chapter Bameh Madliqin (Shabboth 30b), where\nthey state “Then I commended joy': this refers to the joy of a\nprecept.” And the fundament of the matter is that it is not proper\nthat a man should perform commandments [miswoth] from the perspective\nthat it is obligatory upon him and that he is forced to and is under\nduress to perform them. Rather he is obligated to perform them and be\nglad in their performance and to do that which is good from the view\nthat it is good and choose the truth from the vantage that it is the\ntruth, and therefrom his toils will be easy to his eyes and he will\nunderstand that it is for thus that he is formed to serve his Creator.\nAnd when he does that which was created for him, he will be glad and\nrejoice. For the joy [simhah] produced by the rest of the matters are\ncontingent on trivial matters that have no permanence, however the joy\nproduced by the performance of commandments [miswoth] and by learning\nTorah and Wisdom, is true joy. And it is this that Solomon referred to\nby means of his instruction in praise of the joy of Wisdom and said\n“my son, if your heart is wise, my heart will be joyous, as will I.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, simhah is a byproduct of a shift in perspective, wherein one does not relate to miswoth, Talmud Torah and Hokhmah as a burden, rather they are the good and the source of truth. When one truly internalizes this perspective and relates to their ‘avodah in this way, then it will produce a different type of simhah (one might call this ‘satisfaction’) which is categorically different than the simhah derived from trivial pursuits [debharim betelim]. This call to shift one’s perspective is not a call to experience ecstatic elation (though it may be present at times too), it is a call to relate to one’s avodah in a way that will naturally produce satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n",

I was wondering if anyone here has any leads? The idea has personally been very important to me, so it would be nice to explore in more detail.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Maybe the Rav misspoke and the original is not \"crown\", so any reference to these 3 as a group as applicable \"achievements\" for each Jew would be highly sought!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>In the מאמר in ספר מאמרים מלוקט ד\"ה והקדשתי <a href=\"https://chabadlibrary.org/books/admur/mlukat/3/39/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://chabadlibrary.org/books/admur/mlukat/3/39/index.htm</a> it brings from a couple different sources from likutei torah this idea.</p>\n<p>It says that \"I will become sanctified amidst the people of yisroyayl\" (which, on the simple plane, is referring to mesiras nefesh), refers to how one goes out of oneself to become included in Hashem (which is the simple implication of mesiras nefesh), from below to above.</p>\n<p>This \"holiness\" that's from below to above refers to the first, of three, levels of \"kadosh\".</p>\n<p>Then when the verse continues \"I am Hashem, who makes you holy\" it refers to two (out of three) levels of \"kadosh\".</p>\n<p>One is through mitzvos, and another through torah, and both are from above to below (from Hashem, who gave us them).</p>\n<p>The difference is that through torah, one draws down Hashem's holiness in the inner part of the universes, and through mitzvos, one reveals it even in the physical world (external aspect).</p>\n<p>It then continues, quoting from an explanation of the maamer, that the 3 times קדוש\"kadosh\", correspond to 3 levels of \"kesser\"--crown</p>\n<p>First one (from below to above) corresponds to the highest level of kesser, even beyond chochmah</p>\n<p>(And later explains that because it's beyond everything, in order to actually reach it, one has to go out of one's existence (mesiras nefesh), from below to above, to reach it)</p>\n<p>The second kadosh is kesser of zeir anpin {higher levels of the Sefiros of atzilus}</p>\n<p>(And he explains that that is like how Torah reveals the energy in the inner part of the universes, zeir annpin)</p>\n<p>And the third kadosh is malchus (power of Hashem's speech, which makes him a king), which is sometimes itself called a \"crown\", even though it's the lowest level</p>\n<p>(Which he explains corresponds to mitzvos, which reveal Hashem even in the outer aspect of the universes, and physicality, which is all made from Hashem's speech, malchus).</p>\n<p>So basically the first crown is a different category than the other two, since the first one is reached through mesiras nefesh (below to above), being ohr hasovev, completely infinite light, while the other two are part of memale kol almin, which can be drawn down from above to below directly.</p>\n<p>It then brings the explanation to this maamer which brings from a midrash (and a different version of the midrash that we have), that by the giving of the Torah Hashem gave us two crowns.</p>\n<p>(Although actually in this maamer the midrash says that it's related to the angels saying 3 times \"kadosh\", tzareich iyun)</p>\n<p>It says this is like an analogy of members of a city who bring a king 3 crowns.</p>\n<p>What is a king supposed to do with 3 crowns? He takes one for himself (\"puts it on his head\"), and two he gives to his (two?) sons (\"gives them on the head of his sons\").</p>\n<p>Then this other version of the midrash brings the verses to support this, which are (from the parsha before):</p>\n<p>\"For I am holy\" -- crown he took for himself. (According to simple meaning). \"And you shall sanctify yourselves\", 1 crown for his sons. \"And be holy\", second crown for his sons</p>\n<p>(כי קדוש אני והתקדישתם והייתם קדושים).</p>\n<p>It then continues that our version of the midrash says that the two crowns given to his sons are :</p>\n<p>\"speak to the children of yisroyayl and say to them: be holy {for I am holy, but that's the crown he took for himself}, as one, for his sons, and the two other verses of \"And you shall sanctify yourselves\", and \"And be holy\" are both considered one crown {for his sons}</p>\n<p>Although in the other version, seemingly the phrase \"speak to.. Yisroyayl and be holy\" is not counted as a crown at all (for his sons), only the continuation of \"for I am holy\", is counted as the crown for Himself.</p>\n<p>Then the Rebbe explains a possible resolution to the two versions, that in the continuation of the midrash it says \"יכול כמוני,  {you might think that} you're able to be like me in holiness? תלמוד לומר, it teaches us {otherwise}: for I am holy; my holiness is beyond your holiness.\"</p>\n<p>The tzemach tzedek asks on this, that it's תמוה \"surprising\" , which is explained here simply to mean it's surprising to even think that a yid can \"be holy like me\", since there's no comparison between Creator and creation (according to chochmah of Seder histalshiloos).</p>\n<p>However, he then brings an explanation of the Alter Rebbe from a different discourse altogether, which explains that \"your holiness\" that is lower than \"my holiness\" refers to the \"awakening from below\" of the holiness that's drawn down through the Torah and Mitzvos (like what a Tzadik does), while \"my holiness that's beyond your holiness\" refers to an \"awakening from above\" which is beyond what anyone can reach through torah and Mitzvos, and can only be drawn down through teshuva.</p>\n<p>It then explains that when the tzemach tzedek said this is \"surprising\", that's only relative to how a Tzadik works, in Seder histalshiloos (and the only way they can have a relevance to the first \"crown\" (my holiness) is through mesiras nefesh, going out of themselves, but in terms of what they can actually draw down below, it's only the Torah and Mitzvos), ohr hamemale.</p>\n<p>However, through teshuva one becomes one with the Awtsmoos, and is even able to draw down the first crown, that He takes for Himself, below, because teshuva reveals how the essence of the soul is literally the essence of Hashem (the Awtsmoos), and through this יכול כמוני, \"you are able to be like me\".</p>\n<p>Then he says that this is the difference of the two versions, that the version which counted \"speak to.. And say to them to be holy\" as it's own crown, then that itself is what's given to the sons (with the other two verses), but \"for I am holy\" Hashem takes only for himself.</p>\n<p>But in the version which doesn't count that first verse as a crown given to his sons (and the two crowns are both from the later verses), then the phrase \"(speak to the children of yisroyayl and say to them to be holy,) because I am holy\" is the crown he takes for himself, but in reality that crown he takes for himself is drawn down to \"the children of yisroyayl\" (which is the simple meaning of \".. Because I am holy\", (meaning, you should be holy just at the same level of my holiness, \"because\" I am holy), which is drawn down through teshuva.</p>\n<p>It then goes in that when it says the first he took \"for himself\", while the other two he gave to the head of his \"sons\", to mean that the \"souls of tzadikim\" are in the level of \"sons\" (בנים למקום),  a level of \"Seder histalshiloos\", while through teshuva one reveals, as mentioned, how the soul is united with the Essence of Hashem, such that even as it's \"given\" to a Baal Teshuva, it's still \"on the head of the king\".</p>\n<p><strong>So to answer your question, it seems this person mentioned a martyr and a Tzadik as two different levels, but here it explains that it's two different ways a Tzadik functions: 1 is mesiras nefesh from below to above to be included in the ohr hasovev, the first \"crown\", but in terms of his day to day life, he is mainly involved in the second and third crowns, to draw them down from above to below into the world</strong></p>\n<p>However the baal teshuva is the idea of drawing down even the first crown from above to below (since they are rooted in the Awtsmoos), and I don't recall if it says what they do with the other 2 crowns, but maybe it means that after teshuva, even one's torah and Mitzvos are higher</p>\n<p><em>Additional thoughts:</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>ספר המאמרים תשע\"ב explains at great length the relationship of the two crowns given at the Giving of the Torah, to the 3 crowns of \"the crown of Torah, crown of priesthood, and the crown of kingship (and the crown of a good name which surpasses all of them)\", along with the 3 times kadosh, so perhaps there is more elaboration found there.</p>\n<p>Just for the record, after writing this I opened up Tanya to a random page and it was the beginning of chapter 27, just read through it and at the end it gives another explanation of the two verses regarding holiness, that:</p>\n<p>\"You shall be holy\" meaning that one has to put in effort to make oneself holy, even if one in truth is not holy / \"separate\" from the \"other side\" (because a beinoni is one who still has the desire for evil etc. but still forces oneself to go against it, \"make yourselves holy\", through staying away from permissible things), then</p>\n<p>\"And you will be holy\", because through one's effort, then one is destined to truly be \"holy\" and separated from evil through the help one receives from above.</p>\n<p>Interesting that here in Tanya the Alter Rebbe says that both of these verses refer to a beinoni, unlike in likutei torah etc. where they refer to tzadikim (sons). It's hard to tell if this explanation in Tanya fits with both versions of the midrash or only one.</p>\n<p>Also today I opened to a random page in ספר המאמרים תרס\"ו, and it was the end of parshas Kesoshim, and it talked about the two levels of holiness mentioned here, that \"your holiness\" refers to the Sefiros of Atzilus, for reasons mentioned there, and \"my holiness that is beyond your holiness\", refers to either the Sefiros of Adam Kadmon, or the concept of Sefiros like they exist before the first tzimtsoom.</p>\n<p>He explained that the difference between the simple meaning of \"you shall be holy, because I am holy\", is mainly related to the explanation that \"I am holy\" refers to the Sefiros of Adam Kadmon, which are more closely related to the Sefiros of Atzilus, so it's possible to reach them, while according to the explanation that \"my holiness\" refers to how the Sefiros exist before the tzimtsoom, that's where the Midrash says \"{you might think that} you're able to be like me? It teaches us {otherwise:} I am holy. My holiness is beyond your holiness\".</p>\n<p>That's what it says there, so connecting it back to this discourse, \"your holiness\" through the Torah and Mitzvos seemingly correspond to the Sefiros of Adam Kadmon (Torah) and Atzilus (Mitzvos), which is also how a Tzadik goes about his daily life etc., the lower two \"crowns\" (Adam Kadmon is also called \"kesser\", maybe it means Atik, and the lower aspect of Kesser, Arich, the source of the ten Sefiros of Atzilus (which is really like malchus of Adam Kadmon))</p>\n<p>While the first \"crown\" that a Tzadik can only reach through mesiras nefesh, and that a Baal Teshuva can draw down directly, which we said is \"Sovev kol almin\" seemingly corresponds to the light before the tzimtsoom, \"my holiness that is beyond your holiness\".</p>\n<p>This also makes sense since generally speaking, the term \"Sovev kol almin\", \"light that surrounds all worlds\", generally refers to the light before the tzimtsoom.</p>\n<p>If so, the idea mentioned in the shiur that one has to be reincarnated to reach all of the levels etc., might correspond to the prophecy mentioned at the end of Likutei Torah, that in the time before Moshiach, new souls will emerge that weren't even included in Adam Kadmon.</p>\n<p>Maybe it means that these souls will have a connection to the ohr hasovev, the light before the tzimtsoom, which is reached either through mesiras nefesh of a Tzadik, or Teshuva.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Still haven't found an exact reference to the 3 crowns idea in those words, but to serve as an explanation of the overall idea, it says in Shaar Gilgulim 3 that the Arizal states very clearly that the generation before Moshiach will be a generation where everyone has achieved a full tikun in their nefesh, ruach and neshama. This implies that we all do indeed have the \"crown of Tzaddik\" (assuming we are the generation before the Moshiach - not going to get into that here), and therefore a very reasonable inference of why we are all here, now, in this current modern situation of a huge number of people who need to do some form of teshuva, that we are here to attain the \"crown\" of \"baal teshuva\".</p>\n<p>In this gate he also reveals some information on the idea of <em>ibur</em>, in that the parts of our nefesh, ruach or neshama that are either already perfected, or have only a minor blemish that does not warrant gilgul, are reincarnated as <em>ibur</em> rather than <em>gilgul</em>, meaning they are not able to become blemished by any sins we do in this incarnation. So, even if some of us are here to fix a blemish, the chances are that this late in history we already have the vast majority of our nefesh, ruach and neshama perfected and untouchable, and the idea still generally applies.</p>\n\n\n",

It is correspondingly a time to really storm the heavens and daven with a greater level of intensity.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.623.3?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 623:3</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי בנעילה הוא חתימת הגז\"ד שנכתב בר\"ה על בני אדם לטוב או לרע ויזדרז מאד בתפלה זו כי תכלית כל העשי\"ת הוא יוה\"כ ותכלית יוה\"כ הוא תפלת נעילה שהכל הולך אחר החיתום ואם לא עכשיו אימתי ולכן אף אם חלש הוא מחמת התענית מ\"מ יאזור כגבור חלציו להתפלל במחשבה זכה וברורה ולקבל ע\"ע נדרי התשובה באמת והבא לטהר מסייעין אותו ויחתם בספר חיים טובים.</p>\n<p>Because Neilah marks the sealing of our judgement that was written on Rosh Hashanah on every person whether for good or bad, he should be very zealous with this tefillah because the main point of all the Ten Days of Repentance is Yom Kippur, and the main purpose of Yom Kippur is Neilah since everything goes after the sealing, and if not now, when? And therefore, if a person is weak as a result of the fast, nevertheless, he should gird his loins like a mighty person to pray with a clear and meritorious thought and to receive the vows of repentance in truth and come to purify himself and be signed in a book of good life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the kibbudim of this auspicious time is to receive pesicha from the beginning of chazaras hashatz (the Chazzan's repetition of the amidah) which has many a segulah attached.

Is it better for him to concentrate on his own amida where he can take his time with his kavanna and add all his personal bakashos (requests), or should he cut short his amida, i.e. do it in less time than he would normally so that he can do pesichas neilah?</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, there are some individuals who may have such a decree as a reward or punishment. Regardless, the principle of free will is paramount, and any statement that seems to contradict it should not be accepted at face value.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Thanks everyone for the answers. It's possible there are different shittot about free will, and I got the gist from all of the answers offered that people are not holding in the same shita as me, or I was able to still view my shita in questions that told me my shita wasn't correct (or at least, I had unanswered kashes), and I have researched an answer now that fits with my exact question, so I will answer my own question.</p>\n<p>Firstly, the Rambam is very strong with free will, and there's no need to make an argument against this in light of the question. As Deuteronomy shared here: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eight_Chapters.8.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שמונה פרקים: פרק שמיני</a> and wbf's answer, the Rambam is very clear that we shouldn't assume that there's no free will even when it comes to pre-destined marriages. See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Teshuva 5:1-4</a></p>\n<p>So really, this calls into question how we resolve the idea of \"pre-destined\" and free will. The Rambam says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.5.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Teshuva 5:5</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God certainly knows all that will transpire...but this is known without doubt: that the deeds of man are in the hands of man, and God does not induce or coerce a person to do anything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hasagot_HaRaavad_on_Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.5.5.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Raavad's gloss on this</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rather, it is like the knowledge of a fortune-teller, who knows, by some other means, what a particular person's parth will be... The Creator knows the strength of the influence of the constellations at any given moment, and if the person will muster the strength to overcome this influence or not. This knowledge does not coerce the person's choice...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 3:15</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything is foreseen, and free choice is granted</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And Tosfot Yom Tov's <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.15?lang=bi&with=Tosafot%20Yom%20Tov&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary</a> on the above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is no contradiction in the first place. God's knowledge of the future is the result of His observing the deed that the person is doing... One cannot argue that because God knows the future actions of man He therefore compels them, because for God there is no \"before\" and \"after\"...So just like our knowledge of the present has no compelling effect, so, too, God's knowledge is always in the present and this is non-compelling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, what we conclude from all this is that you can have \"meant to be\", meaning, Hashem decided since before Bereshit who you will marry (and it will really be your actual other half of your soul), or if you will even have a zivug. The way He works this out, is by \"looking\" into \"the future\" to see what your choices are, and takes all of that into account in His Eternal Plan. This is what it means for us to be partner's in creation, and why this is all so infinitely <em>serious</em>. Hashem has, so to speak, put His Plan into <em>our hands</em>. When we keep mitzvot, then that's great, but when we sin, we are, so to speak, messing things up.</p>\n<p>If someone chooses to not get married (or to have mamzerim, or to marry someone forbidden to them), this is, <em>simultaneously</em> his own choice and responsibility, <em>and</em> meant-to-be. Hashem's whole Plan took this into account since before creation, but was, so to speak, based around this bad choice (and therefore - before Rav Dessler's 'levels of free will' and Berdichever 'Hashem don's lechaf zechus' ideas is entirely our fault, not His i.e. we cannot say He pre-destined a sin). Hashem only knows what lengths He goes to, to \"clean up\" after us. Surely, it is considered difficult like קריעת ים סוף (see <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=2&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sota</a> 2a, thanks conceptualinertia for your answer).</p>\n<p>Of course, there are still seeming paradoxes here, and things we can't possibly grasp. As the Rambam says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Know that the answer to this question, \"longer than the land is its measure, and broader than the sea\"... \"My thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor are your ways as My ways\"... (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.55.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yishayahu 55:8</a>) therefore we lack the capacity to know the nature of God's knowledge of all creations and all actions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This answer is a very unified answer. It holds by zivug, it holds by hard free will, it respects the point that it's impossible to truly grasp Hashem and His ways, it fits well in all my Torah knowledge and I am happy with this answer. Feel free to comment your thoughts and kashes!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think that logically, there are 3 possible solutions: -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hashem knows what we will all choose, so if you make that choice, no zivug/children are allocated to you (or if you prefer to look at it a different way, Hashem exists outside time, so He does it retrospectively after you make the decision).</li>\n<li>The zivug & children are reallocated to someone else, maybe who wouldn't have gotten married otherwise.</li>\n<li>The concept of a zivug isn't to be interpreted in that way and whoever you choose to marry you make your zivug.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Parameters of a Cheshbon Hanefesh\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've come across the concept of a Cheshbon Hanefesh (eg. in Garden of Emunah).  Is this a universally recognised thing?  Is there any halacha about it?  Do different opinions consider it to be compulsory/voluntary?  Are there different opinions on how to do it?  How often should it be done?  Does it always need to be done completely or is a partial one sufficient and/or useful? Is it necessarily always a wise thing to do (eg. if someone may find it overwhelming)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The simple answer is - Yes. It is a very widespread idea and there exists a wealth of material on the subject. The concept being that it is an effective way to improve oneself through doing a spiritual accounting. That being said, if you can't feel that you can manage it - then don't. There is no outright obligation to do so, it is just a prescribed method to help with self-correction.</p>\n<p>Famously, the Chovas Halevavos (Duties of the Heart) has a <a

But rather to immediately grasp hold of it and not be lax in it, utilizing it to toil in the affairs of his soul and the improvement of his service of G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shelah HaKadosh brings down in Asara Hillulim a chapter entitled <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Asara_Hillulim%2C_Shaar_Cheshbon_HaNefesh.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Shaar Chesbon HaNefesh\"</a> and provides quite an extensive approach to embark on such an undertaking.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובכל שבוע משבועת החודש ובכל יום מימות השבוע ובכל שעה משעות היום ובכל רגע מרגעי השעות נלך בנערינו ובזקנינו ויחשוב אדם עם נפשו בימים שיצאו וחלפו ועברו שהלך אחר ההבל ועתיד שיתן דין וחשבון לפני קונו משל למלך שנתן צרור כסף לעבדו והזהירו שלא יוציא ממנו לבטלה ואוי לו בבואו לחשבון ולקח אותו ואיננו גם זה לך חשבון עם נפשך בהתבונן ההתבודדות כי רוב העבירות לא יגמרו אלא בשנים זנות רכילות לה\"ר שבועת שקר ליצנות גאוה שיחת חולין חניפות שנאת חנם חמדה ותאוה וכיוצא בהם אף גם בהפרידך מבני אדם ואהבת לרעך כמוך להדריכם בדרך ישרה ללמדם תורה ומצות והרחק כל נזק מהם ותדרוש בשלמותם וטובותיהם</p>\n<p>And every week from the weeks of the month, and every day from the days of the week, and every hour of the hours of the day, and every moment, we should (lit.) walk in our youth and in our old age, and a person should think with his soul about the days that have come and gone, and a past that followed vanity and a future that will give an account before its Creator. A parable is that of a king who gave a bundle of money to his servant and warned him not to waste it, and woe to him when he came to the reckoning where he took it but didn't do anything with it. This is also an accounting of your soul in solitude and concentration - because the majority of sins will not be completed (i.e. fixed) for many years; immorality, gossip, slander, falsefully swearing, scoffing, arrogance, mundane talk, flattery, baseless hatred, greed, desire and similar. Also in your separation from people, and loving your neighbour like yourself, to go on the straight path, to teach them Torah and mitzvos and to distance from any harm from them and to seek their integrity and good...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However the reason it was done outside is that bringing it outside purifies the outside world from impurities. (don't know what that means-The Ramban in his introduction to Chumash says that those who don't understand Kabala won't understand the kabbalistic references in his work on Chumuash even if they understand the translation of the words)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The reason it was done outside comes from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.19.3?lang=en&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Numbers.19.22.6&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verses</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And you shall give her to El῾azar the priest, <strong>that he may bring her outside the camp,</strong> and she shall be slaughtered before his face:<br />\nAnd El῾azar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, <strong>and sprinkle of her blood towards the front of the Tent of Meeting</strong> seven times:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi there explains that outside the camp meant outside the three camps (Tabernacle, Levites, and Israel). In the Temple times, that translated to outside the city of Jerusalem. And the sprinkling of the blood had to be with a view of the door to the Temple sanctuary. As that was on a mountain, it would take being on another mountain to see it.</p>\n<p>It is more likely the Christians deliberately made the story of Jesus occur on Mt. Olives in order to make the connection seem more apparent, as they did with the rest of the story. They decided to make Jesus connected to the red heifer, so they wrote the story with him killed on Mt. Olives. They act like the archer in the famous <a href=\"https://njop.org/preacher-man-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">parable</a> of the Dubno Maggid:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A man found an archer at an archery range who had only perfectly accurate shots.

It is your Father in Heaven as it is stated: “And I will sprinkle purifying water upon you, and you shall be purified”\" - for this verse was said with regards to the future redemption, and from here it is proven that the redemption of Yisrael depends on purity.</p>\n<p>The miracle that the Holy One, Blessed is He did during the days of Chanukah to show the love of Yisrael that light the menorah candles with pure oil [as opposed to other substances], though by law they could have used impure oil - is a statement from above that during the time of the exile there is a need for giving one's life [mesirat nefesh] (which is an example for the idea of a miracle in relation to the labor of man) even with regards to a place where he would be able to find himself a leniency [heter] according to the Shulchan Aruch, and from this we can see the love of Yisrael, who give themselves up even for stringencies and beautification (hidur) of keeping Torah and Mitzvot to the fullest, such as lighting the menorah with specifically pure oil.</p>\n<p>And so also during \"this time\" [hazman hazeh] - when one toils in Torah in the turest manner, and via the knowledge that this is \"Your Torah\", the Torah of the Holy One, Blessed is He, and therefore there is no agreeing on compromises, and no searching for leniencies [heterim] etc, rather - upholding forcefully even the smallest detail, meaning, that when the purpose of the antagonist is to distance from Judaism, so there is no implication whether we're talking about a shoelace, or education that must be drilled into the head - on both one must give his life equally, even if he is \"few\" and \"weak\" and cannot see how he would actively be able to implement this.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Samuel Rosenblatt of JTS took up the same argument in <em>Journal of Biblical Literature</em>\nVol. 60.</p>\n<p>Note also that Yalqut Shimoni says לפי שראה פרעה באצטנגינות ואמר להם לישראל ראו כי רעה נגד פניכם אמר להם אני רואה באצטגנינות שלי כוכב אחד עולה לקראתכם שמו רעה והוא סימן דם . . . (also Shir Hashirim Rabba in some versions) but Lekah Tov says ראו כי רעה נגד פניכם. זה בעל צפון, אמר להם נגד דרכיכם טעותו עומד והוא יריע לכם.</p>\n<p>In a similar example, it is well known that both some rishonim and some modern scholars assume וַיִּקַּח אֶת־עֲטֶרֶת־מַלְכָּם in II Sam. 12:30 refers to מִלְכֹּם שִׁקֻּץ עַמֹּנִים (I Kings 11:5 and elsewhere), including Rashi: את עטרת מלכם תועבת בני עמון מלכם שמו לשון מולך.</p>\n<p>IMO it's easy to imagine that this was originally a tradition based on the identification of רעה with Ra but, because none of the medieval scribes were actually familiar with Egyptian cosmogony, it became confused.</p>\n\n\n",

If you calculate from the 16th of Nissan (which he calculates is when Moshe was punished) three daily prayers (ignoring <em>Mussaf</em> prayers), you'll find on Yom Kippur after Mincha to be 514 prayers (<em>Cf.</em> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21254&st=&pgnum=236\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derashos Chasam Sofer</a> p. 325a, where he has a different calculation which ends the second morning of <em>Sukkos</em>). It must be then that Moshe added an extra prayer, namely <em>Neilah</em>, which is how we get to the 515 prayers.</p>\n<p>Personally, I'm not sure how it follows that since Moshe must have prayed an extra prayer at that time, that he instituted a formal extra prayer every Yom Kippur from then on.

This commentary is part of the \"פירוש הקצר\" on the Yerushalmi probably written by Rabbi David Darshan, who was a student of the Ramah (רמ\"א). It was originally printed anonymously in the Krakow Yerushalmi edition of 1609, and then the authorship of the commentary was apparently lost to time until a number of decades ago, when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Lieberman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Shaul Lieberman</a> studied a set of Yerushalmi that had handwritten notes in the margins by R' Ze'ev Wolf Rabinowitz.<sup>1</sup> In the introductory page he noted on this mysterious commentary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אף כי העלים את שמו בתחלתו הנה גלה אותו בתוכו בנזיר רפ\"ו וחתם את שמו \"דוד דרשן\"\"(<a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/he/manuscripts/NNL_ALEPH000044244/NLI#$FL77896711\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"And though he hid his name in the beginning of this [commentary], he revealed it in the middle, in Nazir, at the start of the 6th chapter and signed his name \"David Darshan\".\"<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FtQ3x.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FtQ3x.png\" alt=\"R' Rabbinowitz's note in the margins\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now, the printers of the Vilna Shas were simply copying what previous printers of Bavli Horayot had done, which is to add the Yerushalmi Horayot with the anonymous commentary at the bottom. This was first done by the פפד\"מ (Frankfurt am Main) printing of 1720 (see <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42036&st=&pgnum=28\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) by R' Yehudah Aryeh Leib, originally from Amsterdam. I couldn't find any explanation that he himself wrote for why he did that, but <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%A8_%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yissachar Tamar</a> wrote in his introduction to his commentary on the Yerushalmi, עלי תמר, p. 7:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ואין להביא בחשבון גמרא דבני מערבא על הוריות עם פירוש הקצר של דפוס קראקא. שהיא הוספה מאוחרת בדפוס פפד\"מ ת\"פ ע\"י הרב רבי ליב ז\"ל למלא החסרון שאין תוספות על גמרא זו. וכן הדפיס תוספות קצרות שנמצא בכ\"י שהיה בידי הרב ר\"א איטינגא.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"And one should not count the gemara of the people of Ma'arava (the Land of Israel) on Horayot with the short commentary by the Krakow Edition (as being similar to the inclusion of Yerushalmi Shekalim to the Bavli). For that is a later addition in the Frankfurt 1720 edition by Rabbi Leib z\"l to fill the place of the Tosfot which this tractate lacks. And he also printed short Tosfot that were found in a manuscript that was in the hands of Rabbi A.

Within Ezekiel 46:1 it says, “‘Thus said the Master יהוה, ‘The gate of the inner courtyard facing east is <em><strong>shut the six days of work</strong></em>, but on the <em><strong>Sabbath</strong></em> it is <em><strong>opened</strong></em>, <em><strong>and on the day of the New Moon it is opened</strong></em>.” With that being said, because the gates were open on Shabbath and Rosh Chodesh, but shut during the six working days, is Rosh Chodesh a part of the six working days?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You ask whether Rosh Chodesh is a part of the six working days.</p>\n<p>The Radak and the Metzudas Dovid on the possuk in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.46.1?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezekiel 46:1</a> that you quote say that the eastern gate to the Ezras Yisroel was closed on working days because neither the people nor the Nosi came to the Temple except on Shabbosos and Roshei Chodoshim.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.46.1?lang=bi&with=Chomat%20Anakh&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chomat Anakh (by the Chida)</a> on the other hand says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שער החצר וכו' ששת ימי המעשה וביום השבת יפתח וביום החדש יפתח. פשטיה\nדקרא דבר\"ח אין עושין מלאכה אך אפשר שאינו מן הדין אלא מנהג והכי משמע\nמקרא דשמואל דכתיב אשר נסתרת שם ביום המעשה ותרגם יונתן ביומא דחולא משמע\nדגם האנשים לא היו עושים מלאכה בר\"ח. אמנם רוב הראשונים כתבו דדוקא הנשים\nהוא שאינם עושות מלאכה. וכ'</p>\n<p>The simple meaning of the possuk is that on Rosh Chodesh work is not\ndone.

If so, how can we function without driving ourselves mad by constantly having to do mitzvahs that we have the opportunity to do?</p>\n<p>EDIT: Another example to clarify.  I walked past a blood drive yesterday and felt bad for not giving blood, because it could save someone's life and therefore be Pikuach Nefesh.  I think it would have been a mitzva had I done that, but does that mean I was obligated to?  I think this is perhaps a better example because it is not clearly obligatory, but it is quite a significant thing, being (sofek) Pikuach Nefesh?

[Kalnevo is the name of an idol.] Ulla said to him: This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan said: With regard to any object of idol worship that is written in the Torah, it is permitted to mention its name. Since one may mention the idol while reading the Torah, it is permitted to mention it altogether. Rava asked: And where is this idol written?

In fact, the Hebrew letters of the word Teshuvah- תשובה, contain the letters of the word Shabbat – שבת. If you turn around the letters it can be read as ‘v’Shavta’ – and you shall return!

However, its deeper meaning is related to teshuva, “repentance” or “return,” for on Shabbat we return to the foundations of faith associated with Zakhor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Peninei_Halakhah%2C_Shabbat.5.12.4?ven=Peninei_Halakhah,_English_ed._Yeshivat_Har_Bracha&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">And</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sages add (ibid.) that one who recites Va-yekhulu on Friday night is escorted home by two ministering angels, who rest their hands upon his head and say: “Your guilt shall depart and your sin be purged” (Yeshayahu 6:7). Shabbat is also connected to teshuva – repentance or return. This is expressed in the phonetic similarity of “Shabbat” and “teshuva.” Indeed, on Shabbat we remember the Creator of the world, and we return to all the positive strivings of our souls. One who recites Va-yekhulu on Friday night gives expression to the deep significance of Shabbat. By doing so he merits true repentance and the forgiveness of his sins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are two kinds of teshuva, 1) teshuvah tataah (lower-level teshuva) and 2) teshuvah ilaah (higher-level teshuva) - see: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7937/jewish/Chapter-4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igeres HaTeshuva of the Alter Rebbe, chapter 4</a>.

There is a lot of regretting going on with this level of teshuva. This is not allowed on Shabbos. See for example the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.306.38?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah (306:38)</a> which says that we are not allowed to read something that causes one to be sad on Shabbos.</p>\n<p>However, the higher-form of teshuva, one is allowed to do. Because, this form of teshuva does one thing, bringing us back to Hashem and creating a stronger bond. Such thing can be done ofcourse on Shabbos.</p>\n<p>The Alter Rebbe in Tanya, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1029248/jewish/Chapter-10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igeres Hateshuva, chapter 10</a> goes on to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the same time we must note the Beraita there, \"Our Sages taught, 'One embarks on worship only with joy.'\" In our bereaved generation, when not all are capable of turning their hearts instantly from the extreme of humility to joy, it is advised that the time for teshuvah tata'a be designated at Tikun Chatzot, as we noted above. Whoever cannot do this nightly should maintain an absolute minimum of once every week, before the Shabbat. <strong>It is familiar to the initiates that Shabbat is on the order of teshuvah ila'a, and the very letters of the word Shabbat spell tashev, as in, \"You return man.\" On Shabbat all the worlds ascend to their source ... The Shabbat worship particularly is on the order of teshuvah ila'a. This will suffice for the knowledgeable.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So yes, teshuva requires remorse and regret on sins.

    "content": "# Adding the 13 middot during / after the Chatanu Selichot on Yom Kippur\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Originally, Minhag Ashkenaz was to recite <em>selichot</em>, accompanied by the 13 <em>middot</em>, during <em>chazarat hashatz</em> of all prayers of Yom Kippur. For various reasons, the vast majority of congregations today omit them in <em>shacharit</em>, <em>musaf</em> and <em>mincha</em>, and most of the commonly-printed <em>machzorim</em> print no <em>selichot</em> in these prayers. (See e.g. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/85352/selichot-on-yom-hakkipurim\">here</a> for further discussion.) These <em>selichot</em> are recited after <em>ya'aleh veyavo</em>, and are followed by <em>zechor rachamecha</em> (which is printed in <em>machzorim</em>).</p>\n<p>Consider a synagogue that wishes to recite the 13 <em>middot</em>, but does not want to publish separate booklets / handouts of <em>selichot</em> to be recited. One possible solution would be to recite the 13 <em>middot</em> in conjuction with (either during or immediately following) the <em>'chatanu' selichot</em>, which are said after <em>zechor rachamecha</em> and before <em>zechor lanu berit avot</em> and which do appear in the <em>machzorim</em>. This has the advantage of allowing congregants to use only their <em>machzor</em>, without needing a separate source for additional <em>piyutim</em>.</p>\n<p>Are there any sources discussing the legitimacy / advisability of such a practice? I note that classically, the 13 <em>middot</em> would only be recited before <em>zechor rachamecha</em>, but is there any problem doing so afterwards?</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, one should view the midrash as a veiled criticism of Christianity, which the Roman government sought to impose upon the Jewish people. It is a form of religion based on the Scripture and devoid of any Oral Law, <em>Shakla v'Tarya</em>, Midrashim, etc. to help one understand the essence of the Torah words.</p>\n<p>The kind of punishment, sought by the Roman emperor, can be compared to how Reuven responded to Yaakov avinu, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.42.37?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 42:37</a>, on the possibility that he may not bring Binyamin from Mitzraim. Jewish people certainly attoned for sale of Yosef by being subjugated to slavery in Mitzraim. Thus, in the end, the Roman emperor has faith coming out of the Scripture which interprets the law against it!</p>\n<p>Another point of the midrash is the interest of the Roman emperor in Torah can be compared to a specific moment of the sale of the birthright by Eisav to Yaakov, when Eisav states <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.25.30?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 25:30</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Esau said to Jacob, “Give me some of that red stuff to gulp down, for I am famished”—which is why he was named Edom.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Emperor's asking about Yosef's story is no different from Eisav's \"I am famished\", rabbis, entertain me by puring down my throat that spiritual \"lentil stew\".</p>\n<p>Historically, the Roman Emperor who expressed interest in Judaism was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nero</a>. The New Testament account of Paul's contacts with emperor went through people working for Nero. The Jewish legend in Gemara Gittin 56a-b states that Nero converted to Judaism. With the death of Nero a number of very unfortunate events took place. Nero was the last member of the first Roman imperial dynasty of Tiberii of patrician origin. There was an uprising against Rome by zealots, possibly fuelled by the Parthian empire and certainly supported by its vassal the kindom of Adiabene. The new imperial dynasty of Flavii had non-patrician origins, but sought to start a new imperial cult to become equal in reverence to the previous dynasty of Tiberii. Flavii had full cooperation of the Herodians and their money. That's how the new religious thought got its jump-start. Many emperors unrelated to Flavii since then sought to adopt the name Flavius, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Constantine the Great</a> who officially adopted Christianity as the imperial religion.</p>\n<p>The fact that the persecutions occured all the way through the time of Hadrian (Nerva-Antonine dynasty which suceeded the Flavii) can also be associated with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_the_Bible\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">timing</a> of all New Testatment books and formation of Christianity as a religion based on these books.</p>\n\n\n",

Neviim is written by other neviim, but they weren't as great as Moshe Rabbeinu, and Kesuvim weren't written by neviim at all.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Zohar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Pinchas.4.12-13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pinhas 213b</a>) states that every letter of \"Orayta\" is necessary, it then explains why it states \"שמרה\" instead of \"שמור\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.86.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">T'hillim 86:2</a>).</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Malbim writes <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%99%22%D7%9D_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95/%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in his introduction to Yeshaya</a> that every word of the Prophets are significant.

For all the words of the divine recommendation are weighed in the scales of wisdom and knowledge, arranged and preserved in a precise and counted measure of supreme wisdom, which alone will respond with its power to speak the truth.</p>\n<p>c] Not found in the prophetic utterances a shell without content, a body without a soul, clothing without a wearer, an empty utterance devoid of lofty thought, a speech where intelligence will not dwell. For all these words of God are alive within them, a living spirit in their nostrils, a fearsome, mighty, and terrible spirit.</p>\n<p>These three principles, the foundation upon which the interpretations of the prophets and the words in which the spirit of the Lord spoke in them and His word is on their tongues, will be acknowledged by every believer. For the spirit of the Lord spoke in the mouths of the prophets, and His word is on their tongues. Every believer with a whole heart, without a divided heart, will acknowledge that these are the words of the living God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Ramba'm in his Hakdama to Moreh Nevuchim says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודע כי משלי הנביאים יש בהם שני דרכים. מהם שכל מלה שבמשך ההוא יש בה עניין, ומהם מי שיהיה כל המשל מגיד לע כל העניין ההוא ויבאו במשך ההוא הנמשל דברים רבים מאד אין כל מלה מוספת ענין בענין ההוא אבל הם ליפות המשל וסדר הדברים בו או להפליג בהסתיר הענין הנמשל וימשכו הדברים כפי כל מה שראוי בגלויו של המשל ההוא. והבור זה מאד</p>\n<p>Know that the figures employed by prophets are of two kinds: first, where every word which occurs in the simile represents a certain idea; and secondly, where the simile, as a whole, represents a general idea, but has a great many points which have no reference whatever to that idea: they are simply required to give to the simile its proper form and order, or better to conceal the idea: the simile is therefore continued as far as necessary, according to its literal sense. Consider this well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramba'm goes on to bring as an example of the first type, where every word is needed as part of the nevua, Ya'akov's dream of the ladder. And as an example of the second type, the Ramba'm brings a long mashal from mishlei (7:6-26), which compares indulgence to adultery. So the Ramba'm says that some words are not there to be learned from, only to beautify the parable. However, this  seems to only apply to parables.</p>\n<p>Even this is contested, as the Shem Tov on the Moreh Nevuchim says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תמצא רוב המפרשים בהרבה מקומות יספקו על הרב ולא ידעו ולא יבינו בחשכה יתהלכו</p>\n<p>...You will find the majority of mefarshim in many places doubt the [Ramba'm], and \"they do not know and have not understood, and walk in the dark\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note: I'm still looking for those \"majority of mefarshim\" that argue with the Ramba'm, I haven't yet found someone who does so outright.\nIt's also possible the Ramba'm applies this to the Torah as well as Na'Ch, which would mean this isn't as good an answer, because the question was asked assuming we learn something from every word in Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yes.

There are plenty of questionable things that are permitted to <em>Jews</em>. For the Ramban, “Be holy” means “Restrain yourself even with what is permitted.”  A holy person is one who is not self-indulgent:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You shall be holy” means “You should keep distant from sin and licentious behavior”.  The Torah prohibits certain sexual behaviors, and prohibits certain foods and drinks. But it permits sex between husband and wife, and [permits] the consumption of kosher meat and [kosher] wine. This might allow a person to act in a lewd manner with his wife [perhaps even in public], gorge himself with meat, inebriate himself with wine, and use vulgar language as much as he desires.

We are people, we sin, but nevertheless, G-d gave us \"tools\" to improve ourselves and to do teshuva, in order to \"tilt the balance\". To be more meritorious. This is echoed by the sefer <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/108352/p/180/t/6522080771234/fs/NnXWRe1RvIJqKO510fiSNqoF1wq1d6HOpCESq8zlZvdV/start/10241/end/10307/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">פירוש רבינו יונה על פרקי אבות עם הארות וביאורים</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כן שיתחזק לעשות לפחות מצוה נוספת כדי להכריע עצמו לכף זכות על כל אחד ללמוד ממנו לעשות חשבון זה ולהתחזק במצוות ובמעשים טובים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The rough translation is that we should strengthen ourselves to do one more mitzvah, so as to convince ourselves that we are righteous. We should learn from this that we need to increase in doing more mitzvos and acts of kindness.</p>\n<p>The Alter Rebbe in Tanya <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1028872/jewish/Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Likutei Amarim, chapter 1)</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We find in the Gemara five distinct types—a righteous man who prospers, a righteous man who suffers, a wicked man who prospers, a wicked man who suffers, and an intermediate one (Benoni). It is there explained that the \"righteous man who prospers\" is the perfect tzaddik; the \"righteous man who suffers\" is the imperfect tzaddik. In Raaya Mehemna (Parshat Mishpatim) it is explained that the \"righteous man who suffers\" is one whose evil nature is subservient to his good nature, and so on. In the Gemara (end ch. 9, Berachot) it is stated that the righteous are motivated by their good nature,... and the wicked by their evil nature, while the intermediate men are motivated by both, and so on. Rabbah declared, \"I, for example, am a Benoni\" Said Abbaye to him, \"Master, you do not make it possible for anyone to live,\" and so on.</p>\n<p>To understand all the aforesaid clearly an explanation is needed, as\nalso to under-stand what Job said [Bava Batra, ch. i], \"Lord of the\nuniverse, Thou hast created righteous men and Thou hast created wicked\nmen,...\" for it is not preordained whether a man will be righteous or\nwicked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7891/jewish/Chapter-12.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Lessons in Tanya\"</a>, there is a explanation on this chapter that reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the Alter Rebbe states that the beinoni has never transgressed, he does not mean that the beinoni never sinned in his life as a human being but that in his life as a beinoni, he has no history of sin. The beinoni’s present spiritual state is such that sin—in the past as well as in the future—has no place in his life. He would not sin even if he were subject to the same temptations and trials which led him to sin in the past. It is therefore true to state that from the perspective of his present state, he has never sinned.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the Alter Rebbe’s statement that the beinoni “will never\nsin” is to be understood in the same vein. The intention is not that\nit is impossible for him to sin; he does not, after all, lose his\nfreedom of choice. Rather, as explained above, his present state is\nsuch that it precludes his sinning in the future, despite the trials\nthat the future may bring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, there is a concept of a sinner, but we are able to be a \"beinoni\", e.g. a “intermediate man”.

This makes sense to me, but I've never seen it in any other source.</p>\n<p>I'm working on reprinting my shul's gabbai's book (mostly based on the Artscroll \"Gabbai's Handbook\", but with notes about our customs), and I'm trying to decide whether to use the common phrasing or to copy how the old machzor has it.</p>\n<p>I suspect that the vast majority of such changes throughout history have been done by publishers without rabbinic input (and there are some <em><strong>very</strong></em> questionable changes - almost certainly mistakes - in the Hebrew Publishing Company machzor), but I'm curious if anyone has any sources that discuss the history and/or proper wording of the Mi Shebeirachs after aliyot.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the order of mitzvot importance?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, some hierarchy is established for tzitzis:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Torah equates this commandment, and also connects it, to all of the commandments of the Torah combined. (Siman 9:1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The commandment to don tefillin is also, in addition to the mitzvah of <em>tzitzis,</em> a very precious mitzvah. For the fulfillment of the entire Torah is equated with the mitzvah of <em>tefillin.</em> (Siman 10:1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, in the siddur Tehillat Hashem page 9:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are the precepts, the fruit of which man enjoys in this world, while the principal [reward] remains in the World to Come: honoring one's father and mother, performing deeds of kindness, early attendance at the House of Study morning and evening, hospitality to strangers, visiting the sick, dowering the bride, escorting the dead, concentration in prayer - and the study for Torah is equivalent to them all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How can we reconcile these verses? Is it not clearly established that tzitzis, tefillin, and Torah study are more important, since they are equal to all the others combined?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As mentioned, there <em>is</em> a different value to each mitzvah, we just don't know what it is.  Note also that the “value” of a mitzvah is not necessarily fixed.  It can vary.  The Mishnah says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בֶּן הֵא הֵא אוֹמֵר, לְפוּם צַעֲרָא אַגְרָא  --\nBen He He says: According to the effort is the reward. [Pirkei Avot 5:23]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It implies that mitzvot that require more effort count for more.  The Talmud adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One mitzvah involving pain is worth a hundred mitzvot that do not. [Avot de Rabbi Natan 3:6, Jerusalem Talmud]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fo example, contemporary Rabbi Dessler notes that someone born into an observant family will receive relatively little reward for observance, because it took little effort. Keeping commandments is automatic for him. Conversely, someone born in a non-religious family will receive much reward for being observant, and little, if any, punishment for not spending many hours a day studying Torah. [Rabbi E.E. Dessler, Michtav M'Eliyahu, Hebrew edition, book 1, page 113]</p>\n<p>So the bottom line is: All the quotes from Chazal that imply that some commandments are more important than others are simply personal opinions.  All agree that Jews are responsible for ALL commandments, and all agree that we don't know from the Torah the value of each commandment, so there can be no halacha about the value of commandments.</p>\n\n\n",

Our innermost desire will no longer be hidden by a yeitzer hara, a darkness and an ignorance. Our innermost desire is to cleave to Hashem, to perform His will, and get to know Him by studying His Torah, which reveals Him (the central theme of Likkutei Amarim, Tanya).

Right now, we get our satisfaction from developing Torah, and fixing the world. When Moshiach comes, the world will be fixed, Hashem will \"move in\" to His Bayit Ne'eman, and we will \"move in with Him\". All that will be left is to wake up every day and enjoy what we have built over the Galut, enjoy our Marriage, enjoy our Spouse. We will have to learn a \"New Torah\", meaning a Torah of enjoying <em>what is</em>, rather than <em>what can be</em>.

And similarly it states, “And from God [it was decreed] for the ruination of Achazyohu, that he come to Yorom, etc.” Thus it is taught in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Olam_Rabbah.17.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Seder Olam</strong></a> and in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Sotah.12.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Tosefta</strong></a> of [Maseches] Sotah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Only issue is that Rashi points out there appears to be no reference anywhere in Tanach for this marriage, meaning it might be going on another marriage from which we can balance out the numbers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, in all of Scripture, we do not find that Yehoshophot married Omri’s daughter. However, I did find in Divrei Hayomim, “And he intermarried with Achov.”\nPerhaps this [refers to] his sister whom he married. <strong>He married her in the thirty-first year of Asa</strong>, as it is stated, “In the thirty-first year of the reign of Asa, [King of Yehudah], Omri reigned [over Yisroel].” And we learned in Seder Olam that he reigned over the entire kingdom, for six years before then he reigned over half the people, and when Asa took his [Imri’s] daughter in marriage to [his son] Yehoshophot, Imri gained prestige, and they assassinated Tivni. <strong>Proceed and calculate from the thirty-first year of Asa until Achazyohu’s death and you will find them to be forty-two [years]</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Scholars of textual criticism consider the difference to be a copyist's error transcribing 4 instead of 2 in the first number of the age when they began to reign, now which side they erred no one knows for sure. Attempts to explain this by explanations that are not found in the scriptures have no scientific validity and are restricted to the theological sphere, it seems to me that you want an exact and technical explanation and this is the most accurate there is, as well as other inconsistencies as in reign of Jeconiah, began to reign at 8 or 18 years old? Here the same explanation fits, only this time they omitted or added the 1, which side of the books is the question. Only an addendum, some Greek and Syriac versions of 2 Chronicles 22:2 finds the age of 22 when he began to reign, only the Masoretic text which the modern translations are based on does not contain this version.</p>\n\n\n",

We know that Hashem is incorporeal (refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Ashkenaz%2C_Weekday%2C_Shacharit%2C_Post_Service%2C_Thirteen_Principles.3?vhe=The_Metsudah_siddur,_1981&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">no. 3</a> of 13 Principles of Faith). However, in order to demonstrate that they are deemed a level below G-d they are described in a way that us as humans can more readily comprehend.</p>\n<p>Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_1.49.3?ven=Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_English_Translation,_Friedlander_(1903)&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevuchim Part I:49</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In order, therefore, to give to the mind of men the idea that the existence of angels is lower than the existence of God, certain forms of lower animals were introduced in the description of angels. It was thereby shown that the existence of God is more perfect than that of angels, as much as man is more perfect than the lower animals. Nevertheless, no organ of the brute creation was attributed to the angels except wings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So why wings? Rambam continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Without wings the act of flying appears as impossible as that of walking without legs: for these two modes of motion can only be imagined in connection with these organs. The motion of flying has been chosen as a symbol to represent that angels possess life, because it is the most perfect and most sublime movement of the brute creation. Men consider this motion a perfection to such an extent that they themselves wish to be able to fly, in order to escape easily what is injurious, and to obtain quickly what is useful, though it be at a distance. For this reason, this motion has been attributed to the angels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam a bit <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_1.49.7?ven=Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_English_Translation,_Friedlander_(1903)&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">later</a> adds...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The motion of flying, frequently mentioned in the Bible, necessitates, according to our imagination, the existence of wings: wings are therefore given to the angels as symbols expressive of their existence, not of their true essence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a similar fashion, note the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Abarbanel_on_Isaiah.6.2.7?vhe=Abarbanel,_Tel_Aviv_1960&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a> who says expressly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שיוחס העופפות והכנפים למלאכים</p>\n<p>That flying and wings are attributed to angels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like Rambam he explains that they are described with a limb that is similar to that of an animal so that it reduces their level compared to that of Hashem, in the same way that an animal is viewed as a lesser creation to that of a human.</p>\n<p>As far as your third question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>why do angels need wings to fly around, either on earth or in the heavens\nIf we look at it in isolation i.e., not through the lens of the Rambam...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.6.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_Isaiah.6.2.6&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudas Dovid</a> writes clearly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יעופף. יעוף בשליחות המקום</p>\n<p>He would fly - He would fly on the job/mission of Hashem</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, G-d created them with the means to carry out His tasks and did this through the means of flight. (Cross-reference <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.4b.26?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 4b</a>)</p>\n<p>And possibly wings represent the most effective way to fly. Refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Isaiah.6.2.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכנפים הם סבת התנועה הממהרת מכל תנועות והוא העופפות</p>\n<p>And wings - these are the reason for the swiftest movement from all movements and this is flight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as your second question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My second question is why wings are used to cover body parts and not garments or veil?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Firstly, just to ascertain why they needed to be covered. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.6.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Isaiah.6.2.3-4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.6.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_Isaiah.6.2.4-5&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudas Dovid</a> explain that the face had to be covered so as not to look at the Shechinah, and the legs covered for modesty so that it will not show its whole body before their Creator. Additionally, the feet need to be covered so as not to act as a reminder of the Eigel HaZahav (the Golden Calf) as their feet resemble a calf's foot.</p>\n<p>I can only suggest based on the Rambam, that angels are not described as wearing/owning any clothing (unless perhaps if they are in the form of a human), and as such it reverts to the one thing that us as humans can picture them with - their wings. Accordingly, these wings are the means through which they can \"physically\" cover themselves with.</p>\n\n\n",

She's not even afflicted with any illnesses.</p>\n<p>Why is that? Is there a hidden message about her cooperation with Satan?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Job's wife wasn't part of the wager between God and <em>ha-satan</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Lord said to the accuser,[<em>ha-satan</em>] “Have you considered my\nservant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and\nupright man who fears God and turns away from evil.” Then the accuser\nanswered the Lord, “Does Job fear God for nothing? Have you not put a\nfence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You\nhave blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased\nin the land. But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has,\nand he will curse you to your face.” The Lord said to the accuser,\n“Very well, all that he has is in your power; only do not stretch out\nyour hand against him!” So the accuser went out from the presence of\nthe Lord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Is there a hidden message about her cooperation with Satan?</em> No. God did not boast of Mrs. Job's righteousness. She isn't part of the bargain. She's just a normal human being. In fact, she isn't even mentioned in the prologue, which many scholars believe is from a different author than the main body of the text. But later in the narrative, she does urge Job to stop standing in his integrity, even to curse God and die.</p>\n<p>However, we should not judge her as colluding with the Satan here. Rather, she is in the depths of despair and she gives in to it. Like any human being she is subject to the temptations of the <em>yetzer harah</em>. God's wager has resulted in the death of every one of her children, the complete loss of the family's once great wealth, and now the terrible disease that afflicts her husband. The longer Job persists in his righteous course - both insisting that he has not sinned and refusing to curse God - the more Job's suffering <em>and that of his wife</em> will only intensify. His wife's despair may be a part of Job's test, but she is not the instigator of the test, nor is there any hint of her willful cooperation with the personalized force of evil.</p>\n<p>We should also consider, that when Job's wife advised him to blaspheme and put an end to his suffering, his answer is a gentle rebuke, not a condemnation. “You speak as any foolish woman would speak. Shall we receive good from God and not receive evil?” He does not treat her as being in league with the devil, but as his loving wife for whom he has great compassion. Moreover, in the book's epilogue there is no mention of a new wife, and it seems God greatly rewarded both Job and his wife. This would make no sense if she had been a traitor in league with the enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Job's wife wasn't part of the wager between Satan and God, but she lost virtually everything that made her life worth living. In that sense, the OP is mistaken to suggest that she wasn't tested. It's true that she momentarily gave in to despair. Who among us would not?</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>See a discussion midrashic references to Job's wife <a href=\"https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/wife-of-job-midrash-and-aggadah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Torah says (Job 2:9):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then his wife said to him, Dost thou still retain thy integrity? curse G-d, and die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.2.9?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a>, in his commentary to this posuk explains this to mean:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After losing all his possessions and children, Job had still blessed G-d. But he now just remains silent. This time, he could not bring himself to do so. His wife taunts him: Are you still resolved to be perfect? Bless G-d once more again and you'll be dead!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, yes, according to the Malbim, Job's wife was taunting him to blaspheme G-d. However, as I will demonstrate below, there are many mefarshim that discusses the idea that although the wife seems to encourage her husband to sin against G-d, it was an act of protection.</p>\n<p>Although, this book is not written by a Jewish author (I apologize if it includes content not appropiate for this site), but the author of <a href=\"https://books.google.nl/books?id=vCj4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=why%20was%20job%27s%20wife%20spared%20judaism&source=bl&ots=YvX24IdRlT&sig=ACfU3U1yqEIDPlIN8faTSHgNS781fcojPA&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj9lLmwqeT6AhVI2aQKHRSLDvEQ6AF6BAgzEAM#v=onepage&q=why%20was%20job%27s%20wife%20spared%20judaism&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Book of Job: A History of Interpretation and a Commentary\"</a> cites the grandson of Rashi, Rabbi Yaakov ben Meir Tam, also known as the Rabbeinu Tam. The Rabbeinu Tam explains that the reason why Job's wife said (v.9) \"curse G-d and die\", means that his wife wanted Job to die, by cursing G-d, by seeing her husband suffer so deeply <em>(original source needed)</em>.\nThe author also cites the Ramban, Nachmanides in connection to Job 3:1.</p>\n<p>In the same book, the author mentions a Midrash Rabbah (will add it in later...) that connects Job's wife to Chava. Just like Satan tempted Adam through his wife Chava, soo to Satan tempted Job with his wife.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: there is a Midrashic approach that explain that although it might seem that Job's wife was \"influenced by evil\", the deeper reason was that Job's wife wanted to end the suffering of her husband. Job lost everything that he had. Why suffer longer? Rather, \"curse G-d and die\" said his wife.</p>\n\n\n",

We speak about richness when we have a lot of money, but we can also speak about richnesss when we are wealthy in other things, especially when we talk about richness in Torah.</p>\n<p>As Rashi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Proverbs.10.15.1?ven=Proverbs,_English_translation_by_A._Cohen,_Soncino_Press,_1945&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The wealth of the rich in Torah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Vayikra.5.6.2?ven=Torah_Commentary_by_Rabbi_Bachya_ben_Asher,_trans._Eliyahu_Munk,_1998.&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bahya</a>, in his commentary on Vayikra 5:6 explains the difference between rich and poor people, in bringing offers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Torah distinguishes between the rich, the poor, and the destitute. The former has to bring a sheep or goat, the person who is poor brings either two pigeons or two turtle-doves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the Torah needs a rich person to bring a sheep or goat (to offer). To me, it seems that having a lot of sheep can tell us that a person is rich. The posuk describes Job as having many cattle, hence being rich.</p>\n<p>This brings us back to the commentary of the <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/639946/p/38/t/0.51243273814714631234/fs/Jop6rDMydq51pAVa5lNKJB0GPqq5zwEbQFGWW8fnft6b/start/105/end/112/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Alshich</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A second fundamental teaching can be learned from these verses. There are two types of wealthy people. Some have material riches and an abundance of possesions. Others are rich in Torah and good deeds, but live frugally, for they have meager funds. [...] Iyyov was rich in both senses of the term. He was rich in character, for he was <em>wholehearted</em> and <em>upright</em>. He was also wealthy materially - as we see from verse 3 - and lacked nothing. Scripturem however, employs the word וְהָיָ֣ה with reference to his righteousness alone (v. 1), as only when one is occupied with Torah and mitzvos, can one experience true joy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So maybe, the reason why the Torah leaves out the description that Job had a lot of money, I think the Torah teaches us the lesson that Job was rich in other ways.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the Metzudos Dovid, who says that he was rich in having many assets:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גדול. בעושר ובנכסים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Geometrically, from any point A toward point B, the are only two valid directions, with 180 degrees between them, unless you stand exactly on the opposite pole of the sphere (eg point A on the north pole, point b on the south pole). Just use the shortest path so your prayer will get to its destination ASAP :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Firstly, prayer in any direction is accepted. If you mistakenly don’t face East, it’s not the end of the world.</p>\n<p>Second, we face Jerusalem through the shortest distance possible. If you’re in New York, you face East (yes, you can technically face west and be facing Jerusalem, but it’s a much greater distance than facing East so therefore we face East)</p>\n\n\n",

You have not interrupted your stay in the sukkah.  Now it's the second night.  Do you say the bracha again?</p>\n<p>My assumption was that you do make a new bracha.  From the point of view of sefeika deyoma, yesterday was not Sukkos and there was no mitzva to sit in the sukkah.

At first I thought maybe he was talking about Shabbos Chol Hamoed, but he explicitly says he's talking about the second night of Yom Tov.  The point comes up tangentially to the main topic of the teshuva and so he doesn't elaborate on his reasoning.</p>\n<p>Does anyone address my argument (either to explain why it's wrong or to disagree with R' Moshe)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Kovetz halachos (Rav Shmuel Kamenetsky) says like you that 2nd day night you make a new bracha because by sfaika diyoma we look at it as if yesterday wasn't yom tov.\nIve seen the ashrei ish that brings Rav Elyashev who said on this case you wont make a new bracha, but says however the Or Sameach implies you do. It doesn't bring an explanation in his psak. However the haga there said to look in the Chashukei Chemed (Rav Yitschak Zilberstein) on meseches sukka who discusses all the tzadim.</p>\n<p>The Chashukei Chemed quotes in Rav Elyashiv's name that you don't say a new bracha because of ספק ברכות להקל.  Chazal established that you should say kiddush and shehecheyanu again, but we don't extrapolate.  This applied even when Yom Tov Sheini was a real safek.  The Shevet Halevi says it a bit differently and implies that they would have said a bracha, but now that we have a fixed calendar we wouldn't anymore, because again we don't extrapolate from kiddush and shehecheyanu.</p>\n<p>The Or Sameach brings a complicated limud from the Gemara in Sukkah that I can't reproduce here and comes out that you do say a bracha.</p>\n<p>Finally the Chashukei Chemed quotes R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach who says that \"יתכן\" you would say a bracha, and then, adding in the Ta\"z who says that you make a bracha on each new meal (which we don't usually hold like), comes out that it would be ok to say a new bracha.</p>\n\n\n",

This ruling is explicitly stated in the Torah, as it says, \"Yet they are the very ones who, at the bidding of Balaam, induced the Israelites to trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor...and also slay every woman who has known a man carnally.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the discussion <a href=\"https://malimaalah.wixsite.com/offthederechthoughts/amp/the-raped-child-the-halacha-to-kill-a-non-jewish-rape-victim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>After reading the link I was wondering if this is accurate why not just excommunicate a non-Jew but kill them?</p>\n<p>Can anyone explain how this is justified, G-d is all loving but this doesn’t seem like it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Not all versions of the Rambam actually have that halacha but we will put that aside because many sources do discuss it. Nowhere does the Rambam say that he is referring to a rape victim. The source it is based on  (milchomes midyan) was not a case of rape but rather a case of seduction. As I recall only one of the commentaries on the Rambam (written less than a hundred years ago)  even considers that as a possibility. Even  he comes to the conclusion that the Rambam was not referring to such a case.</p>\n<p>As far as why not just excommunicate the non-Jew. Would that have any effect? Many of the later commentators say that the Rambam is not referring to a case of a  Ger Toshev who accepts the authority of Torah and practices Noahide laws . Someone living in Eretz Yisroel, under Jewish rule, when the Beis Hamkdash was standing (the only time this law could have been carried out) and still refuses to  be a Ger Toshev probably wouldn't be impressed with anything other than the knowledge of a law on the books that such behavior could be a capital crime.</p>\n<p>The guy in the discussion is badly misquoting both the Igros Moshe and the Minchas Chinuch (as well as butchering and distorting  MANY  other halachos. Someone who raped a child would receive makkas mardos which is given without prior warning,  see the Ran, in his commentary on the Rif on Kesubos (16b in Old Rif pages)etc. etc. etc.</p>\n<p>The guy correctly understands the Igros Moshe as saying the reason the women is killed is due to kanoim pogin bo but he badly distorts both what Rav Moshe says about this case  and the general halachos involved in kanoim pogin bo. Firstly unlike this guy's fantasy scenario Beis Din never gets personally involved in a case where someone is killed due to kanoim pogin bo. Not only that  if someone were to ask in Beis Din if they should kill the people involved they would be told NOT to. Thirdly kanoim pogin bo is not a blanket hetter for anyone to kill someone engaged in such behavior. It is limited to someone who has the status of a \"kanoi\" It also would require a situation where the act was done publicly in front of ten people (Rav Moshe is uncertain that applies here) . Nowhere does Rav Moshe imply he was discussing a case of rape.</p>\n<p>He distorts  the Minchas Chinuch even worse because the Minchas Chinuch pretty clearly says this would NOT refer to a case of rape. The Minchas Chinuch ends by saying that must be according to  the opinion of the Rambam that a child has the mental capacity agree to sexual relation (without it being considered rape)</p>\n<p>The Gemora Kesubos and elsewhere says that seducing a child is in the category of rape. Many commentators ask on the Rambam how he can say otherwise. The standard answer is that it is a sexual act in relation to general laws that the act affects but not in relation to the personal liability of the child.</p>\n<p>Furthermore in general   the concept “child” is misleading for the unlearned audience the guy in the link is writing for. It is true that by non-Jews there is no concept of being Bar – Bas Mitzvah. Therefore age is not a factor in Beis Din. What IS a factor is maturity and consciousness of wrong doing. A non-Jewish child brought to Beis Din who was too young to understand that what they were doing is wrong would not be held responsible for their behavior.</p>\n<p>There is much more to be said on this topic but it is beyond the scope of a stack exchange answer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I have no idea who wrote that or why, but it's ridiculous.

    "content": "# What is a solid mehalech for learning halacha, without learning the sugyas inside the Gemara?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have been learning in a yeshiva/kollel in EY for 5 years. I am a BT so I didn't grow up learning, and BH I have been zocheh to gain a lot of clarity and a depth of understanding in learning sugyos in Shas. However I have found it difficult to get anywhere in terms of halacha. Learning MB does not work for me. I find that since I didn't learn the sugyas, I pashut cannot remember anything, and even halachos that I learned a bunch of times I simply do not know the basics. Too many random details without yesodos/klallim/sources for me to get any real tefisa.</p>\n<p>I did have some hatzlachah with Aruch HaShulchan, it was just time consuming and he doesn't discuss every halachah, so you would for sure have to also learn MB or at least the SA itself in order to have a complete picture.</p>\n<p>I found the sefer Orchos Shabbos to be very good for hilchos Shabbos - he brings the sugyas and the basic Rishonim before the brings all of the halachos.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for me? I am thinking of trying to do all of the Aruch HaShulchan, supplemented with MB (as I wrote above) but I always want to hear from others if this is a mehalech.</p>\n<p>Also I understand that this is probably just b'etzem a problem when it comes to learning halachah without learning the sugyos. And I will speak this out with my Rebbeim - just they are more or less of a certain shita and I am pretty sure they hold that MB is the way to go. It just hasn't been working for me for the period of time I have been learning.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the help</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mishna Achrona from Dovid Lichtenstein is very good for bringing down the basic gemara and rishonim, and it also brings the later poskim when they have what to say. So far he has only put out chalakim א, ג, and ו, but they are really good, especially if you want to stick to Mishna Brura. (It's also dirt cheap because Lichtenstein is a billionaire and subsidized his seforim).</p>\n<p>But a more classic option could be Tur with Beis Yosef, the Beis Yosef always brings down the relevant gemara and the major rishonim. I personally own the Mechon HaMeor edition of the Tur, which has truly incredible footnotes which bring down lots of information from the broader sugya.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you can also consider the Chayei Adam if you're learning Orach Chayim (or Chochmas Adam for Yoreh De'ah, same author) who is perhaps clearer than the mishna brura and it is shorter than the Aruch Hashulchan.</p>\n<p>I would add that the Piskei Teshuvos is a phenomenal sefer for filling in gaps in yediyos klaliyos. He is my go-to when I want a quick way to get the basics before diving in to a siman. This is besides all of the pratim he discusses within the siman. Often He will include in the beginning of a siman important information, kind of like what the Mishna Brura does himself sometimes, but the Piskei Teshuvos does it more often and much clearer (the mishna brura in general is not a very clear sefer).</p>\n<p>My personal seforim stack when I'm learning Orach Chayim is a Tur, Mishna Brura, Aruch Hashulchan, and sometimes a Piskei Teshuvos or Mishna Achrona.</p>\n\n\n",

These additional words were\ndistributed between the various stones so that, for instance, the\nstone אודם with the name Reuven had an additional letter א as part of\nthe name אברהם, whereas the stone פטדה which had the name שמעון\ninscribed on it also had a letter ב added as the second letter in the\nname אברהם, and so on. A stone with a short name such as גד, for\ninstance, had the word שבטי of שבטי ישורון added seeing that there was\nenough space for this. The stone with the name אשר had in addition the\nletters ישר of the word ישורון inscribed on it, whereas the stone with\nthe name יוסף had the last three letters of the word ישורון inscribed\non it also, so that each stone had a total of six letters making an\noverall total of 72 letters. These 72 letters corresponded to the\ngreat name of the tetragram when it is spelled in all its 24\npermutations. The six days of creation comprised a total of 72 hours\nof daylight, the number of hours during which the universe and all\nthat is in was created (no creation took place at night.). We know\nthis as the Torah speaks of ביום עשות ה' אלו-הים ארץ ושמים (Genesis\n2,4), “on the ‘day’ Lord G’d made earth and heaven.” This number 72\nhas also been alluded to in Psalms 89,3 where David speaks about the\nworld having been built on the attribute חסד, loving kindness. The\nnumerical value of the word חסד is also 72. We infer from these verses\nthat the world which has been created in 72 hours of creative activity\nby G’d is maintained due to the merit of the twelve tribes of Israel,\ni.e. the 72 letters inscribed in the breastplate of the high Priest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, Reuven's name was inscribed on a stone called אודם - Odem.</p>\n<p>Shimeon's name was inscribed on a stone called פטדה- Pitdah (a greenish-looking gemstone, similar to the turquoise colour of the sea in certain coastal cities).

Also the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Emden\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yaabetz (Rabbi Jacob Emden)</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Hirsch_Chajes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharatz Hayot (Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Chajes)</a> both write that the commentary is not from Rashi.</p>\n<p>Rabi <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadok_HaKohen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzadok HaKohen from Lublin</a> in his responsa Tiferet Tzvi (part 2, 21:3) writes that the commentary in massechet Nedarim is from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershom_ben_Judah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabenu Guershom</a> or at least was taken from his commentary [fun fact: from pages 22b to 25b the commentary is for sure from Rabenu Guershom, as is written explicitly in the Rashi section].</p>\n<p>Also, some rishonim indeed quote Rashi in massechet Nedarim, that suggests that Rashi indeed wrote some commentary for Nedarim and, in fact, some parts of Rashi commentary in massechet Nedarim were copied by Rabenu Betzalel Ashkenazi in his notes of massechet Nedarim and on his book Shitat Mekubetzet.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Pru vRvu - is it for all time?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Genesis 1, Humans are given a blessing to procreate and multiply, to fill the Earth and subdue it. This is traditionally interpreted as the first commandment G-d gave to humans.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Main question: if this is in fact a commandment, then does it still apply after humanity has spread all around the Earth, and could have been said to have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">subdued it to such an extent that animal species are going extinct faster than ever</a>? This has serious implications now that we have 9 billion people, because if the population of the world were to decline, humanity would face much smaller issues with resource depletion, overfishing, garbage, pollution, climate change, and so on. At some point, is the size of the population allowed to go backwards, and can people on the Earth (Noahides especially) start using birth control methods?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>From where do we get that one must have at least two children, or even child one of each sex?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Also, why is the commandment considered to be given only to men? Is it because in Genesis 2, man was created first? But in Genesis 1, where this blessing appears, we just read that both male and female were created. So wouldn't the commandment apply to both equally?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<ol>\n<li>Yes. It does still apply.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A good starting point is the first mitzvah detailed in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.1.1?vhe=Sefer_HaChinukh_--_Torat_Emet&lang=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Sefer HaChinuch</strong></a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משרשי מצוה זו, כדי שיהיה העולם מישב (גיטין מא, ב במשנה), שהשם ברוך הוא חפץ בישובו, כדכתיב: (ישעיהו מה יח) לא תהו בראה לשבת יצרה. והיא מצוה גדולה שבסבתה מתקימות כל המצות בעולם, כי לבני אדם נתנו ולא למלאכי השרת (ברכות כה, ב).</p>\n<p>It is from the roots of this commandment (i.e the reason behind this commandment) that the world should be settled (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.41b.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gittin 41b</a>) because God wants the world to be settled, as it says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.45.18?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Isaiah 45:18</a>), \"I did not create it for naught, but [rather] formed it for habitation.\" This is a great commandment, through which all the commandments are observed, as [the Torah] was given to people and not to the ministering angels (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.25b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachos 25b</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, this command is predicated on a Divine will to populate Hashem’s world. The Torah was given directly to mankind and so G-d needs there to be people to fulfil its precepts.</p>\n<p>It therefore follows that raising children is to be regarded as one of the greatest blessings that G-d can bestow upon us, something that the <strong>Shelah Hakadosh</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Shaar_HaOtiyot%2C_Derech_Eretz.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shaar Osios, Derech Eretz 23</a>) refers to as “an essential and major principle”.</p>\n<p>Indeed, <strong>Rambam</strong> goes as far to say that one should strive to have as many children as they can, since each new child is like building a whole world! He writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Marriage.15.16?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Hilchos Ishus 15:16</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁקִּיֵּם אָדָם מִצְוַת פְּרִיָּה וּרְבִיָּה הֲרֵי הוּא מְצֻוֶּה מִדִּבְרֵי סוֹפְרִים שֶׁלֹּא יִבָּטֵל מִלִּפְרוֹת וְלִרְבּוֹת כָּל זְמַן שֶׁיֵּשׁ בּוֹ כֹּחַ. שֶׁכָּל הַמּוֹסִיף נֶפֶשׁ אַחַת בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל כְּאִלּוּ בָּנָה עוֹלָם</p>\n<p>Although a man has fulfilled the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying, he is bound by a Rabbinic commandment not to refrain from being fruitful and multiplying as long as he is physically potent. For anyone who adds a soul to the Jewish people is considered as if he built an entire world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[Please note I will not discuss the topic of birth control as it is beyond the scope of this answer and requires the advice of a LOR for each individual case.]</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The starting source is a mishnah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.61b.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevamos 61b</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>מַתְנִי׳</strong> לֹא יִבָּטֵל אָדָם מִפְּרִיָּה וּרְבִיָּה אֶלָּא אִם כֵּן יֵשׁ לוֹ בָּנִים. בֵּית שַׁמַּאי אוֹמְרִים: שְׁנֵי זְכָרִים, וּבֵית הִלֵּל אוֹמְרִים: זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה בְּרָאָם״.</p>\n<p>MISHNA: A man may not neglect the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply unless he already has children. Beit Shammai say: One fulfills this mitzva with two males, and Beit Hillel say: A male and a female, as it is stated: “Male and female He created them” (Genesis 5:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>As far as why it is the man's command is due to several reasons. A good rundown of the reasons can be found <a href=\"https://dinonline.org/2015/10/05/the-first-mitzvah-peru-urvu/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Gemara famously in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.65b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Yevamos 65b</strong></a> mentions that the reason why the command lies with the man is because:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי אִילְעָא מִשּׁוּם רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בְּרַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן: אָמַר קְרָא: ״וּמִלְאוּ אֶת הָאָרֶץ וְכִבְשׁוּהָ״. <strong>אִישׁ דַּרְכּוֹ לְכַבֵּשׁ, וְאֵין אִשָּׁה דַּרְכָּהּ לְכַבֵּשׁ</strong>.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Ile’a said in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: The verse states: “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the land and conquer it” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.28?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 1:28</a>). <strong>It is the manner of a man to conquer and it is not the manner of a woman to conquer</strong>. Consequently, it is evident that the entire command, including the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply, was given only to men and not to women. (Sefaria translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When referring to the mishnah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yevamot.6.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Yevamos 6:6</strong></a> which details the debate as to who the obligation lies with. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yevamot.6.6?lang=bi&p2=Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Yevamot.6.6.5&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Bartenura</strong>'s</a> comment helps shed some light on the remark of the Gemara:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>האיש מצווה על פריה ורביה ולא האשה – as it is written (Genesis 1:28): “Be fertile and increase, [fill the earth] and master it,” and [the word] \"כבשה\" is written without a “VAV.” It is the way for a man to conquer the woman; he is commanded on “being fertile and increase.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To put it differently, since the man plays the \"dominant\" role in the act of intimacy it is specifically his command. Since the women has less control in the matter it is accordingly beyond her remit.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.28?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Torah_Temimah_on_Torah%2C_Genesis.1.28.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Torah Temimah</strong></a> in his commentary on Bereishis 1:28 largely rejects this approach and looks at it from a more wholesale perspective. Much like what we said in answer 1, the whole point of the command of peru urevu is to populate the world. Settling the world with war and conflict is an innately male role, a position that is against the natural instincts of a woman. The author writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rejecting this approach, the Torah Temimah (commentary to Bereishis 1:28) argues that the mitzvah to procreate is part of the larger mandate to conquer and settle the earth (we can add that man is charged with raising the world to the elevation that humanity can bring it), and procreation is essential for achieving this. An exemption from conquering the earth, which does not fit with the female nature, entails an exemption from settling and filling it through childbirth – for the two go together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, a third perspective is that of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Meshekh_Chokhmah%2C_Noakh.19?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meshech Chochmah</a></strong> who remarks on the following verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.9.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereishis 9:7</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאַתֶּ֖ם פְּר֣וּ וּרְב֑וּ שִׁרְצ֥וּ בָאָ֖רֶץ וּרְבוּ־בָֽהּ</p>\n<p>Be fertile, then, and increase; abound on the earth and increase on it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Says the Meshech Chochmah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Be fruitful and multiply, etc.\" It is not far-fetched to say that the reason the Torah exempted women from the mitzvah of Pru U'Rvu and obligated only men is because the laws of Hashem and His ways \"...are pleasant and all of his paths peaceful\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.3.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishlei 3:17</a>) and he did not amass on a Jewish person what the body cannot tolerate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to this approach, women would be obligated in the mitzvah but due to the risk involved in childbirth, women are exempt from the obligation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Also there in Bereishis, mankind is given a separate commandment to take care of the earth and protect it.</p>\n<p>Logically, the spread of mankind is not synonymous with the depletion of resources and the extinction of species. The latter is more of the result of mismanagement of resources and, perhaps more often, outright exploitation of them.</p>\n<p>It's mankind's abuse of the earth, not necessarily the inhabitance of it, that's the problem. Even if the population growth was reduced, those environmental problems could very well still be present.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As for your main concerns I think the above answers are satisfactory, however you seem to lack a basic understanding of why we must give birth to children.</p>\n<p>The world was created for Adam and Eve, and that was gonna be it, there was no need for them to have children since they were going to live forever. After they sinned, and brought death to the world, they needed to have children in order that the world should always be populated. When the Messiah comes, and the sin of Adam will be rectified, since there will be no death in the world anymore, there will be no reason to reproduce (Arukh HaShulchan YD 246:45, OC 34:9, 426:1).</p>\n<p>I hope this gave you a better insight into 'why we do what we do'.</p>\n\n\n",

One might have thought that since someone who is <em>mitzta'er</em> (in pain) is exempt from the mitzvah, that an <em>avel</em>, due to his emotional pain, would also be exempt.</p>\n<p>The Gemara concludes that, since his worries are \"<em>divrei reshus</em>\" (not obligatory, in contrast to someone who is worried about performing a mitzvah properly), that he should be able to take his mind off it -- achieve <em>yishuv ha'daas</em> -- and focus on the mitzvah of sukkah.</p>\n<p>I've looked around in some standard commentaries of aggadah hoping to find details about how a person should actually accomplish this <em>yishuv ha'daas</em>. I've looked in the commentaries of the Ein Yaakov, in B'Nei Yehoyada, and the Maharal.

It is a comprehensive work written during World War 2, by Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Rabbi Berkovits <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/What_is_the_Talmud%2C_I_What_is_the_Talmud%3F%2C_1_Bible_and_Talmud.5?lang=bi&with=About&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> the need for an explanation on the written Torah:</strong></em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All written material requires a commentary. The first reader is always also the first commentator. The Bible is the written teachings (the so-called Written Law, or Torah Shebichtav) of Judaism — the Book as compendium. That is why it is inconceivable without commentary. Like any teachings, it must also be explained, and as everywhere, in the case of the Bible as well, explanation begins with reading. To read the Bible is always to explain the Bible. However, to explain the Bible means to study the Bible. The process of studying and its outcome are designated by tradition in the language of the Bible by the word Talmud. (Lamod = Heb. learn; “Talmud” is an abbreviation of Talmud-Torah study of the Torah.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Irrespective of the way that the Bible is read, the reader will always encounter major difficulties in it. “Questions” will be asked. Asking questions is the dynamic strength of the Talmud. It is an integral part of the text. The Bible is text — but above all, it is teachings (Torah); yet answers are part of teachings. The provider of the text left questions unresolved. The provider of the Teachings must also have provided the answers. <strong>The Talmud consists of question and answer.</strong> From all of this it follows: The Jewish people received the Talmud together with the Bible. Written and oral teachings cannot be separated from each other. Both come from the same source. The Talmud is as old as the Bible itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since the Torah wished to be taught and put into effect, it always needed the “oral” supplement. When Moses first read and taught the Bible, the history of the Oral Teachings began. This is the reason why the Sages say: “Moses received the Torah on Mount Sinai and handed it down…” (Avot 1:1) The handing down of the text from master to student involves the teaching of its correct reading — commentary in the broadest sense of the word. Such “transmission” is “Oral Law.” It was in this sense that the Talmud was originally called: “masoret me-ha-Avot” — handing down or transmission from the Fathers. But what the Fathers handed down is “Kabbalah — that which is received” for the children. (Not to be confused with the later meaning of this word, which generally denotes Jewish mysticism.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In \"Essay on Fundamentals\" chapter 10, The Ramchal, Moshe Chaim Luzzatto explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Behold the Master, blessed be He, did not want to write the Torah with sufficient clarity, such that it would not need explanation. Just the opposite, He wrote many things in it that are very unclear, such that it would not have been possible for anyone in the world to understand their true intention without His giving over the explantation through the tradition that came from Him, may He be blessed - the author of the [Torah's written] words. By way of example, the commandment of tefillin, mezuzah and that which is similar to them - the command came about them [more generally], but their properties are not clarified in that which is written. However the truth is that it was with specific intent that the Master, blessed be He, hid the true intention of His words, for reasons known to Him. Nevertheless, what He hid in the written Torah, He surely gave over orally to our teacher, Moses, peace be upon him. And the tradition continued from him to the sages, generation after generation. And see that the true intention of Scripture is clarified through this tradition. So the true performance of the commandments as the Master, blessed be He, wanted them is known to us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramchal then goes on to explain that the correspondence of the words of the written Torah to the traditional explanation is divided into three sections:</p>\n<p><strong>The first section:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the group of things that are found in their generalizations in\nScripture - but without their specifics - and their specifics are\nclarified in the tradition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The second section:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the group of written passages in which the understanding is unclear -\nin that they can bear different explanations - and its clarification\nis determined by the tradition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The third section:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the group of written passages in which - according to the words - it would truly have one intention, but the tradition clarifies that the desired [understanding] is quite different from that which appears. And about this, [the Sages], may their memory be blessed, said (Sotah 16a), \"The law (halakha) circumvents Scripture.\" However there are not many items in this group. Moreover, if you exert yourself and deepen the matter, you will find that the simple reading does not totally contradict the law and that it is not counter to it. Rather, it can be understood from a certain perspective and within certain limits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You further ask</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Is all of the Talmud just explanation of things in the Tanakh?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are two things here, the written Torah and the oral Torah. The written Torah is, well, the name says it all, the Torah as Hashem gave it to us. However, G-d says \"This month is to be the beginning of months for you\" (Shemos 12:2). What month is that? The Torah does not explain that, so how are we meant to know the \"fine details\"? To this, the oral Torah comes to rescue. The oral Torah is the tradition that came from Moshe from Sinai, and is passed down from father to son, for a few thousand generations now.</p>\n<p>The Talmud asks: What was the order of teaching the Oral Law? How was the Oral Law first taught? (Eruvin 54b) and goes on to explain the order:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moses learned directly from the mouth of the Almighty. Aaron entered\nand sat before him, and Moses taught him his lesson as he had learned\nit from God. Aaron moved aside and sat to the left of Moses. Aaron’s\nsons entered, and Moses taught them their lesson while Aaron listened.\nAaron’s sons moved aside; Elazar sat to the right of Moses and Itamar\nsat to the left of Aaron. Rabbi Yehuda disagreed with the first tanna\nwith regard to the seating arrangements and said: Actually, Aaron\nwould return to sit to the right of Moses. The elders entered and\nMoses taught them their lesson. The elders moved aside, and the entire\nnation entered and Moses taught them their lesson.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This oral tradition, is transmitted oraly, from father to son. However, there was a time, were a certain Rabbi, named Yehuda Hanasi (Rabbi Judah the Prince) saw it fitting to write the tradition down. This is the <em>Mishnah</em>.</p>\n<p>Over the past years, many Rabbi's studied the Mishnah and interpreted verses. This formed the Talmud as we know. As Rabbi Steinsaltz <a href=\"https://steinsaltz.org/talmud/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over the course of the next 300 years, scholars pored over the Mishna\nand expounded upon it. The Gemara (also called Talmud in the more\nrestricted sense of the term) is a compilation of their debates and\ncommentaries on the Mishna.</p>\n<p>The discussions of the sages from Palestine are contained in the\nJerusalem Talmud, which was edited by the disciples of Rabbi Yohanan\nin Tiberias in the 4th century C.E. Its Diaspora counterpart, the\nBabylonian Talmud, was compiled by Rav Ashi and Ravina in the 5th\ncentury C.E and is considered to be more extensive and authoritative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3347866/jewish/What-Is-the-Talmud-Definition-and-Comprehensive-Guide.htm#Why\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article by Rabbi Yehudah Shurpin from Chabad.org</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As anyone who has learned the Bible can attest, there are certain\nverses where there is no way of knowing what it refers to by just\nlooking at the verse. Examples include the commandment to circumcise\noneself, or to put tefillin on the arm and head, or to take the four\nspecies on the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.</p>\n<p>There is no way of knowing from the verses alone what exactly are we\nsupposed to cut when we make a circumcision, or how to put on\ntefillin, or even what it is. The same holds true for almost all other\ncommandments. More details are given in the Written Torah for some\ncommandments than for others, but at the end of the day, there is a\nglaring lack of detail and information.</p>\n<p>This is where the Oral Torah comes in. It is an “owner’s manual” and\n“companion guide” (so to speak) for the Torah. With it we can\nunderstand what the Torah means, and determine the details of the\nvarious commandments. Furthermore, we have rules of exegesis so that\nwe can determine the Torah’s view on various issues that are not\ndirectly addressed. The Oral Torah comprises traditions and\nextrapolations based on the inscribed Torah, the Bible.</p>\n<p>Just before the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai, G‑d tells Moses\nthat He will give him “the stone tablets, the Torah and the\ncommandments.\"1 By adding the word “commandments” in addition to the\nTorah, G‑d implies that there commandments that are not included in\nthe “Torah.” This, among others, is a clear implication of the\nexistence of the Oral Torah.</p>\n<p>The Torah itself commands us to keep the Oral Torah:</p>\n<p>You shall do according to the word they tell you, from the place the\nL‑rd will choose, and you shall observe to do according to all they\ninstruct you. According to the law they instruct you and according to\nthe judgment they say to you, you shall do; you shall not diverge from\nthe word they tell you, either right or left.2</p>\n<p>The traditions of the Oral Torah were passed down from generation to\ngeneration, from Moses to Joshua, and from there down to the leaders\nand sages of each generation,3 until eventually, after the destruction\nof the Second Temple, they were written down in what is known as the\nMishnah, Talmud Bavli (Babylonian Talmud) and Talmud Yerushalmi\n(Jerusalem Talmud).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Concerning your first question, \"Does the Talmud have things that are not laws like stories of prophets\"- There's the concept of \"Talmudic Aggadah\" - אַגָּדָה‎.</p>\n<p>Concerning Aggadah, there's a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggadah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia-article</a> citing the Ramchal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (1707-1746), discusses this two-tiered, literal-allegorical mode of transmission of the Aggadah in his well-known Discourse on the Haggadot. He explains that the Oral Law, in fact, comprises two components: the legal component (חלק המצוות‎), discussing the mitzvot and halakha; and \"the secret\" component (חלק הסודות‎), discussing the deeper teachings. The Aggadah, along with the Kabbalah, falls under the latter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can say that Aggadah can be specified as \"a tale\", as the Talmud in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.75a.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 75a</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Others say: It was called coriander [gad] because it is similar to a tale [haggada], which draws a person’s heart toward it, just like water, which is essential for life, draws one</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Somewhere else in the Talmud <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.92a.14?lang=bi&lookup=Rabbi%20Abba%20said%20to%20Rabbi%20Yirmeya%20bar%20Abba%3A%20When%20Rav%20interpreted%20these%20verses%20homiletically%20he%20interpreted%20them%20according%20to%20the%20way%20in%20which%20you%20have%20interpreted%20them%2C%20and%20not%20according%20to%20any%20of%20the%20other%20opinions%20cited%20above.&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Chullin 92a)</a>, Aggadah is described as an explanation in homiletically form:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Abba said to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba: When Rav interpreted these verses homiletically he interpreted them according to the way in which you have interpreted them, and not according to any of the other opinions cited above.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Yes, Talmud has a wealth of content, which is mainly divided into halacha, which is the study of law, and aggadata, which is a body of teachings through anecdote and parable, similar to midrash.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Talmud is the notes of the discussions that the Amoraim had about the Mishna. The purpose of those discussions was to clarify ambiguities, fill in gaps, resolve disputes as well as impart the general Torah wisdom of the Amoraim to future generations. All of this is somehow rooted in either the Written or Oral Torah, so it's not always (directly at least), a commentary on the Written Torah (Tanach)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

See: <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/189420/p/135/t/4372598311234/fs/6Z0IME6YNpehy7ZXu8jFT1MHyvaGVOWsfvfKlVSh9YBV/start/1813/end/1827/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"אור דוד</a>\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>או אחרת מעלה עליו הכתוב כאילו עשאה וכן אמרו חז\"ל הלומד זבחים ומנחות או האומר סדר הקרבנות מעלה עליו הכתוב כאילו הקריבן וכן אמרו מחשבה טובה הקדוש ברוך הוא מצרפה למעשה כל שכן אם זו לא רק מחשבה אלא גם הבעה של צער על חוסר האפשרות לקיימה הרי בודאי שהקדוש ברוך הוא מחשיב גם את המחשבה וגם את הרצון למעשה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are different mitzvot in Eretz Yisrael, the author of Or David writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש מצוות השייכות למלך ויש לכהנים ויש לבכורים וכו'\nThere are mitzvot that belong to the king, priests and firstborns</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, when Moshe Rabbeinu asked G-d to fulfill (all) those mitzvot, G-d saw that Moshe Rabbeinu really wanted to fulfill them all, and to this applies the statement of the Or David. Namely, that in this case, scripture raises this person as if he fulfilled them all.</p>\n<p>Taken from my answere at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/129868/27180\">this</a> post.</p>\n\n\n",

In other words, is it the pursuit of answers to questions in one’s heart, however conscious those questions may be?</p>\n<p>I know <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Daniel.2.21?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel 2:21</a> says that HKBH gives chokhmah to the chacham. Does that imply that chokhmah leads to questions which leads to inquiry (and more questions)? Is chokhmah gained from pursuing answers to questions, however small or quiet they may be in one’s heart?</p>\n<p>Many thanks for your time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Hi @Tom like @NT mentioned it is all about context and depending on that context can have varied meanings...</p>\n<p>Let's start with understanding the verse in Daniel 2:21.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Yosef_David_Azulai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chida</a> writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chomat_Anakh_on_Daniel.2.21.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chomas Anach</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יהב חכמתא לחכימין וכו' הוא גלה עמיקתא וכו'. אפשר דבאומרו יהיב חכמתא לחכימין אפשר להבין דכונתו דהוא חכם ועל כן נתן לו חכמה לזה אמר הוא גלה עמיקתא וכו' כלומר מה שאדם מבין מדעתו הוא חכמה ועל זה אמרתי יהיב חכמתא וכו' אבל זה אינו חכמה שהבנתי מדעתי רק גלוי סוד וזה אפשר על ידי מי שאינו חכם שכך רצה הקב\"ה וברוך שם כבודו אשר גלה סודו כן יתן לידידו כי לעולם חסד</p>\n<p>He gives the wise their wisdom...He reveals deep and hidden things - When it says, \"He gives the wise their wisdom\" - it is possible to understand that he is wise and therefore He (G-d) gave him wisdom and that is why it goes on to say, \"He reveals deep and hidden things\". That is, what a person understands from his mind is wisdom and that it is why it says, \"He gives wisdom\". But this is not \"wisdom\" how I understand it from my knowledge - rather it is a revelation of a secret / (deep unknown concept) and this is possible by someone who is not wise, that is how the Almighty willed it, and blessed be the name of His glory, whosoever discovers His secret will also give it to his friend, for mercy is forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Chida, wisdom in this context does not necessarily have to be something that an intellectual person is imbued with. It can refer also to someone who has been blessed with a Divine insight and is not intelligence-based.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, wisdom is Divine gift and the greatest present that mankind is blessed with. The famed work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahya_ibn_Paquda\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bacheya</a> - Chovos Halevavos, in the introduction (which brings this verse from Doniel) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The greatest gift which the Creator bestowed on His servants, human beings, after bringing them out to full perception and complete (mature) understanding - is wisdom, which is the life of their spirit and the candle of their intellect</strong>; It brings them to the favor of G-d and saves them from His wrath in this world and the next, as Scripture says \"for the L-ord gives wisdom: out of His mouth comes knowledge and understanding\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.2.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prov.2:6</a>); And Elihu said: \"but there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty that gives them understanding\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.32.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Job 32:8</a>); And Daniel said: \"He gives wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding\" (Daniel 2:21), and \"I am the L-ord your G-d who teaches you for your benefit, who leads you by the way that you should go\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.48.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 48:17</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, with this as an introduction, let's try providing a basic definition of the term \"chochma\".</p>\n<p>Perhaps the starting point when understanding wisdom is the verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.9.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei (Proverbs) 9:10</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תְּחִלַּ֣ת חׇ֭כְמָה יִרְאַ֣ת יְהֹוָ֑ה וְדַ֖עַת קְדֹשִׁ֣ים בִּינָֽה</p>\n<p>The beginning of wisdom is fear of the LORD,\nAnd knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the main trait that underpins wisdom is a fear of G-d. As the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.9.10?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_Proverbs.9.10.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudas Dovid</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי היראה מביאה לידי חכמה</p>\n<p>Because fear (of G-d) leads to wisdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is expressed also in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.17?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 3:17</a> (אִם אֵין חָכְמָה, אֵין יִרְאָה. אִם אֵין יִרְאָה, אֵין חָכְמָה.).</p>\n<p>So, we see wisdom and fear of G-d are a two-way street. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.17?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&p2=Rabbeinu_Yonah_on_Pirkei_Avot.3.17.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Yonah</a> on the mishnah there explains that the wisdom coupled with fear provides the direction to lead a person on the correct path, and the fear has to underpin the wisdom otherwise the wisdom does not endure.</p>\n<p>Indeed, knowing that wisdom is G-d given gift goes a long way in orienting a person's outlook.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.3.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 3:7</a> already underlined this earlier:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַל־תְּהִ֣י חָכָ֣ם בְּעֵינֶ֑יךָ יְרָ֥א אֶת־יְ֝הֹוָ֗ה וְס֣וּר מֵרָֽע</p>\n<p>Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and shun evil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Metzudat_David_on_Proverbs.3.7.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudos Dovid</a> there explains this to mean:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not be wise in your own eyes - Do not be wise in your own sight to decide that you may be lenient in the case of a forbidden act, that you do not need to impose safeguards upon yourself because a wise man like you finds them unnecessary. Rather, fear the Lord lest you stumble despite your wisdom, and turn away from evil by enacting safeguards for yourself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, whilst wisdom may represent a heightened level of knowledge, it can blind a person if not channelled in the correct way.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.14.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 14:8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חׇכְמַ֣ת עָ֭רוּם הָבִ֣ין דַּרְכּ֑וֹ וְאִוֶּ֖לֶת כְּסִילִ֣ים מִרְמָֽה</p>\n<p>It is the wisdom of a clever man to understand his course; But the stupidity of the dullard is delusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The many commentaries there help to further outline what we have discussed thus far:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Proverbs.14.8.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> - wisdom is for such a man to understand his way / weigh his paths.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Proverbs.14.8.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> - His wisdom is the means through which he can choose the correct path for him.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Metzudat_David_on_Proverbs.14.8.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudos Dovid</a> - Wisdom is the means to calculate his action and not act impulsively.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As far as how to understand this on the \"intellectual spectrum\" - it is worth noting the famous verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.31.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 31:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וָאֲמַלֵּ֥א אֹת֖וֹ ר֣וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֑ים בְּחׇכְמָ֛ה וּבִתְבוּנָ֥ה וּבְדַ֖עַת וּבְכׇל־מְלָאכָֽה</p>\n<p>I have endowed him with a divine spirit of skill, ability, and knowledge in every kind of craft;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.31.3?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Exodus.31.3.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> there singles out how to understand wisdom - i.e. that it is what a person hears from others and learns / makes his own. It is not like the other terms used there namely תבונה - something derived from one's own intellect i.e. what he already knows and דעת - something that comes from Ruach Hakodesh.</p>\n<p>Now at this juncture it is worth noting that there is a limit to wisdom. Chovos Halevavos, in the 8th chapter which explores examining one's soul, writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He said: \"Do not be overly wise\", since wisdom has a fixed limit which cannot be crossed. The explanation is that all the various branches of wisdom which lead to the service of G-d, guarding His commandments, or demonstrating His wisdom and power - this category is permitted to us, and it is our duty to investigate it, as written: \"Behold, the fear of the L-ord is wisdom\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.28.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 28:28</a>), and \"The fear of the L-ord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy ones (good deeds/traits) is understanding\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.9.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 9:10</a>), which means knowledge of G-d, and also: \"The fear of the L-ord is the beginning of wisdom\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.111.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 111:10</a>), and \"The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken; lo, they have rejected the word of the L-ord; and what wisdom is in them?\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.8.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 8:9</a>), and all that is a wisdom outside of this way we mentioned - it is forbidden to study it and investigate after it. Therefore he said: \"do not be overly wise\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To put it succinctly, we should explore the paths that will lead to a wisdom that increases our relationship with G-d and His commandments.<sup>1</sup> Exploring wisdom that run counter to G-d's path are obviously counter-intuitive and can be damaging in the long run.</p>\n<p>Finally, from an anthropomorphic perspective chochmah is regarded as more of a male trait whilst binah (understanding/intuition) is a more feminine characteristic. HaRav Tzadok HaKohen of Lublin זצ\"ל writes in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14371&st=&pgnum=43&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">דובר צדק</a> (last paragraph on page) that binah is a female trait that is rooted in the heart, whilst חכמה, wisdom, belongs to the male consciousness and stems from the brain. Quoting the זוהר he writes, \"חכמה ובינה הם אבא ואימא\" – “Wisdom and understanding – they are the father (i.e. wisdom) and the mother (i.e. understanding)”.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Refer to Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.36.1?vhe=Moreh_Nevuchim,_translated_by_Ibn_Tibon&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevuchim 3:36</a> who speaks about how we should be channelling chochmah only for good things, as that is wisdom in the truest sense:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is also evident that the precepts which exhort and command us to learn and to teach are useful; for without wisdom there cannot be any good act or any true knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

E.g. on the sixth day? It is only right before G-d planted the Garden in Eden, that man was formed. Is there a logical explanation for this?</p>\n<p>This Shabbos, I've heard a possible explanation, however, I think this might be farfetched. G-d created people on the sixth day, not only Adam HaRishon. But, G-d saw that the people were like the people in the generation of Noach. They weren't connecting with G-d. So, G-d \"formed man\", e.g. appointed a man, Adam, to be \"his rolemodel\" and \"breathed into his nostrils the breath of life\". It was only after this was done by G-d, that mankind was connected to G-d. Can this be an explanation?

But in the account of the formation of man there is no statement “that it is good,” which seems strange. For it would seem that the formation of man should be characterized as good just like the formation of animals. The reason for the omission is in order to indicate that the good that is intended in the creation of man is not the perfection of existence merely, as in the other animals, but another nobler perfection, which can be attained only when he has actualized his potentialities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are there sources that discusses this idea?

    "title": "What was Miriam's Lashon Hara?",
    "content": "# What was Miriam's Lashon Hara?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard that the problem with Miriam's Lashon Hara about Moshe was that she compared him with other prophets. With this comparation, she downgraded him, as he was a much bigger prophet and even comparing his prophecy level with theirs (Miriam and Aharon) was already an insult.</p>\n<p>So, the main point of the Lashon Hara was not that she criticized him for leaving his wife per se, but because, by doing so, she compared his prophecy level with theirs.</p>\n<p>Is this correct? If so, does anyone know where this is written?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Both reasons (the leaving the wife and comparing prophecy levels) are accurate and fit in with each other. Moshe left his wife because he reasoned that Hashem could talk to him at any moment and he didn’t want to be in a state of impurity by being married, so he divorced Tzipporah. Miriam criticized this and said “why does Moshe think he’s so great that he needs to divorce his wife? I didn’t divorce my husband and Hashem still speaks to me. Aharon didn’t divorce his wife and he speaks with Hashem all the time. Our 3 Fathers didn’t divorce their wives and they spoke constantly to Hashem…so why does Moshe think he’s so special” (btw I’m paraphrasing this from Avot D’Rabbi Natan). So as you can see, Miriam’s criticism of Moshe divorcing his wife is directly related to the idea that she thought they were all on the same prophecy level and that Moshe wasn’t unique or special (even though he was). Aharon even says that Moshe was acting with haughtiness when he divorced his wife, further supporting this notion that they weren’t happy with how Moshe insinuated to be closer than them to Hashem</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There is an argument between <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avot_D%27Rabbi_Natan.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos d'Rabbi Nathan 9:2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Bamidbar.99.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei Bamidbar 99</a> on whether Miriam spoke against Moshe or in defense of Moshe. According to R. Nathan, discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/115509/did-miriam-criticize-moshe-for-being-haughty\">here</a>, Miriam sought to belittle Moshe's behavior without him being present. Her words elicited a negative response from Aharon. That's standard Lashon haRa.</p>\n<p>Rashi chose Sifrei, which better fits with the language of the verse against opinion of R. Nathan.  Miriam was not speaking against Moshe, which in Hebrew is נגד (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.31.32?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 31:32</a>) or על (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.16.3?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 16:3</a>). She was trying to defend him, במושה (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.12.2?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 12:1</a>). As we know, Hashem gave a gift of prophesy to a new group of people in the camp. Moshe's wife Tziporah thought, that like her, the wives of the prophets would become separate from their husbands and expressed her sentiments. In attempt to defend Moshe, and the text in Sifrei states: ומה מרים, שלא נתכוונה לדבר באחיה לגנאי אלא לשבח, Miriam implicitly asked the available authority, Aharon, \"We both know that prophesy is not a barrier to marital relations... (i.e. Isn't there something wrong with Tziporah's words?)\" Unfortunately, her words implied that Moshe's prophesy was equal to Aharon's or hers, and that's why she got punished. In her situation, she should have asked Moshe directly about it to avoid <em>lashon hara</em>.

They do this in modern hebrew even though the original commentary to Rashi was written hundreds of years ago. In fact, I personally understand \"yeshivish\" or older hebrew much better, and I often understand the explenation of Rashi better by looking up the original commentary, so if you understand modern hebrew better, I can imagine this being the reverse for you. You should be able to find it very easily online or in stores. Another option may be עוז והדר's רמב\"ן המבואר, which does something kinda maybe similar. This option is much more expensive (and twice as many volumes). Another more recent work on chumash could be R' S.R.

Which naturally leads us to your remaining question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if it’s medical advice does it need to be followed today?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam in H. Deoth 4: states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל מקום שאין בו רופא--אחד הבריא ואחד החולה, אין ראוי לו לזוז מכל\nהדברים שאמרנו בפרק זה:  שכל אחד מהן, לאחרית טובה הוא מביא.</p>\n<p>Where there is no doctor available, neither the healthy nor the sick\nman should budge from all the directions given in this chapter for\neach of them ultimately brings to a beneficial result.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that the Rambam maintained that these medical prescriptions were not absolute even in his own day, and and that they ceded to the medical advice on the ground in relation to one's own health in consultation with a doctor. How much more so, where the state of medical knowledge has changed between his time and ours that these statements ought not be taken as absolutes. Furthermore, his son Rabbenu Abraham (who generally did not deviate from his father's path) taught ( <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/agadot/hagada1-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מאמר על דרשות חז\"ל</a> ):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא נתחייב מפני גודל מעלת חכמי התלמוד ותכונתם לשלמות תכונתם בפירוש\nהתורה ובדקדוקיה ויושר אמריהם בביאור כלליה ופרטיה, שנטען להם ונעמיד\nדעתם בכל אמריהם ברפואות ובחכמת הטבע והתכונה, [ולהאמין] אותן כאשר נאמין\nאותן בפירוש התורה, שתכלית חכמתה בידם, ולהם נמסרה להורותה לבני אדם,\nכעניין שנאמר \"על פי התורה אשר יורוך\" וגו'.</p>\n<p>We are not obliged, on account of the great superiority of the sages\nof the Talmud, and their expertise in their explanations of the Torah\nand its details, and the truth of their sayings in the explanation of\nits general principles and details, to defend them and uphold their\nviews in all of their sayings in medicine, in science and in\nastronomy, or to believe them [in those matters] as we believe them\nregarding the explanation of the Torah… we find that they made\nmedicinally related statements in the Gemara which have not been\njustified or validated...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Maimondean approach does not see Hazal as being inerrant in scientific/medical matters, and therefore where their medical prescriptions are found to be incompatible with the contemporary understanding, we do not follow them. This approach followed to its logical conclusion would imply that, all the more so, where the Rishonim erred in their medical understanding, basing themselves on Galen, Hippocrates, et al. we would not be bound by their medical prescriptions and rather ought defer to the contemporary understanding of medicine.</p>\n<p>To conclude, whether one ought sleep on the left or right, and whether one ought switch halfway through the night, is a medical question best answered by a modern practitioner of medicine (preferably your own doctor, familiar with your unique constitution), rather than left to the Rambam's prescription.

Once the Torah became a gift, he would rembember it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Initially, Moses would study Torah and forget it, until it was given to him as a gift, as it is stated: “And He gave it to Moses when he concluded speaking with him” (Exodus 31:18). Once the Torah was given him as a gift, it became his and he was able to remember it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are other places where the Gemara elaborates on Torah being a gift: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.5a.20?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 5a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.54a.21?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 54a</a>.</p>\n<p>Why is Torah forgotten by the one who studies it, when the Torah is not yet considered as a gift? The Gemara in Berachos says G-d gave B'nei Yisrael three precious gifts, Torah included in these three. So, G-d already gave us His Torah as a gift, why then would Moshe Rabbeinu forget his studies?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Chaim Volozhin makes a telling observation in his Ruach Chaim on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 1:1</a> (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14555&st=&pgnum=6&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>see here</strong></a>) (the left column, 7 lines up from the bottom).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכן ניתנה התורה לו במתנה (כמבוא' בנדרים לח:) \"בתחילה היה משה למד תורה ומשכח עד שניתנה לו במתנה כו'\" וכאמחז\"ל בעירובין נד ״וממדבר מתנה״, אם משים אדם עצמו כמדבר זה שהכל דשין בו ואין מקפיד כלל על כבודו התורה ניתנה לו במתנה ולכן לא היה משה שוכח שום דבר מהתורה יען שלא הקפיד על כבודו כלל ונתנה לו</p>\n<p>And therefore, the Torah was given as a gift (like it explains in Nedarim 38) \"Initially, Moshe would study Torah and forget it, until it was given to him as a gift etc.\" - and it is like Chazal said in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.54a.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eiruvin 54a</a> \"And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.21.18?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 21:18</a>). If a person makes himself (humble) like this wilderness, which is open to all and upon which everyone treads, (his Torah study will endure and be given to him as a gift [mattana])\". And since he (Moshe) was not at all particular about his honor, the Torah was given to him as a gift. And therefore, Moshe did not forget a thing because he was not particular about his own honour and so it was given to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to Rav Chaim, as per the gemara in Eiruvin, Torah is acquired through humility. I don't know if we can assume that Moshe was not humble and then acted accordingly and he then retained his Torah. However, we know that the Torah calls him the humblest person that ever lived (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.12.3?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 12:3</a>). So perhaps when he channelled this humility it made him into a more fitting receptacle, and he was thus able to remember it all as he was operating on the requisite level to receive Torah.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some further digging came up with this piece from Rabbi A. Leib Scheinbaum of Hebrew Academy of Cleveland <a href=\"https://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/peninim/archives/kisisa66.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>He begins by noting your question and strengthens it by asking why the need to spend so long on Har Sinai, if he was only to forget it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moshe Rabbeinu remained on Har Sinai for forty days and nights, while Hashem taught him the entire Torah. In the Talmud Nedarim 38a, Chazal tell us that, despite Moshe's outstanding acumen and memory, \"he learned and forgot, learned and forgot.\" In other words, he could not retain the Torah lessons that he was receiving from Hashem. In truth, this is not surprising. How could a human being comprehend the wisdom of the Creator? This troubled Moshe as he became increasingly frustrated with his inability to absorb and retain his knowledge of the Torah. In the end, Hashem gave him his Torah knowledge as a gift. We wonder why it had to be this way. Hashem knew that a yelud ishah, human being, was incapable of absorbing the entire Torah, and, ultimately, the only way he would grasp it would be as a gift. Why did Hashem make Moshe spend forty days on the mountain working at a task that was impossible and would inevitably end in failure?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He answers that since Moshe would be the teacher of klal yisroel he would have to experience the sense of toil and hard work that is needed to master Torah. In other words, the forgetting and trying again was a trait that was crucial to his role, and it was the means through which he earnt this gift:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Alshich_on_Torah%2C_Exodus.31.18.8?vhe=Torat_Moshe,_Warsaw,_1875&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Alshich HaKadosh</a> explains that Hashem selected Moshe as the one to receive and eventually transmit the Torah to Klal Yisrael. He would be the source from which future generations of Jews would learn Torah. To be worthy of this monumental privilege, Moshe would have to sustain the emotional pain and frustration of \"learning and forgetting\" the Torah that he had been taught for forty days. Horav Avraham Pam, zl, notes, as cited by Rabbi Sholom Smith, in his anthology on Chumash, that Moshe's frustration was probably exacerbated by the realization that he would only be able to transmit to Klal Yisrael that which he remembered. Whatever he forgot would be lost to eternity. Yet, Moshe persevered. His desire to absorb the eternal verities and wisdom of the Torah catalyzed him to go on, not to give up. Thus, he earned the Divine \"gift\" of the Torah.</p>\n<p>Moshe earned the privilege to be the quintessential Torah leader, relaying the Torah in its entirety, even the profound insights that every perceptive student in the future would innovate, only because he overcame his own frustration, his feelings that his efforts were nothing more than an exercise in futility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He replied that the verse states: “For that he also [beshaggam] is flesh; therefore shall his days be one hundred and twenty years” <strong>(Genesis 6:3)</strong>. The numerical value of beshaggam is the same as that of the Hebrew name Moshe, and it is known that Moses lived a total of 120 years <strong>(see Deuteronomy 34:7)</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>דעיקר הבריאה הוא משה רבנו: That the main concept or principle of the Creation is Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n<p>This is like Rashi teaches to Bereshit 1:1 explaining the meaning of the word <em>Bereshit</em> (בראשית).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בראשית ברא אֵין הַמִּקְרָא הַזֶּה אוֹמֵר אֶלָּא דָּרְשֵׁנִי, כְּמוֹ שֶׁדְּרָשׁוּהוּ רַבּוֹתֵינוּ בִּשְׁבִיל הַתּוֹרָה שֶׁנִקְרֵאת רֵאשִׁית דַּרְכּוֹ (משלי ח'), וּבִשְׁבִיל יִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁנִקְרְאוּ רֵאשִׁית תְּבוּאָתוֹ (ירמיה ב')</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That it is understood to mean: <em>For the sake of Reishit, G-d created the heavens and the earth.</em> That <em>Reishit</em> means both the Torah and Israel.</p>\n<p>And in the context of it meaning <em>Israel</em>, Moshe Rabbeinu is equated with all Israel like Rashi explains to Shemot 18:1 in the name of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta_d%27Rabbi_Yishmael.15.1.2?vhe=Mekhilta_--_Wikisource&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechilta of Rabbi Yishmael</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>למשה ולישראל. שָׁקוּל מֹשֶׁה כְּנֶגֶד כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל (מכילתא):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this context, the reason why Moshe lived in this world, soul dressed in a body, for 120 years is because of the decree of G-d found in the beginning of the Torah (Bereshit 6:3) long before Moshe Rabbeinu ever appears explicitly, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהֹוָ֗ה לֹֽא־יָד֨וֹן רוּחִ֤י בָֽאָדָם֙ לְעֹלָ֔ם בְּשַׁגַּ֖ם ה֣וּא בָשָׂ֑ר וְהָי֣וּ יָמָ֔יו מֵאָ֥ה וְעֶשְׂרִ֖ים שָׁנָֽה׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>G-d said, “My breath shall not dwell* in <em>HaAdam</em> forever, <em>in that also (meaning Moshe),</em> he is flesh; let the days allowed them be one hundred and twenty years. This indicates that the time constraint is something intrinsically related to the current state of the body which is made of flesh. It is not eternal.</p>\n<p>That like it says in Bereshit 2:7, G-d blew the <em>Living Soul</em> into the body of <em>HaAdam</em>. And in this context it is worth noting that the gematria of <em>Spitting out or vomiting out</em> (הקיא) when including the letters is also  120. This is related to the expulsion of Adam from the Garden of Eden mentioned in Bereshit 3:22-24 which occurred between his 120th and 130th year.</p>\n<p>That Gan Eden is a reference to how the written Torah (the 53 parshiyot of the written Torah) has implanted within it the entire oral Torah, which is associated with the word <em>Eden</em>. And so this too continues the association of Torah and Israel.</p>\n<p>ולכך ע״כ אז נעלם מן [העולם]: And therefore he was then <em>concealed</em> from the world.</p>\n<p>That לעלם has a dual meaning. The first being <em>concealed</em> and the second being <em>eternal</em>.</p>\n<p>The Rogatchaver is not saying Moshe died, but that he was concealed from the perspective of this world. This is the subject of the end of chapter 11 in Devarim Rabbah and the interaction between Moshe Rabbeinu, the Angel of Death and G-d.</p>\n<p>כך לעולם, כי אין בגרת בקבר ושוב הוה התורה נצחית ועומדת: Thus is the meaning of לעולם, that there is no aging in the grave. And he (meaning Moshe Rabbeinu) returned to <em>the state of being of</em> the Torah, <em>eternal and enduring</em>. Once again alluding to the comparison of the Torah and Israel, <em>meaning Moshe Rabbeinu</em>, like is learned from the very first word in the Torah.</p>\n<p>In the context of the language cited from Devarim Rabbah, Moshe goes through the process of being concealed from the perspective of this world in order to acquire his ultimate, perfected physical body, the body of resurrection which is eternal and enduring. And this is the meaning of Isaiah 60:21, which alludes to the same allegory that Rashi mentions in connection with Israel being called <em>Reishit</em> of His produce, and says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעַמֵּךְ֙ כֻּלָּ֣ם צַדִּיקִ֔ים <strong>לְעוֹלָ֖ם יִ֣ירְשׁוּ אָ֑רֶץ נֵ֧צֶר מַטָּעַ֛י מַעֲשֵׂ֥ה יָדַ֖י לְהִתְפָּאֵֽר</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That this perfected, eternal and enduring, physical body will <em>sprout</em> from the earth in which it was planted when G-d resurrects it.</p>\n\n\n",

He also discusses learning the Gemara.</p>\n<p>Rav Avigdor Miller says that when learning Gemara, you should read it aloud (see: Eruvin 54). Say every word, one by one. Then do it again, and again and again.</p>\n<p>He connects this to eating bread. When a person thoroughly chews bread, the starch in the bread connects to an enzyme in saliva called ptyalin, which turns the starch into sugar. So too with learning Gemara: when you chew on it, e.g. repeatedly learn it out loud, it will eventually become sweet.</p>\n<p>The Nefesh Shimshon, authored by Rav Shimshon Dovid Pincus, writes (<a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/nefesh-shimshon-attainment-of-torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Nefesh Shimshon: The Attainment of Torah: Sweetness and Success in Torah Learning</em></a>, chapter: The Importance of Achieving Pleasure in Torah Learning, p. 59):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When we learn a certain masechta, we should know that it contains depth, and depth within depth, and so on. An integral part of emunah is the belief that in every word of Torah there is infinite wisdom, and it may be unfolded more and more, to endless profundity. The world was created with one goal in mind: that we should find Hashem, Who is, so to speak, the neshamah of everything. When we learn a sugya in Gemara, our goal should be to find Hashem, to find the point of kedusha that is hidden deep within the sugya.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Sochatchover Gaon, Rav Bornstein, explains in his wonderful <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/157965/p/4/t/0.5425641310872521234/fs/s1pdVuzy9UUgPVTeJJZk3lrX4KsTm6JnvyLF9dhT9IbK/start/3206/end/3213/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction of his work \"Eglei Tal\"</a> that the essence of learning Torah, is to enjoy learning it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואדרבא כי זה היא עיקר מצות לימוד התורה להיות שש ושמח ומתענג בלימודו ואז דברי תורה נבלעין בדמו ומאחר שנהנה מדברי תורה הוא נעשה דבוק</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would also like to point out that the Steipler Gaon shares a wonderful piece of advice.

It’s not good for learning to be easy.</p>\n<p>Rav Chaim Kanievsky zt\"l also gives advice on what to do when a person does not enjoy his learning (Gemara in this instance). A certain person came to see Rav Chaim, complaining that he did not enjoy what he was learning. Rav Chaim told him (Orchos Yosher, p. 22):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apparently, you do not understand what you learn. If you [did] understand, you would enjoy learning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In reply, the person asked what he needed to do to achieve love of Torah.

If you do not feel driven to study the Gemarra, you may be driven to study other parts of the Torah. Many people think that the Babylonian Talmud is the only thing Jews have to learn. This is far from true. There are many, many texts to choose from. A few suggestions below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Jerusalem Talmud: though its structure is similar to that of its Eastern counterpart, the Yerushalmi has a radically different feel and at times comes to startlingly different conclusions. There are those who will tell you you need to learn the entire Bavli first. There is in fact <strong>no</strong> such halacha.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Mishna- the Mishna is an amazing work in its own right and flows very differently from the Gemarra.

The Or haChayim is just one amazing commentary, we have many.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Nakh- Possibly the most neglected area of our sifrei kodesh. There are many great commentaries on Nakh, and the texts themselves are riveting. Why should the Notzrim have a monoply on studying <em>our</em> prophets? The Arizal says that learning Neviim will bring the Geula</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Which of course brings us to\n5) study Sod HaTorah such as Ramchal, the Zohar, Kitvei Ari.</p>\n<p>These are just a few suggestions.

    "content": "# When did Jews first start using kosher butchers? (Sifrei Devarim 71)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am wondering when Jews began the tradition of kosher butchery as such. The Torah is not very specific about how meat is to be slaughtered even for sacrifices:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thou shalt slaughter of thy herd and of thy flock, which the Lord hath\ngiven thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat within thy\ngates, after all the desire of thy soul” (Deuteronomy 12:21).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13531-shehitah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish Encyclopedia</a> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There can be but little doubt, however, that in slaughtering the\nsacrificial animals the priests followed some uniform mode akin to\nthat which was later adopted by all Israel and which is known as\n\"sheḥiṭah\"... Speculating on the etymology\nof the words \"shaḥaṭ\" and \"zabaḥ,\" the Rabbis endeavored thereby to\nestablish on a Scriptural basis the law that an animal should be\nslaughtered by cutting the throat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This can be done by anyone who owns cattle. I'm looking for written historical sources (as opposed to the Oral Law) about the development of kosher butchery as a profession.</p>\n<p>The earliest reference I can find is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.72.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei Devarim</a>. Are there earlier ones than this, either historical or scriptural? Information regarding the early history of kosher butchers (those who slaughter the animal according to halacha), beyond the tradition of draining the animal's blood, would also be appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Deuteronomy says \"as I've commanded you.\" That meant there was an oral tradition. As you noted, Sifrei then lists some of the steps involved, and the Mishna <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hullin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chulin</a> goes through all of them. Like many things in Judaism, it wasn't formally written down until around 200 CE. The fundamentals of kosher slaughter are all found in the Mishna.</p>\n<p>As for <em>professional slaughter</em>, in many communities a lot of well-educated people did it themselves. In the Yemenite Jewish community, any solid Jewish education included kosher slaughter, scribing, and circumcision. Even in the Temple, a priest had to <em>receive</em> the blood in a cup, but any knowledgeable layman could do the slaughter themselves.</p>\n<p>The notion of a completely professionalized cadre of kosher slaughterers becomes apparent as you go through the Jewish law sources from the eh, 1600s and on, or so. The Shulchan Aruch (1585) is still saying \"well really just about any sane, adult Jew can do this\"; by the time you get to the late 1700s (at least in eastern Europe), the Chochmas Adam begins his treatment of these laws with: \"the town rabbi is in charge of all slaughter; all the butchers' knives are his property and subject to his authority.\" So you can see the professionalization clearly clicking in.</p>\n<p>Of course by the late 20th Century, slaughter is <em>usually</em> no longer being done in each local city, and is instead happening at some huge facility, then the meat is shipped refrigerated to the consumers. So while a hundred years ago, a key responsibility of my city's rabbi was supervision of kosher slaughter, at this point your average pulpit rabbi may have taken slaughtering as an elective in rabbinic school, or may not, but he's probably not using it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.43.16?with=Rashi&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 43:16</a> reads \"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his house steward, “Take those men* into the house; slaughter and prepare an animal, for those men will dine with me at noon.”'</p>\n<p>The commentators read out that it was in fact Joseph's son who preformed the slaughter and that he did so in front of the brothers so they could see the slaughter had been performed in accordance with Jewish law and that the forbidden parts of the animal were not being served. (After all, why else would you slaughter an animal before your guests?).</p>\n<p>We have a tradition that Avraham employed Kosher slaughter techniques as well, but this is the first (semi-) explicit mention of Kosher butchery in the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

The problem is that drawing hot water still directly triggers the tankless unit’s burner or heating element, which is generally not permitted. A holding tank can store some pre-heated water, but once that’s used up, the tankless heater will fire to replenish it.

(It starts with ויהי רצון מלפניך.) In that prayer, the abbreviation or shorthand פ׳ ב׳ פ׳ appears. In the English translation of that prayer, an ellipsis (\"...\") appears in the same place, and it is clear that we are meant to fill in the specific names of the people we are praying for in that space. So I think I understand the practical meaning of the פ׳ ב׳ פ׳ in the Hebrew version of the prayer, but I'm just wondering what specific words these letters stand for that imply that we should fill in the names of the people we are praying for there.</p>\n<p>As a side note, I'm also wondering if there's a specific way we should say the names of of the people we are praying for. I know that when called up for Torah readings people's names are generally said as [Hebrew name] ben/bat [father's Hebrew name]. Should names be said in that way here too when reading in Hebrew this supplemental prayer asking for the healing of specific individuals?</p>\n<p>Any help answering these questions would be much appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In the 8th blessing, which is focused on healing the sick, there is a supplemental prayer as you point out, that a person can add in if they know anyone in particular who is unwell.</p>\n<p>The \"פ׳ ב׳ פ׳\" stands for פלוני בן פלונית. or if a female (thanks @DoubleAA) פלונית בת פלונית.

    "content": "# How could Adam HaRishon have contained all the souls that would ever be inside of him, including evil, even before the sin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recall a concept from the teachings of the Arizal and elsewhere that before eating of the tree of knowledge, Adam HaRishon contained all the souls that would ever exist within him, but the good and evil ones were separate in their proper places. Then when he ate, they all got mixed together within him. (I recall an Ohr HaChaim source for the latter but I spent the last hour looking for it and can't find it. I hope I'm not misremembering).</p>\n<p>I recall an Arizal that Moshiach will be a gilgul of Adam HaRishon. And (not sure of source) perhaps all of Israel are represented by Adam.</p>\n<p>I recall a third concept that when Adam HaRishon sinned, he created his opposite, which I recall reading different versions that this was Esau, or this was the nachash, or this was the samech mem, or this was Adam Bellail.</p>\n<p>Here are the questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Given that Moshiach and the nachash are opposites, how can we say that when Adam sinned, he created his opposite (the nachash), given that Bereshit 3:1 proves the nachash already existed before Adam's sin?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How can Adam represent Israel if he already contained all the souls within him from creation, including the unholy ones, given that Israel's souls in their essence are all holy?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If we say that Adam in fact only contained holy souls before the sin, and that his sin was what caused evil souls to come into existence and mix with the holy souls, would that mean that Hashem did not create evil people, rather Adam's actions did? Would that mean that Hashem would be the Creator only of holy man, while Adam's sin would be the creator of evil man? Although of course, all of creation would still only possible and subsisting because of Hashem, I am just asking about a more specific distinction within that fact. To add clarity, I don't ask in the sense that Hashem creates only good, but through our actions even good people can tar our own souls with evil. Of course, only good comes from Hashem. Rather, what I'm asking about is would Adam's sin have brought into existence <em>new</em> souls, all of the evil souls that would ever exist in all of creation, in contradistinction to the idea that Hashem created those too when He created Adam all of them were within Adam from the beginning.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If we say Adam only contained the holy souls within him, and also that his sin did <em>not</em> create the evil souls but rather it only mixed good and evil <em>that already existed</em> souls together, then where would the evil souls have existed before he sinned if not within him? Or, if we posit the opposite and say that Adam <em>did</em> contain both all the holy souls and all the evil souls within him before the sin, then in that case, how could the nachash exist somewhat independently, with an independent will, and be able to go talk to Eve by the etz daas away from Adam? If Adam contained all the souls in him already then shouldn't no living being with a soul have been able to exist outside of him at that point? Many do say the nachash was technically an angel (or an animal since serpents are animals), so if Adam is said to have only had all the <em>human</em> souls in him, something I don't remember well, then that would be one way to answer the question, but in that case I would amend the question to specify how it could be reconciled with the interpretation that the nachash was a man, like Esau. If we go off the interpretation that the nachash was Esau, how could we say that all the souls including the evil souls were already within Adam?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I include these questions in the same post because they're focused on reconciling the same concepts, and answers to each of them may affect the others. I recall having learned these concepts that now, due to more knowledge many years later, I am having trouble reconciling. I recall some of the sources for them, but not very specifically, and not others, so please help source the teachings if you know them and know the texts and page numbers.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See Eruvin 18 where Gemara tells of how Adam seperated from Chava after the sin for 130 years and emitted nocturnal seed while sleeping.

    "content": "# Noah's wife, נַעֲמָה, was born before 130 AM. How did she live to over 1,000? How did she have children at 1,160?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We find a perplexing fact from the simple reading of פרשׁת בְרֵאשִׁית with רשׁ״י:</p>\n<p>פרק ד׳ פסוק כ״א:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…Tubal-cain's sister was Naamah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Naamah</em>: She was Noah's wife</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi on פסוּק כ״ה (paraphrasing מִדְרָשׁ רַבָּא and עֵירוּבִין י״ח ב):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>And Adam knew his wife again… she named him Seth</em>: Lemech came to Adam, complaining about his wives [requesting that Adam tell his wives to live with him again (since they separated from him in פָסוּק כ״ג; see Rashi there)]…. They replied to [Adam]: “[Take back] your own [wife] first….” And therefore it says: <em>And Adam knew [his wife again].</em>…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>פֶּרֶק ה׳ פָּסוּק ג׳:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Adam lived to 130 years and he begot… Seth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>130</em>: Until then, he separated from his wife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>פֶּרֶק ה׳ פָּסוּק ל״ב:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Noah was 500 years old, and Noah begot Shem, Cham and Yafes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We also see that the Flood occurred in year 1,656, as can be worked out by adding up the ages that the generations between Seth and Noah were born to their fathers (as listed in any Chumash with a Biblical timeline, like Artscroll).</p>\n<p>We learned a few things from here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>שֵׁת is younger than נַעֲמָה, since she was born before him in the year 130 from creation. (It’s stated somewhere—possibly in מִדְרָשׁ רַבָּא or עֵירוּבִין י״ח ב, or in בַּעַל הַטּוּרִים, or elsewhere—that עָדָה and צִלָּה already had two children, and therefore were no longer obligated in the Mitzva of פְּרוּ וּרְבוּ).</li>\n<li>נַעֲמָה was Noah's wife, and they had children when Noah was 500 years old.</li>\n<li>The Flood occurred in the year 1,656.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It therefore seems fairly obvious that נַעֲמָה lived at least 1,657 years (assuming she may have died upon leaving the Ark).</p>\n<p>My first question is as follows: I had always thought that when Hashem said that whoever eats from the Tree of knowledge will die on that day, “day” meant 1,000 years (as in Tehillim, \"To Me a thousand years is like a day\"). He took 70 years from Adam as Rashi brings down, and Mesushelash lived closer to 1,000. However, no one in these twn Generations lived beyond 1000.</p>\n<p>My second question: How did נַעֲמָה begin having children at 1,160 years old?</p>\n<p>It could be that I am wrong about the age of נַעֲמָה. Athough the Pasuk says “…the sister of תּוּבַל־קַיִן was נַעֲמָה”, perhaps they were not born in the order they were listed, and she was born much later. That might be what Rashi is explaining when he comments that נַעֲמָה was Noah’s wife—i.e. that's why she's mentioned here even though she wasn't born yet.</p>\n<p>It could also be that Adam <em>did</em> have children who surpassed the age of 1,000 (although the ones whose ages were listed did not). However, that wouldn’t necessarily mean she was under 1,000 when she died or when she had her children.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Enoch and Methuselah lived in the city of Larsa when Enoch was killed by Alulim the illuminator Al-Lumen for damning the Nephilim son of Kichuna. This means some how Lamech or Noah arrived at Badtibira for Noah at age 50 to be in the city that revived its glory of bronze making. Perhaps Noah invented nails under the rule of EnMengalana 240 years after Tubel-Cain invented bronze water jars at the same Badguguru (Badtibira). Noah had to be there at age 50 to see the start of this bronze production as well as meet Tubel-Cain's sister Naamah to be his wife and our mother. This means with <strong>Noah</strong> born in 1056am he <strong>met her in 50th year 1106am at 50 so in 1160am Noah was 104 years old if she begot her first child born from him.</strong> Obviously a family descent of Noah all (its generations) drowning most born long before Japheth was born 350 years later. The three sons are our fathers, totally unnecessary to divulge other children of Noah (nor MORE tedious memorized generations in 1656 years) than 10th generation Noah. Those \"many sons & daughters\" mentioned earlier are so you dont think the Flood filled a world of only 10 forefathers and not a whole populated Earth. If Naamah had a son in 1160am, she certainly had many or several between him and 495 years until Japheth just as Eve had sons between Cain & Abel and also between Abel & Seth in 130 years. Nothing proves Abel 2nd and Seth 3rd. YOU are the one providing ME with her age as year 1160 when she had her firstborn. I just explained how. Now in return i give to you, Ham lived to age 536, and another source gives no age but the year given is 1904bc probable 445 (? 2349-1904bc) for Japheth after the Flood dying at age 545.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BHq1CNDz.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BHq1CNDz.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

This is an excellent question, and amazing clarity of mind that you spotted that.</p>\n<p>It is well known that Hashem requires you to make an effort for your livelihood (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.19?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 3:19</a>), and blesses you with what you already have (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kings II Chapter 4</a> and the \"One Woman\", and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.92a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 92a</a> about requiring bread on your table in order to receive a bracha, this is also discussed in Zohar that a bracha can't come out of thin air but needs something tangible to attach on to so there is no new creation - I'll try to find the source). I believe that you've also stumbled onto more scriptual evidence that this is how the Providence of Blessing works!</p>\n<p>You can pray for more money, but if you are limiting Hashem to bless you and your small vessel (a small mixing bowl), then His blessing will also be limited. Generally speaking, the main vessel for receiving blessing is <strong>trust</strong> (Bitochon), according to Chassidus. See this letter from the Rebbe to someone writing to him with fears about livelihood: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/letters/default_cdo/aid/1866752/jewish/Parnassa.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/letters/default_cdo/aid/1866752/jewish/Parnassa.htm</a></p>\n<p>Emuna is the belief that all livelihood and blessing comes only from Hashem. Bitachon is the trust that He will do good by you, and the more of that you have the more good He does. It's hard to understand this from a theological point of view, but certainly we can understand it from a human point of view. Certainly, if we feel that the people we are looking after trust in us, we find more desire and energy to provide for them the very best we can. Surely, this is superior to a \"mixing bowl\" or other vessel.</p>\n<p>If one has ultimate trust that Hashem can make Him a millionaire out of a small mixing bowl, surely this will be considered a very great thing in Heaven and they will certainly be tremendously blessed for showing such trust in their Father in Heaven!</p>\n\n\n",

Why then can the pedestrian get ownership of the object if he says \"I acquired it for myself\"? That's not completely fair, isn't it? If I am walking on the street and see something nice on the ground, I ask my friend \"do you see that pen? Could you please pick it up for me?\". Then, according to the Mishnah, my friend can keep the object if he says that he acquired it. However, I found it, I told my friend about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Why isn't looking at something, e.g. finding something on the ground, make me acquiring it?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I am assuming, although you did not mention it specifically, that you are asking based on the Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.118a.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 118A</a> that mentions looking at an ownerless item as a way to acquire it according to one opinion;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבה הבטה בהפקר תנאי היא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabba says: The issue of whether, in the case of ownerless property, viewing effects acquisition of it is a dispute between tanna’im</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, this Gemara would be in contradiction to many other places that state explicitly that it does not work. For example, the Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.10a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 10A</a> that says although one saw an ownerless item, and even fell on it, it does not work.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ראה את המציאה ונפל עליה ובא אחר והחזיק בה זה שהחזיק בה זכה בה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MISHNA: If one saw a found item and fell upon it, intending to thereby acquire it, but did not employ one of the formal modes of acquisition, and then another came and seized it, the one who seized it acquired it because he employed one of the formal modes of acquisition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosfos in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Bava_Metzia.2a.8.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 2A</a> seems to imply these questions, and qualifies that looking at an item itself would not be sufficient by itself, but some minimal action is required as well;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבראיה בעלמא לא קני - והא דאמרי' בפרק הבית והעלייה (לקמן בבא מציעא דף קיח. ושם) הבטה בהפקר קני היינו שעשה מעשה כל דהו כגון שגדר גדר קטן:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[H]e does not acquire [it] through sight. The Mishna teaches us that by merely seeing a lost object, one does not acquire it.\nThere seems to be a contradiction to this ruling from a Gemara later on 118a. The Gemara there quotes a Mishna in Shekalim which cites a dispute about whether those who guard the growing barley in the Shemittah year must be paid for their labor or not. The first Tanna holds that they must be paid. Otherwise, the barley they are guarding would belong to them and the barley for the Omer offering must belong to the public, not to an individual. R’ Yose holds that the guards can work for free if they so desire.\nThe Gemara explains that the first Tanna holds that “guarding” the ownerless barley is a way of acquiring it. If the guards are not paid from public funds, they become the legal owners and the Omer offering must be owned by the public. R’ Yose holds that “guarding” the ownerless barley is not an acceptable method of acquiring it. Thus, even if the guards are not paid, the barley does not become their property and may be used for the Omer offering. The Gemara continues to suggest other ways of explaining the dispute, but they all focus around whether “guarding” the growing barley is an acceptable method of acquisition.\nThe Gemara uses the expression הבטה which literally means looking or watching. Tosfos understands that this is the same as ראיה - seeing, of our Gemara. Thus, we have what appears to be a contradiction. That which [the Gemara] says in Perek Habayis Vehaliyah (below 118a): “watching” an ownerless item is an effective act of acquisition, that is when he did some minimal action, such as constructing a small fence around the barley. Even though he did nothing at all to the barley, “watching” or “guarding” it is an effective act of acquisition, but by merely seeing a lost object and taking no action whatsoever, one does not acquire the object (Sefaria)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on the above, it is apparent that looking at an object and telling your friend to pick it up is not enough to make it yours.</p>\n\n\n",

The Mishnah says that since כפרים didn’t have readers, they would always travel to bigger cities to read the Megillah on Mondays or Thursdays (depending when the 14th was) and they would hear the Megillah being read by the Beis Din men there. So the Mishnah clearly states that all small towns must read the Megillah on Mondays or Thursdays (even if they don’t fall out on the 14th itself). My question is what if a small town did in fact have a Baal kore and the 14th fell on let’s say a Tuesday, would they be able to stay in their town and read from the Megillah on the 14th, or would they have to follow the Mishnah and read in a big city on Monday despite having a reader?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.4b.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megilla 4B</a> concludes that the option to read the Megilla earlier is meant to make things easier for them, if they do choose, but not to require them to read it earlier;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תָּא שְׁמַע, אָמַר רַבִּי יְהוּדָה: אֵימָתַי — בִּמְקוֹם שֶׁנִּכְנָסִים בַּשֵּׁנִי וּבַחֲמִישִׁי, אֲבָל מְקוֹם שֶׁאֵין נִכְנָסִים בַּשֵּׁנִי וּבַחֲמִישִׁי — אֵין קוֹרִין אוֹתָהּ אֶלָּא בִּזְמַנָּהּ. וְאִי סָלְקָא דַעְתָּךְ תַּקַּנְתָּא דִכְרַכִּין הִיא — מִשּׁוּם דְּאֵין נִכְנָסִים בַּשֵּׁנִי וּבַחֲמִישִׁי מַפְסְדִי לְהוּ לִכְרַכִּין?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara continues: Come and hear that which was taught in the following mishna (5a): Rabbi Yehuda said: When is the Megilla read from the eleventh of Adar and onward? In a place where the villagers generally enter town on Monday and Thursday. However, in a place where they do not generally enter town on Monday and Thursday, one may read the Megilla only in its designated time, the fourteenth of Adar. The Gemara infers: If it enters your mind to say that the ordinance is for the benefit of the cities, would it be reasonable to suggest that because the villagers do not enter town on Monday and Thursday the residents of the cities should lose out and not be provided with food and water?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>לָא תֵּימָא כְּדֵי שֶׁיְּסַפְּקוּ מַיִם וּמָזוֹן, אֶלָּא אֵימָא מִפְּנֵי  שֶׁמְּסַפְּקִים מַיִם וּמָזוֹן לַאֲחֵיהֶם שֶׁבַּכְּרַכִּין.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara accepts this argument: Do not say that the Sages allowed the villages to advance their reading of the Megilla to the day of assembly so that they can be free to provide water and food to their brethren in the cities on the day of Purim. Rather, say that the Sages were lenient with them because the villages supply water and food to their brethren in the cities. This ordinance was established for the benefit of the villagers so that they should not have to make an extra trip to the cities to hear the reading of the Megilla. However, in a place where the villages do not go to the cities, advancing their reading of the Megilla to the day of assembly will not benefit them, and therefore they must read on the fourteenth</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

So, if a gentile studies only the halachos concering the seven mitzvos, he is considered \"a High Priest\", according to the Gemara.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וזה המשכו של הפסוק הקודם מגיד דבריו ליעקב חוקיו ומשפטיו לישראל וכן מובא במסכת סנהדרין דף נ\"ט ע\"א שגם הגוי עצמו מצווה שלא ללמוד תורה ואם לומד תורה חייב מיתה וכך מובא שם בגמרא ואמר רבי יוחנן עובד כוכבים שעוסק בתורה חייב מיתה שנאמר תורה צוה לנו משה מורשה לנו מורשה ולא להם וליחשבה גבי שבע מצות מאן דאמר מורשה מיגזל קא גזיל לה מאן דאמר מאורסה דינו כנערה המאורסה דבסקילה הרי שאיסור תלמוד תורה על הגוי כלול או באיסור גזל או באיסורי עריות בכלל איסור נערה המאורסה ושם הקשתה הגמרא מברייתא שממנה משתמע שיש מעלה גדולה לגוי שלומד תורה ותירצה הגמרא שיש להבחין בין סתם לימוד תורה שזה אסור על הגוי לבין לימוד שבע מצוות בני נח שהעכו\"ם חייבין בהן ובלימודם וידיעתם יש מעלה וכך מובא שם בהמשך הגמרא מיתיבי היה רבי מאיר אומר מניין שאפילו נכרי ועוסק בתורה שהוא ככהן גדול שנאמר ויקרא י\"ח ה' אשר יעשה אותם האדם וחי בהם כהנים לויים וישראלים לא נאמר אלא האדם הא למדת שאפילו נכרי ועוסק בתורה הרי הוא ככהן גדול התם בשבע מצוות דידהו</p>\n<p>Rabbi Shimeon ben Avraham Levi cites <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/62221/jewish/The-7-Noahide-Laws-Universal-Morality.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 147:19</a> “He declares\nhis Word to Ya῾aqov, his statutes and his judgments to Yisra᾽el.”.\nThis is also cited by the Talmud in Sanhedrin, in 59a, where the\ngentile is prohibited to study Torah, and is liable to receive the\ndeath penalty. “Moses commanded us a law [torah], an inheritance of\nthe congregation of Jacob” (Deuteronomy 33:4), indicating that it is\nan inheritance for us, and not for them.”</p>\n<p>However, there seem to be a contraditction, because in the Gemara it\nsays “but rather: A person, indicating that all people are included.\nYou have therefore learned that even a gentile who engages in Torah\nstudy is considered like a High Priest.”. This, however, refers to a\ngentile that studies the Torah which deals with the seven Noachide\nLaws. (losely translated, still work-in-progress.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that the principle mentioned in the Gemara, that a gentile cannot learn Torah, does not apply to sections in Torah that also applies to Noahides. Therefore, there are commentators that explain that a Noahide (or a gentile) is allowed to delve into Torah, but only the sections that apply to that person.

See:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Do not profane G‑d’s Oneness in any way.\nAcknowledge that there is a single G‑d who cares about what we are doing and desires that we take care of His world.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Do not curse your Creator. No matter how angry you may be, do not\ntake it out verbally against your Creator.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Do not murder. The value of human life cannot be measured. To\ndestroy a single human life is to destroy the entire world—because,\nfor that person, the world has ceased to exist. It follows that by\nsustaining a single human life, you are sustaining an entire universe.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Do not eat a limb of a still-living animal. Respect the life of all\nG‑d’s creatures. As intelligent beings, we have a duty not to cause\nundue pain to other creatures.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Do not steal. Whatever benefits you receive in this world, make\nsure that none of them are at the unfair expense of someone else.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Harness and channel the human libido. Incest, adultery, rape and\nhomosexual relations are forbidden. The family unit is the foundation\nof human society. Sexuality is the fountain of life and so nothing is\nmore holy than the sexual act. So, too, when abused, nothing can be\nmore debasing and destructive to the human being.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Establish courts of law and ensure justice in our world.

    "title": "What opinions on what types of bird's nests relate to Moshiach? Is phoenix sourced?",
    "content": "# What opinions on what types of bird's nests relate to Moshiach? Is phoenix sourced?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I saw a Rav quote the Zohar as saying Mashiach's soul is in the bird's nest, but then the Rav made a comment, without a source, that it's like a phoenix, the way a phoenix resurrects. However, is there a source for this specifically either that Moshiach is likened to a phoenix, or that his soul is like a phoenix and the bird's nest in question where it is is a phoenix's nest? And what other opinions are there besides a phoenix on the type of birds Moshiach and the bird's nest relate to? I've probably learned most of the more popular opinions before (like the eagle, dove's nest, and so on) so the more unusual or minority the opinions are also welcomed. I always want to learn new teachings I never learned before, although memory refreshers are very worthwhile too. But my greatest interest in this question is a source for the phoenix representation to Moshiach and other opinions I have never learned before, as well as what the phoenix or other bird associations tell us about what Moshiach will be like and accomplish!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Zohar does not elaborate on what kind of birds nest it is. See below for what I've found on the concept of Phoenix.</p>\n<p>The concept of Moshiach being in the \"birds nest\" comes from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.2.7b.5?vhe=New_Torat_Emet_Zohar&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar (2:7b:5)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּהַהוּא זִמְנָא, יִתְּעַר מַלְכָּא מְשִׁיחָא, לְנַפְקָא מִגּוֹ גִּנְתָּא דְּעֵדֶן, מֵהַהוּא אֲתָר (בלק ק''ד ע''ב) דְּאִתְקְרֵי קַ''ן צִפּוֹ''ר, וְיִתְּעָר בְּאַרְעָא (ויקרא רי''ב ב') דְּגָלִיל, וְהַהוּא יוֹמָא דְּיִפּוּק לְתַמָּן, יִתְרָגַּז כָּל עָלְמָא, וְכָל בְּנֵי עָלְמָא מִתְחַבְּאִין גּוֹ מְעַרְתֵי וְטִנָּרֵי, דְּלָא יַחְשְׁבוּן לְאִשְׁתְּזָבָא. וְעַל הַהוּא זִמְנָא כְּתִּיב, (ישעיהו ב׳:י״ט) וּבָאוּ בִּמְעָרוֹת צוּרִים וּבִמְחִלּוֹת עָפָר מִפְּנֵי פַּחַד ה' וּמֵהֲדַר גְּאוֹנוֹ בְּקוּמוֹ לַעֲרוֹץ הָאָרֶץ.</p>\n<p>At that time the king, Messiah, will arise to go out of the Garden of\nEden from the place called the 'bird's nest' and he will become\nrevealed in the land of Galilee. On the day that MESSIAH goes there,\nthe whole world will tremble and all the people of the world will hide\nin the caves and CRACKS in the rocks and will not expect to survive.\nAnd concerning that time, it is written, \"And they shall go into the\nholes of the rocks, and in the caves of the earth, for fear of Hashem,\nand for the glory of His majesty, when He arises to shake the earth\nterribly\" (Yeshayah 2:19). Translation from <a href=\"https://www.zohar.com/zohar/Shemot/chapters/15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The birds nest is symbolic and refers to a place within Gan Eden, the Garden of Eden:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לְגוֹ לְגוֹ מִכָּל אִינּוּן הֵיכָלִין, אִית אֲתָר אַחֲרָא טָמִיר וְגָנִיז דְּלָא אִתְיְדַע כְּלָל, וְאִקְרֵי עֵדֶן. וְלֵית מַאן דְּיָכִיל לְמִנְדַּע בֵּיהּ. וּמָשִׁיחַ אַגְנִיז (ס''א יתגלי) לְבַר, סַחֲרָנֵיהּ דְּהַהוּא אֲתָר, עַד דְּאִתְגְלֵי לֵיהּ חַד אֲתָר. דְּאִקְרֵי קַן צִפּוֹר, וְאִיהוּ אֲתָר דְּכָרִיז עָלֵיהּ הַהוּא צִפּוֹר. דְּאִתְּעַר בְּגִנְתָא דְּעֵדֶן בְּכָל יוֹמָא.</p>\n<p>Innermost from all these THOUSAND chambers OF PLEASURES, there is one\nplace concealed and hidden that is entirely unknown, called 'Eden.'\nThere is no one who can conceive it. Messiah is concealed outside\naround that place, until a place called 'bird's nest' is revealed to\nhim. This place is announced by the bird, which awakens daily in the\nGarden of Eden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea of the Zohar is taken from a posuk in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.22.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 22:6</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a bird’s nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the mother bird sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the mother bird together with the young.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although it does not completely explain why that place is called a \"birds nest\", it can shed some light upon it. The Kedushas Levi on Devarim 22:6 explains that there are two kinds of animated awakenings. A spiritual, elevating one, a totally physical one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deuteornomy 22,6. “if you chance to come upon a bird’s ‎nest, etc.;” it is well known that there are two types of ‎התעוררות‎, “animated awakenings;” one is a spiritually positive ‎one, an urge to elevate one’s spiritual potential; the other is a ‎sometimes overwhelming urge to embrace everything ‎physical.\nIt is forbidden to use one’s spiritual urges in a ‎manner that results in one’s leaving one’s livelihood and matters ‎connected with it merely to G’d, i.e. to rely on miracles. Instead, ‎one must strive to earn one’s livelihood by the work of one’s ‎hands, leaving it to G’d to make one’s efforts in this direction ‎successful. If one pursues this path it is reasonable to expect that ‎one will be blessed with Divine inspiration at critical times in ‎one’s life. G’d is in the habit of adding additional wisdom to those ‎who use their common sense.\n<strong>Still, as long as the child is very ‎young, it is the mother’s task to act as the child’s immediate ‎provider, whether by supplying milk from her body or from ‎another source. It is only when a human being has not been ‎equipped with any intelligence at all, that G’d will provide for ‎such a helpless human being who cannot take steps in that ‎direction himself.</strong> (emphasis mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My pshat is that Moshiach will be conceiled in \"the birds nest\" until time has arrived. Maybe this can be explained that until Moshiach comes, and \"the whole world will be filled with G-ds knowledge\", G-d will, as a metaphorical mother-bird, feed us, help us out etc...</p>\n<p>Edit: I've found something concerning the phoenix. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.29.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Job 29:18</a>, the focus lies on the word \"sand\", chol:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days like the sand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.29.18?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Job.29.18.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> on this posuk clearly mentions the name \"phoenix\" as the name of the bird that is called chol:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and I will multiply days as the phoenix Heb. וכחול. This is a bird named חול, phoenix, upon which the punishment of death was not decreed because it did not taste of the Tree of Knowledge, and at the end of one thousand years, it renews itself and returns to its youth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This idea is echoed by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.29.18?lang=bi&p2=Malbim_Beur_Hamilot_on_Job.29.18.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim Beur Hamilot</a> and by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.29.18?lang=bi&with=Bereishit%20Rabbah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shimon in Bereishis Rabbah 19:5</a>. The Lubavitcher Rebbe <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2963/jewish/The-Phoenix.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">said</a> the Phoenix can also refer to the Jewish People, who raised from the Holocaust to a new life.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How to reconcile two approaches to worldly pleasures found in Torah - avoidance and obligation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am looking for a detailed, comprehensive answer (if possible) to this. As one studies Torah one comes across a seeming contradictory set of values.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, it seems that our greatest heroes were renowned (and sometimes renounced) for their shocking levels of abstinence (I will edit with sources soon). Perishut (abstinence) is one of the levels in Mesilat Yisharim.</p>\n<p>On the other, we are chided for not deriving kosher pleasures in this world. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/127821/in-the-next-world-a-person-shall-be-judged-for-all-the-fruit-that-he-saw-but-d?rq=1\">this</a> answer, and more sources will be edited in when I get a chance.</p>\n<p>I've learned a lot of chassidus, ta'anug isn't bad. It's actually the deepest. The halachot of ta'anug are rigorous, but it's not like ta'anug is, in and of itself wrong, in fact it is very important for us to raise the creation and make it holy, and enjoy the spiritual ta'anug that is the process and the result of this. It's very important to be a mensch, and use your ta'anug in the service of others, make sure to feel a lot of love and warmth towards your family, the Jewish people, mankind, Hashem, enjoy gifts that are given to you, enjoy Yommim Tovim etc.</p>\n<p>Yet still, there's a heavy emphasis on our sages dafka avoiding all possible pleasures in this world, kosher, not kosher, etc, sometimes are even criticised for this.</p>\n<p><strong>So the question is how to reconcile these two points of view?</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The side that needs the most explanation, from my point of view at least, is the side of abstinence.</p>\n<p>Firstly, Why were Chazal doing that? What does it achieve, what's the good in it? I sometimes try to imagine, what lesson were they given as children that inspired them to dedicate their lives to reaching such high levels and become passionate innovators of Perishut, even sometimes at great risk and penalty? We, nowadays, aren't taught anything which <em>inspires</em> that; the knowledge is seemingly lost from the public consciousness that makes this all make sense.</p>\n<p>Secondly. If that's the ideal, then should we all be striving for that?</p>\n<p>Thirdly, how do we contextualise this with the fact that there is nothing actually wrong with pleasure, it's a very great and holy thing that sits in the etzem of our neshama, so what's so good about going to great lengths to avoid it in this world? What's the connection with Olam Haba?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I’m sure there are many varied approaches to this question, but since you mentioned him I will go with the approach of the Mesilas Yesharim.\nThe Mesilas Yesharim in Chapter 13 where he explains what prishus is, addresses this question specifically. He quotes conflicting statements from chazal that seem to express different views. At the end of the chapter he ends with the following statement:</p>\n<p>הרי לך הכלל האמיתי: שכל מה שאינו מוכרח לאדם בעניני העולם הזה ראוי לו שיפרוש מהם, וכל מה שהוא מוכרח לו מאיזה טעם שיהיה כיון שהוא מוכרח לו, אם הוא פורש ממנו הרי זה חוטא. הנה זה כלל נאמן, אך משפט הפרטים על פי הכלל הזה אינו מסור אלא אל שקול הדעת ולפי שכלו יהולל איש, כי אי אפשר לקבץ כל הפרטים כי רבים הם ואין שכל האדם יכול להקיף על כולם אלא דבר דבר בעתו.\nHere then is a true general principle: whatever worldly matter is not essential for a man, it is proper for him to separate from it, and whatever is essential to him for whatever reason, if he separates from it - he is a sinner, since that thing is necessary for him. Behold, this is a faithful guideline. But the weighing of this rule is a matter of individual judgment and \"according to his understanding a man is praised\" (Mishlei 12:8). For it is impossible to discuss all the details of Separation for they are so numerous that a man's mind cannot grasp all of them. Rather each matter must be dealt with in its time. (Translation taken from Sefaria)</p>\n<p>So as the Ramchal himself states the details are too numerous to go through. Each person has to be their own judge. But he does state that if there is any reason whatsoever not to abstain then separating would be a sin. So one has to truly be mindful if being a parush will cause him resentment or any other negative affects (or affect anyone around him).</p>\n<p>One more point to add. In that same chapter Ramchal states that Perishus is meant for someone that wants to be a chasid which is already a level beyond a tzaddik. So there is much to be worked on before someone seriously considers perishus.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is a concept in morality, that we do not inherently deserve<sup>1</sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עַד שֶׁלֹּא נוֹצַֽרְתִּי אֵינִי כְדַאי</p>\n<p>Before I was created, I was worthless</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is logical. We do not have the power to create ourselves, or to sustain ourselves now that we are created, nor do we have the power to create pleasures, or create the ability to enjoy pleasures. We do not inherently deserve life, not to mention pleasure.</p>\n<p>The point is far stronger if one includes the idea of tzimtzum she'lo k'peshuto. This is the kabbalistic idea that brings with it the concept that Hashem is immanently present in the world, because the world is made, so to speak, from His Essence<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>Is it any wonder then, that Chazal who were on a very high level of sensitivity to truth and holiness, and of pristine character traits (including bashfulness), were unable to bring themselves to partake of the physical pleasures of life? They were highly in tune with the truth that we do not deserve this, similarly to how many people feel when we are guests in someone else's home, and feel we need to wait for permission to begin eating and drinking.</p>\n<p>This is the same Chazal who also taught us about all of the mitzvot and their derivations (such as <em>seudat mitzva</em>). The mitzvot and halachot are the Will of Hashem. The <em>positive</em> side to the point presented thus far is that they would have felt that, since they don't deserve to be here, but Hashem put them here, lets them be here and wants them to be here, pleasing Him and doing whatever He wants is imperative. Again, the mashal would be being a guest in someone else's home, we feel a natural desire to wanting to please our host, and follow his rules.</p>\n<p>So in the context of a <em>seudat mitzva</em>, or <em>oneg Shabbat</em>, Hashem Himself expects us, as part of His Will, to enjoy physical pleasures. This provides ample opportunity to be true to the point being made in Yerushalmi Kiddushin 4:12 about \"In the future one will be judged for all that his eyes saw and he didn't eat\".</p>\n<p>See this Sicha, B'Ha'alotecha I from Likkutei Sichot 5 p.1035:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For this reason it is a mitzva to take pleasure on the Shabbos by\neating and drinking. The pleasure which a Jew derives from physical\neating and drinking on Shabbos - i.e., not only the act of eating, but\nthe pleasure itself - is a mitzva. During the week, we should not eat\nor drink more than is necessary to maintain our bodies. Even then, one\nshould not eat or drink for pleasure, but rather out of necessity, for\npleasure makes one more materially oriented. On Shabbos, by contrast,\nnot only does the pleasure not make a person materially oriented, the\npleasure itself becomes a mitzva. (SIE translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if this is a general principle and not just limited to food, but all permissible worldly pleasures, Chazal would still approach all pleasures under the context of \"fulfilling Hashem's Will\", rather than personal satisfaction. Some may have been unable to bring themselves to do it - enjoy worldly pleasures - simply finding it too against their nature and difficult, whereas others might have been able to pull it off, and derive some minimal pleasure under duress, while avoiding doing so from a place of satisfying their nefesh or yeitzer. Thus, their declaration that \"<strong>I</strong> didn't partake of physical pleasure in my life\" still holds true.</p>\n<p>For the rest of us, we take the middle road. We start in a place of deriving pleasures from the world without any good middot getting in the way, and strive to reach a point where we are doing so l'halacha. Hashem did indeed create pleasure for more reasons than just giving our yeitzer hara something to do. Pleasure is a reality and has many kosher applications, many mitzva applications, can be a road to the ultimate goal of getting closer to Hashem, the source of (and only true) pleasure, and is indeed the reward in the World to Come. Getting to the point where we include Hashem in our pleasures, by recognising it comes from Him, thanking Him and praising Him, and looking after our health, our middot, and making sure that we are doing so in a way that doesn't deviate from His Will - nay is in fact an expression of His Will - is our goal and will cultivate in us the same positive middot that Chazal had; the same <em>penimius</em> recognition of our undeservedness, which in the right context is only a good, healthy thing!</p>\n<p>Just like guests at a shabbat meal - if they avoided enjoying all the delicious dishes you made for them, you will hold it against them!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I've seen sources I can't recall right now that state that part of the point of having to die and be resurrected is because when we partake of physical pleasures inappropriately, we destroy a good sensitivity towards them that we will need in Olam Haba to enjoy them properly. Death and resurrection is the only way to get it back. Does anyone have a source for this as it would be pertinent to this answer. It seems very logical. Olam Haba is for those who have come to the point of \"deserving\" life and pleasures by earning it through Olam Hazeh. Any time we derive physical pleasure in this world, we desensitise ourselves to it. Fair enough if we are under instruction to derive that physical pleasure from Hashem, but any time we did so inappropriately, this is going to detract from the reward of Olam Haba and it is right that, after teshuva and a life of mitzvot, we are given the opportunity to redeem our sensitivity, in preparation for Olam Haba.</p>\n<p>Note: I am not <em>necessarily</em> saying that the pleasures of Olam Haba include physical pleasures like food etc. But the point can still stand in a more general sense.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>This idea is generally my own, therefore I'd appreciate some feedback. If people generally view it as in line with Torah thought, I would consider accepting it.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - Based on Rava's prayer in Berachot 17a, also brought in Yoma 87b.</sup><br />\n<sup>2 - Rabbi Shmuel Schneersohn of Lubavitch, “Mi Komokhah” in Likutei Torah—Torat Shmuel, Sefer 5629 (Kehot Publication Society: New York, 1992) p. 163.

If he was considered alive, yibum doesn’t have to be done (if the father aka your brother later dies without any further kids).

    "content": "# If the ENTIRE Egyptian army drowned, why didn't the Babylonians/Hittites invade Egypt?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The following is an excerpt of a <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/living_up_to_the_truth/the_controversy/1011\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">critique</a> on \"<a href=\"https://mosaicapress.com/product/reason-to-believe/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reason to Believe</a>\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Critic: Under these conditions, were the Ten Plagues and a total crush of the Egyptian army in the Red Sea waters to happen, as we are told by the Torah, Egypt's ruthless neighbors -- the Babylonians and the Hittites -- would immediately invade the powerless country, conquer it, and glorify their victory in dozens of records, inscriptions, and monuments. Yet nothing like this ever happened. More specifically, historical records tell us that between 1320 and 1283 BCE Egypt and the Hittite empire were at a state of permanent war; had the Ten Plagues and the Exodus happened in 1313 BCE, when Judaic tradition claims they did, they would have quickly led to a Hittite invasion and conquest of the ruined Egypt -- which, of course, did not happen. Instead, after almost four decades of indecisive war, a peace treaty and a mutual defense pact were signed between Egypt and the Hittite empire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/living_up_to_the_truth/the_controversy/1011\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a> for the authors response (which only responds to the plagues - not to the splitting of the Red Sea).</p>\n<p>Most of that discussion between the critic and the author I'm not currently interested in. What I want to do is strengthen the question of the critic based on extra-Scriptural Judaic tradition.</p>\n<p>The simple read of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 14:4 - 28</a> (especially according to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.28?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> in pasuk 28 and the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.9?lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> in pasuk 9) is that the ENTIRE Egyptian army drowned at sea. This is because even though I agree that pasuk 28 could be explained as specifically referring to the part of the army that came, if the word \"cheil\" in pasuk 28 (Ramban) or 9 (Ibn Ezra) is referring to foot soldiers, then when it says \"u'v'chol chei'lo\" in pasuk 4 and 17, it's also referring to foot soldiers (and not just the horsemen/charioteers), and in those pesukim (4 and 17) the pashtus seems to be that ALL of the foot soldiers are going to chase after the Jews.</p>\n<p>If so, then the question of the critic is much stronger; why didn't the Babylonians/Hittites attack Egypt immediately afterwards?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Actually the opposite can be said. The simple reading <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.7?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">of</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּקַּ֗ח שֵׁשׁ־מֵא֥וֹת רֶ֙כֶב֙ בָּח֔וּר וְכֹ֖ל רֶ֣כֶב מִצְרָ֑יִם\nוְשָׁלִשִׁ֖ם עַל־כֻּלּֽוֹ (and he took six hundred chosen chariots,\nand all the chariots of Miżrayim, and captains over every one of them)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is that he did not take his whole army. Why  would it say 600 chosen chariots  if he took all off them? Rashi  understands it to be saying that he took 600 chosen <strong>military</strong> chariots. The rest were from the civilians who came along (see the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.7?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Siftei%20Chakhamim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifsei Chachomim</a>) The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.28?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.9?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> seem to be saying the entire Egyptian army in the same context as you would say \"the entire American army \" when discussing a specific battle.  It is self-understanding you only mean the American soldiers who were participating in that battle, as opposed to the totality of the American army.</p>\n<p>That said, it is possible he did take his whole army. Inconclusive either way.</p>\n<p>As far as why the Babylonians and the Hittites didn't invade afterwards.  First, very little is known about those groups in ancient times. What records of this alleged 37 year conflicts are there that give enough information to speculate on their strategies? In fact, until 1838, when the first Hittite remains were found, the anti-Torah crowd claimed that the lack of evidence of their existence indicates that they didn't and the Torah was made up. AF\"L. But assuming they were at a state of war with Egypt at the time there could be a thousand  reasons why they didn't rush to invade. Could be there were international diplomatic relations and NATO type mutual defense treaties  that prevented them from doing so. Could be that they were scared if that if they did conquer Egypt they would follow the same devastation as the Egyptians for occupying the territories. Could be Egypt was so decimated at the time that occupying it  would have been taking on a white elephant. Could be that even without an army the Egyptians would have engaged in asymmetric warfare similar to the Palestinians in Gaza making it too difficult to occupy. Could be Pharaoh had a deal with some foreign mercenaries  were his army to be stretched too thin (very common in that era)   etc. etc. etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are a lot of assumptions that underly this question without which the question falls away.</p>\n<p>The primary assumption is how the dates line up. Egyptian dating and Jewish dating of events both have a lot of uncertainty prior to 664 BCE (the Sack of Thebes). You can read some of the debates between Kenneth Kitchen and David Rohl to get an idea of the uncertainty of Egyptian dating.</p>\n<p>For example, if the Exodus took place in 1446 BCE (as some suggest), the Hittite Empire had not yet clashed with Egypt. If it took place in 1225 (the latest date scholars propose), Egypt and the Hittite were allies.</p>\n<p>However, even granting all the premises of the question, it is not a very strong one. The Hittite Empire and Babylon did not border Egypt proper. Between them was Canaan. Egypt had expanded its empire into Canaan and Syria and governed portions of it from afar. The Hittite Empire governed an area that stretched into what is today Lebanon and it was there that they clashed with Egypt. Neither the Hittites nor the Babylonians (Assyrians?) were trying to conquer Egypt. They were trying to keep Egypt out of their backyards.</p>\n<p>So in the late 14th century BCE--around the time of the 1313 BCE date used in the question--the Egyptians had pulled back from Canaan/Syria and the Hittites were less inclined to fight them. Moreover, around this time there was tremendous turmoil within the Hittite empire. The Hittites were beset by plagues which killed multiple Hittite kings. The king that eventually took over, Mursili II, spent the bulk of his reign putting down rebellions within and on the edge of his borders (or those of his vassal states). He was in no condition to invade Egypt.</p>\n<p>It was only starting around the year 1290 BCE (using convential Egyptology dating) that the conflict between the Hittites and Egypt really got going again when Egypt began to expand back into Canaan.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kadesh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">See the Wikipedia article on the Battle of Kadesh</a>.</p>\n<p>I would also add the Amarna letters includes letters from various former vassals of Egypt--Kings of City-States in Canaan--pleading with Egypt for help in fighting off invasion of the Hittite's from the North and \"Habiru\" or \"Apiru\" who were invading from the South. No help ever came. Perhaps because the Egyptian army still had not recovered from being drowned at the Red Sea.</p>\n<p>In summation, it is very easy to play with the dates of the Exodus and find time periods that line up pretty well with the destruction of the Egyptian army. Anyone who tells you that the Exodus could not have happened or must have happened based on the archeology, is fooling themselves and/or you.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschutz and Shabbtaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there recent \"orthodox\" rabbis who think Rav Eybeschutz <strong>was</strong> indeed a shabbtaist ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I have heard a number of rabbeim say this in  private and in public. It's a minority but not of rabbeim who have actually looked deeply into the issue. The evidence against Eybeschuetz (a bunch of Sabbatean amulets, some Sabbatean students, Sabbatean children) is not absolute,  even if it is strong enough for academic purposes. Emden was undeniably correct about the vast majority of the figures he accused, of which the most prominent who is still widely cited in frum sefarim is the <em>Kitzur Shelah</em>. But nearly all have agreed for centuries that, no matter the truth of the matter, the viciousness of the dispute, which severely damaged the authority of the Ashkenazi rabbinate, was not worth it. A friend told me that in shiur R. Herschel Schachter compares the Yaavetz's zeal to the famous statement of Rebbi Yochanan: ענוותנותו של רבי זכריה בן אבקולס החריבה את ביתנו ושרפה את היכלנו והגליתנו מארצנו. I believe he meant that, even though the Yaavetz was correct in principle, larger considerations should have been taken into account. Plus, even if Emden was correct in his actions at the time, the chashash of widespread Sabbateanism is gone today. There are no longer Sabbatean sleeper sects in the yeshivos and no one, including Emden, ever said that there was anything wrong with Eybeshuetz's sefarim. All that rabbis could do now is stir things back up to no purpose (academics have a different role). So even if they agree that he was probably a Sabbatean, no one is going to make a fuss over it. R. Binyamin Hecht has a good formulation of this in <em>Livne Binyamin</em>, as I believe does R. Meir Mazuz in one of his books, though I couldn't locate it just now.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Have to add, because I praised rabbinic restraint on the issue, that I do not approve of a different trend, wherein our teachers pretend that Eybeschuetz sat passively while the Yaavetz and P'ne Yehoshua accused him. This appears in both works cited above and many, many others, but it is an utter fabrication. After the Yaavetz confronted him privately, Eybeschuetz forcibly closed the Yaavetz's shul and attempted to imprison him. He knowingly accused many honest people of various crimes in his selfish flailing to protect his career. His slim public output is best understood as a tactic, akin to a politician that hides in the hope that reporters will bore of a scandal instead of putting forward a falsifiable defense. We can say that, once Eybeschuetz had refused to resign quietly and attempted to strongarm the Yaavetz instead, and once it had become clear that Eybeschuetz would never submit to the judgement of a beis din, his accusers should have backed off instead of involving more authorities. But what really should have happened is Eybeschuetz should have openly confessed and done teshuva. Because he refused, there weren't any good choices available.</p>\n<p>To pick a recent example with an ongoing issue: Our rabbeim generally agree that R. Shmuel Eliyahu was correct to prosecute Chaim Walder even though he had prominent defenders who would make the process a massive chillul hashem. What level of chillul hashem would not be worth it? Probably even Zecharya ben Avqalos's would be -- lest we become <em>The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas</em>. To Emden, to the P'nei Yehoshua, rooting out Sabbateanism was a similar concern. It's difficult today to put ourselves in their shoes.</p>\n<p>But again: there's no threat today, so rabbis don't, and shouldn't, make a fuss over it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A critical reader on this issue are Rabbi Marvin S. Antelman's two volumes, To Eliminate The Opiate. The historical relevance remains more pertinent today than ever. The Sabbatean corrupting influence within Judaism remains a real and present danger to the neshama of the entire Jewish people. The entire existence of the reform and progressive movements owe their existence and purpose to the Sabbatean and Frankist conspirators. Eybeschutz's son, Wolf, came out as a self professed Sabbatean. Rabbi Emden was on the money. He still is.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gpK4S.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gpK4S.png\" alt=\"To Eliminate The Opiate Vol.1 \" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -8)\n\n<p>How do you define \"rabbi\"? If you are going to include non-Orthodox rabbis and the type of person who has semicha but always comes to conclusions that differ from everyone else (you can always find those types) then yes you can find rabbis who think Rav Eybeschutz was a shabbtaist.</p>\n<p>If you mean in the mainstream general orthodox community then no you won't find anyone taking that position. To put it slightly differently. No one who is learned enough that he  would learn the Seforim of Rav Yehonoson Eibsutz like the Urim V'Tumim or the Kreisi U'Plasi wouldn't do so over concerns of his being a Sabbetian. Those who would express such concerns are not in the habit of learning (or for the most part even capable of easily understanding)such works.</p>\n<p>They type of contemporary academics and rabbis who will tell you he was one are not so proficient in Kaballa that they are  able to assess or pass judgment on the personal defense that Rav Yehonoson Eibsutz gave that those who are insufficiently learned in Kabblah are misunderstanding him.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason is simple: Babylon deprived Judah of its status as a vassal state and made it into a governor-controlled territory.

    "content": "# Problem in the text of Kings and Chronicles\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was watching a video of an exegete in which he claimed that according to the Masoretic treatise Sefer Oklah we-Oklah in topic 168 in Ezra's corrections, there was a Tiqqun soferim in 1 Kings 12:16 and 2 Chronicles 10:16 in the Aleppo codices and Leningrad in which they changed the meaning of the expression “tents”, which were originally gods by modifying a consonant of place, stating that the copyists did not want the reader to feel compelled to idolatry by reading “To your gods, O Israel”. This same problem is found in 2 Samuel 20:1. Codex Cairensis also corroborates the passage of 1 Kings 12:16 being gods rather than tents through the massora regarding this text</p>\n<p>The exegete is not accusing ben Asher of misrepresentation but someone else has.</p>\n<p>Does Judaism recognize this situation and how do they respond to it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm not exactly sure what you mean by \"does Judaism recognize this situation\" since Ochlah v'Ochlah is an ancient Masoretic book (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36175&pgnum=115\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> is the relevant page, by the way), but there are a couple of old references to this linguistic switch. One is a Tannaitic midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.106.1?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on Nach 106</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"תני ר' שמעון בן יוחאי אומר...איש לאהליו ישראל ולא לבית המקדש, אל תקרי לאהליו אלא לאלוהיו.\"<br />\nSaid Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai...\"every man to his tents O Israel\" and not to the Temple, don't read \"to his tents\" but \"to his [Elohim]<sup>1</sup>\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another is much later, from the Rishonic period, by the Rashba (Teshuvot HaRashba, Mossad HaRav Kook edition, p. 182). During a discussion of 18 verses that were changed because <strong>scripture itself modified the language</strong> (כנה הכתוב - kinah hakatuv), he brings this verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אין לנו חלק בדוד ולא נחלה בבן ישי איש לאהליו ישראל. איש לאלוהיו היה צריך לומר אלא שכינה הכתוב.\"<br />\n\"“We have no portion in David, no share in Jesse’s son, every man to his tent, O Israel!” every man to his [Elohim]<sup>1</sup> was supposed to be said, but scripture modified the language.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does \"scripture modifying the language\" mean according to Rashba? He writes (p. 177):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וכן כתוב שם, י\"ח דברים כתובים במקרא ואינם כתובין כתקון, וחכמי ישראל קורין אותן תקון סופרים. לא שתקנו אותן, שמחקו וכתבו, אלא מה שכתב משה רבינו ע\"ה בתורה ומה שכתבו הנביאים בשאר ספרים, מתחלה מה שכתבוהו על כנוי כתבוהו. והסופרים לא חסרו ולא יתרו ורק ראוין להיקרות בכנוי כתבן.\"<br />\n\"And so it is written there (a certain book he was discussing), 18 things are written in Scripture and not written as corrections and the sages of Israel read them like scribal corrections. Not that they corrected them, i.e., that they erased and rewrote, but rather that what Moshe Rabbeinu peace be upon him wrote in the Torah and what the prophets wrote in other books, from the onset they wrote them in modified form. And the scribes did not add or detract and these [words] are only meant to be read as they were written (unlike other words, not in this group of 18, that are not read as written).\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, this is not a scribal correction but something that was implemented by the authors themselves.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I put in square brackets Elohim because the word is לאלוהיו - L'elohav and it's tricky to understand whether this means \"their gods\" or \"their God\", since God is referred to with the partially pluralistic Elokim many times over.</p>\n\n\n",

Amar Mar is translated by Steinsalz as \"The Master said.\" Who is this \"Mar\"/\"Master\"? Is there a \"stam Mar\" the same as there is a \"stam Rebbi\"? Or could it refer to multiple people? To further confuse matters (or me), sages named \"Mar [X]\" seem to always be amoraim, but at least in Chullin 94b:2, מר seems to refer to a tanna:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר מר ובעובד כוכבים בין שלימה בין חתוכה אינו צריך ליטול הימנה גיד הנשה במאי עסקינן אילימא במקום שמכריזין חתוכה אמאי אינו צריך ליטול הימנה גיד הנשה כיון דלא אכרוז אתי למיזבן מיניה</p>\n<p><b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And in</b> the case of one who sends a thigh to <b>a gentile</b>, regardless of <b>whether it is cut or whole he is not required to remove the sciatic nerve from it.</b> [etc.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.94b.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.94b.2?lang=bi</a></p>\n<p>First timer here, so please be gentle :)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Amar Mar in the gemarra is a reference to a previous speaker.

Mar is the Tana of the Berayita. When there is in the Berayita a foreign subject that was not the subject of the discussion and the Gemara wants to digress on this subject, the expression is Gufa Amar. as \"In the Berayita they say ...\".</p>\n\n\n",

And others say that Aḥer merely said: Had I a knife, I would have torn him apart.</p>\n<p>The Gemara relates: When Aḥer passed away, the Heavenly Court declared that he should not be judged, nor brought into the World-to-Come. He should not be judged in a manner befitting his deeds, because he occupied himself with Torah, whose merit protects him. And he should not be brought into the World-to-Come because he sinned.

    "content": "# Why are some royal mothers omitted from scripture?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the differences between the account of the Davidic kings and the non-Davidic kings in scripture is the inclusion of mothers for most of the Davidic kings. None of the non-Davidic kings have their mothers listed in the summary of their reigns, though in the case of Jeroboam we are told his mother's name at the time of his rebellion against Solomon (Kings 1.11.26) and Jehoram of Israel's mother is identified by Jehu as Jezebel (Kings 2.9.22). One wonders why mothers are provided for 18 of the 21 Davidic kings but not for David, Jehoram of Judah and Ahaz. One further wonders if this reason is the same reason no mothers are listed in the summaries of all non-Davidic kings.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The solution to this problem lies with Maacah daughter of Abishalom. Maacah serves as 'king's mother' first for her son Abijah of Judah and then for her grandson Asa of Judah. When Maacah strayed after idolatry, Asa removed her from her office (Kings 1.15.13). The prophet never tells us what office she occupied, but the most obvious option is the office of royal mother. Because royal mother was an office and not a biological status, Maacah could both occupy the office of royal mother for her grandson and subsequently be removed from that office even though it is obviously impossible to 'unmother' someone.\nOnce we accept that royal mother was an office and not a biological relationship, we can further suppose that this office only existed in the Davidic kingdom from Solomon's reign on and that this office was vacant for two of the Davidic kings (Jehoram and Ahaz).  This vacancy can be understood as occurring when there was no appropriate matriarch available due to death, misconduct or illness.</p>\n<p>In David's time the office had not been established yet. We might speculate that it was created by Solomon in recognition of Bathsheba's efforts to prevent succession controversy. Perhaps the prophet hints at the creation of a new office when he says about Solomon וישם כסא לאם המלך (Kings 1.2.19).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Excellent question.</p>\n<p>The issue is discussed <a href=\"http://havolim.blogspot.com/2019/11/the-mothers-of-kings-that-are-named-in.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> <em>(search for the text \"why in the list of the kings of the Northern Kingdom\")</em></p>\n<p>An answer is offered that the Ramban writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שהכתובים מזכירים במלכים שמות אמותם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That it's the norm to mention the the names of mothers of kings (seemingly out of honor to the king).</p>\n<p>The author of that blog posits that the Ramban's position is that non-Davidic kings don't have a real status of kings and therefore the name of the mother doesn't get mentioned.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>רמב\"ן בראשית מט:י</strong>\nהנה, שנו בכאן שאין מושחין מלכים מן הכהנים בני אהרן. ופירש תחלה שהוא לכבוד יהודה, שאין השררה סרה מן השבט ההוא. ולפיכך, אף על פי שישראל מקימים עליהם מלך משאר השבטים כפי צורך השעה, אין מושחים אותן שלא יהיה עליהם הוד מלכות <strong>אלא כמו שופטים ושוטרים יהיו</strong>. והזכירו הכהנים, שאף על פי שהן בעצמן ראויים למשיחה, אין מושחין אותן לשם מלכות, <strong>וכל שכן שאר השבטים</strong>, וכמו שאמרו בגמרא (הוריות יא) שאין מושחין אלא מלכי בית דוד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As an aside, the following image which lists <strong>all the occurrences of the phrase \"ושם אמו\" in Tanach</strong>.<br />\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/biotA.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/biotA.jpg\" alt=\"all the occurrences of the phrase \"ושם אמו\" in Tanach\" /></a></p>\n<p>An interesting pattern emerges (that I currently cannot explain) that <strong>\"שלם\"</strong> (highlighted) appears adjacent (or at least near) the phrase <strong>\"ושם אמו\"</strong>. The \"שלם\" appears within <strong>Shlomis</strong> bas Divri and <strong>Shlomo</strong> haMelech and Yeru<strong>shalayim</strong>.  This pattern appears in all but one occurrence.  That occurrence happens to be with Na'ama, the mother of Rechavam who, as can be seen, is already mentioned several pesukim earlier.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Books of Kings were written from the standpoint of Judah, not (northern) Israel. For these writers, the non-Davidic kings were not so important lineage-wise, because G-d had not promised these kings that their royal lineage would be unbroken. To quote Psalm 132:</p>\n<pre><code>The Lord swore to David a sure oath\n    from which he will not turn back:\n“One of the sons of your body\n    I will set on your throne.\nIf your sons keep my covenant\n    and my testimonies which I shall teach them,\ntheir sons also for ever\n    shall sit upon your throne.”\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also, whether the authors thought of the non-Davidic kings as legitimate or not, the details of these kings' lineages were not as well known to these writers, who were, themselves, citizens of the Kingdom of Judah. Indeed, the book directly refers the reader elsewhere for additional information. So we see, for example, in the case of King Ahab:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory\nhouse which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not\nwritten in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are at least 17 instances in the Books of Kings, in which the reader is referred to the \"Chronicles of the Kings of Israel\" for additional information about the non-Davidic king whose reign has just been summarized. It may well be that the names of the northern kings' mothers were listed there.</p>\n<p><strong>The simplest answer to the OP question is thus that the authors of the Books of Kings generally provided much less information about the kings of Israel than about the kings of Judah. The lineages of the latter were more important because of God's promise to David. Also, additional information was thought to be available to the reader in the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

First, he notes possible parallels in the terms \"כלת עולמים\" from a few of the Dead Sea Scrolls, \"אש עולמים\" from The Testament of Zebulun and \"אבדון עולם\" from The Psalms of Solomon, two apocryphal works. Analysis of all of the sources (as well as examples from 2nd century CE and later Targums such as Onkelos) shows that the term may have had a few meanings: a. Losing a place in the resurrection. b. Being cursed to be eternally lost. c. Being eternally annihilated. As can be seen, all three meanings are closely related.</p>\n<p>He then suggests a conceptual parallel in the words of Beit Shammai in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Sanhedrin.13.1?vhe=Tosefta_Sanhedrin_-_Machon_Mamre&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Sanhedrin 13:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"בית שמאי אומרים שלשה כתות הן אחת לחיי העולם הבא ואחת לחרפות לדראון עולם...אבל המסורות והאפיקורסין והכופרין בתורה ופורשים מדרכי צבור ושאין מודים בתחיית המתים וכל מי שחטא והחטיא את הרבים כגון ירבעם ואחאב ושנתנו חיתתם בארץ חיים ושפשטו ידיהם בזבול גיהנם ננעלת בפניהם ונדונין בה לדורי דורות...שאול כלה והם אינם כלים...\"<br />\n\"...Beit Shammai say: Three groups live on in the World to Come and one is cursed forever...but the [informers?]<sup>1</sup> and the heretics and those that deny the Torah and dissent from the ways of the public and do not believe in the resurrection and whoever sinned and caused others to sin such as Jeroboam and Ahab and caused fear in the land of the living and attacked the Temple, Gehinnom is locked before them and they are judged to be there forever and ever...Sheol becomes extinct and they do not extinct...\" (my translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, the term \"second death\" circa the 1st century CE referred to some form of post-death punishment. What this punishment was exactly was open to interpretation. Shapira also noted that some sources seem to view it as as an active punishment while others as a passive punishment. About how well-known the term was, Shapira notes (p. 15, n. 29) that some traditional Jewish sources from the Middle Ages and onwards, as well as some modern scholars postulate that the Aramaic Targums reflect the beliefs of the common Jews of circa the time of authorship of each of the Targums, so that means that the term מותא תנינא (second death) was very well-known.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I'm not entirely sure how to translate מסורות.

    "content": "# Writing a ה or ק half on a patch and half off\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When you need to patch a Torah, the practice is to write a letter either entirely on the original <em>klaf</em> or entirely on the patch, but not partly on one and partly on the other. See eg. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Keset_HaSofer.18.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Keset HaSofer 18:6</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובלבד שיכתוב כל האות על הטלאי. אבל אם כתב מקצת אות על היריעה ומקצתו על הטלאי פסול. ולא עוד אלא אפי' אם כתב כל האות כולו על היריעה אלא שמקצת הדיו מצד האחד של האות עובר גם על הטלאי לא מהני הקפת הגויל שבטלאי להאות שנכתב על היריעה אלא צריך להיות מוקף גויל ביריעה עצמה בלא טלאי. והאות הנכתב על הטלאי צריך להיות מוקף גויל בטלאי עצמו בלא היריעה:</p>\n<p>As long as you write the entire letter on the patch. But if you write half of a letter on the <em>klaf</em> and half on the patch, it's <em>pasul</em>. And not only that, but if you write the entire letter on the <em>klaf</em> but some of the ink on one side of the letter goes onto the patch, the \"surrounding by <em>klaf</em>\" from the patch is insufficient for the letter that's written on the <em>klaf</em> [that is, it's not considered as surrounded by blank <em>klaf</em>, as is required of every letter — <em>trans.</em>], but rather it needs to be entirely surrounded by <em>klaf</em> on the [original] <em>klaf</em> itself without the patch. And the letter written on the patch needs to be surrounded by <em>klaf</em> on the patch itself, without the [original] <em>klaf</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem seems to be one of <em>mukaf g'vil</em>, that each letter needs to be fully surrounded by blank <em>klaf</em>, and that the patch and the original <em>klaf</em> don't combine for this purpose. (There are other opinions, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Turei_Zahav_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.280.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taz YD 280:4</a>.)</p>\n<p>There are two letters, though, that consist of two parts, namely, the letters ה and ק. According to the opinion above that requires writing an entire letter either on the original <em>klaf</em> or entirely on the patch, is it permitted to write one piece of the ה/ק on the patch and the other piece on the original <em>klaf</em>?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Bris Milah vs Bris Periah and Deuteronomy 4\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Full disclosure I am not Jewish. This is (it sadly needs to be said) not meant to be anti-Semitic in any way, shape or form, but it's an honest question. I am not that familiar with the Talmud or oral law but I am pretty familiar with the Hebrew bible and am learning more every day.</p>\n<p>In Deuteronomy 4:1-2, in the English Standard Version, it is written:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the rules that I am\nteaching you, and do them, that you may live, and go in and take\npossession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is\ngiving you.  You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor\ntake from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God\nthat I command you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think the difference between Bris Milah and Bris Periah is commonly understood in Judaism and the view that Periah was added centuries later - not until the age of the Greeks and Romans- is not challenged. If I'm wrong, feel free to discuss, but consider consider Exodus 4:25 \"Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin\" ( i.e. just like that)</p>\n<p>I'm wondering [in an 'ask a Rabbi' fashion or something], learning as I have about the difference between Bris Milah Versus Bris Periah, how does Deuteronomy 4 and the prohibition against adding to the commands of God not apply here? It seems like a substantial addition to a commandment.</p>\n<p>That's my sole question and I don't want us to venture outside the narrow scope of the above, but if you're curious about my interest as a non-Jew, I consider myself to (very personally and inseverably) have skin in the game, precisely because I no longer have 'skin' in the game, otherwise I probably wouldn't even know what these things are.</p>\n<p>Thank you, Shalom and Simcha</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It seems that people use Joshua 5:2 as evidence that Periah was always a thing because of the command to circumcise the Israelites again before entering the promised land. I do not believe a plain reading of the text justifies this, if you read through to verse 8.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>4Now this is why he did so</em>: All those who came out of Egypt—all the\nmen of military age—died in the wilderness on the way after leaving\nEgypt. 5All the people that came out had been circumcised, but <em>all the\npeople born in the wilderness during the journey from Egypt had not</em>.\n6The Israelites had moved about in the wilderness forty years until\nall the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died,\nsince they had not obeyed the Lord. For the Lord had sworn to them\nthat they would not see the land he had solemnly promised their\nancestors to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 7So he\nraised up their sons in their place, and <em>these were the ones Joshua\ncircumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been\ncircumcised on the way</em> (NIV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't mean to be controversial but I don't know how it could be written more plainly in my translation.</p>\n\n\n",

It says explicitly in the text that Yonah peace be upon him had a book which included many prophecies and stories. We know this from that which is stated in the Book of Kings, that he prophesied about Yerov'am ben Yoash King of Israel, as it is written: \"in accordance with the promise that the LORD, the God of Israel, had made through His servant, the prophet Jonah son of Amitai from Gath-hepher\"  (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.14.25?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kings 2:14:25</a>).

The yetzer hora means literally an inclination for bad. What does “ bad ” mean? “ Bad ” means contrary to Torah and mitzvos. Every Jew has a yetzer hora according to the strength of his Nefesh HaBahamis. The Nefesh HaBahamis is strong in everybody because they are born with a Nefesh HaBahamis. <strong>The Nefesh HoElokis requires cultivation</strong>. The yetzer hora will be as strong as a man is at any point of time in his life. The Nefesh HoElokis of a Jew spawns the yetzer tov (Good Inclination), the desire to do good.

Behold you have learned that they are suspended by the word of the King. — [Gen. Rabbah 4:3]\"</p>\n<p>And in verse 7</p>\n<p>\"above the expanse: It does not say, “on the expanse,” but “above the expanse,” because they [the waters] are suspended in the air (Mid. Ps. 19:4)\"</p>\n<p>So Rashi seems to say that the sky is the physical sky, and says the water is physical water. The explanation is difficult for me to understand.</p>\n<p>What exactly does it mean?</p>\n<p>Does it mean that there's the ocean, then the distance from the ocean to \"outer space\", (which is the \"sky\", or the \"expanse\"), then after the \"sky\" there's more empty space, then water surrounding all of that, and in that final expanse of empty space (equal to the distance from the ocean to the beginning of the \"sky\"), the words of \"the king\" are in it, keeping the water afloat, or does it mean that the words of G-d are in the heavens themselves?</p>\n<p>But if so then where are the upper waters?</p>\n<p>Directly above the physical \"heavens\", or still above the empty space above the heavens?</p>\n<p>Seemingly, if Rashi means that the words of the \"king\" are in the \"empty space above the expanse\" (if that is indeed what it means), then the reason why the word of the king wouldn't be in the heavens themselves (as opposed to the empty space above it), would seem to be because of what Rashi said earlier, that the sky iself \"thickened\", in Rashi's words (earlier in verse 6):</p>\n<p>\"Let there be an expanse: Let the expanse be strengthened, for, although the heavens were created on the first day, they were still moist, and they solidified on the second [day] from the rebuke of the Holy One, blessed be He, when He said, “Let there be an expanse.” This is what Scripture says (Job 26:11): “The pillars of the heavens trembled” the entire first day, and on the second day: “They were astonished by His rebuke,” like a person who stands in astonishment because of the rebuke of the one who frightens him. [Genesis Rabbah 12:10]\"</p>\n<p>Which would imply the sky itself doesn't need the word, because it's thick, only the empty space above it would need the word.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if this is the explanation, but if so then a further question may arise, regarding what it means according to the Bal Shem Tov's explanation, on the verse in tehillin, in Shaar Hayichud vihaemunah chapter 1, that \"forever your word stands in the heavens\", implying the words are in the heavens themselves.</p>\n<p>Although on the other hand, the fact that they solidified \"because of the rebuke\" of Hashem, could also imply that the \"words of the king\" are in it itself, which gives it thickness.</p>\n<p>But if so then how would that fit with the next Rashi in verse 6, that seemingly implied that first there's the lower waters (ocean), then empty space above them, to the beginning of the \"expanse\", then the expanse itself, then other empty space, then the upper waters?</p>\n<p>Further\nAs mentioned earlier, that would imply that the word is in the second empty space, <em>above</em> the expanse (keeping afloat the \"upper waters\" that is even above that. Because if the word wouldn't be in the second empty space itself, then what would keep the waters floating <em>above</em> it?)</p>\n<p>In addition, if the \"thickness\" of the heavens would be from the \"word\" of rebuke, then what would be the difference between the heavens themselves and the empty space above it (and Rashi implies they're two separate entities)?</p>\n<p>So basically, what is the simple meaning of the \"upper waters\", where are they themselves, and where are the \"words of the king\" that they are hanging on?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rashi seems to be operating under a metaphor that was well understood in the ancient and medieval world.</p>\n<p>The idea is that the sky is a physical boundary, like a Dome over the outside of the earth. This is referred to in English as the firmament, רָקִיעַ in Hebrew. God has the ability, metaphorically, to open or close the valves of the firmament, allowing rain above the firmament to fall.</p>\n<p>Rashi did not have access to modern understanding of the world, cosmology, the water cycle, etc., so was likely using most appropriate metaphor available to him.</p>\n<p>This idea is referred to throughout Tanakh, c.f. Gen 7:11, Lev 26:19, Deu 28:12, Mal 3:10, Job 26:11, etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The atmosphere between earth and outer space is considered to be heaven as seen in Rashi to Genesis 1:6.\nOuter space is also considered to be heaven as seen in Genesis 1:14. That there are “aish and mayim” in the atmosphere is evidenced by weather phenomena such as rain and lightning. There are also “mayim” and “aish” in outer space, at the very least as of the fourth day of creation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>After much thought and reviewing the pshat:</p>\n<p>Rashi says clearly that the sun, moon and all stars are \"inside\" the rakia (sky). That would mean, simply, that that which is \"above\" the sky, would be above that which all of the stars are in.</p>\n<p>Given that Rashi never gives a specific measurement for how thick the rakia is, according to pshat and our modern observations, it's safe to say that these \"upper Waters\" physically exist outside the entire known universe, surrounding it from all sides.</p>\n\n\n",

Alternatively, the meaning of the word ה-אלוקים is a reference to G’d, Himself, not an intermediary. The reason why he used the plural mode נגלו instead of נגלה when the subject is only G’d Himself, is that this is a form of great respect and honour for the subject [known as pluralis majestatis when a king refers to himself in the plural. Ed.] compare Psalms 149,2 ישמח ישראל בעושיו, “Let Israel rejoice in its Maker.” A similar construction is found in Job 35,10 איה אלו-ה עושי?, “Where is the Lord, My Maker?” There are more such examples in Scripture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Targum Yonatan reads, \"אִתְגְלִיאוּ לֵיהּ מַלְאָכַיָא דַיְיָ\" explaining the plural.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rebbi Yochanan (b.

This transformation is מצפץ which is gematria 300 or ש.

he is considered to have done so, for the Reader discharges his obligation for him.</p>\n<p>The Gemara8 notes this in reference to “the people in the fields,” who are considered to be under duress, and fulfill their obligation of reciting the Shemoneh Esreh prayer itself, and not only of participating in the responses of Barchu and Kedushah, with the Reader’s repetition, as if they had actually heard it from him.</p>\n<p>וְכִדְאִיתָא בַּגְּמָרָא גַּבֵּי עַם שֶׁבַּשָּׂדוֹת דַּאֲנִיסֵי, וְיוֹצְאִים יְדֵי חוֹבַת תְּפִלַּת שְׁמוֹנֶה עֶשְׂרֵה עַצְמָהּ בַּחֲזָרַת הַשְּׁלִיחַ־צִבּוּר כְּאִלּוּ

longevity.</p>\n<p>It is even more emphatically true at this time, in the period just preceding the advent of Mashiach, when our Torah study is not constant because of the difficulty of our times.</p>\n<p>וּמִכָּל שֶׁכֵּן עַתָּה הַפַּעַם בְּעִקְּבוֹת מְשִׁיחָא, שֶׁאֵין תּוֹרָתֵינוּ קֶבַע, מִצּוֹק הָעִתִּים,</p>\n<p>The primary service in the period just preceding the coming of Mashiach is prayer, as Rabbi Chaim Vital (of blessed memory) writes in Etz Chaim and Pri Etz Chaim.10</p>\n<p>וְעִיקַּר הָעֲבוֹדָה בְּעִקְּבוֹת מְשִׁיחָא הִיא הַתְּפִלָּה, כְּמוֹ שֶׁכָּתַב הָרַב חַיִּים

understand the efficacy of at least a little profoundly considered meditation, each according to his measure,</p>\n<p>וְהִיא חוֹבָה שֶׁל תּוֹרָה מַמָּשׁ, לִמְבִינֵי מַדָּע – תּוֹעֶלֶת הַהִתְבּוֹנְנוּת וְעוֹמֶק הַדַּעַת קְצָת, כָּל חַד לְפוּם שִׁיעוּרָא דִילֵיהּ,</p>\n<p>In some individuals, as discussed in the Tanya, Part I, ch. 41, a feeling of love or awe of G‑d will be aroused by a brief effort of meditation and in others only by a deeper and longer stretch of meditation.</p>\n<p>in the ordered enumeration of the praises of G‑d, blessed be He,11 in Pesukei Dezimrah and in the two blessings preceding Shema, viz., Yotzer (Yotzer Or) and Ahavah (Ahavat Olam),</p>\n<p>בְּסִדּוּר שְׁבָחוֹ שֶׁל מָקוֹם בָּרוּךְ־הוּא בִּפְסוּקֵי דְזִמְרָה וּשְׁתֵּי בְרָכוֹת שֶׁלִּפְנֵי קְרִיאַת־שְׁמַע – \"יוֹצֵר\" וְ\"אַהֲבָה\"</p>\n<p>in order to arouse through [these blessings] the love latent in the heart of every Jew so that it attain a state of revelation in the openness of the heart during Keriat Shema itself, which follows these two blessings.</p>\n<p>לְעוֹרֵר בָּהֶן הָאַהֲבָה הַמְסוּתֶּרֶת בְּלֵב כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל, לָבֹא לִבְחִינַת גִּילּוּי בְּהִתְגַּלּוּת הַלֵּב בִּשְׁעַת קְרִיאַת־שְׁמַע עַצְמָהּ,</p>\n<p>This is the meaning of the commandment of love that appears in the verse, “And you shall love [the L-rd your G‑d] with all your heart…,”12 that is reckoned first13 among the 613 mitzvot.</p>\n<p>שֶׁזֹּאת הִיא מִצְוַת הָאַהֲבָה שֶׁבַּפָּסוּק: \"וְאָהַבְתָּ גוֹ' בְּכָל לְבָבְךָ גוֹ'\", הַנִּמְנֵית רִאשׁוֹנָה בְּתַרְיַ\"ג מִצְוֹת,</p>\n<p>Thus, the Rambam, of blessed memory, writes14 that this is a fundament of the Torah and its root and the source of all 248 positive commands.</p>\n<p>כְּמוֹ שֶׁכָּתַב הָרַמְבַּ\"ם זִכְרוֹנוֹ לִבְרָכָה, שֶׁהִיא מִיסוֹדֵי הַתּוֹרָה וְשָׁרְשָׁהּ וּמָקוֹר לְכָל רַמַ\"ח מִצְוֹת עֲשֵׂה,</p>\n<p>Concerning these commandments, the Alter Rebbe states in the Tanya, Part I, ch. 4, “For he who fulfills them in truth is he who loves G‑d’s Name.”</p>\n<p>This commandment—“And you shall love”—is the obligation imposed by the Torah to meditate during prayer in order to arouse and reveal one’s latent love. As to the emotion of love itself, a commandment is obviously impossible and irrelevant: if one has it, he has it, and if not, no command is going to produce it.</p>\n<p>Thus, in reply to the question, “How is it possible to mandate love?”, the Maggid of Mezritch points out15 that the subject of the command is not the love but the meditation that will assuredly lead one to experiencing it. When one considers (“Hear, O Israel”16) how “the L-rd is our G‑d, the L-rd is one,” one will surely come to love Him. The key verb (Ve’ahavta) is thus not to be understood as a command (“You shall love”) but as an assurance (“You will love”).</p>\n<p>For regarding the love latent in the heart of all Israel by birth and nature, there can be no command at all, for it already exists.</p>\n<p>כִּי עַל אַהֲבָה הַמְסוּתֶּרֶת בְּלֵב כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּתוֹלַדְתָּם וְטִבְעָם, לֹא שַׁיָּיךְ צִיוּוּי כְּלָל.</p>\n<p>Rather, the command is that this latent love be revealed and moreover that it be felt not only by the G‑dly soul but by the animating soul as well, which previously did not harbor it at all.</p>\n<p>This is apparent to the understanding,</p>\n<p>וְדַעַת לְנָבוֹן נָקָל,</p>\n<p>that while the love is concealed, it is still lodged within the Divine soul alone.</p>\n<p>כִּי כְּשֶׁהָאַהֲבָה הִיא מְסוּתֶּרֶת – הִיא עוֹדֶינָּה בַּנֶּפֶשׁ הָאֱלֹקִית לְבַדָּהּ,</p>\n<p>Only when it attains to a state of revelation in the animating soul is it revealed in the heart in the left chamber, the abode of the animating soul.17</p>\n<p>וּכְשֶׁבָּאָה לִבְחִינַת גִּילּוּי לַנֶּפֶשׁ הַחִיּוּנִית אֲזַי הִיא בְּהִתְגַּלּוּת הַלֵּב בְּחָלָל שְׂמָאלִי, מְקוֹם מִשְׁכַּן נֶפֶשׁ הַחִיּוּנִית.</p>\n<p>Since this soul animates the entire body, the person as a whole will be permeated with this love.</p>\n<p>This is the meaning of the “elevation of the sparks” mentioned there in Etz Chaim and Pri Etz Chaim10 in reference to prayer: through prayer, one elevates the sparks of holiness that fell from Tohu.</p>\n<p>וְזֶהוּ עִנְיַן בֵּירוּר נִיצוֹצוֹת הַמּוּזְכָּר שָׁם בְּעֵץ חַיִּים וּפְרִי עֵץ חַיִּים גַּבֵּי תְּפִלָּה,</p>\n<p>And for this reason, prayer is the primary service in the period just preceding the coming of Mashiach—in order to seek out and elevate the sparks, and so on.</p>\n<p>שֶׁלָּכֵן הִיא עִיקַּר הָעֲבוֹדָה בְּעִקְּבוֹת מְשִׁיחָא, לְבָרֵר נִיצוֹצוֹת כוּ',</p>\n<p>This may take place either through the transformation18 or the subjugation of the animal soul to the Divine soul, as is known.</p>\n<p>שֶׁהוּא בְּחִינַת אִתְהַפְּכָא אוֹ אִתְכַּפְיָא שֶׁל נֶפֶשׁ הַחִיּוּנִית לְנֶפֶשׁ הָאֱלֹקִית כַּנּוֹדָע,</p>\n<p>“For the blood is the soul…”19 and hence the life-force of man, and the blood is renewed daily through food and drink,</p>\n<p>\"כִּי הַדָּם הוּא הַנֶּפֶשׁ כוּ'\", וְהַדָּם מִתְחַדֵּשׁ בְּכָל יוֹם מֵאוֹכָלִין וּמַשְׁקִין,</p>\n<p>By directing his eating and drinking to the holy goals of the Divine soul, one refines and elevates the sparks found within the food and drink.</p>\n<p>and [the man] is affected and improved by his garments and his shelter, and so on.</p>\n<p>וְגַם מִתְפָּעֵל וְנִתְקָן מִמַּלְבּוּשִׁים וְדִירָה כוּ'.</p>\n<p>The refinement of the sparks latent in all these physical things is effected by revealing one’s innate love of G‑d during prayer. In our days, prolonged prayer and meditation are thus a necessity.</p>\n<p>It was different, however, in earlier generations, when the Divine souls were of a higher order,</p>\n<p>מַה־שֶּׁאֵין־כֵּן בַּדּוֹרוֹת הָרִאשׁוֹנִים, שֶׁהָיוּ נִשְׁמוֹת הָאֱלֹקִית גְּדוֹלֵי הָעֵרֶךְ,</p>\n<p>and the refinement and elevation of the sparks were instantaneous by means of Keriat Shema alone20 and the blessings preceding it, and the abridged Pesukei Dezimrah, and so on.21</p>\n<p>הָיָה הַבֵּירוּר נַעֲשֶׂה כְּרֶגַע בִּקְרִיאַת־שְׁמַע לְבַד וּבְרָכוֹת שֶׁלְּפָנֶיהָ וּפְסוּקֵי דְזִמְרָה בִּקְצָרָה וְכוּ',</p>\n<p>These prayers alone then sufficed to reveal the Jew’s love of G‑d and brought about the resulting beirurim of the sparks.</p>\n<p>This will suffice for the discerning.</p>\n<p>וְדַי לַמֵּבִין:\"</p>\n\n\n",

Surely Nahor was similarly aged & Milcah a grown woman. Why then did Abraham need to recieve news that 'Milcah is also a mother?' Were these sons not born before Abraham left his father's house? Even if they weren't, the youngest of them would've likely been teenagers when Abraham got this message, given the fact that Akedah took place between 40 and 60 years after Abraham left Haran.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It is because following the akeida, Avraham realised that Yitzchak became very close to being killed which would have ended both Avraham's bloodline and legacy. Therefore, he started thinking through potential spouse options for Yitzchak that would meet his criteria (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.20?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.22.20.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachya</a>), which is why he starts reviewing his family now.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.20?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.22.20.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אחרי הדברים האלה AFTER THESE THINGS [IT WAS TOLD ABRAHAM] etc. — When he returned from Mount Moriah Abraham was pondering and he said, “If my son had really been slain, he would have died without children! I must marry him to one of the daughters of Aner or Eshcol or Mamre”. The Holy One, blessed be He, therefore had the announcement made to him that Rebecca, the one fit to be his (Isaac’s) consort, had been born. This is what is meant by “after these things or words” — namely, “after the words” that expressed the thoughts aroused by the Binding of Isaac (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.57.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis Rabbah 57:3</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Also refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.20?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Bekhor_Shor%2C_Genesis.22.20.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bechor Shor</a>)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.20?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Ibn_Ezra_on_Genesis.22.20.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> adds when he mentions Milkah it is to hone in on Rivka's pedigree.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BEHOLD, MILKAH, SHE ALSO HATH BORNE.

Since Milcah was the daughter of his brother Haran, this was a tiding to Abraham that his older brother Nahor had been visited with many children from the daughter of his dead brother Haran. Now from the text of Scripture it would appear that Abraham had no knowledge of any of them except on that day. If they were visited with children in their younger days, it would be impossible for them not to have been heard until this time for the distance between Mesopotamia and the land of Canaan is not great. Now when Abraham left Haran he was seventy-five years old, and Nahor was also elderly and his wife too was not young. Indeed, we must say, G-d performed a miracle for them in that they were visited with children in their old age. This is the sense of the verse, Milcah, she also. In the words of our Rabbis, it is said that Milcah was visited with children as was her sister Sarah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, this is in order to make the wicked accountable for destroying a world that was created with ten utterances, and to reward the righteous for sustaining a world that was created with ten utterances.</code></p>\n<p>The question is, the Mishnah first prefaces that the, seemingly, <em>main</em> reason why the world was created with ten statements is in order to \"pay back\" (or \"make accountable\" according to this translation) from the wicked who \"destroy\" the world that was made with ten statements, then, as if as an added reason, it says that it's <em>also</em> to give reward to the righteous.</p>\n<p>Now, even though at first Hashem wanted to create the world with judgement, and only afterwards combined the attribute of mercy (as <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165/showrashi/true/jewish/Chapter-1.htm#v1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> brings, to the beginning of Bereishis), but that was only before creation started, but the actual creation itself is built on mercy (and <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380404/jewish/A-World-of-Kindness.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kindness</a>).</p>\n<p>So the obvious question is, why would the Mishnah start off by focusing on the punishment of the wicked, and only afterwards, as if to add some side reason for making the world in ten statements, that it's also to give reward to the righteous?</p>\n<p>Shouldn't the main stress be that it's to give reward to the righteous, who sustain the world, except that in order to allow for free choice, keep people in check etc., there's <em>also</em> the idea of punishment/accountability?</p>\n<p>Shouldn't the first thing mentioned stress the main point of creation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe has a beautiful <a href=\"https://chabadlibrary.org/books/1301410066\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explanation</a> of this Mishna according to Chassidus. It's a lot to pack in here, but I'll try to summarize it briefly:</p>\n<p>The \"ten utterances\" correspond to the ten Sefirot which are the basis of the worlds and our souls, representing the structure—as well as the limitations—of our reality. Now, G-d didn't have to build the world with a decimal architecture or in any particular way—He simply chose it to be the way it is. The ability to create the world with a \"single utterance\" symbolizes G-d's total transcendence of even the most fundamental components of creation.</p>\n<p>Correspondingly, in our divine service we have dual modes of righteousness and repentance. The righteous sustain the natural order of the world through Torah learning and fulfilling Mitzvot, but because they work within the rules, they are also limited by them. By contrast, the repentant person who rises above his nature to rediscover his innate connection to G-d can elevate <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.34b.22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">himself</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.86b.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">world</a> in ways the righteous cannot.</p>\n<p>This is what the Mishna is teaching us, and why it emphasizes the first clause. The word להפרע literally means \"to exact payment.\" What G-d wants from the wicked is not retribution, it's repayment. That is, the wicked who \"destroy\" the world are held \"accountable\" to rebuild it through repentance, which \"destroys\" the limitations of the world and the soul, revealing the unbounded G-dliness beneath it all.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It says in your own quote of the mishna, 'what does this come to teach us.' It makes sense to begin with teaching about punishment before reward. We see in many places that wisdom starts with the fear of heaven/G-d. Loving G-d is an even higher ideal but comes after achieving the more basic level of fear of heaven. this is what comes comes to mind for me when seeing your question.</p>\n<p>There is many references for the idea that fear comes first which this mishna would just be showing consistency with. I will just give some references and this is not at all an exhaustive list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You quoted pirkei avot chapter 5, well pirkei avot chapter 3 mishna 11 shows fear of sin preceeding wisdom.</li>\n<li>Proverbs 9:10, \"The beginning of wisdom is fear of the L-rd..)'</li>\n<li>Proverbs 1:7 \"The fear of the L-rd is the beginning of knowledge..)'</li>\n<li>Psalm 111:10, \"The beginning of wisdom is fear of the L-rd..\"</li>\n<li>note fear mentioned first and awe after here in Psalm 33:8, \"Let all the earth fear the L-rd; let all the inhabitants of the earth stand in awe of Him'</li>\n<li>note here fear comes before desire in Psalm 112:1, \"Hallelujah. Praiseworthy is the man who fears the L-rd, who greatly desires his commandments.'</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course the purpose of creating the world is for kindness and mercy. The order of this mishna does not change that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The answer is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.8.5?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Sanhedrin 8:5:</a> <em>This is because the death of the wicked is beneficial to them, because they can no longer sin, and it is also beneficial to the world, which is now rid of those who do it harm.</em> In other words, punishment of the wicked is an act of mercy.</p>\n<p>As far as the attitude of G-d towards the punishment, we have the words of prophet <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.33.11?ven=The_Holy_Scriptures:_A_New_Translation_(JPS_1917)&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 33:11</a> which we quote during <em>yamim noraim</em>:\n\"Say unto them: As I live, saith the Lord G-D, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?\"</p>\n\n\n",

It consists of multiple volumes and in volume 1 (The Creators of the Mishna), there is a chapter called <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/The_Jewish_Spiritual_Heroes%2C_Volume_I%3B_The_Creators_of_the_Mishna%2C_The_Three_Main_Parties_of_the_Talmudic_Period%3B_The_Pharisees%2C_The_Sadducees%2C_The_Essenes?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Three Main Parties of the Talmudic Period; The Pharisees, The Sadducees, The Essenes\"</a>. There it writes how a person became a member of the \"Pharisee society\". The society was not closed, and everyone could enter, provided they did what Bader writes below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any person could join if he promised, in the presence of three members, to observe the rules of the organization which concentrated on cleanliness and ablutions. It is interesting to note that in accepting a new member no distinction was made between a scholar and an uneducated person. Both were considered of equal worth and any person who was willing to assume the burdens of Pharisaism could join the society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, Bader writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As soon as a person became a member of the Pharisee society he undertook to serve G-d with his whole life. Such a person had to believe that G-d’s eye is all-seeing and that He observes all man’s acts in order to judge them for every injustice. Since man possesses a free will to do as he chooses he is held responsible for every act and he will have to account for his deeds before his Creator. The Pharisees also believed that God sometimes issues decrees governing nations or all of humanity and that such decrees may seem unreasonable to the victims. But such decrees are certainly just since G-d is just to the individual as well as to a group. If it appears that reward for good deeds or punishment for wrong doing is delayed, then one must remember that there is a reckoning after death, or later yet, when the dead will be resurrected, the deserving ones to eternal life and the evil ones to everlasting shame and suffering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is also worth noting what Bader writes on the meaning of the word Pharisee, which in Hebrew is translated as פרושים- \"Perushim\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since the Pharisees deeply understood the spirit of the Torah, they gave up the search for pleasure in life even as they avoided pride or any action which might seem immoral. They practiced brotherly love toward one another and each individual sought with all his might to avoid temptation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"They gave up the search for pleasure\" - an explanation of this can be found in the famous explanation on the Torah by Nachmanides, the Ramba<strong>n</strong>.</p>\n<p>------------ Side Note ----------------</p>\n<p>The Ramban <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Leviticus.19.2.2?vhe=On_Your_Way_New&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>YE SHALL BE HOLY. “Abstain from the forbidden sexual relationships [mentioned in the preceding section] and from [other] sin, because wherever you find [in the Torah] a warning to guard against immorality, you find the mention of ‘holiness.’” This is Rashi’s language. But in the Torath Kohanim I have seen it mentioned without any qualification [i.e., without any particular reference to immorality, as Rashi expressed it], saying: “Be self-restraining.” Similarly, the Rabbis taught there: “And ye shall sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy, for I am Holy. Just as I am Holy, so be you holy. Just as I am Pure, so be you pure.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramban then connects this idea to the perushim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And in my opinion, this abstinence does not refer only to restraint from acts of immorality, as the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote, but it is rather the self-control mentioned throughout the Talmud, which confers upon those who practice it the name of P’rushim (Pharisees), [literally: “those who are separated” from self-indulgence, as will be explained, or those who practice self-restraint].\nThe meaning thereof is as follows: The Torah has admonished us against immorality and forbidden foods, but permitted sexual intercourse between man and his wife, and the eating of [certain] meat and wine. If so, a man of desire could consider this to be a permission to be passionately addicted to sexual intercourse with his wife or many wives, and be among winebibbers, among gluttonous eaters of flesh,11 and speak freely all profanities, since this prohibition has not been [expressly] mentioned in the Torah, and thus he will become a sordid person within the permissible realm of the Torah!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/5413731/jewish/page.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>, where the Lubavitcher Rebbe writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה ידועה השאלה מהו תוכן הציווי קדושים תהיו והחידוש בו, כי הרי זהו ענין התורה בכללותה ומצותי' וענין כל אחד ואחד מציוויי התורה. והביאור בזה, אשר הציווי הוא בדבר כללי, שנהי' פרושים מן המותרות, אע\"פ שלא הוזהרנו מהם בתורה ולא נאסרו עלינו, יזהיר שנהי' נקיים טהורים ופרושים מהם.</p>\n<p>ולכאורה יאמר האדם ובפרט בעשותו חשבון צדק בנפשו ויעריך מצבו אליבי'\nדנפשי' - דייך מה שאסרה תורה, והלואי שיקיים כל ציווי התורה המפורשים,\nאלו שהן מדאורייתא, מדרבנן ועד לדקדוק קל של דברי סופרים וחומרות\nהאחרונים. ורק מי שכבר הגיע לדרגא זו - עליו להתעסק בעבודה הנעלית הזו -\nפרושים מן המותרות.</p>\n<p>[...] that we abstain from luxuries, even though we were not warned about them in the Torah and were not forbidden to us</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There is a Machlokes  in the shach and Taz there. Without getting into too much detail, The Shach seems to rule that one could put a dry hot food or a cold wet food on a treif kli. This would seem to indicate that one could use a treif countertop so long as he is careful to never allow anything to touch that could absorb from the countertop (namely hot wet food). However he ends with a caveat: מיהו כל זה בדרך עראי אבל אם בא להשתמש בהן דרך קבע אפילו צונן אסור גזירה שמא ישתמש בהן חמין.  “All that he said above was only for temporary use, but to use it on a consistent basis would be forbidden as a decree that he may come to use the kli in a forbidden fashion.”</p>\n<p>I would think that this would apply here.

Anyway, is there any discussion about this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are several mefarshim (commentators) who discuss the idea of \"secret things\".</p>\n<p>The Ibn Ezra <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.29.28?lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The reference is to one who serves idols in secret.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BELONG UNTO THE LORD OUR GOD. Its meaning is that his punishment is in the hands of God, and the Lord will exact punishment from him. However, if the sin was committed in public there is an obligation on us and our children to do in accordance with that which is written in the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.29.28?lang=bi&with=Chizkuni&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> builds on this idea and says it refers to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“sins committed in the privacy of one’s home, (which could not be witnessed and brought to court) will be taken care of by the Lord our G-d;” this had to be stated specifically in light of what we read in verse 18 about individuals who feel safe from punishment for their personal sins in periods when the community at large is Torahobservant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Chizkuni says the revealed things refer to the sins commited in public:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנגלות, ”but the sins committed publicly, etc,” dealing with deliberate sins committed in full view of the public must be dealt with by the judiciary by both you and your children, as otherwise such phenomena cannot be eradicated from your midst. This law becomes effective from the moment the Jewish people will cross the river Jordan. From that moment on their acceptance of the covenant with G-d meant that each individual Jew shared in the responsibility for the conduct of each fellow Jew. From that moment on we also became responsible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shadal, in Sefer Yesodei HaTorah similary <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.29.28?lang=bi&with=Sefer%20Yesodei%20HaTorah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The retribution mentioned in the Torah is collective and individual — to the people in general and to each Israelite in particular. To the people in general — for open transgressions; and to each individual — for those committed in secret. For the will of the Giver of the Torah was to make all of Israel responsible for one another, this being a potent means of impeding the spread of subversion and corruption in the people. For, G-dly retribution being to the people collectively, it follows that if one sees his neighbor corrupting his ways, he will not say \"What business is it of mine?\", but he will reprove him. And if he continues sinning, he will testify against him in beth-din, which will punish him. \"And all the people will hear and fear.\" Therefore, the blessings and curses (in the Torah) are to the nation in general.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, to summarize the mefarshim mentioned above. The <strong>hidden things</strong> refer to sins that are committed in the privacy of one's home, as the Chizkuni wrote. Other people won't see that a person sins, and won't be able to reprimand. However, the revealed things, e.g. sins that were commited in public, people are able to reprimand one another for that.</p>\n\n\n",

He then goes on to explain why Rashi reject this view of the Midrash, saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rashi was troubled by an implicit contradiction in verse 10: \"In his hand was all his master's belongings\". Surely, the very definition of a master is a person who is rich in belongings? If Avraham had indeed given all his belongings away to Eliezer, then in what respect was he still a master over Eliezer? [...] To solve this, Rashi answered that Avraham gave his possesions, not to Eliezer, but to Yitzchak.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rebbe then goes on to build further on the idea why Rashi rejects the Midrashic idea that a will was given:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Since this would not have made an immediate impression on Lavan and Besu'el, since it was likely that many years would pass before Yitzchak would inherit the money.</strong> Similary, Avraham gave Eliezer all his possesions, in order to guarantee as speedy a  response as possible from Lavan's family. <strong>As for Avraham's own financial situation, we could presume that either: a) Yitzchak supported him, thus fulfilling the mitzvah of honoring one's parents</strong>, or, b) He sought means of making money.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nachmanides, the Ramban, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.10?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> in his commentary on Bereishis 24:10 that \"all the goods of his master in his hand\" refers to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All the best and superior kinds [of food] - fruits and delicacies- from all that was found in Damascus</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the Ramban seems to say that it does not refer to money, but to the choicest of foods of that geographical location, Damascus.</p>\n<p>The Or HaChaim, in his commentary <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.10?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Or%20HaChaim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> a familiair thing as the Ramban, but does not connect it to food:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכל טוב אדוניו, \"and all the good things of his master,\" - Eliezer took the choicest of all the precious possessions of Abraham.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another fascinating insight, this time a kabbalistic one, is given by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.10?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Shenei%20Luchot%20HaBerit&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shelah (Torah Shebikhtav, Chayei Sara, Torah Ohr 54)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the Torah (Genesis 24,10) describes Eliezer as having כל טוב אדוניו בידו, \"all the good of his master in his hand,\" this refers to the angel Mattatron who accompanied him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, you ask:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So why did Avraham give \"everything he had\" for this mission?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Or HaChaim explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This was in order to persuade the girl in the event that she would initially refuse to move away from her parental home.

The movements were: the Pharisees, the Saducees and the Essenes.</p>\n<p>There are many differences between these three parties, but the main difference between the Pharisees, and the Saducees is, according to Bader:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The primary difference between the Sadducees and the Pharisees consisted in that the Sadducees rejected the oral law which was accepted by the Pharisees. They maintained that only the written law of the Torah was binding upon men. In rejecting the traditions of the Pharisees, they refused to believe in the resurrection of the dead, which is not explicitly promised in the Torah. They ridiculed the Pharisees for the latter’s belief in the immortality of the soul and in a life after death and made fun of the notion that the souls of the pious will rest under the throne of glory. Another subject of their humor was the Pharisees’ readiness to endure suffering in the hope of being rewarded in life to come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, in the US, today, there are three major movements of Judaism: Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox.</p>\n<p><strong>Reform</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reform Judaism does not believe that the Torah was written by God.\nThe movement accepts the critical theory of Biblical authorship:  that\nthe Bible was written by separate sources and redacted together.\nReform Jews do not believe in observance of commandments as such, but\nthey retain much of the values and ethics of Judaism, along with some\nof the practices and the culture.  The original, basic tenets of\nReform Judaism in the USA were set down in the Pittsburgh Platform.\nMany non-observant, nominal, and/or agnostic Jews identify themselves\nas Reform simply because Reform is the most liberal movement, but that\nis not really a fair reflection on the movement as a whole.  There are\nabout 800 Reform synagogues in the US with approximately 2 million\nmembers.  For more information about Reform Judaism, see The Union for\nReform Judaism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Conservative</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conservative Judaism grew out of the tension between Orthodoxy and Reform.  It was formally organized as the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism by Dr. Solomon Schechter in 1913, although its roots in the Jewish Theological Seminary of America stretch back into the 1880s.  Conservative Judaism generally accepts the binding nature of halakhah, but believes that the Law should change and adapt, absorbing aspects of the predominant culture while remaining true to Judaism's values.  In our experience, there is a great deal of variation among Conservative synagogues.  Some are indistinguishable from Reform, except that they use more Hebrew; others are practically Orthodox, except that men and women sit together.  Most are very traditional in substance, if not always in form.  There are an estimated 800 Conservative synagogues in the US today with approximately 1.3 million members.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Orthodox</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Orthodoxy is actually made up of several different groups.  It includes the modern Orthodox, who have largely integrated into modern society while maintaining observance of halakhah (Jewish Law), the Chasidim, who live separately and dress distinctively (commonly referred to in the media as the \"ultra-Orthodox\"), and the Yeshivish Orthodox, who are neither Chasidic nor modern.  The Orthodox movements are all very similar in belief, and the differences are difficult for anyone who is not Orthodox to understand.  They all believe that God gave Moses the whole Torah at Mount Sinai.  The \"whole Torah\" includes both the Written Torah (the first five books of the Bible) and the Oral Torah, an oral tradition interpreting and explaining the Written Torah.  They believe that the Torah is true, that it has come down to us intact and unchanged.  They believe that the Torah contains 613 mitzvot binding upon Jews but not upon non-Jews.  The Judaism 101 web site (the starting point of this \"site within a site\") was written primarily from the Orthodox point of view.  It has been estimated that there are 1200 Orthodox synagogues in the US today with a total of approximately 1 million members.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/jewfaq/movement.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechon Mamre: Movements of Judaism</a></p>\n<p>I do not know very much about the Catholic Church, but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church#Doctrine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It teaches that revelation has one common source, G-d, and two\ndistinct modes of transmission: Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to connect to our idea what the Talmud is and what role our tradition, from Sinai, is. Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Torah says כל ישראל ערבים זה בזה - All of Israel are responsible for one another. This shines through your sincere question, which is almost saying \"hold on, I expect that Jews should be teaching the same thing, it doesn't make any sense that there are all these differences\". Beautiful.</p>\n<p>Let's start.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 1:1</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משֶׁה קִבֵּל תּוֹרָה מִסִּינַי, וּמְסָרָהּ לִיהוֹשֻׁעַ, וִיהוֹשֻׁעַ לִזְקֵנִים, וּזְקֵנִים לִנְבִיאִים, וּנְבִיאִים מְסָרוּהָ לְאַנְשֵׁי כְנֶסֶת הַגְּדוֹלָה\nMoses received the Torah at Sinai and transmitted it to Joshua, Joshua to the elders, and the elders to the prophets, and the prophets to the Men of the Great Assembly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Torah was given at Har Sinai in the year 2448 of creation, 3335 years ago. This was effectively the \"start\" of Judaism, the cannon, the OG. Clearly, any ideology that tries to change what was received and transmitted from Sinai is <em>not</em> Torah. Here, we are not talking about the Written Torah, but the Oral Torah.</p>\n<p>As the above Mishna lays out, it has been handed down in a chain of tradition. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.17.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Torah</a> gives us a mitzva (see Sefer Hamitzvot <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Negative_Commandments.312.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Negative Mitzva 312</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Positive_Commandments.174.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Positive Mitzva 174</a>) to explicitly to listen to the Torah authority of the generation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עַל־פִּ֨י הַתּוֹרָ֜ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר יוֹר֗וּךָ וְעַל־הַמִּשְׁפָּ֛ט אֲשֶׁר־יֹאמְר֥וּ לְךָ֖ תַּעֲשֶׂ֑ה לֹ֣א תָס֗וּר מִן־הַדָּבָ֛ר אֲשֶׁר־יַגִּ֥ידֽוּ לְךָ֖ יָמִ֥ין וּשְׂמֹֽאל׃\nYou shall act in accordance with the instructions given you and the\nruling handed down to you; you must not deviate from the verdict that\nthey announce to you either to the right or to the left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this the commentators learn that there will always be an authority in Oral Torah matters, starting with the Supreme Sanhedrin in Jerusalem <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Rebels.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">See Mishne Torah Rebels 1</a>. In fact, I strongly recommend reading all the links I have provided in detail to get a good handle on the logic behind this.</p>\n<p>There have been many factions that have tried to reject or deeply corrupt the Oral Torah (almost always due to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dgaf5-WnbM&ab_channel=TeNaKTalk%28TaNaCh%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">politics</a>). The vast majority of them completely disappear after not many generations, which shows how important the Oral Torah is. Even the Karaites <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaite_Judaism#Karaites_today\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">didn't get any new authorized members for 500+ years</a>, and are today a relatively tiny movement.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, due to the haskala, and the general rise of secularism since the enlightenment, there have arisen several ideologies that secularise Torah, and unlike the Karaites, they are all very large. Rav Dovid Gottlieb clarifies this subject by stating that you can view most of modern Jewish movements as falling into two categories: traditionalists and non-traditionalists. These movements are the latter. They all, in some way, reject some of the tradition, either that the Torah is Divine, or even that God exists! They all start from some level of a modern, secular argument and work it backwards into the tradition, and therefore upend the tradition. Of course, they will all claim they are the \"last word\" in Jewish matters, but you have to decide that for yourself. They will all happily admit that their practice and philosophy is modern, new, and a change from what was the norm for thousands of years.</p>\n<p>It should be abundantly obvious, these two types of break-away, those that reject Oral Torah, and those that reject tradition, represent the \"deviations to the right, and to the left\".</p>\n<p>It shines through your question, as well as my general dealings with you on this site, if I may, that you are someone who expects Judaism to be a tradition from Sinai, unbroken, and undivided, and you accept Torah was written by God directly. <strong>Therefore, the answer to you is that the authority in Jewish matters comes from the traditional category. There are many, including the Litvish, Sefaradim, Chassidim, Modern Orthodox...</strong> Certainly, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist Jews will claim that I am being biased, and bringing only sources from my own \"camp\" to which I say, fair enough, they are welcome to answer the question as well, please decide for yourself.</p>\n<p>It's a sad reality that today, not all Jews follow or speak for authentic, traditional, unchanged Torah Judaism, if any Judaism at all, so I understand why it is confusing as an outsider and I appreciate the question. As Isaiah states in his chapter 10, only a remnant of Torah-keeping Jews will arrive in the end times. We have seen this to be very clearly true, those that reject the tradition in any way have (almost) all been lost to history, their staying power simply doesn't exist. That's also the case for the modern movements, within a generation or two, the children find zero reason to continue the tradition and are also lost, and all are suffering some form of crisis. Orthodox Jews, on the other hand, are growing exponentially...</p>\n<p>The Orthodox select their \"leaders\" in a very organic, non-formalised way. The Sages of the generation are geniuses, who have demonstrated tremendous breadth and depth of understanding of all areas of Torah (and, in the same way as any mastery, fellow masters are the ones who are able to recognise this, after the public has initially picked them up), spectacular character and deeds, and sometimes the fact they are descended from previous great leaders is of importance.</p>\n<p>The \"final say\" is also more organic than you might realise. The various Orthodox \"camps\" all have mutual respect in \"legitimacy\" (notwithstanding inevitable politics), even if their own particular leaders reach different conclusions from one another. This is something that is very possible and correct in Judaism, but the reasons for that are outside the scope of this answer.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are Jewish souls eternal?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rabbi Kaplan in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=61862&st=&pgnum=48&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Ohr 3:4 (p. 43)</a>, brings a quotation from the introduction of Shefa Tal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The souls of the Jewish nation are a part of God, which is hinted to\nin Dev. 32:9 ‘כי חלק ה׳ עמו, For the Lord’s portion is his people’,\nmeaning to say, an actual part of Him. Like a part of something that\nwas split from another. The two parts are of equal and similar\nqualities.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Leaving aside the notion that God has parts is philosophically impossible for Rambam since God is a unity, when Rabbi Kaplan quotes this source he seems to be endorsing it. For why would he bring the source if not to make some kind of point. The question is, if all Jewish souls are a part of God, and God is eternal, meaning uncreated, does this implies the souls of Jews are likewise eternal and not created? This would have to be the case if we are, in essence, a part of God because no part of God was created.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The same question was asked to the author of the Shefa Tal. He wrote another <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22404&st=&pgnum=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">book</a> explaining that this quote was taken out of context by people who did not read the admonition in his first book to read it strictly in order. He explains that in Kabbalistic terminology \"Hashem\" is not always the term used to refer to G-d himself, but can refer to Sefiros which are creations of His. G-d himself is referred to as \"Ein Sof\" (limitless) which by definition can have no parts. So the souls are not part of G-d as we would say it in English, but part of \"Hashem\".</p>\n<p>[This is based on my limited understanding and quick perusal of his work. I linked to the entire work so you can read more if you'd like.]</p>\n<p>This distinction answers a lot of the other objections people have to Kabbalistic thought.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It should be noted that there is no chiddush (novelty) in something being eternal. Everything that Hashem does should, by default, be eternal. The bigger chiddush is how can there be something not eternal? That's <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/361884/jewish/Tzimtzum.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tzimtzum</a>, and it is a paradox.</p>\n<p>Therefore, back to the subject of eternal. There is eternal, and there is Eternal. When it comes to Hashem, the Eternal One, He is alone, His greatness is inexpressible.</p>\n<p>Yet we also say that Nishmat Yisrael is eternal. According to Midrash Rabbah, Bereishit 8:7, Hashem consulted the souls of the righteous before creation. Who are they? According to Yishayahu 60:21, this is referring to all of Israel. As Rashi famously <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.1.1.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states</a>, בִשְׁבִיל יִשְׂרָאֵל, for the sake of Israel.</p>\n<p>As we said, the notion of limitation and finitude exist only because of the tzimtzum, where there is a concept of time. In that framework, we discuss the Godly souls that were created \"before\" time<sup>1</sup>, before tzimtzum. <strong>They are creations by Hashem, yet they are eternal because they exist beyond time.</strong></p>\n<p>There is, however, one more important point to bring at this stage, which is what you have brought in your question, i.e. חלק אלוה ממעל ממש<sup>2</sup>. As one studies these topics, one notices that this idea seems to be in a category of its own. The concept of two souls, human and Godly, has a third layer, and that is this \"literal, actual portion of God\". So, what is it?</p>\n<p>We say that Hashem, the Eternal One, may He be blessed, didn't change when He created the world<sup>3,4</sup>, and that He is not a Creator in Essence<sup>4</sup> (i.e. creating is out of character for Him).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sub>You have raised the point that this answer shouldn't contradict the Rambam's doctrine of apophasis, as well as the general Torah principle that Hashem has no parts. Indeed it does not pose a contradiction to these truths. Note that the Rambam discusses Hashem's will without reserve<sup>5</sup> - Hashem being wilful is still a mashal in that we <em>can't</em> comprehend how profound and infinite His will is, nor how He can be One with His will without parts<sup>6</sup>, so, while we look at how our tzaddikim took this true, accurate mashal<sup>7</sup> and explained its details, we <strong>must</strong> keep that in mind. Proceeding from here:</sub></p>\n<hr />\n<p>What someone wants, and what they enjoy, tell you more about someone than any other expression or facet of their being. This is indeed a Kabbalistic idea<sup>8</sup>, but said in these terms I think many can relate. It may be impossible to truly get to know someone, because we aren't able to see each others' inner worlds, yet if you find out what I like, and what I want, you'll know me very well. So we can say that even though \"no thought can apprehend Him\"<sup>9</sup>, we can get to know Him by finding out what He desires.</p>\n<p>We have everything we need now to answer your question:</p>\n<p><strong>Hashem, the Eternal One, Himself chooses and desires Nishmat Yisrael</strong>. This Ratzon and Ta'avah<sup>10</sup> Hashem has<sup>11</sup>, rises from what has always been - even \"before\" there was a people - truly unchanged; Eternal and One with His Essence in a way that is ineffable and indescribable. <strong>This is the חלק אלוה ממעל ממש. I.e. it's Him, may He be blessed.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אילו ידעתיו הייתיו<br />\n<sub>(Yedayah Ben Abraham Hapenini)</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the Shefa Tal writes in your quote, we have in our truth a corresponding, super-rational authentic Godly desire for Him in our Godly soul, with which we choose Him with a truly free will, that is one with our essence, l'havdil. I <em>highly recommend</em> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zWdkCVrMEbc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this short, jargon-free, crystal clear shiur</a> for a great introduction to this idea.

After they are created, they assume an existence on their own. Demons would attach themselves to the sinner and start to multiply as an act of self-preservation.\"</em></p>\n<p>Also, what does it mean when they attach themselves and multiply?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon#Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon#Judaism</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>That's a quote from wikipedia. To me, it doesn't sound right, but I can't explain why as I haven't read the book, which is written by a reform rabbi (i.e. <em>not a kabbalist</em>), nor do I know why the author of that section of the page wrote it the way they wrote it.</p>\n<p>Instead, I'll refer you to <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7886/jewish/Chapter-7.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 7 of Tanya</a>, written by an original, authentic kabbalist, which deals with the subject.</p>\n<p>To very briefly (and certainly insufficiently) summarise: God created a world, which is left incomplete, and invites us to complete it. The way we do that is by performing good deeds and avoiding bad deeds. Good deeds have a positive effect on the world, and bad deeds have a negative impact.</p>\n<p>Kabbalistic metaphor describes three categores - klipa, klipat nogah and kedusha. Klipa, 'husk', is that which hides the Creator, and Kedusha, 'holiness', reveal the Creator. The Klipat nogah is the \"touching klipa\", the innermost part of the 'husk' that bridges the two.</p>\n<p>When a Jew takes something that is neutral, e.g. kosher meat and wine (which get their vitality from the klipat nogah), and consumes them in the way God instructed him to (by following all the laws e.g. saying the correct blessing, and having the correct, pure intentions of only eating it in order to gain energy to further serve his Creator), then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...it is absorbed within Kedusha... the good that is intermingled in it is extracted and separated from the evil, prevails, and ascends to be absorbed in Kedusha...When one eats and drinks in the above-mentioned manner, then the vitality of the meat and the wine which originated in kelipat nogah is then extracted from the evil and ascends to G‑d like a burnt offering and sacrifice (i.e., the life-force of kelipat nogah that the food and drink contain is absorbed in Sanctity).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If however, he eats that sandwich in an improper way, only to satisfy his cravings, then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>he vitality of the meat and wine that he ingested is thereby degraded and absorbed temporarily in the utter evil of the three unclean kelipot. His (the glutton’s) body becomes a garment and a “vehicle” for these kelipot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is very esoteric, of course, but the imagery is clear - the vitality of the neutral items in the world can either ascend or descend. If they ascend, they are given over to revealing God, and if not, they add more obscuration of God in the world, further darkening it, i.e. \"vitalizing the klipot\".</p>\n<p>So, does this create demons, angels etc? Some will say yes (although nobody will say these demons/angels are anything like the stereotypical demons of popular culture), some will say no, it is just a metaphor to add imagery to aid understanding of the above concepts. Some will say that the answers are very deep...</p>\n<p>This isn't something an amateur in kabbalah should really be thinking about, as it requires a lot of background and deep understanding. In Tanya, Shaar Hayikhud Ve-ha-emunah, Chapter 1, the Alter Rebbe quotes the Arizal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"even in the literally inanimate—like stones, dust and water—there is\na soul and spiritual life… which enlivens and creates the inanimate\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-see this article: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3432275/jewish/Do-Chabad-Teachings-Say-Anything-About-the-Mind-Body-Problem.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3432275/jewish/Do-Chabad-Teachings-Say-Anything-About-the-Mind-Body-Problem.htm</a></p>\n<p><em>\"Aristotle famously described G‑d as “thought thinking itself.” But the Maimonidean view, as interpreted by R. Schneur Zalman, is that all reality is divine thought thinking itself.\"</em></p>\n<p>As you can see, not for amateurs.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I recently heard in a shiur that when you lose control to a forbidden desire, that is a demon. This particular sin does indeed \"multiply itself\", the more one engages in it, the more addictive and demonic it becomes. The idea of \"self preservation\" comes from the concept of \"just one more\" combined with \"I still haven't had the greatest pleasure, must keep going until I find it and am finally satisfied for good\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Let's analyze it: Kabbalists say that the <strong>wasting of seed creates a demonic spirit</strong> that becomes jealous of a person's living children...because they never got born.</p>\n<p><strong>For a person to arouse themselves, they are wasting seed</strong>, so knowing that THIS is how these demons are created, it becomes much more clear what they do to \"self preserve\": <strong>they possess their host and cause him to do it again and again</strong> to make more and more of them...Tikkun HaKlali or \"the General Rectification\" alongside teshuvah is the spiritual antidote.</p>\n<p>EDIT: This answer is derived from many sources. I don't remember most of them aside from the  Talmud, and Rebbe Nachman.</p>\n<p>This questioner seemed to know enough of the \"what\" in the question they had asked, and wanted to know the \"why\" and \"how\". If a questioner does not know the source of something that he took for granted in his question, it does seem rather cumbersome that the answerer should have to cite references to that portion also.</p>\n<p>Asker assumes \"sin leads to demons\" in Jewish tradition, which is a major oversimplification, demonstrating a flawed understanding which Jewish Law DEMANDS that I address immediately with zero hesitation whether I have a source or not or it was against forum rules or not even. <strong>Source = Leviticus 19:14</strong>.</p>\n<p>Further, the asking of a question about the why and the how of the traditions here assumes one already knows those traditions and their source, and is asking about specific mechanics of something not discussed heretofore in any Jewish works, to the best of my knowledge. So in order to even provide an answer, I'm at an immediate disadvantage in this instance, since a source doesn't exactly exist. Yet an answer does.</p>\n<p>Rebbe Nachman says the Tikkun HaKlali is part of the teshuvah for spilling seed, so he is my source on that. The rest is Talmud.</p>\n\n\n",

Bereishit 34:25</p>\n<p>3rd day is apparently when you are the most sore the Torah tells us</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Answer already given, but this Or HaChaim gives a fuller discussion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An additional meaning of the verse and the way it is phrased is that\nG'd appeared to Abraham for Abraham's sake. The Torah here alludes to\nsomething discussed in Baba Metzia 86. Rabbi Chama son of Chanina\nstated that this vision occurred on the third day after the\ncircumcision. G'd came and enquired after Abraham's wellbeing. How did\nRabbi Chama know that it was the third day? If we were to deduce this\nfrom Genesis 34,25, where we are told that the third day after the\npeople of Shechem had circumsised themselves was a day they\nexperienced additional pains, this cannot be, because we have a\ndefinitive statement in Shabbat 134 that the first and second day\nafter the circumcision are more dangerous to the patient! True, the\nTalmud there distinguishes between the pain and the relative healing\nprocess experienced by adults (pain lasts longer, healing occurs more\nslowly), compared to that experienced by minors. However, such a\ndistinction applies only to the third day, not to the first two days.\nOn the first two days everyone experiences the most pain.</p>\n<p>Besides, do not use the fact that Shimon\nand Levi did not attack the people of Shechem until the third day\nafter their circumcision as an argument. These sons of Jacob were not\nconcerned with the pain of the people of Shechem but with their\nphysical weakness, their relative inability to offer resistance. The\nthird day is definitely the day such patients feel weakest. Regarding\nthe danger of infection from the wound and danger to life, etc., the\nfirst two days are far more dangerous than the third day. Why should\nwe assume then that G'd did not come and visit Abraham on the first or\nsecond day after the circumcision? I have found an interesting comment\nin the Tur Yore Deah item 335 in which he quotes this folio in the\nTalmud without mentioning that it was on the third day. According to\nthat version the simple message of Rabbi Chama is that G'd came to pay\na visit to the sick. [The discussion in Shabbat 134 concerns washing a\nbaby with hot water on the third day after the circumcision if the\nthird day is on the Sabbath; permission to do this indicates that on\nthat day the baby's life is in danger. Ed.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He also explains why Hashem might not have visited Avraham on the first day:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to the opinion of Ran that the first and the third days are\nthe most dangerous to the patient, whereas the second day is not\nsufficiently dangerous to desecrate the Sabbath, we can understand the\nmatter better. When you do not feel in danger, G'd applies the general\nrule of not visiting the sick during the first three hours of the\nmorning. On the first day one also does not visit the sick as we know\nfrom Nedarim 40. When Rava was sick, he told his household not to tell\nanyone on the first day about his being sick in order not to influence\nhis horoscope negatively. Rashi explains this to mean \"that one should\nnot talk about the sick person.\" [As long as the matter is not public\nknowledge an immediate cure may result without the debits and merits\nof the sick person being reviewed in heaven because of people talking\nabout him. Ed.] However Rava did want the fact that he was sick\npublicised from the second day on, so that all those who hated him\nshould rejoice over his being sick. This would help diminish his\ndebits [in the accounts kept in the celestial ledger. Ed.]. Rabbi\nChama did not think G'd visited on the first day, as such a visit\nwould certainly not have gone unnoticed, and as a result tongues would\nhave been set wagging. Yerushalmi Peah third chapter states that the\nrelatives of a sick person may visit him immediately; this is because\nsuch visits do not contribute to the sickness of the patient becoming\npublic knowledge. There is certainly no doubt that G'd Himself must be\nviewed as a very close relative of the sick person. However, a visit\nby G'd would most certainly attract attention. According to the\nopinion that there is no difference in the degree of danger on either\nof the respective three days, this would leave the question of why\nRabbi Chama had to mention the third day as the day G'd visited\nAbraham. We may have to assume that these people had the version of\nthe Tur which did not mention the third day at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will note a couple of interesting points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That gemara says Hashem took the sun out its sheath to prevent visitors (looking after Avraham)</li>\n<li>Hashem sent visitors!</li>\n<li>The gemara further up states that Avraham was rewarded in 3 ways for his 3 good deeds (quote below). Perhaps, this is further enhanced by the fact that Avraham was at his weakest on this day, the <em>third</em> day!</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara notes: And in stating this, Rav disagrees with that\nstatement of Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina. As Rabbi Ḥama, son of\nRabbi Ḥanina, says, and likewise the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:\nIn reward for three acts of hospitality that Abraham performed for the\nangels, his descendants merited three rewards. The Gemara elaborates:\nIn reward for providing them with curd and milk, the Jewish people\nmerited the manna; in reward for: “And he stood [omed] by them,” the\nJews merited the pillar [amud] of cloud; in reward for Abraham saying:\n“Let now a little water be fetched,” they merited the well of Miriam.\nThis statement does not distinguish between actions performed by\nAbraham himself and those performed by means of a messenger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

We get clarity in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 21:12</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֜ים אֶל־אַבְרָהָ֗ם אַל־יֵרַ֤ע בְּעֵינֶ֙יךָ֙ עַל־הַנַּ֣עַר וְעַל־אֲמָתֶ֔ךָ כֹּל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר תֹּאמַ֥ר אֵלֶ֛יךָ שָׂרָ֖ה שְׁמַ֣ע בְּקֹלָ֑הּ כִּ֣י בְיִצְחָ֔ק יִקָּרֵ֥א לְךָ֖ <strong>זָֽרַע</strong>׃\nBut God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed over the boy or your slave; whatever Sarah tells you, do as she says, for it is through Isaac that <strong>offspring</strong> shall be continued for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, the covenant is through Yitzchak. From where do we learn it continues through Jacob and not Esav? <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.26.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 26:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גּ֚וּר בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַזֹּ֔את וְאֶֽהְיֶ֥ה עִמְּךָ֖ וַאֲבָרְכֶ֑ךָּ כִּֽי־לְךָ֣ וּֽלְזַרְעֲךָ֗ אֶתֵּן֙ אֶת־כׇּל־הָֽאֲרָצֹ֣ת הָאֵ֔ל וַהֲקִֽמֹתִי֙ אֶת־הַשְּׁבֻעָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִשְׁבַּ֖עְתִּי לְאַבְרָהָ֥ם אָבִֽיךָ׃\nReside in this land, and I will be with you and bless you; I will assign all these lands to you and to your heirs, fulfilling the oath that I swore to your father Abraham.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Genesis.26.3.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והקמותי את השבועה אין צריך שיבטיח הקב\"ה את יצחק שלא יעבור השבועה שנשבע לאביו כי לא אדם הוא להנחם (שמואל א טו כט) ואברהם אין לו זרע אחר בעל ברית לאלהים והשבועה איננה על תנאי כי ביעקב הוצרך מפני עשו אחיו לומר שבו יתקיים הברית ובזרעו (בראשית ל״ה:י״ב) לא בעשו ונראה שזה המאמר \"והקמותי את השבועה\" יחשב שבועה ולכך תמיד יאמר בתורה (שמות לג א) הארץ אשר נשבעתי לאברהם ליצחק וליעקב אשר נשבעת להם בך (שם לב יג) כי לא מצאנו שבועה ליצחק בלתי זאת ורצה הקב\"ה להשבע לכל אחד מן האבות להודיע שראוי כל אחד לכרות עמו ברית ושתהיה זכות כל אחד עומדת לפניו עם זרעם כי אף על פי שהראשונה תספיק תוספת זכות וכבוד הוא להם…\nAND I WILL FULFILL THE OATH WHICH I SWORE UNTO ABRAHAM THY FATHER. There is no need for the Holy One, blessed be He, to assure Isaac that He will not violate the oath which He swore to his father, for He is not a man, that He should repent. Abraham had no other seed upon whom a covenant had been established with G-d except Isaac. The oath, moreover, was not given on condition. In the case of Jacob, it was necessary that he be given such assurance on account of his brother Esau. He was thus saying that in him [Jacob] and his seed will the covenant be fulfilled, not in Esau…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If that is not clear enough, consider <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.15.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 15:13</a> (which is the passage of the Covenant of the Parts):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֣אמֶר לְאַבְרָ֗ם יָדֹ֨עַ תֵּדַ֜ע כִּי־גֵ֣ר ׀ יִהְיֶ֣ה <strong>זַרְעֲךָ֗</strong> בְּאֶ֙רֶץ֙ לֹ֣א לָהֶ֔ם וַעֲבָד֖וּם וְעִנּ֣וּ אֹתָ֑ם אַרְבַּ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָֽה׃\nAnd [God] said to Abram, “Know well that your <strong>offspring</strong> shall be strangers in a land not theirs, and they shall be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was only the children of Jacob that went to Egypt and were oppressed, not Esav.</p>\n<p><strong>So the answer is no, the covenant has no effect on Ishmael or Esav</strong>. They both received their own blessings. As children of Avraham, they are certainly very blessed, and great, and through him have a closeness and special relationship to Hashem, and both will be redeemed in the future.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There was no covenant with Ismael or Esav but the Mitzvah (and covenant?) of milah was also  made with the children of Ketura (Rashi says Ketura was Hagar who Avrhom remarried ).Albeit possibly  temporarily.  The Gemara (Sanhedrin 59B) says that they  are included in the mitzvah of Milah.  Rashi explains it to mean the that Avrohom had to circumcise the six children he had with Keturah but not their descendants. The Tosfos H'Rosh says and other Rishonim imply that  this obligation continued until Mattan Torah.</p>\n<p>OTOH The Rambam Hilcos Melochim 10:8 says the children of Keturah remain obligated in the mitzvah of milah even today. Not only that even the children of Ismael are obligated as well due to their intermarriage with the children of Ketura.</p>\n<p>There is plenty of question about the reason and nature of this obligation. The Gemora says they are included because of the posuk of   את בריתי הפר includes them. That would put them outside the covenant of milah but give them an independent obligation to circumcise . However many understand the Rambam as meaning that once they were reincluded in the mitzva they were also reincluded in לְזַרְעֲךָ֖.</p>\n<p>This is just a few starting points for the discussion and is not definitive in any way.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there a halachic difference between the \"tzadikei\" (\"righteous\") and the \"chasidei\" (\"pious\") umot ha Olam?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am an Italian Noahide.</p>\n<p>Rambam, in his Mishneh Torah, says that the \"pious among the Nations\" (\"chasidei umot ha Olam\") have part in the World to Come (Hilchot Teshuvah 3:5; Hilchot Melachim 8:11).</p>\n<p>In Tosefta-Sanhedrin 13:2, and in other writings of the Jewish Tradition, I read instead that are the \"righteous among the Nations\" (\"tzadikei umot ha Olam\") who have part in the World to Come.</p>\n<p>Is there a halachic difference between the status of a non-Jew \"chasid\" and that of a non-Jew \"tzadik\", or are the two definitions to be understood as synonyms?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>They are different.</p>\n<p>A Tzaddik is someone who does everything correctly (see Mesilat Yisharim, Chapters about Nekiyut - Chapter 13 clarifies this is referring to tzaddik).</p>\n<p>A Chassid is someone who does everything correctly, and his intentions are pure, meaning he doesn't do it for his own benefit at all, but does it purely for the sake of Hashem (see Mesilat Yisharim chapters on Chassid)</p>\n<p>This certainly applies to non-Jews as well. One way to look at it is like this. A non-Jew, without a Torah, can be an extremely nice guy, naturally. As a result, he may indeed be keeping all the laws, out of his own natural, logical niceness. That won't cut it, he needs to do it <em>because Hashem said so</em> for it to be considered something \"above and beyond\". Or another way to say it, in the world to come, Hashem will be fully revealed and therefore it is important that a non-Jew forms a personal relationship with Hashem because the real reward of the world to come is enjoying relationship with Hashem. The former \"tzaddikei umot haolam\" have no relationship with Hashem, they are just doing good things, which will also be, tit for tat, be rewarded with \"things\" i.e. rewarded in this world, not the next, which is a world \"above things\", where the spiritual totally subdues the physical.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Here is the tosefta in english (my own translation, but I used <a href=\"https://www.toseftaonline.org/seforim/tractate_sanhedrin_mishna_and_tosefta_1919.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> to aid translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is taught that the sons of the wicked of Israel don't have a share in the world to come, and will not live in the world to come, as it is written \"For lo! That day is at hand, burning like an oven\". These are the words of Rabbanan Gamliel. Rabbi Yehoshua says they will come to the World to Come, and furthermore, he says \"God protects the simple\" (a Talmudic principle that God doesn't inflict His punishments on people who couldn't have known better), and furthermore \"Hew down the tree, lop off its branches...But leave the stump with its roots in the ground\". Rabbanan Gamliel says, what about \"shall burn them to ashes and leave of them neither stock nor boughs.\", which means that Hashem will not leave a mitzva or parts of a mitzva to be rewarded in the World to Come. Another explanation is that \"root\" means soul and \"branch\" means body.</p>\n<p>The children of the wicked of the gentiles will not live in the World\nto Come, nor shall they be judged. Rebbi Eliezer holds: none of the\ngentiles have a share in the world to come, for it is written \"the\nwicked will return to sheol, all the nations that forget God\". \"The\nwicked shall return to sheol\" - these are the wicked in Israel. \"All\nthe nations that forget God\" - these are the wicked among the\ngentiles. Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: If the pasuk had said \"the\nwicked shall return to sheol, all the nations...\", and then said no\nmore, I would have agreed with you that it is talking about the wicked\nof Israel and the wicked of the gentiles, but since the pasuk says\n\"who forget God\", there must be righteous (tzaddikim) men among the\ngentiles who have a share in the world to come.</p>\n<p>The school of Shammai say there are three categories: one for eternal\nlife in the world to come, one for shame and everlasting contempt, the\nformer are accounted wholly righteous, and the latter are accounted\nwholly wicked, and a third category that descend to gehimon and scream\nand return and are healed as it is written \"I will bring the third\npart through the fire...\", and Chana said about them \"Hashem kills and\nHashem gives life...\".</p>\n<p>Beit Hillel says (on the third category) \"He is great in mercy\", which\nmeans He leans in the direction of mercy, and of them David said \"I\nlove it that Hashem listened...\", and of them this whole psalm is\nwritten.</p>\n<p>The rebels of Israel and the rebels of the gentiles descend to gehinom\nwith their bodies, and are judged for 12 months, and after twelve\nmonths their souls are destroyed and their bodies burnt. Gehinom casts\nthem forth and they become dust, the wind blows them around and\nscatters them under the soles of the feet of the righteous, as it is\nwritten: \"And they shall tread on the wicked, for they shall be\ndust...\". But the conspirators, the heretics and the deniers of Torah,\nand the abandoners of the ways of the community, and those who don't\nbelieve in the resurrection, and those that sin and lead the masses to\nsin like Yeravam and Avihu, and those who struck terror in the land of\nthe living, and those who stretched their hand against the Temple;\ngehinom is closed for them, and they are judged for all generations,\nas it is written \"And they shall go forth and look at the corpses of\nthe men...\". Sheol will be destroyed but they will not, for it is\nwritten \"And their form will cause sheol...\" What caused this on them?\nBecause they stretched their hand against the Temple as it is written\n\"because of Zvul\" and Zvul means Temple as it is written \"I have\nsurely built the house of Zvul for You\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This Tosefta seems to be matching up exactly with what I said above (which, by the way, is based on the Lubavitcher Rebbe's teaching, who was of course an expert in all of Torah, including Tosefta and Rambam).</p>\n<p>There seem to be three categories: the wicked gentiles, the standard gentiles, and the \"righteous\" gentiles.</p>\n<p>Firstly, don't worry about the terminology. The word \"tzaddik\" here is not in contrast to \"chassid\", as Rabbi Yehoshua seems to recognise that there are 3 categories, and the defining difference between the middle category and the latter is \"those who forget God\", not how many good/bad deeds they have. Nay, the middle category could have nothing but good deeds their whole life, in which case they would certainly be considered tzaddikim, in the more general sense of the balance between their good deeds and bad deeds, but they don't remember/involve God.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua is arguing with Rebbi Eliezer's idea that no gentiles are going to be in the world to come. His proof is that those who didn't forget God are spoken about, implying there are some gentiles who didn't forget God (Rambam's \"chassidei umot olam\"), i.e. do their good deeds because He said so, and they certainly have a share in the world to come. The fact that no more is said implies that this argument was accepted (but not definitively).</p>\n\n\n",

In other words that \"these word\" should always be in our hearts and thoughts so we don't forget them as they are fundamental to the Torah. And that it is why afterwards (in the Shema) it goes on to detail the commandments to speak it (the Torah) out and to write tefillin and mezuzos. That is why it specifically writes \"These words\" to demonstrate that one should not change the order of these things nor the language and all of that is included in the term \"These words\".</p>\n\n\n",

So by the merit of his wife that ignorant 40 year old bachelor became one of the wisest of the Jewish people. In this they understand that a woman can, if she wants to, give up her marital right if she goes to study Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

The Kesav VeHakabbalah in Parshas <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.21.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishpatim 21:7</a> notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לאמה. המשרתת תקרא אמה, והיא לרש\"פ מדרגה חשובה מן השפחה, שהשפחה עלי' מוטל כל עבודות הקשות והפחותות שבבית (מאגד), והאמה אין עלי' רק עבודות הקלות וההשגחה על סדור ותקון הבית</p>\n<p>As a maidservant - Someone in service is called a maidservant (amah) and it is a level more important than that of a shifchah, since a slave girl (i.e. a shifchah) is assigned all the difficult and menial chores in the house, whereas the maidservant (i.e. the amah) only has to do the light work and oversee the order and repair of the house.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which in the context of your question makes sense as Hagar, the daughter of Pharoah was initially given over to Avraham as a servant following the miracles that happened for Sarah when she was in his custody. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.45.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 45:1</a> famously concludes there that Pharoah reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר מוּטָב שֶׁתְּהֵא בִּתִּי <strong>שִׁפְחָה</strong> בְּבַיִת זֶה וְלֹא גְבִירָה בְּבַיִת אַחֵר</p>\n<p>As he (Pharoah) said, \"It is better that my daughter be a servant in (Avraham's) this house than a mistress in another house.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, when she was sent away, she was Avraham's wife and so arguably, her level of work may have been lessened and therefore it is fit to call her an אמה.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Davar_on_Genesis.16.2.2?vhe=Sefer_Torat_Elohim,_Vilna_1879&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netziv</a> on Parshas Lech Lecha 16:2 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בא נא אל שפחתי. לא כדבר רחל ליעקב הנה אמתי בלהה. דאמה משמע לא כשפחה ממש שהיא קניית הגוף אלא <strong>סרה למשמעתה</strong>. כמו אמה העבריה והיינו דאע״ג שלבן נתן אותה לשפחה מ״מ מאז מסרה רחל אותה ליעקב היתה בתורת אמה. משא״כ שרה התנהגה גם אח״כ בתורת שפחה כמו שיבואר</p>\n<p>Consort with my maid - Not like Rochel said to Yaakov, \"Here is my maidservant (אמתי) Bilhah\". Since the implication of \"Amah\" is not like \"Shifchah\" exactly, which is the purchase of her body, but rather to turn her over for absolute obedience, like a Hebrew slave (אמה העבריה) and that's why even though Lavan gave her over as a shifchah, nevertheless from then Rochel gave her over to Yaakov with the laws of an amah. Whereas conversely, Sarah treated her (Hagar) even afterwards as a shifcha, like we explained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>אָמָה usually refers to a Jewish girl who was sold into slavery which she can only be until the age of twelve. (אָמָה הָעִבְרִיָּה)</p>\n<p>שִׁפְחָ֥ה usually refers to a non-Jewish woman (can be any age) who in slavery (שִׁפְחָה כְּנַעֲנִית)</p>\n<p>The Seforono says she is called שִׁפְחָ֥ה  before Ishmael is born because she had not yet been freed at that time. Possibly  she is called an אָמָה later on because she had some degree of freedom at that point in time. At least enough not to refer to her as a שִׁפְחָ֥ה anymore.</p>\n<p>However, there must be other reasons as well because by Bilha and Zilpha the Torah also alternates between calling them שִׁפְחָ֥ה or אָמָה. They continue to be referred to as שִׁפְחָ֥ה even after being called אָמָה. (They are also referred to as wives and other titles  earlier and later on. The reasons behind the some of those varying titles have explanations given  by the basic commentaries on Chumash)</p>\n<p>Rav Yaakov Kamenitsky who was a major expert on dikduk writes on these pesukim about Hagar  similar to what I write above that the question asked in the OP but concludes that this needs further research.  He also points out that although in the Mishna and Gemora אָמָה always means Jewish girl in slavery  and שִׁפְחָ֥ה always means non-Jewish women in slavery there is one place in Chumash  where אָמָה  refers to non-Jewish women slaves   so apparently there is further nuance in when and why  these words are used.</p>\n\n\n",

Read them first, but:<br />\nNone of the sources given say explicitly that you are allowed to pray without kavannah. They do say that given that we don't concentrate so well these days, we no longer tell you not to daven if you cannot achieve a very high level, and we no longer tell you to go back and try again.<br />\nThe early sources do say that kavannah is extremely essential. You really have to see the wording of the Rambam [ital. mine] (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.4.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Tefillah 4(14)</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כַּוָּנַת הַלֵּב כֵּיצַד. כָּל תְּפִלָּה שֶׁאֵינָהּ בְּכַוָּנָה\nאֵינָהּ תְּפִלָּה. וְאִם הִתְפַּלֵּל בְּלֹא כַּוָּנָה חוֹזֵר\nוּמִתְפַּלֵּל בְּכַוָּנָה. מָצָא דַּעְתּוֹ מְשֻׁבֶּשֶׁת וְלִבּוֹ\nטָרוּד אָסוּר לוֹ לְהִתְפַּלֵּל עַד שֶׁתִּתְיַשֵּׁב דַּעְתּוֹ.\nלְפִיכָךְ הַבָּא מִן הַדֶּרֶךְ וְהוּא עָיֵף אוֹ מֵצֵר אָסוּר לוֹ\nלְהִתְפַּלֵּל עַד שֶׁתִּתְיַשֵּׁב דַּעְתּוֹ. אָמְרוּ חֲכָמִים יִשְׁהֶה\nשְׁלֹשָׁה יָמִים עַד שֶׁיָּנוּחַ וְתִתְקָרֵר דַּעְתּוֹ וְאַחַר כָּךְ\nיִתְפַּלֵּל<br />\nProper intention: What is implied?

Therefore, one who comes in from a journey and is\ntired or irritated <em>is forbidden to pray</em> until he composes himself. Our\nSages taught that one should <em>wait three days</em> until he is rested and\nhis mind is settled, and then he may pray.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You hear his words? Prayer without kavannah is not prayer at all; it just doesn't work. And you are not allowed to do it.<br />\nNow look again at the sources brought by the other answers; you will see that they are watering down the Rambam's absolutes, acknowledging our limitations.<br />\nWhat about the OP's question? Well, if a person really really cannot pray, that may be the right answer. But it may also be true that the person could still try to fulfill the Rambam's next words (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.4.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid., 4(17)</a>) [again, ital. mine]:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כֵּיצַד הִיא הַכַּוָּנָה. שֶׁיְּפַנֶּה אֶת לִבּוֹ מִכָּל\nהַמַּחֲשָׁבוֹת וְיִרְאֶה עַצְמוֹ כְּאִלּוּ הוּא עוֹמֵד לִפְנֵי\nהַשְּׁכִינָה. לְפִיכָךְ צָרִיךְ לֵישֵׁב מְעַט קֹדֶם הַתְּפִלָּה כְּדֵי\nלְכַוֵּן אֶת לִבּוֹ וְאַחַר כָּךְ יִתְפַּלֵּל בְּנַחַת וּבְתַחֲנוּנִים\nוְלֹא יַעֲשֶׂה תְּפִלָּתוֹ כְּמִי שֶׁהָיָה נוֹשֵׂא מַשּׂאוֹי\nוּמַשְׁלִיכוֹ וְהוֹלֵךְ לוֹ. לְפִיכָךְ צָרִיךְ לֵישֵׁב מְעַט אַחַר\nהַתְּפִלָּה וְאַחַר כָּךְ יִפָּטֵר. חֲסִידִים הָרִאשׁוֹנִים הָיוּ\nשׁוֹהִין שָׁעָה אַחַת קֹדֶם תְּפִלָּה וְשָׁעָה אַחַת לְאַחַר תְּפִלָּה\nוּמַאֲרִיכִין בִּתְפִלָּה שָׁעָה<br />\nWhat is meant by [proper] intention?\nOne should clear his mind from all thoughts and envision himself as\nstanding before the Divine Presence. <em>Therefore</em>, one must sit a short\nwhile before praying in order to focus his attention and then pray in\na pleasant and supplicatory fashion.<br />\nOne should not pray as one\ncarrying a burden who throws it off and walks away. <em>Therefore</em>, one\nmust sit a short while after praying, and then withdraw. The pious\nones of the previous generations would wait an hour before praying and\nan hour after praying. They would [also] extend their prayers for an\nhour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice the \"therefore\"s. The Rambam is saying that the basic idea of kavannah is that you <em>are not doing something else</em>, you are just talking to Hashem. Stop doing other things beforehand, so that you won't keep thinking about them. And, wait to do other things afterwards, so that you won't start thinking about them early. Just pray.<br />\nI bet you thought those \"pious ones\" were learning musar. Well, maybe they were, but the Rambam's simple explanation is that they were making sure that there was a buffer between everything else they were doing, and their prayer.</p>\n<p>Now, let's take a look at a more modern posek who discusses the OP's question explicitly. That's the Mishnah Berurah's Biur Halacha on one of the sources brought by Rabbi Kaii, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.101.1?lang=he&with=Biur%20Halacha&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OH 101:1</a> [ital. mine],:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם אינו יכול וכו' - משמע מלשון זה דאפילו לכתחילה מותר לעמוד ולהתפלל\nכיון שהוא אנוס שאינו יכול ליישב דעתו וכן משמע לישנא דברייתא ולפלא שלא\nהוזכר זה ברמב\"ם שכתב דין זה רק בלשון דיעבד שאם כיון בברכה ראשונה יצא\nואולי באינו יכול גם הוא מודה דזה מוטב משלא יתפלל כלל ועכ\"פ נראה פשוט\nדאם יכול להמתין וליישב דעתו מטרדותיו ולא יעבור זמן ק\"ש ותפלה עי\"ז\nדצריך ליישב דעתו<br />\n\"If he cannot concentrate [on everything after the\nfirst blessing of Amidah]\"...

But it is\nobvious that if he can <em>wait and clear his thoughts</em> before the\nallotted time passes, that he must do so...</p>\n<p>והאידנא אין חוזרין וכו' - לכאורה כונתו אם סיים השמ\"ע ולא כיון באבות\nאבל אם עומד אצל אתה גבור ונזכר שלא כיון באבות כיון דמצד הדין לא יצא\nבזה האיך נאמר לו שיברך עוד ברכות שלא יצא בהם אחרי דחסר לו ברכת אבות\nוכי מפני שקרוב שלא יכוין נאמר לו שיברך עוד ברכות שבודאי לא יצא בהם כן\nהיה נראה לי אבל מדברי הח\"א כלל כ\"ד דין ב' משמע דאינו חוזר אפילו עומד\nאצל אתה גבור ויותר נ\"ל עצה אחרת באופן זה שלא יאמר עוד עתה כלל וימתין\nעל הש\"ץ שיאמר ברכת אבות ויכוין לצאת וכשיגיע הש\"ץ לברכת אתה גבור יתחיל\nבעצמו דהלא בתפלה קי\"ל דאינו מוציא אלא דוקא מי שאינו בקי משא\"כ באבות\nכיון שאינו יכול לברך אותה בעצמו<br />\n\"Today we do not go back [even if he\nfailed to concentrate on the first blessing]\"... I would think that\nit means: If he has finished the whole Amidah and had no kavannah for Avos, the\nfirst blessing. But if he is standing after the first blessing, and realizes\nthat he did not concentrate, <em>since he is not [really] yotzei</em> how\ncould we say to him that he should say the rest of the blessings,\nwhere he will not be yotzei on them either, once he is missing the\nfirst one?! [Just because we don't send him back] because he may\ndo no better the next time, is no reason to say the rest of\nthe blessings that he will certainly not be yotzei in!   That's what I\nwould have thought. However, the Chayei Adam [seems to disagree]...<br />\nI do have an alternate suggestion: Wait for the Chazaras haShatz, be\nyotzei on the first blessing from him, and carry on with the rest\nyourself...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not too encouraging. He seems to hold that you are certainly not allowed to start praying if you can't concentrate on the <em>first</em> blessing - even in our days. And if you didn't, you kinda wasted your time ח\"ו and he's not sure what's the point of continuing or why you'd be allowed to do it...</p>\n<p>See what I've written in the post referenced initially, from Harav Tzvi Berkowitz shlit\"a, about a person trying to \"blackmail Hashem\", ח\"ו: Don't complain if I didn't have kavannah - at least I davened! It may be true that you should go ahead and daven if you really really cannot concentrate at all; I'm not sure from the sources. But be erlich. It is absolutely true that you should be trying to muster what concentration you can. You are speaking with Hashem; don't just \"daven up\" because you are too exhausted to bother. The level mentioned by that Rambam should almost always be attainable: there is no reason to do other things while you are praying.<br />\n[This musar all applies to me too, as well as anyone else. It isn't easy.]<br />\nAnd remember the incredible story they tell about R' Shimon Schwab zt\"l (source?): He would drink a cup of coffee if he needed it to be able to say Hamapil with proper kavannah!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>The answer is yes, you must pray 3 times a day, regardless of your ability to concentrate.</strong> There might be exceptions to this, so please consult your LOR for any personal situations where this becomes a question.</p>\n<p>There are many sources that say you <em>shouldn't</em> pray if you can't concentrate, and many powerful words have been written by our holy sages about the supreme importance of <em>kavana</em> during prayer, as well as how terrible it is to not put your heart into your prayer.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the halacha of our generation is our <em>kavana</em> is so low nowadays that we don't presume we can <em>ever</em> concentrate, so putting off tefilot now so we can concentrate later is an invalid strategy and a person is never allowed to decline shacharit, mincha or maariv due to inability to concentrate.</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.98.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch OC 98:2</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא יתפלל במקום שיש דבר שמבטל כוונתו ולא בשעה המבטלת כוונתו [טור בשם ר\"מ מרוטנבורג הגה\"מ פ\"ד מהלכו' תפלה] ועכשיו אין אנו נזהרין בכל זה מפני שאין אנו מכוונים כ\"כ בתפלה:</p>\n<p>One should not pray in a place where there is something that negates one's concentration, and not at a time that negates one's concentration [Tur in the name of R.

If one didn't direct one's\nintention while saying the blessing of the forefathers, even if one\ndirected one's intention for the rest [of the blessings], one needs to\nreturn [to the beginning of the Amidah] and pray. Gloss: <strong>(Nowadays we\ndo not return [to repeat the prayer when it is] due to a lack of\nintention, because [there's a fair chance that] even in the repeating\n[of the Amidah] it is likely that one will not direct one's intention\n[again]; if so, why should one return?)</strong> (Tur)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.98.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Tur</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דא\"ר חייא בר אשי אמר רב כל שאין דעתו מיושבת עליו אל יתפלל רבי חנינא\nביומא דרתח פירוש ביום שהיה כועס לא הוה מצלי רבי אליעזר אומר הבא מן\nהדרך אל יתפלל תוך ג' ימים ר' אליעזר בנו של רבי יוסי הגלילי אומר אף\nהמיצר שמואל לא הוה מצלי בביתא דאית ביה שכרא מפני הריח שטורדו רב פפא לא\nהוה מצלי בביתא דאית ביה הרסנא וכתב הר\"ם מרוטנבורק אין אנו נזהרין עתה\nבכל זה שאין אנו מכוונין כל כך בתפלה</p>\n<p>Rabbi Hanina\nwould not pray on a day that he was angry.

There is davening b'kavana, and there is davening b'dveykut. As has been demonstrated, we have a serious crisis of kavana in our generation, but it seems that we still have the power to daven b'dveykut. This is also considered a function of the heart. So what is it? It means, when you daven, be aware that these are not <em>your</em> words, but these are Hashem's words. As such, treat them like you would treat fine china, pronounce them carefully, with awe, and dignity. If you find you aren't able to focus on the meaning and are bothered by that, you should always able to at least achieve this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>\"O YHWH, God of my salvation, I cry out day and night before you.

This is \"asmachta\".</p>\n<p>Check out Pischei Hachoshen 8:21 for details about ashmachta. If two parties engage in a bet, neither of them is really expecting to relinquish the money, therefore the winner is counted as stealing from the loser, halachically.</p>\n<p>According to the Rama (Shulchan Aruch Choshen Umishpat 379:2), it doesn't count as asmachta (Rama), but it does according to the Mechaber (see ibid 370), and this is what sefardim follow, although the Rama is a little more lenient (see below). If this is a one off bet, then it doesn't fall under Yishuv Olam either.</p>\n<p>It seems ashkenazim mostly follow the second view (possibly due to the Rama stating in 207 that placing all the money on the table should eliminate the issue of theft, and gives all the other conditions, as well as Hilchot Ribbit Y\"D 170 which states if the sums are small, people do not care), and permit it, as nowadays most people are not \"perpetual gamblers\" (for Ashkenazim at least - see Rama), but it should be noted that there are still many teshuvot that forbid it for various reasons (See Rav Moshe Feinstein Y'D 3:35 for eg about taking on new 'addictive' hobbies).</p>\n<p>We also should ideally take into account the first view of asmachta.</p>\n<p><strong>So, we can see that we should be viewing the bet in light of a regular kinyan/change of ownership, which doesn't take place until the result betted on occurs. If we can even say that the bet was valid in the first place (which will depend on minhag, the sum, the nature of the participants, and many factors), certainly if one of the parties feels that they have been \"done in\" by the other, that would prevent him relinquishing the money in his heart and the transaction would no longer be valid and the winner would be engaging in some level of theft.

It could also affect their desire to hand over the money. It could also lead to ill will between the pair and that's a separate topic altogether.</p>\n<p>Interesting to note that one of the conditions the Rama gives (ibid, see also 207:13) for allowing gambling is that neither of those betting should feel secure they will definitely win.

If not, but the loser refuses to pay, this could be considered Oshek ( Vayikra 19:13, Sefer Hachinuch Mitzva 258, Smag Mitzva 156, Shulchan Aruch 359:8, Shulchan Aruch Harav Gezela 4, Halachos of Other People's Money pg. 36.

This view was shared by numerous\nrabbis, which can be seen in the Responsa literature of Simon ben\nZemah of Duran, Samuel de Medina, Judah Berab, Jacob Berab, Moses ben\nElias Kapsali and others in the Middle Ages.</p>\n<p>It can also be seen more recently in the Responsa of the Satmar Rov in\nhis Divrei Torah, Yoreh Deah #59, paragraph 5, as well as in the\nResponsa of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, Even Haezer Volume 4 Number 53.</p>\n<p>The very famous rabbi, Moses ben Maimon, called Maimonides (the\nRambam), also wrote that if a Jew converted to Christianity, he or she\nwas no longer a Jew. See Maimonides, Hilchot Mamrim Perek 3, Halacha\n1-3, as well as in Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah, Avodat Kochavim 2:5.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moses Isserles demanded a formal conversion back to Judaism for\nthose who had converted out, but then wanted to return. He demanded\nritual immersion (mikveh) and repentance before a court of three (Beit\nDin). You will see this also in other Responsa literature: Radbaz,\nResponsa III, 415; Moses Isserles to Yoreh Deah 268.12; and Hoffman,\nMelamed Leho-il II, 84. \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the article mentions that the Anusim are still Jewish because that was a forced conversion and involuntary, not like anything that would happen today.</p>\n<p>I have to wonder where some of these sources would mean the same re atheism too. 'cos eg a bit later it uses aryeh kaplan a a source but his statement is more ambiguous. For example the article says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, this is the attitude of many Orthodox rabbis today. In\nhis book ‘The Real Messiah,’ Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, writing for the Union\nof Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America and the Orthodox youth\ngroup ‘National Conference of Synagogue Youth,’ wrote (on page 21):</p>\n<p>\"This brings us back to our original question: What can a Jew lose by\nembracing Christianity? The answer is: Everything.  Christianity\nnegates the fundamentals of Jewish faith, and one who accepts it\nrejects the very essence of Judaism. Even if he continues to keep all\nof the rituals, it is the same as if he abandoned Judaism completely.</p>\n<p>A Jew who accepts Christianity might want to call himself a ‘Jewish\nChristian,’ but he is no longer a Jew. He can no longer even be\ncounted as part of a Jewish congregation.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So to Aryeh Kaplan it sounds like the pinnacle of no longer being a Jew, is no longer being counted as part of a jewish congregation..</p>\n<p>Well, some would say atheists can't be counted for a Minyan, <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2019/01/including-non-religious-jews-in-a-minyan-and-its-discontents/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.torahmusings.com/2019/01/including-non-religious-jews-in-a-minyan-and-its-discontents/</a>   though i've never heard anybody say they are no longer Jewish.  So I wonder if any of the sources that article gives would exclude atheists from being Jewish also. Or if some of the sources it mentions don't go as far as to say the person is no longer Jewish.</p>\n<p>But anyow judging by that article there do seem to be sources that view conversion to another religion as a special case and the person is no longer considered Jewish.</p>\n\n\n",

That He (הוא) and His will (רצונו היינו רצון העליון) are one and G-d's will is dressed or enclothed in His Commandments which are written in the letters of the written Torah. This is like is taught in Mishnah Avot (Pirkei Avot), 6:10 which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חֲמִשָּׁה קִנְיָנִים קָנָה לוֹ הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא בְעוֹלָמוֹ, וְאֵלּוּ הֵן, <strong>תּוֹרָה קִנְיָן אֶחָד</strong>, שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ קִנְיָן אֶחָד, אַבְרָהָם קִנְיָן אֶחָד, יִשְׂרָאֵל קִנְיָן אֶחָד, בֵּית הַמִּקְדָּשׁ קִנְיָן אֶחָד. <strong>תּוֹרָה מִנַּיִן, דִּכְתִיב (משלי ח), ה' קָנָנִי רֵאשִׁית דַּרְכּוֹ קֶדֶם מִפְעָלָיו מֵאָז</strong>.</p>\n<p>Five possessions did the Holy Blessed One, set aside as his own in this world, and these are they:<strong>The Torah, one possession</strong>; Heaven and earth, another possession; Abraham, another possession; Israel, another possession; The Temple, another possession. 1a) <strong><em>The Torah is one possession.</em> From where do we know this? Since it is written, “The Lord possessed me, <em>Reishit</em> of <em>His Way</em>, prior to His works of old” (Proverbs 8:22).</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This last phrase, <em>prior to His works of old</em>, is in keeping with the concept found in Midrash and Kabbalah that the Torah proceeded Creation by 2000 years. It is literally the blueprint from which all of existence comes.</p>\n<p>See also the teaching of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tanya%2C_Part_One%2C_The_Book_of_the_Average_Men.40.1?vhe=Tanya_-_Otsar_HaChasidim_Lubavitch&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Alter Rebbe like is found in the Tanya, Chapter 40:1</a>, and also the Rishon, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodat_HaKodesh_(Gabbai).3.23.1?vhe=Avodat_HaKodesh&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Meir Ibn Gabbai in Avodat HaKodesh 3:23:1</a> for a more extensive and deeper understanding of this.</p>\n<p>And this teaching from Mishnah Avot refers back to the very first word in the first sentence of the written Torah, <em><strong>Bereshit</strong></em> (בראשית).</p>\n<p>That although commonly mistranslated as, <em>In the beginning...</em>, Rashi explains that according to the Hebrew grammar, this means, <em>On account of, or for the sake of <strong>Reishit</strong>...</em> and cannot mean, \"<em>In the beginning...\"</em>. And that this term, <em>Reishit</em> is actually referring to the most choice, <em>first fruits</em> of G-d's produce, which include both the Torah itself and Israel which are both called <em>Reishit</em>. That <strong>G-d</strong>, His <strong>name</strong> and His <strong>causations</strong> are all one.</p>\n<p>יהוה אחד ושמו אחד,דארייתא וקדוש ברוך הוא אחד ומי כעמך ישראל גוי אחד בארץ</p>\n<p>And yet, we are also taught that there is a <em>Written Torah</em>, the five books of Moshe, and an <em>Oral Torah</em> which is all the teachings found in the entire oral tradition, in Mishnah, Agadah, Halacha and Midrash which comprise the Talmud and all the other Holy books of Jewish tradition.</p>\n<p>One could imagine that this <em>Oral Torah</em> was something else, something extraneous and additional to what we have received from G-d directly. But this is contrary to Jewish tradition.</p>\n<p>Encoded in the written Torah itself, encoded according to all the many detailed requirements that go into the formation and meanings of the letters and text of the written Torah itself (the laws of Safrut and the details of the Masorites), which in the broader sense are also the grammatical dimension of Hebrew letters and language comprising the text, are concealed the entire oral Torah. This encoding is also called the <em>Parpra'ot</em>, meaning <em>the auxiliaries of Wisdom</em> like in Mishnah Avot 3:18. This means that to comprehend the Wisdom of the Torah, <em><strong>these methods are indispensable</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>And this method of encoding was also taught to Moshe Rabbeinu, both while he was in the cloud, receiving the ten commandments at Mount Sinai and also what he was taught in Egypt in the Yeshivah in Goshen from that tradition which had been transmitted to Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaacov and their forebears like Shem, <em>as in Malchizedek</em> and Eiver, Methuselah, Chanoch all the way back to Adam.</p>\n<p>Many of these encoding methods are found for example in the introductions to published Talmud today, like the <a href=\"https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12935-rules-of-eliezer-b-jose-ha-gelili-the-thirty-two\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">32 Hermeneutical Rules of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yossi HaGalili</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Weekday_Siddur_Chabad%2C_Shacharit%2C_Morning_Prayer.41?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">13 Middot of Rabbi Yishmael by which the written Torah is explained</a>. Another large part of this encoding method can be found in the remnant of the books which we have today from Rabbi Akiva ben Yosef, The Letters of Rabbi Akiva and also The Crowns of Rabbi Akiva, both of which are mentioned explicitly in the Talmud. These last two are referenced and quoted extensively in later generations by people such as Ramban and the Tur in their commentaries to the written Torah, or in the sefer Halacha called Sefer Ohr Zaruah.</p>\n<p>In this context, it is also worth noting that what we have today of the entire oral Torah is reported to have come to us solely through the teachings of Rabbi Akiva via his five surviving students.</p>\n<p>Other early sources which contain other details of this encoding method are, for example, Sefer Yetzirah, a book also mention in Talmud and attributed to Avraham Avinu, Sefer Ma'ayan HaChochma, a book attributed to Moshe Rabbeinu dealing with many of these methods, and Sefer Raziel HaMalach, a book given by the Angel, Raziel to Adam HaRishon after the sin of the tree of Knowledge of Good and its opposite.</p>\n<p>In a general sense, this idea of how the Oral Torah is encoded and dressed within the Written Torah follows the concept of Klal and Prat hinted at in the names of the final two parshiyot of the book of Shemot, <em>VaYakhel</em>, which has a connotation of wholeness (the Congregation) and <em>Pekudei</em>, which has a connotation of enumeration. These parshiyot deal with the construction of the Tabernacle where G-d's presence is revealed. And in a similar sense, the book of Bereshit and in particular the first Parsha are paradigms from which the balance of the Written Torah evolve from. And the essence of the whole five books of the Written Torah are likewise encoded and contained within the words and letters of the ten Commandments which in turn are encoded the first commandment and the first word of that commandment (אנכי).</p>\n<p>You also ask if these methods can bring you to interpretations that you could not reach by reading at face value? If this part of your question is understood correctly, you mean can these the encoding methods lead to divergent understanding that is in conflict with and contrary to G-d's will?</p>\n<p>The answer is yes. The general rule for this is that we are told to conform with whatever is required by halacha, which is generally understood to be the plain sense of the text. But a more nuanced way of understanding this is that the halacha relates to how we connect to physical reality, the universe in which we live. We are to be involved with the real, physical world, reality and truth.</p>\n<p>In the language of theoretical physics, those interpretations which seem to depart from the confines or boundaries of halacha are like <em>alternate universes</em>. In the nomenclature of Kabbalah and Chassidut this is often called <em>the Sitra Achra</em>, the <em>Other Side</em>, which is contrary to Torah, meaning G-d's Will and is associated with and leads to the opposite of life. Like it is written in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.14.28?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BaMidbar 14:28</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am life, says G-d!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

You are He whose Unity is infinite and absolute, and therefore indivisible. You are He1, transcendent beyond all that is above, and concealed behind all that is concealed. No thought whatsoever can grasp You. <em><strong>But You are He who brought forth ten rectifications - we call them the ten sefirot</strong></em> Atzilut - with which to regulate hidden worlds that are not revealed, as well as worlds that are revealed. Indeed, it is through these that You are hidden from human beings. You are He who binds them and unifies them. And inasmuch as You are within them, anyone who separates one from the other is regarded as having caused a separation in You.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This text is recited by many at Mincha of erev Shabbat.</p>\n<p>If you continue to read the text cited above it explains how the Sefirot correspond to G-d's name.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואלו עשר הספירות, משתלשלות כסדרן: אחת ארוכה, ואחת קצרה, ואחת בינונית. ואתה הוא שמנהיג אותם, ואין מי שינהיג אותך, לא למעלה, לא למטה ולא משום צד. לבושים הכנת להם, מהם פורחות נשמות לבני אדם, וכמה גופים הכנת להם שנקראים גוף לגבי הלבושים המכסים עליהם, ונקראים בתיקונם כך: חסד - זרוע ימין, גבורה - זרוע שמאל, תפארת - הגוף. נצח והוד - שתי שוקיים. יסוד - סיום הגוף, אות ברית קודש. מלכות - פה, תורה שבעל פה היא נקראת.</p>\n<p>חכמה - המוח, והוא פנימיות המחשבה. בינה - היא הלב, ובה הלב מבין. ועל שני אלו כתוב \"הַנִּסְתָּרתֹ לַה' אלהֵינוּ\". כתר עליון הוא, והוא כתר מלכות, ועליו נאמר - \"מגִּיד מֵרֵאשִּית אַחֲרִּית\", והיינו תפילין של ראש. בפנימיות הוא יו\"ד ה\"א וא\"ו ה\"א, והוא בדרך אצילות, המשקה את האילן בזרועותיו וענפיו, כמים המשקים לאילן ומתגדלים אותו בהשקיה זו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That in this text, the Sefirot are equated with the letters of G-d's name (יהוה). They are imagined in vertical orientation, from top to bottom beginning with the letter Yud.</p>\n<p>In orientation like this, they form the shape which corresponds with and is the paradigm for a male physical body. It also corresponds to the form of the Mishkan and Mikdash when viewing it from above. For details, see diagrams relating to Hilchot Beit HaBechirah in the Mishneh Torah.</p>\n<p>The letter Yud corresponding with the head which contains the brain of Chochmah. The Kutz or Crown at the top of Yud is Keter.</p>\n<p>The Nexus point between the bottom of the Yud, the cross beam of the first Heh and the top of the Vav is the place of the heart which corresponds to Binah. This is why Binah is described with the qualities of breadth and depth.</p>\n<p>The right and left arms of the first letter Heh correspond with Chesed and Gevurah.</p>\n<p>The main body of the letter Vav corresponds with Tiferet.</p>\n<p>The nexus point between the end of the Vav and the cross beam of the second Heh is called <em>the end of the body</em>. This corresponds with Yesod while the right and left legs of the second Heh correspond to Netzach and Hod.</p>\n<p>What is called the <em>Mouth</em> is referring to what would correspond to the mouth of the genitals. That corresponds to Malchut.</p>\n<p>There is a similar, but different scheme for G-d's name which corresponds to the human female. But that is not outlined in this section of the Zohar.</p>\n\n\n",

However given that Hillel was explicitly mentioned here, it has left me curious as to the veracity of the claim.</p>\n<p>Is there any credence to the idea that Hillel did away with the year of Jubilee? If there were, was there any particular rationalization for that move?</p>\n<p>If not, is this poster equivocating a different event or decree to Hillel [ or anything else for that matter ]?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Truth is priceless, lies are free. The N.T. <em>loves</em> to paint Jews as nasty, and poor unsuspecting readers buy it without a second thought.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbatical_Year_and_the_Jubilee.10.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a>, the mitzvot of the Jubilee came to an end when the tribes began to become exiled, because of the pasuk written on the Liberty Bell (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 25:10</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You shall make the fiftieth year holy. You shall proclaim freedom throughout the land for all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once the the tribes of Reuven and Gad and half the tribe of Menasheh were exiled, the land no longer had \"all its inhabitants\". This is when the mitzvot of Jubilee ceased (may it be reinstituted after the gathering of all the exiled immediately!).</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the point the poster in your quote is making is actually a law of Shmita (Sabbatical Year), not Yovel (Jubilee). This is when all are bound to forgive their debts, and it happens every 7 years, not every 50.</p>\n<p>Hillel did indeed institute the concept of a pruzbul - a legal document that prevents the cancellation of debts during Shmita. I am happy to quote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prozbul\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wikipedia</a> in this case, given we are answering for the nonsense of conspiratorial Christians, who might be surprised to find that a source that isn't \"controlled by the elders of zion\" that disagrees with them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Torah mandates a Sabbatical year, Shmita, every seventh year (not to be confused with the Jubilee, which is the year following seven cycles of Shmita).<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbatical_Year_and_the_Jubilee.10.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> Among other things, the departure of the Sabbatical year cancels all debts. This is one of the many laws in the Torah meant to protect the poor and disadvantaged, affording them a chance to escape from eternal debt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conversely, the law harmed the lenders who would never be reimbursed once the Sabbatical year ended to remit all debts. The wealthy refused to loan money during the latter years of the seven-year cycle, refusing the poor even a temporary opportunity to make ends meet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rabbis of the time found the state of affairs to be both a major challenge to the status quo and a violation of numerous mitzvot, Torah commandments, that require magnanimity to the poor, including one within the aforementioned passage in Deuteronomy.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prozbul\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3</a> The rabbis, under the suggestion of Hillel the Elder, created a loophole in Jewish law, in which a legal document would accompany the interest-free loans (charging interest to fellow Jews is forbidden in the Torah) issued by individuals that stated that the loans were to be transferred to the courts as the law of remission does not apply to loans within the public domain. This groundbreaking institution benefited both borrower and lender; because lenders knew their money was safe even following the Sabbatical year, they were likely to loan to the poor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So basically, the pruzbul was instituted by Hillel in order to help the poor, not hinder them. The Torah and the Rabbis were very conscious of the reality of human nature, and realised that the people were no longer on the level where they could keep this mitzva properly in a way that does what it was intended to do - assist the poor. People were refusing to lend because they were afraid they would just have to wipe it off, especially if it was close to the next Shmita. So the pruzbul became the solution.</p>\n<p>I just want to add something further here, if I may. Part of the lie is based on a falsehood - lending money to the poor is a means to control and oppress them. In fact, the Torah makes it <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.66?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a mitzva</a> to lend money to the poor because, well, it is a MITZVA (a dignified way to get someone back on his feet in a time of need, that is sustainable). The Sefer HaChinuch (link above) explains how it is an even greater mitzva than charity (and, believe it or not, <strong>not</strong> because we side with the rich over the poor! Check it out, and note how there is no mitzva to lend money to the rich, so clearly this is for the benefit of the poor only).</p>\n<p>The Rabbis <em>obligated</em> rich people to lend to the poor, and kept them in check - they are not allowed to insist on it being paid back if they know the borrower can't, and many other wonderous details about how to be a lender in the most moral way possible. The poor should thank God every day that Jesus didn't get his way on this... If people were declining to load back then, we can only imagine what would be nowadays...</p>\n<p>Also, the pruzbul didn't \"get rid\" of the lending laws. On the contrary, the pruzbul is optional, and many Jews today decline to get one, or get one simply as a precaution against accidentally claiming a debt that is halachically written off, but generally let go of the debt unofficially anyway.</p>\n\n\n",

A tree is on the border of the city of refuge; the trunk in one location and the branches in another. Rabbi Yehudah holds that the location of the branches determines the law for the whole tree. This creates a problem when the trunk is inside the city of refuge. If we follow the principle that the location of the branches fixes the law, it will be allowed to kill the AK at the trunk inside the refuge city which seems most unreasonable.</p>\n<p>Rava said that it can be explained as follows: In the case where its trunk is inside the boundary and its boughs outside, and the AK was standing at its trunk, everyone agrees that the BR may not kill him, and when Rabbi Yehuda said that the trunk follows the boughs, he did not intend to include that case.</p>\n<p>If the AK is standing among the boughs of the tree, and the BR is able to kill him with arrows and pebbles, everyone, including the Rabbis, agrees that the BR may kill him, as the boughs are outside the city.</p>\n<p>Why does the gemoro require arrows and pebbles?

However, if the BR can circumvent the route of having to go through the trunk then the trunk is meaningless to him, whereas if he'd have to go by way of the trunk he can't consider that spot to be outside the city boundary, according to Chachamim.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this point we are speaking of a tree whose branches are too high to reach directly. This is a more direct illustration of the difference, rather than discussing two types of trees: the variable is the action rather than the scenario.</p>\n\n\n",

They ask whether מת מצוה or Megillah reading is preferred- either Megillah is because it’s פרסום הנס, or מת מצוה is because it’s כבוד הברות. Then as an answer, the Gemara says that מת מצוה is indeed preferred because כבוד הבריות trumps a mitzvah lo ta’aseh…but how is this a proof? So what that kavod trumps a lo ta’aseh? There’s no lo ta’aseh in our case. The Megillah is a mitzvah aseh? Can someone please explain how the Gemara seems to derive from this fact that מת מצוה is preferred</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>See the Rashba there who writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הא דבעא רבא מקרא מגילה ומת מצוה איזה מהן עדיף\nוהדר פשטה דמת מצוה עדיף משום דגדול כבוד הבריות שדוחה לא תעשה שבתורה. תמיה לי מקרא מגילה נמי הא דחי עבודה ותלמוד תורה. ויש לומר דלאו מיהא לא דחי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the point is that Meis Mitzvah is strong enough to push away a Lo Sa'aseh, and Megillah is not strong enough to do so, so Meis Mitzvah is stronger than Megillah, and can push it away.</p>\n<p>The Pnei Yehoshua writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונ״ל ליישב דלאו מדאשכחן דדחי ל״ת שבתורה פשטה לה אלא מלישנא דאמר מר גדול כבוד הבריות שדוחה ל״ת שבתורה ומדמפיק לה בהאי לישנא דגדול כבוד הבריות אלמא דאלים ליה האי סברא טובא ומש״ה נמי פשיטא לן דדחי מגילה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the proof is from the expression גדול כבוד הבריות which teaches how important honoring the dead is.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I like N.T.'s answer. Another thought: although the famous formulation is that human dignity overrides even a negative Torah prohibition, the gemara in Berachot 19a explains that the only torah prohibition it overrides is the prohibition of \"lo tasur\"--not to obey the rabbis (Deuteronomy 17:11).</p>\n<p>In light of this, perhaps the gemara in Megillah is using \"a lo taaseh\" as a code/idiom for the <em>specific</em> lo taaseh of lo tasur. Thus, in other words, maybe pshat in the gemara is that \"met mitzvah trumps mitzvot d'rabanan\" and, therefore, it trumps reading the megillah which is rabbinic.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>We find in Gemara Berachos 19b that the sages removed their mitzvos in order to protect human dignity and the Gemara there explains that the meaning of גדול כבוד הבריות שדוחה ל\"ת שבתורה is referring to מצות דרבנן that are derived of the ל\"ת of לא תסור see שבת כג. Perhaps the Gemara here means the same and ל\"ת is referring to the mitzva of ner chankkah that was removed to protect human dignity.</p>\n\n\n",

Jacob's flight to Padan-Aram took place when he was 77<strong>¹</strong>, so Esau was probably in the ballpark of 80 when went to Ishmael's family and took Mahalath for a wife. Ishmael had died 14 years earlier<strong>²</strong>, so she was a teenager at the least, if we suppose that it was possible for a man to father a child in his 130's to father a child.<strong>³</strong></p>\n<p><strong>¹</strong> Jacob was 130 when he entered Egypt & Joseph 39/38(30 at his elevation to vizier, followed by 7 years of plenty and 2 years of famine before his family made the trip down). It is implied that Joseph's birth took place after Jacob had been in Haran for 14 years as this point signaled the expiration of his work for Rachel and the beginning of 6 years that he worked for Laban's cattle(Genesis 31:41). Esau & Jacob were twins, so they'd be the same age at any relevant event and therefore 77 when Jacob left for Haran(and Esau married Mahalath) 14 years before Joseph's birth.</p>\n<p><strong>²</strong> Ishmael was born when Abraham was 86(Genesis 16:16) and Isaac was when he was 100. Isaac fathered Jacob and Esau when he was 60(Genesis 25:26). Due to the fact that Ishmael died aged 137(Genesis 25:17), we may reckon that the twins were 63 when their uncle passed.</p>\n<p><strong>³</strong> If there are no gaps in David's genealogy(Nahshon - Salmon - Boaz - Obed - Jesse), then we may have a case of a line of men fathering sons at extremely advanced ages so Ishmael could've potentially fathered Mahalath towards the end of his life.</p>\n\n\n",

This is a general question, looking to cover the topic thoroughly. An ideal answer should cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the Torah view men and women as having different natures?</li>\n<li>Where in the Torah is this derived?</li>\n<li>If so, in what ways are men and women different?</li>\n<li>How strongly do those differences apply (i.e. how much overlap is there, how much variability is there in individual men and women)?</li>\n<li>How are we supposed to use the Torah wisdom on this subject in a practical way?

If someone accepts those laws, then I don't see why it's required for them to accept a particular reason suggested later for why. If someone keeps Shabbos but doesn't believe God created the world, we have an issue. The Gemara doesn't say <em>why</em> men have to keep yes-do, time-definite commandments and women don't, only that it is so. Some of the reasons suggested later have to do with different natures (e.g. women don't need as many spiritual gimmicks) ... but those are just some suggestions that came hundreds of years later -- they aren't game-changers.</p>\n<p>Now if someone says \"I shall be the judge and jury that this law was based on faulty assumptions about gender and therefore the law doesn't apply to me anymore\" ... then we've gone beyond the bounds of Orthodoxy.</p>\n<p>I'll close with an anecdote: a friend of mine met with a certain well-known rosh yeshiva's wife, talked with her a while, and remarked -- <em>well you're an incredibly learned woman.</em> She replied: *how could you say such a thing?

The secular approach tends to be that if there is an issue, then something is wrong and has to go. In this case, if there is a \"war of the sexes\", then the idea of \"sexes\" needs to go to end the war. The Torah approach however is that if something in Hashem's perfect creation is not working properly, it's because we are doing it wrong and need to figure out how to do it right. In this case, we are looking at it too superficially, and the Torah's response is <em>go deeper</em>, and states unashamedly that there is no greater hatred of women than to tell her that her femininity is bad/wrong and must go out the window (same goes for men).</p>\n<p>In this answer I hope to bring together the words of many great Rabbis who have taught the inner dimension of male and female, from the kabbalah, and chassidus. For further reading/listening from Rabbonim who say it infinitely better than I ever could, I recommend Rabbi Tatz's Living Inspired, Rabbi Yitchok Ginsburg's discourses, and anything you can find by Rabbi Moshe Miller A\"H on the topic. I hope to cover all the points in the question and I note I will not be adding any words or ideas of my own, and in particular I am basing this answer on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIkya1vczJE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this lecture \"The Kabbalah of Male and Female\"</a> by Rabbi Manis Friedman, who is a master of the topic and a student of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who also covered much of this in his <em>sichot</em> (which you can find on Chabad.org) and I strongly recommend listening to all <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@manisfriedman/playlists\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his talks</a> on this topic. Finally, may I strongly recommend \"<a href=\"https://lpitorah.org/the-story-of-our-lives/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Story of Our Lives</a>\" by Yaakov Klein, which explores the connection between femininity and Malchut, which will be heavily connected to the themes in this answer of women being the purpose, the end goal, of creation.</p>\n<p>I apologise for the length, but these ideas shouldn't be <em>too</em> simplified (which I apologise that I will inevitably end up doing even at such great length... please do take my advice for further reading!).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Torah explains that God created \"Adam\", male and female, and said it was \"very good\". Then a few verses later, he said \"it's not good\", and he took a part of Adam and made Chava. This requires analysis. Hashem does not change His mind or require adjustments in His plan as He goes along, so what's going on here?</p>\n<p>We have to come to an understanding of why Hashem made both male and female, and why female was necessary if there was already male (Hashem doesn't make anything redundant!). Hashem initially made a man, who had a female dimension. He then split off a woman (who has a male dimension). He then commanded them to get back together, something possible because they were once one (there's nothing new under the sun).</p>\n<p>Hashem created the world, and a physical universe needs certain things. One of the things that a physical universe needs is a male. When He made that, He said that it was \"very good\" because it is. A physical, finite universe has what it needs - a male. This is stage 1. Things are <em>not good</em> yet for stage 2. What is stage 2? Stage 2 is to take this finite, imperfect universe, and make it holy, through commandments, Godliness and goodness, so that it should become a dwelling place for Hashem Himself. So for <em>this part of the plan</em> man alone is not good. Not \"he is not good alone\", <strong>it</strong> will not be good if he is alone. To understand why this is, we must first discuss the masculine attribute that Hashem created, then the feminine:</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The masculine is <em>a process</em>. The finite universe needs to <em>become</em> receptive to good and an infinite God; it is far from complete. Masculine is a step towards a goal - foreskin, the wheat for matza, the wax for shabbat candles, the leather for tefilin - it's all a process that needs to be transformed into Godliness, and when Moshiach comes the world will gain eternity when it becomes one with Hashem. Man is created as part of this side of things - a mortal finite creature, incomplete and imperfect, with a need to transform and become Godly. This is why men have a need to fix and pursue and find purpose and mission. This is why in the kabbalah, the male is linked with <em>time</em>. Time is a process where things \"happen\", and that's the male (interestingly, this is why there are 14 mitzvot women are exempt from, because they are time bound).</p>\n<p>However, Hashem noted that this masculine energy will not guarantee the world reaches its purpose - a holy, complete world. \"It\" - the plan - is not good. Where will the man get the momentum, the motivation, the clarity of vision, to complete the plan?</p>\n<p><em>A mashal is given, where a group of scientists get together to plan a mission to go explore another star. This kind of mission will take many millenia to see through, so they have to send a whole community, a generational starship. They discuss the issues of the cleanliness, and morale. The issues of wear and tear and degredation. Then one scientist brings up a really big problem. He says \"what about the great great grandchildren of the original crew, when they wake up one day and say 'who said we are heading for a star? Has anyone actually seen earth?'. The control room they are not allowed to go into, because only the high priest is allowed to go there, they say 'enough of this, anyone can go in'.... The scientists hit the nail on the head about this same issue we are discussing. How are we supposed to guarantee they won't just say \"forget the process, things are fine the way they are, let's make the best of it...\".</em></p>\n<p>Hashem made woman to \"help\" with this.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So what is a woman? When God created man, it was because creation needed a man. But woman wasn't created as a means to an end. Woman is created because <em>He</em> needed her. Female is an end in itself.</p>\n<p>Another way to put it, Hashem invested Godliness in man, to be processed and refined and brought to completion. Hashem invested Godliness in a woman perfectly as it is supposed to be, and the goal is to maintain it, nurture it and share it. This is what is meant by the phrase \"to work it and to keep it\" (Bereshit 2:15) - it is referring to the male and female aspects.</p>\n<p>Another way to put it. It is the nature of man to be \"aggressive\" and the female to be \"passive\". Let's not understand this superficially or we risk re-igniting the war of the sexes! As I said at the start, let's go deeper. \"Aggressive\" means, there is something I don't have yet, I go out and seek it. <em>Acquisitive</em>. \"Passive\", which is often just as much (if not more) work, strength, energy, is the art of <em>defending, maintaining and nurturing what's already precious</em>. A lioness defending her cubs is <strong>not weak</strong>. This is why the child belongs to the mother (if she is Jewish, he/she is Jewish, if not, not). The innocent child is already good, a Divine gift of Godliness, and the woman is the mother, she <em>is</em> the child, and she is the home. The father is concerned, must provide but it's not the same.</p>\n<p>This is also why the 6 days of the week are \"masculine\", where the work is done. Shabbat is the <em>Queen</em>, it is the <em>destination</em>, the <em>reason and purpose</em> we work on those 6 days. It is also why women make the <em>bracha</em> \"who made me according to His will\". Men cannot make this <em>bracha</em> because they aren't made a finished product like women are. They must process themselves and the world to become what it needs to be: feminine!</p>\n<p>When the process gets side-tracked, confused and direction is lost, women have always saved the day. When in Egypt the men became Egyptianized, the women brought them back and enabled the redemption to take place. When the men became Hellenised by the Greeks, the women brought the nation back on track. No women participated in the Golden Calf, and it was the women who donated to the subsequent Mishkan.</p>\n<p>It should be noted, when the world is full of dragons, <em>the dragon slayers get all the attention</em>. However, why would anyone slay a dragon if there was no one to save from the dragon? Why would soldiers go out to war if there wasn't someone precious to protect? Why would a doctor qualify if there was no \"lay man\" to heal? Without women, men have no purpose (perhaps this is why men can get very touchy about feminism, whose main line is \"women need men like a fish needs a bicycle\" - when a man hears that, he hears that he has no purpose to exist...). So who is the ikar? The masculine or the feminine?</p>\n<p>In Kabbalah, there are two sides, the side of kindness and the side of severity. Which one is male and which is female? It might surprise many to learn that Kabbalah describes the masculine as Chesed, and the feminine as Gevura. Chesed is indiscriminate, everyone can have everything, very open. Gevura, however, is discriminate. It judges, it weighs, it sees value and this power of being able to discern leads to the intuitive ability to see the truth that women tend to have. This is the reason women are not allowed to be judges. They  already know who is telling the truth before any case has been made! Men have to go through the process, but women, before they can even get to the process, know who is guilty. For this reason, they are disqualified in the same way a prophet is disqualified! A case <em>must</em> have a process, circumventing it means there is no chance for appeal. Rabbi Meir would consult his wife whenever he would rule on a case!</p>\n<p>As we move closer to Moshiach, there are fewer dragons to slay, and the masculine trait becomes less and less, and the feminine trait becomes more and more dominant. What do you do with the <em>good things</em> in life? Who knows how to take care of the holy, Godly things in life? The feminine. <em>This</em> feminine trait within man has to become more dominant - they must seek out that which has always been Godly and good, and nurture it. As Moshiach comes, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/685137/jewish/Voice-of-the-Bride.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the wife becomes \"the crown of the husband</a>\". Hashem didn't put men into a world that is <em>purely</em> dark, and <em>purely</em> evil, for us to struggle with on our own. He placed the goodness here as well - hidden for 5000 years - and the time has come to notice it, to cherish it, to savour the Godliness and goodness that Hashem placed into the feminine all along.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Conclusions:</p>\n<p>Hashem distinguished masculine and feminine by giving them different energies. They get ta'anug, satisfaction and pleasure from different things. The masculine gets pleasure and satisfaction from fixing the world, from starting out finite and becoming Godly. The feminine gets pleasure from nurturing and savouring that which has always been Godly ever since Hashem said \"I will make you a help mate\".</p>\n<p>As a result, many differences arise between the nature of male and female, but this difference is stemming in a very deep place in the psyche. The way this arises to the more superficial aspects of our psyche can lead to some overlap. Hashem also gave us a share of each others' energies - there is a feminine aspect within a man that he can relate to, and visa versa. However, the differences are deep, and important, and will lead to measurable differences in the personalities and character traits of men and women (on a statistical basis), and the sages captured many of these differences in their writings in the Talmud (some of which are mentioned by Dr. Maurice Mizrachi in his answer, for example). We should be aware of them, as good personal advice to which each person will relate to in a personal way, and we should certainly not mock each other for our differences.</p>\n<p>This knowledge is true and therefore binding, it is from Hashem's Blueprints themselves, and if we ignore it or start mixing things up between masculine and feminine, we will end up dissatisfied, confused and depressed, especially if the feminine were to try to become more masculine right around the time the <em>world</em> is becoming more feminine! The Kabbalah is Hashem's deepest wisdom. The fact that it paints these things more deeply and extensively than the Talmud may be due to the fact that the Sages were not allowed to teach the secret part of Torah back then, and the revelation of the meaning of every lesson in the Torah has been a hard-earned slow and methodical process throughout our history of maturing and deepening our understanding... but it is the deepest truth on the matter, an illumination of Hashem's secrets and we should be glad to know our true natures, our inner selves, and where our energy is coming from, and use it, take pleasure in it, and realise that both the masculine and feminine are different expressions of One Godliness. We should use our talents, stay true to our Godly natures, and men and women should feel how valid and vital they are to Hashem's purposes B'EH, and feel empowered by it.</p>\n<p>Women are the real treasure of the world, the purpose of creation and the feminine millennium, where we move into our eternal Home with Hashem, and enjoy the hard work of 3000 years, is right round the corner.</p>\n\n\n",

Yalkut Yosef says in Brachot 228:16</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Contemporary Poskim debated whether the blessing of <em>ose ma'ase bereshit</em> is to be recited over other natural phenomena that inspire wonder and awe, such as volcanic eruptions, caverns of stalactites and stalagmites, natural geysers and waterfalls. <strong>In practice, we must apply the principle of <em>safek berakhot lehakel</em> and recite the blessing without pronouncing God's Name</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The footnote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <em>Or Letziyon</em> (Vol. II, 46:62) ruled that this blessing is to be recited upon entering a cavern filled with stalagmites and stalactites...Obviously, he was certain that these features have <strong>existed since the world's creation</strong>... According to the <em>Or Letziyon</em> the list of phenomena in the Mishna - thunder, lightning, <strong>shooting stars</strong> etc. are only examples of natural awe-inspiring phenomena... Harav Hayim Kanyevski ruled that the blessing can be recited over those phenomena listed in the Mishna only. The <em>Halakha Berura</em> (page 481) concurred with this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding Rivers, the footnote for (ibid) 9:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the <em>Mishna Berura</em> (228:5) cited the <em>Eliya Rabba</em> rule that if one has reason to suspect that the section of the river he is viewing was diverted at some time, he must not recite the blessing. In the <em>Sha'ar Hatziyun</em> he cited the <em>Peri Megadim</em> who ruled that unless one knows otherwise, one may assume that it was not diverted, but he added that he is reluctant to rely on that. <strong>We must apply the principle of <em>safek berakhot lehakel</em>. This matter needs more research.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, the most contemporary poskim have not thoroughly investigated even the matter of rivers.</p>\n<p>The principle does seem to be the same between rivers and all other natural phenomena this bracha is stated on - it is to do with whether they have existed since creation. The question becomes, does a \"diverted shooting star\" fall into the \"diverted river\" camp?</p>\n<p>On the one hand, a shooting star that would have been seen before it is diverted, can be considered as still something that has \"existed since creation\", but on the other, one can make this argument about diverted rivers as well. All we have done is divert it, but it's not like we <em>made</em> the river. Still, the diversion removes it from its status as \"existing since creation\" and we no longer say a bracha on it.</p>\n<p>So we should certainly not feel qualified to give an answer here on Mi Yodeyah, and leave it to the gadolei adar to do \"more research\" and get back to us on the matter.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, it seems <em>safek berakhot lehakel</em> is a very strong principle when there's even the slightest doubt (and it seems there's a strong reason to doubt here) as the Yalkut Yosef does with these \"other natural phenomena\" even though he is very pro-saying shem u'malchut for the \"special brachot\" in general (see ibid 224, 226-229), so certainly in this case, until the gadolim do the research, I wouldn't say a bracha with shem u'malchut on a diverted comet.</p>\n<p>Remember, Mi Yodeya answers are never intended to be taken as psak.</p>\n\n\n",

I see many people quoting the Talmud, Rambam, etc. Being ignorant of the writings outside of the Tanakh considered to be authoritative, I would like to know where to start. I am familiar with the Scriptures, but where does the authority level go from there?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Pretty much it goes by when it was written- so after Tanakh, which takes the most precedence and can’t be argued with or altered, you have the Mishnah. Mishnah is the Oral Torah written down in a concise and to-the-point way (it was written down out of fear of it being forgotten during a time of Roman persecution). The Mishnah was compiled in about 200 CE. After this you have the Talmud (written around 500 CE) which takes the next precedence and can’t argue with the Mishnah. So for example, people in the Talmud, called Amoraim, can never disagree with people in the Mishnah, called Tannaim. The Talmud was really the last of the major players in Jewish law. Everything else that comes after is simply interpretation of the Talmud, and therefore anyone after this time is allowed to (and has) argue with each other. So you mentioned the Rambam, and he was alive in the 1100’s. His words aren’t “holy” in the same way as the Mishnah or Talmud, but rather he’s just interpreting the law that the Talmud argues about. We then have the Shulchan Aruch (another code of Jewish law) written in the 1500’s. Many times the Shulchan Aruch argues with the Rambam, and they’re allowed to do this despite the Rambam coming first historically because no one who comes after the Talmud has precedence over the other. All modern commentators are just formulating their viewpoints based on the Talmud and Mishnah. Jewish law today doesn’t strictly follow one commentator, but rather many different people follow many different laws.</p>\n<p>In short: after Tanakh you have the Mishnah which is the next most authoritative, then the Talmud, and then regarding anyone else who comes after that (Rambam, Ramban, Rashi, Raavad, Shulchan Aruch…) they’re allowed to disagree with each other and no one takes authority over the other (but none of them of course can disagree with the Talmud or Mishnah).</p>\n<p>Also the overlying principle of the earlier writings having more importance than later ones is that we believe that as the generations go on, the people of each generation lose holiness. So someone living during the time of the Mishnah period was much more learned and smart than someone living hundreds of years later. And therefore, any viewpoint expressed in the Mishnah or Gemara is regarded with much importance.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Crying on Rosh Hashanah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When the Jews gathered at the water gate in Jerusalem on Rosh Hashanah to hear Ezra and the Levites read them the Torah, they cried. Hearing the Torah read and explained made them realize how far they were from living up to God's expectations. Seeing as Rosh Hashanah is the day <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.1.2?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">when all mankind is judged</a>, one might expect penitent tears to be very appropriate as this is a powerful way to show God that you are ready to stop sinning and start living up to his expectations. Good intentions aside, Nehemiah, Ezra and the Levites admonished the crying Jews (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.8.9-11?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nehemiah 8</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויאמר נחמיה הוא התרשתא ועזרא הכהן הספר והלוים המבינים את העם לכל העם היום קדש הוא ליהוה\nאלהיכם אל תתאבלו ואל תבכו כי בוכים כל העם כשמעם את דברי התורה ויאמר להם לכו אכלו משמנים ושתו ממתקים ושלחו מנות לאין נכון לו כי קדוש היום לאדנינו ואל תעצבו כי חדות יהוה היא מעזכם והלוים מחשים לכל העם לאמר הסו כי היום קדש ואל תעצבו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The leaders repeat the admonition against sadness three times, presumably because the temptation to cry was very great. Despite this ancient exhortation against crying on Rosh Hashanah, <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hayyim Vital</a> tells us that his teacher Isaac Luria cried a great deal during the Rosh Hashanah prayers.\nVital further informs us that his teacher said that מי שאין בכי' נופלת עליו בימים האלו הוא הוראה שאין נשמתו הגונה ושלימה. This quotation from Luria of course <em>might</em> be limited to the days of repentance that follow Rosh Hashanah, but because the main focus of that paragraph is Rosh Hashanah specifically the plain sense suggests that Luria's intention was for Rosh Hashanah as well.\nThe reader is left wondering whether Isaac Luria disagreed with Nehemiah and Ezra or whether there is a way to reconcile these differing views on how to observe Rosh Hashanah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Ovadia Yosef Yichaveh Daas (2:69) and Rav Moshe Shternbuch in Teshuvos V'hanhogos (2:268)  answers this question by saying that although you should not cry in a depressed or scared sense on Rosh Hashana if someone does so as the result of a natural  emotion of enthusiasm and devotion then it is appropriate.</p>\n<p>Without explicitly referring to the contradiction in the OPs question others also make similar distinctions depending on what is motivating the person to cry.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Shternbuch in Teshuvot Vihanhagot 2:268 quotes both the opinion of the Vilna Gaon (Sefer Maaseh Rav 207) that it is forbidden to cry, and the Arizal (Baer Heitev 584) that it is a sign of a good neshama if you cry. The former refers to crying from gloom, the latter can be explained by a ma'amar I once learned in Sefer Ma'amarim 5691 (I think it was Tik'u Bachodesh but can't chazer it now):</p>\n<p>All of life for most of us is our nefesh bahamis. That's who we are. Our nefesh Elokis is a background influence, and occasionally is able to break through. When it does so, we have lucid moments of strong, deep, emotional connection to Hashem. On Rosh Hashana, we get a tremendous amount of siata dishmaya with regards to this, our nefesh Elokis is able to awaken our nefesh bahamis to feel a strong, powerful connection to Hashem, and this is often expressed through powerful tears. The tears are hard to put into words, but certainly they are not coming from depression or gloom. It is a combination of love, awe, yearning, appreciating the magnitude of the day, and so much more. It is a moment when our nefesh Elokis shows us who we really are, behind the grubby, coarse guf.</p>\n<p>It never lasts, it is never meant to. We are supposed to go back and try, over and over, to achieve even a drop of this in our tefillot under our own efforts. Like a bolt of lightning in a dark stormy journey, we are given a little flash of where we are supposed to go, once a year, so we can keep pushing through the darkness in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Note: It says in The Baer Heitiv (684:3) says in the name of the Arizal that if one instinctively cries on Rosh Hashana, it is a sign that he is being judged at that moment!</p>\n\n\n",

I know nothing about Kabala so I don't understand this answer myself but I've seen it been explained that a tallis katton should be influencing you internally whereas a tallis gadol should be influencing your dealings with the external world that  you come in contact.

(see the Biur Halacha on Orach Chaim 530.)  Some understand that the work on Chol Hamoed is rabbinically prohibited, with this Gemora being an asmachta. According to that, they probably did work until the prohibition against it was enacted. Unless Moshe Rabbeinu himself first added this rabbinical prohibition.</p>\n<p>Others understand it to be saying that work on Chol Hamoed is Biblically prohibited. According to that, there must have been some work prohibitions on Chol Hamoed.</p>\n<p>The concept of \"Lo mosron Hakosov eleh l'chachomim\" (that the Torah left it up to Chazal to figure out the exact parameter) comes up elsewhere too. The Chazon Ish (Yodoyim 8:17) explains the concept in a general sense: There frequently are competing calculations of the correct course of action. In halachic terms: \"mi nidcha mpnei mi\". The Torah is instructing the Rabbis to decide on the proper one. (I.e. which work prohibition would or would not have other considerations causing them (not) to be prohibited.)</p>\n<p>Possibility: Long ago, which work was prohibited on Chol Hamoed was decided by the Rabbis of that generation, depending on the situations they were facing. Afterwards there came a time when a universal Rabbinic consensus made the rules permanent and immutable.</p>\n<p>The later authorities cite an oft-quoted Gemora in Yerushalmi. In this Gemora, Rav Abba Bar Mommal said: If he could find others who agree with him, he would allow some of the prohibited work on Chol Hamoed. The later authorities cite this Gemora as an indication that there was a <strong>possible</strong> fluid nature of the work prohibition on Chol Ha'Moed at that time. Even if a Beis Din (Jewish court) that was bigger in number and wisdom had already prohibited that particular work prohibition. However, the authorities don't consider this proof to be 100% conclusive.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why did Rachel steal her father's gods?",
    "content": "# Why did Rachel steal her father's gods?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When the righteous have the opportunity to dispose of gods they do so. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jacob buried alien gods under the terebinth in Shechem (Gen 35.4).</li>\n<li>Moses burned the golden calf, ground up its ashes and had Israel drink the resulting powder (Ex 32.20).</li>\n<li>Hezekiah destroyed Moses' bronze serpent after Israel started worshipping it (Kings 2.18.4).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When Rachel found her father's gods she chose to <em>steal</em> them instead of destroying or otherwise disposing of them (Gen 31.19). Such behavior seems much more like that of the Danites (Judges 18.17) than that of Jacob, Moses and Hezekiah. Unlike the Danites, Rachel is remembered as a righteous person (Jer 31.15; Ruth 4.11), so the reader is left wondering why she stole her father's gods. The explanations in <em><a href=\"https://maagarim.hebrew-academy.org.il/Pages/PMain.aspx?mishibbur=640000&page=41\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer</a></em> are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לפ'כ גנבתם רחל שלא יגידו ללבן שברח יעקב ולא עוד אלא להכרית ע'ז מבית אביה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first explanation is given in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Vayetzei.12.1?vhe=Midrash_Tanchuma_--_Torat_Emet&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Tanhuma</em></a> while second explanation is used in <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bereschitrabba02albe/page/863/mode/1up?view=theater\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Genesis Rabbah</em></a>.\nּBoth of these explanations are negative - Rachel thought it would be harmful for her Jacob and for Laban if Laban continued to possess these gods. Neither explains why Rachel <em>stole</em> them instead of merely disposing of them or destroying them.</p>\n<p>After posting this, I saw that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/50331\">a nearly identical question</a> already exists on this site. The asker there assumes that Rachel had to either steal or destroy her father's gods. I am not convinced she had to <em>either</em> so perhaps my question is sufficiently different to be considered a separate question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Some say she stole them in order to wean Lavan off of idolatory (e.g. Rashi).</p>\n<p>Ibn Ezra asks a kasha on this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That teraphim are idols can be ascertained by Laban’s referring to\nthem as gods (v. 30). Some say that Rachel stole the teraphim in\norder to keep her father from idolatry. If this were the case, why\ndid she take them with her and not bury them on the way?</p>\n<p>The most likely reason that Rachel stole the teraphim was that Laban,\nher father, was an astrologer, and Rachel feared that he would look at\nthe stars and discover which way they fled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Radak says on this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to Ibn Ezra each tablet had the face of a human being and was presumed to get inspiration from celestial regions. Rachel’s objective in stealing the Teraphim was to deny Lavan knowledge about the route Yaakov had taken when he left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to this, she stole them in order to prevent Lavan from using them to find Yaacov.</p>\n<p>However, there is still a case to be made about \"weaning off idolatory\", from Rabbeinu Chananel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותגנב רחל את התרפים אשר לאביה; she stole them in order that he would reconsider his actions, saying to himself that any deity which allows itself to be stolen surely cannot be much good to anyone. The same argument had been used by Yoash who said if baal was really capable of avenging himself, he should do so himself instead of letting his human worshippers become his defender (Judges 6,31). Similar arguments are reflected in Ezekiel 28,9 where the prophet predicts the downfall of the King of Tzor (Tyre) who had declared himself a god. He ridicules this “god” as saying to his murderer: “I am a god!” (quoted by Rabbeinu Bachya).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that he is saying that if they were destroyed, then fine - there are ways of accomplishing that would have made sense to Lavan. But them being stolen is something that would make him realise that they are powerless.</p>\n<p>Rav Hirsch also emphasises this by saying \"they had to make it clear to Lavan they were powerless\".</p>\n<p>This still doesn't answer why she didn't have an <em>obligation</em> to destroy/bury them. An answer brought by Ramban is that they were not necessarily <em>only</em> idols. Tur HaAroch says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ramban admits that it is possible that Lavan had been using the\nteraphim in his worship of idolatry. It is however by no means certain\nthat teraphim served only as idols. We certainly would not expect to\ncome across idols in King David’s residence, and yet we are told in\nSamuel I 19,13 that Michal, David’s wife placed such teraphim in\nDavid’s bed, feigning that it was he who was sleeping in that bed.\nSurely, David did not keep idolatrous figures in his home. It is most\nlikely that the teraphim were objects which enabled people to know the\ntime of day, and in that connection they were also used to help them\nto predict future events...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She likely wasn't under obligation to destroy them as a result, which helps fill in the holes left by the previous answers. They were \"inaccurate prediction devices, similar to clocks\", and therefore they are permissible to use by someone who knows they have no power of their own and puts her trust in Hashem.</p>\n<p>However, he goes on to argue against the above explanations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...Some commentators believe that Rachel stole the teraphim in order to\nwean her father from practicing idolatry. If that were so indeed, why\ndid she keep these teraphim with her instead of at least burying them?\nIt is far more likely that Rachel, being aware that her father was an\nastrologer, was afraid that by a combination of astrology and the\nteraphim he would succeed in tracking the movements of Yaakov and his\nfamily and he would overtake them in short order. Another view is that\nshe took the teraphim so that these would not reveal to him where\nYaakov was at that time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Surprisingly, he seems to be saying that she was simply denying him use of them, rather than trying to prove any sort of point. I would imagine she didn't have any obligation to destroy them, <strong>so the quickest thing to do in that shaas hadchak was to shove them into a bag and run</strong>.</p>\n<p>Pirkei D'Rebbi Eliezer 36:14 combines both answers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On that account had Rachel stolen them, so that they should not tell\nLaban that Jacob had fled, and not only that, <strong>but also to remove\nidolatrous worship from her father's house.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sefer HaYashar Bereshit Vayetze 5 notes that it was, ultimately, pointless:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Rachel stole those images of her ‎father so that he should not be\nable to ascertain whither Jacob had gone. And when Laban ‎returned\nhome he asked for Jacob and his household and they could not be found,\nand he ‎went seeking his images to find out whither Jacob had gone.\nAnd Laban went to other images ‎and making inquiries they told him\nthat Jacob had fled to the house of his father in Canaan.‎</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, yes. This is a very good question, controversial amongst the commentaries and hard to see if we really do have a good answer. Still, there's a strong case to make that she had no obligation to destroy them, and stealing them was more effective in weaning her father off of them, which hopefully answers the main thrust of your question.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does God not like to be flattered?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard from a Hasidic rabbi that God doesn't like people who flatter him, even literally in those terms. He cites the episode of Moses that confronts God's position of putting an end to the people with their murmurings and blasphemies in the desert and making a new people from Moses, in which Moses then asks that he erase him from the book of life because that would be a affronts the promise he made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Does this reflect the thinking of this rabbi? Or did he overdo it in that position? Does the case of Abraham bargaining with God instead of coldly accepting the decision to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah also go this way? He says that Noah had a cold understanding of God, accepting the reality of the flood without contesting or bargaining with God for that generation, saying that Noah was a righteous person different from a righteous one of the Jewish people because they contest God and Noah did not contest. Does this have corroboration in the Jewish bosom? Does God sometimes test a person with extreme actions expecting him to behave in a different way to expose the person's true excellence? In the case of Moses, this rabbi said that Moses could agree with God, destroy these people, yes, be filled with pride and be the common progenitor of a new people, but he was not arrogant to that point, showing humility and mercy with those stiff-necked people.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here is a list of the 9 categories of flattery. None of them apply to God. You are perhaps wondering if category 6 applies to God, but certainly it does not. We do not view God as committing evil when He brings about suffering, we consider Him Just. The examples of biblical figures who \"argued with God\" are all presuming He is Just, and are seeing if they can argue for <em>Mercy</em>, because God expects us to abhor suffering, and do anything we can to alleviate it. He also abhors suffering (even though it is necessary) and makes us His partner in ending it for good.</p>\n<p>Here are the 9 categories of flattery, as promised, summarised from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Orchot_Tzadikim.24.1?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orchot Tzaddikim 24</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flattery may be divided into nine categories.

And there is a type of flattery which one pays to the mighty, so\nthat they will like them and raise them up and make them great.</p>\n<p>The fourth category of flattery is he who becomes a companion to the\nwicked. Even though he does not flatter him and does not praise him,\nbut since he is near to him and in his company, he will be punished.\nNot only does he not rebuke him, but on the contrary, he brings him\nnear to him in companionship, and puts him at a distance from his\nrebuke, and there is a sin in this.</p>\n<p>The fifth category is a man who is trustworthy in the eyes of all the\npeople, and to whom everybody listens, and who appoints his relative\nas synagogue warden or as Rabbi, saying, \"I have appointed him because\nhe is wise,\" when the fact of the matter is not so, all the people\nrely upon him.</p>\n<p>The sixth category of flattery is he who is in a position to protest\nagainst an evil and does not protest, nor does he pay any attention to\nthe deeds of the sinners. This thing comes close to flattery, for then\nthe sinners think, \"As long as they do not protest and do not reproach\nus, all of our deeds must be good.\"</p>\n<p>The seventh category of flattery is he who sees that the people of his\nplace are very subborn and he says in his heart, \"Perhaps they will\nnot pay any attention if I rebuke them,\" and therefore, he refrains\nfrom reproving them. This, too, is a sin and he will bear his\niniquity, for he did not attempt to warn and rebuke them; if he had\ndone so, perhaps they would have repented.</p>\n<p>The eighth category is he who hears gossip or vile words, or who\nassociates with scoffers and those who shame the Torah and the\ncommandments, and he knows that they are stubborn and that they will\nnot accept rebuke, and therefore is silent. He, too, will be punished,\nfor it is up to him to answer them so they connot say that he is like\nthem and that by his silence he admits the truth of their words.</p>\n<p>The ninth category of flattery is he who honors the wicked because he\nwants to preserve peace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Certainly none of these types of flattery apply to God. If we generalise all of the above to \"insincere praise\", then certainly God does not approve of that either (who would?). He is the God of Truth (Jeremia 10:10) and He knows a person's hidden intentions (Jeremia 17:10)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In regards to the question of if Hashem likes flattery, I can cite the medrash rabba berishes 32,3, that's says the following:</p>\n<p>רבי אליעזר בנו של רבי יוסי הגלילי אמר מצינו שאומרים מקצת שבחו של מי שאמר והיה העולם בפניו וכו</p>\n<p>Basically, even in regards to hashem, one should only say part of hashems praise.</p>\n\n\n",

Ro'ey Hemed (Ro'eh baShoshanim - Hanukah, p.50) cites ten different sources addressing why the Hashmonaim were permitted to use the oil if we are not permitted to benefit from miracles (as per Taanith 24b which your query concerns). Hopefully some of these sources will shed some light on better understanding the principle.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>According to R. Sevi Pesah Frank, that statement only applies for miracles performed לצורך האדם (for human needs) but a miracle that is performed לצורך גבוה (for Divine \"need\") there is no prohibition to benefit from (Miqrai Qodesh, Hanukah 7:12)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Hida (Nahal Qadumim, Pareshath Beshalah) questioned how could the Israelites eat the manna, isn't it prohibited to benefit from miracles? The prohibition only applies to a miracle for an individual because the reliance on the miracle detracts from his merits, however miracles performed for the masses do not so detract and may therefore be benefited from.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>R. Sevi Pesah Frank also quotes the Shu\"T Beth She'arim (OH 238) when a miracle comes to man by means of prayer he should not rely on it, however the Hanukah miracle was different, they did not pray for the oil it simply came to them \"derekh nissim\" (by miraculous means) and it therefore is permitted to benefit from.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Bnei Yisoskhar says that the purpose of the oil was for the performance of a miswa and accordingly the principle of מצוות לאו להנות נתנו (that the benefit derived from a miswa is not deemed hanaah) therefore applies to it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>'Einey Shemuel (Shabboth 21b) citing the Beth Yosef says that precise nature of the miraculous oil oil was unclear. After they put oil in the menorah the jug was still full like it was at the outset, its possible to say that at the time that they filled the oil into the menorah the the jug of oil was also miraculously filled and accordingly it is difficult to determine which oil was actually produced miraculously (that in the menorah or that in the jug). Since the principle that one shouldn't rely on miracles is derabanan and this would be a safeq derabanan, as it is unclear which oil was produced miraculously, it is permitted to benefit.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Shu\"T Ginze Yosef (71b) answers it by resort to the case of the manna which fell for the Israelites in the desert. How could they have eaten it we are prohibited to benefit from miracles? He answers that it was apparent from the nature of the miracle that they were supposed to eat it. Similarly by the the miracle of the jug of oil, if a miracle occurred such that they would be capable of performing the miswa of lighting the menorah it was apparent from the context that they were supposed to use it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>R. Shelomo Kluger in Sefer ha-Haim writes that that which is prohibited to benefit from miracles is rabbinic and that in the Miqdash the they did not decree on rabbinic prohibitions. So even though they generally needed the oil to be of a variety permitted to Yisrael, and this ostensibly was prohibited to Yisrael, it is only a Torah prohibition that they were concerned for not a rabbinic prohibition.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Ben-Yehoyad'a Taanith 25a explains that the reason for the principle that one should not benefit from miracles is that reliance thereon has the effect of detracting from ones merits. If that is so, could it be the case that the righteous for whom miracles occur all the time, that the miracles performed for them detract from their merit? No, there is a difference between the Shem Hawaya and Shem Eloqim. The former transcends nature and the latter operates within it. When a miracle occurs for the righteous it comes from the aspect of the Shem Hawaya and there is no distinction between natural and unnatural within it, therefore it does not need to detract from their merit when a miracle is performed for them. However for the rest of humanity, that is subject to Shem Eloqim and miracles function within the natural order, it would detract from their merits should they benefit therefrom. The Hashmonaim, the sons of Matithyahu were righteous and God acted with them by means of Shem Hawaya and accordingly they were not prohibited to benefit from the miracle.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>One can explain based on the Ta\"Z that there is a difference between a miracle and a blessing, and when an occasion has a din of berakhah it does not have a din of nes, and accordingly no prohibition on its benefit would be applicable. The prohibition only applies to a nes gamur (overt miracle). One sees the same on the occasion of Elisha and Shunamith (presumably the author refers to the miraculous multiplication of her jugs of oil).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Miracles were a feature of the Miqdash, as we see Abaye (Pesahim 64b) held we rely on miracles there for there they are almost like a naturalistic phenomenon, and one can offer that on this basis there was no prohibition to benefit from miracles in the Miqdash since their nature was transformed into something akin to naturalistic and therefore it was permitted to benefit from the miraculous oil.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps the answer lies in the story of the Gemara itself. He said not to purchase the flour sourced by a miracle for flour sourced by natural means will arrive tomorrow. It is not forbidden to rely on a miracle, rather it is appropriate to avoid it when possible. The Rashi you linked to states ובמה דאפשר להתרחק ממעשה ניסים יותר טוב. “To the extent that one could distance himself from the acts of miracles, it is better.” Not forbidden, just advised.

In Mesilat Yesharim, the Ramchal explains the trait of what he calls \"cleanliness\", which is basically a level where someone no longer sins, even in the tiniest details of his actions, speech and thoughts. Included in this level is a lot of points relevant to your question. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ראה נא בענין ההונאה, כמה נקל הוא לאדם להתפתות וליכשל כאשר לכאורה יראה\nלו שראוי הוא להשתדל ליפות סחורתו בעיני האנשים ולהשתכר ביגיע כפיו, לדבר\nעל לב הקונה למען יתרצה לו, ויאמרו על כל זה, יש זריז ונשכר, ויד חרוצים\nתעשיר.</p>\n<p>Consider the prohibition of Onaah (fraud/deceit). How easy it is for a\nperson to be enticed (to find permits - SP) and to stumble in it\n(actual sin - SP). For it appears to him proper to strive to make his\nmerchandise appear appealing to the eyes of people in order to make a\nprofit from the toil of his hands; to try to speak to the prospective\ncustomer's heart in order to convince him (salesman talk). He will\njustify himself on all this citing: \"some are industrious and profit\"\n(Pesachim 50b) or \"the hand of the diligent prospers\" (Mishlei 10:4).</p>\n<p>אמנם אם לא ידקדק וישקול מעשיו הרבה, הנה תחת חטה יצא חוח (איוב ל״א:מ׳):\nכי יעבור בעון ההונאה אשר הוזהרנו עליה (ויקרא כה): ולא תונו איש את\nעמיתו. ואמרו ז\"ל (חולין צד): אפילו לרמות את הגוי, אסור, וקרא כתיב\n(צפניה ג׳:י״ג): שארית ישראל לא יעשו עולה ולא ידברו כזב ולא ימצא בפיהם\nלשון תרמית.</p>\n<p>But if he does not meticulously examine his deeds very carefully,\nthorns will sprout instead of wheat. For he will transgress and\nstumble in the sin of Onaah (fraud) which we were warned against: \"And\nyou shall not oppress one another\" (Vayikra 25:17) and our sages of\nblessed memory said: \"even to deceive a non-Jew is forbidden\" (Chulin\n94a). And scripture states: \"the remnant of Israel shall not do\niniquity nor speak lies, neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in\ntheir mouth\" (Tzefania 3:13).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I strongly recommend learning <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesilat_Yesharim.11.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the whole section</a>, or at least the parts on theft, for more information pertinent to what you are asking. It seems that, while there might not be different \"levels\" of honesty, there certainly are lots of nuances and areas to master that are the purview of someone striving to not simply be a good person, but someone who is trying to be spotlessly good.</p>\n<p>The above continues and explains to what lengths one should go to ensure there is not a trace of falsehood in his business dealings:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן אמרו (בבא מציעא ס): אין מפרכסין את הכלים הישנים שיראו כחדשים.</p>\n<p>Similarly the sages said: \"one may not embellish old merchandise so\nthat it appears new\" (Bava Metzia 60b).</p>\n<p>אין מערבים פירות בפירות אפילו חדשים בחדשים, אפילו סאה בדינר. ואפילו\nיפה דינר וטריסית, לא יערב וימכרם סאה בדינר. כל עושה אלה כל עושה עול\n(דברים כה), וקרוי חמשה שמות: עול, שנאוי, משוקץ (מתועב), חרם, תועבה.</p>\n<p>And in (Sifri Devarim 25:16): \"It is forbidden to mix fruits from\nanother field, even if the latter are just as fresh as the former, and\neven if it is sold at a price of one Seah per Dinar and the mixture is\nworth a Dinar and a Tarsit. Even so, it is forbidden to mix them and\nsell the mixture for a Seah per Dinar.

This teaching reveals to us, the graveness of this\nsin even for a small amount. They further said: \"the rains are\nwithheld only because of the sin of theft\" (Taanit 7b). And \"for a\nbasketful of sins, which sin prosecutes at the head of all of them? -\ntheft\" (Vayikra Raba 33:3).

The word Matrona is Latin in origin.</p>\n<p>Dr. Abramson in the above link noted that several modern scholars think the matronita is a literary device and none or most of these women didn't actually exist. That would serve to explain why they are unnamed. However, he also brings a view by Judith Baskin who suggested that not only these women may have been real, but they may have also been high-class Jewish women. With that said, it seems to me that even if that's the case, these women were not the wives of the rabbis, who are usually referred to as \"bitehu/bitei\" (ביתהו/ביתיה) (for example, Imma Shalom in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.59b.10?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 59b</a>).</p>\n<p>I would guess that in some cases the rabbis did not know the names of the women who spoke to them<sup>2</sup> and in other cases the sages who wrote the gemara did not know/remember the name. It seems that in general, it was not important to the stories to mention the women's names. With that said, keep in mind that comparatively few women are named in Chazalic texts. Not even all of the wives of rabbis that are mentioned are named (for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.33b.6?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 33b</a>).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Eliezer Margaliyot in his essay \"<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24370449#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew and Aramaic in the Talmud and the Midrash</a>\", Leshonenu 27/28, p. 32 noted that the importance of these women is also exemplified by the fact that in many cases, their words are brought in Hebrew and not the lower-class Aramaic, as was the case with the minim (heretics), who often earned the mockery and scorn of Chazal.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> I imagine them, for example, going to discuss a certain subject with an important Roman or Jewish person and being stopped on the way out by that person's wife/sister/other female relative who happened to be there, or perhaps being randomly stopped by such a person in some public area.</p>\n\n\n",

His involvement in arranging his sister Rebekah's marriage implies that he's an adult. He may've been of similar age to Isaac, who was 40 at the time(Genesis 25:20), but was likely younger as Abraham received news of the birth of his brother Nahor's sons, the youngest of whom was Laban's father Bethuel, sometime after Isaac's near-sacrifice(Genesis 22). Without any clearer evidence, we'll have to estimate that he was around 20 when he makes this first appearance.</p>\n<p>20 years later, sometime after Isaac's 60th birthday(Genesis 25:26), Jacob(and Esau) are born. As you mentioned in your question, Jacob was 77 when he arrived in Paddan-Aram so Laban, in my estimation, was ~117 when his nephew showed up.</p>\n<p>Laban may've fathered his first son anytime in the 77 years between his sister's marriage and his nephew's arrival but IIRC, Jewish tradition says that the birth of Laban's sons didn't occur until after Jacob's arrival as they were a result of God's blessing on his house for Jacob's sake. Therefore, the birth of Laban's first son may've taken place anytime between his 20th & 120th year.</p>\n<p>Laban's ~137 when we see him last.

    "content": "# Why is the halachic equinox at a different time?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Artscroll in Taanis 10a note 42 states that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...according to halachah September 21 is not reckoned as the day of the equinox. Rather, the equinox occurs (in this century) on October 7th or 8th.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is the reason/source for this, considering that Chazal were aware of the 365-day solar calendar? And what does it mean \"in this century,\" seeing as the equinox should ostensibly be the same from century to century (based on my limited knowledge of even basic astronomy)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer comes from a complicated discussion of the different calendar systems. Put simply, due to shifts in the calendar viz a viz the seasons (because the earth doesn't orbit the sun in exactly 365.25 days) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XIII\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pope Gregory XIII</a> in 1582 decided to advance that year's calendar by 10 days, so October 4 was followed by October 15 in the newly created <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gregorian calendar</a>. Although the Gregorian calendar essentially has become the universal standard, Judaism doesn't follow Pope Gregory or his calendar, even for solar-related matters (since regardless of this innovation, Judaism has a lunar calendar). This means our reckoning of when the equinox is follows the old calendar set-up (for arguments sake, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Julian Calendar</a>).</p>\n<p>Regarding \"this century\", this refers to how the Gregorian calendar is set up differently than the Julian. Normally every four years there's a 29th day of February. The Gregorian calendar added a caveat that every 100 years doesn't have an extra day (1700, 1800, 1900 didn't have), but every 400 years does (2000 had). Again, we don't follow this convention, so in 2100 the two calendars will drift apart by another day.</p>\n<p>In summary, the Jewish reckoning of the \"solar calendar\" is currently 13 days out of sync with the Gregorian calendar, and every 400 years will drift apart another 3 days. Although, according to this, the fall equinox should be October 4th, not 7th like Artscroll says. Not sure...</p>\n<p>Also see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/11991/1739\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Managability.</p>\n<p>There is an irrational number of days in a year. It's one of those numbers like the square root of 2, or pi, that cannot be written down. So, every calendar is based on an estimate.</p>\n<p>The Jewish calendar uses a pretty precise one, which we call Tequfas Rav Ada (the seasons of Rav Ada) -- 365 days, 5 hours, 997 chalaqim, and 48 rega'im. (A cheileq is 1/18 of a minute, i.e. 1080 per hour, and a rega is 1/64th of a cheileq.)</p>\n<p>Which allowed Sanhedrin to make a calendar, but for something like davening, it has to be within the reach of everyone. And really, do we need to-the-day precision for when the rainy season starts? It's not like seasons actually change on the moment of equinox?</p>\n<p>So for the purposes of the siddur, they decided to go with Shemu'el's simpler, if less accurate, estimate -- a solar year is around 365-1/4 days. In Israel, it was particularly easy -- the Romans were using the Julian calendar, based the same estimate! So there would be a simple rule for when to start, based on the secular date. But even in Babylonia, in the Sassanid Empire, the calculation was more manageable.</p>\n<p>Now that most of the world uses the Gregorian calendar, that simple rule got a little more complicated. But since the change is only once a century, three centuries out of four, life is still pretty easy.</p>\n<p>Every year, the calendar is a quarter of a day off, so the Julian calendar adds a leap day when that error comes to getting the date wrong. But, they start days at midnight. We start days around six hours earlier (a quarter of a 24-hour day), at sunset. So, the way we count days, the error adds up to the next day a quarter of a cycle earlier. So, the rule for \"Vesein Tal\" is that it's a day later the fall <b>before</b> a leap day.</p>\n<p>But again, we aren't really basing ourselves on the Julian calendar. It's just a way to make the rule easy. We are basing ourselves on Tequfas Shemu'el, which just happens to be the same 366-1/4 day estimate for the year as the Julian calendar is based upon. Balancing ease of use and the kind of accuracy the tefillah requires to be useful.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Taken from <a href=\"https://torahclarity.blogspot.com/2021/12/fixing-jewish-calendar.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://torahclarity.blogspot.com/2021/12/fixing-jewish-calendar.html</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Lunisolar Calendar</strong></p>\n<p>It is well known that a year consisting of twelve lunar months is roughly eleven days shorter than the solar year, and that the Jewish year sometimes contains a thirteenth month in order to address this imbalance. The Torah says that Pesach is in 'the month of the spring,' Shavuos is the 'harvest festival' and Sukkos is the 'festival of ingathering (of crops)', and this could not be maintained using a uniform year of twelve lunar months.</p>\n<p>The extra month of Adar Sheni is therefore added in seven out of every nineteen years. The resulting 235 lunar months in nineteen years produce an average year length of 365.2468 days; the actual solar year is 365.2422 days long.[9] The average discrepancy is about seven minutes per year, or a day every 216 years. Cumulatively, this has caused a seasonal drift of around seven days from the time that the calendar was originally fixed.[10] The spring equinox is astronomically on March 20-21, but by halachic calculations is currently on March 27-28.[11]</p>\n<p>[9] The average year length produced by the Jewish calendar is thus more accurate than that produced by the Julian calendar (365.25 days), used by the secular world until 1582, but less accurate than the average year length produced by the Gregorian calendar (365.2425 days). It is interesting to note that were we to update the mean molad interval to a more accurate measure, correcting the inaccuracy in measuring the lunar months, the Jewish calendar would produce a mean year length of 365.2426 days and the inaccuracy of the current lunisolar calendar would also be virtually eliminated.</p>\n<p>[10] The length of the solar year, measured in solar days (the rotation time of the Earth), has not changed significantly over this time (the length measured in fixed length seconds has changed by a similar degree to the change in the length of time taken for the Earth to rotate).</p>\n<p>[11] These halachic calculations are codified by the Rambam in Hilchos Kidush HaChodesh, chapter 9.</p>\n\n\n",

The Malbim writes,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותנאי בנין הבית הוא בעת מנוחה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>the building of the temple is dependent on a time of peace, and only during Solomon's time would there be no need for even an obligatory war (let alone an optional war like some of David's).</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One answer can be provided based on the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.62.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Shocher Tov 62:4</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואת למד מדוד שהיה מצטער לבנות בית המקדש. שנאמר (תהלים קלב א-ג) זכור ה' לדוד את כל ענותו. אשר נשבע לה'. אם אבא באהל ביתי.

As it says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.132.1-3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 132:1-3</a>) \"O LORD, remember in David’s favor all his suffering. How he swore to Hashem...I will not enter into my House\". (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.22.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei HaYamim I 22:14</a>) \"See, by denying myself, I have laid aside for the House of the LORD\". And similarly, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.7.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel II 7:1</a>, \"When the king was settled in his palace and the LORD had granted him safety from all the enemies around him\". He started pondering in his heart and saying (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.7.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7:2</a>) \"Here I am dwelling in a house of cedar, while the Ark of the LORD abides in a tent!\". Nosson (Natan/Nathan) the prophet said to him, \"If only the thought of Hashem in your heart shall ascend\". And he said, (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.13.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel I 13:14</a>) The LORD will seek out a man after His own heart. There was no rising in your heart. Immediately Hashem was revealed to him through Nosson, as it says: (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.7.4-5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel II 7:4-5</a>) \"And it was on that same night, the word of Hashem came to Nosson saying: Go and say to My servant Dovid - Thus said the LORD: Are you the one to build a house for Me to dwell in?\". And one scripture says, (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.17.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei HaYamim I 17:4</a>) \"You are not the one to build a house (for Me to dwell in)\". How will these two scriptures be fulfilled? Rather you will not build me a house, but Shlomo (Solomon) your son will build it. You will build me a house that I call after you. As it says, (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.30.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 30:1</a>) \"A psalm of David. A song for the dedication of the House\". And because you shed a lot of blood, I can't build it by you but in your name and thus you will agonise. When Dovid heard this, he was afraid/aghast, and he said, \"I have been disqualified from building the Temple!\" Rav Yehuda the son of Rav Ilai said, G-d replied to him (Dovid), \"Don't be afraid. By your life, all the blood that you shed was like that of a ram and a deer before me\". As it says, (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.12.24?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 12:24</a>) \"You must pour it out on the ground like water\" He (Dovid) said before Him, \"If so, why can't I build it?\" <strong>He (G-d) said to him, \"It would become revealed and known that Israel were to sin in the future, I would vent my wrath and Israel would be saved. If you were you to build it, it would last forever and never be destroyed\". Dovid said to Him, \"Isn't this a good thing?\" Hashem replied, \"It is better that I vent my wrath (on the Temple) and destroy it, and Israel will be spared.\"</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

When Yaakov designated Levi to be priests and spare them from the slavery of Egypt, Levi didn't want to just sit and watch his brothers suffer, so he named his sons with names that identify them all with suffering: Gershon = stranger, Kehot = broken teeth, Merori = bitterness. He taught us to empathise with the suffering of our brothers, and <strong>this was carried over to Moshe</strong>!

In the <a href=\"http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/MALVINA/mr041.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">original version</a> it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eight candles shine for the Maccabees.<br />\nEight candles shine for the Maccabees.<br />\nDown from the mountains with Liberty's sword,<br />\nThey came like the flame of the Lord.</p>\n<p>Chorus:<br />\nDance the horah,<br />\nLight the menorah,<br />\nThis is the time of joy.<br />\nThe road to freedom we take today<br />\nWith the Maccabees leading the way.</p>\n<p>Eight candles shine for the Maccabees.<br />\nEight candles shine for the Maccabees.<br />\nThe tyrant was routed with all of his men,<br />\nAnd the temple made holy again.</p>\n<p>(Chorus)</p>\n<p>Eight candles shine for the Maccabees.<br />\nEight candles shine for the Maccabees.<br />\nHanukah's children will never forget<br />\nThe glory that shines for us yet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The lines <em>\"Down from the mountains with Liberty's sword\"</em> and <em>\"The road to freedom we take today\"</em> are related to the theme of Passover of being freed from servitude.</p>\n<p>The line <em>\"The tyrant was routed with all of his men\"</em> is thematically similar to a verse that appears in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.14.28?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 14:28</a> when God drowned the Egyptians in the Sea of Reeds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The waters turned back and covered the chariots and the riders—Pharaoh’s entire army that followed them into the sea; not one of them remained.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>as well as a verse in the next chapter, in the Song of the Sea, which was sung by the Israelites after the Egyptian drowned in the Sea of Reeds (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.15.4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 15:4</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Pharaoh’s chariots and his army<br />\nHe has cast into the sea;<br />\nAnd the pick of his officers<br />\nAre drowned in the Sea of Reeds.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In both cases (Reynold's song and the biblical verses), we find the idea of the utter decimation of an evil king and his army.</p>\n<p>If you really want to stretch it, you could tie the <em>\"Dance the Horah\"</em> line to the celebratory dances of the Israelite women (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.15.20?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 15:20</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron’s sister, picked up a hand-drum, and <strong>all the women went out after her in dance</strong> with hand-drums.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But pretty much everything in the song is already connected in ancient sources to the actual story of Chanukah (except maybe the dances, but it's very likely that something of the sort did occur), so there doesn't appear any real reason to see part of the song as directly referring to Passover. Unless, of course, Reynolds stated somewhere that she based the song off of the Passover story or the festival in general.</p>\n\n\n",

It's especially relevant because it's a big factor holding me back from being a shliach tzibbur, which I'd like to be able to do.</p>\n<p>I'm wondering if there might be any techniques that could help me read faster while saying what I'm reading out loud.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This information seems very promising; speed-reading techniques that could work for reading out-loud, as well:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/</a></p>\n<p>In the mean time, I confessed my difficulty to other members of the shul, including the gabbai.

Additionally, the Chofetz Chaim that Yaakov Avinu prayed to be protected from Lavan's lashon hara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.28.20?ven=The_Rashi_chumash_by_Rabbi_Shraga_Silverstein&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 28:20</a>. Add in the connection between Lavan and Balaam (whether a gilgul or ancestor who provided twisted spiritual DNA) that the latter featured:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עַיִן רָעָה, וְרוּחַ גְּבוֹהָה, וְנֶפֶשׁ רְחָבָה, מִתַּלְמִידָיו שֶׁל\nבִּלְעָם הָרָשָׁע - An evil eye, a haughty spirit and a limitless\nappetite he is of the disciples of Balaam, the wicked.

Throw into that mix the fact that Yaakov was negotiating the dual threats of Lavan and Eisav - any hints to this with the multiple mentions of \"לבן <strong>אדמ</strong>דם\" or \"לבנה <strong>אדמ</strong>דמת\" in Tazria?</p>\n\n\n",

I will be quoting the Hebrew for people to CTRL F. Another reference is Ramban's commentary on Genesis 46:1,1 on Sefaria. So did Ramban believe in another uncreated entity besides God, or not?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והמתפלל לכבוד נברא כעובד אלילים</p>\n<p>על שם השכינה שהוא האל יתברך</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tkd7x.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tkd7x.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8tCzu.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8tCzu.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QXlRk.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QXlRk.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There are worlds above נברא. Creation implies from nonexistence, the worlds above creation are caused and contingent on Necessary Being but not created. To argue what the Ramban meant until you know חן would be unproductive.</p>\n<p>The Ramban does not believe in a separate independent reality from the First Cause.  If you think the Ramban thought there were other Absolute Beings, then he would be wrong and a heretic.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>I don't understand the question. The Ramban is clealy coming to avoid the view that the Shechina is something distinct from the Godhead. He's saying that according to Maimonides that it is a כבוד נברא then how can we direct our prayer to it, as that would constitue idolatry (והמתפלל לכבוד נברא כעובד אלילים)? from this the Ramban proves that the Shechina is not somehing \"created\", or something distinct, rather it is to be identified with God himself. So it seems clear that the Ramban did not believe that the Shechina is another entity or being.</p>\n<p>The question to be asked though is how the Ramban reconciled this with the belief in the absolute unity of God. The Ramban's belief seems to be irreconcilable with the belief in the oneness of God. This is something I am grappling with. See my question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/140079/how-did-the-early-kabbalists-reconcile-the-belief-in-sefirot-with-the-absolute-u\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Jastrow thinks they share a common root, but that seems dubious. According to Jastrow they both from from the root P-Q-R meaning to undo or break free. He ties \"apikoros\" in the sense of a heretic to the word אַפְקָרוּתָא, commonly used to mean licentiousness or irreverence. See Jastrow אַפְקָרוּתָא. See also Moed Katan 16 for that shoresh is used in multiple related ways. The word אַפִּיקַרְסִין, and many variations, is pretty common in the talmudim and midrashim and refers to some kind of garment, possibly a robe, turban, or undergarment.

Moreover, such troubles cannot be imposed while the righteous are still living and protecting the people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to this, \"Torah scholars decrease\" means that the tzaddikim in our generation(s) will be spared from these troubles, hence they \"decrease\".</p>\n<p>There are several sources that explain that one who clings to a Torah scholar, is considered as if he clings to the Shechina (starting with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.111b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos 111b</a>, <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/198607/p/149/t/1321172551234/fs/jzwVp8UvvKOQzqb5gk2oMl2WuYXgDKIqD43OJaIAZOLM/start/5392/end/5412/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אגרות ר' יצחק אלחנן</a>, <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/7776/p/15/t/1324469011234/fs/jzwVp8UvvKOQzqb5gk2oMl2WuYXgDKIqD43OJaIAZOLM/start/60/end/64/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מנורת המאור</a>, <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/609902/p/5/t/1324469011234/fs/jzwVp8UvvKOQzqb5gk2oMl2WuYXgDKIqD43OJaIAZOLM/start/7016/end/7024/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אדרת אליהו</a>).</p>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe (Sichos Yud Shvat 5721) <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/2613867/jewish/Likkutei-Sichot-Ki-Savo.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although the body is a limited physical entity stemming from kelipas nogah, while the soul is “an actual part of G‑d,” the two should ultimately work in harmony.

He should come to the awareness that every\none of his limb derives its life-energy from the G‑dly soul.</strong> (emphasis mine).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the explanation of the Rebbe, we can introduce an possible explanation, namely that instead of clinging to the sages, and this way clinging to the Shechina, we need to \"work by ourselves\" in order to literally <em>\"going from strenght to strength\"</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.84.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 84:8</a>; see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Torah_Ohr%2C_Shemot.1.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Ohr by the Alter Rebbe, Shemos 1:9</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Torah_Ohr%2C_Megillat_Esther.9.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Ohr Megillat Esther 9:2</a>). Back in the generation of the Gemara, clinging to the sages would mean clinging to the Shechina. But now, we need to cling to G-d by our own effort, seeking G-d through our own efforts, not by simply clinging to the sages.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, as I pointed out in the question itself, the sefer <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/191864/p/67/t/9889165911225112341234/fs/2x7CjGfz08gaMwswPztdRLggaIBVRa6ukmHmkFp147v4/start/480/end/488/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מוסרי קלצק</a> explains that we do not have anyone to lean on and to ask halachic questions and how to apply them to our lives. This is, as Rashi writes, the protection offered by the sages in the generation.</p>\n<p>Then how do we get protection during the generation in which Moshiach comes? Well, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/127632/27180\">learning Torah</a> ofcourse, but in a broad sense: <strong>performing mitzvos</strong>, since the very word \"mitzvah\" is related to the Aramaic word \"Tzavsa\" which means connection. See for example <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/5968/jewish/Hayom-Yom-Cheshvan-8.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hayom Yom; Cheshvan 8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mitzva is an idiom of tzavta - \"joining,\" \"attachment.\" Whoever\nperforms a mitzva becomes joined to the Essence of G‑d - may He be\nblessed - Who issues that particular command. This is the meaning of\n\"The reward of a mitzva is the mitzva (itself)\":1 His becoming\nattached to the Essence of the En Sof Who ordained the command, is\nitself his reward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually, it is a mitzvah to cling to G-d, as the posuk says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.22?lang=bi&with=Sefer%20HaMitzvot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 11:22</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Positive_Commandments.6.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaMitzvos</a> says that this can be done, when clinging to a Torah scholar, that is the same as clinging to G-d (see also the Gemara mentioned earlier, including the sources mentioned there.). However, when \"Torah scholars decrease\", we are meant to find a way to cling directly to Hashem, without the \"intermediate step\" of clinging to a Torah scholar.</p>\n\n\n",

Yet, if they are bound to find out, it will cause them distress if they feel one doesn't feel comfortable coming to them with one's problems.</p>\n<p>We also don't want to offend them (Ish imo v'aviv tira'u), so there is a side to say tell them the moment one feels they would have insisted one should tell them (especially if they were going to find out anyway). Yet, there is what to consider about not \"bothering\" one's venerated parents with one's problems (especially if they have problems of their own).</p>\n<p>Some extra thoughts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a parent will pray for their children with more kavana than anyone else (source - common sense), so the child would benefit from telling them, so that they can pray for them and their situation. They would also be the first to rush to help without any desire for compensation, and would do so with all their strength. Unfortunate exceptions aside of course.</li>\n<li>a child's natural instinct is to \"cry for their mother\", and a parent's instinct is to protect their child, which might suggest the answer is yes, a child should davka go to their parents when they have problems (everyone is getting what they need). If the halacha is the other way, is it saying anything about these instincts?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Concrete scenarios: Child develops a health concern. Child finds out their town is under threat from a possible enemy attack. Child loses a lot of money. Crime rates go up in the child's area. Child fails an important exam that might mean they fail their course. Child gets arrested.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I just saw in \"Honouring Parents in Halacha\" by Rabbi Tzureil Ta'aseh (Feldheim) pp.67 3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another aspect of honoring one's parents and being in awe of them is\nbeing very careful not to cause them any distress, whether actively or\npassively. Therefore it is best not to tell them bad news that is not\nimportant for them to know, even if it does not affect them directly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Relevant, interesting, although not enough to answer this question.</p>\n\n\n",

The extreme demanding that we exploit the resources in our favor whatever consequences it causes, if there is a consequence since it is a divine commandment in theory there was no consequence. Another basically argues that we use common sense with resources or respect the limits of this exploitation so as not to exhaust resources. What did Judaism say about it, whatever the current of opinion is, majority or minority? Are you going for any of these currents or has your own interpretation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In order to answer your question, I'll explain what the blessing/commandment to be fruitful and multiply, in that same verse, means:</p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachaye, one of our most venerated Medieval Sages, said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our sages in Kidushin 30 have said: “three partners between them\nacquired (contributed to his existence) man. They are: G’d, man’s\nfather and man’s mother.” The purpose of the commandment to procreate\nprofusely is so that the birth of the body be a prelude for the\nacquisition of the intelligent essence of man, his נפש השכלית. It is\nthis intelligent essence which enables him to serve his Creator. Were\nit not for that, man’s superiority to the animals would be nil, i.e.\nמותר האדם מן הבהמה אין, (Kohelet 3,19). When the prophet Ezekiel 23,37\nquotes G’d as saying וגם את בניהן אשר ילדו לי, “and also their\nchildren who have been born to Me,” he meant the children whose\npurpose in being born was to serve G’d. The implication of the verse\nis that all Israelites were born for the sake of His Holy Name, in\norder to serve G’d. The wicked people who see in the purpose of\nproducing children a function of merely populating the universe, to\neat and to drink just like the animals, completely misunderstood what\nthe Torah has in mind with this blessing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The point is: we only exist to serve God. We don't exist for our own benefit or for ourselves, so the premise of the question is wrong. Even our command to master the earth is in the service of God.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that this verse is a commandment to man before the sin, referring to a quite different world, where man is immortal and the world is very blessed. Still, it is saying that Earth is given over to man, and he may do whatever he wants with it in service of God, mining it, using the trees and animals, and removing dangerous animals (see Ramban on 28).</p>\n<p>What is included in service of God? Things like not destroying, a mitzva learned from Deuteronomy 20:19 (See Sefer HaChinuch, Mitzvah 529). One may not destroy something without a positive purpose in the service of God (which includes dwelling in the world as a functioning human society). This includes the Earth. Many say even gentiles are commanded with all the mitzvot that are sensible and of benefit to the world (which is literally this). Regardless, Kohelet Raba 7:13:1 records:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁבָּרָא הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא אֶת אָדָם הָרִאשׁוֹן, נְטָלוֹ וְהֶחֱזִירוֹ עַל כָּל אִילָנֵי גַּן עֵדֶן, וְאָמַר לוֹ, רְאֵה מַעֲשַׂי כַּמָּה נָאִים וּמְשֻׁבָּחִין הֵן, וְכָל מַה שֶּׁבָּרָאתִי בִּשְׁבִילְךָ בָּרָאתִי, תֵּן דַּעְתְּךָ שֶׁלֹא תְקַלְקֵל וְתַחֲרִיב אֶת עוֹלָמִי, שֶׁאִם קִלְקַלְתָּ אֵין מִי שֶׁיְתַקֵּן אַחֲרֶיךָ</p>\n<p>In the time that the Holy One created the first human, He took him and brought him around all the trees of Gan Eden and said: See my works, how lovely and praiseworthy they are, and all I created, for your sake I created it. Put your mind [to this], that you don’t ruin or destroy My world, for if you bring ruin, there is no one who will repair after you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sefer Hachinuch (ibid) states about the mitzva of not destroying fruit trees:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The root of this commandment is well-known - it is in order to teach\nour souls to love good and benefit and to cling to it. And through\nthis, good clings to us and we will distance [ourselves] from all bad\nand destructive things. And this is the way of the pious and people of\n[proper] action - they love peace and are happy for the good of the\ncreatures and bring them close to Torah, and they do not destroy even\na grain of mustard in the world. And they are distressed by all loss\nand destruction that they see; and if they can prevent it, they will\nprevent any destruction with all of their strength. But not so are the\nwicked - the brothers of the destructive spirits. They rejoice in the\ndestruction of the world, and they destroy themselves</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To have it tame and not out of control, like a dog that is tamed and leashed. Or a parent that is strict or regimented toward his children. And regarding resources and exploitation, again the main thing is control of one's self.

    "content": "# Is it clear according to the Torah, that our ultimate existence will truly be eternal and really never end?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Note: I have retracted my proof from the Gemara in Sanhedrin 92a,b. I explain my newfound understanding in my comments to Deuteronomy's Answer.</p>\n<p>First post here. I'll keep this as short as I can. I have Apeirophobia. Check it up (There's virtually no medical recorded information about this phobia historically, and its (granted, rare) occurrence among people like me, seems to be a completely modern phenomenon. In my opinion, it's less a \"fear\" than it is a truly warranted terrible \"dread\" of the existential possibility of eternity. There is much mention throughout the Torah and Rabbinic Literature about \"Olam Va'ed\" and \"Netzach Netzachim\" implying that the Afterlife or Days of Mashiach will last forever/never end. However, I know of two sources which seem to imply we will not exist a truly \"never-ever-ending existence\".</p>\n<p>a) Adon Olam prayer: \"V'achrei kichlos hakol, levado yimloch norah.\" - \"And after the termination of everything, He (God) alone will rule awesomely.\" Edit: I simply don't see an interpretation of these words through the vague (and controversial?) Kabbalistic concept of a perfect world and God being one as fitting with the words. It clearly says, \"after the finishing of everything\" (contextually referring to the creation of any form). According to the kabbalistic interpretation nothing is finished, if anything it only reached the climax! Actually, as I write I am realizing that the word \"Kichlos\" might not necessarly refer to \"termination\" as I wrote above. Maybe it just means \"completion\"! Still, even so it would not work with the simple meaning of the verse since the word \"Levado\"-\"Alone\" isn't the point according to the Kabbalistic understanding. The point is \"As one\".\nLastly, the words from the immediately preceding verse: \"L'eis naaso becheftzo kol, azay melech shemo nikra.\" - \"At a time when everything is done (obviously not in the termination sense) through his will, then 'King' his name we will call.\" those words seem to be referencing the climax of existence, the time when everything will be brought to its final purpose. There it seems more appropriate to apply the Kabbalistic interpretation.</p>\n<p>b) One of the Ani Maamins: \"Ani... Shehaborei yisborach shemo, hu rishon, vehu achron.\" - \"I believe... That the creator blessed be his name, he is first, and he is last.\" This seems to imply that only God is actually eternal in its ultimate sense. (Interestingly, the Rambam doesn't mention the \"last\" aspect in his original formulation of the 13 principles. Edit: According to the simple understanding of this Ani Maamin, the \"being the first\" should perfectly contrast the \"being the last\". I think it's certain that the meaning of \"first\" is even pre- the Kabbalistic unified existence of God. And I suppose the average Kabbalist would agree to there having been such a time. In that case, it should be assumed that the \"Last\" means The same thing. This is also clear from another perspective. Just look at the declaration as a whole. It is quite clearly declaring the Existence of God, absent of ANY OTHER existence, both pre other beings and post other beings!</p>\n<p>Also, though I can't point to anything off-hand, I believe that regardless of the subject of \"eternity of the afterlife\", there are numerous places in the Torah where it says \"leolam va'ed\" and according to the simple explanation it doesn't actually mean \"true eternity\".</p>\n<p>Lastly, we know of the din \"Moridin v'lo maalin\" - \"Being placed in hell and never lifted out of it, even after 12 months\" which applies to heretics and certain other cases. Regardless of the basic argument from Apeirophobia, since God judges \"midah k'neged midah\" - measure for measure, wouldn't actual eternal/never-ever-ending hell be disproportionate to sin which is finite? Or maybe denying God/who is infinite, is considered an infinite sin? This thought can make me tremble to floor and go insane. I can't imagine anyone suffering for all eternity, even someone like Hi*ler yemach shemo. People don't get just how long eternity really is! It actually NEVER ends!</p>\n<p>Please offer your insights.</p>\n<p>Edit: I am now going to add some material of my own in regard to what Judaism says about this subject.</p>\n<p>First there's Rebbe Nechman. One of Rebbe Nachman's most common themes is the concept of Lemailah MeHaZman. I am not sure exactly what he means by it, and there may even be slightly conflicting implications here and there, but an actual fundamentally different type of existence is definitely one simple way of understanding Rebbe Nachman's words. This view seems to be backed up by his brutal slamming of time in our world. He explains that the wiser one becomes the more they realize that time is inherently deficient.</p>\n<p>Secondly, there's evidence (which I reinforce above) from Adon Olam and the Ani Maamin that there will be an end.</p>\n<p>Third, I was very suprised to discover that there is actually only a handful of times (less than ten I believe) in the entire TaNaCH, that it's written \"Leolam Va'ed\"! I thought it was in the hundreds! I didn't have time to study them yet but half or so of them are in psalms, which to my poor knowledge MIGHT allow for excusing the words as \"poetic depictions of all of time\" (but not actual never-ending time).</p>\n<p>Fourth, when it comes to all discussion of what will be in the end of days, the Rambam in, I believe to remember, his commentary on the Mishnayos, says that all opinions about how things will be in the \"End of Days\" are merely opinions. That is, he says that even the things that the Gemara says are not guaranteed!</p>\n<p>Fifth, God's ultimate name YKVK, is the combination of his most distinguishing characteristic. Always was, is and always will be. This theme permeates through the entire Torah. I think that to say that us souls will live eternally, possibly takes away from the uniqueness of God in that respect.</p>\n<p>That's enough for now, I may add more soon, but I think this is enough to indicate that it may not be so \"clear\" that eternity is a fact in Judaism.</p>\n<p>Edit: Another proof is from the Gemarah in Chagigah 11b. It says 'One who thinks about what is above the world, what is below, what was before and what will be after, it's better that he never came to the world.\" This clearly seems to indicate an end.</p>\n<p>You may ask what about the psukim which use the word \"Netzach\"?\nWell, what does Netzach mean exactly I ask back? Well, I tell you that what I do know is that the word is not intended to mean a literal eternity. I know this because many psukim use the word in context of complaining to God about \"never-ending\" suffering or lack of judgement! That can't be literal! Also, there's a pasuk comparing the eternity of the righteous to the stars. If eternity is literally \"never-ending\" then that's a really weak comparison. We know stars die. Even after they turn into a black hole they slowly evaporate.

Similar to the fear of the vastness of space or whatever else is so beyond our limitations and comprehensions. Whereas in the next world we won't be timebound physical beings, so it won't be a problem. Eternity won't be a billion years then another bazillion etc, it will just be us being.

I'd like to elaborate a little bit more on that latter point in this answer.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is, time is just a creation by Hashem. There are sources that state it is a necessary creation for Hashem's plan. When Moshiach comes, time will \"stop\", <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yefeh_To%27ar_on_Bereshit_Rabbah.67.2.6?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah,_Vilna,_1878&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">it will be eternal present</a>.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yeshaya Horowitz in Shenei Luchot Haberit (Asarah Maamarot, 1 40B-41A) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A common perception.... is that God created everything out of absolute\nnothingness... and that in the beginning of creation, God imparted to\nthe hosts of heaven [i.e. the forces of nature] the power and ability\nto run the world... The world thus operates according to its manner,\nas if God has let go of His creation; it is only that occasionally God\nmay desire to override. But as long as God does not override it, the\nworld urns on the power it obtained at the time of creation.</p>\n<p>But the true fath... is that God \"in His goodness renews each day,\nconstantly, the first act of creation,\" actively directing His flow of\nvitality. Should God cease to do so for even an instant, all would be\nas naught; it's existence would be utterly nullified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Tanya, Sha'ar Hayichud veemuna Ch1. the Rebbe writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is written (Tehillim 119:89) \"Forever, Hashem, Your word stands\nfirm in the heavens\"... So it also is with all created things in all\nthe supernal and lower worlds, even this physical earth and inanimate\nmatter: If the letters of the \"ten utterances\" by which the world was\ncreated during the six days of creation were to depart from it but for\nan instant, God forbid, it would literally revert to naught and\nabsolute nothingness, exactly as before the six days of creation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A good mashal is a video game. If you walk the character off a cliff, he \"dies\". But if you simply turn off the game, he doesn't \"die\", but the entire game ceases to be as if it never was.</p>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe writes in Likutei Sichot 6 p88:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Time is itself a created reality, .... should the divine autterance\ncease to create, time will also cease to exist. So there would not\nremain anything of the world at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Kabbalah, we have this idea of chochma and bina. Chochma is the higher part of the intellect that \"thinks in concepts, not words\". When you are searching for answer to a question, and then you \"aha\" get it, that moment of aha is timeless, you got the idea all at once in a single instant. You have to then feed that idea to your bina, which is that part of your intellect that \"thinks in words\". It explains the idea in words, it may even be many thousands of words to fully unpack the idea, that was all there at that very moment.</p>\n<p>The purpose of creation is so that Hashem can be known (ata horeta l'daat). In His infinite wisdom, He chose to teach us about Himself as a teacher teaches to a student, through mashal. As I wrote in the other answer, according to \"Veyadata\", this whole creation is a mashal for Hashem, but it's one of those absolutely perfect mashals, where everything about the Nimshal is accurately represented (and eventually, the mashal and Nimshal will become One). A teacher who already has the chochma, but wants to impart it to his students, he must \"take the time\" to spell it out, bit by bit, mashal by mashal, until they finally get it. When they do get it though, the mashal falls away, and becomes simply a place holder for the truth of the larger, true concept of the nimshal.</p>\n<p>This is the purpose of time (Malchut d'Atzilut), to reveal to us the higher divine truths that Hashem wishes us to understand about Himself that wouldn't fit into our finite world (so they are put in, bit by bit, <em>over time</em>), as well as give us an area with which to apply them, perform them, and do teshuva. Teshuva, interestingly, can \"rewrite\" time, by converting past misdeeds into merits (Yoma 86b - which hints at the true purpose of time: Free Will)! But still, time is just a creation, an illusion, something that isn't required in the long run. As the Tzemach Tzedek says in Derech Mitzvotecha 57B-58B:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Time is a creation, something new brought into being out of\nnothingness, like all other creations. Only God is timeless.... For\nGod is utterly beyond time, even of time as an incalculable expanse...\nRather all is continual present to Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an essay by Rabbi Binyomin Walters \"The Time before Time\" he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The ultimate intent for creation is to reveal God Himself in our\nworld. Time as we know it reveals higher spiritual realities (the\nsoul) within our limits. Yet, the difference between us and these\nspiritual realms is only relative. Ultimately, we will experience God\nHimself, Who transcends all limitations.</p>\n<p>Points can never gain length by their own right, but when length -\neven the smallest length - is defined in terms of points, it creates\ninfinite points.... So too, time can be viewed on three levels or dimensions:\nas finite time, as infinite time, or as infinite time within finite\ntime. If time is viewed as finite, it is a series of points, definite\nparts and not a continuum. When time and space are viewed this way,\ntime and motion work in increments like the frames of a movie. Space\nmay also be viewed this way (and to be consistent, it must be), as\nexisting in definite parts.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if time and space are viewed as infinite, they are\na continuum and not a series of points. Rather, each movement and\nchange is a single fluid unit. In this scheme, time and space are like\nline segments - they are finite in the realm of lines, but infinite in\nthe realm of points, and points have no relevance to their world.</p>\n<p>There is also a third way to think of time, when the infinite descends\nwithin the finite. This is like how a line encompasses infinite points\nand creates an infinite series of points when expressed in terms of\npoints. Thus for every infinitely small point of space, there is an\ninfinitely small point of time. This is indeed a paradox, for the mind\ncannot comprehend this. Here, the points take on the quality of a\nline, which should be impossible, because the points are series, they\nlack any length, so how can length be made out of them? The answer is\nthat although points cannot make length of their own accord, the\nfinite numbers can never reach infinitely, yet when infinity descends\ninto the finite, the finite is able to become infinite too.</p>\n<p>Although such a leaf is illogical, nay impossible, when viewed by the\nstandards of the finite, there can still be recognition that this is\nso and that this is possible for a higher power, not bound by the same\nlimits. In this way, time can be both points and a continuum. Such\nphenomena are the result of a higher realm interfacing and merging\nwith a lower one. This is the purpose of time in general - to bridge a\nhigher realm with a lower, as explained previously.</p>\n<p>This is one of the ways the Infinite Creator is revealed in our world.\nThe fact that matter is infinitely divisible and that time is\ninfinitely divisible and that the world is set in such a way that it\ncan continue forever and that matter cannot be destroyed all reveal\nsomething of God's infinity within our finite world. Particularly, the\nability to merge the finite with the infinite points to God, for only\nGod, Who is beyond the limits of both finite and infinite, can merge\nthe two.</p>\n<p>And so, very soon, we will experience infinite time, with the coming\nof Moshiach. That time is described as the \"day that is all long\",\nmeaning completely infinite time. Furthermore, \"all\" long implies that\nits beginning is long like its end. This means that  not only will we\nexperience God for eternity in an infinite future, we will also\nretroactively experience Him in an infinite past, extending even\nbefore the world was created. For the world is made with an Author, a\nBook and a Story. And just like a story starts in the middle of a\nscene with a completely world, so too our world started mid-scene. But\nin the time of Moshiach, God will reveal everything to us, including\nhis intent of the past history of the world. And just as God is\ninfinite, so too will the revelation of Him in our finite world be\ninfinite, breaking all bounds in all directions and all dimensions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the above mashal, we can (so to speak) understand the Tzemach Tzedek - that Hashem sees all of time as \"present\". From a higher point of view, an infinity can be seen as a single (therefore \"finite\") totality. When there is no more \"work\" to be done, no improvement to be made, we won't need time as we know it anymore, and things will be different. From Hashem's point of view, time is as if absolutely nothing, l'havdil like we would consider \"time\" in a video game.</p>\n<p>Somehow, Hashem has offered us a bridge, to get closer to Him and attach ourselves to Him (and this might answer your point about how it might detract from Him if we say our souls are eternal - their eternity <em>is</em> Him). It will take an eternity, of course, but that eternity is still something that will \"come to an end\" from His point of view. Even from our point of view, it won't be an eternity as we know it, and we can't describe it, nor do we know much about it anyway as it is all a big secret. The only real thing we know about it, is it will be <em>wonderful</em>. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_One%2C_On_the_Purpose_of_Creation.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The best good God can give</a>, and certainly utterly devoid of all forms of suffering or deficiency or pain.</p>\n<p>Just like we avoid dwelling on our own mortality and death, most people avoid dwelling on scary concepts like eternity. If one is having trouble doing this, aside from increasing Torah knowledge which is the cure to all illness, any Rabbi worth his salt would strongly urge a person to go and seek professional help so they can have a balanced and stable emotional life in order to serve Hashem. All we can offer is the former here on Mi Yodeya, but we are obligated to urge you to also pursue the latter.</p>\n<p>I'll finish on this: I was once by a Nevardok Rosh Yeshiva for shabbat and I asked him if we will get to see, after 120 or Moshiach, what the Avot etc looked like, as I really want to. He laughed and said \"I can absolutely assure you that what you want now is not what you are going to want then\". Take away from this is, we have no business concerning ourselves with what will happen in the future simply because we can't possibly know what <em>it</em> will be like, nor what <em>we</em> will be like then.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>PART I</p>\n<p>In this section I cite traditional rabbinic sources as to the view of the immortality of the soul.</p>\n<p>The immortality of the soul is an undisputed belief within Rabbinic Judaism. That the righteous attain to immortality is incontrovertibly upheld by our Baale ha-Mesorah. The Geonim, Rishonim, Aharonim posit and espouse this belief, and arguably a denial of it is a denial of the fundamental belief in sekhar w’onesh (reward and punishment).</p>\n<p>Here are some citations to consider. If/when I have time, I will continue to add to it the list:</p>\n<p>The Rambam unequivocally endorses the immortality of the soul, see H. Teshubha 8:1 and 9:2, MN 3:54, and intro to commentary on Pereq Heleq.</p>\n<p>Ibn Ezra on Gen. 1:26, 3:24, Isaiah 51:6 (and I’m sure many other cites) affirms it.</p>\n<p>Yehudah ha-Lewi, Kuzari 1:103 – Judaism without a doubt affirms the immortality of the soul.</p>\n<p>The Ralbag dedicates the first entire treatise of Sefer Milhamoth Hashem to this topic. There are also many places throughout his commentary on Tanakh where he employs the term החיים הנצחיים… so many times that it is nearly impossible to count (especially in his commentary on Misheli) , eg. Mishle 3:16, Mishlei 4:4</p>\n<p>R.  Shemuel ibn Tibbon in the intro to his Sefer Nefesh ha-Adam (his commentary on Qoheleth) is explicit on the immortality of the soul.</p>\n<p>The Ra”n (Rabbenu Nissim of Gerona) endorses the immortality of the soul and says this is the message of Aqedath Yishaq. See Derashoth ha-Ran, sixth derashah and his commentary on the Torah p. 289.</p>\n<p>Rabbenu Hasdai Crescas takes up this view regarding the Aqeda and immortality of the soul in his Ohr Hashem, treatise 3, principle 3, section 3.</p>\n<p>R. Yosef Albo in Sefer ha-Iqarim section 4, ch. 36 argues for the immortality of the soul and posits that this is the traditional view of the rabbis.</p>\n<p>Shelomo b. Semah Duran (Rashbas) in Hesheq Shelomo repeatedly returns to the theme of the immortality of the soul.</p>\n<p>Hiddushei Aggadoth (of the Maharsha) on Rosh Hashana 16b discusses the immortal soul of the righteous.</p>\n<p>Malbim on Mishlei 3:16 affirms “orekh yamim” as eternal reward for the soul</p>\n<p>Berith Abhraham on Tehillim 13:6</p>\n<p>R. Shimshon Rafael Hirsch (on Genesis 50) describes Jewish belief as “היהודי מאמין שהנשמה מתקיימת לעולם“</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Part II</p>\n<p>In this section I will break down various methodological errors you made in approach.</p>\n<p>The piyyut Adon ‘Olam is not a source of theology. To the extent that it has been understood to <em>reflect</em> traditional Jewish views, various communities have seen fit to sing it. Not all do sing/recite it and no community deems its recitation an obligatory formal part of tefillah. It does not originate new views in and of itself and most importantly should an interpretation (such as your own) of a given piyyut be at odds with the traditional views of Judaism (see Part I) then that interpretation would be cast aside. The peshat in the phrase ואחרי ככלות הכל is that God alone is an absolute/primary existence upon which all other existence is contingent. That said, I do not see much value in trying to make all kinds of linguistic analyses of poems as they are not themselves an originating source of our theology.</p>\n<p>Similarly, as regards to the recitation of Ani Maamin, there are many different nushaoth, and the text itself does not originate the theology, it is a mere reflection of the Rambam’s postulation of the ‘iqarim. If we are trying to understand his iqarim, we ought analyze them independently rather than look to a poetic reiteration. When one looks back to the originating source, the intent of the author (i.e. the Rambam) is clear (as made above in Part I). Once again, the same peshat applies as in Adon 'Olam - it is an affirmation of the non-contingent nature of God. He is absolute, whereas all other existences are subject to His existence (again, see H. Yesode ha-Torah ch. 1). I would also add that there have even been traditionalists that opposed for various reasons the recitation of Ani Maamin (e.g. Maharal, Maharshal, Lebhush, et al.). I would not delve too deeply into a linguistic analysis of one particular nusah as it is not itself a source of our theology.</p>\n<p>As regards the application of the principle of מורידין ואין מעלין to גיהנום, it is not dispositive of anything. First, I am skeptical that this legal principle ought to apply to an eschatological concept (i.e., גיהנום). However even were one to admit it (as others may have), one can simply claim that the wicked descend, are punished, and are then extinguished from existence (c.f. the Rambam’s description of kareth in his intro to Heleq and his description in H. Teshubha 8:1). This would not facially contradict it, and therefore it cannot be rallied in either direction to answer this question.</p>\n<p>As for Nahman of Breslov, he is generally not a focus of my study. However, he makes clear that he affirms the immortality of the soul in Liqute Moharan:\nועקר החיים נצחיים יהיה לעתיד מחמת הדעת שירבה הדעת שידעו הכל את ה' ועל ידי הדעת יכללו באחדותו ואז יחיו חיים נצחיים כמוהו</p>\n<p>Your statement on לעולם ועד in Tanakh – each instance needs to be analyzed independently and by light of its traditional interpreters. And only then, can you try to parse out a theory. Without this fundamental analysis there is nothing to go on here.</p>\n<p>As for the Rambam, there are several clear sources wherein he affirms the immortality of the soul. There is absolutely no question on this. See Part I above.</p>\n<p>As for the name of God and the notion that the immortality of the soul somehow takes away from the uniqueness of God, it absolutely does not. All of creation is a contingent existence, see H. Yesode ha-Torah 1:2. We are not speaking of co-eternal entities. We are speaking of immortality conferred upon a contingent creation.</p>\n<p>Regarding Hagigah 11b: ironically you are taking away the opposite message than what the traditional interpreters have. See the Rambam’s commentary on the Mishnah there: ונודע כי כל אדם בטבעו משתוקק לכל החכמות כולם בין יהיה טפש או חכם, והאדם על כל פנים מחשב באלו השתי חכמות בתחילת מחשבתו, וישליט מחשבתו עליהם בלי התחלות ובלי מדרגות בחכמות, מנע זה ללמדם והזהיר עליו, ואמר להפחיד אותו המשליט דעתו בהתחלות מבלי הקדמות, כמו שבארנו כל המסתכל בארבעה דברים וכו', ואמר להכניע המשליט שכלו ומחשבתו בדברים האלהיים בדמיונו המופשט בלי התחלה בחכמות. The topic needs to be treated methodically and from the foundation, not in a scattered way.</p>\n<p>As for comparisons of the souls of the righteous to stars and that contemporary astronomy knows that stars eventually die. This again, is a mistaken take away. It is a mashal and within the mashal stars are permanent fixtures (as was historically believed). Modern science doesn’t change the basis of the mashal and therefore similarly it has no bearing on the nimshal.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now if your actual concern is not the immortality of the soul, but rather the perception of [infinite] time by the immortal soul… that is in altogether different matter. There is plenty to suggest that the apprehension of time, from a classical Jewish perspective, is an accident of corporeal existence and does not therefore apply to such a state of existence. We may readily apply the principle of עין לא ראתה – no one is capable of describing what that state of existence is like experientially and therefore there is no use or profit in preoccupying ourselves in trying to understand that which is incomprehensible.</p>\n<p>Again, I think it is methodologically erroneous however to come to the table with a conclusion that you would like (because it is psychologically expedient, or otherwise) and proceed from there attempting to re-interpret texts to draw it into consonance with this predetermined conclusion. An honest analysis, one without foregone conclusions, of the classical sources of Rabbinic Judaism demonstrates a unanimous affirmation of the immortality of the soul. All the twisting, contorting and kvetching, will not change that. If that somehow interferes with your psychological health, the proper tact is not to attempt to change Judaism, it is to get the help you need in a clinical setting. Once you are stable and managing, perhaps then you can return to the topic in absolute sincerity. All the best, and wishing you a רפואה שלמה.</p>\n<p>Endnote:</p>\n<p>I intend not to respond in the comments as I do not think it will be much more helpful beyond this.</p>\n<p>Edit: To the allegation of \"crookedness\" and \"slyness\" there is no such thing of the sort.

Also, do not think that idols are useful for producing a desirable fortune from the stars.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>From these sources, it would seem this concept applies to anyone who is considered a Jew, and not engaging in the practices of the nations. All this to say that what the Torah Anthology Me'am Loez refers to (sexual misdeeds specifically causing a person to be subject to mazal) cannot be ascertained from other sources, as far as I can see.

This is not true. <strong>He is beloved and desirable before the Creator as if he never sinned.</strong>\"</p>\n<p>Therefore the Torah Anthology, Me'am Loez Series, is referring here to someone who is engaging in sexual misdeeds or has done so without ever doing teshuva for these sins.</p>\n\n\n",

Those\nexplanations and details were not transmitted verbatim, but rather G-d\ntaught it to Moshe, and then Moshe (and every teacher after him)\ntransmitted it to his students in his own words. This means that every\nstudent in the chain of the Mesorah (some of whom later became\nteachers themselves) understood those explanations and details using\nhis own LOGIC and passed it on based on HIS understanding. This is\ncompounded by the fact that some things a student learned via reading\nit in a sefer (and not directly from his teacher) – which might have\nrequired even more injection of his own logic to understand.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that each person probably had a slightly different\nversion of the Mesorah (due to the addition of his own logic – which\nwas probably slightly different than another person’s logic), these\ndifferences would be ironed out and corrected over the generations,\nbecause the scholars in every generation analyzed and debated each\nother (and themselves) about the Mesorah that they were receiving and\nthey would have figured out the best version and who to pasken like.</p>\n<p>I am calling this the \"historical process of mistakes and\ncorrections\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(I also have the same understanding of \"historical process of mistakes and corrections\" regarding the Mesorah of the exact laws that the Rabbi's interpreted and legislated).

The Oral Torah was in debate form, and thus every teaching was quoted in the name of the teacher who taught it, which school and which court it came from. When students found that their statements from different teachers were conflicting, they researched it, tracked it down and resolved it, in mainly one of two ways.</p>\n<p>Firstly, when the difference in tradition was contradicting the other, it is resolved by discovering they are talking about different contexts. This resolution process clarifies the Torah, deepening our understanding of Hashem. The other is using the principles that Hashem gave us to resolve the contradiction when it cannot be tracked down through research or reason. This means we know exactly what to do today in light of the confusion (i.e. what was never written down, and now in doubt).</p>\n<p>So yes, a great deal of what we know (for sure) about Hashem today, halacha and haskafa, comes from logic and the intellectual acumen and righteousness of the Sages, may they be blessed, throughout all the generations since prophecy, which everyone is welcome to look at and critique (and marvel at) them selves through Torah study. And the other half is true also, they passed down to us a great deal of crystal clear Mesorah that has survived fully intact since the day it was taught to Moshe our Rabbi.</p>\n<p>In the end, it's all true. In one physical universe, we can only pick one opinion, but they are all true, and this is why Ashkenazim and Sefardim, for example, who often take different opinions in the debates of gemara, don't view each-other as wrong at all. And any lost information (of which there has been some, sadly, although lots of research is also done into what exactly we have lost by our scholars, and things like the girsa changes in gemara by our Rabbis like the Vilna Gaon), will be recovered when Moshiach comes.</p>\n<p>So this boils down to two points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What we have as halacha and hashkafa today, you can take to the bank, that's our true, binding knowledge of Hashem (and there is more still to research and discover)</li>\n<li>The process of the Oral Torah's transmission has been part of a process of vast <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">increase</a> and deepening in our understanding of Hashem</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Rambam spells it out quite clearly in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Sefer Hamada, Transmission of the Oral Law</a>.</p>\n<p>EDIT: After your reword, I think the premise is wrong. The premise is Hashem gave us a perfect, complete Torah 3336 years ago, and since then we've jumbled and messed it up. However, as I've tried to explain here and as the Rambam explains in the above link, that's the wrong way of looking at it. The Torah is not just a transmission, but a dynamic give and take between Hashem and His people, a blossoming flower of knowledge, a process where all of the \"flaws\" are actually avenues to deeper understanding. It was always meant to be like this. The only question you should ask is, who, in every generation, was the recognised court that was in charge of this process. Once you know that, then all you have to do is study it without reserve and be sure that you'll come to true knowledge of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>God spoke it to Moshe Rabbeinu, then he contemplated it.

It seems that the Hebrew philosophy was tribal in nature.  As clans they would have a cohesive nature.  Even if nomadic to any degree, they would have been in a certain, self-prescribed location.

Yehudah ha-Hasid's Sefer Hasidim (רס\"ה). The original context is where he says that if you want someone to regurgitate like an animal that raises its cud, you should have the person eat all that he needs and then take a fistful of sesame and have him swallow it, and then he'll be regurgitating all day long... and for that reason one should not consume sesame (presumably in this aforementioned way) on שבת lest they raise up their food whilst traversing the public domain and thereby violate the prohibition on carrying.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם תחפוץ מאדם שיהא מעלה גרה כבהמה לא תודיעהו שאתה מתכוין לכך לאחר\nשיאכל וישתה כל צרכיו תן לו מלא אגרופיך שומשמין ויכוס אותן ויבלע כל\nהיום יהא מעלה גרה כבהמה לפיכך לא יאכל אדם שומשומין בשבת וכיוצא בו לאחר\nאכילתו שמא יצא לרשות הרבים ומאכל בפיו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later codifiers (Magen Abhraham, Be'er Hetebh, et al), taking R. Yehudah ha-Hasid's folk-medicine (and attendant halakhic advice) as factual, extrapolated from it and suggested that one ought not eat sesame on the eve of Yom Kippur, lest it cause one to regurgitate on YK itself and thereby either violate the prohibition of eating or cause an interruption to prayer.</p>\n<p>It does not seem to be the case that contemporary medicine finds sesame to possess an emetic property, however it would be interesting to see if there are any 12th c. gentile sources from Germany or thereabouts that make similar claims regarding sesame.</p>\n<p>Given that the minhag appears to be based on antiquated medical knowledge, it presents an interesting question concerning whether it ought be deemed authoritative/binding upon those that had previously accepted it.</p>\n\n\n",

The wording does not permit this reading however. The anonymous reporters do <em>not</em> tell Judah that Tamar was pregnant. Instead, they tell him two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tamar has engaged in prostitution.</li>\n<li>Tamar is pregnant through prostitution.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That a pregnant woman is pregnant is eventually obvious to all, but where did these reporters learn the truth about what Tamar had done? Judah did not recognize Tamar when he hired her and none of the people in the area remembered her when Judah tried to send payment. Additionally, the fact that the reporters are telling this to Judah as if it was news to him suggests that they did not know who Tamar had committed prostitution with or they would have surely included this information as well if they realized Judah was in the dark or they would have said nothing at all if they thought Judah knew who he had hired.

This is similar to a statement by our sages in Yevamot 35 “when a woman had illicit sex she engages in all kinds of bodily convulsions to avoid becoming pregnant and thereby revealing her shame and that of her husband or lover.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also the Sforno <a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Parshan/Seforno/Bereshit/38.16#m3e1n0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It can be asked why Yehudah would believe all the accusations.

There she resumed wearing her widow’s clothes. After Judah’s friend Hirah the Adullamite went searching in vain for the woman Judah had lain with, Judah was informed that the widow Tamar was pregnant.</p>\n<p>How would her pregnancy be known so early after conception? It is unlikely there would be obvious physical signs during the first trimester. As an unmarried woman, a widow, Tamar’s condition would be known to the other women of Judah’s household because her menses would have ceased. Such monthly events are to be expected when a woman is not having any sexual relations with a man. Purification rituals have to be observed. When Tamar ceased menstruating, the other women would notice and so word would spread. Judah was informed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution,, and as a result she is now pregnant (Genesis 38:24).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The conclusion reached by the anonymous reporters that Tamar, Judah’s widowed daughter-in-law, must be guilty of prostitution because she was pregnant is easily understood given no man should have had sexual relations with her. The fact that Judah had failed to give Tamar in marriage to his youngest son Shelah would have been common knowledge in Judah’s household.</p>\n<p>Yes, Judah’s friend Hirah the Adullamite went with Judah to Timnah and was also sent back to hand over the promised goat in return for Judah’s seal, cord and staff.  Although he might have suspected Judah lay with a woman who dressed like a shrine prostitute (verse 21), he would have had no idea that this woman was Tamar.  Her face was covered by a veil (verse 14). As a loyal friend, he would have kept the incident with the shrine prostitute secret.</p>\n<p><em><strong>There is no evidence to suggest the reporters knew for a fact that Tamar was a prostitute.  It was the only conclusion they could draw given Tamar was an unmarried widow living in Judah’s household.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The key here is the word <em>zanta</em>. The questioner is reading it as \"she engaged in prostitution\", but the word simply means \"strayed.\" Even if she'd had a five-star wedding with a saintly wonderful fellow who was committed to her for all the right reasons, by their system she was supposed to wait for the younger brother. Thus, as she hadn't been with Shelah, and she was pregnant, she must have <em>strayed</em> from her quasi-fiance, which was a crime -- no matter what that relationship looked like! (That crime was probably punishable by branding, not execution, but that's a different story ...)</p>\n<p>Same thing comes up with a kohen who can't marry a <em>Zonah</em>, by the way. If she was married to Joe, separated from him without obtaining a <em>Gett</em>, and then had a beautiful civil wedding to a lovely fellow named Bob, from a halachic perspective she <em>strayed</em> by having relations with someone other than her halachic husband, and now can't marry a kohen (even after she is widowed from Joe.) On the other hand, if a woman was an escort but ensured that all of her numerous clients were Jewish and not related to her, she is allowed to marry a kohen!</p>\n\n\n",

Reb Shlomo came back from the war all distraught that his father died, so the Beirich Moshe tried to convince him to become rebbe and he saw that it wasn't working.

Why was it necessary to continue the Bobov chassidus? Because there were hundreds of Bobov chassidim after the war left without children, a spouse, and a rebbe. The Satmar Rebbe would strengthen them to have ability to continue for another day. The Satmar rebbe convinced Reb Shlomo and helped him to become the rebbe of these chassidim. Now we see there are thousands of grandchildren from people that he gave strength after war. This is the way I heard the story.</p>\n<p>I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOBOV YESHIVAH OPENED IN THE WEST SIDE OF MANHATTAN WHILE THE SATMAR RAV WAS STILL IN ERETZ YISRAEL.

But just to add a couple of points:</p>\n<p>Dr. <a href=\"https://www.laniertheologicallibrary.org/chaim-cohen-collection/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chaim Cohen</a> (<em>Biblical Hapax Legomena in the Light of Akkadian and Ugaritic</em>, 1978) observed that the Hebrew \"שפרה\" is a possible cognate of the Akkadian \"<a href=\"http://www.assyrianlanguages.org/akkadian/dosearch.php?searchkey=saparru&language=rawakkadian\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>šaparru</em></a>\" (meaning \"net\"). However, this does not imply that the two words share the same meaning. Often, the definitions of cognates diverge in their respective languages, including Semitic languages as closely related as Hebrew, Akkadian, and Ugaritic.</p>\n<p>As Rashi<sup>1</sup> and the <em>Metzudas David</em> observe in their commentaries on <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%90%D7%99%D7%95%D7%91_%D7%9B%D7%95_%D7%99%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Job 26:13</a>, \"שִׁפְרָה\" bears a similarity with the Hebrew word \"שפריר\" (a noun meaning \"canopy\", <em>cf.</em> Jeremiah 43:10, \"וְנָטָה אֶת שַׁפְרִירוֹ\") and may be a <a href=\"https://uhg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stem_piel.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>pi'el</em></a> conjugation (\"He canopied the heavens\"). There's a degree of similarity in meaning between \"canopy\" and \"net\" that is consistent with what you'd expect of Semitic cognates.</p>\n<p>It seems Cohen disregarded this and chose to simply apply the precise Akkadian translation of \"<em>šaparru</em>\" directly to the Hebrew in\nJob 26:13. Professor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naftali_Herz_Tur-Sinai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai</a> took this further and suggested splitting שמים into two words (שָׂם יָם), which he felt would make the verse more consistent with Cohen's translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ברוחו שם ים שפרה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which Prof. Tur-Sinai interprets to mean:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With His wind, He caught the sea in His net</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are a number of problems with this, however. First of all, this emendation appears highly speculative. It is ostensibly motivated to by a preference for associating a net with the sea rather than the heavens (which presupposes that Cohen's translation of \"net\" is compelling, which it is not), as well as a desire to impose a polytheistic Levantine mythological milieu onto Job.</p>\n<p>Secondly, Tur-Sinai's hypothesis would require that שפרה also be emended to \"בְּשִׁפְרָתוֹ\" as a noun with a prepositional prefix and possessive suffix. None of this is indicated in the text.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, Akkadian has <a href=\"http://www.assyrianlanguages.org/akkadian/dosearch.php?searchkey=net&language=english&offset=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">many different words for \"net\"</a>, and \"<a href=\"http://www.assyrianlanguages.org/akkadian/dosearch.php?searchkey=1107&language=id\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>šaparru</em></a>\" carries the sense of a net used for transporting something over land rather than for catching something or for use in the water.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, Tur-Sinai's use of the past participle \"שָׂם\" (\"placed\" or \"put\") seems a bit unusual in this context. In Biblical Hebrew, when \"שָׂם\" or other conjugations of its root operate on large features of geography or nature (the land, the sea, the sky, countries, cities, etc.), and specifically when those features are the direct object of an independent clause, they typically mean \"made\" or \"transformed\" rather than \"placed\" or \"put\" (<em>e.g.</em>, \"Who made [שָׂם] the whole world?\" Job 34:13, where \"world\" is the direct object<sup>2</sup>).</p>\n<p>By contrast, when describing the Almighty's physical movement of these large features of geography, the verses tend to employ a variegated assortment of different verbs, some of which appear in this very chapter (26) of Job (\"נֹטֶה צָפוֹן\", \"תֹּלֶה אֶרֶץ\", \"רָגַע הַיָּם\") and elsewhere (\"הַמַּעְתִּיק הָרִים\" in 9:5, \"הַמַּרְגִּיז אֶרֶץ מִמְּקוֹמָהּ\" in 9:6, \"נֹטֶה שָׁמַיִם\" in 9:8, as well as other conjugations of נתן, שלח, רקע, etc.). If Job 26:13 is indeed describing placing the sea into a net, one might have expected some such verb to appear. Alas, it does not.</p>\n<p>Finally, the word \"שָׁמַיִם\" (\"heavens\") that appears in the Masoretic text of Job 26:13 also shows up hundreds of times throughout the Bible. On the other hand, there are <strong>zero</strong> Biblical appearances of word pair (\"שם ים\") with which Tur-Sinai wishes to replace it. This itself renders Tur-Sinai's emendation improbable.</p>\n<p>Professor Tur-Sinai's approach to this verse seems to require a lot of unnecessary tinkering. Even if one insists on using Cohen's speculative translation of \"שפרה\" as \"net\", it would be far less linguistically problematic to just use it as is (\"With His wind, the heavens are a net\"<sup>3</sup>) and leave the text alone.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup><sub>Note that Rashi (on Job 26:12 and Isaiah 27:1) identifies both \"רָהַב\" and \"נָחָשׁ בָּרִחַ\" as allegorical references to Egypt, the former based on the identification provided by Isaiah 30:7 (\"וּמִצְרַיִם הֶבֶל וָרִיק יַעְזֹרוּ לָכֵן קָרָאתִי לָזֹאת רַהַב הֵם שָׁבֶת\")</sub></p>\n<p><sup>2</sup><sub>As opposed to where the large geographical feature is the indirect object, as in Psalms 89:26, where the meaning is \"placed\" </sub></p>\n<p><sup>3</sup><sub><em>Cf.</em> Isaiah 40:22, \"הַנּוֹטֶה כַדֹּק שָׁמַיִם\"</sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I am not a dikduk expert but by my reading the text in front of us fits well and there's no evidence for changing it.</p>\n<p>First, this verse, Job 26:11, is part of a sequence of verses that describes G-d's power and formation of the Earth, the Heavens, and the Water.</p>\n<p>So 26:7 describes G-d hanging the earth on nothingness:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נֹטֶ֣ה צָפ֣וֹן עַל־תֹּ֑הוּ תֹּ֥לֶה אֶ֝֗רֶץ עַל־בְּלִי־מָֽה -- He stretched the North over chaos, he suspended the the Earth on nothingness</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.26.7-8?lang=bi&lookup=Who%20suspended%20earth%20over%20emptiness.%20%D7%A6%D6%B9%D7%A8%D6%B5%D6%BD%D7%A8%D6%BE%D7%9E%D6%B7%D6%A5%D7%99%D6%B4%D7%9D%20%D7%91%D6%BC%D6%B0%D7%A2%D6%B8%D7%91%D6%B8%D6%91%D7%99%D7%95%20%D7%95%D6%B0%D7%9C%D6%B9%D6%BD%D7%90%D6%BE%D7%A0%D6%B4%D7%91%D6%B0%D7%A7%D6%B7%D6%96%D7%A2%20%D7%A2%D6%B8%D7%A0%D6%B8%D6%A3%D7%9F%20%D7%AA%D6%BC%D6%B7%D7%97%D6%B0%D7%AA%D6%BC%D6%B8%D6%BD%D7%9D%D7%83%20He%20wrapped%20up%20the%20waters%20in%20His%20clouds%3BYet%20no%20cloud%20burst%20under%20their%20weight.&with=Commentary&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">26:8-9</a> then move on to the heavens (both physical and spiritual) describing G-d's creation of clouds and his hiding of the heavenly Throne.</p>\n<p>The four verses 26:10-13, then go back and forth discussing G-d's guidance and power over the seas and the heavens.</p>\n<p>26:10 discusses G-ds control of the seas on Earth through the boundary between water and land and light (above the water surface) and darkness (below the water surface).</p>\n<p>26:11 discusses G-d's power as it relates to the heavens.</p>\n<p>26:12 turns back to the seas this time emphasizing G-d's power over the sea.</p>\n<p>Finally, in 26:13, Job describes G-d's use of the wind to control or create beautiful boundary for the heavens (<em>see</em> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.26.13?lang=bi&p2=Ibn_Ezra_on_Job.26.13.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra ad loc</a>.)

Probably the closest thing to an entirely non-Jewish source is the section in the <em>Chronicle of John Malalas</em> Book 8 which is sometimes called \"8 Maccabees.\" It's pretty short but Malalas was a Christian and doesn't seem to be working from any known Jewish sources.

It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade\" (NIV). The Greek noun used appears in the neuter plural as \"the renewals\" or \"the consecrations\" (Greek: τὰ ἐγκαίνια; ta enkaínia). The same root appears in 2 Esdras 6:16 in the Septuagint to refer specifically to Hanukkah. This Greek word was chosen because the Hebrew word for 'consecration' or 'dedication' is Hanukkah (חנכה). The Aramaic New Testament uses the Aramaic word hawdata (a close synonym), which literally means 'renewal' or 'to make new'.  Source:  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah#Other_ancient_sources\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah#Other_ancient_sources</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Additional information on the Septuagint:</strong></em>  The Septuagint (also known as the LXX) is a translation of the Hebrew Bible into the Greek language. The name Septuagint comes from the Latin word for “seventy.” The tradition is that 70 (or 72) Jewish scholars were the translators behind the Septuagint. The Septuagint was translated in the third and second centuries BC in Alexandria, Egypt. As Israel was under the authority of Greece for several centuries, the Greek language became more and more common. By the second and first centuries BC, most people in Israel spoke Greek as their primary language. That is why the effort was made to translate the Hebrew Bible into Greek—so that those who did not understand Hebrew could have the Scriptures in a language they could understand. The Septuagint represents the first major effort at translating a significant religious text from one language into another.</p>\n\n\n",

However, the seem to always come back to the discussion of how it applies to <em>Halacha</em>. My question is stemming from somewhere else.</p>\n<p>If <em>Midrashim</em> and <em>Rishonim's</em> explanations of the <em>Torah</em> are all from <em>mesorah</em>, how can they argue about practical historical things.</p>\n<p>As an example, In <em>parshas</em> <em>Noach</em>, Chapter 7 verse 2, it says 'Of every pure animal take unto you seven by seven etc.' There is a <em>Machlokes</em> whether that means 7 pairs of animal or just 7 individual animals (see Rashi and Medrash Rabbah).</p>\n<p>They cannot both be <strong>True</strong>. How can this be reconciled?</p>\n<p>Maybe I am approaching this wrongly, but I want to treat the explanations of the Torah as <em>divine</em>. I find it difficult to understand how they can all be <em>divine</em> if they cannot all be <strong>True</strong>.</p>\n<p>EDIT:\nAfter reading a couple of answers and comments, I feel the need to clarify a little.\nI understand that the way to understand the meaning of the Torah was given in the oral part of the Torah (i.e. midrashim). But if that's the case then how can there be contradictions in the explanation of the Torah itself. I'm not referring to arguments among the sages or the like.\nIn the example I give by Noach, how am I supposed to understand the words of the Torah? Both explanations cannot be true, and if you say only one is true, then where did the other one come from? Aren't all the explanations from the oral Torah passed down?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You have a good question, and you're not the only one who ask this, many seforim are talking about that, and all of them have answers to that question.</p>\n<p>However I saw the Meor einayim answers that, that in real world is only one true, but every word of the Gemara and Midrashim has a deeper meaning of how we understand it, and some times their is no difference between them.</p>\n<p>So for us to understand that in every case is impossible, some times it will be possible and some times not.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>On a basic level, Eilu v'elu is not necessarily applied to all machloksim, and even when it is, it's often explained to mean that they were both referring to different things and that they don't actually contradict. I don't have the whereabouts of the cases I'm referring to off-hand, but if you want their location, ask me and I can try to look them up for you. In terms of them all having deeper meanings that don't contradict, I don't have an opinion on that, but I can definitely understand if all that meant was that generally the reasons that the sages say what they say, is based upon very lofty and deep understandings, but obviously in many cases, practically speaking, one of them goes wrong somewhere, and thus only one of them are technically correct.</p>\n<p>I think the most essential thing to be aware of, is that the Gemara is full of a) Sages rebuttals to the opinions of other Sages. b) Retractions by Sages of their own opinions. c) And most basic and common, arguments. As far as I know, an argument is where you hold the other is wrong and you are right. If the Sages believed that I assume you can believe that, but I might be wrong.</p>\n<p>Edit: Maybe the chiddush of the memrah that \"all that any serious Torah Learner is going to be mischadesh was already said by Sinai\" is that it didn't have to be true to be considered Torah to be said at Sinai. Rather, it just had to be coming from a place of holiness.</p>\n<p>Another pshat might be, That it's indeed only referring to the true chiddushim. However, you may think that it was hidden in the Torah and not ever revealed until that Talmid came along... Ka mashma lan that it was already said to Moses on Sinai.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Very simple, they are not all true.

(Likutay Moharan, MM Schneerson and more)</p>\n<p>Back in the ancient days, the way to learn the Torah was to use the intellect with a strong intuition to derive the Halacha, hence torah she-ba'al pe. Now, being that they used their heads instead of scripture, many had different interpretations of the unspoken rules of the world or the Torah. As clarity decreased, people feared for their intellectual clarity and honesty and decided to write things down, and from then on, came the Talmud and debates.</p>\n<p>Now the method the tannaim used to learn is still known today, through the works of kabala. This is how many rabbis came to their great findings (Chidushim). It really has to do with how the mind is formulated and the education and beliefs the rabbi has when he comes to his revelation, creating his \"masterpiece\".</p>\n<p>If you are interested to know how they learned, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@koshertorahschoolofrabbiar9394\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">click on the link,</a></p>\n<p>It's nine (9) classes in total, to teach you how to use your intellect with your intuition.</p>\n\n\n",

If the goal is to cause the other person pain in the same way as you were hurt, that is revenge.  If it is a genuine desire to help them improve themselves and there is genuinely no desire to hurt them back, that's not revenge.  (I'm basing this on Chafetz Chaim - he doesn't say that about revenge specifically, but he did about \"lashon hara le'toeles\", so I'm extrapolating that it applies to this too).</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that there are other factors to consider.  Just because something is not revenge doesn't mean that it would be a good thing to do.  The likely outcome should be considered too.  If it is someone you don't know or don't get on with then reacting in this way is most likely just going to be received badly and not going to encourage them to improve themselves.  If they are your child, a pupil you teach or a close friend, or you have some other type of relationship where it might actually encourage them to change their behaviour and you are acting with the right intent then that's more likely to be a positive thing.

Do we know stories from our times where someone advised one of the communities of Bnei Noach on doing this?

Yehudah ha-Nasi if he can build\na Mizbeah. He replied that he may so sacrifice, however that\nafterwards he should bury the stones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Yehudah Zerahyah Segal (Semah Yehudah, vol 2, p. 146-147) citing the Mishneh la-Melekh (R. Yehudah Rosanes) explained the necessity of burying the stones as having been due to the potential for such an altar to be used for idolatrous worship down the line by others (this would have especially been the case in the Roman context). R. Segal explains that this is also why the Rambam emphasizes/elaborates in H. Ma'aseh ha-Qorbanoth 19:16 that this is permitted where one cultivates the gentile's proper worship of God (ומותר להורות להם וללמדם היאך יקריבו לשם האל ברוך הוא). R. Segal states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא די לו בזה שיסביר להם בקצרה הדינים של ההקרבה בבמה דידהו אלא עליו\nללמדם ולהדריכם לשם ה' ודיניהם וכו' וכו' ולהשתדל למנוע כל תקלה שהיא מכל\nצד שהוא שתתכן לבא מאיזה סיבה וחכם עיניו בראשו לראות בראשית דבר איך\nיפול סוף דבר</p>\n<p>It is insufficient that he simply explain to them succinctly the laws\nconcerning sacrifice upon an altar rather it is incumbent upon him to\nteach them and guide them for the sake of God's name. And that he must\nexert himself to prevent any impediment/mishap that can arise for any\nreason. And the truly wise will apprehend at the outset what\neventualities will come of the end of the matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Contemporaneously, I have never heard of any gentile groups approaching rabbanim for guidance in performing animal sacrifices. Cross-culturally, animal sacrifice were rather common in antiquity. However today, for most people in the western world (which is where the greater portion of self identified \"Noahides\" live) it is outside their frame of reference and is unlikely to therefore be something they'd self initiate or express an interest in. Were a gentile to seek out our assistance in such an endeavor, there would be (or rather should be) a great hesitancy to consider whether it would/could eventually lead to being utilized to draw people away from God rather than towards.</p>\n<p>Given the great danger that a Jew may come to inadvertently engage in qodshim bahus (sacrificial slaughter outside the Temple Courtyard), and the danger for gentiles to eventually utilize such a bamah improperly, I suspect that facilitating such activities would not be a high-ranking priority of those rabbanim involved with Noahide communities. On the contrary, it would be something they'd properly be wary of.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam in the introduction to the Mishna and others list him as in the first generation of Tanoim as a student (not contemporary) of Shimon Hatzadik. Which would mean that <strong>IF</strong> (see below) he is the same Dosa Ben Horkunis who was alive in the times of Rav Akiva after the Beis Hamakdush was destroyed  then he lived for centuries. This answer is not negating that possibility.</p>\n<p>However, the Meiri (introduction to Pirkey Avos) and others argue on the Rambam and say that although he had traditions and knowledge about things said during  the times of Shimon Hatzadik (the fact that he had them  is the Rambam's source   he lived then) he personally still lived much later on.</p>\n<p>The Gemora Gittin 81A says that Beis Shammai was doros harishonim (the earlier generation of tannaim) and R. Dosa ben Hyrkanus was doros hacharonim (later generation of tannaim). Had he been a talmid of Shimon Hatzadik then he would  have even predated Beis Shammai. Which is why I'm suggesting the possibility  that even according to the Rambam and those who list him in the first generation of tannaim there were two different tannaim of that name.</p>\n<p>The strongest proof brought that he lived in the same time as Shimon Hatzadik and then for many subsequent generations is because he said  Rav Elazar ben Azariah looks like his ancestor Shimon Ha-Tzadik. But similar to what the Meiri says it could be he knew what Shimon Ha-Tzadik looked like because he (1)either saw a drawing of Shimon Hatzadik or (2)Shimon Hatzadik had very distinct features  that were shared with Rav Elazar ben Azariah or (3)Shimon Hatzadik had other descendants who looked like him and this was known to be passed on through the generations</p>\n\n\n",

Following the genealogies, the two wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אנו גוזרי' בגזרת נחש שלא יעתיק שום אדם את היחוס הזה הכתוב בשלשלאות כי חיישינן לזיופא נאם דוד הנשיא ידידיה הנשיא והנה המעתיק מכתב ידנו חש לגזרה זו ודלג בכל יחוס שם אחד.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"We decree by rabbinic imprecation that no man shall copy this genealogy that is written in links (of generations) because we fear falsification so says David the Nasi Yedidyah the Nasi and whosoever that copies from our handwriting shall fear this imprecation and (shall?) skip in every genealogy one name.\"</p>\n<p>I was wondering whether anyone was familiar with another source that references such a decree/gezerah against copying someone's genealogy.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Two interesting things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I didn't notice that Rabbi Koronel skipped any of the generations, but I did see that he changed the spelling of some of the names. For example, from נתן דצוציתה he changed to נתן דצוציתא.</li>\n<li>Yedidyah's genealogy looks like a fairly standard Exilarchy genealogy, but David, who claimed descendance from the Nessi'im of the House of Hillel, has many unusual names in his list (such as יהודה דאסיון or דאפיון or (!) יהוד' הקדוש הוא רשב\"ג), and the order of some of the generations looks mixed up.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Let me know if it is not appropriate.\nI started to become religious about 8 years ago. I started giving significantly more charity than I had in the past about 4 years ago. I have a question. I don't know how to handle it. A rabbi, I guess I should say my rabbi, asked me to donate to a project. I wasn't sure it was in my budget but I decided to do it. I didn't give it all at once but within 2~3 months I did (I think). I asked if there could be a memorial placard for someone and they said yes. I visited the schul for a couple of years and always looked to see if this project had been completed but never saw it. Finally I asked about it. I live very far from the schul and cannot attend more than a few times a year so I asked for a picture. They said it wasn't cleaned up yet but it would be. Finally they sent a picture but there was no memorial. I asked about it and they said of course they were going to do it. But I never heard back and I asked a few times after that but it didn't get resolved. I checked and to make a memorial placard would cost virtually nothing (maybe a hundred dollars at the most). I feel unsettled by all this. Does anyone have some way I should think about it? Some perspective on it?</p>\n\n\n",

Naming this version of the Talmud after Palestine or the Land of Israel —rather than Jerusalem—is considered more accurate, as the text originated mainly from Galilee in Byzantine Palaestina Secunda rather than from Jerusalem, where no Jews lived at the time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Jerusalem Talmud predates its counterpart, the Babylonian Talmud (known in Hebrew as the Talmud Bavli), by about 200 years, and is written primarily in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic. Both versions of the Talmud have two parts, the Mishnah (of which there is only one version), which was finalized by Judah ha-Nasi around the year 200 CE, and either the Babylonian or the Jerusalem Gemara. The Gemara is what differentiates the Jerusalem Talmud from its Babylonian counterpart. The Jerusalem Gemara contains the written discussions of generations of rabbis of the Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina at Tiberias and Caesarea, and was compiled into book form in around 350–400 CE....   This Talmud is a synopsis of the analysis of the Mishnah that was developed over the course of nearly 200 years by the Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina (principally those of Tiberias and Caesarea).   Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Further research establishes that prior to the destruction of the temple by the Romans, climatic conditions in Jerusalem may have been wetter and cooler than they are today.  The wet or rainy season is from the middle of October to the middle of April and the dry or summer season lasts from the middle of June until the middle of September.  During December and January snow may fall in the north, near Mount Hermon, but it would be unusual to see snow in Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>Land-use studies throughout the Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Mid-East show the prevalence of crops and forests, which were suited to cooler, wetter climates in the period 3,000 years ago.  Also, large quantities of timber were used in the construction of Solomon’s temple, which again suggests that the climate in Israel was wetter and cooler thousands of years ago.</p>\n<p>Jewish historian Flavius Josephus records climatic conditions and fertile soil suited to the growth of vineyards, figs, olives and fruit. (The Jewish War, Book 3, Chapter 10:8)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Conclusion:</strong></em> While it is possible that shepherds near Jerusalem might have tended to their flocks outdoors during the winter months, it seems more probable that they would bring their sheep indoors during the colder and wetter months of December and January.  However, without any records going back to temple activities 2,000 years ago, the question must remain unanswered.</p>\n\n\n",

Generally, suffering comes about as punishment for one’s transgressions, as it is stated: “We will search and examine our ways, and return to God” (Lamentations 3:40). If he examined his ways and found no transgression for which that suffering is appropriate, he may attribute his suffering to dereliction in the study of Torah. God punishes an individual for dereliction in the study of Torah in order to emphasize the gravity of the issue, as it is stated: “Happy is the man whom You punish, Lord, and teach out of Your law” (Psalms 94:12). This verse teaches us that his suffering will cause him to return to Your law.</p>\n<p>וְאִם תָּלָה וְלֹא מָצָא — בְּיָדוּעַ שֶׁיִּסּוּרִין שֶׁל אַהֲבָה הֵם, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״כִּי אֶת אֲשֶׁר יֶאֱהַב ה׳ יוֹכִיחַ״.\nAnd if he did attribute his suffering to dereliction in the study of Torah, and did not find this to be so, he may be confident that these are afflictions of love, as it is stated: “For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes, as does a father the son in whom he delights” (Proverbs 3:12).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.5a.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.5a.10</a>\nPretty much this gemara implies all sufferings are from sin.

Which they would get rewarded for in the world to come. As rashi there says.\nChildren suffering comes from the sins of the parents. What did the children do wrong, for that I heard you have to say they're a gilgul, that needs a tikun.

[I will not limit it or defend you.] [Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Fasts 1:1-3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The message is: If you accept God, God will be with you; if you think things happen to you by chance, then God will indeed leave them to chance.</p>\n\n\n",

Thanks for bringing this most essential of all questions to our site, where it rightfully deserves to be, and which needs an answer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Don't look at the <em>meaning</em>-question as \"what's the meaning <em>for</em> me\" but \"what's the meaning <em>of</em> me\". The answer is, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.1.26.1-3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">you were created to serve Hashem</a> (and your fellow man), and it <em>is</em> a true, important service that has infinite, vital meaning to Hashem.</p>\n<p>The question of \"why is it important to Him\" shouldn't be necessary (although it is interesting), and can certainly be beyond our understanding (but we finite beings can still deeply appreciate the worthy-of-Hashem's-greatness answers, which are available to anyone truly seeking, read on to get some insight), we just need to know that it <em>is</em> truly, cosmically, infinitely, <em>vitally</em> important. <strong>It is</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.30.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">exceedingly close to you</a>, to love it, when you know it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Please, let's proceed with great care and sensitivity. This matter is very personal (to Hashem, may His name be blessed forever). It seems, we are allowed to talk about it, it's not just reserved for the most sensitive and holy scholars of the generation, but let's not spill anything precious. I also apologise if some people think this is the most obvious thing in the world, I am not trying to patronise anyone. I don't know why, but the modern secular world somehow has this power of making some of the most obvious truths of Torah difficult to see, as happened to myself for many years.</p>\n<p>Let's start by asking, what meaning did Hashem find in creating the world? The most common answer given is that given by the Ramchal Z'tzl, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_One%2C_On_the_Purpose_of_Creation.1?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%9C%D7%96%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%95&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Hashem 1:2:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The purpose of creation was to give from His goodness, may He be blessed, to someone else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This answer, which is perhaps the most grossly misunderstood idea in all of Torah learning, is extremely profound and explains the meaning of life. Firstly, how is it misunderstood? Let's get that out of the way because this misunderstanding can be the primary reason that many people lose touch with the meaning in Torah and mitzvot.</p>\n<p>It is misunderstood by many to mean \"Hashem created the world for me to benefit\". I.e. my purpose in life is to have a good time (and they don't mean hedonism per se, but gain spiritual benefit, the best good God can give etc). Often combined with the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.37a.15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmudic dictum</a> \"Every person should view the world as if it were created for him\", we end up with a message that we are all created for our own benefit and that's the meaning in our life - to maximise that benefit. And the way to do that, supposedly, is to keep the mitzvot and study Torah.</p>\n<p>A lot of people nowadays, in my experience, are coming to the quite correct conclusion this is not meaningful in the slightest. Not just because of old problems, like \"I don't see the benefit in kosher\" or \"I find the idea of a delayed reward in another world too abstract to motivate me\" or \"stop threatening me with heaven and hell\". People nowadays seem to be waking up to the inherent <em>illogic</em> of it - they recognise that they didn't choose to exist, and therefore it <em>can't</em> be about them! Exactly right - \"against your will, you were created\" as the Mishna says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 4:22</a>). Many people nowadays either get turned off completely, or lose all enthusiasm for Torah, mitzvot, and life itself(!) when they are told that they should keep Torah and mitzvot because it is of great benefit to them.</p>\n<p>How infinitely disappointing, as well as gloomy - am I nothing but a selfish creature? Surely there's something more important to life than this.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>How do we really understand the above statement from the Ramchal then? It's that last word \"לזולתו\", \"for someone else\" that is the key. Hashem, may He blessed, found meaning in there being \"someone else\", besides Himself. The meaning in life is this: <strong>There is someone else, and they need you</strong>. Be good to them*. Live for them.</p>\n<p>You are needed, not needy. Your purpose in life, the reason you were created without being asked, is to fill that need. Right after stating this, Ramchal then devotes a lot of ink to explaining that we should attach ourselves to Hashem by being as similar to Him as possible - so no, this is not an asymmetrical picture, where the point is for Him to give and and us to get, that's it, <em>chas veshalom</em>. On the contrary, Hashem is teaching us how a Godly relationship works: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.6.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"I am for my beloved, and My beloved is for Me\"</a>. We focus not on our own needs, our own benefit, but on the needs and benefit of our beloveds, and give them the great gift of letting them dote over <em>our</em> needs!</p>\n<p>Hashem revealed to us His mitzvot, and explained to us that they are His <em>ratzon</em>. They are what He wants, He likes, He considers vital and necessary. By doing mitzvot, <em>we are doing what He wants</em>. There's the meaning in it! This is a true <em>Avodah</em>, a true service, giving Him what He actually needs from us. How much does He want it? Have you seen how important it is to Him in the Torah? About 70% of the Torah is Hashem explaining to us how vitally important it is to Him, and how important <em>we</em> are to Him. Tanya explains the great lengths Hashem went to, in order to have us. He had to do a lot of things that are, dare we say it, beneath His exalted dignity, against His perfect will, and certainly, <em>k'veyachol</em>, of great suffering to Him - such as creating evil and a <em>yeitzer hara</em> and suffering, hiding, constricting...</p>\n<p>If you read between the lines, you'll see the real secret of Torah. What He really needs is us. His זולתו, His beloved. You. That is the <em>purpose</em> of creation, the Divine Plan - to create a \"<em><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/976273/jewish/Chapter-36.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dira b'tachton</a></em>\", an eternal intimacy with someone else, i.e. <em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.1.1.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bishvil Yisrael</a></em>. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.7.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אֲנִ֣י לְדוֹדִ֔י וְעָלַ֖י תְּשׁוּקָתֽוֹ</a></p>\n<p>By keeping Torah and mitzvot, we are emulating Him. Not just in that He keeps Torah and mitzvot (which is important to this point too), but by doing what He wants, we are \"giving to Someone else from our goodness\", and He is getting <em>us</em> as a result. This is the same for all relationships - don't get married to <em>get something</em> from your wife, even something noble and spiritual like a mitzva/children/spiritual growth! Do it <em>because she needs you</em> (and btw, you need her too). Live for your children, be willing to die for them! Make your life about giving your best you to your friends, your coworkers, your family, your community, your people, your whole world. In a quiet moment, look deep within, hear the vow your soul made before it was born, you'll realise that you are here to be a hero of Torah proportions, a <em>tzaddik</em> who doesn't live for himself, but lives for others. This is emulating Hashem.</p>\n<p>Hashem said, in His 10th <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.17.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">statement of creation</a>, \"It is not good for man to be alone\". What did He <em>create</em> with that? He created a nature in humans that we are keenly aware of how \"not good\" it is to be alone. Why did He have to create that? Because it's not logical. Being alone should be \"very good\", right? Nobody to bother you, detract from you, worry about. It's the \"natural\" state. Hashem created us in His image, so the meaning He has in not being alone, He passed on to us.</p>\n<p>This is the real meaning of \"the whole world was created for me\". Yes it was, but not so <em>you</em> could have you, but so He (and your parents, your spouse, your children, your friends...) could have you, in the same way they are for you. In the same way that He is for you! The \"very best good\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_One%2C_On_the_Purpose_of_Creation.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">according to Ramchal</a>, Hashem gives Himself to us. Now we know what that means.</p>\n<p>The task in life, the purpose in life, is for us to rise above ourselves, to the point of <em>mesirat nefesh</em>, for an other. Take that same love and <em>p'nimiut</em> we have naturally for ourselves (which is innocent and holy), and cultivate it for someone else. This sentiment is so much more mature, real, powerful, and above all healthy than living for oneself.</p>\n<p>So, the Sages, may their memory be a blessing, say a <em>tzaddik</em> is alive even when he is dead, and a sinner is dead even when he is alive (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.18b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 18b</a>). If a person doesn't live for someone else, he hasn't tasted true life. A righteous person is someone who has figured it out - looking after one's beloveds is far more compelling and real than looking after oneself. The latter is not life, only leads to neuroticism and stress, and it is no better than being dead (and that's just when it is innocent). The dust we were made from existed for itself and nothing else. We are given a choice to live, to emulate Hashem who created the world to share His good with someone else, so too we should live to share our good; our love, our justice, our compassion, our caring and desire with others, and with Him, the true Eternal One.</p>\n<p>How does one achieve this? Learning lots of Torah. Growing up, getting married, and keeping the mitzvot. All this inculcates us with this orientation and once we have \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.34.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">taste[d], and see[n] that Hashem is good</a>\", we can't go back to the smaller world of ourselves, we live and breathe to serve others, our beloved family, people and God. We stay up late at night, hoping that we can be with them forever, and serve them forever!</p>\n<p>Surely, Hashem's already said YES to that prayer :)</p>\n<p>It is wonderful, and awesome, ennobling and uplifting - remember, it leads to true <em>mesirat nefesh</em>, \"I would gladly give up myself, my head, my heart, my ambition, my eternity for you, and until then, I give it all <em>to</em> you\". If we all search deep within ourselves, we will find of course, that's exactly the type of person we want to be. A Torah-true Hero, someone who <em>makes</em> meaning in life, a true partner of Hashem.</p>\n<p>If one feels they haven't achieved this and doesn't see how, relax. It will happen. Life does it to us whether we like it or not, and it just takes time. Wisdom. Age. Maturity. Fulfilling the mitzvot greatly assists in this! Holding one's newborn baby and promising to never let anything bad happen to her. Seeing the smile on one's friend's face when one helped them through a difficulty. Clocking on to how much one is truly needed by their spouse, nay, by everyone in their life. It can't be ignored forever! It can't leave one cold forever! It eventually penetrates even the toughest of hearts.</p>\n<p>Maybe you are like me and enjoy a good meme. We may see 100 memes that make us laugh, because someone did something stupid, or clever, or funny. Once in a while though, a meme makes us cry. We see a story of how some people got together and helped someone, or how someone risked their life to save someone else, or of a medical procedure that changes someone's life. \"Taste and see, that Hashem is good\". Hashem's perfect way, His mitzvot, are the real goodness in life. Serving oneself is hollow, empty and ultimately destructive, even if there is some passing pleasure in it...</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A few things that must be said at this stage, as I feel the whole point can get deflated if they are not addressed before a \"<em>klutz kashe</em>\" is asked in the comments. If you wish to understand any of the below deeply, I can point you to <em>sefarim</em>, <em>shiurim</em> or you can even ask them as separate questions, to get fuller answers.</p>\n<p>Firstly, how does us keeping the mitzvot further Hashem's Divine Plan to be One with His people?</p>\n<p>It is well outside of the scope of this question, and there are many many layers to it. For example, the idea that we are His partner in \"<em>tikun olam</em>\" - fixing the world. This means we are fixing the human condition (the \"Life\" that Hashem has made which is the \"place\" where this Oneness happens), by doing good, avoiding evil, repairing and elevating darkness, teshuva, studying and developing Torah and getting right to the very bottom detail of all of Hashem's <em>ratzon</em> about good, evil, permitted, forbidden, pure, impure, etc etc. The Kabbalists tell us this affects the entire human condition - if you avoid a single temptation, you make it easier for <em>everyone</em> to avoid that temptation, etc.</p>\n<p>Another example is free will. Hashem, may He be blessed, wants <em>us</em>, so therefore He must let us <em>be us</em>, let us be truly a \"someone else\", so we can love and desire Him (and each other!) ourselves, and not by force. He gives us a path to Him, and every other path too, so we are free to reject <em>all of it</em> and worship** only Him.</p>\n<p>There is so much more, and ultimately if we do get down to the bottom of it, to the place of advanced theological philosophy, we have to accept it on faith. I don't completely understand <em>why</em> He wanted it this way in every detail and how exactly it all works, but He tells us it is so,and invites us to try to understand by studying Torah, and we trust His promises <em>b'emuna shelema</em>.</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>Secondly, how can Hashem want? Surely He doesn't need anything right? There's nothing besides Him. Everything in creation is utterly nullified to Him. Doesn't the Rambam and many others stress over and over He needs nothing? Doesn't it say \"if you are a <em>tzaddik</em>, what do you give Him?\". Isn't it absurd, or even blasphemous to think a finite, created being, can give anything to His infinite eternal creator? This is also well outside the scope of this answer, and I ask the commentors to refrain from jumping in with <em>kashes</em> as I won't be able to do them justice here. All I can say is the following.</p>\n<p>Of <em>course</em> Hashem doesn't need anything. He has (nay, <strong>is</strong>), definitionally, <em>everything</em>. However, we are not talking about a thing. We are talking about you. He needs <em>you</em>. There is a world of <em>things</em>, but then there is a mysterious, holy world of... <em>someones</em>. Our finite world enables us to confuse the two (may Hashem have mercy on us), even in language - we use the same words for both and the danger is we will think they mean the same thing in these two different contexts. This is why I called for maturity above. It takes maturity, deep life lessons, experience with real relationships and intimacy, to get past this point. We are shrouded in darkness, but darkness doesn't mean the room is empty, it just means we can't see what <em>is</em> there. Hashem <em>is</em> there, He is real, a real Someone. Light Chanuka candles and contemplate all your relationships - what am I not seeing in the people I love? How can I bring light to the relationship and give them what they need?</p>\n<p>When we say \"need\" in the world of things, lack is implied. I need a thing because I lack that thing, or something that that thing can accomplish for me. Applying this need to Hashem is pure heresy. When we say \"I need <em>you</em>\", however, we mean something entirely different. I, in and of myself, may be lacking absolutely nothing, and yet I can still need my child (I <em>would</em> be lacking if I didn't need my child - need for others is a form of perfection, not deficiency). I can need him to be in my life, to be good, to be safe, to be mine. It goes above and beyond all things, including spiritual things like emotion and intellect. It is the place of true meaning, the need we have for eachother. It's truly Divine. Hashem calls Yisrael \"<em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.5.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">yonati tamati</a></em>\", \"My perfect dove\". <em>Tamati</em> also means complete, He is romantically saying that we, <em>k'veyachol</em>, complete Him, give meaning to His life, may He be blessed.</p>\n<p>It's still hard to understand with Hashem, I admit. We \"have\" desires. Ideas \"occur\" to us. Hashem, on the other hand, doesn't have anything \"happen\" to Him. He is the primordial source and cause of everything. He doesn't \"have\" an idea, He \"makes\" an idea, if that even makes sense in finite, temporal language! He doesn't \"have\" a desire, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_One%2C_On_the_Creator.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">He and His desire are One</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However the Master, may His name be blessed, does not have different capabilities, even though He actually has properties that are differing within us. For surely He is willful and is wise and is powerful and He is perfect in every perfection; however the truth of His existence is one matter that includes within His truth and domain (meaning the truth of His being, as having a domain is not applicable to Him, may He be blessed - rather it is only by way of literary license) everything that is a perfection (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_One%2C_On_the_Creator.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Hashem 1:1:5</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He is thoroughly Himself (something we can hardly grasp in finite terms, although He invites us to grow to be like Him in this way too), whatever He wants doesn't come from the object of the desire, but <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.1.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">from the Desirer Himself</a>. What He needs is something we can't ask any further \"whys\" about, as it is the why of all whys which we must ultimately take it on <em>emuna</em>.</p>\n<p>(This is a good lesson for every marriage! If your wife says she needs something, and you can't possibly see why, you don't demand she explain it to you or you won't do it. Often, she can't even explain it to you, that's just the way she is! All you need to know is - does she mean it? Does she really need this? If so, no question, you do it. Basic <em>derech eretz</em>, basic decency in any healthy relationship.)</p>\n<p>Does Him, therefore, \"choosing\" to desire us make it more whimsical then? Back to square one? On the contrary. As just stated, what does He base this choice on? Himself, a truly \"free\" choice, free from all external influence. This is what the kabbalists mean when they say performance of mitzvot are \"<em>nogeah be'atzmus</em>\". They are essential to His essential self, i.e. to Him, Himself. The choices Hashem makes are real, eternal - no change took place anywhere - and of absolute vitality and importance - they are Him and He always was and always will be. They make things that are \"destined\", like our in-built, <em>un</em>chosen needs, look whimsical! So as always when it comes to Hashem, things turn out infinitely more impressive and outstanding than our finite human conception of it is, never <em>less</em>.</p>\n<p>The holy Zohar states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ישראל ואורייתא וקודשא בריך הוא חד הוא</p>\n<p>Yisrael, Torah and Hashem are One</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hashem is all about Oneness. The true, original romantic, Hashem is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.41?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">giving us Himself</a>, and wants us to do the same for Him, for each other and then we will truly understand the real meaning of life, and really taste true goodness. <em>Bimhera beyamenu</em>!</p>\n<p>p.s. the statement \"if you are a <em>tzaddik</em>, what do you give Him\" is taken to mean, <em>He doesn't need you to be a <em>tzaddik</em>, He just needs YOU</em>. A finite being can certainly give to a <strong>truly</strong> infinite God, to Whom nothing is too big, <em>or too small</em>. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">How much it means to Him <em>is</em> the reward in Olam Haba</a> (which is the only thing we will care about, given how we have sworn ourselves to Him b'mesirat nefesh at Sinai - see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWdkCVrMEbc&list=LL\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this sicha</a>).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So learn Torah as much as you can. He needs you to know Him deeply, everything about Him, and Torah is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.105a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Him revealing Himself</a>. Do mitzvot, Hashem, and everyone needs you to be a mensch, be His representative, His light, His kind of guy, doing what He wants, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">for Him and not yourself</a>. He needs you to be good to those He gave to you, gave you to, for them, not you. Know that by doing so, you are bringing about the realisation of His eternal plan that is dependant on you, it's not a game or miraculous or illusion or whimsical in any way, it is <strong>real</strong>, even if you can't understand it in full yourself.</p>\n<p>You are on a Divine mission of infinite importance and meaning, every thought you have, every word you speak, every action you perform is literally and absolutely of utmost importance to Him, and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.28.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">He is standing over you</a>, with infinite Divine attention. You don't need to know why, you cannot grasp infinite importance, so you just need to know that <em>it's true</em> - it really is vital and necessary to Him, to your fellow Jews.</p>\n<p>Still, I hope this answer has provided a little bit of the \"why\", which is more necessary than ever before because we are living in a world where the exact opposite is taught to us from every direction...</p>\n<p>Hatzlacha precious Yid, the whole world vitally needs you. He needs you. It's not a <em>buba maase</em>, it's true. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1028864/jewish/Title-Page.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">You can do it</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you would like to learn more on this, as we have barely scratched the surface, please ask in the comments and depending on what your preferences are, I'm sure I can help find the right <em>shiur</em>, <em>sefer</em> or Rav for you. Either way, in all cases, I'd recommend <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@manisfriedman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Manis Friedman</a>, who has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@11213org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thousands</a> of lectures on Youtube and covers all this very extensively.</p>\n<p>* a nice definition of Godly \"good\" I once heard is when you make someone else more important to you than you are to yourself; their needs, wants, goals and side more important than yours.</p>\n<p>**  a nice definition of \"worship\" I once heard is when you think someone is absolutely perfect in every way</p>\n\n\n",

NEVERTHELES you must not and can not just jump into this different method as you lack experience, and credibility in heaven to be granted such leniency. Again to be tricked by those that will come and argue by saying that the statement still stand, there's not a place where he's not... As that is true though, that does not mean we can do as we wish, as there are boundaries that we cannot surpass unless we have created that authentic connection with heaven and g-d.

So it's an intense, internal personal journey, that you should go through in my opinion, either way, you must be truthful with yourself and dress to beautify or enhance the name(presence that you will be in). Incase I need to state the obvious, the undergarments must be clean at all times, if your are going to sweat a lot, it would be best to withhold on the meditation (image) until when you are clean and if you would like to go through the day as such, you should hold it until you can find a way to resolve the excessive sweating throughout the day.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps to answer your question, and not redirected you or left you unsatisfied.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>Have a good day!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is forbidden.  I am not sure there is a difference between \"accepting\" the teaching that God has no body or form (one of the Rambam's 13 principles of faith) and fleetingly \"imagining\" God looking like this or that.

    "content": "# Chovos HaLevavos on honoring parents\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I read in <em>Shaar HaBechinah</em> from the <em>Chovos HaLevavos</em> that people wouldn’t honor their parents if not for shame.</p>\n<p>Why do people need shame to honor their parents? And just in general, does anyone have anything to add to this idea?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Firstly, to clarify a bit, the <em>Chovos HaL'vavos</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Duties_of_the_Heart%2C_Second_Treatise_on_Examination.5.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sha'ar HaB'china</em></a>) doesn't exactly say that nobody would honor their fathers, just that many people wouldn't (\"כי רוב מבני אדם לא היו מכבדים את אבותם לולא הבושת כל שכן זולתם\").</p>\n<p>Secondly, the <em>Chovos HaL'vavos</em> isn't singling out honoring parents. This was stated in the context of many other good things a person could be motivated to do, or bad things a person could be motivated to avoid, due to embarrassment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואח״‎כ חשוב במדת הבושת אשר יחד בה האדם מה גדלה מעלתה ורבה תועלתה ותקנתה ולולא היא לא היו מאכסנים אכסנאי ולא מקיימים דבר ולא ממלאים משאל ולא גומלים חסד ומתרחקים מן הרע בשום דבר עד כי דברים רבים מדברי התורה עושים בעבור הבושת כי רוב מבני אדם לא היו מכבדים את אבותם לולא הבושת כ״‎ש זולתם ולא היו משיבין אבדה ולא נמנעין מעבירה כי כל אשר יעשה מכל אלה הדברים המגונים שזכרנו אינו עושה אותם אלא לאחר שיפשוט כסות הבושת מעליו כמ״‎ש הכתוב (ירמיה ו) גם בוש לא יבושו גם הכלים לא ידעו ואומר (צפניה ג׳:ה׳) ולא יודע עול בשת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sefaria translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Afterwards, reflect on the feeling of shame with which man alone has been endowed. How high is its value! How numerous are its uses and advantages. Were it not for this feeling, men would not show hospitality to strangers. They would not keep their promises, grant favors, show kindness, nor abstain from evil in any way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many precepts of the Torah are fulfilled only out of shame. A large number of people would not honor their parent if it were not for shame, and certainly would fail to show courtesy to others. They would not restore a lost article to its owner, nor refrain from any transgression. For whoever commits any of the disgraceful acts which we have mentioned, does so only when he has cast off the garment of shame. As Scripture said: \"Yea they are not at all ashamed, neither know they how to blush\" (Yirmiyahu 6:15), and \"The sinner knows no shame\" (Tzefania 3:5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thirdly, the <em>Chovos HaL'vavos</em> seems to specify honoring fathers, and perhaps this specificity is intentional. This calls to mind the teaching of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi about the greater tendency to honor one's mother than the tendency to honor one's father (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=30b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Kiddushin</em> 30b-31a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא רבי אומר גלוי וידוע לפני מי שאמר והיה העולם שבן מכבד את אמו יותר מאביו מפני שמשדלתו בדברים לפיכך הקדים הקב\"ה כיבוד אב לכיבוד אם וגלוי וידוע לפני מי שאמר והיה העולם שהבן מתיירא מאביו יותר מאמו מפני שמלמדו תורה לפיכך הקדים הקב\"ה מורא האם למורא האב</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.30b.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria translation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: It is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that a son honors his mother more than he honors his father, because she persuades him with many statements of encouragement and does not treat him harshly. Therefore, in the mitzva of: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:11), the Holy One, Blessed be He, preceded the mention of the honor due one’s father before mentioning the honor due one’s mother. The verse emphasizes the duty that does not come naturally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, it is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that a son reveres his father more than his mother, because his father teaches him Torah. Therefore, in the verse: “A man shall fear his mother and his father” (Leviticus 19:3), the Holy One, Blessed be He, preceded the mention of reverence of the mother before the mention of reverence of the father. The verse emphasizes the duty that does not come naturally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hence, the motivation of avoiding embarrassment might play a greater role in a person's honor of his father, as opposed to a person's more natural inclination to bestow honor on his mother.</p>\n<p>Finally, the following insight comes from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig_Pliskin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Zelig Pliskin</a>'s <em>Growth Through Torah</em> (p. 190):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bashfulness is a trait that many people today view as a fault and a problem to overcome. But as the <em>Chovos Halvovos</em> states in <em>Shaar Habechinah</em>: without bashfulness people would not do acts of kindness. At first glance, this might appear to be an extremely cynical statement. But I recall very clearly hearing this section from the late Rosh Hayeshiva of Telz, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Mordechai_Katz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Chayim Mordechai Katz</a>, in a weekly <em>mussar</em> group he gave in his home. He added, \"Someone recently asked me to do him a favor which I said I would do. But I didn't get to do it and he called me up last week to ask again. This time I took care of the matter right away. Why? Because I truly felt an obligation to do <em>chesed</em>? No. The real reason I did it right away was because I knew he would call me again, and I would feel embarrassed if I were to say that I didn't do it yet.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I remember my thoughts at the time. Here was our elderly Rosh Hayeshiva who was a great <em>baal chesed</em>, a lover of doing kindness, and he had the self-awareness to distinguish between what he did as a pure act of kindness and what he did out of embarrassment. He could have easily told the other person that he was so busy he would be unable to do the favor for him, but the sense of embarrassment motivated him to find the time in his busy schedule. I was also extremely impressed at this openness to us, his young students. Frequently, people feel that by admitting a normal human emotion they will be looked down upon by others. I can personally testify how this added to our already profound respect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Josephus doesn't explicitly say that Azarayah was the son of the previous Kohen Gadol, Achima'atz ben Tzadok, so it seems that during the time of Azaryah the kehunah gedolah was taken from the lineage of Tzadok and passed on to a different lineage for reasons unknown.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>In any case, basically nothing is known about most of these kohanim.<sup>2</sup> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zevachim.101b.13?lang=bi&p2=Chidushei_Agadot_on_Zevachim.101b.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chiddushei Aggadot on Zevachim 101b</a> states that he found a commentary by the Ra\"sh that says that all of the kohanim gedolim were descendants of Pinchas.

(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Ancient Era</a> ended c. 500 CE, the medival period stretches from then until c. 1500 CE, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_era\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Modern Era</a> begins c. 1500 CE).</p>\n<p>Lastly, I'm going to add this position to the pool:</p>\n<p>#6: G-d gave the Oral Torah that’s presented by Orthodox Judaism, and it cannot be changed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>But to simply answer the question:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sadducces:</strong> #2, but per the Rambam, they could be #5 or #6 in secret.</p>\n<p>(The Rambam says that the Saddokim made up their position and arguments in order to avoid keeping the Torah because they didn't think they would receive reward, see below.)</p>\n<p><strong>Karaites:</strong> #2</p>\n<p><strong>Samaritans:</strong> #2</p>\n<p><strong>Beta-Israel:</strong> Most likely, and in accordance with their traditions, #6, with the caveat that they did not have access to the Rabbinic teachings due to persecution and diaspora and were not in line with Orthodoxy until the late modern era.</p>\n<p><strong>Conservative Judaism:</strong> #6 or #5 originally,  leaning more towards #5 or #4 nowadays.</p>\n<p><strong>Reform Judaism:</strong> #2</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Saddokim/Sadducces</h3>\n<p>It's important to remember the Saddokim existed before the codification of the Mishnah, that being said, they did reject many of the teachings of the Perushim (Pharisees), who are the progenitors of \"Orothodox Judaism.\" There were certain positions where the Saddokim were more strict than the Perushim, and some where they were less strict. A very important difference was a disagreement on the laws of Niddah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Niddah.4.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">M.

According to one of Beta-Israel's explanations, this was because they were forbidden from keeping the mitzvot for some period of time (presumably by their non-Jewish neighbors) and forgot many of the laws (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/From_Sinai_to_Ethiopia%2C_Shulhan_haOrit%3B_The_Halakhah_of_Ethiopian_Jewry%2C_Then_and_Now%2C_1_Daily_Practices.4.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ibid</a>). This explanation would lead us to believe they had the Oral Torah (and held by it), but forgot it due to persecution.</p>\n<p>Conversely, one could say they were unaware of this mitzvah because they were not descended from traditional Rabbinic Judaism (like the karaites who interpret the verse homiletically, or a group that had no knowledge of the idea altogether).</p>\n<p>This book goes through Beta-Israel's practices in more detail: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/From_Sinai_to_Ethiopia%2C_Foreword_by_Rabbi_Dr_Daniel_Sperber.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">From Sinai to Ethiopia</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>While it appears as though they didn't follow oral tradition from Sinai (or at least they did not follow very much of it), it is likely that this was due to ignorance rather than rejection (see the fact that they offered sacrifices until a foreigner pointed out to them that this was incorrect (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/From_Sinai_to_Ethiopia%2C_Shulhan_haOrit%3B_The_Halakhah_of_Ethiopian_Jewry%2C_Then_and_Now%2C_1_Daily_Practices.6.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ibid, Daily Pract. 6.</a>)).</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Conservative Judaism</h3>\n<p>From The Jewish Encyclopedia 1906 on Zecharias Frankel, The man commonly considered to be the progenitor of Conservatism, <em>\"[Zecharias Frankel] held firmly the belief that reason based on scholarship and not mere desire on the part of the laity must be the justification for Reform. In this sense Frankel declared himself when the president of the Teplitz congregation expressed the hope that the new rabbi would introduce reforms and do away with the [abuses]. He stated that he knew of no abuses; and that if there were any it was not at all the business of the laity to interfere in such matters [...]. Still he introduced some slight modifications in the worship, as the [removal] of the piyyuṭim, the introduction of a choir of boys, and the like. He was, however, strenuously opposed to any innovation which was objectionable to Jewish sentiment.

A great impression was produced [when] he announced his secession from the rabbinical conference then in session in that city [...], and stated that he could not cooperate with a body of rabbis who had passed a resolution declaring the Hebrew language unnecessary for public worship\"</em> (<a href=\"https://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6301-frankel-zecharias#anchor1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ibid</a>).</p>\n<p>Since its founding Conservatism has crept further towards Reformism, and has also fragmented. While Frankel was purely interested in critical analysis and reforms based on scholarship, modern conservatism seems to be more interested in reforms based on social justice, modern philosophy, and the like.</p>\n<p>The current position of the (Conservative) Rabbinical Assembly states:\n<em>The mitzvot evolved through a long process of interpretation and debate into the body of law known as halakhah.\nBased on the dual pillars of written Torah (the Bible) and\nOral Torah (which includes the Talmud, Codes, Teshuvot—\nlegal rulings of later rabbis), halakhah allows us to seek\nGod’s will and apply that will in each generation. Because\nthe halakhah remains the basis for all authentic Jewish\npractice, Conservative Judaism recognizes that no living\nbody of law can be frozen or fossilized, and holds dear\nthe notion that the Torah is meant to serve us as a road\n“towards” the knowledge of God, not as a barrier keeping\nus back.

    "title": "Why does a Tanya level Tzadik get rewarded?",
    "content": "# Why does a Tanya level Tzadik get rewarded?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One description of a Tanya Tzadik says (from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/87215/13680\">this answer</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This provides us with new parameters for understanding who is a Tzadik. In a Tzadik, the battle between the two souls is over and the winner is the Godly soul. It subdued the animal soul, took it prisoner and gave it a completely new identity. Not only has it stopped opposing the Godly soul, it actually changed sides. As a result the Tzadik never sins, does only good deeds and mitzvot and has absolutely no desire or interest in anything outside the realm of holiness, mitzvot, and goodness - not in his actions, words, or even a single thought.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But if so, why does a Tanya level Tzadik get rewarded? If he has absolutely no desire to sin and only desires to do mitzvot, it should then take him near zero effort to be Torah observant at the highest levels (in fact, it would bring him pleasure). But isn't reward and punishment in Judaism based on the level of effort?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In this answer, I want to try to walk back the normative ideas we have about reward and punishment. Using Tanya as our source, we see that Tanya has come along to actually inform us that this system of reward and punishment is not the whole story. Just like everything in Torah, as we get older, we gradually but surely get deeper and closer to the more mature truth behind the sugya, and this is no different. The Lubavitcher Rebbe said that learning Chassidus is like being born again - even the impressions you got when you were a baby need to be \"rewritten\". Let's see if we can do this here.</p>\n<p>The common conception of reward and punishment is that Hashem, being perfect and in need of nothing, decided in His goodness, to do us a favour and give us a chance to earn some reward (see Derech Hashem part 1). To establish this, He created good and evil, gave us a yeiter towards each, and rewards us whenever we overcome our yeitzer hara, and whenever we utilise our yeitzer hatov, and we get punished whenever we do the opposite, chas veshalom.</p>\n<p>This idea is the very basic, immature version of a much deeper idea. If we neglect to graduate beyond it, we run the risk of losing people. In fact, many Jews who go off the derech, or who refuse to get on the derech in the first place, cite this idea as their main turn off. So basically stated, it sounds horrific to many people. We are created against our will, kicked out of paradise down to a rough world, and told to return by earning reward, and if we don't, we will be punished. During that time we have to encounter terrible suffering, and the odds are stacked against us. Hashem didn't even need to do this, so it seems all this is arbitrary, including all the terrible suffering. We need to go deeper!</p>\n<p>So Tanya let's out the secret. The real, deeper reason that Hashem created the world is in order to establish a \"dira betachton\". Our goal is not to get back to heaven! Our goal is to bring Hashem down here, and make this world a comfortable, Godly place for Hashem (and each other and our own Godly neshamas). In fact, it goes even deeper than that. Hashem isn't into \"places\", He's not looking for a good mountain-top villa made out of beautiful sandstone with blue wave patterns. Hashem wants to dwell with <em>us</em>. A dira is a home, and a home is not a home unless you share it with your beloved, and Hashem's beloved is Yisrael. Bishvil Yisrael nivra olam (second Rashi on Bereshit).</p>\n<p>So it's not about reward and punishment. It's not all <em>about us</em>. At least, not in that sense! It's all about us <em>to Him</em>, but from our point of view, it's all about <em>Him</em> (and each other). The worst thing that ever happened to Judaism was when we somehow absorbed this idea that everything is just a game to get into heaven and avoid hell, to gain reward and avoid punishment.</p>\n<p>So the Tanya fills in more information to complete the picture. Firstly, Hashem gave us a very specific job to make this world comfortable for Him and our neshamas, and that is fixing the etz hada'at. Of course, He could have done that Himself, but He has confidence in us that we can do it and therefore really become His partners. Fixing the etz hada'at means we have to take every last detail of life and the human condition, and find a way to make it holy and have a proper place in a holy life.</p>\n<p>Hashem's Tzibur is made up of Tzaddikim, Benonim and Rashaim (TziBuR). The Benonim and the Rashaim are the general population and the way they perform this mission is by having a yeitzer hara that makes evil pleasurable and appealing, and their job is to overcome this, either through avoidance and middot improvement, or teshuva (or both). Due to the lowly state a neshama has to be in for this to even be possible, these two groups are not capable of achieving very great heights of holiness and tzidkut, which takes tremendous sensitivity and distance from sin. As a result Hashem also created some special individuals who do not have a yeitzer hara and are not part of this. Their job is to be the shepherds of the rest of the tzibur. They spend their time learning, teaching, leading, and ensuring that the work the beinonim and rashaim is completed. Through prayer and tikkunim that they only know, they actually affect the elevations that the beinonim and rashaim begin when they do their work, and bring down the Godliness into the world in the place prepared for it by the beinonim and rashaim. They invite Hashem down into His world.</p>\n<p>So the picture we have of reward and punishment is out the window now. This is not a game. This is Hashem's genuine attempt at making a real life of yichud with Yisrael, and He has put that in our hands. The real \"reward and punishment\" of this system is not <em>necessarily</em> about good and evil. That's just a special case, whereby some people are deliberately given a real connection to evil so that they can go and affect a tikkun, and work on it.</p>\n<p><strong>So the Tanya has listed out 3 different jobs we've been given, two of which involve connection to evil, one not. The schar, the <em>wage</em>, is in proportion to the effort put it. For beinonim and rashaim, the effort comes from overcoming evil, but for the tzaddikim, they have to put in effort in other ways. Both of these are equally precious to Hashem.</strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps the best way to illustrate this is by looking at human relationships. Starting with a father and his children, it's very clear that if one of the children really enjoys doing his father's will, the father gains tremendous pleasure from this child. The children who have to struggle gain a particular endearment to the father, as they struggle, even if this struggle means their accomplishments are much more meagre, objectively speaking.</p>\n<p>As you wrote in your comment below, this good child gains pleasure from performing the will of the father, but I disagree that that means it is not an effort. The good child shows his devotion to his father by really dedicating himself to his father's will, and working very hard. The father would never say \"this amazing house you built for me over 20 years of blood sweat and tears is meaningless to me because you enjoyed building it\"! In fact, I'd go further and say that the fact that the son enjoyed doing it for his father adds to the fathers pleasure. <strong>Judaism does not say that pleasure is somehow a detraction from altruism!!</strong> A very important point! Altruism is the measure of <em>where do you get your pleasure from</em>, is it from your own desires, or from fulfilling the desires of others? The latter is not natural and is remarkable if it is achieved by anyone. The latter is the very definition of a Godly relationship of \"I am for my beloved and my beloved is for me\", which can be summarised as both parties in the relationship saying \"I get no pleasure from serving myself, only from serving you\". The converse is also true, \"I get no pleasure from serving myself, but it does please me when you do things for me, because it's you\". We all know that when we cook ourselves a meal, it's no where near as delicious as when a special someone else cooks us a meal, even if it's actually identical.</p>\n<p><strong>So to summarise. The Tanya completes a picture for us that makes the question fall away. Creation and life is not an arbitrary \"game\" for us to earn reward and avoid punishment. We are all going to Olam Haba, it's not about that. Life is a chance to build a close relationship with Hashem and each-other, and <em>create a life</em> for us, and create a home for us. The reward is the closeness, the goodness of a Godly relationship and home. Even deeper: the reward <em>is</em> each other, the reward <em>is</em> Hashem, may He be blessed! The punishment is the shame and sadness that comes from pushing this plan backwards instead of forwards. The reward is the pleasure we gain from serving others and seeing how it really does make a genuine difference to them (Avot 1:3), the punishment is seeing how we failed others, how we hurt them or worse... Hashem included. This goes beyond simplistic good and evil, and tzaddikim are key players in realising this plan. It is also notable that <em>this is our only chance to achieve this</em>. In Olam Haba it won't be possible...</strong></p>\n<p>As Ramchal says in Chapter 13 of Mesilat Yisharim, a chassid is someone who is motivated to serve out of love. They are not simply hoping to tick the boxes of yes-good, no-bad, but they sincerely wish to anticipate the desires of their master, and please them.</p>\n<p>As the Lubavitcher Rebbe put it, when we accepted Torah, we did so b'mesirat nefesh. Included in that is our pleasure. So rewarding us by giving us pleasure in Olam Haba isn't going to work! The only thing that will work is schar mitzva mitzva: seeing how much it meant to Hashem is going to be the only reward we will accept, and the reward is great....</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's a very good question! Indeed, as I first began typing in one answer, I slowly started realizing more and more that it's actually a much better question than I initially thought.\nHowever, I have two possible answers for you.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Maybe, once one reaches that point, he has already earned the highest level of reward available! However, there is no reason to be bothered that \"If so, why he is still alive and required to continue to fulfill God's commandments if he already achieved perfection and completed his mission?\". That is not a difficulty because a) He enjoys doing God's will so why not let him continue?... And b) God may still want him alive as a tool to use for carrying out various tasks in the world. In truth, I would take this answer further and flip it on you to ask the opposite of what you asked. \"If one has completely triumphed over his evil inclination to the point where evil holds absolutely no power over him whatsoever, then he should already have earned the ultimate level of reward! It shouldn't be possible to offer him more reward because he already earned everything to the highest max! Therefore, what would be the point of continued fulfillment of God's commandments? It's not getting him anything more than he already has so it's superfluous!\". I believe this is the opposite of your question of \"Why should he continue to receive reward if nothing is a challenge for him anymore and therefore nothing is earned?\".</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Maybe what you quote is only referring to the evil inclination's active desire for things other than holiness. However, there is another roadblock to Perfection besides for the Evil Inclination, this roadblock is what I will call \"Dis-ire\" (Similar to \"Dislike). Not dEsire (positive will for something), but dIsire (the complete opposite of active will/the desire to not experience something negative, i.e., pain.) What I am proposing is that the fact that a person \"Disire's\" pain, even in a case where withstanding that pain is necessary to fulfill a Mitzvah, does not stem from the Evil Inclination. It DOES stem from evil to actively desire bad pleasures, but one's disire to withstand pain even when it's necessary for the sake of the Greater Good, is not a challenge between good and evil, but rather between what I would call \"the choice to rise above oneself for the sake of the Greater Good vs Failing to rise above oneself (In this scenario the \"self\" is also holy, just not as holy as what is termed \"the Greater Good\". That is why the correct thing to do is to sacrifice oneself for the sake of God's Will. That's the perfect word actually! \"SACRIFICE\"! In short, I would summarize with two sorts of free will in regard to God's will. 1) The fight between Good and Evil. This is a fight that a person can win at, and completely eradicate his enemy/evil. 2) The fight between oneself and sacrificing of oneself. Neither of these can be considered evil options. According to this theory, even when one conquers their evil inclination, they still are susceptible to failing to fulfill God's word in cases where it is painful for them to do so. This is because even though they no longer desire evil, they still don't want pain or hardship! Therefore, there can often be situations in which even the most Righteous Man is required to choose to overcome some level of hardship or pain in order to fulfill God's will.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

We constantly find things that are hard to find. It's a question of probabilities. One could argue that the only miracle is really the one of the 26th of Kislev (the oil could not last, but it did) - as there all kinds of unlikely military victories in history and all manner of hard to find things were indeed found?!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Good question! I propose as follows:\nFirstly, you agree that the oil having burned 8 days vs 1 was a definitely a miracle, right? Second, \"What is the purpose of a miracle in the first place?\" I ask. Well, quite obviously, the most basic purpose of a miracle is to show us that God is currently watching us, cares about us, and has control over everything that is happening. Okay, now here goes the answer.\nOnce God clearly indicated the three aspects of his providence listed above, through the performance of the <strong>obvious</strong> miracle of the burning of the oil, that naturally directed the Nation of Yisrael to look back at the recent events and see things in a new \"light\"! A \"Light of Miracles\" to be precise. They now naturally saw how the \"Victory of War\" wasn't just a \"Lucky Victory\" and they further realized that the \"Finding of the pure, sealed flask of oil\" wasn't just a \"Lucky Find\"! In truth, I assume that this is the effect that miracles are supposed to have on us. Obvious Miracles are supposed to lead us to see God's intervention even in those things that we might have taken for chance! I hope you like this answer.</p>\n<p>Edit: I just want to add that this might be the reason why we light the Menorah backwards (4,3,2,1) The Neis is about looking \"backwards\" into the past to see God's miracles.</p>\n\n\n",

The short answer is that we don't really know why this is the case, although a couple of attempts to explain this have been made over the years.</p>\n<p>Long answer: The Septuagint as we have it today is a composite work: It was made by a number of Church Fathers who took several manuscripts of septuagints - i.e., Greek translations of Tanach named after the original, long-lost Septuagint - and merged them together. This was done because by their time (circa the 4th-5th centuries and onwards) there were too many Greek translations running around, some with problematic translations (in the eyes of the Church). So a number of prime manuscripts were chosen and used to create a new, eclectic septuagint, which is how we have the Septuagint today. This Septuagint is, therefore, primarily Christian in origin and character, but at least in one case, it preserves a Jewish translation tradition (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/121952/20472\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.internationalstandardbible.com/H/hare.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more info). You can read a bit about the development of the Septuagint as it is today in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Septuagint\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Britannica's entry</a> on the Septuagint (which I find to be shorter and simpler than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia's entry</a>).</p>\n<p>Now, there are a number of differences between the modern Septuagint and the Jewish Tanach, one being this missing verse. Emanuel Tov, who is probably the world's top (academic) scholar of the development of the biblical text and the various variants that have evolved from it (Samaritan, Christian, Qumran, etc) discussed this in the past, and has made that discussion <a href=\"http://www.emanueltov.info/docs/papers/28.prov.1999.pdf?v=1.0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">available online</a>. His conclusion, as is nowadays pretty much a common consensus in the academic world, is that the septuagint manuscripts were based on a version of the Hebrew text that simply did not have this verse in the first place (a \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorlage\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vorlage</a>\"). But as there are several other missing verses, it is difficult to argue logically that this original text was copied by a scribe that mistakenly omitted that verse. He argues that even after the final editing of Proverbs, older versions were still running around and being used by people, and naturally were also used to make more copies. And one of those pre-final versions eventually became the base manuscript for what is now the Septuagint's Proverbs.</p>\n<p>All of this of course means that it is entirely possible that some of the older Greek Proverbs manuscripts did have this verse (as well as the other missing ones), but the particular manuscripts that reached the hands of the Church Fathers and were incorporated into the eclectic version simply did not.</p>\n<p>I myself am not sure about his theory about pre-edited versions of Proverbs running around as late as the 2nd century BCE (the time thought that Proverbs was translated into Greek), but he does have a point in that the significant differences between Septuagint Proverbs and Masoretic Proverbs make it difficult to claim that this is merely scribal error.</p>\n<p>Aharon Kaminka in his essay on the subject in the Hebrew journal Sinai, vol. 8 (1941), pp. 284-285 suggested that some of the changes may be put down to the translator's inability to properly translate certain verses into Greek. It's possible that this was the reason for the disappearance of this verse. This would tie in with the low quality of Greek translations that the Church Fathers saw running around.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Bear in mind that Kaminka wrote this essay a number of years before the first trove of Dead Sea Scrolls was discovered, and never mind later troves. In the DSS there have been found some Hebrew Tanachic manuscripts that bear some similarity to the Greek septuagints. Chapter 22 of Proverbs has not been found (see <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/26034849/The_Proverbs_Tradition_in_the_Dead_Sea_Scrolls\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for which parts were found), so we can't say what this section of Proverbs looked like for the sect(s) of Qumran, but in general, these partial similarities between some of the Hebrew DSS and the Septuagint make it more difficult to believe that these differences from the MT are merely from scribal error or translation difficulties.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would write this as a comment since it's more just a thought than an actual serious answer, but I don't have enough reputation to comment...</p>\n<p>My thought is that Christianity was built upon proselytizing people, i.e., changing people's entire belief system and manner of life. I can understand why a verse like the one omitted would be dissuading and possibly fundamentally at odds with a religion foundationally committed to doing what the verse says can't be done... Again, it's pure speculation, but since the current Septuagint definitely went through Early Christian Translation and many years of their possession and thus control, I don't imagine it is too far-fetched to suggest.</p>\n\n\n",

It is associated with a sensitivity that Hashem fills the universe, a sensitivity that makes us desire to be respectable, because we are in the presence of the very great Master, Who desires us to be holy and modest.</p>\n<p>Yevamot 78b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>David said: There are three distinguishing marks of this nation, the\nJewish people. They are merciful, they are <strong>bashful</strong>, and they\nperform acts of kindness...They are bashful, as it is written: “And\nthat His fear shall be upon your faces” (Shemot 20:17)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Footnotes on Yalkut Yosef:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The responsa <em>Igrot Moshe</em> (Vol. III, Yoreh De'ah. #47:3: #68:4)\nasserted that there is no halachic obligation for men to clothe their\n<strong>entire bodies</strong>, but it is a <strong>highly recommended behaviour</strong>. Even when going to a restroom, one should not undress until one is about to sit\non the toilet...</p>\n<p>In contrast to this, the responsa Mishne Halachot (Vol. VI, #2) ruled\nthat these instructions [to put on at least a robe before you even sit\nup in bed] are an absolute requirement of the Talmud, <em>Poskim</em>, and\nthe <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>. The <em>Ben Ish Chai</em> (<em>parashat Vayetze</em> halacha\n4) cited several <em>Rishonim</em> who listed <strong>modest dressing as one of the\nTorah's commandments</strong>, whereas others listed it as one of the\noutstanding traits of the nation of Yisrael, highly recommended by our\nSages. He concluded that we must take care to dress modestly since\nthere are those who ruled that it is a Torah obligation...</p>\n<p>Suppose that it is extremely hot and a man who normally wears regular\nshirts wishes to go about sleeveless. According to the <em>Igrot Moshe</em>,\nthis would be permissible. <strong>One is not expected to observe voluntary\nhalachot when it causes great discomfort</strong>. It may be, however, that\n<strong>according to the <em>Mishne Halachot</em>, it would be forbidden even in\nthese circumstances</strong>...</p>\n<p>The <em>Ben Ish Chai (parashat Vayetze halacha 4)</em>  ruled that one must\nmake sure to lock the door when using the restroom, pointing out that\nthe <em>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</em> and other <em>Rishonim</em> counted <strong>modest\nbehaviour</strong> as one of the mitzvot of the Torah...</p>\n<p>The <em>Igrot Moshe</em> stated that our Sages' definition of modest dress is\nnot that one must go about all day and night as one would be expected\nto appear in the king's palace, or that one must dress in private as\none would dress in in the presence of ordinary strangers. <strong>Although we\nmust remain aware of God's Presence, the halacha demands that we dress\nas if appearing in a king's palace only when praying the Amida</strong>, as the\nShulchan Aruch ruled (91:5). <strong>At other times, one is expected to dress\nin a manner that is respectable, so that one would not be embarrassed\nin the presence of ordinary people</strong>. He adds that when it is very\nhot, there is no obligation to observe this standard either, since\neveryone [including God] understands the situation. Regardless of the\ncircumstances, <strong>it is forbidden to expose one's genitals</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <em>Mishna Berura</em> (2:1)... states that <strong>one must not expose any part\nof the body that one normally keeps covered. One may reveal one's arm\nup to the elbow and one's throat down to the top of the chest</strong>, he\nspecified. In countries where people always wear socks, one must put\nthem on while under the covers <strong>without exposing one's bare feet</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This gives an overview of the precise way halacha views the topic. It's a beautiful halacha to learn because it is about developing a sensitivity, rather than a just rigid set of laws (although of course there are rigid laws too). That is how the halacha is written and presented.</p>\n<p><strong>According to some opinions it is highly recommended to dress properly, with sleeves and trousers and socks, even when at home, and according to others, it is an outright obligation.</strong></p>\n<p>You asked specifically about a yeshivish family, and indeed a yeshivish family should be strict with this code of conduct (not taking on strong recommendations of Chazal would be like (l'havdil) a business owner not taking advice from his accountant, unimaginable if yeshiva taught them anything), although certainly not push in any way on people who do not wish to follow the opinion that it is halacha, or even upon the people who do not want to take the recommendation. Them doing so does not imply in any way that they are lesser in Hashem's eyes.</p>\n<p>I'll finish with a story from yeshiva. We had someone who didn't dress very respectably, deliberately messy, untucked, and he was also generally quiet. He spoke to our Rosh Yeshiva once, who recommended he take it upon himself to start dressing smartly, and as a result he will feel better about himself, feel like a more respectable person, and indeed this is exactly what happened. He told me, and just about everyone how much of a real impact this had.</p>\n<p>Even if one is not on the level to be bashful and fearful to undress in Hashem's presence, one will still move towards this by following the halachot, as when one feels more respectable, it opens gates and he is able to come closer to Hashem.</p>\n<p>This effect also maintains respect in the home. Making it harder for others to find one respectable, which happens if someone lounges around in their underwear or topless, is putting up barriers to the close, holy intimate homes we are expected to produce. Respect between spouses is essential for shalom bayit. We can't deny the way Hashem made us, and He made us that we are much more able to be close with people we deeply respect. It goes without saying the importance of being respectable to one's children. It's not worth playing with that. Our home is our Mikdash Me'at.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you want to get more information on this, I do recommend getting the Yalkut Yosef, the english Saka Edition is what I used for the above quotes if you prefer english. It is very good and the section is quite long, and really gives a good portrayal of how a Yirat Shamayim's outlook should be, as well as go into modern and local exceptions and the rules for that - some yeshivas may have different holy customs than the ones outlined in the above passage. I recommend learning the whole of the 1, all seifim, especially 1:8 on the halacha of being aware of Hashem's presence always, and all the footnotes.</p>\n\n\n",

Besides, this doesn't answer why Yosef couldn't have simply told Pharoah simple personal advice to repent, indeed not as a part of the interpretation of the dream.\nPersonally, this question opened up my mind to a really cool observation. We know the Midrash says that the King of Nineveh in Sefer Yonah, was also Pharaoh (I believe it's a Machlokes if it was the same Pharaoh. See Rashi on Shemos 1:8, unless the Pharaoh changed again during the Ten Plagues, which I think might have been the case.) Either way though, we find there too that Yonah specifically did not want to tell the King to repent because of negative repercussions for the Jews. I wonder if there may be a real repetition/connection between that story, and here, Yosef specifically trying to give Pharaoh an alternative method of dealing with the punishments, other than repentance. I mean imagine if Pharoah and Egypt would have indeed repented. Maybe that would have prevented Klal Yisroel's entire future i.e., Galus & Yetzias Mitzrayim, which may very well have been a pre-requisite to receiving the Torah! Gut Shabbos, A Gut Chodesh, and A Freilichen Chanukah!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>First of all, you have to be EXTREMELY careful about how you speak about Yosef hatzaddik. He was a tzaddik, a navi, and you should be very careful to ask any question from the point o view of your lack of understanding. Comparing Yosef to the dor haflaga, chas veshalom, is something you don't want to do.</p>\n<p>That being said, lets first talk about the interpereting of the dream. The interpretation was not Yosef Hatzaddik's own interpretation, it was a nevuah (I have personally seen this brought down in Shiurei R' Shlomo Volbe and the Griz Al Hatorah). So the interpretation was not an interperetation per se, it was a nevuah.</p>\n<p>So now, the question we are left with is why did Yosef Hatzaddik choose to give practical advice on how to prepare for the upcoming famine, instead of telling Paroh to do teshuvah?</p>\n<p>For this, lets take a step back and look at the whole famine. This was orchestrated by Hashem for the purpose of bringing the shevatim, and through that the rest of bnei yisrael, to Egyptians. I saw, I forgot where, that through this whole story Yosef knew through nevuah that this was all being orchestrated as a fulfillment of his dreams that he had had (with the whear and stars bowing), and that is why Yosef Hatzaddik did what he did, at any point. So that would presumably answer your question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>From the outset, Yosef explained that the purpose of the dream was to inform Pharaoh of what is about to happen. The idea being that Pharaoh should know what to do. In fact, The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.16a.4?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr Hachaim Hakadosh</a> uses this to explain why Yosef saw fit to advise the king when he wasn't asked to do so. Moreover, continues the Ohr Hachaim, the advice is alluded to in the dream as well, where it shows the famished cows/stalks eating the fuller ones.</p>\n<p>Another point is that in general when a natural disaster hits it is not necessarily meant to be seen as a direct message, but rather we can use it to confirm, or reaffirm, fear of Hashem. In this vain the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.59a.12?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara in Brachos</a> tells us that thunder was created in order to straighten out the heart (to remind us of the might of Hashem).</p>\n<p>The Dor Haflaga was sinful in taking a clearly prophesied and clearly non-natural event out of its prophecy context and reinterpreting it as a natural occurrence. And they all knew that it wasn't the case. That would be similar to the Egyptians reacting to the Makkos as if it were a natural occurrence. But a famine is just like a hurricane.</p>\n\n\n",

It was cited in an article, I believe it was on Torah Musings but can no longer find it despite having searched several times.</p>\n<p>Can anyone identify the \"<em>midrash</em>\" in question or the article it was cited in?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are the sefirot created?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The sefirot are said to be attributes / emanations by which the Ein Sof reveals Himself to his creation.  G-d is said to be <em>the eternal one</em>. But are His sefirot also eternal or are they created?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Sefirot are very clearly created. To say that the Sefirot would be parts of Hashem would be heretical, as G-d cannot be composed of parts. To quote the classic work <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_One%2C_On_the_Creator.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Way of G-d</em></a> by the Ramchal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>And likewise [one] must know that His existence, may He be blessed, is a simple (undifferentiated) existence without composition or multiplicity at all</strong>...<strong>However this is also from the things that are known through the tradition, but they are validated by investigation through nature itself, with its axioms and properties.</strong> For it is impossible that there nevertheless not exist a Being removed from all nature, axioms and limits, from all lack and deficiency, from all multiplicity and composition, from all relationship and value and from the contingency of the creatures - to be the Ultimate Cause for all that exists and for all that develops from it. For without this Existence, those things that we see existing and their continuation would be impossible.`</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[The proofs he refers to are found in \"The Gate on Oneness\" in \"Duties of the Heart\", on which the quoted chapter is based.]</p>\n<p>To say that they exist independently and eternally beside Hashem would also be heretical:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And it is also required for one to know that it is necessary for this Being, may His name be blessed, to be one and not more. The explanation of this is that it is impossible for there to exist many beings the existence of which is independently necessary. Rather this necessary and perfect Existence must be only one. And if there exist other beings, they only exist because He made them exist with His will; so it comes out that they are all dependent on Him, and not existing from themselves. (Ibid.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what are the Sefirot? Your description of them as the \"attributes / emanations by which the Ein Sof reveals Himself\" is not bad, but missing a crucial piece at the end: \"to his creations.\"</p>\n<p>The Ramchal in his work <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51261&st=&pgnum=321\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'amar Hachachmah</a> has an introduction to the concept of Sefiros:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NLldC.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NLldC.png\" alt=\"SCreen capture from Hebrewbooks\" /></a></p>\n<p>As you see in the quotation, the Sefiros were created as the beginning of G-d's creation of the world. However, these Sefiros are absolutely not divine, because any multiplicity is impossible in relation to Hashem (as he said in Derech Hashem):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aLywk.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aLywk.png\" alt=\"Screengrab from Hebrewbooks\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Only authentic Mekubalim should feel qualified to answer this question, and I am unqualified in this regard, as will likely any anonymous person online be. I will provide sources to the authentic giants of Kabbalah who have grappled with and disputed this question (with the word \"heretic\" coming up a lot between them). This is because it is a sensitive, subtle topic, and is highly complex. I am not here speaking any of my own words, but words taught by great Rabbonim, and having personally consulted with experts and my Rav on this question. It must not be treated lightly. It's very important.</p>\n<p>Ptach Eliyahu says that Hashem</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Brought forth 10 garments and we call them sefirot</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Zohar states</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then He shaped a vessel diminutive as the letter Yod and filled it\nfrom Him, and called it Wisdom-gushing Fountain, and called Himself\nwise on its account.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The truth is, this question isn't just hard because we are amateurs, but because this is a lofty idea beyond the understanding of finite beings. Hashem \"brought forth\" these sefirot, and identified with them. In Chassidus, we say that Hashem \"has infinite sefirot\". He has everything, everything is Him, He is Ein Od Milvado, simple and perfect in every form of perfection. This is not something we can relate to in the slightest.</p>\n<p>Ramchal states in Derech Hashem 1:1:5:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>His simplicity</strong>: And likewise he must know that His existence, may He\nbe blessed, is a simple (undifferentiated) existence without\ncomposition or multiplicity at all. And all of the perfections are\nfound within Him in a simple way...</p>\n<p>...the Master, may His name be blessed, does not have different capabilities, even though He actually has properties that are differing within us. For surely He is wilful and is wise and is powerful and He is perfect in every perfection; however the truth of His existence is one matter that includes within His truth and domain (meaning the truth of His being, as having a domain is not applicable to Him, may He be blessed - rather it is only by way of literary license) everything that is a perfection</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hashem is wise, but not because of wisdom (sefira of chochma, see Zohar above). He doesn't need wisdom to be wise. Wisdom <em>comes from</em> Him (just like everything conceivable does). Hashem is ultimately and infinitely simple (and perfect, may His name be blessed eternally).</p>\n<p>It's very hard to get our temporal finite compound heads round being completely simple and one with one's wisdom (see Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah 2:10, for similar). This is not a subject for beginners. Kabbalah is not a beginner topic, even among the opinions that are more lenient around learning it, such as sefardim and chassidim. There is a danger of misunderstanding things that are precious and important.</p>\n<p>The Ramak, teacher of the Arizal, has 10 chapters in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pardes_Rimonim.4.1.1-8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pardes Rimonim Sha'ar 4: \"Essence or Vessel\"</a>, where he goes into all of the complexities, and quotes the Mekubalim who hold by the various opinions. Some of the complexities are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is a sefira?</li>\n<li>Given that the sefirot are \"Light and vessel\", what is the primary,\nthe Light or the vessel?</li>\n<li>Is the vessel part of Essence or is it created?</li>\n<li>Bli gvul or gvul?</li>\n<li>Of the opinions that say Essence, what is the exact relationship between the sefirot and Hashem's Essence (may He be blessed)?</li>\n<li>What is the Light in relation to Essence?</li>\n<li>If it is created, is it created in the same way as everything else in creation or does it fall into a third category (emanation)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Big names on both sides. Rabbi Recanati and Ramak, for example are on one (with their own differences), and the Ma'arechet Elokut (and later Arizal and even later, R' Shneur Zalman of Liadi uses Arizal and his concept of <em>Reshima</em>) are on the the other. Ramak tries to mediate and synthesise.</p>\n<p>The Tzemach Tzeddek, in <em>Drash Shalosh Shitot</em>, found in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/15942\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or Hatorah Inyanim</a>, gets to the bottom of exactly this subject, jumping off the Ramak's work. He brings the 3 main categories of opinion among the heavy weight Kabbalists:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sefirot are tools, created/emanated.</li>\n<li>Sefirot are in some way involved with Hashem's Essence (and there are 3 different versions of this: Nominalists, Theologically Unacceptable Essentialists and Acceptable Essentialists, and he brings all the caveats and limits of each one)</li>\n<li>Sefirot are \"names\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>He then suggests a grand scheme that includes all opinions. It is a highly advanced study, definitely not for beginners.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe Rashab also touches on it in a ma'amar, which I have yet to locate. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/60795\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Erechim</a> is a more contemporary work gathering and explaining the opinions and sources. See Vol III, chapter \"Sefirot\", p.192 onwards.</p>\n<p>I don't want to say any further. It's a very sensitive, delicate topic. The reader is advised that they cannot draw conclusions or really understand these things without lots and lots of Kabbalah study (and even then, we are ultimately limited by our finiteness). Chassidus is a great aid in this, as it is included in a lot of chassidic curriculum with this curiosity in mind* and explained by tzaddikim so that more people can understand parts of it without going wrong, but it's important to note that the depths are only for advanced, yirei shamayim students of Torah, with a particular affinity and training in philosophy. Many, especially from the litvish side, will strongly advise the vast majority of people to completely stay away from this topic.</p>\n<p>There are some books that are widely taught by reliable Rabbonim in english that are somewhat accessible at beginner level, such as Nefesh Hachaim, the works of Ramchal such as Derech Hashem and Daat Tevunot, and Tanya (which is written for all), and several books printed by Artscroll or Feldheim. They should all be learned with a competent, authentic orthodox Rav, with commentary and never alone.</p>\n<p>I will stress again though: a lifetime of study and contemplation with good teachers is what is needed to have any hope of understanding even small details in this topic, and even then, only after having a good grounding in Tanach, the words of Chazal, and reading and logic comprehension (Ramchal).</p>\n<p>My Rav explained to me something we can all take away from this. Regardless of whether the sefirot are created, emanated or something else, the main point is, they are how Hashem expresses Himself to His creation. The real question is - how deep does that expression go? We say Hashem desires us (Keter) and loves us (Chesed) - is it true? The answer, according to all of the opinions, is Hashem identifies with the sefirot (see Zohar above), so when He says He loves us, and wants us, He really means it. We may not be able to understand it in our finite, amatuer minds, and the experts may debate the details, but the pashut Yid should know Hashem's love and desire is real. My child may not understand my complex adult world, but he knows I love him. An onlooker, seeing me play with my child, is seeing the real me, deeper than when they see me \"being an adult doing adult things\", because when I play with my child, I am totally personalised and identified with my love for him - it's me. K'veyachol, the holy Zohar states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קודשא בריך הוא, אורייתא, ויׂשראל. וכל חד</p>\n<p>Hashem, Torah and Yisrael are all One (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.3.73a.4?vhe=New_Torat_Emet_Zohar&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 73b</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The bracha \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Edot_HaMizrach%2C_Weekday_Arvit%2C_The_Shema.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohev et amo Yisrael</a>\" is not a bracha levatala, chas veshalom.</p>\n<p><strong>Please do take away the following uncontroversial truths, agreed upon across the board: the sefirot <em>are not His partners</em> chas veshalom. They also don't mean to imply He is composed of parts, or that we should worship them as a means to get to Him chas veshalom. This is not what the Kabbalah is saying and any good Kabbalah sefer will stress this over and over - it is an easy misconception to fall for, and does the rounds in the anti-Kabbalah circles a lot. On the other side, it's important to not go too far, and say Hashem is incapable of certain things, or \"doesn't really want or love\", chas veshalom.</strong></p>\n<p>* See Rabbi Chaim Vital’s introduction to Shaar Hakdamot, Vilna Gaon's Even Shelemah 11:3, the letter of the Baal Shem Tov to his brother in Keter Shem Tov, and Zohar 1:117a, 118a, 3:124b on the permissibility and importance of learning Kabbalah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Although @RabbiKaii made a great starting point on this subject, I would like to dive into the words of the Ramak, Rav Moshe Kordovero.</p>\n<p>The Ramak writes in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_Neerav%2C_PART_VI.1.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or Neerav (6:1:4-5)</a>, regarding the \"making of\" the Sefiros:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[The beginner] needs to know that Ein Sof caused and emanated His sefirot, and His actions are [performed] through them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to the Ramak, the Ein Sof caused His sefiros. They \"emanated from Him\". Thus, since the sefiros are emanated from G-d, it can be said that they are eternal, since G-d performs actions through them.</p>\n<p>Side note: the Rebbe Rashab, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholom_Dovber_Schneersohn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Sholom DovBer Schneersohn</a> writes in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58811&st=&pgnum=231&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maamar Yom Tov shel Rosh Hashanah 5666 (p. 223)</a> that the term \"Ein Sof\" connotes that G-d has nothing that can define Him. The term Ein Sof is not definable. Because, when G-d was definable, \"He would have limitation and definition, because it is impossible for a body not to be limited. And any entity which itself is limited and defined [possesses] only limited and defined power.\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.1.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Yesodei HaTorah, Halacha 1:7)</a>.</p>\n<p>Back to the topic, the Ramak goes on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They constitute <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the ten “sayings” through which he acts</a>. They serve him as vessels for the actions which derive from Him in the World of Separation2 and below. Truly His being and essence extend themselves in them, as we will explain in greater detail.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramak stresses out that the sefiros are not a cause of the Ein Sof, but rather the other way around:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[The beginner] must know that Eyn Sof is not [identical with] Keter, as many have thought. Eyn Sof is, rather, the cause of Keter, and Keter is derived from Eyn Sof, which is the Cause of Causes. He must also know that Eyn Sof is the First Cause of all that exists, for there is no cause above it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Tikkunei Zohar, it <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tikkunei_Zohar.17a.2?ven=Pata%E1%B8%A5_Eliyahu,_translated_by_Avraham_Sutton&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But You are He who brought forth ten rectifications - we call them the ten sefirot Atzilut - with which to regulate</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the significance of demanding that a Jew write on the horn of an ox that they have no portion in the G-d of Israel?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In reflecting over the concepts of Hanukkah there seem, at first glance, to be many contradictory and conflicting messages.</p>\n<p>In the blessing related to Hanukkah we acknowledge, thank and praise G-d for the miracles, relief and salvation, etc. which G-d did for us when the Greeks attempted to cause us to forget G-d’s Torah and to transgress G-d’s will.</p>\n<p>It then enumerates, contrasts and compares the <em>negative</em> attributes of the Greeks with the <em>positive</em> attributes of the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>This is the general summary of the commemoration of Hanukkah.</p>\n<p>But in contrast to this, we find only a few centuries later that the Greeks, Greek wisdom (consider Rambam’s Moreh Nevuchim) and language are accorded places of special honor by none other than Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel like is taught in Megilla 9b and Sotah 49b. That only a Sefer Torah written in Koine Greek is considered holy and valid from all the other languages of the nations. And of the 1000 students in the Yeshiva of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s father, 500 studied the wisdom of the Torah and 500 studied Greek wisdom! It would seem that all the lessons from the Hellenists and Maccabees were forgotten.</p>\n<p>And yet when summarizing the true message of Hanukkah, Torah says (see Bereshit Rabbah 2:5 and 44:20) that the Greeks demanded of the Jews that they write on the horn of an ox that they have no portion in the G-d of Israel!</p>\n<p>How does this act represent and encompass the essence of the message of Hanukkah and how is this message to be understood in the apparently contradictory behavior of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel only a few centuries later?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This vort is really part of a much bigger essay that I heard, but for this specific point here's the short and simple pshat that I was told. In Lashon Hakodesh the letter \"Shin\" in the beginning of a root generally denotes \"Tameness\", while the letter \"Peh\" in the beginning of a root generally denotes \"Wildness\". (Try this out for yourself.) In line with this a \"Par\" is a bull, while a \"Shor\" is an ox. The difference between an ox and a bull is, an ox is a castrated male while a bull is uncastrated. Symbolically speaking the ox is pictured with a yoke on its back while a bull is running free with a red cape flying in the wind (Hence the \"Parah\" Adumah's clearly untamed description.) Now, the horns of a bull are intended to be used for fighting. However, a Shor which is a castrated and tamed version of its former self, it has absolutely no need for its horns! Its horns are vestigial! Therefore, on a simple level since the horn of an ox is the perfect representation of the concept of \"old-fashioned/No-longer-relevant\", the Greeks forced the Jews to write that their religion is also no longer relevant on the horn of an ox.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>B\"H, I recently discussed this chiddush with my chavrusa.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Daniel.8.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel 8:5</a>, it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and the goat had a conspicuous horn between its eyes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shelah HaKadosh writes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Vayeshev%2C_Miketz%2C_Vayigash%2C_Torah_Ohr.143?ven=Shney_Luchot_Habrit_by_Rabbi_Eliyahu_Munk&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Torah Shebikhtav, Vayeshev, Miketz, Vayigash, Torah Ohr 143)</a> that the exile under the Greek empire is named קרן (see also the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Daat_Zkenim_on_Genesis.15.12.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daas Zkenim on Bereishis 15:12</a>) - horn. Why?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Greeks darkened the eyes of Israel and wanted to deprive it of any vestige of holiness, even of the reduced level of holiness Israel still possessed and symbolized by the ox's single horn</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, the Shelah writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Greeks demanded that the Jews inscribe on the horn of their oxen that they had dissociated themselves from the G–d of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But why on horns? The Shelah goes on to explain that in different places in Torah and Tanach, the word קרן is used in reference to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moshe Rabbeinu; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Balak%2C_Torah_Ohr.6?ven=Shney_Luchot_Habrit_by_Rabbi_Eliyahu_Munk&lang=bi&p2=Exodus.34.29&lang2=bi&aliyot2=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 34:29</a></li>\n<li>Torah itself; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Habakkuk.3.4?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Habakkuk 3:4 with Rashi</a></li>\n<li>Priesthood; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Balak%2C_Torah_Ohr.6?ven=Shney_Luchot_Habrit_by_Rabbi_Eliyahu_Munk&lang=bi&p2=Psalms.112.9&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 112:9</a></li>\n<li>B'nei Yisrael; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Balak%2C_Torah_Ohr.6?ven=Shney_Luchot_Habrit_by_Rabbi_Eliyahu_Munk&lang=bi&p2=Psalms.148.14&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 148:14</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regarding the horns of B'nei Yisrael, the Shelah writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash continues that all of these \"horns\" were placed on the heads of the Jewish people, but they forfeited them due to their sins. [...] Provided Israel repents, G–d will restore these horns to their rightful place viz. Psalms 75,11: \"And I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.\" This refers to the horns that the “Righteous One of the world,” i.e. G–d, had cut off. When is the time that He will restore them to their righful position? It is when G–d will raise the horn of His anointed: \"He will raise the horn of His anointed\" (Samuel I 2,10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I don't know the full answer but I remember one remez from the Hida about this is that Yosef ha Tzadik was like an ox, and the Shechinah rested upon him, so it was like the Greeks made klah Israel renounce the Shechinah, like saying the Shechinah is not with you anymore because just like the sin of the golden calf, where a calf was built and the Shechinah departed, you are sinning now also so the Shechinah is departed from you now also, and writing on the ox's horn demonstrates this. If anyone knows the exact source please comment with exact wording, please comment, since I am going from memory and I didn't read it directly but heard it in a shiur.</p>\n<p>Also this may not be the Hida but I remember that Sukkot was instituted after the miracle that happened after the sin of the golden calf, and Honukkah was instituted after this happened, which has a parallel because both came after sins involving an ox or calf.</p>\n<p>Sorry it's not a full answer. There is very little Torah I can recall and post that you wouldn't already know better than me, but hopefully there is something here good for someone reading. It felt like more than a comment although not a full answer either.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Deism avoda zara?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is Deism avoda zara? It would seem that deists, like Muslims, fall into the category of righteous gentiles, Noahidism. Like Islam, Deism only accepts that there is but one God. Famous American founding father and deist Tom Paine explains the tenets of Deism:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life. I believe the equality of man, and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy... That the only true religion is deism, by which I then meant and now mean the belief of one God, and an imitation of his moral character, or the practice of what are called moral virtues;⁠—and that it was upon this only (so far as religion is concerned) that I rested all my hopes of happiness hereafter. So say I now⁠—and so help me God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tom Paine's formulation of a deist is someone who believes in one God and no more. They rest at God and do not go further in positing a revelation from God. Based on this formulation, are they Noahides?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You are missing a fundamental distinction between Islam and Deism, that Islam is also trying to worship the one G-d of the universe, just they are doing it in the wrong way. The stories of Islam and Judaism are very much intertwined, and they split of by Yitzchak and Yishmael. In fact, (I heard that) Rav Moshe Shapiro said that one has to treat a praying Muslim like a Jew davening shemonah esrei (in regards to not being able to walk within 4 amos of them) - because they are praying to the one true G-d of the universe, Hashem, the G-d of Avraham avinu - however, there religion is not true, and they are not serving him in the correct way.</p>\n<p>That being said, it does not appear that Deism is idolatry, as it does not worship idols - it is just a fake, untrue religion, and total kefira.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Lichtenstein asks:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why the yeshiva world’s continued commitment to gemara? I believe we may single out at least four distinct and yet confluent factors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Explanation of the principles and parameters of the laws</h3>\n<p>The gemara comprises the analyses of the Sages in the centuries immediately following the Mishna's redaction. These analyses provide insight into the parameters of — and the principles underlying — the laws of the Mishna and other Tannaitic expositions. This relates to the first factor:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first is its status as a primary – in a sense, in the world of <em>Torah she-be’al peh</em>, as the primary – text. On the one hand, in contrast with much of Mishnah, the gemara is not a compendium of inchoate factual or normative data. <strong>It is the arena within which raw material is analyzed and molded, within which bare bones are fleshed out and information transmuted into knowledge...</strong> Recourse to secondary or tertiary texts may simplify, but it almost certainly dilutes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Exposure to the personalities of the Talmudic Sages</h3>\n<p>The gemara is not, however, a merely legalistic tome, filled with dry debates. Rather, the personalities of the Sages shine through on every page, in the anecdotes of their lives and conduct, in their personal interactions, in their vivid and variegated dialectic styles, and in the milieu within which they lived and operated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[The second factor:] Relation to the primary source is felt not only with respect to the text or its content. It is felt, in a personal vein, with regard to Hazal. <strong>To open a gemara is to enter into [Hazal's] overawing presence, to feel the force of their collective personality... so as to be irradiated and ennobled by them.</strong> It is to be exposed, with a sense of intimacy, not only to their discourse, exegesis, aphorisms, or anecdotes, but to themselves – <strong>at once engaging and magisterial, thoroughly human and yet overwhelming...</strong> The gemara is clearly special. This is due, in part, to its structure as an arena within which the mind encounters a panoply of personages spanning successive generations. Primarily, however, it is attributable to Hazal’s unique stature... We acknowledge them... by virtue of the conjunction of their distinctive greatness and their historical position.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Immersion and participation in the dialectical process</h3>\n<p>However, the gemara is not merely (per the first factor) a legal manual that provides us with a finished product explaining the principles underlying Mishnaic teachings. It is not desultorily interspersed (per the second factor) with vivifying biographical details merely to help us better relate to the Sages or break up the monotony of legal discourse.</p>\n<p>Rather, the very mode in which the gemara's dialectics are presented is highly dynamic, inviting the student to become immersed in the discussions. The student eventually learns to personally clarify and apply legal principles. He thereby participates in the process of the Living Torah, creatively drawing forth new insights and practical applications that are faithful to the edifice of the gemara while yet building upon it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This point dovetails with a third factor, the substantive nature of gemara. We are accustomed to distinguishing between <em>Torah she-bi’khtav</em> as a fixed datum... and <em>Torah she-be’al peh</em>, sinuous, efflorescent, developmental. <em>Asher natan lanu Torat emet</em>, “Who has given us a Torah of truth,” explains the Tur, refers to the former, while, <strong><em>ve-hayyei olam nata betokheinu</em>, “and eternal life He has implanted within us,” refers to the latter...</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gemara expounds \"the rationale of the Mishnah’s reasons...\"</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.33a.12?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi, Bava Mezia 33a, s.vv. <em>mishnah</em> and <em>she-limmedo hokhmah</em></a>). As such, it was defined by Hazal and the Rishonim as a reliable guide to practical observance. <strong>The student of [gemara] is actively engaged in an intellectual enterprise, both analytic and synthetic</strong>: \"He shall understand and perceive a conclusion from its inception, will extract one matter from another and compare one to another... to the point that he will apprehend the essence of these principles and how to extract the prohibited and the licit\" (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910973/jewish/Talmud-Torah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam's Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Talmud Torah 1:11</a>). In a word, Mishnah is the given <em>Torat emet</em> [Torah of truth] of the oral tradition, and gemara its implanted <em>hayyei olam</em> [eternal life].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Relatively speaking, the study of Mishnah per se is passive, at times even submissive; that of gemara is vibrant. <strong>To open a <em>sugya</em> is to gain access to a world in ferment. It is to enter a pulsating <em>bet midrash</em>, studded with live protagonists; to be caught up</strong>, initially as witness and subsequently <strong>as participant</strong>, in a drama of contrapuntal challenge and response, of dialectic thrust and parry; to be stimulated by the tension of creative impulse; to be charged by the <em>Sturm und Drang</em> of <em>milhamtah shel Torah</em> [the battle of Torah].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Connecting with the Almighty via immersion in Divine wisdom</h3>\n<p>We cannot expect to learn all the Torah that there is to learn, for \"its measure is longer than the Earth and broader than the sea\" (<a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2711.htm#9\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Iyov</em> 11:9</a>). The gemara's format, often filled with incomplete or unresolved discussions, reminds us of that. Yet the study of gemara is no Sisyphean task. Every moment spent probing the depths of Divine wisdom is a moment spent in the company of the Divine Presence (<em>cf.</em> Rambam's <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910346/jewish/Deot-Chapter-Six.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Mishne Torah</em>, <em>Hil. Dei'os</em> 6:2</a>,<sup>1</sup> based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.111b.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>K'subos</em> 111b</a> and <em>Sifre</em> Deut. 11:22):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Often, a <em>sugya</em> “ends,” as T. S. Eliot said of Henry James’s novels, like life itself: unfinished. Hazal themselves perceived the Bavli as a potpourri... Its very amorphousness also serves as a source of challenge and fascination. These are not, to be sure, ends in themselves. <strong>We fasten upon gemara not out of a quest for intellectual stimulation, but out of cleaving to <em>devar Hashem</em>.</strong> But to the extent that we are gripped and animated by its vitality, the stimulus attains religious significance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This, in conclusion, brings us to the fourth element. Traditionally, <em>Yahadut</em> has stressed that <strong><em>talmud Torah</em> is not to be perceived as a purely intellectual pursuit. It constitutes, rather, a dialogic encounter with <em>Ribbono shel Olam</em>.</strong> This is a truism of the yeshiva world and axiomatic to the existence of every serious <em>ben Torah</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Clearly, however, the nature of the encounter is a function of the character of one’s learning. When Rabbi Halafta ben Dosa Ish Kefar Hananyah spoke of the immanence of the Shekhinah in this context, he focused upon its presence among those who are <em>yoshevim ve-osekim ba-Torah</em>, “those who are sitting and engaged in Torah” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avot 3:6</a>) – not simply studying Torah but caught up by it. <strong>To the extent that one is more deeply and intensely involved, insofar as one’s being is more fully charged, one is more powerfully engrossed by the encounter.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup><sub>\"מצות עשה להדבק בחכמים ותלמידיהם כדי ללמוד ממעשיהם כענין שנאמר ובו תדבק וכי אפשר לאדם להדבק בשכינה אלא כך אמרו חכמים בפירוש מצוה זו הדבק בחכמים ותלמידיהם... וכן צוו חכמים ואמרו והוי מתאבק בעפר רגליהם ושותה בצמא את דבריהם\".

The Sages likewise commanded and said, 'And become dusty with the dust of their feet, and drink thirstily their words' (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Avos</em> 1:4</a>).</sub></p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Hi and thanks for the question. Definitionally, I don't think I can use any of your examples because Torah learning is different. There is a concept called learning Torah \"lishma\", which means for its own sake, and this is considered the correct way to learn (see for eg. Rambam Hilchot Teshuva 10:2). Or \"leshem shamayim\", for the sake of heaven. The short answer is, we have an obligation to learn it, that precedes us and is not for us to take benefit from, but to fulfil that obligation that is incumbent upon us. We don't need to know why, we need to fulfil our duty, the mitzva hagadol of talmud Torah.</p>\n<p>The closest we can get to matching your way of thinking is this: Torah is the instruction for the mitzvot, so we study it in order to perform them (see Avot 4:5). The mitzvot are our very purpose in life, the performance of which are Hashem's plan. Learning Torah gives us this by giving us the details of the mitzvot, and <strong>learning gemara especially teaches us how to think properly the way Hashem wants us to think</strong> so we can solve all of life's problems and be holy in all our dealings, and face new problems in Hashem's correct way. However this is not the main point or purpose of learning gemara.</p>\n<p>If you would like a little more insight, let me give you a quick history. The Oral Torah was given to Moshe by Hashem, and then to Yehoshua, who gave it to Pinchas and his court, who gave it to Eli and his court, who gave it to Shmuel and his court, who gave it to King David, to Achia HaShiloni, to Eliyahu, to Elisha, to Yehoyada, to Zecharia his son, to Hoshea, to Amos, to Yishayahu, to Micha, to Yoel, to Nachum, to Chabbakuk, to Tzefaniah, to Yirmiyahu, to Baruch ben Neriyah, to Ezra, to Shimon Hatzaddik, to Antignos of Socho, to Yosse ben Yo'ezer and Yosef ben Yochanan, to Yehoshua ben Perachiah and Nittai of Arbel, to Yehudah ben Tabbai and Shimon ben Shatach, to Shemaya and Avtalyon, to Hillel and Shammai, to Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai and Rabbi Shimon, the son of Hillel, to Rabban Gamliel, the elder, to Rabban Shimon, to Rabban Gamliel, to Rabbi Shimon, to Rebbi, who wrote the mishna, to Rabbi Yochanan, Rav, and Shemuel, to Rav Huna, to Rabbah, to Ravva, to Rav Ashi, who redacted the gemara.</p>\n<p>The gemara was written down because this chain of transmission wasn't functioning as well as it used to, so the sealing of the Mishna and the Talmud represents the last step in the chain of the Oral Torah's transmission in the unbroken, complete chain. This is why gemara is so important, it's our last strong link to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.5a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hashem's inheritance, gift and sale</a> of Torah. It's all we have left of that as Rambam states in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introduction to Mishneh Torah</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus, [the source of] all these people's knowledge is God, the Lord of Israel. All the sages who were mentioned were the leaders of the generations. Among them were heads of academies, heads of the exile, and members of the great Sanhedrin. Together with them in each generation, there were thousands and myriads that heard their [teachings].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud relates (ibid):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>those matters which were decreed by the sages and prophets in\neach generation in order to \"build a fence around the Torah.\" We were\nexplicitly taught about [this practice] by Moses, as [implied by\nLeviticus 18:30]: \"And you shall observe My precepts,\" [which can be\ninterpreted to mean]: \"Make safeguards for My precepts.\"\nSimilarly, it includes the customs and ordinances that were ordained\nor practiced in each generation according to [the judgment of] the\ngoverning court of that generation.</p>\n<p>It is forbidden to deviate from\n[these decisions], as [implied by Deuteronomy 17:11]: \"Do not deviate\nfrom the instructions that they will give you, left or right.\" It\nalso includes marvelous judgments and laws which were not received\nfrom Moses, but rather were derived by the courts of the [later]\ngenerations based on the principles of Biblical exegesis. The elders\nof those generations made these decisions and concluded that this was\nthe law. Rav Ashi included in the Talmud this entire [body of\nknowledge, stemming] from the era of Moses, our teacher, until his\n[own] era.</p>\n<p>The Sages of the Mishnah also composed other texts to\nexplain the words of the Torah. Rabbi Hoshaia, the disciple of Rabbenu\nHakadosh, composed an explanation of the book of Genesis. Rabbi\nYishmael [composed] an explanation beginning at \"These are the names\"\n[the beginning of the book of Exodus,] until the conclusion of the\nTorah. This is called the Mechilta. Rabbi Akiva also composed a\nMechilta.29 Other Sages of the following generations composed other\n[collections of the] interpretations [of verses] (Medrashim). All of\nthese works were composed before the Babylonian Talmud.</p>\n<p>Thus,\nRavina, Rav Ashi, and their colleagues represent the final era of the\ngreat Sages of Israel who transmitted the Oral Law. They passed\ndecrees, ordained practices, and put into effect customs. These\ndecrees, ordinances, and customs spread out among the entire Jewish\npeople in all the places where they lived.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we want to know what the law is, in all its details, as well as all of the official decrees and fences our sages instituted throughout all the generations, the Talmud is our source. Everything must start from there. Any decrees or fences that came afterward is only binding on the communities it originated, and everything taught forwards must find its home somewhere in Talmud (or similar, don't forget Tosefta, Braitot, Mishna, Midrash).</p>\n<p>Rambam writes (ibid):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, if one of the Geonim interpreted the path of judgment in a\ncertain way, while the court which arose afterward interpreted the\nproper approach to the matter in a different way, the [opinion of the]\nfirst [need] not be adhered to [absolutely]. Rather, whichever\n[position] appears to be correct - whether the first or the last - is\naccepted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe you are wondering what the point of all this is, and why Jews have done something like this, taken it so seriously, died for it, especially when much of it seems to be done purely \"lishma\", for its own sake!</p>\n<p><strong>The answer is this: Hashem gave us the Torah. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.105a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">It is a revelation of Himself</a>, otherwise we can't know Him. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Edot_HaMizrach%2C_Weekday_Arvit%2C_The_Shema.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">We are His</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.41?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">He is ours</a>, and we have a mitzva to get to know Him (first law of Mishneh Torah!). Talmud Torah is our way of getting to know Him, and the more we dig out, the more we discuss and produce over the generations, the deeper that knowledge becomes, and the closer we get. As the Rambam states in Hilchot Teshuva above, and end of Mishnayot Makkot, \"lishma\" and \"out of love\" are related. We do it because we love Him and want to get closer, that's \"for its own sake\", because He is revealed completely in the Torah; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.3.73a.4?vhe=New_Torat_Emet_Zohar&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">He is One with Torah</a>. The more light we have to fill the world with.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>First I'll explain what the Torah is, and then I'll explain why we learn it, and the fundamental difference between the Torah and all other wisdoms.</p>\n<p>The Torah is divided into to parts - Torah Shebiksav (the written Torah), and Torah Sheba'al Peh (the Oral Torah). Torah Shebiksav is the bible, and Torah Sheba'al Peh includes that Talmud, which learns up and explains the Torah Shebiksav. But its important to note that the Torah and the Talmud are not just textbooks, they are the word of G-d.</p>\n<p>So why do we learn Talmud? The Mesilas Yesharim explains (in a nutshell), out purpose in this world as Jews is to come closer to Hashem (G-d), and for that Hashem gave us 2 pathways - the learning of Torah, and the mitzvos (commandments).</p>\n<p>So what is the fundamental difference between the Torah and other wisdoms (besides for that the Torah is the word of G-d)? Torah is nitzchiyus. That means it is eternal. Torah is not like other wisdoms, it is not just a knowledge. It is the way Hashem gave with us to connect with him. Walk into a study hall in a university, and all is quiet - everybody is quietly studying their subjects, trying to memorize whatever they are reading. But walk into a beis medrash where Torah is being being learnt - its alive! Ah! People are talking, people are arguing, people are debating! Its a living Torah. Its not another wisdom, its G-d's words, the words he gave us so that we can connect to him. Its not merely a dry, purely intellectual thing - its living!</p>\n\n\n",

In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, “the stranger of the gate” is always the geir toshav, who came to dwell in “the gates of our cities” and has taken upon himself the Seven Laws of the Noachides. It is he who is called “the stranger who eats the unlawfully-slaughtered animal,” of whom Scripture says, thou mayest give it to the stranger that is within thy gates, that he may eat it. Therefore, the commandment [prohibiting work on the Sabbath] was not directed to him so that Scripture would be saying: “Do not do any work on it, the home-born or the stranger.” Instead, it is we who are commanded that he do no work for our benefit, just as [we are commanded about] our minors and the cattle, but this commandment is not incumbent upon him and he may do work for himself on the Sabbath. The verse which states, so that the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may rest, speaks of the righteous proselyte who has become Jewish and embraced our Torah, which has commanded him concerning the Sabbath and all the rest of the commandments as well, as He has said, One law and one ordinance shall be both for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you; both for the stranger, and for him that is born in the land. However, we have found in the words of our Rabbis that they have interpreted it in the opposite manner. Thus they have said that by way of the plain meaning of Scripture, thy stranger that is within thy gates means the righteous proselyte, and ceasing from work [on the Sabbath] is incumbent upon him as it is upon us. The verse, so that the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may rest, includes the uncircumcised geir toshav. The Rabbis’ intent in so explaining the verses is that first, [i.e., right here in the Ten Commandments], “the stranger” warned is the proselyte who has been circumcised, who is obligated in the observance of the Sabbath as we are. The second verse — [further, 23:12] — includes the uncircumcised [geir toshav]. Therefore, he is likened there to the cattle, as the verse says, that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may rest. Thus He commanded us concerning the resting of all of them alike that they should not work for us, but they may do [work] for themselves if they so wish.\"</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Is it an abstract noun to describe ‘A living force being’?.. there must be a way to define what God is, if we use it all the time to refer to this One and Divine Being which we often call Ein Sof.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The reason you have probably had trouble with this is because it is a subtle, theological question with many caveats and confusions. As you've written, what's the difference between Havaya and Elokim, and how do they relate to the Ein Sof, and Hashem Himself? To answer all this, a lot of learning and study, especially of Jewish Philosophy, Kabbalah and Chassidus, are in order, but the most important thing for everyone to know is He is absolutely One.</p>\n<p>However, you do make things easier by simply saying 'in plain english, “What is God”'. This can be answered:</p>\n<p>The Rambam gives the definition in the first halacha of Mishneh Torah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יְסוֹד הַיְסוֹדוֹת וְעַמּוּד הַחָכְמוֹת לֵידַע שֶׁיֵּשׁ שָׁם מָצוּי\nרִאשׁוֹן. וְהוּא מַמְצִיא כָּל נִמְצָא. וְכָל הַנִּמְצָאִים\nמִשָּׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ וּמַה שֶּׁבֵּינֵיהֶם לֹא נִמְצְאוּ אֶלָּא\nמֵאֲמִתַּת הִמָּצְאוֹ:</p>\n<p>The foundation of all foundations and the pillar of wisdom is to know\nthat there is a Primary Being who brought into being all existence.\nAll the beings of the heavens, the earth, and what is between them\ncame into existence only from the truth of His being.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First statement of Derech Hashem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מציאות ה׳‎: כל איש מישראל צריך שיאמין וידע שיש שם מצוי ראשון קדמון\nונצחי והוא שהמציא וממציא כל מה שנמצא במציאות והוא האלוה ב״ה:</p>\n<p>The Existence of G-d: Every Jew needs to believe and know that a First\nBeing exists. [This Being] is without beginning or end. He brought\ninto existence and [constantly] creates everything that is present in\nexistence. This [Being] is G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The answer to \"What is God\" is <strong>the primordial Existence from which all other existence derives</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is a question of \"מציאות\", existence, and Ramchal goes on to define the 6 things we know about His Existence (may He be blessed).</p>\n<p>Hashem is not a \"what\" but a \"Who\", as you alluded to in your question. \"Who\" He is, is a more accurate question than \"What\", which is why the question will often get converted into that. He has no need for a מציאות, and, to the extent we can think of Him in those terms, He is One with His מציאות. It is still disrespectful, bordering on heretical, to think of Him as a \"what\" and care must be taken in our language.</p>\n<p>He Himself is more than a definition. About He Himself, the Alter Rebbe writes in Torah Or, Megilat Ester 99B:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fact that all the worlds are brought into existence by God and\nreceive their vitality and sustenance from Him - this is not the\nessence of what God is. For as we say \"You are who You are before  the\nworld was created, and after the world was created\" (Adon Olam) -\nexactly the same. Also, if God would not create the worlds, all would\nbe the same regarding Him</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maharal writes (Gevurot Hashem Hakdama 2):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our sages, of blessed memory, refer to God as \"the Holy One, Blessed\nbe He\"... The term \"holy\" denotes an entity that is apart and removed.\n[It therefore describes God,] because God is abstract in the most\nultimate sense of abstraction. But precisely because God is the\nultimate abstraction, there is nothing that is excluded from Him.</p>\n<p>When something has a definition, and is distinguished by certain\ncharacteristics, that same definition will exclude form it things that\nare outside of that definition. But because God has no definition at\nall, nothing is excluded from Him. Therefore, He knows everything and\ncan do anything. All this is because God is not defined by any\nspecific definitions, therefore, everything comes from Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a course by the JLI on \"What is God\". Rav Manis Friedman gives a great class on it, recorded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5An6jsH4tA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, and well worth a watch.</p>\n<p>I will note, we say 3 times a day \"Hashem Echad\".

The fear of YHWH is the beginning of knowledge and wisdom. The friendship of YHWH is with those who fear Him, and He makes known to them His covenant.</p>\n<p>Job thought he knew about Hashem. Indeed, even Hashem said Job spoke rightly about Him in contrast to his companions (Job 42:7). Yet when Hashem questioned Job, asking Job if he knew any of the depths of His wisdom, knowledge, and power, Job laid his hand on his mouth, ashamed of how he had boasted in what he thought he knew, and said he would speak no more. (Job 40:4-5) The climactic statement of Job is a banner for the wise: “I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted. ‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’ Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know. ‘Hear, and I will speak; I will question you, and you make it known to me.’ I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you; therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes.”Job 42:2‭-‬6.</p>\n<p>Man does not know the answer to your question. It can't be known by beings so small like ourselves. Hashem is so very set-apart, and we are but dust, a flower of the field that perishes, a wisp of smoke that is but for a moment. All that we know are the bits He has chosen to reveal; the hidden things belong to Him (Deuteronomy 29:29).</p>\n<p>\"With the humble is wisdom.\" Proverbs 11:2.</p>\n<p>\"O YHWH, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me.

    "content": "# Did the story of Judah and Tamar happen before or during Joseph in Egypt?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I don't know if this question has already been asked here, I searched and couldn't find it.</p>\n<p>Does the story of Judah and Tamar develop during Joseph's age to Egypt? If so, in that case the children of Judah had to be 9 years old to give Judah time ahead with his brothers to go to Egypt to look for food because the 7 years were of abundance according to the prophecy and the 7 years of famine and I mention 9 because it took two years with Joseph in Egypt for Pharaoh to have the dream in which the prophecy would begin. What I see is that chapter 38, which is where this story of Judah and Tamar is found, seems to break the line of reasoning that chapter 37 of Genesis was giving, the sale of Joseph, in chapter 39 it will deal with Joseph's stay in the Egypt proper. The end of chapter 37 seems to be consistent with the beginning of chapter 39.</p>\n<p>Is it inconceivable that the stories in Genesis are not necessarily in chronological order? Or do we have to maintain that Judah's children were 9 years old or a little older and committed that whole event of wasting seed if at that age that would be biologically possible, apart from the fact that Judah deceived Tamar by making her wait for the third son to grow up to If he marries her, that is, it seems like a story displaced from the chapters that surround it, couldn't this story be located well before they sold Joseph? What does tradition, sages and Judaism have to say about, or has not even addressed this apparent problem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One potential answer is that given by Chizkuni, that men and women were able to have children earlier in those days.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You could well ask that seeing that it took only 22 years until the\nbrothers under the leadership of Yehudah went down to Egypt in order\nto buy grain, how was it possible that during these few years not only\ndid Bat Shua, Yehudah’s wife bear him three sons, Er, Onan, and\nShelah, but that two of them had already become married? And a few\nyears after the death of Onan, Yehudah sired twins from his\ndaughterinlaw Tamar, all before the descent of the brothers to Egypt\nfor the first time? The answer to such questions is that in those\ntimes girls and boys were able to both sire and conceive and give\nbirth already at the age of seven. According to a historical text\naccepted by our sages as accurate and reliable, called seder olam, Er,\nYehudah’s oldest was born approximately a year after the sale of\nJoseph. Bat Shua bore Yehudah two more sons in short order, before she\ndied (verse 12). When Er was seven years old he married Tamar. When he\ndied and married Onan, and Onan died, Shelah was still too young to\nmarry. Tamar remained a widow in the house of Yehudah for a year\nbefore returning to her mother’s home. When two or three more years\nhad passed and she was not allowed to marry Shelah, she took matters\ninto her own hands and contrived to become pregnant from a member of\nYaakov’s family, her dearest desire, i.e. she became pregnant by her\nfatherinlaw, Yehudah. All of this had only taken about 19 years after\nYehudah had been deposed and moved away from his brothers. In the\nmeantime, Peretz, one of the twins Tamar had born to Yehudah had\nmarried at the age of seven and had himself become a father of\nChetzron and Chamul, (Genesis 46,12) all before Yaakov and his family\nmoved down to Egypt after the brothers’ second trip there. By the time\nChetzron and Chamul came to Egypt, only twenty two years had elapsed\nsince the sale of Joseph.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In addition to the chizkuni that Rabbi Kaii brought in his answer, the bechor Shor on B'reishis (38:1), the Da'as Z'keinim (written by the Tosafos) there, as well as <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46817&st=&pgnum=82\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Hadoros</a> and others also say that Er, Onan, and Shelah were 7 or 8 years old when they got married, and also claim that at that point in history, this was possible from a biology standpoint (quoting a gemara in the 8th perek of Sanhedrin, 69b).</p>\n<p>The reason they explain in this way and don't say that the stories in the Torah are out of chronological order (and all of this happened much before the sale of Yosef) is a Midrash in B'reishis Rabba (quoted by Rashi on 38:1) which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויהיה בעת ההיא. למה נסמכה פרשה זו לכאן והפסיק בפרשתו של יוסף? ללמד שהורידוהו אחיו מגדולתו כשראו בצרת אביהם אמרו אתה אמרת למכרו אילו אמרת להשיבו היינו שומעים לך</p>\n<p><strong>And it came to pass at that time</strong>: why is this section here, interrupting the section dealing with Yosef? To teach that his brothers removed him [based on the next words of the Passuk] from his high position when they saw their father's grief, saying \"you said to sell him. If you had said to return him, we would've listened\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(There is a similar gemara in sotah). This indicates that the entire story starting from Yehuda being forced to leave originated in Yosef's sale, forcing us to say that his kids were married and supposed to have kids by around age 8.</p>\n<p>However, the Ibn Ezra on that passuk (38:1) points out this problem, and comes to the conclusion that the story of Yehuda happened before the sale of Yosef (and is only mentioned now to contrast between Yehuda's actions with Tamar and Yosef's actions with Potifar's wife). The Tur brings this explanation as well.</p>\n\n\n",

One verse reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>31 The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your priestly house, so that no one in it will reach old age</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem with this is the fact that Hophni and Phinehas, Eli's sons, both seem to reached old age:</p>\n<p>Iirc, tradition holds that Samuel was 39 years old when Eli died¹, aged 98(corroborated by <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3915966/jewish/Timeline-of-Jewish-History.htm#q5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this?</a>). Immediately after Samuel's introduced, we read of the wickedness of Eli's sons(1 Sam 2:11-17). God reinforces his this message through the child Samuel, so we know that the chronology's in order: Eli's sons were active priests in Samuel's early years, and therefore ~70 at their death. They clearly reached 'old age.'</p>\n<p>So what are we to make of 1 Samuel 2:31?</p>\n<p>EDIT: Abiathar's another descendant of Eli's that seems to've reached old age. He joined David at Adullam(1 Samuel 22:20–23) and was later desposed by Solomon(1 Kings 2:27).</p>\n<p>¹if the 20 years of 1 Samuel 7:2 span the time from the Ark's return(and Eli's death) to David's 7th year and Samuel died at 52, then he was 39 at the time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If you read the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.2.31?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_I_Samuel.2.31.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudos Dovid</a> there, he says the term \"זקן\" is not a reference to old age but actually a position of authority, and thus Hashem was telling him that no-one in his family would be installed into a position of power.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מהיות זקן. רצה לומר: מושל ושר, כי המושלים והשרים נקראו זקני העם</p>\n<p>There shall be no elder - this means to say a ruler and officer, because rulers and officers are called elders of the people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, whilst <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.2.31?lang=bi&p2=Radak_on_I_Samuel.2.31.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> mentions that it can mean literally \"old age\", he also notes that it can also be a reference to wisdom.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מהיות זקן. שימותו בחורים ורבו' פירשו חכם כמו והדרת פני זקן ר\"ל שלא יהיה מבית עלי סמוך בסנהדרין</p>\n<p>There shall be no elder - i.e. that they will die in their youth.

As it is stated with regard to the house of Eli: “And there shall not be an elder in your house forever” (I Samuel 2:32). The Gemara explains: What is the meaning of “elder” in this verse? If we say it means an actual elder, meaning an old person, but isn’t it already written: “And all those raised in your house shall die young men” (I Samuel 2:33)?

    "title": "Is it effective and is it kosher to perform the practice that leads to seed being spilled, but not actually spilling any?",
    "content": "# Is it effective and is it kosher to perform the practice that leads to seed being spilled, but not actually spilling any?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>That was a difficult title to figure out how to write! Well, here is the question. Spilling seed is a sin, but what about doing the same activity but stopping before spilling seed? The deeper reason I ask is that recently I heard of some non-Jewish mystical practices that supposedly involve performing this action, but turning the energy inward and back up the spinal cord, back up into the brain and the pineal gland to allegedly \"open the third eye,\" rather than letting it release outward. I'm not implying this has anything to do with Judaism, but like some other non-Jewish mystical teachings, it's clear some other aspects of their teachings share some similarities with Jewish mystical practices, and what I think is the crucial question in such instances is to learn in which ways they are different, and to clarify what is consistent with kosher practices, and what is made up or taken from non-kosher and potentially sinful practices. Jewish mystical practices can also involve the goal of spiritual ecstasy and awakening inner spiritual vision, but when it comes to this practice I'm asking about here, I have three questions:</p>\n<p>Are there authoritative sources that say such a practice even has the potential to work as advertised, or is this made up new age fake teachings?</p>\n<p>Either way, spiritually effective or not, is it kosher to do if no seed is spilled? (Not asking for me <em>or</em> a friend, lol, but just to learn the halachah. And for the record this was also not the easiest to write. Somehow my first draft of \"even if it's not good for anything at all, can I still do it just for fun, and is there a limit to how many times per hour?\" felt like it was still implying at least some degree of personal interest, rather than the strictly educational motive that is truthfully behind the question).</p>\n<p>What about the same practice, but doing it laying with your wife in the kosher way same as always, with the only difference being purposefully trying to redirect the energy back up the spinal cord rather than let any seed release? Would that be spiritually effective, and is it kosher to do in that case so long as you are still at other times attempting to fulfill the commandment to produce children?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>BH we have Mishlei 2 and 3 to save us from folly like this.</p>\n<p>The only appropriate use of this aspect of our neshama and guf is in the context of marital closeness and producing children. If it even is a true thing, which is highly doubtful given how quintessentially the yeiter hara is involved in this whole inyan, it will be highly destructive to a neshama because it will be a spiritual practice that feeds and is part of the impure forces of klipa (see chapters 7 and 8 of Tanya). It might also be some sort of divination or magical practice. Stay well away. [Plus I'm not sure the question of \"is this method X confirmed by Torah\" is considered appropriate for Mi Yodeya]</p>\n<p>The only <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/regulations-for-men/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">proof</a> needed to dispel the first part of the question is that halacha outrightly forbids a man from <strong>touching</strong> his limb, for the very reason he may come to spill seed. The only exception (maybe) is if one's wife is nearby and pure, and then the only exception is if it is an aid to going to the bathroom in a clean way, certainly no exceptions are made for practices that arouse a person!  See the links provided in the comments to your question, especially the one in Nidda.</p>\n<p>As for the second part, it shouldn't require any proof. It's clearly immoral to use one's wife as a tool (chas vechalila) for having a \"spiritual experience\", and even if she supports this, it goes against halacha and hashkafa. The halacha follows the principle of \"I am for my beloved, my beloved is for me\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.6.3?lang=bi&with=About&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir Hashirim 6:3</a>) that one is never out for selfish gain, but for the benefit of the other. Everything in the bedroom is leshem mitzva. The sources for this are easy to find.</p>\n<p>It goes against hashkafa because man is <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/531524/jewish/Lechah-Dodi-5689.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mashpia</a>, a giver. A man is meant to give, not receive. Receiving is feminine and damages a man's ability to be mashpia, and is grossly unholy. If one was never taught this, one is recommended <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSajHqqVuJGTugMZLtrsg5pwke6Og7QVQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this series</a>.</p>\n<p>As for your comment about spiritual ecstacy:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.2.10?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 2:10</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי־תָבוֹא חׇכְמָה בְלִבֶּךָ וְדַעַת לְנַפְשְׁךָ יִנְעָם</p>\n<p>For wisdom will enter your mind and knowledge will delight you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a lofty, holy of holies spiritual ecstasy, but it is from the ecstasy of Torah learning. There are many stories of great rabbonim losing all sense of space and time while in the sugya, while developing a chiddush or a ma'amar.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It should be noted that there are always people who have interests in this sort of thing and find examples in agadatta or midrash to back up their claims of strange practices (and I am not talking about the OP, who has demonstrated that they are not interested for personal reasons and we believe them) - there certainly is enough out-there material that can be misused by the untrained in agadic and midrashing learning. Please pay them no heed, or at the very least take whatever they say to your Rav and find out what da'at Torah has to say on the matter. The truth of Torah will always be something holy, pure and sweet and if it isn't then it can't be authentic as Shlomo says in chapter 3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דְּרָכֶ֥יהָ דַרְכֵי־נֹ֑עַם וְֽכָל־נְתִ֖יבוֹתֶ֣יהָ שָׁלֽוֹם׃</p>\n<p>Her ways are pleasant ways, And all her paths, peaceful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.19.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 19:8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תּ֘וֹרַ֤ת יְהֹוָ֣ה תְּ֭מִימָה מְשִׁ֣יבַת נָ֑פֶשׁ עֵד֥וּת יְהֹוָ֥ה\nנֶ֝אֱמָנָ֗ה מַחְכִּ֥ימַת פֶּֽתִי׃</p>\n<p>The teaching of the LORD is perfect, renewing life; the decrees of the\nLORD are enduring, making the simple wise;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and 10:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יִרְאַ֤ת יְהֹוָ֨ה ׀ טְהוֹרָה֮ עוֹמֶ֢דֶת לָ֫עַ֥ד מִֽשְׁפְּטֵי־יְהֹוָ֥ה\nאֱמֶ֑ת צָֽדְק֥וּ יַחְדָּֽו׃</p>\n<p>The fear of the LORD is pure, abiding forever; the judgments of the\nLORD are true, righteous altogether</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is highly advisable to learn a lot of Torah so these ideas penetrate our heart and such questions can never arise in the first place. Still, thanks for asking and allowing us to see how pleasant and pure the Torah's ways are.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.2.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 2:1-14</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּ֭נִי אִם־תִּקַּ֣ח אֲמָרָ֑י וּ֝מִצְוֺתַ֗י תִּצְפֹּ֥ן אִתָּֽךְ׃</p>\n<p>My son, if you accept my words And treasure up my commandments;</p>\n<p>לְהַקְשִׁ֣יב לַֽחָכְמָ֣ה אָזְנֶ֑ךָ תַּטֶּ֥ה לִ֝בְּךָ֗ לַתְּבוּנָֽה׃</p>\n<p>If you make your ear attentive to wisdom And your mind open to\ndiscernment;</p>\n<p>כִּ֤י אִ֣ם לַבִּינָ֣ה תִקְרָ֑א לַ֝תְּבוּנָ֗ה תִּתֵּ֥ן קוֹלֶֽךָ׃</p>\n<p>If you call to understanding And cry aloud to discernment,</p>\n<p>אִם־תְּבַקְשֶׁ֥נָּה כַכָּ֑סֶף וְֽכַמַּטְמוֹנִ֥ים תַּחְפְּשֶֽׂנָּה׃</p>\n<p>If you seek it as you do silver And search for it as for treasures,</p>\n<p>אָ֗ז תָּ֭בִין יִרְאַ֣ת יְהוָ֑ה וְדַ֖עַת אֱלֹהִ֣ים תִּמְצָֽא׃</p>\n<p>Then you will understand the fear of the LORD And attain knowledge of\nGod.</p>\n<p>כִּֽי־יְ֭הוָה יִתֵּ֣ן חָכְמָ֑ה מִ֝פִּ֗יו דַּ֣עַת וּתְבוּנָֽה׃</p>\n<p>For the LORD grants wisdom; Knowledge and discernment are by His\ndecree.</p>\n<p>יִצְפֹּ֣ן לַ֭יְשָׁרִים תּוּשִׁיָּ֑ה מָ֝גֵ֗ן לְהֹ֣לְכֵי תֹֽם׃</p>\n<p>He reserves ability for the upright And is a shield for those who live\nblamelessly,</p>\n<p>לִ֭נְצֹר אָרְח֣וֹת מִשְׁפָּ֑ט וְדֶ֖רֶךְ חֲסִידָ֣יו יִשְׁמֹֽר׃</p>\n<p>Guarding the paths of justice, Protecting the way of those loyal to\nHim.</p>\n<p>אָ֗ז תָּ֭בִין צֶ֣דֶק וּמִשְׁפָּ֑ט וּ֝מֵישָׁרִ֗ים כָּל־מַעְגַּל־טֽוֹב׃</p>\n<p>You will then understand what is right, just, And equitable—every good\ncourse.</p>\n<p>כִּֽי־תָב֣וֹא חָכְמָ֣ה בְלִבֶּ֑ךָ וְ֝דַ֗עַת לְֽנַפְשְׁךָ֥ יִנְעָֽם׃</p>\n<p>For wisdom will enter your mind And knowledge will delight you.</p>\n<p>מְ֭זִמָּה תִּשְׁמֹ֥ר עָלֶ֗יךָ תְּבוּנָ֥ה תִנְצְרֶֽכָּה׃</p>\n<p>Foresight will protect you, And discernment will guard you.</p>\n<p>לְ֭הַצִּ֣ילְךָ מִדֶּ֣רֶךְ רָ֑ע מֵ֝אִ֗ישׁ מְדַבֵּ֥ר תַּהְפֻּכֽוֹת׃</p>\n<p>It will save you from the way of evil men, From men who speak\nduplicity,</p>\n<p>הַ֭עֹ֣זְבִים אָרְח֣וֹת יֹ֑שֶׁר לָ֝לֶ֗כֶת בְּדַרְכֵי־חֹֽשֶׁךְ׃</p>\n<p>Who\nleave the paths of rectitude To follow the ways of darkness,</p>\n<p>הַ֭שְּׂמֵחִים לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת רָ֑ע יָ֝גִ֗ילוּ בְּֽתַהְפֻּכ֥וֹת רָֽע׃</p>\n<p>Who\nrejoice in doing evil And exult in the duplicity of evil men,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Could Solomon's wisdom be related to his downfall?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know that watching movies about biblical events does not always portray the reality of the event narrated in the Bible.</p>\n<p>There are several films about King Solomon and one of them implies that the cause of his decline was not foreign women, it was the excess of wisdom and the lack of goals, later triggering him to become attached to women as compensation, he built the temple but then I no longer knew how to have a purpose. And indeed it is quite strange how an individual with such intellectual capacity got to that state. Can too much wisdom get in the way of intuiting the human goal as something fleeting and without intrinsic value? Doing everything too fast can create idleness and prostration? Ecclesiastes would have been written in that state.</p>\n<p>That was basically the idea of the movie I watched, it seems to me that someone naive and uneducated can handle life better than someone with high knowledge and a lot of knowledge.</p>\n<p>In short, in Judaism is there this idea that an excess of wisdom or something that is good in principle even though it is good can be harmful to some extent? Would all the same good stuff have side effects?

And note, just as you have loopholes, so does the satan, and in the end, the satan has more knowledge and knows your true intent that can be used to expose your true motives keeping you short of your perceived garden of eden. The rationale mind will immediately draw conclusions, and stop going forward in a path that will ultimately make you suffer (as mentioned in the previous answer) and yes this applies to all, to chacham Yosef Dayan, to the Abuchatzera family, even a great cabalist and mathemation rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburg. And this is why they only pursue the path of the truth (Tiferet and malchut) and help others to achieve their truth from birth, as there can only be one truth (Likutay maharan) At times you will see them pray using their imaginative faculty in the brain that can be a form of art, though not the same as motivating heaven to pursue their perception of reality unless it already aligns with the supreme truth before their perception, I.E Helping a country become healthy moral, removing corruption from a place, or having new technology come to fruition, this is what can be a higher calling and these families are around to help a true calling be achieved.</p>\n\n\n",

I understand how to chant those signs, but I need more help in interpreting the difference in meaning.  Vayikra 14:19</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are four things to keep in mind.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>First, there are conjunctive and disjunctive trup symbols. Disjunctive divide up a phrase at the point they appear while conjunctive joins. Zakef gadol, tipcha and etnachtah are all disjunctive, usually. Mercha is conjunctive.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If a subphrase contains three words, it needs to be subdivided by a disjunctive trup.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>However, as William Wickes writes, sometimes a phrase with only two words, ending in either etnachta (mid-pasuk) or silluq (end-pasuk) will have a foretone of tipcha, for what are essentially musical concerns. Such a tipcha doesn't divide.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus, if we consider what Sefaria has for <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.14.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 14:19</a>, matching the Leningrad Code:\nוְכִפֶּ֕ר עַל־הַמִּטַּהֵ֖ר מִטֻּמְאָת֑וֹ is divided as:\nוְכִפֶּ֕ר || עַל־הַמִּטַּהֵ֖ר מִטֻּמְאָת֑וֹ\nand atone || for the one being purified of his defilement</p>\n<p>And the tipcha you see on al-hamitaher would be in a two-word phrase, and is simply musical.</p>\n<p>That was pasuk 19. As you mention (in the comment), Koren and Tikkun Simanim has mercha in place of zakef. That would make it:</p>\n<p>וְכִפֶּ֥ר עַל־הַמִּטַּהֵ֖ר מִטֻּמְאָת֑וֹ</p>\n<p>Then, there would be no pause on the first word, and the first and second would join together. And, even according to Wickes, the tipcha would function in its usual role of disjunctive accent. Thus:</p>\n<p>וְכִפֶּר עַל־הַמִּטַּהֵר || מִטֻּמְאָתוֹ\nand atone for the one being purified || of his defilement</p>\n<p>Thus, in the former, the action is \"atone\", and the object is \"the one being purified of his defilement\". In the latter, the action is \"atoning from defilement\" while the object is \"the one being purified\". The meaning of these two actions may be different.</p>\n<p>Please compare also the trup trees for <a href=\"http://www.mivami.org/trup/Leviticus%2014:19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 14:19</a> and (although it isn't the verse in question) <a href=\"http://www.mivami.org/trup/Leviticus%2014:53\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 14:53</a>. Though that doesn't treat the tipcha in a two word phrase as I described, it does give secondary treatment to tipcha over zakef.</p>\n\n\n",

The halachic devisors [poscim] who said, \"make your Shabbat as a weekday so that you do not rely on others,\" only said it regarding one in a time of dire need. Therefore [a person who has a bit of their own food, i.e. the initial situation discussed,] must practice restraint during the week so that he can honor the Shabbat. This is based on the decree of Ezra, that people should wash clothes on Thursday (i.e. prepare during the week) for the honor of Shabbat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The Rama does not address this point, so Ashkenazim are apparently on the same page.)</p>\n<p>Rav Melemed (Peninei Halkhah 1:12.3) is the earliest halachic source I could find that quotes Rabbi Yochanan. (That's someone alive today!) And he does so in particular with regard to Yom Tov, not Shabbos. I don't know why. Anyway, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנמצא בגרעון זמני, ראוי שיכנס למשיכת יתר בבנק או שיקח הלוואה כדי לשמוח בחג. ואל ידאג שמא תארע לו תקלה ולא יוכל להחזיר את חובו, ש\"אמר הקב\"ה לישראל: בָּנַי, לוו עלי וקדשו קדושת היום והאמינו בי ואני פורע\" (ביצה טו:). וזאת בתנאי שלא יסמוך על הנס, אלא שיש לו עסק מסודר או משכורת קבועה, או חסכון שעליו הוא יכול להישען. שעליו אמרו חכמים שלא ידאג שמא לא יצליח להחזיר את חובו, כי אם יעבוד בחריצות ולא יבזבז את כספו על מותרות, ה' יברך את מעשה ידיו ויסייע בידו לשלם את חובו. אבל מי שאינו יודע כיצד יחזיר את חובו, לא יקח הלוואה לצורכי החג, שלא יהיה רשע שאינו משלם את חובותיו. וגם לא יפשוט ידו לקבל צדקה, אלא יאכל בחג מאכלים פשוטים, וכפי שאמר רבי עקיבא: \"עשה שבתך חול ואל תצטרך לבריות\" (פסחים קיב.). ובזכות שלא יזדקק לבריות – יתעשר (פאה ח:ט). אמנם עני שכבר נאלץ לפשוט ידו לקבל צדקה לצרכים שונים, ייטול צדקה כדי לשמוח בחג (משנה ברורה רמב:א).</p>\n<p>If one finds himself with a temporary shortfall before a festival, it is appropriate for him to go into overdraft at the bank or to take out a loan, in order to enjoy the festival. He should not worry that something might go wrong and prevent him from repaying his debt. After all, God assured the Jews: “My children, borrow money on My behalf and sanctify the day; and believe in Me and I will repay” (Beitza 16b). This is on condition that one does not rely on a miracle, but rather has a stable business, regular income, or savings upon which he can draw. It is in such cases that the Sages say that one should not worry lest he be unable to repay the loan. As long as he works diligently and does not waste his money on luxuries, God will bless his efforts and help him pay off his debt. In contrast, one who does not know how he will repay a loan should not take one out to cover festival expenses, as people who borrow money and do not repay it are deemed wicked. He should not ask for charity either. Rather, he should eat simple foods on the festival, following R. Akiva’s dictum: “Turn Shabbat into a weekday rather than accepting charity” (Pesaḥim 112a). As a reward for not taking charity, he will become wealthy (Mishnah Pei’ah 8:9). In contrast, if one is already poor and must accept charity in any case, he should accept charity to cover festival expenses as well (MB 242:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would seem that in practice, we basically follow Rabbi Aciva. Rabbi Yochanan's words are limited to people who have every natural reason to believe they will get ahold of the money. You still have to make room in your weekly budget for Shabbos. Just don't be more thrifty, or even as thrifty about Shabbos expenses than when we want to treat ourselves in other ways.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I don't have a written source for you, just a maaseh that I personally somehow merited experiencing.</p>\n<p>The first few years I started doing teshuva, I was living in a remote location in a third world country with a very small Jewish population. If I wanted kosher wine, I had to order it by the case from an importer in the country's capital, and it would take about a week to arrive.</p>\n<p>One Sunday I noticed that I was down to my last bottle of wine. This was particularly problematic because due to the business I was running, I had accounts recieveable due in 30 days, but just enough to make payroll in the bank, and the wine had to be paid for in cash.</p>\n<p>I read that passuk somewhere in my limmud that week (by \"coincidence\" of course), and decided to put HKBH to the test (remember, this and maaser are the two ways we are permitted to test Him). I borrowed the amount needed (it came to something like US$ 186 at the then-current exchange rate) and ordered the wine.</p>\n<p>Two days later a client called me up and needed a small job done, and wouldn't you know that when we calculated how much it would cost, it came to....that exact same amount, $186. He then proposed to settle up right away.  בה, message recieved!</p>\n<p>This differs from the standard h.p. concerning our parnassah in that, as the gemarrah explains (I don't remember where), our income for the year is determined during the Yomim Noraim, but our spending for Shabbat and Yom Tov is outside of that. Meaning, if I was \"supposed\" to make $100,000 that year, the $186 I spent on wine was additional to that, pushing me up to $100,186.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where do we put the taggin on letters besides שעטנ״ז ג״ץ?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are different traditions as to on which letters to put the <em>taggin</em> (the crowns), but many old traditions include various specific letters that are not in שעטנ״ז ג״ץ (the letters that we generally crown today). For example, Rambam lists a bunch of letters to crown in <em>tefillin</em> (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Tefillin%2C_Mezuzah_and_the_Torah_Scroll.2.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MT Tefillin 2:9</a>) and the Tur gives another list for <em>tefillin</em> (see <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x103\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 36</a>).</p>\n<p>While I'm familiar with how we generally add three <em>taggin</em> to שעטנ״ז ג״ץ, are there traditional places on (the roof of) the other letters to put the <em>taggin</em>? What about שעטנ״ז ג״ץ when there are more than three <em>taggin</em>? More than examples of this being done, I'd prefer prescriptive statements in the <em>halachic</em> literature.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>All of these traditions are based upon the comment relayed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.29b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 29b</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב יהודה אמר רב בשעה שעלה משה למרום מצאו להקב\"ה שיושב וקושר כתרים לאותיות אמר לפניו רבש\"ע מי מעכב על ידך אמר לו אדם אחד יש שעתיד להיות בסוף כמה דורות ועקיבא בן יוסף שמו שעתיד לדרוש על כל קוץ וקוץ תילין תילין של הלכות\n§ Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: When Moses ascended on High, he found the Holy One, Blessed be He, sitting and tying crowns on the letters of the Torah. Moses said before God: Master of the Universe, who is preventing You from giving the Torah without these additions? God said to him: <strong>There is a man who is destined to be born</strong> after several generations, <strong>and Akiva ben Yosef is his name</strong>; he is destined to derive from each and every thorn of these crowns mounds upon mounds of halakhot. <strong>It is for his sake that the crowns must be added to the letters of the Torah</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These teachings of Rabbi Akiva were actually preserved and written down in a midrash called the letters and crowns of Rabbi Akiva. This midrash from Rabbi Akiva lists crowns for almost every letter in the Aleph-Beit and where in the text they are used and where specifically the crowns are to be placed. They are not used everywhere in the written Torah. In the places where they are added, it indicates a specific teaching or tradition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YkTUm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YkTUm.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>This Midrash was also preserved by the Rokeach, Rabbi Eliezer of Garmiza (<em>correctly pronounced Varmiza</em>) in his book, Sefer Kiryat S'far (<em>Book of the Border Town</em>).</p>\n<p>Like it explains in the introduction to the new re-issue mentioned below, this midrash is the source in numerous halachic texts on Sofrut like Ohr Zaruah, BaHag, Tur and Beit Yosef.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Cr2OI.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Cr2OI.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, only a small portion of those teachings remain with us today. But through the outstanding work of Zichron Aharon a much larger portion of that teaching has been republished.</p>\n<p>So to recap your questions, 1) Where do we put the taggin on letters besides שעטנ״ז ג״ץ? See Midrash HaTagin.</p>\n<p>2)Are there traditional places on (the roof of) the other letters to put the taggin? The short answer is yes, as taught by Rabbi Akiva in Midrash HaTagin.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>What about שעטנ״ז ג״ץ when there are more than three taggin? See the answer to number 2.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>...and your stated preference, \"I'd prefer prescriptive statements in the halachic literature.</p>\n<p>The specific answers to all three questions are detailed in the entire midrash. Copying the text of the entire midrash here seems excessive, but you can see a degraded version of it from the <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34929&st=&pgnum=30\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lemburg edition of Kiryat Sefer here</a>.</p>\n<p>Like it states in Menachot, these crowns are to be learned via Rabbi Akiva's teaching. They were added specifically to the letters of the Torah for him.</p>\n<p>It would be much more productive to obtain a copy of the re-issue from Zichron Aharon Publishers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VPcPS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VPcPS.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See yeriot shelomo of HaGaon HaRav Shlomo Mo'alem chapter 14 where he brings also the kol yaacov siman 36 oth 17 and also Sefer Minchat Solet (tikkun tefillin oth 30 pg 120 footnotes 497) who brings the zohar khadash(didn't mention source): The tzaddikim will stand with crowns upon their heads which are the Taggin pf the sefer torah which are בד\"ק חי\"ה  שעטנ\"ז ג\"ץ There he also brings that the taggin of בדק חיה needs to be like the letter zayin (meaning only one tag) see there. Its not at all likely to do other taggin than 3s and 1s and seen only upon the letters mentioned above. Thus brings the kol yaacov on oth 16 of siman 36 according to kabbalah.</p>\n\n\n",

In terms of the “what” to memorize, I am curious if there are any sources that describe whether there is something in particular this is good to memorize (I.e., Mishnayos, certain parts of Gemara?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First of all, it is important to remember that you'll need to not take a huge load upon yourself with regard to memorizing texts, as Rashi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Ecclesiastes.12.12.4?ven=The_Five_Megilloth,_English_translation_by_A._Cohen,_Soncino_Press,_1946&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and studying much is a weariness of the flesh And if he comes to memorize large amounts, more than the heart can grasp, that is weariness to man, but let one not say, “Since I cannot complete the work, why should I begin?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi's advice is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What you can, do, and let your heart be to Heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the sefer <a href=\"https://www.eshelpublications.com/store/p11/Orchos_Chaim%3A_Ben_Torah_For_Life.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Orchos Chaim: Ben Torah For Life\"</a>, Rabbi Aaron Lopiansky describes different goals of learning Torah (p. 153, Chapter 5 What to Learn):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To know that which is incumbent upon us to do;'</li>\n<li>To be inspired;</li>\n<li>To become intellectually engaged in Torah.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These three form the foundation of my answer to your question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am curious if there are any sources that describe whether there is\nsomething in particular this is good to memorize (I.e., Mishnayos,\ncertain parts of Gemara?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Certainly Halacha (Maybe start with learning Mishnayos by heart), since Rabbi Lopiansky writes: <em>\"The first reason is that without learning halachah, we will not perform the mitzvos properly [...]. Only by learning Halacha can we recognise an issue when we see it\"</em> (Ibid., p. 153).</p>\n<p>Rabbi Soloveitchik in his commentary on the Gemara, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Reshimot_Shiurim_on_Berakhot.2a.44?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Reshimos Shiurim\"</a> explains that the mitzvah of learning the Written Torah,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>obligates each person to memorize and recite the verses orally [in\norder to fulfill the mitzvah of learning the Written Torah.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to Rav Soloveitchik, memorizing pesukim in Torah is always a good idea to start off with.</p>\n<p>Based on Orchos Chaim by Rabbi Lopiansky, I would recommend memorizing the following sources (choose for yourself what is manageable and what not).</p>\n<p><strong>Halacha</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic Halachos without Mishnah Berurah (review it a few times, this will help memorizing it). <strong>For example: learn the halacha of Krias Shema or learn halacha of Shabbos</strong>;</li>\n<li>Mishnah Berurah (I would recommend learning the same halachos as you did in step 1);</li>\n<li>Shulchan Aruch and then learn the Rama;</li>\n<li>Chayei Adam.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please note</strong> that I am not saying you should memorize the whole of Shulchan Aruch. Rather, choose a topic that suits you. As one of my most favourite lessons in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.19a.5?ven=Daf_Shevui&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara</a> teaches us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi said: One can learn Torah only in a place which his heart\ndesires</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gemara</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose a perek in Gemara and learn it thoroughly <strong>with</strong> the commentary of Rashi;</li>\n<li>If you are fluent in Rashi and that Gemara, you can choose to memorize that particular Tosfos on that Gemara you've learned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the best advices Rabbi Lopiansky gives, is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Choose material to learn that can be clearly defined. This might be a perek in Shas, an area of Halachah, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to this, I would like to end this answer with some great piece of advice from the Ramak (Moshe Kordovero), in his work <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_Neerav%2C_PART_III.3.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Or Neerav\"</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The reader should approach these books in two ways. <strong>First</strong> of all, he should review the texts many times, making notes in order to remember [his] studies fluently. He should not delve too deeply at first. <strong>Secondly</strong>, he should study the material with great concentration according to his ability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Steipler Gaon responds in a letter send to him (Karyana D'Igarta; letter titled כל ת\"ח מוכרח ללמוד כל חלקי התורה ) that the main goal of the mitzvah of learning Torah, is to delve deeply into a subject, so that at the end of your study, you'll be able to give instructions in that matter. Let's say you are learning Berachos, then you'll be able to respond to matters regarding berachos at the end of your studies. That is how one should approach his studies.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Modern application of avoiding Gentile idolatry",
    "content": "# Modern application of avoiding Gentile idolatry\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The children of Israel were commanded not to join with the Canaanites nor to learn their ways, lest they be led astray from the pure worship of Hashem into worshipping the idols of the nations. (Exodus 34:11-16, Joshua 23:7, Jeremiah 10:2)</p>\n<p>Much of the world today does not worship statues or false deities but rather idols not associated with religions such as money, fame, and power. Along with the rest of creation, we were created for Hashem's glory (Isaiah 43:7, Psalm 19:1) and to give Him praise (Isaiah 43:21). Instead of putting Hashem in the center of their lives, seeking to give Him glory by obeying His commands from hearts of praise, the world lives for their own glory and praise, putting themselves in the place of Hashem as their object of worship, effectively becoming their own idols. Hashem has said, \"My glory I will not give to another.\" (Isaiah 48:11). It has historically not gone well for those who gave themselves glory instead of Hashem. (Daniel 4: Nebuchadnezzar was made to eat grass like a beast for boasting in himself!)</p>\n<p>Can we apply the commands for keeping separate from the Gentiles and their idols to these non-religious idols of our day such as money, fame, power, self-worship? As returning to obey Hashem required destruction of physical idols (i.e., Jeroboam's golden calves atop the high places), does modern-day obedience to these commands include uprooting these idols from our hearts and lives?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In a figurative sense, everyone should always think about what are the driving forces in their lives and whether they align with God's will. Rabbi Joseph Soloveichik famously stated that any absolute loyalty to an \"-ism\" can become its own <em>figurative</em> idolatry if it goes beyond loyalty to God. (While it was omitted from some transcripts, he included unquestioned fealty to the State of Israel as one possible concern.)</p>\n<p><em>PRACTICALLY</em> -- and here's what keeps us away from extremism: it was easy to say \"don't have idols in your house, don't make idols, even if you don't plan to worship them.\" We follow the LAWS we were given. It's not our place to create new ones.</p>\n<p>But to say \"ban all honor?\" \"Destroy all money?\" That sure wasn't, and still isn't, in the Torah. The Talmud says poverty is a terrible thing; it sure is not noble. We have the much harder task of figuring out what extent is appropriate. The rabbinic leadership of the medieval era made local policies about how big or expensive a party was allowed to be. Contemporary rabbis tried such a detailed policy about 20 years ago, and it got nowhere. Instead, however, they can continue to preach about \"please think through this carefully, and make good choices.\"</p>\n<p>PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE: Do not go destroying stuff and claiming that's what the Torah told you to do.</p>\n\n\n",

Which Rashi says \"Yosef was able to carry Ephraim and Menashe on his knees before giving them to Yaakov\"?</p>\n<p>There are two places knees are mentioned that I can tell. The first is Bereishit 48:12:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיּוֹצֵ֥א יוֹסֵ֛ף אֹתָ֖ם מֵעִ֣ם בִּרְכָּ֑יו וַיִּשְׁתַּ֥חוּ לְאַפָּ֖יו אָֽרְצָה׃\nJoseph then removed them from his knees, and bowed low with his face to the ground.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויוצא יוסף אתם. לְאַחַר שֶׁנְּשָׁקָם הוֹצִיאָם יוֹסֵף מֵעִם בִּרְכָּיו, כְּדֵי לְיַשְּׁבָם זֶה לַיָּמִין וְזֶה לַשְּׂמֹאל לִסְמֹךְ יָדָיו עֲלֵיהֶם וּלְבָרְכָם:\nויוצא יוסף אתם AND JOSEPH BROUGHT THEM OUT — After he (Jacob) had kissed them, Joseph brought them out from between his knees in order to place them one at the right and the other on the left in order that Jacob might thus lay his hands upon them and bless them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That isn't necessarily that he was carrying them on his knees, or that they were sitting on his lap. He could be sitting down, and they could be standing or sitting in front of his spread knees. Or, more figuratively, from in front of him.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.50.23?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">50:23</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּ֤רְא יוֹסֵף֙ לְאֶפְרַ֔יִם בְּנֵ֖י שִׁלֵּשִׁ֑ים גַּ֗ם בְּנֵ֤י מָכִיר֙ בֶּן־מְנַשֶּׁ֔ה יֻלְּד֖וּ עַל־בִּרְכֵּ֥י יוֹסֵֽף׃\nJoseph lived to see children of the third generation of Ephraim; the children of Machir son of Manasseh were likewise born upon Joseph’s knees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>על ברכי יוסף. כְּתַרְגּוּמוֹ גִּדְּלָן בֵּין בִּרְכָּיו:\nעל ברכי יוסף [WERE BORN] ON JOSEPH’S KNEES — The meaning is as the Targum gives it: He brought them up upon his knees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our Onkelos, by the way, translates the earlier וַיּוֹצֵא יוֹסֵף אֹתָם, מֵעִם בִּרְכָּיו as וְאַפֵּיק יוֹסֵף יָתְהוֹן, מִן קֳדָמוֹהִי, that he took them from before him.

The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.93.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Bereishis Rabbah (93:7)</a> records the epic battle between Yosef and Yehuda when each displayed their powerful strength. In fact, Yosef kicked a stone pillar and turned it into a pile of pebbles:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מֶה עָשָׂה יוֹסֵף בְּאוֹתָהּ שָׁעָה אוֹתוֹ עַמּוּד שֶׁל אֶבֶן שֶׁהָיָה\nיוֹשֵׁב עָלָיו בָּעַט בּוֹ וַעֲשָׂאוֹ גַּל שֶׁל צְרוֹרוֹת, מִיָּד\nתָּמַהּ יְהוּדָה וְאָמַר זֶה גִּבּוֹר מִמֶּנִּי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Yosef could smash a huge pillar, he could probably carry his two sons.</p>\n\n\n",

What did he bring as his offering? He brought only the leftovers of his meal. However, the rabbis maintained that Cain brought flaxseed, while Abel brought firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof (ibid., v. 4). That is why it is ordained that wool and flax must not be mixed, as it is said: Thou shalt nor wear mingled stuff, wool and linen together (Deut. 22:11).31</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The main point of these commentaries is that Cain brought the poorest type(s) of produce, as the Rabbeinu Bahya <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.4.3.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>. The lesson the Torah gives us that when offering something to G-d, in worshipping G-d, we should not be avarice. This verse shows us Cains stinginess, and that that is not what G-d asks of us.</p>\n<p>I would like to share with you the insight of the Be'er Yosef, written by Rav Yosef Tzvi Salant. The edition I share is the recently published sefer called: <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/be-er-yosef\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Be'er Yosef Selected Writings Of Rav Yosef Tzvi Salant Adapted Into English</a>, by Rabbi Refael Wolfe. In Parashas Bereishis, the Be'er Yosef writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kayin decided to bring an offering to Hashem. He brought from the worst of the fruit of his land. Hevel was also inspired to bring an offering. Unlike his brother, he brought the best of his cattle [...] <strong>If you do not make the effort, you will move downward.</strong> (Translation by Rabbi Wolfe)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Some insight on the matter, due to Rabbi Joseph Albo, from 15th-century Spain, is that before the Flood people believed humans and animals were on the same level.  Therefore, they believed that they, too, were not responsible for their actions. Cain offered God grain, while Abel offered God animals, because Cain believed animals were equal to humans and so he had no right to kill them for offerings.  When he saw that God accepted Abel’s animals, he concluded he could also kill Abel, which he did.[Sefer ha-Ikkarim 3:15]</p>\n\n\n",

Are there any ספרים that discuss this?\nI realized the problem is not that I can't concentrate, I manage to study for hours without losing concentration. The problem is that I don't know how to approach Tefila. This is probably a large topic. Recommended Sefarim would be great, if there are any.\nFor example, what was the Chazon Ish working so hard at during his Tefila. It can't be just concentrating on the words. The words of Tefila have no meaning unless we place them in some sort of mental framework.\nI hope my question is clear.\nThanks</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is a very important question, but I think you are phrasing it wrong. Let me answer in a way that is a little too strong, for clarity:<br />\nYou are not supposed to think of anything when you are davening. You are supposed to be <em>talking</em>, speaking to G-d. Or sometimes, speaking <em>before</em> him.<br />\nWhen you say \"Hello!\" to your wife, you do not think,<br />\n\"hello [ he-<strong>loh</strong>, huh-, hel-<strong>oh</strong> ], <em>interjection</em> - a sprightly greeting\".<br />\nYou speak English, and that is all included in what you do and feel when you say it.<br />\nBefore the Anshei Knesses Hagedolah came along to establish our fixed prayers, this is how everyone prayed. They asked G-d for things they needed, they thanked him for his help, they praised him for his wonders. On the simplest level, there was no way for them to pray without kavannah; they said what they wanted to say.<br />\nNow the Anshei Knesses Hagedolah have given us better, profoundly deeper wordings for all our prayers. They have also introduced the possibility of saying them by rote. But it does not need to be that way.<br />\nSometimes I write down what I want to say ahead of time, to be sure I say it properly. They are still my words.<br />\nSometimes my friend helps me out, writing down what I should say, and I read that. They are still my words, still reflect what I am trying to say.<br />\nSometimes I don't even <em>speak the language</em>, but they are still my words! I want to say those things, but I don't know how. Hashem, this is what I would say, if I could. David Hamelech said it so well, please take his profound words as if they were mine. This was the way of so many of our bubbies in the old country, who would wet their Tehillims with their tears though they spoke only Yiddish and could not have translated a word.</p>\n<p>When I am in the middle part of the Amidah, I am asking Hashem for the help we all need.\nWhen I am saying Pesukei D'zimrah, I am standing before a great king, singing his praises. At the last part of the Amidah, I am thanking him for hearing me out, and so often helping me.<br />\nWhen I say Shema, I am not speaking to Hashem. Rather, I am listening, standing before him reading <em>his words</em> from the Torah, sincerely reciting a Pledge of Allegiance that we always recite at the beginning and end of our day, and that our sages decreed should be said before we dare to stand before him.<br />\nWhen I listen to Chazaras Hashatz, I always imagined that I am a person who came as part of a group who went to the king, politely attentive to our representative as he lists our prayers. But I saw that the Yesod V'shoresh Ha'avodah says that I should imagine as if I am saying the prayers myself, so I'm not sure about that.<br />\nWe are always talking to Hashem, or before him, but there are many different roles.<br />\nCertainly, in any of these, I will not keep checking my watch, or think about something else while I'm rattling off my list. That would be a whole different kind of conversation, with my wife or with Hashem. Not the kind that brings anyone closer.</p>\n<p>Chazal gave us various ways to help us picture properly what we are doing. For instance, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.31b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Brachos 31b</a> it says that one should not pray in a casual way, but like a poor man begging for a crust of bread so that he shouldn't starve; he will maybe ask more strenuously than is completely polite because he is desperate. And other such ways: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yesod_V%27Shoresh_HaAvodah?tab=contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yesod V'shoresh Ha'avodah</a> has hundreds of them from one end of our avodah to the other, indicating what we are doing as we say each individual part.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>By way of introduction, the starting point is to have an awareness of whom you are praying before. If you can channel the mindset that you are standing before the Divine Presence it helps to provide a much greater level of awareness that helps you find a state of clarity when praying. It is this starting point that helps clear the mind so that you can concentrate and think about what you are saying.</p>\n<p>Rambam on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.4.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tefillah & bircas Kohanim 4:16</a> (worthwhile looking at the whole chapter) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כֵּיצַד הִיא הַכַּוָּנָה. שֶׁיְּפַנֶּה אֶת לִבּוֹ מִכָּל הַמַּחֲשָׁבוֹת וְיִרְאֶה עַצְמוֹ כְּאִלּוּ הוּא עוֹמֵד לִפְנֵי הַשְּׁכִינָה. לְפִיכָךְ צָרִיךְ לֵישֵׁב מְעַט קֹדֶם הַתְּפִלָּה כְּדֵי לְכַוֵּן אֶת לִבּוֹ וְאַחַר כָּךְ יִתְפַּלֵּל בְּנַחַת וּבְתַחֲנוּנִים וְלֹא יַעֲשֶׂה תְּפִלָּתוֹ כְּמִי שֶׁהָיָה נוֹשֵׂא מַשּׂאוֹי וּמַשְׁלִיכוֹ וְהוֹלֵךְ לוֹ. לְפִיכָךְ צָרִיךְ לֵישֵׁב מְעַט אַחַר הַתְּפִלָּה וְאַחַר כָּךְ יִפָּטֵר. חֲסִידִים הָרִאשׁוֹנִים הָיוּ שׁוֹהִין שָׁעָה אַחַת קֹדֶם תְּפִלָּה וְשָׁעָה אַחַת לְאַחַר תְּפִלָּה וּמַאֲרִיכִין בִּתְפִלָּה שָׁעָה</p>\n<p>What is meant by [proper] intention? One should clear his mind from all thoughts and envision himself as standing before the Divine Presence. Therefore, one must sit a short while before praying in order to focus his attention and then pray in a pleasant and supplicatory fashion. One should not pray as one carrying a burden who throws it off and walks away. Therefore, one must sit a short while after praying, and then withdraw. The pious ones of the previous generations would wait an hour before praying and an hour after praying. They would [also] extend their prayers for an hour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The next step is to understand what you are saying. Numerous sefarim speak about פירוש המילים - explaining the words. If you find some time to learn some of the tefillos, translating the words (or purchase a siddur with translation / interlinear formatting) it will allow you to also concentrate more as you have more of an awareness as to what you are saying.</p>\n<p>With this in mind we can now hone in on what actually to think about. The shemoneh esrei is a good starting point with specific areas to focus on whether it be wisdom, health, moshiach etc.</p>\n<p>The first answer has listed some of the classic seforim that explore kavanna by tefilla but there are also a lot of amazing English seforim that will help in this regard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rabbi Heshy Kleinman has a whole Artscroll series entitled <em>Praying with Fire</em> (<a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422600153.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol. 1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422608555.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol. 2</a>)</li>\n<li>The invaluable series entitled <em><a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/pathway-to-prayer+edition-Weekday%7EAmidah%7EAshkenaz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pathway to Prayer</a></em> by Rabbi Mayer Birnbaum - has translations and explanation as you read through the tefilla.</li>\n<li>Rav Shimshon Dovid Pincus, <em><a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/gates-of-prayer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gates of Prayer</a></em></li>\n<li>Rabbi Elie Munk, <em><a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/the-world-of-prayer-2-vols-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The World of Prayer</a></em></li>\n<li>Rabbi Noson Weisz, <em><a href=\"https://judaicaplaza.com/collections/vendors?q=Rabbi%20Noson%20Weisz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prayer Works</a></em></li>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578195121.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Shwab on Prayer</a></em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This problem of Davening is not a unique problem.

(For simplicity, I\nassume the oven is regularly used for meat.)</p>\n<p>(a) The oven must be clean of any meaty spills. If the oven was not\nchecked and cleaned beforehand, the pareve may not be eaten together\nwith dairy, but it may be eaten immediately before or after (even in\nthe same meal, but the hands should be washed before switching).</p>\n<p>(b) Even if the oven is clean, if it was used to cook liquidy\nuncovered meat within the past 24 hours and the pareve is also liquidy\nand uncovered, then it may not be eaten together with dairy but can be\nright before or after.</p>\n<p>(c) If the oven is clean and has not been used within 24 hours with\nliquidy uncovered meat, liquidy pareve foods should not be cooked in\nit in order to eat them together with dairy, but if they were cooked,\nthey may be eaten together with dairy.</p>\n<p>Note that Sephardic Jews are more lenient with such indirect tastes of\nmeat and milk (based on Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 95:1-2).

In the case of water that is already in the pipes, if you turn on the cold water, no hot water is leaving the hot water heater (since you only turned the cold water tap), so no cold water will enter the hot water heater to replace it, hence there is no issue with using the tap on Shabbos, even if there is still hot water in the pipes.</p>\n\n\n",

And he said, Here I am.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was thinking of something familiair. In Sefer Shmuel, we read that G-d tries to call Shmuel, but <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.3.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel did not know of G-d yet, neither was His word revealed to him</a>. Only after the fourth time, Shmuel <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.3.8-10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">knew</a> it was G-d who was calling him, and not Eli.</p>\n<p>So this got me thinking.</p>\n<p>Besides the fact that the angel of the L-rd appeared to Moshe, how did Moshe know who was calling him? When G-d calls him twice (v.4), Moshe immediately responds <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.3.4?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%83%20And%20when%20the%20Lord%20saw%20that%20he%20turned%20aside%20to&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">with</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֥אמֶר הִנֵּֽנִי\nAnd he said: Here I am</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What was different here, in comparison to when G-d tried to call Shmuel, but Shmuel did not know that it was G-d calling him?</p>\n<p>--------------------------------- My own thoughts, that might help----------</p>\n<p>Maybe the main difference is that Moshe Rabbeinu was interested into the fact that the bush was burning. He knew that there was some greater power doing that, and wanted to find out why. As the Sforno explains, the principle of הבא לטהר מסיין אותו applies here. So, you would say this would set apart Moshe Rabbeinu in that sense from Shmuel. However, The Shelah says that when Hannah says: זרע אנשים, it means that that she asked for a son who would combine within himself the virtues of Moshe and Aharon. In Tehillim 99:6, Moshe and Aharon are compared to Shmuel.</p>\n<p>The Shelah goes on to say that Moses in his closeness to G–d had concentrated almost exclusively on devoting himself to G–d. Aharon, on the other hand, concentrated on the virtue of \"peace.\" He was always busy pursuing peace, trying to restore harmonious relations between husband and wife, etc. So what about Shmuel? The Shelah says: The prophet Samuel concentrated on practising the two outstanding virtues of both Moshe and Aharon. - so, according to this explanation, Shmuel possesed virtues of both Moshe and Aharon. This makes it difficult for me to understand why Shmuel was not able to recognise that it was G-d calling him, but Moshe Rabbeinu was able to do that right away.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Short answer is in Derech Hashem 3:3:1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hashem decreed further [than natural intelligence] that a much higher\nintellect than this should be made available to him [man] - this is\nthe intellect that is given...from Hashem through one of the conduits\nthat He has prepared for this; and when that <em>shefa</em> reaches his mind, a\nspecific type of knowledge will be established in him with clarity,\nfree of uncertainty and error.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is just <em>ruach hakodesh</em>. Basically, this type of knowledge has it's own route, and sensation that is immediately recognisable as such, without any confusion.</p>\n<p>As for prophecy, he writes (ibid 4):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...he will literally attain a state of <em>dvekut</em> to [Hashem], in such a\nmanner that he will sense the <em>dvekut</em>. He will then perceive that to\nwhich he has attained <em>dvekut</em>: which is the Glory of Hashem... He will\nperceive them clearly, in the manner of <em>shefa</em> of intellect that we\nhave mentioned above, but with greater strength than one who possesses\n<em>ruach hakodesh</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore (ibid 5:4):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That is, it becomes clear to him that the One Who is revealing Himself\nand making Himself known to him is the Creator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this chapter he goes on to describe the prophecy of Moshe, which was free of all riddle, darkening or lack of consciousness, or set times of prophecy, or set <em>amounts</em> of prophecy, like other forms of prophecy of which the above is said. There are a lot more fascinating details in these chapters and I strongly recommend DH 3:3-5.</p>\n<p><strong>In a nutshell, is it really a surprise that when we encounter Hashem personally and openly, that we recognise Him and don't confuse Him for someone else? That's impossible!</strong></p>\n<p>As for Moshe's and Shmuel's first prophetic moments, Ramchal states (3:4:3):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נבואה בלתי ניכרת: והנה אפשר שיגיע גילוי ממנו ית׳‎ אל אדם והוא לא יכיר\nבו כמו שיכיר הנביא אלא יחשבהו כא׳‎ מן המורגשות עד שיגבר עליו השפע\nהנבואיי ואז יכיר הענין כמות שהוא באמת. ומן המין הזה היתה קריאת ה׳‎\nלשמואל שלא התנבא מתחלה ולא שפע עליו השפע אלא שנגלה עליו קול כקול מורגש\nולא השיג בזה יותר אבל אח״כ שפע עליו השפע והכיר והשיג הנבואה בדרכיה.\nוכן מראת הסנה למשה בתחלה לא נגלה לו אלא כמורגשות וראה הסנה בוער באש\nוהקב״ה קראו בקולו של אביו אך אח״כ שפע עליו השפע והשיג הנבואה לאמתה:</p>\n<p>Unrecognized prophecy: But note that it is possible that a revelation\ncome from Him, may He be blessed, and that one not recognize it as a\nprophet would recognize it, but rather think of it [as coming from] a\nperceivable source - until the prophetic influence [later] overpower\nhim, and he then recognize the matter for what it truly was. And God's\ncall to Samuel (I Samuel 3) was of this type: He did not prophesy at\nfirst nor did the [divine] influence come upon him. Rather a voice\nlike a perceivable voice was revealed to him, and he did not grasp\nanything more. But later the influence came upon him and he recognized\nand grasped the prophecy and its ways. And likewise, the vision of the\nbush to Moses (Exodus 3) at the beginning was only revealed as\nsomething perceivable. So he saw the bush burning in flames, and the\nHoly One, blessed be He, called him with the voice of his father. But\nafterwards, He brought the influence upon [Moses] and he grasped the\ntruth of the prophecy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, these moments weren't really prophetic, but just revelations of something perceivable to the normal human senses, orchestrated by Hashem in order to prepare for the upcoming genuine prophecy (which then retroactively proved to them that the previous experiences did contain some hidden prophecy)</p>\n\n\n",

Since any\npaper upon which G-d's name was written might be discarded and thus\n\"erased\", the Rabbis forbade explicitly writing the name of G-d,\nexcept in Holy Books, with provisions for the proper disposal of such\nbooks.</p>\n<p>According to Jewish Folklore, G-d has 70 names. However, only one of\nthese names is the ineffable name, which cannot be erased or\npronounced. Further, of the 70 names, seven may not be erased but they\ncan be pronounced on certain occasions (such as when reading the\nTorah). The other names may be erased and pronounced, but still must\nbe treated with respect. The Talmud (Shevuot 35a-b) makes it clear\nthat this prohibition applies only to seven Biblical names of G-d and\nnot to other names or attributes of G-d, which may be freely written.\nThe prohibition was later codified by Maimonides (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904982/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Six.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah,\nYesodei HaTorah 6:1-2</a>). The practice of writing \"G-d\" is supported in\nShut Achiezer, 3:32, end, where it is endorsed and accepted as the\nprevailing custom. Rambam cites Deut. 12-03:04, which states \"and you\nshall destroy the names of pagan gods from their places. You shall not\ndo similarly to G-d your Lord.\" The intent of this is to create an\natmosphere of respect for G-d's name vs pagan gods' names.</p>\n<p>As a result of this, people acquired the habit of not writing the full\nname down in the first place. Strictly speaking, this only\napplies to Hebrew on a permanent medium, but many people are\ncareful beyond the minimum, and have applied it to non-Hebrew\nlanguages. Hence, \"G-d\". One explanation is that using G-d is a\nreminder that anything which we may say about G-d is necessarily\nmetaphorical. Spelling out the Name (even in a language other than\nHebrew) would imply that one could speak meaningfully (not just\nmetaphorically) about G-d.</p>\n<p>However, the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%22%D7%9A_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A7%D7%A2%D7%98#%D7%A1%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A3_%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shach (Yoreh De'a 179:11)</a> ruled that \"God\" spelled in a\nforeign language does NOT have the status of a \"shem\" and thus\nmay be erased, lehatkhila. There is a story about Rav Soloveitchik\n(z\"l) intentionally writing GOD on the board while teaching a class\nand then just as deliberately and intentionally erasing it, so as\nto demonstrate by his own example that this was not a halakhically\na problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

At the same time, Rav Mendel Blachman added that we DO recognize that Moshe too, had a family in Parshas Voera so that we can know that we too, can have greatness to us as well.

A nation does not only require\nleaders, it requires the Hamon Am – the regular members of the nation\nprepared to assume their respective roles in creating the nation even\nif it is without major fanfare.

He walked in the ways of the Levites, as the Be'er Mayim Chaim says. The Torah saw a need to stress out that Moshe came from this \"man from the House of Levi\", e.g. the future redeemer of B'nei Yisrael, came from a family that kept the Torah, even in Mitzrayim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here's the dvar Torah a Rav (Rabbi David Baadani) just sent me באחד מספריו של הרב פינקוס זצ\"ל, which is along the lines of the shiurim brought by Shmuel in his answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Torah teaches us an important lesson here.

    "content": "# Why did Hashem wait 2000+ years to give the Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I think the question is self explanatory: Why wait so long?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Welcome to Mi Yodeya and may I say, excellent first question!</p>\n<p>Pesachim 118a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The psalmist (136) sings, \"Give thanks to God, for His kindness is\neternal\" twenty-six times. Why so many? <strong>Because there were 26\ngenerations of the world until the Torah was given, during which time\nGod supported the world only with kindness.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we can see, your question is good, without the Torah being given, Hashem had to support the world with only kindness, obviously not ideal.</p>\n<p>It says (ibid 68b):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The world exists only for the sake of the Torah</strong>. If Torah would cease to be studied, the world would cease to exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On that latter point, Reb Chaim writes in Nefesh HaChayim (4:11):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If, at any time, for even a moment, Torah would cease to be studied\neverywhere, the world would instantly come to an end, for the world\nconstantly survives on the Torah that is studied at that moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So why didn't Hashem give the Torah right away? The answer is because the Torah is meant to be accepted by Yisrael, with free will. Free will is an essential part of the Plan, and Torah, because without it, the mitzvot are meaningless, as Rambam writes (Hilchot Teshuva 5):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every person has the ability to lead a good life and be a <em>tzaddik</em> or\nto lead an evil life and be a <em>rasha</em>... This is a fundamental concept\nunderlying the whole Torah and its mitzvot. Moshe said (Nitzavim,\nD'varim 30:15), \"Look, I have put before you today a choice of life\nand good or death and evil.\" He said as well (Re'eh, D'varim\n11:26-28), \"See, I put before you today blessings and curses;\nblesdsings if you obey... and curses if you do not obey God's\nmitzvot...\" In other words, you have the ability to choose between all\ntypes of human ac tion, whether good or bad... <strong>If this were not so\nwhat place would there be for the Torah; with what justice could God\npunish the <em>rasha</em> or reward the <em>tzaddik</em> if each does not have perfectly\nfree will to choose his own path?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hashem grants us free will and therefore waited until the time was right.</strong></p>\n<p>The following difficult passage in Chagiga 13b-14a illustrates this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A river of fire starts to flow before God's throne.\" (Daniel 7:10) To\nwhere does the river flow? It pours onto the heads of the wicked in\nGehinom. Who are they? They are the 974 generations that were plucked\nbefore the creation of the world and not created.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi says that God had originally intended to make 1000 generations and give the Torah to the 1000th, but he skipped to the 974th, and gave the Torah to Moshe after 26 more generations, and consigned the 974 wicked generations He never created to <em>gehinom</em>.</p>\n<p>It says in Bereshit Rabba (3:7):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon notes that the Torah (Bereshit 1:5) says of the\nfirst day of creation, \"It became evening and it became morning; one\nday.\" The <em>pasuk</em> does not say that God announced, \"There shall be an\nevening; there shall be a morning; these will constitute one day.\" It\nsimply says, \"It became evening.\" That shows that the progression of\ntime pre-existed the creation. How so? Rabbi Abohu explains that <strong>this\nworld was not the first world to be created</strong>. Rather, God created many\nworlds one after the other and destroyed each successively. He said,\n\"I don't like this one; I don't like that one,\" until this world was\ncreated, when He said, \"This one pleases Me.\" That is indicated by the\n<em>pasuk</em> (ibid. 31), \"Behold, it is very good,\" indicating this world is very good. The previous worlds were not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In light of Bamidbar 23:19 <em>God is not a man who falsifies, nor human, and changes His mind; does He say and not do, or speak and not fulfill?</em> and Shmuel 1:15:29 <em>God, who gives victory to Yisrael, does not lie nor change His mind, for He is not a man to vacillate</em>, how could the midrash even stomach to speak about Hashem having made worlds and then changing His mind because He didn't like them? The answer is what we have already stated. He requires free will in His Plan, and therefore the giving of the Torah could only happen on our consent, which He doesn't force.</p>\n<p>Therefore, getting from the beginnings of His plan to the giving of the Torah was inevitably going to take time. There would be mistakes and even people who were never created because He knew in advance they would not accept the Torah, as the Zohar states very explicitly (Bereshit 25a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God created successive worlds and destroyed them; those that would not\nkeep the mitzvot of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hashem set 1000 generations for A to B, and it ended up taking 26. The joy, the relief, the amazing day when Avraham's descendants, who earned the name Yisrael, used their precious free will to choose to accept Hashem and His Torah, is recounted in Shemot 19:8:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The people together responded and said, \"All that God said we will\ndo,\" and Moshe brought back the words of the people to God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can take from all this that the giving of the Torah is very precious and important to Hashem, is something that we are responsible for, and we must keep it wholeheartedly - the whole world depends on it, and matters infinitely to Him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Welcome to the forum.<br />\nIn short: Just like our forefathers worked out the Torah from the world and tradition as were we. The Jews as they left Eygpt no longer could rely on this so at that point he gave the Torah. The point is <strong>we were never supposed to receive the Torah</strong> it was a must.\nI recommend listening to this podcast <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/18forty-podcast/rabbi-meir-triebitz-how-should-we-approach-the-science-of-the-torah-science-44\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://player.fm/series/18forty-podcast/rabbi-meir-triebitz-how-should-we-approach-the-science-of-the-torah-science-44</a> Rabbi Tribetz explains based on the Medrash Tanchuma. He says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is true that the underlying, the Torah, which is min hashamayim, so\non the underlying basis, right?</p>\n<p>David Bashevkin:</p>\n<p>From heaven, I’m sorry if I interlude with some brief translations.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Meir Triebitz:</p>\n<p>That’s okay. Right. At the end of Mishpatim, the Torah speaks about\nthat Moshe Rabbeinu came, and to give the Torah to Klal Yisrael,\nright?</p>\n<p>David Bashevkin:</p>\n<p>The Jewish people, yes.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Meir Triebitz:</p>\n<p>The Jewish people, and the Jewish people had a tremendous vision. A\ntremendous vision. The Torah describes there a tremendous vision they\nhave, kavayachol of a tremendous metaphysical vision. And then, it\nsays, but Hakadosh Baruch Hu, as not to upset the joy of that day,\nthere were certain people who looked at it b’lev gas, meaning that\nthey were eating and drinking, and they didn’t take it, I guess, with\nthe appropriate seriousness that it required. So Hakadosh Baruch Hu\nsays to Moshe Rabbeinu, “Aley elay hahara” –</p>\n<p>David Bashevkin:</p>\n<p>Come up on the mountain.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Meir Triebitz:</p>\n<p>Mountain, right, and I will give you, and the pasuk says ” Es luchos\nha’even v’haTorah v’hamitzvah asher kasavti lehorosam”. I will give\nyou the Torah. Now in Gemara on daf hey amud alef, in Brachos, the\nGemara there says that what is this pasuk referring to? So the Gemara\nsays that it’s referring to the luchos ha’even, which is the two\ntablets, it’s referring to the Mishna, it’s referring to Nevi’im and\nKesuvim, and it’s referring to the Gemara.</p>\n<p>David Bashevkin:</p>\n<p>It’s all there.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Meir Triebitz:</p>\n<p>However, what’s interesting is, what happened. In other words, at\nfirst they had this incredible metaphysical vision, and after that\nsomehow Chazal tell us that the zekenim, the elder people, somehow\nthey didn’t take the right approach. They looked at it b’lev gas, with\na certain arrogance, and therefore Hakadosh Baruch Hu says to Moshe\nRabbeinu, I’m going to give you Mishna and Gemara. So you could look\nat the Meshech Chochma there, he explains the pasuk, “asher kasavti”,\nso we have to say that there is a Torah of Hakadosh Baruch Hu, and the\nTorah of Hakadosh Baruch Hu roots the Torah in the truth, in the truth\nof the physical world. That’s the root of the Torah. But man is not\nprivy to that truth. Man has to learn the Torah, the Mishnah, the\nGemara, in other words, in the way in which the Torah should be ba’al\npeh.</p>\n<p>David Bashevkin:</p>\n<p>The oral law.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Meir Triebitz:</p>\n<p>The oral law, the way with the oral law, we have the oral law as\ntradition. Which means that, in other words, even though the Gemara\nsays, for example, the Gemara says on kuf amud beis in Eruvin that if\nthe Torah was not given, we can learn ethics from the animals. But\nnonetheless, so that’s the Meshech Chochma [inaudible], that’s called\nthe Torah shekasavti, that’s Hakadosh Baruch Hu’s Torah. But\nultimately, science is a human activity. Science is a human activity.\nMan is supposed to learn the oral law in terms of the Mesorah, the\ntradition, that we have from the sages, and man should not think that\nthe Gemara, the sages, are privy to this ultimate scientific truth.\nWhich serves as the basis of the Torah, but this is not man’s road,\nthis is what man does. So in my opinion, there’s science, according to\nthe Torah, science is very much a human activity. The Torah, Chazal,\nthe tradition of Chazal are communicating the d’var Hashem, the\ntradition of the oral law. Not only oral law, but Chazal was speaking\nin terms of the science of their day. And this is explained by the\nChazon Ish, he speaks about this when he speaks about the laws of\ntreifus, animals which are rendered forbidden to be eaten because\nthey’re missing things which they won’t be able to live very much\nlonger, that Chazal in fact actually decided Halachic issues are based\nupon their science, and we shouldn’t think that Chazal were privy to\nall the advances of science that we have today. That’s a very, very\nimportant thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He is saying based on the meshech chochma <a href=\"https://library.alhatorah.org/?r1=Meshekh_Chokhmah_Shemot_24:12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://library.alhatorah.org/?r1=Meshekh_Chokhmah_Shemot_24:12</a> that Hashem felt it was necessary at that point to give the Torah. Although this was not the best thing.\nThe Best thing would be for us to live like they did before like the Avos, and understand the Torah from the world. Understand how Hashem wants us to live our lives without the Torah as it is.</p>\n\n\n",

Just like this is the case with this Gemara in Sukkos, so too it is the case with Bittul in our Divine Service.

According to Rav David De Sola Pool in <em>The Kaddish</em>, it's origin is as closing tefilla after a Torah discourse. Indeed, it is still used in this way by many sefardim around the world, after a shiur or learning session or even a short vort, a mourner will stand up and say it if there is a minyan.</p>\n<p>This is also how it is used in organised tefilla, which is composed of lots of different sections with different purposes. In order to make a clear ending of a section, the ancient practice of reciting Kaddish is employed as a divider between sections, some of which are recited by mourners.</p>\n<p>Why is it recited so often? The more the better*. The primary gadlut of Kaddish is the \"<em>amen yehe Sheme rabba</em>\" that everyone answers in response. It's considered among the holiest moments in the whole of tefilla, because it's like saying Amen, but 1000 times greater. Rav Simcha Zissel of Kelm writes that the reward for saying it is 1000 times greater than saying amen (note, saying one word of Torah is 1000 times greater still!). The shulchan aruch states that one should run to hear kaddish. There are many great things stated about saying this amen, Chafetz Chaim said it affects <em>yeshuot</em> for klal Yisrael, the Ostrover Rebbe said that if we all say it properly, the geula will arrive. R' Meir Grunwald made it his mission to go around emphasising the importance of saying amen to kaddish.</p>\n<p>So, what is so great about those words? The background starts in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.3a.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 3a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַב יִצְחָק בַּר שְׁמוּאֵל מִשְּׁמֵיהּ דְּרַב: שָׁלֹשׁ\nמִשְׁמָרוֹת הָוֵי הַלַּיְלָה, וְעַל כָּל מִשְׁמָר וּמִשְׁמָר יוֹשֵׁב\nהַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא וְשׁוֹאֵג כַּאֲרִי, וְאוֹמֵר: ״אוֹי לִי\nשֶׁחֵרַבְתִּי אֶת בֵּיתִי וְשָׂרַפְתִּי אֶת הֵיכָלִי וְהִגְלִיתִי אֶת\nבָּנַי לְבֵין אוּמּוֹת הָעוֹלָם״.</p>\n<p>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel said in the name of Rav: The night consists of\nthree watches, and over each and every watch the Holy One, Blessed be\nHe sits and roars like a lion, because the Temple service was\nconnected to the changing of these watches (Tosefot HaRosh), and says:\n“Woe to Me, that due to their sins I destroyed My house, burned My\nTemple and exiled them among the nations of the world.”</p>\n<p>תַּנְיָא, אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹסֵי: פַּעַם אַחַת הָיִיתִי מְהַלֵּךְ\nבַּדֶּרֶךְ וְנִכְנַסְתִּי לְחוּרְבָּה אַחַת מֵחוּרְבוֹת יְרוּשָׁלַיִם\nלְהִתְפַּלֵּל. בָּא אֵלִיָּהוּ זָכוּר לַטּוֹב וְשָׁמַר לִי עַל\nהַפֶּתַח, (וְהִמְתִּין לִי) עַד שֶׁסִּייַּמְתִּי תְּפִלָּתִי. לְאַחַר\nשֶׁסִּייַּמְתִּי תְּפִלָּתִי אָמַר לִי: ״שָׁלוֹם עָלֶיךָ, רַבִּי״.\nוְאָמַרְתִּי לוֹ: ״שָׁלוֹם עָלֶיךָ, רַבִּי וּמוֹרִי״. וְאָמַר לִי:\nבְּנִי, מִפְּנֵי מָה נִכְנַסְתָּ לְחוּרְבָּה זוֹ? אָמַרְתִּי לוֹ:\nלְהִתְפַּלֵּל. וְאָמַר לִי: הָיָה לְךָ לְהִתְפַּלֵּל בַּדֶּרֶךְ.\nוְאָמַרְתִּי לוֹ: מִתְיָרֵא הָיִיתִי שֶׁמָּא יַפְסִיקוּ בִּי עוֹבְרֵי\nדְּרָכִים, וְאָמַר לִי הָיָה לְךָ לְהִתְפַּלֵּל תְּפִלָּה ..קְצָרָה.</p>\n<p>Incidental to the mention of the elevated significance of the night\nwatches, the Gemara cites a related story: It was taught in a baraita\nthat Rabbi Yosei said: I was once walking along the road when I\nentered the ruins of an old, abandoned building among the ruins of\nJerusalem in order to pray. I noticed that Elijah, of blessed memory,\ncame and guarded the entrance for me and waited at the entrance until\nI finished my prayer. When I finished praying and exited the ruin,\nElijah said to me, deferentially as one would address a Rabbi:\nGreetings to you, my Rabbi. I answered him: Greetings to you, my\nRabbi, my teacher. And Elijah said to me: My son, why did you enter\nthis ruin? I said to him: In order to pray. And Elijah said to me: You\nshould have prayed on the road. And I said to him: I was unable to\npray along the road, because I was afraid that I might be interrupted\nby travelers and would be unable to focus. Elijah said to me: You\nshould have recited the abbreviated prayer instituted for just such\ncircumstances...</p>\n<p>וְאָמַר לִי: בְּנִי, מָה קוֹל שָׁמַעְתָּ בְּחוּרְבָּה זוֹ?\nוְאָמַרְתִּי לוֹ: שָׁמַעְתִּי בַּת קוֹל שֶׁמְּנַהֶמֶת כְּיוֹנָה\nוְאוֹמֶרֶת: ״אוֹי לִי שֶׁחֵרַבְתִּי אֶת בֵּיתִי וְשָׂרַפְתִּי אֶת\nהֵיכָלִי וְהִגְלִיתִי אֶת בָּנַי לְבֵין אוּמּוֹת הָעוֹלָם״. וְאָמַר\nלִי: חַיֶּיךָ וְחַיֵּי רֹאשְׁךָ, לֹא שָׁעָה זוֹ בִּלְבַד אוֹמֶרֶת\nכָּךְ, אֶלָּא בְּכָל יוֹם וָיוֹם, שָׁלֹשׁ פְּעָמִים אוֹמֶרֶת כָּךְ.\nוְלֹא זוֹ בִּלְבַד אֶלָּא, בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁיִּשְׂרָאֵל נִכְנָסִין\nלְבָתֵּי כְּנֵסִיּוֹת וּלְבָתֵּי מִדְרָשׁוֹת וְעוֹנִין ״יְהֵא שְׁמֵיהּ\nהַגָּדוֹל מְבֹורָךְ״, הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא מְנַעְנֵעַ רֹאשׁוֹ,\nוְאוֹמֵר: אַשְׁרֵי הַמֶּלֶךְ שֶׁמְּקַלְּסִין אוֹתוֹ בְּבֵיתוֹ כָּךְ,\nמַה לּוֹ לָאָב שֶׁהִגְלָה אֶת בָּנָיו, וְאוֹי לָהֶם לַבָּנִים\nשֶׁגָּלוּ מֵעַל שׁוּלְחַן אֲבִיהֶם.</p>\n<p>And after this introduction, Elijah said to me: What voice did you\nhear in that ruin? I responded: I heard a Heavenly voice, like an echo\nof that roar of the Holy One, Blessed be He (Maharsha), cooing like a\ndove and saying: Woe to the children, due to whose sins I destroyed My\nhouse, burned My Temple, and exiled them among the nations. And Elijah\nsaid to me: By your life and by your head, not only did that voice cry\nout in that moment, but it cries out three times each and every day.\nMoreover, any time that God’s greatness is evoked, such as when Israel\nenters synagogues and study halls and <strong>answers in the kaddish prayer,\nMay His great name be blessed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, shakes His\nhead and says: Happy is the king who is thus praised in his house.\nWhen the Temple stood</strong>, this praise was recited there, but now: How\ngreat is the pain of the father who exiled his children, and woe to\nthe children who were exiled from their father’s table, as their pain\nonly adds to that of their father (Rabbi Shem Tov ibn Shaprut).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When we say <em>amen yehe Sheme rabba</em>, we are praying that Hashem's Name of Yud and Heh should become rabba, great. It is a prayer that the incomplete Name should become the Ineffable name once again, once evil has been eradicated. By saying it, we are consoling and standing up for the suffering of the Shechina, who is with us in exile, who is inconsolable as much as the day the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed, and who longs for Her children's return.</p>\n<p>It is a deep, emotional connection to Hashem, that arouses His compassion and brings the <em>geula</em> closer. The Vilna Gaon writes in his introduction to Tikkunei HaZohar: One who answers <em>amen yehe Sheme rabba</em> in the correct way will merit to be saved from <em>chevlei Moshiach</em>. It can be compared to a king who orders his soldiers, \"Leave him alone. He already suffers my pain. He need not suffer extra agony\".</p>\n<p>The Chafetz Chaim illustrated the Shechina's suffering by asking someone to give a large sum of money to someone so poor he doesn't even have a chair to sit on. The man was unable to find someone so impoverished, despite seeing the most wretched in the town. The Chafetz Chaim said \"you should know that Hashem is poorer than all the paupers you found. For His chair is not complete until the coming of Moshiach, and neither is His House, the dwelling place of His Shechina. Now Hashem is moaning like a dove, unable to rest in peace.\"</p>\n<p>The level of pain Hashem endures for us exceeds human comprehension. Yet there is something that brings Him untold joy - when Hashem hears us answering <em>amen yehe Sheme rabba</em>.</p>\n<p>Yaacov Avinu was the first to utter <em>amen yehe Sheme rabba</em> (Yerushalmi). The gemara in Pesachim states that he said <em>Baruch Shem K'vod Malchuto</em> in response to his children's \"Shema Yisrael\" at the end of his life, and the Yerushalmi states it was <em>amen yehe Sheme rabba</em>. The resolution is that they are the same, but we don't say in hebrew as it is a prayer of angels and we can only whisper it, whereas we wish to say <em>amen yehe Sheme rabba</em> loudly and often!</p>\n<p>The Rokeach called Kaddish \"Shir Hashirim\".</p>\n<p>I strongly recommend getting the book \"Just One Word\" by Esther Stern, and reading all the stories and mashalim on <em>amen yehe Sheme rabba</em>.</p>\n<p>* That's not to say we should try and find as many opportunities to say it as we can. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/83648/759\">this answer on the contrary</a>. It means that the fact it has been inserted by the Anshe Knesset Hagedola into our tefilla in so many places is not surprising, as it is a very great and important prayer. The Arizal would spend precious time each morning touring the shuls of Tzfat so he could say more amens to people's birchot hashachar.</p>\n\n\n",

And even if it were not so, it still wouldn't be a\nchallenge, as even if it were completely forbidden, even so, we would\nlearn from this that if one multiplies laughter, one doesn't merit\nTorah, and the reason is because <strong>laughter which is exaggerated is the\nopposite of thought</strong>, which is intellect, <strong>therefore laughter cancels\nintellect.</strong> And this matter you can understand because laughter renews\nonly from <strong>joking and clowning</strong>, and there is no doubt that joking is\nthe opposite of intellect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Derekh Chayim, the term לֵיצָנוּת can mean \"<strong>joking</strong> and <strong>clowning</strong>.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shaarei_Kedusha%2C_Part_2.5.10?vhe=Shaarei_Kedusha&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaarei Kedusha</a>, which defines it as \"clowning\".

Certainly the point \"Use of sarcasm when making a point\" is a good example of what לֵיצָנוּת means.

For example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Machberet_Menachem%2C_Letter_Lamed.43.2?vhe=Mahberet_Menahem,_London,_1854.&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machberet Menachem; Lamed 43:2; לשון לעג ותעתועים המה</a>,</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>לֵיצָנוּת like it is used in the Torah seems to be directed specifically at derision and disbelief of G-d, the Torah, Moshe Rabbeinu and similar Tzaddikim and the Prophets.</p>\n<p>The first example found involving לֵיצָנוּת is with the Nachash and its interaction with Chavah like is found in Midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.1.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 1:6</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבר אחר אשרי האיש. מדבר באדם הראשון. אמר אדם הראשון אשרני אם לא עמדתי בדרכיו של נחש ו<strong>אשרי אם לא ישבתי במושבו של ליצנות</strong>. רבי יהושע דסכנין בשם רבי לוי אמר <strong>אמר הנחש לשון הרע על בוראו</strong>. אמר לחוה מפני מה אין אתם אוכלין מן העץ הזה <strong>אמרה לו כן צוה לנו הקב\"ה שלא לאכול ממנו ושלא ליגע בו ושלא ליקרב אצלו</strong>. מה עשה הנחש נטל את חוה דחפה עליו ולא מתה והקב\"ה לא צוה אלא שלא לאכול והוסיפה על הדבור <strong>אמר לה הנחש מן העץ הזה אכל המקום וברא את העולם ואם אתם אוכלין ממנו אתם יכולים לבראות עולם כמותו שנאמר (בראשית ג ה) והייתם כאלקים. אלא כל אומן שונא בר אומנותיה. מכאן שהיה לייצן:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Nachash, after pointing out that what Chavah had been taught by her husband was incorrect, said G-d created this world after eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and its opposite, meaning the world where Gan Eden resided is its fruit. Good and its opposite in balance. And if Chavah eats from its fruit, she will be able to create a similar type of world (fruit after its kind) and be like G-d. The Nachash then added derisively, \"All Craftsmen (meaning G-d) hate their craftwork.\" From this comment, the Nachash was a <em>Laitzan</em> (one who mocks G-d and His righteous works)!</p>\n<p>A similar sentiment is also found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.7.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BeMidbar Rabbah 7:4</a> which describes how the Erev Rav derided the acts of G-d for the Jewish people at the time of the Exodus.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מֶה עָשׂוּ, בַּטּוֹבָה שֶׁעָשָׂה לָהֶם הָאֱלֹהִים <strong>הִתְחִילוּ אוֹמְרִים לֵיצָנוּת עָלָיו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This derision is not just limited to G-d and His acts, but also to Moshe, His servant (In My entire Home, he <em>alone</em> is faithful.) like is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.417.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on Shemot 417:1</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זה שאמר הכתוב <strong>תאלמנה שפתי שקר הדוברות על צדיק עתק מדבר במשה.</strong> בשעה שאמר לו הקב\"ה לעשות משכן מיד אמר להם קחו מאתכם תרומה לה' והיה משה עסוק במשכן שלשה חדשים עשו אותו קפלו אותו <strong>והיו מתלוצצים עליו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אותה שעה אמר הקדוש ברוך הוא <strong>תאלמנה שפתי שקר אותן שהיו מתלוצצין אחר המשכן</strong> התחילו טוענין אותו ובאין כל אחד ואחד במלאכתו שנאמר ויביאו את המשכן. הדא הוא דכתיב עוז והדר לבושה זה משה ומשה לא ידע כי קרן וגו'. <strong>ותשחק אלו לצני הדור שהיו מתלוצצים אחר משה לומר אפשר שהשכינה שורה על מעשה ידיו של משה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, Laitzanut appears to be the polar opposite of Torah, which is G-d's will, like is expressed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shir_HaShirim_Rabbah.1.3.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir HaShirim Rabbah I:3:2</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּךְ אִם נִכְנַס דָּבָר שֶׁל תּוֹרָה לַלֵּב יָצָא כְּנֶגְדּוֹ דָּבָר שֶׁל לֵיצָנוּת, נִכְנַס לַלֵּב דָּבָר שֶׁל לֵיצָנוּת, יָצָא כְּנֶגְדּוֹ דָּבָר שֶׁל תּוֹרָה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a sort of symbiotic relationship between Torah and Laitzanut.</p>\n<p>And this prohibited derision includes all derision aimed at the Righteous of Israel like is found in Yalkut Shimoni on Tehillim 688:1 which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שמעון בן שטח היו (נט) ידיו חמומות, <strong>אתא חדא סיעה דליצנין אמרו</strong> נסהוד על בריה ונקטליניה ויהבו עצה על בריה למיקטליה אסהידו עלוי ונגמר דינו ליהרג, כדנפק למיקטליה אמרין ליה מרי סהדי שקרין אנן בעא אבוי מחזר יתיה. א\"ל אבא אם בקשת שתבא ישועה על ידך עשה אותי כאסקופה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That this prohibition against derision is specifically speaking about derision of G-d and His works, Moshe Rabbeinu, the Torah, its Prophets and Sages is also indicated by the teaching  of Rabbi Nachman found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.25b.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 25b</a> which excludes deriding Idol Worship like it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַב נַחְמָן: כֹּל לֵיצָנוּתָא אֲסִירָא, בַּר מִלֵּיצָנוּתָא דַּעֲבוֹדָה זָרָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If you are looking for a definition brought in Halacha it is quite hard as there are numerous examples of where we see <em>leitzanus</em> - scoffing, grouped along with other bad traits like gossiping and falsehood etc.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>However, after a bit of digging I found the following:</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Mitzvot_Katan.105.2?vhe=Sefer_Mitzvot_Katan,_Kopys,_1820&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Sefer Mitzvos Kattan 105:2</strong></a> it discusses the mitzvah of learning Torah and being careful to uses one's mouth specifically for this more spiritual pursuit and not chas veshalom for negative ones:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כך אדם שנכנס בפיו דבר של ליצנות יצא כנגדו דבר תורה ואוי לו ללצנות שתחלתה יסורין וסופה כלייה</p>\n<p>Similarly, a person who brings into his mouth words of scorn / scoffing, words of Torah will correspondingly leave, and woe to him, for the scoffers begin suffering and end in destruction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem that Leitzanus is something which is not only a failing in a person's bein adam lechaveiro (the relationship between man and his fellow), but is has a destructive effect that can impact negatively on one's ruchniyus.</p>\n<p>Interestingly it also should be avoided as it can create a downwards spiral of spiritual degradation.</p>\n<p>Note the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Chasidim.75.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Sefer Chasidim 75</strong></a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם באו לצים במקום מושבך פתאום ומדברים דברי הבאי אל תוכיחם פן ישנאוך לך מאצלם פן תלמוד ממעשיהם הרעים כי הלצנות שנייה לערוה</p>\n<p>If scoffers suddenly come to your neighborhood and speak vain matters, do not reprove them lest they hate you. Leave them, for you might learn from their evil deeds, for scorning is second to immorality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So another categorisation is the very clear severity of it. The danger of being even around such people (i.e. and not actually scoffing oneself) is such that even if you tell them off you risk being sucked into this bad behaviour!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> For example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.156.4?vhe=eu5_text&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 156:4</a> enumerates how to conduct oneself correctly in business and the Mishnah Berurah notes explicitly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יזהר מליצנות וחניפות וכן ירחק משקר בתכלית הריחוק</p>\n<p>He should be careful with scoffing, and flattery, and similarly, he should distance himself from lying as far as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.239.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 239:1</a></strong> discusses the halachos of krias shema for bedtime to which the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.239.9?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Mishnah Berurah 239:9</strong></a> discusses the practise of reviewing one's day during this time, and if he finds that he has done any aveiros he should admit to his wrongdoings and should strive not to do them again. Specifically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובפרט בעונות המצויים כגון חניפות שקרים <strong>ליצנות</strong> לשה\"ר וכן עון בטול תורה צריכים בדיקה ביותר</p>\n<p>Specifically regular sins for example, flattery, falsehood, <strong>scoffing</strong>, loshon hara and similarly the sin of bittul Torah needs additional checking/introspection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>So as far as building a sourced halachic definition - we have so far outlined two key points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Scoffing is a destructive force in someone's spiritual wellbeing</li>\n<li>It is something incredibly severe, to the point when you are near scoffers and telling them off it has the power to suck you in.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is now worth looking at the point in which it emerges in the process of sin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tractate_Derekh_Eretz_Zuta.6.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Derech Eretz Zuta 6:5</strong></a> notes that leitzanus represents the second phase of the beginning of any sin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תחלת עבירה הרהור הלב. <strong>שניה לה ליצנות</strong> שלישית לה גסות הרוח. רביעית לה אכזריות. חמישית לה הבטלה. ששית לה שנאת חנם. שביעית לה עין הרע. הוא שאמר שלמה (משלי כ״ו:כ״ה) כי יחנן (את) קולו אל תאמן בו וגו׳</p>\n<p>The first stage in committing a sin is impure thought, <strong>the second is scoffing</strong>, the third haughtiness, the fourth cruelty, the fifth idleness, the sixth causeless hatred and the seventh an evil eye. That is what Solomon said, When he speaketh fair, believe him not; for there are seven abominations in his heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see that it marks the entry point into a person's sin. It is the first reaction built off a person's impure thought. In other words, a person has a mental drive or suggestion to sin, and then, scoffing follows and starts the process of translating that thought into action.</p>\n<p>So why is this so dangerous?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Chasidim.88.1?ven=Medieval_Jewish_mysticism,_translated_by_Sholom_Alchanan_Singer._Northbrook,_Ill._Whitehall_Co.,_1971&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Chasidim 88:1</a> helps us by noting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הלצנות מעביר המורא והיא שנייה לעבירה וכל המתלוצץ נופל בגיהנם ואינו זוכה להקביל פני שכינה</p>\n<p>Scoffing dispels reverence. It is second to transgression. As our teachers of blessed memory expounded from Scriptures, “All who scoff fall into Gehenna and do not merit to receive Divine Glory.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>So to frame it as part of a definition, it creates the momentum for a person to sin, as it eradicates the natural fear we may have for acting sinfully.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>\n<p>There is a compelling definition from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_Gifter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Mordechai Gifter</strong></a> zt\"l <a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/ravfrand-5765-toldos/?printversion=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. He bases it on the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.25.19?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.25.19.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma</a> cited by Rashi at the beginning of Parshas Toldos that notes that Yitzchak was made to look like Avraham so that the לֵיצָנֵי הַדּוֹר - the scoffers of the generation would not point and say that Sarah became pregnant when in the house of Avimelech.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Gifter, zt”l, Rosh Hayeshiva of the Telshe Yeshiva, once said that we learn about the destructive power of cynicism from this Medrash. Leitzanus is a terrible plague. <strong>A “Leitz” (one who speaks “leitzanus”) is not to be confused with a person who has a good sense of humor or even a sharp wit. Humor is not leitzanus. Leitzanus has a connotation of cynicism. It refers to taking everything which is high and knocking it down. A leitz takes everything that is holy and tries to demonstrate the profane side of it.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After doing a bit of digging, I found that this piece of Rav Gifter can be found in his Pirkei Torah <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=48051&st=&pgnum=83&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. His exact words are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא שמכאן עלינו ללמוד גודל כחה של ליצנות בתור מקור לחורבן והשחתה. והבנת הדברים ע\"פ דברי רמח\"ל במס\"י פ\"ח שביאר שם הענין בעומק חכמתו - ועיי\"ש ציורו הנפלא ממגן המשוח בשמן שחצים נופלים ונשמטים גל ידו לחוץ, כן התוכחה - החץ הירוי לעומק נפשו של אדם ועלולה לעשות מהפכת נפשית, באה הליצנות והתוכחה נשמטת מאלי' ונופלת לארץ - הגישה היא לא גישה של תוקף הדעת, אלא גישה שלות, אי - רצינית, ובגישה כזו כרוכה הסכנה היותר גדולה, וצריך להשמר בזהירות הכי יתירה להנצל מרשת הליצנות</p>\n<p>But from here we must learn the magnitude of the power of scoffing as a source of destruction and corruption. And the understanding of things according to the words of Ramchal in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesilat_Yesharim.5.19?vhe=Shechem_Messilat_Yesharim&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mesillas Yesharim</a>, who explained the matter there in the depth of his wisdom - and look at his wonderful imagery there of the shield smeared with oil that arrows fall and drop with the wave of his hand outside, so too rebuke - the arrow is shot to the depths of a person's soul and can make a mental revolution, yet comes along scoffing and the rebuke drops and falls to the ground. The attitude is not a validity of the mind, but an attitude of peace. If one is not serious, such an approach entails the greatest danger, and must be guarded with the utmost care to avoid being caught in the scoffer's net.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in short, leitzanus takes something that is a solid, well-meaning approach and makes it fall by the wayside, thereby allowing for sin to creep in.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "How did the Sefir Yetzirah arrive at its conclusions, etc.?",
    "content": "# How did the Sefir Yetzirah arrive at its conclusions, etc.?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am new to Judaism (having studied a little bit of many world religions), and am very curious about the esoteric teachings, and the origin/structure/creation of the world from different perspectives.</p>\n<p>In every religion pretty much, from my shallow readings/understandings, especially in browsing Wikipedia, much of the substance of the creation (such as in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Yetzirah.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefir Yetzirah</a>) jump right into the thick of talking about this and that as if it were how things really were, but there is no explanation of how they arrived at those conclusions. So I'm curious in the case of the Sefir Yetzirah, how they arrived at some of their \"conclusions\" or statements/facts/\"proofs\" in the text.</p>\n<p>I have had experiences with meditating on the letters of the English alphabet, how their shape may be a reflection of things in primitive outdoor experience, how their numbers can be associated with various meanings, and it is interesting to think about the possibilities. But as far I know, that is just me thinking of things and finding patterns in symbols and things in the world, not necessarily that that's how things are.</p>\n<p>But in the Sefir Yetzirah, for example, at least in the opening paragraphs/chapters which I have browsed so far, they talk about how G-d:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>created the Universe in thirty-two mysterious paths of wisdom. They consist of a decade out of nothing and of twenty-two fundamental letters. He divided the twenty-two consonants into three divisions : 1) three אִמּוֹת mothers, fundamental letters or first elements ; 2) seven double ; and 3) twelve simple consonants.<br/>\n...Comprehend this great wisdom, understand this knowledge, inquire into it and ponder on it, render it evident and lead the Creator back to His throne again.<br/>\n...He selected three consonants from the simple ones which are in the hidden secret of three mothers or first elements: א\"מ\"ש air, water and ether or fire.<br/>\n...The foundations are the twenty-two letters, three 'mothers', seven 'double', and twelve 'single letters'. Three 'mothers', namely Aleph, Mem, Shin, represent Air, Water, and Fire: Aleph mute as Water, Shin hissing as Fire, and Mem as air of a spiritual type, is as balance, standing erect between them and pointing out the equilibrium which exists, speaking.<br/>\n...He hath formed, weighed, transmuted, composed, and created with these twenty-two letters every living being, and every soul yet uncreated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Etc.. The author (whether Abraham or someone else), makes statements of fact like that last sentence, but doesn't explain how they arrived at this. So all I can think of is that they had a spiritual experience, a bunch of ideas streamed into their consciousness, they found patterns in the symbols and things, and they wrote down their associations. How else can I perceive/understand such information?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_Yetzirah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wiki page</a> on Sefir Yetzirah suggests this text is one of the most influential books on Jewish thought besides the standard main texts. This means that potentially they assume what is being said is the truth or at least has an aspect of truth behind all the metaphors, and the ideas are built upon. But going to further Wiki pages on related topics, you read of things like the Sefirot (10) as if it was common knowledge how it was structured, but this too must have been \"discovered\" or figured out progressively over time or through some spiritual experience.</p>\n<p>So I'm wondering, given the Sefir Yetzirah talks about the universe created from the alphabet and numbers (I haven't gotten that far in my reading yet), how did they arrive at these conclusions? How did they arrive at the ideas that the universe was created from the letters basically? What I'm trying to say is, I would like to find how these ideas were derived, but instead I am finding just the final end result, the information laid out as if it were just fact, without any hint at how they were derived or where they come from. Is this sort of derivation/analysis info buried in some other Jewish commentaries somewhere, or how should I be taking these texts?</p>\n<p>I understand they are esoteric/mystical/deeply metaphoric texts and so shouldn't be taken at face value, and all that. That they take a lot of thinking to glean out the key insights. But at the same time, I'm wondering what is the foundation basically for these ideas, where did they come from, why are they taken as meaningful. Because if I told someone the universe was created out of the English alphabet because of this and that pattern I found in the symbol shapes and the association of their numbers with things in the universe like the 7 planets or the 12 musical notes or whatever, people would probably think I am just making things up (making up random associations that are meaningless). How can I better understand how to take texts such as these in the Jewish mysticism realm?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Hi welcome to Mi Yodeya (again) and thanks for bringing this great question. For this one, the answer is fairly simple, and it is gleaned from insight into how we view the Torah.</p>\n<p>As we stated in the other answer today, the Torah is a revelation, not a science. What we believe about God is that He created the world wilfully and purposefully, and designed every single detail personally. We believe in a God who communicated with us since the start, and has had a lot to say! He created Adam and spoke to him and taught him. He told Adam things that Adam couldn't have worked out by himself, such as some of the secrets to how He created the world.</p>\n<p>This information is part of the Torah. Specifically, part of the Kabbalah (the word Kabbalah means something that was <strong>received</strong>, not derived!). Avraham received the knowledge of these things that cannot be derived in a direct chain from Adam (we have all the names in the chain), as well as through his communication with God through prophecy, and of course when you already have a huge amount of wisdom on this topic, you are able to innovate and work out more things, and Avraham certainly is known for having derived much about Hashem through His saintly wisdom.</p>\n<p>It's important to stress that Hashem didn't need to create the universe in any particular way. Having chosen to create it through speech (language, letter and number) was His decision (and what it really means is an advanced philosophical idea that is further from the literal than we might imagine, as you admit to) and the reasons for that are discussed, but that's what we've received and hopefully this has answered your question.</p>\n\n\n",

There is a corpus on Sefaria and supposedly Bar-Ilan has a collection but I have not been able to find a publicly available version.</p>\n<p>The Sefaria collection seems to be really modest. Surely, we should have at least a million recorded responsas including everything from the previous and from this century. It looks like I'm going to have to scrape sites like Chabad.org, Aish.com, Yeshiva.co etc. manually - recommendations of additional similar sites would be greatly appreciated too.</p>\n<p>Please share any known resources with detailed answers to halachic questions. Any codex that indexes halachic rules would also work as long as the split between the \"question\" (something like \"Laws of family purity\", \"List of kosher fish\", \"Morning blessings explained\" would all be great questions for the purposes of training an AI model).</p>\n\n\n",

This is possible because all Jews are part of one soul, so we are all family.</p>\n<p>Ideally, the person doing it should be someone who has himself lost a parent, and if not he has to get permission from his parents. If it is a non-relative, he should ideally be paid by a relative to do it. Some yeshivot offer a kaddish service.</p>\n<p>As per the rules of this site and common sense, this is a general answer and should not be relied on just because I have the word Rabbi in my online identity. If this is a personal, practical question, one absolutely must ask a local orthodox Rabbi who knows the family, and please do not delay as this is a very important topic.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "When are \"mental associations\" significant/relevant/important, and when are they not, from the perspective of Judaism?",
    "content": "# When are \"mental associations\" significant/relevant/important, and when are they not, from the perspective of Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have taken an initial pass at the Sefir Yetzirah and some other Kabbalah texts, and have had several personal experiences myself where I was able to make \"associations\" between patterns pretty fluidly, such as thinking about the digital clock time and the numbers and letters and cycling through them, tying them to various things with \"standard\" number and letter values such as the 7 visible stellar bodies, the 12 musical notes, the 26 letters of the English alphabet, the 6 directions, the 7 visible colors of the rainbow, etc.. You can really \"derive\" a lot of associations just by thinking about the numbers and standard encounters, and sometimes it's interesting.</p>\n<p>However to a lot of people this feels like \"random\" and \"meaningless\" pattern matching. That is, arbitrary associations being created by your brain based on your experience, upbringing, and memory. Basically, many people feel \"I can easily come up with associations between letters and numbers, but what makes my associations better or worse than the ones you came up with?\"</p>\n<p>I say this after reading through the Sefir Yetzirah where it says there are 3 elements, for example, air, water, and fire (or ether, I'm not sure). But to another person there are 4 elements (earth, air, water, fire), or to modern science there are no longer elements but states of matter (plasma, liquid, solid, gas). To a fish or a dog there are not 7 visible colors but some other number of colors, some bees can see ultraviolet light, etc.. Other animals have other senses like how birds have basically a magnetic sensor to help them navigate vast distances across the Earth. Or another example, there are thousands of spoken languages, potentially dozens/hundreds of writing systems, some with alphabets, others like Chinese with logographs, others are syllable-based like Ahmaric. Hebrew technically is an abjad and only represents consonants, so it is different from an alphabet. Each of these systems has a different number of symbols, so you could do \"gematria\" in any of these systems perhaps. Another example is the sephirot, at first it was somewhat nebulous, now it is 10, or possibly 11, nodes in the diagram. Sometimes things have 4, sometimes 5, sometimes 7, etc.. Sometimes they can be seen as green and blue, other times as red and yellow. Sometimes you break it up like this, sometimes you break it up like that. Like there were 7 heavenly bodies when all we had were our eyes, then there were 9 \"planets\" (including pluto), now there are only 8 (minus pluto). The 10 fingers of the hand are associated with the 10 sephirot, but some people might have a mutation with an extra digit, etc..</p>\n<p>Basically, it is like there are <strong>repetitions</strong> of \"patterns\" in an experience, and they form an impression on us. Like how there were 7 heavenly bodies for at least 100's of years. These \"patterns\" are then used to create associations with other things, but the pattern may evolve or change at some point in the future, or based on a different way of looking at it (a different perspective/culture/etc.). It is sort of like machine learning, how it is all statistics based. Our brains find meaning in repeatable patterns, even if they are only temporary or not exact or can change based on perspective/knowledge. Then we use these patterns to create associations with other patterns, etc..</p>\n<p>But like how the Sefir Yetzirah says there are 3 elements, when the idea of \"elements\" really breaks down in modern science, I wonder when we should adhere to a pattern, and when it is arbitrary or meaningless. In Judaism, what do they have to say about these \"pattern associations\"? When are they relevant, when are they meaningless? What do they say about the fact that the numerical values of things may change based on knew knowledge or a different perspective (like the 3 elements)? Basically wondering what is the science or systematic framework behind making associations, given they are so dynamic.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Hi and welcome to Mi Yodeya, this is a big question that is hard to answer (and might be in danger of being closed for being unfocussed, but let's see if we can cut to the chase).</p>\n<p>You are raising a very philosophical issue here with lots of parts. The first question we can answer is, did Hashem invest meaning purposely into the patterns and numbers that crop up in the world?</p>\n<p>The answer to that is yes, He did. There is much importance on this concept of number and pattern in Torah thought, in fact the name \"Mi Yodeya\" is from a song that goes through the first 13 numbers and how they are associated with Hashem's important things!</p>\n<p>The second question is a bit more involved. How are we supposed to come to an understanding of what Hashem meant by all these numbers and patterns? How do we decode them?</p>\n<p>The answer to that is, we need to be told. Don't get me wrong, Torah morally obligates and strongly encourages us to think for ourselves and use our own logic. However, it creates a realistic framework for this. Remember: Torah is a revelation of everything Hashem wants us to know that we wouldn't be able to know without the Torah! It works in a very different way to science. Science is about coming up with theories and testing them to get to the truth, whereas Torah is a blueprint of the truth.</p>\n<p>So what Hashem's intentions were for the various patterns in life definitely falls under the category of \"something we have to ask Him, rather than try to guess\". There is a definite intention (or several, with associations and connections and a rich tapestry of meaning), but there are also lots of other <em>possible</em> interpretations that are simply not what He had in mind, so leaving it for us to try and contemplate and work out isn't really wise or logical. So as BID commented, it's something we need a mesora (a tradition) for.</p>\n<p>What does that say about our inquisitive, pattern spotting minds and the fun therein? Are we supposed to deny it completely? Some will say yes. It is an indulgence, it can make people loopy, it's all theoretical postulating and therefore a waste of precious time that could be spent pursuing definite truths about Torah and life. For this reason it is universally uncontroversial that nobody should just pick up a Kabbalah book and read it by themselves and try to figure out what it's saying. Kabbalah is taught deliberately as a code that needs a cipher to understand, and deals with very lofty philosophical concepts that are hard to understand properly and need subtlety, humility and a really good teacher. Solid background in Tanach and Talmud and a good head and logical training are an absolute must.</p>\n<p>Still, nobody will outrightly forbid someone from thinking about patterns, in between doing good deeds and study! There's a lot to be said of someone who absorbs the above message and takes it seriously, but still tries to see the wonderful patterns in life and <em>wonder</em>... We will have to wait for Moshiach to know if the 10 dimensions of string theory correspond to the 10 sefirot, and the 26 total dimensions required to include bosons (see The Universe A Biography, John Gribbin, p.38) corresponds to Hashem's Name's gematria, but until then, one is permitted to say \"I don't know if that's true or not, but it is certainly inspiring!\".</p>\n<p>A couple more points on your points:</p>\n<p>May I recommend studying the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Knowledge Argument</a>, and reading up on Qualia. Most of the examples you gave of the way things were counted in different ways by different people pertain to qualia. Qualia are phenomena that do not rest on logical principles or have any underlying structure. Structure does arise from it (colour mixing is a logical science, for example), but due to the nature of qualia being subjective, we have to create a convention for the structure ourselves, and that can turn out different in different systems, which is why some cultures have a blue and a green, and some just have bluegreen etc.</p>\n<p>In Torah, this will happen too. I've seen two different ways of this happening. Either the thing being taught in different ways by different people is because it is a thing where the structure is just a convention, the underlying ideas are more abstract and each takes their own approach to turning it into a mashal (analogy). More often than not though, there is the principle of eilu v'eilu; each is true, and once a missing piece of the puzzle is found, one can see the unity.</p>\n<p>Take the sefirot for example. You are right, there are 11 named sefirot, but as it says in Sefer Yetzira, there are only ever 10 counted. This is not an example of different approach, but actually there is a logical truth here. There are two ways of looking at each system! There is a superficial and external way, and a deep and internal way. When you look at a human soul deeply (such as when you are experiencing your own consciousness), you don't see Keter, because Keter (will) is makif (it's an outside-the-system force, we don't have direct access to whence our desire arises), but you do see Da'at (personal knowledge). Da'at can only be deep though, so when you look at the human soul more superficially (such as when you are looking at someone else), you can't see it, but you can see that Keter is an important component of the human soul.</p>\n<p>Finally, one more point, on the elements. This is connected to much of what I've said already. In Kabbalah, we do indeed talk about 3 or 4 elements. I'll give this example and hopefully you'll have had enough examples to see how things work in this whole matter. In this case, realise that these elements are elements in the spiritual world. As such, they are very very different in kind and concept to elements in the physical world. We are talking about the very substance of how <em>anything</em> is made. It's a hugely esoteric concept, these \"elements\" are very abstract and the only way to really start thinking about them is with PhD level philosophy. The Rebbe Rayatz gives it a good go trying to explain it to the general population in a ma'amar in Sefer Ma'marim תרצ״א, and it's very hard (I am not aware of any translation yet). It brings up the idea of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hiyuli</a>\", the most undifferentiated \"substance\", and how the four elements are connected to that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7880/jewish/Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya, in chapter one</a>, shows a good analogy for the elements, as he associates them with human character traits and demonstrates that really the words used to name those elements are picked because they more accurately describe the concept that these elements represent, and his analogy is using that of movement. Fire rises, earth doesn't move, air moves everywhere and water moves downwards. So it all comes together here and ends with the most important phrase I'll say in this whole question: this needs to be studied properly from the people who have revealed it to us, we cannot reach our own conclusions and indeed, the truths behind this are amazing and wonderful if we invest the time and effort.</p>\n<p>As someone who is studying this without delving into it in the broader context of a lifetime of Torah, there's only so far you are going to be able to get. The best thing you can probably do is get <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sefer-Yetzirah-Creation-Theory-Practice-ebook/dp/B007HNFBXE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Yetzira by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan</a>. It's a great english translation and commentary, that gleans what can be gleaned by someone in your position so you can get the most out of it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Prosperity in Judaism",
    "content": "# Prosperity in Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there a duality notion of prosperity in Judaism? I say this because there are texts that suggest that prosperity or well-being leads to destruction, as in Proverbs 1:32. If the impression of well-being leads to perdition and being in perdition there is the promise that if you convert things will improve, does this not lead to a vicious cycle? Is there kosher prosperity? I say this because in many biblical stories the nation's quest for prosperity involved trade with idolatrous nations allowing free movement within the country to attract merchants. Is it possible to get away from it all and succeed? Solomon prospered greatly by making alliances with neighboring nations, which did not end well for him and his kingdom. So what would be the solution? Nowadays, the view we have is that Jews are very rich and at the same time it is said that the majority are secular Jews, implying that this correlation of prosperity and purity seems to be something difficult to achieve. What do you think?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Thanks for this great question there is lots to say on it.</p>\n<h2><strong>1) Wealth is a G-d-given gift</strong></h2>\n<p>As a starting point, one needs to acknowledge that wealth and prosperity is something that comes direct from G-d.</p>\n<p>Shlomo HaMelech writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.5.18?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Koheles 5:18</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, whenever a man is given riches and property by God, and is also permitted by Him to enjoy them and to take his portion and get pleasure for his gains—that is a gift of God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, as with anything that G-d bestows upon a person, there is a responsibility to use it correctly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.4?ven=The_Mishna_with_Obadiah_Bartenura_by_Rabbi_Shraga_Silverstein&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 2:4</a> exhorts us to</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make His will like your will, so that He make your will like His will [i.e., so that He grant you good with an open hand.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bartenura_on_Pirkei_Avot.2.4.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bartenura</a> explains on this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Make His [God's] will like your will\": Spread your money on 'things of Heaven' \"like your will,\" [meaning] as if you were spreading them for your [own] things. As if you will do this, \"He will make His will like your will,\" meaning to say that He will give you the good with 'a generous eye.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wealth brings the opportunity to give charity. This gifts us the ability to show our gratitude to G-d for the wealth we have received. By showing Hashem that we value his blessing and are prepared to use it in a positive way it can only bring renewed blessing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 2:7</a> notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מַרְבֶּה צְדָקָה, מַרְבֶּה שָׁלוֹם - The more charity, the more peace</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Thus, wealth is seen as a good thing when channelled in the correct way and does not need to mean that its result is one of perdition or suffering.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>2) Keeping G-d in the picture</strong></h2>\n<p>Once we appreciate that wealth comes direct from G-d, we have to acknowledge that not everyone is blessed with it. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.5b.14?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Berachos 5b</a> relates, \"לֹא כׇּל אָדָם זוֹכֶה לִשְׁתֵּי שֻׁלְחָנוֹת\" - not everyone merits to eat off two tables i.e. enjoy successes in Torah AND wealth.</p>\n<p>As such, we have to learn to appreciate what we have - (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.1?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 4:1</a> - \"Who is wealthy? someone is happy with his lot.\"). As Jews we aspire to live a more loftier lifestyle, embracing a life that is first and foremost, one of ruchniyus - spirituality. This is seen as a higher goal. We engage in Torah and mitzvos.</p>\n<p>This should be the central focus. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.9?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 4:9</a> notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yonasan said: whoever fulfills the Torah out of a state of poverty, his end will be to fulfill it out of a state of wealth; And whoever discards The Torah out of a state of wealth, his end will be to discard it out of a state of poverty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, first comes Torah, which if we duly apply ourselves then G-d will bring us reward. The problem many people have, is the moment they see success in this area, they can fall into the mindset that it is כוחי ועוצם ידי - it all comes from my own success, my own business acumen, leaving G-d out of the picture.</p>\n<h2><strong>3) The Dangers</strong></h2>\n<p>You mention that;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>prosperity or well-being leads to destruction</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Building on what we have said, G-d both gives and takes. If He feels we are not utilising this wealth in the right way then He will strip it from us.</p>\n<p>In Chovos Halevavos it writes expressly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If he relies on his wealth, it will be removed from him and left to someone else as written \"He lies down rich, but there shall be nothing to gather; he opens his eyes, and his wealth is not\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.27.19?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 27:19</a>), \"Do not weary yourself to grow rich; cease from your own understanding.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.23.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 23:4</a>), \"Should you blink your eyes at it, it is not here; for it will make wings for itself, like the eagle, and it will fly toward the heavens.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.23.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 23:5</a>), \"so it is he who gathers riches but not by right; he shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end he stands dishonored\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.17.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 17:11</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>4) Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>So wealth is something that comes direct from Hashem. It is to be seen as a blessing and does not have to come through suffering. Rather we have a responsibility to honour G-d's name with it through giving charity etc. and if we do not utilise it in the correct way then G-d can take it just as easily as He first gave it.</p>\n\n\n",

In פרק ב, he talks about the obligation we have not to forget our Torah learning. I don't know that I've seen another exposition that goes into so much detail, and is so absolutely clear (הלכה ח):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ח וגם מי שיודע בעצמו שהוא שכחן גדול בטבעו ותולדתו שאף אם יחזור על\nלימודו פעמים אין מספר לא יזכור כי אם זמן מה ואח\"כ ישכח מעט מעט לא\nיוכל לפטור נפשו מלאו זה דפן תשכח ומצות ושננתם שנתבאר למעלה כי מצות\nהתורה שוות לכל נפש מישראל ולא ניתנה תורת כל אחד ואחד בידו שיהיה\nזה חייב במצוה זו וזה פטור ממנה לגמרי מחמת טבעו ותולדתו אלא כל אחד חייב\nלזכור דברי תורה בלבו כפי יכולתו והשגת כח זכרונו אם מעט ואם הרבה דברי\nתורה.\nועל זה אמרו לא עליך המלאכה לגמור כגון מי שהוא שכחן גדול ואם יהיה\nשונה הלכות רק פרק אחד ביום ויחזור עליו מאה פעמים ויותר ואפילו כל\nהיום כולו לא יוכל לזכרו היטב כי אם חודש אחד על דרך משל ואח\"כ אם לא\nיחזור עליו יתחיל לשכוח מעט מעט הרי זה חייב לעשות כן ללמוד בכל יום\nרק פרק אחד ולחזור עליו כל היום כולו וכן יעשה שלשים יום ואח\"כ בסוף החדש\nיחזור על השלשים פרקים אלו כמה פעמים עד שיוכל לזכרם היטב עוד ג' או ד\nשבועות על דרך משל ואח\"כ ילמוד בתוך כך עוד פרק אחד בכל יום ויחזור עליו\nכל היום כולו ויעשה כן עד כלות הג' או ד' שבועות אלו ואזי יחזור עוד פעם\nאו שתים על שלשים פרקים הראשונים וגם על פרקים האחרונים שלמד בג' או ד\nשבועות אלו עד שיוכל לזכור הכל עוד כמה שבועות ובתוך כך ילמוד עוד פרק\nאחד בכל יום. וכן יעשה להיות מוסיף והולך פרק אחד בכל יום בכל ימים\nשבינתיים בין חזרה לחזרה עד שילמוד כל כך הרבה משנה ותלמוד בענין כשיצטרך\nלחזור על הראשונות בסוף כל חדש כפי טבעו שאינו יכול לזכור היטב יותר מחדש\nאחד על דרך משל אזי ישהה בחזרה זו כל החדש כולו עד שיחזור על כל לימוד\nשלמד עד עתה וכן יעשה לעולם מידי חדש בחדשו לחזור תמיד על הראשונות.</p>\n<p>Someone who knows about himself that he is very forgetful by his\nnature, so that if he reviews many times he will still not remember\nmore than a certain time and then forget, he may <em>not</em> therefore free\nhimself of this prohibition [of allowing himself to forget], and the\nobligation of ושננתם explained above. For mitzvos of the Torah are for\nall Jews, not for each to decide which ones he should keep, or skip\nbecause of his difficult nature. Rather, everyone is obligated to\nremember Torah to the best of his ability, a little or a lot...<br />\nSay\nsomeone is very forgetful, and if he learns a section of halacha today\nand reviews it a hundred times and more, all day long, he will only be\nable to remember it for a month, say, and then slowly forget. He would\nbe obligated to learn only one section a day and review it all day,\nand do that for each of thirty days, and at the end review them all,\ntill, say, he'll remember for another few weeks. During that time he\ncan learn another section each day and review that all day, and then\nreview everything so that he can remember it all for another few\nweeks, and learn more during that time... And so should he continue to\nadd a perek at a time between reviews... If he sometimes needs to take\noff a full month to review he should do that too... and so continue\nforever, always reviewed everything he learned...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See all his words. This section has fascinated me for many years. His words are so clear and unmistakeable, so absolute. As he says very clearly, לא עליך המלאכה לגמור: You don't need to learn the whole Torah. You do need to remember every thing you've learned, and learn as much as you can using that guideline.<br />\nAnd yet...<br />\nDoes anyone do this, Chabad or otherwise? I know all yeshivos include time for review, but I've never seen one that acknowledges that each student has an obligation to make sure that they remember every single thing they've learned, to the extent that they are just not allowed to continue otherwise.<br />\nWe all know people with amazing memories who remember a tremendous amount of their Torah, Baruch Hashem. But notice that he is very explicitly <em>not</em> talking about someone with a good memory; his whole example is about someone with a much worse memory than most of us. The Rebbe still thinks that this person's obligation to remember every single thing he has learned takes precedence over - all the rest of his learning.<br />\nIf people and yeshiva programs do <em>not</em> do this - I know they don't! - are there other opinions that justify it? Or am I misunderstanding what the Alter Rebbe is saying here? Is it just a \"Midrash\", a lofty goal to strive for?</p>\n<p>Addendum: Several have pointed out that there are programs that emphasize chazarah seriously, and that actually attempt a chazarah system that will enable the student to remember what he learns. <a href=\"http://www.oraysa.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oraysa</a>, <a href=\"https://kinyanhamasechta.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">KinyanHaMasechta</a>, and others. Which is a wonderful thing. I guess the part I'm missing is the clarity that the Alter Rebbe presents, that if you are going to lose track of part of it, you need to stop going forward with the chaburah and do whatever chazarah is necessary so that you don't forget any of it. In other words, that if there's a choice, chazarah needs to win.<br />\nIt could be that the answer is that this is a very individual kind of decision, and an organized chaburah can't make those kinds of decisions for its students. What more can they do than set up enough chazarah that they think is sufficient for most people?</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.54a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eiruvin 54a</a> relates that Bruriah (the wife of Rabbi Meir) once found a student learning in an undertone and she was quick to scold him. Using this as an entry point, the Gemara goes on to explain the importance of learning out loud and the resultant side-effects for those who do not fall in line with this practice. @Shmuel has already enumerated how Rabbi Eliezer relates that he once had a student who learnt in a low voice and within the space of three years, the student forgot his learning. Therefore, it would seem that it is not enough to just read the text with one’s eyes. One needs to actively verbalise the words, since when a person learns out loud, it serves to embed the Torah within a person’s memory.</p>\n<p>Immense importance is therefore attributed to learning in this manner and is supported in Halacha.

As such, a person cannot fulfil his obligation through mere thought, and must either vocalise the words himself or hear from someone else who reads out loud.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pele_Yoetz.338.1?vhe=Torat_Emet&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pele Yoetz</a> takes this further by explaining that when a person articulates the words of Torah, the sound ascends to Hashem and “pierces through the heavens”. For this reason;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וחשוב מאד לפני המקום הקורא בקול בשפה ברורה משמח אלוקים\"</p>\n<p>“It is very important before Hashem for one to read with his voice with clear articulation as it gladdens Hashem”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this we learn that when a person does not learn out loud, not only does he prevent the תורה from remaining in his memory, but also he misses out on an opportunity to give Hashem pleasure.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Eruvin 54a discusses the idea of learning out loud. It <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.54a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">begins</a> with a story of a student of R' Eliezer, who would study quiet, but then, after three years, the student would forget all he has learned:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer had a student who would study quietly, and after three years he forgot his studies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.4.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 4:22</a>, it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For they are life to those who find them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.54a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara</a> interprets this to mean, based on the word לְמֹצְאֵיהֶ֑ם \"to find\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not read: “To those who find them [lemotzeihem],” but rather “to those who express them [lemotzi’eihem],” with their mouth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.54a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">whole idea</a> of learning out loud, is that when singing, speaking etc.. you use your body in it. When doing this, you'll retain more than if you study quietly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if the Torah is ordered in your 248 limbs, i.e., if you exert your entire body in studying it, it will be secure, and if not, it will not be secure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Maharsha on this Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.54a.1?lang=bi&with=Chidushei%20Agadot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ערוכה כל כו' דריש לי' אלימוד תורה דכתיב לעיל מיניה כי ברית עולם שם לי דהיינו התורה שנאמר בה אם לא בריתי יומם וגו' ואמר ערוכה בכל דהיינו בכל רמ\"ח אברים שהדיבור בקול רם מביא הרגשה ותנועה לכל האברים וק\"ל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>ArtScroll, in their version of Eruvin 54a, mentions in footnote 3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, one should always study in a loud voice, because that stimulates movement in all the limbs of one's body, involving them all in the learning process, and that ensures that one's learning will not be forgotten.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Torah_Study.3.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Hilchos Talmud Torah 3:12</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] And any who makes his voice heard and the time of his study, his learning is sustained in his hand, but the one who reads quietly forgets quickly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.1.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehoshua 1:8</a>, the Torah states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This book of the Torah shall not depart out of thy mouth;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Metzudat_David_on_Joshua.1.8.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudos Dovid</a>, on Yehoshua 1:8 explains this to mean:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because through use from your mouth, lest you forget what.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also Peninei Halakhah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Peninei_Halakhah%2C_Prayer.10.4.3?ven=Peninei_Halakhah,_English_ed._Yeshivat_Har_Bracha&lang=bi&p2=Joshua.1.8&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(footnote)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This book of the Torah shall not depart from your mouth. You shall meditate thereon day and night.” Although in-depth study of certain matters is possible and perhaps even preferable to do via one’s thoughts, still, at all other times it is necessary to learn by saying the words out loud (Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Talmud Torah 2:12). In that way, the learning one accomplishes becomes clearer and the abstract ideas he learned via thought are understood better. Further, someone who learns out loud remembers his learning better (see Eiruvin 54a). However, the Vilna Gaon (Gra) maintains that even though the essence of one’s learning should be done out loud, nonetheless, even thinking the words and ideas of the Torah is part of the mitzvah, as it says (Joshua 1:8), “You shall meditate thereon day and night,” and “meditating” is thinking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Peninei Halakhah mentions the opinion of the Kaf HaChayim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>someone who is reading a book usually will also read with his mouth. Nevertheless, although it is good to take into consideration the opinion of the Gra, one must say a few verses aloud after Birkot HaTorah in order to adjoin the blessing to the learning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>All that has been said is true in regards to learning Nigleh, the revealed level of the <em>Torah</em>. Now, for <em>Nistar</em>, i.e., <em>Kabbalah</em> the matter can be entirely different. As it is written, \"The silent voice is the supernal voice from which all other voices proceed\" (<em>Zohar</em> 210a, <em>Vayigash</em>). Silent learning allows for a greater level of introspection and integration in the intellect of the deep concepts, which cannot be understood from a mere rational reading aloud, nor by simple reasoning. The <em>nistarim</em>-secrets are hidden and require a different level of learning. This is so although the <em>binah</em>-rational mind is in always and constantly in <em>zivug</em>-union with the <em>chochmah</em>-intuitive mind, the intuitive level takes precedence, and its source is in the <em>sefirah</em> of <em>chochmah</em> (right-brain activity), that is, <em>koach mah</em> - the \"power of what\", where the <em>mah</em>-what signifies silence from unknowingness and the emptiness of Ego-orientation to a G'dliness-oriented mindset. There is much more, but this should suffice for now.</p>\n\n\n",

Also, וכמו שמהותו נעלם תכלית העלם, כן מציאותו נעלם <strong>תכלית ההעלם</strong>. ומציאות זולתו תלוי במציאותו, לפי שכולם קנו המציאות ממנו (R' Yosef Albo, Sefer HaIkkarim, הבנת ה' בדרך שלילת התארים).

A partial parallel may be found in the phrase \"admat kodesh\" in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zechariah.2.16?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zechariah 2:16</a>.

Sinai was in Eretz Yisrael).</p>\n<p>However, it's very likely an ancient term, because the Greek version of the term appears in a few Hellenistic Jewish texts. For example, it appears once in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/The_Book_of_Maccabees_II.1.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2nd Maccabees 1:7</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the year 169, the time of the reign of King Demetrius, we wrote to you concerning all the hardship that came upon us, with the betrayal of Jason and his cohorts in the <strong>the holy land</strong>, they sinned in the kingdom of Judah.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Philo</a> also used the Greek term in his writings.

Where did Moshe know this from? After all he grew up in Pharaohs palace....</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As it says in Malbim Shemot, Moshe was still nursed until the age of 2 by Yocheved, among his people. According to Dvarim Rabbah 11:9, he got prophecy from the age of 3 months, and learned the whole Torah and becoming an exceptional scholar by the time he was returned to Batya at age 2. An angel fed him so he would never have to eat the palace foods (Siftei Cohen Shemot 2:10).</p>\n<p>If Moshe hadn't learned it during this time, then he may have learned it at age 20 when he first went out to see his people, and he learned of their suffering (Shemot Rabbah 1:16). In those days, he would teach them Torah, read to them from the book of Iyov and other works on the impending redemption, and he calculated the date of Shabbat so they could keep it etc.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>NOTE: As I am in a rush, I haven't double checked the above quoted sources, I am relying on the scholarship of Yosef Deutsch in Let My Nation Go.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This does not answer outright, but the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.1.120b.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar 120b</a> notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּגִין דְּמִיּוֹמָא דְּאִתְיְילִיד לָא אַעֲדֵי מִנֵּיהּ שְׁכִינְתָּא</p>\n<p>From the day that he was born, the Shechinah (Divine Presence) never left him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So one can argue that despite growing up in the palace he was still spiritually attuned to a higher world even if he wasn't necessarily aware of it, and thus at the time he needed to use the sheim Hashem it came as he was endowed with this spiritual channel.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <em>Ari\"zal</em> explains elsewhere (<em>Sha'ar HaPesukim</em>, <em>Shemot</em>) that <em>Moshe rabbeinu a\"h</em> is directly associated with the level of <em>da'at</em> of <em>Z'eir Anpin</em>, and the holy Name used to kill the Egyptian is found in the <em>reshei tevot</em> of the verse א\"ת ה\"שמים ו\"את ה\"ארץ (<em>Bereshit</em> 1:1), thus א\"הוה (pronounced <em>Akvah</em>). And this holy Name is associated with da'at as well.

    "content": "# Hashem and the Platonic World\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>2 + 2 = 4, right? If I have 2 things, and you have 2 things, we have 4 things between us.</strong> This is an inescapable logical reality. If we want a coherent, consistent set of rules for counting, this is the simplest and most useful, as well as what applies to the created physical (and spiritual?) reality we are in. The fact that this is the most useful, coherent and consistent system of counting is a \"set in stone\" fact that belongs to the Platonic world.</p>\n<h2><strong>Question: Defining the Platonic world as Sir Roger Penrose does in \"The Road to Reality\"; the \"perfect\" world of logical structures (logic, mathematics), what <em>exactly</em> is Hashem's relationship to it? Is it any of the following (or something else?)</strong>:</h2>\n<h4>1. He created the Platonic world, <em>and designed it</em>.</h4>\n<p>He decided that 2 + 2 = 4 in the above counting system. He <em>could</em> have made it so that 2 + 2 = 5, <em>without</em> modifying the meaning of \"2\", \"+\", \"=\", \"4\", or \"5\" (i.e. keeping all of that <em>exactly the same</em>), Hashem could have <em>still</em>, in His omnipotence/lack-of-definition, said \"Let 2 plus 2 be equal to 5\", and so it would have verily been and we wouldn't have been able to fathom 2 + 2 = 4 in the same way. We can't imagine how that would work, but we are compelled to believe this in light of our theology.</p>\n<h4>2. He created the Platonic world, but one does not \"design\" the Platonic World.</h4>\n<p>It's not possible that 2 + 2 = 5 (again, without the obvious modification of \"2\", or \"+\" or \"5\"; nor switching counting systems, which is just a convention, while I am referring to fundamental mathematics). There's no possibility of a universe where, if you have 2 things, and I have 2 things, together we have 5 things. Asking Hashem to do that is as meaningless as asking Him to create a square circle. However, there <strong>was once a time when</strong> there was absolutely no such thing as squares, circles or \"2\" or \"5\" or \"+\", not <em>b'po'el</em>, not <em>b'co'ach</em>, not <em>b'svara</em>. Hashem created all that in the same way He created anything else.</p>\n<h4>3. One does not \"create\" the Platonic world, Hashem is also bound by its truths (ch'v)</h4>\n<p>Given that 2 + 2 = 4 and that's inevitable, then Hashem didn't create that. That's just the way it is. Hashem just \"enabled\" it, by creating in general; He caused <em>possibility</em>, but He didn't need to create anything in terms of <em>what's</em> possible: that just is. 2 + 2 was always going to equal 4, and Hashem has always known that. I say <em>chas veshalom</em> because just expressing the idea that Hashem is \"bound\" by something sounds very wrong, which is why this position, while seemingly inescapable to my small, finite mind, is going to take the most work to prove.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Couple of extra points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don't want to get too into the philosophy of Plato. I am just borrowing his name to quote the idea of this perfect world of logical and mathematical forms in the most loose sense so we can talk about it. Anything that <em>he</em> said about it isn't necessarily what I am holding (e.g. we don't need to discuss here if the Platonic world is \"real\" or not etc). I think that's a bit much for this question and should only be addressed if absolutely necessary. My question is <strong>what do Chazal and Torah say on this</strong>, not him or any other secular philosopher (although they can be brought for context or utility!).</li>\n<li>I have been asking this question for a long time. I've only ever had one answer and that is (1) above. Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb told me that \"yes, that's what it seems the Torah is saying, but it's very hard to understand\". I've also seen it come up many times in Chabad philosophical writings; in fact, it's quite a key idea behind a lot of Kabbalistic points (such as the idea that Hashem created principles, including the principle of existence itself - which is a Platonic structure).</li>\n<li>I don't feel qualified to \"accept\" an answer here; alas, it falls on me to do so. I do apologize for any bias I have. I have spent most of my life believing (3) and expecting a good explanation of how it doesn't detract from Hashem's omnipotence, but lately, I think my bias is towards (1). I will look at votes, but the ideal answer will have a good explanation, go into as many details as possible (for example, if 1 is being brought, one should try to explain to some extent how it is possible that He could have made 2 + 2 = 5; and if 3 is being brought, some explanation on how we can understand Hashem being bound by anything; etc.) and have strong sources.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First, we would have to establish the Platonic world exists. Aristotle said it didn't. This particular 1 apple and 1 apple making two apples exists, but the general pattern is a rule people extracted, and doesn't have an existence.</p>\n<p>The Rambam actually uses this point when speaking of the concept of \"human being\". Individual people exist, but there is no created concept of \"human being\" in general. He writes (Moreh Nevuchim 3:18m in Freodlander's 1903 imperfect but public domain translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is an established fact that species have no existence except in our own minds. Species and other classes are merely ideas formed in our minds, whilst everything in real existence is an individual object, or an aggregate of individual objects. This being granted, it must further be admitted that the result of the existing Divine influence, that reaches mankind through the human intellect, is identical with individual intellects really in existence, with which, e.g., Zeiḍ, Amr, Kaled and Bekr, are endowed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Different people fit the category more or less, because that's all it is, a generalization people's minds constructed from the various instances they encounter.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to logic, the Rambam considers it a facet of Truth, and thus of the Divine Essence. From 3:15:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>THAT which is impossible has a permanent and constant property, which is not the result of some agent, and cannot in any way change, and consequently we do not ascribe to God the power of doing what is impossible. No thinking man denies the truth of this maxim; none ignore it, but such as have no idea of Logic... Likewise it is impossible that God should produce a being like Himself, or annihilate, corporify, or change Himself....  Again, whilst philosophers say that it is impossible to produce a square with a diagonal equal to one of the sides, or a solid angle that includes four right angles, or similar things, it is thought possible by some persons who are ignorant of mathematics, and who only know the words of these propositions, but have no idea of that which is expressed by them. I wonder whether this gate of research is open, so that all may freely enter, and whilst one imagines a thing and considers it possible, another is at liberty to assert that such a thing is impossible by its very nature; or whether the gate is closed and guarded by certain rules, so that we are able to decide with certainty whether a thing is physically impossible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That chapter has more problems with figuring out what is logically impossible than with saying Hashem cannot do a paradox.</p>\n<p>But either way, it is no different to the Rambam whether one asks why Hashem couldn't make 2+2=5 than why He couldn't catch a cold, make a fatzlapah or any other meaningless combination of syllables. The thing you're asking for makes no sense.</p>\n<p>So, the Rambam picks other options to your #5. Either that illogical systems are meaningless mouthings, or that Hashem isn't so much \"bound by\" logic as He is Truth, and logic is a consequence of His Esssence.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>But there are plenty of Rishonim who are more Platonist than that, so it would pay explore the question from their perspective...</p>\n<p>The Ramchal says that logic itself is a nivra, a created \"thing\", and therefore Hashem couldn't be subject to it. So, we could have lived in a universe where 2+2=5, but it wasn't His Will to be so. Humanity needs a logical and consistent system of logic, or else we cannot reason about anything, and Free Will would be meaningless.</p>\n<p>So Hashem set up some system of logic and math because it fit His \"Desire\" to provide us with meaningful Free Will. Now the question is why this system and not that.</p>\n<p>The past century plus has shown that there are multiple possible logics — multivalent logic (values other than true and false exist), fuzzy logic, Quantum Logic (in which conflicting possibilities coexist until the \"wave function collapses\"), and many others. Logic is no longer one system that must be true in any context. Which argues in favor of the Ramchal’s position, that these logics are created and not an aspect of Divine Truth.</p>\n<p>Also, according to Noether’s [1st] Theorem, every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. In other words, energy is conserved because physics is symmetric over time, ie the laws of physics don’t change. Momentum is concerved because physics doesn’t change based on location, angular momentum is conserved as an aspect of the laws of physics being the same in every direction (even if in our situation, gravity isn’t the same), etc…</p>\n<p>We are getting very close to the point of finding that logic underlies physical law. In which case, we would be forced to conclude that any miracle that defies nature would require Hashem defying logic.</p>\n<p>So, I think that because of secular developments that post-dated both, the existence of \"the Quantum Realm\" in which Aristotelian logic fails and the existence of miracles in a post-Noethe understanding of the universe both point to logic being a nivra, and not a feature inherent to Truth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You might also want to see this discussion of a related question, the Euthyphro Dilemma. In a monotheistic form, the question is whether Hashem Decided what Good and Evil are, in which case there is no cause for Good to be Good, and it's all artbirary, or whether Good and Evil are pre-existing criteria, and thus implying that Hashem was subject to pre-existing ideas of good and evil. My answer there: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/118147/1570\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/118147/1570</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I was almost inclined to vote to close this question because it doesn’t really seem to be about Judaism on the surface.</p>\n<p>But to give you the benefit of the doubt and reading carefully what you wrote, it seems that what you are asking about is really pertaining to the subject of the Sefirot discussed in kabbalistic literature.</p>\n<p>What you are calling <em>the Platonic World</em>, you define in terms of logic and mathematics, meaning quantification.</p>\n<p>In the nomenclature and context of Torah you are describing the Sefirot (ספירות). When trying to understand the concept of Sefirot a good analogy is to think of the distinction between G-d and His name. He and His name are one and yet He, at His essence and being, transcend even His name. His name is only a vessel or tool that enables us to connect.</p>\n<p>This is in keeping with what is found in the first chapter of Sefer Yetzirah and the 3 variations of the root ספר, ספר,ספר.</p>\n<p>The first of these 3 terms is referring to the general category of quantification, meaning mathematics and logic in the broadest sense. A related idea would be the mathematical expression of ciphering. This category also pertains to the beginning of the introduction of measured or linear time (זמן משוער) and its transition from the earlier state of non-linear time (זמן בלתי המשוער). This is also called the general category of שנה.</p>\n<p>The second of these 3 terms is referring to the general category of form. Again in the broadest sense. Linguistically associated with Sofrut and the formation of letters. This category can be associated with <em>Space</em> or <em>Place</em> and is also called the general category of עולם.</p>\n<p>The third of the 3 terms pertains to discrete being as expressed through the 5 Gevurot. Like it explains in Sefer Yetzirah, this is understood by way of example through the function of speech and the formation of words by the 5 parts of the mouth which divide and break the simple sound or voice into speech. This is the idea of Sippur, <em>telling</em>. This final category is also described as Soul נפש, which is similar divided into 5 terms (נפש, רוח, נשמה, חיה, יחידה.</p>\n<p>This group (עולם, שנה, נפש) is what is alluded to in the Torah when it says Moshe Rabbeinu entered the <em>cloud</em> (עש״ן) when ascending Mount Sinai to receive the Torah from G-d.</p>\n<p>This Sefirotic system is essentially what makes creation and existence as we understand it, to be. And this is in contrast to G-d at the level of <em>Being</em> or <em>Essence</em>, which transcends any expression and is unknowable.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in a very detailed explanation of the concept, there is a Chassidic discourse from the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok in his Sefer HaMa’amarim from the year 5685 for parshat Shemot which begins with the words:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31676&st=&pgnum=134\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הבאים ישרש יעקב יציץ ופרח ישראל כו׳</a></p>\n<p>Enjoy the Ma’amar!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I recently stumbled across this passage of שער האמונה ויסוד החסידות, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sha%27ar_HaEmunah_VeYesod_HaChasidut%2C_Entrance_to_the_Gate_of_Beit_Yaakov.4.4?vhe=Shaar_HaEmunah_Ve%27Yesod_HaChassidut,_1996.&lang=bi&with=About&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">פתח השער לבית יעקב ד׳</a>, which unequivocally supports #1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אכן צריך האדם להאמין באמונה שלימה, שהשי\"ת יכול לשנות באדם זאת ההשגה והשכל, להשגה אחרת ושכל אחר, בין בכוללות ההשגה לשנות כל סדר המערכה\nבמעשה</strong>, שישנה שיתבטל כח הבחירה מהאדם, ובין שישנה רק ההשגה והשכל, וכח\nהבחירה לא יתבטל, ויכול ליתן באדם שכל אחר והשגה אחרת, שיבין וישכיל בכל\nדבר היפוך ממה שמבין עתה. וזה דאיתא במס' (תמיד כח.) איזוהי הדרך שיבור\nלו האדם וכו' יחזיק באמונה יתירה שנאמר (תהלים קא) עיני בנאמני ארץ לשבת\nעמדי, והוא שיאמין באמונה שלימה שאין שום דבר נמנע מהבורא, וגם דעת האדם\nהוא תמיד ביד הש\"י. <strong>שכמו שאנו מבינים בשכל הזה ובידיעתנו ובהשגתנו\nהזאת, שאי אפשר לשני הפכים להיות בנושא אחד, כן יכול לחדש לנו דיעה ושכל\nאחר והשגה אחרת, שנשכיל ונבין ונדע בידיעה גמורה שאפשר להיות שני הפכים\nבנושא אחד</strong>. וכדאיתא בזה\"ק פ' בא (דף מב:) הנ\"ל דאנא יכיל למחאה ההיא\nצורה ולמעבד לה כמה זמנין ולית אלוה אחרא דיכיל לממחי וכו'. וכמ\"ש לעיל,\nשמאחר שהשגתנו ושכלנו וידיעתנו הם נבראים ונסדרים ונערכים, ע\"פ רצון הש\"י\nמה שחלק לנו וסדר לנו, ויכול לשנות ולהפך מהפך אל היפך. וכ<strong>מו שנבין\nונדע עתה בירור גמור ששנים הם יותר מאחד, כן יכול השם יתברך להפוך שכלנו\nודעתנו שנבין בבירור גמור, שאחד הוא יותר משנים</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Indeed, a human being is enjoined to believe with perfect faith that God can change his understanding and power of intellect to a\ncompletely different one, including one’s overall intellect, that is,\nthe entire order and structure of his mind.</strong> This could mean that\nman’s power of free choice could become completely nullified, or it\ncould mean that only his understanding and power of intellect is\nchanged, yet his free choice remains intact. It could be that God\ngives man a completely new way of understanding totally different from\nthat which he now knows. This is as it is said in the Gemara (Tamid,\n28a), “Which is the right way that man should choose? Let him have\nabundant faithfulness, as it is written (Tehillim, 101:6), ‘My eyes\nare upon the faithful of the land that they may dwell with Me.’” This\nmeans to believe with perfect faith that nothing is impossible for the\nCreator, and similarly, man’s mind is in God’s hands. For example,\n<strong>just as it we now understand with clarity of intellect that it is impossible that two opposites could be true on any one subject, it is\nin God’s power to grant us a perfectly clear understanding that two\nopposites could be true in one situation</strong>. This is as it is written\nin the Zohar (Bo, 42b), quoted above: I can erase its form and\nre-create it as many times as I want, and there is no god above Me\nthat can erase My “form.” As was mentioned previously, since human\nknowledge and understanding is a created entity, ordered, arranged,\nand granted to us according to God’s will and desire, it could be\nGod’s will and desire to change it to its very opposite. <strong>Just as we\nknow now with perfect clarity that two is more than one, so too is it\npossible that God can have us believe with complete clarity that one\nis more than two.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then brings from R. Yedaya Ben Avraham that the Rashba would teach position #2, but that this is wrong, and then proceeds to bring proofs from various sources, such as the Ark not taking up any space in the Holy of Holies, or the people bowing with enough room even though it was packed in the Beit Hamikdash, and how really contradiction and impossibility are only constructs of the way our intellect has been created and programmed by Hashem, and when He desires, He can change it and we have no issue understanding that these \"impossible\" things are just as acceptable as anything else. Indeed, one day we will no longer be restricted like this.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is חטי קרדינותא?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>**</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חטי קרדינותא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>This expression appears in R' Chayim Vital's Etz Chayim 1:2, מ\"ב ענין הצמצום הזה הוא לגלות שורש הדינין כדי לתת מדת הדין אח\"כ בעולמות וכח ההוא נקרא בוצינא דקרדינותא כמו <strong>חטי קרדינותא</strong>, indicating a relationship to the more known concept and expression בוצינא דקרדינותא Botzinah de-Kardinuta. I have not seen this expression appear again in the Etz Chayim, and I would like a good translation of it. In the Targum, חטי could mean (among others) \"delicate/tender\", \"clean/polish\", but also \"sin\". Perhaps, someone would have a better translation of חטי קרדינותא. The problem is that the common translation of בוצינא דקרדינותא is \"hard spark\" (also, \"lamp of darkness\"), which is anthiethical to the said synonyms to חטי. Yet, the text indicates (via כמו) that the two instances of קרדינותא are alike/related. Any thoughts?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Not that I would presume to explain Rabbi Vital's words or the teachings of the Ari z\"l, but in context it seems to be alluding to the expression found in the name of Rav Kahana in tractate <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.27a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 27a</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב כהנא מנין לשחיטה שהיא מן הצואר שנאמר (ויקרא א, ה) ושחט את בן הבקר <strong>ממקום ששח חטהו ממאי דהאי חטהו לישנא דדכויי</strong> הוא דכתיב (ויקרא יד, מט) וחטא את הבית ואיבעית אימא מהכא (תהלים נא, ט) תחטאני באזוב ואטהר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That the text from Eitz Chayim you quote is relating this to the <em>Tzimtzum HaRishon</em> at the very beginning of Creation. That this Tzimtzum is also called <em>the Lamp of Darkness</em> like the <em>Cleansing place of Darkness</em>.</p>\n<p>That in kabbalistic teaching this Tzimtzum is the concealment of the Infinite, <em>simple and undifferentiated</em> Light(אור אין סוף) at the beginning of Creation. This results in <em>what appears to be</em> the absence of light, or <em>Darkness</em>. Like the text states explicitly, this is the root of Judgement (also called Gevurah) and is the source of all the discrete worlds or universes which follow, meaning separate exist apart from G-d's absolute oneness (יש מאין).</p>\n<p>That in keeping with what Rav Kahana is saying, this (the Tzimtzum HaRishon) parallels the place of ritual slaughter at the throat  which is also the source point for the simple, undifferentiated sound or voice of the animal.</p>\n<p>And continuing that analogy, in the human being, who is comprised of both an <em>Animal (or animating) Soul</em> and a <em>G-dly Soul</em>, that simple sound is then differentiated into the letters and words of speech (which make up prayer and Torah study) via the five parts of the mouth. Those five parts of the mouth correspond with the five Gevurot and their corresponding five Chassadim. That is why this expression carries the dual meaning of dressing in a garment <em><strong>which conceals</strong></em> and also <em><strong>cleansing</strong></em> through words of Torah and prayer.</p>\n<p>For details of this word meaning, see Jastrow, definition I for חטה, חטא, חטי,  in Binyan Pi'el which pertain to <em>dressing</em> and <em>cleansing</em> and definition II which pertains to the idea of <em>seduction</em> and <em>sin</em>.</p>\n<p>This second definition relates to the allegory used by the Ari z\"l comparing the <em>Yetzer HaRah</em> to a Harlot who is also a loyal subject of the King. The King sends the Harlot to tempt his son in order to reveal the superior qualities of the son. The Harlot, being a loyal servant of the King, obeys, but all the while hopes the son will resist the temptation. In this context, חטה is also related linguistically to נטה, נטי in Binyan Hifal (חיטה) like is brought in Jastrow.</p>\n<p>And see also Sefer Kehillat Yaacov by Rabbi Yaacov Tzvi Yolles in relation to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=309&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">קדר</a> That as pointed out in Jastrow, קרדונין is also understood as קדרינון, meaning קדר ינון, the <em>Darkness of Yinon</em>.

    "title": "Z'man of Rabbeinu Tam - when does science determine a psak?",
    "content": "# Z'man of Rabbeinu Tam - when does science determine a psak?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently read a very well-researched sefer about the machlokes Rabbeinu Tam and the Gaonim about when is tzeis hakochavim: When does halachic night begin, 72 minutes after sunset or when the sun gets a certain angle below the horizon? The sefer is, <em><a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1957579129\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Great Z'manim Debate</a></em>, by Rabbi Aharon Notis. I knew a lot of the astronomy, but he did a very good job of presenting exactly how different parts of the astronomical issues play a role in helping decide various parts of the halachic issues. Alos hashachar, tzeis, shaos zmanios according to the Vilna Gaon and Magen Avraham...<br />\nThe author of the sefer has a very clear point of view, roughly described by a quote he brings (p. 179) from Rav Yisrael Yaakov Fisher z\"l of Yerushalayim. He was asked by a talmid chacham from Lakewood why he is not machmir for Rabbeinu Tam's opinion at all - even for Shabbos or Yom Kippur. Rav Fisher answered, \"Rabbeinu Tam was shlugged up.\"<br />\nIn other words, the author holds (along w Rav Fisher and I guess the Vilna Gaon), that since the astronomical understanding clearly proves that the opinion the Gaonim is correct, and that Rabbeinu Tam is wrong, we do not need to take Rabbeinu Tam into account at all.<br />\nNote that this is even though many Rishonim held like Rabbeinu Tam, including many Ba'alei Tosefos, the Ramban, the Shulchan Aruch and Rema - and many Acharonim. The author and these poskim understand that scientific proof is different than halachic understanding; once the science is settled, the halachic issue is completely settled as well.</p>\n<p>So my question: Let us <em>assume</em> that the science here is completely settled, that we know for sure that the Gaonim (and other Rishonim like the Rambam and others) are absolutely correct on the science. <em>Assuming</em> that is so, does it settle the halachic issue? Or are there poskim who hold, \"We don't have a Sanhedrin yet, and any p'sak by the Shulchan Aruch is going to be binding until we do. Whatever the reason they decided, we cannot ignore their p'sak no matter what we know to be true, for they have authority and we do not.\" Something like that.<br />\n[This is not exactly the same question as what to do about בעי כינים, because (a) that is a p'sak of the Gemara, not Rishonim, which lends it more authority, and (b) there we don't know for sure what the gemara is saying, only how some Rishonim understood it. One can try to find new ways to understand the gemara. Again, my question is assuming that we cannot do that with the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam.]</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Do religious non-Jews have divine sparks only they can raise?",
    "content": "# Do religious non-Jews have divine sparks only they can raise?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a conversation with a Chabad rabbi, he brought up that all items, including items Jews may not associate with, have divine sparks in them. As an example, he said that a cheeseburger has divine sparks in it, but a Jew cannot raise those divine sparks by eating it. However, he then said (paraphrasing but as close as I can manage) that \"One advantage non-Jews have over Jews is that they can eat a cheeseburger and, if they use the energy in the service of God, they can raise the divine sparks.\" (He distinctly referred to it as an <em>advantage</em>, I remember this). We have rules about how we interact with the world around us that non-Jews do not, and what is banned to us is allowed to them (with exceptions, of course).</p>\n<p>This leads to the question: Consider, for example, a devout Muslim, who keeps strictly halal. One day, the Muslim - for whatever reason - deliberately breaks this rule and eats a cheeseburger with bacon, without anyone's life being at stake. They use the energy in the service of God. On the one hand, this Muslim is not subject to kashrus and as long as they follow the Noahide laws, we as Jews are not directly concerned with their dietary habits, so would be able to raise the sparks. On the other hand, in the same way that we have divine sparks that we can access and others we cannot, the Muslim also has dietary restrictions in the service of God, and because they just violated them, may <em>not</em> be able to raise those sparks, because just as Jews have restrictions on how they may interact with the world, so do Muslims.</p>\n<p>The implications of this question are large. If it is case 1, that Noahide laws are all that matter, it follows that religions other than Judaism are \"not important\". They can follow their laws, they can break their laws, it's of no great concern to us. If it is case 2, then it's just the opposite. There would be divine sparks only Hindis can raise, divine sparks only Muslims can raise, divine sparks only Shintoists can raise. It lends great validity to those other actions - regardless of whether their beliefs about God are objectively \"right\", by acting within the restrictions and traditions those religious beliefs place on their lives, they become able to, or unable to, raise certain sparks. Or, in other words, if case 2 is correct, all religions of the world would be required to bring Moshiach.</p>\n<p>So which is it? Can non-Jews raise divine sparks particular to their practices and beliefs, or is it simply Jews and non-Jews? The answer to this is extremely important for how we as Jews relate to, and acknowledge the validity of, followers of other religions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rambam says in Melachim uMilchamot - Chapter 8 (11)</p>\n<p>Anyone who accepts upon himself the fulfillment of these seven mitzvot and is precise in their observance is considered one of 'the pious among the gentiles' and will merit a share in the world to come.</p>\n<p>This applies only when he accepts them and fulfills them because the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded them in the Torah and informed us through Moses, our teacher, that Noah's descendants had been commanded to fulfill them previously.</p>\n<p>However, if he fulfills them out of intellectual conviction, he is not a resident alien, nor of 'the pious among the gentiles,' nor of their wise men.</p>\n<p>The Rambam in Hilchot Melachim 10:9 writes:</p>\n<p>The general principle governing these matters is: They are not to be allowed to originate a new religion or create mitzvot for themselves based on their own decisions. They may either become righteous converts and accept all the mitzvot or retain their statutes without adding or detracting from them.</p>\n<p>(They are allowed to take on more Jewish mitzot with some exceptions as the Rambam continues and they must be performed accurately. This may lead to conversion).</p>\n<p>According to Sefer Sheva Mitsvos Hashem vol I, Perek 3 (which deals with the prohibition of creating a new religion) they are forbidden both to add or subtract.</p>\n<p>Regarding the concept that a non Jew can elevate sparks.</p>\n<p>What is it to elevate sparks?</p>\n<p>This is a kabbalistic/chassidic concept that there was an event figuratively called 'the shattering of the vessels' that caused sparks of light to explode out and leave the realm of kedusha (holiness) and falling into the four impure husks of the sitra achra (other side).</p>\n<p>I would contend that while well intentioned the Rabbi was not quite accurate, although there is one situation he may be right.</p>\n<p>Tanya (seminal work of Chassidus) explains that a Jew has two souls. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7881/jewish/Chapter-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 2, Likutey Amarim</a></p>\n<p>The second, godly soul is what elevates sparks.</p>\n<p>Out of the four impure husks, there is one that is neither inherently good or bad. It is intermediate. It is called klipas nogah.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/search/keyword_cdo/kid/10954/jewish/Kelipat-Nogah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Definition here</a></p>\n<p>All Noahides come from klipas nogah.\nAll converts come from klipas nogah.</p>\n<p>As a person ascends closer to kedusha, to the point they may cross over into kedusha through conversion, they become like a high priest according to their place.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless they are still on the \"other side.\" Therefore any sparks consumed there cannot be elevated to kedusha <em>unless that person eventually converts.</em> As the food one eats becomes a part of them the eventually conversion in a sense elevates these sparks as the person will be using that body to serve HaShem.</p>\n<p>Yet there is a story in the book 'Bnei Avraham Ahuvecha: Gerim in Chassidic Thought (Dov ben Avraham, the Breslov Institute) about a convert who was put to death as a martyr, who had rejoices in his Jewish soul but explained how he had lamented over his goyish body and desire to be freed from it. Sometimes the past leaves a residue that can be hard to overcome. Those traif foods dull the mind and make it harder to learn.</p>\n<p>Rebbe Nachman of Breslov said,\n\"Although a ger has a body that is not very holy, he has a soul that comes from a very lofty place. The ger must focus on the final outcome, his soul, and not on the fact he was formed from an impure drop of seed.\" Likutey Moharan II:33</p>\n<p>\"The soul of a Jew is a \"portion of God above.\" The holy books explain that this is an actual portion. Once a ger completes his geirus, he separates the life force of his body and soul from the Other Side and attaches it to God.\" (Likutey Moharan v'Toldos Levi ben Yitzchok. Megillas Rus)</p>\n<p>By definition, it is the job of a Jew specifically to elevate sparks which means to extract the good trapped within the other side, and incorporate it into oneself, thus elevating it to kedusha, where the godly soul of a Jew exists.</p>\n<p>\"The Sages of the Talmud taught that prospective gerim (converts) will not be accepted in the days of the Messiah. One reason for this is connected to the statement that,  unlike the Egyltian exile, there will be no need for thr Jewish people to leave this Exile in haste - this is because all the sparks of holiness that the Jews are in Exile to elevate will have been elevated.</p>\n<p>When in Egypt, the Jewish people were commanded to leave in great haste as soon as all the sparks there had been elevated, and to travel to other locations to continue this work. However, once the last spark in thr world is elevated, there will be no place else for the Jewish people to hurry to, and they will then leave Exile calmly and peacefully.\" (Kesser Torah, Parshas Vayigash, cited on p. 53 of Bnei Avraham Ahuvecha: Gerim in Chassidic Thought).</p>\n<p>One more thing, the Lubavitcher Rebbe said, \"Bring me lights of chaos in vessels of rectification.\"</p>\n<p>The lights of chaos have to do with Edom and the sitra achra while vessels of rectification refer to Torah.</p>\n<p>Certainly the only reason for the continued existence of the false religions is only because of the existence of holy sparks entrapped within them. Mundane ideas that are neither fundamentally good nor bad but have a holy use within the framework of Judaism.</p>\n<p>It is certainly not the case that these religions are kosher or one can whitewash something with a fundamentally corrupt source, but one of the reasons for delayed geulah (redemption) is to give us the time to extract all the remaining good trapped in the world that can be used in the Holy \"vessels\" of Torah. Light that can be contained without causing another shattering event.</p>\n<p>When all those sparks are extract, by Jews, both born and converts, then there will be peace on earth and everyone will know and understand. The nations will say, \"We have inherited lies\" (See Jeremiah 6:19-21).</p>\n\n\n",

It's always the same answer: Bishvil Yisrael nivra olam. We are who He does it for, we are His people, the apple of His Eye, His Ta'anug in being King (His inner will, as mentioned by Dov). So will He be crowned this year into a \"chore\" of ruling a world that doesn't recognise or care about Him (which is covered by His outer will), or will it be His Simcha and a pleasure to be crowned King by His beloved people?

    "content": "# Is the use of beads as a meditation tool acceptable if they aren't an item of idolatry?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Beads have a history of use in different religions. They also have a general use in human society as a whole detached from religion.</p>\n<p>One simple example of the nonreligious version is the Greek Komboloi (\"Greek Worry Beads\")</p>\n<p>My question is simple. If a Jew found benefit from using beads to fidget or in meditation, is there anything which makes it a problem if the beads themselves are non-religious?</p>\n<p>Does Halacha ban such things or is it acceptable if the item is non-religious and simply a tool of worry/exercise?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Any object or gesture that has been used ever before in any type of connection with <em>avodah zarah</em>/idolatry, at any level whatsoever (i.e., even <em>avak</em>/the dust of idolatry, the minimum level), is forbidden to a Jew to use. This is so because even in the case that the particular idolatry is no longer practiced today, the object or gesture once used remains a portal to the spiritual level of that idolatry. And when a person uses it in any fashion or imitates the gesture once used, the nefarious force is then strengthened, G-d forbid.</p>\n<p>====================</p>\n<p>I would like to clarify an important point here: Better than \"Any object or gesture\", it should read \"Any object with a gesture\". The matter is this. The receptive nature of the lower dimensional plane (i.e. <em>ha-aretz</em>) we understand and live makes its attraction toward the higher plane (i.e. <em>ha-shamayim</em>) magnetic, which entails an immediate connection under the right conditions. Therefore, let us take the example of an <em>avodah zarah</em> mentioned by the master, <em>R' Moshe David Valle</em> (1697-1777), <em>al HaTorah</em>, the <em>talmid muvak</em> of the <em>Ramchal</em>, when a person would tip his hat towards an idol as a form of worshiping it. Now, in our contemporary world, tipping of the hat is a conventional gesture of politeness. This custom has the same origin as a military salute. To tip, barely lift the hat, or respectfully touching of the brim with a nod of the head. Although this is no longer a form of <em>avodah zarah</em>, and the precise form of hat tipping may not even be documented anywhere, if a person tips his hat in the precise and exact form that this \"object and gesture\" were once used in ancient days for idolatry, due to the spiritual law of magnetic attraction, he would form a \"link\" (i.e., open a spiritual fissure) to the negative force that once used these material object with the gesture to be strengthened, <em>chaz v'shalom</em>. This is so even though the event occurred inadvertently. Know that this is also true for positive attractions. For instance, the <em>Ari\"zal</em> explaining the second condition for a <em>gilui maggid</em> says: או אם יהיה שעשה האיש הזה איזו מצוה, כפי גדר הצדיק ההוא. וע״י אהד משני תנאים אלו, יבא וישרה עליו ע׳יד הנזכר \"Or it might be if this man observed some precepts that are comparable to the height of that righteous. Through one of these two conditions, he will come and rule on him, as we have explained\" (<em>Sha'ar Ruach HaKodesh</em>, <em>daf</em> 10). That is, the person can (magnetically) attract <em>b'sod ibbur</em> a <em>tzadik</em>'s <em>ruach</em> by performing in the precise and exact form that this \"object and gesture\" were once used in ancient days for a <em>mitzvah</em>. This matter is long and I cannot explore all of its facets here, but I think now it becomes clearer the danger of using certain objects, especially for spiritual matters such as meditation. For it is in that frame of mind, so to speak, that potentially damaging forces can be attracted to individuals by the law of magnetic resonance. If someone opens their mind to being influenced, then no matter where they are, a shed can be drawn to them instantaneously, and so on. See, while <em>Hovat Mitzvat HaDevekut</em> is perhaps the greatest of the <em>mitzvot</em> (since שויתי ה' לנגדי תמיד), unfortunately nowadays, most Jews have no idea whatsoever what this really means and how to perform it in the correct <em>Torah</em> way. That being so, there is great danger in practicing meditation and even doing so through the means of an \"alien to <em>Torah</em>\" object that has been used (and continues to do so in our contemporary reality) for <em>avodah zarah</em>. Opportunistic forces can easily be drawn to the person doing so upon the inadvertent error of using this object while attempting, ignorantly so, to \"meditate\", that is, to connect to the higher plane. Thus, even through any cat or any tree (as our colleagues here have suggested), such a link to a nefarious force can be established upon the right condition, as it has been explained briefly here. Now, going to the level of halacha, we also learn something else very important I mentioned in my comments. According to <em>halacha</em>, an item does not acquire any form of sanctity or prominence simply by virtue of it being designated for a particular use. For example, if one were to designate an item to be used for a <em>mitzvah</em>, such as a myrtle or willow branch to be used as part of the <em>Lulav</em> bundle, it would not acquire any sanctity until it is actually used for that purpose. One may also retract and redesignate an item for any purpose, as long as it was not yet used. This concept is referred to as \"<em>hazmana lav milta</em>\" in <em>halachic</em> literature, which means that one’s designation of something for a ritual purpose is <em>halachically</em> meaningless and inconsequential (see <em>Talmud</em>, <em>Sanhedrin</em> 47b). In fact, the <em>Talmud</em> teaches that an animal that was designated for idolatry may later be used as a sacrifice in the <em>Beit Hamikdash</em> if it was not actually used for an idolatrous purpose (see <em>Talmud</em>, <em>Temura</em> 29a; <em>Rambam</em>, <em>Hilchot Isurei Mizbei’ach</em> 4:4). This translates into the fact that if and only if, the person uses any object that was used for <em>avodah zarah</em>, but the person does not imitate the gesture used to activate the nefarious force behind the <em>avodah zarah</em>, there is no harm at all in using such object. But do you want to risk it? As such, it is best to avoid using objects that have knowingly been used historically in the practice of idolatry, such as beads, etc. I sincerely hope this brief summary of my original ideas serves the community better, my sole intention, with G-d's help.</p>\n\n\n",

Please provide sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The intention of seeing the 10 plagues to completion and hardening Paro's heart was in order to convince the <em>Egyptians</em> that Hashem is the true and only God (sources below). It's hard to fathom how steeped in Avoda Zara the Egyptians were, and the sources discuss at length how each and every detail (including Midrashic details) were part of the plan to leave the Egyptians without any shadow of a doubt that Hashem is the one and only true God. I strongly recommend Let My Nation Go by Yosef Deutsch who gathers them and provides many many sources, covering almost every conceivable detail and question on the matter.</p>\n<p>A quick example or two, during the maka of the death of the first born, even first born animals died in order to dispel any possibility that they might claim their own gods (animals) brought the maka upon them (Rashi from Mechilta, Bo, 11:5). Also, Egyptians in other countries also lost first borns, as well as non-Egyptians visiting Egypt at the time, so they couldn't blame it on the gods of other nations (see Rashi on Shemot 12:29). As we can see, even by the 10th plague, there were still so many \"loose ends\" for Hashem to tie up in order to de-facto demonstrate He is the only power.</p>\n<p>There's also the point that the plagues are midda k'negged midda punishments for the Egyptians for what they did to the Jews. See Sforno. Therefore, they had to be seen to completion in order for the justice to be completed.</p>\n<p>See also Lekach Tov Va'era 9:13, Haggada Maaseh Nisim and many other Haggadas, including Rav Tzadok HaKohen M'Lublin's about the idea that the 10 plagues were k'negged the 10 statements by which the world was created bishvil Yisrael, against the nation who oppressed Yisrael, so the <em>din</em> behind this also needed to be completed.</p>\n<p>Zohar parashat Bo, Sifrei Haazinu, Malbim Va'era 7:14 bring that the plagues, as stated above, were to methodically demonstrate to the Egyptians that Hashem was the Almighty Ruler of the universe, to glorify and sanctify Hashem's Name. In my experience, this is the main reason given in sources. I remember a great shiur as well on this, I'll edit it in if I find it.</p>\n<p>The reason the Jews had to stay around for this is in part for their own delight in seeing the great miracles happening on their behalf. See Shemot Rabbah 15:27, and Avot D'Rebbe Natan 33. The main reason though, of course, is that if they had been let go, there would be no further reason to bring the signs, which needed to be brought to completion for the above stated reasons.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I think I found the shiur I mentioned above, and\nit is a quick plain language (no sources) explanation, along the same lines as above, of how the makkot were k'negged the sefirot, and the reason for that is because only Hashem is the true King (Malchut), and so on with all the sefirot, and this needed to be demonstrated to show how Hashem is the true and only God.

Whether it be our shabbat host, or our shul or yeshiva, the point is, someone else is paying for the water. It's common for water rates to be set by usage by volume.</p>\n<p>In some countries where yidden live, as well as in Talmudic times, water is/was likely in many cases far more expensive/labour intensive than it is compared to nowadays, in first world countries with indoor plumbing and abundant cheap clean water (Hodu laShem ki tov). Even in first world countries, even if it is less than a pruta, there is what to consider<sup>1</sup>. It might be ok if it is generally people don't mind and it is less than a pruta<sup>2</sup>, but it is still better not to<sup>3</sup> (which would certainly be something that can affect the fulfilment of a segula)</p>\n<p>Therefore, it's quite ironic to consider taking more water than necessary to secure a segula for wealth when someone else is paying for that water!</p>\n<p>Is there any discussion of this? Does this segula only apply when it's your own water? I believe the story in the Zohar might imply that (i.e. the reward for using extra water to keep the halachot as meticulously as possible, even though it costs you more money, your reward is, poetically, wealth). Or perhaps this segula will extend to our host and we should do so for their sake? Or perhaps we are simply to assume that our host would wish us to use more water in order to guarantee we fulfil the halacha meticulously, segula aside.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, does anyone discuss this?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 Shulchan Aruch CM 348:1, Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 182:1</sup><br />\n<sup>2 Shulchan Aruch CM 359:1, Kitzur Shulchan Aruch CM 182:1</sup><br />\n<sup>3 Rama 359:1</sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If one wishes to take on chumrot, or segulot, or mystical practices, to what extent is one allowed to negatively impact others to do so?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have two examples. This starts with an answer from a recent question I asked, where it was mentioned that the Rosh was careful to wash last so that he shouldn't avoid talking or waiting between netila and hamotzi.</p>\n<p>In this case, the Rosh was ensuring his own spiritual well being at the inevitable expense of others. I am not being chutzpadik, I am genuinely asking: is there some explanation of why this was his decision? Perhaps my reasoning is wrong, and he was actually trying to set an example, knowing that people watched his actions because he was...well... the Rosh.</p>\n<p>The second case is a personal experience I once had whereby I was davening shacharit in a minyan led by a great, authentic Mekubal. He was particular that nobody would daven within a huge radius around him during Shmona Esrei, and set up a barricade of chairs to prevent people from entering that space.</p>\n<p>I was planning a long davening that day, and I didn't want to inconvenience someone in front of me from being able to take their 3 steps back. I, being very absent-minded, started migrating to the front after standing, and ended up crossing that boundary. After he had already said the bracha of גָּאַל יִשְׂרָאֵל, he spotted me and came and pushed me out of the boundary, and then returned and began עמידה. I remember being very embarrased, and I have always wondered if keeping that particular stringency that he took upon himself was more important than embarrassing someone.</p>\n<p>So, with these two examples in mind, the question in the title is asked.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A couple of bonus questions, that I will turn into their own questions if someone could comment that they are good questions (they may be non-starters):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Would we say that the Rosh was choosing a personal stringency over a halacha, given that it seems to be that halacha states that the most important person should wash first (perhaps he didn't hold by this halacha)</li>\n<li>Would we say that this Mekubal was keeping a mystical practice at the expense of halacha (hefsek bein geula l'tfila, and embarrassing someone in public)?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is an important question. Thank you for that. In my <em>de'ah</em>, <em>chumrot</em> are valid only from the sources I have elected as being in resonance with my ideals, to wit, my <em>neshama</em>. For me, these happened to be the <em>Ari\"zal</em> and <em>Rashash</em>, that's it pretty much (save a few exceptions). Incidentally, the related <em>chumrah</em> from your story does not follow the <em>Ari\"zal</em> at all. Now, I would never impose on anyone, least of which my family or other <em>yidim</em> anything I have received as \"proper <em>chumrot</em>\". Truly, I would gladly forfeit a <em>chumrah</em> in pro of somebody else's <em>shalom</em>, which is of a higher value to me. For they are strictly personal and in my understanding, I must not impose on anyone else no matter what. At last, regarding your point on <em>hefsek bein geula l'tfila</em> sourced in <em>Shulchan Aruch OH</em> 111:1, I believe he did not think it was a <em>hefsek</em> at all, and while I agree it was not <em>al pi halacha</em>, nevertheless it was indeed a \"breach\" in <em>devekut</em>, which <em>b'ruchniyut</em> is even worst! <em>Kol tuv</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Then, it flows towards the Dead Sea and then to the Mediterranean Sea. <strong>Its healing touch would turn the salt of the water into sweet water</strong></li>\n<li>Before the new river emerging, the quality of the waters mentioned above, would be bad, in that it would not be suitable for living creatures. For example, take the Dead Sea at this very moment. The amount of salt in it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(9,6 times more than the ocean)</a>, prevents plants and animals (fish) for flourishing, hence the name. When the new rivers flows through these sites, the water transforms  and becomes sweet, e.g. it is possible to sustain life again.This is why fisherman will stand by and waiting to harvest the stream's bounty.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is, however, a Midrashic approach to this. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.14.8?lang=bi&with=Pirkei%20DeRabbi%20Eliezer&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer (35:3)</a>, it tells us that in the future, e.g. \"on that day\" which the prophets refers to, the well will show up in Yerushalayim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This refers to the well which will arise in Jerusalem in the future, and will water all its surroundings. Because they found (the well) seven times, he called it Shib'ah (seven).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Meir Leibush ben Yehiel Michel Wisser, also known as the Malbim, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zechariah.14.8?lang=bi&with=Malbim%20on%20Zechariah%7CQuoting&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">has a different approach</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On that day a spring shall be opened – According to the plain meaning , in that at this time there will be no springs found in Jerusalem and then a source of living water will be opened up, which will be reserved for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem for purifying waters to purify with and for the waters of the ashes of the red heifer. Ezekiel already saw this in a prophetic vision when he saw a great stream issuing from the Holy of Holies, spreading out to the eastern and western seas. So too prophesied Zechariah “And on that day,living waters will go out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and half of them toward the western…” (Zechariah 14:8) This will be after the final war of Gog and Magog when the stream will overflow with so much abundance, but after first war of Gog and Magog, which is being discussed here, the water will not spread outwards and will be only for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. I have already explained in my commentary on Ezekiel that this is a metaphoric representation of the spreading forth of the waters of knowledge and the stream of Torah and faith, which are compared to water. After the first war, the waters of knowledge will begin to spread out from the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and remove the sin of external consciousness and to purify the impurity of foolishness, stupidity and false belief and every trace of idolatry as is explained shortly. “It will come to pass on that day that I will cut off all the names of the idols from the land…” (Zechariah 13:2) This is an explanation of the nature of this source and its faithful waters that flow from the upwelling of wisdom and holy consciousness. After the final war of Gog and Magog the waters will spread outwards and “the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” (Isaiah 11:9) On this it says “And on that day living waters will go out from Jerusalem…and the Lord shall be king over all the earth…” (Zechariah 14:8-9) This is the meaning of the ‘water,’ that everyone will recognize the unity of the Creator and the truth of divinity. This itself is the water which Ezekiel saw, as I explained there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Pharaoh think he was G-d unless he could do things G-d could do? Could Pharaoh make man, on an outer level?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Like for example, G-d creates human beings. Could Pharaoh create human beings too such that he would believe he was G-d? G-d can also create all types of human beings. If Pharaoh could create Egyptians but not Jews, wouldn't that prove to him he wasn't G-d? Or could he in fact do that? Of course only Hashem can create a Jew's soul and essence but could Pharaoh create people's bodies in an exilic, kelipah state, so to speak, that he would think he was G-d? Shemos teaches that Klal Yisrael were created as a people in the iron furnace of Egypt, so I'm wondering if there is a level of interpretation where Pharaoh was involved in actually creating the people of that generation, including Klal Yisrael, on the surface level, but that he deceived himself as far as thinking he created their souls and essences too when of course he didn't?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Go to YouTube, Look at the videos from history channel, or from discovery, they will paint you a very different picture of how the biblical times actually were, specifically from the Egyptians point of view.</p>\n<p>They were masters of vibrations, magic, mental manipulation, they were connected to a higher awareness (that can be achieved today) If you also read the meam-loez on genesis you can get a greater insight as well.</p>\n<p>Pretty much everything that could be done would be done. One of the reasons sex was very rampant in Egypt is because they are using areas of the brain that is responsible for the hormonal effects in the body, as well is responsible for success in your life,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Ventral Tegmental Area Dopamine Cell Activation during Male Rat Sexual Behavior Regulates Neuroplasticity and d-Amphetamine Cross-Sensitization following Sex Abstinence,\"(Beloate, L. N., Omrani, A., Adan, R. A., Webb, I. C., Coolen, L. M. (2016).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While in a state meditation that can be applied while living your regal daily life.</p>\n<p>Why would that information be important?</p>\n<p>Avoda ZARA the word zara can connote to zera = life, studying Kabbala and basic magic you will learn that in order to perform magic or anything in the sense you would need to tap in too a life force, interior or exterior, the goal is to get a balance of both,</p>\n<p>(Tora in the correct settings or formula, will bring you to white magic)</p>\n<p>hence why every success coach or trainer will say, new energy equals a new life,  or you need to bring life into you to be successful, aka, you need to activate the above parts of the brain, that can be done with extreme/intense thought, sex, or with exercise.</p>\n<p>Manipulation of the energy is key,</p>\n<p>Now we know that size matters in the world, (not if your seeing the world plainly) as plain physics dictates, the larger object would attract/pull/draw (in comparison to) the smaller objects. This is seen in with people as well, night clubs, concerts anywhere where there's a large group of people, this is why men have a thing about size as they might loose their girl (granted if the girl is weak or un-loyal increasing the odds of her leaving), now we know everything is intention, so if you use your size to drawdown to you the energy of wisdom, wealth, health, power etc, you can even change the direction of energy flow in your favor, change the mood of the area that your in, and lead with compassion, just, wisdom, you will be doing something good, as Moshe told Arron after being confronted by korach, speak softly though be the man with a big staff (along those lines), another indication size matters, moshe himself was thought to be a giant.</p>\n<p>Going back to Pharo, Now that you know something new and how size matters in everything, gives a new insight on the pyramids the sphinx and so on. Pharo now mastered everything we have learned, he saved the largest men for guards not only for intimidation, though also for mental manipulation, imagine controlling tens of thousands of people without marketing, television, cell phones, etc at the same time being the smartest in the country, as well as communicating with other deities, pretty g-d like I would say.</p>\n<p>ALSO recall avoda zara connoting to avoda zera, they were worshiping pharos energy and systems he uses to manipulate, so we don't mean g-d like the infinite one, the creator of the universe, think of it like a superhero in comparison to a regular human, remember avoda-zara came from worshiping other deities or other (life = zera)energies with great power.</p>\n<p>You can argue they have their own g-ds. Yes they do, though this does not contradict anything, as we mentioned earlier, they were in communication with other deities. If you want to think of it like a world leader as the only individual that may communicate with an angle that looks like a g-d, then using the information to impress millions, as a g-d himself, I can heal, walk on water, read your mind, predict your future, light a candle wick on fire with my energy, I can withstand/hold raw fire... I can fly, I can bring the dead back to lifer I can kill without cause. As you can see I am merely mentioning the simple things i'm sure you can think of more extreme talents, earth quakes, destructions of countries, plagues. like a super hero or villain.</p>\n<p>Now you can again argue, that I  don't have  proof of such behavior from that time, and we only know of them worshiping and not manipulating as mentioned. Besides the tora mentioning in parasha Vayera, this weeks parasha, (Jan-19-23), that pharo asked his magicians to replicate what they could and they did until the fifth Aliya.</p>\n<p>Below you have some links that will explain more the matter.</p>\n<p>Ellison, T.

There are four different reasons given.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara asks: Why must one not wipe himself with his right hand,\nbut with his left? Rava said: Because the Torah was given with the\nright hand, as it is stated: “At His right hand was a fiery law unto\nthem” (Deuteronomy 33:2). Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Because the right\nhand is close to the mouth, i.e., people eat with the right hand.

    "content": "# וכבשוה ורדו - to what extent are we allowed to domesticate/kill animals in order to utilise the Earth for our civilisation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Part of the point of Hashem giving the Earth into our domain is a permission for us to trap, subjugate and kill animals that would harm us or be pests for our crops and homes, e.g. see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Genesis.1.28.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno 1 & 2</a> to Bereshit 1:28, as well as Ramban on 29:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"And subdue it:\"</strong> He gave them the power and rulership over the earth; to do whatever they wanted with the beasts and the swarming animals and all of those that slither on the ground; and to build and to uproot and plant and to quarry copper from its hills and [to do things] similar to this. And this is [all] included in its stating (above, verse 26), \"and over all the earth.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are there limits on this? Should we <em>try</em> to avoid it? Is there a thorough treatment of this inyan anywhere?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My answer is based solely from Tanakh as this question is about the intentions of God, rather than p'sak halakhah. I will also state that I interpret Tanakh using Jewish commentaries with an intention of finding internal consistency with Tanakh. So for example, if Rambam says a lot of stories in Tanakh are dreams, and this commentary requires a lot of reinterpreting of stories, a lot of further commentary on stories, and an explanation as to why the characters in stories don't perceive these events as dreams, then I would not accept Rambam's premise. My focus would be to understand the stories in the way the Tanakh itself, or the characters in Tanakh, relate to the stories.</p>\n<p>So God provides dominion over the earth to humans in Genesis 1:28. The best way to understand God's intentions is to look for hints in the story itself and all closest stories to this event to see what we can glean. Here's what I've noticed.</p>\n<p>1 - We never hear about Adam and Eve killing animals for any reason, even when they are naked they make clothes out of plants, it's God Himself who provides skin coverings. This makes me think that God did not intend for humans to kill animals for their needs, or at the very least, makes me think that Adam and Eve did not think God intended for them to kill animals for any reason.</p>\n<p>2 - God parades animals before Adam for him to name them, and potentially choose a mate. I'm not going to pretend that I understand all of God's intentions here, but I see no evidence of killing animals for mankind's needs.</p>\n<p>3 - Adam and Eve don't seem freaked out by the snake talking. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/115467/9045\">Moshav Zekeinim brings the comment that humans and animals all spoke Hebrew until the tower of Babel.</a> I find this commentary to be credible as it allows me to read all stories of animals talking without needing additional commentaries, explanations, interpretations, etc. If this commentary is true, mankind's subjugation could have been devoid of any trapping of animals. Instead, Adam and Eve would be able to talk to animals, and <em>then ask them</em> \"to build and to uproot and plant and to quarry copper from its hills and [to do things] similar to this. And this is [all] included in its stating (above, verse 26), \"and over all the earth.\"\" It is my opinion that farm animals are definitely what God intended with dominion. I say this because God establishes many laws about taking care of farm animals, on how they should be treated while they're working, etc etc.</p>\n<p>4 - Cain and Able are the next animal story as Able sacrifices animals. It's worth mentioning that Rabbi Albo thinks that Cain thought animal sacrifice was a sin, and therefore was appalled that God would accept the sacrifice of Able. This lends further evidence toward the idea that mankind did not see violence or the killing of animals as something God intended for mankind's dominion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Why did God not look favorably on Cain’s offering of his field\nproduce? The answer is that Cain had grown up watching his father Adam\ntoil and sweat to farm his land, surviving on vegetables alone as God\nhad forbade him and his family to eat meat. Cain himself became a\nfarmer, because he believed that there could be no distinction between\nthe human and the animal, except in the fact that the human must work\nfor his produce, whereas the animals simply took what was wild.\nHowever, because both humans and animals both ate the same foodstuff,\nCain reasoned that they where essentially at the same spiritual level.\nThus Cain brought an offering from his field, and was appalled at the\nidea of an animal sacrifice. Cain’s notion of equality between humans\nand animals eventually led him to murder his brother, for he saw Abel\nkill an animal for a sacrifice, and reasoned that if a human can kill\nan animal, than a human can kill another human…Thus God allowed Noah\nto eat animals to reintroduce the moral distinction between the animal\nand the human.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/115782.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/115782.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n<p>5 - After the flood of Noah, mankind is finally given permission to eat animals, and it's the first time the discussion of killing animals as a concept is detailed in scripture. But despite permission being given, this permission comes with a new instinct for animals. Animals will now, for the first time EVER, be afraid of humans. Before this, trapping an animal would have been simple as walking up to it and tying a rope around it. If you're telling me God's intention was always for us to have to use force to subjugate animals, then this \"instinct of fear\" should have been given to animals in the beginning, but it wasn't.</p>\n<p>Based on all these small details we see in the text regarding humans and animals, I do not see the intentions you outlined at the beginning of your question. I do not claim to speak for God, so I won't say what God truly intended. But I do find a lack of Biblical support for \"Part of the point of Hashem giving the Earth into our domain is a permission for us to trap, subjugate and kill animals that would harm us or be pests for our crops and homes\"</p>\n<p>Based on everything I've outlined in scripture, I would choose  to interpret \" ורדו/subjugation\" as employ. God made animals friendly to us, maybe even made them able to talk with us, and even in later years made rules about how to be good employers to animals (not yoking two different animals, not muzzling an animal who's working so they can eat while they work, etc etc). It seems to me that at the beginning, Adam and Eve interpreted God as wanting us to get along with, and employ animals for our purposes for raising food and resources. This subjugation required no force and no shedding of blood. If I could pick some modern categories, I think seeing eye dogs, rats that find land mines, and any animals that are trained peacefully for the well being of humans, are the closest examples of this subjugation/employment.</p>\n<p>But the overall reality is this peaceful subjugation dynamic between humans and animals changes after the flood, and might further change after the tower of Babel. After those events, I do not think humans are capable of subjugating animals in the same way before. And at this point, the only way we can subjugate might be through force, violence, trapping, etc. But I would say this is different than what God intended, because again, it seems like God never even intended for animals to be scared of us for any reason.</p>\n<p>Update</p>\n<p>The OP asked the following to me in comments: \"How do you understand ה֚וּא יְשׁוּפְךָ֣ רֹ֔אשׁ וְאַתָּ֖ה תְּשׁוּפֶ֥נּוּ עָקֵֽב from 3:15\"</p>\n<p>I understand this literally. God/Scripture punishes the snake for <strong>betraying</strong> Adam and Eve. One thing to keep in mind about these stories is that they take certain things for granted. So for example, the story takes for granted that animals \"know\" they are supposed to eat plants and vegetables, just as God commanded them. The story also takes for granted that the animals know that humans are supposed to have dominion over them, which is why they go to Adam to be named. The story also takes for granted that when God commanded Adam not to eat from the tree, this was <em><strong>not private knowledge</strong></em>. Eve who is theoretically created later knows about this rule, <em>and so does the snake.</em> Because the snake knows that humans were given dominion by God, and because the snake was named by Adam and was passed over as a mate, and because the snake knows about the one negative commandment given to Adam, his actions are indeed a true betrayal. And because of this, God forces an unnatural enmity between humans and snakes, that does not exist amongst any other animals with humans. So after the Garden of Eden, humans have been given an instinct to attack snakes, and snakes attack humans, as a sign of this deep betrayal from the garden. If I had to take my guess, the snake wanted God to take away dominion from Adam and Eve and give it to the serpent. Which is why God punishes the snake to become the lowest and most cursed of beasts, as a consequence of him wanting to raise himself to the highest of beasts, befitting of his great cunningness (Genesis 3:1)</p>\n<p>One last comment I'll mention is that because animals are expected to know we have dominion, God makes it legal for us to kill animals that kill humans as stated in Genesis 6:</p>\n<p>\"וְאַ֨ךְ אֶת־דִּמְכֶ֤ם לְנַפְשֹֽׁתֵיכֶם֙ אֶדְרֹ֔שׁ מִיַּ֥ד כׇּל־חַיָּ֖ה אֶדְרְשֶׁ֑נּוּ וּמִיַּ֣ד הָֽאָדָ֗ם מִיַּד֙ אִ֣ישׁ אָחִ֔יו אֶדְרֹ֖שׁ אֶת־נֶ֥פֶשׁ הָֽאָדָֽם׃ But for your own life-blood I will require a reckoning: I will require it of every beast; of humankind, too, will I require a reckoning for human life, of everyone for each other!\nשֹׁפֵךְ֙ דַּ֣ם הָֽאָדָ֔ם בָּֽאָדָ֖ם דָּמ֣וֹ יִשָּׁפֵ֑ךְ כִּ֚י בְּצֶ֣לֶם אֱלֹהִ֔ים עָשָׂ֖ה אֶת־הָאָדָֽם׃ Whoever sheds human blood,\nBy human [hands] shall that one’s blood be shed;\nFor in the image of God\nWas humankind made. \"</p>\n<p>This text reads as if the animals are supposed to intrinsically understand that humans were made in the image of God and therefore they should have a tendency to avoid killing us. I imagine this viewpoint would be like great white sharks. We all know they can eat people, but the reality is sharks would prefer to eat anything other than humans first. We see that scripture views animals as having an understanding of the wrongness of killing humans because of the law of the goring ox.</p>\n<p>Exodus 21:28-29</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכִֽי־יִגַּ֨ח שׁ֥וֹר אֶת־אִ֛ישׁ א֥וֹ אֶת־אִשָּׁ֖ה וָמֵ֑ת סָק֨וֹל\nיִסָּקֵ֜ל הַשּׁ֗וֹר וְלֹ֤א יֵאָכֵל֙ אֶת־בְּשָׂר֔וֹ וּבַ֥עַל הַשּׁ֖וֹר\nנָקִֽי׃ When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be\nstoned and its flesh shall not be eaten, but the owner of the ox is\nnot to be punished. וְאִ֡ם שׁוֹר֩ נַגָּ֨ח ה֜וּא מִתְּמֹ֣ל שִׁלְשֹׁ֗ם\nוְהוּעַ֤ד בִּבְעָלָיו֙ וְלֹ֣א יִשְׁמְרֶ֔נּוּ וְהֵמִ֥ית אִ֖ישׁ א֣וֹ\nאִשָּׁ֑ה הַשּׁוֹר֙ יִסָּקֵ֔ל וְגַם־בְּעָלָ֖יו יוּמָֽת׃ If, however,\nthat ox has been in the habit of goring, and its owner, though warned,\nhas failed to guard it, and it kills a man or a woman—the ox shall be\nstoned and its owner, too, shall be put to death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How do we know the animal is supposed to know better? One piece of evidence is that this similar law exists in other near eastern law codes, but the animal is not put to death, it is seemingly free of culpability.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Two differences that stand out are that in the Torah, the offending\nanimal is killed and if the animal is a habitual gorer, the owner is\nkilled as well. The Babylonian codes never kill the ox or the owner.\nThe difference is grounded in the gravity with which the Torah views\nhomicide: according to Numbers 35:33, killing a person pollutes the\nland with bloodshed and so endangers those who reside there unless the\nmurderer is executed. This holds true even when the culpable party is\nnot human (Genesis 9:5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.thetorah.com/article/the-law-of-the-goring-ox-is-it-neutered\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.thetorah.com/article/the-law-of-the-goring-ox-is-it-neutered</a></p>\n<p>The other piece of evidence is that the very next pasuk discusses the human owner with two situations: The first situation is that the human owner doesn't know the animal will gore other humans, and therefore is free from punishment. The second situation is that the human owner knows better, and if they know better, they receive the same punishment as the bull.</p>\n\n\n",

I would like to build a case for both positions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I imagine a lot of it will come down to the judgement of the parent and the nature of the child. No one methodology is more superior, it is about חֲנֹ֣ךְ לַ֭נַּעַר עַל־פִּ֣י דַרְכּ֑וֹ - Educating the child according to his (individualised) way (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.22.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 22:6</a>)</p>\n<p>The education of our children is a very precious investment and is something that must be placed at the forefront of our priorities. It is about finding the balance that works best for the child. This idea is perhaps best illustrated with the following story related about Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman הי\"ד. R’ Elchonon was once in London to collect funds for his Yeshiva in Baranovitch. Before leaving, he was asked by his host to bless his son. R’ Elchonon turned to the man and said, “When the Chofetz Chaim was asked by people to bless their sons to be talmidei chachomim he would tell them that you have to be willing to sacrifice. A parent must be willing to give away the pillow under his head to pay for his child’s tuition.” R’ Elchonon then proceeded to learn with the boy the piece of gemara he was currently learning. Seeing that he did not fully understand that particular sugya, R’ Elchonon took time to teach it to the boy until he understood it fully. R’ Elchonon then turned to the host and exclaimed; “Now this is an accomplishment”.<sup>1</sup> We see from this powerful anecdote that the chinuch that our children receive is crucial. Whether it is attending a school vs homeschooling, the parents have to invest as their child's future is at stake. I don't think one option is better than the other, it is about finding a system that works best for the children. Some kids thrive if they have individual, personalised attention, others flourish if part of a classroom along with their peers.</p>\n<p>To begin to understand the schooling system, one needs to first understand why it serves the purpose it does.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.21a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 21a</a> famously outlines the progression of our educational system and praises Yehoshua ben Gamla, who without which,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"נשתכח תורה מישראל\"</p>\n<p>“The Torah would have been forgotten by Israel”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is because initially, the father would teach their child Torah, but all those without fathers would never receive a Torah education. As a result, the chachamim installed מלמדי תינוקות – teachers of young children in Yerushalayim ensuring that any youth could go and learn Torah. However, this did not prove to be a conclusive solution, since all those without fathers had no-one to take them to Yerushalayim. This resultantly led to the school system being expanded, whereby the local authorities instated teachers in every province. This too proved to have teething problems<sup>2</sup>, until Yehoshua ben Gamla ensured that teachers were placed in every district and town, and the townspeople were told to bring in their children, aged six or seven<sup>3</sup> to be taught by these teachers.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.245.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch</a> writes quite clearly that the onus is on the father. If a father is unable to teach his child, (which is the accepted norm nowadays, as most are either working or in full time learning,) he has an obligation to pay for his son to be taught.  One must ensure though, that this process is not rushed, and this approach extends to a child’s entry into school. The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.50a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos 50a</a> explains that Rav Shmuel bar Sheilas, a prominent teacher of young children, would not accept students until they were of age six and above. From this point onwards, he would “stuff them like an ox”, meaning he would infuse them with concentrated Torah study. The Gemara goes on to reason that if a child attends school before this age, the parent will always have to carefully monitor his child’s health as the learning will no doubt weaken him. The alternative understanding dictates that the young child will learn so much that his peers will seek to be like him, and they will become weakened as a result. It would stand to reason therefore, that the child’s entry into school must come at the right time. Failure to heed this call, will risk harming the child’s natural development.</p>\n<p>So, let's take a deep dive into specifics.</p>\n<p><strong>PROVIDING ATTENTION</strong></p>\n<p>As far as Torah learning, there is no doubt that in either scenario, a Rebbe has to give all of himself to the child/children. The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.19b.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 19b</a> famously writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי שמואל בר נחמני א״ר יונתן כל המלמד בן חבירו תורה מעלה עליו הכתוב כאילו ילדו שנאמר ואלה תולדות אהרן ומשה וכתיב ואלה שמות בני אהרן לומר לך אהרן ילד ומשה למד לפיכך נקראו על שמו</p>\n<p>Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmeini said in the name of Rabbi Yonason, any person who teaches Torah to the child of his fellow, the Torah considers it as if he were his own child. As it says, “And these are the generations of Aharon and Moshe” and it writes further, “And these are the names of the children of Aharon”, to teach you that Aharon bore them and Moshe taught them, therefore they are called by his name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, the Gemara is telling us that although Aharon’s four sons were biologically his, since Moshe taught them Torah they were also called by Moshe’s name.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, one can make the argument that it is infinitely easier for a Rebbi to go \"all in\" if he only has one child under his care vs a whole classroom. However, this too can be countered by noting that chazal set up standards to ensure that the classroom does not exceed the requisite number of kids.</p>\n<p>There is a predetermined teacher-to-student ratio within any one classroom. Rava famously ruled in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.21a.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 21a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סך מקרי דרדקי עשרין וחמשה ינוקי ואי איכא חמשין מותבינן תרי ואי איכא ארבעין מוקמינן ריש דוכנא ומסייעין ליה ממתא</p>\n<p>The number [of students that] teachers [have in their classes] is twenty-five children. If there are fifty, we install two [teachers]. If there are forty, we appoint an assistant teacher and [the teacher] is given support from the town [in order to help finance the cost of hiring an assistant].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is clear from this chazal that a delicate balance is to be maintained at all times. According to most Rishonim, twenty-five would represent the maximum number in which all the students would receive the requisite attention.<sup>5</sup> However, above this number, greater assistance is required in order to ensure that all the students have their educational needs met. Having said this though, the Tashbetz in his Sheilos Uteshuvos, argues that this maximum number of twenty-five students was not based on the students’ educational wellbeing but was rather established for the teacher’s benefit. He notes that a single teacher can actually be assigned a number of students well above this bracket of twenty-five. However, this is only provided it was fixed ahead of time. If this stipulation was not stated, then the teacher is within in his rights to limit the class to twenty-five, or to forty students providing he can hire an assistant. The provision of class size was fixed in order to allow the teacher of a large class the right to ask for greater assistance if the number of students in his class is too much for him to manage on his own.

How could people have “come up” with Avodah Zarah, when monotheism should have been brought down through the generations?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Hi and welcome to Mi Yodeya. The short answer is that people who never spoke to Hashem aren't necessarily going to believe others who claim they did. However, given that it was indeed so generationally close to Adam, I still agree it needs more explanation and so does the Rambam in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Foreign_Worship_and_Customs_of_the_Nations.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">first halachot of Avodah Zara in Mishneh Torah</a>.</p>\n<p>To summarise, first realise that this happened over several steps, over  a long time. As modern social media informs us, even in an age of unlimited access to information, people are still so easily convinced to totally get behind a philosophy, on the tiniest shreds of evidence and convincing. So the following is totally, utterly reasonable:</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: <em>Well intentioned-mistakes</em></strong>. People made a great mistake and decided that Hashem would want us to honour His honoured stars and planets. They began to offer sacrifices to the stars<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: <em>Lies about Hashem</em></strong>. After time passed, people arose and told everyone that this <em>is</em> what Hashem wanted, they heard so from Him (false prophets).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:  <em>Lies about Idols</em></strong>. Deceitful people then took it further and said that the idols themselves spoke to them, and told them that they wish to be worshipped, in such and such ways. <strong>This step, when it spread throughout the whole world, was what made everyone forget God completely</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: <em>Threats</em></strong>. As we see with what happened to Avraham in the court of Nimrod, they eventually would threaten those who refused to worship the idols with execution. Fear is a great tool at preventing truth from taking hold in a person's heart.</p>\n<p>I strongly recommend learning the entire Rambam I linked and quoted, chapter 1.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 what was the mistake? The mistake was that the stars and planets are likened to Hashem's ministers (which He of course honoured), but humans are Hashem's children. It's a corruption for the Prince to honour the minister. Hashem is offended when we go to one of His ministers to commune with Him. As His children, we should go <em>direct</em> to Him.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

Forbid it! It is only by way of warning that he mentions [their transgressions].\nThe correct interpretation is that he says that it is impossible for the poor to cease so that none should ever exist. He [Moses] mentioned this because, having assured them that there would be no needy if they observe all the commandments he said: “But I know that not all generations forever will observe all the commandments in which case there would be no need to charge you concerning the poor, for perhaps, at some time, there will exist poor and so I command you about him if he will be found.”</em></p>\n<p>Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 15:11:1</p>\n<p><em>כי לא יחדל אביון מקרב הארץ, “for destitute people will not cease to exist within the land.” Nachmanides writes that some commentators (notably Ibn Ezra, whom he does not name in this context) write that Moses means that there never will be a time when no one is destitute in the land of Israel, seeing that Moses in his prophetic vision foresaw that the Jewish people would never observe Torah law in their entirety, without exception, so that the presence of a destitute person would be unimaginable. The law not to dun creditors at the end of the seventh year of the shemittah cycle therefore envisages such situations. Nachmanides finds this approach difficult, as it is not the custom of the Torah to engage in the kind of prophesy that accuses the Jewish people ahead of time of disloyalty to G’d without qualifying such a prophesy with a conditional phrase such as “if in the course of time, etc.” introducing such a prophecy. It is uncharacteristic for the Torah to legislate one of the basic commandments as something to be applicable to people who have been labeled beforehand by the Torah as deliberate sinners. He therefore prefers to explain our verse as follows: seeing that in spite of the blessings that accrue to you when you do observe the laws of the Torah, and the resultant affluence in the land it is practically impossible that sometime in the future there will be not be an instance of a destitute person, unable to repay his loan on time, one must not dun such a fellow Jew at the end of the shemittah year to repay his loan, but must forgive it.</em></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Source for \"God created this world so that we serve Him with free will\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@manisfriedman/videos\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Manis Friedman</a> has (in my opinion) a very beautiful and logical teaching as to why God created this world. He says (although I might be mixing my own ideas in here) that God created this world in which we have free will to choose to serve Him or not to serve Him, (as apposed to angels who cannot deny God's presence in the heavens and thus praise him without real free will) and that when we choose for God, and serve Him, here in this lowly world in which His presence isn't as obvious, then this is truly praiseworthy. And that when enough people (how many?) serve God through free will, that the purpose of this world is fullfilled and the Moshiach comes.</p>\n<p>What are the sources for this idea? Rabbi Manis Friedman is a Chabad rabbi so perhaps it's from the Tanya, or are there earlier sources for this idea like the Talmud or Midrash?</p>\n<p>One source I could think of that indirectly suggest this idea is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואילו רשע או צדיק לא קאמר כדר' חנינא דא\"ר חנינא הכל בידי שמים חוץ מיראת שמים שנאמר (דברים י, יב) ועתה ישראל מה ה' אלהיך שואל מעמך כי אם\nליראה וגו'</p>\n<p>The Gemara notes: <strong>But</strong> this angel <strong>does not say:</strong> Will he be <strong>wicked or\nrighteous?</strong> This is <strong>in accordance with</strong> a statement <strong>of Rabbi Ḥanina, as\nRabbi Ḥanina said: Everything is in the hand of Heaven, except for\nfear of Heaven.</strong> People have free will to serve God or not, <strong>as it is\nstated: “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you other\nthan to fear</strong> the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 10:12). The fact that God\nasks of the Jewish people to fear Him indicates that it is a person’s\nchoice to do so.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.16b.13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah 16b:13</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Thanks for the great question. I have watched much Rabbi Friedman and have spent countless hours collecting sources on the topics he lectures on.</p>\n<p>I don't really need to bring those, because the general way you've stated the question isn't really something that <em>he</em> specifically says (although he does focus on it), but a general principle of Torah.</p>\n<p>The purpose of free will is so that we can keep Torah, and your source demonstrates that well. As the Rambam puts it in Hilchot Teshuva 5:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every person has the ability to lead a good life and be a <em>tzaddik</em> or\nto lead an evil life and be a <em>rasha</em>... <strong>This is a fundamental concept\nunderlying the whole Torah and its mitzvot</strong>. Moshe said (Nitzavim,\nD'varim 30:15), \"Look, I have put before you today a choice of life\nand good or death and evil.\" He said as well (Re'eh, D'varim\n11:26-28), \"See, I put before you today blessings and curses;\nblessings if you obey... and curses if you do not obey <strong>God's\nMitzvot</strong>...\" In other words, you have the ability to choose between all\ntypes of human action, whether good or bad... <strong>If this were not so\nwhat place would there be for the Torah;</strong> with what justice could God\npunish the <em>rasha</em> or reward the <em>tzaddik</em> if each does not have perfectly\nfree will to choose his own path?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The 613 mitzvot are the Divine service, as it is written in Dvarim 10:12-13:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְ<strong>לַֽעֲבֹד֙ אֶת־ה' אלוקיך</strong> בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ׃ <strong>לִשְׁמֹ֞ר אֶת־מִצְוֺ֤ת ה' וְאֶת־חֻקֹּתָ֔יו</strong> אֲשֶׁ֛ר אָנֹכִ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּ֑וֹם</p>\n<p>to <strong>serve your God</strong> with all your heart and soul, <strong>keeping Hashem’s\ncommandments and laws</strong>, which I enjoin upon you today</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.23.25?lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> on the passage we say in Shema about serving Hashem. See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.1.28.1-5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Rabbeinu Bayha</a> on how we were created only to serve Hashem.</p>\n<p>The Torah is the \"instruction\" (that's what the word <em>torah</em> means) in serving God. It is essentially synonymous with Mitzva (Shemot 24:12):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֨אמֶר ה' אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה עֲלֵ֥ה אֵלַ֛י הָהָ֖רָה וֶהְיֵה־שָׁ֑ם\nוְאֶתְּנָ֨ה לְךָ֜ אֶת־לֻחֹ֣ת הָאֶ֗בֶן <strong>וְהַתּוֹרָה֙ וְהַמִּצְוָ֔ה</strong>\nאֲשֶׁ֥ר כָּתַ֖בְתִּי לְ<strong>הוֹרֹתָֽם</strong>׃</p>\n<p>Hashem said to Moses, “Come up to Me on the mountain and wait there,\nand I will give you the stone tablets with the <strong>Torah and mitzvot</strong>\nwhich I have inscribed to <strong>instruct them</strong> <em>[same root as תורה]</em>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.19?lang=bi&with=Halakhah%20ConnectionsList&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah study itself is also a mitzva</a>, a Divine service. Prayer, another mitzva according to some, is the specific meaning of Avodah, <em>service</em>, whereas the rest of the Mitzvot are the more general meaning. As Rambam puts it in Sefer HaMitzvot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוא שצונו <strong>לעבדו</strong>, וכבר נכפל זה הצווי פעמים באמרו ועבדתם את ה' אלקיכם,\nואמר ואותו תעבודו. ואע\"פ שזה הצווי הוא גם כן מהצוויים הכוללים כמו\nשביארנו בשורש ד', הנה יש בו יחוד אחר <strong>שהוא צווי לתפלה</strong>.</p>\n<p>The 5th mitzvah is that we are commanded <strong>to serve G‑d</strong> (blessed be He).\nThis commandment is repeated twice. It is stated: \"And you shall serve\nG‑d, your L‑rd\" (Exodus 23:25). And it is also stated: \"And you shall\nserve Him\" (Deuteronomy 13:5). Although this commandment is of a\ngeneral nature, as explained in the Fourth Principle, [and apparently\nshould not be included in the count of the 613 mitzvos,] nevertheless\nit has a specific quality, <strong>since it is the commandment to pray</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Prayer is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.8-17?with=Talmud\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">service of the heart</a>.</p>\n<p>All the above now connects back to free will in the pasuk Shmuel quoted in his comment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil</strong>: in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in His ways, and to <strong>keep His commandments</strong> and His statutes and His judgments (Devarim 30:15-17)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and ibid 19:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>בָֽחַרְתָּ֙ בַּחַיִּ֔ים</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Choose life!</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Regarding Moshiach, Rabbi Friedman's main position is that of the gemara in Sanhedrin 98a, that the Mosiach will come</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בדור שכולו זכאי או כולו חייב</p>\n<p>in a generation that is entirely innocent or entirely guilty</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He happens to be very optimistic about this speculative point, as was the Lubavitcher Rebbe T'Zl (and I remember a beautiful lecture by Rabbi Lawrence Kelemen on this too), that our generation is indeed כולו זכאי and there are beautiful explanations of why. I have heard him mention that <em>maybe</em> it means <em>most</em> of the world - he is an optimist, as I said! He teaches this in combination with the interesting idea, which was taught by the Rebbe Rayatz and his successor, that we are all righteous, AND wicked. See <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71LsJPHd2y0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this shiur</a> for example.</p>\n<p>As for the purpose of the world, yes, that's one way to put it. Sandhendrin 98b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב <strong>לא אברי עלמא אלא</strong> לדוד ושמואל אמר למשה ורבי יוחנן אמר <strong>למשיח</strong></p>\n<p>Rav says: <strong>The world was created only</strong> for David. And Shmuel says for\nMoshe. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: <strong>for Moshiach</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea Rabbi Friedman discusses a lot regarding this is based on a couple of midrashim that say the following (e.g.  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Nasso.16.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma Nasso 16:1</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נִתְאַוָּה שֶׁיְּהֵא לוֹ דִּירָה בַּתַּחְתּוֹנִים</p>\n<p>Hashem desired a dwelling place in the lowest [world]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is an idea brought up in Kabbalah, and brought in Tanya and developed heavily in Chabad writings and is very connected to the general idea you've brought here. It is the beginning of a beautiful focus in thought on what the world and we mean to Hashem, i.e. a Torah on looking at things from His point of view. If you wish to learn more about it, Rabbi Friedman has literally thousands of videos on it, and is great at explaining them.</p>\n\n\n",

Though we explained it through another mystery, NAMELY,\nthat he stands between two worlds OF ATZILUT, CALLED ‘RACHEL AND\nLEAH;’ NEVERTHELESS, the secret of the whole matter is that when\nYa’acov took this chamber, the sixth one, he included in it these four\nwomen, who were four angels, all attached to this chamber. These are\nthe four sources of the rivers, as it is written, “and from thence it\nwas parted, and branched into four streams” (Bereishit 2:10). These\nfour branches are the four women Ya’acov married, who took this\nchamber (Zohar 2,156b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Zohar explains that the souls of Rachel, Leah, Zilpah, and Bilhah,\nwere really four parts of one soul, called “Rachel.” This concurs with\nthe tradition that all four were sisters. Rachel and Leah were even\ntwins (Seder Olam Rabbah 2). The rectification of creation requires\nthe reunification of all four parts into one soul. This is similar to\nhow Ya’acov absorbed Esav into his being by first buying the\nbirthright, and then receiving the blessings. The four holy wives of\nYa’acov represent Ya’acov’s mission in the world to unify all these\nelements and thus rectify Adam, whose sin caused the fragmentation of\nthe world. For the sake of this lofty rectification, Ya’acov had to\nmarry four wives and deviate from the command not to marry two\nsisters. By joining together with one husband and overcoming the\nnatural tendency of rivalry, Ya’acov’s four holy wives became as one\nunified person, enacting the highest tikun of creation.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Translation and explanation from <a href=\"https://www.berotbatayin.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/VayetzePolygamy.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.berotbatayin.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/VayetzePolygamy.pdf</a>)</p>\n<p>I think that based on the Zohar we can maybe say that Adam's sin refers to two things: 1) the Eitz Hadaat, 2) How he wasted seed and caused all the demons and evil spirits to enter the world (Eruvin 18b). The message could be that are job was is rectify the sin of the eitz hadaat and was also to rectify the sin of Adam’s wasting seed, by having more than one wife in order to produce more Jews (since the Gemera in Brachot 6a says demons are more numerous than we are) who cause rectification and not destruction. To perform Torah and mitzvot, and not harm and kill people (Midrash Rabah Naso 12, Ibn Ezra Vakira 17, Brachot 43a). The reason Polygamy was prohibited Rabbinically was because people were causing more problems than rectifications (see here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/69102/when-and-why-did-we-get-rid-of-polygamy/69112#69112\">When and why did we get rid of polygamy?</a> for @sabbahillel who gives many reasons why polygamy is forbidden).</p>\n<p>This is just a thought and answer that is possible.

The pischei teshuva in seif katan 3 brings a dispute whether frying is included in the biblical prohibition, or it is a rabbinical prohibition.

    "content": "# Laws, advice and limitations on \"lying for the sake of shalom\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Emet (truth) in general, and interpersonal honesty in specific are some of the most valued and imperative concepts in all of Torah. Throughout all Torah writings, it seems there is nothing more valuable or necessary than truth. I can bring 100 sources, but for brevity, I'll just bring this (Avot 1:18):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבָּן שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן גַּמְלִיאֵל אוֹמֵר,<strong>עַל שְׁלשָׁה דְבָרִים\nהָעוֹלָם עוֹמֵד</strong>, עַל הַדִּין וְעַל הָאֱמֶת וְעַל הַשָּׁלוֹם,\nשֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (זכריה ח) אֱמֶת וּמִשְׁפַּט שָׁלוֹם שִׁפְטוּ\nבְּשַׁעֲרֵיכֶם:</p>\n<p>Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel used to say: <strong>on three things does the world\nstand</strong>: On justice, <strong>on truth and on peace</strong>, as it is said: “execute the\njudgment of truth and peace in your gates” (Zechariah 8:16).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that truth, and peace, are both pillars that hold up the whole world. When truth and peace come into conflict, who wins?</p>\n<p>There is a source that said that in order to preserve peace, we should sacrifice truth (Yevamot 65b).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאָמַר רַבִּי אִילְעָא מִשּׁוּם רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בְּרַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן:\n<strong>מוּתָּר לוֹ לָאָדָם לְשַׁנּוֹת בִּדְבַר הַשָּׁלוֹם</strong>, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר:\n״אָבִיךְ צִוָּה וְגוֹ׳ כֹּה תֹאמְרוּ לְיוֹסֵף אָנָּא שָׂא נָא וְגוֹ׳״.</p>\n<p>And Rabbi Ile’a further said in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi\nShimon: <strong>It is permitted for a person to depart from the truth in a\nmatter that will bring peace</strong>, as it is stated: “Your father commanded\nbefore he died, saying: So you shall say to Joseph: Please pardon your\nbrothers’ crime, etc.” (Genesis 50:16–17)</p>\n<p>רַבִּי נָתָן אוֹמֵר: <strong>מִצְוָה</strong>, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וַיֹּאמֶר שְׁמוּאֵל אֵיךְ\nאֵלֵךְ וְשָׁמַע שָׁאוּל וַהֲרָגָנִי וְגוֹ׳״.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Natan says: <strong>It is a mitzva [to depart from the truth in order to\npreserve peace]</strong>, as it is stated: “And Samuel said: How can I go, and\nSaul will hear and kill me” (I Samuel 16:2)</p>\n<p>דְּבֵי רַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל תָּנָא: <strong>גָּדוֹל הַשָּׁלוֹם, שֶׁאַף\nהַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא שִׁינָּה בּוֹ</strong>, דְּמֵעִיקָּרָא כְּתִיב:\n״וַאֲדוֹנִי זָקֵן״, וּלְבַסּוֹף, כְּתִיב: ״וַאֲנִי זָקַנְתִּי״.</p>\n<p>It was taught in the school of Rabbi Yishmael: <strong>Great is peace, as even\nthe Holy One, Blessed be He, departed from the truth for it</strong>. As,\ninitially it is written that Sarah said of Abraham: “And my lord is\nold” (Genesis 18:12), and in the end it is written that God told\nAbraham that Sarah said: “And I am old” (Genesis 18:13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://etzion.org.il/en/talmud/studies-gemara/midrash-and-aggada/lying-sake-peace\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> outlines several problems with all of the above points in the gemara, better than I could. It's important to what I am about to bring although it doesn't focus on it.</p>\n<p>My issue is that the nature of deceit and lying is so all-encompassingly dangerous, it beggars belief that we are permitted to do it. It would appear to me that if indeed we can prove it is permitted (or even a mitzva), <strong>it should come with a huge amount of warning, commentary and rules to make it work</strong>. Let me just list some of the dangers to make the point:</p>\n<h2>Trust is vital</h2>\n<p>We can never know what a person is really thinking or feeling, so getting close to others, whether it be in an intimate relationship or any functional relationship, requires the positive establishment of trust in order to function. Even if we have a moral reason to lie, certainly we should be very very careful and decide if it is absolutely necessary, as if we are caught lying, we do untold damage to our reputation and our relationships! We are not God, and we cannot know if we will or will not be caught. That's rarely something we can predict or control.</p>\n<p>Certainly, if the person catches us but believes we were doing it for their sake and benefit, it helps a little, but not much. From now on, every time one speaks to them, they will be suspecting \"is he lying for my benefit?\". Not only that, but they might feel disrespected, or infantilised. \"I am an adult and can look after myself, please stop trying to protect me\". This can easily breed resentment and be a stumbling block for וְלֹֽא־תִטֹּר֙.</p>\n<h2>It breeds arrogance</h2>\n<p>Empowering a person to deceive people for their benefit sends a bad message. It says \"you are better than the people around you, in that you can decide matters relevant to their benefit, without consulting them, and act on those decisions\". It is not even behind their back, but direct, they will go and say cunning, pre-meditated words to them that will directly affect them in one of the most penimiusdik ways imaginable - modifying their very knowledge.</p>\n<p>Giving people the power to make important decisions on behalf of other people without consulting them creates a huge stumbling block for arrogance. It makes a person believe they are smarter than those around him, and makes them seem to him to be like infants in his eyes, that need him to look after them. Worse still, we learn this lesson, apparently, from God! \"Be like God, lie to people when <em>you</em> decide it would be for their benefit\". Yikes.</p>\n<h2>It is dangerous - how are we supposed to know what's best?</h2>\n<p>Permission to lie for the sake of shalom is giving us a lot more credit than we deserve. As humans, we are very limited. Unlike Hashem, who is omniscient, we are lacking 99.9% of the knowledge and information necessary to be able to know with confidence that the lie is better than the truth in any situation. Even if we knew that a certain lie would produce shalom in the moment, we can't know if it will in the long run.</p>\n<p>Telling someone their clothing looks good when we know it doesn't, may prevent an argument in that conversation, but we have no idea what an all-encompassing effect this person believing their clothes, erroneously, look good will have on their life as a whole. People might think of them as weird and treat them badly, they might fail job interviews or lose their job, they may get mocked and attacked. Often, a little bit of stirring of shalom is a good thing.</p>\n<p>Note, I am not now saying we should do something equally difficult - take it into our own hands to stir shalom when we think it's of benefit. That suffers from all the same issues here. I am simply arguing that truth is vital. If truth and shalom come into conflict, I am advocating for truth over shalom. It's hard to imagine how telling the truth can ever lead to something that <em>shouldn't be</em>. The most basic, default opinion is that telling the truth will always lead to the <em>right</em> outcome. So therefore if telling the truth will stir shalom, then I don't see why that's such a huge problem? In fact, it takes bravery to be able to do this and this leads to my next point.</p>\n<h2>Lying is easy, telling the truth can be difficult</h2>\n<p>In a situation where telling the truth will be difficult, the yeitzer is to lie. Given that lying in general is a very big aveira, a big temptation, and can be easier than telling the truth, it's dangerous to give people any level of permission to do it. Torah highly praises going against our nature in order to pursue virtue (e.g. Avraham's 10th test). In light of everything I am saying here, surely the number of cases where taking the easy route and lying for the sake of shalom must be a very tiny percentage of real-life situations? This leads to the next point.</p>\n<h2>It is ill defined</h2>\n<p>Surely, if we are going to allow \"lying for the sake of shalom\", we need to define it very rigorously, and there should be as many halachot about it as there are about Lashon Hara. Almost any time we are tempted to lie, an argument can be made that it will be of benefit to shalom. Lying to cover up a sin or crime we did, for example, would be of benefit to shalom because getting caught will cause hurt feelings, arguments, chillul Hashem etc. Just having a well known permission to \"lie for the sake of peace\" seems very dangerous.</p>\n<h2>It desensitises us to bashfulness and the midda of emet</h2>\n<p>As is well known (such as from the gemara in Berachot about sinning 3 times), the more we sin, the more sin becomes permissible to us. This is something that is, therefore, forbidden. It destroys our natural born good middot, such as our bashfulness, especially our bashfulness in deceiving others. So, this idea of permitting deception for the sake of shalom is difficult.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone does it, they will be inadvertently desensitising themselves to deception. To look someone one loves in the eye, and say over pre-meditated words that deceive them, controlling ones blushing and other \"tells\", surely has a powerfully negative affect on our middot. It develops skills in the art of deception that we'd rather not have. It makes us better liars and sets a stumbling block for lying more often, through confidence and habituation. Chas veshalom.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It is worth noting, that none of the above applies to Hashem, so I find it very difficult that we should learn from Him anything in this regard. It is also noteworthy that we do not have permission to lie for the sake of very important things, like bringing people closer to Hashem (kiruv), the honour of Torah, for raising money for Torah learning or raising money for the poor.</p>\n<p>Given all of the above points, it's clear that permission to lie for peace is <strong>not</strong> a simple matter. There are many many issues.</p>\n<p>So the question is, what is the <em>exact</em> halacha here? Where is it discussed in <strong>full</strong> detail? Ideally one that addresses and mitigates all of the above points.</p>\n\n\n",

They were an active community in the early 20th century, but currently don’t seem to have a centralized community. They are strongly anti Kabbalistic (or at least Zoharic and Lurianic kabbala) and strongly adhered to the philosophy of the Rambam to guide their faith. They also followed him in most Halacha areas, as they felt much of contemporary Halacha, including some of the Shulchan Aruch, had been corrupted by Kabbalistic beliefs and customs.\nYou could read all about them here:  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dor_Daim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dor_Daim</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a Beit Kenesseth Rambam in Jerusalem that adheres to the Rambam. I believe it was majority Yemenite and it was an eye opening experience the one time I went. The service begins shortly after sunrise. The prayers are only those brought down by the Rambam, with zero modern additions. Everyone did their morning blessings at home so I believe they began with Psalms of Praise (pesukei d'zimra which was only the last 5 Psalms). Then it was Shema. Then Amidah and Torah service. The Torah was read one verse at a time and then repeated in Aramaic targum. Everything leading up to the Torah service was about a half hour to forty five minutes. The Torah reading and Prophets reading was about an hour and a half. A few blessings, one more Amidah and the service was done by about 10:30am. The majority of that time was the reading of the biblical books which made sense. It really restored the idea of what the service is really supposed to be about. The reading of the Torah and our Prophets, without a language barrier.</p>\n<p>I don't have their contact information but if you look hard enough I'm sure you'll find them.</p>\n<p><em>Update</em></p>\n<p>Commentator asked: \"Without a language barrier? Translating the Torah verse by verse to Aramaic is by no means helpful in the modern age\"</p>\n<p>I agree with you that at this moment, the Aramaic Targum does not help with a language barrier. But it shows that before Halakha got so stratified, we would make choices about our services to get around issues of language barrier. It makes me wonder if we still had a Sanhedrin, would every synagogue read one verse of the Torah, and then read out loud a translation in the local tongue? I'm imagining an Artscroll or JPS Translation for English etc etc.</p>\n<p>Commentator asked: \"The service is supposed to be about the reading of the Torah and our Prophets without a language barrier? Not praying?\"</p>\n<p>Almost every other synagogue service I've been to (Ashkenazi, Sepharadi, Moroccan, and Shammi Yemenite Services), the prayers take twice as long as the Torah Reading and reading of the Prophets. To have a Synagogue experience of the inverse, it gives the service an entirely different feel. I wouldn't say the service at the Rambam Synagogue wasn't about praying. But it definitely felt like the Torah and Prophet readings were the number one priority and prayers were a very clear second place priority. And I think that makes more sense for a Shabbat service where historically speaking, this was often the one time people could come and hear those books being read AND translated.</p>\n\n\n",

Yes, we shouldn't miss berachot, but making a beracha l'vatala is generally considered just a smidgen worse than missing one. See for example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.210.2?vhe=Maginei_Eretz:_Shulchan_Aruch_Orach_Chaim,_Lemberg,_1893&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch OC 210:2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.18.1?vhe=Maginei_Eretz:_Shulchan_Aruch_Orach_Chaim,_Lemberg,_1893&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch OC 18:1</a></p>\n<p>I think you are close to answering your own question in regards to your reference to the shiur of time.</p>\n<p>An example of some disagreement in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.210.19?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berurah 210:19</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(יט) וספק ברכות להקל - היינו באפילו אם הוא בולע לא יברך כיון שאין כונתו לאכילה וכסברא הראשונה. והנה המ\"א חולק על השו\"ע והרמ\"א וס\"ל דבבולע לכו\"ע חייב לברך אבל כמה אחרונים החליטו עם פסק הרמ\"א דהוא ספק ברכה ולא יברך ולכתחלה טוב ליזהר הרוצה לבלוע שיתכוין ליהנות ממנו בתורת אכילה ויברך עליו [ח\"א]:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And doubtful blessings are treated leniently, meaning that even if he swallowed it, he should not recite a blessing since his intention is not to eat and according to the first opinion. And here, the Magen Avraham disagrees with the Shulchan Aruch, and the Rema and holds that if he swallowed it, he is obligated to recite a blessing, but many later authorities have decided with the ruling of the Rema that it is doubtful blessing and he should not recite a blessing. Initially, it is good to be careful, the one who wants to swallow, should intend to enjoy it according to the laws of eating and recite a blessing on it\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So generally, I extrapolate from the many applications of safek beracha lehakel that if you are uncertain whether or not you should recite a blessing, you should not recite it, as long as you stay within the alloted shiur. If you drink a glass of orange juice large enough to warrant boree nefashot, but you are unsure whether you might drink more, then safek berachot lehakel would mean that you rather postpone saying boree nefashot than saying it multiple times within the shiur.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I discussed your interesting question with R Ari Wasserman, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/16122541.Ari_Wasserman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">author of many sefarim</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>He recommended making the after-bracha once finished with the item at hand (e.g., cup of coffee or water).</strong> The possibility that one may (or may not) drink more an hour later doesn't make this a <em>bracha l'vatala</em> (I think you meant <em>bracha she eyna tzricha</em> because <em>bracha l'vatala</em> appears to me the case of saying the <em>bracha</em> and then not drinking). This is particularly true for one who knows he sometimes forgets.</p>\n<p>By coincidence I saw R Daniel Mann wrote yesterday</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] as the term she’eina tzricha (unnecessary) implies and the\nOrchot Chayim (Berachot 15) states, the problem is only when the additional\nberacha is created for no good reason.

Obviously every single word of these commentaries are unfathomably valuable to our understanding of the Torah, but for people on our level not every single pshat on every single passuk will necessarily inspire every single person. For example, explanation of certain grammar rules as they pertain to a passuk are critically important but for a casual reader won't necessarily result in inspiration and desire to be better.

Since a debt has a set ending period, it is more like rental.</p>\n<p>Both of these seem to be assuming that there is some grey area about the exact price agreed upon, which wouldn't seem to apply to a loan.

    "content": "# Socialising children - what does the Torah say?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does the Torah have anything to say on socialising children?</p>\n<p>There are many relevant points. I would like to know at what <strong>age</strong> and in what <strong>method</strong> should one do so. Included in these points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At what age should children learn to be away from their parents?</li>\n<li>How many friends should they have at what age?</li>\n<li>How often should they see their friends?</li>\n<li>Where does the Torah stand on retaining innocence vs preparing them for life<sup>1</sup>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I define socialising children as the dictionary does: \"the action or process of causing a person to behave in a way that is acceptable to their society\". For the purpose of this question, let's assume that \"society\" means <em>both</em> a frum jewish society, and society as a whole.</p>\n<p>The reason I am asking is because there seems to be a lot of pressure nowadays from educators and psychologists to send children to school at ages younger than seems to be stated by halacha<sup>2,3</sup> and in ways that don't obviously match or come up in hashkafa<sup>1,4</sup>. Just google \"socialising children\" and take a tally of the average age the studies and journals say. It's hovering around 2 or 3! This also matches my anecdotal experience in my community of speaking to fellow parents and teachers (in one case, we have heard that someone who can send their child to a nursery at age 1 and doesn't is holding their child back!).</p>\n<p>Upon pursuing Torah sources on this matter, I find a lot of the arguments hinge on what's best for the <em>Torah education</em> of the child, but struggling to find anything clear and unambiguous about the \"socializing\".</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.32a.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.32a.10</a></sup><br />\n<sup>2 - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.245.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.245.5</a></sup><br />\n<sup>3 - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Torah_Study.2.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Torah_Study.2.2</a></sup><br />\n<sup>4 - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.21a.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.21a.3</a></sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is hard to provide a definitive age, as it is very much dependent on the child, their maturity and a number of factors that I have already enumerated in the comments above.</p>\n<p>That being said, by way of introduction, I am reminded of the Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Human_Dispositions.6.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos De'os 6:1</a> which says expressly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דֶרֶךְ בְּרִיָּתוֹ שֶׁל אָדָם לִהְיוֹת נִמְשָׁךְ בְּדֵעוֹתָיו וּבְמַעֲשָׂיו אַחַר רֵעָיו וַחֲבֵרָיו וְנוֹהֵג כְּמִנְהַג אַנְשֵׁי מְדִינָתוֹ</p>\n<p>It is natural for a man's character and actions to be influenced by his friends and associates and for him to follow the local norms of behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, this is no different with children. A good friend can withstand the test of time and a true friend can have a major impact on that person's life (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avot_D%27Rabbi_Natan.8.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos D'Rabbi Nosson 8:3</a>)</p>\n<p>Most parents will send their children to a school that is aligned to their hashkofo and worldview, and by extension, will hopefully ensure that their children are surrounded by kids of other like-minded parents. Therefore, this presents (although not foolproof) the opportunity to hopefully create good, positive friendships that will overtime, form a \"chevra\" that will help to frame and impact their child's behaviour and outlook. The obvious flipside to this is that if the chevra are disingenuous, and of a bad influence, it will impact negatively.</p>\n<p>So, we see that friends can be a very powerful influence when they are right for the child.</p>\n<p>Rav Wolbe in Alei Shiur, Cheilek 1, shaar rishon, perek 4, has a whole piece entitled \"chevra\". There he starts with exactly the point I make:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>להיות בין חברים אשר שאיפה אחת להם, חויה אחת משלהבת אותם, איש עוזר לרעהו בעבודה היום-יומית ולאחיו יאמר חזק ברגעים של רפיון וחלישות-הדעת - זוהי משאת-נפשו של כל אדם, ובפרט כל צעיר</p>\n<p>To be among friends who have the same ambition, one experience that inflames them, each person helps the other in their daily work and speaks loudly to their brother in moments of laxity and weakness of mind - this is the desire of every person, especially every young person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, when done well, it is an amazing thing.</p>\n<p>A final introductory point as to why friendship and the power of a social circle should be encouraged from an early age is the establishing of a relationship that when positive, is a good lens for the child to view their relationship with G-d.</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Chaim Schlanger shlita, a well-known mechanech in Eretz Yisroel (and a principal talmid of <a href=\"https://hamodia.com/2017/01/07/harav-moshe-shapira-ztl-of-yerushalayim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Moshe Shapiro zt\"l</a>) in his phenomenal sefer, <a href=\"https://seforimcenter.com/Ohel-Yaakov-and-Leah---Mitzvat-Chinuch__p-3228.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohel Yaakov V'Leah</a> p. 193 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנאמנות לחבירו היא היסוד שעליו עומדים כל משפטי בני אדם. ומידת הנאמנות כלפי הקב\"ה וכלפי חבירו אחת היא. מי שאינו נאמן לחבירו, יש להניח שלא יעמוד בנאמנות כלפי השי\"ת</p>\n<p>Loyalty to one's friend is the foundation on which all human judgments stand. And the degree of loyalty to G-d and to one's friend is the same. He who is not loyal to his friend, it must be assumed that he will not be loyal to G-d, blessed be He.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's now discuss the technicalities - the how and when...</p>\n<p>As mentioned, each child is different and has different maturity levels. That being said, Rav Wolbe in his masterful sefer on chinuch - Zeriyah Ubinyan B'Chinuch p.13-16 speaks of a \"נקודת ההתחלה\" a \"starting point\" by which a child is able to understand/internalise to some degree, the ideas that a parent conveys to them. He writes there (p.14):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הדברים הללו הם היסוד של \"נקודת ההתחלה\", רגע הזריעה, התחלת החינוך לשלביו השונים. רש\"י בפרשת \"לך לך\" כותב לגבי אברהם אבינו, על הפסוק \"וירק את חניכיו\" (בראשית יד:יד): חינוך הוא לשון התחלת כניסת האדם או כלי לאומנות שהוא עתיד לעמוד בה. חנוך לנער, חנוכת המזבח, חנוכת הבית</p>\n<p>עניינו של חינוך לפי רש\"י הוא הכניסה הנכונה בנקודת ההתחלה. זהו חנוך לנער. כשהילד מגיע למצב מסויים, צריכים לזרוע בו מה שהוא מוכן לקלוט באותו זמן</p>\n<p>These words are the basis of the \"starting point\", the moment of sowing, the beginning of education in its various stages. Rashi in parasha Lech Lecha writes about Avraham our father, on the verse \"And he trained his students\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.14.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.14.14.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit 14:14</a>): \"The word חנך signifies introducing a person or a thing, for the first time, to some particular occupation in which it is intended that he should remain (i. e. to dedicate or devote to some particular purpose). It has a similar sense in (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.22.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 22:6</a>) “Train up (חנוך) a child”, and in (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.7.84?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 7:84</a>) חנוכת המזבח “the dedication of the altar”, and (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.30.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 30:1</a>) “The dedication (חנוכת) of the house”</p>\n<p>The matter of chinuch according to Rashi is the right entrance at the starting point. This is \"train the child\". When the child reaches a suitable state, one should sow in him what he is ready to absorb at that time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, at least in this context, a meaningful friendship, as discussed above would begin when the child is able to take and gain something from it. This is not so say that an earlier age of socialising is not worthwhile (indeed from a developmental perspective one can argue through social gatherings, a toddler acquires social skills, develops empathy and creates communication with the environment), but when a child is more cognisant of the world around them it definitely makes for a more substantial companionship.</p>\n<p>I can't point you to any immediate Jewish source about the developmental nature of nurturing friendships from a young age, but I can point you to the acclaimed Jewish psychotherapist and family counselor - <a href=\"https://www.torahanytime.com/#/speaker?l=446\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dr Meir Wikler</a>. He is also the author of, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Artscroll-Partners-Hashem-Meir-Wikler/dp/1578194520\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Partners With Hashem: Effective Guidelines for Successful Parenting</a> (Artscroll/Mesorah, 2000)</p>\n<p>He has a piece on Aish.com <a href=\"https://aish.com/48937077/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> entitled, \"<em>Making Friends</em>\". He writes there why friendships are so foundational in younger children, specifically once they enter schooling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While your child is an infant and toddler, friendships are very irrelevant and insignificant to him. His entire focus is on you, your spouse and his siblings. Your family makes up his entire social world.</p>\n<p>Once your child enters preschool, however, he enters an alien, competitive and sometimes hostile social universe. In order to survive, he must succeed at making friends.</p>\n<p>Without friends, your child lacks partners for games and play, companionship during free time and, most importantly, allies for protection against bullies and other aggressors. Without friends, your child feels alone and is alone. Not having friends undermines your child's self-esteem and erodes his confidence. It heightens his insecurities and fears. And it may make him want to avoid camp, extracurricular activities and even school itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When young children who are at this stage in life have friends, it creates the opportunity to make lasting lessons. They learn how to look out for a friend, to gain a sense of happiness when helping them and enjoying their company.  </p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>ADDITION</strong></p>\n<p>So why is it important to teach children the means to socialise...</p>\n<p>We know from Parshas Noach (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.8.21?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 8:21</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּ֠י יֵ֣צֶר לֵ֧ב הָאָדָ֛ם רַ֖ע מִנְּעֻרָ֑יו</p>\n<p>That the desire of a man’s heart is evil from its youth</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Zion_Abba_Shaul\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HaRav Ben Zion Abba Shaul zt\"l</a>, explains that a person has bad middos that are innately rooted from birth. If it were not for the fact that we receive chinuch as youngsters, these bad traits would further intensify as we mature. (See <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19976&st=&pgnum=197\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr LeTzion, Shaar ben adam lechaveiro, maamar 6 - chinuch habanim p. 188</a>)</p>\n<p>The challenge of parenting is to provide each child with what they need so that they can develop a better understanding of the world, remove the innate selfishness that comes from being born as a \"taker\" and build meaningful relationships that will help them reach their potential.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Abraham Twersky in his sefer, <em><a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9780899066448.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Positive Parenting</a></em> p.48 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a child grows and begins to change from the totally self-centered infant to a youngster who must interact with others. situations arise which the young child does not yet know how to handle. For example, the child has candy or toys, and his infantile tendency is to keep them for himself. If he is to become a social being, he must learn how to give and share. Or perhaps someone else has something which the child desires. The young child does not know right from wrong, and he might try to take it away from another child. This is incompatible with living in society. The parents must begin to teach the child basic social skills.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, fostering friendships, developing their social skills, is the means through which a child learns to become a giving, more loving human being.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yes, don't socialize them. Unless they need help and some subtle suggestions or intervention they'll be fine.  Likutei Etzot - BaNNim, Children, #15:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's better for your children's development that you have distance from them. That is: don't be too glued to them, don't play with them all the time, don't pay overmuch attention to them at all [t.n. it's been noted these are three increasing degrees]. Do only what you have to in order to bring them up in serving Hashem as the times come for them to grow, but don't play with them too much (L. Moharan 59).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation mine, others read it differently. Not necessarily just leave them alone but let them figure out it and be there as a quiet observer and guide.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Find a tradition and example that works for you.

If one is married or in chatan classes, this topic will be covered and explained.</p>\n<p>It all starts with Reish Lakish making a controversial statement on the topic of the Golden Calf (the gemara's current theme):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ר\"ל בואו ונחזיק טובה לאבותינו שאלמלא הן לא חטאו אנו לא באנו לעולם</p>\n<p>Reish Lakish says: Come and let us be grateful to our ancestors [who\nsinned with the Golden Calf], as had they not sinned we would not have\ncome into the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This implies that had they not sinned, they wouldn't have had more children. The gemara attacks that assertion in several <em>kashes</em>, and one is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מי כתיב (דברים ה, כז) לך אמור להם שובו לכם לאהליכם</p>\n<p>isn't it written at Sinai: “Go say to them: Return to your tents”\n(Deuteronomy 5:27)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why would they go to their tents if they aren't going to have more children? The answer the gemara gives is that Onah in marriage isn't just about having children, but for it's own sake, which the gemara refers to as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לשמחת עונה</p>\n<p>The enjoyment of Onah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is cross referenced with the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.72b.16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim</a> which uses the term  in that exact manner, proving that the mitzva of Onah isn't just about having children, and the part of it that isn't is called שמחת עונה. It's also used in this way in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.831.16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on Nach</a>, but doesn't seem to appear in Tanach.</p>\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n<p>This answer has come to respond to the bounty. Now that I think about it (thanks whoever downvoted), asking a separate question in a bounty within a question is probably against the rules, which is why this answer isn't good. So allow me to add the following:</p>\n<p><strong>There does not appear to be any particular idiom referring to what you ask. ימי טהרה is perhaps the best we are going to get and has been agreed by 3 people in the comments, and disagreed by one.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The theory you came up with about Simchat Onah doesn't hold.

People should eagerly await and take advantage of such opportunities to find wisdom revealed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אשרי אדם שומע לי לשקוד על דלתותי יום יום – מצייר את החכמה שהיא יושבת סגורה בהיכלה כבודה בת מלך פנימה לא תתראה לאיש והדלתות סגורות והמבקש אותה צריך לשקוד בשקידה רבה על דלתות הסגורות לשמור מזוזות פתחי – לשמור את העת שיפתח הפתח שאז ימצא החכמה בעת תתראה דרך הפתח</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup><sub>The word שקד carries a dual meaning and indicates both watching as well as eager alacrity and diligence (Rashi, ad loc., \"לשקד – לשמר. על דלתותיי – להכנס ראשון לבית המדרש ולצאת אחרון\"; Metzudos, ad loc., \"לשקוד – ענין מהירות כמו שוקד (ירמיהו א׳:י״ב). למהר לבוא אל דלתותי בכל יום ולשבת בקבע במזוזות פתחי כדרך השומר היושב ומשמר בקבע\"). </sub></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What’s the purpose of the celestial bodies?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The purpose of that which is beyond the Earth’s atmosphere is what I would like to be expounded. I’m familiar with Genesis chapter 1, (please hold your applause), and the reasons given there. But more specifically I want to know about the purpose (or role in the scheme of creation) of such celestial bodies as planets, asteroids, meteors, and others, like galaxies, black holes, supernovas, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Two points.</p>\n<p>First, we must realize, as was pointed out by Rav Saadya Gaon in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/HaEmunot_veHaDeot%2C_%5BTreatise_I%5D_The_Creation_of_the_World.5.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Emunos Vedeyos (end of first section)</a>, that the question is not as great as it seems at first since there is no toil involved in God creating anything large or small. The size or complexity is no difference to the One of infinite wisdom. There only remains the question that if God did something it must have had a reason. While this is true, you don't have to find a tremendous reason to justify a giant creation, as long as there is <em>some</em> reason.</p>\n<p>On to the next point. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.40.26?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Isaiah 40:26</a> the prophet says, 'Lift high your eyes and see: Who created these? He who sends out their host by count, Who calls them each by name: Because of His great might and vast power, Not one fails to appear.'</p>\n<p>We find terms such as צבא השמים (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.9.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">such as Nechemiah 9:6</a>) referring to the starts and planets. This all suggests that their actual purpose is to serve as honor guards of the Creator.</p>\n<p>Had the sky been empty, we would look up at night and see plain black. This would make the world feel very small. Now that we have stars all around, this gives us a depth perspective. Now when we look up we see vastness. This can be compared to a vast army marching before and beside a king which is an honor to the king, and brings out his might and dominion.</p>\n<p>When Isaiah says 'Who calls them each by name', this can be referring to the fact that no two areas of the sky look alike. There are no repeating patterns. And so, being unique is having their own identity, or name. This as well serves to amplify the feeling of greatness and magnitude of the creation, since rather than just being large it is plenty.</p>\n<p>When we managed to venture into space, or send our cameras there, rather than demystifying the wonder, it only deepened. The picture we now see are truly beautiful, revealing systems inside systems.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I 100% support HaLeiVi's answer. As with everything Hashem does, there is an infinite amount to be said about it and I look forward to other answers too. This answer seeks to bring more to the table in answering this great question.</p>\n<p>Firstly, some quick reasons for the stars:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.1.1.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">calculate when the night begins</a> (such as for when Shabbat goes out)</li>\n<li>To recognise Him (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.40.26?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yishayahu 40:26</a>)</li>\n<li>To <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_Two%2C_On_the_Influence_of_the_Stars.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">influence events</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.148.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">So that He should be praised</a></li>\n<li>To enable free will, as it adds to the plausibility that Hashem does not exist, and the world is an accident, and we are not the centrepiece of His creation (chas veshalom)</li>\n<li>An expression of love and compassion from Hashem</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>I'd like to focus on that last point in this answer:</p>\n<p>When Hashem made the moon smaller<sup>1</sup>, He committed His first \"negative\" action. This was the start of the concept of \"necessary evil\". For some reason, suffering and death is necessary. We don't see the good in it, how it connects us to Hashem's Essence, but everything that Hashem does is good and taking us to that great day, so there is a purpose behind these things and we look forward to the day when Hashem raises us up to a point where we can only see the good. Until then, Hashem asks us to bring a korban, <em>on His behalf</em><sup>2,3</sup>.</p>\n<p>pp. 32 of Heaven Exposed by Rabbi Tzvi Freeman (can read the whole thing <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1209/jewish/The-Lunar-Files.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I have another mitzvah for you.

When\nit comes to that time, at the beginning of each month, I want you to\nbring a sin offering for Me\"</p>\n<p>\"A sin offering for <em>Who?</em>\" Moses asked.</p>\n<p>\"For Me. Because I have diminished the light of the moon. And because\nthere is suffering and oppression in My world. And darkness.\"</p>\n<p>\"But God,\" Moses asked. \"Why don't You just do away with the\nsuffering?\"</p>\n<p>\"That's your job, Moses...Until then, atone for Me.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.1.16.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi, on Bereshit 1:16</a> brings the midrash on the purpose of the stars:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ואת הכוכבים</strong>. עַל יְדֵי שֶׁמִּעֵט אֶת הַלְּבָנָה הִרְבָּה צְבָאָיהָ לְהָפִיס דַּעְתָּהּ:</p>\n<p><strong>and the stars:</strong> Because He diminished the moon, <strong>He increased its hosts, to appease it</strong>. - [from Gen. Rabbah 46:4 and Chullin 60b] i.e.,\nThe stars serve as the entourage of the moon. When it comes out, they\naccompany it, and when it sets, they too set. [Gen. Rabbah ad loc.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What we see from this, is that <strong>Hashem created the stars in an act of compassion and kindness</strong>. This whole project He started is a difficult one, that involves a lot of darkness. Hashem does not enjoy or even <em>want</em> us to suffer. It's a \"necessary evil\", and in an act of appeasement, in order to illuminate the world (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.17?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">literally</a>, and metaphorically), He created <em>galaxies</em>. Whenever we see them, we remember that He hasn't forgotten us, despite all this darkness<sup>4</sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר לָהּ הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא: בִּתִּי, שְׁנֵים עָשָׂר מַזָּלוֹת\nבָּרָאתִי בָּרָקִיעַ, וְעַל כׇּל מַזָּל וּמַזָּל בָּרָאתִי לוֹ\nשְׁלֹשִׁים חַיִל, וְעַל כׇּל חַיִל וְחַיִל בָּרָאתִי לוֹ שְׁלֹשִׁים\nלִגְיוֹן, וְעַל כׇּל לִגְיוֹן וְלִגְיוֹן בָּרָאתִי לוֹ שְׁלֹשִׁים\nרַהֲטוֹן, וְעַל כׇּל רַהֲטוֹן וְרַהֲטוֹן בָּרָאתִי לוֹ שְׁלֹשִׁים\nקְרָטוֹן, וְעַל כׇּל קְרָטוֹן וּקְרָטוֹן בָּרָאתִי לוֹ שְׁלֹשִׁים\nגַּסְטְרָא, וְעַל כׇּל גַּסְטְרָא וְגַסְטְרָא תָּלִיתִי בּוֹ שְׁלֹשׁ\nמֵאוֹת וְשִׁשִּׁים וַחֲמִשָּׁה אַלְפֵי רִבּוֹא כּוֹכָבִים כְּנֶגֶד\nיְמוֹת הַחַמָּה. וְכוּלָּן לֹא בָּרָאתִי אֶלָּא בִּשְׁבִילֵךְ, וְאַתְּ\nאָמַרְתְּ ״עֲזַבְתַּנִי״ וּ״שְׁכַחְתַּנִי״?!

Only when it is dark can we see the stars. When we see them, we see their beauty. As HaLeiVi wrote, the more we discover, the more amazing and beautiful the universe becomes. This is supposed to remind us that Hashem's plan is perfect. It may seem dark, and oppressive, and difficult, but we have to have <em>emuna</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.92.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ve'emunatecha baleilot</a>) that He knows what He is doing, and the purpose everything serves is not just <em>worth it</em>, but it's the most amazing unfathomable goodness, a true Godly beauty, we can't ever imagine!</p>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.60b.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.60b.2</a></sup><br />\n<sup>2 - See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.28.15?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Bamidbar 28:15</a></sup><br />\n<sup>3 - Likutei Sichot, vol. 30, pp. 8-15.

See that there is a consensus in the scientific community that correlates human events with the influence of the environment, for example the French revolution was only possible due to social disturbances caused by famine which in turn was caused by climate change, particularly a cold wave that harmed other than crops in Europe, the outbreak of the Black Death is also linked to altered weather patterns. So theologically you can understand that these changes caused by these celestial objects like the sun, moon and even the movement of the Earth serve as a mystical channel to bring good or bad things depending on human behavior and nations as a whole, in the Bible we see God more judging nations than individuals themselves.</p>\n\n\n",

It says in the text, \"who took you out of Eretz Mitzrayim,\" for He took you out of there to teach you about the reality and the desire [of Hashem], for with His knowledge and providence we left there, and to teach about the newness, for from the beginning of the world, not a thing has changed from His nature, and to teach you about what He can do, which will teach you about His uniqueness, like it says above [in Shmot 9:14], \"so that you will know that there is no one like Me in all the land.\" And this is the reason for [the phrase] \"Who took you out\" - for they know of and bear witness to all of these [ideas.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.2?ven=The_Rashi_chumash_by_Rabbi_Shraga_Silverstein&lang=bi&with=Or%20HaChaim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or HaChaim HaKadosh</a> writes that it is to teach us that we were in a state of impurity, and that G-d, the true one G-d, took us out of it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אנכי ה׳ אלוקיך, \"I am the Lord your G'd, etc.\" <strong>The reason G'd repeats \"who took you out of Egypt, the house of bondage,\" was to heighten the contrast between then and now.</strong> The Israelites had been enslaved in a country which was notorious for not releasing slaves nor letting them escape (compare Isaiah 14,17). The Israelites had two major strikes against them at the time. They were mired deeply in impurity, and they were under the rule of a king notorious for not letting anyone escape. (emphasis mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Or HaChaim further writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>G'd manifested Himself in this dual capacity to remove all doubt about philosophies which inspired idol worship by suggesting that He had partners. G'd's taking the Israelites out of Egypt should have dispelled any such doubts about any opposing deities possessing any power at all. מבית עבדים, from the house of bondage. <strong>G'd makes the point that since it was He Who liberated us from one master, He is entitled to demand that we show Him obeisance.</strong> (emphasis mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, based on the above, we can learn a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>G-d is the One that has the supervision. G-d is the true one G-d, despite of what the theological mindset was from the Egyptians. They believed in deities. We believe in the true One G-d.</li>\n<li>G-d has the power to transform a nation to impart purity and holiness into it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Kedushas Levi explains why it is a fundamental principle. The Kedushas Levi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.2?ven=The_Rashi_chumash_by_Rabbi_Shraga_Silverstein&lang=bi&with=Kedushat%20Levi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> that in order for G-d to give the Jewish people His Torah, they should have been released from the bondage of Mitzrayim and pharao:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The basis for this exegesis appears to be ‎that G’d did not give the Torah to the Jewish people until after ‎the Exodus from Egypt because there is a difference between ‎keeping the Torah out of fear (of punishment) and keeping the ‎Torah out of love for G’d. People who keep the Torah out of a ‎feeling of love for G’d are called: ‎בן‎, “son,” as in ‎בני ישראל‎, “the ‎Children of Israel,” whereas people keeping the Torah out of fear ‎are still considered ‎עבדים‎, “slaves.” Had the Israelites received the ‎Torah prior to their redemption from Egypt they would have ‎accepted it out of fear, so that G’d could not have taken them out ‎of Egypt legally, as they “belonged” to the Egyptians, having been ‎their slaves. Having received the Torah after the Exodus, when ‎they were free men, they certainly had not been under duress in ‎accepting it, but had done so out of love for the G’d Who had ‎redeemed them. G’d therefore is explaining in the verse above ‎that the time had come now when He was able to give them the ‎Torah in their capacity of their being His children.‎</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>------------- EDIT---------------------------------------</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/128136/27180\">this answer</a> I cite different sources on what it means that everyday, we must see ourselves leaving Mitzrayim.

Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But don’t people say a popular proverb: If your wife is short, stoop and whisper to her and consult with her?

The Gemara presents another version of this distinction: This statement of Rav maintains that one should not follow her counsel in divine matters; and that proverb maintains that one should follow her counsel in general matters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>What the Rambam is describing is a healthy relationship, not an order of hegemony. They are both working together to form one coherent family unit.</p>\n<p>Since this goes against the grain of the mainstream way of thinking, we'll need a bit of context. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Gifts_to_the_Poor.7.3?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> quotes the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.67b.3?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara in Kesuvos 67b</a> that you must supply a poor person with his needs even when his particular need happens to be a certain extravagance that would be superfluous to you. And so, if he was once rich and got used to having runners ahead of him, now that he's poor, since he didn't get over that part you should supply that to him from charity.</p>\n<p>We see from this not to look objectively at the material being suppled, but at the person's need. What is—or became—natural for him to desire, by <em>withholding</em> that you are <em>taking away</em> and hurting him. To stress this a drop more, you aren't holding back something extra; you are removing what belongs to him.</p>\n<p>Now, with that out of the way, by the human species the male is dominant. He is structured and tempered that way. In a healthy relationship, the male acts as a male and the female acts as a female, in ways that complement each other. Being that it is inherent in his nature to be dominant and it is also natural for a female to appreciate having a steady pillar at the core of the household, it is therefore a great setup that she treats him as the head of the house in certain ways. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Netivot_Olam%2C_Netiv_Haemuna.1.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharal, Nesivos Olam, Nesiv Ha'emunah, end of chapter 1</a>.)</p>\n<p>As for actual decision making, they are actually partners, obviously. The man is not \"better\". This is indeed a fine line to walk, but you can think of it as both working on the same script in which the man, or father, is the decision maker that decides with his wife. Dominant, but not superior. With the above reference in mind, he needs the position of authority, and she would be happy to defer that position in a healthy relationship.</p>\n<p>I say this is a fine line because we have the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.59a.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 59</a> telling us how careful one must be not to offend his wife, and the Maharal in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Netivot_Olam%2C_Netiv_Ahavat_Reia.2.3?vhe=OYW&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nesivos Olam</a> explains that this is applies particularly to a wife, since the husband is in charge while she isn't actually subservient to him. When he abuses his position to mistreat her, there is that added tension of an equally free person being subjected to his rule, which is made worse since the domination is not baseless.</p>\n<p>This is already long winded, but you can see the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.59a.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 59a</a> which discusses following the wife's advice.

But specifically, the creation of the Jewish people was done for His glory. Indeed, with the creation of the Jews, all of Creation was perfected to bring His glory into the world. Remember the days of old, for from the beginning all languages were included in the Holy Language, as it is said, \"One language, if only now we could understand it\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.11.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 11:6</a>). Then it was divided.

As it is stated: “A land of thick darkness, as\ndarkness itself; a land of the shadow of death, without any order”\n(Job 10:22).

I have copy/pasted from Sefaria, with Steinsaltz commentary in between:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>״וַיִּקְרָא אֶל מֹשֶׁה וַיְדַבֵּר״, לָמָּה הִקְדִּים קְרִיאָה\nלְדִיבּוּר? לִימְּדָה תּוֹרָה דֶּרֶךְ אֶרֶץ, שֶׁלֹּא יֹאמַר אָדָם\nדָּבָר לַחֲבֵירוֹ אֶלָּא אִם כֵּן קוֹרֵהוּ. מְסַיַּיע לֵיהּ לְרַבִּי\nחֲנִינָא. דְּאָמַר רַבִּי חֲנִינָא: לֹא יֹאמַר אָדָם דָּבָר לַחֲבֵירוֹ\nאֶלָּא אִם כֵּן קוֹרֵהוּ. <strong>״לֵאמֹר״, אָמַר רַבִּי (מוּסְיָא בַּר\nבְּרֵיהּ דְּרַבִּי מַסְיָא מִשְּׁמֵיהּ דְּרַבִּי מוּסְיָא) רַבָּה:\nמִנַּיִין לָאוֹמֵר דָּבָר לַחֲבֵירוֹ שֶׁהוּא בְּבַל יֹאמַר עַד\nשֶׁיֹּאמַר לוֹ: לֵךְ אֱמוֹר — שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וַיְדַבֵּר ה׳ אֵלָיו\nמֵאֹהֶל מוֹעֵד לֵאמֹר״.</strong></p>\n<p>The verse says: “And He called unto Moses, and the Lord spoke unto him\nfrom within the Tent of Meeting, saying” (Leviticus 1:1). Why does the\nverse mention calling before speaking, and God did not speak to him at\nthe outset? The Torah is teaching etiquette: A person should not say\nanything to another unless he calls him first. This supports the\nopinion of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina said: A person should not say\nanything to another unless he calls him first. <strong>With regard to the\nterm concluding the verse: “Saying,” Rabbi Musya, grandson of Rabbi\nMasya, said in the name of Rabbi Musya the Great: From where is it\nderived with regard to one who tells another some matter, that it is\nincumbent upon the latter not to say it to others until the former\nexplicitly says to him: Go and tell others? As it is stated: “And the\nLord spoke to him from within the Tent of Meeting, saying [lemor].”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short: Hashem adds \"lemor\" at the end as a permission and instruction for Moshe to go ahead and pass on the information to the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This might or might not answer your question and is being written for someone who is into Torah codes.</p>\n<p>If you are knowledgeable in mathematics/ statistics etc AND believe in the concept of the Torah codes, you will see that the redundancy that is present in words repeating themselves helps maintain the coded words in the text.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Looking for sources that support needing a mechitzah in shul for activities other than davening\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What are sources that support having a mechitzah or for gatherings in shul outside of davening such as kiddush, adult education, or other seudas mitzvah? Also helpful are sources that are against not having one. Thank you</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein writes that for gatherings that are non-obligatory, such as weddings, he is in doubt as to the need for a mechitzah. He proceeds to bring a number of proofs that there is no obligation to erect a mechitzah for non-obligatory events, as we find concerning eating the Korban Pesach, and in other sources.</p>\n<p>In another teshuva (Yoreh De’ah Vol. 4) he notes that the obligation for a mechitzah applies only to events that are open to the public, and not to private affairs (such as weddings) that are not open to the general public. For a Torah lecture open to the general public Rav Moshe writes (Orach Chaim 5:11) that there is an obligation of a mechitzah (since it is open to the general public), but if there is no option one should not refrain from teaching in such an environment, where doing so is for Kiruv purposes.</p>\n<p>Other authorities are far more stringent, and write that even at weddings and similar functions there is a full prohibition on mixed seating of men and women. Rav Moshe Sternbuch (Teshuvos VeHanhagos 2:65) writes (concerning South Africa, where most weddings were mixed) that there is no room for leniency, noting that according to the Bach the Simcha Bime’ono blessing is not recited in a mixed environment, and adding that rabbis should refrain from attending such weddings (see also Shut Lev Avraham 1:135, who disputes Rav Moshe’s ruling at length).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is based on the general principle that the <em>Shul</em>, the בית כנסת, is considered to be G-d’s residence (מעונו).</p>\n<p>And in this context, in all places where ten or more congregate, separation is relevant, just like with the בית המקדש.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.55.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit Rabbah 55:7</a> for the concept.</p>\n<p>And this concept is emphasized in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Chasidim.393.1?vhe=Sefer_Chassidim,_Zhitomir,_1857&lang=bi&with=About&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Chassidim 393:1</a> by Rabbi Yehuda HaChassid,who says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתיב (דברי הימים א טז כז) הוד והדר לפניו עוז וחדוה במקומו לכך אמר שהשמחה במעונו. <strong>לכך אמר פסוק שיש בו רמז השם בשמים ובארץ כגון ישמחו השמים ותגל הארץ ר\"ת השם של ארבע אותיות</strong>. כשיש גילה בארץ ברעדה אז שמחה בשמים לפניו. <strong>כל המברך שהשמחה במעונו צריך לחקור אם קיימו וגילו ברעדה אם רעדה במקום גילה.</strong> <strong>אבל</strong> <strong>אם</strong> לוקח אדם <strong>אשה שאינה הגונה</strong> <strong>או</strong> היא לוקחת <strong>איש שאין הגון או שניהם אינם הגונים. או אין תרבות שם ונבול פה ביניהם. או נשים יושבות בין האנשים שהרהורים שם לא יתכן לברך שהשמחה במעונו. ועל אלה וכיוצא בהם נאמר (ירמיהו טו יז) לא ישבתי בסוד משחקים ואעלוזה. וכתיב (ישעיהו כח ח) כי כל שלחנות מלאו קיא צואה בלי מקום</strong> לא אבוא שמוע בגימטריא עשרה אומר שכינה לא אבו שמוע דברי תורה ולשמחה מה זו עושה כתיב <strong>מה זו עושה בין תלמידי חכמים ובין לצים כל מצוה הבאה עבירה על ידה מוטב שלא יעשה המצוה כמו מצוה לשמח החתן.</strong> <strong>ואם יש שם פריצי' ויודע שבלא פריצות לא יהיה או אינו יכול להיות בלא הרהור או אינו יכול להיות מלראות בנשים אל יהיה שם</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are <em>very strong words</em> from Rabbi Yehuda HaChassid and he is not mentioning mechitza at all, but the possibility, or worse, the  likelihood of frivolity. He says in such a place it is better not to be present, even for a mitzvah like a wedding.</p>\n<p>And it shouldn't be missed that the posuk from Tehillim 96:11 (<em>and also 1 Divrei HaYomim 16:31</em>) that Rabbi Yehuda HaChassid uses to illustrate this concept actually contains <strong>two names of G-d</strong>, the one from the <em>Roshei Teivot</em> pertains to the men (יהוה) and the one from the <em>Sofei Teivot</em> (in reverse order) pertains to the women (צלמו). And <em>these two names are in separate locations</em> (beginning and end of the words), <em>not mixing or touching</em>.</p>\n<p>The balance of this answer can be found in <a href=\"https://nleresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/The-Beit-Knesset.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">part 5 of the following web site</a> dealing with the subject of the need to separate men and women in the Beit Knesset.</p>\n<p>The concept of the separation of men and women in the Beit Knesset is learned from the practice which was instituted in the Temple like is mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.51b.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 51b</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּמוֹצָאֵי יוֹם טוֹב כּוּ׳. <strong>מַאי תִּיקּוּן גָּדוֹל? אָמַר רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר:</strong> כְּאוֹתָהּ שֶׁשָּׁנִינוּ: חֲלָקָה הָיְתָה בָּרִאשׁוֹנָה. וְהִקִּיפוּהָ גְּזוּזְטְרָא, <strong>וְהִתְקִינוּ שֶׁיְּהוּ נָשִׁים יוֹשְׁבוֹת מִלְמַעְלָה וַאֲנָשִׁים מִלְּמַטָּה.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The men and women are seated separately. The women are seated above and the men are below preventing the men from viewing the women.</p>\n<p>There are some important points regarding the details mentioned in Sukkah 51b that should be noted.</p>\n<p>It mentions the differences between the first Temple and the second Temple. In general, <em>the sanctity of the first Temple was greater than the sanctity of the second Temple</em>.</p>\n<p>In the description of the first Temple, both the men and the women stood. In the second Temple, the language used refers to <em>sitting</em> (יוֹשְׁבוֹת). The general rule is that only the King and the Kohen Gadol are permitted to sit in the courtyards.</p>\n<p>It mentions in regard to the time of the second Temple, both the Temple in Jerusalem and the similar copy (<em>the Beit Knesset</em>) that was in Alexandria in Egypt.</p>\n<p>It emphasizes that this principle of increased separation was manifest both in regard to the Beit Knesset in Alexandria (the men were separated according to their trades/professions) and with the second Temple in Jerusalem (the place where the women stood in the Women's Courtyard was reversed with that of the men and ultimately the balconies were built to physically elevate the women above the level of the men and to have the women sit). This <em><strong>increased separation</strong> is a sign of the <strong>decreased sanctity</strong></em> of the second Temple.</p>\n<p>There are two reasons mentioned as to why this separation was made. The first is according to the view of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sukkah.5.2?lang=bi&with=Rambam&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam in his commentary to Mishnah Sukkah 5:2</a> which says that it was to prevent the men from gazing at the women.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שהיו מכינים מקום לנשים ומקום גדור לאנשים, ומקום הנשים למעלה על מקום האנשים גבוה ממנו <strong>כדי שלא יסתכלו האנשים בנשים.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second reason is like is discussed by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein in <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=916&st=&pgnum=95&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igros Moshe, Orach Chaim, Vol. I, Simonim 39-43</a>. Reb Moshe says the reason is to prevent mixing.</p>\n<p>Reb Moshe bases this on wording from Rambam used in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Shofar%2C_Sukkah_and_Lulav.8.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Shofar Sukkah v'Lulav 8:12</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיו מתקנין במקדש מקום לנשים מלמעלה ולאנשים מלמטה כדי <strong>שלא יתערבו אלו עם אלו.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reb Moshe goes further in <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=916&st=&pgnum=99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igrot Moshe, Orach Chaim, Volume 1, 39-40</a> to clarify that  this concept of the separation of men and women is because of the obligation to avoid frivolity in the solemn environment of the Beit Knesset.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ורק בשביל קלות ראש הוא חיוב המחיצה</strong>.\nקלות ראש שהוא להרבות שיחה ביניהם ולנגיעה בידיהם וכדומה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reb Moshe explains that <em>frivolity</em> is the idea of talking and the touching of hands (perhaps like when passing food between one another) and similar things.</p>\n<p>It should be noted concerning the responsa in Igrot Moshe that his language is with many qualifications, in particular about what is and is not considered to be a Beit Knesset. Even a place for fixed prayer and with a regular quorum may not be assumed to have the status of a Beit Knesset. There are about half a dozen letters discussing the subject and many refer back to earlier letters, clarifying his view. The question posed here is about a “Shul”, which is usually understood to mean a valid Beit Knesset. The responsa from Igrot Moshe must be read in that that context.</p>\n<p>And this concern over frivolity is also the ruling from Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.149.1?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 149:1</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>צְרִיכִין לִזָּהֵר שֶׁלֹּא יֹאכְלוּ אֲנָשִׁים וְנָשִׁים בְּחֶדֶּר אֶחָד.</strong> שֶׁאִם אוֹכְלִים אֲנָשִׁים וְנָשִׁים בְּחֶדֶר אֶחָד, <strong>אֵין אוֹמְרִים שֶהַשִּׂמְחָה בִּמְעוֹנוֹ, כִּי אֵין שִׂמְחָה כְּשֶיֵצֶר הָרַע שׁוֹלֵט</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A similar distinction is made by the Tzitz Eliezer, vol. 7, siman 8, who emphasizes that the type of mechitzah required for the Beit HaKnesset during prayer must make it impossible for men to see women. He says traditionally this was a floor to ceiling wall with small holes high up the wall to allow for the sound of the service to be heard by the women. But a different type of mechitzah for the purpose of modesty and to prevent frivolity is less stringent. It can be used for things like lectures where men and women will attend together, whether organized or not. But he emphasizes that even in these situations not involving prayer, some type of mechitzah is required.</p>\n<p>In this context it is worth noting the comment of Rabbi, Dr. Yoseph B. Soloveitchik who wrote in his book on Mechitzah, Pg. 13 the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The separation of the sexes in the synagogue is a basic tenet in our faith.</strong> It dates back to the very dawn of our religious halachic community, <strong>and</strong> <strong>constitutes a Torah prohibition which can never be abandoned by any legislative act on the part of a Rabbinic or lay body regardless of its numeric strength or so-called prominence.</strong> What was decreed by God can never be undone by human hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I was studying the use of the word בר in the Mishlei Shlomoh and I noticed that many important translations translate <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.31.2?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 31:2</a> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"What, <strong>my son</strong>? and what, <strong>son</strong> of my womb? and what, <strong>son</strong> of my vows?\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(This is the Koren Jerusalem Bible, for example)</p>\n<p>But I found that בר in Hebrew means \"pure\" or \"chosen\". It means \"son\" only in Aramaic.</p>\n<p>Indeed if I translate the verse: <em>\"What, <strong>my chosen</strong>? What, <strong>chosen</strong> of my womb? And what, <strong>chosen</strong> of my vows?\"</em> not only makes sense, but it also fits much better with the explanation of the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.70b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 70b:3-4</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“And what, son of my womb?” That is to say: <strong>With regard to all of the\nwomen of your father’s house, once they conceive they no longer see\nthe face of the king, but <strong>I pushed myself in and entered the king’s\nchamber while I was pregnant, so that I might have a son who is strong\nand fair-skinned</strong></strong>. There are times during a woman’s pregnancy when\nintercourse is beneficial for the development of the fetus. Bathsheba\nwas telling Solomon: I did my utmost to ensure that you have extra\nstrength and beauty, and now you use that strength and appeal to\npursue drink. “And what, son of my vows?” That is to say: <strong>With regard\nto all of the women of your father’s house, they would take vows while\nthey were pregnant, saying: Let me have a son who is fit to be king.\nBut I, by contrast, took a vow and said: Let me have a son who is\ndiligent and filled with knowledge of the Torah and fit for prophecy.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The William Davidson Talmud)</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yochanan seems to say that the words בַּר־בִּטְנִי (son/chosen of my womb) and בַּר־נְדָרָי\n(son/chosen of my vows) indicates that her son was better than the children of the other women, and he also explains <strong>how</strong>. But if the word just means \"son\" why should it state that her son is different from the others?\nThe translation \"chosen\" in the sense of \"better\", \"excellent\" is similar in my eyes to Songs 6:9: בָּרָה הִיא לְיוֹלַדְתָּהּ <em>\"she is the pure/chosen/excellent one of her mother\"</em>.\nTherefore, I don't understand why they translate \"son\" even in the Talmud. I tried to read some commentary on the Talmud (using Sefaria), but they are not translated in English and I can't understand properly, I'm not so skilled in Hebrew.\nWhat do you think about that? I need a little help.\nThank you for the eventual answers :)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it okay for Jewish people to read Narnia or Lord of the Rings?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Narnia series was written by a Christian named C.S. Lewis who also wrote books that argued for Christianity. The Narnia series is supposed to contain Christian themes, which might be there for someone looking for them, but especially in the movies it just seems like a kids' story.</p>\n<p>J.R.R. Tolkien, a friend of C.S. Lewis who wrote The Lord of the Rings, was also a Christian, although he apparently claimed that the books were not religious. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Middle-earth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Middle-earth</a>)</p>\n<p>There are a couple questions that need to be addressed about these, especially considering their popularity:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Should these books/movies be avoided on the basis that the authors were Christians? If so, what about everything else written by authors who are part of other religions?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Is it a content issue? At face value the Narnia books and movies don't seem to directly say anything about Christianity, even if the author did intend it.

Where should we draw the line?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Most of the sources I have found address reading books or listening to music by non-Jews. Films are a different issue, because they can often be more immodest than the books they were based on. I don't know whether films could necessarily be compared to books, even if they are modest (one concern that comes to mind are the more powerful impressions they leave, as opposed to books, because they play with more of your senses). So I'll be addressing the books:</p>\n<p><em>Should these books/movies be avoided on the basis that the authors were Christians? If so, what about everything else written by authors who are part of other religions?</em></p>\n<p>I have not seen anyone suggest that books should be avoided simply on the basis that their authors were Christian, or any other sort of non-Jew.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/rabbi/487\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shmuel Ariel</a> <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/ask/101317\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrote</a> regarding reading books written by non-Jews (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...[we have not found in halacha any prohibition of reading] all books written by non-Jews, from a fear that ideas related to idolatry and heresy may be mixed in. It is prohibited to read books that contradict emunah, but it is not prohibited to read a book written by a someone who is not a believing Jew...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I recommend reading his full teshuva if you are able (it's in Hebrew).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yctorah.org/staff/rabbi-ilay-ofran/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Ilay Ofran</a> also <a href=\"https://judaism.walla.co.il/item/2708374\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrote</a> similarly that as long as the material was proper (modest), then it would be allowed. Not reading something written by a non-Jew simply because the author is not Jewish may be regarded as potentially racist.</p>\n<p><em>Is it a content issue?

Where should we draw the line?</em></p>\n<p>Yes-- to a certain extent:</p>\n<p>Rabbi Gil Student made a <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2005/12/narnia-for-jews/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">post</a> on the subject of reading the Chronicles of Narnia. He argued that though Narnia is heavily-laden with Christian themes, it is not obvious unless you are very familiar with these themes and/or have the issue pointed out to you (I humbly agree, from my own experience, which is similar to that of Rabbi Student). Therefore, reading these books does not qualify as studying Christian theology.<br />\nHowever:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Regardless of the halakhic details — meaning, even if you can find ways around the possible issues discussed above — my rabbi and I agree that reading these books and seeing these movies are certainly not recommended. Stay away from other religions in your entertainment needs. There’s plenty of other ways to relax and enjoy yourself without having to partake in subtle Christian allegories.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Piron\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shai Piron</a> was <a href=\"https://www.kipa.co.il/%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%90%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A2-%D7%91%D7%93%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">asked</a> about Sci-Fi/fantasy novels and films both in general, and as an example Lord of the Rings was mentioned. He answered in general terms and I think his point is important. Here's a translation of the Q&A:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Q. For a while now I've been hearing various opinions on the subject of reading Sci-Fi novels and watching their films (if there are such)<br />\nThe main issue is regarding books that feature magic and sorcery such the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy and the Harry Potter book series.<br />\nMy question, is whether those that say it is not permissible to read these books have a halachic basis?<br />\nAnd as one who really enjoys reading these sorts of books-<br />\nIs it allowed? What's the problem with that? And why exactly does this problem exist?</p>\n<p>A. B\"h<br />\nHello,<br />\nIf you regard these books as reflecting reality, it is certainly not allowed. There is a great danger of idolatry and I do not see any way to permit such a thing. But if you simply enjoy stretching your imagination via these books, from the powerful descriptions and the ability to create films with so many special effects - there is no prohibition.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Ariel further noted in his answer some general points regarding judging what material could be read and what couldn't:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Novels or history books where idolatrous practices are mentioned in passing, as things that simply occurred, and not in a manner intended to glorify these books are not prohibited.</li>\n<li>The same is true regarding books that borrow quotes from idolatrous works. If it is presented as something someone said and not intended to glorify it, then it is not prohibited.</li>\n<li>This is even more true when the author himself does not believe in these things.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example that comes to mind, particularly of the third point, are the Cosmere novels by Brandon Sanderson. Sanderson himself is a Mormon, but his books often present various fictional idolatrous religions and cults. Setting aside whether his novels have Mormon themes, it is clear that he himself does not believe in any of the religions he made up.</p>\n<p>To sum up their points, in general - these books are not prohibited. However, one should take care to see how the material is presented and what you, the reader, are taking away from the book.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>While I am not one with semicha, able to give to give a halachic decision, I do recall hearing about Rav Aharon Lichtenstein being an expert on Milton's \"Paradise Lost\"</p>\n<p>To quote an article on the OU site (link <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/life/inspiration/rav-aharon-lichtenstein-a-personal-reminiscence/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)\n\"As is well known, Rav Aharon was a proponent of studying literature, because as he once wrote, “the humanities deepen our understanding of man: his nature, functions and duties.” When I was studying Paradise Lost in college, Rav Aharon said to me, “I envy you, because you can read Milton now for the first time.”\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As a Jewish lover of LOTR and the world of Tolkien's creation, I would like to offer a somewhat different viewpoint. From my own semi-extensive delving into this fantasy world and, being somewhat familiar with the seminal works and beliefs of Christianity, <strong>I would submit that Tolkien's world is far more Jewish in almost all ways than it is Christian</strong>. I will try to summarize my thoughts here.</p>\n<p>To begin with, I want to note that LOTR and The Hobbit really don't delve into the mythology of Tolkien's world. <strong>If things like wizards, elves, dwarves, dungeons and dragons aren't your thing, you should just avoid fantasy altogether</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you're concerned about the overall mythology of the world being Christian, I wouldn't worry too much because you won't really find much of Tolkien's mythos in either LOTR or The Hobbit. They are both basically rollicking adventure stories in which good triumphs over evil thanks to folks of all origins banding together in the face of darkness.</p>\n<p>You can find a fairly complete presentation in The Silmarillian and the works of Christopher Tolkien, who was appointed by JRR to be his literary executor. In my opinion if there's anything Christian to be found in Tolkien's writings, it would be in those works, but as stated - I believe these all to be far more Jewish in nature than Christian. Actually <strong>I rather think that people (Christians) think that these works are Christian simply because they lack knowledge of Judaism</strong>. Here's my take on these works, which contain the mythology of Tolkien's world:</p>\n<p>First, at the beginning of all things there is a creator (Eru) who is One, who is <strong>repeatedly called One and never three</strong> as in the Christian trinity.</p>\n<p>Eru creates a choir of angels, or powers, called the Valar, whom largely interact with the world on his behalf. When one of the 'angels', i.e. Valar begins to stray from his guidance, the others are shocked. He begins to commit evil. However <strong>Eru reveals that in the end times it will be revealed that all things are his will</strong>, and that all evils will ultimately revealed tot have been for the good. This, again, is in my opinion arguably more Jewish than Christian. In the Christian telling, Satan is the very root of evil and there will be no good wrought by his works - even unintended good. He wages war against God and his angels, and both sides prepare for that eventual war. In the Jewish telling, Satan is God's prosecutor and necessary for things like free will. All things including Satan serve God whether they know it or not (although the Jewish version of Satan is faithful to God). Thus the characters of Melkor/Morgoth - and later his successor Sauron - is more akin to the Christian Satan but <strong>the universe in which Melkor and Sauron live is more Jewish</strong>. Melkor thinks he's going against the one creator Eru but unbeknownst to him he is simply part of the plan of creation.</p>\n<p>Going further, perhaps the greatest difference between Judaism and Christianity is the Christian belief in Jesus as not only messiah in the Jewish sense as the one who will save the world but also the elevation of that person to divine status akin to God and even part of God (and worshipped as God). <strong>In Tolkien's world, there is no Jesus or similar figure whatsoever</strong>. There are many heroes some of whom are essentially angelic and others who are terrestrial in origin.</p>\n<p>All sentient beings, like in Judaism, have been endowed as such by directly being given the spirit of the creator, called the 'Eternal Flame' in Tolkien's writings - just as the Hebrew God breathes ruach into the first man. It is this spirit that gives Eru's creations a life of their own accord and while some beings are far more powerful than others, all men are terrestrial and mortal. <strong>Crucially, there are no virgin births and no men who are equal to Eru, or part of Eru, or in some way more of a child of Eru than any others</strong>. Indeed all people are called the Children of Iluvatar, another name for Eru, just as many Jewish writings state or imply that we all are children of God.</p>\n<p>I could give other examples but just to keep things short and summarize: Tolkien's world has one all powerful one god whom we are children of. Eru is frequently referred to as the 'one', never the 'three' as I n the trinity. All things serve the will of the creator even if they don't know it. His world has no Jesus or Jesus-like figure and no trinity. The hearts of men can be corrupted but as in Judaism all will ultimately prove to be for the good, as is the will of God.</p>\n\n\n",

(Mind transference is very possible though not practiced at great length).</p>\n<p>Proof of this is in the book of Rabbi Arye Kaplan, If you were g-d.</p>\n<p>He puts a very good question in the book, If humans are only a collection of their thoughts, (the soul that resides in the mind) and when a person dies their energy or soul becomes part of the matrix or Hashem, (well the part they attached to Hashem) so you can transfer that mind with its   consciousness (The consciousness that is attached to Hashem) to another body then you have the same person (the mind) in another body, the body being a golem  or an empty vessel until the new consciousness take control of the new body,  granted that the old body isn't here with the same consciousness, then there would be two of you. You think this sounds odd, look into Sefer raziel, if you were to take another soul in you, your body becomes a host of several souls, (This is done differently though same <em><strong>concept</strong></em>).</p>\n<p>Another concept Shomer Yisrael, a guardian of Israel, that a man, elevates their mind and body,( The body through the mind as the mind covers the whole body) and guards the soul of many people, so his Mind+Body if taken to a further extent becomes a minyan (If he has more than ten souls connected to their body) now if this were the case the rabbi would no longer be the Normal human individual you are aware of, their mind is in the astral world where they can accomplish this task, so a real example for what we have just explained is as follows. You go to a major tzadic,sage,kabbalist, (Rashash also known as the second Rashbi, his student Rabbi Meir Levi, Rabbi Peretz, Bal Hasulam, Rabbi Avraham sutton, his teacher Rabbi Arye Kaplan, Rabbi Yakove Hillel The current top Kabbalist that can actually perform open miracles, on par with Rabbi Yaakov addes of the Kotel, Rabbi Kaduri, Baba sali, his brother Baba Meir, their sons and grandsons and nephews, The Chalban,   Reb Chaim,  his son Rabbi Shmuel, his grandson Reb Yanky,  Admor Y. Pinto, Admor D Ch. Pinto, Admor of Malta, Rabbi Yk. Pinto, Rabbi M pinto, Rabbi Krisspin, Rabbi S. Arush, Rabbi L. Brody, Rabbi Admor A. Titlebaum (Satmer),  Admor Biale, Rabbi Yosef Dayan, An American rabbi and Kabbalist Ariel Bartzadok, Rabbi A. Anava, Rabbi Y. Ginsberg, Rabbi Avraham Ziti, The Lubavitcher rebbes, Rabbi Berg, Rabbi Winselberg, Rabbi Y.Zwaig and some sons,  Rabbi Manis Friedman, and Rabbi Shmuel. Eliyahu Chief Kabbalist and chief rabbi of sfat, and many more That were not mentioned though are very well known to have special powers and can accomplish unimaginable feats, and yes some of these are woman as well though the ones mentioned are the main individuals that carry an extremely heavy burden, the rest almost follow instructions from these individuals as they were taught by them one way or another how to use their skills) <strong>SO</strong>,They will connect with you if they see that they are meant to connect with you, in a very high level, (note this is not with everyone, some they just give an advise they were asked and that's it, seeing the person does not need, or is not asked of these rabbis by shamayim to connect with them).  Once this is done you are brought into <em><strong>their</strong></em> divine space, at times you can see things in your mind, that they once saw some time ago, and or experience things they had experienced a time ago, (it can be a current event too). This is when they pray In an abnormal fashion. So these individuals carry the strength = life of thousands of people on their mind or soul in the astral world, that they are responsible for protecting, healing, guiding... taking the roll of a shomer Yisrael. The question here rises, if they were to hold a minyan in their minds doing Sefer yetzira,(Telepathy) would it count, if you can create a space in your mind or the (Astral world) where ten people that are far apart can connect In real time and answer amen and so on, then their soul is in a place where Tefila is taking place, and if they are clearly aware of what's happening in that place, then they are obligated to respond, now if ten people are there, extremely connected body mind and soul, while there's a separation, then its like they are actually there.  So if the rabbis mentioned above were to want to, lets say have a minyan on their own without having ten people actually with them, all they need to do is <em><strong>initiate</strong></em> ten people from afar and there you go. This is more complicated in action, than explained.</p>\n<p>So if a lifeless body (Golem) were to attain this new soul or consciousness that takes over the golems body,  is it still a golem?</p>\n<p>If you were to connect a body to the astral world where they constantly receive energy and a soul that takes over the body is it a lifeless body? aka, a Clone.</p>\n<p>No, because it has a soul and it is receiving energy or life.</p>\n\n\n",

Rashi, who makes it his mission to explain the \"pshat\", the simple meaning of the Torah, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.7.16.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויסגור ה' בעדו. הֵגֵן עָלָיו שֶׁלֹּא יִשְׁבְּרוּהָ, הִקִּיף הַתֵּבָה\nדֻּבִּים וַאֲרָיוֹת וְהָיוּ הוֹרְגִים בָּהֶם</p>\n<p>AND THE LORD SHUT HIM IN — He protected him so that they could not\nsmash up the Ark: He surrounded the Ark (thus enclosing it\nסגר) with bears and lions which killed some of them (Genesis Rabbah\n32:8).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi takes issue with this unnecessary detail. Once Noach entered the Ark, and closed the door, that's all that should be needed to protect against the waters . Rather Hashem sealed the door to fulfil His covenant with Noach (6:18, see Rashi and Bereshit Rabba there) to protected him from the people of the generation who would try to kill him (Siftei Chachamim).</p>\n<p>Whatever standard one holds for Torah exegesis, it seems that there is a very strong hint that the people of the generation did show up to the Ark at the last minute, and Hashem had to intervene and close the door Himself. Our rabbinic tradition is that they tried to destroy it, rather than enter it. Follow the sources, marvel at the logic, and see if you feel it is the best explanation.</p>\n<p>As Rashi points out, the most simple meaning of all is that Hashem sealed it from the waters, not peoples. It is still an unnecessary detail that needs explanation, and there are other explanations. E.g. Radak that Hashem sealed the Ark to prevent leaks against this huge 40 day rain that was going to take place.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In addition to the above answer, our sages, brought in Rashi (7-12) say that when G'd started the flood, He at first made it fall gently, <strong>in order that if the people would repent</strong>, it might prove a rain of blessing; but when they did not repent it became a destructive flood. This shows that they could have entered the Ark, even after the doors were sealed, if only they would have repented.</p>\n\n\n",

In light of that, there are a few threads that the relations in 4:1 took place after the expulsion.</p>\n<p>The earliest traditional sources giving details of the creation of Adam and Chava and their having relations in the Garden, prior to expulsion come from two places. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avot_D%27Rabbi_Natan.1.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot of Rabbi Natan 1:8</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How was Adam created?

In the fifth hour, his orifices were opened. In the sixth hour, he was given breath. In the seventh hour, he stood up on his legs. <strong>In the eighth hour, <em>he was paired with Eve</em>. In the ninth hour, <em>he was brought into the Garden of Eden</em>.</strong> In the tenth hour, he was commanded [not to eat from the tree]. In the eleventh hour, he disgraced himself. In the twelfth hour, he was driven out and left, which fulfills the words of the verse (Psalms 49:13), “Man does not spend even one night in honor.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.11.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer 11:7</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The day had twelve hours; in the first hour He collected the dust for (the body of) Adam, in the second (hour) He formed it into a mass, in the third (hour) He gave it its shape, in the fourth (hour) He endowed || it with breath, in the fifth (hour) he stood on his feet, in the sixth (hour) he called the (animals by their) names, <strong>in the seventh (hour) <em>Eve was joined to him (in wedlock)</em></strong>, in the eighth (hour) they were commanded concerning the fruits of the tree, <strong>in the ninth (hour) <em>they went up to (their) couch as two and descended as four</em></strong>, in the tenth (hour) they transgressed His commandment, in the eleventh (hour) they were judged, <strong>in the twelfth (hour) <em>they were driven forth</em></strong>, as it is said, \"So he drove out the man\" (Gen. 3:24).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The comment by Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrkanus for the ninth hour, that <em>they went up to their bed as two, and descended as four</em>, is referring to copulation and reproduction. Pregnancy and birth were without the consequence of the transgression of eating from the fruit yet. Gestation was almost instantaneous and without difficulty. <em>(It's worth noting that the idea that this is the normal condition for human conception and birth is also found in Talmud and elsewhere in Torah literature.)</em> Their first two male children (with their accompanying female twins) took place in this hour.</p>\n<p>Note, none of the <em><strong>following</strong></em> explicitly states that they <em>didn't</em> have relations before expulsion. But these are later sources than the first two mentioned above. It is more appropriate to assume that these later sources also had access to these first two sources and were familiar with them. So these later comments are emphasizing and contrasting the change of state in regard to procreation prior to and after the expulsion from the Garden of Eden.</p>\n<p>Radak is probably the closest to making that point as he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והאדם ידע את אשתו, seeing that their libido had developed, they\nengaged in marital relations, Chavah became pregnant and gave birth\nafter 7 or 9 months.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The others state that the procreation after expulsion was due to the necessity to procreate now that they were mortal:</p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachaye:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והאדם ידע את חוה אשתו, “and man had been intimate with his wife\nChavah, etc.” After Adam had realized that he had been expelled from\nGan Eden, that death had been decreed for him, and that he would not\nlive indefinitely, it became necessary for him to have sexual\nrelations with his wife in order to assure himself of children for\nposterity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ibn Ezra:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AND THE MAN. When Adam realized that he would not live forever he saw\nthe need of perpetuating the human race. Eve concurred</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that in general, there are two holy reasons to engage in relations, one is to increase closeness and oneness between husband and wife (become one flesh - a commandment given <em>de facto</em> before the sin). The other is to fulfil the commandment to procreate. The main debate centres around whether the intimacy in the garden also led to pregnancy or they had intimate relations <em>again</em> after expulsion.</p>\n<p>See this Siftei Chachamim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Children were born to him. Rashi used the expression “children were\nborn to him” rather than “he knew his wife” because otherwise Rashi\nwould be implying that Adam knew her only after he was exiled, not\nbefore. [And this is not true,] for earlier, on the verse of “This at\nlast is bone of my bones...” (2:23), Rashi says: “Adam attempted to\nfind a mate amongst all the animals... until he discovered Chavah.”\nThis implies that Adam had relations with Chavah at that point. This\nanswers another question: How does Rashi know that Adam’s “knowing his\nwife” before he was exiled included conception and birth as well?\nPerhaps it was referring only to relations. The answer is: “This at\nlast is bone of my bones...” already taught us that Adam had\nrelations. Thus, the verse “The man knew his wife...” perforce\n[includes conception and birth].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>So, to summarise. I am unaware of any Rabbis that <em>explicitly</em> state that they didn't engage in relations in the garden before (or even after) the sin, nor would I expect that this would be a point made as it wouldn't be of interest - in Torah, intimacy between husband and wife is considered nothing but holy and good (although like anything holy and good, it can become profaned and corrupted, God forbid).</strong></p>\n\n\n",

A couple of years ago I collected some different interpretations of this gemara:</p>\n<p>Yaakov Levi in his book Bikoret Ha'Talmud suggested that at least the Za'atutei Scroll was a Torah scroll which had (at least) one word changed as a result of the changes that the 72 sages made when they created the original LXX. Za'atutei, which comes from a Greek word that means pure/holy, was used instead of Na'arei or Atzilei, so that the Greek won't think that these people were the Jewish equivalent of Ganymede, cupbearer of the Olympian gods.</p>\n<p>Solomon Tzeitlin in <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1453840\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> essay argued that this is an ahistorical aggadah intended to legitimize the introduction of the Hebrew <em>matre lectionis</em>, the usage of the אהו\"י letters as vowels.</p>\n<p>Shmaryahu Talmon in <a href=\"https://bibleproject.huji.ac.il/sites/default/files/he_bible_project/files/talmon_s.2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> essay argued that each of three books was a Torah scroll that represented an entirely different tradition of the Torah text, and were different from one another in other respects, not just with these few words. Any scroll representing a non-canonical tradition of the Torah was brought to the Temple for a formal ceremony (the \"two against one\") to officially reject its text as one of the ways used to deal with dissenting Jewish sects.</p>\n<p>I also vaguely recall seeing a suggestion that these books weren't Torah scroll but masorah books, books that explain how to correctly right a Torah scroll. Each book represented a variant masorah, but I can't find the source.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think Talmon's explanation makes the most sense, and also serves to explain the relation between these three books and the Sefer Azarah: The Sefer Azarah represented the ancient canon, while the other three refer to a custom of bringing problematic variant scrolls to the temple to be rejected.</p>\n\n\n",

And she said, \"I have acquired a husband, יהוה (<em>pronounced</em> אדני).</p>\n<p>Several things are being relayed in the Hebrew in a very abbreviated and concise way.</p>\n<p>The name of their son (Kayin) is related to the action that they performed. The action being emphasized here is: how marriage, <em><strong>the bonding of Husband and Wife</strong></em>, is accomplished. It is a halachic/legal process of <em>acquisition</em>, from the Hebrew root, קנה.</p>\n<p>Torah law states that <em>one of the requirements and methods of marriage</em> is through sexual intercourse between a man and woman. You <em>acquire the status of a married, bonded couple</em> through this act. This is part of the intention in the words recited by a Groom during his wedding, namely:</p>\n<p>הרי את מקודשת לי כדת משה וישראל</p>\n<p><em>Behold, you are sanctified (<em>or dedicated</em>) to/for me according to the law of Moses and Israel.</em></p>\n<p>The second half of the phrase you quote from the Torah brings out several important concepts. The first is the relationship between the Husbands Hebrew name, Adam (אדם), his change of status to <em>Husband</em> (איש) and the written name of G-d (יהוה) which is pronounced and spoken to others as (אדני).</p>\n<p>The <strong>cantillation mark</strong>, <em>Tifcha</em>, under the word Husband (איש) serves somewhat like a comma in the sentence. The phrase, אֶת־יְהֹוָֽה׃, which follows it, is a modifier which relates to the word Husband explaining its meaning.</p>\n<p>Like is emphasized in the beginning of the Torah, the names assigned to everything in Hebrew are related to their essence, being and effect.</p>\n<p>The first man's name, אדם, has a dual meaning according to Torah tradition. The first is that he is <em>Similar to G-d above</em>. (דומה לעליון) This aspect is revealed in Bereshit 2:20, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּקְרָ֨א הָֽאָדָ֜ם שֵׁמ֗וֹת לְכׇל־הַבְּהֵמָה֙ וּלְע֣וֹף הַשָּׁמַ֔יִם וּלְכֹ֖ל חַיַּ֣ת הַשָּׂדֶ֑ה <strong>וּלְאָדָ֕ם</strong> לֹֽא־מָצָ֥א עֵ֖זֶר כְּנֶגְדּֽוֹ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The traditional cantillation mark over the letter Dalet in the word וּלְאָדָ֕ם is called a <em>Zakef Gadol</em>. The form of that cantillation mark is comprised of 2 points and a line, alluding to the letters <em>Yud</em> and <em>Vav</em>. So the <em>Gematria</em> (numerical) value for the Zakef Gadol is 26, which is also the numerical value of G-d's name (יהוה). When man acts according to his <em>most Holy and sanctified potential</em>, he is <em>similar</em> to G-d above, the source and Creator of <em>all</em> (כל) life. All this follows the traditional Torah teaching of Rabbi Menachem Azariyah of Fano.</p>\n<p>The second aspect related to Adam's name is that he is: אדם <strong>מן האדמה</strong>.</p>\n<p>He is literally <em>from the earth</em>. Again, this alludes to the dual meaning of lowliness, meaning extreme humility. Man reveals this potential for Holiness through humility. And through this act of humility, reveals G-d's presence in the whole of Creation, joining the spiritual with the physical, similar to the effect of building G-d's chosen Temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and its precursor, the Mishkan. And the very lowest parts of that Mishkan, what connects and <em>plants</em> it to the earth are its sockets, called in Hebrew אדניים.</p>\n<p>On a final note, you are misunderstanding the meaning of the partial recollection of the story from the Zohar. Until you have learned more, you might want to stick to less esoteric material unless you have a personal teacher to help you to grasp its meaning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Supposedly Cain was the son of the Satan and many think of Isaac as divine conception, not that he had no father but he was the product of Gods direct intervention.</p>\n<p>I assume the sons of the fallen angels would count as well.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Understanding Midrash in a rational manner?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When it comes to non-metaphorical interpretation methods for midrashim and aggadah, there are two concepts for the purposes of this question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Literal</strong>: the story presented by the midrash is factual. If it says Pharaoh was 3 feet tall, he was actually 3 feet tall, historically. Still, it may be that he was 3 feet tall for a supernatural reason.</li>\n<li><strong>Rational</strong>: Not only is it <em>literal</em>, but also there is no other supernatural modification or explanation. In this case, the reason Pharaoh was 3 feet tall was simply because he was someone with dwarfism.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Rambam at the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_on_Mishnah_Sanhedrin.10.1.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">beginning of Hachelek</a> refers to the fools who take Aggadic text literally in a rational way. He is referring to others who held this way. Is anyone familiar with an opinion in the Rishonim/ early Achronim that states one must understand all Aggadic text in such a manner? The Maharsha states one has to believe it literally, but as expounded on (Thanks Rabbi Kaii) by the Gra, he is referring to a non-rational supernatural understanding.</p>\n<p>Does anyone take this to the extreme that one must believe every Midrash in a literal and rational sense?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>This is a non-answer</strong></p>\n<p>I was in shul with a few prominent people over the course of this shabbos, I posed this question to them.

I believe he is qualified to answer the question as someone who has been through the topic and has written on it extensively. He explained there were those Rishonim who understood Midrash as literalists like Rashi and Tosfos - those who lived in France. While Rationalists like Rambam lived in Spain. This was one of the big disagreements between the two camps.</p>\n<p>So it would seem that there would be no one who was on both sides of Rationalism and Literalism.\nSo the answer would therefore be there is no one.</p>\n<p>If I do find a Rishon/early Acharon I will downvote this answer and post a new one.</p>\n<p>Gut Voch</p>\n\n\n",

[Deuteronomy 15:7-8]</p>\n<p>This has been understood to mean that we must support him to the standard to which he is used.  It’s the poor, not the givers, who define what is lacking.  As you wrote, the Talmud recounts that Hillel provided paupers who came from wealthy families with horses and servants to run before them since this was the lifestyle they grew up with.  One time Hillel could not find a slave to run before the horse, so he ran before it himself for three miles. [Ketubot 67b] The Talmud provides other examples in the same page.</p>\n<p>This assumes that the community is first able to support <em>itself</em> to the standard that <em>it</em> is accustomed to, before it offers needy people assistance over and above basic necessities.  The Shulḥan Arukh summarizes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much should be given to the poor? Dei machsoro asher yechsar lo ... All that he lacks... How is that?\nIf he is starving, feed him. If he needs clothing, clothe him.\nIf he needs items for his house, buy him those items for his house.\nEven if he was used to riding on a horse with a servant running ahead of him while he was rich, and now he is poor, buy him the horse and the servant -- each man according to his needs.\nIf he was used to receiving bread, give him bread.\nIf he was used to receiving dough, give him dough.\nIf he was used to having a bed, give him a bed.\nA person fitting to receive hot bread should continue to receive hot bread; cold bread, cold bread.\nIf he was fed into his mouth, feed him into his mouth.\nIf he came to get married, rent a house for him, prepare a bed for him and house utensils, and find him a wife.

    "content": "# Was the angel Ya'akov fought Esau's Angel or Ya'akov's Yetzer ha-ra? Was the wrestling literal?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I discussed with someone recently the incident in Bereshis where Ya'akov wrestles with an angel. It quickly became clear that our understanding of that story was completely different as far as what the angel was, what it signified, and overall, what was happening.</p>\n<p>He said:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The angel was Esau's angel. He did not specify what exactly this meant, but my guess is that this would be Esau's guardian angel whom Esau sent to kill Ya'akov.</li>\n<li>The two of them literally wrestled all night and the angel was actively trying to kill Ya'akov.</li>\n<li>The angel was sent out of revenge by Esau for stealing the birthright.</li>\n<li>The blessing was not given willingly.</li>\n<li>The hip injury was exactly what it appears to be.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I said:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The angel was Ya'akov's yetzer ha-ra, given human/angelic form.</li>\n<li>The wrestling was a spiritual fight. Ya'akov was in no physical/mortal danger per se.</li>\n<li>The angel was a literal angel, but also Ya'akov's guilt for cheating his brother out of the birthright and his evil inclinations, because he on some level felt what he did was wrong. The fight was thus a fight against himself more than an external battle.</li>\n<li>The blessing/rebirth was Ya'akov \"maturing\" in a sense, becoming a full tzaddik by overcoming his yetzer ha-ra and directing it towards good rather than evil.</li>\n<li>The hip injury is a metaphor for how fighting our inner urges can cause lasting damage but ultimately makes us stronger/better people, as it did for Ya'akov.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Neither of us had direct sources to cite for what we had heard, other than \"my rabbi\". With this in mind: Are there reasons to take one conclusion over the other? Are they simply different interpretations or levels of Torah and are both correct? I see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/97033/eisavs-angel-fought-yaakov-why-eisavs-angel-and-not-gavriel\">here</a> that there exists at least one more interpretation, that being that the angel was Gavriel.

For example, in their book <em>The Chosen Few: How Education Shaped Jewish History, 70-1492</em>, historians Maristella Botticini and Zvi Eckstein make the case that Jewish history in the period from destruction of the Second Temple to the expulsion from Spain was shaped by a process of self-selection, where those who chose to be educated, often becoming urban commercial agents, were those who remained Jews whereas many, perhaps the majority, of people did not follow this path and became assimilated into their host nations. This book looks in detail at the process by which a mostly rural agricultural people with only a small minority of educated elites became \"The Jews\" as we think of us today: valuing education and scholarship and seeing that as an integral part of our survival mechanism.</p>\n<p>The book eschews any supernatural causes of Jewish survival, favoring instead a naturalistic and scientific approach where education and adaptation to urban settings allowed them to fill an economic niche while also providing needed intellectual and cultural stability to withstand the historical forces around them. In simple terms, this process of self-selection means that those Jews who adapted to this new social model were able to survive as a distinct culture whereas those who were not able to adapt did not.</p>\n\n\n",

The concept of \"the Torah speaks in the language of man\" is invoked, meaning that Hashem is beyond any description, and is not composed of parts.</p>\n<p>So, according to these opinions, <em>we cannot say Hashem is someone who loves</em>. Yet, we <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Edot_HaMizrach%2C_Weekday_Arvit%2C_The_Shema.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">say</a> every day \"בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה', אוֹהֵב אֶת־עַמּוֹ יִשְׂרָאֵל\". More examples listed below.</p>\n<p><strong>I would therefore like to ask, how are we able to make certain <em>berachot</em> (blessings) about Hashem that say these things? If it's not really <em>true</em>, then how come these <em>berachot</em> are valid? How are we able to praise Him and say that He is <em>[insert positive description of praise here]</em>?</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some quotes from Moreh Nevuchim Part 1 \"On attributes implying corporeality, emotion, non existence and comparison\", which :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...our sages called them middot... they do <strong>not mean to say that God\nreally possesses middot</strong>, but He performs actions similar to such of\nour actions as originate in certain qualities, I.e. in certain\npsychical dispositions; not that God has really such dispositions...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... whenever any one of His actions is perceived by us, we ascribe to\nGod that emotion which is the force of the act when performed by\nourselves and call Him by an epithet which is formed in the verb\nexpressing that emotion.... such instances do not imply that God is\ninfluenced by a feeling of mercy...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... God is therefore called, because He acts jealous, revengeful...\nthat is to say, He performs acts similar to those which, when\nperformed by us, originate in certain psychical dispositions, in\njealousy, desire for retaliation,... and not the result of an emotion;\nfor He is above all defect!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... the principal object of this chapter was to show that all\nattributes ascribed to God are attributes of His acts, and <strong>do not\nimply that God has <em>any</em> qualities</strong>\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Examples of <em>berachot</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Edot_HaMizrach%2C_Weekday_Shacharit%2C_Pesukei_D%27Zimra.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה', מֶלֶךְ מְהֻלָּל בַּתִּשְׁבָּחוֹת</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...seems ok.

How many words are enough? We can never finish the praises of\nGod, so why be audacious enough to start?!</p>\n<p>But Rabbi Chanina goes further. He says that even the words that we\nare commanded to say, the words of the authorized liturgy, which\ndescribe God as \"the great, the mighty and the awesome\", Rabbi Chanina\nwould not say were it not for the fact that Moses said them, and that\nthe men of the Great Assembly put them into our fixed prayers. And\nthen comes the punchline. To praise God with words, presumably with\nany words, even with the words that Moses spoke in this week's Torah\nreading, to praise God even with the words of the authorised liturgy\nis, in actual fact, insulting to God. To use words in praise of God\nwould be like introducing Paul McCartney as the lead singer of the\nWings, without mentioning that he was in the Beatles! It would be like\npraising a king for all of his silver when he actually posses gold.\nWords are the wrong currency for the praise of God, because no words\ncan do him justice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This would mean the way he explains the Gemora is only because Moshe in Torah Chazal in the Anshei Kneses Hagodalah told us we can use these expressions which are only a small part of Hashem who is beyond our words, can we actually say them.</p>\n<p>Your question in essence falls away, since we can only use the words which Hashem told Moshe to use to describe him to describe him, as this is the only way to understand it. I highly recommend reading works of Sam lebens from his website.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Malachim not to sing Shirah at the Yam Suf, and the verse proving it\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Baal Haturim brings on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.20?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 14:20</a>\nוַיָּבֹ֞א בֵּ֣ין ׀ מַחֲנֵ֣ה מִצְרַ֗יִם וּבֵין֙ מַחֲנֵ֣ה יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וַיְהִ֤י הֶֽעָנָן֙ וְהַחֹ֔שֶׁךְ וַיָּ֖אֶר אֶת־הַלָּ֑יְלָה <strong>וְלֹא־קָרַ֥ב זֶ֛ה אֶל־זֶ֖ה</strong> כׇּל־הַלָּֽיְלָה\na very interesting Midrash from Megillah 10b</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מַאי דִּכְתִיב: ״וְלֹא קָרַב זֶה אֶל זֶה כׇּל הַלָּיְלָה״ — בִּקְּשׁוּ\nמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת לוֹמַר שִׁירָה, אָמַר הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא:\nמַעֲשֵׂה יָדַי טוֹבְעִין בַּיָּם, וְאַתֶּם אוֹמְרִים שִׁירָה</p>\n<p>What is the meaning of that which is written: “And the one came not\nnear the other all the night” (Exodus 14:20)? The ministering angels\nwanted to sing their song, for the angels would sing songs to each\nother, as it states: “And they called out to each other and said”\n(Isaiah 6:3), but the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: The work of My\nhands, the Egyptians, are drowning at sea, and you wish to say songs?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He adds to it a very interesting comparison with the verse Isaiah 6:3\nוְ<strong>קָרָ֨א זֶ֤ה אֶל־זֶה֙</strong> וְאָמַ֔ר קָד֧וֹשׁ קָד֛וֹשׁ קָד֖וֹשׁ\nThat is, the same ones who usually call to one another to sing Shirah, this time were not allowed to approach one another to do it. [The Maharsha makes the same suggestion in Sanhedrin 39b.]</p>\n<p>My problem is, How does this fit with what seems to be the simple reading of the verse: \"Because of the pillar of cloud, the army of Egypt and Israel were kept separate from one another that night?\" It  sounds very unrelated. So a general question: (a) Should Midrashim be assumed to reflect a deeper but <em>still connected</em> aspect of the simple Pshat? [sources?] And a specific question: (b) If so, is there a way to explain that here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There are many deeper ways of understanding this Midrash. This is also quoted in the Gemora in Megilla and sanehdrin. I was asked a very similar to this one yesterday. The question was: Why were the Jews able to sing praises and not the Angels?</p>\n<p>This is the answer I came up with. This part of the Exodus took place before the drowning of the Egyptians. The Angels saw clearly; Hashem had hardened Pharaoh’s heart. There was no turning back for those who came to chase the Jews. The Jews had no choice but to rely on the word of Moshe that G-d told him they should go into the dangerous sea. This would be a big test. They could have surrendered back to the Egyptians. The Malchim did not dream that the Jews would do that. Although it was the night before, they already saw how the plan would unfold, they considered the Egyptians dead already. The Jews would now be the choses nation.</p>\n<p>Hashem, at that point, quieted down the angles and said they were drowning in the sea–they were still alive. (in your eyes) yet I still give man free choice. The Egyptians can avoid drowning by doing repentance. The Jews can surrender. We still do not know the ultimate result.</p>\n<p>Once the Jews were saved from the sea, they made known their trust in Hashem. The Egyptians and drowned and not repented, that is when Hashem allowed singing. Only once man has made his free choice it is not fully decided in the eyes of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Im Building A Library\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>So, I am planning this year to build my very own personal dream library with the best seferim. Money is not an issue, and Im willing to spend over 100k just to get everything that a student would dream to have. Ive only ever been exposed to Artscrolls sets like the various commentaries on the Chumash and also the Talmuds but I am going to learn Hebrew and Aramaic very well so I want to buy the best editions for myself so I am not worried about buying Hebrew editions as these are definently the way to get more knowledge.</p>\n<p>Firstly, list out the best Talmud Bavli and Yerushalami Sets I can get (I dont care if it costs me over 10k just want everything)</p>\n<p>Chumash and if it is possible ( I am not aware bc I only use artscroll) I want a book that has all the commenaries on the Chumash and also if there can be a super commentary book for Rashi and Ramban and other promenent rabbis.</p>\n<p>Also for entire Tanach even if it is on every sefer</p>\n<p>Shulchan Aruch best set out there\nAnd if possible, sefers for prominent commantaries with super commenaries</p>\n<p>Mishnah\nCommantries with super commentaries</p>\n<p>Mishneh Torah best set out there\nCommantries with super commentaries</p>\n<p>Zohar\nI dont know if there is even a proper and exeptable commentary but list those.</p>\n<p>List everything else that is essential and best set for that but these are just some that I really want. Thank you</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Here is my dream list: [Disclaimer: Links are for illustration purposes only. Other stores may have better prices, service, etc.]</p>\n<p>Talmud Bavli: Oz Vehadar set the standard for quality at previously unseen levels; everyone else is playing catch up.</p>\n<p>If you want a translation, most people I know use Artscroll. Other translations are more controversial.</p>\n<p>Chumash: There are too many to count, but you want to start with a Mikraos Gedolos, for a collection of the main commentaries. I personally prefer Torat Chaim from Mosad Harav Kook. You could also get Artscroll or Oz Vehadar.\nFor a Chumash with supercommentaries on Rashi, you definitely want this <a href=\"https://www.shopeichlers.com/products/chumash-oztar-meforshei-rashi-hameoros-hagedolim-7-volume-set/45007?gclid=CjwKCAiAxP2eBhBiEiwA5puhNUmUFa1R-FlQn4ht4O74VNhoKtys2SaTNFWbnqB1KptbqgbD4v64uhoCJR4QAvD_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">set</a>.</p>\n<p>I would also recommend a set of Malbim, because it includes classic Halachic Midrashim in an easy to use format.</p>\n<p>There are several different commentaries on Ramban in English or Hebrew. The Artscroll one is probably a good bet. Or the Chavel edition, in English or Hebrew.</p>\n<p>For Tanach, any new edition of Mikraos Gedolos. You might also enjoy a set of Me'am Loez.</p>\n<p>Other classics on Tanach: Abarbanel, Alshich, and Vilna Gaon.</p>\n<p>There are several great sets of Shulchan Aruch. I recommend trying to look at a few yourself, since being comfortable with the print will make a tremendous difference. You might also want to consider getting one set of Tur and Shulchan Aruch combined.\nSome of the most cutting edge editions are still being put out one volume at a time, so be careful.</p>\n<p>There are again too many important commentaries to list them all. Everyone needs to have a Mishnah Berurah. There are several good editions, but the Dirshu one seems to be taking over.</p>\n<p>You should also get a Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (Artscroll and Metzudah put out translations) and a Chayei Adam. I also recommend Shulchan Aruch Harav and Aruch Hashulchan and Chazon Ish.</p>\n<p>Next you'll want to buy everything by this author, for the best editions of the works listed <a href=\"https://seforimcenter.com/Rabbi-Yechiel-Michel-Dzimitrovsky__c-p-0-0-735.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for in-depth study.</p>\n<p>If you are Sefardi, you should also get Ben Ish Chai, Kaf Hachayim, and Yalkut Yosef.</p>\n<p>The best complete set IMO of Mishnah is Zecher Chanoch. For everyday use, most people probably use Kehati. Artscroll has two editions of Mishnah, one with a light commentary, and one called Yad Avraham. The latter is extremely thorough.</p>\n<p>The best classic set of Rambam is this <a href=\"https://shabsifrankel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">one.</a> But for the best non-classic set, get the <a href=\"https://seforimcenter.com/Mishneh-Torah---RAMBAM-25-vol.---Kapach-Edition-__p-10353.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Qafih edition.</a> More recent classic essays on Rambam are in Ohr Sameach, Chiddushei R' Chaim Halevi, and Chiddushei HaGri\"z. The last two are the seminal works of the Brisker methodology of analysis.</p>\n<p>Zohar: I would get this <a href=\"https://seforimcenter.com/Rabbi-Daniel-Frisch---Matok-MiDvash-1935-2005__c-p-0-0-364.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">set.</a> The author used different fonts to separate the esoteric and non-esoteric parts of the Zohar.</p>\n<p>Commentaries on Talmud Bavli: Ramban, Rashba, Ritva are crucial. Your overall best bet is to just get the Mossad Harav Kook editions. You also want to get Shittah Mekubetzes, Pnei Yehoshua, Chiddushei R' Akiva Eiger, and Chasam Sofer to start. Any new edition should be fine. Certain tractates have their own specific classic commentaries.</p>\n<p>Try to find good sets of Midrash Rabbah and Midrash Tanchuma. Artscroll has a great Midrash Rabbah.</p>\n<p>Get anything written by Rambam, Maharal, Ramchal, and Chafetz Chayim. Especially Derech Hashem. Also Nefesh Hachayim, <a href=\"https://www.shopeichlers.com/products/nefesh-hachaim/29897?gclid=CjwKCAiAxP2eBhBiEiwA5puhNU-LjoQvGZuuNeEcQXYnZMZ8i9d6I_mPy13qrylWgWUAsFvaZga35xoC_WwQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this edition.</a></p>\n<p>Some classic Responsa: Rashba, Rosh, Terumos Hadeshen, Noda Biyehudah, Rabbi Akiva Eiger, Chasam Sofer, Igros Moshe, Yabia Omer.</p>\n\n\n",

Dowid ibn Yihyeh's explanation of the introduction to the Moreh, he presents this section as follows (as found in Dr. Eli Gorfunkel's publication in Qobhes 'Al Yad, vol. 24, pp. 337-338):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zhI1im5n.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zhI1im5n.png\" alt=\"פירוש ר' דוד אבן יחייא להקדמת מורה הנבוכים לרמב\"ם: ענין ב\" /></a></p>\n<p>I will not translate the entire piece, though I present it here for those that can benefit from it directly (apologies to those for whom this remains inaccessible). I will however attempt to address your questions by recourse to and paraphrase of it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>why does the Rambam command us in Hashem's name to not teach anything in Moreh Nevuchim that is his original teaching? Why do we do so?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam is communicating to us here that his exposition ought only be read by a traditional light. That he ought be read as presenting these ideas as fully in consonance with our mesorah, and not in any way a deviation from it. He does not wish to be seen as introducing anything novel here but rather as perpetuating the chain of tradition by means of its explication.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Further on this secretive theme, he implores us in (2) to forget anything we don't understand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is because he does not wish the reader/student to end up erroneously deviating from our tradition. To him, if a person were to take his words and arrive at a conclusion that deviates from tradition, then it is evident that they have misunderstood and misinterpreted him. If such a person attributes to him a view that is in fact alien to our Torah, it would be better for such a person to \"forget\" what they have (mis)learned than to peg and uphold their mistake upon the Rambam's authority (דתליא באשלי רברבי).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(2) Why are we best off not asking kashes? Why is the reason given we might have him backwards?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The nature of the difficulties being raised under purview here are those that attribute to the Rambam views at dissonance with Torah. If one so interprets him they've committed an offense against him on two fronts: interpreting him at variance than his will, and by repaying his beneficence with malice/injury. In his esteem, if one concludes that the meaning of his words contradict our mesorah, then such a person has unquestionably misunderstood him (i.e. understood him backwards).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Especially right after dedicating a lot of ink further up to explaining how nothing doubtful is unexplained and no words are wasted, how can we end up still getting him 100% wrong?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because as R. Yihyeh points out, even despite precision in words, even the words of the Prophets have been distorted, such as is the case with the Christians who misperceive evidence of their false-messiah therein. Even when an author attempts to write in a very precise and deliberate manner, it is still possible for people to misattribute a great many errors to the author.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we are commanded in Hashem's name to not to add any explanation to what he writes, and he implores us to avoid asking kashas (see the rest of this section for additional emphasis on this), why does he say here that if we have a kasha, we should do our best to imagine even a far-fetched explanation on how to understand him and judge him favourably?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bringing this back to the earlier point, he bids us not to explicate his words as being in deviance from the Torah and its traditional transmitters. Accordingly, explicating him in consonance with traditional sources, would not be adding anything - it would simply be understanding him properly (even where internally perceived to be far-fetched). This limud zekhuth (favorably inclined reading of him) is a form of deference owed all, but especially our Hakhamim.</p>\n<p>I hope that this has been somewhat helpful in understanding this section of the Moreh.</p>\n\n\n",

They had a gemara and a few ancient sources like Rabbeinu Chananel, but mostly they needed to work the gemara out by looking at it as a whole and seeing how it could be understood. That's what Tosefos do everywhere; they very rarely quote a mesorah more than a couple of generations back.<br />\nI'd add as a comparison that the Talmud Bavli itself was not so different in its origin, partly. The chachmei hagemara had Mishnah, and some Beraisos, and some mesorah (Rav said this, Shmuel said that.) Starting with that, the amoraim did their best to figure things out, based on their overall understanding. Once in a while, a whole long discussion was disrupted and derailed because Ula or Rav Dimi or Ravin came with the mesorah from Eretz Yisrael and R' Yochanan, which would overrule. You can watch it happen; you can see which parts were mesorah, which were amoraim trying to figure it out.<br />\nSee the discussion and my question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/127349/jumping-elephants\">here</a>, which focuses on Tosefos: judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/127349/jumping-elephants</p>\n\n\n",

What is the minimum amount of Torah one would have to know to not be considered an am haaretz? Who would this apply to if they didn't know this? For example children would likely not be called this since they are still learning? My assumption then is the term applies after a certain age; is this correct? What if even after a certain age that person is actively engaging in learning Torah to make up for not knowing before? Would they still have this title and if so what is the minimum amount they must know to lose this title?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Sotah 22a says one who learnt Chumash without Mishna is a Boor (lower than an am haaretz). One who didn't even learn Chumash is worse. The Mishnah Brurah 199 Bais says a \"complete\" am haaretz does not even know Chumash and Mishnah.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in Brachos 47b (as well as in Sotah 22a) brings Achairim who says one who learnt Chumash and Mishna but did not [Rashi] learn Gemara is an am haaretz.\nThe Beniyahu (Ben Ish Chai) there asks: someone who learnt Chumash and Mishnayos but did not get up to learning Gemara yet is an am haaretz?\nHe answers that the Gemara meant that he does not want to learn Gemara, he says Mishna is enough for him. But someone who just didn't get up to learning Gemara is Kosher and proper.</p>\n<p>The Beniyahu then explains the next gemara according to this answer but as for what concerns this, he says, the Amorah thought that if at the other Amoras age he did not learn Gemara yet, it must be the reason was because he did not want to learn.</p>\n<p>I feel that this seems to answer most of your questions.\nChildren are not am haaratzim because they are not up to Gemara.\nOne should at least know Chumash and Mishnayos (I don't know if it means all, most or some)\nIt would seem from the last story that based on your age you need to know the amount of Gemara expected of someone at that stage/age.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A slightly different answer based on my learning and understanding. Don't let the fact that I am a Rabbi lend any authority to this answer, it has just as much chance of being wrong as any other answer based on reasoning and experience.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in Brachos 47b (as well as in Sotah 22a) brings Acherim who says one who learnt Chumash and Mishna but did not serve Torah scholars is an am haaretz.</p>\n<p>Another Gemara in Pesachim 49b describes an am haaretz as someone who is only out to satisfy his own need, in a context where serving another is the actual mitzva.</p>\n<p>So combining these two ideas, as well as ideas from mussar and chassidus, I would posit that an am ha'aretz is not necessarily someone who hasn't learned a certain quantity of Torah, but someone who has failed to absorb a particular lesson in Torah.</p>\n<p>What is that lesson?</p>\n<p>The lesson is that serving others is good. The yeitzer hara and even the nefesh bahamis are naturally geared towards self-service as the ideal, whether it be because of the seduction of pleasure therein, or the simple logic of \"I must look out for myself and survive\".</p>\n<p>Torah teaches us that there is another side of life, and that is serving others. It is a greater good. There's a pleasure in it that is far greater, as well as the fact that it is a Godly, super rational endeavour that emulates Hashem. Much more to be said.</p>\n<p>An am ha'aretz is someone who hasn't figured out that latter lesson, despite a lot of Chumash and Mishna knowledge. A little bit of serving Torah scholars [and perhaps one's spouse], or Gemara learning [Rashi] in addition to this seems to be the required method to lead out of being an am ha'aretz, as insodoing one will come to actually experience tangibly the concept of serving others l'tov, and the prior learning of the Chumash and Mishna about the importance of this will actually penetrate the heart.</p>\n<p>How much learning is required to bring all this together for a person will vary from person to person, and I defer to Lanied Sofey's answer for that.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore he has to erect markers for himself, so he doesn't stumble and err in them God forbid, since he has already erred in them, for they are utterly errant and confused ways.

Why not begin with describing the purification process of B'nei Yisrael, in order that they are able to receive G-ds Torah, which is the central subject of this weeks parashah.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Lau explains (my own understanding of this piece) that the lesson G-d wants us to learn from this pesukim is that Yisro, a kohen from Midian, who <em>was</em> a worshipper of foreign gods, accepted G-ds sovereignty and accepted that G-d is the true One. Rabbi Lau seems to cite Rashi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.18.5?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(v. 5)</a> who explains that Yisro had everything he wanted, but nevertheless, he left his place, and went into the desert, to search for G-d. This ended up with the Torah teaching us that Yisro accepted G-d as the True One G-d <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.18.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(see posuk 11)</a>.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Lau goes further to explain that it was a form of \"dedication of the soul\" that made Yisro accept G-d's soverignty and made Yisro wanted to draw closer to G-d.</p>\n<p>So, can one say that the reason the Torah saw need to start off with this \"story\" is to give mankind the message that if you feel attracted to G-dliness and you are really wanting to connect to G-d that is possible, despite what you've did in the past? Despite of \"being the kohen of the Midianites\", you are able to return to G-d.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The lesson from Jethro is that he tried all other religions before concluding Judaism was the only true one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jethro said: I have not neglected to worship any idol in this world, but I have found no god like the God of Israel. [Midrash Tanḥuma, Yitro 7]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, there is a dark side to this story.  Jethro wanted a grandson to do as he did: Worship all existing idols and conclude only God was real.  This would give him a better appreciation of monotheism. [Mayan Bet Hashoeva on Yitro 18, 4] The Mekhilta tells us that Moses agreed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Moses said to Jethro, “Give me your daughter Tzipporah as a wife”, Jethro answered, “If you do what I ask of you, I will give her to you as a wife.”\nMoses said: “What do you ask?”\nJethro replied: “Your first son must serve idolatry. The following sons may serve God in heaven.”\nMoses accepted.\nJethro said: “Swear.”\nAnd Moses swore.

[To wit,] we were not commanded to sacrifice in every place, and in every time, or to build a Temple in every place, or to allow anybody to become a priest and sacrifice.  Only one Temple has been appointed, and only, [as the Torah says,] “in the place which the Lord shall choose” [Deut. 12:26].  In no other place are we allowed to sacrifice.  [The Torah says:]\nBe careful not to give your burnt-offerings in every place that you see. [Deut. 12:13];\nand only the members of a particular family were allowed to officiate as priests. All these restrictions served to limit this kind of worship.  But prayer and supplication can be offered everywhere and by every person.

Therefore, the idea that the Torah precedes creation should not be accepted as is (but we can \"tweak\" it; as the Gemara itself wrote that the Torah was \"Black Fire on White Fire\"...). This is clear in the well-known Rambam's view on sacrifices. He also held similar views on other prohibitions that, in his opinion, were prohibited because they were forms of Avoda Zara. As I recall, Rav Slifkin wrote somewhere, perhaps in a blog post about Lulav, that it's normal for us not to understand some mitzvot. Indeed, if a mitzvah aims to fix the world at a specific point, then once it's accomplished, it loses its \"sense\" for people.</p>\n<p>In a more \"mystical\" point of view, mitzvot are doing something metaphysical in other worlds beyond our own. Even then, we can hold that some things change (and this was the point of view of Shabbetai Tzvi...), but it is harder to affirm. And then, it is easier to \"feel\" a sense in the mitzvot.</p>\n<p>Obviously, it's not as simple as that, and even Rabanim seen as \"kabbalists\" won't say that everything is mystical, etc. But I think it's an interesting way to approach this subject.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Gemara (Sanhedrin 71a) says regarding the Mitzvah of Ben Sorer Umoreh, that it would never happen that the parents would choose to have their son killed in such a situation, rather it was given solely for the purpose of studying and receiving reward</p>\n<p>Regarding the Mitzvah of Yibum, the Mishnah (Bechoros 1:7) says as follows:</p>\n<p>מִצְוַת יִבּוּם קוֹדֶמֶת לְמִצְוַת חֲלִיצָה,\nבָּרִאשׁוֹנָה, שֶׁהָיוּ מִתְכַּוְּנִין לְשֵׁם מִצְוָה. וְעַכְשָׁיו שֶׁאֵין מִתְכַּוְּנִין לְשֵׁם מִצְוָה, אָמְרוּ מִצְוַת חֲלִיצָה קוֹדֶמֶת לְמִצְוַת יִבּוּם</p>\n<p>The mitzva of levirate marriage takes precedence over the mitzva of ḥalitza, which dissolves the levirate bond, as it is stated: “And if the man does not wish to take his brother’s wife” (Deuteronomy 25:7). The mishna adds: This was the case initially, when people would intend that their performance of levirate marriage be for the sake of the mitzva. But now that they do not intend that their performance of levirate marriage be for the sake of the mitzva, but rather for reasons such as the beauty of the yevama or for financial gain, the Sages said that the mitzva of ḥalitza takes precedence over the mitzva of levirate marriage</p>\n<p>There is also the general concept of “the Torah wasn’t given to  angels” (Berachos 25b; Kiddushin 54a)</p>\n<p>The Gemara (Nazir 23a) regarding a Mitzvah - like eating the meat of a Korban - that is not done for its sake, but rather for one’s own benefit,  quotes the verse:  “For the ways of the Lord are right, and the just walk in them; but transgressors stumble over them” (Hosea 14:10)</p>\n<p>So it would seem that there are certain Mitzvos that indeed in order for them to have the desirable affect (not the opposite, heaven forbid), must be done with the right intentions</p>\n\n\n",

Rema: If there was actual milk in the pan, then we require sixty times its volume in the meat. All of this is when the pan is open, and the steam rises up from the food itself, to the pan that is above it, and also if the two are so close to each other that the steam that rises is so how that it would make your hand retreat rapidly. If not, then everything is permissible. Therefore, we hang meat (slabs) over dairy pots, and we don't worry about the steam that rises. <strong>And if something is covered, then everything is permissible, since it is like two pots that touch each other, which do not make each other forbidden, and all the more so with mere steam. But ideally (lechatchila) one should be strict on all this.</strong> (emphasis mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rosh in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_HaRosh.20.26.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvos HaRosh</a> maintains that steams that comes from something unkosher, remains unkosher.

However, our ovens, which are generally large and ventilated, do not produce such steam and therefore the zei'a should not pose a problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although the Aruch HaShulchan sees no problems with modern-day ovens, Rav Moshe Feinstein clearly does. His view is (Igrot Moshe YD 1:40):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>he insists that one should not use the same oven for UNCOVERED dairy and meat foods.  If one chooses to cook meat uncovered in the oven, then dairy food must be cooked COVERED in the oven, and vice versa.  The cover prevents the food from emitting steam, which prevents the extraction of taste from the oven walls and its subsequent return to the food.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Given the fact that the whole family is together / hosting other people at the meal, it represents a good opportunity to enjoy \"שיחות משותפות\" – “mutual conversation”.<sup>1</sup> A time to give attention to everyone and engage in reciprocal dialogue.</p>\n<p>I have found the following approaches help:</p>\n<p><strong>1) Ask a question / moral dilemma to the table</strong></p>\n<p>A good tactic is to ask an opening question that provides room for interaction and an ensuing table discussion. As the viewpoints are increasingly shared everyone becomes more invested in the dialogue and wants to see what the conclusion is. Halachic dilemmas posed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchok_Zilberstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Zilberstein shlita</a> in his series of books for example, make for a fascinating table discussion.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p><strong>2) Tell a story</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone loves a good story. Not only do they often keep people engaged, they serve as a wonderful form of mussar or chizuk.</p>\n<p>This too is a wonderful tool for chinuch. The Slonimer Rebbe in his Nesivei Chinuch, Chapt 7, p.52 relates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עלינו להשתמש גם בסיפורי צדיקים מילדותם, ובמיוחד בש\"ק בעת הסעודה, שעי\"ז תתפתח השאיפה בלב ובנפש הבנים לילך ג\"כ ברוח זו, וירגישו כי שקר החן והבל היופי של מצות אנשים מלומדה והחכמות אשר בחוץ תרונה, וישאפו לנקודת אמת ותתעורר בהם אש קודש</p>\n<p>We should specifically relate stories about tzaddikim in their youth at the Shabbos meal. In so doing, it cultivates an aspiration in both the heart and soul of our children to try to replicate their actions. They will also feel that there is a sense of falsehood and shallowness in mitzvah observance that one gleans from an external commitment and it will inspire in them the point of truth and awaken in them a holy fire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>3) Quizzes</strong></p>\n<p>Providing the tone remains light-hearted and each question is age-appropriate, these question-answer sessions can become a real highlight of the meal. Obviously it should not be a pressure, but a fun way to engage in Torah during the meal.It does not necessarily need to be parsha-based trivia but even yedios klalis (Jewish general knowledge), it can become a very informative and entertaining part of the meal. One should definitely ensure that a number of questions will warrant correct answers as that breeds confidence and makes the experience more enjoyable.</p>\n<p><strong>4) A thought based off a nicely sung zemer</strong></p>\n<p>The custom of singing zemiros is something that is praised in the Gemara<sup>3</sup>, and is regarded as a clear expression of love for Hashem. As such, zemiros are a chance to collectively sing together enjoying all sorts of familiar tunes. It is a nice way to break up the meal so that the mealtime scenario does not become too monotonous and instead further enhances the Shabbos meal. I have found that sometime a nicely sung zemer can be used as a good segue into bringing out an idea as those who enjoy singing feel a connection to the song and are resultantly more attentive.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> A term borrowed from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoel_Schwartz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yoel Schwartz</a> in his sefer on Chinuch - <em>Beis Abbah</em>, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47101&st=&pgnum=92&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p.93</a> (last paragraph on the page).</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> See either his והערב נא series of halachic challenges and solutions based on the weekly parsha (<a href=\"https://www.greenfieldjudaica.com/v-harev-na-S895135.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol.1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.greenfieldjudaica.com/v-harev-na-volume-two-S922398.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol.2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.greenfieldjudaica.com/v-harev-na-volume-3-395191.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol.3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.greenfieldjudaica.com/v-harev-na-volume-4-798275.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol. 4</a>) and their English translation by Feldheim (<a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/veha-arev-na\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol.1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/veha-rev-na-vol-2-english-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol.2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/veha-arev-na-volume-3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol.3</a>), as well as the <em>What If</em> set produced by Artscroll based off his חשוקי חמד series (<a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422613160.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol.1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422615348.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol.2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422617533.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol.3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422622445.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol.4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422629741.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vol.5</a>).

It is <strong>not</strong> a blanket statement against <strong>all</strong> secular ideology or all views, more to do with when people specifically become possessed <em>beyond the norm</em>, in a way that brings them away from Torah views of Divine Providence, trust in Hashem, ahavat Yisrael (and isolating them from friends and family) and other mitzvot like don lechaf zechut, and can apply to both secular and \"frum\" people alike.</p>\n<p>Please vote to close if you feel this is off topic, I can hear such an argument. I don't want to be controversial. It has been my experience though and I would love advice, especially advice that doesn't require one to be judgemental, or not kind. Halachic advice is the priority.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time, the advice would be to stay away, and some people are still lucky enough that they are able to stay away without much effort (although simply staying away can be considered a cop-out, we are all responsible for each other).</p>\n<p>Yet nowadays it's become very prevalent that many people buy into secular ideologies in quite an extreme, often combative/isolating way, e.g. vehement adherents of political ideologies - barely a month goes by that we don't find out one of our friends strongly believes and advocates for something extreme, including what appear to be conspiracy theories, and ideologies that are not provable but taken as fact.</p>\n<p>Given that this seems to be happening a lot nowadays, what advice do people have for dealing with it? When at someone's house and one feels they are locked into a dangerous ideology, how do we talk to them? Do we smile and nod and avoid stirring the waters? Do we try to engage?</p>\n<p>Main question: <strong>How do we deal with this while maintaining ahavat yisrael in heart and deed, being don lechaf zechut, and having kavod habriut and derech eretz?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I've dealt with a person like that in the past (who believed conspiracies to the point that it was denying Hashem's dominion of the world, chas veshalom), and I tried to approach it not through convincing them they were wrong, because a) they probably wouldn't listen and b) I didn't have hours to convince them, but instead through laying out the groundwork of why I believe they are wrong.\nLike, I didn't say \"I don't think that the shadowy elites that control the world released covid to inject us with vaccines with micro-antennas that can communicate with the new 5G network\". Instead, I talked about how in the end everything that happens in the world is because Hashem wants it to happen, so I don't really care about the whys - I know that Hashem wanted there to be covid, Hashem wanted there to be a vaccine, and if Hashem didn't want either one, they would disappear immediately.\nThe strategy was basically to change the lens they were viewing things through from a lens that didn't involve Hashem, to a lens that realized Hashem is the creator of the world, EVERYTHING that happens is because he wants it, and he is the only one with the power - everyone else is merely pawns in his hands.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't think this question is Torah related, but more; how do I get someone to agree with my beliefs if I think their beliefs are extreme?

Rashi explains in his commentary on Proverbs that this is not the case with other sins, which are not as difficult to depart from. And regarding the phrase, 'And if they return, they will not reach [Him],' Rashi explains that this is a decree from the King. However, <strong>it can be interpreted as an act of divine mercy</strong>, since the individual has genuinely returned with a whole heart, as the verse continues, 'Lest he [later return to idolatry] and depart [from God], God forbid, if he does not die, for it is close for a person to be drawn after heresy and to return to his previous ways, God forbid.' And from this reason, one can also conclude that in a sin one indulges in feverently, it is similar to heresy, in that it is also easy for the individual to return to his previous ways.\"</em></p>\n<p>In other words, God takes the person so that they do not have a chance to return to their sin, which it is highly likely they could return to with idol worship and sins they are accustomed to (God forbid). God does this so they die righteous.</p>\n<p>It is possible that if the reason Hashem causes them to die is so they won't return to their misdeeds, perhaps if Hashem sees that they are steadfast and reasonably strong as far as not going back, he allows them to live longer before taking them out of the world.</p>\n<p>You could also follow the idea that while Yitro did acknowledge God as the greatest of gods, perhaps it is possible he did not renounce other gods' existence, in which case the logic in Avodah Zarah 17a would lead us to believe, that he would not be killed (if his teshuva is not full). (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.269.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shemoni 269</a> seems to state that at the time that Yitro said \"Hashem  is greater than all gods,\" he did not deny the existence of other gods, only recognized Hashem as the most powerful, and through his belief in other gods, continued to be guilty of idol worship. That being said, he certainly could have grown later and renounced belief in other gods, and converted as many commentators indicate).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>It is not known how much longer Yisro lived after abandoning idolatry.</p>\n<p>It is not clear that Yisro did abandon idolatry.</p>\n<p>It is not clear that the premise your link brings that ex heretics will die of regret is meant to be an absolute.</p>\n\n\n",

I've read an interpretation of Rabbi Oizer Alport in Bein Gavra L'Gavra that this can be connected to the Targum cited above.

This concept can also be found in the commentary of the Tiferes Shlomo on Shemos 18:1.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And this is why the Ten Commandments begin with \"I am the L-rd your\nG-d who took you out of Egypt\" and not \"I am the L-rd your G-d who\ncreated the world\" <strong>because this is the fundamental principle of\nreceiving the Torah; the yichud of Anochi, to subdue all of the kelipa\nthat causes pain to the Jewish people and return it all to good.</strong> (emphasis mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tiferes Shlomo writes that it is a fundamental principle of one who receives the Torah, that he is to subdue all of the kelipos and to transform it into good. This is exactly what Yisro did. He once was a pagan-priest, but subdued the kelipos and literally transformed all darkness and negativity into holiness.</p>\n<p>In this vein, we can apply the statement of a Midrash Rabbah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.1.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Vayikra Rabbah 1:2)</a> where Rabbi Abahu says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Those who dwelt in its shade shall return…” <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.14.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Hoshea 14:8)</a> This refers to the converts who come and take shelter in the shade of the Holy One. “…they shall revive [like] corn…” (ibid.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to most of the opinions mentioned above, the achievement Yisro achieved was that he was able as a -once a high priest in Midian - now a convert, to transform darkness into light, holiness. Isn't that the soul purpose of our Holy Torah? To subdue the evil and transform it into the G-dly? To connect to G-d and to abandon everything that is not His?</p>\n<p>Please feel free to add anything in or to come up with your own idea's.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Resources on learning blessings on food\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I would love to start saying brachos (blessings) before and after food. What resources would you recommend for learning the blessings, and for knowing which ones to select in what order? (Yes, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9146/why-is-it-necessary-to-ask-a-rabbi\">“ask your Rabbi,”</a> I know, but what additional resources do you like?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>If you are looking for an English guide to the laws of berachot, I would recommend the <a href=\"https://www.lehmanns.co.uk/yalkut-yosef-volumes-4-5-6-berakhot-3-volumes.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Yalkut Yosef</em> Saka Edition Volumes 4-6</a> (especially for Sephardim). I would also recommend the Feldheim <em><a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/halachos-of-brochos\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachos of Brochos</a></em> (especially for Ashkenazim).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The laws are extensive. The below is a quick guide of many of the main facts one should keep in their head in the laws of berachot, as well as a short introduction to other main areas of laws one should be aware exist, and will help them when they learn the laws from the books and their rabbi.</p>\n<p>It is important to speak to one's rabbi for learning how to make berachot, as soon as possible — for help with important custom-specific pronunciation, and guidance on which other particulars one should follow according to one's custom, and going through the laws, and for <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9146/why-is-it-necessary-to-ask-a-rabbi\">other reasons</a>. <strong>Don't use this guide without also consulting your rabbi.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Basic Guide to Brachot (for food and drink*)</h1>\n<p>Basic rules about which berachot apply to which foods/drinks are listed, but they should not be relied on. As one starts, it's important to keep consulting one of the comprehensive berachot lists (such as the OU Guide in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/133185/31534\">Shmuel's answer</a>), which list most foods/drinks for most things. One will get to learn them (although we all will rely on lists from time to time). Picking a list is best done with one's rabbi as they will find the right list applicable to one's custom.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Before-Berachot (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/90551/jewish/Texts-of-Blessings-Before-Eating.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Link to generic texts, translations and transliterations</a>)</h2>\n<p>There are six main before-berachot to know. They are said in order when multiple apply to one meal, and therefore listed in that order. Some exceptions noted. The procedure which must be followed is to say the beracha with concentration, and then immediately, without doing anything in between, eat/drink even a small amount of the applicable food/drink (including swallowing it), and then when ready move on to the next beracha, and repeat. Each <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/90551/jewish/Texts-of-Blessings-Before-Eating.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">before-beracha</a> begins the standard way בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְ‑יָ אֱ‑לֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם - <em>Baruch Atah Ado-nai Elo-heinu Melech Ha'Olam...</em>.</p>\n<h3>הַמּוֹצִיא לֶחֶם מִן הָאָרֶץ - <em>HaMotzi Lechem Min Ha'Aretz</em></h3>\n<p><strong>Said on</strong>: Bread<sup>1</sup> (and, uniquely among the before-berachot, covers everything else in the meal, except wine/grape juice, dessert, and other minor variations<sup>2</sup>). Is said first, and therefore other berachot should not be said (exceptions listed in footnotes).<br />\n<strong>After beracha</strong>: <em>Birchat HaMazon (bentching)</em>, which covers everything else eaten/drank at the meal.</p>\n<p><sup>1 - There are many breads that <em>HaMotzi</em> is not said on. Kosher bread will always list whether it is <em>HaMotzi</em>, <em>Mezonot</em> or <em>Shehakol</em>. Some Sephardim will say <em>HaMotzi</em> on something that counts as <em>Mezonit</em> (see below), if they are eating a certain amount, and many will say it on <em>Mezonot</em> foods if they are sitting down to eat them formally. CYLOR.</sup><br />\n<sup>2 - There are different customs about what counts as dessert, and there are some other customs about fruit and nuts etc; one should learn these with one's rabbi.</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>בּוֹרֵא מִינֵי מְזוֹנוֹת - <em>Boreh Mineh Mezonot/Borei Minei Mezonos</em></h3>\n<p><strong>Said on</strong>: Specific, generally grain-based items not covered by <em>HaMotzi</em>, and some other basic sustenance items like rice.<sup>1</sup><br />\n<strong>After beracha</strong>: <em>Al HaMichiya</em>, minor exceptions like rice would be <em>Boreh Nefashot/Borei Nefashos</em></p>\n<p>NOTE: There are important rules to learn, which are specific to one's own customs (ask a rabbi), about when to say <em>HaMotzi</em> and/or <em>Birchat HaMazon</em>, instead of the above, such as when sitting down for a meal, or eating a certain large amount.</p>\n<p><sup>1 - Many kosher products will say on the packet if they are <em>HaMotzi</em>, <em>Mezonot</em>, or <em>Shehakol</em>. One should be familiar with the general rules for how this works, such as when fruit juice is used instead of water etc.</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן/הַגֶּפֶן - <em>Boreh Peri HaGefen/Borei P'ri HaGafen</em></h3>\n<p><strong>Said on</strong>: Wine and proper grape juice.<br />\n<strong>After beracha</strong>: <em>Al HaGefen</em></p>\n<p>NOTE: This is sometimes said before <em>HaMotzi</em>, such as on Shabbat and Yom Tov, when it is used to make <em>Kiddush</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָעֵץ - <em>Boreh Peri Ha'Etz/Borei P'ri Ha'Eitz</em></h3>\n<p><strong>Said on</strong>: Fruits<sup>1,2</sup>.<br />\n<strong>After beracha</strong>: <em>Boreh Nefashot/Borei Nefashos</em> or <em>Al Ha'Etz/Al Ha'Eitz</em> (see below)</p>\n<h5>When to say <em>Al Ha'Etz/Al Ha'Eitz</em></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Upon having eaten the requisite amount (See below, in the <strong>Amounts</strong> section) of one or more of the following 5 fruits from Israel: grapes, figs, dates, olives and/or pomegranates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>When to say <em>Boreh Nefashot/Borei Nefashos</em></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>All other fruit</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה - <em>Boreh Peri Ha'Adamah/Borei P'ri Ha'Adamah</em></h3>\n<p><strong>Said on</strong>: Vegetables<sup>1,2</sup>.<br />\n<strong>After beracha</strong>: <em>Boreh Nefashot/Borei Nefashos</em></p>\n<p><sup>1 - One should look up and try to learn every item on the list of fruits and vegetables, as common sense can't be relied on (banana is not counted as a fruit, some berries and nuts are etc.), and it is very custom specific so ask your rabbi</sup><br />\n<sup>2 - If they are processed in certain ways, the bracha might be <em>Shehakol</em>. Consult the packet (many kosher products list the beracha under the kosher symbol), guides, and/or one's rabbi to know the general rules, and individual cases.</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<h3>שֶׁהַכֹּל נִהְיָה בִּדְבָרוֹ - <em>SheHakol Nihiya/Nihiyeh Bidvaro</em></h3>\n<p><strong>Said on</strong>: Everything else.<br />\n<strong>After beracha</strong>: <em>Boreh Nefashot/Borei Nefashos</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>After Berachot (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/133185/31534\">Shmuel's answer</a> for links to generic texts, translations and transliterations)</h2>\n<p>There are 3 main after-berachot (with 2 variations) to know for most situations. Apart from the first, <em>bentching</em>, which covers everything eaten/drank, one might combine the others if multiple are needed to cover everything (although each after-beracha can only be made once, covering everything that is applicable to it). One generally has a time limit after eating to say them, generally 30–72 minutes (ask your rabbi).</p>\n<h3><em>Birchat HaMazon (Bentching)</em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A long, sit-down beracha, said after eating a requisite amount of bread (and a few other exceptions), composed of four main berachot and many additional supplications.</li>\n<li>Additional supplications are added in various situations like when there are more than 3 men, when it is a Yom Tov or Shabbat, or at various <em>simchas</em>. There are a lot of additional customs to become familiar with.</li>\n<li>One should say it where one ate, and laws about leaving the place, changing place, and many others are explained in the halachic works that one should learn.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><em>Me'En Shalosh (Al HaMichiya, Al HaGefen, Al HaEitz)</em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A single beracha covering the seven fruits/grains of Israel (wheat, barley, grapes, figs, olives, dates and pomegranates), as well as wine and <em>mezonot/mezonos</em> foods.</li>\n<li>The text will explain how to combine the words when multiple of the above have been eaten/drank. In all these cases, only one beracha is said, but the extra parts are included within it. There are also variations for Shabbat, Yom Tov etc. listed.</li>\n<li>The laws of location are similar to <em>bentching</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><em>Boreh Nefashot/Borei Nefashos</em></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A short beracha for everything else.</li>\n<li>One can generally change location. Ask your rabbi and learn the laws.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Other Points</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>עַל נְטִילַת יָדָֽיִם - <em>Netilat Yadayim/Netilas Yadayim</em></strong> - There are laws about washing with a cup before bread, including how much bread one plans to eat, and whether to say the beracha for <em>netilat yadayim</em> (which one will do in most cases), and not talking between saying it etc. that everyone should know.</li>\n<li><strong>Tofel and Ikar</strong> - There is an important set of laws on <em>tofel and ikar</em>, that one should be familiar with. It is about deciding if one food is in some way subservient to another, and therefore only one beracha is made - on the main food (<em>ikar</em>), not the subservient (<em>tofel</em>). One normally wouldn't say a beracha on ketchup, if it's being eaten with chips/fries, for example.</li>\n<li><strong>What is covered</strong> - For <em>HaMotzi</em> and <em>Mezonot/Mezonos</em>, they cover more items, such as items not in the room, or not on one's mind etc. For the others, it might not do so. A few rules here, custom specific (such as variation between at one's own home and as a guest in someone else's home), to become familiar with.</li>\n<li><strong>The procedure is important</strong> - There are laws about what to do and not do before, during and immediately after the beracha, including laws of cleanliness, concentration on the meaning, holding the food with one's right hand, and not doing anything between the beracha, and eating/drinking without delay within a few seconds.</li>\n<li><strong>Amounts</strong> - There are laws on amounts, e.g. one makes a before-beracha on any amount (with some exceptions), but an after-beracha on (usually) at least a volume known as a <em>kezayit</em> for food (approximately 33g for Sephardim, more complicated for Ashkenazim) and the majority of a <em>revi'it</em> for drink (approximately 75-81cc) in a certain time frame (e.g. according to some, 9 minutes for food, a single or couple of quick gulps for drink), that one should know. One's rabbi will guide them how to measure and estimate these. They are custom specific.</li>\n<li><strong>When not to say</strong> - one generally doesn't say it on things unless they count as <em>bona fide</em> foods, so not on medicines for example (some customs would say it on certain medicines, CLYOR), nor when one is not eating in a normal way, nor when eating something one finds repulsive. One is also not allowed to say it in an unclean or immodest place, nor when one is not dressed. See also: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/33394/tasting-food-whilst-cooking?rq=1\">Tasting food whilst cooking</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Mistakes</strong> - There are laws about what to do when one said the wrong beracha (some cover others after the fact, like <em>Boreh Peri Ha'Adamah</em> will cover fruit in these cases, <em>SheHakol</em> covers most things etc.) or forgot to say it, or took too long to eat. When to say it again, when not etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Hashem's Name</strong> - It is important to know how serious it is to say Hashem's name - even though we never pronounce it the way it is written, and instead say \"Ado-nai\" (\"Elo-heinu\" is similarly serious) -  as well as how serious it is to not say a beracha when one is obligated to, and therefore making berachot properly is very important. There are also laws on this, such as what to do in doubt, what to do if one said Hashem's name in a mistaken beracha etc. In many cases, a partial remedy for the mistake is to say \"<em>baruch shem kevod malchuto le'olam va'ed</em>\".</li>\n<li><strong>Pronunciation</strong> - Very important also is pronunciation, and this is custom specific, so relying on the transliterations given are not ideal. One's rabbi will help with that, and will offer advice about concentration and language barrier issues, if applicable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is even more than this - including laws on saying Amen. Just click on the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/blessing\">Blessing</a> tag and see the variety of questions. There's plenty to learn. But the most important laws are quickly mastered, so it's not as daunting as it seems. The rewards are worthwhile!</p>\n<p>* These berachot for deriving physical enjoyment from the world are not just limited to food and drink, e.g. there are other berachot for fragrances, witnessing wonderous natural phenomena (like mountains, comets etc), witnessing great people like royalty, and much more.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Hi Sarah and welcome to Mi Yodeya.

For example, one should make the Shehakol on orange juice before HaEtz on an orange, since once an HaEtz was made on the orange, some say that the juice was covered, and one wouldn’t be able to make another Bracha.

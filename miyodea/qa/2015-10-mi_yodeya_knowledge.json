    "content": "# What does Exodus 21:28 mean if an Oral Torah was given at Sinai?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the claims Rabbinic Judaism makes is that Oral Torah contains instructions for how to \"properly slaughter\" animals. The laws of <em>shechitah</em> are not in the Written Torah, yet one of the proofs for its existence is given from Deuteronomy 12:20-21, which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the Lord your God has enlarged your territory as he promised you,\n  and you crave meat and say, “I would like some meat,” then you may eat\n  as much of it as you want.\n  If the place where the LORD your God chooses to put his Name is too\n  far away from you, you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks\n  the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you, and in your own towns\n  you may eat as much of them as you want.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is, in fact, only one of the proof texts that argues for the existence of an Oral Torah.</p>\n\n<p>And yet we read in Exodus 21:28 the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a bull gores a man or woman to death, the bull is to be stoned to\n  death, and its meat must not be eaten. But the owner of the bull will\n  not be held responsible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Keeping in mind the well-known Rabbinic principle that Torah doesn't repeat itself needlessly, what is the point of God telling the Israelites that the meat of the stoned bull is not to be eaten?</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, later in the same chapter it is told that a dead ox will belong to the owner of a pit it has fallen into, or to the owner of a troublesome ox which gored it. What is the point of having a dead ox if one cannot eat it? Is one simply to dispose of the dead ox?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Talmud addresses this issue in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=21&daf=41&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 41a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ת\"ר ממשמע שנאמר (שמות כא, כח) סקל יסקל השור איני יודע שנבילה היא ונבילה אסורה באכילה מה ת\"ל לא יאכל את בשרו מגיד לך הכתוב שאם שחטו לאחר שנגמר דינו אסור באכילה</p>\n<p>From the fact that it says \"the bull shall be stoned\" do I not know that it is <em>neveilah</em> (unslaughtered), and <em>neveilah</em> is forbidden to eat?  So what does \"do not eat its flesh\" teach?  The verse tells us that if he slaughters it after it has been ruled upon [as needing to be stoned], it is still forbidden to eat it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The verse about who owns the dead ox is the subject of a discussion in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=21&daf=10b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Kama 10b</a> which has ramifications as to how to assess the payment owed (i.e. the victim keeps the carcass and its value is deducted from the amount that must be reimbursed), and who will be responsible for the inconvenience of removing the carcass from the pit (in order to be able to sell it) and the effort of selling it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>While the talmudic passage quoted above is certainly relevant in this case, I don't think that it is necessary to even resort to such a source in this case. According to it's own interpretive methodology, the question was flawed from the beginning. </p>\n\n<p>The question was why the <em>pasuq</em> in <em>Shemoth</em> 21:28 needed to state \"<em>wa-lo ye'okhel eth besaro</em> - and its meat shall not be eaten\" when it was already stated in <em>Devarim</em> 12:21 that meat may be eaten when it is slaughtered \"<em>ka-asher ssiwithikha</em> - as I have commanded you.\" So, either there is a contradiction between the two <em>pasuqim</em> (with one implying a prescribed manner of slaughter and the other indicated that it there is no such prescription) or the implication of \"<em>ka-asher ssiwithikha</em>\" is only that the animal should be killed, or perhaps just killed in a certain place, and not eaten while alive. Thus assumes the questioner. However, not enough attention was paid to the language of <em>Shemoth</em> 21:28, nor was the entirety of the Torah considered before jumping to a [mistaken] conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>Notice how the language of the <em>pasuq</em> is <em>wa-lo ye'okhel</em> (\"<strong><em>it</em></strong> shall not be eaten\") rather than the usual <em>wa-lo thokhal</em> or <em>wa-lo thokhelu</em> (\"and <strong><em>you</em></strong> shall not eat [it]\"). This is because the <em>pasuq</em> which deals with the <em>shor nisqal</em> is not directing the prohibition of eating toward Jews. Instead, it is directing Jews not to either give it to a non-Jewish resident alien (i.e. a <em>ger toshav</em>) or sell it to a <em>nokhri</em> (a non-Jew passing through the nation, but not a resident of it). Thus, it says [to Jews] that the meat of the ox \"shall not be eaten\" (i.e. by others who are not Jewish).</p>\n\n<p>How do we know this? Because of the explicit statement of <em>Devarim</em> 14:21, which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Lo thokhelu khol nevelah la-ger asher bish`arekha titenenah wa-akhalah o makhor la-nokhri ki 'am qadhosh la-Shem Elohekha</em>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Translation</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>\"And you [Jews] should not eat any <em>nevelah</em> (i.e. that which is improperly slaughtered or dies of itself). You shall give such [meat] to the <em>ger</em> (i.e. resident non-Jew) who is within your gates, or you may sell it to a <em>nokhri</em> (i.e. a non-resident non-Jew)...\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, <em>Shemoth</em> 21:28 is instructing that a <em>shor nisqal</em> may not be made use of in any way - not by a resident alien, nor by those non-Jews who pass through your dwellings willing to purchase it.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, a <em>ger toshav</em> was a non-Jew who was subject to Jewish jurisprudence and governmental regulation in every way. They are often referred to in the Torah and many times are spoken of in the third person as people who are obligated in certain thing as well as prohibited from certain acts while living under the Jewish nation. (See MT Hilkhoth Melakhim Umilhhamoth 8-10 for a complete discussion of this subject.)</p>\n\n<p>And this is what the statement indicates in <em>Shemoth</em> 12:49, \"<em>Torah ahhath yihyeh la-ezrahh wa-la-ger ha-gar be-thokhekhem</em> - There shall be one law for the native-born and the resident alien who dwells among you.\" See also, <em>Wayyiqra</em> 24:22 and <em>Bamidbar</em> 15:16, 29.</p>\n\n<p>As Rav Sa`adyah Gaon writes in his introduction to <em>HaNivhhar Emunoth Wa-De'oth</em>, most people arrive at false conclusions instead of the truth because they settle too quickly, do not search out a matter thoroughly, and base their conclusions on incomplete or faulty investigation. The Torah is not a document thrown together and rabbinic law is not a pollyannish connection of dots. Search it thoroughly and weigh all of its parts before assuming error on its part (<em>has wa-shalom</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>For your first question about needing to be told that the bull cannot be eaten, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/61106/472\">this answer</a>.  Your other question is asks why we care about ownership; we care because there are uses for the carcass besides food.</p>\n\n<p>An animal that you can't eat, but are allowed to benefit from, can be sold to non-Jews.  Non-Jews have no prohibition against eating it.  They can also use its hide:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself; <strong>thou mayest give it unto the stranger that is within thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto a foreigner;</strong> for thou art a holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk. (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0514.htm#21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 14:21</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In fact, this is routinely done with the region containing the sciatic nerve; this part of an otherwise-kosher animal is forbidden to Jews, so butchers sell that part to gentiles.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does the Talmud record the Rabbis' thoughts and theories about the science of natural phenomenon?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are various areas in the Gemara where there is discussion about natural events, often appearing like a tangential discussion. Some examples are in Bechoros 7-8 or Pesachim 94. I understand that many halachic or historical topics are arranged in this tangential manner, but what is the reason for including hypotheses about science? If someone thought thunder is caused by lightning breaking apart balls of hail and another thought shooting stars were rips in the firmament that let the light from behind it through or another argued that the Greeks were wrong about the duration of a viper's gestation or another suggested the sun travels West to East behind the firmament at night, why include their suggestions on such subjects? (Note that I'm not asking about areas where there is actual halachic implications to the topics as with discussing if Tamei fish lay eggs or what time of day a chicken can lay an egg.) It appears that including such discussion risks opening it up for criticism about the Rabbis' knowledge, so there should be some positive purpose for including it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the Maharal, amongst others, literal readings of non-Halachik Talmudic or Midrashic statements are incorrect and indeed <em>Chazal</em> are not discussing natural phenomena at all. Rather, they are discussing fundamental metaphysical realities and theology at a level that requires a deeper understanding of their language and philosophy (See, e.g., Maharal <em>Be'er HaGolah Be'er</em> 6 where he discusses e.g. the passage in Pesachim you cite; See also e.g. Maimonides' Introduction to Commentary on the Mishna and Vilna Gaon's commentary on Mishlei 1:3).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a letter from Rabbi Hirsch found here <a href=\"http://www.mesora.org/hirsch.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mesora.org/hirsch.html</a> now printed in the ninth section of his collected writings. </p>\n\n<p>This letter deals with statements of Chazzal which deal with their view of sciences and seem bizarre to the modern mind. </p>\n\n<p>Here's two excerpts:</p>\n\n<p>Sages of Torah, not Masters of Science</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, the first principle that every student of Chazal’s statements must keep before his eyes is the following: Chazal were the sages of G-d’s law - the receivers, transmitters, and teachers of His toros, Hismitzvos, and His interpersonal laws. They did not especially master the natural sciences, geometry, astronomy, or medicine - except insofar as they needed them for knowing, observing, and fulfilling the Torah. We do not find that this knowledge was transmitted to them from Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>Later he says:</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud in Bova Kama declares “A human spine, after seven years, turns into a snake; this applies only if he did not kneel atModim. “ Anyone who reads this finds it laughable, but Pliny says the same statement almost word for word, “After a number of years the human spine turns into a snake.” Chazal, however, used this to teach a mussor lesson. To any mind it is clear that every similarly surprising statement of Chazal, if we look into it, was accepted as true by the scholars of the time.</p>\n\n<p>So there are two important lessons Rav Hirsch is pointing out from these Chazzal. \n One, don't ignore the reality as explained by contemporary scientists, deal with it.\n Two, the lesson learnt is the point, not the lesson plan or the message used.</p>\n\n\n",

But you're correct -- they absolutely could and did use brand-new clay pots, and then discard them if they became tamei. </p>\n\n<p>This was especially prevalent for cooking sacrificial meat; see for instance <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviticus 6:21</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Non-kohanim couldn't use pottery that had terumah cooked in it, whether it was tamei or not. Kohanim ate terumah, which had to be kept tahor, so they used either stone which couldn't become tamei, or pottery which was harder to become tamei (only from the inside). But once the pottery became tamei, it had to be thrown out because then it couldn't be used for chullin because it had the taste of terumah, and it couldn't be used for terumah because it was tamei. Maaser sheini, even non-kohanim ate and it needed to be kept tamei. Sacrifices made any vessels used with them non-kosher after the 1 or 2 day eating period elapsed, so if they were pottery or stone they were discarded, and if they were metal they were kashered.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>When taharah was a priority stone kelim were used.

I am assuming that you are talking about a small (1-3 people, avg.) group of people, though, there is no strict protocol. Also, I have usually seen this announcement for \"newly\" ill people, someone undergoing a serious procedure, or someone who's situation has changed to a dangerous near-death situation. (I.e. - someone who was already ill for some time, Tehillim was already said, and is now getting better and recovering at home, might not be announced.) Also, if you have 50 names, I don't think they would announce all the names prior to Tehillim.</p>\n\n<p>2 - Tehillim is recited responsively</p>\n\n<p>3 - Prayer for the ill (<em>Mi Shebrach L'Cholim</em> is recited with the Hebrew names mentioned aloud. I have never seen anywhere where the names are silently said.</p>\n\n<p>The procedure is different, however, if you are talking about the <em>Mi Sheberach L'Cholim</em> prayer if it is recited as part of the Torah reading service. There are various customs in each shul.</p>\n\n<p>Some have people line up before the Gabbai, and each person tells the Gabbai the ill name(s) which are recited aloud. My shul used to do it this way for about 60 years until about 8 years ago, the rabbi realize that this caused a crowd at the Bimah and some people were embarassed to announce their ill people's names aloud so that others could hear. As a result, the procedure has been (and this is done in many other shuls) to have the Gabbia recite the beginning of the prayer, and pause, and each person would individually recite the names, silently. (As a Gabbai, myself, I have a master list of names which I recite silently during the pause. Yes, there might be some duplication between my recital and some congregants, but that's not a problem.)</p>\n\n\n",

However, the Toras Ha'asham holds very strongly that since the Torah said it is permitted one should eat it and not throw it out.

That is the physical properties of the animal make it Kosher.</p>\n<p>Regarding birds, the understanding is that the Torah, choosing to make the smaller list, lists only non-Kosher birds. Kosher birds are more numerous. However since there is uncertainty about what those non-Kosher birds are, exactly, in practice the list of Kosher birds are quite small - only those that we have a tradition about being a Kosher bird is Kosher.</p>\n<p>The Talmud does provide, as for animals, signs of a Kosher bird.

So we purchased two guinea fowl, put them in a cage on top of the car, and headed out to look for old shochtim and rabbanim who may have slaughtered or supervised its slaughter in the old country. Being a bird native to North Africa, we tried North Africans and Yemenites.</p>\n<p>We started with the Yemenite shochet who had taught us. No luck. He directed us to several others. Still no one recognized it. At least we were impressed with their honesty. After several attempts around Jerusalem, we were ready to give up. The following day we took the guinea fowl to an old distinguished rabbi in the Har Nof section of Jerusalem. With a faint glimmer of recognition, the rabbi asked that one be removed from the cage so he could better examine it. Nope, he did not recognize the bird.</p>\n<p>But that clever guinea took the opportunity and bolted from the room. The scene that followed, with the old rabbi in his long caftan chasing the bird, could have been out of any comedy movie. If anyone should happen to find a stray, odd-looking, lost bird in Jerusalem, it just might be our missing guinea.</p>\n<p>Our perseverance finally paid off. While returning from shechting a deer in Tzefas we still had (one) guinea as a traveling partner. We stopped in to see Rabbi Elbaz, an old Algerian shochet. We had struck gold. He unquestionably recognized the bird and attested to the fact that he had slaughtered it in Algeria close to fifty years ago.</p>\n<p>Our next subject was the partridge, another bird we suspected was kosher. Here we were having even greater difficulty. Finally I recalled that once, while researching the small Aramaic-speaking community in Israel, their chief rabbi had told me that he had slaughtered a bird named “keklik” in Turkish. Some quick reserach revealed he was talking about the partridge. Pay dirt again. We brought him the bird, he ID’ed it, and we were on our way with another tradition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/cons-keep-basics-birds.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">This Star-K article</a> delves into a discussion of the kashrut of partridges, pheasants and locusts.</p>\n\n<p>There is also some additional information on the topic via Natan Slifkin's studies on various animals on www.zootorah.com.

    "content": "# An eye for an eye Hammurabi's code\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Hammurabi is supposed to predate the Torah and contains a verse \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\".\nI've done a little reading around the issue, but is there any reference to why there would be an identical quote in this code and in the Torah? Why would there be exactly the same quote before we were given the Torah, considering that we believe that the Torah was recorded by Moshe and dictated by G-d?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: There's a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/37390/472\">similar question</a> asked, but I would like to expand about why mine is slightly different. It makes sense that the concept of \"an eye for an eye\" would exist, given that it's a 'logical' principle (mishpat) but this doesn't explain why it is exactly the same sentence. How can it be if the Torah is divinely inspired that someone else written the same quote? While the differences in the rest of the Code and the Torah are obviously important and there are clear differences, this quote is important.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Also, upon more research I came across the Epic of Gilgamesh.

The closest thing is ¶ 196, which reads*:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>šumma awīlum īn mār awīlim uḫtappid īnšu uḫappadu</em><br>\n  \"If an <em>awīlu</em>** blinds the eye of another <em>awīlu</em>, they shall blind his eye.\"  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The following ¶¶ 197–201 then lay out similar punishments for an <em>awīlu</em> breaking the bone or knocking out a tooth of another <em>awīlu</em>, as well as lesser punishments (fines in silver) for injuring a <em>muškēnu</em> (\"commoner\") or a slave.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, it is <em>not</em> accurate to say that the same phrase \"eye for an eye\" would occur both in the Torah and in the Code of Hammurabi, not even accounting for variation in translation.

He learns that according to our Tradition, the Torah's existence predated the Creation of the world [although it then existed in a different form], and this Torah, as a set of ideas, was expressed through different descending layers of Creation, coming down to the material world.</p>\n<p>People of the earlier generations were spiritually sophisticated enough to understand these concepts either by tradition from Adam or by looking at the Creation itself.</p>\n<p>He adds another <em>chiddush</em> without sourcing (possibly his own, I don't know). He derives the word Hammurabi from two roots, <em>Ham</em> and <em>rab</em>, where the first is identified with the name of Noach's son, and the second means \"great\" or \"oldest\", which suggests the person talked about is the oldest son of Ham, who is named Kush in the Bible.</p>\n<p>Bereishis Rabba 42 identifies Nimrod, Amrafel and Kush. R' Essas also suggests that Hammurabi is a variant of Amrafel.</p>\n<p>He bring is the Gemara in Eiruvin 53, where Rav holds his name is Amrafel because his words (which R' Essas identifies as laws) brought unclarity or darkness into the world (<em>amr</em> means word, <em>afel</em> - unclarity, darkness).</p>\n<p>Shmuel derives Nimrod from <em>marad</em>, rebellion, because he rebelled against G-d.</p>\n<p>R' Essas summarizes that Hammurabi was a rebel against G-d, who's laws brought unclarity to understanding of the world. He says that the Hammurabi code does resemble the laws of the Torah, but it was Hammurabi who took them and confused/inverted them in process of adapting them to his own, anti-G-d philosophy. The similarity remains, but the starting point is fundamentally different - to acknowledge the sun as the main god.</p>\n<p>So in the beginning of history, humanity starts with closeness to G-d, then there is separation expressed through idol worship and desire to invent own laws, and finally another bringing close by revelation of the Torah to the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The people were accustomed to systems of law in which an eye for an eye was carried out. The Torah therefore says that yes indeed, what is deserved is an eye for an eye.</p>\n\n<p><em>However</em>, along with that verse came an oral tradition: what is <em>deserved</em> is an eye for an eye, but what we carry out is financial restitution instead -- \"a hand for a hand\" means that money should change hands.</p>\n\n\n",

How much effort do you need to do to locate these heirs (in terms of time or distance)? What if despite sincere effort, you cannot locate any heirs - can you keep or sell the dog?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Yes. Lost property belongs to the heirs.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch - Choshen Mishpat - <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01977_part_24.html#HtmpReportNum0001_L2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">סימן רס - המוצא דבר שמוכח שהנח שם</a> - mentions by the way that lost property belongs to the heirs.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אוֹ שֶׁהָיָה יוֹרֵשׁ שֶׁאָנוּ טוֹעֲנִין לוֹ, שֶׁמָּא שֶׁל אָבִיו הָיָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Normally, one has to claim that a <em>found</em> item originally belonged to one.

He has to claim it was his and he hid it in the wall; if he didn't do so, we don't suggest the option to him. But regarding heirs, Bet Din would suggest to them that maybe it belonged to their father.)</p>\n\n<p>Regarding selling/keeping the dog - these Halachot are explicit in Shulchan Aruch ibid <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01977_part_24.html#HtmpReportNum0008_L2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">סימן רסז</a>, in 22, 23 and 24 - how long you have to keep an animal that eats and does not pay for its keep.

When you turn on the faucet, hot water leaves the tank and cold water enters.</p>\n\n<p>I see two possible problems here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is the water being heated directly from the sun (חמה), which is permitted, or from an implement warmed by the sun (תולדת חמה), which is forbidden?</li>\n<li>When new cold water enters the tank, does it get cooked by the hot water already in the tank?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What do the different poskim say about this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><sub>All sources are from <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/19590\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yeshiva.org.il's detailed article about this.</a> Note that i am relying on them being correct -- i did not check them.</sub></p>\n\n<p>As we said in the question, there are two possible issues: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is it being warmed directly by the sun or not?</li>\n<li>Does the cold water get cooked upon entering?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is most definitely a <em>machloket</em> about whether or not it can be used, so make sure to ask your rabbi before using it to get a personal psak.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Let's start with the first issue.</p>\n\n<p>Some write that the water gets heated directly from the sun, and that the glass and pipes do not absorb enough heat to actually heat the water, making it permissible. These include the Tzitz Eliezer (7:19), Rav Moshe Tzvi Neriah, Rav Tzvi Pesach Frank, and Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (הערות על ספר יסודי ישורון, עמוד לא; הו\"ד בספר שולחן שלמה שיח ג יג).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Rav Binyamin Yehoshua Silber (שו\"ת אז נדברו מלאכת אופה 13) writes that without the <em>dud</em>, the water would never heat up that much, and since it is the <em>dud</em> that makes the water get so hot (by focusing the sun's rays), it is considered <em>toldat chamah</em>, and is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>(Sorry, the article didn't bring Sephardic poskim on this matter.)</p>\n\n<p>This is only regarding heating it initially. What about the second question, the new [cold] water that enters when you turn on the faucet?</p>\n\n<p>Most poskim agree that this is a <em>psik reisha d'lo neicha lei</em> by an <em>issur d'rabbanan</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Ovadia Yosef writes (Yabia Omer part 4 OC 34) that it [a פרדלנ\"ל by דרבנן] is permissible, but it is still good to be <em>machmir</em>, and if possible, stop the cold water from entering.</p>\n\n<p>Ashkenazi poskim don't generally allow a פרדלנ\"ל by a d'rabbanan, but this is a special case. We also have <em>grama</em> here -- you don't actually heat the cold water -- it happens on its own. As such, it's now a פרדלנ\"ל plus two <em>issurei d'rabbanan</em>, and that is enough to be <em>meikel</em> and allow it, at least according to Rav Tzvi Pesach Frank (his shu\"t OC 188), Harav Or Letzion [unsure who this is], and the Tzitz Eliezer (7:19, 20:16).</p>\n\n<p>However, the Minchat Yitzchak (4:44) and Shevet Halevi (1:94) disagree with defining this as a פרדלנ\"ל + two <em>d'rabbanan</em>s, saying that this is not <em>grama</em>, and it is also a <em>psik reisha d'neicha lei</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Shmirat Shabbat K'hilchata (1:45) uses the term \"טוב להמנע\" -- it is preferable to abstain. He also brings Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach that [despite his ruling that it is heated by the sun itself,] there are some systems that will automatically switch to using an electric boiler if there isn't enough sun, which is definitely forbidden, so it's better to avoid it.</p>\n\n<p>The article sums it up: If one wants to be lenient, he has upon whom to rely, but as for one who is stringent -- תבוא עליו ברכה.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think there is another problem that was not addressed, and that is, that there is cold water in the pipes from before hand.</p>\n\n<p>If you ever turned on the hot water faucet, it is cold for a few seconds until the hot water comes through.</p>\n\n<p>This being the case, it will be forbidden to turn on the hot water because at the meeting point between the hot water and the cold water, the cold is being heated by the hot water.</p>\n\n\n",

Those interpretations of the Bible that have legal force still do; the other material, less so. So I'd distinguish between \"Oral Torah\" and the narrower \"Oral Law.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do we now dismiss parts of the Oral Torah as incorrect?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some pages of the Talmud are full of folk medicine, which today we don't use. Already in the 900s, Rabbi Sharira Gaon wrote that the sages of the Talmud were incorporating into their text all the wisdom at their disposal, which included medical thinking from that time that has since become outdated. Today (whether the year is 900 or 2015) we are obligated to use whatever medical treatments are deemed appropriate by today's medical mainstream.</p>\n\n<p>Most rabbis will still study the medical pages of the Talmud, perhaps with a few shrugs -- it's interesting to see how they approached the problems, and it's amazing what a sophisticated legal system they could develop despite the scientific challenges of the era. (A more cautious, traditionalist interpretation would say \"maybe this worked in their time and place, but we must use the medicine that works for us.\")</p>\n\n<p>The trickier question becomes <em>laws</em> in the Talmud that appear to be based on scientific understanding. The one everyone loves to quote is about killing gnats on Shabbat because they don't reproduce the way normal animals do. There are broadly three approaches:</p>\n\n<p><strong>A.</strong> The rabbis could never have been wrong about science.  In the case of gnats, maybe they were using terminology popular to the common folk of their day (which today we'd call scientifically obsolete), but the underlying law intended was \"animals, as defined by sexual reproduction visible to the naked eye\", which hasn't changed. <a href=\"http://adderabbi.blogspot.com/2011/05/stalemates-and-doubts.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alternatively</a>: The same way why-bad-things-happen-to-good-people is beyond our comprehension, we're stuck just not understanding that passage in the Talmud. </p>\n\n<p><strong>B.</strong> The law is \"on Shabbat, you may not kill animals that reproduce sexually.\" That law has not changed, the application has. 1500 years ago they thought that gnats weren't included, and today we know they are, so our practical advice regarding gnats has since changed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>C.</strong> When the Talmud was completed -- let's say around the year 500 -- certain <em>laws</em> as stated were locked into place, which we still respect. (A twist on this would be: the Torah's prohibition on killing \"animals\" applied to \"animals\" as the term was understood in ancient culture.)</p>\n\n<p>On a given issue, you'll see any combination of A, B, and C applied today, depending on who you ask. </p>\n\n<p>One high school student who was disturbed by the gnats-on-Shabbat statement consulted with the late <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/06/2015/missing-rabbi-gettinger/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Emmanuel Gettinger</a>, a Talmudist of the highest caliber and an astronomy enthusiast. Rabbi Gettinger replied:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is your question one on Jewish law, namely, what do we follow if the legal statement appears to have been predicated on obsolete scientific understanding? [I.e. do we apply B or C above.] Or is it a philosophical one, if the rabbis of the Talmud had so much Godly wisdom, how could they have been wrong about science? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Gettinger was prepared to deal with both of those conflicts.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Does this take away from the holiness of the Oral Torah? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some rabbis will say you can skip certain passages and still say you completed \"the Talmud\"; but generally, no not really. It gives you an appreciation for how much effort went into study and complex legal codes, despite the scientific limitations of the day. It's also plausible that certain discussions (e.g. the laws of mythological creatures) were intended simply as theoretical constructs (thought experiments) to best understand the details of the underlying laws, which can then be used to apply those laws to today's technology. (E.g. if you have a precise legal definition of \"cooking\" on Shabbat, you'll know whether it applies to microwaves.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is it heretical to say that the Oral Law was influenced by the cultures of the time, for example with regards to women etc?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again I'd distinguish between lore and law. A story of an interaction between a rabbi and his wife ... certainly culture comes into play, and it's not always clear-cut what lesson to take from that story. My personal <em>preference</em> is to read the story in whatever way gives it the most significance.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the law is of biblical force. The same way that \"an eye for an eye\" means restitution, according to the Talmud, \"you absolutely must dwell in a sukkah\" was only addressed to men, not women. We accept that binding interpretation of the biblical law. </p>\n\n<p>Some of the law is of rabbinic force, which we again don't have the power to change today. The rabbis of the pre-Talmudic period obligated men, not women, to pray three times a day. We don't have the authority today to suddenly give women that same level of absolute obligation. (Would we want to is a different question.) If you feel better crying bitter tears that the rabbis back then were outdated and boo-hoo they made the wrong law, but we're stuck with it, well that's your prerogative; personally I prefer to figure there was some universal wisdom that went into it. (Keep in mind that women in many pre-industrial cultures spend a significant part of the day gathering water. Between that and childrearing, it may not have been feasible to obligate all women to pray thrice daily. If a woman today is up to praying thrice daily, by all means that's a wonderful thing and we support it.)</p>\n\n<p>The famous example that everyone loves to volley around is women reading the Torah. \"Theoretically it's okay, but don't do it because it's dishonorable\", says the Talmud. Those on the left of Orthodoxy will say that statement was predicated on cultural norms, \"but today when women are Fortune 500 CEOs there's no such dishonor.\" Those on the center and right refer to this as a straw-man interpretation of the Talmud, and would say that the \"dishonor\" described is not predicated on culture. (In this instance, the Talmud also says that some women had signet rings as they owned their own businesses, and a woman who out-earned her husband could demand financial independence. The \"dishonor\" here would be that the men in the room, who were supposed to be more-obligated to study and spending more hours doing so, are doing a lousy job at Torah reading.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Oral Tora is devine and was given to Moshe along with the written Tora on mount Sinai (see for example Midrash Sifra, Behar, 1: \"וידבר ה' אל משה בהר סיני לאמר, מה עניין שמיטה אצל הר סיני והלא כל המצות נאמרו מסיני אלא מה שמיטה נאמרו כללותיה ודקדוקיה מסיני, אף כולם נאמרו כללותיהם ודקדוקיהם מסיני\"). </p>\n\n<p>However, there is a debate among what was included in the Oral Tora that was given. For example - Rabi Yehoshua ben Levi from one side takes the \"broad\" definition: \"מקרא משנה הלכות תלמוד תוספתות אגדות ואפי' מה שתלמיד ותיק עתיד לומר לפני רבו כלן נאמרו למשה בסיני\" (Vayikra Raba, Achrei Mois), and on the other hand we have Rabi Abahu taking a more narrow inclution: \"משהשלים מ' יום, נתן לו הקב\"ה את התורה מתנה, שנאמר: ויתן אל משה. וכי כל התורה למד משה?! כתיב בתורה (איוב יא): ארוכה מארץ מדה ורחבה מני ים, ולארבעים יום למדה משה?! אלא כללים למדהו הקב\"ה למשה\" (Shmois Raba, Tetsave). </p>\n\n<p>Personally I don't think that saying that the Oral Law was influenced by the cultures of the time is heretic but only if you understand that those laws were directed by Hashem and that they all apply today according to the Halacha that is accepted apart from specific places with specific reasoning. There are clear examples of Poiskim (e.g. the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%A2%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna Berura</a> (who brings the Magen Avraham's words: \"בכמה דברים השתנו הטבעים\") and <a href=\"http://daf-yomi.com/DYItemDetails.aspx?itemId=13374\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Rambam</a>) who state nature (even of the human body) in some aspects has changed with time, and some Psikot the ha makes in Mishne Tora are according to those changes in nature, and thus need to be adjusted to our (his) time. But again, only ones in the stature of the Rambam can determine such claims, it is not a conecpts that can be apprehended without having a \"belly full of Shas and Poiskim\" (= a deep knowledge and understanding of the Tora, Oral, written and the later literature by Rishonim, and Achronim).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was Avraham really in the right going to sacrifice Yitzchak?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone says, \"Hey, you. You go kill _______ or i'll kill you,\" you are not allowed to go kill that person. That's an extreme case. But in the case with Yitzchak, there was no 'Or i'll kill you.' So why did Avraham go to sacrifice Yitzchak? Was it because it was a direct commandment from Hashem? (Remember, Avraham also pleaded on behalf of the people of Sodom, who were Rasha'im. All the more so, he should plead on behalf of his <em>son</em>, who was also a Tzaddik!)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Yes this was very different because it was a direct command from Hashem. Don't forget, a Navi cannot ignore his nevuah.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between this and Sedom was that from Avraham's perspective there was no reason for Hashem to warn him about the impending destruction except to get him to pray, so he did. By the Akeida he was commanded to carry out the action, so he did. Well, at least attempted to.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The merit of all ideals are measured in contrast to the will of Hashem. He now had clear direction as to what the will of Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>While the severity of murder surpasses saving your own skin, it doesn't surpass Hashem's command. Beis Din is told to kill certain people, prophets told to kill certain people.</p>\n\n<p>Sodom was a Gezeira, a heavenly judgment that he tried to weigh in on and add merit. This was a command from Hashem to him. It was not a judgement that you pray to have it changed as Moshe Rabbeinu did. It was saying to sacrifice his son.</p>\n\n<p>Technically though, it was the wrong thing to do, since it was not actually Hashem's intention that he should kill Yitzchok. This also crossed Avraham Avinu's mind as we find the Medrash quoting different arguments the Satan have him to stop. After failing a few attempts the Satan told him it is just a test. To this, instead of refuting it, Avraham Avinu answered that the punishment of a liar is that you don't believe him even when he says the truth.</p>\n\n<p>I once heard that Avraham Avinu couldn't actually do it. His hand stopped short, since all his limbs only did Hashem's will. This is alluded to in Nedarim, that Hashem gave him control over those limbs which we cannot control.</p>\n\n\n",

Unfortunately, from the two gospels that show bloodlines, one is through Maria, which is invalid to us because tribal descent is patrilineal (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9929/jewish/Chapter-1.htm#v=18\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bamidbar 1:18</a>), and tribal descent can not be adopted (an adopted non-cohen child by a cohen is not given cohen-status) (and even it it could: the line is not through Solomon, but Nathan), and the line through Joseph goes through King Conyahu (Jeconia) that was cursed and kingship was taken away from him (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16019#v=30\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yirmiyahu 22:30</a>).</p>\n\n<p>There are various of such things: one of which is alleged virgin birth, which is not something than can be observed by onlookers (does a virginborn look any different from a nonvirginborn?) and goes against the principle of public signs from hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Miracles were never part of the necessary conditions for proving someone is mashiach; the Torah even states that G'd will let false prophets perform miracles to test the jewish nation <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9977#v=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">devarim 13:2-6</a>; so we reject the claim that if someone is able to perform miracles, he <strong>must</strong> be the mashiach.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly: the maschiach was supposed to rebuild the temple (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16190#v=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">michah 4:1</a>)(the physical one), whereas the temple was still standing in the time of the early gospel; and peace on earth did not happen (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16190#v=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">michah 4:3</a>,<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15933#v=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yeshayahu 2:4</a>); worse: the jewish people saw one of its worse destructions; the romans squashed all rebellion, destroyed our temple, and scattered us amonst the nations. There is not a 'he will come to finish the job' clausule in our texts. </p>\n\n<p>All in all, it is best not to enter a discussion of such things. I personally have high respect for christians and have no interest in convincing them out of their belief. I just belief, as do most jews in my area, that christianity is for the christians, and judaism is for jews; those who were lost to us will find their way back, but generally each nation has its own G'dly-mission on this planet.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Christians believe that Jesus was the Moshiach (Messiah), and that he will return to life at some point in time. However, one of the things that the Moshiach will do is eliminate war. Since Jesus did not do this, he could not have been the Moshiach. Since the New Testament claims that he <em>was</em> the Moshiach, to Orthodox Jews, this invalidates the entire New Testament.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What qualifications are necessary to become a mashgiach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I had thought that mashgochim (kosher kitchen supervisors) had to have semikkha or darn close. But people have been telling me that all you need to do is \"know the laws\" of kashrus, which they seem to mean on a very superficial level. I have heard that women and non-shomrei Shabbos can be mashgochim; it just depends on getting a Vaad to trust you to oversee the kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>Is this true? What are the objective standards that need to be met to become the official mashgiach in a hechshered, Orthodox kitchen? How does the process for appointing mashgochim actually work?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A woman is permitted (as they are also required to eat Kosher therefore they can supervise on this). Someone who is not Shomer Shabbat cannot be (as you cannot trust them).</p>\n\n<p>The kashrut authority will have their own set of standards beyond this. This is quoted from London Beit Din:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>MASHGICHIM -WHO IS ELIGIBLE? What does KLBD look for in a mashgiach?\n  “Someone who has eyes at the back of his head!” Rabbi Conway answers\n  with a chuckle. But when he shares a wine-production fluke to prove\n  the importance of a mashgiach being on the ball and highly perceptive,\n  it’s no longer very merry. Wine production is undoubtedly the hardest\n  thing to supervise, he says. A non-Jew may not move nor touch any\n  keilim involved in the production. He may not even switch on the\n  machinery. During a run in Spain this August, the mashgiach, Rabbi\n  Shimon Black, noticed a worker climbing up a ladder to the top of the\n  press. “What’re you doing?” he yelled. The sieve had fallen into the\n  wine-filled vat and he was innocently going to dive in to dish it out.\n  “Oh, no, you can’t do that!” Shimon cried, frantically switching\n  places and slipping into a harness himself for a dry red…dip. On\n  another note, at a joint-KLBD catered royal banquet at Buckingham\n  Palace, his mashgichim dressed in coats and tails to replace the\n  butlers for the night so that the choice of exclusive non-mevushal\n  wines, selected by Her Majesty’s vintners, wouldn’t become yayin\n  nesech. “A mashgiach must also be a people person or he won’t last 24\n  hours.” Having to deal with chefs, often non-Jewish ones, and service\n  staff who naturally prefer it their way and may get annoyed if change\n  is demanded, a mashgiach has to tactfully balance being diplomatic,\n  firm and courteous. “Also, the mashgiach has to be a yirei shamayim to\n  appreciate his awesome responsibility to the Jewish community. At the\n  end of the day, hundreds of people will be relying on the shomer in\n  the restaurant kitchen daily.” With the hard-to-find combination of\n  qualities, and responsibility and integrity an obvious must, it’s very\n  hard to find the right candidate. KLBD ends up rejecting nine out of\n  every ten applicants. “If someone does already tick all the boxes,\n  he’s probably an executive director somewhere up there!” The exacting\n  search process means that the winning candidates are always\n  high-calibre individuals. But high-calibre mashgichim alone is not\n  sufficient for KLBD. “If he wasn’t on site for the right amount of\n  time, he has failed,” notes Rabbi Conway. “KLBD insists that every\n  catered function has fulltime hashgachah from start to finish, no\n  difference if it’s a heimishe caterer or if it’s in a shul hall.” This\n  is because, unlike restaurants, which have a fixed venue and menu and\n  are either milky or meaty, functions involve different logistics,\n  staff and menus every night and one can’t know, for example, which\n  chef will decide to bring his own knife or garnishing tools.\n  “Similarly, at the very least, restaurants must have a shomer Shabbos\n  person on site responsible for kashrus whenever the kitchen operates.\n  And I’d encourage customers to enquire about a shomer’s presence.\n  You’d be surprised how many kashrus agencies don’t enforce this basic\n  requirement.” KLBD’s senior rabbinic inspectors can be seen going up\n  and down London’s bustling kosher high-streets all day. Rabbi Conway\n  actually authored a comprehensive manual for roving mashgichim and it\n  has since been used, and adapted, by other UK hashgachos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are at least three positions most people refer to when they say mashgiagh. The following are things I've heard from my Rebbeim and fiends who are in the hashgacha business.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The person who's name or organization is on the store or taking care of an event, who, either in person or through an employee, is supposed to pop in once in a while to make sure everything is kosher v'yosher. </p></li>\n<li><p>The person who would sit in the establishment the entire time the cooking process (or milking) is going, this is called a mashgiach temidi. Sometimes this person will be involved in the actual cooking to make it bishul yisroel according to sfardi standards.</p></li>\n<li><p>The person who goes into a nonjewish establishment and prepares it for kosher use, such as a hotel for a wedding. This person usually then fills the role of #1 or #2 for the duration of the event, many times employing others for help.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, which one of these mashgichim know what? </p>\n\n<p>The umbrella name of #1 its usually headed by a knowledgeable person. Many times the employees, the on-site mashgiach, know less about kashrus than the average person attending the event. They are instructed to call their supervisor if a question arises. This proves problematic when points cannot be properly conveyed over the phone, or when the event is on shabbos. Many times a shabbos morning kiddush will have boys (who I would call barely religious, but won't for fear of 'who are you to judge' comments) who you wouldn't trust to cook your eggs in your own house, two calling themselves the waiters and one calling himself the mashgiach. Next event They swap roles. This is common even by the most Chareidi/Yeshivish/ Chassidish kiddushim you could imagine.</p>\n\n<p>The name on the store is also a tricky sticky point. How often does someone come inspect the store? One of the largest Jewish communities has a certain mashgiach's name on 80% of it's restaurants. This mashgiach has no employees and is left to supervise every single store himself. Reports vary, but apparently it's easier to sight Bigfoot than to see this mashgiach in one of his restaurants. </p>\n\n<p>Mashgiach #2 is usually the least knowledgeable. Consider the hours they keep and the money they get paid and you'll understand we are not dealing with skilled labor.  We are dealing with someone being paid to sit somewhere with the single qualification of being Jewish. (I was in a restaurant once, under the hashgacha of one of the biggest and most used kashrus organizations, which I was told was the most reliable hashgacha in Manhattan restaurants. Halfway through the meal the mashgiach temidi who obviously suffered from a mental disorder was making his way through the restaurant asking people where they live and of he could hitch a ride home. I would trust the illegal immigrant employees more, but they are not Jewish.) </p>\n\n<p>On to #3. This is usually the most knowledgeable mashgiach. Fortunately or not that knowledge is often times used to invoke a leniency that other mashgichim would not rely on, which can lead to issues.</p>\n\n<p>As with any other endeavor, buyer beware.</p>\n\n<p>Considering Orthodox societal norms, a woman could theoretically find work as mashgiach #2, although I doubt it would happen. Perhaps if they gave the job a different title like 'eid echad/ yisroel hamivashel' it might fly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein ruled that a woman may be appointed as a mashgicha.

The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar_of_Worms\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rokeah</a>, for example, writes (Hilkhot Teshuva: 11) that sitting in ice or snow is an appropriate form of penance for sexual relations with a married woman:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הבא על אשת איש שהוא במיתה יסבול צער קשה כמיתה ישב בקרח או בשלג בכל יום שעה אחת בכל יום פעם אחת או פעמיים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It doesnt seem that one needs to do that act of self-affliction in particular; it is just a way of causing great suffering to oneself, \"similar to death\". Accordingly, in the summer, he suggests (there) other forms of self-flagellation, such as sitting among bees or other insects.</p>\n\n<p>He further generally recommends all types of self-flagellation and suffering.</p>\n\n<p>This is similar to the writings of his mentor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_ben_Samuel_of_Regensburg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yehuda HaHassid</a> who in Sefer Hassidim (ed. Margolis: 176) suggests torturing oneself by sitting in ice. (Although perhaps this refers to sitting in a frozen river (cf. 177) in which the pain comes from the cold water, rather than the ice.) He similarly approvingly cites a story (528) about a pious person sitting with his feet in freezing water until his feet became frozen together. Here too it doesn't sound like there is significance to torturing yourself with ice in particular; winter just affords someone with great snow and ice torture opportunities. During the summer other forms of self-affliction are possible (cf. 167).</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, however, the Sefer Hassidim adds (there; in parenthesis in ed. Margolis) that water is particularly appropriate for use in afflicting oneself, as there is a Midrash that Adam afflicted himself for 130 years with water as a form of penance for eating from the <em>ets hadaat</em>. (Perhaps this would apply to snow or ice as well):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולמה במים אמרו במדרש ק\"ל שנים היה אדם הראשון יושב במים עד חוטמו להתכפר על שחטא בעץ הדעת שנגזר גזירה על כל הדורות </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A partial answer re. the second half of the question*:</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this form of bodily mortification is to sustain commensurate repentance (a concept developed by the early pietists known as \"teshuvat ha-mishkal\", wherein the offender inflicts pain commensurate to the punishment biblically prescribed for a given sin).</p>\n\n<p>In a responsum re. a person who committed homosexual activity, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayyim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

He distinguishes this from postponing saying the Shechiyanu on the fruit since the practice is to say the Shehechiyanu when first eating the fruit, not just when first seeing the fruit, so this isn't a postponement.</p>\n<p>The Ramo adds that if the fruit won't be available after the three weeks (it will spoil) that one even says a Shehechiyanu and eats it. (The Taz and the Magein Avraham there both address the implication that you don't wait until Shabbos according to the opinions that you can say a Shehechiyanu on Shabbos during the three weeks).</p>\n<p>So from all of this, the result is that doing something that creates the obligation of Shehechiyanu is avoided if possible, but if the cause of the Shehechiyanu cannot be avoided the blessing is said.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer Melamed puts it all together <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=7966\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a person chances upon a \"mitvza\" which necessitates the \"shehecheyanu\" blessing (for example, Brit Milah or Pidyon Haben), he recites the blessing. This is because it was not he that determined the time for the blessing; it was Heaven that granted him with such an opportunity at this time (Shulchan Arukh 551:17).</p>\n<p>Likewise, if a person meets a good friend for the first time in thirty days or more, and he is happy to see him, he blesses \"shehecheyanu,\" for if he does not bless immediately, he will lose the opportunity to bless. <strong>Similarly, \"shehecheyanu\" is recited by the father on the birth of a girl the first time he sees the newborn, for if he does not bless immediately he will forfeit the blessing (based on the Shulchan Arukh 225:1 and the Mishnah Berurah 223:2).</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Another type of \"long\" <em>berakhah</em> is called <em>samukhah le-haverta</em> (\"relying on its neighbor\") and does not itself have a <em>pethihah</em>, but \"relies\" as it were on the opening of the <em>berakhah</em> that was said directly before it.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>\"Short\"</em></strong> <em>berakhoth</em> consist of a <em>pethihah</em> only, like the <em>berakhoth</em> recited before eating, drinking, <em>misswoth</em>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>[The Rambam discusses these issues in the following sections: <em>Hilkhoth Qiryath Shema</em> 1:8; <em>Hilkhoth Berakhoth</em> 1:15.]</p>\n\n<p>In the <em>halakhoth</em> regarding the <em>shemoneh esrei</em>, it states that one must have <em>kawwanah</em> during the first <em>berakhah</em> of the prayer or he must return to the beginning. However, if one has proper <em>kawwanah</em> during the first blessing and then subsequently loses his <em>kawwanah</em> at any other time in the prayer, he does not have to return to the beginning and is still <em>yosse yedhei hovatho</em>. [See Rambam, <em>Hilkhoth Tefillah</em> 10:1]</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam also mentions that if someone mistakenly says the incorrect <em>berakhoth</em> for <em>Qiryath Shema</em> (i.e. night ones during the day or vice-versa), they fulfill their obligation as long as the <em>hathimah</em> is the correct <em>hathimah</em>. This is true because of the principle that says, \"<em>She-kol ha-berakhoth holkhoth aharei hathimathan</em> - For all blessings are determined by their <em>hathimah</em>\" (See <em>Hilkhoth Qiryath Shema</em> 1:9[8]).</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Now for my question</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<p>If someone is beginning to pray the <em>shemoneh esrei</em> and says the <em>pethihah</em> of the first <em>berakhah</em> with proper <em>kawannah</em> and then, during the middle section has stray thoughts or loses <em>kawwanah</em>, but then regains his clear mind and <em>kawwanah</em> during the <em>hathimah</em> - does he need to begin again? Or does his concentration during the <em>hathimah</em> suffice since that is how all <em>berakhoth</em> are reckoned?</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: I recognize that there are <em>shittoth</em> (usually associated with the commentators on the <em>Tur</em> and <em>Shulhan Arukh</em>)  that hold that no one is capable of proper <em>kawwanah</em> in our times, and so this question is essentially moot.

So true these days when freshly laundered clothes are no longer exciting and new, but it is not difficult to keep the minhag (It is not too hard to wear clothes that are not completely fresh).</p>\n\n<p>Best wishes!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahum_Rabinovitch\" rel=\"nofollow\">R.

This is clearly stated in Yoreh Deah and commentaries. The idea behind this is not that it is exciting and new to wear freshly cleaned clothing, but we do this to help us feel the mourning of the Bais Hamikdosh (Temple). By not wearing freshly laundered clothing, our simcha is lessened and it states in the Mishna Brura 25 that anyone who properly mourns over Jerusalem will be rewarded by experiencing its rejoicing.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Semichath ge'ulah l'tfilah by Maariv with a minyan\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <em>gemara</em> in <em>Brachoth</em> emphasizes the importance of <em>semichat ge'ulah l'tefilla</em> (adjoining redemption to prayer):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאמר ר' יוחנן איזהו בן העולם הבא זה הסומך גאולה לתפלה של ערבית...</p>\n<p>... For R' Yochanan said: Who will inherit the world to come? He who joins the <em>Ge'ulah</em> to the evening <em>Tefillah</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara then asks how R' Yochanan can say it is a requirement if we say \"<em>Hashkiveinu</em>...\" between <em>Ge'ulah</em> and <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> and answers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כיון דתקינו רבנן למימר השכיבנו כגאולה אריכתא דמיא</p>\n<p>Since the Rabbis instituted the prayer \"<em>Hashkiveynu</em>...\" it is to be considered part of <em>Ge'ulah</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Maharal (<em>Nethiv HaAvodah</em> chapter 7 [p. 96 in old version]) explains that <em>ge'ulah</em> is the blessing instituted with reference to redemption (connected to the words [Exodus 6:7] \"ולקחתי אתכם לי לעם\" - \"and I will take you to Me as a people\", whereas \"<em>hashkiveynu</em> relates to the maintenance of the redeemed state (i.e. protection, connected to the continuing words \"והייתי לכם לאלקים\" - \"and I will be to you as G-d\").</p>\n<p>The implication from the gemara is pretty clear that there were no other interruptions allowed between <em>geulah</em> and <em>tefilla</em>. Nonetheless, there is a controversial custom dating to the time of the Geonim  (or earlier) to recite verses at this point (argued to be a relic of when it replaced the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em> in the <em>tefillah betzibbur</em>). I believe many authorities do not say these verses for the reason of the gemara, and that that is the custom of <em>eretz yisrael</em> following the GR\"A. Nonetheless, I have never personally witnessed a minyan that omitted the kaddish between hashkiveinu and shemoneh esrei.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if such a custom does exist in any community of not saying anything at all between <em>hashkiveinu</em> and <em>shemoneh esrei</em>.</p>\n<p>Also, I believe certain halachik authorities (e.g. Rav Herschel Schachter of YU, if memory serves) do not say these verses (or the verses added on Shabbath and Yom Tov) even when the congregation does. Is there a point in this omission if one then answers the <em>kaddish</em>? Do these authorities also refrain from answering the <em>kaddish</em>?</p>\n<p>Finally, <em>mefarshim</em> grapple with defending the continuing custom of saying these verses and suggest that perhaps they too can be considered a <em>geulah arichta</em> (<em>Tosafoth</em> cited in <em>Mishna Berura</em> 236:6). Is this assumed to be the only argument for saying <em>kaddish</em> as well? Is there any explanation then for the customs of omitting the former but not the latter?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Your questions address both the idea of omitting as well as including Kaddish. I am providing a partial answer that addresses why Kaddish should be said and how this is related to the concept of <em>Geulah Arichta</em>, as you mentioned.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.beureihatefila.com/files/Maariv-10.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Beurei Hatefilah article - bottom of p. 4</a> citing Raav\"n (Rav Eliezer ben Natan, aka <em>Tzafnat Pane'ach</em>) on Brachot  <em>siman</em> 140:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In addition, the opening words of the prayer: Kaddish, Yisgadal\nV’Yiskadash, express the theme of redemption as it is written:\n<em>V’Hisgadalti V’Hiskadashti</em> etc. Those words do not create a break in\nthe link between redemption and the recital of Shemona Esrei in the\nTefilas Arvis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks to @Loewian for providing the source for the verse phrasing (copied from his comment):</p>\n<p>Yechezkel (Exekiel) 38:23 \"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהִתְגַּדִּלְתִּי וְהִתְקַדִּשְׁתִּי וְנוֹדַעְתִּי לְעֵינֵי גּוֹיִם\nרַבִּים וְיָדְעו כִּי אֲנִי ה</p>\n<p>\"Thus will I magnify Myself, and sanctify Myself, and I will make\nMyself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I\nam the L-RD.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'll see if I can locate something addressing the counter-argument.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# From Moshe to Moshe... no one greater?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On Maimonides tomb is written the epitaph: “From Moshe to Moshe, none arose like Moshe!”</p>\n\n<p>We can read in many sources (e.g. <a href=\"http://asknoah.org/essay/rambam\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://asknoah.org/essay/rambam</a>) that this implies Rambam was the greatest of all rabbis since Moshe.</p>\n\n<p>But what about someone like Rabbi Akiva? Wasn't he just as great or greater? According to the Talmud, Moshe Rabbeinu did not understand Rabbi Akiva's lectures.</p>\n\n<p>How seriously are we supposed to take the \"From Moshe to Moshe\" epitaph, and what does it mean halachically?</p>\n\n<p>This latter question is relevant because of <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2018%3A15-19&version=ESV\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 18:15-19</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>First of all, don't take it so literally. Exaggeration is allowed for eulogies, and I assume for an epitaph as well. Consider the fact that Rambam himself called his masterpiece Mishna Torah, the rabbinic name for Deuteronomy, he seems to have made this connection himself. But especially let's remember that Moshe Isserles has this same quote on his Epitaph, so let's not worry too much about this.</p>\n<p>That being said, the way I've seen it explained was this praise was said as far as his being a Marbitz Torah, that means someone who brings Torah to the masses. This has nothing to do with intelligence or any other measurement of personal greatness.</p>\n<p>This of course can be debated. Some possible contenders would be King Chizkiyahu and Rabi Akiva. But we can argue that Chizkiyahu did not personally teach Torah to the masses, he instituted a system where people would learn Torah, but he was not the teacher, see Sanhedrin 94b.\nRabi Akiva, although being a teacher and having the unnamed sources in Torah Shebaal Peh coming through his students, according to his opinion(Sanhedrin 86a), did not reach the masses personally. Rather it was his students that did. Rabi Akiva taught the five through whom Torah was refounded (Yevamos 62b). (As I'm writing this, another level of understanding suddenly hit me what the loss was when his thousands fold group of students, who he seemingly did teach personally, all died.)</p>\n<p>There are other personalities in Nach and Shaas who we can debate about as well, see for instance Bava Metzia 85b about Rabi Chiya, but that is the same situation as Rabi Akiva. Also Sanhedrin 21b concerning the greatness of Ezra: 'Ezra was worthy to have the Torah given through him, had not Moshe preceded him'. This is probably the strongest question I can think of right now on that Epitaph (@Mike pointed this out in the comments as well), but again we can try to say the case of someone who renewed the Torah to the masses, upon whom praise is showered as being worthy of giving it originally had he not been preceded by another, is different than someone who actually gave something original to the masses.</p>\n<p>Also along these lines is the fact that Rambam's original, personal work was so widely received. This echoes Moshe Rabbeinu's receiving and giving of the Torah, whereas other works of law, namely the Mishna and Talmud were compendiums of many opinions. The works of the Geonim, although arguably personal and not communal, were not as widely accepted by the masses outside of the towns where their Yeshivos were. This is obvious from some letters of the Geonim, and the masses remained extremely unlearned.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>On the <a href=\"https://www.hidabroot.org/question/258328#myfancy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hidabroot</a> website the following answer is brought in the name of the Chid\"a (tried looking it up on Hebrewbooks, but couldn't locate it):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כ\"כ עוד החיד\"א זצ\"ל בספרו שם הגדולים (מערכת מ אות קי) שמצא כתוב שלא היה שום תנא או אמורא שנקרא משה, והיינו דאמרי אינשי על הרמב\"ם ממשה ועד משה וכו' שלא היה תנא או אמורא שנקרא משה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Loosely translated, the saying came about because from Moshe Rabenu until the Ramba\"m no Tana or Amora existed with the name Moshe.</p>\n<p>Text in Shem Hagedolim:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/c4jMY.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/c4jMY.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I thought it said From Moshe to Moshe no one will rise like Moshe, meaning after the Rambams death no one be become as great as him.

When I went to get the Tanach from the Bookstore I told to order, I showed it to my friend. And accidentally a little amount of his saliva was dropped on The Book while he was talking. Back then I didn't care much about the accident.\nWhen I came back home and started to explore the Tanach. I remembered this accident and I remembered that my friend has herpes in his mouth, and since I am obsessed with cleanliness I wanted to put some medical liquid sterilizer we call it in Lebanon \"Spirto\" in order to kill some bacteria if there was in the first place, but I was hesitated since I didn't know if this is disrespectful to the Tanach but my obsession with cleanliness urged me to try to put a slight amount of it on the Tanach. In the first time everything was okay, I tried to put it second time and I noticed that after that it left barely noticeable slight malformation of almost an inch on the Tanach's cover, fortunately very superficial.</p>\n\n<p>Though it's very hard to notice it, I am very concerned if the Tanach is defiled. I feel so stupid, the book has been only for few minutes between my hands before such thing happened.</p>\n\n<p>Is it defiled ?

    "content": "# Can or should a shul expel talkative members who are also the shul's major benefactors?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sadly, talking during davening in shul is a major problem.</p>\n\n<p>Lets say a shul has a few people who constantly talk loudly throughout davening and they disturb the other people and the rabbi. The rabbi, board, members and others in the shul asked them nicely many times to be quiet, but they still disturb everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone is extra annoyed with these members. They approach the rabbi and request him to expel these members from the shul. The rabbi says, \"I know how much they disturb the davening, and it is difficult to concentrate and hear the davening and Torah reading with their loud talking. I would love to expel them from the shul, but, if we do that, the shul will lose a tremendous amount of money from them, to the point where we may have to close the shul in 3 months. And, you know that we can't exactly find other members to replace their funding, either or get the funds from the remaining members.\"</p>\n\n<p>Halachically, does the needs of keeping the shul in existence take precedence and MUST they deal with these people disturbing everyone else's kavanah, or should they expel these talkers anyway because the sanctity of the shul and the need to daven with kavanah is more important? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional premises based on comments:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are other shuls in the neighborhood. However, the majority of this shul's membership is comprised of elderly people who have limited walking range, and this shul is about the limit. If the shul closes, they will most likely not attend any shul at all, as the next closest shul is too far for them.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand, there is a general rule to do everything possible to maintain a shul building in existence. The town has strict rules stating that a religious building must be sold only to another religious institution and cannot be sold for residential or commercial purposes. No other shul wants to buy the building, so if the shul closes, it will be sold, most likely, to a church or mosque. I understand that there may be a halacha to try to prevent this, but I may be wrong.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7705&st=&pgnum=162&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aruch Hashulchan Orach Chaim 90:15</a> says that it is better to Daven in a small Minyan where there is no talking over a large Minyan (Losing out on B'rov Am) where there is talking.

The Rambam z\"l discusses these concepts in relative depth in his <em>Moreh HaNavokhim</em> I:25-27 (see there).</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, these <em>kinnuyyim</em> are in effect to help the reader understand that these apparent descriptions of God are actually descriptions of His actions in the world.</p>\n\n<p>What <em>Targum Onqelos</em> communicates through his use of circumlocutions (Heb., <em>kinnuyyim</em>) was eventually expressed in explicit terms and codified by the Rambam as the third foundation of Jewish faith, which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the third foundation is the rejection and negation of all physicality from Him and [to believe] that this One is <strong><em>not a physical body and not a force or power within a physical body</em></strong> and He is unaffected by those accidents which affect physical bodies, such as motion and rest - not actually nor unintentionally. And therefore they [i.e. <em>Hazal</em>], peace be upon them, rejected and negated from Him [any form of] connection or separation. And they said, \"...no sitting and no standing, no decapitation and no joining together\" (cf. <em>Hhaghighah</em> 15a), that is to say, no separation - and this is what is meant by \"decapitation\" - and no connection, for the term \"joining together\" (עפוי) is in the sense of \"<em>wa-`afu va-khathef pelishtim</em> - And they will fly (עפו) upon the shoulder of the Philistines,\" that is to say that they will push them with the shoulder in order to join themselves to them. And the prophet said, \"To whom will you liken God?...and to whom will you compare Me and I will be equal?\" (cf. <em>Yeshayahu</em> 40:18, 25). And if [God] were a physical body then He would be comparable to other physical bodies, and everything which comes in the books [of the <em>Tanakh</em>] that describes Him in terms of physical bodies, such as walking, standing, sitting, speaking, and other similar things, they all by way of metaphor, just as [<em>Hazal</em>] said, \"<em>dibrah Torah ke-lashon benei adham</em> - The Torah speaks according to the language of men\" (cf. <em>Berakhoth</em> 31b). And people have already spoken much about this concept, and this is the third foundation which guides us concerning that which was said, \"<em>ki lo ra'item kol temunah</em> - for you did not see any image\" (cf. <em>Devarim</em> 4:15), that is to say, \"You did not comprehend him as possessing a [physical] image,\" because He is as we have said: <strong><em>Not a physical body, nor a force or power within a physical object</em></strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Rambam, <em>Pirush HaMishnayoth</em>, <em>Sanhedrin</em> 10 - Qafihh Edition pp. קמא-קמב)</p>\n\n<p>[See <em>Mishneh Torah</em>, <em>Hilkhoth Yesodhei HaTorah</em> 1 for a complete and more detailed explanation of the above principle.]</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the ideas that the Creator (blessed be He) is either identical with the creation (גוף - Pantheism) or within the creation (כח בגוף - Panentheism) is precluded by the Torah and <em>Hazal</em>. It is also contradicted by the logic behind pure monotheism (cf. <em>Hhovoth HaLevavoth</em>, <em>Sha`ar HaYihhudh</em> for a full explanation of this idea). Read the <em>Sefer HaKuzari</em>, <em>ma'amar</em> II:1-8 and <em>ma'amar</em> IV for an excellent exposition of these issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Now, to answer your question</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<p>No, the words of <em>Ya`aqov Avinu</em> that \"God is in this place\" does <strong><em>not</em></strong> refer to a physical location of God in any capacity whatsoever. Rather, it is referring to that place being a \"chosen\" (<em>nivhhar</em>; <em>mukhan le-nevu'ah</em>) place for achieving prophecy (cf. <em>Seforno</em>; <em>Ibn Ezra</em> to 28:17; <em>Kuzari</em> II:1-8; et al) - and its potential as a prime place for receiving prophecy was indicated by the angels he saw in his dream, since prophecy comes through the agency of an angel (with the exception of <em>Mosheh Rabbenu alaw ha-shalom</em> who himself was the \"angel\" - cf. <em>Hilkhoth Yeshodhei HaTorah</em> 7-8).</p>\n\n<p>Read this all carefully and you will find your way to understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that this helps.

    "content": "# Can one smooth the rice to make sushi rolls or sashimi on rice on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishpathways.com/files/MandMs_-_Part_2__Memachaik3_Mesarteit3_Mechateich.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article</a> states that one can smoothen food only if it is necessary for eating for not for aesthetic reasons.</p>\n\n<p>I have attended a few Shabbat affairs where a sushi chef makes sushi rolls. To do this, he flattens the rice on the seaweed and then rolls it with the fish using a bamboo mat. Granted, the rice is a necessary part of the food, but I'm wondering if the chef is allowed to manually flatten the rice. If he just leaves a clump and presses the mat around it and the filling, the rice will flatten anyway via the rolling process. If that's the case, it seems that flattening the rice is not an essential part of preparing the food.</p>\n\n<p>The chef also makes plain fish slices on a bed of rice. I see that he takes a ball of rice and flattens it a bit then puts the fish slice on top. This flattening seems to be solely for aesthetic reasons, to me. What would be the problem of just taking a handful of rice in whatever shape it comes put it on a plate and put the fish on top of the clump? Yet, I notice that the chef flattens the rice to make the fish lay on it more nicely. (technically, the chef should be making smaller fish slices!)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Dovid Rabiat is brought in the footnote (#11,12) of your Pathways article as a source for explaining the idea of avoiding the smearing or spreading of foods for simply aesthetic purposes, on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Dovid Rabiat on page 921 and 925, points out that in order to ever violate the law of \"Memarayach\" (smoothing) on Shabbos, one would need to apply lateral action (a smearing spreading motion back and forth) to the substance in question. Simply \"pressing\" the substance vertically, (flattening it or changing its shape) is not \"Memarayach\" at all.</p>\n\n<p>One of his sources for this is Shulchan Aruch 316 with Mishnah Berurah 51. He brings Gemara and other halachic sources which say or show the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the general thing that is to be \"smoothed\" needs to be mushed out of its current hard or pliable shape and change into a spreadable substance. As far as I can tell, this does not happen with rice (being made into sushi). Even if this does happen to the rice slightly as part of the process, since it is incidental and not the aim of the sushi maker, it is permitted.</p>\n\n<p>However, spreading peanut butter, egg salad, icing, etc. is done with a smoothing action. The Magen Avraham (brought down in Shulchan Aruch 321; see Mishnah Berurah with Beur Halachah) says that it is ok to spread cooked apple filling over an area of pastry that is empty of the filling. (This is like spreading peanut butter on a bagel) This is because the apple mush is edible anyway, as is, without the smoothing; and you are presenting the food in its usual way to make a sandwich and eat it. (Furthermore, there is no possible \"D'oraisa\" of \"Memarayach\" with foodstuffs used as food. The only question is if there is a \"D'Rabbanan\" to be applied.)</p>\n\n<p>There is an argument among the poskim if there is a D'rabbanan here if the spreading is purely for aesthetic purposes. It seems that those who forbid rely on the SeMaK. However, the Rema simply says: \"Whoever avoids it, should receive a blessing.\" \"Tavi Alav Brachah.\" Essentially, the Rema is unwilling to forbid, so the lenient opinions rely on the Rema.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the pathways article brings R' Rabiat in its footnote. He actually says that \"it should be avoided\", and there is merely \"a firm basis for Rabbinic restriction to be applied.\" pg. 927-928. His footnote #91 on that spot simply refers the reader to the Rema! (the lenient source!Shulchan Aruch 321:19) R' Rabiat therefore does not forbid it. Your pathways article may be assuming the general stance of the more stringent poskim who apply a D'rabbanan here (at least) to aesthetics. They may be quoting R' Rabiat as a source in English that can better explain the reasoning behind the potential \"issur\".</p>\n\n<p>In addition, shaping the sushi into rounds, would not be \"Boneh\", \"building\" (like making cheese which would be an act of \"Boneh\" because the particles are pressed into a new hard single mass etc.) since the smooth looking rounds are a simple circle shape (as opposed to an animal shape or a tower or sculpture of a person in chopped liver etc.) and lack having the particles pressed into a new single form. It is also not \"Kotev\", \"writing\", since no meaningful symbol or message or image is being formed here. The only thing to worry about is that the rice should not be hot, so it will not cook the raw fish and vegetables, (\"Bishul\", \"Cooking\") and that one cuts the vegetables into thin small pieces before Shabbos. (avoiding \"Tochein\", \"Grinding\")</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, it would seem that it is fine to make sushi on Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does a train conductor have to abandon his train if it is Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Someone I know is a train conductor for the NY subway system. (For unfamiliar readers, this type of conductor does not collect tickets, but opens and closes the doors is the main person responsible for passenger safety - moreso than the train driver.)</p>\n\n<p>Let's say the conductor is working his scheduled route, but the train scheduled is delayed, so that he is still on the train when Shabbat arrives. AFAIK, the MTA does not have a means where the conductor can request a substitute to take over mid-route. The assigned conductor must complete his route. If the conductor abandons the train, not only will the train not continue to operate, but passenger safety may be risked. (In NYC, people anger somewhat easily, fights occur on the subway; people get sick on the train, etc. need more ideas?)</p>\n\n<p>Trains are placed out of service if there is a mechanical problem, the train itself is unsafe, or there is civil unrest on the train and it becomes more feasible to transfer passengers to another train. I don't think the MTA allows conductor religious practice as a reason to place a train out of service.</p>\n\n<p>Must the conductor leave the train or does he have to complete the route to maintain passenger safety?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Agree with DoubleAA's comment. Abandoning his post could seriously risk life or limb. There's also the halachic concept of <em>hezeka de-rabim</em>, public safety. When it comes to the public (and this is the public), the thresholds are lowered for both probability and degree of damage that may ensue.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Benny Lau spoke of some case involving a gas leak in his town. He said without <em>melacha</em> being done they could have simply evacuated the area, but it was allowable to break Shabbos to fix the problem, as it was a matter of public safety.</p>\n\n<p>If he can <em>safely</em> do his job just as effectively with a <em>shinui</em> (e.g. pushing buttons with his knuckle), that's better; but safety is absolutely priority #1.</p>\n\n\n",

On the other hand, you would not need as tall a doorpost since the Ashkenazic custom is to place it at shoulder height if the doorway is very tall (see Shach 289:4 based on Yerushalmi; in contrast, see also Yalkut Yosef YD 285:77 who does not rule differently for tall doorways). See: <a href=\"http://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Mezuzah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Mezuzah</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bbeFq.jpg\" alt=\"Tall doorway\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>See <em>Rashi Menachoth</em> 33a s.v. “<em>b'techila</em>,” <em>Rambam Hilchoth Mezuzah</em> 6:12, <em>Tur</em> 289, <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 289:2</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0010_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן יא - הלכות מזוזה</a> says that a Mezuza must be placed in the upper 3rd of the doorpost, but at least a Tefach (about 8 cm, 3\") away from the lintel.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>סעיף ה':</strong> \n  מְקוֹמָהּ מִתְּחִלַּת שְׁלִישׁ הָעֶלְיוֹן שֶׁל גֹּבַהּ הַשָּׁעַר. קְבָעָהּ לְמַעְלָה מִזֶּה, כְּשֵׁרָה, וְהוּא שֶׁיַּרְחִיקֶנָּה מִן הַמַּשְׁקוֹף טֶפַח. קְבָעָהּ לְמַטָּה מִשְּׁלִישׁ הָעֶלְיוֹן, צָרִיךְ לַהֲסִירָהּ וּלְקָבְעָהּ כָּרָאוּי וּבִבְרָכָה. וְאִם קְבָעָהּ בְּטֶפַח הָעֶלְיוֹן, יְסִירָה גַּם כֵּן וְיִקְבְּעֶהָ כָּרָאוּי, אֲבָל לֹא יְבָרֵךְ.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if the doorway is high enough, a tall Mezuza can be used. In this case, the doorpost would have to be about 5.70m (over 18 feet) tall. Such doors <a href=\"https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090326172601AAXTrbX\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">do exist, in Cape Canaveral</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, the article is misleading, as it's not referring to a Mezuza, but a Mezuza-<strong>case</strong>. How to write a Kosher Mezuza that would be that tall, is unclear to me - unless the Sofer uses very, very large margins on top and below the writing. (A Mezuza is traditionally written on 22 lines; so (without monster margins) you're looking at letters about 4cm - 1.5\" tall, since the space between the lines should be the same height as the letters. Try using a 108-point font to see what I'm referring to, then try find a quill or feather large enough to write that.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/88Qhp.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud (R' Yitzchak in the name of R' Yochanan in the name of R' Yose ben R' Chanina in the name of R' Eliezer ben Ya'akov) applies this to someone who eats and drinks before prayers, as if HaShem remarks, \"After this one has acted haughtily, he accepts upon himself the dominion of Heaven?\"</i></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The topic of the question is not entirely covered by the Gemara quoted in OP. An important machloket between Rashi and Tosfot, well illustrated by Rabenu Yona on daf 5b must be included. I will try to answer the OP through Gemara and Poskim. If I am wrong, every criticism should be accepted and I will consider to modify the answer.</p>\n\n<h3>Two different topics.</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The first, Gaava, as mentioned in the OP, is prohibited as an offense. This topic is mentioned in the title of the OP. It concerns activities which are not Avodat Hashem.</p></li>\n<li><p>the second,  non prayer activities , including Torah study before prayer, as a lack of readiness/risk to miss the starting  of prayer.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>We'll star by the second topic.</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h3>Gemara Berachot 5b:</h3>\n  \n  <p>תניא, אבא בנימין אומר: על שני דברים הייתי מצטער כל ימי - על תפלתי שתהא לפני מטתי...‏  לא תימא לפני מטתי, אלא אימא: סמוך למטתי. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>It has been taught: Abba Benjamin says, All my life I took great pains about two things: that my prayer should be before my bed ... etc...  Do not read 'before my bed', but 'near my bed.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Rashi:</h3>\n  \n  <p>סמוך למטתי. כל ימי נזהרתי שלא לעשות מלאכה ושלא לעסוק בתורה כשעמדתי ממטתי עד שאקרא ק''ש ואתפלל: ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>... I have been careful to not work and not study Tora when I got up until I say KS and pray.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Talmide Rabenu Yona on Rif:</h3>\n  \n  <p>ומיירי בתפילת שחרית שאין לו לעשות שום מלאכה קודם שיתפלל... וכו' ... ורש\"י ז\"ל פירש דהיה נזהר דאפילו לקרות בתורה לא היה רוצה אחר שעלה עמוד השחר עד שיתפלל. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara talk about the morning prayer,  that one should  not make any work before this prayer. Rashi explained that he (Abba  Binyamin) did pay attention not to read Tora after the early morning dawn. </p>\n  \n  <p>ואומרים רבני צרפת ז\"ל שלא מצינו בשום מקום שהלימוד יהא אסור. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>But French Rabbis say that we don't found in any teaching that learning is prohibited. </p>\n  \n  <p>ואפילו לדברי רש\"י ז\"ל אין לאוסרו אלא כשלומד לעצמו מפני שיכול להתפלל תחילה ולחזור ללמודו אחר כך.  ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Even according to   Rashi, the  prohibition concerns only a man who learn alone,  because there is no problem to pray first and go back to his study afterwards. </p>\n  \n  <p>אבל במי שמלמד לאחרים ודאי מותר כיון שהשעה עוברת דזכות הרבים דבר גדול הוא ואם לא ילמדו עכשיו יתבטלו ולא יוכלו ללמוד אחר כך. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>But for one who teaches others,  it is obviously permitted because this time is not recoverable.  To give credit to people is  something big. If they would not learn now their learning would be  annulled, they  would not be able to learn afterwards. </p>\n  \n  <p>שכן מצינו לרבינו הקדוש ז\"ל שהיה מלמד לתלמידיו וכשהיה מגיע זמן ק\"ש היה מעביר ידיו (דף י\"ג עמוד ב) על גבי עיניו וקורא ק\"ש וחוזר ללימודו. ואחר כך היה מתפלל ולא היה חושש אף על פי שהיה מגיע התחלת זמן התפילה. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>We found a such case with Rabenu Hakadosh of blessed memory,  who was teaching his students,  and when the time of kriat shema started,  he was read kriat  shema and continue to learn. Afterwards he was praying without concern for the staring time of Tefila. </p>\n  \n  <p>ולא חיישינן שמא ישכח ותעבור השעה כיון שהתפילה דרך הוא להתפלל אותה בכל יום יתן אל לבו הדבר ויזכור ויתפלל.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>There is no concern that he does not  remember and until the end of tefila time because tefla is a quotidian habit. He surely would  remember it. </p>\n  \n  <h3>Shulchan Aruch OC 89, 6</h3>\n  \n  <p>אֲפִלּוּ לִלְמֹד אָסוּר מִשֶּׁיַּגִּיעַ זְמַן תְּפִלָּה, וְהַיְנוּ מִי שֶׁרָגִיל לְהִתְפַּלֵּל בְּבֵית מִדְרָשׁוֹ, וְאֵינוֹ רָגִיל לֵילֵךְ לְבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת, דְּאִכָּא לְמֵיחַשׁ דִּלְמָא מַטְרִיד בְּגִרְסֵיהּ וְיַעֲבֹר זְמַן קְרִיאַת שְׁמַע וּתְפִלָּה. אֲבָל מִי שֶׁרָגִיל לֵילֵךְ לְבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת, מֻתָּר. וְאִם הוּא מְלַמֵּד לַאֲחֵרִים, אֲפִלּוּ אִם אֵינוֹ רָגִיל לֵילֵךְ לְבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת, מֻתָּר, כֵּיוָן שֶׁהַשָּׁעָה עוֹבֶרֶת, דִּזְכוּת הָרַבִּים דָּבָר גָּדוֹל הוּא. וְאִם לֹא יִלְמְדוּ עַכְשָׁו יִתְבַּטְּלוּ, וְלֹא יוּכְלוּ לִלְמֹד וע''ל סי' ק''ו. ‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>Even to study is prohibited at the starting  of prayer's time.

Thus one may not \" pray berachot\" but tefilat haamida for \"achsre geecha\". </p></li>\n<li><p>Shulchan Aruch did not refer to the  kula of the Terumat Hadashen.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If an individual who rises BEFORE ALOS? a person may clearly recite certain tefillos starting at alos, but if it is still completely \"night\" by all measures? Let's say a person goes tobed after ma'ariv but rises at 2AM - what can/should he do considering that it is impossible to engage in the normal morning routines of tefilla? \nPoskim clearly stated that he  may make anything up to alot, even eating.\n When the hour of Alot came, the problem begin to apply. So, it is possible to make anything before alot, following some interpretations on the Terumat Hadeshen words, that Birkot hashachar is sufficient to solve the problem. But the original purpose of the Trumat hadeshen is not Achare Gevecha, but the problem of Gemara daf 5b. I hope that this answer helps.</p>\n\n\n",

If I wanted to wear one of the shirts now, it would still be \"freshly\" cleaned in the sense that it hasn't been worn since it was washed, but not \"freshly\" cleaned in the sense that it was done recently. What if the shirts hadn't been worn after being laundered in March or even September? Is there a time limit to the idea of \"freshly laundered\" or is it strictly a function of \"not having been worn\"?</p>\n\n<p>Since there is at least one other way of making clothes \"not freshly washed\" without wearing them (by laying them on the floor, even without trampling on them - Shulchan Aruch w/Mishnah Berurah 551:3, Piskei Tshuvos 551:17), could 'time elapsed' constitute a valid way to make clothes wearable? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yalkut Yosef English Ta'aniyot 206.116 (see note there also) defines no longer freshly laundered as wearing for an hour.

If in each case the tallis katan is the same length, why is there opinion that holds that the neck must be closed, or on the other hand, may be open?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My Rav, R' Shimshon Yeshaya Adler (Monsey NY), told me that the very large hole/long slit may completely invalidate the <em>tallis'</em> as it renders it unfit as a proper covering of the body. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/30238/3073\">The Torah only required a garment that is of size one will use it to go into a marketplace.</a> Just as it is possible that today's short jackets permit short <em>talleisim ketanim</em>, one could reason that today when it is normal to wear a shirt with several of the top buttons undone, revealing the chest, so too an equally deeply slitted <em>tallis katan</em> would be acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>A completely different reason for a small round opening is to prevent the <em>tallis katan</em> from creeping up over the shoulders and onto the back. </p>\n\n\n",

He became terrible to all men, by tearing and rending those that came near him; and all this in order to raise himself, and out of an ambitious desire of the royal dignity, for he hoped to obtain that as the reward not of his virtuous skill in war, but of his extravagance in doing injuries.\n  [Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 17.271-272]\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Simon of Peraea (4 BCE)</p>\n\n<p>Sources: Flavius Josephus, Jewish War 2.57-59 and Jewish Antiquities 17.273-277; Tacitus, Histories, 5.9.</p>\n\n<p>Story: In 4 BCE, king Herod the Great died.

For only thus, in John's opinion, would the baptism he administered be acceptable to God, namely, if they used it to obtain not pardon for some sins but rather the cleansing of their bodies, inasmuch as it was taken for granted that their souls had already been purified by justice.</p>\n  \n  <p>[18.118] Now many people came in crowds to him, for they were greatly moved by his words. Herod, who feared that the great influence John had over the masses might put them into his power and enable him to raise a rebellion (for they seemed ready to do anything he should advise), thought it best  to put him to death. In this way, he might prevent any mischief John might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties by sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it would be too late.</p>\n  \n  <p>[18.119] Accordingly John was sent as a prisoner, out of Herod's suspicious temper, to Macherus, the castle I already mentioned, and was put to death.

Its leader was Judas the Galilean, and when the high priest Joazar had shown himself incapable of overcoming the rebellion, the governor of adjacent Syria interfered and conducted the census. This was Publius Sulpicius Quirinius, well known from the census mentioned in the Gospel of Luke (2.2).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There was one Judas, a Galilean, of a city whose name was Gamala, who, taking with him Zadok, a Pharisee, became zealous to draw them to a revolt. </p>\n  \n  <p>They also said that God would not otherwise be assisting to them, than upon their joining with one another in such councils as might be successful, and for their own advantage; and this especially, if they would set about great exploits, and not grow weary in executing the same. So men received what they said with pleasure, and this bold attempt proceeded to a great height.\n  [Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 18.4-6]</p>\n  \n  <p>Judas the Galilean was the author of the fourth branch of Jewish philosophy. These men agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions; but they have an inviolable attachment to liberty, and say that God is to be their only Ruler and Lord. They also do not value dying any kinds of death, nor indeed do they heed the deaths of their relations and friends, nor can any such fear make them call any man lord.\n  [Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 18.23]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Comment: This 'fourth branch of Jewish philosophy' is called Zealotism; the other three sects were the Sadducees, Essenes and Pharisees. Flavius Josephus hated the Zealots.  It is unclear what happened exactly. For instance, we do not know whether Judas conducted military operations or was merely the intellectual leader of the revolt. However, the revolt is absent from the catalogue of armed interventions by the Syrian governor of the Roman historian Tacitus (Histories, 5.9); Quirinius' measures were probably harsh, but not military in nature. Josephus does not tell us what became of Judas, but the author of the Acts of the apostles tells us that he perished by the sword.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some time ago, Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered.\n  [Luke, Acts of the apostles 5.36-37]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a quotation from a discussion among the Jewish leaders about Jesus. We know that both Jesus and Theudas, together with Judas' (grand)son Menahem, were called Messiahs, and this makes it extremely likely that this title was given to Judas too. An additional argument is that Judas made a bid for national independence, something that was expected from the Messiah. In about 47, Judas' sons Jacob and Simon were arrested and crucified by governor Tiberius Julius Alexander.</p>\n\n<p>Note:  See also Menahem, below.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Samaritan prophet (36 CE)</p>\n\n<p>Source: Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 18.85-87.</p>\n\n<p>Story: In 36 CE, the governor of Judaea, Pontius Pilate, was confronted with a serious rebellion in Samaria.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For a man who made light of mendacity and in all his designs catered to the mob, rallied them, bidding them go in a body with him to Mount Gerizim, which in their belief is the most sacred of mountains. He assured them that on their arrival he would show them the sacred vessels which were buried there, where Moses had deposited them. His hearers, viewing this tale as plausible, appeared in arms. \n  [Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 18.85-87]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>King Herod Agrippa (44 CE)</p>\n\n<p>Sources: Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 19.338-353 and the Acts of the apostles 1219b-23.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>King Herod went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there. And he was highly displeased with those from Tyre and Sidon. But they came with one accord to him and, having made Blastus (the king's chamberlain) their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was nourished by the king's country. And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne and delivered an oration unto them. And the people gave a shout, saying, 'It is the voice of a god, and not of a man!' And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory; and he was eaten by worms and gave up the ghost.\n  [Luke, Acts of the apostles 12.19b-23]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This was the story according to Luke, the author of the Acts of the apostles; he seems to delight in the terrible end of the man who had prosecuted the first Christians. The same story is told by Flavius Josephus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now when Agrippa had reigned three years over all Judea... his flatterers cried out [...] that he was a god; and they added, 'Be thou merciful to us; for although we have hitherto reverenced thee only as a man, yet shall we henceforth own thee as superior to mortal nature.' </p>\n  \n  <p>Upon this the king did neither rebuke them, nor reject their impious flattery. But as he presently afterward looked up, he saw an owl sitting on a certain rope over his head, and immediately understood that this bird was the messenger of ill tidings, as it had once been the messenger of good tidings to him; and he fell into the deepest sorrow. A severe pain also arose in his belly, and began in a most violent manner. He therefore looked upon his friends, and said, 'I, whom you call a god, am commanded presently to depart this life; while Providence thus reproves the lying words you just now said to me; and I, who was by you called immortal, am immediately to be hurried away by death. But I am bound to accept of what Providence allots, as it pleases God; for we have by no means lived ill, but in a splendid and happy manner.' \n  [Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 19.343-350]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Theudas (about 45 CE)</p>\n\n<p>Sources: Flavius Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 20.97-98 and Acts of the apostles 5.36. </p>\n\n<p>Story: Between 44 and 46 CE, one Theudas, about whom Josephus is predictably negative, caused some consternation with what may have been a claim to be the Messiah.</p>\n\n<p>Theudas led his followers in a short-lived revolt.

Now when Felix was informed of these things, he ordered his soldiers to take their weapons, and came against them with a great number of horsemen and footmen from Jerusalem, and attacked the Egyptian and the people that were with him.

He may have been his grandson. His ministry took place at the beginning of the war against the Romans, when the Jews had not yet expelled their enemies from Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the mean time, one Menahem, the son of that Judas [see above, Judas the Galilean], who was called the Galilean [...] took some of the men of note with him, and retired to Masada, where he broke open king Herod's armory, and gave arms not only to his own people, but to other robbers also. These he made use of for a guard, and returned in the state of a king to Jerusalem; he became the leader of the sedition. (Flavius Josephus, Jewish War 2.433-434)</p>\n  \n  <p>After this, Menahem captured the governor's palace at Jerusalem, laid siege to some minor Roman fortifications and ordered the execution of the high priest. He was now the only leader of the Jewish revolt, and could boast remarkable successes. However, the son of the high priest, Eleasar, was the leader of the temple guard and Menahem's deadly enemy.</p>\n  \n  <p>The overthrow of the places of strength, and the death of the high priest Ananias, so puffed up Menahem, that he became barbarously cruel; and as he thought he had no antagonist to dispute the management of affairs with him, he was no better than an insupportable tyrant. But Eleasar and his party [...] made an assault upon him in the temple, for he went up thither to worship in a pompous manner, and adorned with royal garments, and had his followers with him in their armor. \n  [Flavius Josephus, Jewish War 2.442-448]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Vespasian (67 CE)</p>\n\n<p>Sources: Cassius Dio, Roman History, 65=66.1.4, 65=66.8.1; Flavius Josephus, Jewish War 3.399-404 and 6.310-315; Suetonius, Life of Vespasian 4.5; Tacitus, Annals, 15.47; Tacitus, Histories, 5.13; Zonaras, Epitome 11.16.</p>\n\n<p>Story: The Roman general Vespasian, who attacked the Jews, may seem an odd candidate for a Messiah, but nonetheless, his coup d'état in 70 was regarded as the fulfillment of the famous Balaam-prophecy that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a star shall come out of Jacob and a scepter will rise out of Israel. It shall crush the foreheads of Moab and break down all the sons of Sheth. Edom shall be dispossessed. (Numbers 24.17-19)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There were two comets. One appeared in late 64 (Tacitus, Annals, 15.47), the other, in 69, is mentioned by Cassius Dio (Roman History, 65=66.1.4). Most people thought that the new ruler would be the liberator of Israel, but Flavius Josephus claims to have found the true meaning of the prophecy.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What did the most to induce the Jews to start this war, was an ambiguous oracle that was also found in their sacred writings, how, about that time, one from their country should become governor of the habitable earth. The Jews took this prediction to belong to themselves in particular, and many of the wise men were thereby deceived in their determination. Now this oracle certainly denoted the government of Vespasian, who was appointed emperor in Judea. (Flavius Josephus, Jewish War 6.312-313)</p>\n  \n  <p>There had spread over all the Orient an old and established belief, that it was fated for men coming from Judaea to rule the world. This prediction, referring to the emperor of Rome -as afterwards appeared from the event- the people of Judaea took to themselves. (Suetonius, Life of Vespasian 4.5)</p>\n  \n  <p>The majority [of the Jews] were convinced that the ancient scriptures of their priests alluded to the present as the very time when the Orient would triumph and from Judaea would go forth men destined to rule the world. This mysterious prophecy really referred to Vespasian and Titus, but the common people, true to the selfish ambitions of mankind, thought that this exalted destiny was reserved for them, and not even their calamities opened their eyes to the truth. (Tacitus, Histories 5.13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>John of Gischala (67-70 CE)</p>\n\n<p>Source: Flavius Josephus, Jewish War books 2-6.</p>\n\n<p>Story: John of Gischala was a personal enemy of Flavius Josephus: in the first stages of the war against the Romans, they had both commanded Jewish armies in northern Galilee. After the Romans had conquered these parts, John and his six thousand men went south, where he managed to control most of Jerusalem and appointed a high priest, a man named Phannias. According to Flavius Josephus, John behaved like a tyrant or despot, which probably may be decoded as a kingly rule. This caused heavy tensions with the Zealots, who occupied the Temple and accepted no other lord than the Lord; John solved the problem with the sword. When Titus had captured Jerusalem, John surrendered. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. </p>\n\n<p>Josephus abhors from John's...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>impiety towards God. For he had unlawful food served at his table and abandoned the established rules of purity of our forefathers\n  [Flavius Josephus, Jewish War 7.264]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which also suggests that John of Gischala was not a particularly pious man. But it is possible that Josephus is simply slandering his former enemy.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Simon bar Giora (69-70 CE)</p>\n\n<p>Source: Flavius Josephus, Jewish War books 4-7.</p>\n\n<p>Story: As a leader of the Jewish revolt against Rome, the Idumean Simon bar Giora was the most important rival of John of Gischala. He was a very competent general who attracted some forty thousand soldiers, promising 'liberty for slaves and rewards for the free', a political program that was sufficient to incur the hate of the conservative Flavius Josephus. The Idumean was invited by that part of the population of Jerusalem that feared the power of John; he entered the city in the spring of 69. There, he ruled as a king, until he was forced to surrender to the Romans:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Simon, thinking he might be able to astonish and elude the Romans, put on a white frock, and buttoned upon him a purple cloak, and appeared out of the ground in the place where the temple had formerly been. At the first, indeed, those that saw him were greatly astonished, and stood still where they were; but afterward they came nearer to him, and asked him who he was. \n  [Flavius Josephus, Jewish War 7.26-32]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.livius.org/men-mh/messiah/messiah00.html#overview\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here</a> is a list of a number of people who made the claim.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.livius.org/men-mh/messiah/messianic_claimants09.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here</a> is some info on historical records of one earlier claimant. </p>\n\n<p>The linked website quotes this text from Josephus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There was an Egyptian false prophet that did the Jews more mischief than the former; for he was a cheat, and pretended to be a prophet also, and got together thirty thousand men that were deluded by him; these he led round about from the wilderness to the mount which was called the Mount of Olives.

Idolatry can take many forms, say egotistical lust for power, worshipping money, pursuing immorality, or seeking self-centered honor because you are carving out a space devoid of Hashem.

In fact,\n  perhaps it is more prevalent now than ever. The Akeidah says that\n  today's 'Avodah Zarah' is devoting all of one's time to amassing\n  wealth and property. When the pasuk says \"Do not make with Me, gods of\n  silver and gods of gold for yourselves\" [20:20], it does not just mean\n  little idols that one bows down to three times a day! It means do not\n  make money -- gold and silver -- into a god.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is the same Avodah Zarah, says the Akeidah al HaTorah. For many,\n  Gold and Silver Are mighty gods, upon whom people put their faith and\n  credibility</p>\n  \n  <p>To one extent or another we all face this test. It is not true --\n  Avodah Zarah has not been nullified. Unfortunately, it is alive and\n  well among us.

Usually, that reason is of the form, \"If I had known XYZ, I never would have taken that oath!\" The 9th perek of <em>Masechet Nedarim</em> discusses annulling vows using the reason that something happened after the oath was taken which, had the person who swore known it would happen, he wouldn't have sworn in the first place. The halacha is that such an oath cannot be annulled for that reason. The XYZ must have been the <em>metzius</em> <strong>at the time of the vow</strong>, but simply unknown to the oath-taker in order for it to be a valid reason to annul the <em>neder</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Following that reasoning, if the reason the tribes wanted to ask for annulment of their vow was because they did not know that Benjamin would be mostly wiped out in the future, that would be insufficient reason to annul their vow since Benjamin was not decimated at the time of the vow.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Malbim says that they could not release their oath since they had an alternative solution which was the scenario that they enacted.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Another reason could also be that whatever bais din that they could choose would have been nogeiah badavar (involved in the matter) and therefore would not have been able to paskin. Since every tribe <strong>as a tribe</strong> had made the oath, they could not find dayanim to be matir the neder. As a result, they had to find people who were not subject to the vow and follow the method that they did.</p>\n\n<p>Note that @Salomonius2 pointed out that they were also nogeiah bedavar because of the neder included what to do to someone who refused to join in. Also the fear of being included in being considered worthy of being attacked by the rest of Bnei Yisrael. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Making a siyum and eating meat during the 9 days\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It's brought down in Halacha that if one makes a siyum during the 9 days they may eat meat. A person happens to have a siyum coming out now in the 9 days (he is only one daf away.) However not every siyum he eats meat. Some siyumim he makes by himself without a \"celebration\" and an official seudah, while other siyumim he makes on Shabbos (specially for the reason that he is anyway eating meat then and having a seudah that it would be nice to use to celebrate the siyum instead of doing it special during the week when he may not make such a big seudah with meat.) In short this person sometimes does make a seudah with meat for his siyum and sometimes not. May he make the siyum now during the 9 days and serve a meat seudah to his family?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kof-k.org/articles/040208030401W-36%20Making%20a%20Siyum.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This Kof-K article</a> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When one finishes a mesechta, there is a mitzvah to be joyous over the\n  occasion. The simcha is so great that some poskim say one should\n  mention simcha b’meono at the siyum. (The minhag is not to say it).\n  The Yam Shel Shlomo says there is no greater simcha or mitzvah that\n  is done before Hashem than the simcha and mitzvah of finishing a\n  portion of Torah. The poskim say since there is such great simcha at a\n  siyum, even if people did not finish the mesechta they should still\n  partake in the siyum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, IF you are finishing the masechta, there is a mitzvah to make a siyum. If you make a siyum, there is a mitzvah of <em>simcha</em>, and that simcha is enhanced via eating meat. (<em>En SImcha Ela Basar</em> - don't recall, offhand the source of this, but will try to edit later.) Furthermore, the above quote states that even those who did not complete the masechta can join in the <em>siyum</em> and eat meat. In short, there is nothing implied here regarding what your previous custom or habit was. </p>\n\n<p>Despite this, though, the same article, later on, says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If one was not planning on making a siyum during the nine days, he\n  should not hasten the learning in order to finish it during this\n  time. Some are lenient with this. However, one should act in\n  accordance with the first opinion mentioned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your question implies that he was planning a siyum, anyway. It's just a question of can he serve meat?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As you assert correctly halocho allows for a person to make a meaty siyum, namely a seudas mitzvah during this period and anyone connected to the siyum may participate - refer to the Rema in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.551.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Oruch OC 551:10</a>.

A better way to start would be to ask what did the ancient tribe(s) consider appropriate methods to communicate with and worship their specific ancestral G-d, who led their forefather Avraham out of Mesopotamia? The book of Bereshit is the primary source of evidence (considerably more detailed than the few short inscriptions discovered by archaeologists). It describes the Patriarchs erecting sacred pillars and trees (e.g. Ber. 21:33, 28:18, 35:14), like their neighbors. In addition, when Yaacov discovered idols (clearly related to the worship of different gods), he buried them (35:1-5), suggesting that other gods and their cultic objects were distinct and not acceptable, yet he did not destroy them as Moshe later required (Dvar. 7:5, 25; 12:3). All this indicates that the tribe did not accept other gods besides G-d, yet at the same time there was not a complete break with the religious practices of the surrounding peoples.</p>\n\n<p>2) Bear in mind that a number of different tribal groups throughout Syria/Canaan worshipped various deities with names such as El, El Shaddai, El Eloah, El Olam, etc. <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ns4UAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA3&dq=el%20inscriptions%20ugarit&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMI4rGqiuz-xgIVywjbCh1eOwpx#v=onepage&q=el%20inscriptions%20ugarit&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">The name \"El\" has been found in Northwest Semitic inscriptions</a> of Phoenecians, Hurrians, and Ugarites, referring to a supreme god. The Patriarchs worshipped at a variety of these local shrines and sought oracles from them, alongside the inhabitants (e.g. Ber. 12:6, 31:13, 35:7, 21:33, 14:13). Avraham even gave tribute to Melchitzedek, a priest of El Elyon (14:18-20). There is no indication that they, or the text of Bereshit, considered that these were shrines to foreign gods, but rather were all part of a similar religio-cultural zone that also directed worship to G-d.  </p>\n\n<p>3) The Yisraelim in Mitzrayim are described as having distinct religious beliefs to the Egyptian majority (Shem. 4:30-31, 5:2-3).</p>\n\n<p>4) Modern scholarly views tend to consider parts of the book of Shoftim <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?id=SNFMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA523&dq=The%20Oxford%20Encyclopedia%20of%20the%20Books%20of%20the%20Bible%20523&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMI1PDat-v-xgIVyprbCh1WSgLJ#v=onepage&q=The%20Oxford%20Encyclopedia%20of%20the%20Books%20of%20the%20Bible%20523&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">the oldest extant text</a> of the Tana'k, rather than the Chumash. Considering this book on its own (assuming no Exodus etc), the society described does appear polytheistic (2:11-23) yet side by side with that are descriptions of wars and political oppression attributed to that very polytheism, suggesting ambivalence towards the practice, at best.</p>\n\n<p>5) The words for 'god' are often used loosely: they were also applied to particularly powerful/blessed/important people (Shem. 7:1; 21:6, 22:7-8; 1 Sam. 28:13; Teh. 45:6, 82:1). (This appears in much later texts too, where other people, such as Henoch [Heikhalot, 3 Henoch] and Rashbi [Zohar 1:223a; 3:59b, 201b] are described as 'HASHEM'/'G-d'.) These designations do not signify that the Yisraelim actually worshipped these people/entities as deities. </p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, if the boss needs the work done, and this employee can effectively perform this work, he must be kept on the payroll.

At that time the twelve tribes of the Israelites on terrestrial earth corresponded to their exact counterparts in the celestial spheres (Zohar Bamidbar 118). If one tribe would have sold part of its ancestral territory to another, the result would have been an imbalance of the forces representing the tribes in the celestial regions. Once the people had settled in Eretz Yisrael which is the terrestrial counterpart of the sum total of all these celestial forces of the tribes, this did not matter anymore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once everyone received their inheritance and everything was permanently set it didn't matter if it would be transferred later.</p>\n\n<p>Also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.36.7?lang=en&p2=Ramban_on_Numbers.36.7.1&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see the Ramban there for another answer.</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I. Why was the decree only for the generation that entered the land?</p>\n\n<p>Baal Hatur Bm.25:5 sites the word (יִנְחָלוּ-inherit) and elaborates that this word is mentioned 3 times in TNH. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Bm.25:5 - according to his inheritance that they shall inherit.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bm.26:55 - according to the names of their fathers' tribes shall they inherit.</p></li>\n<li><p>Pr.3:35 - The wise shall inherit honor.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Tur states in connection to these 3 passages:  Regarding that which they shall inherit, shall be according to the names of their father's tribes that they shall inherit, for the land was apportioned to those who went forth from Mizraim and died... </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Baba Batra 117a: Rabbi Yonatan says: Eretz Yisrael was divided among those who entered Eretz Yisrael, as it is stated: “Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance” (Bm 26:53). But how do I realize the meaning of the verse: “According to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit” (Bm 26:55)? This teaches that this inheritance is different from all other inheritances in the world, for in all other inheritances in the world, the living inherit from the dead, but here, the dead inherit from the living. {In other words, the portions of land received by those who entered Eretz Yisrael were transferred to their fathers who left Egypt, and then inherited by the current generation, as the Gemara will explain.} <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.117a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">117a</a></p>\n\n<p>The reason for this nuance in my opinion is for the initial promise to Abraham in (Br.12.7:  The LORD appeared to Abram and said, “I will assign this land to your offspring.” And he built an altar there to the LORD who had appeared to him.)  Is defining that the offspring of Abraham will inherit the land, the only question is what that \"offspring\" really mean.  This is to some point defined in (Br.21.12:  But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed over the boy or your slave; whatever Sarah tells you, do as she says, for it is through Isaac that offspring shall be continued for you.)</p>\n\n<p>It is also important that the language of the Torah throughout the Parasha Masei is Bnei Israel (the males), therefore it can be established that it is critical that the males are the ones that inherited.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore you see that the initial inheritance was not a commandment, but HSM holding his promise to Abraham, Itzhak and Yaakov.  But once the inheritance is established and the land is conquered and acquired (as needed to qualify for a possession) then there are specific mitzvot from the Torah on how things now need to be handled in cases of inheritance and possession of the land. </p>\n\n<p>II. Why is a female heiress allowed to marry out of the tribe?</p>\n\n<p>There was never a restriction for marriage out of the tribe, only a one time decree set for the initial inheritance of the land.  The reason being, the legitimate plea of the daughters of Zelophehad: \"Why should our father lose out because he has no sons\" (referencing Baba Batra 117a).  In addition, the tribe of Menashe also had a legitimate argument, why should they lose the portion of their tribal land to another tribe when it belongs to them (referencing \"offspring according to the names of the fathers' tribes\".) And if the daughters marry out, they don't even have the chance to \"redeem it\" so to say.  The solution for the daughters of Zelophehad seems to be infringing on the possession of the Tribe.  Therefore, HaKadosh Barkhu put a restriction for these daughters to only marry within the tribe. A seemingly fair compromise to both parties.  </p>\n\n<p>The concept of redemption can be see in Ruth 4.4:   [I thought I should disclose the matter to you and say: Acquire it in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you are willing to redeem it, redeem! But if you will not redeem, tell me, that I may know. For there is no one to redeem but you, and I come after you.” “I am willing to redeem it,” he replied.] </p>\n\n<p>III. The Maharsha (Chidushei Aggadot BB 121A) (Discussing the holiday of the 15th of Av) asks what is the joy of the tribes being able to intermarry, if this could result in lost land.?</p>\n\n<p>(added from comments:)  Take a real life example from sefer Ruth:</p>\n\n<p>Elimelech a rich man with much land lost his life due to his own sins.  His possessions transfer to his living sons (his guarantors). Mahlon and Chilion died early due to their own sins, and lost all possessions.  They however had no sons and no more brothers to perform Yibum. Their \"names\" are lost forever since they didn't guard this mitzvah properly of having children. Now since all of Am-Yisrael are guarantors for one another, it trickles down the \"family\" tree. </p>\n\n<p>The possessions now belong to Naomi, and the family of Elimelech now have the status of potential redeemers. Tov refused to redeem, Boaz the last relative acts as the redeemer and states Ruth 4.10: I also acquire the wife of Machlon as my wife to perpetuate the name of the deceased on his inheritance, that the name no be cut off ... Now what would happen if Boaz also refused or as in the case where the entire tribe doesn't redeem? The real loss are to those to whom the original inheritance belonged to. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore it seems to me that life is more important than land and the purpose of inheritance as the word itself implies is to perpetuate the name of the deceased. Indeed this should be something to celebrate, both in not restricting the daughters from marrying whom they want and the inheritance transferring over to a different tribe.  Since all of Am Yisrael are guarantors for one another, it is not that the land was lost, but that the name of the deceased was not cut off from his people, which remains on the possessions that he leaves in this world, in this case land.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>As an answer one can say like this.</p>\n\n<p>But first one must ask: What is wrong with woman inheriting?<br/>\nWhy was Moshe Rabainu unsure about it?<br/>\nWhat is so 'surprising' that the women 'wanted' the land who wouldn't?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is the Erets Yisroel comes at a price. It has a kedusha which has to be kept. Moshe was not sure that women were up to it.<br/>\nHashem answered they were, but he added a condition that it must be 'bsoch achaihem', together with their brothers in the tribe with the men, not on their own.</p>\n\n<p>So therefore if they married 'out' they would not be doing it with 'their brothers' since the land they would inherit would pass out of the tribe.</p>\n\n<p>One can say that this stipulation of Hashem only applied when the original kedusha of the land had to be applied. When they conquered it from Canaan.</p>\n\n<p>Once it was holy already, then a daughter could do it on her own without her tribe and therefore no reason not to marry out.</p>\n\n\n",

He paskened that potato chips were bishul akum and he advised members of his kehillah to cover them with ketchup and reheat them in the oven.  I never understood this.  If the chips were bishul akum then putting them into the oven would make the oven traif.  Nevertheless, this is how he paskened.

The only place where one could entertain introducing a leniency would be where the food truly reverted to its original, uncooked state (which, by <em>hilchot shabbat</em> is a potential concern by liquids such as water) but if indeed the cooling off does regain the food a permitted status, reheating it again would not be the catalyst of that change. This is also the reasoning in the reverse case you link since the issue is who originally rendered it fit for consumption.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, it <em>is</em> considered a <em>tashmish kedusha</em> with all the attendant restrictions, such as requiring \"<em>sheimos geniza</em>\" as well as a prohibition banning it's use for a less sacred function.

    "content": "# Does a minor's siyum allow one to eat meat in the nine days?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Ashk'nazim</em> do not eat meat or drink wine during what's commonly called the nine days (the first nine or so days of <em>Av</em>). However, they may do so at a <em>mitzva</em> meal, such as one that celebrates the <em>siyum</em> (completion) of study of a tractate of Talmud. Can an adult eat meat and drink wine at a meal in the nine days that celebrates a <strong>minor's</strong> <em>siyum</em>? Does it count?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Rabbi <em>B'tzal'el</em> Stern (<em>B'tzel Hachochma</em> <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1809&st=&pgnum=411\" rel=\"noreferrer\">volume 4 number 100</a>) was asked whether a minor's <em>siyum</em> exempts an adult from <em>taanis b'choros</em>.</p>\n\n<p>He cites the <em>Rambam</em> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=9250\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Hilchos Korban Pesach</em> 5:7</a>) as saying that someone who became an adult between <em>Pesach</em> and <em>Pesach sheni</em> need not offer the <em>korban pesach sheni</em>. The explanation of this <em>Rambam</em> is that, because the Torah says to include an entire household, including children, on the first <em>pesach</em> offering, it's as though the then-child fulfilled the <em>mitzva</em> just like an adult (even though normally we say children are exempt from <em>mitzvos</em>).<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Stern extends this to Torah study: because a parent has a Torah obligation to teach his son Torah, it's as if the son has fulfilled a <em>mitzva</em> by studying Torah just like an adult. Therefore, Rabbi Stern concludes, his <em>siyum</em> can be used to exempt an adult from <em>taanis b'choros</em>.</p>\n\n<p>(Rabbi Stern's <em>t'shuva</em> is cited as practical <em>halacha</em> <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9780899066110.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">by Rabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that the same logic applies to eating meat or drinking wine during the nine days. The Torah study is like an adult's, the <em>siyum</em> renders the meal a <em>mitzva</em> meal, and those participating in the <em>siyum</em> can eat meat and drink wine. But consult your rabbi for a practical ruling.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>This follows Rabbi Stern's understanding of the <em>Kesef Mishneh</em> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=87037&rid=9250\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ad loc.</a>, citing <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi <em>Yosef</em> Kurkus</a>) and <em>Mabit</em> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14000&st=&pgnum=358\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>קרית ספר</em>, ad loc.</a>), that the father's obligation to include his minor son in the <em>korban pesach</em> essentially allows an adult-level fulfillment of the obligation by the son. </sub></p>\n\n<p><sub>An alternative understanding of the <em>Kesef Mishneh</em> is expounded by Rabbi <em>Chaim</em> Soloveitchik. He argues that there are two legal aspects to the fulfillment of the <em>korban pesach</em> commandment. The first is the individual's obligation to perform a commandment, and the second is the legal completion of the sacrificial service. Rabbi Soloveitchik contends that only the second aspect of the <em>korban pesach</em> applies to a minor, so the minor's parent is capable of including him in a household group for the <em>korban</em>'s consumption. Since the <em>korban pesach</em> service could be performed by a minor, its prior performance has legal significance for him once he reaches the age of majority. However, it is not as if he actually fulfilled an obligation as a minor.</sub> </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Rav Eliyashiv (Ashrei Ha'ish 69:12) held that a katan who makes a siyum and makes a celebratory meal is not considered a seudas mitzvah which would permit one to have meat and wine.</p>\n\n\n",

R’ Tzvi Pesach Frank (Har Tzvi OC 136) compares using a timer to later heat food to placing food on a stove that will be lit soon, which he argues is assur deoraisa. R’ Yehoshua Neuwirth (Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa 1:26), the Chazon Ish (38:2-3) and R’ Benzion Abba Shaul (Ohr Letzion 2:30:18) write that while it isn’t assur deoraisa, one still can’t do so on Shabbos because it is a problem of gerama, causing something to happen (though one could ask a non-Jew to do so while it was off).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Opinion #1 based on Hacham Ovadia Yosef</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On Erev Shabbat one may put a pot of raw food on a plata which is connected to a timer so that when the plata eventually turns on the food will cook. Since there are some poskim who do not allow doing so, one who refrains even though he is not required to is worthy of blessing. On Shabbat itself one may place a pot of liquid that was cooked before Shabbat and cooled down somewhat on a plata that is currently off but will turn on with a timer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sephardichalacha.org/2014/08/leaving-pot-of-raw-food-on-plata-from.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sephardichalacha.org/2014/08/leaving-pot-of-raw-food-on-plata-from.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Opinion 2 also based on Hacham Ovadia but others as well. These rules apply the same as if there were a timer, except in the cases of foods that are liquids such as soups, for that see the last opinion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, according to Hacham Ovadia Yosef, as he writes in his work Yehave Da’at, one may reheat fully-cooked, dry food over a “Blech,” that is, a metal sheet covering the flame. Since people do not normally cook in this fashion, placing food on a metal sheet does not resemble standard cooking, and is therefore permissible on Shabbat. Placing food on a “Blech” differs in this respect from placing food over an open flame or in an oven, which are, of course, conventional methods of cooking food. Hacham Ovadia maintains that one may place the food anywhere on the “Blech,” including the area directly over the fire.\n  There are other authorities, such as Hacham Ben Sion Abba Shaul (Israel, 1923-1998), who disagreed, but one may certainly rely on Hacham Ovadia’s lenient ruling in this regard.\n  Hacham Ovadia likewise allows reheating dry, cooked food on an electric hotplate. One may place the cold food anywhere on the hotplate, even directly over the heating element.\n  Summary: It is permissible to reheat dry food on a “Blech” or electric hotplate on Shabbat, provided that it is not a liquid and has been fully cooked. One may not reheat food on an open flame or in an oven on Shabbat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/displayRead.asp?readID=185&txtSearch=hot%20plate\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dailyhalacha.com/displayRead.asp?readID=185&txtSearch=hot%20plate</a></p>\n\n<p>According to some, you can also reheat soup as long as you place it there BEFORE the timer kicks back on.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The question arises as to whether one may set an electric hotplate on a timer, and place cold soup on the hotplate before the hotplate is activated by the timer. For example, one may wish to set the timer to activate the hotplate at 10 AM, and place the soup on the hotplate just prior to that time, so that he could have hot soup during Shabbat lunch. Since the hotplate is cold and inactive at the time he places the pot, perhaps we should not consider this person to be reheating the soup on Shabbat.\n  This issue is subject to a debate among the Halachic authorities. A number of recent Poskim, including the Hazon Ish (Rabbi Abraham Yeshaya Karelitz, 1879-1954), Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (Russia-New York, 1895-1986) and Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg (Israel, 1915-2006), ruled that this is forbidden, each for different reasons. Hacham Ovadia Yosef, however, in his work Yabia Omer (vol. 10), rules leniently, noting that this situation falls under the category of “Gerama” – an indirect action. Since the person does not actively reheat the soup, but rather indirectly causes it to be reheated, this is permissible. This is also the view of Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Israel, 1910-1995). Hence, one who wishes to be lenient in this regard certainly has authorities on whom to rely.\n  IIt must be emphasized, however, that one must be careful not to mistakenly compare different cases, and draw conclusions from one situation to another. We deal here specifically with reheating soup or another liquid that has been fully cooked and then cooled, by placing it on a hotplate before the hotplate is activated by a timer. One cannot necessarily extrapolate from this case to other situations of reheating food on Shabbat.\n  Summary: The authorities debate the question of whether one may place cold soup or other liquids on an electric hotplate on Shabbat, before a timer activates the hotplate so it can heat the soup. One who wishes to be lenient in this regard certainly has authorities on whom to rely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=717\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=717</a></p>\n\n\n",

He can't wear sneakers to shul, nor can he carry them (assume there's an eruv) since that is preparing for after Shabbat. In shul, at the start of <em>Ma'ariv</em>, he removes his shoes, so he's in his socks.</p>\n\n<p>Walking home barefoot or in his socks could be harmful. The street frequently has broken glass shards, nails and other sharp objects which cannot easily be seen at night, and it's quite likely that the person may step on one of these and severely injure his foot.\nWhen shul is done, can he put on his leather shoes to walk home?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayyim 554:17:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל ומנודה שמהלכים בדרך מותרים בנעילת הסנדל וכשיגיעו לעיר יחלוצו וכן\n  בתשעה באב\n  >מיימוני והגהות מרדכי ריש פרק קמא):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch seems to suggest a general leniency to wear shoes when walking in a public thoroughfare consisting of mainly non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Magen Avrham explains:</p>\n\n<p>Magen Avraham 554:17:</p>\n\n<p><b>מותרים בנעילת</b>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נ\"ל הטעם דטורח גדול הוא לילך רחוק יחף אבל כשהולך לשדה סמוך לעיר אסור\n  לנעול וה\"ה לבית הקברות עבי\"ד ססי' שפ\"ב אא\"כ יש טיט ורפש או בין העכו\"ם\n  ונ\"ל דכשיושב על העגלה או רוכב צריך לחלוץ אפי' בדרך רחוק:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason is that it is a great difficulty to walk a long distance barefoot. However, if he walsk to a field outside the city, he is not allowed to wear shoes. The same idea applies when visiting a cemetery unless there is mud or if he is walking among Gentiles.

This\npractice developed in Babylonia where most people understood only\nAramaic and sermons were given in Aramaic so Kaddish was said in the\nvernacular. This is why it is currently said in Aramaic. This\n\"Rabbinical Kaddish\" (Kaddish d'Rabbanan) is still said after studying\nmidrash or aggada or after reading them as part of the service. It\ndiffers from the regular Kaddish because of its inclusion of a prayer\nfor rabbis, scholars and their disciples. <strong>While anyone may say this\nKaddish, it has become the custom for mourners to say the Rabbinical\nKaddish in addition to the Mourner's Kaddish.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In most shuls I've attended, all mourners say this as well as the <em>Kaddish Yatom</em>, as suggested in the above quote. I can't say why your shul gives Kaddish D'Rabbanan to someone else. Perhaps, in line with the original concept mentioned above, the shul wants to give Kaddish D'Rbanan to a notable Rav or Talmid Chacham.

A Bar/Bat mitzvah, the birth of a child or grand child, a wedding or any other special moment deserves the good wishes of Mazal tov.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes we even joke and say Mazal tov when something breaks in the kitchen (a plate or a cup, etc.), perhaps because the noise evokes the sound of a groom breaking the glass under the chuppah (the wedding canopy).\nThere are events in our lives that are more frequent and (maybe) less relevant than a birth or a marriage like leading a service, saying a D’var Torah or receiving an aliyah. </p>\n\n<p>We have two different options to congratulate those who have had these kinds of honors: The Ashkenazi custom is to say: Yasher Koach (יישר כוח) that means literally “may your strength be firm.” The answer to this blessing should be Baruch Tiyihe (ברוך תהיה), may you be blessed. The Sephardic custom is to say Chazak u Baruch (חזק וברוך) that means literally “strong and blessed.” The answer to this blessing is Chazak vEmatz (חזק ואמץ), strong and courageous.</p>\n\n<p>The first mention of this form of congratulation is in the Talmud. It is written that when Moses broke the tablets G-d agreed with him and said: Yasher Koach that you broke them\" (Shabbat 87a).</p>\n\n<p>It is not very clear the path that this phrase went through until it became the most used form of congratulation after receiving an aliyah. Probably in ancient times, when few people had their own books, the Torah had to be read while it was standing upright and the text had to be visible to the congregation. People approached the center of the synagogue surrounding the reader. The reader, therefore, had to physically sustain the scroll by taking hold of its posts. Yasher koach became an encouragement to the reader, \"May you have strength not to cause the Torah to fall.”</p>\n\n<p>It is very interesting to relate the current usage of the phrase to the original Yasher koach. Today’s usage of this phrase is paradoxically a reversal of the actual usage as G-d reassured Moses by saying: You have done the right thing in showing the strength and bravery to hurl the Torah before a people that has proven itself unworthy of it.</p>\n\n<p>Did you know that? Now you know something more about our tradition, Yasher Koach!!!</p>\n\n\n",

The ambiguity is probably due to the fact that without Niqqud, יִישַׁר <em>Yishar</em> is indistinguishable from the much more common יְיַשֵׁר <em>Yeyasher</em>, which means \"will make straight\".</p>\n\n<p>I'm adding some information based on the <a href=\"http://hebrew-academy.org.il/2015/11/30/%D7%99%D6%B4%D7%A9%D6%BC%D7%81%D6%B7%D7%A8-%D7%9B%D6%BC%D7%95%D6%B9%D7%97%D6%B7/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew Academy</a>'s figures of speech page - it is naturally in Hebrew, but online translation can confirm if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>The origin of this figure of speech is indeed Shabbos 87a as noted in Scimonster's answer.</p>\n\n<p>The common interpretation of the word <em>yishar</em> is of the Hebrew root ישר which is related to straightness and honesty (as in Num 23:27).  However, linguist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ze%27ev_Ben-Haim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ze'ev Ben-Haim</a>'s opinion is that it is from the Aramaic root שרר which is related to strength and persistence (the modern Hebrew word for muscle, שריר <em>Shrir</em>, is of the same root). This opinion was accepted by the Hebrew academy's historical dictionary, which included the interpretation of יִשַּׁר in this context as \"let it be strong\", and thus the blessing can be translated as \"let your strength persist\".</p>\n\n<p>With this interpretation, יישר כוחך \"let your strength persist\" actually has almost the same meaning as חזק וברוך \"strong and blessed\". The similar יישר כוח, commonly abbreviated <em>Shkoyach</em>, means \"let (someone's) strength persist\" and it is understood as a generic blessing.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the similar blessing חזק ואמץ (<em>Chazak Ve Ematz</em>) means \"Be strong and brave\", and it comes from the Torah: It is in Moses's blessing to Joshua in <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0531.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 31:7</a>, and in many other places, in a similar meaning.</p>\n\n<p>Readers of Hebrew may find more information in the <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8_%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew Wikipedia article</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4305074/jewish/Why-Say-Chazak-After-Finishing-a-Book-of-Torah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This</a> gives a good answer. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since Scripture uses the term “this book of Torah,” the Midrash\n  understands that Joshua was actually holding the Torah scroll, and\n  when he completed it, G‑d told him “Chazak.”3 This is why the custom\n  developed to say “Chazak” to one who finishes reading the Torah. \n  (Beit Yosef, Orach Chaim 139; Rema, Orach Chaim 139:11.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, the Sephardic communities say “Chazak” every time one finishes\n  reading a part of the Torah. The custom further developed to where the\n  congregants tell the person who was called to the Torah, or anyone who\n  led the congregation in prayer or recited kaddish, “Chazak ubaruch”\n  (“Be strong and blessed”), and the person responds “Chizku v’imtzu”\n  (“Be strengthened and heartened”).</p>\n  \n  <p>On the other hand, as mentioned above, Ashkenazic communities say\n  “Chazak” only when they finish reading an entire book of the Torah</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n\n",

(See somewhere in the newsletter some mention of other customs that mention different paragraphs said other than <em>Rachum V'chanun</em> (Tehillim 6).)</p>\n\n<p>p. 31 (translation of Siddur MH\"R Shabtai Sofer):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The practice to recite the line: Rachum V’Chanun Chatasi before\n  reciting the chapter of Tehilim is based on what is written in the\n  Zohar, Parshas Pikeudei, page 472 in the large print edition and on\n  page 262 side one in the small print edition, that one should confess\n  his sins after finishing Shemona Esrei and before falling on one’s\n  face. That is what the To’Eles Yaakov wrote on page 33 side 1. A\n  similar point is raised by the book: Seder Ha’Yom page 20 side 1. The\n  key element of confession is the words: but we have sinned as it is\n  written at the end of the last chapter of Maseches Yoma page 87 side\n  1. It is further written there that confession must be recited while standing. The same point is made in the Zohar, ibid. So too the\n  Schulchan Aruch held in Orach Chaim Siman 607 paragraph 3. It\n  therefore appears to me that one should say the words: Rachum V’Chanun\n  Chatasi, which represents the essence of the confession, while in a\n  standing position. <strong>Then one should sit down, lean one’s head to the\n  left and then recite the chapter of Tehillim.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, it seems that the REAL part of <em>Nefillat Apa'im</em> is only Tehillim 6 and that's the only part when you should lean your head! An important point to learn from this excerpt - <strong>Don't</strong> lean for either <em>Vayomer David</em> or <em>Rachum V'Chanun</em>. (And to think that I've been doing it wrong all these years!)</p>\n\n<p>Begining on p. 58, you will find a discussion of <em>Hashem Elokei Yisra'el</em>. One notable points in that section:</p>\n\n<p>Machzor Vitri says that this <em>Piyut</em> was originally said responsively by the <em>chazzan</em> and cong. That's no longer done. But, from the fact of its original planning, it seems that this was NOT part of <em>Nefilat Apa'im</em>, otherwise the Chazan wouldn't be standing. (While not explicitly stated, there, I feel safe to assume that any responsive reading by the chazzan would not be done with him leaning.)</p>\n\n<p>There are other points in the newsletter that I encourage you to read, as they will offer different angles to the structure of what we now call <em>Tachanun</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Studying Holocaust Responsa on Tish'ah BeAv\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the restrictions practiced on Tish'ah BeAv is the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9364/5\">study of Torah</a>, because Torah study <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/44195/5\">\"gladdens the heart\"</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Several exceptions have been <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/9368/5\">formally codified</a>, which are of a nature germane to the day and/or to mourning.</p>\n\n<p>Is it permissible, therefore, for one to study <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/28870/5\">Holocaust responsa</a> on Tish'ah BeAv? That is, may one study the questions and answers presented during (and preserved since) the Nazi Holocaust, in which Jews were confronted with situations that not only tested their life and faith, but also the limits of Jewish law? If so, is this generally practiced (do Shuls and Yeshivoth tend to offer classes on these subjects, and/or are these subjects included as recommended study in various communities)?</p>\n\n<p>A written source one way or another would be preferred, but anecdotal evidence of a practice one way or another would be interesting, and possibly useful, as well.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Silber, one of the Rabbonim in Baltimore, included a few responsa from the sefer as part of his kinnos morning shiur/program. (See page 29 of the sourcesheet: <a href=\"https://files.rabbisilber.com/Shiurim/Kinnos5777.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://files.rabbisilber.com/Shiurim/Kinnos5777.pdf</a>) Rabbi Silber clearly felt it was muttar to discuss the teshuvos, likely for the reason that the discussion takes on a more serious tone given the context - being there I can say for myself it was a feeling of \"aye, what a painful scene\" rather than enjoying the intricacies of the psak. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would understand that it would be forbidden.  The reponsa themselves go through dialetic discussions of halachic topics that are not germane to the seriousness of the day, but rather the intracacies of the halacha.  While some responsa are indeed shocking and give an insight into the events of the Holocaust (this would be permitted), others discuss issues that do gladden the heart in terms of halacha.  For example, it is forbidden to learn the Gemara in Sanhedrin that deals with punishments meted out by Beis Din, as is forbidden to learn the sugyas of Haba b'machteres - pre-emptive killing of a thief and rodef.  These are in-depth sugyas that have many discussion points related to the holocaust - giving up one's life for halacha etc. etc.  So it may well be that the application for the scenarios presented in the responsa are germane to Tisha B'Av, the actual sugyas are not. Thus if one is reading the responsa for their halachic content it maybe forbidden, but when it comes to simply learning about the tragedy and its impact on the Jews from what the Rabbonim of the time saw and wrote, perhaps it would be permitted.  I would be inclined more to study the Midrash of Eicha or hespedim of great tzaddikim. From my experience in Yeshiva, the Rabbonim that I learned from never used the Responsa as a discussion point or spring board. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>If you view the shu't sefer as a cheftza of aveilus this should be mutar, otherwise not.</p>\n\n<p>So that if any enjoyment you get from the pilpul is subsumed in tzaar there is no mesamchei lev.</p>\n\n<p>But if you think it's interesting, you're probably not learning lishmah.</p>\n\n\n",

And many of them forgot the long history in that part of the world of Jews abandoning the covenant that our people made with God - and they certainly forgot the national curses which were enumerated in the Torah that were to come upon us in the event that we ever conceded to the delusion that the Jewish nation does not need God or His laws to reside safe in their dwellings wherever they may be.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of Jews being asked by the non-Jewish world how they deal with the \"problem of evil,\" I propose that the non-Jewish world ask themselves how they account for the evils that they have visited repeatedly upon our people.</p>\n\n<p>The real question that non-Jews should be \"reviewing\" in light of a very bloody history of Jewish suffering at the hands of the nations is how they could continually allow themselves to abuse and murder our people while asking us to consider blame God for our suffering.</p>\n\n<p>It is not for us to review, it is for the nations to take responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>I and many other Jews tire of this kind of question.

So my question is as follows:<br>\nWhat exactly is the purpose of Tisha B'av? Are we just mourning over all the tragedies, or are we trying to do teshuva so that tragedies like the ones we mourn on Tisha B'av don't happen again?(Sources and/or explanations would be nice, but are not necessary.)  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav S.R. Hirsch, in ch. 33 of Horeb, paragraph 240, writes that the purpose of all fast days is teshuva. This teshuva is achieved through, among other things mourning, which R' Hirsch describes as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the expression of one's sorrow and remorse. While on the one hand mourning testifies to our being linked with the destiny of Israel, it should also help in driving away self-gratification and all its hateful consequences by making conscious, through the ruin of Israel's ancient state... of the frailty of a personality based entirely upon the ego, be it ever so rich. Mourning should therefore contribute towards the sealing-up of that other source of sin, self-seeking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If the answer to \"Is it required that he accept those laws as binding\" is \"yes,\" then it is impossible to \"coincidentally happen to follow the 7 Laws without thinking about it.\" So I guess the first clause of the question is really my question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Rambam states in הלכות מלכים הלכה יא</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל המקבל שבע מצות בני נח ונזהר לעשותן הרי זה מחסידי עומות העולם. ויש\n  לו חלק עולם הבא. והוא שיקבל אותן ויעשה אותן מפני שצוה בהן הקב\"ה בתורה\n  והודיענו על ידי משה רבינו שבני נח מקודם נצטוו בהן. אבל אם עשען מפני\n  הכרע הדעת אין זה גר תושב ואיו מחסידי עומות העולם ולא מחכמיהם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188353/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-8.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Melachim uMilchamot 8:11</a> translates this as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Anyone who accepts upon himself the fulfillment of these seven mitzvot\n  and is precise in their observance is considered one of 'the pious\n  among the gentiles' and will merit a share in the world to come.</p>\n  \n  <p>This applies only when he accepts them and fulfills them because the\n  Holy One, blessed be He, commanded them in the Torah and informed us\n  through Moses, our teacher, that Noah's descendants had been commanded\n  to fulfill them previously.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, if he fulfills them out of intellectual conviction, he is not\n  a resident alien, nor of 'the pious among the gentiles,' nor of their\n  wise men.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The term מקבל (accepts on himself) implies that he accepts it as obligatory. This is similar to the way the Bnai Yisrael \"accepted\" the Torah at Har Sinai. That is, once it was accepted, it <strong>was obligatory</strong> from then on. Similarly, the fact that the non-Jew who accepts the sheva mitzvos must accept that they <strong>are mitzvos</strong> (commandments) shows that he must regard them as obligatory and from Hashem as brought down by Moshe just as the 613 mitzvos of the Torah are binding on Bnai Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_Noah\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seven Laws of Noah</a> besides pointing to the Rambam and the chabad translation, also points to the Encyclopedia Talmudis discussion of the matter.

Look there if you want to see more or want to see references to the Encyclopedia Talmudis.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I quote this very interesting article,written by Matthew Zachary Gindin, about the interpretation of the Rambam pass given by the famous HaRav Avraham Yitzchak HaCohen Kook, the first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of British Mandatory Palestine</p>\n\n<p>Rav Kook on Wise Gentiles and their Fate.</p>\n\n<p>This is a fascinating comment of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, z”l. Rav Kook was\nthe first Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of 20th century pre-Israel Palestine and was a\ngreat mystic and poet. Read it bearing in mind that the emended reading for\nthe Rambam that he proposes is in fact found in the older Yemenite\nmanuscripts of Mishneh Torah, and was also accepted and propounded by Rav\nSoloveitchik, z”l.</p>\n\n<p>The Righteous Among The Nations\n[The Rambam wrote:] “Any [gentile] who accepts the seven Noahide commandments\nand is careful in their performance is one of the righteous of the nations (chasidei umot\nha’olam), and he has a portion in the world-to-come. That is if he accepts them and\nperforms them because the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded them in the Torah and\nproclaimed through Moses that Noahides had previously been commanded in these. But\nif they perform them because it makes sense [to them], such a person is … not one of the\n‘righteous of the nations’ nor one of their wise men” (Hilchot Melachim 8:11).\n[This statement of the Rambam requires emendation.] The correct reading is: “he is not\n[merely] one of ‘the righteous of the gentiles,\n’ but one of their wise men.”\nI tend to think that the Rambam means to say that having a portion in the world-tocome\nis an inferior level (although it too is very great). Since even wicked and ignorant\nJews attain it, it is-compared to [truly] spiritual levels-low. The Rambam says that\nintellectual awareness brings a person much closer to [understanding] the\nrighteousness of God’s Providence.\n10/8/2017 Rav Kook on Wise Gentiles and their Fate – Talis In Wonderland\n<a href=\"https://talisinwonderland.com/2011/04/06/rav-kook-on-holy-gentiles/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://talisinwonderland.com/2011/04/06/rav-kook-on-holy-gentiles/</a> 2/4\nTherefore, having a portion in the world-to-come is a level attained by the righteous of\nthe nations who have not attained an intellectual awareness, but who have rather\naccepted the faith simply, with heart-felt emotion, and have acted well, as a result of\nhaving accepted the concept that the commandments were given by God. But if a person\nhas come to understand the seven Noahide commandments as a result of his own\nthinking, he is truly wise of heart and lled\nwith understanding. Such a person is\nconsidered one of their wise men, for the trait of wisdom is very great. And it is\nsuperuous\nto say that he has a portion in the world-to-come. [Indeed,] he stands on a\nholy level that needs to be spoken of with a fuller expression than “having a portion in\nthe world-to-come.”\nHowever, even were we to accept the Rambam’s words simply [without emendation],\nwe will nd\nnothing in them strange if we say that the quality of the world-to-come\nthat the Rambam is speaking of is a particular state that the divine and special nature of\nour holy Torah gives to those who keep the Torah. But there are other states that can be\ntransmitted by anything good-only, it is not called the “world-to-come.” That special\n[state called the “world-to-come”] derives from the power of the Torah, and is\nappropriate for anyone who accepts it and the sanctity of its faith. But this does not in\nany way deny other qualities that can be imagined regarding every philosophy, each in\nits own way.\nIgrot Hara’yah\nThis passage says that the spiritual level conveyed automatically to Jews (and\nnon-Jews) with simple faith in the Torah, “the world to come”, is a lower level\nthan that attained by truly wise gentiles. This reading of Rambam is exactly the\nopposite of the reading accepted by many pre-modern (and some modern)\nAshkenazi Rabbis, who read the Rambam as saying that wise gentiles do not\nhave a portion in “the world to come” since they were not on as high a level as\na simple Jew or a gentile with faith in the Torah. R’ Kook’s comment that\nvarious attainments result from the various philosophies of the world, and\nhigher attainments can be imagined for those reach knowledge of God’s will\nbased on their own wisdom, is intriguing</p>\n\n\n",

It is esp. common where nouns and verbs are used, but it is not unique to such construct (I.e. it could be noun / adjective). I'll use an example from the end of <em>Mishlei</em> as you should be familiar with these verses:</p>\n\n<p>Proverbs 31:10-11:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֵֽשֶׁת־חַ֭יִל מִ֣י יִמְצָ֑א וְרָחֹ֖ק מִפְּנִינִ֣ים מִכְרָֽהּ׃ בָּ֣טַח\n  בָּ֭הּ לֵ֣ב בַּעְלָ֑הּ וְ֝שָׁלָ֗ל לֹ֣א יֶחְסָֽר׃</p>\n  \n  <p>A woman of valour who can find? For her price is far above rubies. The\n  heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, and he hath no lack of\n  gain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>אֵֽשֶׁת־חַ֭יִל מִ֣י יִמְצָ֑א - noun followed by verb</p>\n\n<p>וְרָחֹ֖ק מִפְּנִינִ֣ים מִכְרָֽהּ׃  - adjective (prep. phrase?) followed by noun</p>\n\n<p>(\"Symmetrical\" - noun at beginning; noun at the end)</p>\n\n<p>בָּ֣טַח בָּ֭הּ לֵ֣ב בַּעְלָ֑הּ - verb followed by noun (object)</p>\n\n<p>וְ֝שָׁלָ֗ל לֹ֣א יֶחְסָֽר׃ - noun followed by verb</p>\n\n<p>(Symmetrical - starts with verb, ends with verb)</p>\n\n<p>You also see this type of parallelism in the Torah even if not associated with a \"song\". Example:</p>\n\n<p>Deuteronomy 7:15:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהֵסִ֧יר יְהוָ֛ה מִמְּךָ֖ כָּל־חֹ֑לִי וְכָל־מַדְוֵי֩ מִצְרַ֨יִם\n  הָרָעִ֜ים אֲשֶׁ֣ר יָדַ֗עְתָּ לֹ֤א יְשִׂימָם֙ בָּ֔ךְ וּנְתָנָ֖ם\n  בְּכָל־שֹׂנְאֶֽיךָ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And G-d will remove from you, all sickness; and all of the evil\n  diseases of Egypt, which you know, He will not place on you but will\n  give them upon all those that hate you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Verse begins with a verb followed by the object (noun). 2nd half of verse begins with the object (noun) and the verb follows it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The answer lies in the cantillation. That is, the vowels of the words drive the cantillation, and thus the word order (and verse parsing).   </p>\n\n<p>The books of <em>Tihillim</em> (Psalms), <em>Mishlei</em> (Proverbs), and <em>Iyov</em> (Job) <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vOxT0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">were cantillated to music and therefore had carried a different priority of cantillation marks</a> than the other twenty-one books of Scripture. In this regard, this particular verse appears in the Masoretic Text with the following disjunctive and conjunctive cantillation marks.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Yo6Nf.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Yo6Nf.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a><br>\nThe Masoretic Text therefore helps to understand <strong><em>why</em></strong> the verse appears in this particular grammatical order. That is, the cantillation in Biblical Hebrew stems from the vowel points of the words set with particular disjunctive and/or conjunctive cantillation marks, and therefore also provides the logical understanding in reverse cascade order. The following diagram provides the schematic logical understanding of the verse in reverse cascade order (please click to enlarge).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mw9c8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/E4APQm.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The disjunctive accent marks \"set off\" the major breaking points between the logical segments of the verse. Subsequent (stronger) disjunctive cantillation marks will \"accent\" the previous (less powerful) disjunctive cantillation marks. In this regard, the following expanded English translation will convey the logical idea based on this musical cantillation structure.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Mishlei (Proverbs) 6:23</strong><br>\n  <sup>23</sup> For the commandment is a lamp; that is, Torah is light.<br>\n  What is meant by this phrase is that the way of life comes through the reproofs of discipline.   </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Before closing, what would have been wrong with the following, which would have made more sense and would have aligned with the remainder of the verse?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/soF9S.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/soF9S.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>First, the Masorah Gedolah of the Tiberian Masoretic Text indicates <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rC4cb.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">that there are 20 places in <em>Mishlei</em> (Proverbs) where the initial word כִּי carries the initial conjunctive accent of the verse</a>. This initial accentuation therefore <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jO9Wf.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>forces</strong> the M'huppakh conjunctive accent to appear</a> (since this part of the verse is dominated by the Atnach disjunctive accent). In other words, this first accented word of the verse (כִּי) is what will drive how the clause is accented.</p>\n\n<p>Second, M'huppakh conjunctive accent <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lwWZH.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">is terminated by Dechi disjuntive accent</a>, which closes the clause (and the logical thought). In other words, when the Atnach-dominated clause contains three or more words, <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/moEsP.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Dechi accent appears as the subordinate disjunctive accent</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Third, <strong><em>and most importantly</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mDYWs.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Hebrew word נֵר is one syllable-long, and therefore is too short to take the Dechi disjunctive accent</a>, and so the rules of cantillation and accents had forced the swap of the placement of the words נֵר and מִצְוָה. Thus the correct arrangement of the words in this verse appears as follows in the Masoretic Text.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NFnGJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NFnGJ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In summary, the division and order of words and phrases within the verses of Scripture were not only musical, but also logical (and were driven by words, their vowels, and their respective placement in the verse). This hybrid of logical and musical arrangement of words and verses not only helps to understand and clarify Scripture, but also enables memorization, since both the logical and musical arrangement appear through the very same cantillation marks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>References:</strong>   </p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.logos.com/product/45606/hebrew-cantillations\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew Cantillations</a></em> (2014).

Since girls don't read the Torah portion maybe it's ok to have a bat mitzvah on Sunday? What will they be doing at their house? Why would it not be at synagogue? Would it be the kind of thing where I should dress up like on Shabbat or are regular clothes (following the Orthodox modesty rules) ok?</p>\n\n<p>I'm sorry if this is a very obvious question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Generally, Orthodox families do not make a huge fuss with Bnot Mitzvah (\"B'not being the plural of \"Bat\") - at least not on the same level as a Bar Mitzvah. That means, that there is usually no festivity done in a synagogue. (Within the past decade or so, that has been changing very slightly, as some Modern Orthodox have started doing at least some small celebration in the synagogue. However, among the \"black hat\" crowd that you describe, I know no one that has done anything in the synagogue.)</p>\n\n<p>The girl does not read from the Torah at all. - certainly not in synagogue during services. She may give some small speech thanking her parents, siblings, relatives friends and others for attending and making significant contributions to her life. </p>\n\n<p>A \"black hat\" crowd of people always dresses modestly. Most of the men will probably be wearing suits and black hats - esp. rabbis who will be attending. (BTW, expect that the rabbis esp. if they are affiliated with the girl's yeshiva will probably be making speeches and saying words of Torah.) The women will also be dressed modestly and many will be wearing wigs, hats, or covering their hair, otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>If you're considering a nice gift for the girl, I think a small Siddur, Tehillim, a kerchief (as she may eventually use it when lighting Shabbat candles or to cover her head, otherwise, once married) or small candle sticks, may be appropriate. Judaica-themed jewelry, of course, always works.\nI don't advise bringing any food items unless you ascertain which kosher certifications the household uses.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn't determine your gender from your user name, so, at the moment, I can't advise you how to dress other than to say \"modestly\". If you're male, wear a suit, nice shirt and tie. Female - dress long sleeves and at least a hat. I.e. - don't dress in any pants, shorts or bathing suit, etc,</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I attended a lovely bnot mitzvah this year at an Orthodox shul. There was a quiz game where the girls demonstrated their knowledge of halacha. I was impressed! There was jewelry making, singing, delicious dairy meal with desserts. It was mixed gender. I think the girls made a speech about their studies and their tzedakah projects. Sorry I don't have any sources to cite.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is \"piggul\"? A question on the Bartenura\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishna (Zevachim 2:3) clearly defines <em>piggul</em> (פגול) as resulting from one of the four sacrificial procedures (slaughter, collection of the blood, walking to the altar and sprinkling) being performed with the intention of eating the sacrifice after its appointed time <em>only</em>. Something that is slaughtered (or has its blood collected, carried or sprinkled) on condition that it be eaten outside of its appointed <em>place</em> is also forbidden, but it is not called <em>piggul</em> and it does not result in <em>karet</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This same attitude is expressly clearly in the Rambam (Hilkhot Pesulei haMuqdashin 13:1) - any sacrifice that is performed with the intention of its being eaten outside the appointed place is forbidden, but only that which is performed with the intention if its being eaten outside of its appointed <em>time</em> is called <em>piggul</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I am not aware of anybody holding contrary to this, and yet consider what the Bartenura says on Kareitot 1:1! There, the mishna includes the consumption of <em>piggul</em> as one of the thirty-six things that results in <em>karet</em>, and the Bartenura defines <em>piggul</em> as follows:</p>\n\n<p>קדשים שחשב לאכלן חוץ לזמנן או חוץ למקומן</p>\n\n<p>Sacrifices, [during the performance of which] one intended to eat of them outside the appointed time, <em>or outside the appointed place</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a typo in the Bartenura?? I've checked two different versions already, and this is what he says in both of them. Not only that, but I've not found anybody else commenting upon the phenomenon. Assuming it is not a mistake, how can the Bartenura define <em>piggul</em> contrary to the Rambam, the gemara and the Mishna itself?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The  עיקר תוי\"ט already asks your question <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01338.html#HtmpReportNum0000_L2\">ibid</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ח:</strong> וְדִבְרֵי תֵּימַהּ הֵן, דִּבְהֶדְיָא שָׁנִינוּ בְּמִשְׁנָה ג' פֶּרֶק ב' דִּזְבָחִים חוּץ לִמְקוֹמוֹ פָּסוּל וְאֵין בּוֹ כָּרֵת‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems that the Bartenura was either badly copied or else simply used the common phrase  חוץ לזמנן או חוץ למקומן \"as a matter of habit\". </p>\n\n<p>(For similar, see the  עיקר תוי\"ט on ברכות  Ch. 4 note (יא) where he also says אגב רהיטא לא דק דהול\"ל והתפללו אליך דרך העיר.

In these instances it is considered a significant sprinkling, since this sprinkling with improper intent effects acceptance, i.e., it is considered a valid sprinkling with regard to rendering the meat of the offering piggul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Artscroll states in footnote 5: [B]ut if a zerikah was invalidated through beyond its time or outside its place intent ... It renders the offering Piggul.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>Piggul is obviously TIME but at a different time the PLACE changes also!! So the PLACE acquires a new status due to its relationship to TIME!! It is not through itself as Place but through its relationship to Time that this occurs.

If so, why? Or, did Moses force this upon them? Why specifically the tribe of Menashe? How was the division decided (i.e., who should go and who should join the other tribes on the west of Jordan?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>An <strong>aish.com</strong> article titled \"<a href=\"https://www.aish.com/tp/i/moha/97763584.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Half of Menashe</a>\"  offers a number of answers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first two tribes, Reuven and Gad, were involved in the negotiations with Moshe from the outset. How did the tribe or part of\n  the tribe of Menashe get themselves involved in this? The text itself\n  is silent; therefore the commentaries feel free to offer different\n  interpretations.</p>\n  \n  <p>The <strong>Ibn Ezra</strong> provides a quantitative explanation, theorizing that\n  they did not merit mention until this point because they were so few-\n  even though they were involved in this request from the outset. When\n  one looks at the numbers involved, it becomes clear that the term\n  \"half the tribe of Menashe\" is imprecise: Of eight families of\n  Menashe, two joined Reuven and Gad in Transjordan while the other six\n  entered the Land of Israel.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, the <strong>Ramban</strong> suggests that these two families of Menashe\n  became involved only at this point: When they saw the deal that had\n  been negotiated by the other tribes they jumped on the proverbial\n  bandwagon, hoping to negotiate similar terms. The <strong>Ramban</strong> explains\n  that numerically they were the smallest group in the tribe of Menashe,\n  and thought that on the other side of the Jordan they would get larger\n  tracts of land. Despite the practical temptation of remaining on\n  the captured side of the Jordan, we cannot help but be surprised when\n  the tribe of Menashe joins the ranks of the \"expatriates\". After all,\n  they are the children of Yosef, the one leader of a tribe who asked\n  that his remains be returned for burial in the Land of Israel.(9)\n  Furthermore, in last week's parsha, we saw how the women of Menashe,\n  the daughters of Zelaphchad, fought for their right to inherit the\n  Land. It seems strange that the tribe with such a strong bond with the\n  Land of Israel would prefer to remain in trans-Jordan.</p>\n  \n  <p>Perhaps they never did ask to remain. The Torah does not record such a\n  request; only Moshe's directive is recorded. One could postulate that\n  it was for this precise reason that Moshe requested that they stay\n  behind with the two \"secessionist\" tribes: Because of their\n  particularly strong love for the Land, perhaps they could serve as a\n  role model for the tribes of Reuven and Gad.</p>\n  \n  <p>The <strong>Netziv</strong> suggested that the tribe of Menashe was not interested\n  in staying outside Israel. Rather, Moshe asked them to do so because\n  he knew that the other tribes would need Torah leadership. Menashe's\n  inheritance east of the Jordan was not allotted to them in response to\n  their own request. Moshe initiated the move in an attempt to insure\n  the integrity and continuity of the other two tribes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I heard an awesome answer in a Dvar Torah given at our shul awhile ago:\nThe idea starts from the selling of Yosef into slavery: The Yishmaelim who took part in the deal were said to be</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from <strong>Gilead</strong>, their camels bearing gum, balm, and ladanum to be taken to Egypt.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.37.25?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 37:25</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gilad is significant to the story as it was apparently a center for slave-trafficking (unfortunately I don't remember if a source was brought for this part and I couldn't find anything...).</p>\n<p>Later on in the Torah, it is said that Yosef lived to see his grandchildren through Machir, son of Menashe:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...the children of Machir son of Manasseh were likewise born upon Joseph’s knees.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.50.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 50:23</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Who were these descendants of Yosef that were \"born upon [his] knees\"? One was Machir, who was apparently named after the Mechirah, the sale of Yosef. Another was <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.27.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gilad</a>, son of Machir and father of Chefer, who was apparently named after the city of Gilad. These two, among the other descendants of Yosef, grew up hearing his story of the sale, his life's story. If Gilad wasn't a center for slave-trade, perhaps he wouldn't have been sold into slavery and wouldn't have had to endure all of those hardships. At his deathbed, Yosef told them not to forget what evil came from the Gilad and to make sure to rectify it. Machir and Gilad received their names so that the Tribe would never forget.\nThat's why Menashe's descendants go out and capture the Gilad without prompt or permission from anyone - it was <em>always a given</em> that this was a personal mission for the Tribe of Menashe that <em>had</em> to be accomplished:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead and captured it, dispossessing the Amorites who were there.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.32.39?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 32:39</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and that's why Moshe <em>readily</em> gave them the land:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"So Moses gave Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he settled there.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.32.40?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 32:40</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having fulfilled Yosef's dying wish and clearing out the evils of the Gilad, they proceeded to settle there.</p>\n<p><strong>Another answer</strong> is brought by Da'at Mikra in their introduction to Divrei Hayamim, pg. 65-66 (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And explained the author of the ancient commentary to Divrei Hayamim, known as \"Student of Rasag\"...that this whole portion in Bamidbar, end of ch. 32 (and afterwards also in Devarim 3, 13-15), in the lands of the families called \"the sons of Menashe\", who set out and conquer large territories in the north of the Gilad and the Bashan and naming them after themselves...are \"ancient tales\" (i.e., stories from the past). <a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/Attributed_to_Student_of_R._Saadia_Gaon/Divrei_HaYamim_I/2.22#m7e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">As he says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And Machir, his mother's father, was the head and chief of Gilad, and Yair conquered the Gilad after him, therefore he was named after his mother's father and after the name of the territory that they conquered during the reign of Yosef who was king over all of the land. And when Yosef and his brothers died, the nations grew stronger and Geshur and Aram who were nations took Chavot Yair etc - and for this the sons of Machir desired to dwell in the land of Gilad, and per the conquests of their forefather, Moshe gave it to them...and know that those things...of Machir and Yair and Novach are ancient tales, because Machir and Yair and Novach did not capture anything [during their time] in the desert...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that is also the view of Rabbi Yehudah Hachassid (in his commentary on the Torah, Shemot 1:7)...:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"My father would prove from Divrei Hayamim, that in the duration of Yisrael's settlement in Egypt, they would sometimes go to the land of Yisrael, the ground [owned by] our forefather Yaakov, and would build there cities. And I believe, that specifically the descendants of Yosef would do this, and <em>they</em> had permission from Pharaoh, because out of the respect he had for Yosef, Pharaoh honored them by letting them repair and strengthen their inheritance, and they would settle there tenants and would collect from them taxes...therefore, that She'erah who lived well for six generations prior to [Yehoshua]...must be that it was during the time they were in Egypt.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Jair Ben Menashe had been responsible for conquering the territory and was given it by Moshe.

(Mesorah L'Yosef (Qafih) Vol. 1-2; 2007, p. 16).</p>\n\n<p>He cites <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Yehuda is quoted as saying that anytime a woman miscarries, even a piece (of fetus) she is rendered a nidda, even if there is no accompanying blood. Rambam explains in his commentary to that Mishna (as per Nidda 21a) that R. Yehuda is of the opinion that anytime something leaves the uterus, bleeding inevitably follows.</p>\n\n<p>However, Rambam rules (there and in Hilkhot Issurei Biah 5:13) in accordance with the Tanna Kamma (first opinion in the Mishna), that such a miscarriage does not render a woman a nidda, as we do not presume that she bled. Accordingly, in the case of the IUD there would be no reason that the insertion itself would render her a nidda.</p>\n\n<p>Even according to the view of R. Yehuda which is adopted by other Rishonim, it is not at all clear that this would apply to something entering the uterus. I am not aware of any Rishonim who indicate that it would apply. Indeed, while the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechezkel_Landau\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noda Biyehuda</a> (Tinyana YD 120) opines that it would apply, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avrohom_Yeshaya_Karelitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hazon Ish</a> (YD 83:2) disagrees. For more views who dispute the Noda BiYehuda's view, see Hagahot Barukh Ta'am to the Noda BiYehuda and Shu\"t Ateret Hakhamim (18) at length, who notes that Rambam, too, disagrees with the Noda BiYehuda (besides for the fact that as noted Rambam does not even hold of the opinion of R. Yehuda in the first place.</p>\n\n\n",

(there is some source for torah being called food in this sense but it doesn't occur to me at the moment where. now in reference to G-d things get tricky because does G-d lack that he needs something extra?

    "content": "# Is \"tirtzach\" 'murder'?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The way I was taught it (and confirmed by this <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16648/1362\">answer</a> and the comment on it), the Hebrew word \"<em>tirtzach</em>\" refers to murder, and is distinguished from  the H-R-G and M-T roots which mean \"kill.\" Therefore, the <em>pasuk</em> which reads \"<em>lo tirtzach</em>\" (do not murder) is not in conflict with judicial killing (<em>tehargeno</em>, or <em>yumat</em>).</p>\n\n<p>However in the case of a killer who has to run to an <em>ir mikla</em>t, the <em>go'el hadam</em> who catches up and kills the unintentional killer, first, is said to kill (M-T) him and then is said to R-TZ-CH him (all from <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0435.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B'midbar</a> 35):\nיט גֹּאֵל הַדָּם, הוּא <strong>יָמִית</strong> אֶת-הָרֹצֵחַ:</p>\n\n<p>and then</p>\n\n<p>כז וּמָצָא אֹתוֹ, גֹּאֵל הַדָּם, מִחוּץ, לִגְבוּל עִיר מִקְלָטוֹ:  <strong>וְרָצַח</strong> גֹּאֵל הַדָּם, אֶת-הָרֹצֵחַ--אֵין לוֹ, דָּם</p>\n\n<p>I know that in the second <em>pasuk</em>, the situation has changed (the accused has left the safety of an <em>ir miklat</em>) but if his killing of the accused is \"extra judicial\" then he would be held liable. The end of the <em>pasuk</em> says he isn't.</p>\n\n<p>A following <em>pasuk</em> is even more confusing:\nל כָּל-מַכֵּה-נֶפֶשׁ--לְפִי עֵדִים, <strong>יִרְצַח</strong> אֶת-הָרֹצֵחַ</p>\n\n<p>No context is given, but the killing of someone deemed textually a \"murderer\" is called \"murder.\"</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Torah Temima</em> quotes the <em>gemara</em> in <em>Makot</em> 12a which posits opinions that it is a <strong><em>mitzvah</em></strong> to kill the accused if he leaves the city (only in particular situations, granted) so the title \"murder\" should not apply.</p>\n\n<p>Am I missing something in understanding the root R-TZ-CH?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The answer (inspired by Shadal to <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/35.30#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">35:30</a>, but with a lot of elaboration and explanation) seems to be as follows:</p>\n\n<p>In Bamidbar <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/35.19#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">35:19</a> and <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/35.21#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">35:21</a> the Root M-T (which I'm assuming means \"put to death\") is used, for the simple reason that those cases (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/35.16#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">35:16-18</a>) are cases of intentional murder.  The murderer there is \"Chayav M-T\" (which is the word used for Beis Din putting someone to death).  The Goel Hadam is supposed to be carrying out that verdict of Beit Din, hence he M-T's the murderer.  In conclusion, Beit Din is associated with M-T, and the Goel Hadam is doing what Beit Din would be doing.</p>\n\n<p>However, the story changes at that point from an intentional murder to an accidental murder.  Therefore (at least in Peshat, if not Halacha as well, see Rashi, Hakesav Vehakabbalah, Shadal, Ibn Ezra to <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/35.27#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">35:27</a>), ideally the Goel Hadam <strong>should not</strong> kill the murderer.  In Bamidbar <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/35.27#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">35:27</a> the wording used is R-Tz-Ch, because the Goel Hadam is no longer simply fulfilling the Beis Din's wishes to put the murdered to death, but <strong>he is murdering him because he is mad that this person killed his relative</strong>.  It happens to be that he is not punished for this (likely because the murderer left the Ir Miklat), similar to a Ba Bamachteres, see Rashi and Ibn Ezra to <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/35.27#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">35:27</a>, but he is still considered a \"murderer\".</p>\n\n<p>This leaves a problem with the R-Tz-Ch in <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/35.30#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">35:30</a>, which seems to be talking about a case of intentional murder, which would make the Goel Hadam an \"agent\" of the Beis Din.  However, we can suggest a couple of answers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>This is before it even gets to Beit Din - the Eidim can \"allow\" the Goel Hadam to kill him and be let off scot-free.</p></li>\n<li><p>It is simply expressing that even (and perhaps even more so) in cases of intentional murder, he is still functioning to some extent as a \"murderer\", who would kill the original murderer even if he wasn't allowed to, and he is not just a nice guy trying to do Beis Din's bidding.</p></li>\n<li><p>(Edit: Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 7:3 has a Hava Amina that since it says Yirtzach [Es] Harotzeach, we would assume that the murderer must be put to death the same way he killed, which might be a reason in Peshat for using a similar term.)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm not sure exactly what combination of this is explained by Harechasim Levikah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45410&st=&pgnum=143\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) quoted by Shadal above, but that's the basic gist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary, your understanding of R-Tz-Ch is correct, it just cannot be applied to Beis Din, so when the Goel Hadam acts (even unintentionally) as an agent of Beis Din, we call him a Killer (M-T).  When the Goel Hadam attacks the murderer in a case where the death was an accident, he is considered a \"murderer\" that does not get punished.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Please correct if wrong.</p>\n\n<p>2) There is no mischief or anti-semitism behind my enquiry. I just want to understand better the ongoing Israel-palestine conflict.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I will start by addressing the specific question that you have asked here: \"According to <em>Halacha</em>, is it a sin for a Jew to take control over some land in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> when this land was taken <strong>against the will</strong> of its previous controller (regardless of whether it was occupied or empty, and whether there was violence involved in the transition)?\"</p>\n\n<p>The answer to your basic question is, \"no, there is no general prohibition against taking <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> by force (i.e. with violence).\" War is not something that Judaism views as universally forbidden.  Indeed, the conquering of the Land from the Canaanites by force was itself a commandment (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0520.htm#16\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deut. 20:16</a>). Your comparisons to theft are not really analogous: stealing is forbidden; conquering land is not forbidden. Therefore, there is at least one case where it is not a sin to take control of some land in Israel by force.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the conquering of the Land of Israel from the Seven Nations who were living there was a special case and not necessarily directly relevant to today. You mention that the motivation for your question is understanding the halachic issues regarding Jews <em>nowadays</em> moving into land previously controlled by non-Jews in Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Your suggestion in the question was that perhaps this is a violation of the prohibition against stealing. It turns out that this actually cannot be the case because of a halachic technicality called קרקע אינה נגזלת (\"land is not stolen\"). This should not be understood as a <em>permission</em> to steal land; rather, it should be understood as a technical description of a scenario. In short, land that is taken from someone against his will is not considered to be \"stolen\" but rather still in the domain of the original owner. It is not necessary to completely understand this distinction for our discussion here; what is important is that the technical halachic prohibition against stealing cannot apply to land. (If you are interested in learning more about this halachic concept, see the Gemara at <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=30&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sukkah 30a-b</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=21&daf=117b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bava Kama 117b</a>).</p>\n\n<p>All this tells us, though, is that taking someone's land against his will is <em>not called stealing</em>.  That doesn't mean that it is permitted. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.376?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Arukh 376:1</a> rules that trespassing is forbidden and compares it to stealing. So the question here is, are Jews living in Judea and Samaria trespassing on the land of non-Jews? </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this is the point in our discussion where the answer depends on whose version of the facts you accept as true. The State of Israel claims that its wars have always been wars of self-defense and any land captured has always been taken for strategic reasons related to national security. Wars of self-defense are permitted according to <em>halacha</em>. If you accept this version of reality, all of the land controlled by the State of Israel was legally captured in a legitimate war and the Arabs who had been living there abandoned their land anyway!</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, someone who rejects this version of the facts could possibly come to a completely different <em>halachic</em> conclusion. That is part of the reason why there was so much resistance to your question in its original formulation. The original question was a question about the facts on the ground in Israel. We do not answer that kind of question on Mi Yodeya. Here, we can only answer questions where the scenario is well-defined and the question is about Judaism.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Of course it is a sin to steal land in Israel for many reasons and there is no denying that! Anyone who does it is doing the wrong thing and it is not what God wants Jews to do now, as almost all Rabbis teach.</p>\n\n<p>Even though it may not technically be stealing (because it is God-given Jewish land, and we never gave up hope to return to it after being driven out by the Romans [losing hope to reclaim your land doesn't make a difference in Jewish law anyway for the true owner always retains the rights to the land--see <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.371.1?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch CM 373</a>]), being that the Messiah has not come yet, we can not conquer our land by force (through a war lead by the Jewish King [some hold he can be a different form of leader/government], unless it is a war in self-defense) if it is understood by the world as \"stealing,\" because if the world honestly treats something as stealing then Jewish law treats it as stealing; we reflect the world's moral view (if it is actually moral) measure for measure (See R Reuven Margaliyot's <em>Mishpitei Ger Toshav</em> starting from <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21595&st=&pgnum=74&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a> where he discusses Jewish law ruling like Gentile law. This can flow from the concept of dina demalchusa dina, or the general Noahide dinim. I view it as a logical midda kenneged midda type of rule as that is how Hashem rules the world, meaning, since it can't be that international laws are more moral than Hashem's Torah will, He wants Jews to follow the derech haaretz under the umbrella of the Torah instruction to \"<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.18/he/Tanach_with_Nikkud?qh=%D7%94%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%20%D7%95%D7%94%D7%98%D7%95%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow\">do what is straight and good</a>,\" which includes doing what is truly ethical in the eyes of both God and man (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47525&st=&pgnum=274\" rel=\"nofollow\">see Tosefta Shkalim 3:2</a> quoting Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael) even if not explicitly commanded to do so, and to avoid the chillul Hashem when people judge Jews as being immoral and dishonest for taking land from innocent Palestinians). </p>\n\n<p>Further, although the government may have the halachik power to take land in their jurisdiction and it is not technically stealing (called hefker beth din, dina dimalchuta, or other concepts; yet a government which follows the Torah may be necessary to have these halachik rights, as opposed to a secular government), an individual does not have the right to take the law into his own hands and 'conquer' the land from the inhabitants because that is actually stealing from people who have ownership the land, nor can individuals build in ways that have a detrimental effect on the previous right of passage that the peaceful inhabitants had established before this person moved in.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, taking of land can put Jews in great danger, so we are forbidden to do it even if you disagree with this understanding of how Jewish law works.</p>\n\n<p>Aside, I don't know where people are getting this idea that you are allowed steal land when it is clearly forbidden as stealing to even trespass on someone's land, let alone take it from them by force, as is written in the <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.376?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch CM 376</a> (i.e. Code of Jewish Law). You can make all the hair-splitting distinctions you want, but that doesn't change the halacha nor the fact that it is forbidden according to all opinions (for one reason or the other).</p>\n\n<p>When the Messiah comes, we hope that the entire world will recognize his stature (or at least those living in Palestine), so that we will not have to wage war to retake our land. Until then, many Rabbis support 'land for peace' initiatives, because we will get all of Israel back in the future anyway. At that time, Palestinians will live in a moral, just, holy, peaceful, and blessed Jewish society (it is assumed we will have a king too as <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=15016\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam</a> says throughout that chapter), and they will be honored to be part of the glorious Jewish state.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, the peaceful Palestinians at that time will be allowed to live in Israel. It is just that the government of Israel will maintain control of the land. I do not know the details as to who exactly owns that land and what will happen at Jubilee when land returns to its proper owner. It may be that when the lands will be divided by lot, as spelled out in the last chapters of Ezekiel, the moral non-Jews who live in the land will be able to stay in their towns (although the government will have power over the land as it has power over all land according to the halachik details) and therefore they will not ever have to leave at Jubilee because they own it (or because the state owns it, so the state will symbolically return it to the owners every 50 years). It is possible that even Jews will have to be transferred throughout the land to live within their own tribe's borders. I have to do more research on these matters.</p>\n\n\n",

Swimming is limited in both areas to a small swimming area and both parties are barely visible to each other due to the great distance.)</p>\n\n\n",

(Exodus 12.16) Moses had specifically permitted baking and\n  cooking (Exodus 16,23). In view of this the Torah considered it as\n  necessary to repeat the prohibition of handling fire on the Sabbath.\n  If this kind of work was prohibited on the Sabbath, other work which\n  was far less urgent was certainly prohibited also.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, thinking through a few things, here:</p>\n\n<p>1 - Moshe tells them to prepare food for Shabbat, b/c there would be a double portion on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>2 - He also tells them that they can cook (as Rashba\"m explains) on Yom Tov, (which could be on a Friday.)</p>\n\n<p>3 - Mahn did not last until the following day, except on Friday to Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>If they were told to prepare and cook for Shabbat on Friday, how could they do that if there was no man available on Friday, even if it was on a Yom Tov?

From here, we learn the concept of making an Eruv Tavshilin.</p>\n\n<p>(I have to assume that there is no concern that the Eruv would spoil at the time that you make the Eruv.

Nobody checks backgrounds; if people want to show up and learn, they show up and learn.  I know we've had non-Jews show up at times.  In cities with decent-sized Jewish communities, and/or Chabad, there are public classes of various sorts.

There are other interpretations of our texts out there in the world, ranging from mistaken to fraudulent, and we've collectively been evangelized and attacked by some of these groups rather a lot.  <em>You</em> didn't do that, of course; I'm just explaining background to say this: it's ok to ask questions (we love questions!), but try to ask them with some humility and from within the frame of Judaism as best you understand it, and if the leader seems to be trying to move on, let it go.  As you attend more you'll get a sense of the group and this will be easier; initially, it's probably better to focus on listening and learning.</p>\n\n\n",

On page 114 of <em>Studies in Maimonides and His Interpreters</em>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_B._Shapiro\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Marc Shapiro</a> notes that Rambam omits the statement in Berakhot 18a since in his view:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dead people do not observe the actions of people.[i] Furthermore, as Maimonides could well point out, the Talmud never indicates that this is a generally applicable law rather than simply a conversation between two <em>amoraim</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He further notes there that while Rambam <em>does</em> quote the teaching regarding tefillin, Torah scrolls and Sh'ma in a graveyard, (which unlike the statement about tsitsit, is phrased as an explicit instruction), he does not actually mention loeg larash.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Qafih</a> notes (Ketavim Vol. II pg. 622, and commentary to Hilkhot Evel, pg. 217) that following his general approach, Rambam did not present the Bavli's reason for not saying Sh'ma in a graveyard and the like, but instead explained it based on the dirtiness and impurity of graveyards, as is clear from Hilkhot Tefilla (4:8). R. Qafih further notes (Ketavim pg. 625 and commentary to Hilkhot Evel, pg. 219) that this understanding that the problem with Sh'ma in a cemetery is the impurity, is implied by the Yerushalmi Moed Kattan (3:5). R. Qafih proceeds to discuss the general point (which some may find surprising) that Rambam's worldview would lead him to reject an idea in Hazal, and how it is consistent with that of Rambam's predecessors. This is also a major subject of Prof. Shapiro's entire book, and is discusses in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isadore_Twersky\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Dr. Isadore Twersky</a>'s <em>Introduction to the Code of Maimonides</em>, as well.</p>\n\n<p>See also this piece by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moshe Tsuriel</a> which references R. Qafih, and discusses the propriety of different activities in cemeteries.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that there were other commentators who felt the need to reconcile Rambam with the Bavli. Much of the writings of R. Qafih, and Marc Shapiro's book, address this general approach of not learning Rambam qua Rambam.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] While Prof. Shapiro (and R. Qafih who will be cited) doesn't demonstrate this there, (perhaps he does elsewhere), it is important to note that after R. Hiyya chided R. Yonatan for dragging his tsitsit in the graveyard, R. Yonatan defended himself (and this defense provides another reason why Rambam might not record an injunction on tsitsit in a cemetery; R. Yonatan evidently didn't hold of one, and even after R. Hiyya mentioned it, he provided reasoning against it, although the Gemara later claims (18b) he retracted, the extent of this retraction is debatable, and the Yerushalmi Berakhot (2:3) does not record him retracting). R. Yonatan claimed that the dead are not aware of the goings on in the world to justify not bringing in tsitsit! He bases himself on the verse \"The dead know naught\" (Ecclesiastes 9:5). R. Hiyya rebuts this with a seemingly more Midrashic interpretation. However, the simple understanding of the verse, in line with R. Yonatan's position of bringing tsitsit into a cemetery, is still cited by Rishonim in Rambam's milieu, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_ibn_Balaam\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yehuda ibn Bil'am</a> to Isaiah (8:19), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> there, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ibn_Ezra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> to Ecclesiastes there.</p>\n\n\n",

Now you had to borrow a blue dress from someone else, which would make for a really messy game of who's borrowing from whom ... so instead they told everyone to stick with white, so you couldn't tell socieconomic class just from looking at their dress.

Which is to learn in a way of \"bekius\", until one knows everything well, then later in life to learn \"iyun\". He even prescribes how each type of person should learn (i.e. one who can understand well, one who doesn't understand so well, etc.) Although perhaps the Litvish community wouldn't give so much thought to this I'll note as well that The Arizal, Sha-ar Ha-Mitzvot Va-etchanan, page 79 right column, writes that iyun should be only be learned an hour or two a day (and that this itself was only for the \"keen minded\", but those who have \"dull\" brains should not even devote that time to iyun.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps my biggest question on how this started was the fact that R' Chaim of Volozhin was a talmid of the Gra who himself writes in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14229&st=&pgnum=33\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishlei Chapter 6 Verse 8</a> (starts at the bottom of the page that I linked to) that a person should spend the first part of his life learning a lot (bekius) and then later in life spend time more with \"iyun\". How could he go against his own Rebbe?</p>\n<p>How can the generations ignore what Chazal and the great Chachamim that came before us prescribed. Not to much that the iyun often or never brings someone to halacha l'maseh (practical Jewish Law) which is perhaps the most important thing.</p>\n<p>My question is a big one, however if we'll say that this whole way of learning started with R' Chaim then I have a kasha on him, how could he go against his Rebbe, the Gra.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>My Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Ahron Lopiansky, who is particularly well read in history, in a shiur titled <a href=\"http://torahdownloads.com/shiur-1004786.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Why So Much Iyun 5774</a> spoke out that (my memory of the shiur is not that sharp, so I may be misquoting him or leaving out a detail and suggest you see the shiur) the chachamim of that generation saw that although the method you described was the proper way to learn, it took a significant amount of time, and was very difficult to do, and they were losing boys to Yiddishkeit after they left yeshiva because they couldn't get through the \"grind\"/the hard part which was necessary in the beginning.  (In my own words: it was like learning piano; to become really skilled you must practice arbitrary and unpleasant scales and finger exercises to no end, over and over again, and then you can start playing real songs with skill and gain musical intuition.) They couldn't handle learning the same masechta 70 times over again before moving on to the next one. So when they decided to instead focus on the most intellectually stimulating and difficult parts of shas, and delve deeply, the boys found it tremendously rewarding and \"geshmak\", and ultimately continued learning and living like a Jew after they left yeshiva. It is a complex thing to triage when you have such limited time, and literally a person's life is at stake. עת לעשות לה' הפרו תורתיך - \"A time to act for God, they uprooted Your Torah\", because that is actually what Hashem wants.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Sam's answer is probably the main point, but I would like to add that in Volozhin, the yeshiva pace was a daf a day, so they covered all of Shas over a seven year cycle. So their iyun pace would be today's bekius pace. If you look at Meromei Sadeh, which is the Netziv's shiurim on Gemara, you see he covered all of Shas. R' Chayim Soloveichik used to learn sixty blatt a day for himself.</p>\n<p>In addition, many yeshivos encourage bochurim to learn bekius on their own and finish the masechta. So while the main limud is iyun, students are expected to cover ground and know more. In post-secondary yeshivos, there is an expectation that students can do this on their own or with a chavrusa without official help. (The same applies to learning Tanach.)\nSo while the study of bekius has been downgraded (as Sam explained), it has not been lost completely.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My Rosh Yeshiva (R' Lopiansky) gave two more answers (<a href=\"https://torahdownloads.com/shiur-1023940.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in this shiur</a>) (I have not heard the shiur in several years, so I recommend listening to the original, being that my memory may be somewhat off, and the words here are the way I interpreted/remembered them):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"The mind rebels\" (direct quote) against illogical and unjustified facts and instructions. It doesn't sit well with us to just be told to mindlessly do things we don't understand. Having a strong background in Gemara teaches a person how the whole system of Torah and Halacha works, and whenever a person does a mitzvah it at least somewhat becomes a familiar territory, and the person now has a vocabulary for understanding new halachos/situations, etc. It goes from the realm of \"this is just what G-d said\" to a more sophisticated understanding.

    "content": "# What is the reason that the Torah uses a ן (final \"Nun\") at the end of 2nd person plural verbs?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Frequently, the Torah uses a final nun (ן) at the end of verbs. They seem to be 2nd person plural verbs. An example:</p>\n\n<p>Deuteronomy 5:30:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בְּכָל־הַדֶּ֗רֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֨ר צִוָּ֜ה יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֛ם אֶתְכֶ֖ם\n  תֵּלֵ֑כוּ לְמַ֤עַן <strong>תִּֽחְיוּן֙</strong> וְט֣וֹב לָכֶ֔ם וְהַאֲרַכְתֶּ֣ם יָמִ֔ים\n  בָּאָ֖רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר <strong>תִּֽירָשֽׁוּן׃</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Ye shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God hath commanded\n  you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye\n  may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Translation from Sefaria. I added for convenience of non-Hebrew MY readers.)</p>\n\n<p>There are numerous other instances where this technique is used in the Torah. (I assume this is used in the rest of Tanac\"h, also, but I'm uncertain.)</p>\n\n<p>The meaning of the verb is the same with or without the Nun. My questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a pattern as to when the Torah uses the Nun? (Perhaps related to trope (cantillation note) or surrounding words or syntax? </li>\n<li>Does the Nun convey any additional meaning that would not be conveyed if it were missing?</li>\n<li>I am assuming that this technique is used only for 2nd person plural verbs. Maybe it's used for 2nd person singular as well. Is it used elsewhere? Please cite a sample.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The addition of a <em>nun</em> is referred to in some grammars as \"nunation\"; this particular type of <em>nun</em> is the \"paragogic nun\", and its usage is controversial. It appears over 300 times throughout Tanakh (mostly in Deuteronomy, incidentally - 56 times), primarily on the ends of 3rd person and 2nd person plurals, but sometimes also on the end of a 2nd person feminine singular (eg: Ruth 2:8, 2:21, 3:4 and 3:18).</p>\n\n<p>So, what does it signify? Its similarity to attested forms in Ugaritic, Arabic and Aramaic (in which it is simply the regular, non-jussive form) makes it seem archaic. It could be evidence, therefore, for the text's being old, or for it featuring a deliberating archaism. It may also, some think, have to do with metrical considerations - note that verbs with the paragogic nun occur especially on major and minor pauses. Some think that it provides an added emphasis, and others think that it is there for euphonic reasons. Truth be told, it's a bit of a mystery.</p>\n\n<p>Sources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Joüon and Muraoka, <em>A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew</em> (2nd edition; Gregorian and Biblical Press, 2009), §44e-f</li>\n<li>E.

Now Ezra and his court decreed specifically regarding a man with seminal emissions, vs. all other categories of impure people, not to recite Shema until immersing in a mikvah; however this enactment never spread throughout the Jewish people and the majority of the community could not keep it, therefore it became void.

The M.A. writes: “But now the custom is to\n  say Mizmor Shir, etc., and yet to perform all kinds of labors until\n  Barechu [i.e., if it is still before beyn ha-shemashos]. ” The reason\n  is that originally this was the manner in which they accepted upon\n  themselves this custom /of saying Mizmor Shir, etc./ ; they did not\n  intend it to be an acceptance of /the holiness of/ Shabbos. All this\n  /held true/ at the time of the M.A. But today the custom in all our\n  localities is that as soon as Mizmor Shir is said, the congregation\n  accepts /the holiness of/ Shabbos upon themselves, and it is then\n  forbidden to engage in any work even if there is still much time\n  remaining in the day. [P.Mg. and D.Hach.] The Derech Chochmah writes\n  that the same is true for localities where Lechah Dodi is customarily\n  recited, which concludes “ Bo’i Chalah ” : 8 this constitutes a true\n  acceptance of /the holiness of/ Shabbos.

    "content": "# Why ever rely on a vav hahipuch?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a grammatical form in the <em>chumash</em> of the <em>vav [hahipuch]</em><a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/klarberg/archives/vayelech62.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1</a> which <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2012/12/on-the-prefix-vav/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">turns</a> words written in the past form into future tense and future tense constructs into past. I noted this, I think, pointed out explicitly in the first <em>pasuk</em> of <em>Va'etchanan</em>, where the Avi Ezer supports the reading of the first word as \"שתיבת ואתחנן הוא עתיד הנהפך לעבר\" (unless there is another grammatical reason to account for the tense change besides the vav).</p>\n\n<p>So I can understand <strong>that</strong> this construct exists, but I don't yet understand WHY it exists. If there is a way of creating the \"right\" form of the verb, why write it in the opposite way and then put a <em>vav</em> on to change the tense? If the <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2004/07/vaetchanan-when-did-moshe-pray.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> says that it means \"וכבר התחננתי\" why wouldn't the text simply use the past tense (perfect or pluperfect) in the first place? Is there an opening for a commentary which would be foreclosed if the text simply wrote the appropriate tense?</p>\n\n<p>In cases where the <em>vav hahipuch</em> is used, is there a deeper reason <strong>why</strong> the tense is written in one way and then inverted?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The simple answer to this question is that there's probably no such thing as a <em>vav hahippukh</em> anyway. On the contrary, Hebrew grammarians speak of four (not two) verbal aspects in Classical Hebrew:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The perfective (aka suffix-conjugation, aka <em>qatal</em>) - eg: כתב. This\n  indicates a completed action;</p>\n  \n  <p>The imperfective (aka prefix-conjugation, aka <em>yiqtol</em>) - eg: אכתוב.\n  This indicates an incompleted action;</p>\n  \n  <p>The waw-consecutive perfect (aka <em>weqatal</em>) - eg: וכתבתי;</p>\n  \n  <p>The waw-consecutive imperfect (aka <em>wayyiqtol</em>) - eg: ויכתוב.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the example that you brought in your question, ואתחנן is a waw-consecutive imperfect, or <em>wayyiqtol</em>. Identifying it is fairly easy: it involves a patach under the <em>waw</em> and a dagesh in the following letter (in this case, a qamatz under the <em>waw</em>, since the aleph cannot take a dagesh).</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean? Well, this is where things get complicated. One prevailing theory is that it indicates a consecutive action in the narrative. Prose passages in Tanakh feature high concentrations of this type of verb. Discourse linguists claim to isolate a broader range of possible meanings, depending on the type of text in which it appears, and a look at any grammar of biblical Hebrew should give you at least a brief synopsis of those.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend checking out Arnold and Choi's <em>A Guide to Biblical Hebrew Syntax</em>, pp84 onwards. They identify five different types of meanings, which they label sequential, consequential, narratival, epexegetical and dependent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I reached this discussion while trying to understand Exodus Chapter 14, and I am grateful for the insights here. Exo14:1-4 contains what seems to me to be some non typical uses of the vav hamipuch.  The passage includes discourse from God as well as pharaoh using both perfect and imperfect  forms, in context of prediction and as command.  Human perception is linguistically connected, as Sperling and others have learned from experiments with visual perception.  We might postulate that the use of vav hamipuch may have to do with  an experience we are unable to perceive within our modern rationality. This may be especially true when trying to understand passages reliant on a strong faith in divine control of time and fate, something modernity has deemphasized. I was taken by Pharoah’s awkward construct in 14:3 - perhaps this is the Egyptian spiritual view of time. Unfortunately this leads to the unsatisfying conclusion that the reliance on Vav Hamipuch is to clarify the unfolding of events in a way that modern humans can’t perceive.</p>\n\n\n",

(Perhaps these are related questions.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Loewian already cited Talmud Brachot that explains the source for citing it 3 times daily. However <a href=\"http://www.beureihatefila.com/files/Why_We_Recite_Ashrei_Three_Times_A_Day.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Beurei Hatefilah article</a> cites several commentaries that state that it really should be cited <strong>once</strong> daily. I don't want to occupy space here pasting an excerpt, as it's tangential to the O.P.'s question.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pnei Yehoshua</em> on Brachot 4b says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Eleazar said and Rabbi Avina said: Anyone who recites Psalm 145:\n  Tehila L’Dovod each day, three times per day, is promised a place in\n  the Next World. It appears that the intention of this rule is that if\n  one recites this prayer with the proper thought three times a day, it\n  becomes a Chazaka. His faith will be strengthened in his heart because\n  the whole world was created only so that we spend time learning Torah\n  that was written in the 22 letters of the Hebrew Alphabet that are in\n  this psalm. And everyone was created for that purpose. Three times a\n  day one should concentrate on the meaning of the verse: You open your\n  arms and feed all living beings. This means that G-d feeds his whole\n  world from the horns of the wild oxen to the eggs of the bugs. All of\n  them are nurtured with little effort and without pain as it is written\n  earlier in Psalm 145: The eyes of everything look to you and you give\n  each one his food at the right time. It follows from that rule that a\n  person should make his work secondary and his work for G-d primary as\n  our Sages taught us that those who follow that rule with have this and\n  that happen to them. This is also what is meant by the gemara’s\n  statement that he is guaranteed a place in the Next world. <strong>Based on\n  this it is easy to understand why the three times that we recite\n  Ashrei are during the daytime and none are at night as part of\n  Maariv.</strong> The reason is that the majority of time that a man spends in\n  his vocation is the time after the morning prayers, as it is written:\n  A person goes out to his work until evening meaning until after the\n  time to recite the afternoon prayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As we see below from the OU the reason is that we do not have chazaras HaShatz (repetition of the Shmona Esrai) as part of Ma'ariv. As a result, there is no kedusha in the prayer. Thanks to @Lee for stating that this is based on the Maharsha.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ou.org/community/tefilllah/ashrei/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ashrei</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is evident that the Sages intended to link Ashrei with the reciting\n  of Kedusha, because Kedusha always follows Ashrei. The first Ashrei is\n  in Psukei Dezimra, which precedes the Kedusha of Et Sheim and the\n  Kedusha of Shemoneh Esreh, the second is before Uvah Letzion, the\n  final Kedushah of Shacharit, and the third starts the prayer of Mincha\n  which leads into the Amidah and Kedusha. Since Maariv does not contain\n  a Kedushah, we do not recite Ashrei then.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We can connect the three times we say Ashri (twice in Shacharis and once in Mincha) to the three times that we daven, but that is a different matter.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The custom to recite Ashrei thrice daily seems to be based on the gemara in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.4b.46-47?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berachoth 4b</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי אלעזר א\"ר אבינא: כל האומר \"תהלה לדוד\" בכל יום שלש פעמים מובטח לו שהוא בן העולם הבא</p>\n  \n  <p>R' Eleazar son of R' Abina said: Whoever recites \"Tehilla l'David\" three times\n  daily may be assured that he is a person of the world to come...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only <em>tefilloth</em> (prayers) that are a <em>chova</em> (obligation) daily (at least originally when Maariv was still treated as a <em>tefilath reshuth</em> [optional prayer]) are <em>Shacharith</em> and <em>Mincha</em>.

Similarly, the Yerushalmi says that one should always say, \"Lord of Hosts, Happy is the man who trusts in You.\" (Y. Berachos 5:1, 53b). This could have a similar effect, of reminding you to trust that Hashem is determining events, and doing everything for the best.</p>\n\n<p>Another idea is to keep a \"hashgacha pratis\" journal, keeping daily notes of coincidences and other things that happen to you daily, which reinforce your belief in Providence.

Here is a loose translation of the relevant section of <em>Avnei Eliyahu</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And behold, it is known that the color white represents mercy, and the color black represents judgment, and also night represents judgment.

    "content": "# Can non-Biblical figures be considered prophets?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If a person is a leader of men and brings his community to religion and is an upholder of the law, could he be considered a prophet, or is this honour only held by Biblical figures?</p>\n\n<p>Does G-D still appoint prophets to lead his communities today, or has the age of prophets passed?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nI think my question is more in regards to what makes a great leader and what makes a prophet and how these two things are related. The question linked asks more about how Judaism view of prophecy differs from other religions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>In Judaism, prophecy means to communicate the <em>direct</em> word of God. Someone who does the things that you mention might be a great person, but that is simply a different thing from prophecy.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible lists 55 Jewish prophets, although the Talmud (Megilla 14a) states that there were 1.2 million Jewish prophets, so prophecy was not limited to those prophets mentioned in the Bible. The Talmud explains that the vast majority of these prophets' messages were only relevant to their own generations. Only the messages that were important for the future were preserved in scripture. So the answer to your title question, \"<strong>Can non-Biblical figures be considered prophets?</strong>\" is \"yes.\"</p>\n\n<p>However, being an \"upholder of the law\" and bringing a community to religion are not the same thing as prophecy, and they are not necessarily even required qualifications for it. God can grant prophecy to whomever he chooses. An example to prove this is Bilaam who was an evil man, but was nonetheless granted prophecy.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, prophecy and being a great leader are simply different things. There is definitely a correlation in the Bible between great leadership and prophecy; however, prophecy ceased to occur long ago even though there have been many great leaders of the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In Judaism, a prophet per se means someone to whom God gives a distinct message to communicate to the people. The last prophets were at the end of the Biblical era, around 2400 years ago, helping the people get the Second Temple up and running.</p>\n\n<p>What you're describing is a wonderful person, and in a broader sense we might say that such a person is doing what God put them on earth to do. But we would not call them a prophet, or accept a message they claimed to have received from God. (Mind you, the existing Scripture is quite large, so a contemporary leader could certainly say \"I think we should focus more energy on this pre-existing subject or commandment now.\")</p>\n\n<p>Even at the individual level, many of us have had people in our lives who've helped us in significant ways, and we thank God for putting the right people in the right place in the right time. The Bible tells that Joseph got lost looking for his brothers, and a random fellow found him and gave him directions. The classical commentary Nachmanides (Spain, mid-1200s) says that some rabbis referred to this stranger as an \"angel\", which was just a way of saying that God can send the right people at the right time to say the right thing.</p>\n\n\n",

We are rewarded for our mitzvoth, but we should expect to receive that reward in Olam Haba, not now. (Yes, many mitzvoth are rewarded in Olam Hazeh, but, <em>Pirkei Avot</em>, among other places, states that the expectation of the reward should not be the only reason to perform or discard a mitzvah.)</p>\n\n<p>One source for this concept of receiving reward in Olam Haba is:</p>\n\n<p>Deuteronomy 7:11:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְשָׁמַרְתָּ֨ אֶת־הַמִּצְוָ֜ה וְאֶת־הַֽחֻקִּ֣ים וְאֶת־הַמִּשְׁפָּטִ֗ים\n  אֲשֶׁ֨ר אָנֹכִ֧י מְצַוְּךָ֛ הַיּ֖וֹם לַעֲשׂוֹתָֽם׃ (פ)‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>You shall keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances,\n  which I command you today, to do them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi on Deuteronomy 7:11:1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><b>היום לעשותם.</b> ולמחר לעולם הבא לטול שכרם:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>And tomorrow, in <em>Olam Haba</em>, you will be able to take reward for\n  them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, if you assume that rewards are pleasurable, then, yes, Olam haba would be enjoyable. As to whether you can refuse the reward in <em>Olam Haba</em> or whether it is \"forced\" upon you even if you don't want it ... Well, no one from Olam Haba has told me if that option is available ;-)</p>\n\n\n",

One of the key verses is Deuteronomy 2:10-11 (texts from Sefaria):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הָאֵמִ֥ים לְפָנִ֖ים יָ֣שְׁבוּ בָ֑הּ עַ֣ם גָּד֥וֹל וְרַ֛ב וָרָ֖ם\n  כָּעֲנָקִֽים׃ רְפָאִ֛ים יֵחָשְׁב֥וּ אַף־הֵ֖ם כָּעֲנָקִ֑ים\n  וְהַמֹּ֣אָבִ֔ים יִקְרְא֥וּ לָהֶ֖ם אֵמִֽים׃</p>\n  \n  <p>The Emim dwelt therein [in the land of Moab] aforetime, a people\n  great, and many, and tall, <strong>as</strong> the Anakim; these also are accounted\n  Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the Repha'im are described to be tall <strong>as</strong> the Anakim, but they are neither the Ankim or a subset of them.</p>\n\n<p>In your citation of Deuteronomy 3:11:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּ֣י רַק־ע֞וֹג מֶ֣לֶךְ הַבָּשָׁ֗ן נִשְׁאַר֮ מִיֶּ֣תֶר הָרְפָאִים֒\n  הִנֵּ֤ה עַרְשׂוֹ֙ עֶ֣רֶשׂ בַּרְזֶ֔ל הֲלֹ֣ה הִ֔וא בְּרַבַּ֖ת בְּנֵ֣י\n  עַמּ֑וֹן תֵּ֧שַׁע אַמּ֣וֹת אָרְכָּ֗הּ וְאַרְבַּ֥ע אַמּ֛וֹת רָחְבָּ֖הּ\n  בְּאַמַּת־אִֽישׁ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim;\n  behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of\n  the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four\n  cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.—</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>you point to the fact that Og was, in fact a Repha'ite, and, in fact Og was one of the most \"famous\" giants. His height is not described, here, but his bed;s length is described, thus, by inference, he was a giant similar to Anak. But, here, too, you can see that he lived in a different area than the Anakim. Also, refer to Genesis 14:5 that mentions that Chedarl'omer conquered the land of Repha'im, which explains this verse discussing that Og was the only survivor of that group.</p>\n\n<p>As for Anak, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anakim\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Wikipedia article</a> which will refer you to appropriate Torah verses.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They dwelt in the south of the land of Canaan, near Hebron (Gen. 23:2;\n  Josh. 15:13). According to Genesis 14:5-6 they inhabited the region\n  afterwards known as Edom and Moab in the days of Abraham. Their name\n  may come from a Hebrew root meaning \"strength\" or \"stature\".[2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that the Anakim get more mention than the Repha'im and they are the ones more known as the \"giants\" than Repha'im. This makes sense, as they were the first giants that the spies saw, and they also lived in Hebron, even at the time that Abraham travelled and lived there! We know that the Philistines were also giants. According to the Wikipedia article (I have to further verify its linked source), they were descendants of the Anakim. So, the Anakim were around for far more years than the Repha'im.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rashi points out that these were different groups of of \"giants\". The Art Scroll commentary on Devarim 10-11 refers to Rashi and explained that the nation of Eimim were colloquially considered like Refaim \"which was a different family of giants (Anakim)\". However, they were not the Refaim whose territory Bnai Yisrael were going to conquer. The Eimim had been conquered by the children of Lot and their land was the inheritance of Moav. This was included as an explanation to ensure that Bnai Yisrael did not make the mistake of confusing the territories involved.</p>\n\n\n",

And in order that the fruit\n  will sprout normally throughout the spring time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Deuteronomy 16:1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שָׁמוֹר֙ אֶת־חֹ֣דֶשׁ הָאָבִ֔יב וְעָשִׂ֣יתָ פֶּ֔סַח לַיהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ\n  כִּ֞י בְּחֹ֣דֶשׁ הָֽאָבִ֗יב הוֹצִ֨יאֲךָ֜ יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ\n  מִמִּצְרַ֖יִם\n  לָֽיְלָה׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy\n  God; for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out\n  of Egypt by night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Most translations of the word \"Aviv\" that I have seen translate this as \"Spring\", which would tie this to the Solar equinox, only.</p>\n\n<p>However, Rashi on Deuteronomy 16:1:1: (excerpt)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><b>שמור את חדש האביב.</b> , שיהא ראוי לאביב להקריב בו את מנחת העמר,\n  ואם לאו, עבר את השנה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That the month should be one that is appropriate for the (barley) ripening in order to sacrifice the Omer sacrifice. If it is not this way, then, make a leap year.</p>\n\n<p>My question - Rash\"i seems to translate \"Aviv\" as \"ripening\" and tie this to an agricultural event. Also, the Omer offering was done only in the land of Israel (See Vayikra 23:10.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, in the desert there were no trees, and there was no rainy season either.</p>\n\n<p>So, when the Torah refers to \"The Month of Aviv\", does that mean \"Spring\" based on the equinox? If so, can we safely assume that this was the only reason to have a leap year while they were in the desert for 40 years? How was this calculated (I.e. - who knew \"Sod Ha'ibur\" (\"Secrets of intercalation\") and who made this decision?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is one allowed to read books written by Homer such as The Iliad or The Odyssey?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When I was in elementary yeshiva, I had to read both The Iliad and The Odyssey. Both these books focus on Greek mythology, specifically the Trojan War.</p>\n\n<p>Sefer HaChinukh 426:1 says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שלא לחן ולרחם על עובד אלילים - שלא נחמל על עובדי עבודה זרה, ולא יישר\n  בעינינו דבר מהם, כלומר, שנרחיק ממחשבתנו ולא יעלה על פינו שיהיה במי\n  שהוא עובד עבודה זרה דבר תועלת, ולא יהיה מעלה חן בעינינו בשום ענין, עד\n  שאמרו רבותינו זכרונם לברכה (ע''ז ז א) שאסור לומר כמה נאה גוי זה או מה\n  נחמד ונעים הוא, ועל זה נאמר (דברים ז ב) ולא תחנם, ובא הפרוש על זה לא\n  תתן להם חן, כענין שאמרנו. ויש מרבותינו שלמדו מלא תחנם, לא תתן להם\n  מתנות חנם, והכל שרש אחד. ובירושלמי דעבודה זרה (פ''א ה''ט) אמרו לא\n  תחנם, לא תתן להם חן, בלא תעשה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Synopsis of part of the above:</p>\n\n<p>From the verse in Deuteronomy 7:2 which says (at the end) \"Do not show favor (grace) to them\", this means that we should distance our thoughts and it should not enter our speech regarding an idol worshipper, any use to us, and it should not even find any favor in any manner.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the rabbis of blessed memory said that we should not say, \"How pleasant and enjoyable this nation is.\"</p>\n\n<p>Does this mean that we are prohibited to read any of the writings that discuss foreign gods, such as Greek mythology? What if, as when I was in elementary school, the teacher forces you to read it as part of the class, but you gain no pleasure at all from doing so?

I don't think that I can answer it definitively, but the following information might be of use to you. If you have a look at Avraham Grossman's <em>Rashi</em> (trans. Joel Linsider; The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2012), you will see that he features a bit of a discussion of this issue on pp145-147.</p>\n\n<p>He quotes various scholars who have also noted Rashi's inconsistencies and contradictions, and who were not bothered by them. One example is the Maharsha (Kiddushin 44a, s.v. כלל אינו), who observes that it is a basic feature of Rashi that he explains things differently in different places.</p>\n\n<p>One theory has it that Rashi sometimes changed his mind, while another had it that the information transmitted pertained to things that he had learnt from different teachers. One novel (but problematic) theory has it that the commentaries were transmitted orally to his students and written by them, but this is dismissed by Grossman on the basis of the manuscript evidence, which clearly seems to show that they began as literary compositions.</p>\n\n<p>Grossman lists four different possibilities: the possibility of scribal error, Rashi's own corrections (which may not have covered the entirety of his work), his reliance upon different teachers at different times, and the need in some instances for a contextual interpretation - that is, reflective not of Rashi's personal opinion, but of what he believes the opinion of that particular sugya/sage to be.</p>\n\n<p>Since there <em>is</em> evidence of multiple manuscripts of Rashi's commentary on individual tractates, testifying to the fact that his work was updated and corrected, I think it's reasonable to suppose that the considerations that Grossman lists are all relevant to Rashi's comment on Gittin: that it might be an error, reflective of the opinion of one/some of his teachers, or an attitude that he once had but from which he subsequently deviated. But since Rashi explicitly identifies his interpretation in Beitzah as being his own (\"לי נראה\"), that one may have the best chance of actually representing what he, personally, believed.</p>\n\n<p>At least, at the time that his commentary on Beitzah was authored.</p>\n\n\n",

See also Me’am Loez Anthology on Exodus, 21:14</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out in Mishpatim 21:14 that it is a commandment to put a murderer to death and it is not allowed to show him \"mercy\".</p>\n\n<p>There is an interesting article applying this to modern times which quotes these sources.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.acpr.org.il/ENGLISH-NATIV/06-issue/shochetman-6.htm\">“He Who is Compassionate to the Cruel\nWill Ultimately Become\nCruel to the Compassionate”</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This notion, that displaying an attitude of mercy towards the wicked\n  who deserve severe punishment involves acting cruelly towards the\n  general public, can be found in the words of Maimonides in his book\n  The Guide of the Perplexed.2 In reference to the verse (Exodus 21:14),\n  “If a person willfully schemes to kill his neighbor – he shall be\n  (even) taken from my altar and put to death”, Maimonides writes that</p>\n  \n  <p>the wicked and calculating person (who killed intentionally and was sentenced to death) – if he seeks sanctuary among us, we must not\n  provide him with asylum and not have mercy upon him...because\n  compassion towards the wicked – is cruelty to all beings.</p>\n  \n  <p>Regarding the verse located in the chapter discussing Saul’s war with\n  Amalek (I Samuel 15:9), “And Saul and the nation spared Agag,” the\n  Midrash says (Tanhuma, Parashat Mezora,1; Yalkut Shimoni, I Samuel, Chapter 121.):</p>\n  \n  <p>R’ Elazar said: One who becomes compassionate to the cruel will ultimately become cruel to the compassionate, as it is written, “And\n  Saul and the nation spared Agag and the best sheep and cattle.”, and\n  it is written (Ibid. 22:19) “And Nov, the city of priests, he smote\n  with the edge of a sword.”</p>\n  \n  <p>As we know, King Saul was commanded by the prophet Samuel: “Go and\n  smite Amalek and confiscate all that is theirs” (I Samuel 15:3). This\n  commandment stemmed from the Torah commandment to erase the memory of\n  Amalek (Deuteronomy 25:19), however, in the hearts of Saul and the\n  nation, compassion on Agag, King of Amalek and on the best sheep and\n  cattle, was aroused, and as a result, Saul refrained from completely\n  fulfilling the words of the prophet. In this regard, the Midrash\n  states that one who becomes compassionate to the cruel will ultimately\n  become cruel to the compassionate as King Saul acted compassionately\n  to Agag (the cruel) and ultimately became cruel to the compassionate,\n  in the guise of the people of Nov, the city of priests, whom Saul\n  killed wantonly because he suspected them of having assisted David.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The company has a small kitchen where I go to wash my hands, and then I generally eat at my desk. Whenever I have bread, I always try to wait for a time when nobody is in the kitchen who will try to talk to me, wash my hands, and then run quickly back to my desk and make <em>hamotzi</em> because I am worried that somebody will try to strike up a conversation with me after I have washed.</p>\n\n<p>My question is twofold:</p>\n\n<p>1) If somebody ever does talk to me after I have washed my hands, would it be considered an interruption for me to explain that I cannot talk between washing and eating some bread? If not, how much detail can I go into before it is considered an interruption? For example, if the person asks, \"So how are you talking to tell me this?\" can I go on to explain that as well?</p>\n\n<p>2) What are some practical steps that can be taken to avoid falling into this awkward situation.</p>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this question, assume that the company has enough employees and people walking around who might talk to you that it is impractical to warn all of them ahead of time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Given that you wash your hands in the kitchen, I have found that bringing a piece of bread in a sandwich bag is a useful method.

One should note that he explicitly states that this is not the same as the case of S'dom since it was only a small group of people who just wanted to \"enjoy\" immorality. Ramban states that some of them were \"baalei Givah\".</p>\n\n<p>The rest of Bnai Yisrael (Mallbim says both the Sanhedrin of the other tribes <strong>and</strong> the Eidah 20:1) immediately arose and wanted to put them to death even though the miscreants were not technically liable for the death penalty (because of no witnesses or warning and that they released the concubine [not an aishes ish] who was able to return to the house and died of exposure). Daas Sofrim states that it was because of the lack of a king that they relied on the testimony of the Levite himself.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This judgement has its origin in the priciple which our Rabbis have\n  stated(Yevamos 90b): \"The Court may administer lashes and the death\n  penalty which are not authorized by the Tora. However, they may not do\n  this [with the intent of instituting a law which] transgresses the\n  Torah but only for the purpose of erecting a fence around the Tora.\n  The tribe of Benjamin, however, did not consent to this as they were\n  not guilty of the death penalty for violating the concubine.  Perhaps\n  the Benjamites were also provoked by the fact that the tribes did not\n  communicate with them first and reached a consensus without asking for\n  their opinion.</p>\n  \n  <p>In my opinion, this [failure to consult Benjamin] caused Israel's\n  punishment which resulted in their being routed at first since the war\n  was done <strong>not in accordance with the law</strong>. The obligation of making\n  the \"fence\" lay upon the tribe of Benjaminand not upon them, as it is\n  the tribe itself that is obliged to judge its constituents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus we see that both groups were deserving of punishment. Benjamin forgot to punish the sinners in its insistence on maintaining its prerogative (though they might have done so later had the war not broken out). The other tribes sinned but not asking Hashem <strong>first</strong> if they <strong>should</strong> go to war but only \"<em>Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin?</em></p>\n\n<p>Benjamin compounded the error by not just driving the tribes away but \"<em>seeking to destroy them by a perpetual hatred</em>\" (Yechezkel25:15). Bnei Yisrael, while they asked for permission to continue to fight, still hads not completely atoned and did not ask about victory because they still relied on natural means. When they finally atoned for this, they still sinned by letting their anger continue to have control of them and killing all the men women and children of Benjamin aside from the men who escaped from the battle.</p>\n\n<p>Ramban says that it could be that the total killed on both sides (with the men women, and children additional) the total killed was equal (40,000) on each side, making the punishment on each side equal.</p>\n\n<p>Ramban then goes into why this occurred.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And how significant are the words of our Rabbis (Sanhedrin 103b) who\n  said that the anger of Hashem at that time was due to the idol of\n  Micah (Shoftim chapter 17)! <em>Said the Holy One, blessed be He,\n  'Concerning My honor, which was violated by those guilty of death and\n  thosed who raised their hand against the priciple of religion, namely,\n  the unity of Hashem, you did not protest; but for the honor of a\n  mortal you did protest, to an extent which exceeded the limits of\n  justice'</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore He confounded the counsel of the two groups and made their\n  hearts stubborn, <em>and they remembered not the brotherly covenant</em>.\n  (Amos 1:9). But after the affair they had regrets, just as it is said\n  (Shoftim 21:2-3)  ... For now they realized their mistake and\n  punishment.</p>\n  \n  <p>We have thus incidently explained a concealed matter which is not\n  clear [with a cursory reading of the text], and we have mentioned the\n  cause thereof.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Thanks.</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago I was having a debate with born-again Christians (they were trying to convert me -- I'm not Jewish and am an atheist) and I put a question to them which I've often used in other similar situations and is one that is of genuine interest to me: why did G-d (for those who think he/she exists) design the current Universe the way he did -- given that there is so much suffering in the world?</p>\n\n<p>The example I often use is one that is very disturbing to me: when the Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele was conducting experiments on human children by boiling them alive -- why didn't G-d immediately intervene? If I understand the faculties ascribed to G-d according to most religions, he/she has infinite power, wisdom, transcends time. Why did he not design a universe that for example had protection systems for the weak. Like in science fiction movies a force field would protect the weak from the tormentor. I'm using this phrasing to conduct a though experiment -- an alternate design could have been where there was no human suffering.</p>\n\n<p>So the question: does Judaism address this question of human suffering? Would appreciate it if I could get some insights that can be understood by a layman like me.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n<p>Notes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I realize that this may be related to the question on why G-d allows evil to exist like the one asked <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9170/why-does-evil-exist\">here</a> -- but here is how mu question is different. One can suffer even in the absence of evil -- like say being burned in a car crash. On the the other hand a universe with safety mechanisms would prevent suffering even if evil existed.</li>\n<li>Regarding the note that: it's really G-d's choice how he/she wishes to design the universe -- I would again assume that G-d, one who has compassion and love would not choose a Universe with suffering -- I mean I'm a mere defective mortal and given the choice, even I would not choose a Universe with suffering</li>\n<li>On the note that it is irrelevant to those who suffer regarding what type of a universe they would prefer to live in (since they are not G-d) -- my submission would be that ethically (at least according to human ethics) the affectee, especially someone who is the lesser power-wise should have a say, especially since the suffer never really asked to be created or was given a choice in that matter and he/she has a frail existence vis-a-vis someone like G-d. So IMHO, yes they should have a say in the design of the Universe if they are going to be at the receiving end of suffering</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks.  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Before one can understand why the world is the way it is, he must first understand what is its purpose.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Chaim_Luzzatto\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ramchal</a> and others teach that the purpose of this world is to act as an environment where human free will can function.

Here's a key passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוה להו למיזן עשרים וחד שתא הוו בהו הנהו בריוני אמרו להו רבנן ניפוק ונעביד שלמא בהדייהו לא שבקינהו אמרו להו ניפוק ונעביד קרבא בהדייהו אמרו להו רבנן לא מסתייעא מילתא קמו קלנהו להנהו אמברי דחיטי ושערי והוה כפנא</p>\n<p>Jerusalem had enough stores of food to withstand a siege for years. But there were <em>Biryonei</em> in the city. [Rashi: <em>Biroynei</em> are \"empty people who rush to war.\" Let's translate \"militants.\"] The rabbis wanted to go out and make peace with the Romans, but the militants wouldn't let them. The militants wanted to go wage war against the Romans, but the rabbis told them it wouldn't succeed. So the militants got up and burned Jerusalem's food stores, and then there was famine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A few lines further down:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבא סקרא ריש בריוני דירושלים בר אחתיה דרבן יוחנן בן זכאי הוה שלח ליה תא בצינעא לגבאי אתא א\"ל עד אימת עבדיתו הכי וקטליתו ליה לעלמא בכפנא א\"ל מאי איעביד דאי אמינא להו מידי קטלו לי א\"ל חזי לי תקנתא לדידי דאיפוק אפשר דהוי הצלה פורתא</p>\n<p>\"Daddy Dagger\", the head of the Jerusalem militants, was the nephew of Chief Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai, and secretly met with the rabbi. \"How much longer can you keep doing this and kill everyone by famine?\" -\"What can I do, Uncle Yochanan? [The militants call me the leader but] if I say anything, they'll kill me too!\" \"See if you can arrange for me to get out of Jerusalem [and negotiate], maybe I can still save something.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Around the year 130, Rabbi Akiva supported Bar Kochba's revolt against the Romans in Beitar. The revolt stood a good chance of succeeding strategically, and thus Rabbi Akiva felt that this could in fact be a final war in which Bar Kochba could be the Messiah.</p>\n<p>In broad strokes, those who believe in negotiated surrender will point to Raban Yochanan ben Zakai's actions, and those who believe in conflict will point to Rabbi Akiva's words.</p>\n<p>The truth is, lo and behold, both could be right: you fight when you have a fighting chance, and don't when you don't. Rabbi Hershel Schachter shlit'a, for instance, has remarked that the Talmud intentionally omits the Masada conflict because they fought when there was no rational chance of winning. His approach to the question of land-for-peace, as appeared in the <em>Journal of Halacha & Contemporary Society</em> in the 1980s, is that two questions must be asked: what are the rational chances that armed conflict will succeed in a non-miraculous way, and what's the definition of \"success\"?</p>\n<p>The question then becomes how to assess a given situation ... and that's beyond the scope of this site.</p>\n<p>The other question becomes what methods are used; the Talmud is making it quite clear that by forcing a famine and killing moderate voices, the Sicarii were automatically in the wrong. (Bar Kochba himself goes south when he gets paranoid and kills a rabbi based on a flimsy rumor that he's a Roman sympathizer.) As Elie Wiesel has put it: \"irrespective of whether theoretically the ends justify the means -- if you employ certain means, that fundamentally changes the ends.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Ramba\"n, particularly, relates all the other terms (\"good\" and \"wide\") towards describing the \"milk and honey\" concept. I.e. - the good and wide land has fresh air which is good for the animals to make lots of milk. Also, that the fruits are fat and sweet until the honey flows out from them.</p>\n\n<p>If I recall correctly, some place in the Talmud, this pharse is taken literally, i.e., that there was a flow of milk and honey. I don't recall where this is.</p>\n\n<p>If this is to be a metaphor, why does the Torah use this metaphor rather than stating more directly, something like \"a land with good air for the animals and sweet fat fruits\" or something similar that's not metaphoric?</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, why focus on these two qualities in particular? The land has many other fine qualities. (Yes, in <em>Ekev</em> it talks about 7 species, iron and copper. But the more dominant phrase that we see is \"a land flowing with milk and honey\".) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Kesuvos 111b: (Art Scroll 11b5) has the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rami bar Yechezkel traveled to Bnai Brak.

[Rami bar Yechezkel] said\n  This is a [literal] flowing with milk and honey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The gemara then quotes Reish Lakish and Rabbah bar bar Chanah as having seen similar sights.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/624194/jewish/Why-is-Israel-called-the-land-of-Milk-and-Honey.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Why is Israel called the land of \"Milk and Honey\"?</a> explains how this particular metaphor is used because it shows the unusual fertility and richness of the land.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1) Nachmanides <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9864/jewish/Chapter-3.htm#v=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmos 3:8</a> writes that the key word in the verse is \"flowing.\"\n  Fruit trees grow in many different terrains, but their produce\n  overflow with nectar only when the land is especially fertile, when\n  the trees are particularly well-nourished.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, livestock survives in many habitats, but only overflow with\n  milk when they are in particularly fertile pastures.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, a \"land flowing with milk and honey\" is indicative and\n  symptomatic of a greater good—the fertility of the Promised Land.</p>\n  \n  <p>2) The Midrash (Yalkut Shimoni Proverbs 8:943) explains that milk symbolizes superior quality,\n  richness of taste, and nourishment. Honey represents sweetness. The\n  goodness of Israel is both nourishing and pleasant.</p>\n  \n  <p>3) Some point out that honey and milk share a paradoxical quality.\n  Honey is kosher, though it is produced by a non-kosher insect. Milk is\n  kosher, though it comes from a domestic animals such as cows whose meat may not be eaten together with milk.</p>\n  \n  <p>The goodness of Israel will often times come from places where it is\n  least expected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the analogy references cows as an example because that is what we normally drink today. It also applies to sheep or goats (which is what are referenced in kesuvos).\nRav Hirsch on the expression explains that the significant word is zavas, which implies <strong>unnatural</strong> flowing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is very characteristic that the abundance of produce by zov only\n  occurs in reference to Eretz Yisrael (the land of Israel). In Tanakh,\n  the word zov never means overflowing. It occurs mainly to describe a\n  human pathological condition, and otherwise as a flowing forth caused\n  by miraculous power. It does not seem to describe a land that develops\n  the abundance in accordance with its natural fertility, but a land\n  that only does this under special conditions. Palestine is a hard\n  land which can only blossom and flourish ‘under the continuous\n  special care of God for it, from one end of the year to the other.’\n  When it gets water, it blossoms luxuriously. But it only gets the\n  water from above.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was B'nai Yisra'el really rebellious the entire 40 years (Devarim 9:7)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Deuteronomy 9:7 says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זְכֹר֙ אַל־תִּשְׁכַּ֔ח אֵ֧ת אֲשֶׁר־הִקְצַ֛פְתָּ אֶת־יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ\n  בַּמִּדְבָּ֑ר לְמִן־הַיּ֞וֹם אֲשֶׁר־יָצָ֣אתָ ׀ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֗יִם\n  עַד־בֹּֽאֲכֶם֙ עַד־הַמָּק֣וֹם הַזֶּ֔ה מַמְרִ֥ים הֱיִיתֶ֖ם עִם־יְהוָֽה׃</p>\n  \n  <p>(modified Sefaria.org translation)</p>\n  \n  <p>Remember, don't forget, how you angered the LORD your God in the\n  wilderness; from the day that you left the land of Egypt, until you\n  came to this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Several points at both ends of the time spectrum, mentioned. There doesn't appear to be any mentioning in the Torah that they rebelled against G-d on the day that they left Egypt. As a matter of fact, contrarily, it says that they cooperated (See, for example, Exodus 12:50.) When they were in the desert before crossing the Sea of Reeds, G-d commands them to turn back and camp at <em>Pi Hahirot</em>, and they obeyed. (Exodus 14:4).</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps, their first \"test\" of G-d occurred after they crossed the Sea of Reeds. Would that be considered \"rebellion\"? </p>\n\n<p>Then, Moses implies that the rebellion happened constantly during the entire 40 years in the desert. The last \"rebellion\" we see mentioned is in Numbers, beginning chapter 25, where they followed the daughters of Mo'ab and worshiped idols.</p>\n\n<p>There was a long period in the desert after that. The Torah does not mention much about what happened during about 38 years in the desert. Were they rebelling in the desert the whole time?</p>\n\n<p>In short, is Moses claim to be taken literally? See a related statement that Moses says a bit later in the same chapter Deuteronomy 9:24:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מַמְרִ֥ים הֱיִיתֶ֖ם עִם־יְהוָ֑ה מִיּ֖וֹם דַּעְתִּ֥י אֶתְכֶֽם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew\n  you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to be a harsher claim than the one before as it extends the time to even before they left Egypt!</p>\n\n<p>Are Moses claims to be taken literally? What did he mean by stating this? Esp. in the 2nd statement of Moses; how did they rebel against G-d while they were still enslaved, which is about the time Moses \"knew them\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinchas_Horowitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Panim Yafot</a> (Deut. 9:5) relates the sinfulness from the point they left Egypt to Exodus (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.13.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">13:17</a>) which states that God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, lest they return to Egypt. This was reflective of a sinful lack of faith on the part of the Israelites early on.</p>\n\n<p>He relates the sinfulness from the day Moshe knew them, to the incident in Exodus (2:14) in which one Hebrew was striking another, and then attempted to intimidate Moshe who tried intervening. This may may have been indicative of more of a systemic behavioural problem among them. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה שאמר למן היום אשר יצאת מארץ מצרים וגו', היינו מ\"ש [שמות יג, יז] ולא נחם אלהים דרך ארץ פלשתים כי אמר אלהים פן ינחם, הרי שהיה גלוי וידוע לפני הש\"י שאין אמונתם שלימה...ממרים הייתם עם ה' מיום דעתי אתכם...כמו שפירש\"י בפרשת שמות [ב, יד]...בשביל שהם דלטורין, </p>\n  \n  <p>That which he said 'from the day that you left Egypt', refers to what\n  is written (Exod. 13:17) 'God did not lead them by way of the land of\n  the Philistines, although it was nearer; for God said, “The people may\n  have a change of heart when they see war, and return to Egypt.”' It\n  was clear to God that their faith was not complete...as Rashi explains</p>\n  \n  <p>You have been rebellious with God since the day I knew you...as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Exodus.2.14.3?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Exodus.2.14.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi\n  explains in Exodus (2:14)</a>...for they had informers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As noted by @ShmuelBrown, this explanation for the sinfulness \"from the day I knew you\" is basically stated by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Isaac_Bekhor_Shor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bekhor Shor</a> as well in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.9.24?lang=bi&p2=Bekhor_Shor,_Deuteronomy.9.24.1-10.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to 9:24</a>, as well as the Hadar Z'kenim there. Unlike the Panim Yafot, though, the Bekhor Shor and Hadar Z'kenim do not imply that this was part of a systemic problem, rather than an isolated incident.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the rest of the forty years, The Tur implies somewhat that they were literally sinning continuously throughout the forty years in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.9.24?lang=bi&p2=Kitzur_Baal_Haturim_on_Deuteronomy.9.24.1-10.6&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">short commentary to 9:24</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הפסוק מתחיל במ''ם ומסיים במ''ם לומר לך שכל מ' שנה שהייתם במדבר ממרים הייתם</p>\n  \n  <p>The verse begins with a 'mem' and ends with a 'mem' to tell you that all forty years that you were in the wilderness, you were rebellious with God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

That would make for a very long weekday reading, so perhaps, this was not done b/c of <em>tircha d'tzibbur</em>?</p>\n\n<p>I viewed the parsha (meaning \"paragraph\" as it is written in a Torah scroll) breakup of the beginning of Va'etchanan, as we need to assure that there are at least 3 verses available to be read before a paragraph break. </p>\n\n<p>There is a <em>petucha</em> (\"open\" paragraph break) after Devarim 3:28. The reading begins at 3:23.

    "content": "# Are Esau/Edom and Yishmael included among the 70 nations?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We all know that all the people on the earth came actually of 70 nations (even though lots of them became mixed recently).</p>\n\n<p>And we all know that every one of these nations has an angel to guard it. Basically, Yishmael and Edom are not among these 70 nations (Or at least that's what the appendixes in the Artscroll English Tanach shows). But, from commentaries we know that Edom's angel is Satan and Yishmael has its own angel too (the case when its angel came to G-d saying that Yishmael also deserve a share in the holy land since his circumcision was higher than Yitzhak's).</p>\n\n<p>SO how Yishmael and Edom has their own angels if they are not among the 70 nations ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Note that the definition of the seventy nations occurred in the Dor Hahaflagah (dispersion after the Migdal Bavel). As a result, the nations of Moav, Ammon, Yishmael, and Edom would not have been in existence at that time. I have seen references to the Vilna Gaon, such as in <a href=\"http://nefeshchaim.blogspot.com/2007/05/70-nations-and-matan-torah.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nefesh Hachaim</a> and <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ulXZod711MgC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=yishmael+70+nations&source=bl&ots=dsTVK5ud2Q&sig=0nzTEkzbDfApMo51akBLZyrn4Ys&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBWoVChMI14_v_fyUxwIVyls-Ch3qjAnL#v=onepage&q=yishmael%2070%20nations&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this reference</a> that the reference to ruling over 35 each, means that those two were not part of the seventy.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we see at <a href=\"http://hebrewnations.com/articles/gis/keturah.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ishmael, Esau, Keturah</a> that Ammon Moav, Yishmael, Edom, and Bnai Yisrael as descendants of Terach would have been included in the \"nation\" that Terach was part of but were separated as completely \"new\" nations. Hashem would have given them a malach in order to allow them to exist as individual nations. The meforshim speaking of the \"gifts\" of bnai Keturah express this as the \"spiritual\" gifts. </p>\n\n<p>When Hashem says that He is in charge of Bnai Yisrael, the implication is that He has appointed a malach for the other members of the family. We also see this, when Hashem says that He will send a malach with Bnai Yisrael in the midbar until Moshe Rabbeinu prays that He Himself will continue to guide them.</p>\n\n<p>The implication to this is that no nation can exist unless it has a malach corresponding to that nation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Midrash Tanchuma gives the following statement of R' Levi on Chayei Soroh:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אָמַר רְבִי לֵוִי, הוּא שֶׁאָמַר לוֹ הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא,\n  וְנִבְרְכוּ בוֹ כֹּל גּוֹיֵי הָאָרֶץ, שֶׁיָּצָא הַיָּם בְּדוֹר\n  הַפְלָגָה וְהֵפִיץ מִבְּנֵי חָם שְׁלֹשִׁים מִשְׁפָּחוֹת, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר:\n  וַיָּפֶץ ה' אֹתָם. אָמַר לוֹ הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא,\n  מִמְּךָ אֲנִי מַעֲמִידָן, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וְנִבְרְכוּ בוֹ כֹּל גּוֹיֵי\n  הָאָרֶץ. הֶעֱמִיד מִשְׁפָּחוֹת, וְאֵלּוּ הֵן שְׁנֵים\n  עָשָׂר נְשִׂיאִים שֶׁהֶעֱמִיד מִיִּשְׁמָעֵאל, וְשִׁשָּׁה עָשָׂר\n  מִכָּאן וּשְׁנֵי גוֹיִם בְּבִטְנֵךְ. הֱוֵי אוֹמֵר, וְנִבְרְכוּ בוֹ\n  כֹּל גּוֹיֵי הָאָרֶץ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, the answer is that they replaced nations from the 70 nations and would most probably be counted as such until today (or at least until Sancheiriv ruined it all but that's an answer to another question.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Persia will completely annihilate Edom which will cause moshiach to come\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard that in a passage in the Talmud it says Persia will completely annihilate Edom and the rest of the world which will then spur about moshiach' arrival,  the Yalkut Shimoni (Yeshaya 60:499), records the following amazing but scary prophecy regarding the events that will unfold just prior to the Messianic Era: “Rabbi Yitzchak said: The year in which the King Messiah reveals himself [to all of mankind], all the nations of the world will be fighting with each other. The King of Paras [Persia] will fight with the King of Arabia, and the King of Arabia will go to Aram [Syria] to seek counsel from them. The King of Paras will [attempt to] destroy the entire world, and all the nations of the world will be screaming and confused and falling on their faces, and they will experience pains like those of a woman giving birth. The Jewish people will also be screaming and confused, and will say, ‘To where shall we come and go? To where shall we come and go?’. And G-d will say to them, ‘My children - don’t be afraid - for all that I have done, I only did for your sake. Why are you afraid – the time for your redemption has come!, my question is what weapon of choice will Persia use to bring about this result.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I am not aware of any passage in the Talmud that says Persia will completely annihilate Edom and the rest of the world will then spur about the arrival of Moshiach.</p>\n<p>I think whoever you heard this from may be mistaken and the source that he is misunderstanding is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.10a.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 10</a> where there is recorded a machloket over whether Rome will fall into the hands of Persia or Persia will fall into the hands of Rome:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבָּה בַּר בַּר חָנָה אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן מִשּׁוּם רַבִּי\nיְהוּדָה בְּרַבִּי אִלְעַאי: עֲתִידָה רוֹמִי שֶׁתִּפּוֹל בְּיַד\nפָּרַס, קַל וָחוֹמֶר: וּמָה מִקְדָּשׁ רִאשׁוֹן שֶׁבְּנָאוּהוּ בְּנֵי\nשֵׁם וְהֶחְרִיבוּהוּ כַּשְׂדִּיִּים — נָפְלוּ כַּשְׂדִּיִּים בְּיַד\nפָּרְסִיִּים. מִקְדָּשׁ שֵׁנִי שֶׁבְּנָאוּהוּ פָּרְסִיִּים\nוְהֶחְרִיבוּהוּ רוֹמִיִּים — אֵינוֹ דִּין שֶׁיִּפְּלוּ רוֹמִיִּים\nבְּיַד פָּרְסִיִּים?</p>\n<p>Similarly, Rabba bar bar Ḥana said that Rabbi\nYoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai: Rome is\ndestined to fall into the hands of Persia. This is derived by means of\nan a fortiori inference: Just as the First Temple, that the\ndescendants of Shem built it and the Chaldeans destroyed it, and in\nturn the Chaldeans, ruled by Belshazzar, fell to Persians, ruled by\nDarius the Mede and his son-in-law Cyrus the Persian; the Second\nTemple, that the Persians built it and the Romans destroyed it, is it\nnot right that the Romans will fall into the hands of the Persians?</p>\n<p>אָמַר רַב: עֲתִידָה פָּרַס שֶׁתִּפּוֹל בְּיַד רוֹמִי. אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ\nרַב כָּהֲנָא וְרַב אַסִּי לְרַב: בָּנוֹיֵי בְּיַד סָתוֹרֵי?! אֲמַר\nלְהוּ: אִין, גְּזֵירַת מֶלֶךְ הִיא. אִיכָּא דְאָמְרִי, אֲמַר (לֵיהּ):\nאִינְהוּ נָמֵי הָא קָא סָתְרִי בֵּי כְנִישְׁתָּא.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Rav\nsaid: Persia is destined to fall into the hands of Rome. Rav Kahana\nand Rav Asi, Rav’s students, said to Rav: The builders will fall into\nthe hands of the destroyers? Is that justice? He said to them:\nAlthough it seems unjust, yes, that is the King’s decree. Some say\nthat he said this to them: They, too, are destroyers of synagogues,\nand they are no better than the Romans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here we see that according to the opinion that Rome will fall into the hands of Persia the weapon of choice that Persia will use is their merit that they built the Second Temple whereas Rome destroyed it.</p>\n\n\n",

For purposes of my question, please dispel personal bias, if you can, and answer only as it relates to the concern / reason, here.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Eruvin.96a.43?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tosfot in Eruvin 96a</a> (excerpt):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונראה לפרש דטעמא למ\"ד דלא הוי רשות משום דתפילין צריכין גוף נקי ונשים\n  אין זריזות ליזהר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation (<em>please edit if inaccurate</em>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It seems that the according to the one that states that it (mitzvah of\n  tefillin) is not optional, states this because the wearing of tefillin\n  requires a clean body, and women are not fastidious (regarding this).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Refer also to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14090&st=&pgnum=35\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yam Shel Shlomo Kiddushin 1:64</a> (it's about midway in the right column where he explains the situation of Michal daughter of Saul who wore Tefillin). He states the same thing but adds that the reason the rabbis did not object to Michal wearing tefillin is that she was the daughter of a king, a highly righteous woman, and could not have children.</p>\n\n<p>Neither commentary explains exactly what the real concern with women not being able to keep their body clean. Was it specifically related to menstruation / oozing blood, or were there other concerns? I'm, basically, trying to get an understanding of what the definition of \"guf naki\" really means, and what specifically would discourage women from being able to wear tefillin because of this problem.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I'll preface this ridiculously long answer by echoing the OP of answering with disinterest.  </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara only ever uses the term <em>guf naki</em> when discussing someone putting on <em>tefillin</em>. There are two main ways that the Talmudic sages and broader rabbinic literature have understood the term \"a clean body\": </p>\n\n<h2>As a Spiritual Condition</h2>\n\n<p>For the <em>Meiri</em> (<em>Beit HaBechirah</em>, Brakhot. 14b) the meaning of a \"clean body\" goes beyond physical issues (i.e., sleeping, dirtiness) to include a kind of spiritual cleanliness: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהן צריכין גוף נקי מעבירות ומהרהורים ואין ראוי להניחם אלא לאחר התשובה וקצת חכמים נוהגים להניחם בימים שבין ר\"ה ליום הכפורים אחר התשובה והטבילה והוודויין וכן הדבר נכון בעיני</p>\n  \n  <p>...that they need a \"clean body\" from transgression and impure thoughts, and so it is not proper to put on <em>tefillin</em> until after one's repentance. And there was a custom for a few of the sages to put on <em>tefillin</em> during the Days of Awe (between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) after repenting, immersing in a mikveh, and saying <em>vidduy</em>, and this is the proper way in my opinion. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This definition goes beyond Talmudic sages Abaye and Rava's interpretation that people wearing \"<em>tefillin</em> require a clean body like Elisha, the man of wings\" (Shabbat 49a), which they respectively understand to mean an avoidance of flatulence and sleep (the latter being a time when flatulence and other unclean states occur). For the <em>Meiri</em>, the story of Elisha would suggest that righteous people, or those who become righteous through proper repentance, are the kind of people fit for wearing <em>tefillin</em>.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <em>Maharshal</em> (<em>Yam Shel Shlomo Kiddushin</em> 1:64), this is part of why the sages did not protest Michal, the daughter of King Saul, because she was a \"completely righteous person.\" For the Maharshal, then, having \"a clean body\" partly involves being a righteous person. <em>Arukh HaShulchan</em> (OC 38) similarly identifies \"a clean body\" as a physical, yet <em>also</em> spiritual, state, writing that Michal was righteous, and most women don't meet the requirements. </p>\n\n<h2>As a Physical Condition</h2>\n\n<p>Most rabbinic scholarship, however, understands \"a clean body\" in the simpler sense of meaning a tangible, physical condition of cleanliness, related to the standards of avoiding filth during the time of prayer. This follows the Talmudic understanding of the term, which implies a more achievable state for the individual. Regarding women, some have understood the problem with maintaining \"a clean body\" to be related to menstrual blood (cf. <em>Maharam</em> in <em>Tashbetz</em> 270). Such an argument appears to be about the issue of getting menstrual blood on the body, but this is hardly spelled out. </p>\n\n<p>Instead, many poskim writing about women and <em>tefillin</em>, repeat Tosafot's wording that women  \"are not diligent about maintaining a clean body,\" without going into detail about what the problem entails (cf. <em>Kol Bo</em> 21; <em>Eliyah Rabba</em> OC 38:2; Mishnah Berurah OC 38:3, note 13).</p>\n\n<p>Even though the nature of this cleanliness is seldom specified, some have written that this physical condition has to do with a cultural period of women being less hygienic than men. <em>Eliyah Rabba</em>, for example, writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולי מסתבר דדורות אחרונים החמירו בזה, כי ראו שאין הנשים בזמן הזה זריזות כל כך, לכן החמירו למחות בכולן שלא יצא תקלה ממנו:</p>\n  \n  <p>It seems to me that being stringent in the later generations [after the Talmudic era] has to do with the fact that <strong>women these days are not so diligent</strong> [about cleanliness], and this is why there is a stringency to protest their wearing <em>tefillin</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This implies that women can potentially attain \"a clean body,\" and <em>Magen Avraham</em> (OC 38:3) says as much:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מפני שצריכין גוף נקי ונשים אינם זריזות להזהר אבל אם היו חייבים לא היו פטורין מה\"ט דהוי רמי אנפשייהו ומזדהרי כנ\"ל דלא כע\"ת</p>\n  \n  <p>[We protest] because they need a clean body and women are not diligent about being careful. But if they were obligated to wear tefillin, they wouldn't be exempt for this reason. Rather, they would need to take the risk and be more careful [to maintain a clean body].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n<p>\"A clean body\" may mean some kind of spiritual requirement to be like Elisha (who was righteous enough to have miracle protect him from a Roman guard). If so, than this difficult-to-quantify level may be a further limiting factor for people already not obligated in the mitzvah. Alternatively, \"a clean body\" could be a general term for physical states of uncleanliness (e.g., flatulence, feces, etc.), and/or particular to women (i.e., menstrual blood on the body), which may hinder women from wearing <em>tefillin</em> because they were once, apparently, less diligent in its maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>For practical application, CYLOR and perhaps, your personal hygienist. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>that it is regarding <strong>flatulence</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_49.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tractate Shabbath 49A</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R.

A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaestor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">quaestor</a> saw him:\n  he fled before him, and the latter gave pursuit. As he overtook him,\n  he [Elisha] removed them from his head and held them in his hand,\n  'What is that in your hand?' he demanded, 'The wings of a dove,' was\n  his reply. He stretched out his hand and the wings of a dove were\n  found therein. Hence he is called 'Elisha-the-man-of-the-wings.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<em><a href=\"http://halakhah.com/rst/moed/12e%20-%20Shabbos%20-%20130a-157b.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">halakhah.com Soncino translation</a></em>)</p>\n\n<p><sup><sub>See Tosfos and other commentators there for discussion as to the permissibility/obligation that Elisha had to risk his life for tefillin.</sub></sup></p>\n\n<p>Did the tefillin really turn into dove's wings, or was it just an illusion that fooled the quaestor? If they really <em>did</em> turn into dove's wings, did they turn back into tefillin after?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Ateres Yehoshua (רב יהושע קרלנשטיין) offers a unique perspective on the Sugya: The wings never turned back to Tefilin because Hashem doesn't perform miracles without purpose. He also offers an insightful explanation for the enduring moniker \"Elisha, Man of Wings,\" a distinction rarely granted to other sages who experienced miraculous events. Elisha's name endured to ensure that no one would misconstrue the miracle as a mere illusion. Instead, it served as a reminder that he was indeed left with the wings while his Tefilin were lost, solidifying the authenticity of the divine intervention.</p>\n\n\n",

The ananei hakavod took care of the snakes and scorpions. It was intrinsically a land in which thirst was a major danger, because of the heat and dehydration that would occur,  <em>and</em> there were no oases in which they could stock up on water for the next leg of their journey. Additionally, the lack of water also caused an increase of danger from the snakes and scorpions as seen in the second quote below. That is, besides thirst, the lack of water caused a the danger of the scorpions to increase and be more deadly.</p>\n\n<p>For example [Yeshivat Har Etzion PARASHAT EIKEV by Rav Ezra Bick]\n(<a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/vbm/english/parsha/45eikev.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://etzion.org.il/vbm/english/parsha/45eikev.htm</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This picture of the desert is clearly depicted in the second section.\n  \"... the great and terrible desert - snake, serpent, and scorpion, a\n  thirst without water.\" The physical conditions of the desert are that\n  life cannot be sustained - there is no water, and if there is\n  anything, it is snake, serpent and scorpion. You of course had water,\n  and never met a scorpion, so that YOU lacked nothing, but the desert\n  lacked everything. This, I think, is the proper meaning of the\n  repeated phrase, \"which your fathers did not know.\" Manna is not known\n  to your fathers - in other words, it is not food. The difference\n  between wheat and manna is not one of local habit; it is not the\n  difference between pizza in Italy and felafel in Beirut. Manna is not\n  the food of Sinai - it is unknown, never known, neither to you nor to\n  your fathers. There was NO FOOD IN SINAI - but you ate anyway, because\n  human existence is not dependent on the habitat, or on one's bank, or\n  flocks, but on the utterances of God's mouth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishcontent.org/weekly/w10/46.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>QUESTION</strong></a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why is Hashem's leading the Jews through a wilderness with all sorts\n  of snakes and his bringing forth water from the rock, mentioned in the\n  same pasuk?</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>ANSWER</strong>: The Gemara (Berachot 33a) relates that in a certain city\n  people were being harmed by a snake. When they informed Rabbi Chanina\n  ben Dosa about this, he asked to be shown the snake's burrow. He put\n  his heel over it, and when the snake came out and bit him, it died.\n  According to the Jerusalem Talmud (Berachot 5:1), a spring of water\n  had miraculously opened under Rabbi Chanina's heel and that sealed the\n  fate of the snake, for when a snake bites a person, if the person\n  reaches water before the snake, the snake will die, but if the snake\n  reaches water first the person will die.</p>\n  \n  <p>Describing the miracles Hashem performed for the Jewish people in the\n  wilderness, the Torah states, \"Who leads you through a great and\n  awesome wilderness, of snakes, fiery serpents, and scorpions, and\n  thirst where there was no water.\" These conditions were extremely\n  dangerous since they were likely to be bitten by snakes in places\n  where water was not available.

    "content": "# Why \"בשלמא לרבי יוחנן\" on שבת דף סט ע״א?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Various types of <em>m'lacha</em> (labor) are forbidden on the sabbath, and the punishment is a particular form of death called <em>kares</em> (if the perpetrator doesn't get killed by a human-run court). However, if the act was done in <em>sh'gaga</em> (error), the perpetrator need only repent and bring an animal offering to the Temple in Jerusalem. <a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=260\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The <em>Talmud Bavli</em>, <em>Shabas</em> 69 <em>amud</em> 1</a>, cites a dispute between <em>Rabi Yochanan</em> and <em>Resh Lakish</em> as to what is considered a <em>sh'gaga</em> in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Rabi Yochanan</em> said: whereby he erred about <em>kares</em> [thinking there is none at stake] — even though he was deliberate about the prohibition. [That is, even if the perpetrator remembers the act he's doing is prohibited, but has forgotten about the <em>kares</em> entailed, he won't get <em>kares</em> and needs to offer the animal.]</p>\n<p>And <em>Resh Lakish</em> said: [it's not <em>sh'gaga</em>] until he errs about the prohibition and the <em>kares</em>. [That is, he must have forgotten not only about the <em>kares</em> entailed but about the prohibition altogether for the act to be considered to have been performed in <em>sh'gaga</em>.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Very well. Further along, there's an attempt to prove <em>Rabi Yochanan</em> correct. The Talmud cites a <em>mishna</em> as implying that if one does all thirty-nine categories of <em>m'lacha</em> in one instance of error, he must offer thirty-nine animal offerings. The Talmud then comments that the error in this case must be one of <em>sh'gaga</em> with respect to each <em>m'lacha</em>, and not one of forgetting about the sabbath altogether (because we know from elsewhere that, in the latter case, one would offer only one animal). That is, this person who is bringing thirty-nine animals to the Temple <strong>remembered, when he did his crime, about the sabbath</strong> — but erred about every single one of the categories of <em>m'lacha</em>.</p>\n<p>Consider the oddity of this case. He knew about the sabbath, but — according to <em>Resh Lakish</em> — forgot that planting is forbidden, that dyeing is forbidden, that kneading, that weaving, that shearing are forbidden, and he did every one of those and thirty-four more, and must therefore offer thirty-nine animal offerings.</p>\n<p>Is this even possible? What, after all, is \"knowing about the sabbath\" if not knowing about at least one of its prohibitions?</p>\n<p>That last is the very argument the Talmud uses to prove <em>Resh Lakish</em> wrong.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>This is how it does it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to <em>Rabi Yochanan</em>…, one can find [a case where the person forgot every <em>m'lacha</em> but remembered the sabbath]: for example, that he knew about the prohibition of sabbath [but not the <em>kares</em>]. But according to [<em>Resh Lakish</em>], how did he [forget every <em>m'lacha</em> but] know that it was the sabbath?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now here's my question: I don't understand that \"According to <em>Rabi Yochanan</em>…\" bit. According to <em>Rabi Yochanan</em>, just as according to <em>Resh Lakish</em>, we're looking for a case where the person had <em>sh'gaga</em> with respect to each <em>m'lacha</em> but not with respect to the sabbath altogether. But according to <em>Rabi Yochanan</em> this <em>sh'gaga</em> can be forgetting about the <em>kares</em> alone. So he had <em>sh'gaga</em> about each <em>m'lacha</em>, forgetting it has <em>kares</em> and perhaps forgetting it's prohibited altogether, but <strong>not</strong> about the sabbath. No <em>sh'gaga</em> about the sabbath! That means he didn't forget <strong>even about the <em>kares</em></strong>. He knew there was <em>kares</em> for a sabbath violation, but forgot about every <em>m'lacha</em>. How can that be? The same way the case is seemingly impossible according to <em>Resh Lakish</em>, isn't it seemingly impossible according to <em>Rabi Yochanan</em>? What, after all, is \"knowing about <em>kares</em> for the sabbath\" if not knowing about <em>kares</em> for at least one of its prohibitions?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>[1] It immediately refutes the argument by finding another aspect of the sabbath one can know about, besides one of the prohibitions.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Zadon Shabbos, knowing that it's Shabbos, does not mean that he knows every aspect of Shabbos. It means he knows that it's Shabbos. As Rashi heichi mashkachas lah says, that he knows it's Shabbos. The only thing is that too know it's Shabbos, you need to know at least one biblical law, or else in what way do you know it's Shabbos? We see later in the gemara, it answers for resh lakish that he knew about techum, even though he do doesn't know any of the 39 melachos (techum is d'orayso-but not one of the 39 melachos), it's still zadon Shabbos. \nSo, to address your question, just because he doesn't know that there's kares, he still knows it's Shabbos.\nWe only bring in kares when discussing shigigas melachos, which, according to r' yochanan, you need to know the pratim, also the punishment to be considered zadon melachos.</p>\n\n\n",

The meanings are so different.  Further, various translations are not all in agreement.</p>\n\n<p>Not all translations use the word convert, but many do.

Other translations use the word \"stranger\" for both occurances of the word \"ger\" (e.g., Hertz).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Firstly, many \"precise\" or more literal translations (e.g. the JPS translation) translate this word as \"stranger\" both times.  In truth, it is possible that the meaning of convert comes from the meaning of stranger, since converts come from another nation, and are outsiders to some extent.  When we look at it like that, the translations don't differ so much. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, there is actually an excellent precedent to translate them differently (although perhaps not exactly the way you have seen them translated).  Onkelos here translates this verse as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְתִרְחֲמוּן יָת <strong>גִּיּוֹרָא</strong>, אֲרֵי <strong>דַּיָּירִין</strong> הֲוֵיתוֹן בְּאַרְעָא דְּמִצְרָיִם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see from the bolded terms, the word \"Ger\" has been translated as both Giyora (stranger/convert) and Dayar (a sojourner, or something like that).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta.22.20?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefaria.org</a> translates the first word as \"stranger\" and not \"convert\". I can see that your notion of the word <em>ger</em> means \"convert\" because we tend to call converts \"gerim\". However, use of the word \"ger\" to mean \"convert\" is not a universal translation in Tanac\"h. Often it means \"stranger\", i.e., someone who is a  I.e. a *ger toshav\" or a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proselyte\" rel=\"nofollow\">resident alien</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One reason I state that this is its meaning in this verse, is that Rash\"i, on this verse says, \"Do not remind him of your own blemish\" (paraphrase). Well, we certainly were never Gentiles who \"converted\". But we were strangers living in another land.</p>\n\n<p>See also, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta.22.20?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mechilta 22:20</a> in it he cites uses of the term <em>ger</em> in Tanac\"h that don't mean \"convert. I'm excerpting this from Sefaria's translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Abraham called himself a stranger, viz. (Genesis 23:4) \"A stranger and\n  a sojourner am I with you.\" David called himself a stranger, viz.\n  (Psalms 119:19) \"I am a stranger in the land,\" and (I Chronicles\n  29:15) \"For we are strangers before You and sojourners as all of our\n  ancestors. As a shadow are our days upon the earth, without a\n  prospect.\" And it is written (Psalms 39:13) \"For a stranger am I with\n  You, a sojourner as all of my ancestors.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

You will understand this when you consider that it is permissible to erase a Name written in some other language, such as the word Gott in Yiddish or German\" (to Yoreh De'ah 179, no. 11). For this reason, Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik used to say that \"those who write the English word God in the form G-d do so out of 'total ignorance' (am-ha'aratzut gemurah)... since the English word God is not one of the formal Divine Names but merely a literary device that refers to the Holy One, Blessed be He\"; R. Zvi Schachter, Nefesh Harav (Jerusalem: Reshit Yerushalayim, 1994), 161. True, there are authorities who dispute the Siftei Kohen (see R. Avraham Danzig, Chokhmat Adam 89:9) and who support the custom of writing the Divine Name as G-d (see R. Chaim Ozer Grodzinsky, 20th-century Lithuania, Resp. Achi`ezer 3:32). We, however, following Maimonides and the other scholars we have mentioned, regard that custom as an unnecessary stringency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://ccarnet.org/responsa/rr21-no-5762-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ccarnet.org/responsa/rr21-no-5762-1/</a></p>\n\n<p>Although the information is from Orthodox sources, the website is reform which apparently is problematic. Here are some other sources:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A. Opinion of the Mishnah Berurah. The Mishnah Berurah (85:10) rules\n  that there are no limitations placed on the writing of God’s name in\n  languages other than Hebrew. Indeed, this lenient view is strongly\n  supported by the p’sak of the Shach (Yoreh Deah 179:11) and Achiezer\n  (3:32). Furthermore, a paper that says “God” may be thrown away in the\n  normal fashion. However, the Mishnah Berurah writes that the word\n  “God” should not be uttered in the bathroom or other areas that are\n  unclean and mentioning the word “God” may be a violation of saying\n  God’s name in vain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mishnah brerurah starts the trend of being more stringent on the name being spoken of in vain. However, it is mostly limited to bathrooms, and it \"may\" be saying God's name in vain.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>B. Opinion of Rav Chaim Ozer Grozinski and Rav Akiva Eiger. Not only\n  may the printed word “God” be written and thrown away normally, but the\n  recital of the word “God” does not pose any halachic problem. After all,\n  the status of the written word should be no different than the status of the\n  spoken word.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, if you really want to be stringent in the matter of not saying God's name, then maybe you should follow the talmudic dictum?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Shalom. The gemara (Shabbat 10b) rules that one may not greet his friend\n  with the word “Shalom” in the bathhouse because “Shalom” is one of the\n  names of God. Tosafot (Sota 10a) rules that for this reason one may not erase\n  the word “Shalom”. Although God is also called a “Chanun V’rachum” all\n  agree that these words may be erased because they are descriptions of God\n  rather than the formal name of God. Rosh (Teshuvot Harash 3:15) disagrees\n  with Tosafot and maintains that one may erase the name “Shalom” just as one\n  may erase “Chanun V’rachum”.\n  A. Writing Shalom. \n  1.

The Talmud gives an interesting historical note with regard to one aspect of this. Among the decrees of the Syrians during the persecutions of *Antiochus Epiphanes was one forbidding the mention of the name of God. When the *Hasmoneans gained the victory they not only naturally repealed the decree, but demonstratively ordained that the divine name be entered even in monetary bonds, the opening formula being \"In such and such a year of Johanan, high priest to the Most High God.\" The rabbis, however, forbade this practice since \"tomorrow a man will pay his debt and the bond (with the name of God) will be discarded on a dunghill\" the day of the prohibition was actually made an annual festival (RH 18b). <strong>It is, however, specifically stated that this prohibition refers only to seven biblical names of God</strong>. They are ʾEl, ʾElohim (also with suffixes), \"I am that I am\" (Ex. 3:14), ʾAdonai, the Tetragrammaton, Shaddai, and Ẓeva'ot (R. Yose disagrees with this last, Shev. 35a–b). The passage states explicitly that all other names and descriptions of God by attributes may be written freely. Despite this, it became the accepted custom among Orthodox Jews to use variations of most of those names in speech, particularly ʾElokim for ʾElohim, and Ha-Shem (\"the Name\" and, for reasons of assonance, ʾAdoshem) for Adonai. The adoption of Ha-Shem is probably due to a misunderstanding of a passage in the liturgy of the Day of Atonement, the Avodah. It includes the formula of the confession of the high priest on that day. Since on that occasion he uttered the Ineffable Name, the text has \"Oh, Ha-Shem, I have sinned,\" etc. The meaning is probably \"O [here he mentioned the Ineffable Name] I have sinned,\" and from this developed the custom of using Ha-Shem for ʾAdonai, which is in itself a substitute for the Tetragrammaton (see also Allon, Mehkarim, 1 (1957), 194ff.; S. Lieberman, Tosefta ki-Feshutah (Mo ʾed), 4 (1962), 755). *Shabbetai b. Meir ha-Kohen (first half 17th century) states emphatically that the prohibition of erasure of the divine name applies only to the names in Hebrew but not the vernacular (Siftei Kohen to Sh. Ar., YD 179:8; cf. Pitḥei Teshuvah to YD 276:9), and this is repeated as late as the 19th century by R. Akiva Eger (novellae, ad loc.). Jehiel Michael Epstein, however, in his Arukh ha-Shulhan (ḤM 27:3) inveighs vehemently against the practice of writing the Divine Name even in vernacular in correspondence, calling it an \"exceedingly grave offense.\" As a result the custom has become widespread among extremely particular Jews not to write the word God or any other name of God, even in the vernacular, in full.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11305-names-of-god\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11305-names-of-god</a></p>\n\n\n",

In virtually all cases, the role formerly filled by animal fat is now either unnecessary, or it is filled by either a specially manufactured defoaming agent or a small amount of vegetable oil.  </p>\n\n<p>The defoaming agent, whichever kind is used, is intended to prevent the syrup from foaming up, spilling over the side of the cooking vessel, and potentially causing a fire.  Maple syrup production begins with collecting maple sap.  The sap is almost entirely composed of water, and it is sweet, but very diluted.  The sap is poured into large vessels, then boiled for an extended period of time.  As it boils, the water evaporates, leaving behind the sugar and other compounds that contribute to the flavor of the finished product.  The sugar caramelizes, enhancing the flavor and giving the syrup its distinctive color.  </p>\n\n<p>However, during the cooking process, the sugar begins to foam.  If this foam spills over the top of the vessel and runs down the side, it could reach the heat source and catch on fire.  Is this were to happen, the flames would quickly rise up the side of the vessel and set fire to the entire batch of syrup.  The reasons why this would be very, very bad should be obvious.</p>\n\n<p>But the largest producers of maple syrup don't need to use any defoaming agents, because the cooking vessels are enormous and totally contained, so there is no possibility of spillage.  I'm not sure how a contained (i.e., sealed) vessel can provide venting to allow the water to boil off, but apparently it works.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Throughout the process, excess foam may be skimmed off the surface of the boiling sap and discarded. Many types of materials, such as butter or vegetable oil, have been used to reduce foaming. However, a commercial defoaming agent available in small containers from maple equipment dealers is recommended. The defoamer should be fresh, and only a drop or two is needed. When used in small quantities, defoamers will evaporate without a noticeable trace in the syrup.<br>\n  -  <a href=\"http://maple.dnr.cornell.edu/pubs/maple_syrup_production.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cornell University</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the label says \"100% pure maple syrup\", the only ingredients are maple sap and possibly a touch of defoaming agent or vegetable oil.</p>\n\n<p>Further reading:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I called my home town’s kosher hotline and asked, “Does maple syrup need a hechsher (kosher certification)?”</p>\n  \n  <p>“It’s not absolutely necessary, but it’s better if it does,” was the answer I received from the hotline helper.</p>\n  \n  <p>I was not satisfied with this answer, because I know that syrup producers add a small amount of fat to the boiling sap, which prevents it from boiling over. Could they possibly use lard? Vegetable oil? Cream? Butter? And does the butter make it milchig? Chalav stam? Is the amount of fat so minute that it is considered to be batul ba’shishim, the halacha that states that if an ingredient is 1/60th or less of the total ingredients, it is null and void and is considered to “not exist” in the list of ingredients? I know the 1/60th rule works in accidental cases (let’s say a drop of milk dripped into a huge pot of chicken soup – the soup would still be kosher).

But as to the rest – he excused himself and admitted that he simply didn’t know much about the process, and mirthfully added that he was appointing me as his “delegate” to check out maple syrup production first hand, and report my findings.</p>\n  \n  <p>I started making a few calls to the heimish syrup producers (though truthfully, I doubt there is any sugar producer in Maine who has heard of the word “heimish”). It turns out that very few people use lard as an anti-foaming agent. One fellow uses butter, but he couldn’t tell me which brand of butter. Another guy told me he uses only organic butter, but he didn’t know for sure if it was free of additives. The last place I contacted was most interesting, though until I get there and try it for myself, I can’t tell you if it is the most tasty.</p>\n  \n  <p>Balsam Ridge started, as most of these places do, as a hobby for its husband-and-wife team. They started by tapping only a few trees, and boiling whatever they got in a large metal pot in their wood shed, producing enough for one or two jugs of syrup for themselves. They started giving away small vials to their friends, whose enthusiasm led them to increase production. They bought a big wood-fired evaporator and started cranking out enough syrup so that they could sell a few jugs to passersby. The downside was that the larger evaporator took hours and hours to boil the sap, and it’s not like you can walk away from a giant vat of boiling syrup. The wood fire needed constant tending and stoking. The syrup had to be constantly supervised so that it wouldn’t boil over, and a small amount of fat was added to prevent this – – until it got to just the right point (7 degrees above the boiling point of water) and the right thickness and consistency. It then needed to be immediately filtered and bottled in sterilized containers. Many nights they would finish past midnight and they were just plain exhausted.</p>\n  \n  <p>So a couple of years ago, they bought a giant evaporator that is oil-fired, and can boil 50 gallons of sap an hour. No more midnight sap boils for them! Because the 2′ x 8′ evaporator is so large, and completely enclosed, there is little fear of the sap boiling over; they no longer add any fat or anti-foaming agent to the syrup. So while they don’t have kosher certification, this is one example of a syrup product that is not only kosher, but pareve and truly pure syrup. But how does all this automation and modernization affect the taste? Hopefully your Faithful Reporter will let you know after Maine Maple Syrup Sunday!</p>\n  \n  <p>P.S. I also submitted a query to the OU’s “Webbe Rebbe” online, and got a reply from Rabbi Gold, who I spoke with on the phone to discuss syrup production. He says there are some (including the Nodah BYehuda) that allow for leniency in regards to batul ba’shishim l’hatchila, so it could be that all syrups, even those with questionable fats, could be considered not only kosher, but maybe even pareve.

    "content": "# Can you daven mincha & ma'ariv in shul after making making Kiddush at home on Shabbat eve?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Let's say that you are the only qualified <em>Ba'al Tefilah</em> in a small summer community that has just 1 shul. (Yes, it <strong>does</strong> happen!)</p>\n\n<p>Shabbat starts late (around 8:15 PM, say). You have a disabled child who is on a strict schedule and cannot stay up later. Your wife wants to start Shabbat early so that the family can have the Shabbat meal together before your child most be in bed.</p>\n\n<p>We know that you can't eat or drink before making Kiddush. I also assume that making Kiddush is an acceptance of Shabbat. And, once you have accepted Shabbat, how can you say a weekday <em>mincha</em> afterwards? But the shul is counting on you to say mincha because no one else can do *chazarat hashat\"z\" except you. (Other cong. are old people who can't stand on the bimah for that long.)</p>\n\n<p>What should you do regarding Kiddush & mincha?</p>\n\n<p>Should you say mincha home, make kiddus & eat, go to shul but have everyone else daven mincha for themselves, then you can say <em>Kabalat Shabbat</em> & ma'ariv?</p>\n\n<p>What about saying the <em>Kiddush</em> in shul? Can or should you do that, even though you already made Kiddush at home?</p>\n\n<p>Any other scenario?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When my children were very young, we would eat dinner early (5 or 6) and let them stay up for kiddush after shul. Since it is earlier than the earliest candle lighting, there is no problem with eating. Since it is earlier than the earliest candle lighting time, we could not accept shabbos, and would thus be able to eat, since the meal will not run into the time for accepting shabbos. Additionally, since one has already planned to accept shabbos at a specific time, one can eat earlier without having the problem of \"interfering\" with kabbolas shabbas.</p>\n\n<p>If they are young enough to fall asleep earlier than kiddush, you still had the family meal together. If they are old enough to have kiddush with the family, they still ate and can go to bed immediately after kiddush. They also feel very \"grown up\" to be able to have kiddush.</p>\n\n<p>Note that this was the normal time that we gave the children supper and we would have seudas shabbas after kiddush.</p>\n\n<p>Note the discussion at <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5761/bereishis.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">EATING BEFORE KIDDUSH and HAVDALAH</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The prohibition against eating begins as soon as one \"accepts\"\n  Shabbos, or inevitably at sunset. Women generally \"accept\" Shabbos\n  when they light candles and they should not eat or drink after that.\n  If, however, one is extremely thirsty after lighting candles, she may\n  take a drink until she verbally \"accepts\" Shabbos upon herself(See Da'as Torah 271:4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My wife lets them stay up for candle-lighting which seems to satisfy them. Depending how late it is, you could also let them stay up for <em>kiddush</em>/<em>hamotzi</em> (which we've also done). However, actually eating a full meal with them without accepting Shabbos should be a problem. See <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayyim.249?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Orach Chaim</em> 249:2</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אָסוּר לִקְבֹּעַ בְּעֶרֶב שַׁבָּת סְעֻדָּה וּמִשְׁתֶּה שֶׁאֵינוֹ רָגִיל בִּימֵי הַחֹל, וַאֲפִלּוּ הִיא סְעֻדַּת אֵרוּסִין, מִפְּנֵי כְּבוֹד הַשַּׁבָּת, שֶׁיִּכָּנֵס לְשַׁבָּת כְּשֶׁהוּא תָּאֵב לֶאֱכֹל; וְכָל הַיּוֹם בִּכְלַל הָאִסוּר. <em>הַגָּה: וּסְעֻדָּה שֶׁזְּמַנָּהּ עֶרֶב שַׁבָּת, כְּגוֹן בְּרִית מִילָה אוֹ פִּדְיוֹן הַבֵּן, מֻתָּר, כֵּן נ''ל וְכֵן הַמִּנְהָג פָּשׁוּט.</em> וְלֶאֱכֹל וְלִשְׁתּוֹת בְּלִי קְבִיעוּת סְעֻדָּה, אֲפִלּוּ סְעֻדָּה שֶׁרָגִיל בָּהּ בַּחֹל, כָּל הַיּוֹם מֻתָּר לְהַתְחִיל מִן הַדִּין, אֲבָל מִצְוָה לְהִמָּנַע מִלִּקְבֹּעַ סְעֻדָּה שֶׁנָּהוּג בָּהּ בַּחֹל, מִט' שָׁעוֹת וּלְמַעְלָה. </p>\n  \n  <p>It's forbidden to have a fixed meal (<em>as opposed to a snack</em>) or drinking-party on Friday that isn't usual to a weekday, even if it's an engagement party, in order to honer the Sabbath, that he should enter it hungry; and the entire day is included in this prohibition. <em>Gloss (of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Isserles\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Rama</a>): A meal who's time is (halachically) supposed to be on Friday, e.g. a brit or redemption of firstborn, is allowed, so it seems to me and so is the widespread custom.</em> But to begin eating and drinking without fixing a meal, even a regular meal of the week, is allowed according to the (letter of) the law, but ideally (lit: mitzvah - commandment) one should refrain from fixing a meal that is kept during the week, from nine hours (after sunrise) and onward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(See also the first issue of Hakirah where the editor [admittedly controversially]  <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%201%20Buchman.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">takes issue</a> with the concept of the early shabbos altogether.)</p>\n\n\n",

For example, someone gives a gift from money that had paid ma'aser on it. This is still considered complete income, because you have not paid any money for it. However, see below that you do not need to pay the ma'aser until you actually liquidate (sell) the property and obtain cash for it. Some people will estimate the value and pay ma'aser on the current value so as to establish a \"purchase base\" for future sale, but the Business Halacha citation below would say that it is not required.</p>\n\n<p>Some people will pay the ma'aser for the person that has received a gift (such as a gift to children) or cause an inheritance to \"skip\" a generation (go to grandchildren for example) to prevent the intermediate generation from having to pay ma'aser.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dinonline.org/2013/10/13/maaser-from-inheritance/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maaser from Inheritance</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The fact that somebody has already taken maaser from particular moneys\n  does not have any ramifications for somebody who receives the money as\n  an inheritance, because maaser is a person obligation and doesn’t\n  apply to the money (but to the person).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dinonline.org/2010/11/11/vayeitzei-the%C2%A0basics%C2%A0of%C2%A0maaser%C2%A0kesafim/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Separating Ma’aser from Inheritance and Gifts</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With regard to inheritance, the Pischei Teshuvah (249:1) writes in the\n  name of the Shelah that there is a full obligation of separating\n  ma’aser.

The principle behind the ruling is that the\n  obligation of ma’aser kesafim, unlike the tithing of produce, is\n  incumbent on the person (gavra) rather than the money (cheftza).

The text [Mark 6:3] was originally written in Greek, but the English translation is: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Is not this the craftsman, Jesus, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon?

According to this interpretation, the implication is that Jesus is a bastard, born out of wedlock.</p>\n\n<p>Would this be considered offensive to a Jewish firstborn son in the first century?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I am hesitant because I am not sure this is the right forum for your question or that we can offer a properly sourced answer but until one of those two questions are answered I will suggest the following:</p>\n\n<p>Insofar as it was typical under most circumstances to refer to someone as the son of their father, the deviation from this norm would likely raise question and/or not done for naught.  Consequently it seems reasonable that someone reflected on how this would be received and <em>hypothesized</em> that it would imply a question of paternity. Subsequently this hypothesis was passed along without any indication of its speculative nature.</p>\n\n<p>While this hypothesis isn't entirely unreasonable it is worth emphasizing that it is likely speculative (after all, your asking the question implies your source didn't cite their evidence). Insofar as Joseph is said to have originally intended to divorce Mary quietly (and ultimately married her) it is difficult  imagine that he or Mary chose to publicize any questions about paternity.  The traditional prohibition against remaining married (and \"betrothed\" was a form of marriage that required divorce) to an adulteress (see Mishneh Torah: Gerushin 11:14) would have likely led to Joseph's continued marriage to Mary as taking responsibility for the pregnancy. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, we have to remember that this type of nomenclature is descriptive.  In colloquial use it would make more sense to describe someone as the mother's son when  those listening are acquainted with the mother and not the father (in the same way we would identify someone by their relations today).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, insofar as the author of the selection you have provided did not include the background story about the Nazarene's conception it is hard to imagine he was obliquely referring to it here.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Which blessings should I say before and after eating perogi with potato-and-cheese filling?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi\" rel=\"nofollow\">writes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pierogi ... (... also spelled perogi, pierogy, perogy, pierógi, pyrohy, pirogi, pyrogie, or pyrogy in English or other Slavic languages ...) are dumplings of unleavened dough – first boiled, at which point they can be served with melted butter or various toppings, or then fried with onions – traditionally stuffed with potato filling, sauerkraut, ground meat, cheese, or fruit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Say I buy some frozen pierogi (pierogies, pirogen, perogies) at the grocery store, and I boil them according to the package instructions.  These particular perogies are made of a pasta-like outer dough with a potato-and-cheese stuffing.  Which blessing (b'rachah, bracha, beracha, brocho, berocho, berochoh) should I say before eating them, and which afterwards?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Usually, anything made with flour (other than bread) takes the before-bracha for flour: \"mezonos\".  So, apple pie is made of flour (crust), apples, and sugar, and a usual size serving of apple pie takes the \"mezonos\" before-blessing.  See, for example, <a href=\"http://berachot.org/foods/letter_a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://berachot.org/foods/letter_a.htm</a> for apple strudel or apple pie.</p>\n\n<p>The after-bracha for a perogi depends on how much you ate.  Typically, a serving of perogi will contain enough flour (a k'zayis) so you should say the \"al hamichya\" after-blessing.  If you ate a small piece of perogi, so you did not eat enough flour to warrant \"al hamichya\" but you did eat a k'zayis of perogi, then say the after blessing of \"borei nefashos\".  If you eat less than a k'zais of perogi, and you eat no other foods, then no after-bracha is said.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you eat enough perogi for a full meal, you would not say Bircas Ha'mazon afterward because that blessing is said only on baked goods, not boiled.  (See, for example, <a href=\"http://berachot.org/foods/letter_s.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://berachot.org/foods/letter_s.htm</a> for spaghetti.)</p>\n\n<p>If you fried the perogi (which you did not say you were doing), the situation would become more complicated and less clear.  (It might seem that berachot.org is taking a stand on this based on the entry for fried dough.  But fried dough is really deep fried, which is considered boiling.)</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, it is very difficult to learn the laws of blessings.  For reasons I do not understand, the several presentations of these laws that I have read are confusing in various details.</p>\n\n\n",

On the other hand, it's possible that the knot itself might still be considered \"too strong of a knot\", which even though it's intended to be undone in a short amount of time, would still be forbidden (i.e. <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/Tying-Shoelaces.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tying shoes with a double knot</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/6965/tying-a-tie-on-shabbos\">Tying a Tie on Shabbos</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Koshair#Permissible_knots\" rel=\"nofollow\">Halachipedia</a> citing O.C. 317:5, and other sources, says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"11\">\n  <li>A bow-knot, slipknot, or a single-knot isn’t a true Kesher-bind and is permissible even if it does remain in place for a while.

Informing these statements is the idea that without Shabbat we would become totally subjugated to the material burden of this world. We would work nonstop in order to sustain our bodies and provide them with pleasure; we would forget our divine souls and find it difficult to elevate ourselves toward divine ideals. Our spiritual inclinations would be suppressed and silenced, and we would consequently sink into all the world’s faults and perversions, which are the cause of all calamity. But when one is privileged to connect to Shabbat with all his being, spiritual and material, through Torah study and prayer as well as rest and pleasure, he transcends the world’s flaws and reaches the eternally good world. Thus he is automatically saved from the calamities of this world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems to me that the explanation of the Peninei Halakhah is similair to what the Imrei Emes writes (as described above).</p>\n<p>You ask if this Gemara only applies to one who eats the third meal, or one who eats all three meals.

Whereas others argue that when recited by a non-kohen, the birkat kohanim cannot be seen as a blessing (this is strictly the domain of priests); rather it is considered to be a <em>prayer</em>, בקשה, of the chazzan on behalf of the congregation, and therefore, they respond with כן יהי רצון as is the customary response to a prayer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.127.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 127:10</a> explains that it is because the <em>chazzan</em> is not actually blessing the congregation, which only the <em>kohanim</em> do.

Or just with formal musical concerts and the like.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It does.  Music has always been a huge part of the Jewish liturgical experience, across all cultures of Judaism around the world.  Throughout the centuries, great poets have been composing piyutim and pizmonim -- and they continue still today -- in Hebrew, Aramaic, and their own vernaculars.  Traditionally Jews have not been literate in music, for the most part, with the role of the cantor learned by talent and rote rather than theoretical learning and music theory.  This is no longer true today, thankfully, but it might be one reason why most of the literally thousands of piyutim in our liturgical repertoire don't usually come with tunes attached.</p>\n\n<p>That said, many tunes have been passed down traditionally for centuries -- not really <em>that</em> many centuries, but in the Ashkenazic tradition these melodies are called Misinai, from Sinai.  They include many of the iconic pieces of High Holiday liturgy, like the great Aleinu and Kol Nidrei.  Using the proper melodies for the liturgy in general is actually something halachah is actively concerned with.  It is considered imperative to chant the liturgy or use tunes in the appropriate mode -- which does vary across cultures, but you should stick to the ones used by your own culture.  For example, in Shabbat Shacharit, the proper nusach is to change modes from the Nishmat mode to the Ahavah Rabbah mode at \"shevach\" in El Adon.  Do people do this?  No, not really, but it <em>is</em> the supposed proper nusach.</p>\n\n<p>Plenty of people put on concerts of Jewish music, including instrumental works and chazanut as well as folk songs and bakashot and z'mirot and you name it.  And, of course, modern Jewish institutions train chazanim to use the correct melodies for all of the liturgy.  We may not be allowed to use instruments halachically, but, first, PLENTY of people do so anyway, especially in the Reform communities of the world, and second, we still have our voices!</p>\n\n<p>Also, while the center-right Orthodox establishment may not emphasize music as much as other groups and denominations, the Chasidim are <em>way</em> into music.  The Baal Shem Tov taught that the niggun could elevate the soul spiritually, and his followers, even today, continue to use niggunim in this way.  These niggunim are often written by Rebbes themselves, and it's important that they be sung precisely and with several customs -- for example, usually each strain of the niggun should be sung twice.  (There is a reason, like always, but I don't remember what it is.)  Each Chasidic group has its own melodies, some of which also become popular throughout Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Jews have an immensely rich musical tradition that varies across the world, across denominations, and across the liturgy and Tanach.  Why is music education not stressed in traditional yeshivot?  I don't know.  I didn't go to them.  Maybe it actually <em>is</em> stressed and I just wasn't told -- I know of several schools with strong cantorial programs.  But even if they're mumbling, Jews are always singing.  Z'mirot, nigunim, pizmonim, t'hilim, you name it, we're always singing.  Maybe instrumental music we don't do as much since the Temple is no longer standing, but we haven't stopped singing since.</p>\n\n\n",

Either way it seems undesirable from the remaining sources that he brings i.e. the gravity of the sin of wasting seed from the Talmud and kabbalistic sources. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The response in Dovev Meisharim… writes that Rabbi Yochanan\n  reasoned that also Bnei Noah are not neherag on transgressing [wasting\n  seed] like an Israelite… which is not so according to the Rambam who\n  holds (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.9.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchos Melachim, 9:4</a>) that Bnei Noach are neherag for\n  transgressing [wasting seed]...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>One is not judged by the 613 commandments unless one is born Jewish or formally converts. A non-Jew could feel they have a Jewish soul, but may eat pork aplenty until converting. (In fact, non-Jews are not supposed to observe the Sabbath, which leads to some discussion about whether someone studying for conversion should somehow break his Sabbath observance for five minutes!)</p>\n<p>As for whether it's included in the Seven Noahide commandments -- there's discussion about it, like there is about everything else -- but the simple answer is no, it's not on that list, and therefore it's not something to be concerned about. (See R' Aharon Lichtenstein's book on the Noahide Laws.)</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein OC4:116 (top of p. 208) writes that there is \"no prohibition whatsoever\" for Noahides (<em>lo ne'esar klal</em>), and that the story of Er and Onan was God meting out harsh justice for whatever reasons were appropriate at that particular episode (that particular story was rather complicated!), not the standard textbook punishment.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Mendel Senderovic's <em>Atzei Besamim</em> EH#19 cites Rabbi Feinstein, and points to responsum Chavos Yair 108 and Tosfos Sanhedrin 59b in support of this position as well. (Yes, he also cites other opinions, but is inclined in this direction in his final conclusion.)</p>\n<p>It is important to note that some language you'll find on this subject (\"GREATEST SIN EVER!!! MURDER!!! NO REPENTANCE EVER!!!\") is acknowledged (see for example the Feinstein responsum above) by <em>poskim</em> -- experts on the entire canon of Halacha who deal with lots of real-life questions across the board, not Internet pundits laser-focused on one subject -- as exaggeration, so please take what you read with a grain of salt.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to Guard Your Eyes  Rabbi Morgenstern  (unsure of the source of what he says however):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a maklokes among the achronim on this question.

Some contend that he must fast the number of fasts appropriate to that sin according to the number of transgressions. For example, the number of fasts prescribed in the penances of the Ari for wasteful <strong>emission of semen is eighty-four</strong>. If someone commits this sin ten or twenty times, say, he must fast ten or twenty times eighty-four, and so on in all instances. These sages compare the fasts to thechatat offering required for every instance of violation.</p>\n<p>Others compare fasts to the olah offering brought for neglect of a positive command. Violation of a number of positive commands is atoned for by one olah, as the Talmud explains in Zevachim, ch. I.</p>\n<p><strong>The accepted decision in this dispute is to fast three times the number of fasts prescribed for that specific sin, i.e. 252 for emission</strong>, and similarly for other sins. This is based on an observation in Zohar, end of Noach; as soon as mortal man is guilty one time before the Holy One, blessed be He, he makes an impression ... the third time the stain penetrates from one side through the other... Therefore the number of fasts ought also be three ...</p>\n<p>However, all this applies to the strong and healthy, whose physical vigour would not be sapped at all by repeated fasts, as in the generations of yore. But whoever would be affected by many fasts, and might suffer illness or pain, G-d forbid, as in contemporary generations, is forbidden to engage in many fasts. This ban concerns even sins of excision or execution, and certainly the positive and prohibitory commands that do not involve excision. Instead the measure of fasting is the personal estimate of what he can tolerate without doubt.</p>\n<p>For even in those early Talmudic generations, only the robust who could</p>\n<p>mortify themselves fasted so frequently. But whoever cannot fast and does, is called \"sinner\" in Taanit, ch. I. This applies even to one who fasts for specifically known sins, as Rashi explains there, and we find inZevachim, ch. I, that there is no one of Israel who is not guilty of a positive commandment ...</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that a student of Torah who fasts, sins and is doubly punished, for the weakness resulting from his fast prevents him from studying Torah properly.</p>\n<p><strong>What then is his alternative ? \"Your sin redeem with charity.\" The codifiers of Torah law specified for each fast day of repentance approximately eighteen (coins) .. . The wealthy shall add according to his means</strong> ... See Magen Avraham on laws of Fasts.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, <strong>every man of spirit who desires to be close to G-d, to repair his soul, to return it to G-d with the finest and most preferred repentance, shall be stringent with himself. He should complete, at least once during his life span, the number of fasts for every grave sin incurring death at least, if only death by divine agency. For example, for wasteful emission he should undergo the series of eighty-four fasts once in his life.</strong> He may postpone the fasts until the shorter winter days and fast some ten days or less, for example, in one winter, and complete the series of eighty-four in nine or more years according to his stamina. (Besides, he may also eat a little about three hours before sunrise, and this would still be considered a fa'st, if he so stipulated.)</p>\n<p>For the completion of the mentioned 252, he may fast another four rimes eighty-four until past noon, which the Talmud Yerushalmi considers a fast. In this context, <strong>two half-days are reckoned as one full day</strong>. Naturally, this approach applies to any other sins, for each heart knows its own anguish and desires its vindication.</p>\n<p>There still remain the fasts in excess of the 252, or whatever amount, that he ought to fast in deference to <strong>the more stringent opinion insisting on the appropriate number of fasts for every violation committed, as noted. These may be redeemed with charity, approximating eighteen (coins) for each fast day</strong>. Charity may redeem all other fasts that he should have undergone for sins not entailing death, and even for neglecting a positive command, Torah or Rabbinic, and neglect of \"Torah study which equals them all,\" aaxurding to the number of fasts prescribed by the Ari's penances. (Most of these are noted in Mishnat Chassidim, Tractate Teshuvah.) All of these fasts he may redeem with charity if he cannot mortify himself, as noted.</p>\n<p>Though this might amount to a considerable sum, he need not fear for the injunction, \"Do not distribute more than one fifth.\" These circumstances are not \"distribution\" for charity, since he does this to release himself from fasting and affliction. This is no less necessary than medicine for his body or his other needs.</p>\n<p>The number of fasts enumerated in the above-mentioned penances is exceedingly great. Therefore all who revere the word of G-d are now accustomed to being unstintingly generous with charity, for the prevalent lack of hardihood prevents them from mortifying themselves over much.

    "content": "# May a person daven in a NYC subway car that has a smelly person sitting there?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a saying in NYC:</p>\n\n<p>\"If you're pregnant or elderly, you won't get a seat. But, if you smell bad, you can get a whole subway car.\"</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, the number of (homeless, usually) smelly people found in the NYC subway is increasing. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayyim.79.1?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch O.C. 79:1</a> states that one needs to distance himself 4 amot from excrement. 79:8 says to distance oneself from smelly garbage. Most of the smelly people on the subway smell from B.O.; possibly from urine; possibly from alcohol and possibly from cigarette or \"weed\" smoke. It's neither of the above. Thus, I'm not sure if these rules apply to any type of these foul odors, and I couldn't infer that these apply to even a person that smells from excrement rather than excrement itself that came out of the person. (Some of them smell <strong>like</strong> garbage, BTW, but I wouldn't know if they smell <strong>from</strong> garbage.) </p>\n\n<p>In many of the NYC subway cars, you cannot pass from one car to the next; the doors are locked. Let's say someone was davening, and a smelly person entered the subway car. Can he continue davening?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to @WhyEnBe who states that 4 amot = 8-10 feet. A NYC subway car is significantly longer than this. Technically, one could be sitting more than 4 amot away from the smelly person. However, as implied by my opening paragraph, the bad smell occupies the entire car, typically. So, I'm not sure if the halacha also applies to source of the bad smell being there regardless of the distance you may be from its source.</p>\n\n<p>1/8/18 - Adding to this - Typical NYC subway elevators also smell from urine.

Accordingly, if it is just the stench of sweat, it would be permissible to pray.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it is good to be stringent to not pray around a distractingly bad smell (see Rambam's Hilkhot Tefilla 4:9 based on Eruvin 65a (which mentions the smell of alcohol), and the Meiri's commentary there).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, R. Adir Kohen writes <a href=\"https://www.ykr.org.il/question/11453\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> that since it is permissible to pray in the presence of things which naturally smell bad, it is permissible to pray around people who reek of sweat. However, if the smell is distractingly bad, it is appropriate to be stringent to not pray there.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding prayer around urine, Berakhot (25a) is explicit that prayer around urine is forbidden, although in cases of doubt whether there is urine, one may pray (see Rambam's Hilkhot Tefilla 3:15).</p>\n\n<p>Significantly the Shulhan Arukh (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.79.8?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OH 79:8</a>) does state that it is forbidden to pray around smelly garbage.</p>\n\n\n",

One is the removal of the foreskin and the other is the shedding of ones blood (Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Milah 3:4, Shulchan Aruch, Yorah Deah 268:1,2,5). The foreskin aspect is associated with the covenant of Avraham, that we are his descendants, members of his household and the inheritors of his blessing (Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer 129:20). This is also why all converts are called \"ben (or bat) Avraham\", the children of Avraham.</p>\n\n<p>The second aspect pertaining to the shedding of ones blood in service to HaShem is the idea of personal \"mesirat nefesh\" the dedication of ones life to serving G-d like we say in the Shema, \"with all your heart (both your good nature and your bad inclination), and with all your soul (your life), and with all your might (your wealth). This is also the intention that we say in the Haggadah at Passover when it states twice, \"By your blood you shall live.

This is also the explanation found in the Yalkut Shimoni on Yechezkel 354.</p>\n\n<p>Like it states there quoting from Shemot 12:44, 48, non-Jews and the uncircumcised could not eat from the Korban Pesach at the time of the first redemption.</p>\n\n<p>In this context, the distinction made by the Ittur and the earlier poskim is understood. That even when a non-Jew who has been circumcised by non-Jews comes to convert, he must have the drop of blood taken. Because this is the declaration of his dedication to serving G-d.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How to become observant Jew?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Who would be interested in getting non-observant 39 year old jewish man to become observant?\nI am not-so-young man in need for direction in my life and by becoming Chasidic Jew and observant, might bring a purpose for my life.  My name is Gary Kolas and my e-mail address is: gkolas@yahoo.com  My phone# 310-882-1727.\nPlease, get in touch with me.  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Congratulations on deciding to explore Judaism and become observant. May you be successful!</p>\n\n<p>As the other answer suggested, the simplest way for you to start becoming a chassidic Jew is to contact the nearest Chabad rabbi. This <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/centers/default_cdo/jewish/Centers.htm?gclid=CJqa_bnHrMcCFdKPHwodIkwK8A\" rel=\"nofollow\">handy website</a> will help you find him.</p>\n\n<p>There are many different chassidic sects, but Chabad is the most engaged in outreach. Breslov is also engaged in outreach (see breslev.co.il and <a href=\"http://lazerbrody.typepad.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lazerbrody.typepad.com/</a> for one very active group), but are mainly found in Israel. The rest of the chassidic groups tend to be located mainly in NYC or Israel and are more insular and less involved in outreach, but that doesn't mean one can't join them.</p>\n\n<p>However, keep in mind that from the perspective of traditional (that is to say Orthodox) Judaism, it's more important to be observant of halacha than to be chassidic or not chassidic. The Chofetz Chaim was once asked if he was chassid or a misnaged (opponent of chassidism). He replied that he was neither, since nowhere in the Shulchan Aruch (the code of Jewish law) does it say whether you're supposed to be one or the other.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of what kind of Orthodox Jew you end up becoming (Modern/Centrist Orthodox, Yeshivish, Chassidic, Sephardic, Dati Leumi, etc.), you'll need to learn the basics of observance, and start observing what you can at your own pace (taking things on too fast leads to burnout). Acquire a concise guide to the laws of everyday life, such as Shaarei Halacha by R' Greenwald, and begin studying it. Many websites, such as chabad.org and aish.com, also have helpful guides to basic observances, as well as other areas of Torah study and Jewish thought. Begin studying or corresponding with Orthodox rabbis, so that you can ask any questions that may arise. Eventually, you should find a congregation you feel comfortable in, and move within walking distance.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The best thing to do would be to get in touch with someone from an orthodox community in your area, if that's possible.\nIf you live in an area without an orthodox community, there might still be a 'Chabad House', which is Jewish centres geared to helping people become more observant.\nIf that's not possible either, then you could get in touch with someone online/over the phone.\nYou mentioned Chassidic, so Chabad is probably the Chassidim most into 'outreach'. Breslov also, but you have some very interesting people there.</p>\n\n<p>The trick is to take one step at a time. Overburdening yourself at once will just backfire. The main thing is that you're climbing the ladder, at your own pace.\nWebsites to look at: www.aish.com, www.torahanytime.com, chabad.org</p>\n\n\n",

Again he said to them: 'If the halachah agrees with me, let the stream of water prove it!' Whereupon the stream of water flowed backwards — 'No proof can be brought from a stream of water,' they rejoined. Again he urged: 'If the halachah agrees with me, let the walls of the schoolhouse prove it,' whereupon the walls inclined to fall. But R. Joshua rebuked them, saying: 'When scholars are engaged in a halachic dispute, what have ye to interfere?' Hence they did not fall, in honour of R. Joshua, nor did they resume the upright, in honour of R. Eliezer; and they are still standing thus inclined. Again he said to them: 'If thehalachah agrees with me, let it be proved from Heaven!' Whereupon a Heavenly Voice cried out: 'Why do ye dispute with R. Eliezer, seeing that in all matters the halachah agrees with him!' But R. Joshua arose and exclaimed: 'It is not in heaven.'4  What did he mean by this? — Said R. Jeremiah: That the Torah had already been given at Mount Sinai; we pay no attention to a Heavenly Voice, because Thou hast long since written in the Torah at Mount Sinai, After the majority must one incline.5\n  R. Nathan met Elijah6  and asked him: What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do in that hour? — He laughed [with joy], he replied, saying, 'My sons have defeated Me, My sons have defeated Me.' </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe the fusing of two pieces of wood into 1 in Yechezqel (haftarah for Vayigash) occurs in Galus Bavel (the Babylonian Exile).

If I do cause offense, I apologize in advance, and I assure you that I didn't intend it.  My ignorance is the problem, not my intentions.  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I have been led to believe that during the Second Temple period, Jews believed that G-d literally lived in the Temple, specifically in the Holy of Holies.

The only way I can make sense of this is to assume that the presence of G-d basically \"entered\" the physical world at the Holy of Holies, and perhaps radiated outwards from there into the rest of the world.  </p></li>\n<li><p>I would have to assume that the Temple's destruction didn't affect G-d's presence in the world (His presence is too powerful to be altered by the actions of mere mortals), but I would also assume that the relationship between G-d and the Temple has changed as a result of the destruction, and as a result, the understanding of that relationship has also changed.  </p></li>\n<li><p>What else should I know about the relationship of G-d to the Temple, in terms of G-d living in the Holy of Holies?  I'm specifically interested in how Jews in the Second Temple period understood this issue.  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>Note:  I don't know how to read Hebrew, and most of the tags are written in Hebrew, so I would appreciate any help I can get with applying the correct tags on this question.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I have also thought about the same question and have come up with what seems most logical to me. I too think that talking about \"God living\" in the Beit HaMikdash causes many unnecessary misconceptions, So I think a better way of explaining it is like this:</p>\n\n<p>The Temple was not a house but rather a meeting place, like an office where the \"CEO sitting on the other side of the desk is God.\" Thus God's presence was strongest here and this was the optimal place to interface with and serve God. This is why the destruction of the \"meeting place\" was so devastating and its absence is mourned until today. It is not that God's presence has been diminished, but rather that we have lost the physical location that we could go to and talk to God directly. </p>\n\n<p>I think that this is supported by the name that God gives the inner tent of the Mishkan, the Tabernacle, which was mirrored in the more permanent Temples by the building that contained the Holy and Holy of Holies. The name was אהל מועד, which translated directly means \"the tent of appointed times\". (Another use of this word is the term given to the 3 annual holidays, Passover, Sukkoth and Shavout, called מועדים- the \"ים\" suffix pluralizing the same word \"מועד\",- appointed times\", i.e. holidays.) This tent housed the Holy of Holies, which though the center of both Batei HaMikdash and the Mishkan, had very little to do with the daily service. Only two types of people were ever given permission to go into it. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Moses- who was given permission to enter at any time to ask God for guidance in developing the new nation, and:</li>\n<li>The Kohen Gadol, the High Priest, only on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year, to do a very specific set of tasks to try and achieve atonement for the Jewish people. (With the exception of entering to ask for advice related to going out to war, which was done in conjunction with a Jewish king.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In both these cases, the very specific <em>times</em> were set up as a meeting with God and a representative of the Jewish people, either Moses, to learn and then to teach, or the Kohen Gadol, to beg for mercy on the Day of Atonement or to seek very specific advice. This super- exclusive meeting place radiated outwards to the rest of the Temple, in which the average person could go to and feel a close connection to God.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to find all references to use of אהל מועד, go <a href=\"http://www.responsa.co.il/default.aspx?action=advancedSearch!yes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and paste in \"אהל מועד\".

Even after the rebellion finally started, it took nearly three years for the Romans to fully conquer the Galilee and the North and then finally pivot down to Jerusalem.  This gave enough time for the non-Zealot rabbis to organize and set up an academy in Yavne and generally prepare for the inevitable devastation (the Zealots of course were all pretty much wiped out in the destruction of Jerusalem).</p>\n<p>Remember also that even at the height of the rebellion there was a significant Rabbinical movement to submit to the Romans.  This was helped in part by the fact that by this time the office of High Priest had been politicized, and while the significance of having a Temple was undiminished, the <em>current version of the Temple</em> was felt to be corrupted (and so further Roman meddling wasn't too bad as long as they let the rabbis continue teaching).</p>\n<p>In any case, it is undeniable that this was a traumatic time, and it took time and self-reflection to come to terms with what had happened.</p>\n<p><strong>From <em>Makkot 24a</em></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Again it happened that Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria, Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Akiva went up to Jerusalem. When they reached Mt. Scopus, they tore their garments. When they reached the Temple Mount, they saw a fox emerging from the place of the Holy of Holies. The others started weeping; Rabbi Akiva laughed.</p>\n<p>Said they to him: \"Why are you laughing?\"</p>\n<p>Said he to them: \"Why are you weeping?\"</p>\n<p>Said they to him: \"A place [so holy] that it is said of it, 'the stranger that approaches it shall die,' and now foxes traverse it, and we shouldn't weep?\"</p>\n<p>Said he to them: \"That is why I laugh. For it is written, 'I shall have bear witness for Me faithful witnesses--Uriah the Priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.' Now what is the connection between Uriah and Zechariah?

    "content": "# Does apocalyptic Judaism still exist?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In studying the history of Christianity, and therefore, the historical context of the early Jesus Movement, which was obviously a Jewish context, I have been led to understand that in the first century, there was a popular form of Judaism now referred to as apocalyptic, or eschatological, Judaism.  </p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, eschatological Jews believed the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The universe was a sort of cosmic battleground, and the forces of darkness, death, sin, and wickedness were doing battle with the forces of light, life, virtue, and righteousness.</p></li>\n<li><p>God was still in control of this world in some ultimate sense. But for unknown and mysterious reasons he had temporarily relinquished his control to the forces of evil that opposed him.</p></li>\n<li><p>This state of affairs would not go on forever.  Soon - <strong>very</strong> soon - G-d would intervene directly.</p></li>\n<li><p>He would soon send his emissary, occasionally referred to as the \"Son of Man\", but more often as the messiah.  </p></li>\n<li><p>The messiah  would arrive in the world and usher in the Kingdom of G-d;  he would then sit in judgment over mankind, both living and dead;  the wicked would be laid low, and the righteous would be richly rewarded for their piety.  </p></li>\n<li><p>The Kingdom would be established, with its capital in Jerusalem, and Israel would take her place as the greatest of all nations.  </p></li>\n<li><p>The forces of darkness, death, sin, and wickedness would be crushed once and for all.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For a more comprehensive definition of apocalyptic Judaism, see the document linked <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-4Hr-3EoYjIZ0lzgUfpjOexMpReh5ULyH3FP0A6ENPU/edit?usp=docslist_api\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> or <a href=\"http://justpaste.it/n2pd\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>At long last, we come to the point of all of this:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does apocalyptic Judaism still exist today?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In my opinion, apocalyptic Judaism no longer exists. Sects like those at Qumran no longer exist, and no one is writing in the apocalyptic style (books of Daniel, Enoch, Revelations, and many of the scrolls of Qumran). We can debate all day long as to why. Maybe Jews were tired of predicting the end, but the end never came. Maybe the entire consensus shifted on what we should be focusing on? Maybe after x-amount of false messiahs we're just jaded? Who knows.</p>\n\n<p>But the scholarly discussion of apocalyptic Judaism no longer seems to exist.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm assuming it's because Shabbat is the most frequent \"holiday\" of the year.</li>\n<li>The other masechtot in Mo'ed are also studied. It seems that <strong>some</strong> \"priority\" is given to those masechtot relating to holidays themselves, e.g. Yoma, Succah, etc. rather than Ta'anit, Betza, etc. </li>\n<li>In Nashim, almost all masechtot are studied by some yeshiva. Some preference seems to go to Kiddushin and / or Ketuvot. Maybe it's because many of the students are about to get married or are recently married and the Rosh Yeshiva considers these more relevant.</li>\n<li>In Kadshim, some masechtot such as Chulin are studied. Not too many of these are concentrated upon. I'm surmising that it may be an attitude that items related to the <em>Bet Hamikdash</em> are historic interest and not as relevant today? I can't say, why.</li>\n<li>IIRC, in Taharot, Nidah is the only one that has a Gemarah</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>As the emphasis and time is definitely on Gemarah study, those Masechtot such as Avot, Bikurim, etc. that don't have Gemarah don't get studied as much if at all.  </p></li>\n<li>Rarely have I seen study of Nevi'im or Ketuvim.

Ummmm ... I hate to say it, but when I decided to study it myself (outside a yeshiva environment) and introduced this to a yeshiva rebbe, his reaction was almost like, \"What is that?\" I think he had heard of it, but really did not know what it was about or how useful a sefer it was, esp. as a supplement, in a sense, to the \"regular\" Pirkei Avot.</p></li>\n<li><p>Midrashim? Maybe a few yeshivot are studying that - none that I know of.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Again, this is based on observation of 3 yeshivot in my area. I sense, that what I saw is fairly common.

    "content": "# What was the status of the Pharisees, and their relationship with the Temple authorities in the early first century?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the many mistakes made by the authors of the Christian gospels is attributing the state of affairs in their own time to the time they are trying to describe.  An example of this error is the way the Pharisees are portrayed.  If you relied solely upon the gospels, you would think that the Pharisees were in charge of the Jewish faith and people<sup>1</sup>. I have gleaned enough information to suspect that this was not the case.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, the Pharisees were actually in conflict with the Temple, and had little or no power<sup>1</sup> of their own.  They were highly regarded by the average person, but the Temple authorities weren't so fond of them. The reason for the anachronistic accounts from the gospel writers is apparently related to the changes caused by the loss of the Second Temple.  After the destruction, the Pharisees were finally free from the scrutiny<sup>2</sup> of the priests, and became quite influential in the process of assembling the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>How accurate is this interpretation?  Is there clear evidence that the relationship between the Pharisees and the Temple priests was less than friendly?  And would the Pharisees have had any official influence over Judaism and the Jewish people as a whole, prior to the destruction of the Second Temple?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> To be clear, I am not suggesting that the priests were morally superior to the Pharisees - in fact, quite the opposite.  I am well aware that in the early first century, Temple priests were appointed by the Romans on the basis of bribery and political maneuvering.  The Pharisees, on the other hand, were the true representatives of Judaism, and are represented today by the Rabbis.  The power I am talking about is political power and control of the means of observance, which - as far as I have been led to believe - lay firmly in the hands of the priests.  </p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> \"Scrutiny\" in a self interested, egotistical sense on the part of the priests.  As I understand it, the priests resented the Pharisees for challenging the status quo, which obviously threatened the priests' comfortable position of undeserved authority and high status.  The Pharisees were interested in the wellbeing of the Jewish religion and people, whereas the priests were primarily interested in maintaining the status quo for their own benefit.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>\"History is written by the victor,\" as they say.  In the case of the Second Temple period, however, virtually everyone lost, so interpreting history can be a matter of dispute.</p>\n\n<p>In Jewish tradition, it is, however, indisputable that the Pharisees were the \"good guys\" and the Sadducees were the \"bad guys\".

It was a position of great power, and it was very difficult for anyone else to change this status quo.</p>\n\n<p>A good deal has been written on this subject, a lot of it much less charitable.  But your interpretation <em>could</em> be considered \"valid\", if only from the perspective of the Sadducees, who - to be charitable - disliked the rabbinic class, as represented by the Pharisees.</p>\n\n<p>But from the perspective of traditional Judaism, your interpretation would be considered a warped and incorrect assessment of the period, the Pharisees, and their relationship with the Temple.</p>\n\n<p>Source: Traditional Jewish education.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Using oil lamps on Shabbas in old times\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the olden times, before electricity, did religious Jews have lamps that could hold large amounts of oil so that they could use light on Shabbas, similar to how we use Shabbas lamps and have lights that run on timers ? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>These lamps were to be ignited before Shabbos began and because of Jewish law, they could not be extinguished by man before Hawdoleh. This clearly means that they burnt during the evening and during the night before they extinguished by themselves during the day of Shabbos. It could not have been otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>I have three of them :-), one was made by 1700 in central Europe (length about 60 centimetres, it could have been in a Yeschiweh, it's huge!, a merchant found it in a barn in Alsace, apparently it has been stolen by the invading Germans in WW2 or it has been hidden before), and I have a much shorter one from 1850-1880 which I bought from Aschkenasim in Israel, and then I have an other long one from France. It's from the early 19th century from the region of Tourraine. In 1791, the French national assembly invited the Jews to come to France again (they had been expelled in 1394), and everywhere a Shul etc needed new Shabbos Lamps, so they built the same type of the baroque lamps from the two centuries before, but they added some arms for regular candles. This type was quite common amongst Jews during the 18hundreds.</p>\n\n<p>Some days ago I found an other Shabbos Lamp. It's short, about 30 cm, and it has a double eagle on top (this is the symbol for the Byzantine empire and the for German empire from 1356 to 1806 (this lamp is already the baroque type). It seems to be from 1650 - 1680, the oldest one I've ever seen apart from that ulta rare one in New York from 1330 of course.</p>\n\n<p>If there are questions, please feel free to ask.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>They had lamps that could provide light for many hours (not just the meal).  Whether they filled them up each week to get extended light or just added enough oil for Friday dinner, I don't know.</p>\n<p>Here is an example from the 14th century:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xYWJG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xYWJG.png\" alt=\"star-shaped lamp\" /></a></p>\n<p>The image is taken from the <a href=\"http://thejewishmuseum.org/collection/17514-sabbath-festival-lamp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">catalog entry</a> for the item in the Jewish Museum in New York.  Here are excepts from their discussion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During the Middle Ages, star-shaped hanging lamps illuminated rooms in houses and castles throughout Europe. Each lamp consisted of a shaft from which was suspended a star-shaped container for oil and wicks, and a catch basin for overflow fuel (missing on this example). In Jewish communities, such lamps were also used for rituals -- the kindling of lights in the home to inaugurate Sabbaths and festivals, and for havdalah. [...]  By the sixteenth century, the star-shaped lamp had fallen into disuse among Gentiles, but it retained its form and function in Jewish homes.</p>\n<p>The faceted form of this lamp is characteristic of fourteenth-century Gothic metalwork, such as the set of five nested beakers, dated before 1330, that belonged to a Jew in Kutna Hora. [...] According to the records of the first known owner of the Jewish Museum lamp, Siegfried Strauss, it was excavated in the Jewish quarter of Deutz, a city across the Rhine from Cologne.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.redhillgeneralstore.com/Oil-Lamp-Parts/Lantern-Oil.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this vendor's site</a>, an average oil lamp burns about 0.5 ounce of oil (of an unspecified type) per hour.  My own experience using lamps with olive oil when camping suggests that that estimate is high.  (I have not done the measurement or used them on Shabbat.)   If we go with the estimate from that site, 6-8 ounces of oil would provide light all night and into the following day.</p>\n<p>I couldn't find any sources saying how full people filled these lamps before Shabbat -- i.e. whether the goal was \"light until we retire to bed\" or \"light until it's time to make <em>havdalah</em>\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer and the example pictured answers to be question perfectly. A’shabbos lamp’ of this kind was prevalent in Jewish households across various cultures for many ages all the way up to the installation of electricity. The light would be filled with oil and pits and lit before the shabbos candles. Depending on the size, it would burn during shabbos dinner and often die out sometime later during shabbos eve. In the morning a light wasn’t needed, and by sundown shabbos was over anyway. The only timer attached was the mom of the house having to do the prepping and lighting of this lamp.</p>\n\n\n",

So I decided that I was going to keep myself from saying words for the sake of my as of yet unborn children. If I got into the habit of NOT saying those words now, then when the kids came, I would be less likely to slip up and then have them repeat something I knew was inappropriate.</p>\n\n<p>In the same way, I knew that in the classroom (I am a classroom teacher) I had to watch my mouth. But if words were habitual, then I would have more trouble controlling them, so I practiced being more conscious of my word choice at ALL times, even when not in the class, so by the time I got into the class, speaking properly (vis-a-vis grammar and propriety) would be my norm.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>While I do not in anyway meant to minimize the difficulty of removing profanity from one's vocabulary (or the effort of those who have been successful), it may be helpful to recall that if you have learned to use profanity you have probably already mastered not using it settings where such language is frowned upon.</p>\n\n<p>From my experience I would suggest the following:</p>\n\n<p>Consider the circumstances when you resort to such language and develop ready to go alternatives.  Although not as regularly as when I first eliminated profanity from my vocabulary, I will still exclaim \"unacceptable\" when I bang my shin or so forth. </p>\n\n<p>Avoid using profanity in you head/self-talk.  It is easy to focus on the <em>act</em> of using profanity but I don't think anyone will find it counter-intuitive if I suggest that indulging in such language in one's mind will make it much more difficult to keep from using it in speech.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from any <em>halachic</em> obligation, avoid listening to music with profanity. We tend to \"sing along\" with music, even if we do not articulate it verbally. This is especially true when you still use profanity habitually. Of course it is best to avoid any exposure to profanity, especially elective, but I would suggest a special emphasis on music in this regard.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I would start by picking a window of time, maybe 30 min, maybe 15, where you can stay conscious and in control of what I am saying. \"From 6 to 6:30 pm, I will not speak nivul peh.\"</p>\n\n<p>After a week, stretch that window. And then extend it again the third week. At some point, instead of taking on more time, move it to a more sensitive part of the day/week, like when you tend to see friends who talk similarly and it's harder to stay in control.</p>\n\n<p>Two more suggestions. although the first one is more effective these may help too:</p>\n\n<p>Keep a cheshbon hanefesh, a journal where you record the days successes and failures. Could be just a list of checks and minuses, or actual descriptive text. Whatever forces you to review the day. By being conscious at the end of the day about what the triggers are, it's easier to become more aware in the moment when the temptation is there.</p>\n\n<p>Third, write on a slip of paper, \"עַל-כֵּן עַל-בַּחוּרָיו לֹא-יִשְׂמַח ה', וְאֶת-יְתֹמָיו וְאֶת-אַלְמְנוֹתָיו לֹא יְרַחֵם--כִּי כֻלּוֹ חָנֵף וּמֵרַע, וְכָל-פֶּה דֹּבֵר נְבָלָה; בְּכָל-זֹאת לֹא-שָׁב אַפּוֹ, וְעוֹד יָדוֹ נְטוּיָה.  -- Therefore, Hashem will have no joy in [this nation's] young men, nor will He have compassion on its orphans and His widows; for every one is ungodly and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaks disgustingness; in all this His Anger is not turned away, and His hand is still stretched out.\"</p>\n\n<p>Read it in the morning, then put it in your pocket. Whenever your hand touches the piece of paper, it will be another reminder of what you're working on.</p>\n\n<p>Have a great and successful Elul. Kol hakavod!</p>\n\n\n",

That penalty was instituted specifically for the case where both biological parents were Jewish. In today's world it's more often likely the biological father is a non-Jew.</p>\n\n<p>There's also discussion about the possibility of artificial insemination (the Talmud talks about the theoretical case where there was sperm in the bath water) or in-vitro fertilization. 20th Century rabbinic authorities debated whether a <em>mamzer</em> is generated by this scenario, if the mother was married and the sperm donor is a Jewish man not married to her. If a single woman gets artificially inseminated it's not a product of \"adultery\", so the child is again not a <em>mamzer</em> per se.</p>\n\n<p>Absent any other information, we don't need to go there because maybe the biological father isn't Jewish. </p>\n\n<p>Contemporary Jewish medical ethicists have discussed if we can prove via DNA that someone's biological parentage is a married Jewish woman and a specific Jewish man who wasn't her husband, would that give the child the status of <em>mamzer</em> or would we still allow for the possibility of artificial insemination / IVF.

The questions arise however, with donor sperm. The first issue that comes to mind is that of a mamzer. Let us define the word. A married woman who has an affair with a Jewish man other than her husband is guilty of adultery. Any child from such a union is a mamzer. If a Jewish woman has an affair with a non-Jewish man, even though this is sinful behavior, the child is not considered a mamzer. Likewise, a child born out of wedlock is not a mamzer. \n  Suppose that a woman is impregnated by a Jewish man other than her husband, but through unnatural means such as A.I.D. (Artificial Insemination Donor). It would appear that we have all the ingredients of a mamzer; with the exception on one � sin. The Smak concludes that the mamzer is a result of the sin of gilui arayoth, uncovering the nakedness of a married woman. This is not an ethical consideration but a halachic one. A sin that carries the punishment of kares, excision, results in a child who is a mamzer.

    "title": "Stopping a morning minyan",
    "content": "# Stopping a morning minyan\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Our synagogue had for a number of years a morning minyan on Monday and Thursday and Sunday mornings. Until recent times we had members who supported these and it was no real problem. Then last year our Rabbi introduced a Wednesday morning minyan. Also we have over the last year or so lost four or five of the regular Morning minyan attenders. This means we have to bother people to attend the minyan, which often they will do but then start to resent being asked. It is getting more and more difficult to get ten men each morning as more people are refusing outright to participate. Some say we should go back to just Monday and Thursday when there are Torah readings and abandon the Wednesday morning shacharit service. We have one member who says that once you start a routine of a Wednesday Shacharit service, you can't stop it. He threatens to leave if we do, and he is a much-respected person who would be a great loss if he left to go to another synagogue. This of course is pure blackmail. Question is, is he correct.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, my question is: Irrespective of our particular circumstances, generally, <strong>is there a Halacha or Minhag or whatever that says once you start a minyan in the morning of a particular day you have to keep it going and cannot stop it?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Since you related a scenario tied to your question, I'll try to address both the general as well as specific.</p>\n\n<p>Excerpting from <a href=\"http://www.thehalacha.com/wp-content/uploads/Vol3Issue29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Davening with a minyan is not just a nice thing to do. It is an\n  obligation upon every male (above the age of thirteen) to daven with a\n  minyan every single day of his life.11 According to many poskim this\n  obligation is d’rabbanan12 in nature, and is a very big mitzvah.13 The\n  Shulchan Hatohar14 says anyone with trace of yiddishkeit should daven\n  with a minyan. Although the Shulchan Aruch15 says one should “try” to\n  daven with a minyan, the poskim say this does not mean to say that\n  davening with a minyan is not an obligation.16</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(I've maintained the footnotes for your xref).</p>\n\n<p>So, there is some debate as to whether one is obligated to pray in a minyan at all. But, this article explains <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> means that it is an obligation. See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/28935/5275\">this M.Y. question and its answers.</a> Igrot Moshe concurs that the minyan is obligatory.</p>\n\n<p>Well, obviously, this assumes that there is a minyan to attend! So, it seems that where possible, and as much as possible, the shul has an obligation as well to try to have a minyan. So, in that sense, the complainer is correct, that if you've already established a minyan on certain day, the shul really should not forgo that obligation to provide that minyan continuously, since people are obligated to daven at a minyan.</p>\n\n<p>Your problem, is a bit more specific, though. My understanding (and correct me if I assume wrongly) is that your shul encounters these conflicts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You're not getting a daily minyan, no matter what happens.</li>\n<li>These people probably don't daven at home. So, it's the shul that's getting them to daven altogether.</li>\n<li>It seems that you are getting a consensus of enough people to make a minyan on Mon. and Thurs. as they realize the importance of hearing Torah reading</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, to me, it seems that the higher priority should be given to keeping the shul available to have as many minyanim as possible, and moreso, getting these people to daven altogether, if it's the shul that encourages them to do that. My inference, then, from the general joint \"obligation\" of a minyan is that you may have to pick and choose on this one and side with when you can have minyan the most. If it means dispensing with the Wed. minyan, you <em>may</em> need to do this.</p>\n\n<p>This is my opinion and inference from the above article. CYLOR. Even better, I recommend that the \"blackmailer\" ask a rabbi about this, and have HIM post the answer on M.Y. ;-)</p>\n\n<p>Postscript:</p>\n\n<p>I reread your question, and you imply that there is another synagogue in your area. If that's the case, then, it's possible that none of what I said may be relevant. Can you clarify this aspect?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The רמ\"א in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01975_part_4.html#HtmpReportNum0009_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן נה - דיני קדיש</a> says that people should force each other - with fines - to force everybody to come to Minyan every day so that there shouldn't be a single day without a Minyan.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגה: וְכֵן בְּמָקוֹם שֶׁאֵין מִנְיָן תָּמִיד בְּבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת, כּוֹפִין זֶה אֶת זֶה בִּקְנָסוֹת שֶׁיָּבוֹאוּ תָּמִיד מִנְיָן לְבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת, שֶׁלֹּא יִתְבַּטֵּל הַתָּמִיד ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So your Rabbi's behavior is correct and expected. Actually he should be forcing all of you to come <strong>every</strong> day.</p>\n\n\n",

An important distinction in this regard is the difference between narrative passages and legal ones (i.e. <em>mitzvoth</em>-commandments). Many symbolic <em>mitzvoth</em>, such as <em>tefillin</em> (e.g. Exodus 13:9), traditionally involve a literal component which cannot be fulfilled with the associated symbolism alone. Nonetheless, other commandments are traditionally (at least according to most authorities) assumed to be \"nonliteral\", e.g. not placing a stumbling block before the blind (Leviticus 19:14).  </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, historical narratives are generally assumed to be literal, even when incorporating events or ideas not prevalent nowadays, such as miracles or unusually long life-spans. However, some narratives if understood in an overly literal fashion, can comprise heresy according to <em>halacha</em>, e.g. corporeality. In addition, many historical passages have been understood allegorically by traditional scholars (see e.g. the <em>Moreh Nevukhim</em> on the first sin; It's also worth noting that traditional scholars [e.g. Rambam, Maharal, Ramchal, Vilna Gaon] reject the literal interpretation of <em>Aggada</em>/<em>Medrash</em>.)</p>\n\n\n",

Either the original practice or the new one, but many times the Rabbis leave things as is and let society steer it's own course, as long as it doesn't veer too far off. Just think of the backlash from all the recent times Rabbis tried getting involved. If they disapproved of mixed seating they may have kept quite about it while choosing the battle of mixed dancing. If they disapproved of separating the families, they may have kept quite being happy that at least now people who should not be sitting together, won't be. </p>\n\n<p>On the subject, I can tell you of at least one major yeshiva where the Kalla would sit in the men's section by Sheva Brachos held in the yeshiva.

Is there a tradition to pronounce it the full way always, or possibly only on those specific chapters?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The word is always pronounced /ye-ˌrū-shā-ˈ<em>lā</em>-yim/, with a י, even when the י isn’t written.</p>\n<p>The reason the כתיב doesn’t have the י (except in very late כתובים like מגילת אסתּר), is because originally, the word was pronounced /ye-ˌrū-sha-ˈ<em>lēm</em>/.\n(This is where the Latin transliteration “Jerusalem” came from. Back when  was “y” and  could indicate “sh”, this transliteration would be pronounced just like the Hebrew version).</p>\n<p>Eventually, due to natural linguistic processes, the final syllable turned from /lēm/ to /läym/. Thus, the word was pronounced /ye-ˌrū-sha-ˈ<em>läym</em>/. (This change took place sometimes before the authorship or redaction of מגילת אסתּר). This is when ירושלים began to be written with the י.</p>\n<p>Sometime between then and the Masoretic era—when the niqqud and trope symbols were invented—another change occurred, changing the /läym/ to /lā-yim/, splitting the last syllable into two. This is the pronunciation persisted until today.</p>\n<p>Now, we always pronounce the word as I wrote it above: /ye-ˌrū-shā-ˈ<em>lā</em>-yim/. However, we preserve how it was originally written, which is why most instances of ירושל(י)ם in תנ״ך are still spelled without the י. Due to the millennia of exposure to various other languages, and just the sheer length of time between the כתובים and today, our accent changed a lot. So we pronounce the extra י.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=EYWOAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA93&dq=orthography%20%20of%20yerushalayim%20without%20a%20yod&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMInMjxoZ24xwIVRFc-Ch2h7w-H#v=onepage&q=orthography%20%20of%20yerushalayim%20without%20a%20yod&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">this book</a> p. 93 mentions something about the orthography and phonology of \"Yerushalayim\". Summarizing some points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>He seems to indicate that a full spelling with the 2nd <em>yod</em> would\ninidicate a tripthong making the pronunciation <em>ayim</em>. However,\nbecause the full spelling is rarely seen in Tanac\"h, and the missing\nyod is the more common format, the author indiocates that the\npronunciation may be more \"I\" or \"e\" sound.</li>\n<li>The author notes that that the missing spelling without the yod has 2 vowels, <em>patach</em> and <em>hirik</em> under the lamed. He states that based on the common pronunciation of the name <em>Yerushalayim</em> from the cases where it is spelled with a full yod, it's reasonable to support the idea of pronouncing it as <em>ayi</em> , i.e. as a tripthong even without the final yod spelling. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

It took some time for word of his death to reach Rome, and an equal amount of time for his replacement to arrive in the region.  During the intervening weeks, the high priest of Israel, a man named Ananus ben Ananus (or Hanan ben Hanan), decided to exploit the power vacuum by getting rid of some of his opponents.  Among these was James, the brother of Jesus.  Ananus had him, and several others, executed.  The people of Jerusalem took offense at this, because Ananus had exceeded his authority - only the Roman proconsul was allowed to order an execution.  </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when the new proconsul, a man named Albinus, arrived in the region, the people of Jerusalem complained about Ananus' actions.  Albinus deposed Ananus from office, and replaced him with a man named Jesus, son of Damneus.  Ananus was demoted to priest, and here he drops out of the record until the Jewish Revolt.  During the siege of Jerusalem, Ananus took on a position of leadership and led the people of Jerusalem against the Zealots.  I'm not sure what became of him after this, but it seems likely that he was killed along with everyone else in the city when the Romans finally destroyed Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<p>Does Ananus appear in other Jewish records of the period?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Beit Chanan (Ananus ben Ananus in Hebrew is Chanan ben Chanan (חנן בן חנן)) appears in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sifrei_Devarim.105.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei Devarim 105:22</a> (\"Beit Chanan\" in at least one MS per the Finkelstein edition; \"Bnei Chanan\" in other MSS):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"They said: Why were the shops of Beit Chanan laid waste two years before (the destruction of) Eretz Yisrael?

    "content": "# What is the modern Jewish attitude towards the Zealots and Sicarii?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the leading factions in the Jewish Revolt of 66-70 was the Zealot movement, and its splinter group, the Sicarii.  I would imagine that the attitude towards them is somewhat complicated, or at least, it was once complicated.  On the one hand, they were fighting for a noble cause - the overthrow of domination by heathens.  On the other hand, they were largely responsible for the disastrous Revolt, which led to untold suffering for the Jewish people.  I seem to remember reading somewhere on this site that the Sicarii are also condemned for murdering a priest in the Temple itself, which I assume is a serious offense against G-d's law.  </p>\n\n<p>Does modern Judaism take a stance regarding the Zealots and Sicarii?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Talmud (Gittin 56a) relates the following about the Zealot-Pharisee relationship:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The biryoni [presumed to be Zealots] were then in the city. The Rabbis said to them: Let us go out and make peace with them [the Romans]. They would not let them, but on the contrary said, Let us go out and fight them. The Rabbis said: You will not succeed. They then rose up and burnt the stores of wheat and barley so that a famine ensued [...] </p>\n  \n  <p>Abba Sikra the head of the biryoni in Jerusalem was the son of the sister of Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai. [The latter] sent to him saying, Come to visit me privately. When he came he said to him, How long are you going to carry on in this way and kill all the people with starvation? He replied:\n  What can I do? If I say a word to them, they will kill me.  (Soncino trans.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This passage clearly portrays the Zealots as being responsible for mass starvation, and clearly aligns them against the Pharisees, and their leader Rabban Yochanan b. Zakkai. Their military struggle against the Romans was viewed as doomed to failure, and the Pharisees considered diplomacy the only viable solution.</p>\n\n<p>This approach seems to have remained accepted among later rabbinic thinkers such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obadiah_ben_Jacob_Sforno\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Ovadiah S'forno</a>  (16th century) who in his commentary to Genesis (33:4) notes that were it not for the \"baryonim\" [Zealots], the Temple would not have been destroyed.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Regarding the murder of a high priest, <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0021_0_21428.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this website</a> states that Antiquities (20:162–66) relates that the first victim of the Sicarii was Jonathan (b. Anan), who had previously been high priest under the influence of the procurator Felix, who was interested in getting rid of Jonathan. Interestingly I have not found reference to this in rabbinic literature. (I haven't looked that hard).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What constitutes a name of G-d?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A now-deleted question on this site asked about what halachik justification there was for an attempted stoning of Jesus.  In the passage quoted by the OP, Jesus had said \"Before Abraham was, I AM!\", and I was able to determine that the wording he used was identical to the words of G-d in Exodus 3:14.  In the Greek translation of the passage from John 8, and in the Septuagint translation of Exodus 3:14, the words for \"I AM\" are exactly identical.  I came to the conclusion that the Jewish people who allegedly tried to stone Jesus were justified, because Jesus had deliberately described himself in the same words G-d used to describe Himself (in fact, the scholarly consensus is that John is completely unreliable and has no basis in reality, so the event described in the passage never took place).  </p>\n\n<p>This made me wonder what other titles for G-d are considered off limits to Jews.  My knowledge of this subject is patchy at best, so please forgive me if I say something offensive.  </p>\n\n<p>I know that YHWH is not supposed to be spoken, and I think the associated name (I don't know if I'm allowed to write it, so let's just say that it is the first half of the name of the JW church which is a small offshoot of Christianity, the second half being \"Witnesses\").  I also know that the word G-d is often written with a dash in place of the \"o\" in accordance with this law.  Are there other names of G-d which are off limits?  I'm not even sure if it is possible to answer this question, in light of the fact that I'm asking about words that are prohibited.  </p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate any help you can offer me, and I hope I haven't said anything offensive.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Jewish scripture show a preference between non-belief or erroneous belief?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Obviously, Judaism maintains that it is best to follow Judaism or, for gentiles, the Noachide laws.  But I'm curious as to whether, according to Jewish scripture, it is preferable to not believe in G-d, or to believe the wrong things about G-d.  That is to say, is it better to be an atheist, or a Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, Shintoist, etc?  This question is about <em>belief</em>, not <em>practice</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also assuming that the nonbeliever in question is a good person.  He or she treats other people with respect and compassion, cares for the less fortunate and the afflicted, and is in all respects an admirable human being.  He or she simply doesn't believe in G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Note:  I'm deliberately leaving out Islam, because <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/6004/if-christianity-is-avodah-zarah-and-islam-is-not-why-has-the-christian-world-tr\">I have been led to understand</a> that, at least theoretically, Islam is considered to be preferable to the other non-Jewish options.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As acknowledged in the question, Judaism only requires that non-jews keep the seven Noachide laws (plus some miscellaneous laws which are beyond the scope of this answer). Seeing as the first of these is the prohibition against idolatry, it is clear that belief in any polytheistic religion is definitely a problem. That the prohibition extends to belief in addition to action can be seen from the Rambam in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Kings_and_Wars.9.2?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchot Melachim 9:2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What about atheism? Is atheism less problematic?</p>\n\n<p>Jews (according to most classic opinions) have an explicit mitzvah to believe in God. There is no such mitzvah amongst the seven Noachide laws. Only the prohibition against idolatry. In the past, I inferred from this that there would be no problem with a non-jew being atheist. After all, one can be atheist and keep all of the seven Noachide laws. The problem with this is a halacha found in the Rambam, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Kings_and_Wars.8.11?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchot Melachim 8:11</a>, which states that a non-jew who keeps the seven Noachide laws because of his own moral calculations instead of because of God's commanding them doesn't get <em>full</em> credit for them (note that there are two variants of this halacha. See the Frankel ed. The above point stands according to both though). We thus see that the behaviour of a non-jew who doesn't believe in God is deficient regardless of how good his behaviour is. Apparently then, belief in God is some sort of prerequisite to the seven Noachide laws. This would also explain why the Rambam mentions this halacha immediately before listing the seven Noachide laws and their various details.</p>\n\n<p>It appears then that atheism would also be a problem for non-jews, albeit a less severe one than polytheism.</p>\n\n<p>What about Christianity* which professes to be monotheistic? The classic sources generally think that Christianity is idolatrous, for example, the Rambam explicitly says so in Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot 11:7 (see the Franked ed. for the uncensored version) as well as in other places. There is however an often quoted <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Sanhedrin.63b.15.1?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tosofot to Sanhedrin 63b</a> which states that it is permissible to force a christian to make an oath with the name of God because the christian is only \"associating\" (<em>shituf</em>) God with his idolatrous beliefs and this is permissible for non-jews to do. There is significant discussion regarding whether Tosofot means that <em>shituf</em> is generally permitted for non-jews or only in the context of making oaths. To summarise then, according to one school of thought, Christianity is as problematic as any polytheistic religion while according to others, there may be no problem depending on how you interpret the aforementioned Tosofot.</p>\n\n<p>Even though the question explicitly excluded Islam, it seems appropriate to deal with it here anyway because it will give us an insight into other religions in general. Classically, Islam has been assumed to not be idolatrous. This can for example be seen in the previously mentioned Rambam, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Foods.11.7?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot 11:7</a>. This however only addresses one side of the issue. From a theological perspective, Islam is apparently not idolatrous. Does this make it into an acceptable belief system for non-jews? The answer is unequivocally no. See the Rambam in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Kings_and_Wars.10.9?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchot Melachim 10:9</a> where he explicitly brings a prohibition for non-jews to create their own religions to serve God. In his language - אין מניחין אותן לחדש דת ולעשות מצות לעצמן מדעתן - or in english - \"we do not allow them to create a religion or to create mitzvot for themselves based on their opinions\". As such, assuming that Muhammed wasn't actually a prophet of God, it turns out that subscribing to Islam and in fact any non-jewish religion would also be problematic for non-jews.</p>\n\n<p>To summarise, from best to worst, we have the following types of belief in God for non-jews:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Belief in God as described by Judaism (i.e. singular, omnipotent, omniscient, etc.) without subscribing to another religion</li>\n<li>Belief in God as described by a non-jewish genuinely monotheistic religion such as Islam.</li>\n<li>Atheism</li>\n<li>Belief in God as described by Christianity according to <em>some</em> opinions</li>\n<li>Polytheism (and Christianity according to other opinions)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(Note: There may be some room to argue for swapping the order of 3 and 4)</p>\n\n<p>*If I am not mistaken, different denominations of Christianity can have very different beliefs about the divinity of Jesus and other potentially idolatrous beliefs. I'm not familiar with any classic sources which bother to distinguish between the denominations though so I have no way of categorising which denominations are less problematic and which are more.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a dispute at to whether שיתוף (believing in G-d AND another power; the trinity included) is permitted for gentiles. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/89/is-christianity-avodah-zara\">Is Christianity Avodah Zara?</a> for the differing opinions. There's no need to go through it again.

Either way, Maimonides, even though he counts idolatry (kings and wars 9.1), he still says they need to believe that G-d commanded them through Moses (ibid 8.14)\n[Note: Idolatry is worship, (Hebrew: avodah zarah, strange service. So for your question about belief, not practise, you wouldn't have a problem of idolatry. I'm just demonstrating that believing in G-d is necessary.)</p>\n\n<p>(Additionally, Abraham fought hard to get gentiles to recognise G-d (I can bring sources if necessary).)</p>\n\n<p>So, to summarise, best is to believe in G-d, believing that he is the One and Only power.</p>\n\n<p>Next, שיתוף, (including believing in the trinity). While some say that this is allowed for gentiles, others say it's not.</p>\n\n<p>Next, atheism, which it seems everyone, or at the very least, nearly everyone, holds isn't alright for gentiles.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>generally speaking Christianity is better than Atheism since it's based on the Tanach.

The Jerusalem bible by Fisch also uses this style, even though it was written in the middle of the 20th century. All the others use modern sounding words. Of these Artscroll and the living Torah are definitely the most modern sounding in their choice of words, while the others try to maintain a stronger sense of formality in their language.</p>\n<p>The two JPS translations - JPS 1985 and JPS 1917 are certainly the most academic while still being based in Jewish thought. Artscroll is based solely on traditional Jewish thought. The living Torah/Nach is about as far from a translation as you can get and still call is a translation - it includes a lot of text which is implied by non-Torah sources (like the mishnah) in it's Torah translation. The Jerusalem Bible is a healthy mix of the two approached, but it uses archaic language.</p>\n<p>While the main difference between JPS 1917 and 1985 is the language used, the 1985 translation also benefits from updated scholarship. In 1917 biblical scholarship and input from fields like archaeology and linguistics was in its infancy. By the 1980s the JPS team had the advantage of another 70 years of research to utilize. The older JPS translation as the gold standard for decades, but it is dated by today's standards. The new JPS is still the gold standard for those seeking an academic translation.</p>\n<p>Although it's not complete, since you did say you're looking for academic translations I would be remiss if I didn't mention <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Fox\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Everett Fox's</a> translation and commentary. (Published by Schocken). He does something a little unique, which is to try to convey the rhythm and feeling of the Hebrew, and treats the text more like poetry than prose. I did not include it because it is not yet complete - he's done the Torah and the early prophets, and AFAIK is continuing to work on it, though you may have to be patient if you want to get the whole thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Giant TLDR:</strong> Get the new JPS, unless you like Fox's approach and are willing to wait.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The 1917 JPS Translation is the best Bible for finding out what the Bible says in English, but not necessarily for finding out what it means. There are many ambiguous phrases in the Bible, and the 1917 JPS leaves the ambiguity without interpreting it for you. If you want an interpretive Bible, there are many. Some people recommend Artscroll, but I often find myself frustrated by it because I find that it interprets scripture too much. Rather than give you a middle ground for possible meaning, it will often translate a word or phrase according to the \"safe current Orthodox belief\" of things rather than allow any other interpretations. An example would be rather than translating \"B'nei Elohim\" as \"the sons of God/Divine Beings\" and then giving you possible interpretations in the commentary, it will instead translate it as \"descendents of Seth.\"</p>\n\n<p>But for you I would recommend the Hertz Chumash, as it's a good introductory Torah with easy-to-comprehend commentary using the 1917 Translation. Many \"Orthodox\" people scoff at the Hertz Chumash, claiming that Rabbi Hertz was a conservative Jew, which he was not. He was the former Chief [Orthodox] Rabbi of the United Kingdom. He attended JTS [Jewish Theological Seminary] which started off more Orthodox and is now more on the Conservative/Reform side. JPS later published a whole series of the Bible with commentary. It is many books long, and is out of print and very rare/expensive to get a whole set.</p>\n\n<p>If you want an easy, all-in-one Bible, there is the Jewish Study Bible printed by Oxford press, but this Bible is technically put out by many Conservative-Movement commentators, mentions things like the Graf-Wellhausen Documentary Hypothesis, and other things that make certain Orthodox people really upset. The translation is the \"New JPS,\" which is a lot like the NIV in that it kind of simplifies the language at times and tries to take the ambiguity out in preference of giving you an understandable sentence. It also doesn't have the Hebrew text for you to read yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The last recommendation I would have is a Torah by Rav Samson Hirsch. And although it's not a full Bible, only the Torah, the commentary is usually very in depth and is mostly inspiring, but it's hard to come across one in print. Also the translations of the words themselves are often interpretations like the Artscroll.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There isn't really a best.

God caused him to arise only to test the many, as Daniel 11:35 states: 'And some of the wise men will stumble, to try them, to refine, and to clarify until the appointed time, because the set time is in the future.'</p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://m.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188357/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-12.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chapter 12</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Halacha 1</p>\n  \n  <p>Do not presume that in the Messianic age any facet of the world's nature will change or there will be innovations in the work of creation. Rather, the world will continue according to its pattern.</p>\n  \n  <p>Although Isaiah 11:6 states: 'The wolf will dwell with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the young goat,' these words are a metaphor and a parable. The interpretation of the prophecy is as follows: Israel will dwell securely together with the wicked gentiles who are likened to a wolf and a leopard, as in the prophecyJeremiah 5:6: 'A wolf from the wilderness shall spoil them and a leopard will stalk their cities.' They will all return to the true faith and no longer steal or destroy. Rather, they will eat permitted food at peace with Israel as Isaiah 11:7 states: 'The lion will eat straw like an ox.'</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, other Messianic prophecies of this nature are metaphors. In the Messianic era, everyone will realize which matters were implied by these metaphors and which allusions they contained.</p>\n  \n  <p>Halacha 2</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Sages taught: \"There will be no difference between the current age and the Messianic era except the emancipation from our subjugation to the gentile kingdoms.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The simple interpretation of the prophets' words appear to imply that the war of Gog and Magog will take place at the beginning of the Messianic age. Before the war of Gog and Magog, a prophet will arise to inspire Israel to be upright and prepare their hearts, as Malachi 3:22states: 'Behold, I am sending you Elijah.'</p>\n  \n  <p>He will not come to declare the pure, impure, or to declare the impure, pure. He will not dispute the lineage of those presumed to be of proper pedigree, nor will he validate the pedigree of those whose lineage is presumed blemished. Rather, he will establish peace within the world as ibid. 3:24 continues: 'He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>There are some Sages who say that Elijah's coming will precede the coming of the Mashiach. All these and similar matters cannot be definitely known by man until they occur for these matters are undefined in the prophets' words and even the wise men have no established tradition regarding these matters except their own interpretation of the verses. Therefore, there is a controversy among them regarding these matters.</p>\n  \n  <p>Regardless of the debate concerning these questions, neither the order of the occurrence of these events or their precise detail are among the fundamental principles of the faith. A person should not occupy himself with the Aggadot and homiletics concerning these and similar matters, nor should he consider them as essentials, for study of them will neither bring fear or love of God.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, one should not try to determine the appointed time for Mashiach's coming. Our Sages declared: 'May the spirits of those who attempt to determine the time of Mashiach's coming expire!' Rather, one should await and believe in the general conception of the matter as explained.</p>\n  \n  <p>Halacha 3</p>\n  \n  <p>During the era of the Messianic king, once his kingdom has been established and all of Israel has gathered around him, the entire nation's line of descent will be established on the basis of his words and the prophetic spirit which will rest upon him, as Malachi 3:3 states: 'He shall sit as a refiner and purifier.'</p>\n  \n  <p>He will purify the lineage of the Levites first, stating 'He is a priest of defined lineage. He is a Levite of defined lineage.' Those whose lineage he will not recognize will be lowered to the status of Israelites. This is implied byEzra 2:63: 'The governor said to them: 'They should not eat of the most holy things until a priest arises who will wear the urim vitumim.' From this verse, you can infer that the prophetic spirit will be used to define and notify the pedigree of lineage.</p>\n  \n  <p>When he defines the lineage of the Israelites, he will make known their tribal lineage alone, stating: 'He is from this tribe and he is from another tribe.' He will not, by contrast, state concerning a person who is presumed to be of unblemished lineage: 'He is illegitimate or he is of slave lineage.' For the law is once a family has become intermingled with the entire Jewish people, they may remain intermingled.</p>\n  \n  <p>Halacha 4</p>\n  \n  <p>The Sages and the prophets did not yearn for the Messianic era in order to have dominion over the entire world, to rule over the gentiles, to be exalted by the nations, or to eat, drink, and celebrate. Rather, they desired to be free to involve themselves in Torah and wisdom without any pressures or disturbances, so that they would merit the world to come, as explained inHilchot Teshuvah.</p>\n  \n  <p>Halacha 5</p>\n  \n  <p>In that era, there will be neither famine or war, envy or competition for good will flow in abundance and all the delights will be freely available as dust. The occupation of the entire world will be solely to know God.</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, the Jews will be great sages and know the hidden matters, grasping the knowledge of their Creator according to the full extent of human potential, as Isaiah 11:9 states: 'The world will be filled with the knowledge of God as the waters cover the ocean bed.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Ayin miraculously holding it's place in the second tablets?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara (Sanhedrin 21b-22a) records a discussion about the script of Torah scrolls (ashiri or ivri).</p>\n\n<p>Many commentators look at the first opinion in the discussion and wonder if it means that the tablets were also written in ashuri or ivri script. The primary objection to the notion that they were in ivri is because the Gemara in Shabbos 104a says that the ם and ס miraculously floated in place (because all of the letters were engraved all the way through).</p>\n\n<p>Now, Radbaz (responsun 883, addressing our discussion in Sanhedrin) questions the difficulty with saying that the tablets must have been written in ashuri, because the Yerushalmi (supposedly to the same chapter as Shabbos 104a) says that according to the opinion of the one who says the ancient Torahs were written in Ivri, it was the ע which floated in place (because in Ivri it looks like a closed triangle). </p>\n\n<p>Radbaz answers this by saying that the ע of the second tablets floated in place, and was written in Ivri, but not the first. (For a better understanding of the setup to this question, see the Sapirstein Edition of Sanhedrin, page 22a note 22).</p>\n\n<p>The question is:</p>\n\n<p>I heard (from a Rabbi, although I don't know his source) that the second tablets were NOT engraved all the way through!

Or that whatever the miracle is, it is because the Ayin and the Samekh have the same shape, and so the miracle has to do with the shape.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, the Yerushalmi doesn't say that the Samekh or the Ayin floated in place, it just says they were miraculous.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Talmud Yerushalmi Meghillah 10</p>\n  \n  <p>אמר רבי לוי מאן דאמר לרעץ ניתנה התורה עי\"ן מעשה ניסים מאן דאמר אשורי\n  ניתנה התורה סמ\"ך מעשה ניסים</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Lewi stood and said: According to the view that the Torah was\n  given in Hebrew, the ‘Ayin was miraculous.

While it also might not be particularly common, it does occur like this in other contexts as well. So, for example, שנים חדשים in 1 Kings 5:28, שנים כרֻבים in Exodus 25:18 and שתים נשים in 1 Kgs 3:16.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to see some grammars that mention this as a normal function of the numeral, see Waltke and O'Connor (<em>An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax</em>, §15.2.1j) and Joüon and Muraoka (<em>A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew</em>, §142c). Neither of them give a particular reason for it either.</p>\n\n<p>The number of mefarshim who remark upon it appears to be fairly small, and my suspicion is that while it's an unusual form it's not unusual enough to have warranted comment. That said, however, there are some people who do draw attention to it - particularly in relation to the fact that שני עדים appears in Deuteronomy 19:15.</p>\n\n<p>So, the Baal haTurim for example (on 19:15) explains the difference between the two attestations as relating to the fact that the first verse (17:6) spoke of capital cases, while the second speaks of financial tribunals. In the former instance, intimidation of the witnesses is more important, and so the Torah uses a longer word in order to indicate a lengthier process. In his words: למעלה כתיב על פי שנים עדים דהכא איירי בממון ואין מאיימין עליהם כל כך כמו בנפשות.</p>\n\n<p>The Netziv also remarks upon the use of שנים in 17:6, and his argument is an interesting one. Had the text said שני עדים, it would suggest that the two witnesses are somehow identical with one another. Rabbis Yehuda and Mordekhai Yaakov Kuperman, who provide glosses to the Haamak Davar (Jerusalem, 2011), give two other examples of the same phenomenon, as pointed out by the Gra:</p>\n\n<p>Genesis 1:16 mentions שני המאורות הגדולים, and chazal learn out (Hullin 90b) that they were both the same size; Leviticus 16:5 mentions שני שעירי עזים, and chazal learn out (Yoma 62b) that they were identical.</p>\n\n<p>The Netziv goes on to buttress this point in reference to R' Bahya ibn Paquda's interpretation of Exodus 25:18 - the injunction to make שנים כרֻבים implies that the two cherubim were both <em>different</em> from one another. In that case, that one was in the form of a male and the other in the form of a female. In our case, however, referring to the witnesses as שנים עדים implies that their opinions do not entirely harmonise.</p>\n\n<p>The Netziv concludes by bringing a passage from the Yerushalmi (on Sanhedrin 5:2), to the effect that if the two witnesses in a capital case align too closely with one another, and based on the fact that two different people cannot possibly have exactly the same story without prior arrangement, then they need to be investigated.</p>\n\n<p>As such, the Netziv finds a basis for the opinion of the Yerushalmi in the verse itself: we don't want the two witnesses to be exactly the same, but to be fundamentally different from each other. That they are described subsequently as שני עדים in 19:15 is because of the fact it is through their disagreement that they become one. In his words: ובזה הניגוד נעשים אחת.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>\"Shenei\" means \"two of\" (like \"benei -- children of\"). Shenei eidim is \"two units of witnesses\". The emphasis is on the eidim, and we're just giving a property of the set of witnesses -- it has size two. The pasuq at 19:15 is saying that it takes a set of 2 or 3 (or more) witnesses to establish a fact, and we darshen -- the fact it established equally regardless of the number -- terei kemei'ah (2 [witnesses] are like 100).</p>\n\n<p>\"Shanayim eidim\" means \"two witnesses\", with the emphasis on the two-ness. Which fits how chazal darshen the pasuq (mishnah on Makkos 5b), that it's all about 2 or more being a unit. And either all as falsified as eidim zomemim or none. Notice the focus is on the number of the group more than the function of each unit.</p>\n\n<p>Entirely pulled out of my own head, though.</p>\n\n\n",

It is now clear that they had a problem with her singing to her small children on the subway. Her son has special needs, he is largely nonverbal, and he sometimes has seizures. When she sings to her children, her only intention is to soothe them (especially in the event of a seizure) and keep them calm and quiet.  As a mother traveling on NYC public transportation alone with her children sometimes at night, she was intimidated and felt  a bit threatened by these men glaring at her.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, everyone is entitled to feel however they want to feel, and these men are free to believe whatever they wish.  But it is possible to feel something without causing distress to another person. It is possible to keep your feelings to yourself, or to share your feelings with likeminded individuals.  I am wondering if Jewis custom, practice, law, etc, has anything to say on this issue:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question</strong></p>\n\n<p>Someone who may or may not be Jewish is doing something that would generally (in the broader society) be considered inoffensive in a public place, but is or may be a violation of Jewish law.  Most people in the broader society, including the person doing the activity, don't know of the law in question and\nthink the activity is normal.  An Orthodox person in the same area believes that this activity is problematic.</p>\n\n<p>Is there justification for the Jewish person to cause discomfort or distress to strangers in response to an unintentional and inadvertent offense?  What sources are applicable to this issue?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This question is not about <em>kol isha</em>; it is about the response.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Just by way of background: Kol Isha, or literally the voice of a woman, is a law that falls under the category of Sneas, or modesty.  It was designed by the Rabbis to keep men from lusting after women due to man's nature to lust.  It is a serious issue for observant men, which is probably why they reacted.  It can be very difficult to avoid looking/listening.</p>\n\n<p>The law of Kol Isha does not apply to a non-Jew. We do not live in a Torah society, we are  supposedly governed by non-religious secular civil government. A subway is a public place run under civil law not Torah law.</p>\n\n<p>As Jews we are the \"chosen\" people, we are supposed to be \"a light unto the nations.\" That behavior is clearly not acting the way we're supposed to act.  I think that men should be able to keep their lust under control.</p>\n\n<p>The answer to your question is a resounding NO! It's not acceptable to treat somebody that way. I can give many halachic examples of how horrible it is to embarrass somebody that completely overrides any sneeyas issues that would arise in this case.</p>\n\n\n",

If anyone but the married woman of the house is lighting, the tradition is to light two. Including if a wife isn't home and the husband is lighting. Or your case.</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher rebbe invented the practice of all girls lighting. It hasn't been going on long enough to be qualify as a \"minhag\", yet. Rabbi JB Soloveitchik advised families that knew their family minhag not to leave their minhag.</p>\n\n<p>As for making a berakhah, for Sepharadim -- the Shulchan Arukh (OC 263:8) would not let someone who is adding light to a room that is already lit make a berakhah. For example, if two families are sharing a dining room, the second person to light shouldn't make a berakhah. So the mother would have to light first, and then the daughter would light without a berakhah. For Ashkenazim -- the Rama disagrees, and allows a berakhah when lighting additional lamps in an already lit room. So, the daughter can make a berakhah in this situation.</p>\n\n<p>(Side note: ideally, one should turn on the electric lights in the dining room as well, so that one is making a berakhah on the lights actually being used for the meal. But because of the above, an Ashkenazi can make a berakhah on the Shabbos candles either way, it's just less than ideal to only make the berakhah on the additional light and not the primary light source.)</p>\n\n<p>Others raised the topic of how many lights should be lit when it's the wife or someone else lighting for an entire household: two, or the minhag of one per person, possibly plus a \"fine\" of one for each week missed until now.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not know your minhag, I would advocate for just lighting for Shamor and Zakhor. I would like to see the other custom disappear entirely, frankly. I think of the childless wife who passes by the window seeing 8, 9, 13 candles, and feeling pain. Or the mother who lost one of her children, who starts her Shabbos with a sad reminder.</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps a man complimenting their modest look might have a corrective effect.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I will give you my opinion as young woman. I think you should not comment her dressing at all whether she dresses modestly or not. You should try to not even look at woman in that way.\nIf a woman in not modestly dressed, other women from community should instruct her how to dress. If she is modestly dressed than she will not receive such comments and she will know she is dressed appropriately. It 's not your mission to give her compliment like that. If all the other woman are immodestly dressed then maybe the community is too liberal for you and you should think of finding more suitable community.\nBut I have a feeling that something else is going on here :) if for example you seriously like the girl, that's ok, but make your intentions clear and straight, don't comment her dressing - just start a conversation about the real topic.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I work in an all-women's religious workplace, but we certainly have visitors who come from different backgrounds than we do.

Commenting (favorably or otherwise) on her mode of dress is way, way over the line for a man.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, this is not a halachic ruling (although I suspect that halacha could be found to back it up, halacha to back up a more lenient approach might well be found as well). If personal sensitivity is being solicited, here you have it.</p>\n\n\n",

If there aren't 9 people concentrating on his blessings it is close to his blessings being in vain. Therefore, each person should pretend that he is among the necessary 9 people ...</p>\n\n<p>I.e. the above emphasizes the importance of every person listening to the chazzan and answering \"Amen\" even if there are far more than 9 people. You have to hear the chazzan no matter what.</p>\n\n<p>It's unclear from your question as to <strong>why</strong> you can't hear the chazzan. If every else is schmoozing, then, unless the Rabbi takes control and makes them stop, it is very difficult for you to request it. Trust me, I've been yelled at numerous times for asking even 1 person to be quiet! (Long, sad story!). In that case, by all means, find a quieter shul.</p>\n\n<p>If the shul is quiet, but you're too far away from the chazzan to hear him, can't you request a seat closer to the chazzan? I find it hard to believe that no one would accommodate your request. Even if you have to stand the whole time or most of the time, this should be possible.</p>\n\n<p>If you're hearing impaired, that's another story. In many cases, you may actually be exempt from having to hear the chazzan, anyway. (As for hearing the shofar via hearing aids and implants, there's a pamphlet discussing these issues.

So if there is only one mourner (or multiple mourners who are going to say Kaddish together) then say one Kaddish at the end, and if there are multiple mourners who each want their own Kaddish then stick another one in the middle at a reasonable stopping point. This logic applies to any series of verses/study after which Kaddish is to be said (eg. Alenu <em>and</em> Shir Shel Yom <em>and</em> Barkhi Nafshi etc.).

    "content": "# What rules need to be followed in order for a non-Jewish professional chef to cook Kosher food for a Jewish customer?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm a non-Jewish professional chef in a restaurant, and I am marginally aware of kosher dietary restrictions.  I know that the food itself, as well as the pots, pans, and other utensils used in preparing the food have to meet certain requirements, and of course certain food items and combinations are not allowed.  I have heard that some Jews don't eat bread baked by non-Jews, but I don't know much else about what goes into working at a kosher restaurant.  To be specific, I'm a line cook/sous chef, not an executive chef, so I'm a worker, not a manager.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, there are restrictions on what a non-Jew may cook for a Jew; eg., it would be ok for a non-Jew to cook any kind of food for mixed clientele (i.e., Jews and non-Jews).  It would be ok for Jews to cook average, everyday food for Jews or mixed clientele.  But it would not be ok to cook fine cuisine for an exclusively Jewish clientele.  I'm curious how this works in a kosher restaurant with non-Jewish cooks, so assume that the executive chef is Jewish, if that matters.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My question:<br>\n<strong>What rules need to be followed in order for a non-Jewish professional chef to cook Kosher food for Jewish customers (eg., in a restaurant setting)?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I'm going to assume that you are talking about just cooking and not managing a restaurant or other food business.</p>\n\n<p>The kosher Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood is supervised by the local <em>Va'ad Harabbanim</em> (Rabbinical board.) Nearly all the chefs are non-Jewish Chinese, though I think one might be Jewish (He does speak Hebrew well but with a Chinese dialect. And he wears a \"Shmulke Bernstein\" yarmulke.)</p>\n\n<p>The place has a <em>mashgiach</em> (supervisor) who is there constantly. The mashgiach or one of his assistants turns on the stove and supervises the deliveries, the food prep (inspects veggies for bugs) and watches the cooking process. One specific item that you may not be allowed to touch is wine. However. most kosher restaurants serve <em>yayin mevushal</em> (boiled wine) which avoids the problem of a non-Jew handling it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-issues-bishul.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">This link, from Star-K</a>, one of the main Orthodox kosher supervising companies in the U.S. explains the rules of <em>bishul akum</em> - cooking by a non-Jew. The <em>mashgiach</em> has multiple duties, as mentioned, above, and he may add his own stringencies in addition to the rules mentioned. It is important to know, that even if the food itself is kosher in its raw or delivered form, <em>bishul akum</em> might make the food non-kosher. The linked article is for information purposes. The <em>mashgiach</em> makes the final decision on what is or is not considered <em>bishul akum</em>, so it's critical to follow his instructions.</p>\n\n<p>In some areas, one may not allowed to eat his 100% kosher lunch anywhere in the restaurant if his lunch is considered <em>chametz</em> or non Kosher for Passover. This may sound strange, and it is rare, but there are caterers, esp. commissaries, that may not serve the public, directly, but prepare packaged food for industrial use, such as airlines or kosher meal plans for hospitals, etc. Passover has an additional restriction to year-round kosher rules in that no leavened products may contact any food. So, the factory may insist that if you eat pastrami on rye for lunch, you must do so outside the factory itself even in January. This way, their products are guaranteed to be \"Kosher for Passover\" constantly. They do this for two reasons, mainly. 1) Cleaning a factory for Passover is a laborious time-consuming expensive process, and 2) Since these products are packaged and shrink-wrapped and perhaps frozen long term, the consumer / airline, etc. can buy these well in advance of Passover and if there is left-over, they may use it on Passover, as well.</p>\n\n<p>In short, as long as you follow directions of the mashgiach, have fun and cook their food as much as you want!</p>\n\n<p>Please inform me if I understood your scenario to be limited to just cooking using their utensils and not your own.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are a few interesting points to address here. I am not going to go into a long discussion on all of the <em>halachot</em> of <em>kashrut</em> here because those can be found in depth around this site and elsewhere. The fact of the matter is, if you are a grunt in the kitchen of a kosher restaurant, the ingredients and utensils provided to you will be kosher and you don't have to worry about those particular issues. Since we are talking about a kosher restaurant and not a non-Jew cooking for a Jew at his private place of residence, there will be a <em>kashrut</em> supervisor in the kitchen called the <em>mashgiach</em> who is hired by a <em>kashrut</em> supervisory agency, and you should just do as the <em>mashgiach</em> tells you.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the second paragraph of your question, I understand you to be asking about the issue of <em>bishul aku\"m</em> (cooking of idolaters), although you may not have been familiar with the Hebrew expression. Although <em>aku\"m</em> is an abbreviation which means \"idolaters,\" in this case it actually applies to all non-Jews even if they do not worship idols.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Talmud</em> (<a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=4046&size=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avodah Zarah 35b</a>) prohibits eating food that was prepared entirely by non-Jews in order to reduce the amount of interaction Jews had with non-Jews to prevent inter-marriage. This is mentioned in some of the other answers, but not properly addressed. There is dispute among the rabbis about what is considered \"entirely prepared by non-Jews.\" In this regard, <em>Ashkenazim</em> are generally more lenient that <em>Sephardim</em>. I have heard lenient rulings simply requiring that the pilot-light have been lit by a Jew and allowing a non-Jew to even turn the stove/oven on from this Jewish-lit pilot light. I have heard rulings as stringent as requiring a Jewish person to actually participate in some meaningful way in the actual cooking (not just the preparing) of the food such as stirring the pot occasionally. I have not heard of an opinion that requires the Jew to do almost all of the cooking; however, I am not discounting the possibility that such an opinion exists. The restaurant's <em>mashgiach</em> will tell you what his agency's standards are for the requirement of Jewish participation in the cooking.</p>\n\n<p>Your understanding about cooking for mixed/Jewish clientele and ordinary food vs. fine cuisine is not exactly correct. The prohibition of <em>bishul aku\"m</em> exists regardless of who the chef was cooking for. It is prohibited even if the chef intended to cook for a mixed crowd of Jews and non-Jews. You are correct, however, that there is a difference between ordinary food and food \"fit to be raised up to the table of a king\" (<a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=4051&size=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avodah Zarah 38a</a>). Again, there is a dispute over what is considered such food. The <em>Chazon Ish</em> holds that any food which a king would eat falls under the prohibition of <em>bishul aku\"m</em>. Therefore, since the King of England eats canned sardines for breakfast, canned sardines that are prepared by a non-Jew are not kosher. Rav Soloveitchik, on the other hand, has a more lenient position. He holds that only food suitable to be served at a state dinner has the prohibition of <em>bishul aku\"m</em>. Therefore, pretty much any canned (otherwise kosher) food is permitted according to this position, even if prepared by a non-Jew.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of your question (based on the question's title) is that you were asking about this particular issue of <em>kashrut</em> and not about <strong>all</strong> of the rules of <em>kashrut</em>. That more comprehensive question is probably too broad to address on this site. As DanF says in his answer, as long as you follow the <em>mashgiach</em>'s instructions, you will be just fine. This has been an attempt at explaining some of the issues that come into play when a non-Jew cooks for a Jew.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>You need to be Jewish, or you need to have a Jewish supervisor, who will make sure that the law is followed and who will light the flames. Kosher laws are very complex, chef must be very proficient with those. For a start, it seems you are not aware you will need two separate kitchens. And even if you learn it all, it does not matter, you will still need a Jewish supervisor, because no one can be sure that you will really follow them if those laws don't mean anything to you. </p>\n\n\n",

Since I joined this site, I have been led to believe that technically, most of what she did - turning lights, heat, stoves and ovens, etc, on and off - would be a violation of the law according to the most strict interpretations anyway, because asking someone to do forbidden things is equivalent to doing those things yourself.</p>\n\n<p>But I am wondering if it would be permissible for a gentile to <em>volunteer</em> to serve as a <em>Shabbos Goy</em>.

    "content": "# Is Hanukkah a holiday or a festival? Is there a difference?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recall hearing that Hanukkah (or maybe Purim) is a festival, rather than a holiday. Is this true? Is there a difference?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I don't think there's a formal English terminology what people would call \"festival\" vs. \"holiday\", but there certainly are distinctions.</p>\n\n<p>The Jewish holidays such as Passover, Sukkot [booths], Rosh Hashanah (new year) and the like are spelled out in the Five Books of Moses. They all include \"no-work\" days. So you will not see an observant Jew at the office on those days. </p>\n\n<p>Hanukkah and Purim are both post-Mosaic (Purim described in the Book of Esther, and Hanukkah in the Talmud), so they are known as holidays of rabbinic, rather than \"biblical\" force. Additionally, when they were instituted, they allowed people to work. So they're actually more minor holidays, and plenty of observant Jews do work those days -- though they have to handle a few rituals over the course of the day (often before or after work).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It's hard to answer this question concretely because \"festival\" is an English word and Jewish concepts are not generally categorized by English words. But I will attempt to answer this question as well as I can.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, with respect to Jewish observance, the word festival usually has one of two meanings. The first corresponds to the three pilgrimage festivals. These are Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot. Going by that definition, neither Purim nor Chanukah would fall into the category of \"festival.\"</p>\n\n<p>The other usage of \"festival\" that I am aware of refers to Jewish holidays that are called \"mo'ed\" in Hebrew. The word \"mo'ed\" means appointed time. Purim is called a mo'ed so using that definition, one could call Purim a festival.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In addition to the answers above, perhaps I can summarize things in terminology. As stated, the term \"festival\" or \"holiday\" doesn't translate well into a specific Hebrew word, when discussing the \"important\" days mentioned in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Let's view a key verse in the Torah that appears before the entire list of holidays. Focus on the <strong>bolded</strong> Hebrew terms more than the English, as the English almost always misses some nuance.</p>\n\n<p>Leviticus 23:2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דַּבֵּ֞ר אֶל־בְּנֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ וְאָמַרְתָּ֣ אֲלֵהֶ֔ם <strong>מוֹעֲדֵ֣י</strong>\n  יְהוָ֔ה אֲשֶׁר־תִּקְרְא֥וּ אֹתָ֖ם <strong>מִקְרָאֵ֣י קֹ֑דֶשׁ</strong> אֵ֥לֶּה הֵ֖ם\n  מוֹעֲדָֽי׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: The <strong>appointed\n  seasons</strong> of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be <strong>holy\n  convocations</strong>, even these are My appointed seasons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are two terms used here - מועד and מקרא קדש. For purposes of this discussion, the first term is a superset of the 2nd term. I.e. - a  מועד such as Passover, lasts 7 days, according to the Torah (I don't want to delve into why in Israel there are 7 and outside Israel 8; separate discussion.) Only the 1st & last days are מקרא קדש  , meaning that work is forbidden meaning that work is forbidden. But the entire 7 days are called a מועד.</p>\n\n<p>If you read all of Leviticus chapter 23, you will find a list of all the מועדים, which include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shabbat</li>\n<li>Pesach</li>\n<li>Shavuot (not mentioned by name, here)</li>\n<li>Rosh Hashanna )here, called Zichron Teru'ah)</li>\n<li>Yom Hakipurim (a.k.a. Yom Kippur)</li>\n<li>Succot</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of these, the term מקרא קודש is used for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shabbat</li>\n<li>1st day & 7th day Passover</li>\n<li>Shavu'ot</li>\n<li>Rosh Hashanna</li>\n<li>Yom Hakipurim</li>\n<li>Succot (1st & 8th day) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, what's excluded?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rosh Hodesh</li>\n<li>Chanukah & Purim (neither of which are mentioned in the Torah, anywhere)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note, that Tish'a B'av is called a מועד as per  Eicha (Lamentations) 1:15. However, work is permitted (part of) that day, and it is not a Torah listed holiday.</p>\n\n<p>There is another common term for \"holiday\" called יום טוב Yom Tov which means, literally \"Good day\". This term is commonly used to refer to one of the non-work days that I mentioned above. However, Purim, a day on which work <strong>is</strong> allowed is also called a  יום טוב as seen in Esther 9:19. So, we see that this term does not necessarily imply that it is a day where work is prohibited.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the basis for the focus on the difference between Jews and everybody else?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have noticed that in a large portion of the questions and answers here, the distinction between Jews and other people is repeatedly emphasized.  I know enough about the Tanakh to understand that Judaism is a very unique covenant between G-d and His chosen people, but the degree of emphasis is surprising to me.  </p>\n\n<p>Case in point: There is a word that, according to the glossary, is specifically used when comparing Judaism to other religions, Jews to other people, the Torah to other books, etc. - \"<a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1294/9723\">L'vhadil!</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The answer is that this is one of the differences between a Jew and <strong>l'havdil</strong> a gentile.<br>\n  -  <a href=\"http://www.neveh.org/price/pricesensitivities.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shlomo Price</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Honest politician” is an oxymoron, from the local level all the way up to Congress and the White House it’s the same story, Republican or Democrat, Jew or <strong>l’havdil</strong> Gentile...<br>\n  -  <a href=\"http://crownheights.info/nyc-news/469932/sheldon-silver-arrested-on-corruption-charges/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The question isn't specific to l'havdil though, it is about the general phenomenon.  </p>\n\n<p>Another example:  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/59457/is-there-any-obligation-for-a-jew-to-save-a-gentiles-life\">Is there any obligation for a Jew to save a gentile's life?</a></p>\n\n<p>And the answer to the question of  <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1358/are-you-allowed-to-save-a-non-jews-life-on-shabbos/11733#11733\">Are you allowed to save a non-Jew's life on Shabbos?</a> is \"Yes, but mostly because there would be backlash if you didn't\".  </p>\n\n<p>Instead of taking the position that life is life, and identity is secondary, the emphasis here is on whether or not the life belongs to a Jew.  </p>\n\n<p>Why is there such an intense focus on the difference between Jews, Judaism, Hebrew Scriptures, and everyone and everything else?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As many others have mentioned before, when creating laws, you HAVE to make certain distinctions. One of the biggest blindspots i've noticed with Christians trying to understand Judaism, is that they view everything from a theological perspective, and forget one very important point. Modern Christians are used to living in a society where the government is run by laws created by men, and the laws are changed, added to, and developed solely on what new situations dictate. Whereas in the times of the Talmud, or in the scope of the Biblical text, the Torah is not only the basis for religion, it's the basis for how you should run an entire country. And since the holy is mixed with the mundane, you will find distinctions between priest and normal israelite in the law, distinctions between the convert and the normal israelite (converts would not have an inheritance to the land of Israel like the 12 tribes would), and the list goes on. Just like in the United States, we have certain laws for citizens and non citizens. Non citizens are not allowed to go to certain schools, or have drivers licenses, etc. It's (hopefully) not because we feel we are superior to them, but that at some point we need to have some distinguishments.</p>\n<p>For the Torah, this is also evident, and it's easy to focus on the abundance of scriptures for how Holy we as children of Israel are/should be. We are supposed to be a nation of priests, we are God's chosen, we are \"His Children.\"</p>\n<p>But i think sometimes we forget some other scriptures, the ones that are a response to those who think we are better than other nations, or holier, or that God has only done wondrous things for us. Scriptures that should humble us and help us remember, that at the end of the day, we all stand before the same Judge, and He doesn't pick favorites.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amos 9:7-8</p>\n<p>הֲלוֹא כִבְנֵי כֻשִׁיִּים אַתֶּם לִי בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, נְאֻם-יְהוָה:\nהֲלוֹא אֶת-יִשְׂרָאֵל, הֶעֱלֵיתִי מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם, וּפְלִשְׁתִּיִּים\nמִכַּפְתּוֹר, וַאֲרָם מִקִּיר.</p>\n<p>הִנֵּה עֵינֵי אֲדֹנָי יְהוִה, בַּמַּמְלָכָה הַחַטָּאָה, וְהִשְׁמַדְתִּי אֹתָהּ, מֵעַל פְּנֵי הָאֲדָמָה:  אֶפֶס, כִּי לֹא הַשְׁמֵיד אַשְׁמִיד אֶת-בֵּית יַעֲקֹב--נְאֻם-יְהוָה.</p>\n<p>Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto Me, O children of\nIsrael? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land\nof Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?</p>\n<p>Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom [Israel], and I\nwill destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not\nutterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As has been discussed in the comments on the question, I think your understanding of the word \"l'havdil\" is not quite accurate. \"L'havdil\" really just means a distinction between things that are comparable in a particular sense, but not in a general sense (because one of the items of comparison is \"holier\" for some definition of that word). For example, I could say, \"The Torah is written in Hebrew, and so is (l'havdil) the Hebrew translation of Harry Potter.\"</p>\n\n<p>Your main question is about why there is a focus on the difference between Jews and everybody else (on this site and, perhaps, in general). The basic reason for that is simply that Jews and non-Jews are in different halachic categories. As such, the laws that apply to individuals are different for Jews and for non-Jews. </p>\n\n<p>This site in particular deals extensively with halacha. As such, it is frequently important to distinguish between Jews and gentiles because the halacha is different. Jews have responsibilities that non-Jews do not have. In addition, sometimes a <em>Jew's</em> responsibilities are different depending on whether he lives in an area that is predominantly Jewish or otherwise.  We focus on the difference when it is relevant. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Hirschensohn\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Hirschensohn</a> rejects the notion that this word (l'havdil) should be used to distinguish Jews from non-Jews. See his commentary to Horayot (Jerusalem, 1926), part 3, p.6a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזה אין לנו לומר כי הלא אב אחד לכלנו א-ל אחד בראנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Hirschensohn says that it is wrong to say הגוי להבדיל since it is precisely the Jews whom God chose to separate as his special people... Yet as mentioned already, R. Hirschensohn rejects the usage of this word when it comes to Jews and non-Jews. In addition to what I already quoted, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כונת האומר \"להבדיל\" הוא כמו להבדיל בין הקדש ובין החול, ואין הבדלה כזאת בין ישראל לעמים, כי כל בני תמותה נבראו בצלם אלקים וחייבים בשבע מצות רק אותנו הבדיל אלקים לו לחייבנו בתרי\"ג מצות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The intent of the word \"l'havdil\" is similar to separation between the holy and the profane, but there is not such separation between the Jews and the non-Jews, for all people are created in the image of God and are obligated in the seven (basic) commandments. Just Jews were separated to in being obligated on 613 commandments.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2014/06/assorted-comments.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://seforim.blogspot.com/2014/06/assorted-comments.html</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Substitue passage for Barechu on Friday Night\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In several nusah Sefard siddurim I have, there's a passage from the Zohar printed before Barechu in the erev shabbat section, to be said by individuals in the case of there being no minyan. This passage includes the phrases 'barchu et adonai hamevorach' and 'baruch adonai hamevorach le'olam va'ed' so that you have a sort of mock/zecher recitation of Barechu.</p>\n\n<p>My questions are: </p>\n\n<p>(a) Why have I only seen this in Sefard siddurim?, and </p>\n\n<p>(b) Why is this passage only printed for erev Shabbat? It seems like if its recitation is an appropriate option at one time it should be good for any time. Is there something special about erev Shabbat that makes having no Barechu or 'Barechu-like' liturgical piece especially problematic?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>(a) Because only sefard says kegavna before barechu.<br>\n(b) The reason is because that passage of zohar is about the moments when shabbos comes in and parallels some kabbalistic stuff to different points in the prayer service. So when there is a minyan we cut the passage short and segue into barechu, but when there isn't we might as well read the rest of the passage.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Personally, I've only seen this in Chabad's Siddur (actually might have seen it elsewhere as well come to think of it). </p>\n\n<p>In short, without getting into details, as far as I can tell, it is based upon the kabbalah/the teachings of the Arizal about the \"Barchu\" before Shabbos Maariv. Therefore, for one that is missing out on this from their davening, an insert from the Zohar that contains the \"missing words\" has been placed there to compensate. Note that the passage not only contains the words of barchu for both the chazzan and congregation, but other words as well in order that an individual is not saying barchu (inyan d'kedusha without a minyan).</p>\n\n<p>As far as why this is only in Nusach Sefard (or in my case Chabad, both chasidic) and not also in Nusach Ashkenaz or Sefardi; since it is seemingly a mystical inyan, I doubt the standard Nusach Ashkenaz (besides maybe the GRA?) would be concerned (no mesorah etc.). With regards to Nusach Sefardi, if I had to guess, it was an innovation/chiddush of a chasidic rebbe in Europe that never made it's way to the Middle East (until recently of course).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why is this passage only printed for erev Shabbat?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's not. I mean, <em>this</em> passage is, but many <em>sidurim</em> have other passages that are said instead of various other instances of \"<em>Bar'chu</em>\", <em>chatzi kadish</em>, and <em>kadish shalem</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the meaning of the term יום טוב (Yom Tov)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I did a search in Tanac\"h for the term יום טוב (along with any prefixes to the term)</p>\n\n<p>The term appears a few times in Esther, esp. in the 2nd to last chapter. One example is:</p>\n\n<p>Esther 9:19:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עַל־כֵּ֞ן הַיְּהוּדִ֣ים הפרוזים [הַפְּרָזִ֗ים] הַיֹּשְׁבִים֮ בְּעָרֵ֣י\n  הַפְּרָזוֹת֒ עֹשִׂ֗ים אֵ֠ת י֣וֹם אַרְבָּעָ֤ה עָשָׂר֙ לְחֹ֣דֶשׁ אֲדָ֔ר\n  שִׂמְחָ֥ה וּמִשְׁתֶּ֖ה וְי֣וֹם ט֑וֹב וּמִשְׁל֥וֹחַ מָנ֖וֹת אִ֥ישׁ\n  לְרֵעֵֽהוּ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns,\n  make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and\n  feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I also found an example in I Samuel 25:8:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שְׁאַ֨ל אֶת־נְעָרֶ֜יךָ וְיַגִּ֣ידוּ לָ֗ךְ וְיִמְצְא֨וּ הַנְּעָרִ֥ים\n  חֵן֙ בְּעֵינֶ֔יךָ כִּֽי־עַל־<strong>י֥וֹם ט֖וֹב</strong> בָּ֑נוּ תְּנָה־נָּ֗א אֵת֩\n  אֲשֶׁ֨ר תִּמְצָ֤א יָֽדְךָ֙ לַעֲבָדֶ֔יךָ וּלְבִנְךָ֖ לְדָוִֽד׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Ask your young men, and they will tell you; wherefore let the young\n  men find favour in your eyes; for we come on a good day; give, please,\n  whatsoever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son\n  David.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does the term יום טוב always imply a day of prohibition from work (prohibition against <em>Melacha</em>)? People wish each other \"Good Yom Tov\" on days such as Pesach, Shavu'ot and Sucot, but not during <em>Hol Hamo'ed</em>. I don't hear this expression used on Shabbat even though work is prohibited. On the other hand, on Purim, work is permitted, but I also don't hear the expression \"Good Yom Tov\" being used. And, for Purim, Esther calls it a Yom Tov, but people are working.</p>\n\n<p>So, there seems to be a dichotomy. On the one hand, Shabbat which has a work prohibition is not called a יום טוב , but Purim which <strong>is</strong> called a יום טוב has work allowed. What's going on?</p>\n\n<p>Also, does the term in Samuel also refer to a holiday of some type, or is this being used a general term meaning \"a propitious day\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but... \nThe Maharal in an exposition of Eruv Tavshilin describes the status of the 3 different tiers of days as paralleling the 3 different stages of human history. Chol, the regular work-week days, parallel olam hazeh, this world where we toil toward an ultimate reward. Shabbath, the day of rest, parallels olam haba when one reaps one's rewards and there is no longer any work (and thus no longer the ability to earn any more merit). Yom Tov is the bridge between the two, where m'lecheth ochel nefesh, that work that is itself directed toward the enjoyments of the day, is allowed, but no other toil. This is paralleled by the messianic age which is the transition between Olam Hazeh and Olam Haba, which is without the suffering of this world, but in which <em>mi shetarach b'erev shabbos...</em> - those who prepared already in this world, can continue to acquire merit for the world to come (the idea allegorized by eruv tavshilin). This concept of \"yom tov\" - a good day, involves the general prohibition of melocho, but retains the direct work that results in the final oneg. I believe it is not only a concept of the moadim (and would have as well been for Purim had the masses accepted it) but also for the bringer of a personal korban on the day he brings it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I do not know the origins of the word יום טוב, I believe a in-depth analysis of the רמב״ם in הלכות שביתת יום טוב א:א. The רמב״ם writes שֵׁשֶׁת יָמִים הָאֵלּוּ שֶׁאֲסָרָן הַכָּתוּב בַּעֲשִׂיַּת מְלָאכָה שֶׁהֵן רִאשׁוֹן וּשְׁבִיעִי שֶׁל פֶּסַח וְרִאשׁוֹן וּשְׁמִינִי שֶׁל חַג הַסֻּכּוֹת וּבְיוֹם חַג הַשָּׁבוּעוֹת וּבְאֶחָד לַחֹדֶשׁ הַשְּׁבִיעִי הֵן הַנִּקְרָאִין <strong>יָמִים טוֹבִים</strong>. וּשְׁבִיתַת כֻּלָּן שָׁוָה שֶׁהֵן אֲסוּרִין בְּכָל מְלֶאכֶת עֲבוֹדָה חוּץ מִמְּלָאכָה שֶׁהִיא לְצֹרֶךְ אֲכִילָה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמות יב טז) \"אַךְ אֲשֶׁר יֵאָכֵל לְכָל נֶפֶשׁ\" וְגוֹ': The רמב״ם is peculiar since he lists ראש השנה as being one of the יומים טובים. What is the connection between all these days? Its not the קרבן חגיגה since ראש השנה doesn't have one nor is it based off אסור מלאכה since יום הכיפורים is not mentioned in the list?</p>\n<p>A possible answer for the רמב״ם is that there are צווי דינים to a יו״ט. There is a component of an אסור מלאכה, and there is a component of a מצוות אוכל נפש. A יו״ט is not considered a יו״ט without one of these components. The ריאה for the רמב״ם is the גמ׳ in מגילה referenced above. The גמ׳ on ה׳ ע״ב mentions that original אסתר wanted to create פורים as a יו״ט however the יהודים only accepted the מִשְׁתֶּה וְשִׂמְחָה upon themselves and not the אסור מלאכה. The way גמ׳ learns this דין based off the fact the פסוק does not use the לשון of יום טוב a second time (in ט כ״ב).</p>\n<p>However other ראשונים would seem to argue on this רמב״ם. The ריטב״א writes in סוכה לח ע״א that even חול המועד is considered a יו״ט. The רשב״א says the same in שו\"ת הרשב\"א חלק ה רט״ו. This is how the שו״ע פסקין in אורח חיים\nת״צ ס״ג. However the (מג״א(שם סק״א and the ט״ז ופמ״ג ס׳ תרסח סק״א seem to argue and possible learn like the רמב״ם.</p>\n\n\n",

Here are a few of those sources: </p>\n\n<h2>Avot 3:18</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הוא היה אומר חביב אדם שנברא בצלם חבה יתירה נודעת לו שנברא בצלם שנאמר בצלם אלהים עשה את האדם</p>\n  \n  <p>[Rabbi Akiva] used to say: Beloved is man, for he was created in the image [of God]; an even greater expression of love is that it was made known to him that he was created in the image [of God], as it is stated: \"For in the image of God He made man.\" (Genesis 9:6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Ahron Soloveitchik, who publicly spoke and wrote in favor of civil rights in the 1960s, made the following connection to modern times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From the standpoint of the Torah, there can be no distinction between one human being\n  and another on the basis of race or color. Any discrimination shown to a human being on\n  account of the color of his or her skin constitutes loathsome barbarity...[Avot 3:18] implies that every human being, regardless of religion, race, origin or creed is endowed with Divine dignity. Consequently, all people are to be treated with equal respect and dignity. [<em>Logic of the Heart, Logic of the Mind</em>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The mishnah in Avot is associated with halakhic principals known as:</p>\n\n<h2>Human Dignity and Righteousness</h2>\n\n<p>Derived from Genesis 1:27 (\"In the image of God He created Man\"), <em>kavod habriyot</em> (human dignity) is a concept discussed throughout talmudic literature regarding legal exemptions based on undignified situations. Rabbi Ahron Soloveitchik writes that alongside the concept of <em>tzedek</em> (righteousness), it is the Jewish cornerstone of civil rights. He refers to a discussion in the Jerusalem Talmud (Bava Metzia 2:5), in which Rabbi Shimon ben Shetach returned a pearl to an Arab pagan, after the pearl was discovered on the donkey he acquired from the Arab. Although it would not technically be considered stealing, Rabbi Shimon ben Shetach argued: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מה אתון סברין שמעון בן שטח ברברין הוה. בעי הוה שמעון בן שטח משמע בריך אלההון דיהודאי מאגר כל הדין עלמא</p>\n  \n  <p>“Do you think that I am such a barbarian? I am more interested in\n  hearing the exclamation, 'Blessed be the God of the Jews' from the mouths of pagans than\n  I am in making a living.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is how Rabbi Soloveitchik understands this <em>Yerushalmi</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In this story, Shimon ben Shetach gives a remarkable definition of the term\n  “barbarian.” According to him, anyone who fails to apply a uniform standard\n  of <em>mishpat</em>, justice, and <em>tzedek</em>, righteousness, to all human beings regardless of origin, color, or creed is deemed barbaric.\n  From this Yerushalmi, coupled with the concept of <em>k’vod habriyos</em>, one must assume that\n  those people who refuse to grant any human being the same degree of respect that they\n  offer to their own race or nationality are adopting a barbaric attitude.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The concept of pursuing justice and righteousness, of course, is based on \"Justice, justice, you shall pursue\" (Deuteronomy 16:20) and other biblical injunctions to form courts maintaining justice in society. </p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in the comments, many of the Jewish activists during the civil rights movement came from non-Orthodox denominations and may not have relied on or accurately depicted traditional Jewish texts in defense of their actions. We do know, however, that many Orthodox leaders and institutions were in favor of social change, and fought for civil rights based on Jewish principals. See <a href=\"https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/orthodox-jewry-and-the-civil-rights-movement/\">this link</a> for the work of other Orthodox leaders in the 1960s. </p>\n\n\n",

There are a number of opinions, I will discuss one of the most famous, that of the Rambam in the <em>Moreh</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I've included the pertinent parts of the extensive discussion of the subject of malakhim in the <em>Moreh</em>, down below. To summarize the Rambam's points, Malakh HASHEM can refer to a variety of entities, forces, thoughts and/or persons who are carrying out the will of Elohim in the world. The malakh Hagar encountered was either a Bat Qol or a person/entity sent by Elohim to deliver a message and/or carry out instructions (in this case, to save her and Yishmael). Likewise the flaming bush and cloud were either forces or entities directed by Elohim to manifest in the physical world, so acted as conduits between Moshe/am Yisrael and Elohim. </p>\n\n<p>Yet these can also be described as HASHEM directly, as can be understood through a simple analogy: when one receives an important letter from person A, the recipient is <em>not</em> engaging in dialogue with the messenger (the mailman, or the letter itself) but with person A who caused the message to come to be and the messenger to deliver it. Or speaking with someone via skype, one talks to the other person on the line, rather than directing attention to the device which is the vehicle for that transmission. In the same way, the Tanakh (and we) can speak of HASHEM \"doing\" or \"saying\" this or that, even though we know that it is being carried out via intermediaries (\"malakhim\"). </p>\n\n<p>MN:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In all parts of the Tanakh, every act of Elohim is described as being\n  performed by malakhim. \"Malakh\" means\" messenger\", hence everyone who\n  is entrusted with a certain mission [from Elohim] is a malakh. Even\n  the movements of the natural world are sometimes due to the action of\n  a malakh, when such movements serve the purpose of the Creator, who\n  endowed it with the power of performing that movement: e.g., \"Elohim\n  has sent His malakh, and shut the lions' mouths so that they have not\n  hurt me\" (Daniel 6:22). Another instance may be seen in the movements\n  of Bilam's ass, described as caused by a malakh. The elements are also\n  called malakhim: \"Who makes winds His malakhim, flaming fire His\n  ministers\" (Tehillim 104:4). There is no doubt that the word \"malakh\"\n  is used of a messenger sent by humans, e.g.,\"And Yaakov sent malakhim\"\n  (Bereshit 32:4), of a navi, e.g.,\"And Malakh HASHEM came up from\n  Gilgal to Bochim\" (Shoftim 2:1), \"And He sent a malakh, and has\n  brought us out of Egypt\" (Bemidbar 20:16). It is also used of Ideals,\n  perceived by neviim in prophetic visions, and of humanity's animal\n  powers, as will be explained in another place.  </p>\n  \n  <p>... </p>\n  \n  <p>In other passages\n  Chazal expressed it more firmly: \"Elohim does nothing without\n  consulting the host above\". On the words, \"what they have already\n  made\" (Qohelet 2:12), the following remark is made in Bereshit Rabba\n  and in Midrash Qohelet: \"It is not said 'what He has made,' but 'what\n  they have made'; hence we infer that He, as it were, with His court,\n  have agreed upon the form of each of the limbs of a person before placing\n  it in its position, as it is said, 'He has made and established you'\"\n  (Devarim 32:6). In Bereshit Rabba 51 it is also stated that wherever\n  the term \"and HASHEM\" occurs in the Tanakh, HASHEM with His court is\n  to be understood. These passages do not convey the idea that Elohim\n  spoke, thought, reflected, or that He consulted and employed the\n  opinion of other beings... They only show that all parts of the\n  Universe, even the limbs of animals in their actual form, are produced\n  through malakhim: for natural forces and malakhim are identical.  </p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>We may find a confirmation of the opinion that the natural and\n  psychological forces of an individual are called malakhim in a\n  statement of Chazal which is frequently quoted, and occurs originally\n  in Bereshit Rabba 78: \"Every day Elohim creates a legion of malakhim;\n  they sing before Him, and disappear.\" When, in opposition to this\n  statement, other statements were quoted to the effect that malakhim\n  are eternal ... the reply has been given that some live forever,\n  others perish; and this is really the case for individual forces are\n  transient, whilst the genera are eternal and imperishable. Again, we\n  read (in Bereshit Rabba 85) in reference to Yehudah and Tamar: \"R.\n  Yokhanan said that Yehudah was about to pass by [without noticing\n  Tamar], but Elohim caused the malakh of lust to present itself to\n  him.\" Human urges are here called a malakh. Likewise we frequently\n  meet with the phrase \"the malakh set over a certain thing.'' In\n  Midrash Qohelet (on Qohelet 10:7) the following passage occurs: \"When\n  a person sleeps, their nefesh speaks to the malakh, the malakh to the cherub.\"\n  The intelligent reader will find here a clear statement that human\n  imaginative faculty is also called \"malakh\" and that \"cherub\" is used\n  for human intellectual faculty.<br>\n  (<em>Proposition 26, chapter 6</em>) </p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>From the rule laid down by us that prophecy requires preparation, and\n  from our interpretation of the homonym \"malakh\" you will infer that\n  Hagar, the Egyptian woman, was not a nevit; also Manoah and his wife\n  were no neviim: the speech they heard, or imagined they heard, was\n  like the Bat Qol, which is so frequently mentioned by Chazal, and is\n  something that may be experienced by people not prepared for prophecy.\n  The homonymity of the word \"malakh\" misleads in this matter. This is\n  the principal method by which most of the difficult passages in the\n  Tanakh can be explained. Consider the words \"And Malakh HASHEM found\n  her by the well of water\" (Bereshit 16:7), which are similar to the\n  words referring to Yosef, \"And a man found him, and he was erring in\n  the field\" (37:15). All the Midrashim assume that \"man\" in this\n  passage means a malakh.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<em>Id., chapter 42</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Compare it to a Shaliach of a king, when ever a king would send one out to give a message to the people they would say: the king has spoken. Or when his troops would go out to war: The king has conquered.

Note that each time she refuses to listen, the mal'ach speaks a new message as if he is going back to Hashem and getting a new respose to her refusal. When she finally does acknowledge the message, she attributes it to the original Sender of the message.</p>\n\n\n",

Now, since it's very hot here where I live , I prefer to be more comfortable in the house, rather than dress modest like when I go out. I know that G-d has no limit, and He made me, and He can see right through me. Yet I'm still a bit confused about whether it's appropriate or no to talk to Him when I'm not so modest in the house. Is it allowed, as long as I strengthen my connection no matter what? Or is it disrespectful since we even need to cover our head to pray? Because even though I might be bored washing the dishes, and decide in the mean time I can say a few words with Him while I'm doing, it's still praying in a way, no?

But nothing else \"needs\" to be kashered, or even covered since:</p>\n\n<p>1) it's not being used in the cooking process</p>\n\n<p>2) the temperature of its involvement is diminished to the point it can't absorb, or it can't transfer what it has absorbed back into any of your vessels</p>\n\n<p>So there aren't any degrees of separation to worry about, one only needs to kasher the item directly involved with cooking food.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://kashrut.org/halacha/?law=kashering\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://kashrut.org/halacha/?law=kashering</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I found a relevant comment <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/kosher_articles/Kashering_in_the_Kitchen.php#Flatware\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some have the custom to kasher in a dedicated “kashering pot” which is\n  not used for anything else, but most kasher in any pot which is clean\n  and has not been used for 24 hours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems, therefore, that there is not a legal stringency to keep items used in the kashering process kosher. This would answer the \"hot rocks\" part of my question above, and goes partway toward answering the general question of \"degrees of separation.\" </p>\n\n<p>Generally, I will add that last time I kashered my kitchen I asked the rabbi about my dining room table, and he said I didn't have to worry about it. He was aware it would be used uncovered. He certainly didn't mention the kashrus of placemats, trivets, or vases. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, I am assuming the sink/dishwasher/sponges only need to be kashered because of the hot and wet conditions and, possibly, the potential for contact with davar charifs etc. This raises the question of why a dishwasher would need to be kashered, but not the items used for koshering, which I can't answer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One --at least as far as bosor b'cholov is concerned. <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/this_week/insights_into_halacha/5216\" rel=\"nofollow\">This page</a> answers the question in its own terms:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] [The mixture] is 100% permissible to eat, for there was no\n  direct contact between the meat and the cheese, only a weak secondary\n  contact.

    "content": "# Why \"lest another man take her\" and not betroth?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://chabad.org/9984\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deuteronomy 20:5–7 (with the Judaica Press translation)</a>, describing the lead-up to a battle:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is there who has built a new house and has not [yet] inaugurated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war, and another man inaugurate it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The soldier may die without finishing the job, and someone else will do so, inaugurating the house that's already built.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And what man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not [yet] redeemed it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war, and another man redeem it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The soldier may die without finishing the job, and someone else will do so, redeeming the vineyard that's already planted.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And what man is there who has betrothed a woman and has not [yet] taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war, and another man take her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The soldier may die without finishing the job, and someone else will do so, taking the woman that's already betrothed. Wait, no.</p>\n\n<p>Why does that last verse say \"another man take her\" as if that's all the other man needs to do? He has to betroth her also; why does the verse elide that part?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I suggest as follows: In most such cases, the soldier will die childless and with a brother, so his betrothed will be subject to <em>yibum</em> (which is true even from a betrothal, e.g. <em>Rambam</em>, <em>Yibum</em> 1:1) and indeed only \"taking\" and no betrothal will be necessary (ibid.).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Someone in my synagogue suggested as follows: The Torah is here speaking to the soldier's psychology. His fear is that he will die with unfinished business and that another fellow will finish the business, getting what he should have gotten. Granted, the other fellow will need to betroth first; but that's irrelevant to the soldier, who doesn't care about something another fellow gets unless it's what he should have gotten himself, and that's only the \"taking\", not the betrothal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First off, this depends on which approach to Torah commentary one adopts. It seems that much of these sorts of questions are clustered in the last few centuries and onward. It seems that earlier commentaries didn't make so much of different synonyms used, and the like.</p>\n\n<p>If, however, one assumes the question to be valid, one could answer based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abravanel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Abarbanel</a>'s commentary thereon. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואיש אחר יקחנה שתתקיי' המצוה ע\"י זולתו ולא על ידו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, his fear is not merely over the loss of love, but over the loss of the mitzvah. Accordingly, the focus on the final stage of marriage is natural, since betrothal may not be a mitzvah in and of itself (as per the opinion of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_ben_Jehiel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosh</a> in Kesubbos (1:12)  see <a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/vbm/english/archive/halak68/20halak.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> analysis of the Rishonim's views by  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharon_Lichtenstein\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Aharon Lichtenstein</a>  z\"l). even if the first stage (betrothal) constitutes a mitzva, the latter results in the ongoing mitzva of having children. Thus, if it is mitzvos for which he yearns, the <em>nissuin</em> (final stage of marriage) is more significant.</p>\n\n\n",

The commentaries state that each malach actually is created for \"its\" particular task and when that task is over, the malach no longer exists (Mesechet Baba Metziah 86b). We also see in discussions about people compared to malachim, that people can change status based on the mitzvos or aveiros that they do. Malachim, on the other hand, are created at a particular level and never change. Thus, Gavriel and Michoel, just like the other malachim, were created for their particular task and would never change.</p>\n\n\n",

This practice is based on what\nwe learned (Crisus 6b) Rabbi Shimon Chisda said: any fast day on which\nsinners in the community are not asked to participate is deemed to not\nbe a fast day. This rule is based on the fact that the odor of\ngalbanum is unpleasant and yet it was included among the spices for\nthe incense (Kitores) used in the Beis Ha’Mikdash. Abaye said: ‘We\nlearn this rule from the verse (Amos 9, 6): And has founded His vault upon the Earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, this paragraph answers your main question that sinners must be included in every fast day, not just Yom Kippur.</p>\n<p>The Hebrew term used in the phrase you cited is עבריינים \"ah-var-yah-nim\" which is not the usual word used for sinners which would be חוטאים (though, it does translate as that). So, it seems that these were a special class of sinners.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The עבריינים are those individuals who were excommunicated from the\nJewish community because they violated rules established by the\ncommunity. Many hold the misconception that the עבריינים are the\nMarranos- Jews who chose conversion over death during the Spanish\nInquisition. That the Mordechai, a student of the Maharam\nM’Rottenberg, and who lived in the 1200’s, refers to the custom\nprovides evidence that the practice originated in Ashkenaz well before\nthe Spanish Inquisition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Read the rest of the article, as it delves into more detail of how excommunication worked, then, and how this phrase as well as the <em>Kol Nidre</em> paragraph includes the concept of <em>charamim</em> and similar vows, and how this entire intro. paragraph developed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Actually, there are types of people placed in חרם, or excommunication for certain crimes, such as not listening to the orders of a בית דין, or Jewish court. This excommunication prohibits almost every type of social interaction, including praying together. However, as Yom Kippur is the day of atonement and retuning to G-d, a special exemption is made for these excommunicated people to return to the synagogue, in hopes that this would inspire them to change their ways. </p>\n\n\n",

The Jews are atoning for the sins of other people, but I have been led to believe that <a href=\"http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org/explanation1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">one of Judaism's complaints about Christianity is the Christian concept of vicarious atonement</a>.  Here, it seems that the non-observant Jews and non-Jews are being forgiven for their sins despite not doing anything to earn forgiveness.  I'm being forgiven without expressing remorse, or asking for forgiveness.  Someone else is doing all the work, but I'm still getting the reward.

One Hebrew word that keeps getting used there is \"העלם\". Briefly, an action is said to be in a העלם if the actor forgot something significant (one of the aforementioned facts), and the העלם isn't over until the actor realizes his error. Thus, the <em>g'mara</em> discusses whether things occur \"in one העלם or in two\", etc.</p>\n\n<p>In reading and attempting to translate the <em>g'mara</em>, I find myself stymied by this word.

The use of fish gelatin with meat foods poses an interesting question. As we have mentioned the Shulchan Aruch (Yore Deah:116) prohibits cooking meat and fish together because of health concerns. When dealing with possible health concerns we are more stringent than with possible Issur (prohibited substances). For this reason there is a question among the commentaries if the nullification in sixty rule applies to unhealthy substances as it does with prohibited substances. The custom is that one can nullify unhealthy substances in sixty (see Nekudas Hakesef, Yoreh Deah:116 & Pische' Tshuvah).</p>\n<p>Today there are many reasons for leniency in the use of fish gelatin\ntogether with meat. Many rabbinic authorities are of the opinion that\nthe nature of some foods have changed, making the mixture of meat and\nfish no longer unhealthy (see Magen Avrohom Orach Chaim 173:1, Tshuvos\nChasm Sofer vol:1 #101) In addition there is reason to say that not\nall fish are dangerous with meat. It may be that only the type\nmentioned in the Gemora (Binita) is unhealthy (see Pische' Tshuvah,\nYoreh Deah 116:3). There is also good reason to say that the unhealthy\naspects of fish cooked with meat are found in the flesh of the fish,\nnot in their skin and bone (from which gelatin is made). Gelatin does\nnot have fish flavor. As such it may not harbor the harmful effects\nthat fish carry (see Pische Tshuva ,Tshuvos Sride Eish vol:2 #67 re.\ncooking beef in fish oil). With this same reasoning we can say that\ngelatin can be batel (nullified) with a majority of other food\ningredients and can be mixed with meat. (As stated according to R'\nAharon Kotler, zt\"l regarding animal gelatin & milk) As a result of\nthese reasons it is acceptable to use fish gelatin with meat. We may\nuse much the same reasoning in the reverse case, to allow animal\ngelatin with fish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that the language here is based in \"leniency\" and \"it is acceptable\" so this is not an unequivocal endorsement.

    "content": "# Intentions of chesed\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When doing a mitzvah which is an act of kindness such as charity or helping someone, what is the proper intention? </p>\n\n<p>To focus on the recipient? Or perhaps I should be thinking  I am doing a command of Hashem, and the act and the recipient are inconsequential artifacts. So just as I shake a Lulav when Hashem says to, I also give money to person Hashem says to. Or perhaps there is some type of combination intention? </p>\n\n<p>I would prefer sourced answers, but definitive arguments are acceptable as well.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of the issues at hand that have me wondering:</p>\n\n<p>I feel the Yerushalmi in Pe'ah 1 1 that says 'just as He is a rachum and chanun, so too you should be a rachum and chanun' compounds the issue more than solves it, because as it turns out, when I am not being a rachum, I am acting out of concern for Hashem's commandment, but once I reach a level of being that rachum, my sole concern is the recipient. So now the epitome of observance is the fact that I am completely  ignoring the fact that the act I am doing is Hashem's command, being that I am focused solely on the recipient. This seems odd to me, but please feel free to explain these words, or others in a different light.</p>\n\n<p>And before answering 'it's both!', let me point out why I think it is not. Part of the issue here is an old question I've had. Did Avraham Avinu do chessed with passers by before he recognized Hashem? Or was it a practice he began afterwards when he realized what a good ploy it was to get people to actively bless Hashem? Think about this, when he confronted them and said 'either bless Hashem, or pay for the food' what would happen to his reward for his chessed if they paid up? Seems like he didn't care as much about the niceness  aspect as he did about the religious experience. And while the chessed he did can be described as having brought people under the wings of Hashem, and nothing to do with the food etc, that still leaves me wondering what is the underlying thought process for our chessed that we are supposed to do.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>from chovos halevavos shaar bitachon ch.4</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the one who trusts in G-d has a wife, relatives, friends, enemies,\n  let him trust in G-d to be saved from them.</p>\n  \n  <p>He should strive to fulfill his duties to them, to do their wishes, to\n  be wholehearted with them.

Do not do this out of\n  hope for future benefits from them or to pay them back for past\n  benefits.

    "content": "# How do you pay a debt (not a loan) in a different currency?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shimon, in Eretz Yisrael, makes a purchase on behalf of Reuven, in the diaspora.  For Reuven the cost of paying in shekels would be quite high, but Shimon can receive the payment in another currency and pay a much smaller fee to convert the money to shekels.  They therefore agree that, to minimize the total cost, Reuven will pay the amount due plus an amount that covers Shimon's cost to convert the money once he receives it.  Naturally, both of them want to avoid any problems with <em>ribbit</em> while ensuring that Shimon isn't underpaid.  This is not a loan; Shimon is acting as an agent for Reuven to make a purchase that Reuven cannot make directly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>First question:</strong> If one of the parties ends up profiting from the transaction because of currency fluctuations, is there a concern about <em>ribbit</em>?  Or is <em>ribbit</em> only about <em>loans</em>, not cases where you ask somebody else to make a purchase for you?  This might be different because the point of a loan is for the borrower to make use of the money, while here that's more of a side-effect.</p>\n\n<p>If agency is the same as lending with respect to this, then would the answers to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9217/759\">this question</a> apply to the currency-conversion aspect of the repayment?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second question:</strong> If agency is <em>not</em> the same as a loan, does <em>halacha</em> have anything to say on how they should decide what currency-conversion rate to use?  The rate on the day of the purchase?  On the day the funds are sent?  The average rate over some recent period of time?  Something else?</p>\n\n<p>(I am not asking for a practical ruling, but rather for the <em>halachot</em> that would inform the decision.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You can avoid this whole problem simply. Shimon can purchase the item on his own, with the understanding that Reuvein will then buy it from Shimon. A resale, unlike a reimbursement, steers clear of all Ribbit issues, and Shimon may charge any reasonable price.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: for this to work, Reuven must be under no obligation to buy the item. However, in typical cases Reuven wants the item so it’s irrelevant unless the item is lost/ damaged, etc. )</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Sacks’ translation brings readers closer than ever before\n  to the authentic meaning of the Hebrew text, while his introduction\n  and commentary provide new ways of understanding and experiencing the\n  Yom Kippur service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The nusach is related to the Routledge nusach and has \nזכרנו לַחַיִים (with a patach under the lamed) instead of the more usual זכרנו לְחַיִים (with a sheva - and <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01355_part_28.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to the Tur and the Maharam Rothenberg</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The Artscroll machzorim can be found <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Items.aspx?hierId=LSE&rewrite=165&o=Lowest\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> .</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is a complete Western Ashkenazi siddur available for free online at the opensiddur site: the <a href=\"http://opensiddur.org/siddurim/ashkenaz/siddur-bnei-ashkenaz-a-german-rite-siddur-prepared-by-r-rallis-wiesenthal/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Tefiloh Sefas Yisroel</em>, nusach of the now gone kehilla of Bad Homburg</a>, a city <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Homburg_vor_der_H%C3%B6he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">near Frankfurt, Germany</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It was collated by Rav Rallis Wiesenthal based on pre-Haskalah manuscripts, with the assistance of Machon Moreshes Ashkenaz and Kehal Adas Yeshurun-Jerusalem.

This is in regards to <em>bnei Noach</em> and not <em>goyim</em>(Hilchot Melachim 10:10). Rambam states that <em>bnei Noach</em> can do any of the mitzvot as long as they do it properly(Hilchot Melachim 10:10). <em>Goyim</em>, which are idol-worshipping non-Jews(Hilchot Machalot Assurot 11:8), should not be doing anything but being involved in the seven laws of the children of Noah(Hilchot Melachim 10:9). A person should be pure before engaging in holiness.</p>\n\n<p>It's my personal opinion that the Raadbaz was choichech(he deliberated) on the matter because there are two main types of <em>bnei Noach</em>. <em>Bnei Noach</em> that do things for their own sake and <em>bnei Noach</em> that do things for the sake of Torah(Hilchot Melachim 8:10-12). These days, because the Yovel year is not practiced a Jewish beit din cannot bring the fear to the <em>ben Noach</em> to properly determine his kavanah(intention). Such a <em>ben Noach</em> accepted would be a ger toshav and then part of klal Yisrael. The other type of <em>ben Noach</em> would most likely not come before the beit din. This is why I think the Raadbaz was being stringent.</p>\n\n<p>All <em>goyim</em> by default, are idol-worshippers until said otherwise(Gittin 45b, Hullin 13a, Hilchot Maachalot Assurot 11:8, R\"ITVA on Makos 9a, Chasam Sofer on Sanhedrin). However, that does not mean they're always idol-worshippers. They could explicitly state themselves as not idol-worshippers. Once they do that, they come out of the geder/category of <em>goy</em> and into <em>ben Noach</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The list is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Keeping Shabbes like we do</li>\n<li>Keeping Yamim Tovim like we do</li>\n<li>Torahstudy what does not concern the Sheva Mitzvot </li>\n<li>Receiving aliyah/laynen Torah in shul</li>\n<li>putting, writing and wearing tefillin</li>\n<li>write a Sefer Torah</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Parashat Tzav has 97 pesukim as per main sources as well.  </p>\n\n<p>For those who question why this is important; it is the result of something I heard that the G'ra wrote in Sifrei D'tzniusa that pesukim of the Torah correlate to the Jewish years.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside note, I have found in my research that the cute gematria words used to remember the amount of pesukim has it source from a non-Jewish person, although numbering of verses were first utilized in Hebrew by Rabbi Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus, who begun in 1438 and finished in 1448, his Hebrew Biblical Concordance  called, \"Meir Nativ.\"  The Meir Nativ, with its complete introduction, was first published in Venice on the 26th of Tishrei, 5284 (October 15, 1523) and printed by Daniel Bomberg, a Christian printer, born in Antwerp. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Gemara Kiddushin 30a says that there are 5,888 verses in the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding discrepancies and other issues you raised, see the following article which discusses in length and detail: <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%207%20EpsteinGreenberger.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%207%20EpsteinGreenberger.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I have an article explaining this at <a href=\"https://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2016/01/count-of-pesukim-in-each-parsha.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Count of Pesukim in each Parsha</a></p>\n<p>The counts were taken from the Art Scroll Chumash notes at the end of each parsha. Note that while the masoretic count of Tzav is 96, A physical count of Pesukim shows 97.</p>\n<p>An interesting point is that one could say that</p>\n<p>The Masoretic note at the end of the parashah is \"Tzav Siman\" without the number of verses. The Masoretes specifically omitted the number of verses, because from the first word Tzav on the 2nd pasuk it is 96 verses exactly. Luckily that precise note was kept.</p>\n<p>Pekudei does not have a note at the end of the parsha but the Art Scroll commentary says the edition of the Chumash printed with the Malbim's commentary.gives it as 92 (which matches the physical count in the chumash)</p>\n<p>However we find that  R Menachem Mendel Schneerson z\"l (1902-1994; the Lubavitcher Rebbe) was once asked why, and he responded as follows:</p>\n<p>It is necessary to check older prints of the chumash, for in my opinion, this originates from a printers omission, which was later copied by other printers. Perhaps the original siman consisted of the phrase bli kol / without any [see Devarim 28:55], which has a gematria of 92. Perhaps a young printers apprentice saw the phrase bli kol siman / without any siman and misunderstood its meaning, so that Parashat Pekudei was, in fact, left without any siman. (Quoted in Otzrot Tzaddikei Ugeonei Hadorot)</p>\n<p>Yisro appears to use the taamei elyon count (10 pesukim) instead of the taamei tachton count (13 pesukim) for the total given at the comment at the end. This is based on comparing the note to the physical count as printed in the Chumash.</p>\n<p>The mesorah note for Vayeilech of 70 appears for the combined parshiyos of Nitzavim and Vayeilech. This means 40 in Nitzavim and 30 in Vayeilech</p>\n<p>The Art Scroll (Stone Edition) Mesorah note for Bo says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ק\"ה פסוקים. ימנ\"ה סימן: This Masoretic note means: There are 105\nverses in the <em>Sidrah</em>, numerically corresponding to the mnemonic\nיִמְנֶה <em>he will count</em>.</p>\n<p>This alludes to the law that each person must count himself as part of\na group that brings the <em>pesach</em>-offerings (<em>R' David Feinstein</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@DoubleAA points out that the classical simanim are the names of people in Tanach so it would be the son of אשר.</p>\n<p>It is possible that <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9874#v=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bo 13:1</a> is treated by the mesorah count as part of 13:2 as shown by the trop.

It feels akin to inviting further transgression by not reacting as I conventionally would.</p>\n\n<p>Where does non-judgment end and the intelligent defense of oneself begin?</p>\n\n<p>Hypothetically, let's say an individual transgresses against me (slander, infidelity, violence et al.). Is the realistic expectation of further transgressions from an individual that has historically and consistently transgressed against me not a form of judgment? Are my attempts to neutralise the negative effects of the transgressor not predispositionally judgement based?</p>\n\n<p>It feels unnatural and counter intuitive to suppress my anger towards my transgressors.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I don't know or care about the Kabbala or red string business. I will also add that Jews absolutely do honorably serve on jury duty in the United States, and believe that because all humans are expected to have systems of justice, it is absolutely allowed -- and required -- to apply whatever judgement (e.g. beyond reasonable doubt) is necessary for that system of justice. </p>\n\n<p>We do have a law called \"judge your fellow righteously\", as pertains to non-governmental settings. (E.g. how do you react when you see your friend doing something that looks wrong?)  Let's talk about that.</p>\n\n<p>The work <em>Chafetz Chaim</em> (about a hundred years ago, focused on ethical speech) says that for a righteous person, you should judge their actions as favorable unless it's incredibly, incredibly implausible to do so. (You saw him eating a cheeseburger? Is it possible he had an ulcer, low blood sugar, or other medical condition?)</p>\n\n<p>For an average person, you apply a moderate degree of favor when judging. (\"Maybe he was having a rotten day.\") And for someone presumed wicked, you're not expected to make any effort to judge favorably.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly -- and this is super important -- I am allowed and expected to take defensive action in a wide variety of circumstances. If I hear there's a history of cash suddenly disappearing around Joe, I can mentally say \"I don't know if the rumors are true or what to make of them\", but at the same time I can totally lock up my valuables when he's visiting! </p>\n\n<p>At the end of II Kings we are told that the Jewish viceroy over Israel, Gedaliah, heard a rumor of palace plot to assassinate him, which he promptly ignored. \"I don't listen to slander! I judge everyone favorably!\" He was in the wrong (and paid for it with his life). He could have said \"I don't know what to make of the rumors, but I will hire some extra bodyguards just in case.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do the actions of animals have moral value?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I vaguely remember reading in the Torah some laws regarding the proper restitution when one person's livestock injures or kills someone else's livestock, but as far as I can recall, it was more related to what we might call property damage, as opposed to the animal having done something morally wrong.  </p>\n\n<p>Does Jewish law and/or scripture suggest that the actions of animals have moral significance?  Can animals be evil/sinful or good/righteous?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Babylonian Talmud (<a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=3825\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sanhedrin</em> 108 <em>amud</em> 1</a>) says pretty much explicitly that animals cannot sin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וימח את כל היקום אשר על פני האדמה אם אדם חטא בהמה מה חטאה תנא משום רבי יהושע בן קרחה משל לאדם שעשה חופה לבנו והתקין מכל מיני סעודה לימים מת בנו עמד ופזר את חופתו אמר כלום עשיתי אלא בשביל בני עכשיו שמת חופה למה לי אף הקב״ה אמר כלום בראתי בהמה וחיה אלא בשביל אדם עכשיו שאדם חוטא בהמה וחיה למה לי</p>\n<p>\"He wiped away all the beings that were on the face of the earth\" [in the deluge: Genesis 7:23]. If people sinned, did animals sin? One taught in the name of R. <em>Y'hoshua</em> b. <em>Korcha</em>: An analogy to a man who made a chuppah for his son and prepared [quantities] of all varieties [suitable] for a meal. After some days, his son died. He stood up and scattered his chuppah: he said, \"Did I do anything, except for the benefit of my son? Now that he is dead, what do I need a chuppah for?\" So the holy One, blessed is He, said, \"Did I create domestic and wild animals, except for the benefit of man? Now that man is sinning, what do I need domestic and wild animals for?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question \"did animals sin?\" implies that they cannot sin. And it was not countered: the animals were destroyed for the reason described, not for their sins.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>to add a bit to msh210's answer as to why animals don't sin, here's a quote from the Duties of the Heart part 2 (one of the classic works on jewish philosophy)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is through the understanding that we realize the Creator's wisdom,\n  power and mercy, of which the universe provides clear evidence. It is\n  the understanding which shows us that we ought to serve Him, because\n  service is rightly due to Him, and because of His beneficence,\n  bestowed upon all universally and on each one specifically. Through\n  the understanding we are confirmed in our faith in the truth of the\n  Book of G-d's Law given to Moses, His prophet, peace be upon him.\n  Because of a human being's faculty of reason and perception, he is an\n  accountable creature whom his Creator will hold to a strict reckoning.\n  A person who has lost his understanding, loses all the excellencies of\n  a human being and is exempt from the mitzvot (precepts), and reward\n  and punishment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>i.e. one without proper understanding is not held accountable for his actions</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There are inferences in scripture that can be interpreted that actions of animals have moral value. And even when scripture speaks of their actions not having moral value, it puts them on the same level as humans who don't have moral value.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Genesis 6 11 And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was\n  filled with violence. יב  וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים אֶת-הָאָרֶץ, וְהִנֵּה\n  נִשְׁחָתָה:  כִּי-הִשְׁחִית כָּל-בָּשָׂר אֶת-דַּרְכּוֹ, עַל-הָאָרֶץ. \n  {ס}   12 And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all\n  flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth. {S} יג  וַיֹּאמֶר\n  אֱלֹהִים לְנֹחַ, קֵץ כָּל-בָּשָׂר בָּא לְפָנַי--כִּי-מָלְאָה הָאָרֶץ\n  חָמָס, מִפְּנֵיהֶם; וְהִנְנִי מַשְׁחִיתָם, אֶת-הָאָרֶץ.   13 And God\n  said unto Noah: 'The end of all flesh is come before Me; for the earth\n  is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them\n  with the earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"All flesh had become corrupted.\" Since Hashem had already a few verses earlier talked about the evils of mankind, Rashi says that the rest that are included with \"all flesh\" must be the animal kingdom.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>for all flesh had corrupted: Even cattle, beasts, and fowl would mate with those who were not of their own species. — [from Tan. Noach 12]        כי השחית כל בשר: אפילו בהמה חיה ועוף נזקקין לשאינן מינן:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For those that would say that this means that animals became corrupted without doing evil, we need to define what evil is, or more clearly, what sinning is. According to Hovoth Halevavoth (as well as others) one that understands cannot sin, nor can they perform a miswah</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hovoth haLevavoth Part 2</p>\n  \n  <p>A person who has lost his understanding,\n  loses all the excellencies of a human being and is exempt from the\n  mitzvot (precepts), and reward and punishment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you tell me that regardless of this, Rashi doesn't hold this opinion, and that what Rashi is saying is that the animals became corrupt without knowing what they were doing, i tell you that indeed Rashi is claiming that it was because of this morally wrong behavior they were punished, just as the fruit trees were</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Genesis 1:11 with Rashi </p>\n  \n  <p>11And God said, \"Let the earth sprout\n  vegetation, seed yielding herbs and fruit trees producing fruit\n  according to its kind in which its seed is found, on the earth,\" and\n  it was so.</p>\n  \n  <p>fruit trees: That the taste of the tree should be like the taste of\n  the fruit. It [the earth] did not do so, however, but“the earth gave\n  forth, etc., trees producing fruit,” but the trees themselves were not\n  fruit. Therefore, when man was cursed because of his iniquity, it [the\n  earth] too was punished for its iniquity (and was cursed-not in all\n  editions). - [from Gen. Rabbah 5:9]       עץ פרי: שיהא טעם העץ כטעם\n  הפרי, והיא לא עשתה כן, אלא (פסוק יב) ותוצא הארץ עץ עושה פרי, ולא העץ\n  פרי, לפיכך כשנתקלל אדם על עונו נפקדה גם היא על עונה ונתקללה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If a tree can have iniquity, as a man can have iniquity, then even the moreso an animal! \nThis explains why God felt justified in killing the animals in the flood as well, otherwise you have a God that punishes the innocent of the world. We always say that Noah was saved because he was the most righteous man, i think it's also fair to say that the animals were the saved were also the most righteous of their generation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Numbers 22: כח  וַיִּפְתַּח יְהוָה, אֶת-פִּי הָאָתוֹן; וַתֹּאמֶר\n  לְבִלְעָם, מֶה-עָשִׂיתִי לְךָ, כִּי הִכִּיתַנִי, זֶה שָׁלֹשׁ רְגָלִים.\n    28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto\n  Balaam: 'What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these\n  three times?' כט  וַיֹּאמֶר בִּלְעָם לָאָתוֹן, כִּי הִתְעַלַּלְתְּ\n  בִּי; לוּ יֶשׁ-חֶרֶב בְּיָדִי, כִּי עַתָּה הֲרַגְתִּיךְ.  29 And\n  Balaam said unto the ass: 'Because thou hast mocked me; I would there\n  were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.' ל  וַתֹּאמֶר\n  הָאָתוֹן אֶל-בִּלְעָם, הֲלוֹא אָנֹכִי אֲתֹנְךָ אֲשֶׁר-רָכַבְתָּ עָלַי\n  מֵעוֹדְךָ עַד-הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה--הַהַסְכֵּן הִסְכַּנְתִּי, לַעֲשׂוֹת לְךָ\n  כֹּה; וַיֹּאמֶר, לֹא.     30 And the ass said unto Balaam: 'Am not I\n  thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this\n  day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee?' And he said: 'Nay.' לא \n  וַיְגַל יְהוָה, אֶת-עֵינֵי בִלְעָם, וַיַּרְא אֶת-מַלְאַךְ יְהוָה\n  נִצָּב בַּדֶּרֶךְ, וְחַרְבּוֹ שְׁלֻפָה בְּיָדוֹ; וַיִּקֹּד\n  וַיִּשְׁתַּחוּ, לְאַפָּיו.    31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of\n  Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his\n  sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.\n  לב  וַיֹּאמֶר אֵלָיו, מַלְאַךְ יְהוָה, עַל-מָה הִכִּיתָ אֶת-אֲתֹנְךָ,\n  זֶה שָׁלוֹשׁ רְגָלִים; הִנֵּה אָנֹכִי יָצָאתִי לְשָׂטָן, כִּי-יָרַט\n  הַדֶּרֶךְ לְנֶגְדִּי.     32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him:\n  'Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am\n  come forth for an adversary, because thy way is contrary unto me;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bilam is on his way to curse the children of Israel. It says that God opened up the mouth of the donkey, not that God blessed it with divine intelligence, it implies that God simply allowed the donkey to speak its own thoughts. We can argue all day if this is metaphorical or not. But either way, when the Angel finally reveals itself, its first priority is to bring up how the donkey was abused, rather than to talk to Bilaam about the whole cursing Israel thing.</p>\n\n<p>For those who ask how is this moral? The donkey sees the angel while his master does not, and the donkey knows that if he approaches the angel his master would die, but if he goes against his masters wishes the master will beat him. But the donkey struggled with what he should do, and decided to heed the angel of God, rather than his master. He did the moral thing, which is why he is innocent of his masters beating, and also why the angel takes up his cause, for the donkey made the correct moral judgment.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yonah Chapter 4 י  וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה--אַתָּה חַסְתָּ עַל-הַקִּיקָיוֹן,\n  אֲשֶׁר לֹא-עָמַלְתָּ בּוֹ וְלֹא גִדַּלְתּוֹ:  שֶׁבִּן-לַיְלָה הָיָה,\n  וּבִן-לַיְלָה אָבָד.  10 And the LORD said: 'Thou hast had pity on the\n  gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow, which\n  came up in a night, and perished in a night; יא  וַאֲנִי לֹא אָחוּס,\n  עַל-נִינְוֵה הָעִיר הַגְּדוֹלָה--אֲשֶׁר יֶשׁ-בָּהּ הַרְבֵּה\n  מִשְׁתֵּים-עֶשְׂרֵה רִבּוֹ אָדָם, אֲשֶׁר לֹא-יָדַע בֵּין-יְמִינוֹ\n  לִשְׂמֹאלוֹ, וּבְהֵמָה, רַבָּה.  {ש}  11 and should not I have pity on\n  Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand\n  persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left\n  hand, <strong>and the many animals as well?</strong>'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is interesting about God's hesitancy about destroying Ninweh is that he compares the animals to the humans on the same level. And he also does this earlier, in terms of repenting.</p>\n\n<p>Jonah Chapter 3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ז  וַיַּזְעֵק, וַיֹּאמֶר בְּנִינְוֵה, מִטַּעַם הַמֶּלֶךְ וּגְדֹלָיו, לֵאמֹר:  הָאָדָם וְהַבְּהֵמָה הַבָּקָר וְהַצֹּאן, אַל-יִטְעֲמוּ מְאוּמָה--אַל-יִרְעוּ, וּמַיִם אַל-יִשְׁתּוּ.  7 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying: 'Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not feed, nor drink water;\n  ח  וְיִתְכַּסּוּ שַׂקִּים, הָאָדָם וְהַבְּהֵמָה, וְיִקְרְאוּ אֶל-אֱלֹהִים, בְּחָזְקָה; וְיָשֻׁבוּ, אִישׁ מִדַּרְכּוֹ הָרָעָה, וּמִן-הֶחָמָס, אֲשֶׁר בְּכַפֵּיהֶם.   8 but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.\n  ט  מִי-יוֹדֵעַ יָשׁוּב, וְנִחַם הָאֱלֹהִים; וְשָׁב מֵחֲרוֹן אַפּוֹ, וְלֹא נֹאבֵד.   9 Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?'\n  י  וַיַּרְא הָאֱלֹהִים אֶת-מַעֲשֵׂיהֶם, כִּי-שָׁבוּ מִדַּרְכָּם הָרָעָה; וַיִּנָּחֶם הָאֱלֹהִים, עַל-הָרָעָה אֲשֶׁר-דִּבֶּר לַעֲשׂוֹת-לָהֶם--וְלֹא עָשָׂה.  10 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which He said He would do unto them; and He did it not. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the grammar of these verses, both man and beast wear sack cloth, all cry out onto God, all repent from their evil ways, and therefore all are given forgiveness from the punishment God was planning on bringing upon them.</p>\n\n<p>For those who would say that it was only the people who repented because verse 8 says וְיָשֻׁבוּ אִישׁ מִדַּרְכּוֹ הָרָעָה i say that these are the words of the king of Ninweh! \"by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying...\" (Verse 7) God does not make a distinction between man and beast, for verse 10 says י <strong>וַיַּרְא הָאֱלֹהִים אֶת-מַעֲשֵׂיהֶם, כִּי-שָׁבוּ מִדַּרְכָּם הָרָעָה</strong>;  And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way...</p>\n\n<p>So yes, if you want to believe in the words of the king of Ninweh, the animals did not repent of their evil ways, but do not mix his words with being the words of God.</p>\n\n\n",

The language of the Ptur follows the language of the Get but might include some information in an addendum.

If however, the Ptur does not include any additional information and the rabbis signed on it were not known to be meticulous, then perhaps other rabbis would not be as likely to accept it as a first-hand document.

    "content": "# In Rambam's negative theology, why are G-d's attributes of action considered something that we can know about G-d?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Rambam's negative theology, there is a distinction between descriptions of G-d's essence (which we can only speak about in negative terms, e.g. G-d is not physical, non temporal, non ignorant, etc.),  and attributes of action. The attributes of action are \"those that do not describe G-d directly, [but] rather His interaction with creation\" (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology#In_the_Jewish_tradition\" rel=\"nofollow\">per this wiki entry</a>). Some examples of attributes of action are that G-d is merciful, that G-d is mighty, that G-d is a redeemer, etc.</p>\n\n<p>But don't the attributes of action, in fact, <b>also</b> describe G-d's essence? For example saying that G-d is mighty can be interpreted to mean that certain events caused by G-d (like the Exodus) happened in a way/fashion that we humans would ordinarily call \"mighty\", in the ordinary sense of the word. But we're then also saying that it was G-d who was \"mighty\" - i.e. those events didn't just happen by themselves, they were caused by G-d, who performed them in a mighty fashion. So then here we have an attribute of G-d's essence, namely that He is or has-the-property-of-being \"someone who performs certain events in a certain (in this case, mighty) fashion\".</p>\n\n<p>So how is this knowledge of G-d (i.e. the knowledge of certain properties of physical observable events that are attributed to His actions) really different from any other statement about G-d or His essence? According to negative theology, we can't say that G-d exists in space, for example, because G-d is utterly indescribable. And yet, we can say something specific about the way He operates and interacts with the world? If he is utterly indescribable, we should not be able to know anything at all about Him, including any knowledge/properties/restrictions/specifications of His interactions with the world!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>They are not so much something we know about G-d as behaviors we know G-d wants us to emulate. This is the thesis of Moreh Nevuchim 1:54. He then uses this to explain the 13 Attributes of Mercy that Hashem revealed to Moshe and concludes, \"We have gone too far away from the subject of this chapter, but we have shown why it has been considered sufficient to mention only these (thirteen) out of all His acts: namely, because they are required for the good government of a country; for the chief aim of man should be to make himself, as far as possible, similar to God: that is to say, to make his acts similar to the acts of God, or as our Sages expressed it in explaining the verse, \"Ye shall be holy\" (Lev. xxi. 2): \"He is gracious, so be you also gracious: He is merciful, so be you also merciful. </p>\n\n<p>\"The principal object of this chapter was to show that all attributes ascribed to God are attributes of His acts, and do not imply that God has any qualities.\"</p>\n\n<p>For authenticity, I kept Fraedlander's translation <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp064.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp064.htm</a> . For accuracy, I believe the other translators who render the quote from Chazal the way we find in Hilkhos Dei'os 1:6 <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%90</a> \"מה הוא נקרא חנון אף אתה היה חנון מה הוא נקרא רחום אף אתה היה רחום מה הוא נקרא קדוש אף אתה היה קדוש  -- Just as He is called Full of Grace, so to you should be full of grace, just as He is called Merciful, so to you should be merciful, just as He is called Holy, so to you should be called holy.\"</p>\n\n<p>G-d isn't even being described as Graceful, Merciful and Holy, He is described as being called these things. These are appearances Hashem presents us. In truth, we cannot ascribe motives to why Hashem's Will was for X and not Y.</p>\n\n<p>(I should add that there are other approaches to the question of attributes. As a quick example, R Saadia Gaon posits three classes: negative attributes, His Action's attributes, and attributes of the Creator-Created relationship. Also, there are problems with this thesis internal to the Rambam, such as integrating it with His discussion of Divine Knowledge and the unity of Knower-Knowledge-Known. But to do more than alert you to this would turn this answer into a book.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The problem of defining God is that a definition is a border that describes the object of being only from here and until there. Every definition is giving boundaries. When you \"grasp\" a concept, you surrounded it with boundaries and you know where it comes in, where it ends, what is before, and what is after. </p>\n\n<p>God is endless, and therefore indescribable. He does not have any boundaries and therefore no definition. However, He does interact with the finite, definable creation. What gets done to the creation has a description and by extension, a boundary.</p>\n\n<p>Putting these two contradictory ideas together we say that although we are seeing finite behaviors, it doesn't define God, because these are only a segment of the rest of His endless possible actions and attributes.</p>\n\n<p>This is different from when we discuss a person. If we see someone behaving a certain way we can describe his very nature by this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>God exists in a different way than we do.

As Aristotle said \"negating\n  attributes of G-d gives a truer conception of Him than affirming\n  attributes\". For all affirmative attributes ascribed to G-d must\n  necessarily ascribe properties of Etzem (essence) or Mikre (incidental\n  properties), and He who created etzem and mikre has not the properties\n  of His creatures in His glorious essence. But the denial of such\n  properties to Him is undoubtedly true and appropriate to Him. For He\n  is above all attributes and forms, similarity or comparison.\n  Therefore, you must understand from these attributes that they refer\n  to the negation of their opposites.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Marpe Lenefesh commentary: It is better to negate ascribing to the\n  Creator attributes which are lackings on Him. For example, it is more\n  correct to say that the Creator is not plural, not non-existent, not\n  created, which are opposites, and which are more true than saying and\n  affirming on Him that He is the \"true Unity\", \"permanently existing\",\n  \"eternal\", <strong>because we are not capable of understanding what is true\n  Unity</strong>,...)</p>\n  \n  <p>....Therefore, you should exert your mind until you know the Creator\n  through the evidences of His works and not strive to know Him in His\n  glorious essence. For He is exceedingly close to you from the side of\n  His deeds but infinitely remote in any representation of His essence\n  or comparison with it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I think this term first appears in the book of Esther. Otherwise, the most common term in the Torah is \"B'nei Yisra'el\", meaning \"Sons (or children) of Israel\", with Israel being the name given to Jacob. At any rate, in the Torah, the term \"Israel\" almost always refers to the nation, or what we now call \"Jews\". (FYI, in the Torah, the word \"Israel\" is never used to refer to the country itself. That name, is used after the land of Cana'an was settled.)</p>\n\n<p>The term \"Gentile\" might be equivalent to the term \"Goy\" which is a generic term used to mean \"nation\" or \"people\" and that term is sometimes used for the nation of Israel, itself. It depends on its context. Usually, the Torah would refer to a nation of non-Jews by their specific national name such as Cananites, Hittites, Anakim, etc.</p>\n\n<p>regardless, when the Torah refers to \"Gentiles\" or those that are non-Jews, it is closer to the 2nd idea - they were not born Jewish, as describe in my point, above. A Jew who does not practice his religion, and sadly, AFAIK, that's the majority in the world, currently, is still considered Jewish. Once you are Jewish you cannot \"convert\" out of it. Even a non-Jew that converted properly (there are \"improper\" conversions. Delve through this site for details on this notion) and became Jewish, remains Jewish for life.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Idolatry in Mitzrayim?",
    "content": "# Idolatry in Mitzrayim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Within Ezekiel 20 there are a few verses that talk about idolatry and refer to Mitzrayim. That made me wonder if the Israelites in Egypt forgot the G-d of their parents or exchanged Him for the gods of Egypt? Because in the parashat of shemot the names of all that came into Egypt (and were raised in a home were HaShem was known) and the way HaShem tells Moshe what to say if the people ask for His name seems so important... like they needed to hear these things in order to turn and follows Moshe. Besides that the people that went with Moshe seem to go back to these idols (like the golden cow incident) every time that they can't see or feel HaShem or are in a troublesome/difficult/harsh situation. </p>\n\n<p>Did the hardness in Mitzrayim cause them to los faith and within time made them turn to idolatry of any kind? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra on the Pasuk writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וימת מלך מצרים. עתה יוכל משה לשוב אל מצרים. וישראל עשו תשובה. כי יחזקאל הזכיר שהיו ישראל עובדים גלולי מצרים. על כן ענם השם ותחת אשר לא עבדוהו עבדו אכזרים</p>\n<p>And the king of Egypt died- Now Moshe could return to Egypt. And Israel had done repentance. For Yechezkel mentioned* that Bnai Yisrael were worshipers of the egyptian idols. Therefore Hashem punished them, and because they hadn't worshiped Him, they worshiped cruel ones (i.e. they served the Egyptians).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>*<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.20.7?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.20.7?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all</a></p>\n<p>Thus, your reading of Yechezkel 20 is supported by the Ibn Ezra, and I can't think of any other way to interpret the pesukim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Shir HaShirim Rabba (4:7 ) cites an opinion that only the tribes of Reuben, Simeon and Levi avoided idolatry while in Egypt. Apparently, all the rest indulged in it at some point which is why the prophet Ezekiel (chapter 20) notes the requirement to eliminate the idols before redemption could occur. (Yaakov/Jacob does something similar in Gen. 35:2, and in Joshua (chap 24) he does the same.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Idol worship is not like atheism which is incompatible with believing in God. Idol worship is the idea that by worshipping a specific power you will get the benefits of that power.</p>\n\n<p>The ideology of an idol worshipper is very different from what Hashem wants. We worship Hashem because He told us to, not as a means of gaining something -- although we are aware of reward.</p>\n\n<p>In Beshalach we find that when the Jews asked for water they were checking אם יש ה' בקרבנו אם אין, if God <em>is</em> with us or <em>isn't</em>. The Zohar wonders how those who crossed the sea would still question if God is with them. Therefore, explains the Zohar, they were asking which aspect of God is with them, the revealed presence or a high hidden presence, called אין.</p>\n\n<p>This too was a wrong question to ask. It seems that this kind of pondering is born from the pluralistic ideology in which idol worship abounds. The same can apply to them asking which name revealed itself. Although Hashem has many and many attributes, He is one. This is why, after answering the question with the literal answer of the name א--ה, Moshe was told to open by using the name י-ה, the name of oneness. </p>\n\n<p>The Ramban, and basically all Rishonim, explain the golden calf as also a wrong ideology but not as dropping belief in God, ח\"ו.</p>\n\n\n",

Here's a quote from his teachings on the matter:</p>\n\n<p>Everybody wants to revere God's Name but not everyone is able to repent. Sometimes a person feels no arousal whatever. Even one who is aroused to repent may not reach his unique gate of Teshuvah, and even if he does, it could be that the gate is closed.

The Psalms can take him to his unique gate and open it up, thereby bringing him to Teshuvah.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason King David called himself \"the man who raised the yoke... the sweet singer of Israel \" ( II Samuel 23:1) . Our sages explain that David called himself \"the man who raised the yoke\" because he elevated the yoke of repentance through his own Teshuvah. David was a great Tzaddik and should not have sinned, but God caused him to sin in order to teach everyone the way of Teshuvah. King David was the prime exemplar of Teshuvah and his pathway is set forth in the Psalms, which he wrote with such a spirit of holiness that everyone can find himself in them and thereby return to God.</p>\n\n<p>Likutey Moharan II, 73   </p>\n\n\n",

Some say it is a prohibition of <em>shochet</em> - slaughtering. Others say this is a prohibition of <em>dosh</em> b/c blood is \"extracted\" from blood vessels and capillaries.</p>\n\n<p>The article does specifically mention giving a blood test on Shabbat, which is \"more sever\" than donating blood to someone else. Even that is prohibited unless this is a case of <em>pikuach nefesh</em> (which I shall define, later).</p>\n\n<p>You mentioned Rosh Hashanah, which is not Shabbat but a Yom Tov. The only <em>melcahot</em> permitted on Yom Tov are those needed for food-related preparation such as slaughtering an animal that you intend to eat on Yom Tov, itself. Donating blood is not related to eating, so it would be prohibited on Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>2 - <em>Pikuach Nefesh</em> has a definition that applies to saving a specific life of someone who's life is in imminent danger. This implies two things - A) It is the life of a specific person (i.e. - not a random person whom you don't know about, and b) if you don't immediately act, that person may die. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding a blood donation, you don't know about anyone whose life is in imminent danger NOW. This is a remote possibility. See <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2012/10/12/pikuach-nefesh-on-shabbos/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a> near the middle regarding administering a smallpox vaccination (which could be more severe than a blood donation.) Citing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach zt”l discusses the situation where a\n  particular illness is theoretically life-threatening, but the chances\n  of it being so are relatively slim. Does this also warrant chillul\n  Shabbos?</p>\n  \n  <p>He maintains that if most people would act immediately due to the\n  urgency of the matter, then this is a case of safek pikuach nefesh and\n  chillul Shabbos is required. However, <strong>if most people are unconcern\n  about such an illness, chillul Shabbos is not allowed as there is no\n  sakanah.</strong> The example that he gives is the smallpox vaccination.\n  Although technically speaking, once the doctor says that the child\n  needs the vaccination, one should administer it as soon as possible,\n  nevertheless, since most people did not do so, as the need is not\n  urgent, one is not allowed to transgress the Shabbos for it (Shu”t\n  Minchas Shlomo, vol. II, #29.4 [in later editions: vol. II-III,\n  37.2]).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With a blood donation, it is quite obvious that \"most people\" are \"unconcerned of an illness\". As a matter of fact, you don't even know IF there is ANY kind of \"illness\" as you don't even know where your blood is going.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What happened to the burning bush?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Out of idle curiosity, when I was writing something else, I started wondering what happened to the burning bush after Moses \"left the scene\" -- I wondered if it just kept on burning or something. Half convinced that my memory was just terrible, I reread the beginning of Exodus from the Mechon Mamre site and realized that I actually couldn't find anything:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said: 'I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.' And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said: 'Moses, Moses.' And he said: 'Here am I.' (3:2-4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would suggest to me that the bush was still burning when Moses began talking to God, and the episode ends merely with Moses returning to Jethro (4:18). Between this, we do read that Moses is talking to <em>God</em>, but this I interpreted to just mean that he was talking to God through the bush.</p>\n\n<p>Given this, what actually ended up happening to the bush? Am I just missing something, or is there really no explanation in this specific portion of the text? If so, are there any standard explanations from other souces?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm citing two contrasting answers:</p>\n\n<p>1 - Sforno on Exodus 3:2:1 (using <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Exodus.3.2.1?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria.com's</a> translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><b>וירא מלאך ה' אליו</b> במראה הנבואה, כי אמנם כאשר יגלו המלאכים בדמות\n  אנשים בלתי נבואה, כענין לאברהם וללוט ולבלעם ולזולתם, לא יאמר עליהם\n  וַיֵרָא, אבל יאמר עליהם וַיַרְא, כמו וירא והנה שלשה אנשים, וירא לוט,\n  וירא את מלאך ה' נצב בדרך:</p>\n  \n  <p>וירא מלאך ה' אליו, in a prophetic vision. When angels  appear to\n  humans in human garb this is not considered a prophetic vision, i.e.\n  it is something of a lower order of Divine manifestation. Divine\n  communications to Avraham, Lot, Bileam, and others like them are not\n  described as וירא, vayeyrah, “it appeared.” However, the recipient is\n  described as וירא (<em>vayar</em>), “he saw,” i.e. he is described only in\n  his active role, not his role as receptacle of G’d’s communication.\n  Examples of the latter kind of communication occur in Genesis 18,2 as\n  well as in Genesis 19,1 and in Numbers 22,31.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, essentially, this explanation would state that this was not a physical bush but a vision, only.</p>\n\n<p>2 - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_bush\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Christian hermits originally gathered at Mount Serbal, believing it to\n  be the biblical Mount Sinai. However, in the 4th century, under the\n  Byzantine Empire, the monastery built there was abandoned in favour of\n  the newer belief that Mount Saint Catherine was the Biblical Mount\n  Sinai; a new monastery - Saint Catherine's Monastery was built at its\n  foot, and the alleged site of the biblical burning bush was\n  identified. The bush growing at the spot (a bramble, scientific name\n  Rubus sanctus[27]), was later transplanted several yards away to a\n  courtyard of the monastery, and its original spot was covered by a\n  chapel dedicated to the Annunciation, with a silver star marking where\n  the roots of the bush had come out of the ground. The Monks at Saint\n  Catherine's Monastery, following church tradition, believe that this\n  bush is, in fact, the original bush seen by Moses, rather than a later\n  replacement[citation needed], and anyone entering the chapel is\n  required to remove their shoes, just as Moses was said to have done so\n  in the biblical account.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, in modern times, it is not Mount Saint Catherine, but the\n  adjacent Jebel Musa (Mount Moses), which is currently identified as\n  Mount Sinai by popular tradition and guide books; this identification\n  arose from Bedouin tradition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Personally, the only credibility I give is to the concept that the bush was located at the spot that was later known as Mt. Sinai. The verse in Exodus 3:1 says that Moses led Jethro's sheep to Horeb, which was later known as Mt. Sinai. Whether Mt. Sinai is the place that is now called St. Catherine or whether at the time when Israel appeared at Mt. Sinai to receive the Torah that same bush was still there, would both be speculative. The Torah mentions nothing about either.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Adam 's sin out of deveikut?",
    "content": "# Adam 's sin out of deveikut?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I found this online:</p>\n\n<p>In his sefer \"Bilvavi Mishkan Evneh,\" R' Itamar Shwartz emphasizes the important point that our existence in this world is for the purpose of being davuk to our Creator; to be close with HaShem. As David HaMelech says \"V'ani, kirvas Elokim li tov\" \"And as for me, closeness to G-d is good\" Also- as we say by every kriyas haTorah \"V'atem ha'dveikim ba'Hashem Elokeichem, chaim koolchem hayom\" \"And you who cling to Hashem your G-d, you are alive, all of you, today.\" Meaning to be alive means to cling to G-d. One who isn't constantly concentrating on getting closer to his/her creator, isn't living in the truest sense. As the Zohar Hakadosh says, all the 613 Mitzvos are eitzos (advice) for us; each an opportunity to get closer to HaShem. If one looks at it that way, Yiddishkeit is never a burden, with 613 commandments that we must do, but rather its an amazing opportunity for us to serve HaShem through His 613 Mitzvos; each of which being another way we can gain a closer relationship with Him.</p>\n\n<p>A he'ara of my own: In this physical world, limited by space and time, \"closness\" is judged by distance between 2 things; inches, feet etc. But if we look at the olam haruchni, the spiritual world, there is no such thing as space and time. So how is closeness measured there? I was taught that it is by similarity. By ruchniyus, the more similar one thing is to another, the closer they are. That being the case, it would seem that for us to be closer to HaShem, we must become more like Him. Now this is a well known concept. \"B'tzelem Elokim nivra es ha'adam\" Man was created in the image of G-d-so we are like Him already and we have the ability to become more like Him.</p>\n\n<p>My question: \nAre there any midrashes or commentaries that explain the eating from the Tree Hada'at because Adam and Chava wanted to fullfil their purpose of becoming more like HaShem? In order to complete themselves (it's not said of Adam that He was Ki Tov - in reference to man - for his mission and purpose in this world is to create a man of whom someday it will hopefully be said he is Tov: Rashi states that in the same way the second day of creation doesn't state ki tov, thar it was omitted on that day, because the work of the water was not completed until the third day and a thing that is not completed is not at its perfection and at its best). Or any references that teach that Adam and Chava wanted to be like/close to G-d and therefore ate? </p>\n\n\n",

Rosh Hashana falls on the beginning of the new month of Tishrei.  Why then is Rosh Hashana on Tishrei 1 and 2 instead of Elul 30 and Tishrei 1?</p>\n\n<p>(I know there is no Elul 30; Elul always has 29 days.  Yom Kippur is on Tishrei 10 which we count from the first day of Rosh Hashana, so we can't just call it Elul 30 and Tishrei 1 -- this affects all the other days that month.)</p>\n\n<p>Rosh Hashana is the only <em>yom tov</em> that begins a month, and so I understand that <em>halacha's</em> treatment of it is different from the others: it's two days <em>everywhere</em>, including in Eretz Yisrael, and I've been told that the rabbis (in the talmud?) describe it as one long day.  But none of that tells me why it's shifted a day from other months.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/4381/jewish/Two-Days-of-Rosh-Hashanah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's a piece on Chabad.org explaining it.</a> Basically, it <em>is</em> on Elul 30 and Tishrei 1 -- the only problem is that Elul was set to only have 29 days.</p>\n\n<p>Back in the days of witness-based Rosh Chodesh, Elul sometimes had 29 and sometimes had 30 days. If it ended up having 29, then the day after (Tishrei 1) would be Rosh Hashanah and Tishrei 2 would be an ordinary day.<br>\nHowever, if the moon wasn't sighted by the time Elul 30 came around, what to do? Perhaps it would be sighted later that day, and then the day would retroactively be RH. But, it might not be. It was decreed that the 30th of Elul would be treated as RH <em>lechumra</em>. If it turned out that it wasn't, the actual day would be observed on the first of Tishrei.</p>\n\n<p>In the rest of the land, they wouldn't know when the day was established. After all, once it became RH, the court couldn't notify people far away. If i read it correctly, they would always observe 2 days because they wouldn't be sure.</p>\n\n<p>Since even during the time when the calendar was based on the sighting of the new moon two days of RH were observed, it was decreed that it would still be like that even with a fixed calendar. And since Elul was set to have 29 days, the 2 days are Tishrei 1 and 2.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You understand, I think, why there was a doubt about the day of Rosh Hashana and they needed two days (on the day after 29 Elul no one knew if witnesses would come or not, etc.). Thus, in fact, every date (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/29865/sfeika-dyoma-in-niddah\">eg.</a>) on the Hebrew calendar had a one-day doubt to it (if you lived far enough away that messengers couldn't get to you in that number of days), either forward or backward depending on which way the calendar 'defaults' to that month (ie if the previous month had 29 or 30 dates).</p>\n\n<p>The question you should be asking is why don't we have two day Rosh Chodesh after every month because of a doubtful day, because as it is now no month but Tishrei has a two day Rosh Chodesh due to that reason. The answer will hopefully soon be available here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/57498/759\">Why not two days of Rosh Hodesh, as we have two days of yontif?</a></p>\n\n\n",

Traditionally, Jewish people prefer reading books from publishers with known reputation and avoiding publishers mistranslating and misinterpreting the Hebrew texts. It is common that many authors add a letter of approbation, <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/haskamah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the haskama</a>, to ascertain appropriateness of the book content. Mitzvah regarding erasing Hashem's name is usually not applicable to English editions, which, as a rule, do not use the original Hebrew names of Hashem as discussed in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/144396/36610\">Chinuch Mitzvah 437</a>.</p>\n<p>Certainly, it is a good practice to care for one's books. To avoid damage due to moisture one should dry the book. To prevent pages from wrinkling and loosing their straight form due to wetness, some people may use paper towels or an iron with non-stick plate.

It is known that the Rabbis/Talmud legislates that Kthav Ashuri is to be considered the script that we now use and that the Tetragrammaton, when written in Ashuri has holiness. However, does that mean that the Tetragrammaton written in Paleo now has zero holiness?</p>\n<p>If I print a piece of paper with the Tetragrammaton written in Ashurith it has to go into a genizah, it cannot be thrown in the trash. But what if I printed the Tetragrammaton in paleo Hebrew, does it have any holiness according to halakha?</p>\n<p>If one were to find an instrument of the Beit Hamikdash, lets say the Tzitz.

I'll try to summarise:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rav Chaim Kanievsky (<a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/he/book/book.php?book=106392&pagenum=35\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Peirush on Massechet Tefillin</a>) writes that Torah scrolls that were written in <em>k'tav ivri</em> from before Ezra's time lost their <em>kedusha</em>, \"since they from now on it was not permitted to read them\" (\"כיון דמכאן ואילך לא ניתנו לקרות בהן\").</li>\n<li>Rav Kasher himself thinks that this reason doesn't make sense, and that the opposite is true (מסתבר להיפך). He writes that the language of Mar Zutra's (and some say Mar Ukva's) opinion in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.21b.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 21b</a> is that Israel <em>selected</em> (ביררו) <em>k'tav ashuri</em>, and not Ezra forbade <em>k'tav ivri</em>.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%96%D7%99\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Y'feh Mareh</a> on <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37359&st=&pgnum=237\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Megillah 1:7-8</a> writes that after Ezra instituted the change to <em>k'tav ashuri</em> (but before Israel \"selected\" <em>k'tav ashuri</em>), his decision couldn't be preferable to Moshe's. Thus, if someone wanted to write a Torah, they could choose between <em>k'tav ivri</em> (like Moshe) and <em>ashuri</em> (like Ezra) — at least until Israel \"selected\" <em>k'tav ashuri</em> for good. Rav Kasher claims that this approach does not disqualify Torahs written in <em>k'tav ivri</em> (although I [magicker72] don't understand how this deals with the time <em>after</em> Israel \"selected\" <em>k'tav ashuri</em>).</li>\n<li>Rav Kasher supports this view with the Ritva's words on <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/he/book/book.php?book=154930&pagenum=18\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Megillah 2b</a> that <em>k'tav ashuri</em> was \"given to them for writing Torahs and other writings\" (\"ניתן להם לכתוב ס״ת ושאר כתובים\"), and not that the use <em>k'tav ivri</em> was forbidden. He also brings <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Megillah.1.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishnah Megillah 1:8</a> that has the Rabbis' view that Torahs may be written in any language (and according to the Ritva and many Rishonim, also in any script). The Maharsha <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.21b.22?lang=bi&with=Chidushei%20Agadot&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes</a> that Israel didn't \"desire\" (לא רצו) the language that Ezra chose, and Rav Kasher adduces that the Maharsha didn't believe Ezra's choice to be a ruling, but rather a suggestion.</li>\n<li>[There follows a long back-and-forth where Rav Kasher discusses whether some sources may only be according to some opinions in Sanhedrin 21b, and I hope to summarise this later.]</li>\n<li>[Continuing at אות ו] Rav Kasher understands from the <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rtype=%D7%98%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%A1%D7%98&mfid=115847&rid=10544\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mirkevet HaMishnah</a> that even Moshe's Torah scroll is <em>pasul</em>, and Rav Kasher vehemently disagrees.</li>\n<li>R. Yaakov ibn Ḥabib writes (in <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/he/book/book.php?book=173954&pagenum=140\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HaKotev on Ein Yaakov</a>) that Torah was \"given\" (ניתנה) to Israel in the time of Ezra in <em>k'tav ivri</em>, and not that there was any type of ordinance. This supports the idea that previously <em>kosher</em> scrolls remained <em>kosher</em>.</li>\n<li>Rav Kasher turns to <em>tefillin</em> and <em>mezuzot</em>. Even the Rabbis who think that a Torah may be written in any language (and script) hold that <em>tefillin</em> and <em>mezuzot</em> must be written in Hebrew and <em>k'tav ashuri</em>. However, Rav Kasher still thinks that the above arguments (for a Torah) basically hold here too, and that there's room to argue that previously good <em>k'tav ivri</em> <em>tefillin</em> and <em>mezuzot</em> remain <em>kosher</em> after the switch.</li>\n<li>Rav Kasher adds that it's hard to imagine that on one day, all existing Torah scrolls and <em>tefillin</em> and <em>mezuzot</em> became <em>pasul</em>. They couldn't have all written new ones right away so fast. Even if there was some warning given, it's impossible that such a story would be absent from our records. He concludes that the <em>kedusha</em> of such items was never removed. He adds as support that disqualifying these items would bring disrepute upon those who came before the time of Ezra (as people would think that their ancestors did things incorrectly).</li>\n<li>Rav Kasher then brings (in אות ח) several examples of cases where the law changed, but previously permitted things remained permitted. This supports his thesis that the previously <em>kosher</em> scrolls remain <em>kosher</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Dedications and Their Expected Life-Span\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Several years ago I was doing an observation in a private secular pre-school. The school is housed in the former Talmud Torah building still owned by the synagogue immediately next door. (The student body is predominantly non-Jewish but the school  is obligated to follow kashrut and close on Jewish Holy Days.) The complex was built during the 1950’s when the neighborhood had a small, but not necessarily Orthodox, Jewish population. The Jewish population stagnated until the late nineties/early aughts when the area started growing into the thriving Orthodox neighborhood it is today. Since the children attend nearby yeshivot, there is no need for a Talmud Torah. While in a classroom, I noticed a rather large plaque peaking out of the side of a bookcase. It was a dedication to parents who died during the 1950’s. There were similar plaques hidden behind classroom furniture throughout the building.</p>\n\n<p>This got me thinking. Is there a halakhic source for the length of time a dedication (yahrzeit plaque, dedication of a room/building, Torah scroll, etc. must be displayed/ maintained? I am aware that sometimes when a congregation disbands,  they arrange for yahrzeit plaques to be transferred elsewhere. But what about situations such as I cited above? Doesn’t the contributor have some right to expect their dedication remains accessible as long as the building is owned by the congregation? Say someone donated big bucks to have a building dedicated to a loved one and a year or two from then an even wealthier person donates money to rename the building?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it generally accepted by Jewish scholars that Judaism was at one stage henotheist and/or monolatrist?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is widely believed, among scholars of the history of Judaism and the Jewish scriptures, that the earliest books of the Tanakh display a gradual shift from a position of henotheism, to a form of monolatry, and finally, to an exclusivist monotheism.</p>\n<h2>Terminology:</h2>\n<p>The differences between monolatry and henotheism are somewhat subtle and hard to nail down, but my understanding is as follows:</p>\n<h3>Henotheism:</h3>\n<p>Acknowledging that multiple deities exist and can be worshipped with validity, but limiting one's own worship to a single deity.  Although henotheists usually worship the same deity their entire lives, it is possible to switch allegiances, so to speak;  however, this behavior is more commonly associated with kathenotheism.</p>\n<h3>Kathenotheism:</h3>\n<p>Acknowledging that multiple deities exist, and worshipping one of them at a time, but switching between the different deities at will.  Usually considered a subset of henotheism.</p>\n<h3>Monolatrism [Also known as Monolatry]:</h3>\n<p>Acknowledging that multiple deities exist, but worshipping only one of them, and maintaining that the other deities are not worthy of worship.  Usually considered a subset of henotheism.</p>\n<h3>Monotheism:</h3>\n<p>Belief in a single deity, who is the only legitimate object of worship.</p>\n<p><em>Note:  Polytheists can sometimes also be henotheists (acknowledging the entire pantheon, but worshipping only one of the deities within it), but it is more common for them to engage in some degree of kathenotheism (acknowledging the entire pantheon, and worshipping one deity at a time, but switching from one to the next at will).</em></p>\n<h2>Relevant Passages:</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; they took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons; and they served their <strong>gods</strong> (Judges 3:5—6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>What god</strong> is there in the heaven or on the earth who can do according to your works and according to your mighty deeds?’ (Deut. 3:24)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For you, O Yahweh, are most high over all the earth. You are highly exalted above <strong>all gods</strong> (Ps. 97:9)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now therefore revere the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness; put away the <strong>gods</strong> that your ancestors served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. Now if you are unwilling to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the <strong>gods</strong> your ancestors served in the region beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD (Joshua 24:14—15).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then [Elohim] said, “Let <strong>us</strong> make mankind in <strong>our</strong> image, in <strong>our</strong> likeness” (Genesis 1:26)<sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Elohim] stands in the <strong>assembly</strong> of El; in the midst of <strong>the gods</strong> he renders judgment (Ps. 82:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For who in the skies can compare to G-d? Who is like [Jehovah] among the [<strong>sons of G-d</strong>], a G-d who is honored [<strong>in the great assembly of the holy ones</strong>], and more awesome than <strong>all who surround him</strong>? (Ps. 89:6–7)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For G-d is the great G-d, and the great King above <strong>all gods</strong> (Ps. 95:3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>All the gods</strong> bow down before G-d (Ps. 97:7).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know G-d is great, and our Lord is superior to <strong>all gods</strong>. (Ps. 135:5)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the LORD God said, \"The man has now become like one of <strong>us</strong>, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.\"  (Gen. 3:22)<sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Come, let <strong>us</strong> go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.\"  (Gen. 11:7)<sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not follow <strong>other gods</strong>, the <strong>gods</strong> of the peoples around you (Deut. 6:14)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But you must not turn away from all the commandments I am giving you today, to either the right or left, nor pursue <strong>other gods</strong> and worship them (Deut. 28:14–15)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"You shall have no other <strong>gods <em>before me</em></strong>” (Ex. 20:3)<sup>2</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>1</sup>The use of the first person plural (i.e., \"us\", \"we\", \"our\") implies that G-d is speaking to other beings who are roughly equivalent to Himself, in kind if not degree.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup>This commandment wouldn't be especially significant for our purposes if it didn't include the words \"<strong>before me</strong>\".  Scholars have long noticed that this inclusion suggests that it is permissible to have other gods, so long as G-d is always held above the others and given precedence and priority over them at all times.  If the passage said only \"You shall have no other gods\", it would be unquestionably monotheistic, but as it is now, it clearly doesn't exclude the possibility that other gods exist -  or even that these other gods can be worshipped, provided that they are accorded lesser status than Elohim.</p>\n<h2>The Question:</h2>\n<p>I am familiar with the Christian explanations of these passages:  it is usually argued that when G-d uses the first person plural, He is speaking to either Jesus and the holy spirit, or to the angels and the assorted hosts of heaven.  In the more difficult to explain cases, other explanations are necessary.  When G-d is described as sitting at the head of a council of gods, Christians say that the issue is one of translation, and what we read as \"a council of gods\" is actually a council of angels.  When G-d makes explicit reference to other gods, Christians say that these other gods don't actually exist.  I'm not convinced by any of these arguments, and I would like to hear what Jews have to say about it.</p>\n<h3>I am curious as to how Judaism deals with these passages, and whether most Jews acknowledge the scholarly consensus on the henotheist and monolatrist origins of Judaism.  Is there a generally accepted explanation?  And do Jewish scholars accept the idea that Judaism grew from henotheist and/or monolatrist roots?</h3>\n\n\n",

I am citing only those items related to the building design.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Architecture</strong>: The Noda Biyhuda (tinyana, Orach Chaim 18) writes that\n  there is no formal obligation to build the shul with four walls in\n  correspondence with the design of the Temple. He permits building a\n  shul in any shape, provided that the intention is for reasons of space\n  and convenience, and not to emulate non-Jewish architecture.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Doors and Hallways</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>The interior design of a shul is halachically prescribed, and also\n  relies heavily on comparison to the Temple.</p>\n  \n  <p>Tosefta in Megillah 3:14, teaches that the doors to a shul must be\n  constructed on the eastern side. Just as the doors of the Temple\n  opened westwards, so too, the doors of a shul should open to the west.\n  In the Temple, this design ensured that upon entering, one would bow\n  before the inner chamber. In a shul, one must do so in the direction\n  of the Aron Ha-Kodesh – the ark containing the Torah scrolls. From\n  this Tosefta, the Shulchan Aruch (150:5) derives that doors to a shul\n  must be positioned so, that one who enters is facing the direction of\n  the Aron. (The Aron’s location is determined based on the direction of\n  prayer in the specific area.)</p>\n  \n  <p>An interesting addition to this is found in the rulings of the Chasam\n  Sofer.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Bach (Orach Chaim 90) learns from the Yerushalmi that a hallway\n  must be constructed as an entranceway to a shul. This halachah is also\n  quoted by Magen Avraham (35) and Mishnah Berurah (61). Based on\n  comparison with the Temple entrances, the Chasam Sofer (Orach Chaim\n  27) rules that the doors to the hallway should not be aligned with the\n  doors to the shul itself, but should rather be to the north and south\n  (assuming that the doors of the shul are in the east).</p>\n  \n  <p>In reality, it seems that not many shul architects are familiar with\n  this halacha.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Trees</strong>: Rabbi Akiva Eiger (glosses to Shulchan Aruch 150:1) quotes Rav\n  D. Arama who prohibits planting trees in the courtyard of a shul. This\n  corresponds with the prohibition of planting trees “adjacent with the\n  altar of Hashem.” Authorities discuss this prohibition (see Piskei\n  Teshuvos 150:19, note 90), which applies specifically to trees (and\n  not to bushes or flowers). Some adopt a more stringent position and\n  some a lenient stance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My comment re the direction of the ark & doorways - The upstairs of my shul has the ark facing south. The downstairs chapel's ark faces east. I don't know why the upstairs was designed that way.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, if you have visited the Touro Synagogue in Newport Rhode Island, the shul building faces diagonally compared with the surrounding street grid. I understand that when built, the shul building was designed according to the above specs that the ark face east and the doorway is opposite. I assume that the street grids were designed a century or later after the shul was built.</p>\n\n\n",

(emphasis added)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi, a famous Biblical commentator, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213#showrashi=true&v=2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">says there</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>והנה שלשה אנשים:</strong> אחד לבשר את שרה ואחד להפוך את סדום ואחד לרפאות את אברהם, שאין מלאך אחד עושה שתי שליחיות. תדע לך שכן כל הפרשה הוא מזכירן בלשון רבים (פסוק ח) ויאכלו, (פסוק ט) ויאמרו אליו, ובבשורה נאמר (שם י) ויאמר שוב אשוב אליך, ובהפיכת סדום הוא אומר (יט כב) כי לא אוכל לעשות דבר, (שם כא), לבלתי הפכי. ורפאל שרפא את אברהם הלך משם להציל את לוט, הוא שנאמר (שם יז) ויהי כהוציאם אותם החוצה ויאמר המלט על נפשך, למדת שהאחד היה מציל:</p>\n<p><strong>And behold, three men:</strong> One to bring the news [of Isaac’s birth] to Sarah, and one to overturn Sodom, and one to heal Abraham, for one angel does not perform two errands (Gen. Rabbah 50:2). You should know that [this is true] because throughout the entire chapter, Scripture mentions them in the plural, e.g., (below verse 8): “and they ate” ; (ibid. verse 9): “and they said to him.” Concerning the announcement, however, it says (ibid. verse 10): “And he said: I will surely return to you.” And concerning the overturning of Sodom, it says (below 19:22): “For I will not be able to do anything”; (ibid. verse 21): “I will not overturn” (Gen. Rabbah 50:11). And Raphael, who healed Abraham, went from there to save Lot. This is what is stated: “And it came to pass when they took them outside, that he [the angel] said, ‘Flee for your life.’” You learn that only one acted as a deliverer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, when these angels later visit Sodom, there are only 2 of them (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.1?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">19:1</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַ֠יָּבֹאוּ שְׁנֵ֨י הַמַּלְאָכִ֤ים סְדֹ֙מָה֙ בָּעֶ֔רֶב וְל֖וֹט יֹשֵׁ֣ב בְּשַֽׁעַר־סְדֹ֑ם וַיַּרְא־לוֹט֙ וַיָּ֣קָם לִקְרָאתָ֔ם וַיִּשְׁתַּ֥חוּ אַפַּ֖יִם אָֽרְצָה׃</p>\n<p>And the <strong>two angels</strong> came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom; and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he fell down on his face to the earth. (emphasis added)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Rashi said, the angel that brought the message of Isaac's birth did not have anything else to do, so when the other angels continued with their task, that one seems to have just vanished.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rosh HaShanna glossary: What do hain, hesed, and rachamim mean?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are many words in the siddur and in the machzor for Rosh HaShanna that seem central to the prayers for the season including hain, hesed, and rachamim, and also words translated as: help, save, pity, redeem, pardon, forgive, console, hamol (heb. - also translated as pity), charity, tear up evil decree, gracious, mercy, aid, heal, rescue (hatzlianu), chapar (grant tonement), and return.  (Surely this list is not complete.)</p>\n\n<p>Some of these terms seem similar.  Some of the translations have Christian overtones.  </p>\n\n<p>I am looking for a glossary or discussion of the various terms for repentance, etc.  Can anyone point me toward such a document.  If not, might anyone provide some ways to understand which of these terms are absolute synonyms, which are similar terms, and which are completely different?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is an excellent question while at the same time being perhaps too large to really answer in just a few paragraphs. What you are really asking about is one of the main mitzvot that we practice, namely davening with intention (בכוונה או בעיון), meaning in plain translation with the meaning of the words. See Mishnah Peah 1:1 and Shabbat 127a.</p>\n\n<p>If you are fortunate, this goal will be one of your endeavors for the rest of your life. You success to that end will only be limited by your proficiency in Hebrew and Aramaic.</p>\n\n<p>An excellent source to learn the meaning of words in prayer is the Siddur Kol Yaacov. You can read it online at the following link:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/6755\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/6755</a></p>\n\n<p>If you find it helpful, it can also be ordered in hardcover from the same link.</p>\n\n<p>Chen (חן), Chesed (חסד) and Rachamim (רחמים) are loosely translated as Grace, Kindness and Mercy. They are the words used to identify the three pillars of the system of existence which the Creator established in all of creation. Left is for \"Chen\", right is for \"Chesed\" and the middle pillar is for \"Rachamim\". Everything is based upon it.</p>\n\n<p>It is the basis for the 3 Avot, Avraham (who is associated with the quality of Chesed), Yitzchok (who is associated with the quality of Chen or Gevurah) and Yaacov (who is associated with the quality of Rachamim). This idea is also found in the opening blessing of the Amidah and also in the opening paragraph of Birkat HaMazon.</p>\n\n<p>This is also the source of the idea that the nation of Israel is \"Am Segulah\" which many translate as \"Treasured Nation\" or \"Chosen Nation\". But is actually better understood as \"Adaptable Nation\". Segulah also means adaptable. It derives from the vowel point called \"Segol\" which is 3 dots.</p>\n\n<p>In the same fashion, on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, we say in the \"Unatanah Tokef Prayer\" (ונתנה   תוקף) which emphasizes the 3 pillars of Torah, Tefillah and Tzedakah by which any harsh decree is overturned. A link for this prayer can be found at the following link:\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unetanneh_Tokef\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unetanneh_Tokef</a></p>\n\n<p>This idea is also implied from the first three letters of the Aleph-Beit, namely \"Aleph\", \"Beit\" and \"Gimmel\". The \"Aleph\" has a meaning of learning and teaching which corresponds with Torah. For more details see the following link:\n<a href=\"http://www.tzfat-kabbalah.org/whatis.asp?p=1151\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.tzfat-kabbalah.org/whatis.asp?p=1151</a></p>\n\n<p>And this leads to the letter \"Beit\" to be associated with the pillar of judgement and \"Gevurah\". Just like the Torah begins with the letter \"Beit\" in \"Bereshit\" which talks about the beginning of creation. And in so doing, created the concept of duality which is a concealment of G-d's oneness. And yet at the same time it is also associated with the concept of blessing (ברכה). Ultimately, this concealment of HaShem's unity will be revealed for good and blessing. This is also understood from the paragraph of \"Kadesh\" (Shemot 13:1) said at the end of morning prayers in connection with tefillin. It emphasizes that we are to remember that G-d answered our prayers and brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand (כי בחזק יד כו״). This \"strong hand\" is explained in the Haggadah to be associated with the plague of \"dever\" which is judgement and severity. This is how it appears externally. Yet remembering this in connection with the hand tefillin which is placed on the weak hand, the left arm, emphasizes to us that the \"strong hand\" is the right hand, the side of kindness. The aspect of judgement is concealed kindness and actually saves us.</p>\n\n<p>Chen (חן) is usually understood to be an abbreviation for the phrase Chachmat Nistar (חכמת נסתר). This is often translated as \"Wisdom of Concealed Things\" borrowing from the meaning as it is applied to Queen Esther's name (see Megillah 13a). But it also has a connotation of \"Protection\" as found in Midrash Tehillim on Psalm 19:7. This idea is also mentioned by Rabbi Moshe Cordevero in Pardes Rimonim, Sha'ar Archei HaKinuim in connection with the word \"Chanun\" (חנון). He explains that this is the idea of kindness even though one doesn't merit kindness. It comes from the posuk, \"And He said: I will make all My goodness pass before you...and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show mercy to whom I will be merciful.\" (Shemot 33:19) Thus the letter \"Beit\" and the idea of \"Chen\" are associated with the aspect of tefillah.</p>\n\n<p>The letter \"Gimmel\" is associated with the third pillar, \"Rachamim\" and the concept of \"Gemilut Chesed\", to do acts of kindness. This is the concept of \"Tzedakah\". It also has a connotation of strength, like \"Gevurah\" but from a different direction. In this case, it is associated with the idea of specifically where the hand tefillin is placed, the \"Tigboret\" (תגבורת), the high spot of the muscle in the arm. This is associated with the idea of having the strength to lend assistance to those in need. And through this strength one joins and unifies the other two pillars. For more details, see the following link:\n<a href=\"http://www.tzfat-kabbalah.org/whatis.asp?p=1152\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.tzfat-kabbalah.org/whatis.asp?p=1152</a></p>\n\n<p>It is important to keep in mind that there is a process which begins in Elul and extends all the way through to Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah. Elul up to erev Rosh HaShanah is the time when we prepare for Tishrei. We try to get our \"books in order\"  through \"Cheshban HaNefesh\" and if something is lacking or incorrect through excess, balance the checkbook. That balancing is the extra acts of kindness, Torah study and prayer that we do during the month of Elul. G-d is accessible and \"in the field\" so to speak. Available to everyone no matter the circumstance.</p>\n\n<p>On erev Rosh HaShanah, going into Rosh HaShanah, G-d relinquishes His Kingship in a manner of speaking. This period is called the \"Nesirah\" (נסירה) from the root (יסר) meaning \"removed\" or \"restricted\". The purpose of this is so that we can renew our acceptance of G-d as our King. This is derived from the posuk, \"There is no King without a people.\" (אין מלך בלא עם)</p>\n\n<p>We announce our acceptance of His Kingship and crown G-d King through the blowing of the shofar on Rosh HaShanah. And the  following days are manifesting that Kingship in progressively greater levels until it is manifest in the most physical and mundane things during Sukkot.</p>\n\n<p>According to Sefer Meori Ohr and Sefer Pardes Rimonim: Sha'ar Archei HaKinuim, \"Hashiveinu\" (השיבנו) and \"Karveinu\" (קרבינו) are closely related concepts. The root of Hashiveinu is \"Teshuvah\" (תשובה) which in turn is from \"Shabbat\" (שבת). This root of Shabbat (ש׳ בת) is comprised of the letter \"Shin\" and the word \"Bat\", meaning daughter. Daughter alludes to the concept of Malchut (Kingship) which is a central theme of Rosh HaShanah. The form of the letter \"Shin\" is made up from 3 \"kavim\", 3 lines or \"Vavim\". This indicates that the precursors needed from us prior to the revelation of G-d's Kingship are the 3 services of Torah, Tefillah and Acts of Kindness. And these correspond with the 3 general systems which G-d used to create the universe, namely the right kav which is \"Chesed\", the left kav which is \"Gevurah\" and the middle kav which is \"Rachamim\" or \"Tiferet\" which mediates between the two extremes and inclines all toward kindness in an equitable manner.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar fashion, \"Karveinu\" is associated with both \"Karev\" (קרב) which means to draw close together and also has an implication of that this drawing together is because of what is within. That we all have one \"source\" and \"father\" (אב אחד). It is also associated with \"Korban\" (קרבן) which is the offerings made in the Temple. These were the vehicle by which the \"sparks\" were elevated, something done now with blessings and prayers. \"Korban\" (קרבן) has a value of 352 (שנ״ב) which parallels the concept for \"Shabbat\". Only this time it is (ש׳ בן) a \"Shin\" followed by \"Ben\", \"son\". The aspect that we are all children to HaShem \n(בנים אתם להוי׳). And this is the running theme of \"Avinu Malkeinu\" (אבינו מלכנו), our Father, our King.</p>\n\n<p>The word \"Salach\" (סלח) has a value of 98. The Meori Ohr points out that this is the value of G-d's 4 letter name (הוי׳) together with the expanded form of that name called \"Av\" (ע״ב). In that form of G-d's name the \"Yud\" is (יו״ד). The two \"Hehs\" are like this (ה״י). And the letter \"Vav\" is expanded like this (וי״ו). The concept of name expansion is the idea of how His blessings manifest into existence from above existence, meaning from His transcendent 4 letter name. In the case of this particular name it is associated with \"Chesed\", kindness (חסד) because His kindness is eternal (כי לעולם חסדו). \"Salach\" is also associated with \"Segulah\" (סגלה which has the same value of 98) which means both treasured and adaptable as discussed above.</p>\n\n<p>The Meori Ohr says that \"Chamal\" (חמל), \"Chalam\" (חלם), \"Melach\" (מלח) and \"Machal\" (מחל) all come from the same root. Their value is 78 (ע״ב) which is 3 times G-d's name (3 times 26). This again relates back to the concept of making motzi at the Shabbat table and dipping the bread לחם) 3) times in the salt(מלח). This repeats the idea of the 3 kavin mentioned above and how this results in everything being inclined toward kindness. And this is what we declare in benching with \"And He gives bread to all flesh because His kindness is eternal.\" \n(והוא נותן לים לכל בשר כי לעולם חסדו)</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that is all I have time for today. Shabbat Shalom! </p>\n\n<p>May you be written and sealed for a good and sweet year both spiritually and physically.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>an interesting question.

I chose this particular lack of meteg example to highlight that the lack of metegs causes Ashkenazi Jews to incorrectly say HalleLUyah instead of HAlleluYAH as the author of Psalms intended. Oddly enough this same Ashkenazi mispronunciation is also common amongst Christians.</p>\n\n<p>This same Livorno siddur has a meteg under the shin for Kiddush that you requested as well.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/g4KtA.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/g4KtA.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>If you are wanting a siddur with metegs because you want more pronunciation accuracy then I suggest that you switch to a Sephardic or Yemenite Siddur and abandon Ashkenazi siddurim and tikkunim. In general Sepharadi siddurim will have more metegs than Ashkenazi siddurim, and will often have the te'amim for the most amount of accuracy possible. Yemenite siddurim lack te'amim in general (even for Shema'), but have metegs in equal measure as their Sephardic counterparts.</p>\n\n<p>For a clear and easy to read Sephardic siddur I recommend a reprinting of the Livorno Siddur. For a clear and easy to read Yemenite siddur I recommend the Siah Yerushalayim.</p>\n\n\n",

Avodah Zara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foreign_Worship_and_Customs_of_the_Nations.7.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7:1</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה הִיא לְאַבֵּד עֲבוֹדַת כּוֹכָבִים וּמְשַׁמְּשֶׁיהָ וְכָל הַנַּעֲשֶׂה בִּשְׁבִילָהּ שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים יב-ב) 'אַבֵּד תְּאַבְּדוּן אֶת כָּל הַמְּקוֹמֹת' וְנֶאֱמַר (דברים ז-ה) 'כִּי אִם כֹּה תַעֲשׂוּ לָהֶם' וְגוֹ'. וּבְאֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל מִצְוָה לִרְדֹּף אַחֲרֶיהָ עַד שֶׁנְּאַבֵּד אוֹתָהּ מִכָּל אַרְצֵנוּ. אֲבָל בְּחוּץ לָאָרֶץ אֵין אָנוּ מְצֻוִּין לִרְדֹּף אַחֲרֶיהָ אֶלָּא כָּל מָקוֹם שֶׁנִּכְבּשׁ אוֹתוֹ נְאַבֵּד כָּל עֲבוֹדַת כּוֹכָבִים שֶׁבּוֹ. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים יב-ג) 'וְאִבַּדְתֶּם אֶת שְׁמָם מִן הַמָּקוֹם הַהוּא'. בְּאֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל אַתָּה מְצֻוֶּה לִרְדֹּף אַחֲרֵיהֶן וְאִי אַתָּה מְצֻוֶּה לִרְדֹּף אַחֲרֵיהֶן בְּחוּץ לָאָרֶץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize: idolatrous sites in Israel must be destroyed, but in the Diaspora, one need not pursue idolatrous sites. Rather, if one controls one, he ought to destroy it.</p>\n<p>Rambam famously rules (Hil. T'shuvah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.3.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:7</a>) Cf. Mishna commentary to Sanhedrin (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.10.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">10:3</a>)) that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worship_of_angels\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">angel worship</a> is also forbidden. (Even if one only prays to angels in the capacity of intermediaries to God).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכֵן הָעוֹבֵד כּוֹכָב אוֹ מַזָּל וְזוּלָתוֹ כְּדֵי לִהְיוֹת מֵלִיץ בֵּינוֹ וּבֵין רִבּוֹן הָעוֹלָמִים. כָּל אֶחָד מֵחֲמִשָּׁה אֵלּוּ הוּא מִין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Would the same laws relating to places of idolatry (particularly the obligation to destroy them) apply to sits where angels are prayed to as intermediaries as well?</p>\n<p><code>Clarification</code>: The core question is whether the laws of <em>abed t'abed</em> apply to sites of \"intermediary-worship\" this may be related to the question of whether the \"minut\" that angel-worship constitutes (according to Rambam) is identical to idolatry.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Further clarifications: I realize that there may be many variables that impede implementation of this on a practical or theoretical level; I am not asking about them.</p>\n<p>I am not asking about particular prayers of different religions and whether they ought to be interpreted as the aforementioned angel-worship. I am only asking about bona fide angel worship.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It seems pretty clear from the Rambam's first law of Idolatry that nearly all such worship was of angels. Idolatry is born of worshipping G-d's \"entourage\" because they are closer to the King, and then focusing so much on the middle-man they forget there is a G-d it was supposed to be all about.</p>\n\n<p>This does appear to be historically true. The Chaldean god Kerub was a bull, who pulled the wagon carrying people's prayers up to heaven and heaven's bounty back to people. In Egypt this god was called Apis, and was worshipped in two temples-- Memphis and Heliopilis, opposite ends of the kingdom. Each with a Golden Bull. R SR Hirsch suggests that the Golden Calf was Apis worship. After all, the Benei Yisrael ask for someone to lead now that Moshe is gone -- a middleman god. Then Yeravam sets up two Temples on opposite ends of the Northern Kingdom and puts a Golden Bull in front of each. He even moved the fall holiday to the eighth month, to match Apis's. And he declares \"This is your god, Israel\", echoing Aharon's words then he presents them with the Golden Calf. Kerub, Apis, the Golden Calf and Rechavam's temples were all keruvim (cherub) worship.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, further down in history, thunder is a real natural phenomenon, and thus there is an angel behind it, whether that angel is worshiped as Zeus or Thor or not at all. Or Ares/Mars and War. Etc...</p>\n\n<p>A non-Jew has the power to nullify the state of his idol. And thus the idol of any god that was once worshipped by non-Jews but is no longer worshiped would be nullified. We are under no obligation to destroy temples of Ba'al. (To pick an example from current events.)</p>\n\n\n",

G-d promises to protect the land from invaders during this time.</p>\n\n<p>For how many years was this mitzva kept during the First Temple era? And were there occasions when the enemies of Israel tried to take advantage of the festivals' celebration by attempting to invade the land?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: My question also pertains to after the breakup of the Ten Tribes (i.e. for the remaining Jews in Israel loyal to the kingdom of David's descendant).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Only the years we had a Mishkan (year 2 of the Exodus) through a few years after Shelomo's reign. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi (Qoheles 1:1) quotes a tradition that Shelomo haMelekh calls himself Qoheles at the beginning of the book because he saw through Ruach haQodesh that he would be the only king -- until the messianic one -- to perform the mitzvah of haQhel. The mitzvah required a king, a BHMQ, and that it be Sukkos the year after shemittah. Everyone gathered to hear the king read parts of sefer Devarim. Since there was no BHMQ until Shelomo, he was the first able to do the mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>Shelomo haMelekh died and the 10 now-lost tribes of the north were tired of paying taxes and putting in mandatory service to the state to support a capital and Beis haMiqdash (BHMQ) so far from home. They broke away under their own king, Yeravam ben Nevat, and formed the Northen Kingdom, Malkhus Yisrael. Yeravam ben Nevat created his own variant of the religion -- actually more like a variant of the Golden Calf religion -- with its own two Temples.</p>\n\n<p>By the next chance to do haQhel, Rechavam, Shelomo's son, king of the southern Malkhus Yehudah, was given the Torah. He was allowed to sit while reading, but the only person allowed to sit in the Beis haMiqdash is the Davidic King. Yeravam ben Nevat was offended that Rechavam was permitted to sit while he had to stand. This was the final break. Along with this religion and disconnection from the Beis haMiqdash, Yeravam made it illegal for his citizens to go to the southern kingdom, Malkhus Yehudah. So, the majority of the Israelites would be taking their lives in their hands to go on aliyas haregel.</p>\n\n<p>Meaning the haQhel after Shelomo was the last time that Malkhus Yisrael, the majority of the Benei Yisrael, were able to visit the Beis haMiqdash.</p>\n\n<p>But the remaining Jews did practice aliyah laregel all through the second BHMQ.</p>\n\n<p>The question of safety is interesting. They had no enemies during Shelomo's reign, but even after the breakup, safety would be an issue -- it's not like Malkhus Yisrael was standing watch ready to help Malkhus Yehudah, nor did the lost tribes help the Jews of the Second Temple era. While it's nice to think Hashem kept us safe miraculously, there are lists of miracles that occurred at the BHMQ, and I never saw this one. E.g. Pirqei Avos 5:7, which includes the fact that no one ever complained about a lack of space, implicitly about aliya laregel -- when the number of visitors was at its peak.</p>\n\n<p>I would conclude, therefore, that security simply trumped the mitzah of aliyah laregel -- not everyone in active service got leave for the holiday.</p>\n\n\n",

Lot (Lamed Vov Tes) has the numerical value of 45 representing the rear of the Name Mah [A way of spelling out each letter of the Tetragrammon to total a numerical value of 45]. But it (Lot at that level) is the source Chochma and Bina of Klippa, therefore he is called Lot related to the word curse, and therefore Lot traveled with Avraham before the purification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In that place he alludes to Eisav having a similar relationship to Yitzchak. In <a href=\"http://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/toraor/6/20b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">another place</a> he expands on that. Quite a bit more technical than the above, but in summary Esav represents the level of Klippah which allows energy to be drawn from Kedusha without being affected by it - the 11th level, whereas Sefiros in Kedusha number 10 only.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The discussion offered by @Yishai above is accurate.

Lot is cursed because his two daughters become for him the parallel to Leah and Rochel for Yaacov. Meaning they become his wives.</p>\n\n<p>Esav on the other hand is associated with the nachash in Meori Ohr, Letter Ayin, chapter 68. Esav עשו, is נחש חי, living serpent. He is also related to his ministering angel on the side of klippah, Samael (סמאל). This is because the letter Samech is exchanged with the letter Shin. Then include the letters and kollel.</p>\n\n<p>This function of the nachash is relating to the nachash of kedusha, meaning before the sin in the Garden of Eden. This is also discussed at length in Leshem Shevo v'Achlama, Sefer Deah.</p>\n\n\n",

I managed to find <a href=\"http://www.abarim-publications.com/Dictionary/he/he-l-l.html#.Vee-bJdlBhF\" rel=\"nofollow\">one resource</a> that brings an explanation for both of their definitions together and adds the third one of madness, while trying to provide an etymology of sorts within English scholarship: \"Wilhelm Gesenius squeezed all various meanings and nuances of halal into the central charge of splenduit. But almost a hundred years later, the authoritative dictionary of Brown, Driver and Briggs, listed two separate roots halal, each with their own group of meanings. Three quarters of a century later, Harris, Archer and Waltke published their lexicon, and split the second root of Brown, Driver and Briggs in two, forming three distinct roots halal\"  1)'shine, emit light,' 2)'to be boastful or to praise,' 3)'to be insane, or rather irrational.' His explanation of how they play against one another is also interesting.</p>\n\n<p>I didn't find the reference in Jaastrow, but @Yaacov Deane mentions in his discussion with Daniel a lack of clarity on the meaning of the additional strokes or what sort of conjugation or other grammatical meaning they imply, something that's important for this theory of הֵילֵ֣ל descending from הָלַל, but they do look pretty similar (granted that it's language; even one stroke can make a world of difference)</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Hebrew scholarship\"</strong>\n@msh210 references several sources (thank you for the multi-volume search), noting both broad agreement in Hebrew scholarship on a fourth general definition of a shining planet or star, but he points out a lack of clarity still on whether that definition is a name of said celestial body or a generic term for such a one.

If he's just teaching you Tanya though it should be fine, because once again the Tanya is not \"mashichist\" propaganda in any sense, being over 200 years old (and I say that also based on having learnt through the whole of Tanya).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Baal hatanya was a huge Talmid Chochom who's Sefer Shulcan Aruch Harav is a classic in Halacha. His Sefer, Tanya, as well is a very holy Sefer learnt by Talmedei Chochomim of all stripes. Even Rav Yoshe Ber Solleveichik, a total Litvak, was very fond of Tanya (having learnt it as a child from his Chabad Melamed), and would quote it. The Satmar Rebbe, as well, a stark opponent of Chabad, considered Tanya to be a very important Sefer. Many Roshei Yeshivah have learnt it including Rav Aharon Lopiansky Shlita who gives Shiurim on it (you can find them online). The Tanya has nothing to do with the Meshichists. Not learning Tanya because the Meshichists learn it would be like not learning Gemara because the Meshichists learn it.\nAs for learning it with a Meshichist,i don't see why it would be a problem, unless they are going to read that ideology into the Tanya.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Meshichists give Chabad a bad name.

It is no thanks to these guys, that the GOOD NAME that Chassidus bought itself over CENTURIES was tarnished and practically brought back to where we started, over 230 years ago.</p>\n<p>The original war against Chassidus was due to many, many misunderstandings and tons of false accusations. By the third generation of Chabad Chassidus (led by the Tzemach Tzedek), all the original issues the Jewish world may have had with it were solved. The questions were answered, and peace was held. The ensuing battles were mostly fought together by all of Orthodox Jewry against the haskallah movement, and the antisemitism that reigned.</p>\n<p>That being said, Tanya was written by the first Rebbe of Chabad, so following the period when the orthodox Jewish world made peace with Chassidim, there is no official view that negates its authenticity.</p>\n<p>Next point: the entire point of Chassidus is to bridge the various parts of Torah - the PARDES (pshat, remez, etc.) in a way that makes everything clearer and more relatable. It is NOT, as is a common misconception, a \"distilled version\" of Kabbalah. Much to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Learning with a Meshichist, I would highly NOT recommend, for the most part, for one simple reason: from my 7-8 years being ALL OVER various Chabad communities, yeshivas, etc., I have seen that <em>for the most part</em> Meshichists have a very feeble, extremely shallow understanding of Chassidus, and in general learning with one will not bring justice to the depth and richness that Chassidus has to offer.

He states that the most important thing is the intention of ridding sins in the \"upper ocean\".</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, it may be possible that the 1st & 2nd items in the list may be permissible, but I'm uncertain, if this can be inferred.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to this article it is \"ideal\" to use a flowing, natural body of water that contains fish and is located outside the city boundaries (MA 583:5; Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 129:21).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/tzarich-iyun/tzarich_iyun_tashlich/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/tzarich-iyun/tzarich_iyun_tashlich/</a></p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I was in Yerushalayim for Rosh Hashanah this year for the first time. I saw in Yeshivas Netzach Yisrael in Rechavia that they had a small fishbowl with two goldfish swimming in it to be used for saying tashlich. This would seem to imply that they hold there is no minimum size requirement, and it need not be a \"natural\" body of water, but that the presence of fish is preferable.</p>\n\n<p>When I was in Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavne a number of years ago, the custom there was to stand outside the beit hamidrash and recite tashlich in the general direction of the Mediterranean Sea - which was about 7km away. This despite the fact that the ocean was definitely not visible from where we were standing. This seems to imply that it is sufficient to be aware of the presence of water without actually seeing it, and obviously invites the question of how far away one can be for this to work.</p>\n\n<p>I also wonder if this can be invoked to answer DanF's question as to whether the water has to be there currently. Maybe standing next to a (recently?) dried-up lake is sufficient to remind us of the concept of water, and thus allow tashlich to be said. (Although you would miss out on the presence of fish.)</p>\n\n\n",

Avodah Zara (2:1), does he mention <em>human</em> intermediaries explicitly.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein writes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14679&hilite=db1551d7-f634-4c37-ae93-219dc0484e9a&st=%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%A7%D7%A9%20%D7%9E%D7%94%D7%9D%20%D7%A9%D7%94%D7%9D%20%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow\">Igrot Moshe vol. 8 OCH ch. 43</a>)  that even according to those who forbid prayers to angels as intermediaries in any circumstance, utilizing human intermediaries is permitted. This is true for prophets as evident from II Kings (4:23) and for Torah scholars as evident from Berakhot 34b.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך איכא מחלוקת רבותינו הראשונים לבקש מהם שהם בשליחותם יעשו באופן היותר טוב לפנינו, דיש אוסרין גם זה. אבל לבקש אדם כשהוא בחיים להתפלל ולברך, הוא דבר הראוי והנכון.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later in the piece he writes that utilizing <em>dead</em> people as intermediaries, however, is more complicated. (1)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך לאדם שמת, שכבר לא שייך שהוא יתפלל, אלא שנשמתו שהיא בגנזי מרומים שייך שתתפלל עבור אלו החיים, שלאלו דסוברים דלמלאכים אסור יש לעיין אם גם לבנ\"א  שמתו אסור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whether or not R. Moshe's arguments are compelling, there is powerful proof for his conclusion. Short of an explicit statement of Rambam, we have the next best thing; his son, Rabbenu Avraham. In a letter to his brother-in-law(2) he writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Indeed we are in great danger I cannot relate to you [even] the fewest details, for I can imagine what your great consternation would be upon hearing them. Thus have I seen fit to omit them and to mention to you naught thereof. May our master not leave off praying for us, “since a captive cannot free himself” (Berakhot 5b). (Trans. Paul Fenton).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see that Rabbenu Avraham himself requested that his brother-in-law pray for him. Thus he evidently holds that asking a human being to intercede on one’s behalf is permitted.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(1) It should be noted that it is possible that Rambam et al. could conceivably disagree with some of his proofs. For example, in the episode in Kings (v. 28; the cited verse seems to be a misprint) the Shunamite woman never explicitly asks Elisha to intercede with God. Rather, she merely says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say: Do not deceive me?' (Trans. Mekhon Mamre).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(2) Paul Fenton’s <em>A Judeo-Arabic Commentary on the Haftarot by Hanan’el ben Semu’el (?), Abraham Maimonides’ Father-in-Law</em> Appendix 1, p. 52 in Maimonidean Studies (ed.

This could lead to possible financial damage, and other forms of reputation damage, as well depending on how the girl and / or her parents, neighbors, etc. decide to retaliate.</p>\n\n<p>Often, there is hidden enmity after a broken shidduch. Usually, that fades with time. However, if the shidduch-breaker recontacts, that enmity may be revived, and people involved may speak lashon hara. While this is their prohibition, there is a rule that you should not place yourself in a harmful situation, physically or emotionally, when there is a way to avoid it.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot speak lashon hara about yourself directly or even give permission to others to speak lashon hara about you. Here, you are <strong>not</strong> giving permission to others to speak lashon hara about you, which seems worse, because by re-appearing in the picture, you may be causing it to occur, when you might have avoided it.

That's in addition to the angle of avoiding situations that may cause yourself harm, when that's possible. (E.g.- Why would you go to a \"hatefest\" about you if you weren't invited?)</p>\n\n\n",

(Though grammatically the term would technically be \"<em>tzadeket</em>\" since that is the feminine form of the word.) All the matriarchs and heroines of scripture and Rabbinic writings are traditionally considered \"<em>tzadikim</em>\". In fact, the first <em>mishna</em> in <em>Perek Chelek</em> of Tractate <em>Sanhedrin</em> invokes the verse (Isaiah 60:21) \"Thy people also shall be all righteous (<em>tzadikkim</em>), they shall inherit the land for ever; the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, wherein I glory.\" to indicate that \"All Israel has a share in the world to come...\" (whether male or female). Non-Jews who accept and are careful to keep the 7 Noachide commandments are also considered righteous and merit a share in the World to Come, again without regard to gender (and, in fact, are even called \"<em>hassid</em>\" [pious]; see, e.g. Maimonides' Mishna Torah The Laws of Kings 8:11).</p>\n\n\n",

So in principle, there is a specific halakhah assigned already to this case. The doubt is in what that halakhah is. In this situation, we do not invoke rules like rov (majority), and every doubt is treated identically to an equal one.</p>\n\n<p>The case of kol deparish is one where the reality was never established; this item never before stood out from the rest of the set. Therefore, we are assigning a halakhah to a case where the physical reality is in doubt. Here, majority is allowed.</p>\n\n<p>Tosafos (Zivachim 72b, “Ela amar Rava”) write “qavuah only applies to a thing that is known”.  Rabbi Aqiva Eiger explains that the piece of meat bought from the known store had an established halakhah. The buyer knew the state of the meat. We therefore call the halakhah “qavu’ah” — established. However, now it got mixed up, and we don’t know what that halakhah is.  The doubt is in the halakhah.</p>\n\n<p>However, if the meat is simply found, then the uncertainty begins one step earlier. We don’t know the state of the meat. The doubt is in the reality, what part of the set this item was parish — separated from.</p>\n\n<p>I suggested a theory as to why this was true, based on first principles.</p>\n\n<p>The Chinukh repeatedly explains various mitzvos by explaining “ha’adam nif’al lefi pe’ulaso — a person is affected according to his action.” Contemporary hashkafos differ over what halachic life is supposed to cause, whether the ideal is better described as “wholeness”, perfecting the image of G-d, or “attachment” to G-d…. But notice that both agree in describing the role of halakhah in terms of the change is causes on the self — whether perfecting him in a mussar sense, refining him in a Hirschian sense, bringing him experientially in a relationship with the A-lmighty, as Chassidim do, etc…</p>\n\n<p>One thing this implies is that halakhah need not be concerned with determining an objective reality. Rather, it has to deal with that which has impact on the person — the world as it’s experienced. Perhaps this is why the realia to which we apply halakhah is called metzi’us, literally “what is found”, and substantive elements of the metzi’us are said to have mamashus, they can “be felt”.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, if we do not know the reality, the metzi'us / mamashus is the resulting doubt. And thus, it makes sense that pesaq takes into account likelihood, as that is reflected in my doubt. But if we experienced reality, then halakhah was already established by that reality. And then it's not a matter of doubt, it's a matter of whether we are obligated to \"play safe\".</p>\n\n<p>(I have what is likely a sefer's worth of material on the interplay of this phenomenology approach to metzi'us and halakhah at <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/asp/category/phenomenology\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.aishdas.org/asp/category/phenomenology</a> .

We have no element to help us to decipher the photo.</p>\n\n<p>If the cookie was already out of the packages when we see the mouse, we have not to decipher the same question. The question is from which package comes the cookie.  The global existence of the set of package is questioned.

There is no problem of kavua meyikar hadin because the halachic question emerged afterwards.

When we ask an halachic question, we analyze the last step that generates our question. This is not an inquiry because we are not inquiring. So, we see the packages as a set, their are mixed from our point of view. If the cookie came here in one action, we ask about this action. The packages are not mixed.  Note that mixture is a view of the spirit. To see pieces as mixed we need a degree of abstraction. To see packages as a whole mixture is an abstraction. This is possible when the senses are not grasping the objects separately. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Professor Moshe Koppel has written and lectured interestingly on this subject.

He was an idolater so debased in his paganism that I Kings 21:25 says: \"There was none like Ach'av who gave himself over to the performance of wickedness in the eyes of God.\" And yet when his merits and sins were weighed in the presence of the Lord of spirits, there was no sin that warranted his destruction and was not counterbalanced by a positive quality, except the blood of Navot.</p>\n<p>Thus, it is written Ibid. 22:21, in the description of the prophecy of Ach'av's death in battle: \"And the spirit came and stood before God.\" Our Sages commented:: \"This is the spirit of Navot.\" And God told the spirit (Ibid.:2): \"You will persuade him and prevail.\"</p>\n<p>Now this wicked man Ach'av did not actually kill his victim with his own hands; he merely brought about his death. How much more so this condemnation should apply when a person kills another with his own hands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can you schedule elective surgery for Motza'ei Shabbat, even if a 24-hour fast is required beforehand?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Some operations require fasting an entire day. I understand that one is not allowed to fast on Shabbat (except on Yom Kippur.)</p>\n\n<p>The scenario:</p>\n\n<p>Let's say a patient needs has had knee osteoarthritis. It is not painful, but the patient can't walk easily. He goes to the doctor just before Shabbat, and the doctor has recommended surgery. The doctor recommends doing it on Sat. night since he is in the hospital anyway on Saturday, and his schedule is filled for a few weeks afterwards, and he doesn't want to wait until the next available slot, which is a long time away. The patient's situation is <strong>not</strong> life threatening, and his condition is not painful, nor would things deteriorate if he waited until the next available slot which is on a Wednesday 2 month's later. However, the doctor recommends things be done the next day, as he doesn't want the patient to feel uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the operation, he must fast 24 hours -no food, no water or anything whatsoever. Shabbat starts at 5 PM, is over next day 6:15, operation is at 6:30 (patient lives a few minutes from the hospital.) OK, so he is supposed to start fasting from 6:30 PM Fri. night. Technically, he would be able to eat something at the start of Shabbat, except for one thing. The doctor says that he must immediately take some strong med upon leaving his office. He takes it, on the way home from the appointment, he feels nauseous and can't eat anything. 6:30 PM Fri. night arrives, so he must begin fasting.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing that he must fast all day on Shabbat, but based on what the patient and doctor deem to be better treatment, can he still schedule the procedure on Motzaei Shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>R' Elazar said in the name of R' Yossi Ben Zimra:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>\"Whoever engages in fasting on the Sabbath, they rip up on his behalf (even) a decree of 70 years of evil. But even so, they return and exact punishment from him for (neglecting) the law of enjoying the Sabbath.\" What should he do to fix this? Rav Nachman Bar Yitzchak said: \"Let him fast again for (the sin) of the (first) fast.\" (Brachos, 31b ,near the bottom)</p>\n\n<p>Although in general we pasken that one is not allowed to fast on Shabbos, and most Rishonim and Poskim equate this Gemara with two similar passages (see Shabbos 11a and Taanis 12b which specifically talks about fasting on Shabbos for a bad dream only), there is still basis to allow your fast before the operation in your situation.</p>\n\n<p>The basic source to follow up on, besides the Gemara, is Tur/and Shulchan Aruch 288 with commentaries. It does seem pretty clear that people, especially nowadays, should not fast on Shabbos (some Poskim even say we should no longer fast for a bad dream at all). (However, by reading all comments you get the feeling that small exceptions linger; like fasting on Shabbos Rosh HaShannah for instance according to some.)</p>\n\n<p>Our Gemara above, does not mention a fast for a bad dream. It seems on its face to say that anyone who decides to fast on Shabbos (dream or no dream) benefits (and loses). Rashi here says that the fact someone is suffering by losing all pleasure when everyone around him is rejoicing helps annul the decree. Rashi does not mention that a dream is involved at all.</p>\n\n<p>I think the Ritva, also seems to hold this Gemara is not focused on a bad dream. Rather, it is the fact that a person decides to be so serious with himself and his low spiritual state, that he wants to genuinely take off a Sabbath (when everyone else takes it easy) and focus on returning to Hashem and His service wholeheartedly. Such a man truly desrves help to reach a higher spiritual level and is granted the gift of having any strong evil decree ripped up.</p>\n\n<p>Even according to most Poskim, who say it is only a bad dream that one may fast over on Shabbos, you can still fast for the operation based on their principle. The reason one is allowed to fast for a bad dream on Shabbos, is because the fast will help him repent quickly, and thereby atone and cancel the ill dream's decree. Therefore, the act of fasting is actually counted as ENJOYING Shabbos, because it relieves anxiety! (see Rashba and others)</p>\n\n<p>So follow my logic please. You can take the deteriorating situation with the leg as a message from heaven. If after introspection, it spurs you on to decide to utilize that Sabbath for prayer and learning in repentance, you have halachic basis to do so if you look forward to enjoying a raised spiritual level.</p>\n\n<p>In combination, it is obvious that guaranteeing your doctor will be there now (who knows for sure if he will be back in two months right?) and guaranteeing the problem (although not immediately painful and life threatening) will not surprise you or get worse in two months (doctors' diagnoses are not infallible right?) is certainly a legitimate halchic concern.</p>\n\n<p>In further combination, we have the Gemara in Shabbos 151b, see also Yoma 85b) R. Shimon ben Gamliel said, \"We violate Shabbos for a one day old baby. The Torah said to violate one Shabbos for him so that he may observe many Shabbasos.\"</p>\n\n<p>By that logic, we can say that you should avoid one enjoyment of one Shabbos by fasting, so you can relieve the discomfort of spending 8 or more Shabosos with a bad leg.</p>\n\n<p>(The Orh HaChayim also brings the opinion of the Ma'abit, who says that fasting on Shabbos is really only prohibited for 24 hours straight (sundown to sundown). So if you can break it in any way on Shabbos, you have technically not violated the prohibition of fasting on Shabbos. However, although a Taanis Cholom (for a bad dream) is only from morning to night, I am not sure if our interpretation of our Gemara in brachos 31b is for only half a day as well. It sounds like it is the whole day (24hrs) so breaking it would be counterproductive anyway?)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you had recently fasted on Yom Kippur, and your Shabbos is a few days later, you might think that it is silly to fast based on personal repentance ala 31b, because you already reached the pinnacle of spirituality a few days ago!?</p>\n\n<p>I remember a story from Yeshiva many years ago about R' Saadia Gaon. He was staying by a house as a guest, but the host was not informed about who he was hosting. When the host found out he begged the Rav forgiveness for not treating him better. Rav Saadia protested that he was treated very well! The host said, but if I knew who you really really were...I would have realized to treat you even better!</p>\n\n<p>Rav Saadiah cried and said...Hashem, yesterday I thought I knew who You were, but today I became aware of how much greater you really are! How much teshuvah I must do to make up for my neglect yesterday in honoring You as my Creator!</p>\n\n<p>So you can even achieve greater repentance and rip up decrees even a few days after Yom Kippur too.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you do it, you should fast again on a later date for missing Shabbos enjoyment, (I believe 288 shows that the make-up is from sun-up to sundown only)and you should be humble and try to not let anyone know, if possible.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps, :)</p>\n\n\n",

Besides classes, many have sports, art, or other activities.</p>\n\n<p>Volunteering on a Jewish project is another way. My neighborhood has a <em>Tomchei Shabbat</em> which is a group that distributes food packages on Thursday nights to needy people so that they have food for Shabbat. They always need drivers, packers, arrangers, etc. and it is run by a large group of Jewish volunteers. See if your neighborhood has some type of organization like this where you can volunteer.

As frum jews, our lives are so caught up with raising our large families, working to support them, and trying to fit anything else into the limited time in between those. So spending time with friends is for the most part reserved for Shabbos when the hustle and bustle of life comes to a halt.</p>\n\n<p>We are not anti-social, just usually too busy busy busy to have time for hanging out with friends.

Regardless, even for a typical <em>nazir</em>, the prohibition on becoming impure is solely with regard to the impurity of deceased humans, not animal remains.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><strong>Rambam</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Nazariteship.3.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Nazirus 3:13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Samson was not a nazirite in a complete sense, for he never took a nazirite vow.It was merely that the angel caused him to be separated from impurity.</p>\n<p>What were the laws applying to him? He was forbidden to drink wine and cut his hair. He was, however, permitted to incur impurity due to contact with the dead. This concept is a halachah transmitted by the Oral Tradition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><strong>Touching a carcass of an animal</strong> although it may render a Nozir impure <strong>is permitted and would not render his nezirus invalid</strong> source is Pesachim 80b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>טומאת</strong> התהום ד<strong>שרץ</strong> ובמאי עסקינן אי נימא בבעלים ובמאן <strong>אי בנזיר מי מהני ביה (במדבר ו),  כי ימות מת עליו אמר רחמנא</strong><br>\n   - is unknown <strong><em>Tuma</em> (impurity) of touching a <em>sheretz</em> (or a <em>neveila</em>) in a case of Nazir forbiddon? Surely not Because it state \"if a dead <em>man</em> dies with him\"</strong>  (Bamidbar 6,9) i.e only a dead man invalidates his nezirus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your second question about killing the philistines with the jawbone of the animal the gemoro nazir 4b adresses your question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומנלן דאיטמי למתים אילימא מדכתיב (שופטים טו,טז) בלחי החמור הכיתי אלף איש דילמא גרויי גרי בהו ולא נגע בהו<br>\n   And from where do we derive that Samson became impure from corpses? If we say it is from the fact that it is written: “And Samson said: With the jawbone of an ass, I smote a thousand men” (Judges 15:16), perhaps he thrust the jawbone at them but did not touch them, and he remained pure.</p>\n  \n  <p>אלא מהכא (שופטים יד, יט) ויך מהם שלשים איש ויקח את חליצותם דילמא אשלחינון ברישא והדר קטלינן ויך ויקח כתיב<br>\n  Rather, it is derived from here: “And he smote thirty men of them, and took their garments” (Judges 14:19). Since he stripped the clothes off the dead he must have come into contact with them. The Gemara counters: Perhaps he stripped them first and afterward killed them. The Gemara responds: It is written: “And he smote…and took,” in that order, indicating that first he killed them and then he took their clothing.</p>\n  \n  <p>ודילמא גוססין שוינן אלא גמרא גמירי לה<br>\n   But perhaps he mortally wounded them and thereby caused them to be in the process of dying, and he then took their clothes before they died so that he would not touch their corpses. Rather, it must be concluded that it is learned as a tradition that Samson wa allowed become impure from corpses even though there is no proof from scripture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see there is no proof Shimshon violated any form of nezirus but at the same time oral tradition dictates that his special Nezirus called \"nazir Shimshon\" would be permitted to come in contact with dead bodies and only prohibited to cut his hair or drink wine (or eat grapes)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What do the different terms for \"judges\" indicate?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a few places in the chumash, the word \"elohim\" is translated as \"judges\". Rashi does this on <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01424_part_1.html#HtmpReportNum0005_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereishit</a> 6:2 and many meforshim do this on the uses in Shemot (such as in 22:7 and 8) saying that the word means either \"judges\" or \"court\".</p>\n\n<p>On 21:6, Rashi again explains the word as \"beit din\" and the Ibn Ezra expands on this saying that the judges establish Hashem's law on earth [note that the Abarbenel sees the word as referring to a place, not the people at the place: see <a href=\"http://www.etzion.org.il/vbm/archive/18-jeru/19kley%20hamishkan3.doc\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, second page]. The <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01425_part_6.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ramban</a> on 21:6 says that the word refers to the beit din because it hints to Hashem's presence with the judges when the settle a dispute (\"לרמוז כי האלהים יהיה עמהם בדבר המשפט\"). <a href=\"http://pages.ramaz.org/schiowitz/parents/Talmud%20Sanhedrin%20Classes/101-Three%20Judges.ppt\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> PowerPoint (slides 4-5) brings up the explanations.</p>\n\n<p>This is fine except that in many cases, judges are NOT called elohim! Parshat Shoftim includes discussions of judges and they are simply called shoftim. A single judge is called a shofet (as in Devarim 17:9 \"וּבָאתָ, אֶל-הַכֹּהֲנִים הַלְוִיִּם, וְאֶל-הַשֹּׁפֵט\").</p>\n\n<p>Why wouldn't the judges in these cases be called elohim also? Are there different types of judges, and only some of them represent Hashem, or have His presence among them when they judge? Is a judge an elohim only in certain types of cases?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In his commentary on the first instance of the word \"Elohim\" in the Torah, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 1.1</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Samson Raphael Hirsch</a>, keying off of the similar word אלה (\"these\"), says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... the name of God אלוה could designate the One Whose might and will encompasses all these objects together in unity. The One through Whom all the plurality, by everything being related to Him, becomes one union, one whole, one world. Hence אלוה really means: The One Who is ruler, director, law-giver, judge of the world, מדת הדין. <strong>Hence the human rulers, directors, law-givers, judges of people of the little human world are also called אלהים.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(emphasis mine)</p>\n\n<p>So, according to R' Hirsch, the use of this term to mean \"judges\" refers to them in a lofty, nearly all-powerful sense, as not just judges but supreme rulers.</p>\n\n<p>Commenting on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exods.21.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 21:6</a>, R' Hirsch refers back to his definition of \"Elohim\"-judges in Genesis and specifies that the judges referred to in this context (renewal of an Israelite servant's term of servitude) must be not just any judges, but judges with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Sanhedrin_and_the_Penalties_within_their_Jurisdiction.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">classical <em>semicha</em>-ordination</a> from a chain of ordination stretching all the way back to Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n\n<p>In his extended commentary on this section on Israelite servitude, R' Hirsch points out that \"<em>This is the one and only case</em> in which the Torah orders a deprivation of freedom as punishment ...\" (emphasis his) and goes on to discuss how very grave this treatment is, given how \"personal freedom is regarded by [the Torah] so much as a holy treasure.\" He doesn't say so, but I'd suggest that given the gravity of this type of judgement, the Torah requires specifically judges who are specially qualified to impose control over people's lives.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.22.7-8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 22:7-8</a>, the judicial activity is once again especially grave, in a different way. Here, the judges are requiring an accused thief to swear to his innocence. The Torah refers to the accused as \"בעל הבית\" - \"the owner of the house,\" and R' Hirsch interprets this requirement to swear as a requirement that he stake his whole self and all of his possessions on the truth of his words, so help him God. Here, too, the judges are exerting a type of total control.</p>\n\n<p>I infer that were less grave words for \"judge\" are used, the Torah either doesn't require judges who are qualified by ordination for such total authority, or it doesn't need to emphasize that aspect in that context. The \"Shofetim\" introduced at the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.16.18-17.13?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">beginning of the Parashat Shofetim</a> are general-purpose judges who reside throughout Israel and judge routine cases, so it makes sense that they don't, as a body, need to ascribe to the authority that \"Elohim\"-judges bear.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is שכרות in the Talmud (or other rabbinical sources) limited to alcoholic substances?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In many places in the Talmud the word \"שכרות\" is used (Shabbat 10, Beitzah 4, etc.) in these places is it proper to understand it as referring to alcoholic beverages (the simple/common translation?), or would it include other substances as well (i.e. marijuana, cocaine, etc. etc.)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To the very best of my knowledge, any discussion concerning <em>what was commonly done</em> in Talmudic times (e.g. \"in the late afternoon people are often drunk\") meant simply alcoholic beverages. We know that people drank a lot back then; we have no indication of use of any other conscious-altering substances.</p>\n\n<p>If you're asking about the <em>halachic implication</em> of altered consciousness due to some substance other than alcohol (let's assume in a situation where the person was allowed to take such a substance), generally speaking there are a small handful of laws pertaining only to <em>fermented grape products</em>; otherwise, we say the underlying point is the state of altered consciousness, regardless of its pharmacological source.</p>\n\n<p>The strange case of the wayward and rebellious son, for instance, has dozens of obscure technicalities; <a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 70b</a> adds that he may only be executed if he got \"drunk\" on grape products, not something like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen-tailed_treeshrew\" rel=\"nofollow\">an alcoholic date product</a>. Similarly, <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/8301.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Bias Mikdash Ch. 1</a> says that death penalty for a Kohen who works in the Temple drunk was limited to \"drunk on grape products.\"</p>\n\n<p><em>However</em>, Rambam continues that a Kohen who is drunk on <em>anything</em> else should not be in the Temple, and may be given lashes for doing so; similarly a rabbi should not rule on matters of Jewish law \"while his mind is somewhat mixed-up, even from something like [fermented] dates or milk\"  אסור לכל אדם בין כוהן בין ישראל להורות כשהוא שתוי; אפילו אכל תמרים או שתה חלב, ונשתבשה דעתו מעט--אל יורה,</p>\n\n<p>Similarly we know that if someone should not pray if he is \"drunk enough that he couldn't stand in a king's presence\" -- the point here is the state of mind. It follows pretty easily that you could substitute \"high\" for drunk and the same would apply.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna discusses the man who is delirious with <em>kordaikos</em> and asks to divorce his wife; we do our best to determine whether he's in his right mind. How did he get <em>kordaikos</em>? One translation is just way, way too much alcohol; another is \"improperly-fermented wine\" -- most likely some sort of fungal mold that grew on it, which can have all sorts of neurological effects. Halachically it's all the same point: how \"with-it\" is this person now?</p>\n\n\n",

Preferably a bedika cloth is checked by the light of the sun ('white light'). I've have been to some Rabbanim who rely on an electrical white light source as well as direct sunlight, to check a bedika cloth.</p>\n\n<p>Would it therefore be possible (under the correct photography conditions) to standardise photography settings such that one can take a 'white-light-equivalent' photograph to be sent to a Rav via digital media such as email, SMS, Whatsapp, etc.</p>\n\n<p>To probe further... if the conditions are agreed upon, can a computer program be used to determine whether a bedika cloth is tahor or tamei?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>\"White light\" is a very tricky term. Rabbi Dovid Miller advises a combination of fluorescent and incandescent lights to get the right artificial color balance that will approximate sunlight.</p>\n\n<p>Digital color-matching is known to be non-trivial; involving getting something photographed under the right light, captured properly, and then displayed properly on the other end. Graphics professionals spend a whole lot of money on computer monitors that a are more color-true than what the ordinary consumer needs.</p>\n\n<p>So I really don't see the current technology making this doable in any cost-effective way.</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, though, some colors will be \"yes\", some colors will be \"no\", and some colors will be \"judgment call.\" From what I understand, most yoatzot halacha, for instance, can check for obvious yes or nos, but will then refer to a <em>posek</em> for anything else. So a computer could at best serve as a triage tool for human experts (many of whom prefer to see as many as possible, so they can train the next generation).</p>\n\n<p>In short, it's not really practical today.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here is a <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-real-primary-colours\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">great article</a> on why the color spectrum represented by monitors or printers is simply not an accurate reflection of the true color spectrum, and that \"primary-colors\" based system, whether the RBG of monitors or the CMYB of printers, cannot actually replicate real life.

The basic issue described in the article is that although the eye (in most people) has three color receptors for red, green and blue, there is no specific wavelength on the light spectrum that can activate one and only one of these receptors, rather it interacts with all of them to varying degrees.</p>\n\n<p>Two paints that appear to be the same color can, when combined, produce a new, different color, because each material produces different wavelengths that each activate the color receptors to about the same degree.</p>\n\n<p>So until we can digitally capture the full light spectrum and replicate it with high fidelity, this is simply not a feasible technology for examining bedika cloths.</p>\n\n\n",

Moshe was born of flesh and blood by a mother and father just like everyone else. So it will be with Moshiach. At the beginning of his life he doesn't even know himself who he is. Through leading a righteous life he will gain greater and greater merit until, like Moshe, he will merit to the perfection of his nefesh, ruach and neshamah.</p>\n\n<p>For Moshe this was completing the tikkun of Hevel (הבל) and Sheth (שת). This was indicated in the written Torah by the burning bush (הלבת אש מתוך הסנה). The burning fire is the letters from the names of Hevel and Sheth. At this point, like Moshe, he will know that he is the actual Redeemer. But most of the Jewish people will not know or recognize this.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Vital goes to explain that, like Moshe, after telling the Jewish people that the time of the redemption has come Moshiach will go into hiding, both body and soul. It equates this time period with when Moshe entered the cloud to receive the Torah. It says Moshiach will actually depart this world physically. And when he returns only then will he be revealed completely and all Israel will discern and recognize him.</p>\n\n<p>This is recorded in Sefer Ohr HaChamah, Volume 2, 8b on the Zohar, Shemot 7b. Sefer Ohr HaChamah is the second book of the master commentary on the Zohar called Sefer Kiryat Arba. It was compiled by Rabbi Avraham Azulai, the author of Chesed l'Avraham and the grandfather of the Chida, Rabbi Chaim Yosef David Azulai.</p>\n\n\n",

But if this isn't achieved within a certain span of years (I can't recall the numerical value), Moshiach will arrive through supernatural means. Is there any validity to this?\nEDIT: I have altered references of HaOlam Haba to allude the different concept of the Messianic age.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The nuts-and-bolts sources of Jewish law sound like the Third Temple will be built by humans using entirely natural means, when it becomes clear that it is the right time to do so. And the prevalent opinion in the Talmud (which is also codified by Maimonides) is that the Messianic era will have the physical world working exactly the way it does now.</p>\n\n<p>There are colorful midrashim, however, that talk about things like the pre-built Temple descending in a ball of fire. One could argue that those are intended metaphorically -- it will happen so suddenly, it's as if it came down from Heaven ready-made. (Similarly the Talmud states that \"in the future, fine cakes and linens shall emerge right out of the earth of Israel.\" One children's publication drew cakes and clothing growing on trees, with the caption \"this is what will happen when Mashiach comes.\" Maimonides in fact gives this specific example in his introduction to chapter Chelek of Sanhedrin -- it's an allegory to describe that the land of Israel would become a place with incredible economic production -- something that I believe we have lived to experience. The Talmud only said \"in the future\", not \"when Mashiach comes.\")</p>\n\n<p>But Rabbi Chaim Kanievski and others suggest that there are both natural and supernatural options for the emergence of the Third Temple. Isaiah states that <em>b'itaH achishena</em>, \"I shall rush it in its right time\", and we are told that means that if we are worthy it will be rushed; if not, it will come in its right time no matter what. Some suggest that if we merit it, it will arrive supernaturally; if not, we'll have to do it ourselves. Others reverse that thinking -- if we merit it, we get to do it ourselves. If instead the clock runs out, then G-d effectively says \"I'm doing this for Me even though you don't deserve it\", and boom, it miraculously appears.</p>\n\n\n",

He laughed because even though everybody saw the bad side, he understood that because of this the Third Temple should come.\nSo why in times of Tisha B'Av we cry? Shouldn't we see the good side even in the worst of tragedies like Rabbi Akiva did?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Interesting question. However I think before asking that we must ask ouselves if  we cry that there is a question whether we should laugh instead? We are so deep into this galus that the few things we do to try to remember the beis hamikdash are so hard for us to keep and the one day a year we spend on trying to tear at least a drop, to many is so hard to relate to. Rabbi Akiva didn't have to force his laugh just as the other tanaim didn't have to force their cries. Those were real emotions. The tanaim who saw the destruction genuinely cried as they felt Hashem 's pain and realized klal yisroel 's errors. Rabbi Akiva saw the other aspect and laughed out of rejoice of the emes of or Torah and neviim and that although sometimes we as individuals or as a nation fall, ultimately we are bonim la'makom and will always be loved by Hashem and will ultimately be able to become closer to Him than we could imagine by Binyan bais shlishi  (the rebuilding of the third temple ). It is not a question of whether we should force a cry or force a laugh, it is a challange to 1. Understand the two emotions and then 2. Depending on our level channel it based on our perspective. However if we cannot come to cry from seeing and feeling and internalizing the destruction of the beis hamikdash then we are already a step behind rabbi akiva who first fully understood that and only then followed it by, \"if the beis hamikdash was destroyed then certainly another will in the future come to be rebuilt!\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why do tefillot dealing with repentance frequently contain verses about our oppressors?",
    "content": "# Why do tefillot dealing with repentance frequently contain verses about our oppressors?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Throughout the year, and especially during this time of year as we approach Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, we say many different types of tefillot in repentance. This list includes the daily tachnun, slichot, and the entire davening of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Much of the text deals with the teshuva process, i.e. admitting that we have sinned, feeling sorry for it and making an effort not to try to continue in our ways, and begging the All Merciful God to forgive us and have mercy on us. </p>\n\n<p>However, inevitably these tefillot also contain sections dealing with our oppressors, how they make our lives terrible, and asking God to destroy them. One short example from tachnun is: .עָשְׁשָׁה מִכַּעַס עֵינִי עָתְקָה בְּכָל צוֹרְרָי. סוּרוּ מִמֶּנִּי כָּל פֹּעֲלֵי אָוֶן כִּי שָׁמַע יְהֹוָה קוֹל בִּכְיִי - My eye is dimmed from anger, it has aged because of my adversaries. Turn away from me, all you workers of iniquity, for the lord has hearkened to the voice of my weeping. (Excerpted from <a href=\"http://m.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16227#v=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) This seems to deviate from the teshuvot tefillot where we identify a sin, try to repent and ask for forgiveness. Furthermore, though we would always prefer not to be punished, there is a realization in Judaism that punishment is not for nothing. It's objective is to goad us into the right path. So, however much we hate it, is it not instrumental in helping us clean us of our sins? Why do we ask for it be removed so desperately, without any caveat, like: Please remove these punishments God, if it would be in our best interest. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Good question.  The quick answer is that the Jews have a good reason to be paranoid.  The more serious and deeper answer is related to the tochacha we just read last Shabat in Parashat Ki Tavo.</p>\n\n<p>All of the terrible things that happen to Am Yisrael by oppressors - things in the tochacha that came true during Churban Habayit and during the Shoah - are the direct result of 2 things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Not doing the mitzvot like Hashem commands us in the Torah</li>\n<li>Not doing them be'simcha.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So - the oppressors are the agents of the tochacha and we mention them in Kinot and Tachanum to brutally remind ourselves that the problem is within us - search within ourselves, do the mitzvot ve'simcha and maybe next year there will be a bit less suffering.</p>\n\n<p>HTH.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How are Sifrei Torah typically checked today?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Our shul has about 10 Sifrei Torah (no exaggeration) that are all passul. I am curious how complicated it would be to discover where the problems are.</p>\n\n<p>Someone told me that today, many <em>sofrim</em> (scribes) use computers to discover where errors are. Is this true? If so, how does the process work? Do they put the Torah scroll on a flat-bed scanner or do they wave a wand scanner and then compare each column with some standard? How would that work, since everyone's writing style is a bit different and also, the column starts are endings in each Torah may be different. (<strong>Note</strong>: for this answer, I am seeking a somewhat \"computer / technical\" answer, if possible. Is programming built into the system so that it is smart enough to recognize font nuances and compare it accurately with the computer's own font \"standard\"? Are there settings for, e.g. Sefardi writing styles?) Is it possible that the computer may declare an error when there really is none b/c it cannot recognize font nuances in good detail?</p>\n\n<p>If the process is done manually, how long does it take, typically for a <em>sofer</em> to inspect an entire Torah scroll? I would imagine that this is a very laborious process if one doesn't know where the mistake(s) is / are.</p>\n\n<p>Approx. what percentage of sofrim use a computer to assist them vs. completely manually inspecting?</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, what does it typically cost, in the U.S. to have a sofer inspect an entire Torah and repair it (assuming these are minor repairs such as correcting a letter here and there vs. replacing an entire parchment segment.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Computers are used quite effectively for checking for errors in STa\"M. Your understanding of how it works is basically correct. The scanned text is compared with a standard which is known to be kosher. The program would have a variety of \"standard\" versions for different writing styles and column formats. </p>\n\n<p>To correct for differences in handwriting, a tolerance for difference is built into the program. This can be set to a low value in order to tip the balance of error toward <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors\" rel=\"nofollow\">type I errors</a>. This technology is very reliable and has been around for a long time. Torah scrolls are even easier than usual handwriting because the font is so standardized. In general, you don't really have to worry about the tolerance being so high that mistakes would be missed. I imagine that the most common mistakes are entire missing letters/words or letters touching each other. An entire missing letter would easily be spotted and whether two letters touch each other is an objectively true or false question... exactly the kind of question that computers are good at answering.  (For Torah scrolls that are already \"in the wild,\" probably the incidence of scratched letters or holes in the parchment are more common than they are for brand new scrolls. Still, the program's tolerance is low enough that it should be able to detect such problems.)</p>\n\n<p>(Source: I am a software developer and generally familiar with the capabilities of computers.)</p>\n\n<p>After running the scroll through the program, the computer will spit out a list of what it thinks are problems with the scroll (even including things that don't make the Torah <em>pasul</em>, but rather simply less <em>mehudar</em>). The sofer will then look over this list and confirm the issues. If the tolerance for error is set to a very low level, there might be some \"issues\" that aren't really issues at all. The sofer can simply leave those alone and fix the real problems.</p>\n\n<p>As a word of advice, I know a rabbi who is a sofer. He advised me that I should <strong>never</strong> buy any <em>klaf</em> that has not been computer-checked. Computers don't get tired after a long day of staring at tiny font and miss the fact that whole words are missing. You don't want to be <em>batel</em> the <em>mitzvah</em> of wearing <em>tefillin</em> every single day because the sofer who checked them missed an issue.</p>\n\n\n",

It translates as The \"Man/G-d\". It is referring to a true prophet of G-d as explained in Sefer HaChinuch, Mitzvah 517, Shoftim.</p>\n\n<p>This is also how it is explained by Rabbi Meir Ibn Gabbai in Sefer Avodat HaKodesh, volume 2: Perek 5 in the name of the sage, Rabbi Yosef ben HaRav HaMekubal, Rabbi Shem Tov ben Shem Tov.</p>\n\n<p>The concept is developed further by the Magid of Mezeritch in his Likkutei Amarim, chapter 29 beginning with the words, \"Make for yourself two trumpets of silver...\" The Magid explains that the word \"trumpets\" (חצוצרות) is to be understood \"two halves\" (חצי צורות). That a true prophet is actually half man and half G-d.</p>\n\n<p>And this is in keeping with the words of the Sefer HaChinuch which explains such a person, the true prophet, is an actual agent of G-d, meaning \"shaliach\" as it is understood in Halacha. That means that the shaliach, the legal agent or representative actually represents the one who has empowered him. He speaks for him and acts with all his authority and power. When the shaliach obligates the one that empowered him, the one that empowered him is fully responsible to fulfill the commitments made by the shaliach.</p>\n\n<p>This idea is also brought by Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin in Sefer Nefesh HaChaim in relation to the idea that the Shechina spoke from the midst of Moshe's throat. See Nefesh HaChaim, Sha'ar 3, Perek 13 and Likutei Ma'amarim, Ma'amarim 14.</p>\n\n<p>In the same way, HaKadosh is the also one of the upper levels of prophecy as taught by Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair in Avodah Zara 20a beginning with the words, \"Torah brings one to watchfulness...\". The level just before \"Ruach HaKodesh\" is called \"Kedusha\". One who has attained this level is called \"HaKadosh\".</p>\n\n<p>This is also explained by Rabbeinu Bachai in his commentary to Devarim, parshat v'Zot HaBracha 33:8.</p>\n\n\n",

However,  there are some instances that one would only do 10 blasts as opposed to 30. Here are some I've found:</p>\n<p>If there's only one person who knows how to blow and someone has forbidden themselves to receive enjoyment from this person (mudar haanah) then they would only be able to hear the basic 10 blasts (Mishna Berura 586:22)</p>\n<p>If Rosh Hashanah fell on Friday and there was no Shofar available until after one was mekabel shabbos early but before shkia, in which case they'd blow only the basic 10 blasts (Mishna Berura 600:7)</p>\n<p>If one is in the hospital and the one blowing can't do 30 for each person, he'd be better off doing the basic 10 for more people than 30 for less people, or in any other emergency case where doing 30 proves impossible (R' Elyashiv in Ashrei Ish 3 16:29, and R' Nissim Karelitz in Chut Hashani Rosh Hashanah page 64)</p>\n<p>Additionally, if nobody knows how to blow except one person who knows how to blow one or 2 sets, then they would only blow those. However blowing just tekias is not allowed. (Shulchan Aruch 593)</p>\n<p>For the Mussaf blasts, actually the Rema himself in 592:1 quotes the minhag differently from what we do today and says to only blow 4 blasts after each bracha instead of 10. The Mishna Berura brings from the Shel\"a about the current custom.</p>\n<p>If someone had to leave after tekias before mussaf and didn't daven with the tzibbur for mussaf, or if he had to leave during chazaras hashatz, his responsibility to hear the tekios afterwards is discussed by the Chazon Ish 137:4 and Shu\"t Hissorerus Hateshuva 3:391, R' Shmuel Kamenetzky shlit\"a in Kovetz Hilchos Yomim Noraim 12:6 says that although according to the letter of the law one does not have to go back and listen afterwards to the missing ones, it's best to make it up if possible.</p>\n<p>As a final note, although the examples given in the original question are not directly addressed,  the general question if there are any instances where the sets as they are written in the machzor can be altered, seems to have a number of instances that indeed it could be done. Especially in emergency situations.</p>\n\n\n",

So, the question is why :22 and :23 are in that order in the <em>Tur</em>.</p>\n\n<p>When the <em>Tur</em> presents the laws in 61:16-22, it does so without explicitly citing sources, presumably indicating that either these laws were not matters of controversy to earlier authorities or that the author felt comfortable implicitly choosing sides if there were any such controversies.

This part doesn't just refer to Abraham but to Am Israel. \nIf this is the case, why do Ayin Hara (evil eye) affects us? Shouldn't it bounce back?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/Evil-Eye-Ayin-Hara.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ayin Hara</a> can be considered as the result of one's flaunting ones good fortune. It can also be considered as the result of an individual having is own judgment reconsidered.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Evil eye” is known as “ayin hara” in Judaism. It is a real force,\n  mentioned many times in the Talmud and Kabbalistic works (e.g. Talmud\n  Brachot 20a, 55b).</p>\n  \n  <p>The concept behind it is actually rather straightforward. If we flaunt\n  our blessings and draw undue attention to ourselves, it invokes the\n  jealous notice of others. Drawing such negative attention also draws\n  the notice of the Heavenly court. And it causes our judgment to be\n  revisited: Do we really deserve this blessing which has engendered the\n  ill-will of so many others?</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, in the eyes of Judaism, “evil eye” is not some spooky, nebulous\n  force which goes about attacking the unsuspecting. It is a logical\n  phenomenon – and for the most part, the result of our own indiscreet\n  behavior.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Talmud (Brachot 20b) does observe that one who does not covet what\n  others have is less susceptible to the evil eye himself. He himself\n  does not look askance at others’ blessings. As a result, the jealous\n  stares of others will not affect him. Likewise, Joseph, who refused\n  his master’s wife’s advances and did not covet that which was not his,\n  became immune to the effects of the evil eye – as did his descendants\n  for all time.</p>\n  \n  <p>Regardless, when things go wrong, our general approach is not to blame\n  it on invisible forces such as the evil eye – although of course we\n  should always be wary of flaunting our blessings. Rather, we should\n  take it as a sign from God to improve our ways. The Talmud writes that\n  when suffering is visited upon us we should examine our ways (Brachot\n  5a). When things go wrong, our first reaction should be to turn to God\n  and attempt to determine His message for us – as well as praying to\n  Him for illumination. Before blaming our problems on mysterious\n  forces, we look up to Heaven to help us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

For while we can't understand what\nexistance after death is like, being told there will be such existence can\nbe understood.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (Guide to the Perplexed III), and the Maharal (ibid) take this\nverse to mean that the reward for doing mitzvos is to persist beyond death,\nand the punishment is to cease to exist.</p>\n\n<p>This view is a minority view.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud states in Tractate Brachos 28b: When R Yochanan b Zakai became\nill... there are two paths before me, one leading to Gan Eden and the other\nto Gehennom [hell], and I do not know on which I will be taken, shouldn't I\nweep?</p>\n\n<p>We find similar mention of GE and Gehenom repeatedly in the Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>The terms \"Gan Eden\" and \"Gehenom\", though, can't be taken overly\nliterally. GE in this context is not the place with the tree of knowledge\nin Genesis 2 and 3. Similarly, Gei ben Hinnom is a valley outside of\nJerusalem (near the green line, in the middle of the modern city) where\nchildren were sacrificed to Molech (a Pagan G-d).</p>\n\n<p>Brachos 48b doesn't refer to two places in the afterlife, but only one --\nmuch like the verse addressed by the Rambam and Maharal. \"We found a source\nfor making a blessing on food, but where is [the source for] a blessing for\n[learning] Torah? R Yishmael says: It is learnt by kal vachomer (a\nfortiori). If a blessing is said for temporal life, for life in Olam Haba\n(the world to come) how much more so!\"</p>\n\n<p>Or, Megillah 28b: Anyone who reviews halachah daily is guaranteed to be a\nchild of the world to come.</p>\n\n<p>We even know \"where\" the WtC is, Koheles writes (12:7): The dust returns to\nthe dust that it was, but the soul returns to G-d who gave it. Or Job's\ndescription (19:26): And after my skin is destroyed, without my flesh, I\nwill see G-d.</p>\n\n<p>In order to resolve these two approaches we have to assume that either GE\nand Gehenom are two different parts of the WtC, or they are two different\ndescriptions of the same place.</p>\n\n<p>An idea I heard from R Aryeh Kaplan zt\"l that caught my fancy is that the\ntwo differ subjectively. (I believe it's also in the first volume of the RAK Reader.) To the good, the experience in WtC is pleasant, to\nthe evil, it is not so. Eden does literally mean \"pleasant\".</p>\n\n<p>The Valley of Hinom was a place where flesh was mortified. Compare this to\nYeshaia's description of hell (66:24): They shall go and look upon the\ncorpses of the men who rebelled against Me; for their worm will not die,\nnor will there fire be extinguished, and they shall be ashamed before all\nflesh.</p>\n\n<p>Yeshaia considered the fire of Gehenom to be shame. This is the conclusion\nof R. Kaplan, as well as Ikarim 4:33 and Nishmas Chaim 1:13. The source of\nshame is obvious, as the WtC is confronting G-d, with no hope of evasion.\nAny sin still embraced stands clearly before you. \"Whoever sins once\ncreates one accuser.\"</p>\n\n<p>One last thought: we didn't discuss rebirth after the world to come, or the\ngeneral Jewish attitude that almost no one is eternally damned.</p>\n\n\n",

I assume, therefore, if you eat apple seeds, you would say <em>shehakol</em> as the seeds are not considered \"edible\".</p>\n\n<p>With pomegranates, there is a hard pith, and the seeds, themselves are what people eat. Are the seeds, therefore, considered the \"fruit\" with regard to the bracha? Many stores sell boxes of just the seeds outside of the pomegranate, itself. Would you say \"ha'etz\" on just eating these seeds?</p>\n\n<p>If yes, then why wouldn't you say \"ha'etz\" when eating apple seeds?</p>\n\n<p>Or, is the entire bracha rule based on what it is common for people to eat in your area. I.e. - if people commonly ate apple seeds, you would need to say \"ha'etz\" also?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The bracha we make on seeds would follow what is sweet and pleasant to the palate like it says in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14164&st=&pgnum=196&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna Berura (202; 23)</a>. He says that if you desire the seed like the fruit you make a ha'etz on it, then he goes on to say that many argue on this and hold being that it's not really part of the fruit, and therefore should only be a ha'adama; and in M\"B (202; 25) he rules at the end that this is what we follow. He also points out if one made a ha'etz it is fine after the fact. Then he says that if one ate the seed after eating the fruit according to everyone it doesn't need a new bracha, because it's included in the bracha of the fruit.</p>\n\n<p>It is also stated by the <a href=\"//meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/1693\" rel=\"nofollow\">mechaber</a> in Shulchan Aruch (202; 3) that if the seeds are bitter we don't make any bracha and only if they're sweetened through fire or the like do we make a shehakol.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we have all the details lets look back at your question. What we eat of the pomegranate is not seeds, rather arils.

On the other hand, when it comes to pomegranates, you are eating the actual fruit and the seed just comes automatically with it (unless you spit out the small seed) so you make a bracha ha'etz.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/piskey/52/6.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Saifer birchas hanenenin of the baal hatanya chapter 6</a></p>\n<p>6.1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...\nובלבד שלא יהא מר או עפוץ (כלומר זויע\"ר) ביותר עד שאינו ראוי לאכילה אפילו על ידי הדחק שאז אין מברכין עליו כלל\n...</p>\n<p>only if it is not to bitter ...

    "content": "# Is there any minhag for a Kohen to dress like the Kohen Gadol on Yom Kippur?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>About 20 years ago, I was the <em>shaliach tzibbur</em> in a shul in Newburgh, NY on Yom Kippur. As I was davening, I hear behind me, \"jingle, jingle\". I turn around, and behold, there is a man dressed in a long white robe with gold trim, a \"breast plate\" with colored stones on it, and the bottom of the robe had \"pomegranates\" and bells. In other words, he was dressed like the Kohen Gadol!</p>\n\n<p>When he got the Kohen <em>aliyah</em>, I verified that he was a Kohen.</p>\n\n<p>I didn't have a chance to ask him why he was wearing his \"outfit\", as I didn't want to embarrass him. (some people were laughing at him, and he may have been conscious of that.) I'm curious if there is any minhag anywhere for a Kohen to dress this way on Yom Kippur, or was this guy just dressing this way on his own \"whim\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Vilna Gaon taught that Yom Kippur is called Yom Kippurim - a day \"like Purim\" (See <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/h/pur/t/dt/48949286.html\">http://www.aish.com/h/pur/t/dt/48949286.html</a>). Clearly Purim is at least as Holy of a day as Yom Kippur if not Holier because Yom Kippur is a day which is only \"like Purim\". Perhaps this person in shul misunderstood the Vilna Gaon to mean that one should dress up on Yom Kippur as one would on Purim.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot imagine otherwise as even the kohen gadol himself wore the bigdei kehuna for a minimum amount of time (see kiddushin 54a). Unless this person felt that this was a way for him to have proper kavanah and made a cheshbon that it wouldnt distract anyone else. </p>\n\n\n",

A child however may continue blowing and we call this Chinuch. The achronim \nI.e. the Taz mentioned in the Mishna Berurah,  address the fact that this chinuch of blowing outweighs whatever issue it is that underlies the shvus not to use the shofar.</p>\n\n<p>Here's my question. How is this Chinuch? Consider a child eating Matzah. How many kizaism will he eat before we say that is no longer Chinuch? The child in our case blew five hundred shofar blasts and those were all considered chinuch, are fifty kizeisim all chinuch too? I could give more examples along this line of thought, but I'm sure you got the point.</p>\n\n\n",

There is nothing stated about wearing a kosher mezuzah as a necklace, though, I could see some problems for even a Jew doing this, as it has G-d's name in it and could be treated improperly or disrespectfully.

In his responsa <em>Or Letzion</em>, (vol. 2, chapter 46, halakha 34), the Sephardic rabbi, Ben Tzion Abba Shaul (1924-1998), wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יותר מדוקדק לומר בורא פרי הגפן וכן בורא פרי העץ ובורא פרי האדמה\nכשהאות פ' של המילה פרי רפויה</p>\n<p>שכן אותיות בג״ד כפ״ת אחר אותיות אהו״י רפויות הן. ואין לומר שיש הפסק בורא לפרי, שהרי המילה בורא אין לה משמעות בפני עצמה, ועל כרחך שהמילה פרי נמשכת אחר המילה בורא, ואם היה זה פסוק בתורה, הטעמים היו מאריך טרחא סוף פסוק</p>\n<p>It is more accurate to say <em>borei <strong>f</strong>eri hagefen</em> and also <em>borei <strong>f</strong>eri ha-etz</em> and <em>borei <strong>f</strong>eri ha-adamah</em> with the letter <em>peh</em> of the word as a stress-less <em><strong>f</strong>eri</em>.</p>\n<p>This is because, grammatically, the letters <em>bet, gimmel, dalet, kaf, peh,</em> and <em>tav</em>, when following the\nletters <em>alef heh vav</em> and <em>yud</em> become stress-less. And it is not right\nto say that there is a pause between <em>borei</em> and <em>peri</em>, since\nthe word <em>borei</em> [the Creator of] doesn't have a meaning by itself,\nas it is necessary for the word <em>feri</em> [fruit] to continue after the\nword <em>borei</em> to make sense. And if it was a verse in the Torah, the cantillation\nwould be a <em>ma'arikh tarḥa sof pasuq</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It should be stated that the custom for many Sepharadim is to still say <em>peri</em> with a stressed <em>peh</em>. R. Ovadia (<em>Yabia Omer</em>, O.Ḥ. 9:22) specifically countered the position of <em>Or Letzion</em>, stating that, grammatically, there should be a stressed <em>peh</em> because there actually <em>is</em> a brief pause between the two words in the blessing. The grammatical rule applies to words joined by context. Among other proofs that he uses from Tanakh, he cites a very similar parallel in the vocalization of Gen. 1:11, where a <em>peh</em> follows a <em>heh</em> (which should normally make it stress-less):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עֹשֶׂ<strong>ה</strong> <strong>פְּ</strong>רִי לְמִינוֹ</p>\n<p>'ose<strong>h</strong> <strong>p</strong>eri le-mino</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, R. Ovadia goes on to say that the grammatical rule above is not so firm:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובכלל נראה שהכלל של אהו\"י הסמוכות לבג\"ד כפ\"ת שעושות אותן רפויות, אינו\nכלל החלטי, ופעמים רבות שדוחים כלל זה מפני סיבות אחרות מוצדקות</p>\n<p>In any case, it doesn't seem like the rule of the letters <em>alef heh vav</em> and <em>yud</em> in connection with the <em>bet gimmel dalet kaf peh</em> and <em>tav</em> to make the latter stress-less --is actually a decisive rule, as there are plenty of times when that rule is rejected for other justifiable reasons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Ovadia then proceeds to list various other occurrences when the rule is not followed (e.g., <em>m<strong>i</strong> <strong>kh</strong>amokhah ba-'elim Hashem, m<strong>i</strong> <strong>k</strong>amokha ne'edar ba-qodesh</em>) to dismantle the stringency of the grammatical rule.</p>\n\n\n",

This is not completely correct: rather, the sections are read in order, to a large extent irrespective of calendar date. (Not completely irrespective, but that's beyond our scope.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, there are more Saturdays in a leap year than in a non-leap year.

The mem verse (\"<em>mamlich m'lachim, vlo hamelucha</em>\" and \"<em>melech olam</em>\") is another example (<em>bet, gimel, dalet, zayin, tet</em> and <em>pey</em> also reuse words and concepts). The relationship allows one idea to complement the other. As the ArtScroll machzor writes, <em>hakol yachol</em> simply means that all is within the power of Hashem whereas the addition of \"<em>v'cholelam yachad</em>\" means that Hashem can also do it all at the same time. I would wonder why the two lines you cite are in the opposite order -- the specific then the general claim. But that's a separate question.</p>\n\n\n",

She reacted so strongly because the first time she miscarried. She may have thought that for Yitzchak to become the heir Yishmael too would have to die so that Yitzchak would be the eldest. That could be why she refused to respond the first time until the mal'ach spoke to her three separate times and had to be explicitly commanded by Hashem to see the well and give him the water.

The verse you ask about is <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0410.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 10:10</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּבְיוֹם שִׂמְחַתְכֶם וּבְמוֹעֲדֵיכֶם, וּבְרָאשֵׁי חָדְשֵׁיכֶם וּתְקַעְתֶּם בַּחֲצֹצְרֹת עַל עֹלֹתֵיכֶם וְעַל זִבְחֵי שַׁלְמֵיכֶם; וְהָיוּ לָכֶם לְזִכָּרוֹן לִפְנֵי אֱלֹהֵיכֶם אֲנִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵיכֶם.‏<br>\n  Also in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This verse not only doesn't mention the Shofar or Teruah, its verb of Tekia is specifically about a trumpet.</p>\n\n<p>Let's review some rules about the verses to use:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The minimum is 3 verses each of Torah, Tehillim and Neviim but one can add more.</li>\n<li>Ideally we should finish with a Torah verse, but if we didn't we still fulfill our obligation.</li>\n<li>A verse that uses the verb פקד as a Remembrance counts for that section.</li>\n<li>A verse that mentions <strong>just</strong> Teruah (\"תרועה שאין עמה לא כלום\") such as <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%9B%D7%98_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Num 29:1</a> counts as a Shofar-verse without the word \"Shofar\".</li>\n<li>A verse that mentions a Shofar theme and a Kingship theme can be used twice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The last three are the positions of R' Yose, though R' Yehuda disagrees. The law follows R' Yose, though at least in the first case the longstanding custom is to be strict to accommodate R' Yehuda's position.</p>\n\n<p>For your verse to count as the final Torah verse, we have to assume that 1) it's permissible to interrupt before the final verse with prayer sequences, 2) against R' Yehuda that a verse with no mention of Shofar counts, 3) a Tekia verb is as valid as a Teruah verb, and 4) a verse that explicitly is about trumpets counts as \"just Teruah\".</p>\n\n<p>Raavyah (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14535&st=&pgnum=230\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">536</a>) quotes some who reject 1, but he defends 1 and rejects 4. He explains that there is indeed no need to finish with a Torah verse if you already have at least 10 verses because you added to the others as \"we\" do. He writes this Torah verse was put at the end of the blessing because it fits with the content generally (like many, many other blessings which include content appropriate verses; a common example is the second blessing after bread). This seems to also be the position of the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20516&st=&pgnum=222\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaIttur</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some Rishonim felt you should indeed ideally add a Torah verse right at the end of the main verse section. Rabbenu Yonah and Ritz Giyat added Num 29:1 even though it doesn't have the word \"Shofar\" relying on the position of R' Yose against R' Yehuda. Ramban added <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%9B%D7%92_%D7%9B%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Num 23:21</a> which also doesn't have the word \"Shofar\" even though this was already used as a Kingship verse, relying on the position of R' Yose against R' Yehuda on two counts. Rashba (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1376&st=&pgnum=219\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:481</a>) quotes both these options.</p>\n\n<p>If we didn't want to rely on R' Yehuda, there are exactly four verses in the Torah that actually use the word \"Shofar\", three of which have already been used. Accordingly, we could use <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev 25:9</a>. Seemingly, this solution wasn't chosen because it feels odd to say on Rosh Hashana, though technically it should work and it indeed must have been used according to R' Yehuda. (Shibbolei Haleket (290) and Maaseh HaGeonim (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8899&st=&pgnum=57\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RH 3</a>) write that since there was no other Torah verse available, we are forced to use a non-Shofar verse in order to finish the Shofarot section with some Torah verse; however, this contradicts an explicit Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.32b.15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RH 32b</a>) that there are sufficient Remembrance and Shofar verses in the Torah.)</p>\n\n<p>Rosh (RH 4:3) accepted all 4 assumptions and defended counting Num 10:10 even after an interruption. He cites a Yerushalmi (that we don't seem to have) that explicitly mentions using this verse at the end of the Shofarot section as a way to mention Rosh Chodesh on Rosh Hashana, but the proof isn't ironclad because the verse, while clearly an old part of the blessing, could be there as Raavyah explained simply as appropriate content. Rambam and many others, by not including any other verse there in their Siddur, appear to have agreed to count the verse.

On the other hand, if you add an extra verse you still fulfill your obligation, so this is also a \"low risk\" sort of solution. Ask your rabbi what you should do.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The section of shofaros starts with \"Ata nigleysa\" \"You revealed yourself...\". The first verse used in the ten shofaros verses is a pasuk from Torah (Exodus 19:16) \"VaYehi bayom hashlishi...\" \"And it was on the third day...\". The tenth verse used is one from the Prophets (Zechariah 9:14) \"VaHashem aleyhem yeraeh...\" \"And G-d appeared unto them...\".</p>\n\n<p>The tenth verse mentions the shofar. \"...and G-d sounded with the shofar...\"</p>\n\n<p>The machzor then has the key words \"Elokeinu vEylokei avoseinu\" to indicate that the 10 verses are over and the chazzan is now continuing with a special request poem connected with shofar leading to the brachah of shofaros. Along the way, a pasuk from Torah (Numbers 10:10) is used to stress the poem's point, that we should all experience happiness on the holiday when we offer karbanos. This pasuk mentions trumpets but not shofar. That is because it is not one of the ten pasukim of shofaros.</p>\n\n<p>The 4th verse of shofaros mentions trumpets and shofar (Psalms 98:6)</p>\n\n<p>There is a connection to trumpets and shofar as both were combined in the Temple service (based on Psalms 98:6). See Mishnah Rosh HaShannah 3:3-4.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, our machzorim are not strict about the 10th verse being from Torah specifically (as opposed to Prophets or Writings).</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.  </p>\n\n<p>EDIT......</p>\n\n<p>Hi all, <strong>The above answer is wrong.</strong> I do not know protocol here for this so I would appreciate the help. Should it be deleted? etc.</p>\n\n<p>Here are my 3 basic mistakes:</p>\n\n<p>1) Numbers 10:10 is in fact the final Torah verse of shofaros. I was wrong to assume that since it looked like the 11th, that it was not part of the ten. The Psalm 150 is the addition. </p>\n\n<p>2) Double AA is correct. The key words Elokeinu VElokei avoseinu (although usually does introduce a new section in davening) does not preclude the 10th verse from being saved for that paragraph. He is right from the example that Zichronos does the same thing. The trick is that Malchiot does not allow its tenth verse in the Elokeinu VElokei avosenu paragraph.</p>\n\n<p>3) Our machzorim do in fact make sure that the tenth or final verse is from Torah (not Navi or Ketuvim).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks also to DanF and msh210 for notes that got me thinking along with Double AA.</p>\n\n<p>The real answer is that :</p>\n\n<p>1) The final verse of each set is meant to appear in the final brachah paragraph. The exception is malchiot; for a special reason.</p>\n\n<p>2) The Psalm 150 is included as an 11th verse in shofaros due to its midrashic value of being the source for learning that we need ten.</p>\n\n<p>3) The trumpets verse that the OP originally asked about (due to its lack of mention of the key word \"shofar\"), Numbers 10:10, is used anyway due to it being a major source drashah for the origin of the obligation of Malchiut, Zichronos, and Shofaros in the first place. Some say that Psalm 150 was added to make up for Numbers 10 lacking the word shofar.</p>\n\n<p>I did research this last night to find this all out. However, some of it is still unclear to me and I have not verified the sources yet, so I am just providing short notes above with my retraction.</p>\n\n<p>TY</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I can't believe that I missed an answer that was in the Gemarah all along, on the same page that I cited.</p>\n\n<p>Rosh Hashanah 32b</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תרועה שאין עמה לא כלום כגון (במדבר כט, א) יום תרועה יהיה לכם אומרה עם\n  השופרות דברי רבי יוסי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the word תרועה is mentioned in the citation without anything else [e.g. the word <em>shofar</em>] such as the verse</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>\"A day of <em>teruah</em> shall it be for you\" (Numbers 29:1),</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>should be said in the <em>Shofarot</em> section.

Biographies of Rabbis are very likely a form of learning Torah (granted, definitely a 'lighter learning' than say, a Daf Gemara), and depending on how the history of the Holocaust is written, it could also be considered learning as well.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, the entire discussion below pertains exclusively to an item which is a 'Dvar Mitzvah'. If the item itself isn't a Mitzvah item, 'implied permission' becomes a whole lot more restrictive.</p>\n\n<p>There is a general rule that a person by default wants his Mitzvah objects to be used. Therefore, you're allowed to borrow a person's Tallis or Tefillin without their permission (terms and conditions apply, like not removing it from the room, returning it how you found it, etc.). However, this 'implied permission' only applies if a) you're unable to ask the person easily ('easily' is a very subjective word), b) it's actually 'default' permission, i.e. if you knew the person wouldn't want others to use it, you can't use it, and c) the item isn't getting ruined.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to Seforim, the Mishna Berura writes that given the likelihood of books to rip during use, you can't use it without permission. However, it seems like the overwhelming majority of contemporary authorities disagree (for example, Rav Elyashiv as per The Daily Halacha Discussion) and are of the opinion that books do have 'implied permission' nowadays.</p>\n\n<p>To the best of my knowledge, there is no 'minimum time' set aside for 'implied permission' (and every moment of learning Torah is a great Mitzvah). There is an upper limit, however, i.e. you can't borrow a Sefer for weeks on end.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in your case, presumably the owner of the books is easily accessible (he's also in Shul with you, right?), and must be asked. As per the comment, if the person is praying in a different room, that could very well be considered 'difficult to ask', and 'implied permission' is given.</p>\n\n<p>This answer was based off a series of lectures sponsored by the Business Halacha Institute.</p>\n\n\n",

Is 9 sq. in. too small?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Sukkah (I believe in the daf is in the high-teens) discusses a halachic principle of <em>dofen akuma</em> (a bent wall). The case is slightly different from your scenario, but I think still applies. The Gemara's case is when there is a bit of roofing that is not kosher for <em>skhakh</em> separating the walls and the kosher <em>skhakh</em>. Normally the maximum distance between a wall and the <em>skhakh</em> is 3 <em>tefachim</em>. If the distance is greater than that, the <em>sukkah</em> is <em>pasul</em>. But if you have some non-kosher roofing material connecting the wall to the <em>skhakh</em>, it is considered as if that roofing material is actually part of the wall (so the wall goes vertically up to the roof and then horizontally to the <em>skhakh</em>).</p>\n\n<p>In that case, the <em>sukkah</em> is kosher; however, those inhabiting the <em>sukkah</em> must sit directly under the kosher <em>skhakh</em>. One does not fulfill his obligation for dwelling in the <em>sukkah</em> sitting under the \"bent wall.\"</p>\n\n<p>I think this clearly applies to your case where we don't have to go through any mental gymnastics to explain that the invalid roofing is actually a horizontal wall. In your case, we are talking about <em>actually sitting under a wall</em> and the <em>halakha</em> should apply the same. The <em>sukkah</em> is kosher, but one must be careful to sit under the actual <em>skhakh</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the minimal area, the gemara says on daf 2b that the minimal area of a <em>sukkah</em> is large enough to fit one's head and most of his body. Rashi repeatedly mentions that a <em>sukkah</em> is called a <em>sukkah</em> in the first place because of the <em>skhakh</em> and therefore implies that the <em>skhakh</em> is the <em>ikkar</em> of the <em>sukkah</em>. Therefore, I think that the minimum area of the <em>skhakh</em> would be large enough to fit one's head and most of his body.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If you can fit a 7x7x10 Succah inside the walls it should be fine. This is similar to the round Succah mentioned in Succah 7b, which has this requirement. And it is also a case of slanted roof which was discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/64011/does-a-succah-require-a-definitive-roof\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was there a huge concern to assure that Hoshanna Rabbah is not on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stevemorse.org/jcal/rules.htm\">This page</a> lists 4 rules that may cause the first day of Rosh Hashannah to be postponed from being on the date of the molad Tishrei. One of the rules is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If molad Tishri occurs on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday, Tishri 1 must\n  be delayed by one day for the following reasons: </p>\n  \n  <p>Wednesday or Friday would cause Yom Kippor (Tishri 10) to fall on\n  Friday or Sunday making it impossible to prepare food (because of\n  Sabbath restrictions) on either the day before or the day after the\n  Yom Kippor fast.  <strong>Sunday would cause the seventh day of Succoth\n  (Hoshana Rabba) to fall on the Sabbath</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>OK, I understand that on Hoshannah Rabbah, there is a custom to beat the <em>aravot</em> twigs on the ground, and we cannot do this on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>I'm curious as to why the calendar rules would be that concerned about performing what is a minhag rather than giving priority to performing a Torah commandment such as assuring that Rosh Hashannah never falls on Shabbat so that we can always be sure to blow the shofar on Rosh Hashannah?</p>\n\n<p>I know that there are 2 days of Rosh Hashannah, so if we miss blowing on Shabbat, at least we know that we will hear SHofar blowing on Sunday. OTOH, Hoshanna rabbah is 1 day so if we don't beat the twigs that day, there's no other day to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, shofar is still a Torah commandment, and the Torah says that there is just 1 day of Rosh Hashanna. The fact that we have 2 days is b/c we are following the <em>sfeika deyoma</em> rules. But it is still a Torah law vs. a minhag. I would think that performing the Torah law would be more important and should have precedence in deciding these postponement rules.</p>\n\n<p>My Jewish history timeline is bad. Which came first? The establishment of the calendar via Hillel IV, which we now use, or the <em>minhag</em> of beating the aravot on Hoshannah Rabbah. I don't think this is mentioned in the Mishnah or Gemarrah, but I may be wrong.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>This priority is given in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14138&st=&pgnum=294\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Sukkah 4:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר' סימון מפקד לאילין דמחשבין יהבון דעתכון דלא תעבדין לא תקיעתה בשבת ולא ערבתא בשבתא ואין אדחקון עבדון תקיעתה ולא תעבדון ערבתא</p>\n<p>R' Simon ordered those who calculate [the calendar rules], \"See to it that you don't let the blowing of the Shofar be on Shabbos, or the [beating of the] Arava on Shabbos. If you're stuck, let the Shofar [be on Shabbos], but don't let the Arava.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pnei Moshe says that this is because there are two days of Rosh Hashanah, so if one is on Shabbos we'll still have another day for Shofar. Korban Ha'eida adds (similar to DoubleAA's comment) that Shofar is a Torah commandment and so it doesn't need strengthening, but Arava is Divrei Kabbalah (from the Nevi'im) and does.</p>\n<p>By the way, the beating of the Arava is mentioned in the Bavli, Sukkah 44b, as being done in the times of R' Eliezer bar Tzadok and Rav. (And the Yehi Ratzon we say when we do it calls it מנהג נביאיך הקדושים.) So it's a lot older than Hillel's setting up the calendar.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Torah implies that a day of Rosh HaShana can be on Shabbas, “Zichron Terua” (Vayikra 23:24), where the Shofar is only remembered and not blown. Therefore, Chazal had no problem letting Rosh HaShana fall out on Shabbas.</p>\n\n\n",

So you cannot peel eggs in the morning for Seudat Shlishit, nor before supper for the morning meal. But you could peel eggs after supper for lunch - see the Aruch haShulchan <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01582.html#HtmpReportNum0237_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">סימן שיט - דיני בורר, וזורה, ומרקד</a> for some details.</p>\n\n<p>Even if we don't pasken like that (I can't say for sure) but since there are opinions like that, the food is permitted.</p>\n\n<p>So unless you're sure that there's real Chilul Shabbat involved - <strong>according to all opinions</strong> - be careful before arguing / insulting your parents.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I agree with Danny Schoemann, but my answers tend to be longer :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Short Version:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1) The child can keep eating the egg salad.</p>\n\n<p>2) The child should not be telling their parent that they are wrong.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Detailed Version With Sources:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Peeling</strong> a hard boiled egg on Shabbos, is not the melachah of <strong>Dosh (threshing)</strong>, nor is it the melachah of <strong>Borer (selecting/sorting from a mixture)</strong> according to some opinions.</p>\n\n<p>A) It is not Dosh as the Maharshag (Rav Shimon Greenfeld; 1860-1930) and other Poskim explain. He says that peeling a hard boiled egg is something the householder does, not the farmer, in processing the food. Dosh is only possible with industrial labor done with the food item in the fields. Other Poskim give alternate reasons why it is not Dosh as well. This is also why peeling bananas and oranges etc. cannot be Dosh. The farmers send these fruits to market in their peels. It is the householder's job to peel them before eating.</p>\n\n<p>B) It should not be Borer to peel fruits/eggs according to Rabbeinu Channanel (Shabbos 74a). This Rishon explains that Dosh is removing a cover from the fruit/food. When the useless cover's pieces, and the food, are now mixed up, then separating them is Borer. Borer cannot occur with peeling because the peel and fruit are not halachically called a \"mixture\".</p>\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan 319:22 (R' Yechiel Michel Epstein; 1829-1908)(who interprets the Rema this way too),and the Eglei Tal, (Borer #6 and #11) (R' Avraham Borenstein known as the Sochatchover Rebbe and author of Avnei Nezer; 1838-1910), both say that peeling fruits (and therefore eggs) has nothing to do with Borer at all, since that combination is not a mixture, but rather a food blocked by a cover.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, not peeling a hard boiled egg on Shabbos may only be a Rabbinical decree (or may be permitted according to some).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Furthermore,</strong> R' Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe Orach Chaim 4, 74, Borer, #13) asks about the requirement to perform borer \"miyad\" (immediately) before the meal to avoid breaking Shabbos. He wants to know if the usual \"hour\" before the meal to prepare (mentioned by stricter poskim) is a 60 minute hour, or more or less?</p>\n\n<p>R' Moshe concludes: \"This hour is not an hour per se, but rather the amount of time that it takes this homemaker to arrange the food for the meal..etc...\"</p>\n\n<p>So, even if the peeling of the egg would be \"Assur D'Oraisa\", this particular mother may have many guests, table cloths, silverware, and other things to prepare for; and/or she may be the type to go slow, or not have as many children helping that week etc., so that 3 hours before the meal is normal, and halachically considered \"right before the meal\" as far as she is concerned. So now it becomes permitted for her to peel the egg.</p>\n\n<p>Also, The Beis Yosef (to Siman 319) brings the opinion of Rabbeinu Yerucham, who says that the time called \"right before the meal\" can be from the morning meal until the afternoon meal! As long as the Borer preparation is done for the very next meal, it is OK and is not considered Borer for the sake of storage. This could easily be 3-4 hours (or more) !</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Prohibition to Benefit from Breaking Shabbos:</strong></p>\n\n<p>After all of the above we can see that it is permitted for the mother and child and anyone else, to eat the egg salad based on the following:</p>\n\n<p>The prohibition to benefit from chilul Shabbos, is itself a Rabbinical penalty according to how we pasken. Therefore, if there is any doubt about someone's action being a melachah or not, according to any valid halachic opinion, we do not forbid the product (the egg salad) after the fact. This is according to the Chafetz Chaim. (see Mishneh Berurah 318:2 in the name of the Pri Megadim and Magen Avraham) This is based on the rule that a doubt about a Rabbinical law (the penalty in this case to maybe forbid the egg salad) is decided leniently.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishneh Berurah further says (318:7) that if the person didn't know any better, (lets say mom thought she knew the halachah is lenient and she didn't believe her child was right when warning her), then we rely on the Vilna Gaon who says that we pasken like Tosafos in the name of R' Meir. In the case of inadvertant negligence, the food may be eaten by the transgressor on Shabbos and by the family and guests too, right away. This can be relied upon even if the sin was an Issur D'Oraisa, if there is need, and certainly if the sin was D'Rabbanan</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Chafetz Chaim continues in Beur Halachah (318:1) that the Chayey Adam (R' Avraham Danzig; 1748-1820) (Shabbos klal 9:11) teaches the prohibition only extends to products of forbidden melachah that caused a physical change in the object, like cooking. Carrying food to someone's home for instance, would not be subject to forbidding the food. Here too, the egg didn't change. A barrier around it was removed, causing inadvertant benefit.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Pri Megadim argues that a melachah of Borer should forbid the food at least until Shabbos is out, the above poskim argue for leniency (at least if the sin was inadvertant). In addition, The Maharsham (R' Sholom Schwadron; 1835-1911) (Da'at Torah 319) and R' Ovadiah Yosef (Yalkut Yosef 319:15), are lenient as well. Some of these poskim argue that the act of Borer in this case should be lenient, <strong>even if done on purpose</strong>. One other reason brought for leniency is because the borer act could have been easily done in a permitted manner. Therefore, there is no exclusive benefit from the breaking of Shabbos. R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach also seems to permit benefit from a melachah act that merely removes a blockage from a permitted object on Shabbos. For instance, if someone opened a fridge knowing the light would go on, they can still take out the food and eat it on Shabbos. If someone asked a gentile to break the seal on a letter, the Jew can still read the letter. If someone carried a key in the street and opened their door, they can still enter the house and make use of the contents. (see Sefer Meor HaShabbos, Peninei HaMeor, 4:2)</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, even if the above seems to be generally lenient, and even against the mainstream halachah of our communities in some cases, it does not matter. The Halachah is relying on some minority opinions so we do not need to penalize people for a D'Rabbanan, and cause fighting on Shabbos. This is especially true, where it may be needed to keep the peace with parents.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Honoring Parents</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Gemara relates that R' Tarfon was honoring his mother all the time. He once had to help her walk by placing his hands on the street and letting her step on him because she needed his help. He even let her berate and humiliate him in front of the Roman Senate (and other cases) without protesting. When he became ill, his mother begged the sages to pray for him to recover, saying that he always honored her. They responded that whatever he did was nowhere near what he in fact had to do for her!</p>\n\n<p>It seems like good advice for the child in the above case to find a good mentor who knows halachah and is sensitive to understanding the parents and the child; especially in a case where the child may be growing up as a more religious person than the parents choose to be. The child can gain a lot by working on the mitzvah of honoring parents and how that overrides certain halachos.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps,</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.co.il/shabbos/points/sh-ps-055.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">interprets this incident</a> as G-d's revoking His promise.

And perhaps the most direct: we read about the splitting of the sea at the end of sukkot, with specific reference to the walls of water that the Jews walked through (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0214.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 14:29</a>): \"וּבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל הָלְכוּ בַיַּבָּשָׁה, בְּתוֹךְ הַיָּם; <strong>וְהַמַּיִם לָהֶם</strong> <strong>חֹמָה, מִימִינָם וּמִשְּׂמֹאלָם</strong>. \"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n73Py.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n73Py.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are two problems that come to mind. </p>\n\n<p>There is a general law about building a sukkah, discussed in the Talmud (Sukkah 24b) and throughout rabbinic literature, that the walls of a sukkah should not sway in the wind. Modern responsa on canvas walls discuss this issue at great length (see, for example, Yaabia Omer O\"H, vol. 9, 59:1) and the means to eliminate doubts about a wall's validity. I don't see how water will fit this criteria, since it is constantly moving with a mass never in one place.

Discussing a sukkah water-wall would require examining what other situations, such as in an eruv, where water does or does not constitute a boundary. </p>\n\n\n",

The tzadik R. Meshulam Zusya of Anipoli said that he could not attain the heights of such a teshuva; he would therefore break down teshuva to its components, for each letter of the word teshuva is the initial of a verse:</p>\n<p>T: Tamim - \"Be sincere with the Eternal your G-d.\"</p>\n<p>Sh: Shiviti - \"I have set G-d before me always.\"</p>\n<p>U: V'ahavta - \"Love your fellow as yourself.\"</p>\n<p>V: B'chol - \"In all your ways, know Him.\"</p>\n<p>H: Hatznei'a - \"Walk discreetly with your G-d.\"</p>\n<p>When my father told me this, he concluded: \"The word teshuva comprises five (Hebrew) letters, each letter a path and a method in the avoda of teshuva.\" (He explained each method at length). Each moves from a potential state to actuality through the avoda of davening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hayom Yom, 4 - 8 of Tishre:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>T: Tamim...,</strong> \"Be sincere with G-d.\" This represents the avoda of teshuva that comes through sincerity. Sincerity, or \"wholeness,\" takes any number of forms and has many levels. In reference to teshuva the highest form is wholeness of heart - called \"earnestness\"; as Torah says of Avraham, \"you found his heart faithful before You.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Sh: - Shiviti...,</strong> \"I have set G-d (Havayeh) before me always.\" Havayeh indicates the creation of the universe and creatures. Bringing all of Creation into being and sustaining it is accomplished by bridging an infinite gap - from ayin (non-being, nihilo) to yesh (being). This form of the avoda (service) of teshuva results from one's constant awareness2 of the way in which the universe and all that is in it, is (constantly) brought into being.</p>\n<p><strong>U - V'ahavta...,</strong> \"Love your fellow as yourself.\" The Alter Rebbe taught that this love is an instrument, a means to \"Love the Eternal your G-d.\" This is explained in the statement, \"Whoever is pleasing to man is pleasing to G-d.\" This service of teshuva stems from goodness of heart.</p>\n<p><strong>V - B'chol...,</strong> \"In all your ways, know Him.\" A person who sets his heart and mind to observe all that happens to him and around him, will perceive G-dliness tangibly in evidence; as the Mitteler Rebbe pointed out, men of affairs have an advantage over secluded scholars, in that the former can witness actual manifestations of G-dliness. This form of the service of teshuva comes from one's perceiving hashgacha p'ratit, (particular Divine Providence).</p>\n<p><strong>H - Hatznei'a...,</strong> \"Walk discreetly with your G-d,\". One must take care not to be conspicuous or ostentatious in the slightest. It is said \"Man should always be artful in piety.\" The artfulness lies in seeing that his piety not be noticed at all. We know that a number of the early chassidim concealed their true selves, and when discovered were sincerely distressed.

    "content": "# What are the Jewish months exactly?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am aware that the names of the months are derived almost directly from the Babylonian calendar and that the Chumash itself never mentions a month by name and instead refers to it by number. Later on in Tanach (I believe only as early as Ezra and Nechemiah though I could be wrong) it starts to refer to months by name. I am also aware that the Mesopotamian new year began on the first day of the seventh month, called Tashritu and also on the first day of the first month called Nisannu. The Babylonian festival of Akitu is also eerily similar to Rosh Hashana and the Yamim Norayim in its themes and time placements. My question is twofold. Are there any sources relating to the taking of the months' names and maybe other religious practice developments of the time? And also, it seems very strange to me that we did not use names in our calendar until the first diaspora. Are there any theories as to why we did not have names in Chumash or what those names could be? It just seems strange to only have numbers for dates when no other culture does that.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Is it strange to have numbers for names of our months? Does no other culture do that?</p>\n\n<p>Ummm....does <strong>Sept</strong>ember <strong>Oct</strong>ober <strong>Nov</strong>ember <strong>Dec</strong>ember...ring a bell? :)</p>\n\n<p>In my observation of the human condition (maybe you will agree) I have seen that most people tend to like it when things are kept simple and Captain Obvious is in control. It is just natural for people to name things simply. Every town has a main street.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding months of a year, cultures have usually used either numbers, agricultural ideas or events relating to that time of year, or gods/kings names, as names for months. Numbers are simply practical, farming/weather events are simple for people to remember, and beings seen as powerful, get respected. In short: math, food, religion!</p>\n\n<p>Among the nations that use/used numbers as month names (besides Israel)are China, ancient Egypt, Japan, Thailand, and ancient Rome, to name a few. Egypt's civil calendar simply divided the year into 3 parts based on the Nile's activity and called each month in each set, #1-4.</p>\n\n<p>Lets break down Rome's calendar, as it has different examples. At first, Rome had 10 months. March was the first (named after Mars, their god of war, because that's when armies could mobilize again after winter) then April (Aphrodite, another god) May (Maiah another god) June (Juno another god) then Quintillis (5 in Latin) Sextillis (6) September(7) October(8) November(9), and December(10). King Numa (c 700BCE) decided to add two months to the calendar to represent winter. Those 60 days would just be vacation without a name. So he named one month January (after his god of beginnings and ends) and another month February because the Roman purification holiday of Februa happened then. Julius Ceaser made some calendar reforms (The Julian Calendar) and decided to rename month #5 (boring name) to \"July\" because he thought that naming a month after himself, was way cool! Another emporer named Augustus, followed by changing month 6 to August ... after himself of course!</p>\n\n<p>The joke is, that no one thought to change September - December from 7 - 10 into 9 - 12 since 700BCE!! That's dumb. But tradition dies hard. :)</p>\n\n<p>So yes, we used numbers by Biblical decree. The agricultural names we did have, are hardly mentioned in Tanach, but we do have four names. </p>\n\n<p>Aviv (spring, ripening, in Nissan; March-April) Exodus 13:4</p>\n\n<p>Ziv  (radiance, blossoming, in Iyar; April-May) I Kings, 6:1, and 6:37</p>\n\n<p>Eitanim (strong ones, fruits are in their strength, in Tishrei; Sept-Oct) I Kings, 8:2</p>\n\n<p>Bul  (withering, in Cheshvan; Oct-Nov) I Kings, 6:38</p>\n\n<p>It seems that our long exile over thousands of years has caused the other agricultural names to have been lost.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is a Biblical commandment to constantly remember the Exodus from Egypt. See Devarim 16:3. \"...in order that you should remember the day you went out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.\"</p>\n\n<p>By counting each month starting from the Exodus month as #1, we constantly remember the Exodus event throughout the year. (This is the 6th month ...6th since when, because? Oh right!)</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban also explains this as the reason our days of the week only have numbers as names. There is a Torah commandment to \"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.\" Shemos 20:8. (Today is the 4th day...till the 7th = Shabbos!) So we will all remember the Sabbath is coming every day.</p>\n\n<p>That should answer your second question.</p>\n\n<p>As to your first question, part one:</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud Yerushalmi (Rosh HaShannah 1:2) explains that when the exiles in Babylon came up to return to the land of Israel, they took the Babylonian months names with them. The Ramban sees this as a means to fulfill the verse in Jeremiah 16:14: \"Therefore behold days are coming says Hashem, and it shall no longer be said as G-d lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of Egypt; rather, as G-d lives, who brought up the children of Israel form the north land (meaning Babylon)...\"</p>\n\n<p>Just as we needed to count months to remind us of the Exodus from Egypt, we also needed new month names to remind us of the Exodus from Babylon.</p>\n\n<p>As to your question about \"other religious practice developments..\" :</p>\n\n<p>Naming months and speaking Aramaic from Babylon, is not really a major religious adaptation. Jews were always Jews. Our religion is Judaism, and not Mithraism or Zoroastrianism etc. The Jewish religion has remained quite Jewish. :)</p>\n\n<p>Your OP says: \"The Babylonian festival of Akitu is also eerily similar to Rosh Hashana and the Yamim Norayim in its themes and time placements.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is not a debate or lecture, so I will just point out one thing to help answer. Part of the Akitu festival, featured the king of Babylon reciting a \"negative confession\" before the priest of the god Marduk, in front of the people.</p>\n\n<p>The confession is called negative, because the king in fact denies any wrong-doing. \"I have not sinned O Lord of the universe, and I haven't neglected your heavenly might at all..\"</p>\n\n<p>Did Bill Clinton read the Akitu script before he told the press that he never inhaled? (Vladimir Putin drinks Vodka, but he never swallows)</p>\n\n<p>Now take a look at a \"Yomim Norayim\" prayer book. Open to the \"Al Chet\" section. Jews make positive confessions to their G-d. We say \"...we are not brazen faced and stiff necked to say before You that we are righteous and have not sinned, but rather we and our fathers have sinned!\"</p>\n\n<p>There is no similarity. A Babylonian claims he has not sinned, then asks his god for help etc. A Jew admits that he has sinned, and asks for G-d's mercy and help to do better.</p>\n\n<p>I find the stark contrast to be quite \"eery\".</p>\n\n<p>One religious innovation that we did bring up from Babylon was the Book of Esther, and the holiday of Purim!</p>\n\n<p>On that note :)</p>\n\n\n",

One may however benifit from the succah in a way that does not destroy it's form, such as leaning on it, or placing something upon it,   M.B. ibid.

I am wondering if one can, with or without a stipulation,  dismantle a succah for the express purpose of rebuilding it in a more convenient place?\nPerhaps this issue was brought up when the pop-up succos became popular?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am aware of an interesting idea from Reb Shlomo Zalman brought in Halichos Shlomo at the end of chapter 7.

    "content": "# What is the source for the idea that doing some good thing 3 times constitutes a vow?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the source for the idea that doing some good thing 3 times constitutes a vow? I looked through Hilkhot Sevuot and Nedarim, and in the Entziklopedia Talmudit under Hazaka, and I could find no such idea.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>If a person decides to <strong>intentionally</strong> do something which is a <strong>\"chumrah\"</strong> (voluntary strict practice, not required by law) and also intends that his practice be his new way of acting <strong>forever</strong>, (AND he is <strong>well aware</strong> that it is not obligatory,) then it has the halachic force of a neder (vow) <strong>even if he only does it one time</strong>. (see Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 214:1; based on Talmud tractate Nedarim 15a.) The novelty here is that the vow takes effect without a verbal declaration. (D'Rabbanan)</p>\n<p>If a person had in mind that the good practice would be a one time affair (or for the next 4 times for example, but no further) then that is OK. (This means that a person can limit the vow by such parameters.) If he had in mind that the practice would specifically not be binding, then it is not a vow at all. If a person accidentally thought that what he was doing is obligatory, then we pasken like the authorities there (214:1) that there is no vow.</p>\n<p>The Gemara and Shulchan Aruch in the source does not mention 3 times.</p>\n<p>Rav Shlomo Ganzfried (1804 - 1886) writes in Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 67:7, <em>that in addition</em>, if the person did not intend to have his new practice be from now on and forever, <em><strong>but had nothing particular in mind</strong></em>, then we apply the rule that <strong>if he did it 3 times</strong> (without having in mind that it is not a vow,) then it becomes a vow.</p>\n<p>Other Rabbis and prayerbook authorities (commenting on hataras nedarim in the machzor) apply this rule like the Kitzur SA does. It is based on the principle of a \"Chazakah\" being created by anything done 3 times. (See Talmud Baba Basra - beginning of 3d chapter, for the general halachic concept of 3 times being a chazakah.)</p>\n<p>Finally, it should be noted that there are therefore halachic leniencies regarding such a vow, such as special instances when the vow might not be in force, and how to retract such a vow in front of a Rav. As always, one should consult their LOR.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm not sure about an original source, but it's mentioned in Hatarat Nedarim done on Erev Rosh Hashanah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>או אֵיזו הַנְהָגָה טובָה או אֵיזֶה דָבָר טוב שֶׁנָּהַגְתִּי שָׁלשׁ פְּעָמִים וְלא הִתְנֵיתִי שֶׁיְּהֵא בְּלִי נֶדֶר (<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/encyclopedia/value.asp?id1=637\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">text source</a>)</p>\n<p>...

Rabbi Dovid Fink gave an excellent course that mentioned this exact topic and if I can find the link later I'll post it.</p>\n<p>Update: I was hoping to go back and listen to the class to get the exact quote but I don't have time. I will summarize as follows: There is no source for doing 3 times = a vow until very recent times. No one in Biblical, Rabbinic, or Geonic times would have practiced such a concept.

Originally, it was felt that the Koine translation of the Torah, and specifically only the Torah, was good enough. The Greek words had specific connotations and the translation was good enough for the majority of people to get all the different layers of understanding out of the text. Koine Greek eventually became unknown with the nuance required, the text became corrupted away from the original text of the 70 elders as the Greek text didn't get the same care as the Hebrew. So, Greek just degraded away to the point where it was ruled that it cannot be used anymore.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tefillin and mezuzot may be written only in Assyrian script.

    "content": "# Looking for a word with a distinct meaning driven by mesorah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am researching some words to see the agendas of translators. One way to understand what a translator knew or cared about is to look for words which have a generally accepted meaning, and an exception -- a case where Jews understand the word to mean something totally different regardless of its spelling or linguistic similarity to the mass of its uses, and se what the translator used. If the translator had access to meforshim or the talmud, he would then have to decide if he wanted to employ the normative translation or the religious interpretation. Not using the Jewish reading would not prove anything on its own, but could establish a pattern for that translator.</p>\n\n<p>The starting example is the word qaran (ray/beam of light) in Shmot 34:30. In most cases, the root refers to horns, but Onkelos and others see the word as a very rare case of the word meaning an emanation of light. Someone outside of the religious world, looking just at the text and the construction of the word would not see that as a popular option.</p>\n\n<p>Are there other words which mean something unexpected only by dint of religious interpretation? So far, I am looking at r-tz-ch (as kill vs. murder), sh-b-t (as week vs. a specific day), and g-r (when to use it as convert vs. anything else). I have discarded k-d-sh, k-p-r and ch-t-a.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone present a word which usually means X but through tradition, we accept that it means Y?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This example peaked my curiosity when I first paid attention to it:</p>\n\n<p>Exodus 12:9:</p>\n\n<p>Sefaria translation in English</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אַל־תֹּאכְל֤וּ מִמֶּ֙נּוּ֙ <strong>נָ֔א</strong> וּבָשֵׁ֥ל מְבֻשָּׁ֖ל בַּמָּ֑יִם\n  כִּ֣י אִם־צְלִי־אֵ֔שׁ רֹאשׁ֥וֹ עַל־כְּרָעָ֖יו וְעַל־קִרְבּֽוֹ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Eat not of it <strong>raw</strong>, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with\n  fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashbam on Exodus 12:9:1 (Sefaria English):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נא - נראה לשון צלי קדרה המבושל בלא מים ובלא צלי אש הכתוב כאן.</p>\n  \n  <p>נא , I believe this means a type of frying in a pot but in its own juice\n  (including the blood) not involving water known as צלי קדר, not\n  roasting directly on the fire, as required by our verse here [so that\n  the blood drips off.

We pasken (following Rambam) that both of these categories are <em>assur miderabbanan</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, oral medication is only permitted for a <em>choleh (she'ein bo sakanah)</em>. Presumably, the people taking caffeine suppositories do not fall into the cateory of a <em>choleh</em>, which is why they won't take oral pills.</p>\n\n<p>He didn't discuss suppositories at all, but I imagine that taking them is not considered any form of <em>achilah</em> and therefore it is <em>muttar lechatchilah</em> to take them.</p>\n\n<p>One further complication with taking pills orally (even for a <em>choleh</em>) is if water is needed to help one swallow them, as drinking the water is <em>k'derech achilah</em> (and additionally we hold <em>chatzi shiur assur min hatorah</em>). R. Weiss mentioned that some <em>poskim</em> recommend rendering the water unfit by putting some dish soap into it, to make it <em>shelo k'derech achilah</em>. His personal ruling is to add a significant amount of salt to the water.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, even if the person under discussion does have the status of a <em>choleh</em>, I can understand why they may prefer to take suppositories rather than needing to take a pill with unpleasant-tasting water.</p>\n\n\n",

Sumchos says in the name of Rebbi Meir three months</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the times of the early <em>Acharonim</em>, it became a topic of discussion that experience showed that women stopped getting their period before this time, possibly due to a change in female physiology.</p>\n<p>The Noda B'Yehuda in Even HaEzer 69, who was asked whether a woman who had gotten her period since her husband had passed away and then had a child could be assumed to have had the child out of wedlock, argued that it was still common for women to bleed during the first three months (and even afterward in some cases), and that the reports to the contrary were not to be relied on to defame a woman in good standing.</p>\n<p>Rebbi Akiva Eiger (born 1761), in a responsum (#128) regarding a woman who was now pregnant and whose husband had been out of town since the last time she had her period, wrote that even though it is uncommon for women to bleed once they conceive, it is still a plausible enough occurence that one cannot rule out the possibility that she was pregnant from before she had her period (and the child is therefore not a <em>mamzer</em>).</p>\n<p>Chasam Sofer (born 1762), in responsum YD 169, makes the assertion that bleeding is reduced upon conception but still continues until three months.</p>\n<p>Rav Vozner (born 1913) (Shiurei Shevet HaLevi 189:33 #2) assumes that one cannot be lenient due to this reality and obviate concerns of <em>vesst</em>. One would assume that would apply to the prohibition of <em>havchana</em> (abstaining for three months after divorce) as well.</p>\n<p>There are a few opinions with which I am familiar that entertain taking the \"new reality\" into account. The Sidrei Tahara to YD 194:2 cites the opinion of the Avodas HaGershuni (born 1618) and the Shvus Yaakov (born 1661) that the age of a miscarried fetus can be calculated from the date of the most recent period, implying that the pregnancy can be assumed to not have begun before then, and the qualification of the Talmud was merely defining the point at which one reliably knows a woman is pregnant. [Teshuva Me'ahava (1:70) implies that he in principle agrees to this.] Sidrei Tahara himself rejects this approach, as do the Chavas Da'as and Chasam Sofer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14709&st=&pgnum=135&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Be'er Moshe 1:48:3</a> refers to a lenient opinion which is based on the assumption that the three months was only in the times of the Talmud when women continued bleeding until three months. However, he leaves the matter unresolved, and is only discussing <em>vesstos</em>, not <em>havchana</em>.</p>\n<p>So the overwhelming consensus, certainly of the later authorities, is that, despite the fact that we see that women do not necessarily have their period during the first three months of pregnancy, the <em>halacha</em> does not change to reflect that fact.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I don't think that such a question is for a blog. the accepted psak is that as Double AA has written, however just for the sake of something different here's a Chidah (Chomas Anach Shmuel 2 11 4)\nותבא אליו וישכב עמה וכו' פי' ואין כאן חשש אסור משום הבחנה כי היא מתקדשת מטומאתה מנדתה וכיון שהיה לה ארח כנשים ודאי אינה מעוברת וגם היא פנויה כי  היה לה גט מבעלה דכל היוצא למלחמת בית דדוד גט כריתות כותב לאשתו מפרשים </p>\n\n\n",

This answer is just a very brief introduction to how Jewish law works.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Please read the verse in context: The Jews are leaving the camp every day to gather manna. They're told that there will be no manna on Shabbat, gather double on Friday. \"Everyone should stay in their place on Shabbat.\" I.e. don't gather manna!</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud says this means two things: A.] Don't carry in a public thoroughfare. B.] Don't walk far beyond the inhabited city limits. </p>\n\n<p>Note that you could walk ten miles, with empty pockets, in many big cities today while staying in the inhabited limits, and thus not violating anything.</p>\n\n<p>The rule of thumb is that Shabbat violation is a sufficiently-serious problem that no mitzva overrides it unless explicitly mentioned. Saving a life overrides any issue of Shabbat, and hence the Talmud talks about people leaving the city limits to put out a fire, fight off bad guys, rescue people from a flood or a collapse, or deliver a baby. </p>\n\n<p>But if the only way for me to get to synagogue is to carry or go beyond the inhabited city limits (or drive, for that matter), \"don't break Shabbat\" comes first. I should pray at home. (Or anywhere else in my town.)</p>\n\n<p>Circumcising a baby is an interesting one as if a baby is born conventionally on Shabbat, his circumcision is held the next Shabbat (even though normally, elective surgery is a prohibited on Shabbat). (The Torah spells out explicitly that the daily sacrifices override Shabbat, and uses similar language regarding circumcision.) Yet the only prohibitions overridden are those that could not in any way (even theoretically) have been done before Shabbat, such as the actual cutting. If the baby is a hundred miles from the nearest <em>mohel</em>, you may not drive or carry the baby on Shabbat as <em>theoretically</em> (even if it was impractical for any sort of reason, e.g. the doctors wouldn't let him out of the hospital) that could have been done on Friday. The circumcision would instead be postponed to Sunday.</p>\n\n\n",

According to Maimonides, the banquet is an allusion to the spiritual enjoyment of the intellect (commentary on Sanh. i.). The name, he says, is derived from (\" to join,\" \"to unite\"), and designates an imaginary monster in which are combined the most various animals (\"Moreh,\" iii., ch. xxiii.). In the cabalistic literature the \"piercing leviathan\" and the \"crooked leviathan\" (Isa. xxvii. 1), upon which the haggadah concerning the hunting of the animal is based, are interpreted as referring to Satan-Samael and his spouse Lilith (\"'Emeḳ ha-Melek,\" p. 130a), while Ḳimḥi, Abravanel, and others consider the expressions to be allusions to the destruction of the powers which are hostile to the Jews (comp. Manasseh ben Israel, \"Nishmat Ḥayyim,\" p. 48; see also Kohut, \"Aruch Completum,\" s. v. \"Leviathan,\" for other references, and his essay in \"Z. D. M. G.\" vol. xxi., p. 590, for the parallels in Persian literature). The haggadic sayings obtained a hold on the imagination of the poets, who introduced allusions to the banquet of the leviathan into the liturgy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, some scholars do identify at least some parallel between these symbolic beasts and actual, extant species:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ever since Bochart (\"Hierozoicon,\" iii. 705), \"behemoth\" has been\n  taken to denote the hippopotamus; and Jablonski, to make it correspond\n  exactly with that animal, compared an Egyptian form, \"p-ehe-mu\" (=\n  \"water-ox\"), which, however, does not exist. The Biblical description\n  contains mythical elements, and the conclusion is justified that these\n  monsters were not real, though the hippopotamus may have furnished in\n  the main the data for the description.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/news/new-from-ou-press-the-torah-encyclopedia-of-the-animal-kingdom-by-rabbi-natan-slifkin/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ou.org/news/new-from-ou-press-the-torah-encyclopedia-of-the-animal-kingdom-by-rabbi-natan-slifkin/</a> :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As to where the hippopotamus is mentioned in the Torah, Rabbi Slifkin\n  argues that this is the identity of the “behemoth” described in the\n  Book of Job: “Behold now behemoth, which I made with you; he eats\n  grass like an ox. Behold now, the strength of his loins, and the power\n  in his belly…”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(I'm afraid the ellipsis seems to include his argument's refutation: \"He moveth his tail like a cedar...\" which does not seem to be imagery consistent with the anatomy of a hippo:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1FAJT.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1FAJT.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>.

However, the Magen Avraham and Taz write that the\n  generally accepted custom is to permit non-leather shoes. The opinion\n  that prohibits any protective footwear is also cited by the Sha’arei\n  Teshuvah (OC 554: 11) and the Kaf Hachaim (OC 554:72). The Sha’ar\n  HaTziyun quotes the Chatam Sofer that when walking in the street on\n  Yom Kippur one should wear thin shoes so as to feel the ground and\n  sense that he is barefoot.

Although in this regard the\n  accepted halachah is that “shoe” is synonymous with “leather shoe,”\n  that may not be true for all halachot. For example, the SA (OC 4:18)\n  requires one to wash hands after removing one’s shoe, and Rabbi\n  Yitzchak Nissim, a former Israeli chief rabbi (1896-1981; Yein Ha’tov\n  1:13), discusses whether washing is required also for merely touching\n  one’s shoe and whether the halachah applies to all shoes.</p>\n  \n  <p>[6]. <strong>One must be careful not to mistakenly wear sneakers with leather\n  sides</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

R’ Ribiat (The 39\n  Melochos p919) writes that this applies to hand creams such as Nivea\n  and Vaseline, etc. One may, however, use a liquid hand lotion (which\n  can be poured). R’ Dr. Avraham Avraham writes (Nishmat Avraham 1 OC\n  328:22b) that both R’ Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (quoted in Shemiras\n  Shabbos Kehilchasa 33:n58) and R’ Eliezer Waldenberg (Tzitz Eliezer\n  7:30:2) held that while spreading an ointment evenly on one’s skin is\n  forbidden mideoraisa, this is only if it remains on the surface. One\n  may, however, rub cream into the skin if it gets properly absorbed\n  (See Daas Torah 328:26; Minchas Yitzchak 7:20). As one shouldn’t take\n  medicine on Shabbos, this doesn’t apply to medicinal creams, though a\n  bedridden patient (choleh shein bo sakanah) may rub such cream in. The\n  same applies to young children. For creams that are not absorbed, one\n  may press cream (from the back of a spoon, etc.) providing one does\n  not rub the cream in. One is allowed to rub off excess ointments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>2) Is sunscreen cream considered a medical reason? See <a href=\"http://www.eretzhemdah.org/newsletterArticle.asp?lang=en&pageid=4&cat=7&newsletter=1280&article=4806\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One cannot justify using sunscreen due to an acute medical need if the\n  need arises from one’s desire to sunbathe. It is permitted to spray\n  liquid sunscreen (Orchot Shabbat 17:20.). This is not considered\n  medicinal because its purpose is not to strengthen the body but to\n  shield one from external injury (see Shulchan Aruch, OC 328:27, which\n  permits covering a healing wound with a bandage).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If it is borer, is it okay to do it if you remove some part of the vegetable on top while you remove the stem so you're taking off some good with the bad (ex: tomatoes, peppers etc.)?</p>\n\n<p>What about cutting off the stems from herbs, say basil - so that you can use just the leaves? Is this also <em>borer</em>, or must you pick the leaves off the stems?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Shmiras Shabbos K’hilchasa (3:35 and note 97): He brings down that it is mutar to remove the stems from tomatoes, plums, apples, pears, peaches, and cherries as long as this is done for immediate use.</p>\n\n<p>He brings down two possible rationales for this.</p>\n\n<p>a) The stem is just like a peel that is preventing you from eating the entire fruit. According to this approach it would have to be done just prior to eating like peeling fruits</p>\n\n<p>b) The stem is not technically mixed with the fruit since it is so clearly distinct as a separate item. They are just coincidentally attached. According to this approach this could even be done for later since you just aren’t doing Borer.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless he suggests that L’maseh a person should also utilize the technique of the Chazon Ish of holding the stem stationary and pulling the fruit away from it so that you are definitely considered as taking the good from the bad and thus covering for all possibilities.</p>\n\n\n",

Another difference is this wine which becomes assur from the vessels will be nullified in sixty. There are various details that matter though. See the Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.137?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. It depends on whether the vessel is made for storing wine or not, and if it is not made to store wine, the amount of time the new wine stays in the vessel will matter. There is also a siman found <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.135?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> which discusses which types of vessels are suspect or not to having been used for storing wine. </p>\n\n<p>In your specific example, being that the bottle is made to store wine and the cup is not, they will have two different laws. Assuming the bottle was touched by someone who causes the wine to become assur, after which it is poured into a cup. Now, both are emptied, dried and refilled with kosher wine. The wine in the bottle becomes assur immediately, and the wine in the cup will only become assur if left there for twenty four hours.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, the simplest solution is to remember not to wrap up the\n  esrog on Hoshanah Rabbah. Without wrapping or refrigeration, the esrog\n  will soon dry out and become inedible. At that point, one may dispose\n  of it.</p>\n  \n  <p>When we look around the shul on Sukkos and see everyone holding his\n  own set of arba’ah minim, we should sing praises to Hashem for helping\n  us fulfill these mitzvos so easily in comparison to earlier times,\n  when it was common for an entire community to share one set. At the\n  same time, we should remember the modern farmer in Israel who observed\n  shmittah with true mesiras nefesh, thereby attesting to the message of\n  shmittah — that the Ribbono Shel Olam created the world in six days\n  and rested on the seventh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bethisraelmalden.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/annual-halacha-guide-5776.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Another post</a> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Beth Israel - Malden - Annual Halacha Guidebook - </p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Rabinowitz</p>\n  \n  <p>Important Notice Regarding Your Etrog - This year has been the Shmitta\n  year in Israel and its produce has a special sanctity.

I didn't think much of that until I was an adult and as I got older I thought how wrong and cowardly it was of my ancestors to run and hide like that.

    "content": "# Ibrahim slaugthering his son as per Jewish beliefs?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Do Jews have a custom or teaching of Qurban/slaughtering animals as Muslims do to commemorate Prophet Ibrahim's test of slaughtering his son?</p>\n\n<p>If so, is it on a particular time or month and what this event is called? I'm also curious to know as per Jewish teachings which son of Prophet Ibrahim was asked to be slaughtered?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Jews do have a teaching that when Abraham was childless that he slaughtered an animal when making a pact with God in which God promises Abraham that he will have a child. Later in Abraham's life, he slaughter's an animal instead of his son Isaac. God specifically tells him to sacrifice Isaac. However, the dates that these events happened are not brought down by the Torah or Jewish tradition. Therefore we do not have any celebrations or festivals for these events. </p>\n\n<p>The Episode of Abraham Sacrificing an animal to make a covenant with God comes from chapter 15 of Genesis, which is the first book of the Torah. This chapter says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Genesis Chapter 15</p>\n  \n  <p>1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision,\n  saying: 'Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield, thy reward shall be\n  exceeding great.' 2 And Abram said: 'O Lord GOD, what wilt Thou give\n  me, seeing I go hence childless, and he that shall be possessor of my\n  house is Eliezer of Damascus?' 3 And Abram said: 'Behold, to me Thou\n  hast given no seed, and, lo, one born in my house is to be mine heir.'\n  4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying: 'This man\n  shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own\n  bowels shall be thine heir.' 5 And He brought him forth abroad, and\n  said: 'Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if thou be able to\n  count them'; and He said unto him: 'So shall thy seed be.' 6 And he\n  believed in the LORD; and He counted it to him for righteousness. 7\n  And He said unto him: 'I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of\n  the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.' 8 And he said: 'O\n  Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?' 9 And He said\n  unto him: 'Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of\n  three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and\n  a young pigeon.' 10 And he took him all these, and divided them in the\n  midst, and laid each half over against the other; but the birds\n  divided he not. 11 And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses,\n  and Abram drove them away. 12 And it came to pass, that, when the sun\n  was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a dread, even a\n  great darkness, fell upon him. 13 And He said unto Abram: 'Know of a\n  surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs,\n  and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;\n  14 and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and\n  afterward shall they come out with great substance. 15 But thou shalt\n  go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 16\n  And in the fourth generation they shall come back hither; for the\n  iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.' 17 And it came to pass,\n  that, when the sun went down, and there was thick darkness, behold a\n  smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.\n  18 In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: 'Unto thy\n  seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great\n  river, the river Euphrates;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The section of the Torah in which God commands Abraham to sacrifice Isaac is from comes a few chapters later in the Torah. At this point in Abraham's life, God has fulfilled his promise to Abraham, and Abraham had not only one child but two, Ishmael and Isaac, but Sarah forced Abraham to send Ishmael away and so now the only child left with Abraham is Isaac. Abraham did not want to send Ishmael away, and Abraham only agrees to send away Ishmael when God comforts Abraham and tells him that even though Ishmael will be sent away, God will still make a great nation of Ishmael because he is still a son of Abraham.

And he\n  said: 'Here am I, my son.' And he said: 'Behold the fire and the wood;\n  but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?' 8 And Abraham said: 'God\n  will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son.' So they\n  went both of them together. 9 And they came to the place which God had\n  told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in\n  order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the\n  wood. 10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to\n  slay his son. 11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of\n  heaven, and said: 'Abraham, Abraham.' And he said: 'Here am I.' 12 And\n  he said: 'Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing\n  unto him; for now I know that thou art a God-fearing man, seeing thou\n  hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from Me.' 13 And Abraham\n  lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in\n  the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and\n  offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son. 14 And\n  Abraham called the name of that place Adonai-jireh; as it is said to\n  this day: 'In the mount where the LORD is seen.' 15 And the angel of\n  the LORD called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven, 16 and said:\n  'By Myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, because thou hast done this\n  thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, 17 that in\n  blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy\n  seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the\n  seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; 18 and\n  in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because\n  thou hast hearkened to My voice.' 19 So Abraham returned unto his\n  young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and\n  Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba. {P}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Muslim faith is the only religion that i am aware of that have a celebration for these events.</p>\n\n\n",

If he will be able to say the Shma and its blessings within the proper time, he need not cover his eyes when he says the verse earlier in Davening.</p>\n\n<p>One of the reasons we insert Shma in the kedusha of musaf (according to the research I did for <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/15855/shema-in-musaf-kedushah-source-and-reason\">this</a> question) is because its being said had been outlawed. If so, then saying it in musaf became the time to fulfill the obligation of saying Shma -- would the eyes have been covered then?</p>\n\n<p>And in Kriat Shma al Hamittah (according to the handy Artscroll siddur) one must cover his eyes as well -- and yet this recitation is NOT about fulfilling that obligation to recite the Shma, assuming ma'ariv has been said at a late enough time. So why would there be any eye covering there?

    "content": "# What is a cultural Jew?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have recently read a wikipedia article about a person who says he is a a cultural Jew. What does this exactly mean? Is this just a sugar coated way to say a nonreligious Jew or Secular Jew or is there more to it than just that?</p>\n\n<p>Just for reference this is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Lamberg\" rel=\"nofollow\">article I'm thinking of</a>. It is a bit sparse so I do not know if any further details can be discerned from it</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>My answer will probably be a bit scattered to begin with as this is such a broad topic and i will probably refine it as people comment and as i'm able to find more definitive sources.</p>\n\n<p>A \"cultural Jew\" in an American context has come to mean quite a few things, it could be someone who was born into a Jewish family, was raised with certain customs and maybe was even educated in Judaism, but came to disagree with the religion and therefore considers himself a cultural Jew in that he rejects the religion but accepts the ancestry. It can also refer to someone that was born into a family of Jews that was or is ignorant of the religion and was never taught anything of the religion, but certain cultural things were still passed down, such as food, ways of thinking, or outlooks on life. A man who grew up speaking Yiddish an eating Gefilte Fish but never attended a Synagogue or learned Hebrew is still as \"culturally Jewish\" as one who went through the Yeshivah system and walked away from it. </p>\n\n<p>Food is often a big determining factor of a cultural Jew as food is always a defining character of ethnicity. How do i know when i'm at an Egyptian Jew's house as opposed to an Irqi or Syrian Jew's house? Only the Egyptian Jews prize a food called Molokhia/Molokheya. Think of the difference between Koreans, Japanese and Chinese. You can say that they all have different languages, histories, and heritages, but when they are raised in America and have only been taught language, often their most distinguishing feature is the foods that they grow up with and feel partial to.</p>\n\n<p>This idea of a cultural Jew is much more heavily influenced from Jews reigning from Europe, as European Jewry became much more sectarian and defined by specific ideas, beliefs, or ways of living. An observant Jew looks/dresses different(ly) than a nonreligious Jew, whereas in some places of the middle east, this kind of distinction wouldn't have been as obvious amongst Jewry there. And while these undercurrents of nonreligious Jews who still considered themselves Jewish started as a natural Jewish phenomena, the entire process was quickened and solidified by Hitler and his attempt to exterminate the Jewish people. Because to Hitler, it didn't matter if you were an actively religious Jew, or if you happened to have one great grandfather on your father's side that was a Jew, you were all going to the concentration camp. And so suddenly, the heavily atheistic \"educated\" Jews of Europe were in the same train cars next to Chassidic Rabbis from rural villages, with everyone being stripped down and reduced to the same thing, a number set in motion toward death.</p>\n\n<p>When Israel became a nation they often defined who is \"a Jew\" based on Hitler's definitions of who a Jew was or wasn't. Since the adage of Israel was \"Never Again,\" and was designed as a safe haven, a place for Jews to flee, they had to struggle with the idea of \"who is a Jew?\" Is it someone that's halakhically considered a Jew? Is it someone who is currently religious? Or is it anyone facing persecution for being Jewish regardless of religious observance or lineage? Israel has often accepted the last view to be their definition, which has caused Rabbis to ask, should Hitler be the one who decides who is or isn't a Jew? Should White Supremacists who bomb reform or reconstructionist Temples be the ones who decide who is Jewish? There are no definitive answers to these questions, but these questions have led to an entire new category of Jewry, the cultural Jews.</p>\n\n<p>This category of Jews now that it has become firmly established will continue to grow and change through time, but it has now become cemented as an entity that will continue to persist and define itself.</p>\n\n\n",

If, therefore, the bed of Og was nine cubits in\n  length, he must, according to this proportion, have been six cubits\n  high, or a little more. The words, \"by the cubit of a man,\" mean, by\n  the measure of an ordinary man, and not by the measure of Og; for men\n  have the limbs in a certain proportion. Scripture thus tells us that\n  Og was double as long as an ordinary person, or a little less. This is\n  undoubtedly an exceptional height among men, but not quite impossible. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp134.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam clearly disagrees with, or does not take literally, the Talmudic account of Moshe and Og.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>I got something from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.dafdigest.org/Bechoros/Bechoros%2520044.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjKuJPWg73gAhWOT30KHVRaAQ0QFjAAegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw3e3UA1Wv11bKdNjNfb3m9S\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Moshe Rabeinu was ten amos tall  משה רבינו עשר אמות היה שנאמר ויפרש את\n  האהל על המשכן. מי פרשו? משה רבינו פרשו T he Mishkan was ten amos high,\n  and the verse tells us that  Moshe Rabeinu spread the covering over\n  its top. This leads Rav  to the conclusion that Moshe Rabeinu was ten\n  amos tall.   Pardes Yosef (to Shemos 40:19) asks how this information \n  can lead to a conclusion regarding Moshe’s height. Would it  have not\n  been possible for Moshe to stand on a platform or on a  ladder and\n  spread the cover without himself being so tall? He  explains that our\n  Gemara must be of the opinion that Moshe’s  spreading the cover over\n  the top of the Mishkan is defined as a  service, and, as such, the one\n  performing the service may not have  an interposition between his feet\n  and the floor (see Zevachim  26a). Therefore, it could not have been\n  that Moshe was standing  on a ladder or any other raised surface.<br>\n  Pardes Yosef adds that this explanation is indicated in the  words of\n  the question and answer of the Gemara. The Gemara  asks, “Who spread\n  the cover over the tent?” The answer given is  that it was Moshe, as\n  the verse (Shemos 40:19) says, “And he  spread the cover over the\n  tent.” Apparently, if we have an explicit  verse which states this\n  fact, what is the purpose of the Gemara’s  question and answer? It\n  must be that the Gemara is coming to  emphasize that this task was a\n  service assigned to Moshe, and it  was not allowed to be done by\n  anyone else other than him. And  now that the Gemara determined that\n  the spreading of the cover  over the tent was a service, the next\n  point is that Moshe could not  have been standing on top of anything\n  while he spread it, so he  must have been tall enough to do it\n  directly.   R’ Shimi b. Chiya told Rav that according to his\n  explanation,  Moshe was blemished, because the proportion of his body,\n  which  was huge, to his arms, which are understood to be regular\n  sized,  was disproportionate. Rav corrected R’ Shimi, and he told him \n  that Moshe’s arms were also large, and therefore in proportion to  the\n  rest of his body. The Achronim note that the question of R’  Shimi\n  seems surprising, because Moshe was a levi, and blemishes  are not a\n  factor to disqualify a levi from his service to either open  and close\n  the gates of the Mikdash or to sing.   Chasam Sofer explains that R’\n  Shimi’s question was that al- though Moshe’s blemish would not\n  disqualify him from service in  the Mikdash, this physical blemish\n  would disqualify him from  serving as a judge on the Sanhedrin. The\n  Gemara in Yevamos  (101b) learns from a verse in Shir HaShirim (4:7)\n  that a judge of  the Sanhedrin could not have a blemish.   Gri”z\n  points out that as a levi Moshe’s blemish was not a fac- tor, but we\n  know that Moshe served as a kohen during the dedica- tion of the\n  Mishkan, and having a blemish would not have al- lowed him to serve in\n  this role. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

To quote myself in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/29398/883\">another answer</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch HaRav (<a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh2/1/340/17.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">340:17</a>) (and I believe, the Minchas Chinuch) holds that the melacha of tearing only applies to composite items. I.e., fabrics, which are made from multiple threads, or anything else that is two or more items connected together. Therefore, there is no prohibition, Biblical or Rabbinic, against tearing paper or similar items.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Mishna Berura (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=385\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">340:41</a>) holds that tearing paper <em>is</em> a violation of the melacha of tearing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>But wait -- there's more!</strong> The things you mentioned -- toilet paper, aluminum foil -- present another problem, that of Tikkun Maneh. Essentially, by separating the toilet paper or foil, one is \"creating\" a new useful object, and this is forbidden as a sub-category of <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/the-39-melachos/melacha38/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makeh B'Patish</a>.

However, the gemoro in nazir talks about the <em>hashchasa</em> (destruction) of the beard as being forbidden which would mean that the use of the laser is similar to the cutting of the hair by a razor. Note that even a razor is not \"permanent\" as it grows back.  I deal with the similar question of using a laser to cut during shechita at <a href=\"http://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2011/08/if-you-shecht-with-light-saber-it.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">If you shecht with a light saber, is the animal kosher?</a>. In spite of the title, the concept can be dealt with seriously.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the Rambam states in H. Avodas Zarah 12:8: </p>\n\n<p><strong>ואינו חייב עד שיגלחנו בתער--שנאמר \"ולא תשחית, את פאת זקנך\" (ויקרא יט,כז), גילוח שיש בו השחתה; לפיכך אם גילח זקנו במספריים, פטור.  ואין המתגלח לוקה, עד שיסייע.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>One is liable only when one shaves with a razor, as [implied by Leviticus 19:27]: \"Do not destroy the corners of your beard.\" [We can infer that this applies only] to shaving which utterly destroys [one's facial hair]. Therefore, a person who removes his beard with scissors is exempt.</em></p>\n\n<p>This can imply that \"shaving\" with a device such as this, which uses light as a \"blade\" <strong>may</strong> be similar enough to a razor, to be asur in the same way. The Gemoro in Nazir 40 - 41 discusses the reason that a razor is required and why other kinds of \"shaving\" are not asur. I have not yet seen a discussion of \"burning\" off the hair of a beard yet and cannot reach a conclusion on that matter.</p>\n\n<p>I do not actually know if the halacha has been dealt with yet, but it may also involve the concept of <em>ma'aris ayin</em> (appearance of doing something wrong).</p>\n\n<p>My own personal opinion would be that it should at least be avoided since it does appear to be hashchasa (destruction) of the hair and is more like a razor than a chemical depilation. However, this is not definite.</p>\n\n\n",

These are blessings which it claims must be recited before reciting any portion of the written or oral Torah.  Here are the two blessings (abbreviated):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... בּרוּךְ אַתׇּה יי ... וְצִוׇּנוּ לַעֲסוֹק בְּדִבְרֵי תוֹרׇה <br/>\nBlessed art thou Hashem ... and who has commanded us to engulf ourselves in words of Torah</p>\n<p>בּרוּךְ אַתׇּה יי ... אֲשֶׁר בׇּחַר בׇּנוּ מִכׇּל הׇעַמִּים וְנׇתַז לׇנוּ אֶת תּוׄרׇתוׄ <br/>\nBlessed art thou Hashem ... who chose us from all the nations and gave us his Torah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Immediately following these two blessings are three passages, one from the Torah (Numbers 6:24-26), one from the Mishnah (Peah 1:1), and one from the Gemara (Shabbat 127a).  In the explanatory notes at the bottom, it says that once a blessing over a mitzvah is recited, the mitzvah must be performed immediately.  Therefore, the three passages, which include all forms of Torah written and oral, should be recited.</p>\n<p>The question I have is what procedure should/can be followed when praying in shul.  Clearly, the morning prayers contains passages from the Torah, so the blessing is required.  However, is it required that I recite the three passages?  Consider the following scenario.  If I arrive at shul, recite the two blessings over the Torah, and immediately jump into either the offerings or פְסוּקֵי דְּזִמְרָא then would I not be reading excerpts from the Torah thereby fulfilling the blessing?  In this case, would I not be required to read the three excerpts of Torah?  Or, would it be the case that I should still recite them to make sure I have covered all my bases (Torah, Mishnah, and Gemara)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Birchot_HaTorah\" rel=\"nofollow\">one</a> site, there is a machloket</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The minhag is to say the Pesukim of Birkat Cohanim and the משניות of Elu Devarim after Birchot HaTorah.

Therefore, when Jews left Israel and moved to cold climates such as northern and eastern Europe, they would have needed to adapt.  How were they able to obtain the 4 species before modern times?  Did some communities not have them during Sukkot, and what was done in that circumstance?  Were there customs associated with importing them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>It seems, according to <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/landedpages/printarticle.aspx?id=2179\">this</a> article, that people found a way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It would seem that as long as Jews stayed in the moderate climate on the shores of the Mediterranean, there was no difficulty obtaining etrogim for the holiday. As people moved north into France, Germany, Poland and Russia, however, the temperature-sensitive tree could not exist and tremendous problems ensued. In fact, the halachic literature is replete with cases of only one etrog being available to fulfill an entire community's need. \n  The commercial aspect regarding the Jews' willingness to buy these fruits at any price was not lost on the non-Jews. In 1329, victorious Guelph Florence prohibited the republic of Pisa from engaging in the etrog trade, keeping the lucrative business for itself. Empress Maria Theresa (mid-18th century) demanded a huge annual tax of 40,000 florins from the Jews of Bohemia for the right to import their etrogim. \n  The local Jewish community was often in charge of etrogim sales, and a small tax was levied in order to help with communal expenses. The fledgling Ashkenazi community of Jerusalem in the first half of the 19th century was prohibited from engaging in the etrog trade. \n  One of the early etrog dealers in Palestine to break the Sephardic monopoly was Rabbi Yaakov Sapir, for whom the Jerusalem Hills moshav Even Sapir is named. He describes how \"when I came from the holy city of Tzfat, may it be rebuilt, to Jerusalem, the holy city, may it be rebuilt, in the year 1835, the entire business was in the hands of the Sephardic community. A great rabbi, who was in charge of the fund, would send two people in the month of Av every year, who were born in Israel, to bring the necessary number of erogim. In those days, 500 etrogim was more than enough.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, that is only \"generally\" true, as CashCow reminded me that some of the Twelve are believed to be composed during the time some of the Rishonim were written. This leads to one question:</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the divisional names of Rishonim / Aharonim intended to reflect?</strong> Two ideas seem logical: (a) generally, the period of their writing, or (b) the topic of their content, that is, the Aharonim largely focusing prophetically on the future (latter) days of Israel, while the Rishonim are largely focusing on the historical (former) days of Israel?</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>What is the earliest known reference to the Neviim having the Rishonim / Aharonim division for organization?</strong> That is, do the Dead Sea Scrolls show evidence of this particular division? Apparently there is at least reference to the total body of the Neviim <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Hebrew_Bible_canon#Dead_Sea_Scrolls\" rel=\"nofollow\">as early as 68 CE in the Dead Sea Scrolls</a>, but is there evidence of organizing them in the two divisions at that time?

However, since there is an argument if one can say the blessing 'He who gives good scent in fruits', being that it is not normally smelled as it is used for a mitzvah, one may not make a blessing on it.</p>\n\n<p>This is the end of the translation.</p>\n\n<p>So although the Shulchan Aruch rules like the opinion that one may smell an esrog, as it is not muktza for this purpose, he takes the other opinion which says it is muktza for into consideration, at least enough to make a safek bracha, which is why he suggests to avoid smelling it.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna Berurah ends off with pointing to the rule if one makes a stipulation:\n ועיין בב\"י בשם הרשב\"א לענין תנאי אם מהני בהדס ועיין בסימן תרס\"ד ס\"ט:</p>\n\n<p>See the Beis Yosef in the name of the Rashba if a stipulation will help by Haddasim, brought in siman 664, siff 9.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that this discussion is concerning the time of mitzvah usage of the esrog. Smelling it before and after is discussed in the Mishna Berurah there as well:</p>\n\n<p>בעת נטילתו למצוה אבל קודם או אח\"כ להריח בו לכו\"ע יכול לברך וי\"א דיש למנוע כל שבעת הימים ועיין לעיל בסימן רי\"ו שם ביארנו כל פרטי הדין:</p>\n\n\n",

It can be found in the Rav Menachem Kasher edition of Sefer Kol HaTor entitled \"HaTekufah HaGadolah\". It was published in 1972 and is still available in print. This schedule is also discussed in Sefer Kol HaTor.\nThe Arutz Sheva article in question was actually quoting Rav Yitzchok Kaduri, zt\"l, who said what you have mentioned. Rav Kaduri said the 3rd and final stage of the war of Gog u'Magog began on October 7th,  Hoshana Rabba of the year 2001 with commencement of the bombing of the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nThe link is:\n<a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/91417\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/91417</a></p>\n<p>The information is accurate and correct.

For those who remember, the nascent Sanhedrin produced a scroll that was to be delivered to then President George Bush warning him that he was the one foretold in the Prophets in the Tanach as being Gog mi'Gog. This scroll warned clearly that Bush needed to support Israel or G-d would deal with him severely.

The commentary is called \"Biyurim v'Haga'ot HaGra\". I also checked his commentary \"Kol Eliyahu\" on Tanach. It is possible there is some larger, more comprehensive commentary.</p>\n<p>What I have found is only an explanation of what the Mechilta itself says. Namely that the final redemption will parallel the redemption from Egypt. In this particular case, the splitting of the Red Sea and all the details of this are associated with the final stage of the conflict in the War of Gog miGog. This is explicitly associated with chapter 60 of Isaiah at the beginning. It also relates this to what happened with the judgement of Sodom and Gemorrah.</p>\n<p>A little later in the Mechilta it mentions the view of Rabbi Eliezer who says that although the exodus from Egypt was in the month of Nisan, for various reasons, the final redemption will be in Tishrei. The Gra there doesn't say how he holds. He just explains Rabbi Eliezer's reasoning.</p>\n<p>The judgement of the nations is sealed and execution begins from Hoshannah Rabbah. That is the explicit teaching of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai as found in the Zohar on parshat Tzav.</p>\n<p>So in context, if this judgement with Gog u'Magog parallels the timing of the splitting of the Red Sea, it would seem to be shortly before daybreak.</p>\n<p>Looking simply at the timing, the beginning of the bombing in Afghanistan in the 2nd Gulf War started the night of Hoshannah Rabbah. That complies with the plain meaning from the Mechilta as understood by the Vilna Gaon.</p>\n<p>This is also the explanation of how the final redemption unfolds as discussed in Sefer Avkat Rochel of Rabbi Makir ben Abba Mari, volume 1, Wars of King Moshiach, 8th sign. This is also brought in Targum Yonatan ben Uziel on Devarim 34:3.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is Hallel different in Sukkot and Pesach (chol ha-moed)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During <em>chol ha-moed</em> (intermediate days) of Sukkot we recite a full Hallel but during chol ha-moed of Pesach (and also Rosh Chodesh and some other days) we recite a \"half Hallel\" (really more like <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/15842/472\">85% hallel</a>).  Sukkot and Pesach are both <em>chagim</em> (festivals) and so I would naively expect them to have the same liturgical status.  Why the difference?  I can think of a couple possibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>An unanswered <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/57199/472\">question</a> suggests that Pesach Hallel is restricted because of the fallen Egyptians (according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zedekiah_ben_Abraham_Anaw\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shibolei Haleket (Zedekiah ben Abraham Anaw)</a>.  But, as noted in that question, we don't do that for the festival (<em>chag</em>) days in Pesach, which seems unusual if that's the reason.  Also, if this is the reason, is there a <em>different</em> reason for reducing the Rosh Chodesh Hallel?<sup>1</sup></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Perhaps <em>chol ha-moed</em> \"should\" have the reduced Hallel for both, but Sukkot is <em>zman simchateinu</em> (the time of our rejoicing) so we increase our joy by increasing Hallel.  I've never heard anybody make that argument; I'm just guessing here.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Can anybody provide a sourced explanation for why Hallel varies between the two <em>chol ha-moed</em> periods?  If along the way an answer also explains why Rosh Chodesh is treated the way it is that'd be great, though my primary question is about the <em>chagim</em>.</p>\n<p><sup>1</sup> Except in Chanukah, according to the siddur I used this morning.  I might ask a separate question about that.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The Talmud asks this question. The Yerushalmi (Sukkah 5:1) answers simply that Hallel is read all week on Sukkot due to the ongoing Mitzva of the Lulav (which is taken and waved during Hallel). The Bavli (Arachin 10) answers that since each day of Sukkot has its own unique Korban Musaf (the number of bulls changes each day, cf. Numbers 29) then in a certain way each day is its own holiday with its own Hallel, unlike Pesach which has the same Korban Musaf every day (Numbers 28:24) for which one Hallel suffices. See <a href=\"http://koltorah.org/ravj/12-8%20Chatzi%20Hallel.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> where R Chaim Soloveitchik is cited as ruling that one needs one Hallel for all the days of Pesach, and if one missed saying it on the first day, he says it on any subsequent day. (Note that adding \"half Hallel\" on any day is a later custom as a way to mark days which are special but don't have a formal Hallel obligation.)</p>\n\n<p>See too <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/tzarich-iyun/tzarich_iyun_hallel_on_pesach/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article on the subject</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Mishnah Berurah (Orahh Hayim, Siman 644, Se'if Qatan 4) <a href=\"http://www.mishnaberurayomi.org/pdf_pages/Chelek_6/0218_Siman_644_Seif_1-2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states</a> (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וכן כל שמונת ימי החג</strong>\nולא הוי דחול המועד פסח דמדלגין משום דבסוכות כל יום חשוב כיום טוב בפני עצמו, כיון שחלוק קרבנותיו מיום שלפניו</p>\n<p><strong>And thus all eight days of the festival</strong>\nAnd therefore unlike Hol HaMo'ed Pesahh during which we skip [certain passages of Hallel]; because, during Sukkot, each day is given the importance of a Yom Tov in and of itself since its sacrifices are distinct from the sacrifices of the day before it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I see you're active on The Workplace Stack Exchange. Consider the word \"401(k)\". (The noun, referring to an account, not the proper noun, referring to a subsection of IRS code.) Try to translate it into a language that has no concept of such a thing. You'd have to use either a rough approximation to what you mean or a whole explanation rather than a simple word. The same is true for a bunch of words you'll find in Jewish books.</p></li>\n<li><p>Even without specialty words, translation is hard. Here are two examples:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The set of verb tenses in Biblical Hebrew doesn't correspond exactly to the set of verb tenses in English.</p></li>\n<li><p>Some Hebrew verb forms act sometimes like English adjectives or agent nouns, and the question is, e.g., whether to translate \"<a href=\"http://www.morfix.co.il/en/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow\">מורגל</a>\" as \"is accustomed\" (adjective) or as \"has become accustomed\" (verb form).</p></li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>As mentioned above, there aren't any general prohibitions (per se) on translating Jewish texts into the vernacular, be it English, French, Russian, Yiddish, etc. </p>\n\n<h2>Regarding Text on This Site</h2>\n\n<p>Many posts and answers here are among those for whom Hebrew is not a foreign language. Many of this site's users know each other (at least virtually) and are aware of each others' levels of knowledge. Things left untranslated are usually done so not to lock others out, but instead to save time. If I know that user A readily understands Hebrew, I might not bother translating an entire passage to English in the interest of saving time. </p>\n\n<p>Feel free to comment on questions and answers which leave texts untranslated to  prompt the authors to translate them for the world at large. </p>\n\n<h2>Regarding Entire Jewish Texts</h2>\n\n<p>The main reason something might not have been translated into the vernacular is usually based on demand and desire for said title. For example, you probably won't be able to find Yosef Karo's Shulchan Aruch translated into English. You probably also won't find the Rema's commentary to the Shulchan Aruch translated into English. However, because there is a big demand for understanding contemporary Jewish law, you'll find a translation of the Mishnah Berurah (which probably contains the original quotes from Shulchan Aruch and the Rema's commentary) and the Shulchan Aruch HaRav (which also probably contains the original sources translated). </p>\n\n<p>The companies that translate these titles operate on supply and demand. Gemara is a primary text, so there are more than one translation of it widely available in English. The five books of Moses are also very primary, so you'll find many translations available there. </p>\n\n<p>When you get to certain titles, e. g. Etz Chaim and the Zohar, much knowledge about other Jewish literature is assumed to be within the reader's grasp. A good example of a similar text translated is the Likkutei Moharan, the magnum opus of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov. <a href=\"http://breslov.org\">Breslov Research Institute</a> finished translating the entire sefer, which in Hebrew is around 200-300 pages, only a couple years ago. The project took <em>30 years</em>, and not for lack of funding. Since Likkutei Moharan assumes knowledge in Tanach (Torah, Neviim, Kesuvim), Rabbinical literature (Midrashim, Gemara, Yerushalmi, etc.), Halacha (Rishonim, Shulchan Aruch), and Kabbalah (e.g. the Zohar, Etz Chaim), <em>simple</em> phrases in the Hebrew require vast amounts of commentary to explain their meaning.</p>\n\n<p>In this example, if you were to simply possess the ability to read Hebrew fluently, you would still find Likkutei Moharan to require enormous amounts of contemplation to understand. Though many things are made evident in the sefer and it's easy enough to follow along, you'd be missing the <em>context</em> of the sefer in light of everything else. </p>\n\n<p>In summary, a title may not be translated and readily available in the vernacular for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There isn't enough demand for it, i.e. there are more pressing Jewish texts to immediately translate.  </li>\n<li>It would require an enormous amount of work to translate while trying to maintain the idioms and context in which it was written.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For these two reasons, a lot of onus is put on the reader to do his best to begin learning Hebrew and Jewish texts, as it opens doors to the entire world of Jewish literature, rather than individual doors to individual works. For some people, learning Hebrew is exceedingly difficult, and in that case, readers will have to await (and demand!) translations of the texts they wish to study.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>While the Hebrew language is indeed considered Holy, it is not the reason most things are not translated on this site. In my opinion, it has to do with the assumptions of the writer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible Assumption #1:</strong> That if you are asking a very specific questions, then you must be knowledgeable enough to read or translate for yourself the specific answer that you receive. Therefore I don't need to spend the time translating.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible Assumption #2:</strong> That if you aren't able to translate or read the answer for yourself, that's not my fault, you need to get more educated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible Assumption #3:</strong> Since Hebrew doesn't always translate well into English, and many of us have varying levels of Hebrew reading ability. The answer poster may not feel confident in his ability to translate and fears his translation may be slightly incorrect enough to lead the person reading it astray.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible assumption #4:</strong> The Hebrew is very precise and something would get lost in translation, even by an expert translator -- technical terms, figures of speech and textual references that convey subtleties can't be translated.</p>\n\n<p>And outside of all these things, it could simply be that the poster doesn't have the time or doesn't want to spend the effort translating the answer and leaves it for later or for others to edit and translate for him.</p>\n\n\n",

These Church Fathers lived in the early to mid Amoraic period and personally knew some of the sages and often came to them with questions about scripture and Judaism in general.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Origen</a> wrote in his <a href=\"https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0414.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Letter to Africanus</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...And I make it my endeavour not to be ignorant of their [the Jews'] various readings, lest in my controversies with the Jews I should quote to them what is not found in their copies, and that I may make some use of what is found there, even although it should not be in our Scriptures. For if we are so prepared for them in our discussions, they will not, as is their manner, scornfully laugh at Gentile believers for their ignorance of the true reading as they have them. So far as to the History of Susanna not being found in the Hebrew [the Jewish scriptures]...Moreover, I remember hearing from a learned Hebrew, said among themselves to be the son of a wise man, and to have been specially trained to succeed his father, with whom I had intercourse on many subjects, the names of these elders, just as if he did not reject the History of Susanna, as they occur in Jeremias as follows: The Lord make you like Zedekias and Achiab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire, for the iniquity they did in Israel...And I knew another Hebrew, who told about these elders such traditions as the following: that they pretended to the Jews in captivity...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We find that Jews in the time of Origen were familiar with the story of Susanna, and some even had a tradition that the two judges in the story were actually Tzidkiyahu ben Ma'asiyahu and Achav ben Koliyah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.29.21?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 29:21</a>). Ever-zealous to the Christian faith, Origen then proceeds to invent a reason as to why that story isn't included in Daniel. According to him, the Jewish sages removed it in order to not smear the names of the Jewish elders.</p>\n<p>However, another Church Father, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jerome</a>, in his commentary on <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?redir_esc=y&id=uLRLgT-wXgIC&q=ahab#v=snippet&q=ahab&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu</a>, gave the real reason as he heard it from the sages of his time (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Hebrews say that these men who \"committed foolishness in Israel\" and \"committed adultery with the wives of their fellow citizens\" are the elders to whom Daniel spoke...But what is said in the present passage, \"whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,\" appears to contradict the <em>historia of Daniel</em>, which asserts that the elders were stoned to death by the people as a result of Daniel's judgement, whereas here it is written that the king of Babylon roasted them in the fire. For this reason, <strong>this story is rejected as a mere fable by many of us and by almost all of the Hebrews; nor do they read it in their synagogues. \"For how could it be,\" it is argued, \"that captives had the authority to stone their own leaders and prophets?</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly, though, the story wasn't entirely rejected in later generations:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Zacuto\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Avraham Zacuto</a> wrote in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=5900&hilite=1783e490-fd04-4198-9ede-4cc2cd86e181&st=%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94&pgnum=301\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Yochasin</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...דניאל בשנת תר\"ס התחיל כשנחרב בית המקדש. ואז בגלות בבל היתה המעשה שושנה בת חלקיה אשת יויקים והיתה יפה מאוד...ואז דניאל בחכמתו ובנבואה הצילה...ואז הרגו לזקנים. ואולי היה זה לאחאב בן קוליה וצדקיה בן מעשיה שקלם מלך בבל באש...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"...Daniel in the year 660 started out when the Temple was destroyed.

For His mercy is great toward us, and the truth of the Lord endures forever, halleluya” (Psalms 117). Hananiah recited: “Praise the Lord, all you nations,” for the overt miracle performed for them before the nations.

Said Nevuchadnetzar to Daniel: \"How great is its strength that it is able to swallow anything thrown at it?\" Answered Daniel: \"Give me permission and I shall weaken it.\" He permitted it. What did Daniel do? He took hay and mixed in it nails which pierced its intestines, as it is said: \"And [I will] make him disgorge what he has swallowed.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For this, it seems to me that these stories were known by the Jews - but they also knew that they weren't actually written prophetically by the Men of the Great Assembly, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.15a.2?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">those who authored Daniel</a>. Therefore, these later additions seem to have been embellishments of these earlier traditions.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The answer is that when Jews stopped speaking Greek, and therefore stopped relying on the Septuagint, these books/chapters fell away and were retroactively deemed heretical/not a part of Judaism. A similar situation occurred with other books such as Sefer Hanoch (The Book of Enoch)  and the book of Jubilees.

He had indeed Monobazus, his elder brother, by Helena also, as he had other sons by other wives besides. Yet did he openly place all his affections on this his only begotten son Izates...However, he sent Izates, with many presents, to Abennerig, the king of Charax- Spasini, and that out of the great dread he was in about him, lest he should come to some misfortune by the hatred his brethren bore him; and he committed his son's preservation to him. Upon which Abennerig gladly received the young man, and had a great affection for him, and married him to his own daughter, whose name was Samacha: he also bestowed a country upon him, from which he received large revenues.</p>\n<p>But when Monobazus was grown old, and saw that he had but a little time to live, he had a mind to come to the sight of his son before he died. So he sent for him, and embraced him after the most affectionate manner, and bestowed on him the country called Carra...Accordingly, Izates abode in that country until his father's death... So queen Helena complied with this counsel of theirs, and set up Monobazus, the eldest son, to be king, and put the diadem upon his head, and gave him his father's ring, with its signet; as also the ornament which they call Sampser, and exhorted him to administer the affairs of the kingdom till his brother should come; who came suddenly upon hearing that his father was dead, and succeeded his brother Monobazus, who resigned up the government to him.</p>\n<p>Now, during the time Izates abode at Charax-Spasini, a certain Jewish merchant, whose name was Ananias, got among the women that belonged to the king, and taught them to worship God according to the Jewish religion. He, moreover, by their means, became known to Izates, and persuaded him, in like manner, to embrace that religion; he also, at the earnest entreaty of Izates, accompanied him when he was sent for by his father to come to Adiabene; it also happened that Helena, about the same time, was instructed by a certain other Jew and went over to them. But when Izates had taken the kingdom, and was come to Adiabene...</p>\n<p>And when he perceived that his mother was highly pleased with the Jewish customs, he made haste to change, and to embrace them entirely; and as he supposed that he could not be thoroughly a Jew unless he were circumcised, he was ready to have it done. But when his mother understood what he was about, she endeavored to hinder him from doing it, and said to him that this thing would bring him into danger; and that, as he was a king, he would thereby bring himself into great odium among his subjects, when they should understand that he was so fond of rites that were to them strange and foreign; and that they would never bear to be ruled over by a Jew...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here we see that, at least according to Josephus, the final conversion of Heleni and her son Izates (and later Munbaz II joined them) seems to have taken place only after the death of Munbaz I, Heleni's brother and husband.</p>\n<p>However, the question may still stand based on the phrasing Josephus uses when describing Heleni's conversion process: \"it also happened that Helena, about the same time, was instructed by a certain other Jew <strong>and went over to them</strong>\" - from here it sounds that Heleni converted prior to the death of her husband, while Izates converted only after becoming king, after his father died.</p>\n<p>Ben Tzion Luria wrote an essay in Hebrew called \"The Kingdom of Khadayev\". In it he examines both Josephus, the Tanach and Chazalic sources to understand the build of both the kingdom and its Jewish community:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"There's no doubt that the main influence on the development of the spiritual character of Izates came to him during the years he settled in Meishan. It was not the meeting with the Jewish merchant Chananyah through the women of the court, completely detached from the rest of the world - as was a must in the governing of the harem in the ancient eastern country - that brought the young prince to think differently than his forefathers thought about issues of religion and society. Most assuredly Izates met with many Jews in the city of Spasinos and the settlements of Meishan, came to know their way of life and found that their way and way of thought on life and faith in it was born and raised...</p>\n<p>Meishan was a land of swamps...her citizens were Arabs...from Rav Huna...we have a halacha that relates to the Jews of Meishan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rav Huna said: With regard to those small boats of Meishan, which are wide on top and narrow at the bottom, one may carry in them only within four cubits. Because they are less than four handbreadths wide at the bottom, they are not a private domain. And we only said this halakha in a case where the width of the boat does not reach four handbreadths less than three handbreadths from the bottom of the boat. However, if the width of the boat reaches four handbreadths less than three handbreadths from the bottom, we do not have this halakha, as those are considered full-fledged partitions which create a private domain. And, similarly, if one fills the bottom of the boat with reeds and thin willow branches up to the point where the boat reaches four handbreadths, we do not have this halakha. If there are ten handbreadths above the point where the boat reaches four handbreadths, it is a private domain.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.101a.2?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 101a</a>)...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the sages of the generation saw fit to make a special halacha with regards to the boats of Meishan, that means that those boats were part of the day to day lives of the Jewish community members...we would not be wrong in assuming that the Jews for whom this halacha was made were long time residents in that place, and perhaps even came here before the beginning of the first century, they came before Izates when he came to be educated in the city of Spasinos...</p>\n<p>We have already said that in the second generation of Amoraim, Meishan was shamed for not properly keeping the halacha of familial and racial purity and it seems that in many cases the Jews of the city of Spasinos wed women of the land. On this fault Chazal speak about a number of times:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Gemara asks: How far does the border extend downward, meaning southward, on the Tigris? Rav Shmuel said: Until the city of Lower Appamya. The Gemara comments: There are two cities called Appamya, the upper one and the lower one. In terms of the lineage of their residents, one is unflawed and the other is flawed, and they are separated by a distance of a parasang [parsa]. And they are particular with regard to one another. The residents of the two cities avoid each other to the extent that they do not even loan each other fire, to prevent them from developing a closeness with each other. And your mnemonic to remember which is which is that the unfit one is that one that speaks the Mishon dialect. As stated above, Mishon is considered dead with regard to lineage.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.71b.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 71b</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And on the fury of Chazal towards Meishan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Ten kav of brazenness descended to the world; Meishan, near Babylonia, took nine and the rest of the world took one.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.49b.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 49b</a>)...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the eyes of the sages of Bavel, all the marriages of the Jews of Meishan with the gentile women were invalid and causing impurity in the Jewish race, and their reasoning was with them. But it would be different if we would look at the issue from the perspective of the role of the woman from Meishan, daughter of an Arab tribe who stood in a low developmental state in terms of culture and society. With comparison to the advanced Hellenistic world of the time, for such a woman to marry a Jew was to be a social advancement, for it is known that the Jewish familial life was quiet and fair and the role of the woman prominent and this always drew the hearts of the gentile women, so it would not surprise us therefore that Judaism spread through Meishan first among the women...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Luria then provides evidence that the kingdom Izates first received was the city of Charan. There may have not necessarily been Jews in Charan at the time, but certainly in the nearby Netzivin, which had an important beit midrash headed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehudah_ben_Beseirah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehudah ben Bateirah</a>.</p>\n<p>Then Luria writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And now that we know the circumference of the country of Khadayev in the time of Munbaz I, we are permitted to assume that Judaism penetrated into the royal court not by Chanayah the merchant and Izates his student, and not by Elazar, the sage from the Galilee. It is simple to see that conversion became a general phenomenon, based on the influence of the many Jews that lived in the country.</p>\n<p>According to what is told in the Talmud, the two brothers Munbaz and Izates...each circumcised without his brother knowing about it and the Queen also converted separately. Between the lines of what Josephus wrote we can learn that the entire nation was divided into two: The Royal Family, the people of the court and many of the nation became Jewish, but the idolatrous priests and masses of the people, in particular in areas where the Jewish influence was weak, remained strong in their old faith. At first, the group of converts was weak and therefore didn't make themselves and their actions known, this moderation was led by Chananyah...later...the King and the converts overcame the idolatrous group.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Josephus wrote (<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link32HCH0015\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Antiquities of the Jews, Book 3, ch. 15</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"There are also many other demonstrations that his power was more than human, for still some there have been, who have come from the parts beyond Euphrates, a journey of four months, through many dangers, and at great expenses, in honor of our temple; and yet, when they had offered their oblations, could not partake of their own sacrifices, because Moses had forbidden it, by somewhat in the law that did not permit them, or somewhat that had befallen them, which our ancient customs made inconsistent therewith; some of these did not sacrifice at all, and others left their sacrifices in an imperfect condition; many were not able, even at first, so much as to enter the temple, but went their ways in this as preferring a submission to the laws of Moses before the fulfilling of their own inclinations, they had no fear upon them that anybody could convict them, but only out of a reverence to their own conscience.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this Luria writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"There is no doubt that what is referred to here are converts from Khadayev, who came to Yerushalayim and requested to sacrifice their sacrifices. But they did not follow the law and for this they were unable to do so.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From all of this, it seems that the Jews of Khadayev, and in particular, the converts of Khadayev, were not very knowledgeable in Judaism, and in particular in terms of familial and racial purity, much like the Jews of Meishan. Therefore, it's actually quite likely that Heleni was not aware of all of the d'rabanan laws while living in Khadayev during the lifetime of her husband. Only later, long after her conversion and the death of her husband, did she come to one of the great centers of halacha, Yerushalayim, and learn all she had missed out on. By that time, it seems that her status as the wife of her brother was no longer relevant.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=5&rtype=%u05E6%u05D5%u05E8%u05EA%20%u05D4%u05D3%u05E3&hilchos=27&perek=14&halocha=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Issurei Biah 14:10</a> and <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&rtype=%25u05E6%25u05D5%25u05E8%25u05EA%20%25u05D4%25u05D3%25u05E3&hilchos=83&perek=9&halocha=5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 9:5</a>, based on Sanhedrin 58a-b) writes that brother-sister relations among Bnei Noach are forbidden only if they share the same mother.

Hofni (subtitle, ‘Zichron HaGaon Rav Shmuel ben Hofni U’sfarav’ <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32034&st=&pgnum=6&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">p. 4</a>) and proposed that the aforementioned work served as a precursor for RS HaNagid’s <em>mevo</em> (Harkavy referenced <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Judah_Loeb_Rapoport\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ShIR</a> who surmised the same) but no certain conclusions could’ve been drawn as long as the original treatise was lost and internal evidence unable to be ascertained. Then came the discovery of the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_Geniza\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Cairo Genizah</a> trove. </p>\n\n<p>One of the documents identified in the <em>genizah</em> was this treatise written in Arabic. After examining its content, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cowley_(librarian)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Arthur Cowley</a> published an extract of it (Zichron LeAvraham Eliyahu <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36672&st=&pgnum=211\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pp. 161</a>) and, based on the similarity of the material between the two <em>mevo’ot</em>, determined that it was none other than the source for the later compiled ‘<em>mevo</em> of R. Shmuel HaNagid’, the latter being an abridged Hebrew translation of the former. Later on, <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/margaliot-margulies-mordecai\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mordechai Margaliot</a> published ‘Sefer Hilchot HaNagid’ and agreed  (Intro., 68ff.) that RS b. Hofni’s work was the archetype but disagreed with the idea that it was RS HaNagid who had compile the later <em>mevo</em> and instead advanced Sambari’s claim, ascribing authorship to RS b. Hananya, arguing that provenance to the contrary is unreliable and supposed stylistic and linguistic inconsistencies also prove otherwise. <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/abramson-shraga\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shraga Abramson</a> (Sinai, vol. <em>C</em> pp. 22) agreed that the <em>mevo</em> commonly known as being from R. Shmuel HaNagid is only but a very abridged-translated version and “certainly improper to ascribe [such a work] to any important rabbi” (“וזה ודאי אינו ראוי לייחס לשום חכם חשוב”), although he disagreed with Margaliot as being from R. Shmuel b. Hananya and dismissed Margaliot’s proofs as “<em>shikul ha’daat</em>” (“his own discretion”; i.e. short of critical evidence) leaving the question of authorship unsolved and apparently only considered that the original treatise was by R. Shmuel b. Hofni.</p>\n\n\n",

See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46442&pgnum=347\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nitei Gavriel Sukkot  Chapter 73, Halacha 18</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Chabad Custom (as brought in footnote 31) is not to say any Hoshaanot on Shabbat, and make it up the next day, but not to go around the Bimah for that one, only for the Hoshaanot of Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>In a situation such as this year and next year (5776 and 5777), Hoshaanah Rabbah falls out on a Sunday. This means that Shabbat's Hoshaana will already be said on Sunday, during the Hoshaana Rabbah service. </p>\n\n<p>If so, are the Hoshaanot for Shabbat repeated before the Hoshaana Rabbah service is started?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Take a look at the weekly <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org.il/Magazines/Article.asp?ArticleID=12784&CategoryID=2106\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">'Hiskashrus' magazine - issue 1161 - 19 Tishrei 5777</a></p>\n\n<p>In the 'weekly calendar' section - which deals with the customs pertaining to the week to come - the following is written regarding the Hoshanot</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>:הושענות</p>\n  \n  <p>מוציאים את כל ספרי-התורה שבהיכל, ועומדים עמם ליד הבימה. אומרים(29) את ז'\n  ההושענות, ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>then in footnote 29:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>י\"א שהבחינו בהו\"ר תשנ\"ב (שחל ביום א' כבשנה זו) שהרבי אמר תחילה את ההושענא שהיתה אמורה להיות בש\"ק 'אדמה מארר', כמ\"ש בס' המנהגים לגבי כל\n  יום א' שאחרי שבת חוה\"מ, שצריך לומר בתחילת ההושענות את ההושענא דיום\n  השבת. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So inside - it only refers to the hoshanot which are said on Hoshana Raba. However, the footnote mentions that some say that in the year 5752 (where Hoshana Raba also fell on a Sunday) they saw the Rebbe first complete the Hoshanot of Shabbat and only then continued with the Hoshanot of Hoshana Raba.</p>\n\n<p>So although that still seems rather inconclusive, it seems that the general consensus is not to say the Hoshanot from shabbat in such a kviut.

And that before Eve and Adam ate from the Tree of Knowledge, people too related to time in a more complete way. Or, as our sages put it, the original Adam and similarly a baby prior to being born into a body \"could see from one end of the universe to the other\" -- which Rav Dessler presumes includes time as well.

We are never told when water was created; its existence (as well as darkness, Hashem's \"Spirit\", shamayim and aretz [left untranslated intentionally]). \"Perforce you must [conclude that] the scripture doesn't teach anything about the order of earlier and later.\"</p>\n<p>On Ber' 2:4 s.v. \"Soldos haShamayim veHaaretz beHibar'am beYom Asos Hashem\", Rashi writes two comments. The second is homoletic (about how the world was created with the letter hei), but the first addresses the verse saying \"These are the consequences of shamayim and eretz when they were created <em>on the day</em> The first is \"למדך שכלם נבראו בראשון -- to teach you they were all created at the beginning.</p>\n<p>Which would seem to mean that while the first Rashi just says the Torah doesn't tell us the order in which creation occurs, this Rashi is saying there was in fact no chronological order at all.

The operative word in Hebrew is <em>bara</em> which means either to create something from nothing (Rambam, Rashi, et al) or to make order out of disordered [or, un-ordered] material (Ramban, Ralbag, et al). The creation of mankind was general and not specific, as man was more or less a sophisticated animal at this point (Sforno) and it DOES NOT refer to <em>Adham</em> and <em>Hawwa</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Bereshith</em> 2:4-2:25 is the microcosm of the \"garden\" specifically, as is evident by the specific geographical information specifying the site of <em>gan eden</em> as in Mesopotamia/Sumeria. The operative word here is not <em>bara</em>, but rather <em>yassar</em> which means to \"form\" a new type of something from a similar previous type (Ramban). So, man was \"formed\" first (i.e. changed from primitive man into an enlightened spiritual man - Ramban, Sforno) and then the animals were \"formed\" (i.e. domestic animals were \"formed\" from wild ones). Further indication is the repeated appelation \"of the field\", which also indicates its agrarian-specific context.

Doing Mitzvhas. I cannot see how naming animals can be a Mitzvha or helpful for performing Mitzvahs. I remember seeing they were brought so that Adam would see he needs a new existence to support him (as implied in 2,20). However, naming the animals isn't necessary for that. Even if we explain the naming corresponds to the true meaning of each animal etc. the way the Torha portrays Hashem bringing the animals is like \"Oh well, let's see how is gonna call 'em\".

His words read:</p>\n\n<p>\"ולא שייך בישיבתו בה לומר היאך נעשנו חול שכך דרך בני אדם לפעמים לישב בצל סוכה אפילו שלא לשם מצוה\".</p>\n\n<p>However, the Tur in the very beginning of hilchos succah, siman 625, also asked why do we sit in succos in the fall and not the spring when we actually left Egypt?  The answer given is that people normally sit in booths in the springtime so our sitting there would not be apparent as done for a mitzvah. We therefore wait until the fall when everyone leaves their booths and goes into their houses, whereupon we go sit in booths when nobody else does, to show it is only for the mitzvah. His words again:</p>\n\n<p>\"ואף על פי שהוציאנו ממצרים בחודש ניסן לא צונו לעשות סוכה באותו הזמן לפי שהוא ימות הקיץ ודרך כל אדם לעשות סוכה לצל ולא היתה ניכרת עשייתנו בהם שהם במצות הבורא יתברך ולכן צוה אותנו שנעשה סוכות בחודש השביעי שהוא זמן הגשמים ודרך כל אדם לצאת מסוכתו ולישב בביתו ואנחנו יוצאים מן הבית לישב בסוכה בזה יראה לכל שמצות המלך היא עלינו לעשותה\".</p>\n\n<p>How do these two statements coexist? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The way I understood the Tur  is that its not about the weather. The weather in Tishrai and Nissan are around the same. The issue is the BUILDING of the Sukka. People generally do not buy patio furniture to sit outside in the fall.  You generally build your outdoor huts in the spring because the spring is the start of good weather. The fall is the end of it so why would you take the time to build it in the  Fall?</p>\n\n<p>Both statements easily coexist because the statement of the bal tosef is just about sitting, not building.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I saw a very nice explanation of the Tur <a href=\"https://naalehupdate.wordpress.com/2011/10/10/why-is-succos-in-tishrei-as-opposed-to-nissan/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. While the author is coming to answer a slightly different question there, the answers there, especially the second answer, would answer your question as well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are two possible approaches to the Tur. One is that although the weather is pleasant, the rainy season is close and it does rain sometimes. Hashem could have worked it out the weather was even better, that Succos would have been celebated during the best time to go out to the succah. And, since sometimes it does rain and a person would not go out into the booth when it rains, therefore it shows that it is for the sake of the mitzvah. Even if the weather is pleasant at this time of year, it would still be less apparent in the spring that we are building succahs for the sake of the mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The other possibility is that we have to take a new approach to what the Tur meant. It could be that the Tur’s focus is not that the rainy weather already has begun at the time of Succos. But rather that the rainy season is imminent. In the spring, when it is beginning to get hot, it is normal for a person to go outside and build a booth, which he will then use as his summer home, his summer bungalow, for the hot spring and summer. However, a person would not leave his home and build a bungalow in order to use it for a week or two and then run back into the house when the rain begins. That is what is strange about going out into succot now. It is not that the weather is presently unpleasant, but rather it is very close to the beginning of the rainy season. Therefore, it is clear that a person is going out for the sake of a mitzvah and not due to personal conveniences based on the weather conditions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The actual words of the Tur/Rosh which you quoted seem to answer themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Here is how I see the plain meaning:</p>\n\n<p>The Tur/Rosh says that the general concept of scheduling the Sukkos holiday for 7 days was to be in the \"rainy season\". This would show that the holiday is Divinely mandated because normal people wouldn't schedule a week's vacation camping in booths during a rainy season as opposed to springtime.</p>\n\n<p>However, if during those seven days, there are days where it did not rain,(because rain days exempt one from the Sukkah anyway) then it is perfectly normal for a man to sit in a booth in the fall season for enjoyment. The fact that such unscheduled sitting in booths occurs during the fall, is enough to remove the stigma associated with bal tosef. (However, all agree that no one sits in a booth at all in the winter.)</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, outside, of Israel, since we are not sure which day was the 1st day of Succot, I would think that this would mean that we should sit in the succah for eight days. Thus, if that's true, why should there be a debate about this. Furthermore, since sitting in the succah is a Torah commandment, following the rule of <em>safel brachot D'Oraitah lehacmir</em>, (in cases of making blessings related to a Torah-bound mitzvah, we are stringent), it seems that we should be making the bracha on this, as well. So, why don't we do this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The most basic explanation of the issue is that the day becomes a tarti disasri, a self contradiction. How can it be both the last day of Succos and Shmini Atzeres?  </p>\n\n<p>I've heard many drashos trying to explain in depth what the issue is to actually enjoin it as a multiplicity of days, but I will offer one that seems simple. </p>\n\n<p>The wording used in the Tur siman 668 as to why we don't make a blessing on sitting in the succah is \" ואין מברכין על ישיבתה שאם כן היינו עושין אותו חול. We don't make a blessing on sitting in it, because we will then have made it mundane.\"</p>\n\n<p>Seemingly, the issue is not that the day will then be both the holiday of Succos and the holiday of Shmini Atzeres, this would not be a problem if both days were actual holy days. The problem is that the last day of Succos is in fact Chol Hamoed, thereby less holy than the actual holiday of Shmini Atzeres. We cannot have a day that is both holy and unholy. </p>\n\n<p>Other drashos have revolved around Shmini Atzeres and being so intrinsically connected that mixing them is a bigger issue than mixing say Chanukah and Shmini Atzeres would be. </p>\n\n<p>Of course to what degree one takes issue with this contradiction of days is how various minhagim were established, don't sit in the succah at all, sit during the day not the night, sit without a bracha, or sit with a bracha. See the Mishna Berurah in the aforementioned siman.</p>\n\n\n",

It was multicolored and had cherubim on it.</p>\n\n<p>The second one mentioned was the one in the First Temple, briefly described in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16552#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Divrei HaYamim 2/II Chronicles 3:14</a> as also being multicolored and having cherubim on it.</p>\n\n<p>The third ones I could find mention of are the veils that were in Herod's Temple, as described in <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/war-5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Josephus' Jewish War Book 5 Chapter 5</a>.  Oddly enough, he only says there was \"a veil\" separating the middle part from the Holy of Holies, but he DOES do a good job describing the extremely well-wrought \"Babylonian\" curtain separating the first room of the Temple from the second.</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could accurately answer the question in regards to decorated curtains in Synagogues, but I could not find any information on them in any of my archaeological literature.  They have found Torah ark niches and lintels that once were part of the arks themselves in various excavations, but no trace of the curtains themselves - woven materials decompose a lot faster than stone or floor mosaics. The synagogues' decorative stones and mosaics often have images of Temple implements on them, so it seems logical to me that our forebears would decorate their Torah Ark curtains, in imitation of the Temples' and Mishkan's, and they're most likely a very old tradition.</p>\n\n\n",

Levush states that anyone who goes moe than 3 days without reading Torah has enemies attacking him. Therefore, not only were these days established as days to read Torah, but also, these are days when you increase supplications which includes among them, Tachanun, Av Harachamim before reading the Torah, and the Yehi Ratzon after reading the Torah. The point being, that it has nothing directly to do with Tachanun, but is a=included in the notion of increasing requests on supplications on Mondays and Thursdays.</p>\n\n<p>I would posit, therefore, that on Yom Tov, Rosh Hodesh, and other celebratory days, when there is a Torah reading, that Torah reading would occur regardless of which day of the week it is. No Tachanun is said on those days, anyway, and we are also pre-empting the normal parsha reading that's usually done on Monday's and Thursdays. Also, the celebratory nature of the day, would override the necessity or appropriateness of these extra supplications.</p>\n\n\n",

This is said at the meal. It doesn't offer a proof of making a kiddish like for Yom Tov. But clearly indicates that a meal that is distinct to that day is made.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the minhag of Spinka as it relates both to Sukkot and Hoshannah Rabbah, it can be found in Sefer Eish Tamid which was written by the 2nd Rebbe of Spinka, Admor Yitzchok Isaac Weiss, the author of Chakal Yitzchok. There in chapter 60, pg 343:4-5, chapter 62, pg 346:2 and chapter 63:352:14, it says that for all the days of the chag after the first day of the Yom Tov, they do not make the blessing of \"leishev b'Sukkah\" except for 15 times corresponding to the 15 required meals. It explains that this is to fulfill the required obligation to eat 14 meals according to the view of the Tanna Kama, Rabbi Eliezer in the Mishnah in Sukkah 27a.</p>\n\n<p>The details of \"seudah kavuah\", the fixed obligatory meal of the festival mean bread, wine and meat. This follows the explanation of Rambam in Sefer HaMitzvot, positive mitzvot, mitzvah 54 which says that the concept of rejoicing in your festival, one of the specific commandments for Sukkot, is to eat meat and drink wine. This is also brought in Sefer Ta'amei HaMinhagim v'Makorei HaDinim, pg 345:787. It explains that the concept of dwelling in the sukkah means eating and drinking. According to many, it is more mehuddar to say the blessing of \"leishev b'Sukkah\" over a cup of wine and to say it standing.</p>\n\n<p>But all this doesn't distinguish Hoshannah Rabbah. The minhag of Spinka regarding the meals applies to all the days. </p>\n\n<p>Sefer Ta'amei HaMinhagim v'Makorei HaDinim, pg 354, sief 811:11-12 compares Hoshannah Rabbah to both Shabbat, being the 7th day and to Yom Kippur, in that it is the completion of the cycle that began from Rosh Chodesh Elul. This is alluded to in the actual word הושענא. The salvation occurs at the completion of the 51 day cycle from the first day of Rosh Chodesh Elul through Hoshannah Rabbah.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Avudarham, Tefillat Sukkah, beginning with the words, \"And on the 5th day of chol hamoed, which is Hoshannah Rabbah\", it explains that there are those who have the custom to add the Yotzer of Shabbat, and the kedushah of Musaph  Shabbat to the Hoshannah Rabbah prayers like is done for Yom Tov even though it is chol hamoed. The Avudarham says the minhag is to think of Hoshannah Rabbah like a Yom Tov and like the sealing of Yom Kippur. This idea is also brought in Pri Megadim 664 and is discussed by the Levush to the same siman (664, sief 1). This same practice is also brought in Sefer Tzedah l'Derech, Ma'amar 4, K'lal 6, chapter 9. And the additions outlined by the Avudarham are also what is specified in the minhagim of Spinka.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Shaas hashmad and Arab terrorism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a halachik principle brought down in the Talmud and codified in halacha known as <em>shaat hashmad</em> - a time of forced religious persecution. Generally, the rule is that any commandment of the Torah does not demand martyrdom for its observance with the exception of the 3 severe sins (idolatry, sexual crimes [i.e. adultery, incest, homosexuality, and bestiality], and murder) and the desecration of G-d's name (see Rambam Hilchot Yesodei Hatorah 5:2). However, at a time when there is a movement on the part of the non-Jewish authorities to destroy Jewish practices, then even minor commandments (or even mere customs) also demand martyrdom for their observance (see e.g. Rambam Yesodei HaTorah 5:3).</p>\n\n<p>Recently, Arab leaders have successfully incited Arab terrorists to commit violence against Jews with a short term aim of preventing Jewish prayer in the Old City (e.g. atop the Temple Mount or at its Western Wall) and a continuing long term aim of exterminating/expelling the Jews from Israel. In response, some Jewish religious leaders have advocated that Jews avoid entering the Old City until the situation calms down. Considering that the threatened violence is intended to prevent Jewish religious practices, why shouldn't maintaining these practices (i.e. praying/visting Jewish holy sites) fall under the spirit/letter of the <em>shaas hashmad</em> law indicating a need to involve some level of <em>mesiras nefesh</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are two answers to this question both found in Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 157 seen <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.157?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\">here</a>.\nFirst, see the Ramma who says that the type decree which necessitates giving up one's life is only a decree leveled against jews alone, עַל יִשְׂרָאֵל לְבַדָּם,  not a decree which includes other people as well, as Shach #6 there explains. And as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount_entry_restrictions\">wiki</a> says:\nChristians and Jews may only visit the site as tourists. They are forbidden from singing, praying, or making any kind of \"religious displays\".</p>\n\n<p>Another answer to your question is found one line later where the Ramma says:</p>\n\n<p>דַוְקָא אִם רוֹצִים לְהַעֲבִירוֹ בְּמִצְוַת לֹא תַּעֲשֶׂה, אֲבָל אִם גָּזְרוּ (גְּזֵרָה) שְׁמָד שֶׁלֹּא לְקַיֵּם מִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה, אֵין צָרִיךְ לְקַיְּמוֹ וְשֶׁיֵּהָרֵג (ר''ן פֶּרֶק בַּמֶּה טּוֹמְנִין ונ''י פֶּרֶק סוֹרֵר וּמוֹרֶה). \nמִיהוּ אִם הַשָּׁעָה צְרִיכָה לְכָךְ, וְרוֹצֶה לֵהָרֵג וּלְקַיְּמוֹ, הָרְשׁוּת בְּיָדוֹ</p>\n\n<p>one is only required to give up his life if he is being coerced into a forbidden act, however if the decree is against fulfilling a positive commandment, one need not perform it and give up his life.

Shemuel HaNagid. [i] We find more positive explanations in the early 12th century in the Kuzari. The Zohar also references swaying during study. The controversies regarding dating this work would determine whether or not this is the earliest source.</p>\n\n<p>By the later 12th century, we find Rishonim discussing swaying during prayer as well.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Reasons For Swaying While Learning</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Kuzari</strong> writes regarding swaying during study:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rabbi: It is said that it is done in order to arouse natural heat. My personal belief is that it stands in connection with the subject under discussion. As it often happened that many persons read at the same time, it was possible that ten or more read from one volume. This is the reason why our books are so large. Each of them was obliged to bend down in his turn in order to read a passage, and to turn back again. This resulted in a continual bending and sitting up, the book lying on the ground. This was one reason. Then it became a habit through constant seeing, observing and imitating, which is in man's nature. (Hartwig Hirschfeld's translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He gives two reasons. The first is one which people say, that it is to arouse heat in the body, I guess like a form of exercise. Alternatively, he means to arouse passion, to get into it. Then there is the reason preferred by the author, which is his suspicion that originally it was because people shared books and they moved in and our of the way so they could read and give others a chance to read and ultimately this became the habit and spread</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Zohar</strong> (Parashat Pinhas) also discusses swaying during study, and seems to connect it to the deep connection that Jews have to the Torah, and their resultant passion when studying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We arose and went on our way, the sun becoming stronger and more oppressive. We saw some trees in the wilderness with water underneath, and we sat down in the shade of one of them. I asked him: How is it that of all peoples of the world, only the Jews sway to and fro when they study the Torah, a habit which seems to come natural to them, and they are unable to keep still? He replied: You have reminded me of a very deep idea which very few people know. He pondered for a moment and wept. Then he continued: Alas for mankind who go about like cattle without understanding. This thing alone is sufficient to distinguish the holy souls of Israel from the souls of heathen peoples. The souls of Israel have been hewn from the Holy Lamp, as is written, “The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord” (Prov. xx, 27). Now once this lamp has been kindled from the supernal Torah, the light upon it never ceases for an instant, like the flame of a wick which is never still for an instant. So when an Israelite has said one word of the Torah, a light is kindled and he cannot keep still but sways to and fro like the flame of a wick. But the souls of heathens are like the burning of stubble, which gives no flame, and therefore they keep still like wood burning without a flame.’ Said R. Jose: ‘That is a good explanation; happy am I to have heard this.’ (Soncino translation.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Some Rishonim</strong> connect it to the verse, “the people saw and trembled” (Ex. 20:15) such as Ba’al ha-turim there who comments, “Therefore we sway during Torah learning (limud ha-Torah), since the Torah was given with fear, terror, and shaking (b-aimah, reses, and zeiah).” Darkhei Moshe, commenting on Tur, (Hilchot Birkhat ha-Shahar 48:1), cites <strong>Abudirham</strong>,who applies this to the communal Torah reading as well. Cf. Rama, Shulhan Arukh ad loc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reason for Swaying While Praying</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Rishonim also discuss swaying during prayer [ii], many such as <strong>Sefer Hasidim</strong> (12th cent.) (57) explain this based on the verse \"kol atzmotai tomarnah Hashem mi kamokha\". <strong>Shibolei HaLeket</strong>, 17 cites <strong>Ma’aseh Merkava</strong> who writes this as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rivash</strong>, quoted by Mekor Hesed on Sefer Hasidim, ibid. gives a parable that when one is drowning and jumping around in the water, people won’t make fun of him.  So too, when one is davening and shaking himself, he is attempting to remove distractions.  “When a man is drowning in a river and making many movements to remove himself from the water, surely those that are watching him will not laugh at him and his [strange] movements; so too, when one prays (k’she’mitpallel) and makes many [strange] movements, one should not laugh at him.”  </p>\n\n<p><strong>R’ Schwab</strong> provides his own understanding of shukeling in R’ Schwab on Prayer (page 167):</p>\n\n<p>“There are two ways in which a person can relate to Hakodosh Baruch Hu.  One is through ahava (love), in which a person feels very close to Him, and the other is through yirah (awe), in which one is awestruck by His Omnipotence and Omniscience.  This may explain the ancient Jewish practice of “shokeling,” swaying forward and backward during teffilah.  The forward motion expresses one’s desire to come close to Hakodosh Baruch Hu, but then, upon reflection, one realizes that He is the Ribbono Shel Olam, the Master of the universe, which causes one to reel back in awe.  These thoughts are typically evoked during meditation.”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Possible Motivations for Variations in Movement</strong></p>\n\n<p>For swaying while studying, according to the first reason in the Kuzari, the motion is intended to excite oneself, so this would explain more vigorous movement that also incorporates hand movement. The same would apply to the Zohar which also seems to connect it with excitement. This would also make sense according to the Abudirham and others who connect the movement to trembling in awe of the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>For swaying while praying: Sefer Hassidim is explicit that the entire body shakes in accordance with the verse: All my bones, etc. this would include the hands as well as the body.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, Regarding <code>A few people squint their eyes and some rub their hands while shuckling</code> Besides for being explainable based on the aforementioned Kuzari and Zohar for study, and Sefer Hassidim and Shibbolei HaLeket for prayer in general, there is also a history of gesticulations for Shema in particular. See: <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2011/08/head-movements-of-shema.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://seforim.blogspot.com/2011/08/head-movements-of-shema.html</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (Berakhot 13b) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Symmachus says: “Whoever prolongs the word ehad (“one”), his days and years are prolonged.</p>\n  \n  <p>Said Rav Aha bar Ya’akov: “And [specifically] the letter dalet [of ehad].”</p>\n  \n  <p>Said Rav Ashi: “Provided he does not speed up the letter het [of ehad].”</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Yirmiyah was sitting before R. [Hiyya bar Abba]. He saw that he was prolonging overly much. He said to him: “Once you have proclaimed Him King above and below, and to the four winds of heaven, you need not any further.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Menahem Ha-Me’iri of Perpignan, Provence (1249-1306) finds an added dimension: “The amount of lengthening the letter dalet is that required to picture in the heart that He, blessed be He, rules over heaven and earth and the four winds of the world. And for this reason, it is customary to tilt the head and move it to these sides. Nevertheless, if one prefers not to tilt the head, one need not, because the thing depends not on the tilting of the head and its movements, but rather upon the feeling of the heart.”</p>\n\n<p>These sorts of motions are attributed to R. Hai Gaon as well.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i]  In this poem he is criticizing the degeneration of Torah study...As an example of their lack of orderliness he mentions their shokeling:</p>\n\n<p>והנה רב ותלמידים מנידים לראשיהם כערער בערבה</p>\n\n<p>The teacher and students were bobbing their head like a tamarisk in the wilderness.\"</p>\n\n<p>This then is the first incidental mention of shokeling, at least in Jewish sources.</p>\n\n<p>[ii] Other sources are in favor of not shaking at all during prayer due to the awe one should have while praying particularly during the amidah:</p>\n\n<p>These include Ba’al Shem Tov, quoted by Mekor Hesed, ibid, Perush Azulai on Sefer Hasidim, ibid who in turn cites  Rabbi  Yisroel Saruk and his student Ramah, and the Shlah (quote found in Netiv Binah, vol. 1, pg. 96). This was also the practice of the Arizal and German Jewry as noted by Rabbi Dr. Joseph Breuer zt”l, in an essay entitled “Our Way,” (A Unique Perspective, pg. 384). Most later authorities write that one should do whatever is best for his concentration. These include Arukh Hashulhan and Mishnah Berurah</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuckling\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Wikipedia article on the topic</a>, apparently citing  <em>The JPS Guide to Jewish Traditions</em> by Ronald Eisenberg:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This practice can be traced back to at least the eighth century, and possibly as far back as Talmudic times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I believe there are some in the Heichalot literature that are even higher. Nevertheless, most souls aren't on the level of Atzilut and there's only 36 hidden tzaddikim. However, this doesn't address the levels of souls. Since the word soul is frequently mistook, hence the prohibition to translate kabbalah, I'll first break down the 5 general neshamot. Bereishit Rabbah 14:9. Nefesh originates in Asiya, Ruach in Yetzirah, and Neshamah in Beriah.

The lattermost is a mesirat haratzon which means that one loses their free will and consequently leads to mesirat hanefesh.</p>\n<p>As explained elsewhere, some people have lower rooted souls and others higher. How can both statements be true, that on the one hand all souls come from Atzilut and on the other hand different olomot? Because the Alter Rebbe uses the double lashon shoresh and makor frequently, referring to its root and source. Remember, the Alter Rebbe wrote the Tanya \"without a superfluous or deficient letter,\" Tanya, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/61093/jewish/Approbations.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Chabad: Tanya, Approbations\">Approbations</a>. Although I use them interchangeably, they are different stages in the hishtalshelut. I should edit this better, but I just want to convey the main thrust of ideas.</p>\n<p>The seat of the Neshamah is in the head, <em>i.e.</em>, the brain; the seat of the Ruach is in the heart; and the seat of the Nefesh is in the liver.</p>\n<p>For reference, the NaRa\"N are lights, the brain-heart-liver are keilim, and the machshava-dibur-ma'aseh are garments.</p>\n<p>נר\"ן = אורות</p>\n<p>מל\"כ = כלים</p>\n<p>מדו\"מ = לבושים</p>\n<p>Irrespective, this still leaves open the question of the many parts of the nefesh. I'll begin.</p>\n<p>In a simple sense, there's the Divine Soul and Animal Soul. I direct the reader to the copious footnotes for definitions so I can be terse here. Tanya, the first self-help book, only discussed these two because of their immediate relevance. However, there are actually 3 levels, as the Alter Rebbe brings down in <a href=\"http://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/maamarei/569/3/44.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Chabad: Beiur, 44\">5569</a> and the Rebbe Rashab in 5659:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכנודע שיש ג' נפשות בכאו\"א מישראל והגם שבלק\"א לא נז' רק ב' אבל עפ\"י\nאמת הם ג' והם נפש החיוני' ונפש השכלית ונפש האלקי'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But, in total, there are 5 nefashot, not to be confused with the 5 neshamot, that enliven the body in 3 rungs. I have a ton of questions myself, but I don't want to bombard the forum with topics. I feel like they can all be bunched together as they relate to one subject. I will bold all the questions I still have and highlight additional ideas.</p>\n<p>As well, there's a subtle distinction in the Hebrew that's frequently lost in the English. <em>E.g.</em>, hasichlit vs. sichli. Sichli refers to the perceptive faculties of nefesh hasichlit, which is a soul way of seeing the world. <strong>I believe</strong> that the same holds true for the rest.\nIn this regard, the sichli is relegated to the 5 functions of the soul, like the X axis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zan (Nutritive) –\nIngestion, retention, digestion,\ngrowth, procreation,\nmetabolism;</li>\n<li>Margish (Sensory) –\nThe five senses [IMHO, there may be seven: Sight.ראייה,\nSmell. ריח\nTaste. טעם\nHearing. שמיעה\nTouch. מגע\nVestibular.תנועה\nProprioception. התחושה];</li>\n<li>Medameh (Imaginative) –\nRetention of images and\nexperiences and well as\ninnovation;</li>\n<li>Mitorer (Emotional) –\nCraving or rejection. It’s really the locomotive; &</li>\n<li>Sichli (Intellect) –\nContemplation,\nconceptualization, the Rational Soul.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rambam's Shemonah Perakim, ch. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eight_Chapters.1.3?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Sefaria: Shemonah Perakim, ch. 1\">1</a>, as explained by the Sixteenth Street Synagogue, chs. <a href=\"http://www.sixteenthstreetsynagogue.org/classes_files/8perakim/1review.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sixteenthstreetsynagogue.org/classes_files/8perakim/2review.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2</a>.</p>\n<p>As for the nefashot, they are to wit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Firstly, <strong>from my understanding</strong>, the Nefesh HaChiyunit (Nh\"Ḥ), the Animating Soul, was blown into Adam. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Sefaria\">Bereishit 2:7</a>. This represents the refined state of man, after the bestial souls have been elevated, <strong>but I can't find a source</strong>. However, the soul discussed in Tanya <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7880/jewish/Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Tanya\">ch. 1</a>, is the Nh\"Ḥ. Igros Kodesh 11:107 (which\nitself divides into the medial Intellectual Soul and the lower Animal Soul).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>I also don't know what sefirah this corresponds to,</strong> but I would hazard to say Keter. Keter of the lower world always connects to malchut of the next higher world. The source of this is <strong>ostensibly</strong> from Atzmut, stemming from the Supernal Thought.</p>\n<p><strong>I also can't find</strong> where this is rooted below, so I imagine that it's makif like the chaya-yechidah within a person's daled amot.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Secondly, the Nefesh HaElokit (Nh\"E) was given to man at the Brit Milah.\nThe Alter Rebbe amplifies this notion by explaining that although the G‑dly soul has entered with the circumcision, and continues to be manifest throughout the years of education, it enters in the most complete manner only on the occasion of Bar Mitzvah. Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim, Mahadura Basra 4 (end). See Tzemach Tzedek's Tehillim Yahel Or, ch. 2:7 (p. 11).\nThe circumsion is also when the ger receives the Nh\"E as the Tzemach Tzedek explains on what Hillel said to the ger in Shabbat 31a.\nThis is a wondrous idea, that until the Jew's bar mitzvah and the goy's conversion, they're identical. On our similar mission, see Rabbi Oliver's <a href=\"http://a-farbrengen.blogspot.com/2012/05/on-holiness-and-preparation-for.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jews and non-Jews</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Nh\"E is primarily mochin, the intelligence, while the middot here are the Yetzer Tov (Y\"T). Chassidic Discourses Vol. 1, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/67764/jewish/Discourse-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"chabad\">discourse 1</a>, ch. II; Torah Or, Miketz <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/toraor/10/38b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Torah Or\">38b</a>. This would explain why education/Torah is the antidote to the Yetzer Hara (Y\"H). Igros Kodesh, Vol. I, p. 151 (quoting Bava Batra 16a).\nTo me, this would also help understand why we are told that this soul is a Chelek Elokah Mimaal (<code>mamash</code> - Tanya, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7880/jewish/Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Tanya\">ch. 2</a>) much later in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.31.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Text_Only&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Sefaria\">Iyov 31:2</a>. It does not come right away.</p>\n<p>The sefirot here are ChaBaD, chochmah-binah-daat. Chassidic Discourses <em>ibid</em>.\nThe source of the Nh\"E is Adam Ila'ah. Chassidic Discourses <em>ibid</em>. (quoting Yechezkel 1:26). <strong>I suppose</strong> this is the same as the Adam Elyon. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.14.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Sefaria\">Yehoshua 14:14</a>. It is drawn down by Hashem during conception.

Of the four names for man, Adam is the highest. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.54b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Sefaria\">Shabbat 54b</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Adam is the quality of intellect, cold like earth (adamah);</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Ish is quality of emotions, ablaze like fire (aish);</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Enosh denotes weakness in one of the two, as it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.41.51\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Sefaria\">Bereishit 41:51</a>(nashani); &</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Gever is someone who overcame (mitgaber) his/her shortcomings.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hayom Yom, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/3316881/jewish/4-Elul.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Chabad\">Elul 4</a>; see Zohar III p. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/633844/jewish/Purifying-Adam.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Chabad\">48a</a>; see also The Source of Living Water (Ki Tetze, Ch. 21).\nThis <strong>looks like</strong> a parallel to the latter 4 nefashot.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Thirdly, <strong>it would seem</strong> that man was imbued with the Nefesh HaSichlit (Nh\"S), the Intellectual Soul, when the Eitz HaDaat was partook. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Sefaria\">Bereishit 3:7</a>. The <a href=\"https://moshiachindepth.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/kuntres11_openeyes_notbooklet.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Inyonei Moshiach and Geulah\">Tzemach Tzedek</a> explains that this is\nwhat is meant by “the eyes of the two of them were opened”:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…this means [their eyes were opened to] the aspect of  external\nwisdom, the chochma of the [Nh\"S],\nwhich is not how it was prior [to the  sin]. [Before the sin] they\nalso had wisdom, but it was the  chochma of G-dliness. They did not\npossess whatsoever  the aspect of this chochma which is the source of\nevil.  Only after they ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good  and\nEvil was [Adam] punished through the aspect of  human wisdom (chochma\nha’enushis) which is mixed good  and evil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, it is known that the Nh\"S is the intermediary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The [Nh\"E] is able to [garb itself] in the [Nh\"B] via the\n<a href=\"https://moshiachindepth.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/kuntres01_tzelemelokim_5774_notbooklet.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Inyonei Moshiach and Geulah: Tzelem\">Tzelem</a>, which refers to the [Nh\"S],\nwhich is the intermediary between them and connects them…In order for\nthe [Nh\"E] to be able to effect the rectification of the [Nh\"B]\n, there is a need for an intermediary, which is they purpose of\nthe [Nh\"S].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://moshiachindepth.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/kuntres11_openeyes_notbooklet.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Inyonei Moshiach and Geulah\">Maamar “Chavivin Yisroel”, 2nd Day Shavuos 5726 ois\n2‐3;</a> Likutei Torah, B’chukosai, 47c. See Sefer Maamarim 5700, p. 92 <em>ff.</em>\nIn general, that is what the Rebbe Rashab says in רנ\"ט דף קו:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכידוע שיש ג' נפשות בד\"פ בכאו\"א מישראל (הגם שבלק\"א נזכר רק ב' נפשות\nבאמת הם ג') נה\"א ונפש השכליות ונפש החיונית (דהנפש השכליות הוא ממוצע\nבין נה\"א להנה\"ט כו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically, the Nh\"S is a guf to the Nh\"E, and is a neshamah to the Nh\"B. <em>Cf</em>., Kuntres HaHitpaalut, p. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16042&st=&pgnum=133&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Hebrew Books: Kuntres HaHitpaalut, p. 133\">קלא</a> (Heb.) or ch. <a href=\"http://www.truekabbalah.com/docs/Kuntras_HaHitpaalut.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">22</a> (Eng.). <strong>To me, then, the only sefiroric bridge is Da'at.</strong> The source of this soul is <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/204393387/A-Tale-of-Three-Souls\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Tale of Three Souls by Rabbi Yehoishophot Oliver\">klippah nogah</a>, but a higher level. <em>Cf.</em>, Sefer HaMa’amarim  5709, pp. 53-54. Da'at has always confused me, but it's generally agreed that there's da'at elyon and da'at tachton, Tanya, ch. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1029098/jewish/Chapter-52.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Chabad: Tanya, ch. 42\">42</a>, as the Mitteler Rebbe explains in the Hakdama of <a href=\"http://www.neirot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Introducion-to-The-Gate-of-Faith-and-The-Gate-of-Unity.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Neirot: Introduction to the Gate of Faith\">Sha'ar HaEmunah</a> on Samuel I 2:3; Also see Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Vayikra Vol. 1, p. 262; Torat Chaim, Bereishit 18c; Shaar\nHaEmunah 51b. I forget where in the latter books of the Tanya it's brought, but Rabbi Schochet's Mystical Concepts in Chassidism, pp. 76-80, cites Pardes Rimonim 3:8 & 9:5-6; Eitz Chayim, Sha'ar 24 <em>ff</em>., Sha'ar Hahakdamot, Derush Be'inyan Hada'at, pp. 273b<em>ff.</em>; et seq. For more, consult <a href=\"http://www.inner.org/sefirot/sefdaat.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Rabbi Ginsberg\">Rabbi Ginsberg</a>.\nI mention all this because this is the only root that is split atwain, a higher level of klippah nogah and a lower level. The only logical explanation is that the source must be in da'at.</p>\n<p>While the Tanya says that the abode of the Nh\"E is in the mochin, ch. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7886/jewish/Chapter-7.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Chabad: Tanya, ch. 7\">7</a> says it is also in the right ventricle of the heart. While I'll have to check the mefarshim on Tanya, <strong>I would think</strong> that this latter reference is solely referring to the Nh\"S.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Fourthly, but perhaps most mysterious to me, is the Nefesh HaTivit (Nh\"T), the Natural Soul. <strong>It would appear that this was imbued when Hashem first made man out of earth.</strong> Both the Nh\"S and the Nh\"T are usually mentioned together when speaking in a specific manner. For example, the Mitteler Rebbe writes in Sha'ar Emunah:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והכל להיותם בהגשמו' הלבוש דנוגה דעשי' וזהו כל ענין נפש השכלית והיא נפש\nהטבעי'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaam/ner/2/42b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Chabad Library: Sha'ar Emunah\">מב, ב</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בירור שמברר' הנשמה לגוף שזהו מה שיכול להיות עלי'\nהנפש השכלית הטבעית לעלות גם היא לקדוש' האלקי'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaam/ner/2/47a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Chabad Library: Sha'ar Emunah\">מז, א</a>)</p>\n<p>The Nh\"S/Nh\"T have hasaga from Elokut in the garments of noga and gashmiyut. The pair (Nh\"E + Nh\"S/Nh\"T) can then enclothe in the Animal Soul. That's because the job of the Nh\"E is to influence the Nh\"B to relate to Elokut via the memutza of the Nh\"S/Nh\"T.</p>\n<p>As my teacher explains it, the Nh\"S is the philosopher and the Nh\"T is the scientist. I don't know where my melamed got this from, but I would reckon from the Rambam. See Derech Chaim by the Maharal of Prague, perek daled, mishneh 21 (citing Rambam). In his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eight_Chapters.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Sefaria\">Shemonah Perakim</a> introduction to Pirkei Avot, he immediately delves into the 3 physical nefashot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דע, שנפש האדם אחת, ויש לה פעולות רבות חלוקות, יקראון קצת הפעולות ההן\nנפשות, ויחשוב בעבור זה שיש לאדם נפשות רבות כמו שחשבו הרופאים, עד ששם\nראש הרופאים פתיחת ספרו שנפשות שלש, הטבעית, וחיונית ונפשית.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's important to understand how this Rambam applies b'poel to a chassid, so I'll quote in toto <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3150642/jewish/Shabbos-Parshas-Bamidbar-at-the-Daytime-Seudah-New-York.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Chabad: Sefer HaSichos 5700\">Shabbos Parshas Bamidbar, at the Daytime Seudah [New York]</a>, ¶9 (but see also ¶10):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Among the arrivals to the periodic fairs in Lubavitch were several\nrespected and successful businessmen from Shklov and Minsk. The\nheavyweight scholars among them used to visit my great-grandfather the\nTzemach Tzedek and expound their chiddushim, their original Torah\ninsights.</p>\n<p>One of them, a prominent misnaged, once said to my great-grandfather:\n“In every context and on every subject, your learned grandfather\n[i.e., the Alter Rebbe] cites the language of Rambam, and with regard\nto most of the Talmudic debates and halachic decisions he follows his\napproach. Why, then, when Rambam names the three souls of man tiv’is\n(‘the natural soul’), chiyunis (‘the vital soul’) and sichlis (‘the\nintellective soul’), does your grandfather name them chiyunis (‘the\nvital soul’), sichlis (‘the intellective soul’) and Elokis (‘the\nDivine soul’)? What did he do with the tiv’is (‘the natural soul’)?”</p>\n<p>The Tzemach Tzedek replied: “Out of the [person animated by a] nefesh\nhativ’is (‘natural soul’) my grandfather made a chassid. That\n‘natural’ person who was transformed into a chassid has three souls:\nthe chiyunis (‘the vital soul’), which regulates how a chassid ought\nto live, and the sichlis (‘the intellective soul’), which [provides]\nthe mind that a chassid ought to have. And when a person lives as a\nchassid ought to live, and has the mind that a chassid ought to have,\nhe can then have some appreciation of his nefesh Elokis (his ‘Divine\nsoul’). At that point it is his nefesh Elokis, his Divine soul, that\nanimates him.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as the function of the Nh\"T, this is what the Malbim says in Sefer HaCarmel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נפש הישראלי: בנפש האדם לפי כחותיו נמצא ג' חלוקות, א' נפש הטבעית\nהצומחת, בחלק התחתון בגוף, וכחותיה יתראו בכלי הבטן להצמיח גוף האדם על\nמאכלו אשר יבשלו המבשלות האצטומכא, והכבד והקרבים, ויחלקו מנות לכל אברי\nהגוף, וישמרו תפקידם על ידי כחות הזן המעכל והדוחה. ב' נפש החיונית תשכון\nבחלק הגוף בלב האדם, ממנו תוצאות חיים בכח המתעורר והמדות. ג' נפש המשכלת\nמשכנה בעלית קיר קטנה בכדור העליון בגוף האדם, הראש והגלגולת, פועלת בכלי\nהמוח בכחות השכל החכמה והבינה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This sounds a lot like the zan.</p>\n<p>While the Nh\"E invests into the Nh\"B, the neshamah enclothes into the Nh\"T as the <a href=\"http://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaam/maamarei/577/6/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Chabad Library: Hanachos – 5577\">Mitteler Rebbe</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה הנפש אלקית הוא מלובש תוך נפש הבהמית שהרי במה נתפעל במוח ולב הוא\nבאותו השכל עצמו שבזה העולם. וזהו מה הנשמה ממלא את כל הגוף כי גוף אין\nפירושו גוף גשמי רק קאי על נפש הטבעי' שהנשמה מלובשת תוך נפש הטבעית, כך\nהקב\"ה שהוא הוי' בחי' סוכ\"ע כי קדוש הוא, ענין קדוש ומובדל כו' ממלא את\nכל העולם והוא בחי' התלבשות סוכ\"ע בממכ\"ע.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is where my knowledge ends. <strong>I could say</strong> that the sefirot here are the middot since Rabbi Hillel of Paritch implies that [<strong>of the Nh\"Ḥ?</strong>] the middot are called the Nh\"T and the mochin are called the Nh\"S:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי גם נה\"ט יש בה שני בחי' והמדות שבה נקר' נה\"ט והשכל שבה המלובש במוח\nנקרא נפש השכלית</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kuntres HaHitpaalut, p. קג, perek ג,  <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16042&st=&pgnum=105&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Hebrew Books: Kuntres HaHitpaalut, p. 105\">footnote</a>.</p>\n<p>This natural soul was hewn, including its ten <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochos_hanefesh#Description\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Wikipedia\">powers</a> - desire, intellect, emotions, thought, speech\netc., in essence, all from the aspect of the\" Garment of [<code>Chashmal of</code>, <em><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16042&st=&pgnum=119&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Hebrew Books: Kuntres HaHitpaalut, p. 119\">id.</a></em> at קיז,] Nogah,\" see De'ah et HaShem, <a href=\"https://www.truekabbalah.com/docs/TheKnowledgeOfG-d.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"De'ah et HaShem - The Knowledge of G-d, written by Shimon Markel, Ed. by Rabbi Amiram Markel, © 2004 – 2006\">1:98, 1:122, but especially 3:12</a>, which is a composite of good and evil, etc. Kuntres HaHitpaalut, p. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16042&st=&pgnum=107&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Hebrew Books: Kuntres HaHitpaalut, p. 107\">קו</a> (Hebrew) or ch. <a href=\"http://www.truekabbalah.com/docs/Kuntras_HaHitpaalut.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"On Divine Inspiration, trans. by Rabbi Amiram Markel\">18</a> (English).

These are fire, air, water and earth. However, man’s body was formed from the choicest portion of these elements. Nevertheless, this choice portion also has an admixture of evil in it. Man’s four humors (<em>i.e.</em>, the white, black, red and green humors) were formed from the grossest portion of these elements.</p>\n<p>These 4 elements are the\nfour letters of HaShem’s name, quoting <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.37?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Sefaria\">Yechezkel 37:9</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, as mentioned above, the roots of the four elements of a\nperson’s holy soul are drawn  from these four letters. Therefore, if a\nperson totally lacks a specific mitzvah, the corresponding  organ of\nhis holy soul starves to death and departs, G-d forbid. In turn, when\nthis holiness departs  from it, the spirit of impurity from the four\nelements of the impure soul becomes vested in it. This is  the secret\nof the rabbinic dictum, “Tyre did not become a great metropolis until\nJerusalem was  destroyed.” Thus, the organ now receives its sustenance\nfrom the “impure bread” that was exiled  from there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There's also correlations between these, <em>e.g.</em>, the Nh\"T is frequently referenced with the נפש הצומחת, Vegatative Soul.

The fins represent the love and fear that every soul should have for G‑d, while the scales represent the Torah and mitzvot in which every soul must garb itself.

That translates as \"a part of G-d above literally\". That means that the \"Nefesh Elokit\" is from \"Atzmut Ain Sof\" and actually transcends the aspect of \"worlds\" altogether.</p>\n\n<p>This is also understood from the posuk in Bereshit 2:7, \"and blew into his nostrils the living soul...\" Like the Alter Rebbe brings in chapter 2 of Tanya, section 1 quoting the Zohar, \"From where is it blown? From within G-d, meaning מתוכיותו ומפנימיותו.</p>\n\n<p>This concept as found in the teachings of the Ari z\"l from Rabbi Chaim Vital can be found in Etz Chaim, volume 1, Sha'ar 3, chapter 1 which discusses this first man, called Adam Kadmon or Adam, Kadmon HaKadmonim. It explains that this level of Adam is second to Ain Sof and is called Adam of the creation and that he precedes Atzilut. Going a little further, in chapter 3, it explains that at this level of Adam everything, body and soul are called \"Atzmut\", essence.</p>\n\n<p>This discussion continues in Sha'ar 4, chapter 1, Ain Sof spread out from Himself, so to speak, lights to be the roots of Atzilut. This is also referred to as the aspect of \"Neshamah l'Neshamah\". It continues to discuss the details of this and in chapter 2 starts to explain this in the aspect of breath. It explains that in regard to this idea of breath, there is an external aspect and an inner aspect. The inner aspect of breath is in a constant state of cleaving with Ain Sof, meaning never separate. In other words, this breath which is referred to in Bereshit 2:7 is \"Atzmut Ain Sof\". Thus, the expression used for the Nefesh Elokit, the G-dly soul, that it is ״חלק אלוה ממעל ממש״.</p>\n\n<p>This same idea and wording is repeated by student of the Ari z\"l, Rabbi Avraham Azulai in Sefer Chesed l'Avraham, Ma'ayan 4, Nahar 30 toward the end explaining how the level of the Tzaddik is higher than the angels. In the paragraph beginning with the words, \"And with what has been clarified in regard to the aspect of the foundations, the level of the angel would be higher than the level of HaAdam...\" Rabbi Azulai goes on to explain that because of the Nefesh Elokit this is not the case. Rather because the Nefesh Elokit is a part of G-d above HaAdam is higher than the level of angels. In this context, it is important to recall the ma'amar Chazal from Sanhedrin, \"All Israel has a share in the world to come, as it says 'And your people, all of them are Tzaddikim. They will inherit the world forever.\"</p>\n\n<p>This same concept is also repeated by Rabbi Yishayahu Horowitz in his sefer, Shnei Luchot HaBrit, Sha'ar HaOtiyot, Letter Dalet, in the explanation of derech eretz.</p>\n\n\n",

The details of the reasoning behind the decision are found in Igrot Moshe, Volume 3, Even HaEzer, section 1, Siman 57.

    "content": "# May the Shmittah Etrog be used to make lemon-scented deodorant or furniture polish?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My son brought me a pamphlet produced by Yeshiva Sh'or Yoshuv (Far Rockaway, NY) that discussed the laws of the 4 minim. (If I can locate an online copy, I'll edit in a link.)</p>\n\n<p>Near the end of the pamphlet, it discussed some special laws of how to handle <em>shmitah</em> (Sabbatical) year etrogim after Succot. It said that it may not be disposed as long as it is in an edible state. It must either be eaten, or left to rot until it is inedible. </p>\n\n<p>My question is, must it be used <strong>just</strong> as food or would anything useful that doesn't just dispose of the etrog be permitted? E.g. I see many people stud the etrog with cloves and use it for havdalah <em>besamim</em>.

Is it because of sifting? Is there some other melacha involved? Is it actually forbidden?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The issue at hand is measuring. See the Shulchan Aruch siman 308 siff 51 and the Ramma who says the accepted practice is to not use sand timers. </p>\n\n<p>See also Rabbi Ribiat's 39 Melachos volume 4 page 979. In the note section he quotes the Shulchan Aruch and says to see Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa chapter 28 siff 30 with note 70 where we find the Chazzon Ish saying there is a problem of Boneh and R' Shlomo Zalman's who does not agree.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that measuring for a mitzvah is allowed. So as the Shmiras Shabbos points out, measuring time for a sick person to eat is allowed. This is true even if he is not in danger.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To answer your last question first there are opinions who are lenient, especially if the goal of the time is to measure turn-taking in a game rather than measuring the duration of time something takes. For example <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/ask/58086\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Moshe Leib Halbetstadt paskens</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regarding a sand timer which has no lines but a fixed time such as two or three minutes, one who is lenient and uses it on Shabbat has whom to rely on, and one who is stringent and refrains will be blessed. (פרמ\"ג או\"ח סימן רנב במשבצות זהב ס\"ק ז, לבוש סימן שח סעיף נא, והובא גם בכף החיים אות רסט וע\"ע באות רעג).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Broadly speaking the main issues raised in the halakic literature fall under measurement and 'weekday activity' (uvdin d'chol). It may also be associated with the general prohibition of commerce which falls under a protection against coming to write.</p>\n<p>Regarding weekday activity, Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach in Shulchan Shlomo 308  is lenient especially when used as part of a game, see also Tzitz Eliezer Vol. 3, no. 10.</p>\n<p>A thoroughgoing exposition of this issue by Rabbi Daniel Mann, especially as it relates to a medical need, even on Yom Kippur <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2016/11/using-hourglass-shabbat/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">can be found here</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Nature of revelation and inspiration received by Moses?",
    "content": "# Nature of revelation and inspiration received by Moses?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm an outsider to Judaism trying to understand the nature of revelation, in particular the revelation that is Torah. So far I've learned that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37342/9531\">God spoke to Moses</a> (puh) - in the literal sense - and dictated the Torah. However, that still doesn't clear a few things. My questions are embedded in the following text (please bear with the lengthy explanation).</p>\n\n<p>Interpretation is the most important element of communication. In essence, every form of communication (involving humans) is transfer of \"interpretation\" - idea, understanding, implied meaning - from source to target. In the case of revelation at Mount Sinai it is the <em>Divine Idea</em> that God wanted his chosen Prophet and people to have. A perfect communication is where the <em>intended understanding</em> is perfectly achieved. </p>\n\n<p>The integrity of the channel or transmission of Divine Idea is not a question since God spoke Himself eliminating all possible interference, however, what I couldn't find an explicit explanation of was: Did Moses (puh) <em>interpret</em> the Word of God using his human faculties? How was the <em>interpretation</em> of the Word of God safeguarded from human fallibility? Is it that revelation of the highest level necessarily comprises - to put it bluntly - God planting the implied/correct meaning in the recipient's mind as well? Is it that a Prophetic interpretation, even though humanly, is in line with divine intention, i.e. it is the infallibility of the Prophet rather than the message?</p>\n\n<p>In the light of the above, there is also confusion regarding the nature of \"divine inspiration,\" as that seems just another word for genesis of an idea in human mind through divine will - an interpretation sans word?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In order to keep my answer short enough for this forum, and to avoid confusion, I am not going to go into major detail or quote sources. Besides, the question is so vast and open, that it would require a long list. I will just say that I am passing on what I have learned in my rabbinical training (Orthodox).</p>\n\n<p>The OP asks: <strong>\"Did Moses (puh) interpret the Word of God using his human faculties?\"</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Yes, sometimes he did. However, for the most part, he didn't. Some interpretations needed less or more reliance on his own human faculties. This depended on what G-d wanted from him. It seems to also depend on the gravity and leeway of that part of the Divine message in question. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, the verse (see ten commandments) \"I am the Lord your G-d etc.\" was not subject to much (or any) human interpretation. Most laws were pretty much black and white. However, some laws required human intellect to arrive at in detail. (this is part of what is called \"Oral Torah\" and it has intellectual rules like \"Kal v'Chomer\", or deriving a ruling in a stricter law because that ruling already exists in a lighter law etc.) In those cases, G-d wanted the human mind to be part of finding the true law in a situation.</p>\n\n<p>The OP asks: <strong>\"How was the interpretation of the Word of God safeguarded from human fallibility?\"</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The short answer is that it wasn't fully safeguarded from human error, and that's OK anyway.</p>\n\n<p>A brief reading of Vayikra (Leviticus) 4, will show us that G-d decided to include among the temple offerings, a sacrifice in case the majority of the nation of Israel mis-interpreted the law and accidentally commited sin because of it. Such a sacrifice also applies if the High Priest of Israel mistakenly commits a sin based on his own misjudgment as well.</p>\n\n<p>G-d never guaranteed anyone that He would always spoon-feed perfection in Divine guidance. He actually wants our input so we can earn a reward for being part of the Divine process.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is also obvious that G-d would help us recognize mistakes in any Divine transmission, eventually,  if we as humans really botched it up and forgot or mistakenly misinterpreted the law. The proof to this is Levit. 4 itself. How did G-d expect a nation that erred to offer a bull sacrifice for that error, if we would never realize our mistake in the first place?!</p>\n\n<p>However, G-d does require that we set up natural safeguards, so He doesn't need to perform miracles to remind/fix our mistakes all the time.</p>\n\n<p>1) Jewish scribes have detailed laws about writing scrolls of the Torah. The new copies must be checked, rechecked, and examined by multiple people against already existing scrolls to be considered valid.</p>\n\n<p>2) Devarim (Deutoronomy) 17 contains the rules for disputes to be brought to the supreme court. This is so that arguments will be settled by vast majority opinion. Also, misinterpretation will not multiply and fragment within Israel. G-d will exercise His gift of heavy Divine guidance, if a matter is so important as to be brought to this ultimate forum.</p>\n\n<p>3) Similarly, see the system established in Sh'mos (Exodus) 18. A massive system of men elected for their skill and honesty etc., was to form a pyramid of interpretation and guidance, and resulted in consulting Moses (and His Divinely inspired level) as a last failsafe.</p>\n\n<p>The OP further asks: <strong>\"...God planting the implied/correct meaning in the recipient's mind as well?\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Answer: Of course this is sometimes the case. It depends if G-d feels that such a thorough message is needed.</p>\n\n<p>The OP further asks: <strong>\"Is it that a Prophetic interpretation, even though humanly, is in line with divine intention, i.e. it is the infallibility of the Prophet rather than the message?\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Answer: Yes. Sometimes this is the case too. It depends on how much G-d wants the involvement of the person's/prophet's own efforts.</p>\n\n<p>The OP ends by mentioning: <strong>\"...there is also confusion regarding the nature of \"divine inspiration,...\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Answer: As was just explained above, there are many levels of Divine inspiration. Some people pray and have a \"feeling\" about what would be truly right in G-d's eyes to do next. Some famous prophets were shown a clear vision with words and meanings. It all depends on G-d's judgment as to what is needed.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion:</p>\n\n<p>G-d gave a Law/Torah (Divine Message), in a clear manner to Moses and Israel. In the process, He wanted the human mind to be involved with <strong>some</strong> of the levels of interpreting and transmitting torah. This does not make the conclusions any less valid.</p>\n\n<p>Israel was to naturally safeguard the transmission of this truth for all generations using strict safeguards.</p>\n\n<p>In case these safeguards failed on occasion, G-d would make sure the people got the correction. Therefore, we can always rely that the Torah's message and interpretation is valid and correct in our hands today.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I don't think anyone can give you a definitive answer to this question. The question in itself assumes God exists, revelation happened, etc.</p>\n\n<p>What is the exact nature of this revelation? Was any interpretation involved on Moses part? This heavily depends on who you ask.</p>\n\n<p>One approach is to say God communicated the words of the Torah directly to Moses word for word and that Moses fully understand what God revealed to him due to his perfection. You'll find people thinking along these lines in Orthodox circles.</p>\n\n<p>Another approach is to say there is a human element in Divine revelation. Revelation itself wasn't necessarily given to Moses word for word. Instead Moses received some sort of non verbal communication from God and it was up to him to interpret that message and write it down in the words of the Bible. According to this approach, one might also say that Moses made mistakes in receiving this Divine communication and may have misinterpreted in some places. Approaches like this you'll hear from Conservative scholars such as Benjamin Sommer.</p>\n\n<p>If you'd like a list of different ways of understanding revelation, have a look at this article: <a href=\"http://thetorah.com/current-approaches/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thetorah.com/current-approaches/</a></p>\n\n\n",

I've got two questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Giving out loans with interest only to non-Jews has been so from the beginning, or is this a historical development?</p></li>\n<li><p>Do modern day Jews take loans with interest, from the bank for example?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To answer your first question, the Torah is very clear that interest may not be charged to Jews, but may be charged to non-Jews:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0523.htm#21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 23:21</a></p>\n<p>לַנָּכְרִי תַשּׁיךְ, וּלְאָחִיךָ לֹא תַשּׁיךְ--לְמַעַן יְבָרֶכְךָ יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ, בְּכֹל מִשְׁלַח יָדֶךָ, עַל-הָאָרֶץ, אֲשֶׁר-אַתָּה בָא-שָׁמָּה לְרִשְׁתָּהּ.</p>\n<p>Unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou puttest thy hand unto, in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So this practice goes all the way back to the giving of the Torah. As opposed to (e.g.) <a href=\"https://islam.stackexchange.com/a/7699/2469\">Islam's view</a>, Judaism <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/797/1713\">does not really consider charging interest to be an immoral act</a>. Lending money is a service, and there is nothing wrong in general with collecting payment for such a service.</p>\n<p>The answer to your second question depends on who is doing the lending. The prohibition of interest <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/25840/1713\">applies equally to the lender and to the borrower</a>; however, this again only applies when a Jew is lending money to another Jew. It is completely normal for Jews to take out an interest-bearing mortgage from a bank in order to buy a house.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the verse in the Torah <em>seems</em> to be talking about the case of lending money to a poor person who desperately needs the money. While the law also applies in other cases, the rabbinic literature is more lenient about cases where the borrower does not need the money to survive (e.g. a business investment) and allows certain loopholes that fulfill the same purpose as charging interest. For more information on that, research <em>heter iska</em> (See: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/11554/1713\">How is a heter iska made to work with a non-business loan?</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/45074/how-do-interest-loans-work-in-israel\">How do Interest Loans work in Israel?</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loans_and_interest_in_Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> confirms your view:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah and Talmud encourage the granting of loans if they do not\n  involve interest. But the halakhah [applicable Jewish law] regarding\n  free loans apply only to loans made to other Jews. It is permissible\n  to make loans with interest to non-Jews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/ribis1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article from jlaw</a> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Few committed Jews would deliberately lend (or borrow) money in\n  violation of the injunction against charging interest.  The article\n  suggests some contemporary applications of the Ribis principle and\n  discusses proposed remedies for each situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So you can see that there are modern Jews who do not lend to other Jews at interest. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Yom Kippur and IV drips\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is a somewhat silly question, but I'm sure it has a good answer and I'd like to know what it is.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I was hospitalized recently and I ended up being in hospital over Yom Kippur. (Everything ended up perfectly well in the end.) At that time, they were mostly just doing tests and keeping me under observation, but I did have an IV drip so they could give me some medicine and rebalance my electrolytes. Anyway, since I wasn't that sick at that point I asked the doctors whether it would endanger my health to fast and I was told 'we need to keep the IV drip in anyway, and there's no medical obstruction to you fasting if the drip is in place'. So I fasted.</p>\n\n<p>As you might expect given the physiology of dehydration, fasting with an IV drip in made for the easiest fast of my life!</p>\n\n<p>Now, obviously in this case there was a genuine medical reason why I needed to have the IV drip, but it got me thinking: would it be allowed for a completely healthy person to put themselves on an IV drip (before the start of Yom Kippur) and then keep the drip in throughout the holiday. (Just so as to make the fast easier.) To focus on the core of the question, let's suppose that the person in question holds a medical license (so can put a drip in completely safely), has all the equipment in hand to put the drip in themselves, and lives in a country where there are no medical licensing laws so wouldn't be breaking the secular law by doing this.</p>\n\n<p>It feels like the answer to this question <em>must</em> be 'no', but I couldn't work out what the reasoning would be. Could anyone enlighten me? </p>\n\n<p>(I was constantly thinking that if <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(TV_series)\">Dr House</a> was Jewish, he probably would do this every year!)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>[I tried \"my own approach\" in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/68607/11501\">another answer on this page</a> but wanted to also bring in the answers from serious poskim - I am gratified that I came to a conclusion similar to R Sternbuch using the same sources]</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eretzhemdah.org/newsletterArticle.asp?lang=en&pageid=48&cat=7&newsletter=909&article=3482\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Daniel Mann from Eretz Hemdah writes</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The question of whether someone may take intravenous nutrition on Yom\nKippur to not be as affected by the fast is a good one [...] We mentioned that many consider it a full-fledged rabbinic violation,\nwhich is certainly forbidden, and [R <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moishe_Sternbuch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moshe Sternbuch</a> in] Teshuvot V’hanhagot (II, 290) makes\nan interesting (he admits it is unproven) claim that intravenous\nnutrition violates a Torah positive commandment to afflict oneself\n(<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.23.29?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 23:29</a>).</p>\n<p>Regarding a healthy person, then, there would be no justification.\nEven if there is no violation, it still seems like something novel\nagainst the spirit of the law, which would itself be a bad idea in\ngeneral and certainly on Yom Kippur.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/yomtov/rosh-yk/fasting63.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Moshe Donnebaum writes</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>May a regular person who must fast ingest food artificially to ease or\neliminate the discomfort of fasting?

Fasting. Whoever fasts on this day\n  fulfills a positive commandment. Whoever eats or drinks on this day\n  negates the observance of [this] positive commandment and violates a\n  negative commandment, as [ibid. 23:29] states, \"Any soul that does not\n  afflict itself will be cut off.\" Since the Torah punishes a person who\n  does not fast with karet, we can derive from this that we are\n  forbidden to eat and drink on this day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So you could \"go around\" the negative mitzvah of not eating, but remains the positive mitzvah of fasting and afflicting oneself.

Ernest Klein's Etymologial Dictionary gives both meanings:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>נֵס[nays] standard, ensign, flag, signal, sign</li>\n<li>נֵס[nays] miracle, providential event, wonder (prob. sense enlargement of נֵס‏  1)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Your feminine form for miracle נֵסָח\"nay-sa\" (rhymes with \"day spa\") is a different word from נִסָה\"nee-sa\" (rhymes with \"we saw\").  Klein lists \"nee-sa\" as meaning 1. \"he tested or tried\", 2. \"he attempted, essayed\", 3. \"he proved, tempted\". The form נֻסָה (noo-sa) means \"was tested, was tried\". This is a case where the vowel does affect meaning significantly.</p>\n\n<p>An adjectival form of your word נִסִי \"nee-see\" is listed by Klein as meaning \"miraculous, marvelous\".</p>\n\n<p>A famous non-bibical biblical quote that uses this word (of course in the masculine again) is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreidel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"נס גדול היה שם\" (Nes Gadol Hayah Sham – \"a great miracle happened there\")</a>, referring to the miracle of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hanukkah</a>. The acronym of this phrase is printed on many dreidels.</p>\n\n<p>The masculine plural נִסִים \"nissim\", meaning \"miracles, wonders\" is found in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggadah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Passover haggadah</a> and in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirkei_Avot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avot</a> (\"Ten miracles were performed ...\")</p>\n\n<p>The variations of the masculine form \"nays\" are found twice in the morning and evening services, once meaning miracles (\"Who wrought miracles for us\") and once meaning banner (\"raise a banner to gather our exiles\").</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately for your specific question, this word is almost never feminine, except in your case of re-forming it into a proper name. That usage may not be found in biblical or rabbinic texts, but given the right pronunciation, makes sense as a derived feminine name (like Danielle from Daniel or Davita from David).</p>\n\n\n",

It seems to me that ginger would be a davar charif, so if it is cut with a non-kosher knife it might become non-kosher itself. On the other hand, I've heard that there is a halacha that davar charif which is cut in bulk does not become non-kosher, because the non-kosher residue which might be on the seller's knife becomes less potent after the first few cuts, so the vast majority of the davar charif which is sold is uncontaminated.

If the item was possibly cut with a non-kosher knife, and it is a bidieved situation such as it was already bought or you have a real need to buy it, you can eat the food items when as little as five were cut. If however there is no loss and it is easy to cut a slice off the end where it was cut, one should do this. </p>\n\n<p>This last chumra would seemingly apply to ginger imho but as in all cases like this, CYLOR of course.</p>\n\n\n",

That attitude led the Soviet Union, which had had overwhelming abundance of wheat fields etc., to fail miserably in the 40s because there was no \"capitalistic\" incentive to harvest the crops. </p>\n\n<p>Earlier, in chapter 2, the Rabbis give strong advice \"(Mishnah 8) One who increases Tzedaka, increases Shalom.\" But \"(Mishnah 17) the money of your colleague shall be as dear to you as your own.\"</p>\n\n<p>Despite the statement that increasing Tzedaka increases peace, nonetheless, the Rabbis frown on giving more than 20% of your income to Tzedaka (except perhaps, when one is blessed with vast wealth), for fear that one might not be able to recoup in the following year and be forced to collect charity himself!</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, there is a balance between the concepts of Chessed and Gevurah, which is reiterated throughout Judaism and leads to Tiferes, glory.</p>\n\n<p>There is certainly room to navigate these issues in halachic Judaism but to state that liberal views on \"abortion, homosexuality and Marxist socialism are the ones of 'real Jews'\" is absurd, to say the least. As usual, the Torah Halachic view on, e.g., abortion is neither strictly liberal (late term permissible) or strictly conservative (never under any circumstance). </p>\n\n<p>I have heard a Jewish abortion activist attempt to \"prove\" that abortion was perfectly alright because \"don't blame me, the Halacha states that a baby/fetus can be aborted until the last moment!\" based on Mishnah in Oholot, quoted in Gemara Sanhedrin, 72, that \"a fetus who is endangering the life of the mother may be taken out \"limb by limb\" up until the head presents itself.\" This argument is false for two reasons.</p>\n\n<p>(1) It is permissible because of the concept of Rodeph - i.e. one who is \"pursuing\" someone in order to murder him may be \"saved\" from \"committing murder\" by killing the Rodeph/pursuer. Ergo, one may take out the fetus \"limb by limb\" when the fetus threatens the life of the mother. BUT, the rule of Rodeph also states that if you are able to \"save\" him by hurting him, thus stopping the murder while not killing the potential murderer, you would be liable yourself for murder due to overreach. In the same way, to propose late term abortion (in all circumstances Other than when the fetus is literally endangering the mother's life, rather than giving birth and offering the baby up for adoption seems to be overreach and forbidden. This is the position of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein. Although the Israeli poseik Rav Eliezer Waldenberg is lenient in cases of severe emotional situations, as well as rape and incest, or Tay Sachs. </p>\n\n<p>(2)Secondly, abortion is not looked upon as a right of the woman rather as a protection for the woman. Halacha looks at abortion as a last ditch, very \"b'dieved\" (to be dissuaded, secondary) approach. Much closer to a right wing perspective.</p>\n\n<p>For a much fuller treatment of this issue, see Jewish Virtual Library, issues in Jewish Ethics: Abortion.

Is this just a contingent fact that we must accept or is there some kind of reason we can understand a bit why it must be so? Please source.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is no why.</p>\n<p>The first three laws in the Rambam's Code (Yesodei haTorah 1:1-3):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יסוד היסודות ועמוד החכמות לידע שיש שם מצוי ראשון והוא ממציא כל נמצא וכל הנמצאים משמים וארץ ומה שביניהם לא נמצאו אלא מאמתת המצאו.</p>\n<p>The foundation of foundations and the pillar of wisdoms [written in four words, initials \"Y-HV-H\"] is to know that there is a First Existence, and He brought into existence all that exists. Everything that exists from the heaven and the earth and what is between them do not exist except from the Truth of His Existence.</p>\n<p>ואם יעלה על הדעת שהוא אינו מצוי אין דבר אחר יכול להמצאות.</p>\n<p>If it would cross your mind that He does not exist, nothing else would be able to exist.</p>\n<p>ואם יעלה על הדעת שאין כל הנמצאים מלבדו מצויים הוא לבדו יהיה מצוי ולא יבטל הוא לבטולם שכל הנמצאים צריכין לו והוא ברוך הוא אינו צריך להם ולא לאחד מהם לפיכך אין אמתתו כאמתת אחד מהם.</p>\n<p>And if it would cross you mind that every existing thing other than Him would not exist, He alone would exist, and He Himself would not be annulled ever. For everything that exists require Him, and He (blessed be He) does not require them -- not one of them. Therefore His Truth is not like their truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We exist contingently. We happen to exist. But Hashem's Truth is not like our truth, Hashem <em>necessarily</em> exists.</p>\n<p>To ask \"why\" means that there were other possibilities and we want to know what caused one and not the other. But Hashem has no cause, and no other possibilities but Existing.</p>\n<p>(By the way, the Rambam has a proof of Hashem's Uniqueness and Indivisibility based on the idea that anything that has parts only exists contingent on those parts being aligned to make the whole. But we defined G-d as the initial necessary Existence which causes all the derived existences.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the OP's parameters:</p>\n\n<p>Either:</p>\n\n<p>A) G-D exists.</p>\n\n<p>B) Nothing exists.</p>\n\n<p>Since we are having this conversation, B is obviously false.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore A is true.</p>\n\n<p>If we define G-D like the Rambam (and others) defines Him, then there is no question at all. G-D is the one true entity. If everything was to cease besides Him, there would only be Him. He is not affected. If He were not to exist, then nothing would exist, because everything's existence depends on Him. He is eternal and was always there. (see Rambam, Yad HaChazakah, ch.1)</p>\n\n<p>\"Hashem, He is G-d, there is nothing else beside Him.\" Devarim 4:35</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, once it is true that there is only G-d and He is eternal etc.; one cannot ask why it is that way. It simply is. If the alternative of \"nothing\" were the reality, then it could also not be asked why it is so. It would just be nothing. There are no chances of either. It either is A or B.</p>\n\n<p>So the OP is correct: \"Is this just a contingent fact that we must accept ...\"</p>\n\n<p>Yes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm paraphrasing the Rambam's teachings in the propositions and first couple chapters of the second book of the Moreh. Essentially, that which passes from potentiality to actuality need something that already exists in actuality to effectuate that change. That which doesn't pass from potentiality, but always exists wholly in actuality, does not have any cause whatsoever. In plain English, things that change must be caused to change by something else, and that which doesn't ever change cannot be said to have any cause. A cause here is defined as an answer to a \"why\" question.</p>\n\n<p>Aristotelians such as the rambam recognize four different types of causes. Material causes, formal causes, efficient causes, and final causes. Only efficient causes and final causes are pertinent to your question, so I'll ignore the other two. If I was to ask why is there a table, I could give two types of answers. A carpenter built it (the efficient cause, what did it). Or I could say, to hold food (the final cause, what its purpose is).</p>\n\n<p>Your question, why does G-d exist as opposed to nothing can be rephrased as two different questions. 1) What caused G-d to exist, or 2) What is the purpose of G-d existing. The first is looking for an efficient cause, the second is looking for a final cause. However, G-d does not change. He is pure actuality with no potentiality. Therefore, you can't answer these questions. We know G-d is a pure actuality because everything which changes must have been changed by something else. For various reasons which aren't applicable to your question, this terminates at something which itself doesn't change. This is G-d, who has no causes as a matter of definition. Therefore your question doesn't make sense as it can be rephrased as \"what is the cause of the thing that has no causes?\"</p>\n\n<p>This is called a categorical error. You can't answer these questions, not because they are a mystery, or only G-d knows, or any other unsatisfactory answer. The question asks for an answer that is inapplicable to the subject. Another example would be like asking how much the color blue weighs. Color is not subject to weight, so the question doesn't make sense. G-d is not subject to causation, so the question doesn't make sense.</p>\n\n\n",

So far, the reaction has been ambivalence. The approx. 7 people I have spoken to have all acknowledged that it is a problem. Some thanked me for addressing the issue, openly (nice to get a \"thanks\", at least from SOMEONE, I guess?) But, essentially, I am getting the usual \"yeshivish\" shoulder shrug and hand waving attitude that says, \"That's nice, but the problem is so prevalent, that there's nothing I could do that would stop it or make any difference, because no one will listen to me, anyway.\"</p>\n\n<p>I'm really furious about this type of attitude. I also refuse to accept that there is absolutely no one notable or with clout that is willing to lend support on this issue. If you are aware of anyone who is willing to speak about this issue, regardless of where he is located in the world, I would appreciate knowing who and how I can contact this person.</p>\n\n<p>In advance, thanks for your help and understanding.</p>\n\n\n",

Part of Rav Hirsch's commentary emphasizes that the blessing gives the (non-free willed) animals the power to be fruitful and multiply unlike the free willed following of a commandment which a human being is capable of. That is why the commandment to a human being uses דבר</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... the fulfillment immediately followed the command. Hashem\n  <strong>blessed</strong> the organic living creatures, i.e. He gave them the power of reproduction \n  and multiplying, and with this power He gave them at\n  the same time the direction and urge for it.

A chicken hatches from its egg about 3 weeks after the hen lays it. Suppose that you keep the eggs in an incubator, and eventually you can see the egg bouncing around and hear the chick chirping in the egg as it is trying to break the egg shell. There is no question that there is a live chick inside. However, it is still in the egg, so it is not \"alive\" in the sense that it is out of its \"shelled\" environment in the \"world\". Would you be allowed to eat the egg with the live chick, then? What would be the (excuse the pun) \"breaking point\" at which you would be prohibited from eating the fertilized egg?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The answer to this is no. such an egg is not kosher as can be seen from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/82684/jewish/Kosher-Eggs.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kosher Eggs</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The prohibition of eating blood applies even to the smallest drop of\n  blood, and thus any blood spots found in an egg renders the egg\n  non-kosher.</p>\n  \n  <p>Each egg should be opened into a clear dish or glass and checked for\n  blood spots before it is cooked or combined with other food. If a\n  blood spot is found, the whole egg must be discarded, and the cup or\n  dish should be immediately and thoroughly washed with cold water.</p>\n  \n  <p>When boiling eggs, it is customary to boil at least three eggs at a\n  time. Some people have a separate pot just for boiling eggs.</p>\n  \n  <p>If a blood spot is found in a boiled egg, the whole egg must be\n  discarded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus once the egg has been fertilized and the chick develops enough to show a \"blood spot\" the egg is not kosher. This is well before the embryo has developed enough to be identified as a chicken. Note that <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/kosher-professionals/eggs-and-blood-spots/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eggs and Blood Spots</a> does deal with modern <strong>non-fertilized</strong> eggs that might develop a blood spot.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is in light of this modern reality that Harav Moshe Feinstein,\n  zt”l, (Igros Moshe, Yoreh Deah 1:36), clarifies that blood spots found\n  in commercially produced eggs do not present any fundamental kosher\n  problem. With respect to fertile eggs in the past, where a significant\n  doubt existed that the blood might represent a new embryo, it was\n  necessary to throw out the entire egg if it had a bloodspot. This is\n  also the reason why a minimum of three eggs were boiled at one time –\n  if one of them had a spot, it would be batel b’rov to the other two.\n  Today, however, the only concerns are maris ayin or dam beitzim (a\n  small amount of blood from a broken blood vessel in the hen, which is\n  not forbidden). As a result, the entire egg is never assur and\n  mei’ikar hadin removal of the blood spot would suffice. Moreover,\n  since the issur is not intrinsic to the egg, there is no problem with\n  cooking a single egg in a pot. Rav Moshe, however, writes that it is a\n  proper practice to dispose of the entire egg even today, as eggs are\n  not expensive and a person does not incur any significant loss.\n  Therefore, the requirement to check each egg remains in effect, as\n  does the requirement to dispose of eggs containing actual blood spots.\n  Nevertheless, in cases of doubt, difficulty or error, eggs are kosher,\n  even if checking was not done properly; moreover, if blood spots are\n  discovered during or after cooking, there is no problem with the\n  preparation utensils.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note: Fertilized eggs are available in the marketplace and are sold at\n  a premium. When purchasing organic or natural eggs, a consumer should\n  be careful to check the carton and/or contact the egg producer.\n  Consumers wishing to consume fertile eggs should consult a competent\n  Posek for guidelines. Some kashrus agencies will not certify eggs that\n  are intentionally produced as they were in the past, because of the\n  halachic complexities pertaining to those eggs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The beginning of the torah (staring from Breishit) uses the <em>Vavei Ha'amudim</em> standard (a style where the beginning of each column (with a few exceptions) begins with the letter <em>vav</em>). However, somewhere in the middle, the style is <strong>not</strong> <em>Vavei Ha'amudim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Is this mix halachically allowable when repairing or even creating a new Sefer Torah.

Maimonides, a 12th-century rabbi who was one of the foremost codifiers of Jewish law, says so in his <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Kings_and_Wars.11.4?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings and Wars 11:4</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם יעמוד מלך מבית דוד ... הרי זה בחזקת שהוא משיח</p>\n<p>If a king will arise from the House of David ... [who fulfills several conditions] ... we may, with assurance, consider him Moshiach. [translation from <a href=\"http://www.kesser.org/moshiach/rambam.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kesser.org</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is quite basic and is accepted by everyone (TTBOMK).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do we even know the descendants of the house of David?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people have claimed to be his descendants. We have no way of knowing for sure though, besides for genetic testing (and i don't think we have David's genes to compare against).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Should we then not keep a close watch on every human birth of every baby who are a descendant from the house of David? Should this not be a priority?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No. First off, we don't really have conclusive proof of who is and who isn't of the House of David. Second, watching the babies won't really help. Mashiach (the Messiah) will reveal himself when it is time through his actions. Continuing the quote from Maimonides at the beginning of the answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><p>ואם יעמוד מלך מבית דוד הוגה בתורה ועוסק במצות כדויד אביו, כפי תורה שבכתב ושבעל פה ויכוף כל ישראל לילך בה ולחזק בדקה ויילחם מלחמות ה' הרי זה בחזקת שהוא משיח אם עשה והצליח וניצח כל האומות שסביביו ובנה מקדש במקומו וקבץ נדחי ישראל הרי זה משיח בודאי</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>ואם לא הצליח עד כה, או נהרג--בידוע שאינו זה שהבטיחה עליו תורה, והרי הוא ככל מלכי בית דויד השלמים הכשרים שמתו.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If a king will arise from the House of David who delves deeply into the study of the Torah and, like David his ancestor, observes its mitzvos as prescribed by the Written Law and the Oral Law; if he will compel all of Israel to walk in [the way of the Torah] and repair the breaches [in its observance]; and if he will fight the wars of G-d; - we may, with assurance, consider him Moshiach.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If he succeeds in the above, builds the [Beis Ha]Mikdash on its site, and gathers in the dispersed remnant of Israel, he is definitely the Moshiach.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>If he did not succeed to this degree or he was killed, he surely is not [the redeemer] promised by the Torah. [Rather,] he should be considered as all the other proper and legitimate kings of the Davidic dynasty who died.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So watching babies wouldn't help, as there's no way to know until he fulfills his duties and is crowned king.</p>\n<p>See also, (linked by @Danno in the comments), <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JewFAQ on Mashiach</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Or is there some other basis? If so, since most people know how to read prayers, now, why do we need a chazzan, currently?</p>\n\n<p>When did <em>shlichei tzibbur</em>, or for that matter, congregational prayers begin, in the format that we still have today? I assume that before the formalized siddur, people said whatever prayers they wished, individually.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>You ask why we historically needed a <em>shali'ach tzibur</em>, when did they begin and why do we still need today?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.naaleh.com/the-role-of-a-chazzan-v8n37\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R Ari Jacobson</a> provides a first summary according to two different approaches</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Back in the days when printed texts were not yet accessible, many Jews\n  didn’t own siddurim and sefarim as we do today. Although there was a\n  small segment of very learned scholars, there was also a significant\n  percentage of people who were less educated than the masses of today\n  and could not daven on their own. This was the original context in\n  which the concept of chazarat hashatz evolved. <strong>The shaliach tzibur\n  would repeat the text of the amidah in order to enable those who\n  didn't know how to pray to fulfill their obligation.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>This is in consonance with the principle of shomea k’onah. If I listen\n  to a blessing and I have in mind to fulfill it, it’s considered as if\n  I actually recited the blessing myself. The source for this is in the\n  Navi that describes the reading of the Torah by Shafan Hasofer, the\n  scribe of King Yoshiyahu. The Navi says that King Yoshiyahu read from\n  the Torah. Actually, the king just listened with the intention of\n  fulfilling his obligation and it was considered as if he read the\n  words himself. So too, in early times, the chazzan would pray out loud\n  and those who couldn’t do so on their own would listen, answer amen,\n  and receive credit for having prayed.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Most people today pray on their own. Why do we still continue the\n  custom of chazarat hashatz?</strong> The Rambam has a famous responsum in which\n  he writes to a community that was not careful with chazarat hashatz.\n  He states that today there isn’t much of a reason for the chazzan to\n  repeat the amidah and even if we say one must hold on to the customs\n  of our forefathers, if people will just sit and talk it is better to\n  do away with the custom. Most communities did not accept this view.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>There’s a second approach that suggests that perhaps the repetition of\n  the amidah and other prayer services is not just to help those who\n  cannot daven.</strong> Rav Soloveitchik notes that in the time of the Beit\n  Hamikdash the Jewish nation brought individual sacrifices as well as\n  communal offerings. Today the silent portion of the shemeonei esrei\n  represents the individual sacrifice and the repetition represents the\n  communal sacrifice. Even if one can pray on his own, there is still an\n  obligation of participating in the offering of the congregation.</p>\n  \n  <p>Earlier sources such as the Beit Yosef and the Maharik reflect this\n  approach. For this reason, the Maharik suggests that just as in the\n  Beit Hamikdash, the kohen who offered the korbonot had to do so with\n  the agreement of the people, so too the shaliach tzibur represents the\n  community with his public prayers. The Avnei Nezer writes that a\n  chazzan should be careful not to lengthen the davening. Just as a\n  korbon was brought on behalf of the participants, so too the chazarat\n  hashatz is offered on behalf of the congregation and should be done\n  with their full consent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>R Adin Steinsaltz in <a href=\"http://a.co/a9arFjd\" rel=\"noreferrer\">A Guide to Jewish Prayer</a> offers a similar view</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Initially, the function of the Shaliah Tzibbur' in public prayer\n  services was created by reason of practical necessity</strong>. Since the\n  prayers had not yet been written down and many people did not know\n  them by heart, there was a need for someone well versed in the prayer\n  formulations. This person was to intone them in a strong voice, so\n  that others could repeat them after him, or could listen and respond\n  with Amen at the end of every benediction thus fulfilling their\n  obligation to pray. Even when the number of people familiar with the\n  prayers grew, every congregation still had some individuals in need of\n  a Shaliah Tzibbur. For this reason, it was ruled that after the\n  congregants conclude the silent recitation of the Amidah, the Shaliah\n  Tzibbur would repeat it aloud, thus enabling the general public to\n  fulfill its prayer obligations. This is what is called Hazarat\n  ha-Shatz — the repetition of the Amidah prayer by the Shaliah Tzibbur\n  which is an integral part of public prayer to this day (Shatz comes\n  from the initials of the words SHAliah TZibbur).</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The repetition of the Amidah was of particular importance on festival\n  days</strong>, and even more so on Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur  whose special\n  prayers were not remembered accurately by most of the worshippers, and\n  certainly could not be fluently recited by all (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.34b.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">TB Rosh haShana\n  34b</a> and 35a). However, in time, as the prayers were written down\n  and compiled into books that were taught even to little children who\n  had just learned to read and prayer formulations became familiar to\n  all, the repetition of the Amidah continued merely as a traditional\n  practice, not as an actual necessity.</p>\n  \n  <p>Indeed, Maimonides in his day ruled that this repetition should be\n  abolished, since everyone had already recited the Armidah in a\n  befitting manner; as a result, people would converse during its\n  repetition by the Shaliah Tzibbur, or engage in other activities,\n  demonstrating disrespect for the prayer and the synagogue, which mould\n  be considered a form of desecration.

I heard that some rabbis do not allow candles to be lit at the hall in the shul but instruct whomever is making the simcha to advise their guests to light at their host's home where they will be sleeping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That question <a href=\"/a/64571\">was answered</a>: light at home and spend time at night with the flames; some say that if that's not possible then you can light where you eat, even with saying a blessing. (See there for more detail.)</p>\n\n<p>My question asks about lighting candles erev yontif.  Is the answer the same as for erev Shabbat or are there differences in the two candle lightings? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This actually can be answered by logic. On Yom Tov one is allowed to light a candle from an existing flame. As a result, one would light the candle at home upon returning there. Since one would do this at once, the light of the candles would now be used and be yotzei lighting the candles.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/114392/jewish/Holiday-Candle-Lighting-Procedure.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">For example</a> Thus, if one eats out, one can light the Yom Tov candles upon returning home (from the stove flame or lit yahrtzeit candle).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>while it is forbidden to create a flame on a holiday, it is permitted\n  to light a candle using a pre-existing flame, such as another candle\n  that was kindled before the holiday, a gas range which has been left\n  on, or a pilot flame</p>\n  \n  <p>On the first night of a holiday: Ideally the candles should be lit –\n  just as on every Friday afternoon – eighteen minutes before sunset.3\n  However, the candles can be lit anytime before the holiday meal.4 If\n  the candles are lit after sunset, they should be lit from a\n  pre-existing flame. Exceptions: a) If the first night of the holiday\n  is Friday night, the candles must be kindled before sunset. b) If the\n  first night of the holiday is Saturday night, the candles must be\n  kindled after nightfall (from a pre-existing flame).</p>\n  \n  <p>On the second night of a holiday: The candles should be lit, from a\n  pre-existing flame, after nightfall.5 (Additionally, all preparations\n  for the candle lighting, such as arranging the candlesticks and\n  candles, may not start before nightfall.6) If the second night of the\n  holiday is Friday night, the candles must be kindled before sunset,\n  also from a pre-existing flame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Can we assume that it was Hebrew, in some form? (I'm basing that assumption based on a Midrash that I heard in yeshiva that the world was founded on the Torah and the Hebrew letters and language existed prior to the founding of the Torah. I may not be paraphrasing the Midrash fully correctly, but that was its gist.)</p>\n\n<p>2 - I must be missing something in the translation of the 2nd verse that says that a person did not understand what his neighbor was saying. Isn't the purpose of language to be able to communicate with your neighbor? If your neighbor doesn't underdstand what you're saying, then why are you talking to him? And, besides, in this case, since ALL humans spoke the same language previously, if a person saw that his neighbor didn't understand his current language, why couldn't he just communicate to him in the old language, or was it that G-d made all humanity forget the original language? </p>\n\n\n",

So when you see modern jewelry advertised as \"Abulafia's Etz Chayim,\" it's probably not actually based on any manuscript or printed book we know of.

And for babies that suffer at birth and righteous people that seem to suffer for no reason, are actually receiving the consequences of Averot in their past lives. Ok, this seems to answer the reason for any suffering in the world.</p>\n\n<p>But if that's so, then why did Hevel suffer? He was killed by his brother with a stone to the head; he didn't just suffer, he lived a short life and had no descent. To my knowledge he did nothing wrong, in fact he was very righteous. And he couldn't possibly be a reincarnation, there just weren't any deaths before him.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R. Abraham Vitirbo raises a variation of this question at <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43991&st=&pgnum=105\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the end of the Fifth Essay of Sefer Emunat Chachamim</a>. He mentions that many people are confused because the Mishnah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37946&st=&pgnum=322\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 2:6</a>) states that Hillel saw a skull floating in the water and said \"you were killed because you killed\". These people thus wonder why Hevel was killed if he never killed anyone.</p>\n\n<p>R. Abraham first quotes an explanation from the kabbalists, who say that Hevel \"cut the shoots\" like Ben Zoma (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=13&daf=14b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 14b</a>) and he looked and he died.<sup>1</sup> R. Abraham then says that the kabbalists might be correct but he knows not of kabbalah, nor did his teachers. Instead he suggests that the Mishnah does not mean that anyone who gets killed must have killed; rather, it just means that anyone who kills will get killed, and it is also possible for other people to coincidentally get killed.</p>\n\n<p>While this approach deals with the fact that Hevel was killed, it doesn't really address whether he did anything wrong to begin with. It's possible that R. Abraham is suggesting that Hevel was indeed killed for no reason, or it could be that he did something else wrong (not killing) and for that he was punished by being killed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> in his commentary to Genesis Chapter Four writes that it is possible Hevel glorified himself over Cain for having attained a greater craft:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואפשר שכבר התפאר בזה הענין הבל ואם לא סופר בתורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While he doesn't specifically say that Hevel deserved to be killed because of this, perhaps this is \"something wrong\" that Hevel did.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. This is not entirely clear because in the actual passage in Chagigah these are three different people — Acher who cut the shoots, Ben Azzai who looked and died, and Ben Zoma who looked and lost his mind:</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><sup>Our Rabbis taught: Four men entered the ‘Garden’, namely, Ben ‘Azzai and Ben Zoma,\n  Aher, and R. Akiba. R. Akiba said to them: When ye arrive at the stones of pure marble, say not,\n  water, water! For it is said: He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.\n  Ben ‘Azzai cast a look and died. Of him Scripture says: Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death\n  of His saints. Ben Zoma looked and became demented. Of him Scripture says: Hast thou found\n  honey? Eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. Aher\n  mutilated the shoots. R. Akiba departed unhurt.

Nobody paid for it. It was just put in by the Times.\nWhen the production manager of the New York Times – an Irish Catholic – was asked about it, his answer was right on the mark. And it speaks to the eternity of our people. And to the power of the Jewish tradition and its women.\nThe production manager explained: “We don’t know what will happen in the year 2100.

Then the obligation of kiddush starts.</p>\n\n<p>As to drinking during shaharit (since you ask when exactly does the leniency end): technically one cannot interrupt between psukei dzimrah and shmonei esrei (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.51.4?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA OC 51.4</a>) so it appears <strong>one can drink until right before starting psukei dzimrah</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Note one cannot make a full meal until one has prayed Mussaf but fruit or less than 54 grams or cake is allowed (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.286.3?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA OC 286.3</a>).</p>\n\n<p>And if you need a practical ruling <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10103/how-do-you-cylor-after-posting-on-judaism-stackexchange-com\">CYLOR</a> as there are leniencies for e.g., sick or older people. It is also possible one could even drink during psukei dzimrah if one has already said <em>sheakol</em> as the SA <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.51.4?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">above</a> discusses speaking as an interruption.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-kiddish.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Star-K article</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On Shabbos morning, men may drink water, tea or coffee before Shachris\n  (after brochos), but may not eat and may not drink “chashuva\n  beverages” (e.g. alcoholic beverages) unless they are required for\n  health purposes.  After Shachris, one may not eat or drink until after\n  Kiddush. </p>\n  \n  <p>A woman who normally davens may eat or drink before davening after\n  reciting morning brochos.  According to some Poskim,42 on Shabbos if\n  she needs to eat before davening, she is not required to recite\n  Kiddush at that time.  Once she has completed davening Shachris, she\n  must hear Kiddush before eating or drinking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My understanding of the above is that you can have coffee as long as you haven't started Shacharit, and you would have to say the \"birkot hashachar\" first, anyway. Once you have past that point, you have to wait for Kiddush, if you're male.</p>\n\n<p>FWIW, this would explain the \"schnapps clubs\" in many shuls, where people make Kiddush between Shacharit and Musaph. (Many shuls in my neighborhood, have a no alcohol policy which includes no wine, as well. Kiddush in shul is said on grape juice.)</p>\n\n\n",

Since the conditions for allowing the removal of cuticles is subject to debate, we must be stringent and avoid removing cuticles under all circumstances, even if the skin is mostly detached and one experiences discomfort. However, Rabbi Moshe Halevi (Israel, 1961-2001), in his Menuhat Ahaba (vol. 12, Siman 11), writes that in such a case, where the skin is mostly detached and one experiences discomfort, he may ask a gentile to remove it for him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Cuticles are dead skin.)</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.jewishpathways.com/laws-of-shabbat/gozez-no-need-be-sheepish\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Like hair and nails, skin is a part of the body that grows (or more precisely, regenerates).

Perhaps, this is where the main focus of <em>Pirkei Avot</em> comes along to \"fill in the gaps\". I think Rabbi Yonah and Barternurah commentary on Pirkei Avot's 1st Mishnah which states \"Moses received the Torah at Sinai\" delve into some detail on what the term \"Torah\" means, and eventually, explain something about how Pirkei Avot, which deals with ethics, is part of the Torah.

    "content": "# Are there any recent statistics showing the \"marriage longevity\" rate for shidduch arranged marriages?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There has been a \"local\" campaign in my neighborhood, recently, suggesting that young singles should only use <em>shidduchim</em> (matchmakers) when seeking to become married. Part of the \"ad\" campaign suggests that <em>shidduchim</em> have a high success rate of long marriages and a happy family life.</p>\n\n<p>I am somewhat skeptical that this is true. I've read, heard about, and even seen many cases of marriages that had been arranged by <em>shidduch</em> that ended in divorce within 3 - 5 years (some last as little as 1 month!) I don't think that the <em>shidduch</em> marriage has a significantly more or less marriage longevity rate than other setups such as couples meeting each other somewhere, or online dating methods.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to submit a letter to the editor refuting this claim, but, I'd like to know if any reliable organizations have provided recent reliable statistics on this trend. </p>\n\n<p>Per @Daniel's question (a good one!) For now, I'd limit it to Jewish marriages done by professional matchmakers only; not those arranged by family / friends or a rabbi on an individual or infrequent basis. By \"professional\" this could be via a shadchan(it) or online or on-site \"service\" that does this as their business. I think that the \"ad\" campaign implies using professional matchmakers, i.e shidduchim. . (Yes, I know that there is prob. marketing \"bias\" in making this claim, which is one of my motives to attempt to refute it! I'm not keen on frum people making money from gullible believers.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> - for purposes of this question, I'm interested only in marriage / divorce stats. I know of many couples that remain in awful, sometimes dangerous abusive marriages. While, I don't suggest that this is always the best idea, for purposes of the stats I'm seeking, such situations would be out of scope. I may seek a separate study on this issue, later.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>It is very difficult to find accurate statistics on divorce, and differences between countries are so great that any answer can only be useful from a specific countries' perspective. Finding prevalence statistics specifically focused on shidduchim is even harder. On of the problem of using divorce statistics is that part of the high reported rates of divorce is that people who get divorced also can remarry, and remarriages tend to be less stable than first marriages. This inflates the overall divorce statistics.</p>\n\n<p>A published study by Kennedy and Ruggles in 2014 seems to suggest that the high rates of divorce have dropped after the 90's (as defined as the percentage of ever-married persons who have ever been divorced or separated, as opposed to the incidence of divorced. Their study shows that in 2010 the divorce rate amongst people aged 20-24 is around 15%, and steadily climbs to about 45% peaking at ages 50-54.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Like the statistics on the incidence of divorce shown in Fig. 4, the\n  prevalence statistics in Fig. 5 show a decline in marital instability\n  from 1980 to 2010 among younger ever-married people. This decline is\n  more than cancelled out, however, by a massive increase among persons\n  in their 50s. By 2010, almost one-half of ever-married persons had\n  been divorced or separated by the time they reached their late 50s.\n  The shifting age pattern of divorce suggests a cohort effect. The same\n  people who had unprecedented divorce incidence in 1980 and 1990 when\n  they were in their 20s and 30s are now in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. The\n  Baby Boom generation was responsible for the extraordinary rise in\n  marital instability after 1970. They are now middle-aged, but their\n  pattern of high marital instability continues. As Brown and Lin (2012)\n  pointed out, part of this may simply be a consequence of the high\n  divorce rates that they experienced earlier in life, given that\n  remarriages tend to be less stable than first marriages.”</p>\n  \n  <p>source: Kennedy S, Ruggles S. (2014). Breaking Up Is Hard to Count:\n  The Rise of Divorce in the United States, 1980–2010. Demography,\n  51(2), 587-598. doi:10.1007/s13524-013-0270-9.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These rates contrast somewhat with the closest study that specifically focuses on the demographics of religious groups and that is the <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/chapter-3-demographic-profiles-of-religious-groups/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">2014 pew religious landscape study</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It reports that 9% of the american jewish population is divorced or separated, but this number is difficult to compare to other studies, because it merely surveys who is married and who is divorced, and is not comparable to a divorce rate.</p>\n\n<p>More problematic is that it doesn't answer your question about the success of shidduchim, because this statistic (or the pew study in general) distinguishes between jews who used matchmakers and jews who found partners 'naturally'. I am not aware of many studies that focus on divorce rates in marriages due to shidduchim. The one that I know of shows the rate of divorce in Israel (not comparable with the numbers shown above) and then: only in the haredi community, which is such a specific community that it is very difficult to extrapolate it to the larger jewish community that makes use of shidduchim. It would seem that in this specific haredi population in Israel the divorce rate is relatively low: lower than found in most other western countries. Caution must be excercised in comparing the rates, because the haredi community is different in many respects to the general (jewish) populations that are part of census data in other countries.</p>\n\n<p>The study by Greenberg, Buchbinder and Witzum in 2012 cites a study from 1995 and states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Consistent with these values, the population census carried out in\n  Israel in 1995 found that being single was relatively rare in the\n  ultra-orthodox community: among those aged 25–34, 12% of\n  ultra-orthodox males were single in contrast with 35% of\n  non-ultra-orthodox males, while only 5% of ultra-orthodox females were\n  single in contrast with 20% of non-ultra-orthodox females. Although it\n  is not difficult to divorce in ultra-orthodox society, the sanctity of\n  marriage (and the difficult aftermath of divorce for a couple with\n  many children) may contribute to the relative rarity of divorce: in\n  the 1995 census, 1.3% of ultra-orthodox males were divorced in\n  contrast with 3% of non-ultra-orthodox males, while 1.5% of\n  ultra-orthodox females were divorced in contrast with 6% of\n  ultra-orthodox females. Further, the average age at first marriage for\n  ultra-orthodox males was 21.3 years (27.2 for non-ultra-orthodox\n  males), and for ultra-orthodox females it was 19.9 years (24.8 years\n  for non-ultra-orthodox females) (Gurovich & Cohen-Kastro, 2004). “</p>\n  \n  <p>source: Greenberg, D., Buchbinder, J. T., & Witztum, E. (2012). Arranged matches and mental illness: therapists’ dilemmas. Psychiatry, 75(4), 342-354.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, to try to answer the question; No, it does not seem to be that there are recent statistics. The closest peer-reviewed shidduch-specific statistics seem to be around 20 years old, and people with access to israeli census data might find more recent data. Regardless, it seem that in haredi communities divorce rates after arranged matches are low, but it is nigh impossible to extrapolate this to the broader community of jews that use shidduchim, and difficult to compare them to non-shidduch marriages and countries.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, even if there would be data that would allow for in-country in-cohort comparisons of the succesrate of marriages between shidduchim and 'regular' marriage, the problem would still be that no such comparison on natural groups can be made in good conscience. To say that one factor is the actual cause of an observed phenomenon ideally one would have two groups that are exactly alike and in which only the supposed cause varies. In natural groups this is not the case. The community that uses shidduchim is notably different from other groups in the values they hold, family dynamics, etc. No amount of statistical correction can truly remove these systematic differences between groups. Any comparison should be made with great caution</p>\n\n\n",

Ya'akov Bachrach (<em>Nimukei HaGRIV</em>, printed in the back of many editions of the Talmud) has a note on this Rashi, referencing a similarly worded discussion in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.104b.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 104b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מתני׳ העוף עולה עם הגבינה על השולחן ואינו נאכל דברי ב\"ש וב\"ה אומרים לא עולה ולא נאכל א\"ר יוסי זו מקולי ב\"ש ומחומרי ב\"ה...גמ׳ רבי יוסי היינו ת\"ק...הא קמשמע לן מאן תנא קמא רבי יוסי כל האומר דבר בשם אומרו מביא גאולה לעולם שנאמר (אסתר ב, כב) ותאמר אסתר למלך בשם מרדכי‏</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>MISHNA: The</strong> meat of <strong>birds may be placed with cheese on</strong> one <strong>table but</strong> may <strong>not be eaten</strong> together with it; this is <strong>the statement of Beit Shammai.

As it is stated</strong> with respect to the incident of Bigthan and Teresh: <strong>“And Esther reported it to the king in the name of Mordecai”</strong> (Esther 2:22), and Mordecai was later rewarded for saving the king’s life, paving the way for the miraculous salvation.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>(<strong>Translation</strong> and elucidation from sefaria.org)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Chullin.104b.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> there comments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והתנא שכח ולא הזכיר שמו בתחילה וחזר והזכיר שמו</p>\n  \n  <p>And the <em>tanna</em> forgot and did not mention his name at first, and then went back and mentioned his name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bringing this all back to the passage from Shabbat under discussion here, it appears that your first option is correct - Rashi means that R. Menachem is the author of the first part of the <em>beraita</em>.</p>\n\n<p>To answer your questions:</p>\n\n<p>a) Rashi knows this because of the seeming redundancy of R. Menachem's words. R. Menachem's statement that this is a stringency which applies to erasing over writing does not add anything to the first statement (just like R. Yosei's statement in the <em>mishnah</em> in Chullin does not add anything to the <em>tanna kamma</em>'s words). Something else must be going on here, and we conclude that, indeed, the sole purpose of R. Menachem's concluding statement in the <em>beraita</em> is to point out the he is in fact the author of the entire <em>beraita</em>.</p>\n\n<p>b) The apparent implication that the <em>tanna kamma</em>'s words were not actually spoken by R. Menachem can be explained like Rashi says in Chullin. The first part of the <em>beraita</em> was erroneously taught anonymously. This was subsequently corrected by adding a seemingly superfluous addition in the name of R. Menachem to point out his authorship of the first part.</p>\n\n<p>c) It is important for us to know this because of the principle that whoever reports a statement in the name of the one who said it brings redemption to the world (as well as explaining away the seeming redundancy of R. Menachem's statement at the end of the <em>beraita</em>). </p>\n\n\n",

There are two ways one can read that phrase: it can mean \"reddened hides of rams\", that the hides were reddened, or \"hides of reddened rams\", that the rams were reddened.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"//he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Rashi</em> ad loc.</a> says it means \"reddened hides of rams\", that the hides were reddened. However, <a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=273\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Rashi</em> to <em>Bavli Shabas</em> 75 (s.v. משום נטילת נשמה)</a> lists \"reddened rams\" on a list with other animals that were killed for use in the <em>mishkan</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Why does <em>Rashi</em> feel a need to say the latter explanation, that the rams were reddened, different from his own on <em>Chumash</em>, in his commentary to <em>Shabas</em>? It seems to me that the <em>Bavli</em> would make perfect sense even if it were discussing unreddened rams, and <em>Rashi</em> could have omitted the word \"reddened\".</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are a few possible answers and facts here that build on each other:</p>\n\n<p>1) A previous comment of Rashi just before on 75a, already spelled out the case by saying we do not learn out \"from the red dyed <strong><em>skins</em></strong> of rams\"..etc. because they did not need to be specifically killed by \"shechitah\". (Apparently they were not needed to be eaten or offered, but merely used as furnishings.)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Rashi did not need to use the full three word title for the rams by the time of his second comment. So, any \"diyuk\" is inconclusive.</p>\n\n<p>2) The wording in Rashi says \"Taking of a life (as a melachah) occurred in the Mishkan by the reddened rams, \"Tachash\" and \"Chilazon fish\".\" The word \"skins\" would be a clumsy addition to the sentence, since skins don't have their lives taken, but rams do. Therefore, we can assume Rashi shortened the wording because he already spelled it out before, and its better shortened. It is fair to say the reader would still understand \"reddened rams\" as the short version of the Torah's \"reddened ram's skins\".</p>\n\n<p>3) However, you ask that Rashi could have simply written \"rams\" ?! That would be even shorter and satisfy the above without any confusion at all?</p>\n\n<p>So, there is an argument between Rashi and Rav Hai Gaon. Are the first eleven melachos for the purpose of growing/processing herbs for dyeing the tapestries and ram skins, or for making the show breads and other mincha offerings? Rashi holds it was for dyes and not for the bread. See Rashi, 73a \"HaOpheh\" and Gemara 74b. Rashi says that baking was not in the Mishkan.</p>\n\n<p>The argument is about if an Av Melochah can only be something used to construct the mishkan (Rashi) or can even be used during an offering brought in the Mishkan (Rav Hai Gaon).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if Rashi had simply said \"rams\" as an example of taking life, it could be misconstrued as any ram (like a \"korban\" as well as the red rams). That would be incorrect, since slaughtering an offering could never be counted as an Av melochah according to Rashi. Therefore the proper language for this comment was \"reddened rams\".</p>\n\n<p>4) \"Reddened rams\" could also hint at something else in Rashi. The Gemara Yerushalmi in Perek Klal Gadol, says that the melochah of dyeing (colors) was accomplished with the skins of the \"reddened rams\". This means that before the animal was slaughtered, they beat the rams with sticks to cause bruising which would redden the skin. Rashi, (as you know in Chumash-see OP), does not bring this Yerushalmi, but rather says that the skins were dyed red after slaughter.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, there is a three way argument about the act of causing bleeding on Shabbos. What melochah is it? a) Dyeing the skins b) Extracting the liquid called blood from the flesh which is Taking life \"Ki hadam Hu Hanefesh\"(parshat reeh) c) Weakening the living through extraction of blood</p>\n\n<p>Tosfos on 107a (beginning of Perek Shemoneh Sheratzim) and here on 75a near the bottom (Ki Heychi), point out that taking even some blood is the melochah of taking a life, even if the creature does not die. (some say the Rambam only lists it as extracting a liquid, so he holds that taking partial blood is not taking a life, since nothing died.) </p>\n\n<p>Rashi himself on 107a, brings a first opinion and a second. First, Rashi says that causing a bruise is taking life. Second, he brings an alternate opinion that the bruise is dyeing the skins.</p>\n\n<p>Tosfos explain that Rashi really holds that the first opinion is the main one.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it is proper to say that the opinion which Rashi brings in Chumash is true, along with the Yerushalmi's opinion, which is also true. The rams were bruised while alive, slaughtered, skinned, and then the skins were dyed further. However, Rashi comments in Chumash, to show that the (main?) melochah of dying is not like the Yerushalmi (bruising), probably because we usually pasken like the Bavli (regular dyeing of skins after death soaked in solution)instead.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in Rashi's comment to 75b, he is teaching us an additional point. \"Taking of life occurred in the Mishkan with the \"reddened rams\"...etc.</p>\n\n<p>By saying that \"reddened rams\" are included in taking life, instead of just \"rams\", Rashi shows us that the slaughter of the ram, <strong>AND</strong> the \"reddening\" (read \"bruising\") were both part of the category of taking life (as opposed to the Rambam who holds its only extracting, and as opposed to the Yerushalmi who holds it is the example of dyeing). </p>\n\n<p>(Note: The Bavli also includes causing bleeding with dyeing the skin. However, this is reflected in the opinion of Rav on 75a-b, as bleeding during/after \"shechitah\" that reddens the neck wound area. However, this coincides with death. The Yerushalmi counts bruising as dyeing which occurs while the animal is still alive as you know.)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, for all of the above, Rashi used \"reddened rams\" in Shabbos 75b and \"skins dyed  red\" in his commentary on Chumash.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps, :)</p>\n\n\n",

In my experience, I have not heard of anybody who disagrees with this.  This is an unusual situation, though, since normally a plain <code>k</code> does not indicate reliable <em>kashrut</em> supervision.  Apparently those cereals are under the supervision of the Rabbinical Council of New England (see linked question), but for some reason Kellogg's does not mark the boxes as being under their certification.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://kvhkosher.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbinical Council of New England</a> actually <em>has</em> its own logo which looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/17jIy.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/17jIy.png\" alt=\"KVH Logo\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I have seen the KVH logo on restaurants in Boston such as <a href=\"http://kvhkosher.org/places/united-states/massachusetts/brookline/restaurant/cafe-eilat/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cafe Eilat</a> which the Young Israel of Brookline <a href=\"http://yibrookline.org/wp/kosher-food/restaurants/#cafe_eilat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lists</a> as kosher. This in addition to the fact that well-known organizations stand by their certification of Kellogg's foods indicates to me that they seem to indeed be a reliable <em>kashrut</em> organization. So why doesn't their logo appear on Kellogg's cereal boxes?</p>\n\n<p>I do not believe that the reason is simply because the symbol is less well-known (compared to OU or OK). A <em>hechsher</em> that some people would have to look up still seems better than something that is not a real <em>hechsher</em> at all.</p>\n\n<p>I also don't believe that the reason is so that they can change at any time (as suggested in the comments on the other post).  Kellogg's does print OU and OK on products certified by those organizations, and the same rule should apply. In any case, I just don't see what is gained by printing a K rather than KVH.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Printing a typical Kosher symbol on a label represents a significant commitment on the part of the company. Not only do they have to maintain the item as Kosher, they have to maintain it as Kosher by this specific agency. If they have a falling out, they could have an inventory of labels easily worth over a million dollars and no way to use it without removing the trademarked symbol from each label, a very manual and defacing process.</p>\n\n<p>Because a plain K symbol is not fully helpful to the consumer, the Kosher agencies have been successful in convincing companies to use the trademark on the label. It used to be more common to see \"plain K\" items from national certification agencies, but the practice is close to eliminated in recent years. The OU and the OK almost always insist on it at this point.</p>\n\n\n",

In that case, he writes (without citing sources, unfortunately):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This Halacha [referring to continuing after you've started the first aliya] applies only if a Minyan was present when the first Oleh began reciting the Beracha of “Asher Bahar Banu.” <strong>If the tenth man left while the first Oleh recited “Barechu,” before he began reciting the Beracha of “Asher Bahar Banu,” the Torah may not be read.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If even for the case where you started with a <em>minyan</em> you would stop if you lose the <em>minyan</em> before the opening <em>b'racha</em> is completed, then it seems logical that if you never had the <em>minyan</em> in the first place you would not continue past this point upon discovering the problem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2012/09/05/reading-from-torah-without-minyan/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">This article from DinOnline</a> addresses the question of reading <em>l'hatchilah</em> without a <em>minyan</em> for the purpose of educating minors.  It cites the Mishnah (Megillah 23) for saying that a <em>minyan</em> is required to read torah.  It then addresses this <em>chinuch</em> case and says that you still shouldn't but there is room for leniency <em>without</em> the <em>b'rachot</em>.  It then adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[A] number of commentaries understand that the reading from the Torah is considered a davar she-bikdushah specifically because of the recitation of Barchu and the blessings before the Torah. This is stated by the Meiri, by the Kesef Mishnah, and by others.</p>\n<p>According to this, reading from the Torah without Barchu will not be a problem, even where ten men are not present.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(It goes on to talk about reading for learning versus reading as <em>d'var sh'bikdushah</em>, but I don't think that applies in your case.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2012/10/womens-only-torah-reading/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">This article from Torah Musings by Rabbi Michael Broyde</a> talks about women's torah readings (without <em>b'rachot</em>) and argues that it is inadvisable but not <em>strictly</em> forbidden.</p>\n<p>Since the lack of the <em>minyan</em> was discovered before the torah reading began, according to the first you don't read and according to the second and third you might be able to read without the <em>b'rachot</em> (though this is not advised).</p>\n<p>None of these address what to do with the <em>sefer torah</em> that has been taken out but cannot be used.  But the cases of both the school and the women's group do, of course, use a scroll, so those are cases where, <em>l'hatchilah</em>, a <em>sefer torah</em> is read from without performing the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>kri'at torah</em>.</p>\n<p>Possible counter-argument to which I have no answer: the children and women are still Jews, while the gentile is not.  Maybe that makes a difference.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>This is my own reasoning based on the above.</p>\n<p>If you knew you didn't have a <em>minyan</em> then you wouldn't have taken out the torah, but you discovered the problem too late.</p>\n<p>There are cases where, strictly speaking, you can read from a <em>sefer torah</em> without a <em>minyan</em>, without <em>b'rachot</em> (education of children, women's readings), though it is not advised <em>l'hatchilah</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Halacha</em> is generally more lenient for a <em>b'diaved</em> situation, and honor is due to the <em>sefer torah</em> that is already out.</p>\n<p>My conclusion: read a minimum amount from the <em>sefer torah</em> for the explicit purpose of education, without <em>b'rachot</em>, and then put the scroll away and proceed as normal when you lack a <em>minyan</em>.</p>\n<p>Finally, take steps to reduce the chance of a recurrence.  Instead of waiting for the start of the torah service to ask a visitor to accept an <em>aliyah</em>, consider asking <em>anybody</em> you don't know whether he is a <em>kohein</em>, <em>levi</em>, or <em>yisrael</em> as soon as possible after he arrives.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, the ArtScroll <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9780899066509.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siddur Kol Ya'akov</a> writes it one way*, whereas the ArtScroll <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9780899060972.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siddur Yitzchak Yair</a> writes it the other way*.</p>\n\n<p>Is there some disagreement among codices or rabbinic sources that might explain this?

See verses 11 - 13.:</p>\n\n<p>(11) And if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young\npigeons, then he who sinned shall bring as his offering one tenth of an ephah of\nfine flour for a sin offering; he shall not put oil on it, nor shall he place\nfrankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering. (12) He shall bring it to the priest, and\nthe priest shall scoop out a fistful as a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,\nupon the fires of the L-rd; it is a sin offering. (13) The priest shall make atonement\nfor him from his sin which he had committed in any one of these [instances], and\nhe shall be forgiven; and [the rest of] it shall belong to the priest, like the meal\noffering. </p>\n\n<p>Flour does not contain animal parts or blood.</p>\n\n<p>2) <strong>Incense</strong> :</p>\n\n<p>Numbers: 17:12 \"Aaron took as Moses had spoken and ran to the midst of the congregation, and behold, the plague had begun among the people. He placed the incense and provided atonement for the people.\"</p>\n\n<p>Incense does not contain animal parts or blood.</p>\n\n<p>3) <strong>Jewelry</strong> :</p>\n\n<p>Numbers 31:50 \"So we have brought an offering for G-d; what any man found of golden vessels, anklet and bracelet, ring, earing, and clasp, to atone for our souls before    G-d.\"</p>\n\n<p>4) <strong>Charity and loving kindness (as well as justice and humility)</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Proverbs 16:6 \"Through loving kindness and truth will iniquity be atoned; and\nthrough the fear of the L-rd [you] depart from evil.\"</p>\n\n<p>Daniel 4:24 [27 in Christian Bibles] \"Only, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to\nyou, and your sins will be with charity removed, and your iniquities by showing\nmercy to the poor; indeed, your tranquility will be prolonged.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hosea 6:6 \"For loving-kindness is what I desire, and not sacrifice; and knowledge\nof G-d more than burnt offerings.\"</p>\n\n<p>Micah 6:6-8 (6) \"With what shall I come before the L-rd, bow myself before G-d on\nhigh? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with yearling calves? (7) Will\nthe L-rd be pleased with thousand of rams, or with ten thousands streams of oil?\nShall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my\nsoul? (8) Man has told you what is good; but what does the L-rd demand of you?\nTo do justice, and to love loving-kindness, and to walk humbly with your G-d.\"</p>\n\n<p>Isaiah 1:11 and 17 - 18: (11) \"Of what use to Me are your many sacrifices?\" says the Lord; \"I am sated from the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed cattle; and in the blood of bulls, and of sheep, and of male goats I do not delight.\" ......... (17) \" Learn to do good, seek justice, help the oppressed; do justice to the orphan, plead [the case] for the widow. (18) Come now, and let us reason together,\" said the L-rd; \"If your sins be as scarlet, they shall become as white as snow; if they be red as crimson, they shall become as wool.\" </p>\n\n<p>5) <strong>Destroying and removing idols</strong> :</p>\n\n<p>Isaiah 27:9 \"Therefore, through this shall Jacob's iniquity be atoned for, and this shall be the fruit of his sin's removal: When he makes all the altar stones like ground chalk stones, and Asherah trees, and sun idols arise no more.\"</p>\n\n<p>6) <strong>\"Exile and punishment\"</strong> :</p>\n\n<p>Isaiah 40:1-2 (1)\"Comfort, comfort my people, says your G-d. (2) Speak consolingly of Jerusalem and proclaim to her that her period (of exile) has been completed, that her iniquity has been forgiven; for she has received double for all her sins from the hand of G-d.\"</p>\n\n<p>7) <strong>Repenting and changing your deeds</strong> :</p>\n\n<p>Jonah 3:10 \"And G-d saw their deeds, that they repented from their evil way; and G-d\nrelented of the evil, which He had spoken to do to them, and He did not do it.\"</p>\n\n<p>No blood sacrifice appears in the Book of Jonah; just repentance, fasting, prayer, and better deeds.</p>\n\n<p>Ezekiel 18:21-23 (21)\"As for the wicked man, if he repents from all his sins that he committed.......(22) All his transgressions that he committed will not be remembered against him;...\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>The OP asks:\"...provide some verses which indicate that prayer and seeking forgiveness is also a viable means and that G-d will accept it.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Answer:</p>\n\n<p>1) </p>\n\n<p>Numbers 14:20 \"And G-d said: \"I have forgiven because of your words.\"</p>\n\n<p>2) </p>\n\n<p>1 Kings 8:46-52 (46) \"If they sin against You, for there is no man who does not sin,\nand You will be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, and their captors\nwill carry them away captive to the land of the enemy, far or near; (47) And if they\ntake it to heart in the land where they were held captive, and repent, and make\nsupplication to You in the land of their captors, saying, \"We have sinned, and have\ndone perversely, we have committed wickedness\"; (48) And they return to You\nwith all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies who led them\naway captive, and pray to You toward their land, which You gave to their fathers,\n[toward] the city which you have chosen, and [toward] the house which I have built\nfor Your Name; (49) Then You shall hear their prayer and their supplication in\nheaven, Your dwelling place, and maintain their cause, (50) And forgive Your\npeople what they have sinned against You, and all their transgressions that they\nhave transgressed against You, and have mercy upon them before their captors,\nso that they may have mercy on them; (51) For they are Your people, and Your\ninheritance, whom You have brought out of Egypt, from inside the smelting\nfurnace of iron; (52) That Your eyes may be open to the supplication of Your\nservant, and to the supplication of Your people Israel, to hear them whenever they\ncall to You.\"</p>\n\n<p>See similar at 2 Chronicles 6:36-40.</p>\n\n<p>2 Chronicles 7:13-14 (13) \"If I shut up the heaven and there be no rain, and if I\ncommand locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence upon My people. (14)\nAnd My people, upon whom My name is called, humble themselves and pray and\nseek My presence and repent of their evil ways, I shall hear from heaven and\nforgive their sin and heal their land.\"</p>\n\n<p>3) </p>\n\n<p>Hosea 14:2-3 (2) \"Return, O Israel, to the L-rd your G-d; for you have stumbled in\nyour iniquity. (3) Take words with you and return to the L-rd; say to Him: \"You\nshall forgive all iniquity, and accept the good, and we will render [for] bullocks [the\noffering of our] lips.\" </p>\n\n<p>The Torah contains much more.

For Rambam to say such a thing would be to deny the truth of the Torah since the statement that HaShem is one is explicitly stated in Devarim 6:4. By Rambam's own definition as found in Hilchot Teshuvah 3:8, this would be apikorsus.</p>\n\n<p>The use of \"Yachid\" is usually applied when we try to refer to G-d prior to creation. It is to emphasize that this is how things truly are even now. This is what is expressed in Malachi 3:6, \"I am HaShem, I do not change.\" Creation makes no change by HaShem. It is the same before creation as it is after creation. The perception of change and variation is only from the perspective of the creations.</p>\n\n<p>\"Echod\" is used to describe HaShem's unity like in Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 1:7 which says, \"HaShem is one. He is not two or more, but one, unified in a manner which [surpasses] any unity that is found in the world; i.e., He is not one in the manner of a general category which includes many individual entities, nor one in the way that the body is divided into different portions and dimensions.

The Rabbi concedes that the question posed 'would weaken my belief', but argues that the source of information dating the world back so long is unreliable, so therefore the question is moot. Notice he did not say 'don't worry, God made an old world' or 'don't worry the mikubalim told us the world is really billions of years old', but he actually admit it would be a good, faith weakening question.</p>\n\n<p>So, now that modern science and archaeology has given credence to the claim of an ancient world predating the assumed time of Adam, what  answer can we offer to the question of the Khazar, if the Rabbi himself admit that the strength of the question relies on the evidence?</p>\n\n<ol start=\"60\">\n<li><p>Al Khazari: Does it not weaken thy belief if thou art told that the Indians have antiquities and buildings which they consider to be millions of years old?</p></li>\n<li><p>The Rabbi: It would, indeed, weaken my belief had they a fixed form of religion, or a book concerning which a multitude of people held the same opinion, and in which no historical discrepancy could be found. Such a book, however, does not exist. Apart from this, they are a dissolute, unreliable people, and arouse the indignation of the followers of religions through their talk, whilst they anger them with their idols, talismans, and witchcraft. To such things they pin their faith, and deride those who boast of the possession of a divine book. Yet they only possess a few books, and these were written to mislead the weak-minded. To this class belong astrological writings, in which they speak of ten thousands of years, as the book on the Nabataean Agriculture, in which are mentioned the names of Janbushar, Sagrit and Roanai. It is believed that they lived before Adam, who was the disciple of Janbushar, and such like.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Going back a step... The key to understanding the first section of the Kuzari is to forget all the more contemporary talk about \"the Kuzari Principle\" and realize that Rabbi Yehudah haLevi's (Rihal's) thesis is to deprecate the value of the entire concept of philosophical proof.</p>\n\n<p>This is why the book starts with the king having a prophetic dream, \"Your beliefs are pleasing to G-d, but your actions are not.\" The mission of the first section isn't to prove G-d exists; the Rihal sets it up so that that's a given. Which is why the philosopher has nothing to tell him. Quoting the king (1:2), \"Your words are convincing, but they do not address what I'm looking for. I know already that my soul is pure and that my actions are calculated to gain Hashem's favor.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Rabbi provides as a counterpoint to his statement (Kuzari I, par 13), “The Rabbi: That which you describe is religion based on speculation and system, the research of thought, but open to many doubts. Now ask the philosophers, and you will find that they do not agree on one action or one principle, since some doctrines can be established by arguments, which are only partially satisfactory, and still much less capable of being proved.”</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the Rabbi’s basis for belief is not one based on “speculation and system”. It’s not philosophical proof. Reducing his words to an argument of the style described above defeats the whole point Rav Yehudah haLevi is trying to make! As he later writes (par 63), “There is an excuse for the Philosophers. Being Greeks, science and religion did not come to them as inheritances.”</p>\n\n<p>The Kuzari can be seen as a response to Rav Saadia Gaon’s “Emunos veDei’os”, the approach that would later be taken by the Rambam's “The Guide for the Perplexed”, “The Ikkarim” and other such philosophical texts. Rav Yehudah haLevi rejected the entire tendency of placing Jewish belief on Greek Philosophical underpinnings.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, he says that Judaism is unquestionable for the Jew because it is our heritage.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Today, where it's common to question that heritage, where many of us have yet to rediscover that inheritance after generations of neglect, that may not be as convincing. Instead, the counterpoint to relying on “speculation and system” which can \"prove\" contradictory answers is typically our own first-hand experience as observant Jews.</p>\n\n<p>So this whole question is of abstract interest. Few if any of us actually invoke tradition to justify our belief in Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>But if we're following the Rihal's path, we would be rejecting the idea that proofs are more sound than the forms of justifying our belief we actually use. Including dismissing any scientific conclusions drawn from findings as being \"based on speculation and system ... doctrines [that] can be established by arguments which are only partially satisfactory, and still much less capable of being proven.\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Third, while Rihal was a literalist when it comes to Bereishis 1-2, he is in the distinct minority among rishonim. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/64386/1570\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/64386/1570</a> for more detail.)</p>\n\n<p>Literalism became popular among Orthodoxy during our counter-reformation period, when battling the births of German Reform, Neolog, Reform and Conservative Judaism, but historically it was not. The Torah, when we look at the sum both written and oral, does not demand that the universe is less than 6,000 years old.</p>\n\n<p>For that matter, when we go back even earlier to the sages of the mishnah and talmud, it is clear they assumed creation is an incomprehensible. Meaning that both our attempts to understand the history behind the verses and our attempts to study it scientifically will fall far short of the truth. Just one example, \"מעשה בראשית נקרא ומתרגם, פשיטא, מהו דתימא אתו לשיולי מה למעלה מה למטה מה לפנים ומה לאחור, קא משמע לן. -- The Act of Creation is read [in the congregational Qeri'as haTorah] and translated [which was part of the Torah reading in those days]. [Isn't this] obvious? One might have thought that it would get people to ask what is above, what is below, what is within and what is after/behind. Therefore is comes to tell us [that we do read and translate it].\" The rabbis so wanted to discourage speculation into things we cannot understand, or are likely to misunderstand in ways that lead to heresy, that it wasn't obvious we would even read Bereishis in public!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Logically, he answered that the question itself does not apply (under the circumstances in which it was asked).

Note that he <strong>did not</strong> say that it was not a good question or that it did not have a valid answer. He said that had the \"evidence\" appeared valid then and only then would it have needed to be considered. He said that had it been a valid question his belief would have been <em>weakened</em> which meant that he would have had to answer it in order to bring it back to the level that it had been. However, since it was an invalid question and had no effect, then he could validly ignore it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Khazari's question was about humans claiming to have \"antiquities and buildings\" that were millions of years old.</p>\n\n<p>In other words: Would the fact that some people could prove that advanced civilizations  existed millions of years before the Torah's Adam, weaken your faith?</p>\n\n<p>(NOTE: \"advanced\" is being defined as capable of city building and producing related artifacts of similar and noteworthy complexity.)</p>\n\n<p>The Rabbi admits it would weaken his belief, but since there are no reliable sources of proof for this, it doesn't matter.</p>\n\n<p>The Rabbi even adds that records of merely many tens of thousands of years before Adam would weaken his faith. (not just millions). The Rabbi offers agriculture as an example similar to the Khazari's \"buildings\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>The OP asks that now that science has such proof, what would the \"Rabbi\" say?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Simple Answer:</p>\n\n<p>Science admits that it has no such proof.</p>\n\n<p>Detailed Answer:</p>\n\n<p>\"The Neolithic Revolution or Neolithic Demographic Transition, sometimes called the Agricultural Revolution, was the wide-scale transition of many human cultures from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement, allowing the ability to support an increasingly large population. Archaeological data indicates that the domestication of various types of plants and animals evolved in separate locations worldwide, starting in the geological epoch of the Holocene <strong>around 12,500 years ago</strong>. It was the world's first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture.\"</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wikipedia, entry: Neolithic Revolution</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Therefore, any case of a people building complex artifacts, using agriculture or making buildings never took place many tens of thousands of years ago (let alone millions).</p>\n\n<p>The fact that science does claim that plants, creatures, and inanimate objects, as well as the planets, stars and the universe etc. existed many tens of thousands to millions and billions of years ago, has nothing to do with the question of the OP. The Khazari and the Rabbi are not discussing that. It is a different topic. (The six days of creation contain descriptions, (like evening and morning happening without a sun) which begs the question if it is to be taken literally. For instance, we do not know the \"Rabbi's\" position on the creation days being 24 modern hours, or rather, epochs of order. However, the post-Adam chronicles of Genesis read like literal history.) </p>\n\n<p>The \"Rabbi\" could easily point out that science today about the neolithic revolution \"starting\" \"about\" 12,500 years ago, (and some scientists in that Wiki- article are quoted as saying that the fertile crescent's neolithic revolution started about 9,000 years ago)  is close enough to the Torah's claims for the Adams family.</p>\n\n<p>Medrashim, and Rishonim, have some opinions that show human type creatures existed pre-Adam. </p>\n\n<p>1) Talmud, Eiruvin 18b</p>\n\n<p>2) See Moreh Nevuchim (Rambam's Guide for the Perplexed; Part 1, ch.7)</p>\n\n<p>3) Compare Targum Onkelos: Gen 1:20,21,24 vs. Gen. 2:7</p>\n\n<p>4) Ramban to Gen. 2:7</p>\n\n<p>Eiruvin 18b says, (based on nuance in the text of Genesis 4:25,) that during the 130 years of Adam's separation from Eve, he sired other children. The identity of the mother(s) is not mentioned; but it was not Eve.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam explains that the sons born to Adam mentioned in the above Medrash, were not really human in the true sense of the word, but were like animals in human form. They did have extra intelligence and were able to be cunning and harmful. </p>\n\n<p>Due to the fact that the Rambam takes this Medrash as referring to literal physical offspring (albeit quasi-human) we must assume that perforce, the mother(s) were female humanoids able to become pregnant from Adam and capable of giving birth. Where did these females, (who could not produce true human children as Eve could) come from? They must have been humanoids created apart from Adam; essentially pre-dating him.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban to Gen. 2:7, explains that Onkelos held that the Adam species must have first been a living humanoid with its highest level of soul being animal-like in nature. He derives this because Onkelos describes the breathing of a soul into Adam as \"Adam became a speaking spirit\". This would imply that Adam was alive beforehand, and that G-d only breathed into him the extra soul of human intellect and spirituality. The Ramban concludes that the extra letter \"lamed\" in the verse, can imply that G-d took a man and changed him so that he became a different man altogether.</p>\n\n<p>According to the above, there is no problem to say that the initial creation of the species \"Adam\" in Genesis 1, were male and female animal-creatures with better intelligence than animals, yet lacking the full spiritual soul of Adam HaRishon in Genesis 2; who was the recipient of the special creation of the human soul.</p>\n\n<p>(IMHO, this also explains a verse which has bothered me since I was a child. Genesis 4:17 states that Cain built a city. For who?)</p>\n\n<p>Also, science itself is only giving a general starting date for the revolution's beginning. It does not know for certain how long it took to get underway, who did it, what caused it, and if its dating is exact to the thousands place in years.</p>\n\n<p>Science does tell us that tens of thousands to millions of years ago, the human or human-like peoples (creatures) were only capable of the most simple technologies like sharpening stone and starting fire (and living in caves, not buildings) etc. This period is called Paleo-lithic (Old Stone Age) Neo-lithic (New Stone Age) marks the amazing technological revolution of mankind.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, we understand the \"Rabbi's\" position as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The Torah makes significant mention of things in Adam's family history, like farming, animal husbandry, tent living, metal working, city building, and music. It appears that the Torah implies that such developments were just getting started or advancing with the advent of Adam and his offspring. Therefore, a solid proof that such technology was  fully advanced and in use by people tens of thousands of years ago, would weaken his faith.</p>\n\n<p>However, in actuality, science now proves that the \"Rabbi's\" position in front of the Khazari was absolutely correct. :)</p>\n\n\n",

But what is the definition of \"l'haniach\"?

Is the mitzvah in the wearing of them or in the wrapping, neither of which is either \"placing\" or \"tying.\"</p>\n<p>Could I buy \"pre-wrapped\" tefillin and fit my arm in like a sleeve so the various parts end up in the right spot? Or is there something about the process which is required?</p>\n<p>[if you look up the phrase \"pre-wrapped tefillin\" you will come up with something my dad thought up a bunch of years ago as a gag. Now I wonder if it could be halachically feasible]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Five and a half years later, a new subtlety --\nWhat about someone who is a righty with only a useful left arm? I saw someone have the arm/hand tefillin wrapped on him by someone else. If the verb is \"to place\" then who makes that bracha? The one who is actively wrapping? Or the one on whom it is wrapped?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.25.5?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA Orach Chayim 25:5</a>. The Sefardi custom is to say only the 1st bracha, and one suffices for both. Ashkenazim say one for the hand and another for the head.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that there is a debate as to whether the wearing of tefillin is one mitzvah or two separate ones.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your question about להניח, it does mean, literally, \"to place\" or \"to set\". And it is very clear from the phrasing in the Torah that there is an <strong>active</strong> command regarding the hand tefillin explaining <strong>how</strong> to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Deuteronomy 6:8:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וּקְשַׁרְתָּ֥ם</strong> לְא֖וֹת עַל־יָדֶ֑ךָ וְהָי֥וּ לְטֹטָפֹ֖ת בֵּ֥ין\n  עֵינֶֽיךָ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And you shall <strong>bind</strong> them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall\n  be for frontlets between your eyes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, for the hand tefillin, one must specifically bind them, manually. Your \"pre-bound\" tefillin idea, sounds like a great toy for Purim, but, I don't think it will fulfill the mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>The phrasing for the head tefillin is \"passive\"\". It says only \"it shall be\". And, that's what you are doing. The strap loop is pre-sized, and there is no action of \"binding\" like with the hand one.</p>\n\n\n",

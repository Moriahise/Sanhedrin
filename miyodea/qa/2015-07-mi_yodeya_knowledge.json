    "title": "Controversy Concerning Community Consumption of Chametz Coming from Costco",
    "content": "# Controversy Concerning Community Consumption of Chametz Coming from Costco\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a Rabbinic prohibition on benefiting from  <em>chametz</em> that was owned by a Jew over Passover. In recent years, an issue was raised in the New York area that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/companies/cs-wholesale-grocers/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a major distributor of grocery items in the northeastern United States</a> was suspected of being <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%26S_Wholesale_Grocers#History\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">owned by Jews</a> and not selling its <em>chametz</em> before Passover. This would mean that one could not buy <em>chametz</em> even from Gentile-owned stores that likely purchased their own stock of <em>chametz</em> from (<em>erev</em>) <em>Pesach</em> onward from these Jewish distributors. </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, I'm aware of at least one Orthodox community that publishes lists of chain-stores that one can acquire <em>chametz</em> from immediately after <em>Pesach</em> (e.g. Costco). Is this because they are not concerned about the Jewish-distributor issue or could they have ascertained that these chains don't acquire chametz from this suspectedly Jewish distributor. Keeping in mind that <em>chametz she'avar alav hapesach</em> is only forbidden at a Rabbinic level and we do have a general (albeit seemingly limited in its actual customary application?) rule that rabbinic uncertainties are resolved toward leniency, could this be the deciding factor? </p>\n\n<p>I'm curious to know if people have reliable sources or hearsay regarding different observant community's practice regarding this issue. Is it an issue split along modern orthodox (e.g. the aforementioned community I mentioned is affiliated with Yeshiva University's medical school) vs. Charedi communities (e.g. I originally heard of the issue at a \"black-hat\" synagogue in Monsey)? Are there available rulings/halachik discussions e.g. online? Could the lenient view be one limited to a <em>shaat hadechak</em> (hardship) type of exemption? Below are excerpts of emails from 2 synagogues about the same merchants.</p>\n\n<p>From the Einstein Shul in the Bronx:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Below are details about the chametz sold in stores in our area. Please\n  be aware that this list is not exhaustive and feel free to call or\n  email regarding any questions. </p>\n  \n  <p>The stores below are either owned by non-Jews or sold their chametz\n  during Pesach.</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>One can purchase all chametz from stores under the Va'ad of Riverdale </p></li>\n  <li><p>All food in Big Deal Supermarket is fine.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Purchasing food from Fairway is fine as well.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Supermarket Chains/Drug Stores/etc.:</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>A&P Costco CVS Dunkin Donuts  The Food Emporium Garden Gourmet\n  Pathmark Shoprite- in New Rochelle Stop and Shop  Superfresh   Trader\n  Joe’s Walgreen’s  Waldbaum's Stores</p>\n  \n  <ol start=\"5\">\n  <li><p>Key Food- It is absolutely permitted to purchase any product from Key Food.

This appears\n  to certainly occur by Shavuot and possibly earlier. </p></li>\n  <li><p>Fresh Direct- It is absolutely permitted to purchase any product from Fresh Direct. However, there is some question regarding this\n  store since, despite selling its chametz it remains open throughout\n  Pesach.

This appears to certainly occur by Shavuot and possibly earlier.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From a shul in Monsey:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The following stores are acceptable for purchasing chometz: BJ’s, CVS,\n  Duane Read, Rite Aid, Sam’s Club, 7-Eleven, Trader Joe’s, Walgreen’s,\n  Walmart and Wegman’s.</p>\n  \n  <p>Shoprite is judged on an individual store basis. The Shoprite in\n  Tallman is assumed to be a problem.  Pathmark, Target, Stop and Shop,\n  Costco, and Fairway are assumed to be a problem.  At these stores, one\n  should not purchase overt chometz, which includes wheat and oat based\n  cereal, cookies, crackers, pretzels, grains, and flour. Products which\n  contain vinegar such as mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard may be\n  purchased since most domestic vinegar is not chometz, and the alcohol\n  is corn based. We recommend waiting until Lag Bo’omer, to purchase\n  Chometz.</p>\n  \n  <p>This list will be updated as new information becomes known.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe Rav Yisroel Belsky's view was that we should not rely on safek derabbanan to permit buying chametz from stores with Jewish distributors at all times, since if we do so, it is inevitable that we will be permitting chametz she'avar alav ha-pesach at some point. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yaakov Luban of the OU <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/passover/articles/chametz-sheavar-alav-hapesach-the-supermarket-controversy-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">records</a> that he remembers that as a child the custom was often to wait until Shavuos before buying chametz from Jewish-owned stores, but now the assumption is that \"inventory in a major supermarket is sold much more quickly; shelves are generally restocked on a daily basis. Nevertheless, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>supermarket chains maintain large inventories of products in\n  warehouses for distribution in individual stores, and it is necessary\n  to calculate the turn-around time from the warehouse delivery until\n  the purchase by the customer in the actual store.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Moshe writes (Iggerot Moshe, OC 4:96) that it is permissible to\n  purchase chametz from a supermarket at the point in time when there is\n  a 50 percent possibility that the supermarket purchased the chametz\n  after Pesach. Since chametz sheavar alav haPesach is a rabbinic (and\n  not a Biblical) injunction, one can rely on a principle known as\n  “safek derabbanan lekula” (one can be lenient when it is uncertain if\n  a rabbinic restriction applies), and therefore shop freely in the\n  store.</p>\n  \n  <p>The question is, When can one legitimately say there is a 50 percent\n  chance that the chametz on the supermarket shelf was purchased by the\n  store after the conclusion of Pesach? How long does it take to\n  establish a reasonable doubt? It is difficult to give a precise\n  cut-off date. Communal rabbis generally tell their congregants when\n  they feel comfortable purchasing chametz, and my impression is that\n  Lag B’Omer (which is twenty-five days after the conclusion of Pesach)\n  is a safe time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The language of Rav Moshe in this teshuvah is: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שסמוך לימי הפסח הרי אפשר יש להם יותר מאלו שקנו בפסח ואפילו פחות אם\n  ודאי שקנו חמץ בתוך הפסח ואפילו קרוב לודאי הוא כודאי כדלעיל יש לאסור\n  דקשה לשער בזה, אבל באופן דלפי חשבון הימים וכדומה הוא ספק רק שמא יש גם\n  מהאיסור רק כשיעור ההיתר ולא יותר אין לאסור מטעם שאחר הפסח הוא רק ספק\n  דרבנן שהוא לקולא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Asher Weiss (<a href=\"http://tvunah.org/%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%A5-%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%A8-%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%95-%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%97/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אות ג</a>) discusses whether the rule of safek derabbanan applies to this case, and after concluding that it does, writes that there is no obligation to clarify the safek where this cannot be done easily: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנה שאלות רבות מתעוררות בכל שנה ושנה לגבי ספיקות שונות אם חמץ נמכר\n  לגוי או לא ויש לעיין בדין ספק חמץ שעעה\"פ.</p>\n  \n  <p>ולכאורה הוי ככל ספיקא דרבנן לקולא. ואכן כך דעת רוב הפוסקים וכמבואר\n  בשוע\"ה (סימן תמ\"ט סעיף ל' ובסימן תל\"ו סי\"ט), וכ\"כ במשנ\"ב (סימן תמ\"ט\n  סק\"ה), עי\"ש.</p>\n  \n  <p>אמנם בשוע\"ה כתב שם (סימן תמ\"ט) די\"א דיש להחמיר בספק חמץ שעעה\"פ ויש\n  לחוש לדבריו אם לא בהפסד מרובה, עי\"ש. וכבר כתבו האחרונים להוכיח דיש\n  להחמיר בספק מדברי הרמ\"א (סימן תל\"ו ס\"א) דאם יש ספק חיטה בתחתית הערימה\n  וספק אם נתחמצו מותר למכור הכל ביחד, עי\"ש.</p>\n  \n  <p>אך בסימן תל\"ו שם סתם להקל בספק זה וכך נראה עיקר דעתו להלכה בסימן תמ\"ט.\n  וגם לא מצינו טעם מספיק למה יש להחמיר בספק זה, ומאי שנא מכל ספיקא דרבנן\n  לקולא. ואף באפשר לברר כבר ביארתי במקום אחר דספיקא דרבנן לקולא אף באיכא\n  לברורי אא\"כ יש לברר בנקל כגון לברר אצל מי שנמצא אצלינו אבל כל שיש טורח\n  לברר יש להקל בספיקא דרבנן, ועיין בכף החיים (סימן ק\"ס ס\"ק נ\"ג), ואכמ\"ל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It should also be noted that according to those poskim (including, e.g., Rav Hershel Schachter) who maintain that a corporation does not have the status of a person, there should not be a prohibition of chametz that was owned by a (Jewish) corporation. It is not clear to me whether any poskim actually take this view. </p>\n\n<p>There is also a (minority) opinion among the poskim that the prohibition of chametz she'avar alav ha-pesach does not apply to the chametz of a mumar, since he will not be deterred by the rabbinic prohibition any more than by the biblical one that he disregards. </p>\n\n\n",

To teach us that just as sacrifices atone (alternate reading: just as the Red Heifer atones) so too does the demise of the righteous atone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi is quoting the Gemara in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00886.html#HtmpReportNum0052_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mo'ed Katan 28a</a> - which has the <em>alternate reading</em>'s text.</p>\n<p>Tosafos there explains -  <strong>מה פרה אדומה מכפרת</strong> פירוש על מעשה העגל וכדאמרינן במדרש משל לבן השפחה שטינף פלטירין של מלך - that the Red Heifer  atones for the sin of the Golden Calf, as per the Medrash that the maidservant (Heifer) is expected to clean up her child's (Calf's) mess in the palace.</p>\n<p>The  שפתי חכמים  elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ל)</strong> פירוש דאין כאן מקומו שהרי בשנה ראשונה ליציאת מצרים עשו העגל ובשנה שנייה שרפו פרה אדומה ומיתת מרים היתה בסוף מ' שנה ליציאת מצרים:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is: The first RedHeifer was done soon after the Mishkan was erected - it should be in the Chumash around Tazria-Metzora. Miriam's demise happened 38 years later; the Red Heifer is put here - some 38 years after it happened - to teach us something.</p>\n<p>He continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>מ)</strong> ואם תאמר וכי קרבן היתה הפרה אדומה והלא לא היו מקריבין ממנה כלום. ויש לומר לפי\nדבר אחר שפירש\"י לעיל שקראה הכתוב חטאת לומר שהיא כקדשים ליאסר בהנאה שמע מינה שהיא כקרבן: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is: Even though the Red Heifer was not a real sacrifice, (it was done outside the Temple and no part of it was brought on the altar), Rashi already explained that it has some of the laws of a sacrifice, as it's called a חַטָּאת (ibid 19:9) ולפי הלכותיו קראה הכתוב חטאת, לומר שהיא כקדשים להאסר  בהנאה - in that one is forbidden to derive personal benefit from it, [besides for its stated purpose. (As per  שפתי חכמים there- ויש מפרשים כקדשים שבאין לכפרה כך האפר בא לטהר מי שצריך ואין שום הנאה אחרת ממנה).]</p>\n<p>He concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>נ)</strong> ואם תאמר לפי זה היה לו לסמוך גבי קרבנות ממש. ויש לומר לכך נסמכה לפרה לפי שהם דומים להדדי לפי שמיתת צדיקים אינן קרבנות וגם הפרה אינה קרבן ממש ולמדנו מהדדי כמו שזה מכפר גם זה מכפר:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is: Miriam's demise was juxtaposed to the Red Heifer, and not to a regular sacrifice, to highlight that neither are real sacrifices, yet they both atone.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>\n<p>What precisely does the demise of righteous people atone for, and who <em>gets the atonement</em>?</p>\n<p>I'm asking, as the concept <em>the death of the righteous atones</em> is often quoted at funerals, implying that it's a Korban Tzibur - a general atonement for the  public.</p>\n<p>Sources and novel ideas are welcome.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Baal Haturim points out that <em>Shom</em>, there, is mentioned twice. Miriam died there and was buried there. The gematria of <em>Shom</em> is 300+40 = 340, the gematria of atones <em>mechaper</em> is 40+20+80+200 = 340.\nThis is the hint that there is a connection between 'atonement' reflected in the Red Heifer and 'there' repeated superfluously in connection with Miriam's death, the death of a righteous person. So we can expound that the red Heifer atones and similarly the death of the righteous.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Samson Raphael Hirsch</a>'s commentary on these sections of the Torah,<sup>1</sup> the Red Heifer and the death of the righteous both accomplish the same spiritually educational mission: curing people of the illusion that they are solely physical beings without free will.</p>\n\n<p>R' Hirsch explains his understanding of the meaning of every aspect of the Red Heifer procedure in an extended comment following Numbers 19:22. This comment is an interpretive masterpiece that will reward the reader who studies it in full with a wealth of insight. I'll do my best to summarize some of the main pertinent points here.</p>\n\n<h3>The Problem of Contact with Death</h3>\n\n<p>The point of the Red Heifer process is to cure people of the טומאה‎<sup>2</sup> that comes from contact with death. According to R' Hirsch, this טומאה is a sort of moral depression that comes from contemplating a dead human body and drawing the mistaken conclusion that the whole human being ends with death. The person in the thrall of this materialistic idea has trouble believing in human free will - if humans are just matter, then human behavior is compelled by the laws of physics just like the behavior of all matter is. This person is then unfit to participate in the service of God, which requires <em>free-willed</em> devotion of oneself.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... then altogether nowhere is there place for the moral \"thou shalt\" next to the physical \"thou must\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>The Red Heifer Solution</h3>\n\n<p>The Red Heifer process teaches that the essence of humanity is that the physical body, which is indeed bound by the laws of physics, is joined with an immortal soul, which has the Godly ability to freely choose between good and evil and the charge from God to choose good. The heifer itself represents the uncontrolled physicality, in that it is fully grown, red like blood, and has never in its life been bent to a higher purpose. When the heifer is burnt to ashes, we see the physical body returning to the dust whence it came. But before it's burnt, the heifer is slaughtered by a <em>kohen</em> opposite the Temple, and the life-blood that comes out is sprinkled toward the Temple, representing the one aspect of a person that <em>does not</em> return to dust, the immortal soul. Later, the ashes, representing pure physicality, are combined with \"living water,\" another representation of the free-willed soul. When people are sprinkled with this mixture, they are reminded of the true, dual nature of humanity and enjoy restored confidence in their freedom to choose service over sin.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... although thou art \"earthly ashes\" nevertheless thou art מים חיים, life drawn from the source of immortality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>The Death of the Righteous</h3>\n\n<p>At the end of his comment on Numbers 20:1, R' Hirsch cites the same explanation in <em>Mo'ed Katan</em> that Rashi does for the juxtaposition of the laws of the Red Heifer with the stories of the deaths of Miriam and Aharon, and uses what he has taught us about the former to show a lesson for us in the latter.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... just as the [Red Heifer] institution teaches immortality and the moral freedom of will of the godlike nature of Man, so does the death of the righteous directly teach both.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyone who sees the physical remains of a righteous person can see, intuitively, that they do not comprise the totality of the individual who, until now, was constantly making free-willed choices to do good. It is clear that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Just as their work here below lives on in immortality in all the succeeding generations of the nation, so their own real selves did not die, but went back out of earthly transience into eternity to God, the source of all life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Like one who has been sprinkled with the lesson in free-willed humanity that is the Red Heifer water, one who sees the death of the righteous returns from the spiritual depression that regular human death brings, newly empowered to choose dedication to the service of God.<sup>3</sup></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup> 1.

As summaries in Lessons In Tanya:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To revert to the question concerning the juxtaposition of the two passages, the Alter Rebbe explains that an offering connoted an “arousal from below,” from the soul of the animal that derives from kelipat nogah. This, in turn, elicited a reciprocal “arousal from Above,” drawing down a finite order of Divine light that can permeate the finite world and be integrated and ingested within it. (This characteristic explains why offerings are referred to as the “food of the altar.”) Being finite, this contracted order of Divine light was only able to effect atonement of unwitting sins, those that derive from undue domination by the animal soul which derives from kelipat nogah.</p>\n<p>The Red Heifer, by contrast, produces the “sanctifying purification waters” (Kiddush mei chatat); i.e., it draws down an illumination from the most supremely sanctified levels of Divinity (Kodesh HaElyon) that utterly transcend this world. This intense illumination can transform the darkness of Tohu into the light of Tikkun, and secure purification for even the harshest degree of impurity (Avi Avot HaTumah), which is far lower than kelipat nogah.</p>\n<p>In the same way, the passing of a tzaddik draws down a Divine illumination that transcends the world, deriving as it does from that element within the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy which is called the Tikkun of Notzer. The name of this Tikkun, which comprises the same letters as Ratzon, brings about an et ratzon, “an auspicious time,” and secures atonement for the sins of the generation, even those that are committed willfully and that derive from the three completely impure kelipot.</p>\n<p>In this regard, the passing of a tzaddik is thus more akin to the Red Heifer than to a sin-offering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Ever.\n There are specific instances where it applies and where it does not. See Shulchan Aruch o'ch 560 siff 3 and mishna berurah 13. Seemingly working in an office would be more comparable to a sheppard singing, or a woman doing her housework, which would not be allowed, only situations like the dockworkers and cattle workers was allowed in the gemara, as their singing actually helped them work and it was not just for pleasure.</p>\n\n<p>To apply any of these laws to Sefira, and the three weeks for that matter, is a chidush, but it seems the minhag of most people is to only keep those laws about music during these two periods. There may be proof for this 'minhag' found in hilchos sefira siman 493 m.b. #3, where he mentions that during Sefira 'certainly one should not engage in dancing for pleasure'. This statement is hard to understand unless we assume as we did that the music laws were misappropriated from being a general constant law, and taken to apply only during certain times.

    "content": "# Convert in Ketubah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a ketubah, there are 3 different categories for the woman's status. Virgin, Convert, and woman. Usually one of those statuses is represented on the ketubah, with the appropriate amount in zuzim. And while it may not be conventionally done, is writing more than one status actually forbidden? Can the kallah be listed as a convert and a virgin if both those things were true? If it's not possible to mention both these things in the same statement, can one be mentioned in one statement and the other in a different statement of the ketubah.</p>\n\n<p>Update\nThe comments and answers have not been satisfying. They seem to be under the assumption that i am asking how to change something that is fixed in stone already and should not be messed with. i do not think this applies because ketubot have historically been some of the broadest and most updated documents within the Sephardic world (of which i am). There were even new categories other than divorce, virgin, and convert. Another class that was codified by the Rambam was the ransomed captive (Mishneh Torah \"laws of Yibbum wa-Halisa 4:34). And there are documents that are preserved in our tradition that list multiple statuses for the bride.</p>\n\n<p>\"and willingly this Berukha, the bride, the virgin, the divrocee, took upon herself and became to this Yeshu'a the groom, a wife and the mother of children...\"\nSee line 7 in the Aramaic and the English. This document is not a document of accident or ignorance, as it was written and signed by Elijah Gaon, the head of the Yeshiva of Ramle.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AMMLm.jpg\" alt=\"Aramaic\"> </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sMPg6.jpg\" alt=\"English Translation\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TRbfR.jpg\" alt=\"Copy of original\"></p>\n\n<p>So my question isn't \"can this be done?\" Because it already has been done. My question is \"has listing more than one status become <em>specifically</em> forbidden?\" Saying that a kallah should be one or the other in terms of her zuz price and to let it be known that she cannot marry a Cohen is fine, but i still haven't heard that it's illegal to mention more details elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>In general, only one status is needed to be listed.\nFor a Jewish born virgin, besulah is written because she is due 200 zuz upon divorce/death of husband.\nFor a Jewish born \"widow\" (I'm not sure why you wrote \"woman\"), almanah is written because she is due 100 zuz upon termination of the marriage.\nFor a Jewish born divorcee, gerushah is written because even though she recieves 100 zuz like an almanah, we are careful to note that she is a gerushah so that she will not marry a Kohen. \nFor a convert, the term giyores is written in her kesubah (even though she recieves the same 100 zuz as an almanah and is forbidden to a kohen like a gerushah) so that one will realize that if she marries a male convert, her daughter will be forbidden to a Kohen.\nA woman cannot be a besulah and any of the other categories so that question is moot. A woman who is both an almanah and a gerushah writes in her kesubah gersuhah so that people will know she cannot marry a kohen. A woman who is both an almanah and giyores writes that she is a giyores so that people will know she is forbidden from marrying a kohen. A woman who is both a gerushah and a giyores is subject to dispute: Pischei Teshuva (Even HaEzer 66:8) quotes from Radvaz that she writes Giyores, while the recenly departed Rabbi Shmuel Wosner rules that she she writes both giyores and gerushah. I have a whole explanation of why Rabbi Wosner would rule so but it is my own understanding and is quite complicated.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Our sages understood that if a girl under the age of three years and one day is violated ch'v'sh, her hymen will grow back. If she is violated after that time it will not (Niddah 44b).</p>\n<p>A giyores who converted under the age of three also receives 200 zuzim upon the death or divorce from her husband, like a born Jewish besulah.</p>\n<p>If she is converted after the age of three years and one day she only receives 100 zuzim.</p>\n<p>After this age, any violations or consensual intercourse would void her signs of virginity.</p>\n<p>Rivka remained modest and unique in her innocence, even though she lived amongst a pagan culture and similarly this is often the case with geirim, whose sincerity and pursuit of morality is often part of what led them to Judaism.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, due to the fact that the same standards aren't commonplace in the world, it would be unreasonable to suspect a giyores of infidelity in the same way if her signs of virginity are not present upon marriage. There could have been various reasons why. There is no distinction made between a giyores who is a Besulah or not, unless she was very young.</p>\n<p>By creating an across the board standard that a giyores who converted over the age of three years and one day is referred to as a giyores and gets 100 zuzim, even though it is a lesser amount than a besulah, this essentially protects against claims that could make her forbidden to her husband if he has a doubt about her signs of virginity on their wedding night. This may be considered a breech of marital conduct that voids her entitlement to anything. Hence adding the word Besulah could add complexity if signs seemed to indicate otherwise.</p>\n<p>If a man suspects his Kallah, who is a Besulah, of infidelity due to the absence of both a blocked entry and blood of virginity (some women don't bleed), this is enough to render her forbidden to him - if there had been a time gap between nissuin and kiddushin where he could reasonably expect that she may have been intimate with another man.</p>\n<p>The example given of a divorcee who was also a virgin seems to be a very unique case, where all knew she was still a besulah. Hence, a lack of signs of virginity on the wedding night would be signs to seriously suspect infidelity between nissuin and kiddushin.</p>\n<p>While today there is no gap between the time of nissuin and kiddushin to cast so much doubt if a husband didn't see signs, it seems only information to protect the wife and uphold halacha are included in the kesubah. It is not so much a statement of her virtue but a way to ensure her protection as well as making reasonable standards.</p>\n<p>Is it forbidden to add the word Besulah? I don't know, I'm not a posek. But I suspect it could add more complexity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pBiCgzZf.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pBiCgzZf.jpg\" alt=\"Sources\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a shul choose to forgo establishing any set minhag regarding music restrictions on sefira?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My shul has a caterer that follows the halachot dictated by the shul's rav.</p>\n\n<p>During the <em>ben hashamashot</em> (bet. <em>mincha</em> 1st day & <em>ma'ariv</em> 2nd day Yom Tov), while discussing the laws of the <em>Sefira</em> period, my rav mentioned the different customs regarding music restrictions. Summarizing <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41319&st=&pgnum=230\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eliyahu Ki Tov's Sefer Hatoda'ah</a>, there are 2 date ranges for these restrictions (additional variations mainly related to Lag Ba'omer are also mentioned, but I'm omitting them, here):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Music permitted until Rosh Hodesh Iyar; prohibited from then until Lag Ba'omer, and prohibited again from 34 Omer until Erev Shavu'ot.</li>\n<li>Music prohibited from 2nd day Pesach until 34 Omer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The rav told us that when he was in his previous shul in a different city, they were the only shul, and he established the <em>minhag</em> to prohibit music in the shul (weddings. etc.) all days of sefirah except for Lag Ba'omer, as this was the minhag he had.</p>\n\n<p>When he moved into my neighborhood, he asked other rabbanim about the <em>minhag hamakom</em> (communal minhag) and the two rabbanim from the other two main shuls said that because the neighborhood has so many shuls and such a diverse set of minhagim, they did not establish any minhag for the shul at all. Thus, the only common \"overlap\" of the 2 aforementioned time ranges was to prohibit musical events in their shul only from Rosh Hodesh Iyar to Lag Ba'omer - about a 2 week period.</p>\n\n<p>I grew up in a neighborhood where we had a diverse community with many shuls (not as many as the neighborhood that I am currently in, which has far more). <em>Every</em> shul's minhag as well as my own family was to refrain from music the entire sefirah period until 3 days before Shavu'ot and Lag Ba'omer itself.</p>\n\n<p>My father-in-law who was a musician, had no business the entire sefirah period except for Lag Ba'omer. He performed at weddings throughout the NY, NJ, area and even a bit beyond. Suffice to say, there was no such leniency 30 years ago as there is now.</p>\n\n<p>Two questions:</p>\n\n<p>Isn't every shul supposed to establish some set / firm minhag according to what the rav or majority of shul members decide? I never heard of a leniency of \"no minhag at all\" such as what several rabbanim are practicing.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that 30 years ago, the shuls were \"stricter\" and tried to accommodate both minhagim by saying \"no music\" so as not to offend any group. Now, it seems the opposite policy. Now, they are saying, \"yes\" so as to accommodate everyone. What happened to change this policy? Is it all about getting the commission from catered events held at the shul?</p>\n\n\n",

The distinction, I don't think is in the halacha per se, but rather, which one of these is actually obeying what should be done.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/40348/is-goy-meant-to-be-a-pejorative-term?rq=1\">this related M.Y. question</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

They reason that the gemara's test that failed <em>kela ilan</em> was not due to an inherent weakness to the fastness of the dye. If that is the case, do they (or anyone else) present an argument as to why ancient aristocrats (including outside the Jewish world) would not have just had quality batches of plant-based dye made rather than rely on the pointlessly (for non-halachik purposes) expensive murex dye? Isn't this a rather damning argument against the species being the <em>chilazon</em>? Or was this the ancient world's equivalent of DeBeer's getting everyone to buy worthless chips of carbon when they get married?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I don't know if they address this concern particularly in terms of the expense.</p>\n\n<p>However, the knowledge that murex indigo is <strong>chemically identical</strong> to plant-based indigo is something knowable only in the 20th and 21st century, when we know about atoms, molecules, and chemicals. If plant-based indigo failed the gemara's test for fastness, and this was just a side-effect of the dyeing or production process, how can you assert that the ancient dyers knew this? It is at least as plausible that they did NOT believe that it was identical (other than having the same / similar color). They may well have believed that color-fastness or lack thereof was an intrinsic property of the snail / plant.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, while plant indigo can be the equivalent of murex indigo, there are actually different shades and hues.

My daughter receives disability  of $733 and as soon as it is put in my bank account, I go straight to the computer to donate $74 to a Jewish cause, mostly to help poor people in Israel. Here is my problem; doing so leaves me in a position where I cannot afford my rent (700) or my bills. Thankfully, buying food is not a problem because I receive assistance for that.

You're still obligated to give a few dollars a year to tzedaka, but not all that much. Please find a rabbi you trust, and you can discuss what's reasonable to give.

    "content": "# Why separate verses for the camel, hare, and hyrax?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0311.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Leviticus 11 with the Jewish Publication Society's translation\">vayikra 11</a>, we're given an overview of the kosher and non kosher animals. Among mammals, it singles out four as explicitly non kosher: the pig for only having split hooves, and the camel, hare, and hyrax for only chewing their cud.</p>\n<p>I can conceive of different reasons for having three separate examples in the later category (different types of cud chewing or inappropriate hoof splits ...), but what I <strong>can't</strong> conceive is why we need <strong>three</strong> separate verses <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0311.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Leviticus 11 with the Jewish Publication Society's translation\">(4–6)</a> for these examples. Can anyone shed some light on this?</p>\n<h3>Edit to clarify:</h3>\n<p>Why doesn't the Torah condense it to a single prohibition attached to a list: \"et hagamal v'et hashafan v'et ha'arnevet (which are three discrete examples of the following properties), ki shosa'as shesa hem uparsam aynenah mafreses, tameyim hem lachem.\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Blockquote I am not an expert in hares and hyraxes but the camel's issue is foot related but the others are cud related. I think the hare has 2 types of poop. One which it re-eats and the final form. Presumably the hyrax does the same thing with barf. We need the other 2 to say that these activities don't count as cud chewing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>i'm upvoting your answer and adding to it. People mistakingly assume that the Hare and the Hyrax chew their cud in the same way that the camel (or cow or deer) does, this is very far from the truth. Chewing of the cud the way that the camel does requires a multichambered stomach, which neither the Hare nor the Hyrax have. As you have pointed out, the hare often chews it's feces, this is not chewing of the cud. And i believe the Hyrax does a different system as well.</p>\n\n<p>So i believe your point makes sense. Why 3 different Pasukim?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Because the Camel chews it's cud in the normal way</p></li>\n<li><p>Because the Hare chews it's cud in a different way.</p></li>\n<li><p>Because the Hyrax chews it's cud different than the first two.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Therefore, to Israelites who originally might not have known the difference, the Torah uses the same terminology of chewing the cud, seeming superfluous. But now that we have the science and the observation to know that they are different, we can key in on the hint that the Torah is giving us.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The assumption behind this question is that every letter, every word and every verse of the Torah is measured out carefully. Thus, we see that from an extra vav, a halacha may be derived. When, in the discussions often found in the gemara, one Tanna interprets an extra word in one way to prove his point, we must take pains to explain how his disputant, the other Tanna, makes use of that extra word. When an entire narrative is repeated, as with Eliezer and Rivka, this is deemed extraordinary and goes to show Hashem's great esteem for the Avot. When in parashat Noach, the Torah adds a few words in one instance so as not to use the cruder language, this is deemed extraordinary against the usual background of brevity and so teaches us the importance of refined language.</p>\n\n<p>To sum up, there is this well-established notion that the every jot and tittle of the Torah is deliberate and that there is no unneeded repetition. While on a peshat level, many Rishonim would talk about natural linguistic motivations for extra words -- e.g. <em>kefel inyan bemilim shonot</em>, at the very least, in the realm of midrash halacha and midrash aggadah, there should be no repetition to no deliberate purpose.</p>\n\n<p>There should therefore exist a systematic interpretation of every seemingly extra letter, word, and phrase in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Many years back, I read a scholarly book (though cannot remember the name) about midrash halacha. The author asserted that, though Chazal attempted to make such a systematic interpretation across Torah, they did NOT succeed in this. That is, if you look through all of midrash halacha (of a work of midrash halacha) to see that every pasuk is accounted for, and every extra word, according to each opinion, you will find gaps that are really gaps.</p>\n\n<p>Your question is then about one of these apparent gaps.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if Chazal interpreted the extra split into pesukim here. I believe that they do.</p>\n\n<p>See Sifra on these pesukim, and particularly <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37625&st=&pgnum=244\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this quote</a>:</p>\n\n<p>\"את הגמל כי מעלה גרה הוא.. ואת השפן כי מעלה גרה הוא.. ואת הארנבת כי מעלה גרה היא\" מה תלמוד לומר? אם לתיקון המקרא הרי כבר נאמר 'הגמל והארנבת והשפן כי מעלה גרה המה', ולמה באו? לרבות את הריבויים שאמרנו.</p>\n\n<p>That is, it seems to ask why state separately these three, in three separate statements. And if for the purpose of Tikkun HaMikra (unclear what it is -- HaLivni says it is ambiguous and is the only place found in Rabbinic literature), it is already stated (Devarim 14:7) הגמל והארנבת והשפן כי מעלה גרה המה. Rather, it is to include all the ribuyim we have stated.</p>\n\n<p>So one should then learn through this Sifra carefully to deduce which ribuyim are accomplished specifically by splitting it up in this manner.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Also, I saw the following in a parsha sheet this Shabbos - which is what called me back to answer this question in the first place:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Fhd2S.jpg\" alt=\"Torah Lodaas parsha sheet - Baal Musar about invalidating someone, only on basis of past, present, future\"></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Devarim they're listed the way you suggested, all in one posuk.</p>\n\n<p>Daas Sofrim says (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39783&st=&pgnum=169\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39783&st=&pgnum=169</a>) that in Vayikra they're given each their own posuk to stress the issur because these animals were commonly eaten, and also because each one is on a different level in ruchnius (and Chazal say that each one represents one of the four kingdoms).</p>\n\n\n",

Here are some pertinent opinions that I found online, which may not be representative of the full gamut of authoritative positions. (All parenthetical jargon-translations are mine.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Union\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orthodox Union</a> (OU) provides <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/playing-with-fire/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a way</a> to deem food produced in a factory <em>bishul Yisrael</em> through a Jew turning the ovens on by remote control:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Yehuda Shain has recently developed an ingenious system whereby the mashgiach (kosher supervisor) can monitor the production from an off-site location. By installing a special device, it is possible to turn the oven on and off through the use of a touch-tone phone.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yisroel_Belsky\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Yisroel Belsky</a>, who is one of the OU's chief authorities, was <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/Sappirim/Sappirim%2025b-Vekasher%20HaDavar%20(Jul%202012).pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cited</a> by R' Eli Gersten providing more detail:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Belsky said that it is\n  acceptable to have the Mashgiach turn on the boiler\n  remotely, from his cell phone, by dialing in a special\n  code. ... Also if the <em>Mashgiach</em> sets a timer in the\n  evening to turn on the fire the next morning this is also\n  acceptable. However, Rav Belsky only allows timers\n  for a one time use but not if they turn on the oven\n  again and again, because then the <em>ma’aseh Yisroel</em> (action of the Jew)\n  is lost. Rav Belsky said that a timer for its first use is a\n  real <em>ma’aseh</em> (action), similar to <em>aisho mi’shum chitzo</em> (\"his fire [directly] via his arrow\"), and is\n  not only a גרמא (indirect action), but subsequent uses are only a גרמא.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>However, according to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Heinemann\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Moshe Heinemann</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-K\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Star-K</a>'s chief authority, the use such devices <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-issues-bishul.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">does not</a> grant <em>bishul Yisrael</em> status:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the action that is done by the <em>Yehudi</em> (Jew)\n  causes an indirect lighting of the oven, that action would not\n  qualify for <em>bishul Yisroel</em>. Hence, dialing a number that in turn\n  trips a switch that in turn lights an oven would be considered a\n  “<em>grama</em>”, an indirect action that would not qualify for <em>bishul\n  Yisroel</em>.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems to me that according to R' Belsky and presumably the OU, a Jew's programming the robot initially to cook many dishes in the future would not cause those meals to be considered <em>bishul Yisrael</em>, since the dishes would be only indirect results of the programming. However, if a Jew activates the robot to make an individual dish, then the resulting dish could be considered a direct result of the Jew's activation, like the timer set the night before in R' Belsky's example, and therefore <em>bishul Yisrael</em>. According to R' Heinemann, who doesn't consider a remote-controlled activation that <em>immediately</em> lights an oven sufficiently direct to grant <em>bishul Yisrael</em> status, I think it's unlikely that any sort of programming or activation of this robot, short of manually turning on its stove, would allow its product to be considered <em>bishul Yisrael</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the laws of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishul_Yisrael\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>bishul Yisrael</em></a> are complicated (and include many exceptions that are applicable to many practical cases), technology is complicated, and the application of the former to the latter is very complicated. If an issue of this sort comes up practically for you, consult your rabbi.</p>\n\n\n",

And that they were doing the avodos haketores in the proper time according to the halachos only with the foreign fire in their hearts. </p>\n\n\n",

Related to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18937/why-do-sephardic-jews-dress-in-black-and-white\">this question</a>, this outfit is distinct from the typical black-and-white clothing/black-hat attire that many contemporary Israeli Sephardic rabbis assume. Where did this custom come from? The distinctive flowery design sewn on the robe seems to have started with R. Ovadia Yosef, as I have not seen any picture of an earlier Sephardic chief rabbi with that design, but it has been continued to this day.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any significance to the design? How and why did it become the Rishon LeZion's official outfit? Is there any documentation on this outfit?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6RW1N.jpg\" alt=\"R.

Rabbis throughout the orient wore this type of garb regularly, as their dress reflected the culture they were in.

    "content": "# What is the definition of Zera Yisrael? Please read description\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom Aleichem, I am considering a halachic conversion to Judaism after having converted (along with several family members of mine) with a reform rabbi several years ago. In my research and studies, I have come across the term \"Zera Yisrael\", which I understand loosely means one of Jewish descent who is not halachically Jewish. I am wondering where the term comes from, what traditional contexts it is used in, and who the term specifically applies to. My curiosity stems in large part from an article by Rabbi Hyim Shafner (see source below) which seems to apply the definition liberally to include \"someone who is not technically Jewish by birth but has some connection to the Jewish people, a Jewish father or grandparent, or perhaps lives in the Jewish country fighting its wars and casting their lot with its people\". Does the traditional definition of \"Zera Yisrael\" include individuals of non-Jewish descent (and have yet to convert) who have cast their lots with the Jewish people and Yiddishkeit?</p>\n\n<p>In your response, please include sources. Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"http://morethodoxy.org/2010/04/03/why-we-need-a-reversion-of-conversion-by-rabbi-hyim-shafner/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://morethodoxy.org/2010/04/03/why-we-need-a-reversion-of-conversion-by-rabbi-hyim-shafner/</a>)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Kalischer was the first to coin the phrase: <em>Zera Yisrael</em></p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Kalischer used this in reference to someone born to a non-Jewish mother but had a jewish father. He referred to them as <em>Zera Kadosh</em> - Holy Lineage.\nHowever, Rabbi Kalischer did not use it in a halachic context. </p>\n\n<p>The most vocal and bold Halachist to apply this concept was the Former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of the State of Israel Rav Ben Zion Meir Chai Uziel (שו”ת משפטי עוזיאל, כרך ב יו”ד סי’ נב) who argued that the concept of Zera Yisrael is considered so legitimate that it can be applied to determine lineage. For example, if the non Jew -zera Yisrael father is a Kohen, despite his mother being a gentile, once he converts his \"zera Yisrael\" kicks in and he is considered a full fledged Kohen and can partake in the many benefits/ prohibitions that apply to Kohanim.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Uziel was deeply concerned about the fate of children born to a\n  Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother. <strong>Such children, although of\n  Jewish stock (zera Yisrael), are in fact not halakhically Jewish.</strong>\n  Children raised in such intermarriages will be lost to the Jewish\n  people entirely. <strong>Thus, it is obligatory for rabbis to convert the\n  non-Jewish mother in order to keep the children in the Jewish fold.</strong>\n  <strong>Rabbi Uziel noted: “And I fear that if we push them [the children]\n  away completely by not accepting their parents for conversion, we\n  shall be brought to judgment</strong> and they shall say to us: ‘You did not\n  bring back those who were driven away, and those who were lost you did\n  not seek.’ (Yehezkel 34:4).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/vol%207%20Angel.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Some</a> (source for quote above as well) have argued that the concept of <em>Zera Yisrael</em> is also used as a justification to streamline the conversion process. Where traditionally a certain amount of time is given in order to bring the prospective convert up to speed in torah knowledge, or acclimation to an observance life, as well as to discern their true motivation for conversion. Some have argued that in the case of a <em>Zera yisrael</em>, we speed up the process and accept them right away as it is a mitzvah to bring that back under The Wings of the <em>Schechina</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, this concept (if legitimate) is only limited to those that are literal descendants of Jewish lineage. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Judaism is a 'reshus' (domain), so that people within that domain (of God) are Jewish and people who are not within that domain are not Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>The halachah determines who is and who is not in this domain, for example the halachah determines that a black convert is Jewish, because they are within this reshus, and the child of an inter-marriage (Jewish father) is not because they aren't.</p>\n\n<p>I.e. the definition of the Jews is not a 'people' but an amalgamation.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the progenitor of a person not within this reshus may have been Jewish is therefore irrelevant to their Jewishness.</p>\n\n\n",

The point is, that each day, there is a mitzvah to count, with or without a bracha. If you count without a bracha, you still fulfilled the mitzvah of counting that day. The saying of the vracha is contingent on the concept of having \"temimot\" meaning \"full\", \"Complete\" or \"unblemished\", and since you missed a day, you've lost the completeness, and cannot say the bracha. But, obviously, you still can and MUST count, daily.</p>\n\n<p>For either of these two reasons, you can recite the Ribbono shel Olam following the counting.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The Chok Yakov ( O.

The proof is that after their death, [Scripture] admonished the survivors that they may not enter the sanctuary after having drunk wine.\"- Rashi to Vayikra Chapter 10 verse 2 (Parshat Shemini). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But why would Hashem punish someone for something they were not warned about previously. How would they know? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is another approach that can be taken regarding the death of Nadav and Avihu. Rather than seeing it as a punishment it can be regarded as a consequence. The difference is  very subtle, but this perspective can give us a possible answer:</p>\n\n<p>Rashi brings up Rabbi Ishmael's opinion that they died for having entered the sanctuary intoxicated by wine, but Rashi also mentions Rabbi Eliezer's opinion that they died for giving halchic decisions in front of their master Moshe. The connection between these two opinions is not obvious, but we can find the clue to their relationship with the following Gemarah: <strong>\"Wine enters, secrets emerge\"</strong> (Eruvin 65a)</p>\n\n<p>Nadav and Avihu drank in a holy fashion, so much so that through their drinking wine (yain nichnas sod yotzeh), they were able to achieve a tremendous level of divine love and revelation, and that is why they were able to give halachic decisions in front of Moshe.</p>\n\n<p>So why did they die? What was their mistake?</p>\n\n<p>It is explained in Chassidus that there is a connection between the death of Nadav and Avihu, and the story of the Four who entered the pardes:</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"The Talmud (Chagigah 14b) relates that four sages \"entered\" the sublime sphere called Pardes, \"Orchard,\" but only Rabbi Akiva emerged spiritually and emotionally intact. In the words of the Talmud, \"Rabbi Akiva entered in peace and left in peace.\" By describing the manner in which he entered [which does not seem to be pertinent to the story], the Talmud implies that his peaceful emergence was the result of his peaceful entrance. i.e. since his initial motivation for entering the Pardes was predicated on selflessness and the intention of \"shov\", his \"ratzo\"came to a positive conclusion.\"</strong> (Likutei Sichot vol. 3:990)</p>\n\n<p>So Nadav and Avihu's intense desire to cling to the divine resulted in their death, calot haNefesh, through achieving such intense revelation of the Divine their bodies were not able to continue to keep functioning. And that was the <strong>consequence</strong> rather than the punishment that resulted in their death.</p>\n\n<p>Nadav and Avihu's mistake was not taking into account God's desire, <strong>they</strong> wished to cling into the divine and transcend their physicality. But God desires that we learn Torah and perform Mitzvos, and to do that we need to be alive in a physical body.</p>\n\n<p>For further reading and sources check:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/379504/jewish/Drunk-on-G-d.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/379504/jewish/Drunk-on-G-d.htm</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380400/jewish/4-Who-Entered-the-Orchard.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380400/jewish/4-Who-Entered-the-Orchard.htm</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The mefarshim ask this question.\nA1.The kli Yakar answers not to get drunk before entering is a logical command, therefore they should've known.\nA2. The Riva answers the main punishment was really for the sin of the Eigel. (Presumably Ahron being chayiv for making it) the wine was just small excuse to punish them for the Eigel.\nA3. The Bartenura answers that Rabbi Yishmael is just explaining what led them to poskin before their rebbe (Moshe). In other words Rabbi Yishmael agrees they weren't really punished for drinking wine.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Your assumption is that their death was a \"punishment\" for their actions rather than a consequence of their actions.</p>\n\n<p>There is a difference. If you jump off a cliff or the roof of a high building it is likely you will die. Maybe nobody warned you but that will still be the consequence of your action.</p>\n\n<p>As they were not instructed to enter the Mishkan at that point there was no need really to issue them with the warning yet. The warning / instruction would normally come with the command to enter.</p>\n\n<p>Some Rabbis do also bring up other reasons that may, by themselves, have been worthy of a \"punishment\" too. (In particular, not consulting their Rebbe  (Moshe) first. They should have gone to Moshe and said \"We would like to bring whatever personal offering..\" and he would probably have replied telling them what they can and cannot do as personal offerings). I've also seen a comment that they incorreectly \"gazed\" at the Shechina when they went up the mount with Moshe and Aharon and were deserving of death at that time but the punishment was suspended. (Maybe they had been warned about that one).</p>\n\n<p>Remember that ALL the laws were given to Moshe at Mount Sinai. The Halacha had been given, although it was then repeated directly to Aharon.</p>\n\n\n",

This being said, I know of two approaches to <em>kulot</em> relevant to your question. R Yehuda Balsam conveniently writes them up <a href=\"http://bknworg.weebly.com/uploads/5/9/9/5/5995719/shaving_during_sefira.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>In a situation when one has a situation in which he will lose money,\n  or possibly his job</strong>, R Moshe Feinstein writes (O.C. 4:102) that it is\n  permissible to shave. However, during the week in which Tish’a b’av\n  falls out, since it is halachikly assur m’drabanan to shave, one may\n  not do so under these circumstances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>dinonline expands on this</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As R Moshe Feinstein explains elsewhere (Choshen Mishpat 1:93), <strong>this leniency\n  only applies if an actual loss would be incurred</strong>. If appearing\n  unshaven merely causes ridicule or embarrassment, the leniency does\n  not apply. Clearly, this will also be true of the discomfort a person\n  suffers from not shaving for a number of days.</p>\n  \n  <p>A similar ruling was given by R Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Maadanei\n  Shlomo) concerning the Omer period: <strong>It is permitted to shave for one’s\n  livelihood, but it is otherwise forbidden</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>[However], “Kuntress Liknos Chochmah” cites R Yosef Shalom Elyashiv\n  that today it is forbidden to shave during the Omer even for purposes\n  of one’s livelihood, since being unshaven today does not cause a\n  person to look odd. This clearly depends on a person’s environment and\n  in practice if a person’s livelihood might be at stake the consensus\n  is to be lenient.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The second approach is from R Yosef Ber Soloveitchik (again from <a href=\"http://bknworg.weebly.com/uploads/5/9/9/5/5995719/shaving_during_sefira.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Nefesh Harav p. 191 he writes that shaving was permissible\n  during sefirah. He reasons that when the bnei yisrael accept a new\n  minhag, that minhag must be patterned after an existing halacha,\n  either mid’oraisah or mid’rabanan. An aveil observes three major steps\n  in his mourning: 1) the ‘shivah’ period, observed during the first\n  week, 2) the ‘shloshim’ which is the remaining thirty days, 3) the\n  remaining twelve months. Rav Soloveitchik assumed that the aveilus of\n  sefirah was patterned after the aveilus of the twelve months. During\n  this period, both shaving and haircuts are prohibited. However, the\n  gemarah (mo’ed kattan 22b) writes that if he becomes disheveled ‘ad\n  sheyig’ar bo chaveirav’-until his friends scold him, he may cut his\n  hair and shave.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Thus, one who normally shaves every day,  and refrains from doing so\n  for a few days would be considered to have reached this point. Thus,\n  it is permissible for him to shave during this period</strong> (it is important\n  to note that Rav Soloveitchik himself did not trim his beard during\n  sefirah, because he did not consider that to be sufficiently unkempt\n  to apply this din.) R Soloveitchik’s opinion is obviously not the\n  mainstream shittah, but it has been accepted by some of his Talmidim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

One notable one is the reason to take out 2 Torah scrolls on <em>Yom Tov</em> so that the congregation shouldn't have to wait to roll the 1st Torah from one place to another. This is true, even if the 2 readings are nearby, and it takes less than a minute to roll.</p>\n<p>In short (no pun, here), it seems that <strong>time</strong> is the primary factor used to determine the <em>tircha</em>. I.e., even a short delay is considered <em>tircha</em>. There are other halachot instituted esp. regarding eliminating certain proposed items in the weekday Shacharit (IIRC, not reciting the blessings from Bil'am is one example) b/c of <em>tircha d'tzibur</em> and people are rushing to work - clearly, a time concern.</p>\n<p>In view of the Shulchan Aruch emphasizing that even a minute minute is too long, it appears that some, if not all, of these examples should also be considered <em>tircha</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A chazzan that sings \"too much\" or too slowly esp. in Kedusha and esp. if he repeats words.</p>\n<p>(for purposes of answering this question, I am not interested in other problems of repeating anything during davening.

I don't recall any sefarim addressing any of these issues. However, to me, it seems logical that these actions <em>should</em> be considered tircha d'tzibur*, but, apparently, aren't, since many shuls practice some of those in the list.</p>\n<p>In summary, why are these longer activities not considered <em>tircha</em>, when compared to the Torah rolling example, which seems to develop the guideline or definition of what amount of time <em>tircha</em> should be?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Witnesses and the Ketubah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard from a chief rabbi of an Israeli city, who was officiating at a wedding I was at, that a Ketubah must be signed by two witnesses who are <em>shomer mitzvos</em>. What is the legal definition of this vis a vis a Ketubah? What does one who if there are no totally <em>shomer mitzvos</em> men? </p>\n\n<p>Would men who learn Torah or were formerly <em>shomer mitzvos</em> \"make do\"? What of <em>baalei tshuva</em> who still have not taken on the full Torah, but keep mitzvos to the best of the ability at their stage? </p>\n\n<p>Let's say that in addition to the totally frum (religious) rabbi, that no totally frum people have any chance of making this wedding.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The ketubah, like any Jewish legal document, requires the signature of two witnesses. Besides being Jewish men who are unrelated to each other (or to the bride or groom), there are other qualifications.  </p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Arukh (חושן משפט הלכות עדות סימן לד) rules that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רשע פסול לעדות</p>\n  \n  <p>A <em>rasha</em> is invalidated from serving as a witness </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is a <em>rasha</em>? The Shulchan Arukh continues:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל שעבר עבירה  שחייבים עליה מלקות;  ואצ\"ל אם חייבים עליה מיתת ב\"ד. ל\"ש אם עבר לתיאבון, ל\"ש אם עבר להכעיס. <strong>הגה</strong>:  עבר עבירה  שאין בה מלקות, פסול מדרבנן</p>\n  \n  <p>It is anyone who transgresses a transgression that requires lashes. It's unnecessary to discuss if someone deserves death through a court sentence [i.e., since even a more minor offense disqualifies him]. It also doesn't matter if he transgressed out of appetite or anger. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Rama</strong>: If a person transgressed a transgression that doesn't require lashes, he is invalidated rabbinically.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Transgressing Shabbat observance, a major biblical commandment, would  certainly fall into that category. Defining a <em>rasha</em> these days is complicated, but modern authorities essentially stress that a ketubah witness should be Torah-observant [committed to following all of halakha] and definitely Shabbat-observing. The Yalkut Yosef (נישואין ושידוכים פרק ז' - נתינת הטבעת ליד הכלה), for example, puts it this way: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כן יש להקפיד שהעדים יהיו יראי ה' ושומרי תורה ומצוות, ולא חלילה מחללי שבת בפרהסיא ומגלחי זקנם בתער וכדומה. ורב המסדר קידושין בחתונה אצל חילוניים, יקח עמו עד כשר ויהיו הוא עצמו והשני, שני העדים. וטוב שתלמידי חכמים יהיו עדים</p>\n  \n  <p>One must be sure that the witnesses are God-fearing and keep the Torah and mitzvot; that they do not publicly desecrate Shabbat, shave their face with razors, and so on. The rabbi officiating a wedding for secular Jews should bring with him a kosher witness so that he and the second one will act as witnesses. It is also good for students of sages to be witnesses. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If a witness is not religiously observant, or if there is no second witness for the ketubbah signing, then the ketubbah is invalid. Whether or not a wedding conducted without a valid ketubbah can still make a couple married is a different question, and has been discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14166/is-marriage-without-ketubah-considered-marriage-concubinage-or-kiddushin-she-e?lq=1\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The footnote for the Yalkut Yosef provides a story related to this discussion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והדבר מצוי בעיקר ברבנים מסדרי קידושין לחילוניים, ופעמים שלא נמצאים שם אנשים יראי שמים ושומרי תורה ומצוות זולת אלה שיש להם קירבה משפחתית לחתן או לכלה, וצריך ליזהר בזה. ומרן אאמו\"ר שליט\"א נוהג ברוב הפעמים שהוא עצמו משמש כאחד העדים, ומצרף עמו עד נוסף. ואחד הרבנים בארץ סיפר לנו, שפעם סידר קידושין באחד המושבים החילוניים, ולא מצא שם אפי' אדם אחד שיהיה ראוי להיות עד, ואחד הציע עצמו להיות עד, וכאשר לקחו לצד ושאלו היאך הוא מתגלח, נתברר שהוא מתגלח בתער. עד שמצא שאחד המלצרים הוא שומר תורה ומצוות, וצירף אותו יחד עמו לעדות הקידושין.</p>\n  \n  <p>This issue is essential for rabbis who officiate at secular weddings, as sometimes there are no God-fearing, Torah and mitzvot-observant men to be found, except those related to the bride and groom [and thus disqualified]. It's important to be careful about this. Maran [R. Ovadia Yosef] often served as a witness [in addition to being the rabbi] and would bring a second witness with him. One of the rabbis in Israel told us that once he officiated in a secular community, and he couldn't find even one man that could serve as a witness. One man offered himself to be a witness, but after the rabbi took him to the side and asked him how he shaves, it became clear that he shaved with a razor [and was thus disqualified from serving as a witness]. It was only until the rabbi found a waiter who kept Torah and mitzvot, and joined as a witness with him, that he could make the wedding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/09-03-08/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pniniei Halocho of Rabbi Melamed</a> defines valid witnesses. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן אדם שאינו מזדהה עם הערכים שעליהם מבוססים הקידושין, היינו עם ערכי\n  התורה, אינו יכול להיות עד בחתונה. ולכן אדם שחוטא בגילוי עריות, למשל,\n  מקיים יחסים עם אשת איש, או עם אחותו או בתו וכדומה, פסול לעדות. וכן אדם\n  שחשוד בגניבה פסול מלהיות עד, וכמובן שאין הבדל בין אדם שמתפרץ לבית\n  חבירו בלילה וגונב, לבין מי שמוכר בחנות ומשנה את המחירים או את המשקל\n  לטובתו, או מנהל מפעל שגונב כסף מחשבון המפעל לכיסו, כל אלה גנבים\n  ופסולים לעדות. וכן אדם שאינו שומר שבת כהלכתה, ואינו שותף מלא לכל ערכי\n  התורה, אינו יכול להיות עד למעשה הקידושין שכל כולו מבוסס על מצוות\n  התורה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Idiomatic translation:\nAfter dealing with the invalidity of  a family member, the Rav goes on to say that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the witness must value the principles of marriage according to the\n  Torah. If he is guilty of immorality or has relations with a married\n  woman or a close relative he will be invalid. Someone suspected of\n  theft will be invalid whether this is crude theft or white-collar\n  theft. Someone who does not keep Shabbos according to its laws or who\n  is not a party to Torah values cannot be a witness for the marriage\n  which is totally based on Torah values.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I deduce therefore, that someone who was formerly observant or learnt Torah (and by implication is not now) is surely invalid. He is not “a party to Torah values”. </p>\n\n<p>The “baal tshuva” who still has not taken on the full Torah (despite his achievements and progress) who keeps mitzvos to the best of his ability cannot similarly be considered to be “a (full) party to Torah values”. (In the worst case, maybe one of the mitzvos he has not yet taken on is the value of marriage!).</p>\n\n<p>If in addition to the totally frum rabbi, if no totally frum people have any chance of attending this wedding, then the wedding should be scheduled for a time when two valid witnesses could be found. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's not just to sign the ketubah -- more importantly, you need two adult, Jewish, Sabbath-observant, unrelated men to <em>witness him giving her the ring</em> or else you don't have a marriage altogether.</p>\n\n<p>The rabbi can be one of the witnesses, and if he's attending a wedding where everyone's non-observant, he will usually know to bring a friend (who's not a close relative) to serve as the second one. (Both to sign the ketubah, and witness the ring-giving.) Usually the rabbi has thought of this in advance, and if not, someone should address it with him ahead of time.</p>\n\n<p>In America, it's also not-unheard-of for the couple to stop by the rabbi's office a day or two before the wedding to have the legal ring and ketubah, and the rabbi will have another witness handy; and then they can invite all their friends for the big \"wedding\" (and whatever ceremony they feel like).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Vegan tekheileth\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does the oral tradition that identifies the <em>hilazon</em> as the source of <em>tekheles</em> necessarily indicate that one could not create the indigo-colored wool by other means? The <em>gemara</em> certainly indicates that the color-equivalent, plant-derived <em>kala ilan</em> is not valid (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.40a.12?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Menachot 40a</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.43a?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">43a</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.61b?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bava Metzia 61b</a>) but it also implies that this particular dye was not as fast and permanent as true <em>tekhelet</em> (and therefore, implicitly, was not its molecular equivalent). If that is the case, if one was able to create a dye that was chemically indistinguishable from true <em>tekhelet</em>, considering that <em>torah shebiksav</em> (the Written Law) never explicitly mentions the source of <em>tekhelet</em>, might that not also be acceptable?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>This requirement is stated in the <em>Tosefta</em> and <em>Meseches Tzitzith</em></p>\n<p>Tosefta Menachoth 9:16</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"תכלת אין כשרה אלא מן החלזון הביא שלא מן החלזון\nפסולה.\"</p>\n<p>Tekheleth is only valid from the חלזון ; if one used a dye not\nmade from the חלזון it is invalid.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>מסכת ציצית פרק א הלכה י</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאין צובעין תכלת אלא בחלזון.</p>\n<p>We only dye תכלת with a חלזון</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>from: <a href=\"https://www.techeiles.org/harav-meir-halevi-hellman-levush-haaron/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.techeiles.org/harav-meir-halevi-hellman-levush-haaron/</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Lipschitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yisrael Lipschitz</a> writes the following in his introduction to Seder Moed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הכלל העולה דבין ציצית ובין בגדי כהונה א״צ חלזון דוקא אבל צריך בשניהן שיהיה מראה (היממעלבלויא) שאינו משתנה מיפיו ע״י בדיקה שהזכיר הש״ס</p>\n<p>The principle that emerges is that both by <em>tzitzit</em> and by the priestly vestments it is not necessary to specifically use a <em>chilazon</em>.

Joseph Ber Soloveitchik</a> (as recorded in שיעורי הרב הגאון רבי יוסף דב הלוי סולוביצ׳יק זצ״ל על עניני ציצית עניני תפילין והלכות קריאת התורה) reached the same conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובה״ב כיצד צובעין תכלת של ציצית לוקחים וכו׳ דם חלזון וכו׳ אבל בה״א לא הזכיר חלזון כשהגדיר מהו התכלת רק בה״ב כשהזכיר איך עושים אותה בפועל ומשמע דלא הוי חלזון הללמ״מ אלא שבמציאות הוא הי׳ הצבע היחיד שהי׳ מתקיים שהי׳ עינו השמים והים אבל איה״נ דאילו הי׳ לנו בזה״ז צבע סינטטי אחר שהי׳ מתקיים הי׳ כשר לתכלת</p>\n<p>And in Law 2: “How do we dye the <em>techeilet</em> of <em>tzitzit</em>? Take... the blood of the <em>chilazon</em>...” But in Law 1 <em>chilazon</em> is not mentioned when <em>techeilet</em> is defined; only in Law 2 when mentioning how to actually make it. This implies that <em>chilazon</em> is not a law to Moses from Sinai; rather, it was in reality the only dye that was steadfast whose color was [that of] the sky and the sea. But indeed if we had nowadays another synthetic dye that was steadfast it would be valid for <em>techeilet</em>.</p>\n<p>(Elisions in original)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One interesting point.

He sees no reason to differentiate the techeiles of tzitzis from the techeiles of the priestly garments since the Torah uses the same word in both cases. He concludes that as long as a blue dye is the correct shade and is colorfast then it should meet the Torah's requirements. However, after consulting with expert dyers of his day, Tiferes Yisrael discovered that there did not exist any blue dye known at that time that was sufficiently colorfast.</p>\n  \n  <p>[Tiferes Yisrael was certainly familiar with plant-based indigo, for he identifies kala ilan as indigo. Apparently he felt that the indigo of his day was not colorfast enough to pass the strict chemical tests described by the Gemara.]</p>\n  \n  <p>He concludes that, for practical purposes, the only way to obtain techeiles must be from a chilazon. Had Tiferes Yisrael been shown the indigo of today, which is certainly colorfast, he would likely agree that it would serve as techeiles both for tzitzis as well as the priestly garments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above stated, he's the only one hypothetically supportive of Kala Ilan used for Techeiles.

In actual fact, the Rif died in 1103 and the Rambam was not born until 1138. While it is possible that the Rambam had studied for a brief time under the Rif's student, the Ri Migash (1077-1141), it is most likely that he received his primary education from his father, Maimon, who was himself a student of the Ri Migash and not of the Rif.</p>\n\n<p>To say that the Rambam's teacher was the Rif because his actual teacher had studied under a student of the Rif seems like a rather long shot, and I feel forced to conclude that the Bartenura meant one of two things: either the Rambam studied the <em>Torah</em> of the Rif (in which case the Rif was his rav in the same way that R' Yosef Rosen, for example, described the Rambam as <em>his</em> rav), or the Bartenura actually thought that the Rif had literally been the Rambam's teacher.</p>\n\n<p>Neither of these suggestions is entirely satisfactory to me: the first seems fanciful and the second is predicated on something that we know to be simply wrong.</p>\n\n<p>a) Is there another way in which the Bartenura's statement might be understood?</p>\n\n<p>b) Alternatively, is there precedent for describing as one's rav a person who died before one was born?</p>\n\n<p>c) Is there reason to suppose that at the time of the Bartenura people may have thought that the Rambam had studied under the Rif?</p>\n\n\n",

There's a force of evil that's external like an angel that persuades us to sin, and there's an evil that's within our hearts that causes our evil desires. The yetzer hara is mixed into our hearts. We view the outer force of evil as not being a part of us so we feel that we can overcome it, but we see the inner force of evil as a part of us, so it's much more difficult to overcome. Therefore, there's a yetzer hara within us, and a yetzer hara outside of us which causes us to sin. Additionally, there is a third kind of evil, the evil that the erev rav brought with them when we left mitzrayim. They brought an evil government with them. When Hashem spoke to us at har sinai, the erev rav didn't want to hear Hashem's voice, they wanted to hear it through moshe, and they were not ready to be moser nefesh for Hashem so they didn't hear His voice. When we heard the torah at har sinai, we attained freedom and it completed the freedom that began in mitzrayim. We had a certain freedom when we left mitzrayim, but also a certain freedom when we were given the torah. But still, the erev rav are there to prevent us from receiving holiness. When we left mitzrayim, our outer yetzer hara left us, and when we heard the torah the inner yetzer hara left us, but the erev rav wa still present. The erev rav didn't want us to be moser nefesh to hear the torah, and each year they come back to prevent us from being moser nefesh. In order to be free on pesach and be prepared for receiving the torah, we need to have mesirus nefesh. When it says there's no free person except the one who learns torah, it means that if we want to be free of the erev rav's influence, we need to have messirus efesh in learning torah. If we always yearn to do Hashem's will, it will help us have mesirus nefesh and have true cheirus to overcome the influence of the erev rav that persuades us. </p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://bilvavi.net/files/Pesach.Talks.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://bilvavi.net/files/Pesach.Talks.pdf</a> page 62-64</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As noted <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/60175/8775\">here</a>, when the rabbis say that a word means something in particular, in the form \"X\" is naught but \"Y\", they do not mean that this is the literal meaning of the word, but at most, that that is its usage in a particular context.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, as cited from R. Saul Lieberman z\"l, it isn't necessarily even implying a strict interpretation in that context, but rather, it is a literary phrase used to introduce a Midrashic hyperbole.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the Mishna doesn't actually mean to actually interpret the word as חרות; freedom (in fact I don't think חרות even means freedom in Biblical Hebrew). And certainly doesn't mean that the only person who can ever be referred to as free in any context, is one who is occupied in Torah study.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, note the numerous references to freedom in Parashat Mishpatim (Exodus 21:2,5,26), none of which relate to Torah study.</p>\n\n<p>That is the real answer.</p>\n\n<p>Homiletically, we could answer that the time of the exodus is the time of freedom, since the point of the exodus was receiving thethe Torah. Cf. Exodus (3:12):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זֶה־לְּךָ֣ הָא֔וֹת כִּ֥י אָנֹכִ֖י שְׁלַחְתִּ֑יךָ בְּהוֹצִֽיאֲךָ֤ אֶת־הָעָם֙ מִמִּצְרַ֔יִם תַּֽעַבְדוּן֙ אֶת־הָ֣אֱלֹהִ֔ים עַ֖ל הָהָ֥ר הַזֶּֽה </p>\n  \n  <p>This is the reason why I have sent you: when you remove the nation from Egypt, you will serve God on this mountain. (Translation following Ibn Ezra there)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The service at the mountain refers to receiving the Torah, as explained by R. Hayyim Paltiel, in his commentary there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תעבדון את האלהים שתקבלו התורה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the point of the exodus was receiving the Torah, we an rightfully refer to the time of the exodus as the time of freedom, even were the term 'freedom' only appropriately applied to one occupied in Torah study, since the exodus was just the prelude to accepting the Torah, which is obviously the most essential prerequisite to being truly free by studying the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does the chametz sales contract need to be enforceable under secular law?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We go to great lengths to ensure that our pre-<em>Pesach</em> <em>chametz</em> sale is effective according to <em>halacha</em>. Thus, we effect the sale via various means of acquisition: <em>kinyan kesef</em>, <em>kinyan sudar</em>, <em>kinyan agav karka</em>, <em>kinyan chatzer</em>, and <em>hefker bes din</em>. We also write a sales contract, which is halachically effective, <a href=\"http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/13-27%20Mechirat%20Chametz%20-%20Part%203.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Chaim Jachter explains</a>, not as <em>kinyan sh'tar</em>, but as a part of the <em>kinyan kesef</em> or as a <em>situmta</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Do we try to ensure that that contract be enforceable according to local (non-Jewish) law, e.g. in secular courts, or is that not important?</p>\n\n<p>I suspect we may, since we're using it as <em>situmta</em> (the way people transact business), and people transact business with enforceable contracts. On the other hand, maybe the form of the transaction (viz, with a contract) is what makes it a <em>situmta</em> and not the details (e.g., enforceability of the contract). (I honestly don't know much about how <em>situmta</em> works.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>One possible relevance of this question is the sales contract in France. In the United States, as far as I know, the contract is written in Hebrew. (The gentile, in most cases at least, cannot read it himself, but it's explained to him and of course he can hire a professional translator if he so desires.) However, I'm told that no contract is enforceable in France unless it's in French.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Dr. Ari Zivotofsky <a href=\"https://jewishaction.com/religion/jewish-law/whats-the-truth-about-the-sale-of-chametz-on-pesach/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sale of chametz must be fully binding under Jewish law, and some authorities require that it meet local legal standards as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, this is one of the rare statements in that article that is not footnoted, so we have no clue who these authorities might be.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://din.org.il/2010/03/08/%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%AA-%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%A5/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this comprehensive article</a> by Rabbi Yosef Fleischmann, it is repeated, and a source is cited, and for those who cannot read Hebrew, it is the Haggaddah of Rav Moshe Shternbuch:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(<strong>ועדיף לעשות מכירת חמץ בצורה שמועילה על פי חוק</strong>.

Accordingly, \"from <em>him</em>\" presumably means from God, because presumably God did not make a soul for Adam, from Adam, and God is the only other entity mentioned in the blessing that \"him\" could refer to.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the siddur in question may follow this interpretation.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If I might add, this interpretation seems a bit far fetched, considering that the term \"building\" is explicitly employed by the biblical text in reference to the creation of Eve (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39996&st=&pgnum=26\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 2:22</a>) and not in reference to the soul (see <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39996&st=&pgnum=22\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 2:7</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>This Rabbinic blessing, written in Greco-Roman times, is no doubt a reference to \"The Key Stone\" of the woman to which they eluded to in another statement in Eruvin 18, upside-down \"אוצר\", and it is well known that the arch form was on the mind of the rabbis from their statement in Shabbos 106- אחד מבני החבורה... no doubt a reference to an arch of which the Key stone is often of different size than rest of arch- hence \"some - the greatest, and \"some- the smallest\" although those 2 opinions could be the argument on בקצה המחנה- בקצינים,במוקצים\". The rabbis would warn that like arches,family and social \"buildings\" fall and are looser when one is taken out.The smiting might be to undo entire construct and therefore will be through removal of Key stone.</p>\n<p>The woman was the בניין עדי עד and probably this reads into verse עזר כנגדו not as \"זכה- עזר,לא זכה - כנגדו\" but as the very description of the \"structure \" of eternity = Woman's Key stone, and a reference to the race's eternity viewed as one body- עד שיכלו נשמות מן הגוף... (I am attempting to answer how is it בניין עדי עד... how is it forever. It is in the entirety of Humanity along the generations) Archeological evidence of survival of Roman arch in structures to this day as well as the gateway/ doorway often the only surviving part of a structure is proof of this idea and knowledge.

    "content": "# Do any communities have the non-Jew come get some of his chametz?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is an established practice to sell one's <em>chametz</em> (leavened products) to a non-Jew over Passover to avoid the biblical prohibition of a Jew owning <em>chametz</em> during the festival. Unfortunately, often the non-Jewish buyer does not consider the sale to actually be a real sale, and neither do many of the Jewish sellers (who would likely call the cops if the buyer showed up on Pesach asking for his half bottle of whiskey and his <em>bliyos</em> in the cholent pot). This can be a real problem halachically since we have a rule that <em>asmachta lo kanya</em> which means that if there is no real commitment or recognition that one is giving something up for real, the agreement is nonbinding and invalid. (This is one of the halachic problems with gambling where the gambler doesn't really expect to lose.) </p>\n\n<p>This may be the main reason many only sell products that are unlikely to be actual <em>chametz</em> (e.g. flour, vinegar, play-doh, perfumes, etc.). </p>\n\n<p>Likewise, this is the reason Rabbi <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_Willig\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mordechai Willig</a> of Riverdale, NY only sells to a non-Jewish lawyer familiar with the concept of legal fictions that are nonetheless binding and further instructs him (informing his congregants accordingly) to drop in randomly on the Jewish sellers on Pesach to pick up some of his actually legally acquired <em>chametz</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Is anyone aware of any other rabbis/communities where the non-Jew actually picks up <em>chametz</em> from his sellers on Pesach?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I have to rely on my rav's story that he tends to repeat to the congregation each year.</p>\n\n<p>When he was in a different community, prior to his becoming rav in our shul, he occasionally came with the Gentile during Yom Tov, itself, to someone's home. The home owners were surprised to see the rabbi at their door, and, being respectful, they let him in. </p>\n\n<p>The rabbi said, \"I have brought the Gentile whom I sold your <em>chametz</em> to, with me, to show you that the sale was not fiction.\" Turning to the Gentile, the rabbi says. \"Sir, The bottle of MacCallan M 1940 is in this closet (hyperbole on the specific item). Please go there, and help yourself.\" And the Gentile, happily took his bottle of fine whiskey and he and the rabbi calmly left, leaving a stunned <em>Ba'al Habayit</em>. I didn't ask my rav if at the end of Pesach the Gentile returned the whiskey or paid for it.</p>\n\n<p>I'm unaware of my rav having repeated this practice since he moved to our community. He doesn't request house keys, but, most rabbis in my community do request each person's house key at the time of selling the chametz. I don't think any Gentile has actually acted on requesting anything, but IMO, it would be nice if every rav acted the way that my rav did. It would send a clear message that the sale is not fiction or a joke by any means. In a way, laxity promotes mockery.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>the noda b'yehuda in response is the one who held of this opinion of giving a key to the storage room where the chametz was kept. and the sdei chemed also brings this as being minhag of his city... so theres a similar minhag...</p>\n\n\n",

Who is \"he\"?  Kehati says it's the buyer, but I'm not sure where he gets that from, because Rashi in the Gemara (107b) says it's the seller.  And Rashi himself is stated without proof; the gemara does not make this point clear.  So who has to provide the land for the fence?</p>\n\n<p>Q2: The mishna says that one person (whoever that is) has to provide the <em>place</em> for the fence.  Does that imply that the fence itself should be a shared cost?  If my <em>diyuk</em> is correct, how does that square with the mishnayos in the first perek, where it's pretty consistent that a shared wall is built with joint funds and straddles the border, whereas a wall put up by only one of the neighbors has to be built entirely on his property, and he puts a <em>siman</em> on the outside to show that the materials and the land are his?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>Rashash</em> (on the <em>mishna</em> in the <em>g'mara</em>) cites a <em>machlokes</em> as to who has to provide the location of the divider: <em>Rashbam</em> says it's the seller [as do <em>Rabenu Ger'shom</em> on the page of the <em>g'mara</em>, alleged <em>Rashi</em> on the page of the <em>Rif</em>, and <em>Nimuke Yosef</em>], while <em>Rambam</em> (commentary on the <em>mishna</em>) says it's the buyer.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# A wife wants to stop going to the mikva.

My wife has never particularly felt connected to the laws of family purity, but has gone to the mikvah since we got married for my sake, because I felt that these laws are important.</p>\n\n<p>We have been married almost twenty years, we don't want to get divorced. But she is fed up with the total one-sidedness of the whole situation. It's called \"family purity,\" which suggests mutual responsibility, but the truth is, the onus is completely on her, except for the fact that I have to abstain from sex as well as her. </p>\n\n<p>She feels that these laws were developed by men, long ago, and that it's a huge burden. She has tried to find something positive in it, but finds the entire experience overwhelmingly negative. Neither her emuna, nor mine, to be honest, is particularly strong. I cannot honestly say that I keep as many mitzvot as I possibly can, but I am comfortable with my level of observance. So we both feel that it is kind of hypocritical that I am asking her to keep carrying the burden of all that is required of her halachically, in addition to the physical discomfort of having a period in the first place, to keep the laws of family purity, while I have to do nothing, when I am actually the only one who feels any benefit. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that I don't make a huge effort to keep all the mitzvot that I possibly can, and considering that my faith is not so strong in the first place. I am not, nor have a I ever wanted to be, or tried to be shomer negia.</p>\n\n<p>So what are the halachic ramifications for me if she stops going to the mikva? I can honestly say that I will not divorce her for this, nor will I abstain from sex with her because of this, so that's not the answer that I'm looking for. I'm trying to determine the consequences that each of us incur upon ourselves if she stops going to the mikva and we remain married, and continue to have sexual relations.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 26)\n\n<p>Halachically, you transgress a biblical commandment if you knowingly have relations with a <em>niddah</em>, and the punishment is <em>karet</em>.  See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/29623/472\">this answer</a>, which cites Rambam Laws of Prohibitions on Relations 4:3.  According to Rambam Issurei Biah 1:1 (h/t DoubleAA), punishments for forbidden relations apply to both except in a special case not applicable here.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, the talmud on Ketubot 72 includes this case in a list of reasons for which a man may divorce his wife and not pay her <em>ketubah</em>.  I know you don't want to get divorced; I'm just pointing it out as a possible consequence for other couples.  (I don't know what later sources have to say about that, and one shouldn't go <em>only</em> on one <em>daf</em> of talmud.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Having said that, I'm going to respond to the rest of what you wrote.  By your report, your wife resents the <em>niddah</em> laws because they place the burden entirely on her -- what does <em>she</em> get out of this, beyond that it makes you happy?  While spouses should always try to do things that bring each other happiness where possible, she's feeling burdened.  It's not fair.  I <em>totally</em> get that.</p>\n\n<p>You care about her doing this and you both care about having a happy marriage.  So what can you do to make this feel less one-sided?  Halacha might not <em>demand</em> anything of you, but in the interests of infusing some positive feelings into the marriage for <em>both</em> of you, I suggest you think about ways to make <em>mikvah</em> night special <em>for her</em>.  Not as a bribe for going to the <em>mikvah</em>, but as a kindness that you do for somebody you love at a time when she's feeling burdened.  You'd take some of the load off if she were sick, or stressed by work/school/kids/family, or just feeling down, right?  So take some of the load off from <em>this</em> source of aggravation too.</p>\n\n<p>What that looks like depends on the two of you, but, for example, maybe it would help if you cooked her a nice dinner that night (or took her out)?  That's just one idea.  Do something nice for her.  From her perspective she's doing something nice (not required) for you, so if she feels like she's <em>receiving</em> some kindness too, maybe that'll help her feel better about it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>I am impressed by the gravity of your inquiry and your care in the matter in that you are seeking real answers to a complicated question. May Hashem help the two of you and anyone else in need of this post.</p>\n\n<p>First let's address some issues your question raised in this case, and then let's address the Halachic ramifications.</p>\n\n<p>The OP states that your wife is wishing to stop practicing mikveh observance, in part, because: \"She feels that these laws were developed by men, long ago, and that it's a huge burden.\" Also she said: \"...she is fed up with the total one-sidedness of the whole situation. It's called \"family purity,\" which suggests mutual responsibility, but the truth is, the onus is completely on her,...\"</p>\n\n<p>1.) One-sided onus:</p>\n\n<p>There is a famous Jewish Law in all matters of ritual observance which says that \"Eyd Echad Ne'emaan B'Issurim\" (One witness is believed regarding permitting the potentially forbidden). (see Talmud Gittin 2b and elsewhere)</p>\n\n<p>The reason I can go to your house and eat food as your guest (without personally supervising the Kashrut) is because I may trust you. In fact, the entire Kashrus industry relies on the testimony of single witnesses in factories and farms as far flung as the Pennsylvania countryside to Hong Kong. </p>\n\n<p>So where in the entire Torah does it say that Hashem lets us believe the testimony of one witness? What case did Almighty G-d deem fit to represent the fact that you may utterly trust your friend's word without question in matters of spiritual life and death? Was it a case of kosher meat, a temple sacrifice, or the observance of Yom Kippur? What is the paradigm used by the Holy Torah to teach that we owe each other love and loyalty to believe a person when they tell us something? </p>\n\n<p>It is the fact that a man must, by Torah Law, trust his own wife concerning the laws of family purity.</p>\n\n<p>Vayikra (Levit.) 15:28 \"If she ceases her flow, she must count seven days <strong><em>for herself</em></strong> and afterwards she can be purified.\"</p>\n\n<p>The words \"for herself\" mean that she purifies herself privately and is believed. (Talmud Ketubot 72a) This is the source in the Torah that a single witness is privately believed. (according to Tosfos Gittin 2b)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we now see the reason the Torah made most of the family purity process dependent on the wife's private observance. This is to obviously elevate the wife in the husband's eyes as being responsible and trustworthy. Imagine if the husband were commanded to oversee the process?! His OCD behavior and oversight of the wife's every move would certainly insult her and destroy the trust of the marriage! Instead, the Torah has the husband sit back and tell her that he trusts her. Now she is honored and the marriage grows.</p>\n\n<p>2) These laws were developed by men?</p>\n\n<p>R’ Zeira- <strong>B'nos Yisroel (daughters of Israel)</strong> were machmir (strict) on themselves that even if they only saw tipas dam k’chardal (a drop of blood like a mustard seed) they wait 7 nekiyim (7 clean days). (see Talmud Niddah 66a)</p>\n\n<p>The Halachic system of Israel is not the result of the dictatorship of a few men. It is the published agreement of our people as a whole. Here, the above law of family purity was passed by the women of Israel on themselves. Once they did so, all of us keep it as Law.</p>\n\n<p>3)  Mutual Responsibility?</p>\n\n<p>First of all, men abstaining is certainly a shared responsibility. But, there is also a list of laws to keep in family purity called \"Har'Chakos\". These laws involve both the man and woman learning a set of behaviors during Niddah. It is his responsibility. He also is required to learn and follow the private family calendar, as well as be involved in bringing questions to a Rav (she can too). All this must be done in cooperation. Furthermore, while she is preparing, he should be pitching in with the kids or other chores. The OP mentioned that they did not adhere to shomer negiah. Did the OP know of the laws of Har'Chakos; that during Niddah, shomer negiah and a host of other laws apply?</p>\n\n<p>4) Burden?</p>\n\n<p>This is subjective, but I would ask that anyone claiming the purification process is a burden, really sit down and think it through before making that claim. Is checking for blood a few times, counting 7 days, and grooming oneself for a bath, really called \"burdensome\"? For equality sake, we can have the husband trim his nails, take a soapy shower, and go to mikvah too in preperation to meet his wife that night. :)</p>\n\n<p>5) Long Ago?</p>\n\n<p>Why is it a problem that these laws came from long ago? If someone invented them now, would you feel that they are more authentic??!</p>\n\n<p>It has long been held by modern and non-religious communities that simply because a law is ancient, it must be wrong or changeable etc. In Judaism, we adhere to that which is authentic. So, the older its source, the better. Niddah Law is written in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>6) The OP says: \"I cannot honestly say that I keep as many mitzvot as I possibly can..\" as well as: \"...while I have to do nothing..\"</p>\n\n<p>A woman's body is so intricately involved in the mitzvah of family purity that most of the technical observance falls on her. However, men have similar things. A man puts on Talis and Tefillin on his arm and head every day and davens with a minyan. A woman does not do that. Is his praying and tefillin a one sided burden on the man? Judaism has trade offs with gender roles. However, when looking at the whole picture, it is all a shared responsibility to run a Jewish home.</p>\n\n<p>PENALTY FOR HAVING RELATIONS WHILE SHE IS NIDDAH?</p>\n\n<p>The penalty is Kar-eys (cutting off of the soul). The source is Vayikra (Levit.) 20:18. It says that both the man and woman who willfully engage in intercourse while she is a Niddah will be \"cut off\". </p>\n\n<p>Rav Saadia Gaon, Rashi, Tosefos, and others all hold that a basic aspect of Kareys is to die young (before your time). The Riva says before 50 - 60 years of age. In addition, there is a possibility of punishment in the afterlife as well.</p>\n\n<p>For an idea of how bad Kareys really is, we can look at the Talmud and see that in Tractate Kerisos 2a, there are 36 crimes in the Torah that are punishable by Kareys. </p>\n\n<p>Here are a few: Idolatry, adultery, various forms of incest, passing one's children as a sacrifice to Molech the fire god, Sabbath breaking, violating Yom Kippur, etc. Niddah is one of them.</p>\n\n<p>It should make someone take pause to consider that Niddah is in the same category as the above listed crimes.Violating Niddah Laws has the same weight as violating the other 35 listed. Wow. We need to Halachically avoid this at all cost.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it seems that in any marriage, one spouse should never tell the other spouse that they are not worth as much as an equal in the marriage. If one spouse makes more money than the other, should that spouse have a separate bank account for the extra $ to hoard it away from their partner? If I happen to cook and my spouse can't or vice versa, should the cook threaten to stop cooking because the other spouse just \"eats\" and \"consumes\"? If you have been doing this for 20 years correctly, why change it?</p>\n\n<p>Based on the OP, it seems you should go to an expert on Jewish law and mystical concepts who will help you understand the meaning behind the  Niddah status. Once you know what it is, then you are able to live by it with proper enthusiasm.</p>\n\n<p>Much Success,</p>\n\n<p>Dovid Kenner</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>You might explain it to your wife like this: </p>\n\n<p>Judaism makes the most important things in life mandatory rather than optional. It is not optional for a Jew to pray. It is not optional for him to have children. It is not optional for him to give charity, to love people, to study, to eat, to drink, to rest, to fear G-d, to remember the past, and to look every now and then at the sky above. </p>\n\n<p>For the things that would seem expendable for being overly self-indulgent--rejoicing, resting, prayer, sex--Judaism sets fixed times. We must rejoice on holidays. We must rest on Shabbos. We are commanded to meet G-d in prayer three times a day. We stop everything to do these, regardless of our schedule, our feelings, and the literally endless exigences of competing obligations. Because we stop, we do not waste our lives. The most important things in life are given their place. We use our short time on Earth wisely. </p>\n\n<p>Judaism seems to me adamant that sex with one's spouse--with its exquisite pleasure as well as its procreative potential, mystical significance and inherent holiness--is one of the essential elements of a good life. Therefore sex is on the agenda, literally. Like Shabbos, Rosh Chodesh, holidays, davening and most every other time-bound obligation in Judaism, its scheduling follows natural rhythms. In this case, the arbiter is not planetary movements, but a much smaller, though equally ecological system: the cycle of the wife's body. As with the other mitzvos, we bind the natural shifts with their meaning to us through rituals. In this case, the ritual is the wife's immersion in mikvah. After that, couples make literally every effort to ensure that the night is a special one: This most important thing in life happens, without fail.</p>\n\n<p>I wish your wife could see it this way. And perhaps your wife should visit a new mikvah every month until she finds one where the holiness is palpable to her. Maybe it is in the snow or in the ocean. Maybe the secret for her will be to escape from rules, from niggling supervision and from arbitrary social norms. Maybe she needs to see it more as connection with G-d. I am confident that once she does, she will not depart from this mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

Also, I'd rather summarize the essential points of the above, for purposes of my answer. I've pasted the entire text, in Hebrew, anyway.]</p>\n\n<p>There are 2 aspects of Yaakov's blessings. The first is that he recognized that each of his sons had his own unique special leadership qualities that should remain independent. That's an essential part of that person's soul, and in terms of a tribe, each tribe has its own \"soul\". One son had the crown of Torah; another the crown of kingdom; another has bravery; another has riches; another has success. Thus, Ya'akov blessed each one according to his own, personal blessing, e.g. the king was blessed with kingdom, the Cohen with the blessing of Priesthood.</p>\n\n<p>But, the end of the verse seems grammatically unparallel because it ends in אותם - <strong>them</strong> instead of אותו - <strong>him</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Summarizing the 2nd part of <em>Or Hachaim</em> commentary:</p>\n\n<p>Ya'akov also blessed each person that his own unique qualities would influence and help each of the other tribes. For example, the one blessed with Kingship, should be a king and have influence on all the other tribes. (My comment - after all, you can only have one king, otherwise there is chaos!)</p>\n\n<p>My own comments:</p>\n\n<p>Despite the quarreling and bickering in the desert, we see that each of the tribes marched under their own flag and banner, and every was unified. During Joshua, even after the land was apportioned, there was, for the most part, tribal unity. During the days of the Judges, yes, things declined somewhat, but for the most part, there was tribal unity esp. when it came to battles. A few tribes didn't cooperate with Devorah and Barak. And, Binaymin was almost wiped away in their civil war against the other tribes - notable exceptions. Here's where we see unity despite separate tribes</p>\n\n<p>On the reverse, special leaders emerged from various tribes. Shimshon from Dan; Barak from Re'uven, and of course, the 1st king, Saul, was from Binyamin, the smallest of the tribes in population (refer to what I stated that they were almost wiped out by the others!)</p>\n\n<p>In summary, I think that the lesson learned is that while far from a a perfect system, Ya'akov knew what he was doing and what he meant in his blessing. At the end, you and I and all of us turned out OK ;-) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Great question. I will try to offer some thoughts on this.</p>\n<p>The first point to consider is that it was not an \"accident\" that 12 tribes were born, but rather they are an expression of an aspect of the very creation itself. Rabbi Moshe Shapiro zt\"l explained that all three-dimensional reality is expressed by the number 12. The shape that best depicts this is the cube. A cube has six sides and 12 lines that hold them together. (Or fours sides that each split into three). The sides would be separate if it were not for the lines that bind them. [In fact, the 12 Gevulei Alachson [12 diagonals] as they are referred to in Kabbalah are not the 12 lines but lines that go from the middle of each line to the base or roof of another line. And they all intersect in the centre of the cube. That is the middle point or 7th side or 13th line which binds them to become something greater than the sum of their parts.] The Jewish people are also built in this way – 3 times 4. Each tribe builds in a different corner that which builds the whole house or structure.</p>\n<p>This is also apparent in the important Kabbalistic work Shaarei Orah (Fifth Gate, Sixth Sefira, 80) by Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla where he states that the four letter of Hashem’s name have twelve permutations. Each first letter has three permutations, just as each tribal flag group has three tribes, and each season (of the four) has three months within it. The letter leading the permutation (I.e. the first letter) is the force leading those months. From here he concludes that everything is dependent on the name YKVK and the form of the 12 tribes and their 4 groupings are representations of the 12 permutations of YKVK and its 4 flags.</p>\n<p>In this way, the tribes reflect a facet of the creation itself which became manifest within the Jewish people via the tribes with the function of revealing Hashem in this world.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this, consider the Midrash Bamidbar Rabbah 2:2 which states:</p>\n<p>וּבְשֵׁם אֱלֹהֵינוּ נִדְגֹּל, שֶׁקָּבַע הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא שְׁמוֹ בִּשְׁמֵנוּ וְעָשָׂה אוֹתָנוּ דְּגָלִים, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: אִישׁ עַל דִּגְלוֹ.</p>\n<p>Hashem affixed His name within ours [the Jewish people] and made us degalim [flags or formations].</p>\n<p>This is understood better with the context of the same Midrash a little further on (2:3) where it states:</p>\n<p>בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁנִּגְלָה הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא עַל הַר סִינַי יָרְדוּ עִמּוֹ כ\"ב רְבָבוֹת שֶׁל מַלְאָכִים, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (תהלים סח, יח): רֶכֶב אֱלֹהִים רִבֹּתַיִם אַלְפֵי שִׁנְאָן, וְהָיוּ כֻלָּם עֲשׂוּיִם דְּגָלִים דְּגָלִים, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שיר השירים ה, י): דָּגוּל מֵרְבָבָה, כֵּיוָן שֶׁרָאוּ אוֹתָן יִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁהֵם עֲשׂוּיִם דְּגָלִים דְּגָלִים, הִתְחִילוּ מִתְאַוִּים לִדְגָלִים, אָמְרוּ אַלְוַאי כָּךְ אָנוּ נַעֲשִׂים דְּגָלִים כְּמוֹתָן, לְכָךְ נֶאֱמַר: הֱבִיאַנִי אֶל בֵּית הַיָּיִן, זֶה סִינַי שֶׁנִּתְּנָה בּוֹ הַתּוֹרָה שֶׁנִּמְשְׁלָה בַּיַּיִן (משלי ט, ה):</p>\n<p>Loose translation: At the moment when Hashem revealed Himself at Mount Sinai, 22,000 angels came down with Him and they were all standing in formation [degalim]. When the Jewish people saw them standing in formation [revealing the Glory of Hashem] they began to desire also having a formation, and asked to be given a formation too.</p>\n<p>Additionally, each of the four camps represent a different letter of Hashem’s name - so the formation of Klal Yisrael each standing in their allotted place - was effectively spelling out Hashem’s name in this world. In other words, through the degalim (formation of the twelve different tribes) we create a merkava where the shechina rests. It is how we brought Hashem into the world.</p>\n<p>Can also see the Ibn Ezra on Numbers 2:2 who shows how the four groupings of the tribes reflect the four parts to the Divine Throne.</p>\n<p>באתת. סימנים היו בכל דגל ודגל וקדמונינו אמרו שהיה בדגל ראובן צורת אדם מכח דרש דודאים ובדגל יהודה צורת אריה כי בו המשילו יעקב ובדגל אפרים צורת שור מטעם בכור שור ובדגל דן צורת נשר עד שידמו לכרובים שראה יחזקאל הנביא</p>\n<p>See also Chizkuni and Rabbeinu Bachaye on Numbers 2:2.</p>\n<p>Regarding you second question, of whether it would have been better to have just one people without tribes - I believe the answer is that it is specifically through the achdus (unity) of the different tribes, that we reveal a unity of God.</p>\n<p>Consider, for example, the opinion of Rebbe Nachman (Likutei Halachot, Yoreh Deah, Laws of Mixed Breeding, 4:16:1):</p>\n<p>וְאֵלּוּ הָאַרְבָּעָה דְּגָלִים הָיוּ הוֹלְכִים סְבִיב הַמִּשְׁכָּן וְהָאָרוֹן שֶׁשָּׁם הַלּוּחוֹת שֶׁהֵם מְגַלִּין יִחוּדוֹ וְאַחְדוּתוֹ יִתְבָּרַךְ. כְּמוֹ שֶׁכָּתוּב שָׁם, אָנֹכִי ה' אֱלֹקֶיךָ וְכוּ', הַיְנוּ לְהוֹרוֹת שֶׁכָּל הַשְּׁנֵים עָשָׂר שְׁבָטִים שֶׁכְּלוּלִים מֵאַרְבָּעָה דְּגָלִים שֶׁנֶּחֱלָקִים לְשִׁנּוּי דֵּעוֹת הַרְבֵּה, כִּי הֵם שִׁשִּׁים רִבּוֹא נְפָשׁוֹת שֶׁכָּל אֶחָד יֵשׁ לוֹ דֵּעָה מְשֻׁנָּה מֵחֲבֵרוֹ וְאַף-עַל-פִּי-כֵן כָּל אֵלּוּ הַשִּׁנּוּי דֵּעוֹת שֶׁהֵם בְּחִינַת פְּעֻלּוֹת מִשְׁתַּנּוֹת כֻּלָּם כְּלוּלִים בְּדֵעָה אַחַת כְּאִלּוּ הָיוּ נֶפֶשׁ אַחַת מַמָּשׁ, כִּי כֻּלָּם מַאֲמִינִים בְּלֵב אֶחָד בַּה' אֶחָד שֶׁכָּל הַפְּעֻלּוֹת מִשְׁתַּנּוֹת נִמְשָׁכִין מִמֶּנּוּ יִתְבָּרַךְ כַּנַּ\"ל</p>\n<p>And these four degalim (camps/formations) went around the Mishkan and the Aron, which contained the Luchos (Tablets), which reveal the Oneness and unity of Hashem. As it says there (on the Tablets) “I am the Lord your God”. To teach us that all the twelve tribes, which are composed of the four degalim (formations), which are split into many different opinions, which are the 600,000 souls, every one of which has his own opinion which is different to his friend, and even so, all these different opinions which are different ways to operate, all of them are included in one opinion, as though they were one soul, as they all believe with one heart in the One God, that all the different ways to operate are drawn from Him.</p>\n<p>In other words, the twelve tribes - despite their differences - are themselves a revelation of the unity of God.</p>\n<p>The purpose of having twelve tribes is to demonstrate to the world the ability to have unity even within the diversity. The tribes of Israel were a microcosm of how the whole world could operate as a unity within diversity.</p>\n<p>In summary, I believe your second question - in a way - answers your first. You are correct to suggest the Jewish people need unity. The question implies that unity would be best achieved if there were no tribes. I would humbly suggest that this is a false assumption. Unity of God is best expressed through the coming together of different aspects of creation, and in particular through the different aspects within the Jewish people (i.e. the twelve tribes). That said, it answers your first question of why the tribes needed to be divided into separate portions of the land and why the sea split for them into twelve pathways, because the unity of faith and purpose of the twelve tribes is itself the greatest revelation of God’s unity in this world.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While it might sound counter-intuitive at first, being just one big people would have an adverse affect on unity. You are much more connected when there are limbs, branches and twigs that reach you, more than being just another sheep in the herd.</p>\n\n\n",

It is just best to make sure that the body is buried in the white garment called a \"Shroud.\" I'm not sure of many laws regarding the creation of a Jewish graveyard, but According to Jewish law, a Jew should be buried among Jews. It is forbidden for a Jew to be buried in a mixed- denomination cemetery, or in a cemetery that allows the burial of questionably converted Jews. A proper Jewish grave is one in which the casket is laid directly in the ground, and covered with earth/dirt until it is full and a small mound is formed on top. The grave should be at least forty inches deep, and wide and long enough for the casket.\nAbove-ground burial, though, is strictly forbidden according to Jewish law, and Kabbalah adds that all alternative burial options interfere severely with the eternal rest of the soul. Then, of course, there is the tombstone. The tombstone is usually placed at the head of the grave, and the plot outlined with a low lying frame. The tombstone should be made from stone or granite and similar to those around it. It is customary to then engrave the Hebrew name of the deceased and his or her father's name, as well as the Hebrew date and year of passing on the tombstone. On all tombstones one adds the Hebrew letters תנצב''ה, which in acrostic form means \"May his (her) soul be bound in the binding of life.\" Others write on the heading פ\"נ , which means \"Here is buried.\" Carving or engraving the form of a human being on the tombstone and mounting any pictures is forbidden. And also one should avoid writing the persons qualities and such. Hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n",

Of course, this would mainly be relevant in a society in which expensive and effective healthcare is available for purchase (i.e. modern times) and not automatically, universally paid for by the government (e.g. in the United States, and to varying degrees, many other countries).</p>\n<p>(Hat tip for the question to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wfriedman/posts/10152895488258510\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">William Friedman</a>.)</p>\n<p><sup>Related questions:<br />\n<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/33572/is-a-person-obligated-to-purchase-life-insurance\">Is a person obligated to purchase life insurance?</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/3057/does-the-existence-of-insurance-affect-end-of-life-halacha\">Does the existence of insurance affect end-of-life Halacha?</a> </sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Shlomo Amar (the previous Sefardi chief Rabbi of Israel) wrote a p'sak (pictured below) allowing people who couldn't otherwise afford health insurance, to use \"ma'aser money\" to pay for it. (He mentions specifically health insurance that pays for \"special surgeries\", though this may be because basic health insurance is free in Israel.) He also says that people who can afford health insurance should use their money to pay for others' health insurance.</p>\n<p>This already suggests that Rabbi Amar supported having health insurance. However, there is another part of his p'sak which is possibly even more direct:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה תוכנית זו שיש בה להבטיח משפחות רבות ממצבים קשים שלא יכולים לקבל טיפולים רפואיים בעתות בצרה שלא תבוא ולא תהיה ח\"ו, ובימינו כבר התפשט בכל העולם לעשות ביטוח רפואי, והיא השתדלות נכונה ומבורכת.</p>\n<p>(Loosely): And this program can insure many families in hard financial situations, who cannot afford healthcare in times of need and nowadays it is common everywhere to have health insurance, and this is a correct and blessed endeavour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not completely sure whether the endeavour he's referring to is people having health insurance, or this program which uses ma'aser money to pay for people's health insurance, but either way we see clearly that Rabbi Amar at least supported getting health insurance in cases where one wouldn't be able to pay the medical bills out of pocket. (It doesn't seem that he obligated having health insurance, as in that case he would presumably obligate people to use their ma'aser money to pay for it, if they have no other way to pay for it.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GO7kg9QE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GO7kg9QE.png\" alt=\"Rabbi Amar's tshuva\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

I don't know if Iyyar happens to be a name of a foreign god, but maybe you could look into that.

Therefore, if that 1 person maid a zimun anyway, it's as if he accomplished nothing. And if the other 2 didn't want to stop eating, it is not appropriate for him to bentch and go to the market, because (since he is sitting with 3 people,) he is required in zimun, and how can he bentch without a zimun?</p>\n\n<p>I infer that was is stated with 1 person vs. 2 is similar to what would happen with 1 vs. 9. I also inferred from your description, that the other 9 didn't stop eating, either. Therefore, it seems that the person \"forced\" his zimun, and bentched without an appropriate zimun (it is as if he did nothing). The others that answered him anyway, seemed to have accomplished nothing at all, as it seems to be an \"inappropriate\" zimun.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the other 9 should answer regularly at the \"second\" zimun, when the majority of people agree to complete the meal.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does the order of temple services in our prayers follow the non-hallachic opinion?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Something that has bothered me for a long time, and I have not found a good explanation for, is why we recite the order of service in the temple following Abbaye in the name of Abba Shaul, despite the fact that the hallacha clearly doesn't follow his opinion. Namely, Abba Shaul's position in Yoma 33a is that the blood of the sacrifice is offered on the altar between the five candles and the two candles, whereas the opinion of the sages is that it is the offering of the incence which interrupts between these two services.</p>\n\n<p>Hallacha (e.g. the Rambam) follows the sages (and yachid verabim hallacha kerabim), but we still recite Abbaye in the name of Abba Shaul, which is the non-accepted opinion. Given that the purpose of reciting the sacrifices is to recall the way things were performed in the Temple, this seems particularly strange. It seems almost to undermine the whole rationale of reciting korbanos.</p>\n\n<p>Why do we recite the order of temple services according to the non-hallachic opinion? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Beis Yosef (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x132\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 48:1 s.v. ויש נהגין</a>) asks this question, and answers essentially that \"the world\" sees that Abaya holds the Halacha is like Abba Shaul, and didn't want to change his order.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%91_%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%99_%D7%96%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Chaim Zilberberg</a> writes in his sefer, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31829&st=&pgnum=10&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Darchei Chaim</a> that he and his father would add in the opinion of the Rabbanan that argue with Abba Shaul in their own custom nusach.</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe (Sefer Hasichos 5752 p. 418ff.) explains the common practice of saying the order according to Abba Shaul during the year, but using the order of the Rabbanan on Yom Kippur in spiritual terms. The difference between Abba Shaul and the Rabbanan is whether or not bringing the Ketores is a preparation for lighting the last two candles of the Menorah. Ketores represents the inner soul which is always connected to G-d. But during a time of exile (represented in both Abbaya's name - as he was an orphan - and Abba Shaul - one has to \"borrow\" so to speak, as one's Father is in a distant place) this inner soul doesn't find expression in matters that engage the world (represented by the Menorah that gives testimony to the world - <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=22b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud Shabbos 22b</a>). However on Yom Kippur, the inner soul is expressed, as it will be in the Beis Hamikdash, so the Halacha (as paskened in the Rambam and the Smag) is like the Rabbanan that the Ketores is a preparation for lighting the last two lights of the Menorah.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/9I8DP.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of relevant page in Sefer HaSichos\" title=\"Picture of relevant page in Sefer HaSichos as it is not available online.\"></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Exploring further, I have just found <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol13Zelcer.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">the following hakirah</a> by Hercey Zelcer, which expands on the answers suggested by Danno and by Gershon Gold in the comments. I'll post the briefest of summaries here, according to my understanding.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Eshkol (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_Isaac_of_Narbonne\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Abraham ben Isaac of Narbonne</a>), the reason we recite this passage is because it is a concise review of all temple services. Rabbeinu Bahaye tells us it is based on a Beraisa, which we know from other sources also, although our prayer book text differs from the text of the Beraisa and from the text in the Gemara in various interesting ways. These ways are designed to put us in the proper mood of the Temple Avoda, fulfilling the directive in Menachos 110a that one who involves themselves in the study of the sacrifices, it is as if they offered those sacrifices.</p>\n\n<p>But, if we're already modifying texts, why not modify it to follow the hallacha? Yishai gives what I think is a great answer; Rabbi Yosef Shamshi, the Eshkol, and others give a different answer, that \"it doesn't matter\", perhaps because the atmosphere and the fact that we are digging up a Beraisa is the important thing. Perhaps I can understand Rabbi Shamshi as saying that it's davka because it's non-hallachic that we are doing pure \"Torah study\" here; but that's pure speculation on my part.</p>\n\n\n",

Rashi explains that this refers to one who\n“desecrates Chol Hamoed through doing work or treating it as a normal\nweekday with respect to eating and drinking. Because it is not as\nstringent as Yom Tov he does not take care to keep it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It suggests the reason for the stringency is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps Rashi limits the Mishna to Chol Hamoed because he takes the\nposition, that while Shabbat and Yom Tov are holy (and might be\nincluded in the first item in the list, המחלל את הקדשים), Chol Hamoed\nis raised up “Chol”.

Currently leading in the voting is a transgender person who was assumed to be of female gender at birth, but has since transitioned and identifies as male. There is a picture circulating of this person without a shirt. The person looks very much like a (very muscular) man, even with facial hair. So my question is, would looking at this person's male-looking chest constitute viewing <em>erva</em>?</p>\n\n<p>That is, for the purpose of technical prohibitions involved with observing <em>erva</em>, does this person's body count as a female erva or not? This is a particular detail of a more general <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34058/how-is-gender-halachically-determined\">question</a> about how Jewish law views the gender of a transgender individual, and it may well be distinct from other considerations, since it specifically concerns the body itself and observation thereof by others.</p>\n\n<p>As a tack-on to this question, would looking at the chest of a person who was formerly considered male but transitioned and is now considered female be considered viewing <em>erva</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Berachos 24a, which states that \"tefach b'isha erva\" (a handsbreath of uncovered skin of a woman is \"erva\"), explains that where one is not intending to derive pleasure, a woman's skin is erva if a tefach is uncovered in a place that is normally covered, for the purposes of davening in front of it.  Meaning you cannot daven in front of a tefach of uncovered skin even if you are not intending to derive any pleasure (or even if it is your wife's skin where pleasure is permitted). Because, this rule of erva is arguably not dependent on its ability to cause pleasure (an argument can be made otherwise), I could hear that uncovered skin of a transgender man (i.e. born female) would still be problematic.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the Gemara also states that כל המסתכל באצבע קטנה של אשה כאילו מסתכל במקום החורף. Histaklus is explained by the Tzlach (aka the Noda BeYehuda) and others as meaning gazing to derive pleasure. Therefore if one is gazing at a woman's skin, even her little finger, with intent to derive pleasure there would be an issur.  </p>\n\n<p>I would submit that in this case, there is no intent to derive pleasure (because the person does not appear to be female) and therefore there is no issur of histaklus.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>First off, if you paint a house to look like a castle, it's still a house. I don't see why a woman believing herself to be a man and altering her body would halachically change that.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not it is erva, most authorities prohibit gazing at any skin of the torso and thighs that is more than a tefach, even if you're in a culture where women wear less clothes and those areas are not considered erotic. The back of a woman, for example, which looks as ordinariy as the back of a man, may not be looked at by a man, no sexual arousal needed. So the altered chest of a woman is also a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding a man who makes himself look like a woman, there may be a different prohibition of impure thoughts for looking at him if someone would actually find that attractive. But it would be more like looking at a nude painting as a puffed up man's chest is just a man's chest that's puffed up.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why not two days of Rosh Hodesh, as we have two days of yontif?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The reason for two days of yontif (outside Israel) is based on uncertainty about the date due to distance from Jerusalem and time needed to travel to convey the news of when the month started. The reason we have two-day Rosh Hodesh is explained <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11632\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What puzzles me is why we do not have two days of Rosh Hodesh for the same reason as we have two days of yontif. Why doesn't the reasoning for two-day yontifs apply to Rosh Hodesh (yielding a two-day Rosh Hodesh <em>every</em> month)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I am excerpting parts of Ramba\"m, Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh, as I believe are relevant to your question. In summary, the 2 day Yom Tov was based on the distance that messangers could travel within the first 10 days of the month (based on # of allowable travel days for Tishrei. It seems that calculation of the 1st day of Succot was most important. Rosh Hashanna had already been established as 2 days even in Israel, according to most opinions. Yom Kippur, I think, was made 1 day even in Galut b/c of the danger of fasting 2 days - have to check this further.) as well as the establishment of Jews in that village during time of Sanhedrin. Now, the two day celebration is based on following the previous custom and according to Ramab\"m is <em>takanat sofrim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As you already saw, the doubt of Rosh Hodesh is different, as even those in Israel weren't sure, so potentially, <strong>every</strong> month could have  days Rosh Hodesh. It didn't happen that way, but I believe there were times when you had 2 consecutive months with 2 days Rosh Hodesh, depending on when witnesses appeared. While Ramba\"m doesn't outrightly state this, I infer that those in the far distances who had the doubt of having to observe 2 days Yom Tov, also observed 2 days Rosh Hodesh <strong>every</strong> month. (Would appreciate if someone could confirm or refute this.</p>\n\n<p>Mishneh Torah, Sanctification of the New Month 3:11-12:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every place that the messengers reach, they'd make the festivals a one\n  day holiday as is written in the Torah. And the distant places that\n  the messengers wouldn't reach would make two days because of the\n  doubt, for they wouldn't know which day was the day that the court\n  fixed the first of the month.  There are places that the messengers of\n  Nissan would reach them and the messengers of Tishri would not reach\n  them. And according to the law, they ought to make Passover one day of\n  holiday, for the messengers reached them and they knew on which day\n  the first of the month was fixed. And they ought to make the holiday\n  of the festival of Tabernacles two days, for the messengers didn't\n  reach them. And in order not to distinguish between the festivals, the\n  sages amended that any place that the messengers of Tishri didn't\n  reach would make two days [of holidays], even the holiday of Ceasing\n  (Shavuot).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mishneh Torah, Sanctification of the New Month 3:13:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And how much is between the messengers of Tishri and the messengers of\n  Nissan? Two days. For the messengers of Tishri didn't travel on the\n  1st of Tishri because it is a holiday and not on the 10th of it\n  because it is the Day of Atonement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mishneh Torah, Sanctification of the New Month 5:12: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A place that has between it and between Jerusalem 10 days or less than\n  10, and it is [in] Syria or the outside of the land [of Israel], and\n  they don't have a custom. Or it is a newly formed city in the desert\n  of the land of Israel. Or a place that [people of] Israel dwells now.\n  They make two days like the custom of the majority of the world. And\n  every second day holiday is from the words of the scribes and even the\n  second day of the holiday of Rosh Hashanah which everyone makes at\n  this time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rmaba\"m's discussion is mainly in chapters 4 and 5, and, to get a better perspective, you should read the majority of these chapters. The English translation was copied from sefaria.org.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, we aim to get 1 day for both. Rosh Hodesh has its \"internal\" problem both because of the moons orbit which is not a full day, and when witnesses appear. However, once we know when Rosh Hodesh <strong>really</strong> was, we can't correct time that already passed (i.e. we can't \"correct\" Rosh Hodesh itself If people already observed the 1st day, and it was a 30 day but it really was 29.) However, once we know which day really was Rosh Hodesh, we attempt to inform people of that, afterwards. But, there is only so much time and distance that messengers can travel, so they are ALWAYS doubtful.</p>\n\n<p>There is a separate discussion in Ramba\"m in ch. 5, I believe that discusses if the date of Rosh Hodesh can be \"reverted\" retroactively. See there. It's somewhat tangential to answering this question, and I didn't want to cite from it, here.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>every rosh hashana was 2 days for almost everybody for reason see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/947922/jewish/Kiddush-HaChodesh-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam kidush hachodesh 5 law 7-8</a> (in short: even if the witnesses came on the first (30th) day the court did not send messengers until after the first day was over (only jesuralem knew about it))</p>\n<p><strong>from there it seems that since rosh chodesh was not yomtov so they sent the messengers on the day of rosh chodesh (so more of israel knew about it (that rosh chodesh was only on the 30th day) not only jerusalem)</strong></p>\n<p>so the question is not why not have all rosh chodesh 2 days, but why now that we use a set calendar do we have 2 days rosh hodesh</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/947926/jewish/Kiddush-HaChodesh-Chapter-Eight.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam - Kiddush HaChodesh - Chapter Eight - Halacha 4</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to this reckoning, the thirtieth day of the month is always established as Rosh Chodesh.

    "content": "# Channukah and Bal Tosif\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are questions on the site which deal with saying <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/1512/2699\">Hallel on Channukah</a> but my question seeks a more fundamental insight:</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban writes on Devarim 4:2 that a violation of Bal Tosif is creating a new holiday (like Yeravam did in Melachim I 12:32-33). The Ramban goes on to explain that Purim does not violate Bal Tosif for there were 180 Neviim who instituted the holiday. The Ramban, however, does not mention the basis for Channukah. Why doesn't Channukah violate Bal Tosif?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>First, a correction to the question. The Ramban does not say that Megillah is not a problem because it was instituted by nevi'im, rather he says that it is not a problem because a source was found within the Torah. See Ramban's hasagot to Sefer Hamitzvot, Shoresh 2: </p>\n\n<p>וכבר אמרו(מגלה יד.) ״ארבעים ושמונה נביאים ושבע נביאות עמדו להם לישראל לא פיחתו ולא הותירו על מה שכתוב בתורה אפילו אות אחת חוץ ממקרא מגלה. מאי דרוש? א״ר חייא בר אבין משום ר' יהושע בן קרחה קל וחומר ומה מעבדות לחירות אמרו שירה, ממות לחיים לא כל שכן״. למדו אותנו בזה כי כל התקנות והגזירות אינן תוספת אבל הן גדר וסייג לתורה, אבל מקרא מגלה היא תוספת, לפי שנכתבה [ב]תורה, והוקבעה חובה לדורות, אלא שסמכו על חיובה בקל וחומר הזה ועל כתיבתה מן הרמז שמצאו כתוב זאת זכרון בספר.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Ramban, megillah would have been an addition because it was written in the Torah (or like the Torah was written, depending on the girsa in the Ramban), and because it was established as a permanent mitzvah. R. Meir Dan Plotzki, in his Kli Chemdah to Devarim (p. 11) explains that megillah is a unique problem because it was established as an eternal holiday from the start. (See the Rambam at the end of Hilchot Megillah, 2:18.) This makes Megillah different from Chanukah. As for the writing of the Megillah, the Ramban seems to suggest that this is unique as well because it is a permanent part of the canon. See Rambam ibid., and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=48095&st=&pgnum=140\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masat Hamelech al ha-Moadim, no. 48</a>. Again, Chanukah does not share this problem at all. </p>\n\n<p>Another approach, which is the approach of the Mabit in his Kiryat Sefer to Hilchot Chanukah as well as R. Chaim Volozhiner in his Nefesh HaChaim 1:22, explains that Chanukah is alluded to in the Torah as well, as the Ramban himself explains in the beginning of Parashat Beha'alotecha. If so, Chanukah is not a problematic addition for the same reason as Megillah, because both have allusions to their creation in the Torah itself. </p>\n\n<p>For more about this question, see <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/777976/Eliyahu_Krakowski/%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%90_%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%99_%D7%9C%D7%9A_%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D-_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90_%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%99_%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9_%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Nathaniel Helfgot <a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/vbm/english/chanuka/chanuka.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> that the Ramban is only bothered by Purim because it was an institution of the Nevi'im - prophets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What does Rashi mean? A simple understanding of his words would seem to indicate that he doesn't believe that Chanuka presents a problem, since its source is not a takanat nevi'im. Only a mitzva which is introduced as falling under the category of divrei kabbala has the potential of conflicting with the principle of bal tosif. A mitzva instituted with ruach ha-kodesh, and included in the kitvei ha- kodesh, can \"compete\" - if we may use such an expression - with the status of the 613 mitzvot as a complete and unalterable unit. A regular mitzva de-rabanan could not and cannot present any such competition, since it lacks the characteristics of a 'mitzva on the same level as a de-oraita'. Hence Chazal only felt the need to solve the 'problem' of the bal tosif of Purim, while seeing no reason to raise the problem at all with regard to Chanuka.</p>\n<p>If this is the case, then the first difference which we have discovered between Chanuka and Purim involves solving the problem of bal tosif. Purim, which falls under the category of divrei kabbala, requires a solution while Chanuka, which is a regular de-rabanan, requires no special heter for its institution and mitzvot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The talmud, on Niddah 31b, explains that the sin-offering (<em>chatat</em>) after birth is to atone for inappropriate vows she might have made during the birth.  (Remember, no drugs to dull the pain.)  From the Soncino translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Simeon b. Yohai was asked by his disciples: Why did the Torah ordain that a woman after childbirth should bring a sacrifice? He replied: When she kneels in bearing she swears impetuously that she will have no intercourse with her husband. The Torah, therefore, ordained that she should bring a sacrifice. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It sounds like the g'mara is saying that this is true of all women in childbirth.  It goes on to bring a contrary opinion about the absolution of vows; this is not resolved.</p>\n\n<p>The following is my own reasoning: As a practical matter, the g'mara I quoted could also be a \"just in case\" measure -- we should not assume that the woman will remember having said this in the midst of her pain and there may not be two valid witnesses present, so if the torah did not specify this offering she might end up with a transgression for which she has not brought an offering.  Rather than inviting that possibility, the torah might be calling for the <em>chatat</em> as a precaution.</p>\n\n<p>All that said, I find this explanation somewhat unsatisfying, and you should go read <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/57518/472\">this answer bringing R' Hirsch</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In  his commentary on <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.4.2?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 4:2</a>, where the Torah introduces the קרבן חטאת (\"sin offering\"), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Samson Raphael Hirsch</a> explains its purpose with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The offering, with which a soul that has fallen out of focus of the Will of God which should form the centre which directs all its actions, seeks to regain the nearness of God, is called a קרבן חטאת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The essential aspect is the return from falling out of focus, not \"sin,\" per se. You can see this from the fact that the Red Heifer is also called a \"חטאת\" (e.g. in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.19.9?lang=he-en&sidebarLang=all&layout=heLeft\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 19:9</a>), despite the fact that it is used to recover from טומאה (moral depression, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/57514/2\">according to R' Hirsch</a>) from contact with death, not from sin.</p>\n\n<p>According to R' Hirsch, טומאה is a mental condition that would prevent a person from participating in holy practices with the correct mindset. In particular, many types of טומאה  cause this problem by afflicting a person with the illusion that people are trapped by the physical world and have no genuine free will. One can't participate in the holy service, in which one dedicates some aspect of oneself to God, without a complete sense that one is approaching God out of free choice.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, according to R' Hirsch in his commentary on <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.12.6?lang=he-en&sidebarLang=all&layout=heLeft\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 12:6</a>, the חטאת brought by the new mother helps her refocus following <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/7535/2\">טומאה</a>, not sin. As he explains in his commentary on the previous verse, in the process of giving birth, a woman necessarily surrenders to the overwhelming physical process and thus is intimately subject to the illusion that she is an unfree object of natural forces rather than the holy, volitional being that she is. So, on 12:6, he explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That is why she first vows in her חטאת העוף, that she will not allow her power to determine her own actions in all moral matters to be broken by the painful days which are inseparable from her high calling in life; but rather, by undertaking and enduring such days of suffering in the spirit of duty, for the sake of fulfilling her high mission in life, she exercises her power of free will even in this, and so transforms the passiveness of pain itself into active moral energy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><sup><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0910818126\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaac Levy translation</a></sup></p>\n\n\n",

If G’d had opened the serpent’s mouth by means of a miracle,\nas He did when Bileam’s ass started speaking to him (Numbers 22,28),\nwhy did the Torah not report, as it did in that verse that “G’d opened\nthe mouth of the serpent?”</p>\n<p>The scholar Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra writes that the serpent\ndid indeed speak, and it used to walk upright, just like man.\nOriginally, G’d had equipped the serpent with superior knowledge and\nintelligence, i.e. “more crafty than any of the beasts of the field,\nbut not as crafty as man.” this was also the opinion of our sages\n(Bereshit Rabbah 20,5) This is what they write: At the time G’d\npunished the serpent, He said to it: “here I had made you so that you\nare king of the all the beasts, something that you had not been\nsatisfied with. I enabled you to walk upright just like man. You were\nnot satisfied with this either. Now you will have to crawl on your\nbelly and eat dust.” We must ask ourselves that if all this is so, why\nthe Torah had not mentioned that the serpent had enjoyed such\ndistinctions, that the Torah’s report of G’d’s creative activities\nmakes no mention of this, as it did in Genesis 1,26 when man’s\ndistinction over the other creatures is introduced by G’d saying “we\nwill make him in our image, etc?” Furthermore, when G’d cursed the\nserpent, mention is meant of it having to crawl and having to eat\ndust. Why did the Torah not also mention that G’d deprived it of its\nsuperior intellect? This would have been the most severe part of the\npunishment and the Torah does not mention it at all? The most likely\nanswer to all the points that we have raised is that the serpent was\nenabled, -miraculously,- on that occasion, to speak in a voice and\nlanguage Chavah could understand, even though the Torah did not write\nspecifically that “G’d opened its mouth,” as it did in connection with\nBileam. seeing that this represented something far more extraordinary\n[Bileam’s ass speaking, which occurred in a world that was post Gan\nEden, as opposed to an idyllic world where such miracles were not out\nof the ordinary. Besides, Bileam’s ass had saved her master from death\nby opening her mouth, whereas the serpent’s speaking had led to\nChavah’s and her husband’s eventual death. Ed.]<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Both approaches are legitimate and have roots in Orthodox litterateur.</p>\n\n<p>Usually we refrain from interpreting the Torah as <strong>only</strong> a metaphor (see Rabad on Hilchot Melachim 12:1 and the Mirkavat Mishne there) , while in some cases we <strong>most</strong> understand the Torah in a metaphorical way (such as Deut. 10:16 \"ומלתם את ערלת לבבכם וערפכם לא תקשו עוד\"). However, interpreting an entire story is more problematic, and one shouldn't do it unless he finds it impossible to understand the story as it is.</p>\n\n<p>The idea that interpreting certain parts of the Torah as metaphors is more problematic then interpreting prophecies (the dry bones prophecy) or certain books (Job and Shir HaShirim) as metaphors is explained by the Abarbanel in his commentary on Genesis 2:4 he states the main differences are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Claiming an entire book is a metaphor is easier than saying that certain bits and parts of a book are a metaphor, since then you have to decide which parts are to be taken literally and which not.</p></li>\n<li><p>Understanding dreams and prophecies as metaphors is easier and less problematic then interpreting stories that are documented and written its actual historical events as metaphors. Because then who can tell when it will stop? what prevents us from saying that King David, the Avot, even the story of the Exodus are metaphors?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This leads the Abarbanel to claim that even when the Rambam interpreted certain stories as metaphors, he did it only when he found it absolutely necessary. It should be pointed out that the Rambams interpretation of the story of Sodom as a prophecy or a dream, as he did with every story that involves angels, was not viewed as legitimate by all of the Rishonim. The Ramban even went as far as claiming (Gen. 18:1) that it is forbidden to read or believe in such ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Rambams view is a legitimate Jewish view, which many Orthodox rabbis and sages have taken.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that if you understand the story literally you will learn a lot and will benefit, and if you want you can look at our different Rabbis interpretations to the story and learn as well.</p>\n\n<p>אלה ואלה דברי אלוהים חיים</p>\n\n<p>If you want, here is an article by (my grandfather, so I'm not exactly objective ;)) Rabbi Schubert Spero on the subject: <a href=\"http://www.lookstein.org/articles/history_or_metaphor.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Biblical Stories of Creation, Garden of Eden and the Flood: History or Metaphor? - Shubert Spero</a></p>\n\n\n",

If one didn’t have kavana even in the first Bracha according\n  to the strict law one is obligated to return to the beginning of\n  Shemonah Esrei. However, nowadays if one did not have kavana one\n  should not return to the beginning of Shemonah Esrei.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The footnote reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Tur 101:1 writes that nowadays if one didn’t have kavana in the\n  first Bracha of Shemonah Esrei one shouldn’t have to return to the\n  beginning because once one didn’t have kavana the first time there’s\n  no guarantee that one is going to be successful the next time. This is\n  the ruling of the Rama 101:1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question is:\nWhere there is a reason to think that the circumstances are that he <strong>will be able to concentrate better the second time</strong> (because whatever was disturbing him has stopped), is he permitted or even obliged to repeat if he did not have kavana in the first prayer?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In orach chaim (96:1), the shulchan aruch says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כשהוא מתפלל לא יאחז בידו תפילין ולא ספר מכתבי הקודש ולא קערה מלאה ולא סכין ומעות וככר מפני שלבו עליהם שלא יפלו ויטרד ותתבטל כונתו</p>\n<p>When he is praying, he should hold neither tefillin, nor any of the holy books, nor a full bowl, money, or bread, because he is paying attention to them so they don't fall, and he will be occupied and will not concentrate (on his prayer).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mishna berura (s\"k 2) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא יאחז וכו': ובדיעבד אין צריך לחזור ולהתפלל אם לא שיודע שעל ידי זה לא כון ב\"אבות\"</p>\n<p>He shouldn't hold etc.: If he did hold these things, he needs not repeat his prayer, unless he knows that because of this he didn't concentrate in \"Avos\" [the first bracha, which is the bare minimum concentration necessary to fulfill praying with concentration, per OC 101:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Sha'ar Hatziun there, he adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונראה לי דבזה יחזור אף בזמננו שאם לא יאחזם יכון</p>\n<p>And it seems to me that in this (case), he should repeat the prayer even nowadays, since if he doesn't hold these things, he will concentrate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see that if some outside force caused someone who generally concentrates in the first bracha to not concentrate at all, he should repeat his prayer even nowadays.

    "content": "# Is Transcendental Meditation kosher?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Transcendental Meditation is a popular form of meditation that, many practitioners claim, relieves psychological stress. Although it was founded an Indian guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, it is not at all clear what, if any, religious qualities there are to the practice. </p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.truthabouttm.org/truth/individualeffects/istmareligion/index.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">site</a>, for example, claims the following: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The practice of the program involves no religious beliefs but is a mechanical and effortless technique for experiencing increasingly refined or restful levels of mental and physiological activity enjoyed by individuals of all religious (and non-religious) backgrounds. [...] The practice of the Transcendental Meditation program does not involve contemplation about any religious or secular ideas, nor does it involve concentration, which is characteristic of some religious practices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am not familiar with the practice itself. All that I have seen in rabbinic literature is a reference by R. Aryeh Kaplan in an article, \"Davening with Kavana.\" In it, he mentions a girl who has been practicing TM by repeating a mantra and writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To be sure, TM, which is a type of <em>avodah zarah</em> (idolatry), bears absolutely no relationship to <em>davening</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can one practice TM without saying a mantra? If one were seeking a method to relieve stress, what exactly are the halakhic issues with practicing TM?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To my knowledge, meditation is of not focusing on anything but the breath.\nyou are literally taking control of your mind by just focusing on the breath and the breath itself. the whole Mantra thing is misleading and not the right way. \nWhy should there be an <em>issur</em> to do this. If anything, practicing self awareness (meditation)\ncan strengthen your brain and tune your body. And by doing this you are keeping your mind healthy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are about twelve mantras in TM. An initiate is given one of them during a TM ceremony. I understand that each of the mantras represents an Indian God. Although I'm not Jewish, I don't think TM is kosher for Jews or Christians who are against idoltary.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Many practices are called meditation, but two types have been repeatedly validated by research: self-transcending meditation, and minfulness meditation. They both originated in the context of eastern religions, but are mental techniques without any religious component. Nonetheless, they are likely to enhance the experience of your own religion or philosophy. </p>\n\n<p>Readily available versions of self-transcending meditation are TM (Transcendental Meditation) and NSR (Natural Stress Reduction). These use effortless repetition of a mantra (mental syllables without meaning) as vehicles for experiencing mental-physiological states of restful alertness and pure consciousness (traditionally called dhyana and samadhi). </p>\n\n<p>Readily available versions of mindfulness meditation are MBSR (Mindfullness Based Stress Refuction) and Vipassana Meditation. These use effortless attention to breathing or scanning one’s body sensations as vehicles to states of broadened awareness and detachment from the ever-changing conditions of life (referred to in different schools as dhyana /jhana and satori).</p>\n\n<p>As an observant Jew, I have practiced both forms of meditation for many years. I am a doctor of psychology, and a certified instructor of meditation and yoga with over 40 years teaching these techniques in TM centers, schools, and clinical settings. In my experience, the most important aspect of both types of meditation is that they teach one to gently attend to a simple mental vehicle (e.g. mantra, breath, or rhythmic motions) while allowing other thoughts and perceptions to come and go. </p>\n\n<p>None of these methods aim to make the mind go blank, nor treat thoughts, noises, and sensations as distractions. They are accepted as a natural, even beneficial part of the meditation. When you notice them, you accept them as passing thoughts, and gently shift attention back to the mental vehicle (mantra, breath, etc). This shifting of attention between the vehicle and other thoughts can easily happen many times in a single 20-minute session of meditation.  Additionally, one doesn’t try to control how the vehicle (mantra, breath, etc) is repeated — speed, clarity of pronunciation, etc. will all change. One allows these features to shift effortlessly. Indeed, at some points in meditation they may completely fade out, disappear, or stop for brief periods. All of these changes are signs of correct, effortless practice.</p>\n\n<p>Research indicates that both types of meditation lead to novel states of mental flow and altered physiological functions. The precise physiological states differ somewhat between different techniques, but they all tend to promote states of reduced stress and increased awareness, via minimal effort.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your question about mantras: I have extensively studied traditional practices, eastern and western, and I can assure you that the mantras used by TM and NSR are not the names of any gods, teachers, holy places, or rituals (et cetera) that I have ever seen or heard. Just as these meditation programs state, their mantras are pleasant sounding syllables that do not have any recognizable meaning. I would add that these meditation methods do not really emphasized the mantra as the main point; they are just tools of meditation. </p>\n\n<p>If, despite these assurances, you are still cautious about mantras but still want to try the method, that is okay.  Instead, you may want to choose a short, pleasant word from your own tradition. The most important thing is that you find the sound harmonious, and that you learn to use it in the effortless manner described above. Some people find this easy to learn on their own. However, you may have greater confidence if you find an experienced meditation teachet to guide you to the essential effortlessness of practice. </p>\n\n<p>Best wishes!</p>\n\n\n",

Since an office is not a permanent dwelling in the same was as a house, there is a doubt if it absolutely requires one.

He has some interesting perspectives on the importance and function of the Rav as a means of explaining Pirkei Avot 1:6 and 1:16 which both have the same expression עשה לך רכ - \"make for yourself a rabbi\". In particular, see footnote 6, as there are a variety of interpretations on these two. There are opinions stating that since your Rav is also your mentor in life, you should feel free to ask him about major life decisions such as the ones that you mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>For years, strangers went to Rav Feinstein and the Lubavitcher Rebbe, among others. It is well-known that both of them advised thousands of people on all types of life decisions, not just halachic opinions. Undoubtedly, among these people were numerous local \"yokels\" for whom these two were their personal Rav. I have no doubt, that these locals asked their rav person \"secular\" questions, as well.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, your rav may not be on the caliber as these greats; perhaps, he is, proportionately. The point is, that there is certainly a precedent to ask a rav about non-halachic matters. Often, there isa cross-over. For example, when considering taking a job, esp. one in another city, your Rav might know people there; recommend a shul, colleague, connections, or may advise not to go there because there are no Jewish resources. Would you, necessarily know all this, yourself? What if you had made your own decision and discovered you're in a non-Jewish city, and you're uncomfortable? If you had only asked your rav that question <strong>before</strong> you took the job!</p>\n\n<p>Granted, I wouldn't bother the rav with a \"trivial\" secular question like \"Which brand of <em>chrein</em> causes the lightest stain?\" (Like that rhyme??) But a good rav is and should not be \"too busy\" to answer any important \"life\" question such as the two that you mentioned.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The answer really is it depends on the rabbi!\nI get the impression that rabbonim today are asked more non halachic shaalos than halachic ones. </p>\n\n<p>I also believe one should always also use your own judgement. For instance in naming a child, it is written that the parents have the ruach hakodesh to give the 'right' name for him/her. \nUsually one in the family. Giving the name of a deceased rabbi is a modern minhag. The chasam sofer did not call any of his children nosson although his rebbe Rabbi N Adler had no children.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I once asked Rabbi Pinchas Sheinberg zt'l about a complicated question of whether to stay in israel or go back to the USA.</p>\n\n<p>I presented what I thought were the many complicated factors in the question. But he stopped me smiled and said \"ruchnius! you have to find out what's going to be better for your ruchnius (spiritual growth)\". </p>\n\n<p>I said \"many going back to the usa is better?\" </p>\n\n<p>He replied \"ein hachi nami (could be) that's what you have to figure out\".</p>\n\n<p>so according to this, if it's a question which touches on spiritual matters, it is good to ask a Rav.</p>\n\n<p>Now there's a story about Rabbi Yisrael Salanter who when he first got married told his wife, you take of physical matters in the home and I take care of spiritual matters. Afterwards, though he found out that almost all matters in the home touch on the spiritual.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, This is often the problem between the Rav of a community and the baalei batim. the Rav sees the spiritual problems/advantages which will come from this or that while the baalei batim tend to see it from a different perspective.</p>\n\n<p>so to answer the question, yes. by all means consult with a Rav such questions as picking different jobs (the bigger the rav the better). There are many factors which have implications for your ruchnius that you may not notice. A good Rav can see with foresight where these paths may lead you.</p>\n\n\n",

Belsky's letter\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Yeshiva World News <a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/303911/harav-yisroel-belsky-writes-letter-slamming-kosher-switch.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">published a letter</a> from Rabbi Belsky saying that the <a href=\"http://www.kosherswitch.com/live/tech/how\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kosher Switch</a> accomplishes nothing and is simply a regular melacha.</p>\n\n<p>My question is basically the same as this <a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/303911/harav-yisroel-belsky-writes-letter-slamming-kosher-switch.html#comment-879338\" rel=\"nofollow\">commentor</a>. Is this a denial of the principle of Grama as a leniency (as R. Belsky alludes to in the footnote, arguably) or is there something specific about the switch and its intended use which is different than the <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/eng/?CategoryID=249&ArticleID=101&Page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tzomet switches</a>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Belsky, <em>z\"l</em>, explicitly declares his reasoning in the letter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...a tiny possibility of <em>ספק</em> is introduced so that the odds of the melocho being completed is reduced somewhat or delayed minimally. This concept has no place in Halacha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My understanding is that his reasoning is not that different from the general principle that we are not concerned with the kashrus of microscopic organism. Something has to be distinct to be halachically significant. Furthermore, the explicit intention of the user is to accomplish the end result. The negligible micro-process is halachically insignificant. Real grama involves real uncertainties and/or distinct delays. According to the kosher-switch makers one should be allowed to keep striking a match until it lit because each time there is an uncertainty if it will light. If they altered it such that one wouldn't know if even repeated tries would result in it working at all, all Shabbos, and that, even if it did, it wouldn't be for at least minutes or hours after the action, perhaps then Rav Belsky would be lenient, in those situations in which we are lenient regarding <em>grama</em>. (As Rav Belsky mentions, this switch, according to its makers, should ultimately do away with all the 39 melochos.) </p>\n\n<p>As an aside, I believe Rav Nachum Rabinovitch, <em>shlit\"a</em>, also employs a similar reasoning in arguing against <em>grama</em> machines. Ironically, the Kosher Switch-makers try to use him as if he endorsed their product, which is particularly egregious since my understanding is that he was eventually forced to explicitly write them otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the reasoning behind the ban is even more explicit here: <a href=\"http://matzav.com/gedolim-kosher-switch-should-not-be-brought-into-the-jewish-home\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://matzav.com/gedolim-kosher-switch-should-not-be-brought-into-the-jewish-home</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>He also signed on \n<a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/114.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> letter, which allows for grama devices in hospitals.</p>\n\n\n",

It's not because the language is sacred, it's because that's the one that it was written in. After all, every translation is a commentary; are you really satisfied with limiting yourself to those composed by other people, never once learning how to read the actual thing yourself? And since the translators working for Artscroll aren't actually infallible, you'd do well not to rely so completely on what they've written, but learn how to critique it.

He points out that Chazzal disallowed Prakmatia, a word only used to connote a business transaction, not personal acquisitions.

The Maharal interprets the unique significance of Aramaic and advocates that <em>shnayim mikra v'echad targum</em> specifically employ <em>Targum Onkelos</em> for this reason. (In seeming contrast, the <em>gemara</em> in <em>Bava Kamma</em> [at the end of <em>Hachovel</em>(?)]) criticizes those who combine the language of the Babylonians with Hebrew [i.e. the classical version of \"Yiddish\"] so this likely is irrelevant since the Babylonian tongue alone is advocated there.) Nonetheless, there is certainly a solid argument to be made that if the language comes at the cost of the <em>lomdus</em>, the <em>tafel</em> has replaced the <em>ikar</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Source for some people not eating processed foods on Pesach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've talked to a few people, and they try to \"limit\" the consumption of processed foods on passover, although when they \"need to\", as with grape juice and wine etc, they will buy it from the store. This just seems ridiculous to me: if you're anyway buying some things, why not enjoy Yom Tov with more processed foods? And what's wrong with processed foods anyway? (This is even the case when they have multiple \"kosher for passover\" hechtshers on on it!) Is there any source for this law? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It says (in the name if the arizal I think) that one who does not eat chametz on Pesach will be protected from sinning the whole year. (That a person will be protected from shogeg you can still sin if you choose to.) So if one only eats food that he saw from start to finish the chances of eating chometz is greatly reduced. And since chometz is an issur mashehu it's very easy to transgress an true it would be batul before Pesach but do you want to rely on bitul and even if you do there is a machlokes rishonim if bitul simply causes the whole food to be mutar or if it actually causes the issur to become heter (there are halachik ramifications) (like on shabbos if pikuach nefesh pushes off the issur or makes it mutar) so according to the opinion that only makes it mutar it would still be better (if one has good reason) not to eat it. And it has become customary in many communities to be very strict on Pesach for these reasons and in commercial processing it's very hard to keep all the chumros. \n   Also there is a custom not to eat out of the house and certainly that includes a factory. \n   In addition some people feel that it a a good idea because it makes people aware of the severity of the issur and of kashrut in general. </p>\n\n\n",

Is there a discussion at all in contemporary religious Zionist rabbinic writings regarding shaving and/or getting haircuts on 5 Iyar (whether officially <em>Yom HaAtzmaut</em> or when the official commemoration was earlier])? Is there a potential distinction made when 5 Iyar falls out on Friday (as this year [5775]) a la the leniencies regarding haircutting/shaving on Fridays more generally)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>R' Eliezer Melamed discusses this in the Zmanim volume of פניני הלכה.</p>\n\n<p>He writes that the generally accepted approach to all of the minhagim of avielut of the omer is to be lenient with those things which would actually reduce the simcha of the day. For example, forbidding music and dancing would reduce the simcha so those are muttar but not allowing weddings wouldn't really make any difference so weddings remains assur.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, he says that those who would usually shave before a chag or such like ought to shave before Yom Ha'atzmaut while only someone who looks dishevelled should have a haircut <em>beforehand</em>. On the day itself however, even someone who looks fine can have a haircut.</p>\n\n<p>You can find the entire series of פניני הלכה at <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ph.yhb.org.il</a>. The place where he discusses this particular issue can be found at <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/05-04-11/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ph.yhb.org.il/05-04-11/</a>. You can find the various opinions he is basing himself off in the footnoes there.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: He makes no distinctions between whether Yom Ha'atzmaut falls on 5th Iyar or not. Earlier in the book, he discusses the conditions and details under which it is nidcheh (most years) and compares it to when Purim is nidcheh. As far as I can tell, everything he writes is equally applicable to when it falls on 5th Iyar or otherwise.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It’s really simple - there is no mourning as the day is recognized as being Kodesh to the extent that Yidden got back Eretz Israel… and thus you go into it like a Chag clean shaven if you regularly shave however you don’t need to take a haircut unless you look inappropriate….. but on the day itself you can take a haircut as there in no mourning at this point! As for weddings it’s not a sign of mourning to not have a wedding so not making one is not a בזיון for the day…. Furthermore no one makes a wedding on a Chag אין מערבין שמחה בשמחה</p>\n<p>P.s. possibly due to the difference of shaving not being a major and thus happy occurrence is done erev the day of Chag whereas a haircut is a deeper level of simcha can only be done on the day when there is no mourning</p>\n\n\n",

Are there other dates in the year that are also predicted there as significant? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As far as I'm aware, there are two sources for the quote.</p>\n\n<p>The first source for this is the book קול התור, allegedly written by Rav Hillel Rivlin M'shklov (one of the Goan's students), some 200 years ago.  </p>\n\n<p>The thing is that the published book is an \"abridged version\", as the initial writings were deemed too complicated.  There are actually two published versions (from 1947 and 1968).  Interestingly, the passage referring the 5th of Iyar only appear in the 1968 version.</p>\n\n<p>The quote refers to the date the Gaon's students first opened their beit-medrash in Jerusalem.  The quote is as follows:<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%94_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bottom of the page</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויחד עם זה הבנת פעולה חשובה לבנין ירושלם נראה לנו תלמידי רבנו הגר\"א\n  בגוונין נהירין כי באותה שעה נפתח החלון הראשון של מחיצת הברזל לחבור\n  הזכות של ברית אבות (החבור שהוא יסוד דתפארת דרך מלכות) שהיה נפסק מחורבן\n  בית המקדש. ואותו היום היה יום ה\"עשרים בעמר\" שהוא יסוד דתפארת כידוע\n  ליודעי חן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>My translation:</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"it's obvious to us, the students of the Gr\"a that at this point the first window of the Iron Curtain opened to connect to the \"Zchut Avot\" (Merits of our Forefathers) that ceased since the destruction of the Temple.  And that day was the 20th of the Omer.\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The second (and more definitive) source I know of is from מדרש שלמה, written by Rabbi Shlomo Rivlin who published a series of lectures \"based on\" stuff his grandfather (of the same name) gave dvar torah's about (Grandfather lived ~150 years ago, about 100 years after the Gaon passed away).  Both are/were student of the Gaon's school.  The date of publication I have for this is 1953 (so after the 1948 war, but before the liberation of Jerusalem).</p>\n\n<p>The quote is as follows (\"מדרש שלמה\" (דרשה ט\"ז ע' 53\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזהו הטעם שבימי הספירה צריכים להיזהר יותר ממגע עם חברותא רעה ומדברי\n  סכנה, זולת שני ימים מסוימים בימי הספירה שאין הקליפה יכולה לשלוט בהם,\n  והם יום העשרים בעומר, ויום הארבעים ושניים בעומר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>My translation:</strong></p>\n\n<p>And this is the reason that we must be extra careful to refrain contact with evil connections and [things of] danger, except for two specific days in the Sephira [of the Omer] that the \"klipa\" cannot control [i.e. these are \"good days], and they are the twentieth day of the Omer and the Forty-second day of the Omer.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:  Thanks to Shamiach for reminding me, the 42nd day of the Omer comes out on the 27th of Iyar, while the official date for the Liberation of Jerusalem is the 28th, so there is an \"off by one\" issue.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note that the attribution to the Vilna Gaon is somewhat controversial, and there are some (notably Rav Sternbuch of the Eidah Charaydit) who have greatly disputed this interpretation.</p>\n\n\n",

In the Aramaic <em>pael</em> (as perhaps in Job 36:2) it can also have the added nuance of expecting something, or lying in wait. The derived noun, כֹתרת, appears in Tanakh in reference to the head of a pillar (so, for example, 1 Kings 7:16 and Jeremiah 52:22, etc) - perhaps because it concerned an ornamentation that \"surrounded\" the pillar, or \"crowned\" it in some fashion.</p>\n\n<p>In the rabbinic literature, כותרת is used on several occasions to refer to the top-most part of a pillar, and you can see Jastrow for examples. From there, and based on the metaphorical relationship between works of literature and physical edifices, it also comes to denote the heading of a textual passage. This is a development that occurs post-Talmud, and is the reason why <em>today</em>, in Israeli Hebrew, a כותרת is a title.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know what is the earliest instance in text of people referring to the material at the top of a section as its כותרת, but such passages are commonly described this way in speech - and not just in reference to the Rambam.</p>\n\n\n",

However, the Rambam codifies this halachah as an obligation to teach one's son \"Torah shebichtav kulah,\" which the Bach, Taz, Shach and Gra understand to mean as all of Tanach (Yoreh De'ah 245). Based on this, the Revid ha-Zahav (a member of the beis din of Vilna at the time of the Gra) argued that whether Nevi'im and Ketuvim are part of Torah shebichtav or Torah shebe'al peh is a dispute between Rashi and the Rambam (see Revid ha-Zahav, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14168&st=&pgnum=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hakdamah, no. 1</a>, and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14167&st=&pgnum=324\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parashat Va'etchanan</a>). (However, see R. Yaakov Kaminetzky's <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=60250&pagenum=16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mevo le-Limud ha-Mikra in Emet le-Yaakov al ha-Torah</a> in which he explains the Rambam's position differently.)</p>\n<p>This may also relate to a dispute between the Rambam and the Ra'avad at the end of Hilchot Megillah (2:18). The Rambam, basing himself on the Yerushalmi, says that of all of the books of Tanach, the only ones that will remain at the end of days are the five books of the Torah and Megillat Esther. The Ra'avad takes issue with the Rambam's understanding, and says that all the books of Tanach will remain, but will not be read in public. The Acharonim explain that according to the Rambam, the other books of Tanach may be considered to be essentially \"Torah shebe'al peh\" inasmuch as their message is only based on the needs of the time (see Nedarim 22b: אמר רב אדא ברבי חנינא: אלמלא לא חטאו ישראל, לא ניתן להם אלא חמישה חומשי תורה וספר יהושע בלבד; Ta'anit 9a: יתיב רבי יוחנן וקא מתמה אמר מי איכא מידי דכתיבי בכתובי דלא רמיזי באורייתא; Rashi, Chullin 137a: תורת משה קרויה תורה לפי שנתנה תורה לדורות ושל נביאים לא קרי אלא קבלה שקבלו מרוח הקדש כל נבואה ונבואה לפי צורך השעה והדור והמעשה). The Ra'avad, on the other hand, may hold that all the books of Tanach are part of Torah shebichtav.</p>\n<p>Another relevant issue may be whether there is a concept of \"mitzvat keriah\" for Nevi'im and Ketuvim. The Gemara in Berachot 5a says ״תורה״ זה מקרא וכו׳ ״אשר כתבתי״ אלו נביאים וכתובים. Rashi explains, זה מקרא, חומש שמצוה לקרות בתורה. The Maharsha explains Rashi's view: תורה זו מקרא, דהיינו גוף התורה, והיא נקראת מקרא בכל מקום בל׳ התורה, ובזו המסכת שהיא תתלת ש״ס בא לפרש, דע״כ נקראת התורה מקרא בלישנא דתלמודא בכל מקום, על שם שמצוה לקרות בה, והיינו דבעי לקרותה בכתב בנקודותי׳ ובפיסוק טעמיה וכו', ואמר אשר כתבתי זו נביאים וכתובים, דגם אלו נתנו ליכתב, אבל אין בהן מצות קריאה כמו בתורה וק״ל. In other words, according to Rashi as explained by the Maharsha, there is a distinction between Chumash, which must be read appropriately, and Nevi'im and Ketuvim which do not require this level of care. However, the Beit Yosef (Orach Chaim 61) cites the Radak who argues with Rashi and maintains that one must read carefully throughout Tanakh: והרב ר׳ דוד קמחי כתב שבכל עת שיקרא אדם בתורה נביאים וכתובים צריך לזהר, אבל הזהירו בק״ש וה״ה לכל קריאה וכו׳.

Why must we commemorate the double portion of <em>mahn</em> at <em>every</em> meal when the double portion itself only arrived on Friday?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Tur (orach chaim 291) quotes an opinion that 2 loaves are unnecessary for the third meal. The explanation offered is that from the double portion of Friday, four loaves were made. One was consumed on Friday itself, one was consumed on Friday night, and one was consumed at the first daytime meal. This means that only one loaf remained for the third meal. According to this view, we require 2 loaves as long as the people in the desert still had 2 loaves remaining. The other opinion, which the Rama (291:4) cites as the primary one, is that every meal of shabbat requires 2 loaves, presumably in commemoration of the manna, and not based on how much bread remained. The Perisha (291:12) spells this out explicitly, commenting on the view that 2 loaves are required at every meal: </p>\n\n<p>הרי נשאר לו אחד שלם לסעודה שלישית. ומכל מקום לא קשיא מידי להנוהגין לבצוע על שתי ככרות די\"ל דאין בוצעין על שתי ככרות רק לזכר נס, <strong>דהא בליל כניסת שבת ובשחרית נמי אין בוצע על שתי ככרות אלא משום זכר נס בעלמא</strong>, ה\"ה גבי סעודה שלישית</p>\n\n<p>Here is the quote from the Tur: </p>\n\n<p>וכתב הרמב\"ם ז\"ל שגם בסעודה שלישית קובע על היין ובוצע על שתי ככרות וא\"א הרא\"ש ז\"ל לא היה מברך על היין קודם משום דאיתקש יום ללילה לענין קידוש מה לילה סגי בחד זימנא אף ביום נמי בחד זימנא אבל היה בוצע על ב' ככרות ואיתא בירושלמי במכילתא דבסעודה שלישית צריך לפחות ככר אחד שלם משום דביום ו' ירד לכל אחד שני עומרים ומכל עומר עשו שתי ככרות הרי ד' לשני עומרים אכל אחד בע\"ש ואחד בליל שבת ואחד בבקר הרי נשאר לו אחד שלם לסעודה שלישית</p>\n\n<p>Here is the Rama: </p>\n\n<p>הגה: ואם סועד הרבה פעמים בשבת צריך לכל סעודה ב' ככרות (אבודרהם ומיימוני) ולפחות לא יהיה לו בסעודה שלישית פחות מככר אחד שלם (טור ומרדכי פרק כל כתבי) ומזה פשט המנהג להקל לבצוע בסעודה שלישית רק בככר אחד שלם אבל יש להחמיר ליקח שנים</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See the Aruch Hashulchan או\"ח רעד-ג: who quotes the Maharshal who had the practice to use one loaf at night and two loafs by day, for the honor of the day is greater than the honor of the night. However, the practice had become in accordance with the opinion of the Vilna Gaon that we use two loafs at every meal.</p>\n\n<p>והמהרש''ל נהג בלילה לבצוע אחד וביום שני ככרות, משום דכבוד יום קודם לכבוד לילה.

    "content": "# Water heaters on shabbos and yom tov\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was looking into buying a more efficient water heater, and was dismayed to discover the significant halachic issues surrounding tankless water heaters (<a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/681/insights-from-the-institute-winter-2008/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/681/insights-from-the-institute-winter-2008/</a>). Upon further research, I discovered that there are hybrid systems that use a normal storage tank but a tankless heater for rapid replenishment (<a href=\"http://www.rinnai.us/hybrid-tank-tankless-water-heater/how-it-works\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.rinnai.us/hybrid-tank-tankless-water-heater/how-it-works</a>). Does this mitigate the halachic problems of tankless heaters on yom tov?</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, shabbos 146a declares hatmanah as assur, using the example of a pipe of cold water inside hot springs (which would nominally have been permitted) as the source of the decree. What about the inverse case - where hot water pipes are circulated through a cold water tank?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>I received the following answer from the Star-K but it doesn't include detailed sources:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The way this system works is that, when you open a faucet, hot water\n  exits the tank.  Cold water enters the tank in order to replace the\n  hot water which has exited.  The system recognizes the change in\n  temperature in the tank, and activates the tankless heater. \n  Presumably, it takes at least a few seconds for all this to happen. \n  Since there is a time delay, Rabbi Heinemann would consider the\n  activation of tankless heater to be a gramma, which is permissible on\n  Yom Tov.  Therefore this should be fine to use on Yom Tov.</p>\n  \n  <p>His only concern was that maybe the system is so efficient and the\n  thermostat so sensitive that there is not a time delay of a few\n  seconds before the tankless heater activates.  He feels that this is\n  unlikely, especially if the system is not set at the hottest setting.</p>\n  \n  <p>Perhaps you could check with the installer (or manufacturer) that\n  there  is a delay of a few seconds between the opening of the faucet\n  and the activation of the tankless heater.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, the ruling (according to the Star-K) is directly dependent upon the sensitivity of the system to fluctuations in temperature - if it turns on immediately (or perhaps even if it preheats the inflow of water?) when the tap is used, then it would be problematic.</p>\n\n<p>This need for grama would seem to apply especially when the (gas-based) tankless water heater doesn't have a pilot light, since any time it activates you would be starting a new fire without an existing flame. </p>\n\n<p>I have not received an answer to the \"counterflow\" question of hatmana of chamin bitzonen.</p>\n\n\n",

My mother had me circumcised as a baby in a hospital but I do not look circumcised, so I went to a urologist and he said what probably happened was I did not have as much skin removed as many who are circumcised have removed and so I don't appear circumcised. So I was wondering if I still qualify for hatafat dam brit? I told my rabbi and he and I are searching for other cases where a person was circumcised as a baby (not by a mohel) and then doesn't appear to be circumcised and whether or not they still qualify for the simple hatafat dam brit.

Numerous halachot are gleaned from this explanation, among them (forgot the Gemarah this is in) that a father is not allowed to hit a teen-age son, because of this rule.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't seen any commentary glean a similar non-literal explanation regarding the beginning of the verse, \"Do not insult the deaf.\" </p>\n\n<p>For example, there are many people whom I've tried to offer advice that would help them improve their behavior or get themselves out of a difficult situation. They don't listen and they are still in the same situation and keep asking me for help. After a while, I don't really want to be near them, and I have to tell them, politely, but diplomatically, that I really don't want to hear them complain to me anymore and they have to get out of their situation and / or get help.

(Separate issue if this applies to deaf who wear cochlear implants, but feel free to address this in an answer, if you wish.) Rash\"i just explains that you shouldn't insult anyone and then explains just why the Torah specified a <em>cheresh</em>, but he doesn't give the term <em>cheresh</em> a separate meaning as he does with <em>iver</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone \"redefine\" the term <em>cheresh</em> beyond a physically deaf person? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><em>Sefer Hamitzvos Hakatzar</em> (by the author of <em>Chafetz Chayim</em>) lists as prohibition 45:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A prohibition-command not to curse a <em>kasher</em> Jew, as it says \"do not curse a deaf person\".

In a similar vein, a utensil that originally had been owned by a non-Jew, when it now is \"consecrated\" for use by the \"<em>mamlechet</em> <em>kohanim</em>\" (Kingdom of Priests) also must first be ritually immersed in a <em>mikvah</em>.  </p>\n\n<p>In fact one could argue that for those born into the Jewish faith, the only direct connection they have to the <em>tevilah</em> (ritual immersion) of <em>gerut</em> (conversion) is through <em>tevilat keilim</em>. <em>Keilim</em> (utensils) in general are an extension of the body which is itself a <em>keli</em> (utensil) which can be used for the service of G-d or for mundane/secular matters. When a <em>ger</em> (convert) draws close to G-d by joining His service he is consecrating his body toward that end. Similarly, whenever he acquires a new utensil that was originally from the mundane/secular world, to use in his newly-consecrated life devoted to G-d, he must also first ritually immerse that utensil for that service. (See also <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Tevilat_Keilim\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Tevilat_Keilim</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Since the <em>mitzvah</em> is based on the \"consecration\" of the utensil for the use of a Jew, it is only binding when the Jew first acquires it for actual use, not if he is merely reselling it. It is only when he plans to use it that it is conceptually an extension of his actual body, and therefore requiring of <em>tevilah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As far as why there is room for leniency for a guest, see, e.g., <a href=\"http://www.dinonline.org/2014/04/13/eating-from-non-toveled-dishes-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dinonline.org/2014/04/13/eating-from-non-toveled-dishes-2/</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a prohibition, in principle, against using dishes that were not toveled (Rema, Yoreh De’ah 120:8). Authorities discuss the nature\n  of this prohibition (rabbinic or Torah).</p>\n  \n  <p>This obligation applies specifically to the owner of the dishes.\n  However, somebody who borrows dishes from a Jew also needs to ensure\n  they are toveled, and a guest is possible considered as a sho’el.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, it is possible that somebody eating as a guest is not\n  considered as “borrowing” the dishes, because it is the owner’s use to\n  have guests in his home (see Shut Beis Avi no. 116).</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Shlomo Zalman adds a point in that if the guest has an obligation\n  to take the food out of the dish to place it in another (toveled)\n  dish, he can for the same price place it in his mouth (Tevillas Keilim\n  p. 86). This will apply specifically to dishes and not to cutlery.</p>\n  \n  <p>Another consideration is the status of porcelain (china) dishes. These\n  dishes might be considered kli cheres (earthenware) and therefore\n  exempt from the obligation of tevillah, though most are stringent to\n  tovel them because of their similarity (today) to glass. Again, this\n  consideration will not apply to cutlery.</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, because of the noted considerations there is room for\n  leniency under extenuating circumstances (though for cutlery one\n  should try to avoid the use of non-toveled metal cutlery).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can you derive benefit from other Jews' melachas during an extension of Shabbos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My question refers to the practice of tosafos Shabbos, or extending the duration of Shabbos. In Yoma 81b this is called a mitzvah, and we learn one is required to do so at both the beginning and the end of Shabbos--but one only needs to do it by very short times, which are probably already reflected in the published z'manim. However, I have heard in a few places that very pious people may extend the Shabbos even longer, and that this is considered meritorious.</p>\n\n<p>My question is this: if one is deliberately extending one's Shabbos, and others are not, is it halachically acceptable to derive benefit from melachos they are doing during your extension? On one hand, they are not doing the melachas in violation of Shabbos--but on the other hand, shouldn't your observance stay exactly the same throughout your Shabbos?</p>\n\n<p>This probably connects to the question of whether you can derive benefit from the melacha of a Jew in another part of the world for whom it is not Shabbos...</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh2/1/263/index.htm#_ftnref_2104\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch</a> of R' Shneur Zalman of Liadi (263:25) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מי שקדם להתפלל ערבית של שבת קודם שהתפללו הקהל אף על פי שכבר חל עליו קבלת שבת יכול לומר אפילו לישראל חבירו שלא קבל עדיין השבת שיעשה לו מלאכה ומותר לו ליהנות מהמלאכה בשבת דכיון (ח) שלחבירו מותר הוא אין באמירתו אליו איסור כלל(ולא אסרו האמירה לנכרי אף על פי שאינו מצווה על השבת) אלא כשאומר לו בשעה האסורה לכל ישראל (עיין סי' רס\"א).</p>\n<p>וכן מי שמאחר להתפלל ערבית במוצאי שבת או שממשיך סעודתו בלילה מותר לו לומר אפילו לישראל שכבר התפלל והבדיל בתפלה שיעשה לו מלאכה ומותר לו ליהנות ולאכול ממלאכתו אע\"פ שאח\"כ יזכיר עדיין של שבת בברכת המזון:</p>\n<p>One who prayed Friday night Maariv before the community, even though he already accepted Shabbos, can tell another Jew who didn't accept Shabbos to do work for him and he can benefit from the work.

    "title": "Was the Mishkan Built on Shabbat?",
    "content": "# Was the Mishkan Built on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a famous midrash that relates the 39 prohibitions of Shabbat to the various types of activities that were required for the mishkan's construction. Implicit within this idea is the notion that the mishkan itself was not erected on Shabbat (so, for example, both Rashi and Ramban on Exodus 35:2, based on the Mekhilta, Parshat Vayaqhel). And yet, there is also a famous midrash to the effect that on each of the seven days prior to erecting the mishkan as a semi-permanent structure, Moses built it in the morning and dismantled it in the evening (see, for example, Seder Olam Rabbah §7). Since it is impossible that there could have been seven consecutive days that did <em>not</em> include Shabbat, that would seem to suggest that there was at least one Shabbat on which the mishkan was constructed.</p>\n\n<p>Are these two midrashim at odds with one another?

I also found in מסורת משה that someone asked Moshe Feinstein this question and he replied that their vessels do require tevila.</p>\n<p>The status of a meshumad is a complex matter. Firstly, the achronim deliberate on the precise definition of a meshumad concerning immersion (tevilah). Many do not consider someone who publicly desecrates the Shabbos enough to be considered as a meshumad, but rather someone entirely detached from Judaism. Certain authorities, like the חתם סופר, attempt to provide evidence from the fact that a meshumad does not require immersion when undergoing teshuva, unlike a non-Jew.</p>\n<p>Igros Moshe, rules that immersion is not necessary.</p>\n<p>See\nתשורת שי (סימן ק\"ג), שבט הלוי (ח\"ו סי' רמ\"ה אות ג'), ואגרו\"מ א\"ח ח\"ג סי' ד</p>\n\n\n",

In a similar fashion, the midrash (Tanchuma, Noach §3) notes that one only acquires Torah if he abandons the pursuit for honour. It would seem to me that the confluence of these character traits (abandoning hope for honour or greatness, together with patience and acceptance of suffering) bespeak a certain abasement of one's own dignity.</p>\n\n<p>In line with this idea, the Mishna (Avot 2:5) notes that one who suffers from embarrassment will never learn, and Orchot Tzadikkim (§2) relates a story concerning one of the \"great ones of the generation\", in which ascribes his stature to always believing others were better than he.

Reincarnation is usually because a soul has to fix something it did or did not do but for whatever reason can't go to gehinom or needs to be done in the physical world. Most souls however either throughout the course of their life completed what they needed and are able to be cleansed in gehinom of whatever impurities they may have picked up.<br>\n   Also to clarify there are 2 concepts  The return of a soul into a new body which happens quite often and the \"piggybacking\" of a soul into a body human or otherwise that already has a soul.(similar but not the same as a dibbuk). This is what you asked about(As well there is the resurrection of the dead by the times of mosiach).  In the case of the return of a soul, the soul I the person having full control over the actions of he person. Whereas by piggybacking the soul while it may provide some benefit to the body it inhabits (such as I think leaders get assistance from moshe rabeinu because a \"piece\" of his soul goes into their body) it does not have control over the person (unless of course it's a dibbuk) for sources see discussion about moshe rabeinu and yakov avinu an how Kabbalah explains the phrases moshe lo meis (Moshe did not die) and yakov lo meis.

    "content": "# Why Does the Torah Cycle start/end on Simchat Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If the Torah was given on <em>Shavu'ot</em>, wouldn't it be logical to make that day the time to start the reading cycle (or, at least, line up the yearly cycle so I am up to the narrative of <em>matan torah</em> naturally at that time) at that point? Instead, we start and end the cycle on <em>Shmini Atzeret</em> which is not a time which is, as far as I can tell, inherently related to the <em>Torah</em>. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/20656/1362\">This</a> answer quotes a source which posits a possible explanation but nothing definite. <a href=\"http://jewishanswers.org/index.php?p=3396\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This</a> website presents an explanation of sorts but with no sources, and its point is that we should be starting the cycle on <em>Yom Kippur</em> but to avoid some sort of religious confusion, we push off the celebration to what ends up being an arbitrary date.</p>\n\n<p>This explanation, though, devalues <em>Shavu'ot</em> then (or turns it into \"<em>Shavuot</em> is therefore more about a relationship with G-d than the <em>Torah</em> itself\"). If it isn't about <em>Matan Torah</em>, then why do we celebrate it as \"<em>zman matan torateinu</em>\"?</p>\n\n<p>When did this cycle timing start and why, and why would we then retain <em>Shavu'ot</em> in its current form, instead of turning it into a spiritual day which ignores the giving of the <em>Torah</em> aspect?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>One answer is that it is juxtaposed with the giving of the Torah - but the giving of the second Tablets on Yom Kippur, not the first tablets on Shavuos. This is explained at length in several places in Chabad Chassidus. One of them is <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/admur/mlukat/1/29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Meshech Chochma <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14061&st=&pgnum=422&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a> that on Shmini Atzers Zos HaBracha was read anyway. The Talmud which describes reading Zos HaBracha then is talking about the custom to finish the Torah once every three years, because - echoing the point in Chabad Chassidus - the unity aspect of Shimini Atzeres is mentioned in that Parsha, so it is connected to the day. So according to that, this is the natural time to make the Siyum when finishing once a year.</p>\n\n<p>It should be pointed out that there is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/38396/440\">not necessarily</a> an inherent relationship between Shavuos and Mattan Torah in a historical sense and the custom of completing the Torah in one year likely predates the fixed calendar where such a connection really sets in.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Sefer הקריאה בתורה והלכותיה chapter 60 note 4 quotes the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9223&st=&pgnum=253\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">לבוש סימן תרס\"ט</a> as saying that the cycle should really begin/end around Rosh Hashanah (it sounds like he's saying that logically it makes sense to 'start' the Torah at the 'start' of the year). However, in order to 'trick the Satan' about when Rosh Hashanah is, we push the cycle off until after Rosh Hashanah. And once we push it off and it's no longer exactly Rosh Hashanah, we push it off a bit more until the first Shabbos after all the holidays are completed in order so that we don't have a situation where we begin the new Parshah cycle and then immediately interrupt it with Holiday readings.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The obvious answer is that, once it was set to be on an annual cycle, they wanted to make Devarim the Sedra immediately before Tisha B'Av, because it contains the verse that begins with \"Eichah\" and mentions the spies and other upsetting events, thus the cycle was built around that.</p>\n\n<p>For Devarim falling on the week before Tisha B'Av I can give a source, the Shulchan Orech, (not sure on the chapter). Some of the doubling-up rules, in particular Matot-Masei, is based around it.</p>\n\n<p>Another concept, although a less likely reason, is that Pesach and thus Shavuot that follows it is all about \"chadash\". Pesach falls in the 1st month. We are born as a nation and we relive the event like we were there in Egypt so we experience the \"anew\" concept about it. Shavuot follows when we receive the Torah anew.</p>\n\n<p>The number 7 though is about \"cyclic\" nature. We renew things again rather than starting afresh. The Shmitta cycle starts in the 7th month. We sit in the Sukkah, not to remember an event but to recognise Hashem protects us all the time. It isn't linked to a specific event that happened on a particular date but something continuous. We perform circuits with the species.</p>\n\n<p>And thus when it comes to renewing a continuous cycle of Torah, the festival that falls at the end of Sukkot seems the ideal time to do this.</p>\n\n\n",

The latter source notes that he had originally painted a '<a href=\"http://www.cartoonhebrew.com/zayin\">zayin</a>' as the last letter, when it should be a '<a href=\"http://www.cartoonhebrew.com/nun-sofit\">nun sofit</a>', but overpainted it. </p>\n\n<p>There is more precision in Michael Zell's book, 'Reframing Rembrandt: Jews and the Christian Image in Seventeenth-century' in which he shows the <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=mEBBY2ahcDUC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=rembrandt%20zayin&source=bl&ots=7e_HYuJgzd&sig=0wDMDPV2K3RDBBWkrkYaonplkHo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=u-BAVa--EpPkaqjGgLAF&ved=0CCoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=rembrandt%20zayin&f=false\">x-ray evidence</a> relates to a shift of the vertical descender from the right to the left (p 61).

The background is the disagreement among the Rabbis if the Torah was <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/15420/which-alphabet-were-the-original-torah-scrolls-in\">originally in Ivri or Ashuri</a>. The Talmud says that according to the view that it was in Ivri, Ashuri script was first seen when the Angel wrote it on the wall, thus the Jews were not familiar with it - this is why they couldn't read it.</p>\n\n<p>However, according to the view that Ashuri was always the script of Torah scrolls, the reason they couldn't understand it is that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/41210/which-letters-can-be-exchanged-in-a-gematria-notarikon\">a letter substitution</a> scheme was used. The first suggestion is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Atbash</a>, which would spell potentially plausible words that could be mistaken for having their face value meaning.</p>\n\n<p>The next option (that of Shmuel) presented is the closest to the Rembrant picture. He says it was three words as Rembrant has them, but neither the Talmud nor Rashi say anything about them being one on top of another, instead of in a line, but that doesn't preclude such a reading. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abravanel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a> in his commentary on the Book of Daniel <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33861&st=&pgnum=44&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maynei HaYeshua 7:1</a> says that they were written one on top of the the other, exactly as Rembrant represents it. He died about 100 years before Rembrant was born, and he credits no one else with the idea, so that would appear to be the source for the exact representation.</p>\n\n<p>There are additional similar letter possibilities suggested which don't seem relevant to your question.</p>\n\n<p>I don't see any mistakes in the script Rembrant used. A modern reader might think that the Samech is close to a final Mem (compare with the one in <a href=\"http://www.jerusalem-insiders-guide.com/hebrew-alphabet-chart.html#sthash.yIa4IqU0.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this chart</a>), but in fact some checking of some more contemporaneous printing (<a href=\"http://www.jidaily.com/uc9H\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">courtesy of here</a> - see image below) finds that in fact the Samech lines up perfectly, but the final Mem of those days is how a Samech is currently printed. In any event those letters are very similar in shape anyway. The last Nun is a plausible, even reasonable final Nun (and a final Nun is what appears in the Talmud) - compare it to the image below. I originally though it was at an odd angle, but zooming in to the image convinces me that the visual effect is that the entire left-most column is spacing is wider than the other columns, and the nun starts higher than the adjacent letters from the same row, creating that effect.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uC90J.jpg\" alt=\"1492 Hebrew printing\" title=\"A Hebrew printing of Devarim from 1492\"></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To summarize from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/57754/21\">Yishai's answer</a>, the Talmud says there was something funny about the way it was written; \"in columns\" is one possible interpretation. Assuming Manasseh ben Israel gave Rembrandt a sketch of what the letters should look like, I'd find it far more likely that Rembrandt was faithful to the sketch he was given (i.e. it was in columns) than that Rembrandt corrupted it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16636.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">From Jewish Virtual Library</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... there is no doubt that Rembrandt and Manasseh knew each other. In Rembrandt's 1635 Balthazar's Feast (National Gallery, London), a mysterious hand writes the words: Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin in Hebrew letters on the wall. Rembrandt may have consulted Manasseh about the script and in what manner the writing should be arranged. He wrote the words from top to bottom, according to an old Jewish tradition, which was later quoted in Manasseh's book <em>De Termino Vitae.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As for how precisely the final letter is written, Rembrandt was a non-Hebrew reader who was most likely working off a Hebrew sketch someone had given him. It's certainly close enough that it would look fine to all but the most discriminating eye.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Assuming the writing in the painting is <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%A4%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99#.D7.90.D7.95.D7.AA.D7.99.D7.95.D7.AA_.D7.94.D7.90.D7.9C.D7.A4.D7.91.D7.99.D7.AA_.D7.94.D7.A2.D7.91.D7.A8.D7.99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ketav 'Ivri</a>, which I humbly propose is quite clear, the incorrect letter in the painting is the final one. The verse in Daniel ends with the word \"ופרסין\" (\"ufarsin\"), spelled with a final Nun (\"Nun Sofit\") to indicate a plural noun. The Nun Sofit, in Ketav 'Ivri, should resemble the rightmost letter in the following chart:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/k7r8O.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>A careful examination of the painting shows that the final letter more closely resembles the letter Zayin in Ketav 'Ivri. This is most clearly indicated by the tail on the right of the letter's \"head\" (see image below highlighting the tail in the painting and compare to the image immediately below it depicting a Zayin in the Ketav 'Ivri; it being the leftmost of the two depictions).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ao4Ct.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/H1ySq.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>A Nun Sofit, as depicted in the rightmost letter in the chart above, does not include such a tail (i.e. the letter's \"torso\" begins from the rightmost portion of the letter's \"head\"), whereas the letter Zayin does. I therefore propose that the final letter in the painting is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>If one would like to claim that the final letter's tail is unintentional, I suggest looking at the second Alef in the painting. The second Alef's tail is smudged in a similar fashion to the painting's final letter. But, it is quite clear that an Alef in the Ketav 'Ivri also has a tail on the right portion of its head (as depicted in the painting's first Alef).</p>\n\n\n",

If the גדוד was not a threat, then why would the King decide to hurt and rob other people for the sake of financial gain?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The premise seems flawed. Consider the term’s usage in Shmuel 2:3:22-23:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהִנֵּה֩ עַבְדֵ֨י דָוִ֤ד וְיוֹאָב֙ בָּ֣א מֵֽהַגְּד֔וּד וְשָׁלָ֥ל רָ֖ב עִמָּ֣ם הֵבִ֑יאוּ וְאַבְנֵ֗ר אֵינֶ֤נּוּ עִם־דָּוִד֙ בְּחֶבְר֔וֹן כִּ֥י שִׁלְּח֖וֹ וַיֵּ֥לֶךְ בְּשָׁלֽוֹם׃ וְיוֹאָ֛ב וְכָל־הַצָּבָ֥א אֲשֶׁר־אִתּ֖וֹ בָּ֑אוּ וַיַּגִּ֤דוּ לְיוֹאָב֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר בָּֽא־אַבְנֵ֤ר בֶּן־נֵר֙ אֶל־הַמֶּ֔לֶךְ וַֽיְשַׁלְּחֵ֖הוּ וַיֵּ֥לֶךְ בְּשָׁלֽוֹם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And behold, the David’s servants and Yoav came from the <em>gedud</em>, and they brought much plunder with them. Avner was not with David in Chevron, for he sent him, and he went away in peace. And Yoav and the entire army that was with him came, and they told Yoav, saying, “Avner Ben Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he left in peace.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or why go all the way to Nach? Consider Bereishis 49:19:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גָּ֖ד גְּד֣וּד יְגוּדֶ֑נּוּ וְה֖וּא יָגֻ֥ד עָקֵֽב׃ </p>\n  \n  <p>Gad - <em>gedud</em> will <em>gedud</em> him, and he will <em>gedud</em> at their heels. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which Rashi explains as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גד גדוד יגודנו, גְּדוּדִים יָגוֹדּוּ הֵימֶנּוּ שֶׁיַּעַבְרוּ הַיַּרְדֵּן עִם אֲחֵיהֶם לַמִּלְחָמָה כָּל חָלוּץ עַד שֶׁנִּכְבְּשָׁה הָאָרֶץ: והוא יגוד עקב. כָּל גְּדוּדָיו יָשׁוּבוּ עַל עֲקֵבָם לְנַחֲלָתָם שֶׁלָּקְחוּ בְּעֵבֶר הַיַּרְדֵּן, וְלֹא יִפָּקֵד מֵהֶם אִישׁ:</p>\n  \n  <p>”Gad - <em>gedud</em> will <em>gedud</em> him”: <em>Gedudim</em> will <em>gedud</em> from him - that they will cross the Yardein with their brothers in war, all armed, until the Land is conquered. “And he will <em>gedud</em> at their heels”: all his <em>gedudim</em> will return on their heels to their territory which they took from Transjordan, and no man would be missing. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clearly the term גדוד has <em>something</em> to do with warfare. As such, consider Steinsaltz’s interpretation of the Gemara in Berachos:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר להם המלך: לכו ופשטו ידיכם בגדוד, במלחמה על העמים מסביב, להרחיב את גבולות הארץ, ולתת אפשרויות של פרנסה ליושביה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>leading to Sefaria’s translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>King David <strong>told them: Go and take up arms with the troops</strong> in battle in order to expand our borders and provide our people with the opportunity to earn a livelihood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To address your question point-by-point, with this background: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the legal justification for this measure?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s called a Milchemes Reshus - a king is allowed to declare war on another nation, provides certain prerequisites are met, as discussed in Rambam Hil. Melachim 5:1 and ch. 6. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Who were these bandits/troops? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Syria is commonly cited throughout Shas as a land which has certain stringencies over outside Eretz Yisrael yet is more lenient in many respects than Eretz Yisrael proper (ex. Demai 6:11, RH 1:4, BK 7:7, etc.). Rashi in many of those places quotes a tradition that this refers to Aram Tzova, a land which David conquered (ex. Berachos 36a, DH “u’ve’Suria” - presumably this is known from Tehillim 60:2, “when he fought with Aram Naharaim and Aram Tzovah, and Yoav returned and defeated Edom”). While the Gemara in question doesn’t cite the enemy specifically, I think it’s a fair assumption that it’s the same war. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If they were dangerous and the king always had a right to do this, then why were גדוד hanging around Israel, and why did King David only confront them when the people needed money? If the גדוד was not a threat, then why would the King decide to hurt and rob other people for the sake of financial gain?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because they weren’t in Eretz Yisrael; this was a war on a foreign nation for economical gain. The king can’t just attack for no reason, but if the people are so poor that nobody can give Tzedakah, then he has no other choice but to find resources elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n",

When do we say this? Only when they are all equal in wisdom, however if one is greater in wisdom despite the fact that he is of a lower status of tribe, since he has more wisdom he has precedence and thus you should give him the Tzedaka first.</p>\n\n<p>In general, despite the The obligation to give charity to those who ask and one mustn't delve too deeply whether or not someone is a liar or is misrepresenting himself. Nonetheless, we see in the Gemara Kesuvos 68a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היינו דאמר רבי אלעזר בואו ונחזיק טובה לרמאין שאלמלא הן היינו חוטאין\n  בכל יום שנאמר {דברים טו-ט} וקרא עליך אל ה' והיה בך חטא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer says \"let us find some good attribute of liars for if it were not for them we would be sinning every day. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains Rabbi Eliezer  statement: \"because by closing our eyes from the poor we would be sinning everyday, but now with all the liars out there we are forced to\"</p>\n\n<p>From this passage of Gemara  we see that nowadays there is no obligation to give money to just anyone who asks, especially if many of the panhandlers are known to be liars. </p>\n\n<p>However see the the Rambam (מתנות עניים ז:ז): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מפרנסין ומכסין עניי עכו''ם עם עניי ישראל מפני דרכי שלום. <strong>ועני המחזר\n  על הפתחים אין נזקקין לו למתנה מרובה אבל נותנין לו מתנה מועטת. ואסור\n  להחזיר את העני ששאל ריקם ואפילו אתה נותן לו גרוגרת אחת שנאמר אל ישוב\n  דך נכלם:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You must give the panhandler something, for it is forbidden to leave them empty handed </p>\n\n<p>So although you are not obligated to give money, nonetheless you should give them something, whether that be food or a drink of some sort. And maybe a small amount of money. </p>\n\n<p>In your case where many beggers solicit you, the best thing is to give them something, even a small amount. </p>\n\n\n",

The prophet has spoken it wantonly; you shall not be afraid\n  of him</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>some muslims I have spoken to claim this verse refers to the coming of their prophet.</p>\n\n<p>From these verses it seems the test of a true prophet is only whether what he says comes true. How do we know <strong>from the torah</strong> that the test of a true prophet is also that he does not come to change the torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Devarim <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9977/jewish/Chapter-13.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">13:1-4</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything I command you that you shall be careful to do it.

Idolatry is non-negotiable. If a \"prophet\" calls for it even as a one-off, he is false (although his \"sign\" - his prediction - may well have come true and G-d made it happen). But when it comes to anything else, a temporary change may in fact be required, but it cannot be a permanent addition or subtraction.</p>\n<p>In the beginning of Chapter 9 the Rambam brings 4 verses which support the idea that nothing can be added or removed by a subsequent prophet. However, those are best understood with the philosophical underpinning described in the preceding chapter. There the point is that a prophet is not accepted based on the strength of their miracles. Rather, due to the mass revelation at Sinai, we see that Moshe is a true prophet and thus any subsequent prophets have to be consistent with his criteria.</p>\n<p>The Rambam then brings 4 verses. These verses (as I understand the point of using so many) is to specifically address different types of claims about why, given the philosophical presentation in the previous chapter, some prophet trying to contradict what Moshe established should still be listened to.</p>\n<p>The first claim is \"The Torah itself allows for additions or subtractions at a subsequent time, so it is fully consistent to have them.\" Much like we in fact say the location of the Beis HaMikdash was revealed later. This the first verse shows is not the case \"Everything I command you that you shall be careful to do it. You shall neither add to it, nor subtract from it.\"</p>\n<p>The second claim is that the Torah itself (including the above verse) has a built in expiration. It only applies for some period of time and then stops being applicable, leaving space for someone else to come along. For that he quotes the next verse (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9993#v=28\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 29:28</a>) \"The hidden things belong to the Lord, our God, but the revealed things apply to us and to our children forever: that we must fulfill all the words of this Torah.\" The emphasis on the \"forever.\"</p>\n<p>The third claim is that although the Torah in general has no expiration date, this or that certain Mitzvah does and is given one by the Torah. For that he quotes \"[This is] an eternal statute for all your generations\" (Vayikra 3:17 and a bunch (7?) of other places).</p>\n<p>The fourth claim is that although the Torah is eternal, a Prophet can come along and tell us how to interpret it, and say \"this Mitzvah is not literal\" or \"this accepted interpretation is not valid\", for that he quotes the final verse (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9994#v=12\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 30:12</a>) \"It is not in heaven.\"</p>\n<p>So, to pick on an example that came up on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/33467/among-the-gentiles-why-job-and-bilaam-were-recognized-as-prophets-whereas-muham/33468#comment112473_33467\">this site</a> before, if a Muslim comes along and says that Moshe never commanded to not eat camel - first we have the philosophical point that we know that Moshe said it directly.</p>\n<p>If he then says, but Mohammed can come along and change that, we say \"nothing can be added or subtracted.\"</p>\n<p>If he says \"The Torah was only supposed to last until Mohammed came along\" then we say \"the revealed things apply to us and to our children forever.\"</p>\n<p>If he says \"The commandment to not eat camel was only until Mohammed\" we say every Mitvah is eternal.</p>\n<p>And if he says \"Well, you have the text all wrong\" or that doesn't mean camel it is a metaphor, it means a specific kind of other animal, or if the camel ate something specifically wrong, we say \"it is not in heaven\" a prophet can't come along and say that G-d said we got it wrong.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The basic requirement for a prophet (or just any Jew) is to not change anything written in the Torah (Including of course the Mitzvot). - See Rambam's Hilchot Yesod Torah Halacha Alef for that Halacha specifically for prophets.  </p>\n\n<p>Additionaly <strong>all</strong> that the prophet predicts must be true not just a part, and he should be checked many times (except for death, hunger etc. which God may cancel if the people do Teshuva). -  Rambam's Hilchot Yesod Torah Halacha Alef to Dalet.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hebrew Source</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In his introduction to his commentary on the Mishna, the Rambam writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>החלק הראשון, שיתנבא בשם האל, ויקרא ההמון להאמין בו, ויצווה על עבודתו, ויאמר שהקב\"ה הוסיף במצות מצווה, או גרע מצווה מכלל המצות שאסף אותם ספר התורה. ואין הפרש בין שיוסיף ויגרע על הפסוק, ובין שיוסיף ויגרע על הפירוש המקובל. \n  ועניין שיוסיף או יגרע מן הכתוב, כגון שיאמר, שהקב\"ה אמר אלי כי הערלה היא שתי שנים, ואחר שתי שנים מותר לאכול הפירות הנטועות. או שיאמר, שהקב\"ה אמר אלי, שהערלה אסור לאכול אותה ד' שנים, חלף מה שאמר הקב\"ה (ויקרא יט), שלוש שנים יהיה לכם ערלים, וכדומה לו. \n  או ישנה בקבלה כלום, ואפילו יסייענו פשט הכתוב. כגון שיאמר, שזה האמור בתורה (דברים כה), וקצותה את כפה, הוא כריתת יד באמת, ואינו קנס המבייש, כמו שבא בקבלה, ויסמוך הדבר ההוא לנבואה, ויאמר שהקב\"ה אמר לי, שזו המצווה שאמר, וקצותה את כפה, הוא כפשוטו, גם זה יהרג בחנק, שהוא נביא שקר, והוא סומך אל הקב\"ה מה שלא אמר לו. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although he doesn't write his source (the Rambam rarely did..), the Rambam says that any prophet who claims to change the Torah, or even a Halacha that we received through tradition (earlier he claims that even if a prophet claims to Pasken Halacha through prophecy he is a false prophet.) is a false prophet.</p>\n\n<p>However, it should be noted that R.

The problem is due to the fact that birds are relatively stupid.  Whereas, if I moved your house a short distance from its current location, you would obviously look for it and quickly find it, birds don't work this way.  If a mother bird is out looking for food, then returns to the location of the nest and finds it missing, she will not look around for it;  she will simply assume that it has ceased to exist, and will leave the area.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Relocating an active nest is not an option.

The good news is that you don't have to wait very long.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://birding.about.com/od/birdhouses/a/Removing-Bird-Nests.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wait until the nest is empty, or at least until the eggs have hatched and the fledglings have left the nest</a> - it would be even better if you waited until the entire early summer breeding season has ended. This won't take very long - <a href=\"http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/faq/nesting_info\" rel=\"nofollow\">on average, the total time between the eggs being laid and the fledglings becoming mature enough to leave the nest is about 4-6 weeks</a>. After the babies are grown and leave their parents and the nest, you can either destroy the nest outright or move it to a more convenient location. The important thing is that you don't disturb the nest while it still contains eggs and/or juvenile birds.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Relocating Nesting Birds</p>\n  \n  <p>These instructions are for Starlings and House Sparrows only.

Waiting those 4-5 weeks for the babies to grow and fledge is the kindest way to deal with the situation.</p>\n  \n  <p>When “waiting it out” is not possible, in the case of House Sparrows and Starlings only, it may be possible to relocate the nestlings into a temporary nest box as close as possible to the original site, to allow the parent birds to finish raising their babies. After all the birds leave the nest, the nest box should be taken down and discarded. The original nest site must be made inaccessible to other House Sparrows and Starlings, or they will nest there again.<br>\n  - <a href=\"http://theraptortrust.org/nesting/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Raptor Trust</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are also legal reasons to leave the nest alone - in many places, including the <a href=\"http://theraptortrust.org/nesting/\" rel=\"nofollow\">U.S.</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sviva.gov.il/English/Legislation/Documents/Wildlife%20Protection%20Laws%20and%20Regulations/WildlifeProtectionLaw1955.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Israel</a>, it is actually a crime to tamper with active songbird nests.</p>\n\n<p>As you said, the question is not a matter of Halacha, but a matter of mercy and compassion.

Samson Raphael Hirsch, who was an eminent Torah scholar, and strictly observant of Torah law, wrote about bal tashchit with a passion and expansiveness that was, even for him, remarkable. For example, in the description of bal taschit published in his seminal book <em>Horeb</em>, Hirsch writes: </p>\n  \n  <p>\"And from this [the prohibition of bal tashchit] you should hear the warning of G-d: - <em>Do not corrupt or destroy anything</em> and apply it to your whole life and to every being which is subordinated to you, from the earth which bears them all to the garment which you have already transformed into your cover. <strong>Do not corrupt or destroy anything is the first and most general call of The Creator</strong>, which comes to you, Man, when you realize yourself as master of the earth. All round you, you perceive earth and plant and animal, already bearing your imprint from your technical human skill. They have been transformed by your human hand for your human purposes, into dwelling-place and clothing, food and instruments, and you have taken them as your property....<strong>Only if you use the things around you for wise human purposes, sanctified by the word of My Torah, only then are you a Man and have the right over them which I have given you as a Man. However, if you use them unwisely, be it the greatest or the smallest, you commit treachery against My world, you commit murder and robbery against My property, you sin against Me!</strong>\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Therefore the sages say, he who in his wrath tears his clothes, breaks his vessels to pieces, or scatters his money, should in your eyes be as one who has worshipped idols... <strong>And in truth, there is no one nearer to idolatry than he who can disregard the fact that things are property of The Creator, and who presumes also to have the right, since he has the might, to destroy them according to his presumptuous will. He is already serving the most powerful idol in his inward self- anger, pride, above all his ego, which in its passion regards itself as the master of all things</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Hirsch likewise writes, in his commentary on the Torah (on Deuteronomy 20:20):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"But the prohibition of purposeless destruction of fruit trees around a besieged city is only to be taken as an example of general wastefulness. Under the concept of bal tashchit the <strong>purposeless destruction of anything at all is taken to be forbidden, so that the lo tashchit [don‘t destroy] of our text becomes the most comprehensive warning to human beings not to misuse the position which The Creator has given them as masters of the world and its matter to capricious, passionate, or merely thoughtless wasteful destruction of anything on earth. Only for wise use has The Creator laid the world at our feet when He said to Man ―subdue the world and have dominion over it\"</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Midrash from Kohelet (Ecclesiastes) Rabba:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"When G-d created the first man he took him and showed him all the trees of the Garden of Eden and said to him \"See my works, how beautiful and praiseworthy they are. And everything that I created, I created it for you. <strong>Be careful not to spoil or destroy my world</strong> – for if you do, there will be nobody after you to repair it.\"   </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Sefer HaChinuch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"This is the way of the pious and elevated people; they love peace and rejoice in the good for other people, and to bring them near to God‘s way. <strong>They will not [needlessly] destroy <em>even a mustard seed</em>, and they are distressed at every ruination and spoilage they see. If they are able to save, they will save anything from destruction with all of their power. Not so, however, are the wicked, the brethren of destructive forces that rejoice at the destruction of the world, until they themselves become destroyed</strong>...\"    </p>\n  \n  <p>The Sefer HaChinuch clearly links pious and elevated behavior with what might today be called \"eco-friendly\" or at least 'environmentally-responsible'. The 'wicked' he describes as acting in a way that is very destructive to the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Moshe Cordovero (1522-1570):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"<strong>One‘s mercy should extend over all creations, not to treat them disrespectfully or destroy them.  For the Higher Wisdom is spread upon all creations, [including] inanimate matter, plants, live creatures and people</strong>. And for this reason, we are warned against treating food disrespectfully. Along these lines, it is befitting that just as <strong>the Higher Wisdom does not disdain any creature, and causes everything, as it is written: 'You made them all with wisdom' (Psalms 104:24), so should man‘s mercy be upon all The Creator‘s works</strong>... Along these lines, a person should not treat anything disrespectfully, for all were made with wisdom. He should not uproot a plant except where necessary, and <strong>he should not cause the death of a living creature except where necessary, in which case he should ensure them an easy death, with a checked [properly sharpened] knife, to be as merciful as possible</strong>. This is the general principle: <strong>Having compassion on every being, in order not to destroy them is dependent on wisdom.</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Avraham Isaiah Karelitz (1878-1953), one of the leading halachic authorities of the twentieth century, writes that even those animals not normally considered beneficial to man contribute, at least subliminally, to mans existence:   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Animals are of utility to man, such as an ox for a yoke and a donkey for a burden, and they prepare food for man, milk and eggs, and from some of them we obtain wool to wear, and some of them are themselves food for people. They were created as different kinds and as many species, and the food of each is different. <strong>Some of them people do not benefit from, such as predatory animals, and snakes, and vermin, and insects; however they possess sublime necessity and benefit. Sometimes man is punished by way of them, and sometimes man learns wisdom and ethics from them. We are already used to their existence, and we feel that without them the world would be lacking, and the world is not beautiful and perfect except when there are predatory animals in it</strong>.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>From these words, it appears that according to some halachic authorities, all animals are of at least potential benefit to man. Therefore, intentionally killing or damaging any animal without sufficient need may violate the prohibition of bal tashchit. </p>\n  \n  <p>Animals – The Talmud considers the unnecessary killing of animals to be a violation of bal tashchit. For example, the <strong>Talmudic sage Rebbi refused to destroy a certain type of animal living on his property, despite the potential danger they posed, because he considered killing them to be a violation of bal tashchit</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>The condition \"may be of benefit\" requires further clarification. One could argue that virtually everything in nature is of at least potential benefit to humans, and therefore may be included within the prohibition of bal tashchit.

Thus, for instance, we kill animals for meat/clothing even though they inevitably suffer in the process. Removing a nuisance is no less an overriding need. (Otherwise, one would no be allowed to kill a mosquito.) (If you're question was with regard to the <em>mitzva</em> of <em>shiluach haken</em> [sending the mother from the nest] that is a commandment regarding sending the mother bird before taking the eggs/young, and isn't an issue regarding just getting rid of the bird and nest entirely.) At the end of the day, AYLOR.</p>\n\n<p>Based on your update I would agree with @scimonster's comment to relocate the nest if that's remotely practical. (Note: I've heard birds won't return to the nest once you remove it so you might be accomplishing nothing.) The <em>hashkafic</em> principle of <em>tzaar baalei chayim</em> would certainly apply (see, e.g. the Ramban's explanation of the <em>taymeh dikra</em> [logic behind the verse] about creating compassionate <em>middot</em> [personality traits].) However, going to such an extreme extent for this one Torah ideal at the expense of other more important ones (such as <em>Talmud Torah</em> which is equated to all the mitzvot) seems to be an inversion of what the Torah really represents. So it really depends on how much effort would be entailed in trying to accomplish both ideals and how productive such an effort is actually likely to be.</p>\n\n\n",

The rest of the nations followed the patrilineal system, according to which he would have been Egyptian. Choosing to be Jewish was his \"conversion\", in a way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה שאמר בת\"כ (פרשה יד א): בתוך בני ישראל, מלמד שנתגייר, אינו שיצטרך בגירות, אלא ככל ישראל שנכנסו לברית במילה וטבילה והרצאת דמים בשעת מתן תורה (כריתות ט א), אבל נתכוונו לומר שהלך אחרי אמו ונדבק בישראל. וזה טעם \"בתוך בני ישראל\", שהיה עימהם ולא רצה ללכת אחרי אביו להיות מצרי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Chizkuni has an alternate opinion (which Ramban rejects -- see the link above for the full text with his reasoning).

This also makes the reference explicitly to the argument that he was not part of the tribe of the mother which would not have been affected by the revelation.</p>\n<p>Note that the normal conversion case means that the convert is like a \"newborn\" and is not technically related to anyone (even his immediate relatives who also converted).

In this case, the relationship that was restored was the case of not belonging to his mother's tribe.</p>\n<p>ראבד says that the reference is to the <strong>father</strong> who converted as part of the Eirev Rav after he was born.

    "content": "# Is signing G-d's Holy name in casual conversation a violation of mentioning His name in vain?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (6:3) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אסור להוציא שם שמים לבטלה וכל המוציא שם שמים לבטלה עובר על מצות עשה\n  דכתיב את ה' אלהיך תירא ... <strong>ולא לבד בלשון הקודש אסור אלא אפילו בכל\n  לשון אסור</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>It is forbidden to say G-d's name (lit.

It is not just in (Hebrew) the Holy Tongue, that (mentioning the\n  Name) is forbidden, but even <strong>in any language</strong> it is forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this context of stating \"any\" language, is this restricted to verbal language, or is sign language included?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If it is forbidden to <em>speak</em> God's name in vain, and it is forbidden to desecrate God's name in the <em>writing</em> of any language (MB  85:10), then it seems obvious that it is forbidden to irreverently sign God in conversation. The simple idea is about the respect we give in referring to our Creator. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, if you wanted to look down the pilpul glass, then it's important to note that the issue of determining the status of sign language as a halakhic language is an evolving one. This question has particular contemporary significance for the religious participation of deaf people. A good introduction into the changing status of how halakha understands sign language is a <a href=\"http://www.rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IDI-Marriage-in-Sign-Language.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">responsum written last year</a> by R. Benjamin Lau on conducting weddings for the deaf. He argues that the advances and sophistication of modern sign language perforce changes the status of deaf people from that of feeble-mindedness, as understood during the Talmudic Era, to that of intelligence. In doing this, R. Lau argues that sign language should now be considered a full language, and he quotes other authorities who agree with him (such as Chief Rabbi of Israel David Lau) and those who do not consider sign language a natural, normal language (R. Yaakov Ariel).  </p>\n\n<p>So at the moment, while there is not a consensus as to the halakhic status of sign language as a language, it seems to be evolving toward greater recognition. Perhaps this prevents us from answering the question (although I still believe the spirit of the halakha should be accounted for here). </p>\n\n<p>P.S. As someone who studied sign language, I personally find that it completely parallels speech in terms of communication. In ASL, the word God is, like spoken English, a general term used by many kinds of religious and secular people (as opposed to the Jewish term HaShem). In Hebrew sign language, the word for HaShem is made pointing the index finger upward toward the sky. This recalls the signing used in the Talmud (Br. 48a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אביי ורבא הוו יתבי קמיה דרבה, אמר להו רבה: למי מברכין? אמרי ליה: לרחמנא. - ורחמנא היכא יתיב? רבא אחוי לשמי טללא, אביי נפק לברא אחוי כלפי שמיא.</p>\n  \n  <p>Abaye and Rava, when they were children, were seated before Rabba. Raba said to them: To whom does one recite blessings? They said to him: To the All Merciful. Rabba asked them: And where does the All-Merciful reside? Rava pointed to the ceiling. Abaye went outside and pointed toward the heaven. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

By removing the foreskin, the Egyptians lost their symbol of promiscuity. Yosef intended that circumcision would thus temper the promiscuity within Egyptian society. </p>\n\n<p>Another suggestion of the <em>Y'fei To'ar</em> is that Yosef wanted to make it easier for exceptional individuals who would later decide to convert and join the Jewish people. Because the ordeal of a circumcision can be a difficult hurdle for a prospective convert to surmount, Yosef forced all Egyptians to be circumcised to remove an obstacle from the path of individuals who would want to convert.</p>\n\n<p>The Maharazu (<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UZoqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1049#v=onepage&q&f=false\">91:5</a>) provides an alternative explanation for Yosef's decree. He says that divine blessing and salvation from famine came to Egypt and the surrounding countries via Yosef's extraordinary merit, which derived from his repulsing the advances of Potiphar's wife.

    "title": "Is there a reason or pattern as to when the Torah uses אֵת instead of אֶת?",
    "content": "# Is there a reason or pattern as to when the Torah uses אֵת instead of אֶת?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I noticed a mix of the two forms of the Hebrew objective marker commonly pronounced  אֶת. in the Torah. (There is no English translation of this word. It is used only to notify that an object follows this word.) Usually the word אֶת is used with a <em>segol</em>, but there are some places where אֵת, with a <em>tzere</em> is used. An example follows: </p>\n\n<p>Exodus 35:13-15 (The 3 verses are cited together, and a colon separates each of them):</p>\n\n<p>אֶת־הַשֻּׁלְחָ֥ן וְאֶת־בַּדָּ֖יו וְאֶת־כָּל־כֵּלָ֑יו <strong>וְאֵ֖ת</strong> לֶ֥חֶם הַפָּנִֽים׃ וְאֶת־מְנֹרַ֧ת הַמָּא֛וֹר וְאֶת־כֵּלֶ֖יהָ וְאֶת־נֵרֹתֶ֑יהָ <strong>וְאֵ֖ת</strong> שֶׁ֥מֶן הַמָּאֽוֹר׃ וְאֶת־מִזְבַּ֤ח הַקְּטֹ֙רֶת֙ וְאֶת־בַּדָּ֔יו <strong>וְאֵת֙</strong> שֶׁ֣מֶן הַמִּשְׁחָ֔ה <strong>וְאֵ֖ת</strong> קְטֹ֣רֶת הַסַּמִּ֑ים וְאֶת־מָסַ֥ךְ הַפֶּ֖תַח לְפֶ֥תַח הַמִּשְׁכָּֽן׃</p>\n\n<p>Is there any reason for using אֵת, which is less common? Some thoughts that I have excluded:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>End of verse only? No, b/c verse 15 has it in the middle of the verse.</li>\n<li>Used only when the next word is a noun followed by another noun that has a definite article (in Hebrew, הַ) which acts as an adjective, as in אֵ֖ת לֶ֥חֶם הַפָּנִֽים׃ ? No, b/c The beginning of verse 14 starts וְאֶת־מְנֹרַ֧ת הַמָּא֛וֹר which has the similar construct, but uses the word אֶת </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are the only 2 patterns that I could think of. Are there any other possible reasons or is this just based on <em>mesora</em> and there is no reason at all?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 22)\n\n<p>When the word stands on its own, with its own trup-mark, it's אֵת, with a <em>tzeireh</em>. When it's attached to the next word with a dash and therefore does not have its own trup-mark, it's אֶת, with a <em>segol</em>. I think I learned this in high school; unfortunately, I don't know a more precise source.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what would be the underlying reason behind some instances getting their own trup-mark and some not. It might have to do with putting a little bit more emphasis on the <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%AA#Hebrew\">direct-object status</a> of what follows.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>The word by itself is אֵת. When the word is \"joined\" with the next word by a makaf (־), the phrase is treated as one long word, and there is no longer an accent on the first syllable. Unaccented closed syllables (unlike <em>accented</em> closed syllables) take short vowels, so the vowel shifts to its shorter counterpart: tzere -> segol.</p>\n<p>You can also see this same phenomenon in the words <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0101.htm#21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">כל</a> (cholom -> kamatz katan), <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0206.htm#15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בן</a> (tzere -> segol), <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0221.htm#11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שלש</a> (cholom -> kamatz katan), <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0144.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">כן</a>  (tzere -> segol), <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0230.htm#23\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">קנמם</a>  (cholom -> kamatz katan), <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0121.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שם</a> (tzere -> segol) etc.</p>\n<p>Of course, as with any rule, there are exceptions.

In addition, it could be said—Bnei Yisrael spent all their time and so much hard physical labor for Hashem and all this melacha was indeed turned to Avodah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>a video shiur on the topic (17 minutes):\n<a href=\"http://www.torahanytime.com/video/avoda-vs-melacha-regarding-shabbat/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.torahanytime.com/video/avoda-vs-melacha-regarding-shabbat/</a></p>\n\n<p>and an audio one (33 minutes):\n<a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/743139/Rabbi_Aaron_Soloveichik/The_Difference_Between_Avoda_and_Melacha\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/743139/Rabbi_Aaron_Soloveichik/The_Difference_Between_Avoda_and_Melacha</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The distinction between the two ranges from the legalistic dimension (as melacha is a particular category of behaviors) to the spiritual to the linguistic (with \"avodah\" also a word meaning \"worship\" (sort of) ).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.39.42?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Kli_Yakar_on_Exodus.39.43.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kli Yakar</a> on parshas Pekudei brings a distinction based on the construction of the Mishkan...</p>\n<p>In Shemos 39:42-43 it writes the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כְּכֹ֛ל אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּ֥ה ה' אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֑ה כֵּ֤ן עָשׂוּ֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אֵ֖ת כׇּל־<strong>הָעֲבֹדָֽה</strong>׃\nוַיַּ֨רְא מֹשֶׁ֜ה אֶת־כׇּל־<strong>הַמְּלָאכָ֗ה</strong> וְהִנֵּה֙ עָשׂ֣וּ אֹתָ֔הּ כַּאֲשֶׁ֛ר צִוָּ֥ה ה' כֵּ֣ן עָשׂ֑וּ וַיְבָ֥רֶךְ אֹתָ֖ם מֹשֶֽׁה׃ {פ}</p>\n<p>Just as Hashem had commanded Moshe, so the Bnei Yisrael had done all the work.

However, the expression of \"Melacha\" fall into the category of work of heaven and earth - i.e. something that one does for themselves we call \"melacha\" - as we find with the creation of the world where it writes: \"And G-d completed on the seventh day His work (melacha)\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, \"avodah\" expresses individualised servant-master based work, whereas the term \"melacha\" is something that is more self-serving. Hashem as it were, created for Himself a world.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.39.42?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chatam_Sofer_on_Torah%2C_Pekudei.9&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chasam Sofer</a> on the same verse writes an alternative approach:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>י\"ל כי מלאכה פירושו מה שעשו עושי המלאכה מעשה בפועל בידיהם והעבודה היינו נדבת ישראל מלבם</p>\n<p>\"Melacha\" means what the workers did, an actual work with their hands, and \"avodah\" means the offering of Israel from their hearts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in the context of the Mishkan, it means that “melacha” refers to the physical exertion, the toil that they did with their hands etc., while “avodah” refers to the effort, the motivation in their heart, even without action.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The common problem with traditional commentaries is that all of them cherry-pick verses to fit their conclusions.

Originally tied to agency or mission then extended to work performed under authority (e.g., divine command in Exodus 36:1). And finally, in Biblical Hebrew, מלאכה often implies purposeful, skilled labor (e.g., Tabernacle craftsmanship, Exodus 31:5).</p>\n\n\n",

I think that usually כָל הָעָם (all the people) means <em>all</em> the people, but here Moshe has only summoned the elders.  So does the \"all\" here mean the elders, perhaps answering <em>on behalf of</em> all the people?  Or was there a gap between the verses in which the elders relay the message to the people and gain their ascent, which nonetheless happens in unison?  Or was this said in front of everybody -- Moshe summoned the elders to him but this was in the hearing of everybody and they jumped in to respond?</p>\n\n<p>Rashi doesn't say anything about this point, nor did any of the chumashim we had at the table at torah study this morning where this question came up.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not asking about  נַעֲשֶׂה וְנִשְׁמָע a few chapters later, but specifically about the exchange before <em>matan torah</em>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <em>M'chilta</em> (<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/mehilta/shmot19.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Masechta d'BaChodesh</em> §2</a>) indicates that \"all the people\" in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0219.htm#8\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Sh'mos</em> 19:8</a> refers to the entire nation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויבא משה ויקרא לזקני העם - \n  מגיד שמשה חלק כבוד לזקנים...\n  אשר צוה ה' - \n  אף לנשים אמור. ויענו כל העם יחדו -\n  לא ענו בחנופה ולא קבלו זה מזה אלא השוו כלם לב אחד ואמרו: כל אשר דבר ה' נעשה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"And Moshe came and called to the elders of the nation\" (<em>Sh'mos</em> 19:7) - This indicates that Moshe extended honor to the elders. \"That HaShem commanded\" - that this also be said to the women. \"And all the nation replied in unison\" - They did not reply with obsequiousness, nor did they request permission from each other before speaking.

However, the people of Israel did not wait for any advice or decisions from the elders. Rather, they immediately spoke up in unison and agreed to follow HaShem's commands. </p>\n\n<p>The Abarbanel (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40216&st=&pgnum=65\" rel=\"nofollow\">commentary on <em>Sh'mos</em> 19:3</a>) agrees with the explanation of the <em>M'chilta</em>, that Moshe focused his address to the elders to honor them. However, disagreeing with the Ramban, he specifies that Moshe spoke only in the presence of the elders, reasoning that it was impractical for Moshe to directly address the entire congregation. Thus, says the Abarbanel, Moshe instructed the elders to relate HaShem's message to the people. The people, responding enthusiastically that they would follow HaShem's commands, did not reply to the elders but rather converged on Moshe and gave their affirmation directly and en masse. </p>\n\n\n",

For Moshe Rabbeinu was the most humble of all men and was surely not bothered, nevertheless Miriam was still punished with tzaraas.</p>\n\n<p>The Chafetz Chaim supports this opinion with the words of the Rambam (טומאה צרעת טז-י): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הרי הוא אומר התבוננו מה אירע למרים הנביאה שדיברה באחיה שהיתה גדולה\n  ממנו בשנים וגידלתו על ברכיה וסכנה בעצמה להצילו מן הים והיא לא דברה\n  בגנותו אלא טעתה שהשותו לשאר נביאים והוא לא הקפיד על כל הדברים האלו\n  שנאמר והאיש משה ענו מאד ואע''פ כן מיד נענשה בצרעת קל וחומר לבני אדם\n  הרשעים הטפשים שמרבים לדבר גדולות ונפלאות.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, we see that despite the fact that the person doesn't care that lashon harah is being spoken about them, nonetheless it is still prohibited.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>You cannot <em>really</em> know if the other person minds; he might be saying he doesn't mind out of a desire to avoid conflict, for example.

This is mentioned in the Mishna and Gemara on Shabbos 42a, and codified in the Tur and Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim siman 318 siff 9.</p>\n\n<p>So for instance if you realize you don't have enough soup for all your guests, you may not remove the pot from the fire and add more water. This is assur even without putting the pot back on the flame, as the soup is in a kli rishon.</p>\n\n<p>My question concerns Yom Tov. Does this prohibition apply to cases where cooking on Yom Tov is prohibited? See Shulchan Aruch siman 503 1 where we see it is not allowed to cook on one day of Yom Tov for the next. See also siman  512 for instances where cooking for certain people is not allowed, and even adding food to an already cooking pot is not allowed. </p>\n\n<p>So in the aforementioned example, would putting the cold water in the soup pot which is not on the fire be allowed on Yom Tov?</p>\n\n<p>Do to the nature of this question, I would prefer sourced answers.</p>\n\n<p>What I've seen so far is the Rosh Yosef on the sugya who would have liked to assume the prohibition was  midirabanan. We could've built off this and say the prohibition was not extended to Yom Tov. However, the Rosh Yosef goes on to say the implications from the gemara and Beis Yosef are that it is a biblically prohibited act. I'm not clear what his implications are, but if it is biblical, I would assume there is no room to be lenient on Yom Tov.</p>\n\n\n",

The Mishnah rules Reuven must give the full amount to both plantiffs.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemarah notes that it seems that the court will take money from Reuven to give to each plantiff, even though there is doubt whether Reuven owes the money to each one. We do not say, \"keep the money in the possession (<em>chazakah</em>) of the most recent owner [Reuven].\"</p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains that we are rejecting the following logic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When this one (e.g. Shimon) claims and this one (Reuven) says \"I don't know whether I owe you or your friend (Levi),\" keep the money in the <em>chazakah</em> of this defendent (Reuven) so we won't make him lose his money (by paying both Shimon and Levi). Instead, leave the money until Eliyahu comes and determines whom to pay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, when we have a doubt about money, we often apply the principle of <em>chazakah</em>, that the money should stay by its most recent owner, and not take it away because of a doubt.

So what would we do now if this case or another such case were to arise? In particular, I am interested in what would happen if the brother the חירש were married considering the modern obligation (on Ashkenazim, at least) to remain monogamous? חליצה seems to be out of the question. So does he do יבום? A חירש is unable to divorce his יבמה after the fact, so does he have to divorce his wife and then do יבום? Perhaps the יבמה simply remains unmarried for the rest of her life like an aguna (this is what I suspect is the case).

One could pay a private visit, before and\\or after the ceremony, bring a nice gift, explain, if relevant why he could not attend or alternatively, find a \"good excuse\" for not attending, such that will minimize the inconvenience.</p>\n\n<p>One view that is less strict is the Maharam Shik on Orach Chaim (71) who says that in great need there might be a Heter to enter such a synagogue (not during a prayer of course), and he states some conditions to that, e.g. when several enter together etc.</p>\n\n<p>It is of the utmost importance to try our best to keep peace and good relations with all fellow jews, even those who have strayed off the path of the Tora.</p>\n\n<p>If you read Hebrew, you can see more details in \n <a href=\"http://www.din.org.il/2012/11/16/%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%AA-%D7%A8%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%99/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the following Q&A</a></p>\n\n\n",

(See <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> Siman <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%96#.D7.A1.D7.99.D7.9E.D7.9F_.D7.A7.D7.A0.D7.96_.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">157:1</a> and <em>Elya Rabbah</em> Siman 170:23 what he quotes from the <em>Shl\"a</em>.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Neither the blog nor the Rambam nor any of the other poskim mentioned talk about secretive food concocting.  But some of them do encourage every Jew to eat in a dignified manner.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong>  Other sources also discuss ideas which may be relevant.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong>  \"One is forbidden to eat any food that most people find disgusting even if one happens to enjoy it.<sup>[6]</sup>  Foods which most people do enjoy though a significant minority of the population will consider disgusting may be eaten.<sup>[7]</sup>\"  —R' Ari Enkin.  <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2012/06/disgusting-behavior/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Disgusting Behavior\"</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong>  \"Rabbi [Yehuda haNasi] said: What is the proper path a person should choose for himself?

Probably translated by R' Dovid Rosenfeld.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine an imaginary young man named Reuven. Sometimes, when he's alone, Reuven likes to eat bizarre food concoctions. To see some examples, hover your mouse over this spoiler box:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">\n  <p> • A bowl of corn flakes and barbecue-flavored potato chips with milk.<br /><br />\n • A sandwich made of bread, hummus, and soy sauce.<br /><br />\n • Or an entire meal made up solely of peanut butter (eaten from a plate using a spoon).<br /><br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Reuven's case, this \"secretive food concocting\" isn't a sign of any serious eating disorder.  True, Reuven is a bit overweight, but he doesn't suffer from anorexia or bulimia.  He just likes odd food combinations sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this question, let's define \"secretive food concocting\" as the eating of food combinations which would make the majority of observant American Jews lose their appetites.</p>\n\n<p>I propose that perhaps secretive food concocting is undignified and therefore not a good thing for an observant Jew to engage in — even in private.  So:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there any halachic problem with Reuven's secretive food concocting?</p></li>\n<li><p>Even if there's no halachic problem, does the Torah nevertheless discourage the behavior?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It would be good if you could please cite decisors who have ruled directly upon these matters.

He relates this to being a prohibition of Leviticus 11:43:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אַל־תְּשַׁקְּצוּ֙ אֶת־נַפְשֹׁ֣תֵיכֶ֔ם</p>\n  \n  <p>You shall not make yourselves detestable</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I searched the various commentaries and <em>Beur Hagr\"a</em> (commentary 19) cites from <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38247&st=&pgnum=117\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot D'Rav Natan ch. 26, near the end</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האוכל אוכלין <strong>שאיגם עולים על גופו</strong> עובר משום ג׳ לאוין שביזה א ת עצמו\n  וביזה א ת\n  האוכלין ומברך ברכה שאינה כתיקונה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My loose translation:</p>\n\n<p>\"Someone who eats foods that are not \"appropriate?\" for his body (I could use help translating the bolded words, above) transgresses 3 negatives - he embarrasses himself, the food, and recites an inappropriate blessing.\"</p>\n\n<p>Point is - from what I can tell, based on commentaries in both Shulcha Aruch and what I saw in Avot D'Rav Natan, this does not refer to odd food combos. It refers more to how the food is eaten, i.e. not to eat food mixed with dirt, vomit, etc.</p>\n\n<p>What you cited, presents a separate issue. Secretive food concocting may not be an eating disorder, but it is a mental disorder (based on the Wikipedia link that you provided. I am unaware if this is a voluntary habit done by \"normal\" people who have no mental disorder.) People with mental disorders may be considered an <em>ones</em>, meaning that they are not responsible for many of their actions. In a case like this, continuing this habit <strong>might</strong> be considered <em>refu'ah</em> for them, i.e. it may be \"therapeutic\", as it may help them resolve other more serious mental problems. I'm no psychologist, but, I'm suggesting this as a possibility. If the other mental problem is life threatening, and say, he won't eat at all w/o concocting this strange stuff, then this is certainly permissible. But, perhaps, it's permissible to him even if not life threatening.</p>\n\n<p>This area seems to be a special case that I think needs more research. I think I would consult not just with any Rav — I would instead would speak with a rabbi who's studied psychology, or with a Rav who has access to a psychologist. Perhaps <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_J._Twerski\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Twerski</a> would be a good person to relay your question to.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>אָסְרוּ חֲכָמִים מַאֲכָלוֹת וּמַשְׁקִין שֶׁנֶּפֶשׁ רֹב בְּנֵי אָדָם קִהָה מֵהֶן כְּגוֹן מַאֲכָלוֹת וּמַשְׁקִין שֶׁנִּתְעָרֵב בָּהֶן קִיא אוֹ צוֹאָה וְלֵחָה סְרוּחָה וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶן. וְכֵן אָסְרוּ חֲכָמִים לֶאֱכל וְלִשְׁתּוֹת בְּכֵלִים הַצּוֹאִים שֶׁנַּפְשׁוֹ שֶׁל אָדָם מִתְאוֹנֶנֶת מֵהֶם. כְּגוֹן כְּלֵי בֵּית הַכִּסֵּא וּכְלֵי זְכוּכִית שֶׁל סַפָּרִין שֶׁגּוֹרְעִין בָּהֶם אֶת הַדָּם וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶן:</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam and Shulchan Aruch are talking about items which <em>are</em> disgusting, not items which <em>taste</em> disgusting. Dog meat, human carcasses, or beetles probably do not taste that bad (I wouldn't know), but they are repulsive things to eat. Similarly, a clean chamber pot will not affect the taste of the food, but is totally repulsive to use to cook your dinner. </p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, once is permitted to eat jellybeans in disgusting flavors.

Sure, I might think it's strange to eat plain peanut butter, or mix my cornflakes with potato chips. But there is nothing inherently disgusting about any of these mixtures. The taste might be strange, but, as they say, that's a matter of taste. And what about if someone would decide to mix raw fish with seaweed and a little rice? Now that's a weird concoction if there ever was one.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Enkin seems to be taking it further. However, it is not so clear from the article he writes what is the issur of bal teshaketzu and what is merely an inyan of derech eretz. It's hard to determine exactly what is meant from a Torah article in a newspaper or online. </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "If a gentile undergoes a non-orthodox conversion, and proceeds to keep the Sabbath, is he sinning?",
    "content": "# If a gentile undergoes a non-orthodox conversion, and proceeds to keep the Sabbath, is he sinning?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Firstly, I am an ignorant gentile and am new to contributing to Stack Exchange, so I apologise in advance for any mistakes or missteps. </p>\n\n<p>It is my understanding that a gentile who keeps certain mitzvot (eg keeping the Sabbath fully) is sinning. It is also my understanding that, from an orthodox perspective, a Reform or Conservative conversion is quite meaningless, as if nothing has happened. Am I right, therefore, in inferring that a Conservative (for example) convert who kept these mitzvot would be a sinning gentile?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Let me start by quoting Maimonides (Ty @Yishai) who is discussing an inadvertent transgression of a gentile of one of the Seven Noahide laws, which are punishable by human court. <a href=\"http://m.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188355/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://m.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188355/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-10.htm</a> </p>\n\n<p>\"A gentile who inadvertently violates one of his commandments is exempt from all punishment with the exception of a person who kills inadvertently. In such an instance, the redeemer of the blood is not executed for slaying the killer, nor may the latter seek asylum in a city of refuge. However, the court will not execute him.</p>\n\n<p>When does the above apply? When he inadvertently violates a command without sinful intention; for example a person who engages in relations with his colleague's wife under the impression that she is his own wife or unmarried.</p>\n\n<p>If, however, one knew that she was his colleague's wife, but did not know that she was forbidden to him or it occurred to him that this act was permitted or one killed without knowing that it is forbidden to kill, he is considered close to having sinned intentionally and is executed. This is not considered as an inadvertent violation. For he should have learned the obligations incumbent upon him and did not.\"</p>\n\n<p>In this interesting case you have presented, the gentile will be keeping the Sabbath by the type of  accident which is not punishable, being that he kept the Sabbath under a false pretence of having converted, similar to \"a person who engages in relations with his colleague's wife under the impression that she is his own wife or unmarried\".</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that keeping the Sabbath is a heavenly offence not punishable by human courts, so this idea may not hold true.  </p>\n\n<p>One more idea found in commentaries dissection of Miamonides words in the aforementioned chapter, halcha #9 which would have an impact here is the following: Rambam writes \"The general principle governing these matters is: They are not to be allowed to originate a new religion or create mitzvot for themselves based on their own decisions. They may either become righteous converts and accept all the mitzvot or retain their statutes without adding or detracting from them\". </p>\n\n<p>Some of the commentaries take this idea very literally and therefore believe that the only prohibition is when the gentile is acting this way to create a Mitzvah.  The Imrei Yosher points out that a gentile who wants to convert, but has not as of yet may actually keep the Sabbath, being that he is keeping it as future Jew, not as an inventor of something new. This however is not the common practice AFAIK. Future converts are told to desecrate the Sabbath until conversion. However, this is a valid opinion upon which one can probably rely when stuck in a situation.</p>\n\n<p>As a matter of practical advice though, I would point to a similar but not analogous situation brought in the footnotes of the work Mitzvos Hashem, a work dedicated to laws concerning gentiles, page 460.  A person who is questionably Jewish, such as a foundling, will have to act on the Sabbath in a way to keep it as a possible Jew, or desecrate it as a possible Non-Jew. There are a number of options based on various opinions.*</p>\n\n<p>1) He should perform work in the contemporary sense, but not one that is based on the 39 forbidden acts. In accordance with the latter authorities who argue with Mishna Limelech chapter 10 of Hilchos Melachim halcha 2.</p>\n\n<p>2) He should do one of the forbidden acts before evening of Friday and after nightfall Saturday. In accordance with Panim Yafos in Noach who says night follows day for gentiles. </p>\n\n<p>3) He should wear tzitzis in a public domain which is allowed for a Jew but would be considered carrying for a NonJew in accordance with Chassam Soffer.</p>\n\n<p>4) Or he suggests doing a half of a forbidden act, for 'amounts', shiurim, were given to Jews alone.</p>\n\n<p>Any of these would seemingly alleviate the issue at hand, but it is not analogous as the orthodox would not consider an unorthodox conversion as even questionable.</p>\n\n<p>*This particular issue is also addressed in Minchas Chinuch towards the end of mitzvah 32. The Shabsi Frenkel mafteach also brings sources for this on the aforementioned chapter in Maimonides.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Conservative Judaism is a movement that began in the 19th-20th centuries as an offshoot of the Reform movement that sought to overturn traditional Jewish practice and belief. It rejects what are generally considered to be the fundamental tenets of traditional (i.e. \"Orthodox\") Judaism (e.g. the 13 principles of faith of Maimonides). Therefore, the consensus of traditional Jewish authorities is that a conversion performed by a Conservative \"bet din\" is not a valid conversion in the eyes of <em>halacha</em> (traditional Jewish law) <em>for any purpose</em>. That said, it is hypothetically possible that if the 3 judges that formed the <em>bet din</em> kept <em>halacha</em> according to traditional (\"Orthodox\") standards including regarding ideological beliefs, and they, in turn, required the convert to accept all the <em>mitzvot</em> (again, according to <em>halacha</em>), there may well be grounds to consider the conversion valid even from an Orthodox perspective (implicit from <em>Igrot Moshe Yoreh Deah</em> 3:107; See however <em><a href=\"http://www2.huc.edu/gerecht/images/responsa/betdin6.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Igrot Moshe Even HaEzer</em> 3:4</a> where Rav Moshe Feinstein says that a Conservative <em>bet din</em> is definitely invalid since the overwhelming majority of Conservative rabbis keep neither halachic practice nor beliefs and similarly <a href=\"http://www2.huc.edu/gerecht/images/responsa/betdin7.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoreh Deah 1:160</a>; <a href=\"http://www2.huc.edu/gerecht/images/responsa/betdin8.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2:128</a>; <a href=\"http://www2.huc.edu/gerecht/images/responsa/betdin9.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2:132</a>).

Additionally, it's disputed what is meant by the prohibitions for a non-Jew to keep Shabbat (or study non-practical Torah, for that matter, which I believe is the other exclusive Mitzvah).  As usual when it comes to practical questions, this site's policy (and the policy of good practice in general) is \"<a href=\"http://acronymsandslang.com/definition/1431974/AYLOR-meaning.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">AYLOR</a>\".</p>\n\n<p>(It is also perhaps worth noting that there is a famous quote of Maimonides that [originally Jewish] Christianity and Islam were created as a vehicle to expose the pagan/idolatrous nations to the teachings of the Torah. Considering that the newest Jewish movements are arguably themselves swiftly becoming Torah-oriented communities of righteous gentiles [in the sense that their conversions are not halachically valid and their intermarriage rates are very high], the same principle could be said to apply.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>If the non-Jew swore off idolatry then he is not stam \"goy\"(see Hilchot Maachalot Assurot 11:8). It is forbidden for a stam \"goy\" to keep shabbat(see Hilchot Melachim 10:9) and some opinions even for the stam goy to rest on Shabbat. However, if he has given up idolatry then he is no longer a stam goy and then Hilchot Melachim 10:10 applies, in that he is a ben Noach and can rest on Shabbat. To actually fully keep Shabbat as a mitzvah like a Jew seems to be ok according to Rambam Hilchot 10:10, but other opinions differ. The key is if he is an idolator or not and if he's keeping Shabbat as a mitzvah or what.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, a non-Jew should give up idolatry per the sheva mitzvot. He does not have to honor Shabbat, but should. He should not say he is commanded to keep it per Torah of Moshe as a ben Yisrael, but should just say he is honoring it or the like. HaShem repays measure for measure.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can one rely on a gentile's uncertain food description regarding brachot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Let's say you have a dish in front of you but you're not certain what its ingredients are. You ask a Gentile who is familiar, and he says, \"I've seen something <strong>like</strong> this before and it's usually made from X (which requires bracha A). But your dish looks a bit different and it might be made from Y (which requires bracha B). So, I'm not 100% sure.\" </p>\n\n<p>Even after tasting it, the Gentile isn't sure. You have no way of finding out otherwise what the food really is. The Gentile knows nothing about brachot. If you ask another Jew, he would know less about it, and would probably shrug his shoulders and say, \"make shehakol\".</p>\n\n<p>An example of the above - you order a Chinese dish, and it is some type of dim sum (dumplings). The inner ingredient, which is the majority, has chunks and you have no idea what it is. The Chinese Gentile says, \"it could be made either from wheat gluten (mezonot) or taro (adamah). I don't recognize what you have, it's probably taro.\"</p>\n\n<p>For purposes of this question, you don't have access to eat other \"definite\" foods of either category to cover both doubts.</p>\n\n<p>Can you rely on the Gentile's opinion that since it's <strong>most likely</strong> X, and you should say bracha A. Or, because he's not 100% sure, and you know a lot less than he, you should just say <em>shehakol</em> in all cases of doubt?</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Can not obeying a Gentile's opinion of Shabbat time cause a Chilul Hashem?",
    "content": "# Can not obeying a Gentile's opinion of Shabbat time cause a Chilul Hashem?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My understanding is that <em>Chilul Hashem</em> - desecrating G-d's name can be caused when Gentiles have a negative opinion about Jews from observing wrong behavior, even if the behavior may be halachically permissible, but it causes them to have a negative impression.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say that you have a Gentile co-worker in your office who is a \"Shabbos Goy\" for a Jewish family. It's summertime in the NY area and candle lighting is about 8:10. The Jewish family starts Shabbat early at 7 PM. As the Gentile is about to leave at 6:45 to go to her job, she sees that you are still at work, and says, \"Aren't you supposed to go home, now? Shabbes is at 7!\" You say, \"Actually, Shabbes starts at 8:10, and I have time to go home. Your employer is starting Shabbes earlier at 7.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Gentile gives you a look, and says, \"Don't tell me that! My boss knows when Shabbes starts and he wants me to be there on time for his Shabbes! You're going to be late!\"</p>\n\n<p>So, now you gave her the impression that maybe it's OK for Jews to desecrate Shabbes based on whatever they feel like doing, and you gave her an \"excuse\".</p>\n\n<p>Should you have just left early to avoid the problem, or can you ignore what she may think, as you know she is misinformed? Let's say you have an important work deadline to meet and you need to stay there a bit longer?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>You can avoid any concerns about <em>chillul Hashem</em> by intercepting and correcting the negative impression your gentile coworker has of you.</p>\n\n<p>The problem here is an education gap, which you can fix.  Your coworker believes that Shabbat starts at a particular time and that this is when all Jews start it.  He took your \"they're starting early\" to mean \"they're wrong\", as suggested in his response.  But that's not really what's going on.  As you know (but he does not), <em>halacha</em> allows one to accept Shabbat early, and this is what the family is doing.  Your coworker doesn't know anything about starting Shabbat early and so assumes, erroneously, that you are in danger of transgressing.</p>\n\n<p>So take the opportunity to teach him in a non-judgemental way.  There is nothing wrong with accepting Shabbat early and there is nothing wrong with <em>not</em> doing so; it's just a family difference.  In particular, if the family he serves starts early, he should not try to \"correct\" their practice.  Explain that he needs to be there at 7, you need to be home by 8, and neither of you is doing anything wrong.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In terms of the central question, namely does what a non-Jew incorrectly perceives as violating Halacha constitute a <em>chillul Hashem</em>, there is a Magen Avrohom (O.C. 244:8) which calls it a <em>chillul Hashem</em> to have non-Jews publicly do construction on your behalf because non-Jews do not have work done for them on their religion (and they therefore consider us to be violating our religion when we do so).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היה נראה להתיר לבנות בית הכנסת בשבת בקבלנות ומכל מקום ראיתי שהגדולים לא רצו להתירו כי בזמן הזה אין העכו”ם מניחין לשום אדם לעשות מלאכת פרהסיא ביום חגם ואם נניח אנחנו לעשות איכא חילול השם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the concept of <em>chillul Hashem</em> can be extended to the faulty perceptions of Gentiles. As mentioned in another answer, the decision is not necessarily a binary one between ignoring her or catering to her misunderstanding, but leaving her to believe that a Jew is violating Halacha as she understands it could very well constitute a <em>chillul Hashem</em>.</p>\n<p>The point of the Mogen Avrohom as understood by commentaries and later authorities is <em>not</em> that we should copy them, i.e. that because they do (or don't do) it therefore we should do (or not do) it too, but rather that because they perceive that their way of observing the Sabbath is the proper way to observe it, they see it as a disgrace to our Shabbos when we do (or don't do) it. The Machatzis HaShekel supercommentary on the Mogen Avrohom makes this point rather succinctly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין הנכרים מניחים לשום אדם כו’ ר”ל אפילו לישראל ולכל מי שאינו מאמונתם ואין מניחים לו לעשות מלאכה ביום אידם על כן נראה להם זה לגנאי וגרעון בדתם אם יעשה מלאכה ביום אידם אפילו מי שאינו מאנשי דתם אם כן אם אנו מניחים לעשות גוי מלאכה בשבת במה שאפשר לנו למונעו הרי נחשב בעיניהם זלזול ליום השבת ואיכא חס ושלום חילול השם יתברך</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and R' Moshe Feinstein makes this point explicitly (quoted in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14713&pgnum=52\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chelkas Yaakov E\"H 17:1</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומה שהביא כת”ה, מהמגן אברהם … לא מובן השייכות לענין זה, <strong>דהתם דהעכו”ם הם חוששין שגם אחרים עושין הוא חילול שבת, יאמרו שהיהודים אין שומרין שבת שנצטוו שזה חילול השם</strong></p>\n<p>(translation of bold) ... there, since the Gentiles take care that even others should not desecrate their Sabbath, they will say that the Jews do not keep the Sabbath <strong>that they were commanded in</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Moshe argues that it is the perception of whether or not we keep <em><strong>our Shabbos</strong></em> which is the problem.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that R' Breish, in the argument to which R' Moshe is responding (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14713&pgnum=44\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chelkas Yaakov E\"H 14:1</a>), takes an even <em>more</em> expansive view of how far our responsibility to account for the sensitivities of Gentiles goes.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Providing services to a forbidden ceremony\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If a secular society criminalizes discriminating against a ceremony (e.g., a wedding between <em>arayot</em> [forbidden sexual unions, e.g., incest, bestiality, or homosexuality] or an idolatrous ritual), is a Jewish business allowed to provide a service, such as acting as an officiating Rabbi  for the service, baking a cake (custom or neutral), catering the ceremony or designing it? If not, would a <em>kashrut</em> agency be allowed to certify a caterer that, under duress, did? Do we distinguish between Jew and Gentile regarding this halacha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>There are two concerns here: <em>chanufa</em>, which means telling a sinner that you approve of their sinful <em>action</em>; and <em>mesayea</em> / <em>lifnei iver</em>, being involved in (or enabling) someone else's sin.</p>\n\n<p>For a rabbi to officiate at a wedding prohibited by halacha would be an issue of <em>chanufa</em>, as he's declaring okay that which the Torah says is not.</p>\n\n<p>For the caterer, florist, or the like, we go back to the Gemara (Avoda Zara 13b) and Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 151:1). We don't approve of pagans burning frankincense to their idols. But you are allowed to be a frankincense wholesaler, even if you know that a lot of that frankincense will in turn be sold for pagan worship. Similarly the Shulchan Aruch says that as long as you're not the only frankincense store in town, you're not \"enabling\" as they could have bought from someone else, so you can (if necessary, though not ideal) sell retail directly to someone saying \"I want to buy frankincense to sacrifice it to my idol.\" (And none of the commentaries there seem concerned that your sale of the frankincense implies official endorsement of his idolatry. You're just the shopkeeper.)</p>\n\n<p>The subject of kosher certification where other parts of an event are objectionable (e.g. the <em>food</em> is fine, but the entertainment is problematic) has been addressed at length by Israeli poskim, with R' Ovadiah Yosef zt'l in favor of having a certification saying \"at least the food is kosher.\"</p>\n\n<p>So the kosher certification can simply say \"we're certifying the food, not commenting on anything else\"; and the florist and caterer simply put a notice on their paperwork: \"Shmerel's Catering [or better yet, Rabbi Michael Broyde suggests you call it \"Stanley's Catering\"] offers no theological validation\", and you've done your part.</p>\n\n<p>The same goes for the wedding hall. Rav Moshe Feinstein was asked (Igros Moshe YD1:72) about a wedding hall in London hosting a wedding between a Jewish man and Jewish woman, in which there would be mixed dancing, or the wedding would be during the Nine Days. He allows it in cases of significant need. Nowhere is he concerned with questions of approval/validation/<em>chanufa</em>; the only concern is involvement. At the heart of the <em>heter</em> is the reality that in a big city, if you turn them down, they will find some other hall, so you're not truly enabling. Rav Moshe suggests several other heterim in his situation that wouldn't necessarily apply here (e.g. there's a net gain in mitzva observance because everyone's eating kosher who otherwise wouldn't be), but the key heter remains.</p>\n\n<p>Note that \"I'm just facilitating the sin, not enabling it, as there are other providers in town\" is a valid dispensation on the books, but a simple reading of Shulchan Aruch would indicate it's not super-preferable unless necessary. (E.g. the Talmud (Nedarim 62b) totally allows selling firewood to a pagan temple, but employs the argument of \"eh it's probably to heat the building, not for a pagan sacrifice\" rather than fall back on the \"someone else in town sells firewood\" excuse.) Traditionally the case of \"necessity\" would be a significant loss of business, but it stands to reason that another case of necessity -- allowing the other-providers-in-town fallback -- would be \"I'd get more than enough business selling incense exclusively to monotheists, but I would get sued if I discriminated against pagans.\"</p>\n\n<p>If society compelled a rabbi to officiate a wedding prohibited by halacha, could he circumvent the prohibition of <em>chanufa</em> by proclaiming \"while I personally believe this is prohibited by halacha, the state compels me to declare you married\"? That would be a really tricky question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To summarize the responses so far, in addition to the 2 potential issues (cited by @Shalom in his answer) of \"<em>...lo thitein michshol</em>\" (which might not apply if the sin would be committed regardless by other means), and <em>chanufa</em> (tolerance/approbation of sin), there is also a rabbinic prohibition of <em>mesaye'ah</em> (aiding and abetting a sinner which [as noted by @ gt6989b] is an issue even if there are alternative means available). However, the biggest issue (as noted by @wfb) is likely the problem of <em>sha'ath hashmad</em>, when a non-Torah government enacts laws with the purpose of negating Torah values, where the halacha actually demands martyrdom rather than catering the authorities (see, e.g., <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1105n.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maimonides' Laws of the Fundamentals of Torah 5:4</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

Instead, in my (limited) experience, the Masekhtot are largely referred to by content (e.g. Berakhot, Shabbat).</p>\n\n<p>Why the discrepancy? Would it not have been more consistent for everyone to refer to the Humashim by their content or to the Masekhtot by their first word(s) (e.g. Masekhet Me'emata'i for Berakhot)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I'm having trouble locating a single source that explains <strong>when</strong> the names of the books of the Torah occurred, as that would strengthen and shorten my answer. But, I'll provide some sources that I believe support my theory that the style of referring to the 5 books by their 1st name is a carry over from naming parshiot this way.</p>\n\n<p>First, there's <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/vol%202%20epstein.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>. It's very long, but on p. 71, it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In fact, nowhere in the Gemara is it even mentioned that the Torah is\n  partitioned into 54 parshiyos. The only requirement in the Gemara\n  concerning Shabbos Torah readings is limited to the need to read\n  certain portions of the Torah prior to Shevuos and Rosh Hashanah,\n  :מגילה לא׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, there's an implication that there was some other way to refer to the names of the 5 books, which I shall explain, later. Refer to footnotes 6 & 7 - they're important!</p>\n\n<p>Further, on p. 71 going into p. 72, he cites Ramba\"m תפילה יג׃ב where Ramba\"m uses the opening words of a section of the Torah, a different pattern than what we call the parshiot, today.</p>\n\n<p>Next, there is <a href=\"http://people.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/TalmudMap/MG/MGVolName.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this source</a> which shows the original names used for the 5 Books. Unfortunately, the author does not cite a source for these names. However, 2 of the names, <em>Torat Kohanim</em> and <em>Mishnah Torah</em>, IIRC, are mentioned in the Gemarah, and I assume that the others are, as well.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, keep in mind, that the Torah itself was written on a continuous scroll, so, obviously, there originally was no concept of \"weekly\" readings, initially. Nonetheless, from the way it is written, we certainly can determine that there were 5 \"Books\", though, the Torah itself, makes no mention of any divisions. I assume that this division was Masorah, then. (Worthy of a separate question on this, alone.) At any rate, this lends support to the notion that historically, there were different names for the 5 books of the Torah that DID refer to its content, similar to what is done for most of the Talmud. It seems that only years later, when a parsha system was developed, that the usage of the opening significant word was used for parshiot, and, thus it most likely carried over to the names for the 5 books, as well. </p>\n\n\n",

However, in another context (Deuteronomy 3:27), when G-d\n  tells Moses to gaze upon the Holy Land from which he was barred from\n  entering, He tells Moses to look at all four directions: yam, tzafon,\n  mizrach (east), and teiman (south). In essence, while the words for\n  west and north remain the same, the Bible uses two different words to\n  mean east (kedem and mizrach) and south (negev and teiman). What is\n  the difference between these synonymous doublets? This matter actually\n  becomes quite complicated upon the realization that the Hebrew\n  language has three words for every one of the four directions!</p>\n  \n  <p>As we shall see below, the different words for the four directions\n  focus on different aspects of those directions and are generally based\n  on either the movements of the sun or certain topographical\n  characteristics of the Holy Land.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbeinu Bachaya explains that the word yam literally means “sea”, and\n  is also used to refer to the west because the Mediterranean Sea lies\n  at the west side of the Holy Land. The west is also called ma’arav\n  because as the sun sets, the shapes of shadows become mixed up\n  (me’urav). Thirdly, the word acharon, which literally means “last”,\n  also means west because it is the last place along the horizon where\n  the sun is located before setting in evening.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are three words for east: mizrach, kedem, and panim. Mizrach is\n  related to the word zarach (shine) and refers to the direction from\n  which the sun first shines in the morning, while kedem is related to\n  the word kodem (early or forward) and refers to the fact that the\n  rising-sun first shines from the east. The word panim (literally,\n  “facewards”) also means east because when Adam was created the front\n  of his bodyfaced eastward.</p>\n  \n  <p>As mentioned above, the common Hebrew word for north is tzafon. The\n  commentators offer several explanations for the etymology of this\n  word: Some compare the word tzafon to tzafun which means “hidden”\n  because in the northern parts of the world (i.e. the Arctic zone) the\n  influence of the sun is “hidden”, as the cold temperatures there\n  obscure the sun’s warmth. Alternatively, because the sun generally\n  remains south of the celestial equator, the north side is considered\n  “hidden” from the sun’s presence. Others claim that tzafon is related\n  to the word tzifiya (gazing) and refers to the fact that one can\n  determine north by gazing towards the Heavens and following the\n  Northern Star. Another approach argues that the word tzafon refers to\n  Mount Tzafon (identified by scholars as Jebel Aqra on the border\n  between modern-day Turkey and Syria, a mountain mentioned in the Bible\n  which lies due north of the Holy Land.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Talmud sometimes uses the Aramaic word estan to mean north (e.g.\n  Ketubot 23a). Rabbeinu Bachaya (1255-1340) proposes that the word\n  estan may be related to the Aramaic word asuta, which means “health”,\n  and alludes to the fact that the north-wind possesses certain healing\n  properties (see Yevamot 72a). In fact, some people have a custom of\n  exclaiming “Asuta!”(“Gesundheit!”in Yiddish) when hearing another\n  sneeze, so as to bless him with good health.</p>\n  \n  <p>The word darom means south, and the commentaries explain that darom is\n  a portmanteau of the words derech yom (“the path of the day”), because\n  the sun generally remains in the southern hemisphere of the celestial\n  map during the day. The south is also called negev (literally, “dry”)\n  because the southern part of the Holy Land is a dry and arid\n  desert-land.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are two more words for north and south which you might be\n  familiar with from another context: teiman/yemin (right) and smol\n  (left). The Bible uses the words right and left to refer to the south\n  and north, respectively. This understanding presupposes that eastwards\n  is one’s frame of reference, because, as we mentioned above, Adam was\n  created facing eastwards. Therefore, because one facing eastwards\n  encounters north to his left and south to his right, the very words\n  for north and south can be left and right. In an interesting\n  geographical anomaly, the Hebrew words for left and right are found in\n  place-names near the Gulf of Aden between Africa and Arabia. One\n  travelling northwards in the Gulf of Aden will approach Yemen (related\n  to yemin) on his right, and Somalia (related to smol) on his left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>SOURCE: <em><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/whats-in-a-word\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What's in a Word?</a></em>, \"<a href=\"https://ohr.edu/this_week/whats_in_a_word/7117\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Looking Four Directions</a>\" by Rabbi Reuven Chaim Klein</p>\n\n\n",

There was a discussion if two people claim it, or three or more. Perhaps it was a discussion if someone stole something but doesn't know from who and there are several claimants it was them (but I'm not sure of that).</p>\n\n<p>One of the opinions is very difficult to understand the theoretical basis behind, and the article quoted a Rishon as saying it is incomprehensible. The Halacha, of course, is paskened according to other opinions on how to do the division.</p>\n\n<p>Then the article went on to say that that according to modern game theory this incomprehensible opinion was in fact comprehensible and consistent with this theory. I distinctly remember the specifics of the game theory not being discussed.</p>\n\n<p>So which Machlokes Tanaim is this? What is the case, and the source? (The statement that one of the opinions is incomprehensible is probably enough to recognize it, but I have a feeling I'll recognize the case if I see it again).</p>\n\n<p>Bonus points: What idea in Game theory helps explain the hard-to-understand opinion?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The discussion is indeed Dr. Aumann's discussion on Kesuvos 93a regarding the man who dies with insufficient funds to pay for his three wives' Kesubos. He claims to be the first to come up with this theory, but I think Rashi figured it out first. He theorizes as follows: First, award equally amongst all parties until one receives half of his claim. Then award equally among all <em>other</em> parties. Repeat until only one is left. Then continue awarding money to him until the difference between his claim and the amount he's getting equals the difference between his claim and the next guy's claim. Then award to the top two claimants equally. Repeat until all parties are receiving money again. Continue awarding money equally until everyone receives their claim. </p>\n\n<p>As for the math behind it.

According to the Gemara (Shabes page 30) the Neshama of a Jew is called a candle-נר,    and thus the phrase is a blessing for a person that he will influence good in the world. </p>\n\n<p>In the holy Zohar, an interesting definition of the Neshama states that the Neshama is a the perfect knowledge of the way to practice the Mitzvos.</p>\n\n<p>I think the common usage means \"may he live long\" i.e. that his Neshama's time (the candle burning) on earth will be long.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>\"Nero Yair\" -- <em>may his lamp illuminate.</em></p>\n\n<p>Traditionally used after the name of a boy or young man, as a wish that he achieve spiritual growth. Afraid I don't know the earliest historical use. Usually seen in wedding invitations after the groom's name, assuming he's relatively young.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional wedding invitations would use תחי׳, short for תחיה -- \"may she live\" -- concerning the bride. When many girls were getting married as teens, many did not survive childbirth, and there was not a formalized stress on advanced Jewish education for girls, we were more concerned with \"may she live\" than \"may she illuminate the world with her spiritual brilliance.\" </p>\n\n<p>With the advent of modern medicine and education, it's not-uncommon for wedding invitations of a modern bent to use  נ\"י for both bride and groom (though grammar would dictate it would spell <em>neraH ya'ir</em> for a female, <em>may HER lamp illuminate.</em>)</p>\n\n<p>It's also not uncommon to hear a rabbi say \"my son Moshe, <em>nero yair</em>\" when telling a story about him. You could use this for a middle-schooler, high-schooler, or even college-age fellow. You wouldn't say it about 40-year-old career rabbi as the idea is he's already reached a certain level of development. (You could still say or write \"shlita\" after his name, meaning <em>may he live long and well</em>.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It means נרו יאיר.

He adduces a text in the Torah according to which it is unclean, viz. , \"whatsoever is in it shall be unclean\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And Rabbi Yochanan Ben Zaccai is called student of Hillel and Shamai, see Mishna Avot 2, 8:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רַבָּן יוֹחָנָן בֶּן זַכַּאי קִבֵּל מֵהִלֵּל וּמִשַּׁמָּאי </p>\n  \n  <p>RYBZ received from Hillel and Shamai.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of his students, Rabbi Eliezer is often considered as student of B.Sh. \"Shamuti\"  (but Shamuti may be interpreted as who was in Cherem, after the dispute of Tanur shel Achnay), and Rabbi Akiba is counted as one of his students in Gemara <a href=\"http://dtorah.com/otzar/shas_soncino.php?ms=Sanhedrin&df=68a\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 68a</a>, when he was Goses, he said to Rabbi Akiva \"שלך קשה מכולם\". But he regularly countered him. Rabbi Yehoshua said that they do not need to follow the \"Bat Kol\" which indicates that Halacha Kedivre Beth Hillel, but was not Shamuti.</p>\n\n<p>But Rabbi Akiva was mainly a student of Rabbi Tarfon (Doresh Miut Verubui and not Klale Uprate) which is involved with the Halacha to follow Beth Hillel, but was not see Mishna Berachot 1, 3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אָמַר רַבִּי טַרְפוֹן, אֲנִי הָיִיתִי בָא בַדֶּרֶךְ, וְהִטֵּתִי לִקְרוֹת, כְּדִבְרֵי בֵית שַׁמַּאי, וְסִכַּנְתִּי בְעַצְמִי מִפְּנֵי הַלִּסְטִים. אָמְרוּ לוֹ, כְּדַי הָיִיתָ לָחוּב בְּעַצְמְךָ, שֶׁעָבַרְתָּ עַל דִּבְרֵי בֵית הִלֵּל: ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Tarfon said: I was once walking by the way and I reclined to recite the shema' in the manner prescribed by Beth Shammai, and I incurred danger from robbers.  they said to him: you deserved to come to harm, because you acted against the opinion of Beth Hillel. {in Gemara they learn from this that one who follows the rule of Beth Shammai makes his life forfeit}. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mesilat Yesharim explained this Gemara in the end of Chapter 20:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The episode of R. Tarfon (Berachoth 10b) substantiates what has been said. Although he took\n  upon himself the more stringent decision of Beth Shammai, he was told, \"You would rightly have\n  been accounted the cause of your own death, for you violated the words of Beth Hillel.\" All this\n  because the controversy between Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel had become an area of difficulty\n  to Israel in view of the great contention that had grown up between them; and after it had finally\n  been ruled that the law should constantly be decided in accordance with Beth Hillel it was\n  essential for the very endurance of Torah that this ruling forever retain its force and not be\n  weakened in any way lest the Torah come to take on the semblance of two Torahs (G-d forbid).\n  Hence, the view of this Mishnah that it is Saintlier to hold with Beth Hillel even when more\n  lenient, than to be more stringent in accordance with Beth Shammai. This should serve us as a\n  guide to perceive the path where light resides with truth and faith for the doing of what is just in\n  the eyes of G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: <em>There was no more members of Bet Shamai in the generation of Rabbi Shim'on and his Rabbi was not member of BS, and The Rabbanim of his Rabbi also was not</em>. The question you linked and answers count only people from former generations, not from the Generation of Rabbi Shim'on. See also Seder Hadorot, who said that he receive Smicha from Rabbi Yehuda Ben Baba who was the Rav of Rabbi Yehuda Hanasssi. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>So Rabbi Shim'on obviously was not of Beth Shammai</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n",

It makes me wonder what HaShem has planned for me.. </p>\n\n<p>while i personally have no problem with reform judaism and conservative too, upon more research of what it actually was- because both are great places to ~~start~~ learning, i reject those two for myself. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry for rambling and taking longer than i thought it would take... what is the difference between an actually full conversion process and a giyur lechumra? i am tired of my jewishness being discounted and someday, G-d willing, i want it to be unimpeachable to everyone... </p>\n\n<p>Granted, i know processes take time and even if im not legally jewish, legality and reality are not mutually exclusive, and all i can do is learn enough to be a baal teshuva and then when i can go through an official legal process, do so.. </p>\n\n<p>my thoughts have been so scattered lately on this situation. i hope i make enough sense to warrant a response and/or insight into my situation. Also thank you in advance to any and all people who do respond.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day, and i apologize if my lack of proper capitalization hurts anyones eyes. :)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Thank you for coming to J.SE.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like you're going through a difficult time, may God help you through it with tranquility.</p>\n\n<p>Giyur lechumra applies in cases where there's a good chance a conversion wasn't really needed, e.g. some rabbis feel this way about the population of Ethiopian Jews.</p>\n\n<p>From the strict technical standpoint of Orthodox halacha, it sounds like your situation requires a full conversion. Though there's really little difference here, all that's really required is study, commitment, and a dunk in the mikvah before a rabbinic panel. <em>But</em> ... your religious experience and self-identification are much more like a baal teshuva -- \"I was raised Jewish, but as a I grew up I wanted to be more involved\" -- than someone who was actively raised Catholic and is now rejecting that and turning their life in a totally different direction. </p>\n\n<p>The good news is that while I'm sure it's uncomfortable to feel caught in-between, rabbis see such cases on a regular basis these days. Rabbi Hershel Schachter, one of the senior rabbis at Yeshiva University, has said that it's not uncommon to have a student at YU (or its sister, Stern College) who was raised Jewish but suddenly in college realized they need to undergo a conversion, and the rabbis there handle it without much fuss or fanfare. </p>\n\n<p>So hopefully the process shouldn't take that much time or be that grueling. The first step is to find a reputable Orthodox rabbi to work with -- is there a local one you can contact?</p>\n\n<p>When your conversion is complete, you can't marry a Kohen, and you should tell someone you're dating about the technicalities of your situation before things get too serious; but otherwise if your standard story for random folks in synagogue is \"I was raised Jewish but picked up more observance along the way\", that's accurate and fine. You don't have to wear a big sign on your forehead that says <em>CONVERT</em> unless you wish to do so. </p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When would a man have married multiple women on the same day?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The mishna at the bottom of Ketubot 93b talks about paying ketubot when a man with several wives dies.  (They're paid in order of marriage, which from context means order of <em>kiddushin</em>.)  It then raises the case of marrying several women on the same day, and records that it was the practice in Jerusalem to add the hour and not just the date to the ketubah in that case (so a later court would be able to determine unambiguously the order of the wives).</p>\n\n<p>From the Soncino translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] She also may not exact payment except on oath, if all [ketubahs] were issued on the same day then the woman [whose ketubah] preceded that of the other, even if only by one hour, gains [the first right]. And so it was the custom in Jerusalem to insert the hours [in such documents]. If all ketubahs were issued at the same hour and the estate is worth no more than a maneh [the women] receive equal shares.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the mishna had just said that in that case we add the hours, then I would have assumed that this was a theoretical case.  But it says it was the practice in Jerusalem.  On 94b (h/t ray) the g'mara talks about writing the time in documents in general, but here the mishna seems to be specifically talking about doing so in ketubot.</p>\n\n<p>Marrying more than one person on the same day seems unusual to me, but I am of course far removed from this time in our history.  What circumstances would have led to this happening in mishnaic times?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>in Ketuvos 94b there is a story there (regarding documents of gifts) where the date and time were written in those documents as standard practice.</p>\n\n<p>This shows that this practice was not only for ketuvot. The mishna regarding marrying multiple women on the same day is talking about a theoretical case not necessarily that it was common practice.</p>\n\n\n",

But assuming they meet all the other qualifications, are they mechulin(?) on hafrashas challah, just for that stuff?</p>\n<p>In other words, what did they do?  They took a batter of flour and water – they didn't <em>really</em> do this, but <em>sort of</em> what they did was take flour and water, they washed it for an hour, and then, they make bread out of it.  Okay, now, to us it looks like they made something different out of it, they made this thing called seitan.  But basically, what's flour and water – that's what started off as flour and water.  Now, it did start off in a factory—</p>\n<p>[a question is asked]</p>\n<p>Right, except that they didn't. But they didn't make the dough. They bought gluten. They bought it from somebody else.

Maybe – so, the same question, which is – Could we say this thing – if they made it into lechem, would we say that this thing is, basically it's flour and water. The fact that we pulled out one element of the flour – what's the difference? Basically, it's flour and water.  OK – we are just fancy and we know that this element we call this and – it's not like bran, that's physically a separate piece – it [inaudible] the same piece.  Or do you say, no, come on guys, there's a reason why they call it seitan. If you take flour and water, it doesn't taste like seitan. This is something special to it.</p>\n<p>Okay, actually, we were lucky, that the first company we certified wasn't Jewish, we didn't have to think about hafrashas challah.</p>\n<p>[Question: if you make bread out of just the subin(?) part, what's that?</p>\n<p>Of course it doesn't count.  That's the din, of course it doesn't count.</p>\n<p>[back and forth, difficult to make out and transcribe]</p>\n<p>Right, but the difference is that the bran is a physically separate piece from it, and this is not physically separate – this is only, sort of like we imagine it</p>\n<p>[back and forth]</p>\n<p>Right, it's a din in Orech Chaim.  I don't know what the din is—what the bracha is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Transcription mine.  I put a (?) after the two instances of non-English words that I wasn't sure about.  It sounds like the bracha on seitan itself is either mezonos or hamotzi (I realize that, added to the shehakol answer you're already aware of, does not narrow the field much), and that if you managed to make it into bread things would be even less clear.</p>\n\n\n",

But it might be more than that. <strong>Rav Soloveichik believed the Israeli flag has the Halachik status and Holiness of a murdered Jew’s clothing, and shouldn't be desecrated.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Soloveichik (mentioned in ‘Nefesh Ha’Rav’) says that there is a section in\nthe Shulchan Aruch that relates to the Holiness of the Israeli flag.\nIn Yoreh De’ah 352, it says a person can’t be buried in an expensive\nshroud. In YD 364 it says, that if a Jew is found murdered, he should\nbe buried in his bloody clothes that he was found in, without the\nnormal shrouds.</p>\n<p>Why don’t we bury him in the usual shrouds? The Shach answers that,\n”as the Jew was murdered, we bury him as he was found, in order to\nraise G-d’s anger against the person who killed the Jew”. This means\nthat when G-d sees how the person was buried-in bloody clothes which\nwill arouse G-d’s compassion to take revenge and avenge the spilled\nJewish blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Rav Soloveichik applies this to the Israeli flag.</strong> The Rav said that in\n1948 in the War of Independence and subsequently, many heroic fighters\nhave sacrificed their lives in order to raise the Israeli – Jewish\nflag.</p>\n<p>The Rav claimed therefore that the Israeli flag has the Halachik\nstatus and Holiness of a murdered Jew’s clothing, as it symbolized\nspilled Jewish blood. The Rav said when the Israeli flag flies, it arouses G-d’s Divine compassion for Am Yisrael wherever it is seen and that G-d may avenge the spilled Jewish blood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(found online <a href=\"https://thoughtsfromtheshteiblech.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/the-sanctity-of-a-bloodstained-israeli-flag/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://israelk.org/2014/07/jewish-blood-is-no-longer-hefker-cheap/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n<p>In the words of R Soloveichik (Chamesh Derashot, p. 90; cf. Nefesh ha-Rav, p. 100) from <a href=\"http://shimshonnadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The-Religious-Significance-of-the-Israeli-Flag-The-Jewish-Press-May-3-2013.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The blue and white flag, soaked with the blood of thousands of young\nJews who fell in the War of Independence, protecting the Land and\nsettlements (religious and non-religious, for the enemy, yemach\nshemam, did not distinguish), has a spark of sanctity that flows from\ndevotion and self-sacrifice. We are all enjoined to honor the flag and\ntreat it with respect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I remember reading that this was more than hyperbole. Shortly before the 1948 armistice, there was an attempt to plant as many Israeli flags as far as possible in ennemy territory as it was known that, after the armistice, all territories where the Israeli flag was flying would remain Israeli. Many soldiers lost their lives planting these flags.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The State of Israel comprises part of the Jewish mind-space in our era. I.e. regardless of your attitude towards the state, it is part of the Jewish psyche in our times.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore burning the Israeli flag shows contemptuousness for the Jewish people and re-classifies the burner as someone who is not part of that people.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rosh Yeshiva and his students were at that time dealing with a difficult problem, one that, as it turned out, the young Baruch Epstein provided an answer to.</p>\n<p>The problem was as follows:</p>\n<p>Two brothers shared a business for many years, and their relationship with one another was friendly and loving. However a dispute once arose between them, and the friction that it created led one of them to swear that he would never see his brother again. After several years, the second brother died, and the surviving one regretted the oath that he had taken. He wanted to return and see his dead brother and beg his forgiveness. He then came to see the Rav and asked whether his oath was valid now that his brother was dead. The Rav and his students began to discuss the matter, and some ruled that it was still valid while others ruled that it was not, yet they could not reach a definitive conclusion. It was then that the young Baruch, who was sitting among them, turned to his uncle the Rav and said, “There is a very simple solution to this, and it is explicitly written in the Torah. It states in Exodus, ‘Moses said to the people, “Do not fear…for the Egyptians you see today, you shall never see them again” ’ [Exodus 14:15]. Yet afterwards it is written, ‘Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore’ [v.30]. From this we have a clear proof that viewing a person after his death is not called seeing, and therefore the brother’s oath does not apply to his dead brother.” Upon hearing this, the Rav arose, placed his hand on his nephew’s head, and said: “Happy is your youth.” This experience encouraged him to write Torah Temimah (from Rabbi Baruch’s memoirs: Mekor Baruch, Ch. 48, Par. 3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet, the <em>exact same</em> story is told in the name of the Noda BeYehuda (In <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/nodabiyehudahsto0000vain/page/14/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noda BiYehuda</a> by CIS publishers).</p>\n<p>What's the source of the Noda BeYehuda making the above Chiddush?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As noted in the article (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150905222224/https://www.biu.ac.il/jh/Parasha/bo/shp.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">archived link</a>) by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%91_%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%92%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Yaakov Spiegel</a> brought by @Fred in the comments, Rabbi Baruch Epstein and those who wrote the same idea before him were not aware that anyone else had proposed this solution before them, but this is already suggested by the Geonim.</p>\n<p>Regarding your question, the author of the biography isn't the only one who cited Rabbi Landau as the hero of the story. In Otzar Hachochmah there are a number of sources that bring this version as well, all source-less. Given that Rabbi Epstein wrote this story about himself in two separate sources, it seems likely that he did not <em>chalilah</em> steal the story and attribute it to himself. He probably did take part in the incident and, at least in his youth, thought that the chiddush was his own. Spiegel noted that the Rabbi Landau version was brought in Rabbi Maimon's Sarei Hameah, vol. 1, pp. 193-194, also source-less. It seems likely that Rabbi Maimon is the oldest source of this version and he misremembered the story. This isn't the first case that a modern-era story is mistakenly associated with different rabbis, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/79102/if-dont-aspire-to-be-a-general-cannot-be-a-simple-soldier/119495#119495\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/67519/source-for-story-about-the-maskilims-play-mocking-what-the-orchei-hamilchama/118930#118930\">here</a> for example for discussions of similar cases.</p>\n\n\n",

So they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him, and the children of Israel did just as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last part (“And the children of Israel did just as the Lord had commanded Moses”) seems strange.</p>\n<p>To explain it, the Ramban says it means that they didn’t do it out of hate, but out of a desire to fulfill the Mitzvah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועשו כן כל בני ישראל לשמור ולעשות כאשר ציווה השם את משה, ולא לשנאת בן המצרי שנצה עם הישראלי אלא לבער הפגום מתוכם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, isn't this kind of hate permissible, or even desirable, as it leads to productive actions and restraining from evil doings?</p>\n<p>It is written in משלי ח, יג:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ראת ה' שנאות רע, גאה וגאון ודרך רע ופי תהפוכות שנאתי</p>\n<p>Fear of the Lord is to hate evil, haughtiness, pride, the way of evil, and a perverse mouth; [these] I hate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The gemara (Pesachim 113b) says that the pasuk is indeed about hating the sinner.</p>\n<p>If this hate is <em>not</em> good, why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are two possible questions here. I’ll address both, just in case.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Why was it undesirable to stone him out of hate?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I don’t think that’s the Ramban’s intent. I believe he most likely meant that hatred, whether justified or not (see below), shouldn’t be the <em>main reason</em> for fulfilling the mitzvah of execution. Rather, the main reason they stoned the sinner is in order to fulfill the will of Hashem; and that primary intent is what’s laudable, regardless of how they felt about the sinner.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Is it good to hate evildoers?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>You yourself brought Pesachim 113b as a source for the affirmative, and I think that’s perfectly valid:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אָמַר רִבִּי שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר רַב יִצְחָק אָמַר רַב: מוּתָּר לִשְׂנֹאתוֹ. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״כִּי תִרְאֶה חֲמוֹר שֹׂנַאֲךָ רוֹבֵץ תַּחַת מַשָּׂאוֹ״.</strong> מַאי ״שׂוֹנֵא״? אִילֵּימָא שׂוֹנֵא גּוֹי, וְהָא תַּנְיָא: שׂוֹנֵא שֶׁאָמְרוּ — שׂוֹנֵא יִשְׂרָאֵל וְלֹא שׂוֹנֵא גּוֹי. אֶלָּא <strong>פְּשִׁיטָא, שׂוֹנֵא יִשְׂרָאֵל.</strong> וּמִי שְׁרֵיא לְמִסְנְיֵהּ? וְהָכְתִיב: ״לֹא תִשְׂנָא אֶת אָחִיךָ בִּלְבָבֶךָ״. אֶלָּא דְּאִיכָּא סָהֲדִי דְּעָבֵיד אִיסּוּרָא — כּוּלֵּי עָלְמָא נָמֵי מִיסְנֵי סָנֵי לֵיהּ, מַאי שְׁנָא הַאי? אֶלָּא לָאו כִּי הַאי גַוְונָא, דַּחֲזָיא בֵּיהּ אִיהוּ דְּבַר עֶרְוָה.\n<br />\nRibbī Shemūʼēl bar Rav Yiṣħaq said that Rav said: [One should not testify against a sinner alone, but <strong>it is] permitted to hate him (the sinner)</strong>, as it is stated (Exodus 23:5): “When you see the donkey of he who hates you lying under its load….” …it’s obvious [that this refers to] a <em>Jew</em> [who] hates.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>רַב נַחְמָן בַּר יִצְחָק אָמַר: מִצְוָה לִשְׂנֹאתוֹ. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״יִרְאַת ה׳ שׂוֹנְאֵי רָע״. אָמַר רַב אַחָא בְּרֵיהּ דְּרָבָא לְרַב אָשֵׁי: מַהוּ לְמֵימְרָא לֵיהּ לְרַבֵּיהּ לְמִשְׂנְיֵיהּ? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: אִי יָדַע דִּמְהֵימַן לְרַבֵּיהּ כְּבֵי תְרֵי — לֵימָא לֵיהּ</strong>, וְאִי לָא — לָא לֵימָא לֵיהּ.\n<br />\nRav Naħman bar Yiṣħaq said: <strong>It’s [even] a <em>mitzva</em> to hate him</strong>, as it is stated: “The fear of God is to hate evil” (Proverbs 8:13). Rav Aħā son of Rāvā said to Rav Āshē: What is [the halakha with regard] to [whether someone who witnessed someone sin can] tell his teacher, [to cause his teacher] to hate him? [Rav Āshē] said to him: <strong>If [the student] knows that he’s trusted by his teacher like two [witnesses] (i.e. his teacher will surely believe him), he should tell him (and thereby make his teacher hate the sinner)</strong>….</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Be careful to note one important caveat to this whole discussion: The Hebrew word שנאה means “repulsion”. It’s not exactly like the English word “hatred”, which refers to a feeling similar to focused anger, like one wants to destroy the object of hatred. Rather, שנאה connotes that one wants to remain far away from the object of שנאה. It’s less wrathful than the English word, and usually more practical.</p>\n<p>Of course, שנאה can <em>include</em> feelings of anger and violent will, just as hatred can make someone want to stay away from the object of his hatred. But the essential, inherent definitions are different.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is a problem with the question. According to maseches Sanhedrin, the execution of the <em>makalel</em> was made by the witnesses themselves as the law requires. However, if the witnesses had hatred towards the <em>mekalel</em>, that would nullify their testimony and they would not be able to execute. For example, Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yevamot.15.4?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yebamos 15:4</a> disqualifies 5 women from testimony regarding death of a husband (not capital cases) because of natural hatred.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when describing a person who is exiled to the city of refuge, the Torah notes, Devarim 19:6:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פֶּן־יִרְדֹּף֩ גֹּאֵ֨ל הַדָּ֜ם אַחֲרֵ֣י הָרֹצֵ֗חַ כִּי־יֵחַם֮ לְבָבוֹ֒ וְהִשִּׂיג֛וֹ כִּֽי־יִרְבֶּ֥ה הַדֶּ֖רֶךְ וְהִכָּ֣הוּ נָ֑פֶשׁ וְלוֹ֙ אֵ֣ין מִשְׁפַּט־מָ֔וֶת כִּ֠י <strong>לֹ֣א שֹׂנֵ֥א ה֛וּא ל֖וֹ מִתְּמ֥וֹל שִׁלְשֽׁוֹם</strong>׃</p>\n<p>lest the avenger of blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; though he was not worthy of death, since <strong>he hated him not in time past</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, even in the case of accidental death, hatred can be used against sending a person into a city of refuge.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "When does טומאת הסגר begin?",
    "content": "# When does טומאת הסגר begin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When the <em>Chumash</em> speaks about a <em>kohen</em>'s seeing some <em>tzaraas</em> on a person's body for the first time, it says the <em>kohen</em> \"shall defile\" (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0313.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Vayikra</em> 13</a>:3,  13:11, 13:20, 13:25, 13:30, 13:44). <em>Rashi</em> (13:3) says that the <em>kohen</em> states to the other: \"You are defiled.\" In some circumstances, though, the <em>kohen</em> does not declare person defiled; rather, he closes him in his house to await further evidence as to whether he has <em>tzaraas</em> (<em>Rashi</em>, 13:4). Nonetheless, during that closed-up period, the person is <em>m'tame</em>, i.e. he defiles things he comes in contact with (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/a310.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Rambam</em>, <em>Tum'as Tzaraas</em> 10</a>:12).</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to <em>tzaraas</em> on clothing or a house, though, it is never full-blown <em>tzaraas</em> from the outset: The <em>kohen</em>, if he thinks it's <em>tzaraas</em>, closes it up to await further evidence (13:50, 14:38). During that closed-up period, the seeming <em>tzaraas</em> is <em>m'tame</em> (<em>Rashi</em>, 14:36; <em>Rambam</em> 13:13, 16:1).</p>\n\n<p><strong>From what point is the closed-up person, garment, or house <em>m'tame</em>?</strong> Specifically, is it from when the <em>kohen</em> sees the <em>tzaraas</em> (and knows it needs to be closed up) or from when he actually closes it up? If the latter, what exactly does the <em>kohen</em> do to effect the defilement? (For example, is it sufficient that he pronounces the house off-limits? Does he need to physically lock it up?)</p>\n\n<p>Especially, does anyone address this question explicitly? Here's why I'm asking:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Yad Hachazaka</em> never addresses the issue explicitly (as far as I see).</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Rashi</em> (14:36) writes about a house: \"… the <em>kohen</em> will come and see the <em>tzaraas</em>, then it will need to be closed up and everything in it will be defiled\". This is unclear: <em>Rashi</em> may mean that everything in it will be defiled when it's closed up, or he may mean everything in it will be defiled as soon as the <em>kohen</em> sees the <em>tzaraas</em> and the house <strong>needs to be</strong> closed up. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39760&pgnum=93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The <em>Maharal</em></a> seems to resolve that ambiguity: \"Meaning, when he sees the <em>tzaraas</em>, everything in it will be defiled immediately….\" However, even this is not entirely clear, as he goes on to contrast this immediacy with a rule, not applicable here, about how long something can be in a <em>tzaraas</em>-afflicted house before becoming defiled. So he may mean \"immediately\" only in contrast with that and not as an indication of when the defilement begins. Nonetheless, his language does somewhat seem to me to imply that he holds the defilement begins immediately the <em>kohen</em> sees the <em>tzaraas</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillel_ben_Eliakim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Rabenu Hilel ben Elyakim</em></a> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40721&pgnum=15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to <em>Sifra</em></a> to 14:36) writes about a house: \"… For we didn't learn '[he's not defiled] until he remains [in the afflicted house] the time it takes to eat a half loaf' except about such items as he brings in [to the house]. But such as were there when the <em>kohen</em> arrived are all defiled immediately.\" Again, like the <em>Maharal</em>, this is ambiguous, but seems somewhat to imply the defilement begins on the <em>kohen</em>'s arrival, not on his closing up the house.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14061&pgnum=175\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Meshech Chochma</em> to 14:36</a> says very clearly that the <em>pasuk</em> is teaching us there that the house is not defiled before the <em>kohen</em> comes. But he's not as clear about when it <strong>is</strong> defiled. He writes at the end: \"…for at the time he sees the <em>tzaraas</em>, that is closing up, likewise everything in the house will be defiled\". He may mean that seeing the <em>tzaraas</em> constitutes closing up, i.e. everything becomes defiled when the <em>kohen</em> sees it; but he may mean that the \"seeing\" referred to in <em>Vayikra</em> there is not literal seeing but an act of closing up the house.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You asked: From what point is the closed-up person, garment, or house m'tame?</p>\n\n<p>Short snswer: When the Cohen makes a verbal declaration to that effect.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Details and sources:</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam on the Mishna in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Negaim.3.1?lang=he&p2=Rambam_on_Mishnah_Negaim.3.1.4&lang2=he&w2=all&lang3=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">נגעים  3:1</a> says <code>יאמר לו הרי אתה מוסגר בנגע זה</code> - The person becomes a Musgar (<em>quarantined</em> for 7 days) when the Cohen declares: \"You are a Musgar regarding this discoloring\"</p>\n\n<p>The same procedure is used to create a Muchlat (full fledged Metzora): <code>\"שיאמר לו \"הרי אתה מוחלט בנגע זה</code></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמרו \"מסגיר ופוטר\" ענינו: שהוא בתחלה או בסוף שבוע יאמר לו <em>הרי אתה מוסגר בנגע זה ופטור מזה</em> וכן ג\"כ שיאמר לו <em>הרי אתה מוחלט בנגע זה ופטור מזה</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Merely seeing the troublesome spot - even making a decision about it - is insufficient, as there are cases when the color - and hence the outcome - changes while the Cohen is busy looking at the discolorment before he makes the declarations.

There is for  sure a minyan answering, or he himself is sure to answer amen.  Nonetheless one should make as if the minyan is dependant on him and not learn lest he not answer, and further he should take care to not set a wrong example. </p>\n\n<p>It would seem to be that there a basis to say something to the rebbe, especially if others will learn from him. But one could also argue that since there is a basis to allow it tacitly maybe you should not say anything to the Rebbe. But maybe it is worthwhile to show this Rav Moshe and ask him to explain to you and through that the Rebbe will realize by himself what the correct thing is.</p>\n\n<p>However as always here on Mi Yodeya, consult a halachic authority.</p>\n\n\n",

I understand that you need <strong>two</strong> witnesses - or is just one acceptable <em>b'dieved</em> - for any of the 3 items mentioned?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Step One: The Torah talks about \"should a man take a woman ...\" (<a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=24\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deut. 24:1</a>) which the rabbis interpret as <em>kiddushin</em>.  The couple is therefore absolutely not married (at least via <em>kiddushei kesef</em>) unless he gives her a ring (or other item of value), before two kosher witnesses. Age-old practice is to do it under a chupah, though occasionally a couple may opt for a quick, simple chupa (usually a few people holding up a Tallis) and kiddushin at one point, then a big party some other time.</p>\n\n<p>Step Two: Even though the couple would be married by <em>kiddushin</em> alone, the rabbis felt it wasn't right for a woman to live with the insecurity that if \nher husband suddenly died or divorced her, she'd be penniless. They therefore decreed that a married couple must have a <em>ketubah</em>, a monetary document that says \"the groom hereby agrees to provide for the bride after the dissolution of this marriage.\" It's executed by the signatures of two kosher witnesses, who need not be around for any other part of the ceremony. (In Ashkenazic practice, the ketubah is signed a few minutes before the <em>chupah</em>; in Sephardic practice, it's signed under the chupah.) The ketubah witnesses are simply vouching that he agreed to certain monetary responsibilities <em>once the marriage is effective.</em> A tricky question arises if the ketubah is signed before sunset (let's say Halachic Sunday, the 20th) and the <em>kiddushin</em> doesn't happen until nightfall (halachic Monday, the 21st) -- you have a document giving her certain rights as of the 20th, but they weren't married until the 21st. </p>\n\n<p>Step Three: <em>Tnaim.</em> If two independent people meet up and decide to get married, that's great. But often in times past, there were complex negotiations between families about the terms of such (generally arranged) marriages. Thus, a binding document was executed (again, by two witnesses, who need not be present for anything else) <em>at the time of the engagement</em> between the two families, agreeing that this one's daughter will wed this one's son, with a penalty clause for cancelling the engagement without good reason. As time went by, people got increasingly nervous about signing such an agreement, until they weren't doing so until just before the wedding -- kind of a moot point to talk about binding agreements-to-wed. So Rabbi Moshe Feinstein rewrote the Tnaim based on the way it's commonly used today, i.e. five minutes before the wedding. The witnesses hereby certify \"that all the involved families have satisfied all claims, holds, and demands, and that it is agreed that the couple may now wed and share their property without any further challenge.\" The Tnaim is done for tradition's sake -- especially if one used the agreement-to-wed language just before the wedding -- and the marriage is still completely binding without it. </p>\n\n\n",

Because of their prayers they were 'changed' round and Yosef is considered Rochels child although made with Leah's 'seed'. Also, since it says one can always be sure who the mother is, that is why you use the mother's name, also proves that the surrogate mother is the one. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><em>Until</em> recently, you knew who the mother was because it's the lady out of whom this baby came. Hence the established practice for using the mother's name when praying for someone sick.</p>\n\n<p>There are many Talmudic precedents that some apply to this -- Rabbi Yissochar Frand has a tape on this that simply concludes \"we're left in doubt.\" Do we compare it to grain that had partially grown, and then was replanted? To a pregnant woman who converts, and thus the fetus is converted <em>in utero</em>? Do we prove from the Dinah midrash that the birth-mother is halachically the mother [as the Torah implies that Leah is the mother], or do we follow the explanation found in one commentary that Shimon was allowed to marry Dinah precisely because they had different egg mothers? (It's debatable how to interpret the Dinah story.)</p>\n\n<p>As for practical rulings: Rabbi Kenneth Brander has a yutorah mp3 on this: most 20th-century American poskim felt that the <em>birth</em> mother is halachically the mother, with Rabbi Aaron Soloveichik zt'l insisting that the egg is viewed by halacha as \"no different than some synthetic product made in Japan.\"</p>\n\n<p>Many Israeli poskim -- plus Rabbis Heinemann and Hopfer in Baltimore -- believe that halacha follows the <em>egg</em> mother.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, some American poskim are starting to reconsider, causing a great deal of consternation. Rabbi Ezra Schwartz has a lecture to rabbinic students at YU where he says: \"when I was sitting in your chair, we were clearly told that the birth mother is the halachic mother. Now ... we're not so sure. And to make it worse, what happens if a Jewish couple in Chicago obtained a non-Jewish donor egg 30 years ago and were given the psak of R' Aaron Soloveichik that the baby did not need conversion because the host mother is Jewish ... now that baby is 30 years old and dating and suddenly today's American rabbis aren't so sure.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As noted by others, the final p'sak is not clear.

Dovid Lichtenstein (published by OU and distributed by Menucha)  He cites support for both sides but, in the summary, he says that it is clear to him that the woman who provided the egg is considered the child's mother, and not the woman who carried the fertilized egg and delivered the infant.</p>\n\n\n",

Preventing non-cohanim accessing the Tabernacle was assigned to the rest of the tribe of Levi (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0401.htm#47\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 1:47-53</a>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did people who were <em>not</em> priests or Levites enter the Tabernacle or the Beth Hamikdash for ritual purposes?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Some relevant passages:</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0301.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 1</a> and subsequent chapters describe the procedures for making various offerings.</p>\n\n<p>In general, a person offering an animal was to bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting. This seems to mean the entrance to the Holy Place, suggesting that the the person making the offering was to bring it inside the courtyard, but outside of (in front of) the curtain or screen (the מָסָךְ, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0226.htm#36\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 26:36</a>) separating the Holy Place from the courtyard (see related question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/57602/what-is-the-door-of-the-tent-of-meeting-in-leviticus-13\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Also, the descriptions of some of the sacrifices seem to include the person who brings the animal slaughtering it by the altar of burnt offering, which was inside the courtyard.

Even though with <em>Shechita</em> a <em>tamei</em> (impure) person could technically stand outside the courtyard in the entrance using a long knife in order to slaughter the animal for the <em>Korban</em> that was inside the courtyard, this was forbidden <em>Miderabanan</em> in case he touched the meat of the <em>Korban</em> rendering it <em>tamei</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As you've probably understood -- the Holy & Holy of Holies were only for the priests (kohanim). Commoners absolutely entered the courtyard, e.g. to bring an animal for sacrifice. Once the Tabernacle was built, the Holy/Holy+ section was referred to as the Ohel Moed (\"Communion Tent\"); commoners would stand \"near the entrance of the Communion Tent\", i.e. in the courtyard, but outside the Holy section. (That's the phrase you'll see all through early Leviticus.)</p>\n\n<p>Numbers 18 could be confusing, but it's best read in context. Recall that some non-kohanim had just tried burning incense. <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's translation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>18:21     To the descendants of Levi, I am now giving all the tithes in Israel as an inheritance. This is in exchange for their work, the service that they perform in the Communion Tent.\n  18:22   The [other] Israelites shall therefore no longer come forth to the Communion Tent, since they can then become guilty of sin and die.\n  18:23   Instead, the necessary service in the Communion Tent will be performed by the Levites, and they will expiate the sins [of the Israelites].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The point is reiterating that commoners not <strong>enter the Communion Tent itself</strong>, i.e. the Holy section; and <strong>not perform any rituals designated for the kohanim</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Here, for example, is I Kings 8:22</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not only is King Solomon (who is descended from Judah and thus not a Kohen) standing right next to the [larger] altar in the Temple courtyard, but so are all the people. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, try <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=31#C4473\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 31:11</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>when all Israel comes to present themselves before God your Lord, in the place that He will choose, you must read [from] this Torah before all Israel, so that they will be able to hear it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Talmud (Sotah 41a) spells out explicitly that this gathering (\"hakhel\") had plenty of non-kohanim standing in the Temple courtyard. Josephus writes about this phenomenon as well. </p>\n\n\n",

The sefer proceeds to explain that it may depend on the following: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Although women use bobby pins, they do not use them to hold a\n<em>kippah</em>, but to hold their hair. Nevertheless, it may be that the bobby pin is considered feminine wear. </li>\n<li>On the other hand, perhaps the bobby pin is not considered a separate item of clothing at all, but merely a <em>chelek</em> of the\n<em>kippah</em>. For this reason, R. Chaim Kanievsky explained that it would not be considered <em>beged ish</em> for a woman to place <em>tzitzis</em>\non her garments--the strings are not an independent garment. If so,\nthe bobby pin too would be permitted. </li>\n<li>On the third hand, unlike the <em>tzitzis</em>, the bobby pin is not tied to the <em>kippah</em> and is not inseparable from it. If so, perhaps\nit should be forbidden. </li>\n<li>But perhaps it should be permitted because many men wear them to hold their yarmulkes. </li>\n<li>Yet maybe people should not have started wearing them, and even though they did we cannot follow their example. </li>\n<li>But in truth, the bobby pin is not worn as an ornament, but merely to hold the <em>kippah</em> in place, so it should be permitted.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

I heard this from a well-known story that the Gedolim weren't sure of this minhag and sent Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky to speak to the Rebbe. Although he didn't know the source for the Rebbe's custom, after the conversation he knew it couldn't haven't been a sin as there is a general rule that mitzvah gorreres mitzvah and eveirah gorreres eveirah (Avos 4:2) and since there weren't any other eveirahs (chas veshalom) by the Rebbe, this couldn't have been one either. I am not even going to try to out due, Saar HaTorah, Rabbi Kanievsky's Chochma in Torah. Still, after delving deeply into Arvei Pesachim almost the entire year (the last and tenth Perek of Meseches Pesachim) whose first half deals extensively with the Halachos of Shabbas mainly regarding Kiddush, Havdalah, and the like I have some ideas that we can put together and create a simple, simple understanding. One of the large concepts discussed there is the mitzvah of Tosefes Shabbas (adding to Shabbas). The extent of this mitzvah's significance alters the Halacha quite a bit regarding how we approach zmanim compared to how we would treat them during the week. One example, we do not wait until Shkiah to daven Maariv even though the kehilla would usually daven Mincha at this time during the week (see Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 76:1.) Tosefes Shabbas is also a consideration for the end of Shabbas. It can even be seen through the Halacha intentionally davening Maariv later and in a more prolonged way with song at the outset of Shabbas (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 96:1.) Now, according to Kittzur Shulchan Aruch 96:15 one can make Havdalah until Tuesday, even if he intentionally didn't say it right after Shabbas (as we would know it Sat. night) and the reason is that \"the three days after Shabbas are included in the general term of Motzei Shabbas.\" Now, combining this idea of Tosefes Shabbas, our understanding that Motzei Shabbas includes Tuesday and allows one to say Havdalah until then even if didn't say intentionally and with the understanding that the Gemara calls a Chassid one who goes beyond the letter of the law (like Menachos 41; in this case, extending and adding to Shabbas as late as possible), then really it seems like the Amnishover is doing the right thing for his level of Avodas H-shem. It's a beautiful role for a man of that level to anchor Am Yisroel as a Talmud Chacham always holding by Shabbas (for 4 days quite literally so). That fits very well with the Gemorah's and Zohar's saying \"Talmud Chacham (is) Shabbas,\" (Zohar Chelek 3, Daf 144b. Daf 29b. See Brachot end of 47b, Shabbat 119a) what's not appropriate for a Rebbe, a Chassidic (implying beyond the letter of the law) Talmud Chacham (implying an inherent spiritual association to Shabbas in general) to keep Shabbas as late as possible?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Regarding Tefillah after zman, there is a Rambam mefurash (Hil' Tefillah and Birkas Kohanim 4:1) that 5 things prevent one from davening even though the time has passed. The 5th one is proper kavannah. Proper kavannah isn't even the right term for the Rebbe. Have you seen his mesader kedushin videos and the intense focus and time he puts into a bracha? Please see it for yourself here (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr_zyzAafnc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr_zyzAafnc</a>), it helps one realize the power and weight of a bracha and davening, both powerful forms of talking to H-shem. For all we know, he could have started davening from Alos HaShachar but had such kavannah that shemoneh esreh is after chatzos (I don't know that for sure other than the length it takes him to say a bracha in this video, please correct me if I'm wrong) which brings me to:</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Kiddush levana, was surprising but sure enough, there was a picture online of such an event (<a href=\"http://lifeinisrael.blogspot.com/2011/08/amshinover-rebbe-says-kiddush-levana.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://lifeinisrael.blogspot.com/2011/08/amshinover-rebbe-says-kiddush-levana.html</a>). We should be dan l'caf zchus (Avot 1:6) based on one of the comments claiming that the individual was there from the beginning and that the Rebbe was there and started at night time but had so much kavannah it became daytime. In that case, the yikar of kiddush levana, just like kiddush on Shabbos is mainly by the bracha and not the Tehillim, Parshas, and/or pesukim before (depending on the nusach), you could bavern the same thing regarding all of the additional pesukim, Gemara passage, and Aleinu after the bracha of kiddush levana. In that case, the Rebbe fulfilled the yikar mitzvah at its time and was mamshich into the daytime.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/d1KtQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/d1KtQ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>There is a statement from the Ruzhiner on the justification for this practice by tzaddikim in spiritual terms here.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>he makes havdala during the week (the Halacha is to say it Motzei Shabbos)\n-one may make havdallah until the tuesday. the problem with delaying havdallah for most people is that one may not eat until after making havdallah. delaying havdallah would then require one to fast. something most would not do but perhaps he does. </p>\n\n<p>he davens Shacharis during the later parts of the day (permitted untill Chatzos-midday) \n- the halacha is to daven within the first 4 hours of the day. there is also a halacha that one must daven with kavana. many are linient in regards to the shemona essray until chatzos since there is also an opinion that says this is ok b/c they are also taking extra time to prepare.

They explain that deciding factor in determining seven or three days is the level of joy of the Chosson, for that is what generates the Brachos. And since this is new to him, its level of joy is not any less than that of marrying a virgin.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding as to why seven days see the Rambam (אבל א-א): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומשה רבינו תקן להם לישראל שבעת ימי אבלות ושבעת ימי המשתה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moshe Rabbeinu instituted for Klal Yisroel seven days of mourning and seven days of rejoicing (ie. Sheva Brachos) </p>\n\n<p>The Radvaz explains the Rambam:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שיהיו ימי האבל כימי השמחה כלומר בימי המשתה יתן אל לבו יום המות וכן אמר\n  שלמה ביום טובה היה בטוב וביום רעה ראה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The days of mourning should be like the days of joy, meaning to say that during the days of rejoicing one should think of the day of death. As Shlomo Hamelech says \"Be pleased when things go well, but in a time of misfortune reflect\"</p>\n\n<p>The commonality of seven days from mourning and marriage is supposed to remind us of the day of death, for us to reflect on our lives.</p>\n\n\n",

If I remember correctly, the Mishna Berurah says that if one will not be able to put them on during the day he may put them on before Alos hashachar. Is there any basis to allow putting them on at night? What if I slept all day thus mitigating the concern of Falling asleep with them on and coming to flatulence, would it permitted then?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Ovadia Yosef permits putting them on Bein Hashmashos with a Bracha (<a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=1114\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>), which is interesting given that the Rambam implies it is an issur dioraisa to put them on at night (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=2&hilchos=8&perek=4&halocha=11&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tefillin 4:11</a>), but Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x384\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.C. 30:2</a>) does not pasken that way, and leaves it as equally rabbinic to leave them on or to put them on (or actually more of a problem to put them on).</p>\n\n<p>If, however, one has already davened Maariv, even if it is still before Shekia, Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x385\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.C. 30:5</a>) says to not put on Tefilin, and Rav Ovadia Yosef paskens to put them on without a Bracha (during Bein Hashmashos), apparently agreeing with the Magein Avraham there as well as the Shulchan Aruch HaRav (<a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/5/30/5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.C. 30:5</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The distinction between the above and the case you quote in your question, which is the Din in Shulchan Aruch O.C. 30:3, is that when it is before Alos HaShachar it is being done for the morning, but even then the Magain Avraham limits this to walking, not sitting in a coach where one may fall asleep. Rabbi J.B. Soliveitchik is quoted <a href=\"http://www.etzion.org.il/vbm/archive/metho63/11tfillin.rtf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> (link downloads a file) as saying the distinction is that when the Tiffilin is being put on for the sake of the morning, even before Alos HaShachar, it is OK because it is for the sake of the day time, which would not be the case if you are putting it on at the beginning or middle of the night.</p>\n\n<p>So from all of this you see that actually putting them on at actual night time is not permitted. There is a dissenting opinion in Rishonim (I <a href=\"http://www.kipa.co.il/jew/1049.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">have seen</a> Rabbeinu Yona quoted as one) - that the idea of הלכה אין מורין כן (discussed in the above sources) applies even to putting on Tefilin at night, so the whole rabbinic prohibition - according to that opinion - isn't that strict, it is more about how people in general should be trained rather than a strict prohibition.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yahadoot.net/item.asp?id=857&cid=16\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a> Rav Ovadia Yosef is quoted as saying that a soldier in a non-Jewish army that is simply not allowed the opportunity to put on Tefilin during the day light hours should put them on at night without a Bracha.</p>\n\n\n",

There are opinions allowing it, though.</p>\n\n<p>Excerpt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a controversy in tractate Avodah Zarah 27a regarding this\n  very issue between Daru bar Papa who cites in the name of Rav and\n  Rabbi Yochanan. Here is the substance of the argument. Daru b. Papa\n  held that only someone who is obligated to observe the precept of\n  circumcision can act as Mohel for others, whereas R. Yochanan felt\n  that a woman can act as a Mohelet as indicated in the story of\n  Tziporah (see Exodus 4:24‑26 for details). You could say she was a\n  Moyhel of a goy’ol (pardon the pun!)...</p>\n  \n  <p>In practical terms, R. Yosef Caro, the Halacha follows R. Yochanan and\n  a woman may act as Mohelet (Yoreh Deah 264:1) but Maimonides adds one\n  stipulation: this only applies in the event that a male Mohel is not\n  available (MT, Hilchot Milah 2:1). However, Rema cites authorities who\n  differ on this matter</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article author cites a theory which, to me, seems speculative. Is there any reason emanating from Responsa or some Rabbinical decision or custom that discourages or prevents the use of <em>mohalot</em>? It seems that their use is rare in Orthodox circumcision but somewhat common in Reform circumcisions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>You've already cited the relevant source, but maybe it's worth seeing the Shulchan Arukh (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%93\">YD 264:1</a>) inside:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הכל כשרים למול אפי' עבד אשה וקטן וערל ישראל שמתו אחיו מחמת מילה ואם יש ישראל גדול שיודע למול הוא קודם לכלם (וי\"א דאשה לא תמול וכן נוהגין להדר אחר איש).‏<br>\n  All can circumcise, even a slave or a woman or a child or an uncircumcised Jew.

(This is how the Shakh, Levush, Beer Heitev, and Arukh haShulchan, and it seems from the Beit Yosef there that he is trying to rule like the Rambam (Milah 2:1) where this point could not be clearer.

When they ate, they would discuss Torah and when one answered another's question, they would all clap and cheer and one sage would sing a song of praise and they would all join in, the men by themselves and the women by themselves, and they would sing until sunrise, upon which they would once again separate to contemplate.

And some of them would fast for three or even six days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only relation I see here to Nazirites is their abstinence from wine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Revel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Bernard Revel</a> in <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/karaitehalakahit00reverich\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Karaite Halakah</a> also wrote about them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The tenth century Karaite, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Qirqisani\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abu Yusuf al-Kirkisani</a>, in his work <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Qirqisani#Kitab_al-Anwar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitab al-anwar wal-marakib</a> (written 937), speaks of a Jewish Sect named \"the Magarites\" (אלמגאריה). This sect, says Kirkisani, sprang up before the rise of Christianity. The adherents of the sect make the biblical passages that speak of the attributes of God refer to an angel who, according to them, created the world (ed. Harkavy, 304). Among them are the works of the \"Alexandrine\" (אלכסאנדראני) which are the best of the \"books of the Cave\" (ib., 283). The same author, speaking of Benjamin Nahawendin whom he considers the second founder of Karaism, says that Benjamin's belief that an angel created the world is similar to the view held by the Alexandrine (ib., 314). Harkavy ingeniously suggested that these \"Magarites\" are the Egyptian Essenes, known as the Therapeutae. The \"Alexandrine\" whose works they so highly estimated is <em>no other than Philo</em> (ib., 256 ff.) and Nahawedni's \"Angel\" goes back to Philo's \"logos\".\" (pg. 87)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, according to Rabbi Revel, who quotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Harkavy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Albert Harkavy</a>, we can add a gnostic-like theology (i.e. that God created the world through a subordinate but powerful entity that possibly also runs the world) to the Therapeutae, their holding Philo in high esteem, and also another name, the Magarites or Magharians. This idea is also mentioned by Rabbi Ya'avetz <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36989&st=&pgnum=183\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

In the second answer, The Chasam, Sofer says that since we say Nishtane Hateva (nature has changed and thus things stated in the Talmud that once did affect a persons health) technically there should be no reason to keep meat and fish separate. He says, according to this, that if a pot was used to cook fish, and thus absorbed its taste, one does not need to kasher the pot in order to use it for meat despite the concern for the danger. </p>\n\n<p>The basis for this answer is that the Chasam Sofer draws attention to the fact that the Rambam omits certain dinim of cooking meat and fish together, which the Gemara took to be dangerous. The Chasam Sofer attributes this to the fact that, according to the Rambam, nature had changed. Nevertheless, we still keep these dinim under the category of minhag. </p>\n\n<p>Based off of this, Rav Reisman suggests that a convert need not keep a separation between meat and fish, as the only reason that we keep such a practice, is because of the minhag, which of course, a convert does not have.</p>\n\n<p>For a fuller treatment of this topic, <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/735391/Rabbi_Aryeh_Lebowitz/Eating_Fish_and_Meat_Together\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Please note this site is not a replacement for calling a competent Halachic Authority</em></strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Shulchan Orach Chaim siman 173 where this law is discussed the Magen Avraham #1 writes \"perhaps nowadays there is not such a health issue, as we see many items mentioned in the gemara as dangerous for (i.e. makes one susceptible to) an evil spirit And other issues, and nowadays they cause no harm for the natures changed. Also all these issues follow the nature of the lands. And see Yoreh Deah siman 316 siff 3 and Even HaEzer siman 156. And the Bach writes the same in the name of the Rambam.\"</p>\n\n<p>This Magen Avraham us quoted concisely in Mishna Berurah #3. The Aruch HaShulchan also brings this Magen Avraham and goes on to mention a Tosafos that writes similarly that some communities won't eat fish after meat while some do. </p>\n\n<p>Most people I know will not mix the two, but are also not aware of all of the above.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/23423/21\">discussed previously</a>, fish-and-meat is an odd one that made it onto the halacha books. But it's become normative Orthodox practice in [virtually?] all communities at this point. (Rabbi Hershel Schachter said \"well theoretically it should be allowed ... but my wife won't let me serve it at my house ... if I was a guest at someone else's house ... well I <em>should</em> be allowed to eat it ... <em>but</em> ...)</p>\n\n<p>As a matter of practicality, I would advise converts to conform (within reason) to the norms of their local Jewish communities; it's good for communal cohesion. Fish-and-meat (the way it's commonly observed -- no need for separate dishes or anything) isn't <em>that</em> hard to keep, so it's worthwhile for sociological reasons, if nothing else.</p>\n\n<p>(I would, however, add that mainstream centrist Orthodox practice is that it ceases to be a problem in large dilutions; thus you can serve orange-juice-with-Omega-3 marked as \"OK-Fish\" at a meat meal, though some Hassidim won't eat it.)</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Hirsch (1808 – 1888) \"<a href=\"https://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/an-interview-with-michah-gottlieb-moses-mendelssohn-as-a-guide-for-orthodoxy/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">praised Mendelssohn as ‘a most brilliant and respected personality whose commanding influence has dominated developments to this day.</a>\" In his article \"Mendelssohn in Nineteenth Century Rabbinic Literature,\"\nMeir Hildesheimer describes Rav Hirsch's attitude toward Mendelssohn at length:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Hirsch bewailed the fact that Mendelssohn had not completed his\nwork. Had he been able to do so, it stands to reason that the Reform\nmovement might never have come into being. This attitude seems to\nreflect the change that took place in the status of Orthodoxy in\nGermany in the 1840's. At this time it was gaining strength and\nchanging from a passive to an aggressive position. Nevertheless, on\nthe whole, Rabbi Hirsch does not seem to have been seriously\ndisquieted by Mendelssohn. This emerges from an article written by his\nson, Isaac Hirsch, on the one hundredth anniversary of Mendelssohn's\ndeath. Rabbi Hirsch was still alive at the time, and there is reason\nto believe that he endorsed the article. Mendelssohn is termed \"one of\nthe noblest sons of Israel,\" who had taken his place among the\nrighteous and honest men in heaven. His memory remains alive amongst\nmen who pay homage and admiration to his blessed work. Mendelssohn had\ndevoted his life to bringing \"true joy,\" but for us he would always be\nremembered as \"a great and noble Jew\" by virtue of his contribution to\nand appreciation of Judaism. He served as \"a supremexample of truly\ndevout Jewish conduct\" together with a broad knowledge of all of the\nscientific disciplines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The same article describes R. Azriel Hildesheimer's (1820-1899) attitude:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer, the rabbi of the Adat Israel community in\nBerlin, and head of the Rabbinical Seminary, credited Mendelssohn,\n\"the great worldly sage,\" for his theory and practice of Judaism, for\nhis influence in Jewish political and civil circles, and his value as\na source for scholars in mattters of religious life and attitudes.\nMendelssohn was a loyal adherent of his religion, and acknowledged the\nsame in his writings. In thought and practice, in his philosophy and\nconduct, he upheld the Biblical-Talmudic basis of Judaism. His work\nwas faithfully depicting Judaism to members of the alien culture,\namong them philosophers, scholars and the higher echelons of society.\n\"Small minds\" who sought to raise themselves to a level of importance\nwhich they did not deserve, by climbing on his shoulders, called\nthemselves his disciples and heirs, although they did not conduct\nthemselves in accordance with either his spirit or his actions. They\ncrudely distorted the essence of his philosophy, and thus dishonored\nhim in the eyes of the vast majority of their peers. As a result,\nMendelssohn was then held responsible for the actions of these\n\"disciples\" of his.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other recognized gedolim who quote Mendelssohn include: R. Akiva Eiger (see Chiddushei R. Akiva Eiger Brachos 13a and Megillah 17a <a href=\"http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2007/08/02/r-akiva-eiger-mendelsohn-and-the-shema/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quoted here</a>, R.

Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg (1785-1865), the author of Ha-Ksav ve-haKabbalah, in addition to writing a haskamah for the Biur on Vayikra, quotes Mendelssohn on numerous occasions (Shemos 10:8, 10:23, 14:13, 21:34, 22:3, 23:33; Vayikra 23:2). R. Tzvi Hirsch Kalischer (1795-1874) quotes Mendelssohn in a letter to R. Akiva Eiger (Derishas Tziyon [Jerusalem, 1947] p. 87) and refers to him as \"a great man and crown of the sages.\" R. Shmuel Strashun, better known as the Rashash, quotes Mendelssohn in Ta'anis 9b, Yevamos 62b, and Horiyos 11b. (Almost all of these sources are taken from Meir Hildesheimer, \"Mendelssohn in Nineteenth Century Rabbinic Literature.\")</p>\n<p>The Maharam Schick (1807-1889) relates the following episode (<a href=\"http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2007/08/02/r-akiva-eiger-mendelsohn-and-the-shema/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">from this article by R. Shnayer Leiman</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was the custom of the Hatam Sofer, when visiting a Jewish community\noutside of Pressburg, to attend services Sabbath morning in the\ncommunity synagogue, after which he would accompany the Rabbi to his\nhome. There he would \"order\" the Rabbi to deliver an aggadic sermon,\nafter which the Hatam Sofer would also preach. Now it was his practice\nnever to recite a verse from Scripture by heart, and so [when he\nvisited my community] he requested a printed humash containing the\nappropriate weekly reading. At the time, I owned three printed\neditions of the Torah. One was an Amsterdam edition with the standard\nTargums and commentaries. That edition I used to keep in the synagogue\nover Sabbath, so that it would not be necessary for me to carry on the\nSabbath. [It, therefore, was not available in my home.] Another\nedition—printed in Vienna— belonged to my wife, the Rebbetzin, and it\ntoo was kept in the synagogue over Sabbath for her use. The third\nedition, the only one I kept in the house, contained Mendelssohn's\ntranslation and Biur. When the Hatam Sofer requested a printed humash,\nand those who were providing for his needs knew that it was his\npractice not to use the edition with Mendelssohn's Biur, he was\ninformed that they could not locate a printed humash. Given the\ncircumstances, he proceeded to preach and recite the verses by heart.\nHe was astounded, however, that a humash could not be located in the\nRabbi's house! After the exchange of words of Torah in my home, the\npious and righteous R. Hirsch Tyrnau, who was treated as a member of\nthe Hatam Sofer's family, went to visit him at the home where he was\nstaying. The Hatam Sofer queried him about the shortage of humashim in\nthe Rabbi's house. R. Hirsch Tyrnau then explained to the Hatam Sofer\nwhat had really occurred. When I arrived for the Minha service at the\nhome where the Hatam Sofer was staying, he rebuked me for reading, and\nstudying from, Mendelssohn's Biur. I informed him that a respected\ncolleague, who was considered a righteous Jew even by the Hatam Sofer,\ntestified before me that a well known Gaon used to study the Biur,\nespecially to the book of Leviticus. The Hatam Sofer responded that,\nin truth, that Gaon did not do well in this matter. I also excused\nmyself by informing him that I had read through the entire Biur and\ndid not find anything that even smacked of heresy or a passage that\nwas suspect in any way! The Hatam Sofer responded: \"See the Biur to\nDeuteronomy, chapter so and so, and you will find a heretical\ncomment.\" Although the passage he cited is not necessarily decisive,\nnonetheless the Hatam Sofer has ruled and who would contravene his\nruling? In any event, it is evident that he considered Mendelssohn a\nheretic, and his book a heretical work. That is why he had no\ncompunctions about Heidenheim's translation of the Torah; it was\nspecifically Mendelssohn's translations and commentaries that he\ninterdicted. He would not touch them, he kept them at a distance, for\nthey had the status of heretical works (see b. Sabbath 116a-b). But we\nnever heard that, if perchance a volume of Mendelssohn's Biur came\ninto his hands, he cast it to the ground.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All this should suffice to prove that Mendelssohn was quoted by many gedolim, in his time and beyond his time, although there were also those who opposed his works, especially among the Chassidim.

    "content": "# Mesader Kidushin late - How long to wait?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A fellow honors a Rabbi to be Mesader Kidushin. The time of the wedding arrives and the Rabbi is not there yet. Is there a official amount of time that one should wait prior to honoring a different Rabbi? Concerns from one side are taking away a Mitzva from someone, making them feel uncomfortable, etc.. From the other side there are people that are on a tight schedule, wedding may cost more if it goes into overtime, etc..</p>\n\n<p>Now I imagine a Yekke would say \"he's late, too bad\". A Sefardi might say \"Wait 2 hours\". I am  looking for preferably a sourced answer or a Maase Rav. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I haven't been able to locate any direct resource that addresses this problem, that, hopefully, does not occur too frequently. But, here are some concerns that I think would cause problems if you waited too long.</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest concerns is regarding a wedding that occurs close to twilight. This was a concern at my wedding and the mesader kiddushin (who, because he was a very close friend of the bride, came very early as he was part of the picture taking), informed us that the <em>chuppah</em> cannot occur during twilight, i.e. between sunset and nightfall. The reason is that there is doubt as to which calendar day that is. Furthermore, if the wedding was scheduled before twilight (in my case, it was), and you waited until after nightfall, it requires changing the date on the ketubah. As, in most cases, where the date is calligraphed on the ketubah, making this change is not that simple. So, in short, if the rabbi's lateness causes this problem, you can't wait past a certain point.</p>\n\n<p>The next biggest problem that I see is <em>chisaron mamon</em> - monetary loss. The host is paying musicians and the caterer hourly and overtime usually has a minimum 1 hour charge. That can be very costly. The wedding expenses are high enough without adding unexpected hardship. Related to this, you may not even be able to go overtime if the caterer has booked another event after yours. Or, perhaps, the caterer has commitments from his staff to work only a certain number of hours. They've committed to that. The caterer and the staff, as well as the musicians, etc. have a right to go home to their families, or maybe they have other jobs after your event. So, you could be causing that staff <em>chisaron mamon</em>. In short, you need to ask the caterer what the situation is to judge how long you can wait.</p>\n\n<p><em>Tircha d'tzibur</em> - \"burdening the crowd\" could be another issue. Sometimes, many of your guests have other commitments. Some people have to attend other <em>simchot</em> on the same day as yours. Even if that's not the case, let's say you make everything outdoors in the summer when it's hot. (Yes, I think it's unpleasant when the host does that, but, it's their wedding, and I chose to come.) Guests are sitting in the heat, which they expect and can tolerate up to a point. If you keep them waiting around too long, you're unreasonably burdening them. In other situations, granted if things run late for them, they can leave early, but is that really what you would like esp. for close friends that help enhance the simcha? They want to be there as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Along with these factors, you should consider the reason for the delay. These days, when you can reach the rabbi on the cell phone, you can at least get a better sense of how long the delay will be. (Was much harder pre-cell phone.) If the rabbi says, \"I'm stuck before an accident scene with a train hitting a car, and it looks like it will take a few hours\", well, then, at least, you know what to do!</p>\n\n<p>The above are some, but not all factors that I can think of, offhand.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Issur Sefichin on Otzar Beis Din produce\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Sages were concerned that individuals would plant vegetables in the seventh year and claim that these had grown by themselves. They therefore forbade consumption of Shemitta vegetables where the planting may have been during the Shemitta year itself. The date that this restriction starts depends on the type of vegetable and how long it takes to grow. this is known as Sefichin.</p>\n\n<p>Otzar Beis Din is a representative of the public interest by hiring people to pick and transport the produce to a distribution center near the consumer. paying them wage appropriate to his significant skills and experience in knowing how to manage this operation. the money does not go to towards the produce, rather to the workers effort in collecting, thus mitigating the concern for using shmita produce in commerce. This is all legitimate use of an otzar beis din.</p>\n\n<p>Is there an issur of Sefichin regarding produce bought through Otzar Beis Din? how can we know that the landowner is not working on the field, but claiming it grew wild, Does Otzar Beis Din also mitigate the issue of Sefichin? Is that fact that the field is under the auspices of the Otzar Beis Din enough of a reason to assume that the farmer isn't working on the field?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A proper Otzar Beis Din does not collect vegetables which are subject to the issur of Sefichin, rather they only deal with fruits, which Chazal never instituted and were not concerned for Sefichin. Sefichin was never instituted for fruits which grow and die yearly which grow by themselves usually without any tending to, therefore there is little incentive for a farmer to work on them during shmittah. </p>\n\n<p>Thus Otzar Beis Din and and Sefichin have nothing to do with each other.</p>\n\n\n",

I was reading through some of the autobiographical essays of R.

For about seven years (1926-1933), he was a rabbi in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>He has several pages recounting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Mordechai_Epstein\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Moshe Mordechai Epstein</a>'s visit to L.A. (during which he stayed at R. Essrig's house) at around the beginning of his tenure there. Before the great Rosh Yeshiva left, the Jews of L.A. had a large good-bye <em>\"mesiba\"</em>, which he describes at length (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21395&st=&pgnum=19\" rel=\"noreferrer\">link</a>). But guess who else made a guest appearance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בהמסבה הקדושה הזאת השתתף החזן המפורסם מנגן בחסד עליון ירא וחרד לדבר ה׳ ונכבד מאד ״יוסלי״ רוזנבלט ז״ל, שהיה אז אורח בל. א. לרגלי השתתפותו בעבודת התמונה הידועה ״סאני בני״ הביאוגראפיא של שחקן הדרמתי והמנגן הגדול והמפורסם ״על (עי״ן סגולה) דזאהנסאן וחלקו של יוסלי הוא תפלת ״כל נדרי״. אחרי שנגמרה נדבות הקהל נתכבד החזן י. להשמיע קולו כי ערב (עי״ן קמוצה ורי״ש צרוי׳) ושר תקליטו הידוע שלו ״אלוקי נשמה שנתת בי״</p>\n<p>At this holy gathering participated the famous <em>chazzan</em> who sings with the grace of God, a God-fearing man who trembles at the word of God, the very honorable \"Yossele\" Rosenblatt z\"l, who was then visiting L. A. on the occasion of his participation in the making of the film \"Sonny My Son\" (?), a biography of the drama actor and great singer Al Johnson [sic?]; and Yossele's part in it was the prayer <em>\"Kol Nidre\"</em>. After the contributions of the community, Yossele the <em>chazzan</em> was honored to sing with his sweet voice; he sang [the song from] his well-known album: <em>\"Elokai Neshama Shenasata Bi\"</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't know what he's talking about. \"סאני בני\"? I looked around on the internet, but I can't find anything that would resemble this title featuring Yossele Rosenblatt. I think it's relatively safe to say that Rabbi Essrig here is relying on his memory to recall what happened some 40-50 years prior to when he wrote this. He's probably talking about \"The Jazz Singer\" which did come out around that time, and he probably means \"Al Jolson\" rather than \"Al Johnson\". (Also the movie plot was fictional rather than being a biography of Jolson.)</p>\n<p>Whatever the case may be, though, R. Essrig ceratinly seems to have had a high regard for Rosenblatt, both as a singer and as a person.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What to do if mother-in-law is singing at meal?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How should one act halachically if he invites not so observant female family members (specifically mother in law) at the shabbat table and they start singing.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There's nothing you can do. Just don't pay attention to her voice (assuming, for the sake of the question, that your Rov holds kol isha is forbidden even for Shabbos zemiros). If you tell her to stop, or even hint, that would be perceived as rude, and it would alienate her from Yiddishkeit and perhaps prevent her from coming closer to observance. If she becomes more observant, she will learn on her own. </p>\n\n<p>This is standard kiruv practice. Can you imagine a Chabad rabbi or rebbetzin telling the women in a Chabad house shul to stop singing? They would never do such a thing, because they know it is counterproductive. Sometimes one has to sacrifice one's own stringency for the sake of someone else's growth (The Gutnick Chumash discusses this idea.) (I understand that this is not a matter of a chumra but of different halachic opinions of differing stringency.)</p>\n\n<p>In addition, correcting your mother-in-law in front of your wife is never a good idea, since your wife will likely get angry and take her side. Source for most of the above: the \"Fifth Book of the Shulchan Aruch\" (Common Sense). </p>\n\n<p>Note that in a similar situation, when in the Israeli army troops had to attend a concert with kol isha, some rabbis (such as Lazer Brody, if I remember correctly) advised religious soldiers to simply tune it out and ignore it rather than getting up and leaving and thus causing a scene.</p>\n\n<p>I would make an exception to the above advice for someone who is reasonable certain they can mention the issue (perhaps not on Shabbos or if it comes up in conversation) so that she learns about kol isha, without offending her or alienating her from Judaism. If that is the case, then he could do so.</p>\n\n<p>If your rabbi holds that this type of kol isha should be avoided at all costs, regardless of other considerations, then don't invite them, or find a polite way to inform her about kol isha. An intermediate alternative would be to sing wordless niggunim or songs without pesukim, to avoid reciting pesukim in the presence of ervah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Were there particular reasons to vow the value of a person?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9928#showrashi=true\">Vayikra 27</a> covers when a man vows the \"valuation\" (עֶרְכְּךָ) of a person.  The values are based on age and are different for men and women (50 shekels for a man between 20 and 60, for example).  A note in the Stone Chumash contrasts this \"fee schedule\" with vowing the value of an individual as a slave, where the amount would depend on strength, skills, and other factors.  Rashi on 27:3 explains the valuation thus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the [fixed] value… shall be: The value stated here is not an expression of monetary value [the usual market value of a person sold as a slave], but, whether he has a high market value or a low one, the value fixed for him in this passage is according to his age.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(I can't remember, and Google didn't help me find, where the torah discusses vowing the market valuation.)</p>\n\n<p>All this got me wondering: when did people do this?  Were there particular circumstances under which it was customary to vow the value of a person at all?  (I saw a reference somewhere to times of danger but don't remember where or if it was a reliable source.) And within that, what governed whether you vowed the slave-valuation or the fixed valuation in Vayikra 27?  Did they accomplish different spiritual or practical ends?</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to understand all this in the context of what people did when it was possible to make dedications to the Temple, and I feel like I'm missing some key factors.  And I'm not even sure what sources to consult.  A comment on Rashi on the previous verse led me to Arachin 20 (which talks about implementation, e.g. when the one who vowed dies), so maybe that tractate contains the answer, but it's a lot to just start reading through.  (I didn't see it on the couple dafim near 20.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Were there particular circumstances under which it was customary to vow the value of a person at all?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not being acquainted with the popular customs of the Temple period, I couldn't say. I defer to others on answering this point.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] what governed whether you vowed the slave-valuation or the fixed valuation in Vayikra 27?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The determinant of whether you paid a fixed value <em>erech</em> or a <em>neder nedavah</em> of a slave valuation is solely the language used in the vow itself - if you vow someone's <strong>value</strong>, that's a <em>nedava</em>, while if you vow their <em><strong>erech</strong></em>, that's a fixed amount.</p>\n<p>The <em>Arachin</em> makes some clear distinctions between these two options. For example, in the first <em>perek</em> (translation mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>א,ב</strong>  הנוכרי--רבי מאיר אומר, נערך, אבל לא מעריך; רבי יהודה אומר, מעריך, אבל לא נערך.  וזה וזה מודים, שהן נודרין ונידרין.</p>\n<p><em>The non-Jew -- Rabbi Meir says \"They may be the subject of an</em> erech-<em>vow but may not take an</em> erech-<em>vow. Rabbi Yehudah says \"They may take an</em> erech-<em>vow but not be the subject of an</em> erech-<em>vow. Both of these (Rabbis) agree that they may make a [donation] vow (of 'slave value') and be \"vowed.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question is whether the <em>possukim</em> in the Torah discussing the <em>erech</em> valuations is restricted to Jews (in that only Jews have a set <em>erech</em>) or whether the <strong>act of taking an <em>erech</em>-vow</strong> is restricted to Jews (but the <em>erech</em> evaluations discussed apply to all individuals). The former application holds that non-Jews may make the <em>erech</em>-vow to establish a monetary obligation (possibly an inclusion from <em>ish</em>), but it can only be made upon the value of a specified Jewish individual. The latter holds that only Israel, the audience in Vayikra 27, is capable to making the <em>erech</em>-vow but that language of the <em>possukim</em> allows for vowing of any human subject (possibly an inclusion from <em>b'erkecha n'fashos</em>).</p>\n<p>Both opinions hold that <strong>any</strong> individual may establish a monetary obligation on themselves (or be the object of such an obligation) to the Temple by taking a <em>neder</em> - the <em>possukim</em> in <em>Devarim</em> (23:22-24) do not have any language that restricts the <em>neder</em> process to Jews (both as donators or as objects of the vow).</p>\n<p>Another important distinction is made in the fifth <em>perek</em> (again, translation mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ה,ב</strong>  דמי ידי עליי--שמין אותו, כמה הוא שווה ביד, וכמה הוא שווה בלא יד.  זה חומר בנדרים מבערכים.  חומר בערכים מבנדרים כיצד:  האומר ערכי עליי, ומת--ייתנו הירושים; דמי עליי, ומת--לא ייתנו הירושים, שאין דמים למתים.  ערך ידי וערך רגלי עליי, לא אמר כלום; ערך ראשי וערך כבדי עליי, נותן ערך כולו.  זה הכלל--דבר שהנשמה תלויה בו, נותן ערך כולו.</p>\n<p><em>[One who says] \"The value of my hand is upon me [to donate]\" -- we evaluate him, how much is he worth with a hand, and how much is he worth without a hand. This is the stringency of vows over</em> arachim <em>. How are</em> arachim <em>more stringent than vows? One who says \"My</em> erech <em>is upon me\" and dies -- their inheritors must give it. \"My value is upon me\" and dies -- the inheritors do not give it, since there is no value to the dead. [One who says] \"The</em> erech <em>of my hand or foot is upon me\" has said nothing. \"The</em> erech <em>of my head or liver is upon me\" donates their entire</em> erech <em>. This is the rule -- anything that the life is dependent upon, you give the entire</em> erech.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The distinction made between a <em>nedavah</em> and an <em>erech</em>-vow is similar to that made between a <em>nedavah</em> and a <em>neder</em> vis a vis korbanos - the <em>erech/neder</em> is placed upon the oath-taker and therefore there is a lien on their property (the obligation isn't discharged by death). A <em>nedavah</em> is always on an object and the death/destruction of that object eliminates the <em>nedavah</em> (since, for example, the person or animal is now worthless).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did they accomplish different spiritual or practical ends?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hypothetically, based upon the end of 5:2 one can posit that the <em>erech</em> verses <strong>specify</strong> a valuation of the <strong>soul</strong> while the <em>neder nedavah</em> constitutes a de facto valuation of the <strong>body</strong>. Regardless, both <em>erech</em> and <em>neder nedavah</em> simply comprise financial \"obligations\" (and the method of discharging those obligations) voluntarily accepted by individuals to donate to the <em>Bais Hamikdash</em>. Any further distinction could be made in the minds of the donator.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You asked: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All this got me wondering: when did people do this? Were there particular circumstances under which it was customary to vow the value of a person at all? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All I found so far was the <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01615.html#HtmpReportNum0026_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra on Yavikra 27:1</a> who says <em>the reason [for the Erech value] that a person vows saying \"if Hashem will do such & such for me, I will redeem my soul for my value, or my son's value or my animal's value\"</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>בערכך נפשות</strong>. הטעם שידור נדר לאמר אם השם יעשה לי כך אפדה נפשי כדי ערכי או ערך בני או ערך בהמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He doesn't mention that the person vowing is in danger, per se, but that could be one scenario.</p>\n\n\n",

(Source - I worked for one, once.)</p>\n\n<p>Given that, if someone has a magazine subscription that they let lapse, but the magazine keeps sending them, is he or she obligated to proactively inform them to stop mailing the magazine? And if so, how far do they have to go to get it to stop?</p>\n\n<p>To avoid some potential leniency, please assume in this case the magazine owner is Jewish.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://businesshalacha.com/en/newsletter/renew-now\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Business Halacha Institute</a> discusses your very question about a Jewish newspaper:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The magazine was aware that your subscription expired, yet knowingly\n  sent additional issues,” explained Rabbi Dayan. “The Gemara (B.M. 23b,\n  25b, 31a) teaches that there is no obligation of hashavas aveidah when\n  someone is knowingly reckless with his property (aveidah midaas). We\n  do not have to take greater responsibility for his property than he\n  does.”</p>\n  \n  <p>“There is a dispute whether someone who is knowingly reckless with his\n  property abandons ownership,” replied Rabbi Dayan. “For example, one\n  who throws his wallet into the street and leaves it there. The Rambam\n  maintains that you have no responsibility to return it to the owner,\n  but it is not hefker (ownerless) and you may not take the wallet.\n  However, the Tur understands that anyone can take the wallet. The\n  owner effectively renounced ownership of the wallet when he threw it\n  in the street, so it becomes ownerless” (C.M. 261:4).\n  “The company has no interest in retrieving the magazine that was\n  distributed. This is similar to a farmer who moved his grain and left\n  some stalks behind, where everyone agrees that he forgoes them. He\n  abandons them for takers, since it’s not worth his while to collect\n  them” (C.M. 260:7; Bach, C.M. 273).</p>\n  \n  <p>“Furthermore, often companies continue to send issues to a subscriber\n  intending that he read them,” concluded Rabbi Dayan, “either with the\n  hope that he will renew or to maintain circulation numbers for\n  advertisers. Thus you are allowed to read the magazine and are not\n  under any financial obligation to them. Nonetheless, if the company is\n  Jewish-owned, you should notify them that your subscription expired in\n  case there is an unintended error.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

That doesn't mean that you can't tell your son a bit about his Jewish ancestry. Whatever aspects are important to you, you can simply tell him. </p>\n\n<p>If you love doing volunteer work and feeding the hungry, you can tell him about how Judaism believes strongly in those things. If you like a good potato kugel, you can serve that in your house and tell him that it's a Jewish dish that you have a connection to.

In many cities (at least in the US) there are \"Introduction to Judaism\" classes, taught by local rabbis.  These classes are mainly aimed at people considering conversion to Judaism, but they are also attended by people like you -- born Jews who for whatever reason don't know much about Judaism and want to change that.  Sometimes they're attended by couples where one is a Jew and the other is considering conversion; in that case sometimes the Jew needs to learn as much as the would-be convert, and that's considered normal and acceptable.  It wouldn't be weird for a Jew to take such a class, in other words.</p>\n\n<p>The only obligation arising from these classes is to pay the course fee; there is no presumption that non-Jews will actually convert or that any attendee will join a synagogue or become more observant.  (But if that's what someone seeks, the class provides an entry point and an opportunity to \"shul shop\".)</p>\n\n<p>There are also many fine books and online resources (including Mi Yodeya!).  What a class gives you is the direct human element; interacting with the same group of fellow learners over a period of time strengthens you in ways that it's harder to get when working alone.  Fortunately it's not either/or but both/and. :-)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>That's all about how you <em>learn</em> your heritage.  As you noted, your wife is not Jewish and so your son is not Jewish per halacha.  It is best if you do not, therefore, tell him he is Jewish.  But he is your son and has your heritage as part of his <em>history</em>.  Focus on that.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Staying up all night and suffering on Yom Tov\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Maharal in his commentary on the Haggada (<em>Gevurot Hashem</em>) explains the significance that the Tannaim were relating the story of the Exodus until they were informed by a student that it was time for the morning recitation of the Shema. He says that it is to inform us how it was that they were able to stay up all night in spite of the biblical prohibition of <em>mitzta'er</em> (causing oneself to suffer) on Yom Tov, namely, that they became so engrossed in <em>sippur yetziat mitzrayim</em>, they simply lost track of time. This raises an obvious question regarding the recently* widespread custom of staying up all night, e.g. on Shavuot. Is there a discussion in contemporary (or earlier) halachic authorities about <em>mitzta'er</em> with regard to staying up all night (especially in reference to the contemporary custom on Shavuot)?</p>\n\n<p>*The Aruch HaShulchan mentions a custom of pious individuals to stay up all night on Shavuot. This custom perhaps would have been less problematic since those individuals may have been qualified to gauge their own ability to stay up without halachically-significant discomfort. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=501&st=&pgnum=111&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tephichas BeDevash 24</a> by Rav Chiya Pontromili (a Sefardi Rav from the 19th century <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01603.html#HtmpReportNum0075_L2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">quoted here</a>) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואף שנהגו ישראל להיות ערים בליל שבועות אפילו שחל בשבת, מכל מקום שונה ליל שבועות מליל שבת, משום שבליל שבועות יש בו סודות גדלים, שעל ידי נדידת השינה ולימוד התורה בעשרה הנעשה באותו הלילה, מתקנים תכשיטים לכלה, וכמה מעלות טובות מפורשות בזוהר הקדוש על ענין הלימוד כל הלילה בליל שבועות, וכבר נודע המעשה שאירע לרבינו הקדוש מרן הבית יוסף זיע\"א. וכיון שנעשה תיקון גדול בשמים, כדאי להצטער צער מועט כדי להשיג המעלה הגדולה ההיא, ודמי למה שכתבו הפוסקים שמי שיש לו עונג על ידי הבכיה, מותר לו לבכות בשבת</p>\n<p>Even though Jews have a custom to remain awake on the night of Shavuos even if it falls on Shabbos [sic], nevertheless the night of Shavuos is different than the night of Shabbos, because the night of Shavuos has big secrets ...

He answers that (according to the second opinion) the Jordan went higher than the clouds.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, there's a Gemara in Yoma (31a) which says that we learn from the fact that the Mikva in the Beis Hamikdash was 22 amos above ground that the spring from which it drew was that high, as Rashi says there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בוה מקרקע עזרה עשרים ושלש אמות. כמדת גובה שער המים ובנין כלי של שלש אמות מלמעלה להחזיק ארבעים סאה שאי אפשר למים לעלות להר שהוא גבוה ממקום שנובעין שם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Water can't rise higher than its source.</p>\n\n<p>The source of the Jordan is the Kinneret, which is below sea-level. Even the highest mountain in the region (Mt. Hermon) is only some 9000 ft. Therefore, once the waters got that high they should have stopped flowing.</p>\n\n<p>I understand we're dealing with miracles here, but this seems to be an unnecessary miracle (to force waters to flow when they normally wouldn't).

However, not attending or partaking of a wedding feast is not a <em>zilzul mitzvah</em>, (because <em>seudas\nnessuin</em> is <em>lkovod hachosson vkallah</em>, not <em>lkovod mitzva</em>) and therefore is not included in the curse.</p></li>\n<li><p>Alternatively, one could suggest the importance of a <em>seudas bris\nmilah</em> over other <em>seudos mitzva</em> based on the Shaarei Teshuva\n(551.15) who cites the <em>Ohr Neelam</em> that it is <em>doiraysa</em>, whereas\nother <em>seudos mitzvah</em> are only <em>drabbanan</em>.

In fact, in the 1950s Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik (Modern Orthodox) and other members of the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) engaged in negotiations with the leaders of Conservative Judaism’s Rabbinical Assembly, including Rabbi Saul Lieberman. Their goal was to create a joint Orthodox-Conservative national beth din for America. It would create communal standards of marriage and divorce. The hope was that it eventually could become a standard for all sorts of inter-denominational life cycle recognition.</p>\n\n<p>It was to be modeled after the Israeli Chief Rabbinate, where all the judges would have been Orthodox, while it would have been accepted by the larger Conservative movement as legitimate. Conservative rabbis in the Rabbinical Assembly worked created a Joint Conference on Jewish Law, devoting a year to this effort.</p>\n\n<p>According to Modern Orthodox Rabbi Bernstein, the major reason for its failure was the Orthodox rabbis insisted that the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly (RA) expel Conservative rabbis for actions they took before this new Beit Din was formed, and the RA refused to do so. (Bernstein, 1977) According to Orthodox Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, former president of the RCA, the major reason for its failure was pressure from right-wing Orthodox rabbis, who held that any cooperation between Orthodoxy and Conservatism was forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>In 1956, Rabbi Harry Halpen, of the Joint Conference wrote a report on the demise of this beit din. He writes that negotiations between the Orthodox and Conservative were completed and agreed upon, but then a new requirement was demanded by the RCA: The RA must “impose severe sanctions” upon Conservative rabbis for actions they took before this new Beit Din was formed. Halpern writes that the RA “could not assent to rigorously disciplining our members at the behest of an outside group.” He writes that although subsequent efforts were made to cooperate with the Orthodox, a letter from eleven Rosh Yeshivas was circulated declaring that Orthodox rabbis are forbidden to cooperate with Conservative rabbis. (Proceedings of the CJLS of the Conservative Movement 1927-1970 Vol. II, p.850-852.)</p>\n\n<p>The plan may have been doomed from the beginning, as some Orthodox leaders held that not a single Conservative rabbi was qualified to sit on such a joint beit din.

Ploni agrees with those\nopinions that a Jew is never allowed to gamble. Learning that modern\ncasino games are designed so that the odds favor the house, and the\ncasino is always ahead at the end of the day, he thinks this is a\ngreat business in which to invest, and he buys a casino. Does this\nmake him a gambler?</li>\n<li>If  the answer to #1 is no, assuming that his customers are all\ngentiles, is there any violation of halacha in facilitating the\ngambling of his customers?</li>\n<li>If the answer to #2 is no, then imagine a Jewish customers goes into\nthat casino and gambles. By allowing this, has the Jewish casino\nowner committed an aveira?</li>\n<li>On a tangentially related note: So far as I know, a Jew is permitted\nto drive benefit from non kosher food like pork (thought not bassar\nv' chalav). So could Ploni buy a pig abattoir, and start selling\npork products? If a Jew sinned by eating pork he bought from Ploni,\nhas Ploni committed an aveira?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There are discussions of whether it's permitted to walk into a casino and gamble, but the Gemara makes it clear (<a href=\"http://www.come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_24.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 24b</a>) that a person whose only job is getting people's money via gambling is \"not among those who help civilize this world\", and is disqualified from being a witness!</p>\n\n<p>So 1--3 would all be clearly prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the pork abattoir, the Gemara (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=23&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pesachim 23a</a>) says that because non-kosher animals are referred to as \"you shall treat them with disgust\", you should not go into the business of selling their meat. (A deer trapper who catches the occasional rabbit by mistake, however, is allowed to sell it.) As far as my responsibility enabling/facilitating a Jew's sin, that depends a great deal on the details of the case, often relating to how easily he can sin without me, and whether he knows it's a sin.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps your question is something like: \"may I sell non-Chalav Yisrael to Jews if they believe it's kosher and I don't\"?

I know that there are rules for the minimum number of <em>pesukim</em> for each <em>aliyah</em> but I am wondering who set up the exact placement of the <em>aliyah</em> divisions and when (for an annual reading cycle).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10789\">This</a> answer posits that the divisions had to do with setting up a learning cycle but that doesn't give any history or specific guidelines. One practical question which develops is, in the case of reading a double <em>parsha</em>, why isn't the seventh <em>aliyah</em> of the double identical with what would be the seventh <em>aliyah</em> of the second <em>parsha</em> when it is read on its own? The determination that it should be \"seventh\" was already made -- why change that when the 2 <em>parshiyot</em> are combined? (I note that for a variety of reasons, <em>aliyot</em> are not always balanced and even in terms of length so \"balance\" would not, on its own, appear to be a persuasive answer.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>In terms of the history of division of Aliyot, you should see Ilana Katzenellenbogen's survey article in <em>Sinai</em> 119 (1998), pp. 224-45. She looks at 33 different division customs from the last 1000 years from around the Jewish world and compiles a ~10 page chart with all the different variants from \"our common custom\" (OCC). Her conclusions are (summarized from p. 225-226):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The divisions in various biblical manuscripts are different from OCC and from each other.</p></li>\n<li><p>The divisions in various lists of customs are different from OCC and from each other, but the more recent they are the more they begin to resemble OCC.</p></li>\n<li><p>Her inspection of printed bibles revealed the following strata:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>From 1517 to 1568: 17 editions, none of which had any division markings.</li>\n<li>From 1574 to 1702: 22 editions, 13 of which had no division markings and 9 with divisions unlike OCC and unlike each other.</li>\n<li>From 1702 on: over 100 editions all of which are very similar to OCC (the few differences are found mostly in dividing Parshat Bereishit).</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>She posits from this that the divisions were originally 'regulated' by local Chazanim and Baalei Keriya usually in separate books of customs, and only in the last 300-400 years has there been a gradual fixation of the division (probably partially influenced by mass printing).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>While I'm here I'll note that in footnote 5 she collects the relevant Talmudic dicta about where one may make a division (not 1 or 2 verses before or after a parsha break, etc.) including one related to content (Yerushalmi Megilla 3:7):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זה שהוא עומד לקרות בתורה צריך שיהא פותח בדבר טוב וחותם בהדבר טוב<br>\n  He who comes up to read from the Torah needs to open with a good thing and close with a good thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Finally I note there were Achronim (notable among them the Vilna Gaon (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%91_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA#.D7.A7.D7.9C.D7.91\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maaseh Rav 132</a>)) who generally opposed respecting the printed division of OCC.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does one say a beracha on medication?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does one say a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berakhah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">beracha</a> on medication? Does it matter whether it tastes nice or not? Is there a difference between pills and liquid medicine?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>R’ Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe OC 1:82) writes that if the medication itself tastes nice, then one should recite a beracha. R’ Ephraim Greenblatt (Rivevos Ephraim 4:54:39) writes that R’ Yosef Shalom Elyashiv held that if one mixed the medicine into something that tastes good, one would need to recite a beracha on it.</p>\n<p>R’ Dr. Avraham Avraham (Nishmas Avraham 204:1) writes that R’ Yehoshua Neuwirth (Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa 40:n191) held that one doesn’t  recite a beracha upon taking medicine that has flavouring added to make it taste sweet since the main ingredient is bitter though R’ Ovadia Yosef (Yalkut Yosef 204:10:n10) held that one should recite a beracha. Similarly, R’ Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (quoted by R’ Dr. Avraham) held that one should recite a beracha on pills that are coated with sweeteners.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (OC 230:4) writes that one about to undergo a medical procedure should recite: יְהִי רָצוֹן מִלְּפָנֶיךָ ה' אֱלֹקַי שֶׁיִּהְיֶה לִי עֵסֶק זֶה לִרְפוּאָה כִּי רוֹפֵא חִנָּם אַתָּה, \"May it be your will, Hashem, that this procedure should cure me, for You are a Doctor who does not charge,\" and afterwards, בָּרוּךְ רוֹפֵא חוֹלִים, \"Blessed is the One who heals the ill\" (See Mishna Berura 230:6).</p>\n<p>R’ Dr. Avraham quotes R’ Eliezer Waldenberg who says that one should say these prayers before and after taking medication. This would serve in place of reciting a beracha, thus satisfying both views.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://doseofhalacha.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/beracha-on-medication.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dose of Halacha</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/59290/4794\">existing answer</a> provides a nice survey of final p'sak.  The following is the development from the sources:</p>\n<p>The Gemara <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=36&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachos 36a</a> has the following conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מהו דתימא כיון דלרפואה קא מכוין לא לבריך עליה כלל קמ\"ל כיון דאית ליה הנאה מיניה בעי ברוכי</p>\n<p>What might one have thought?  Since [the purpose of its comsumption] is intended for medicinal purposes, one would not make a blessing.  This teaches us that since he gets pleasure from it, he is required to bless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The context of the Gemara's discussion is a mixture of oil and some form of beet mixture, in which the oil is present to soothe the throat, and soothing the throat was the primary intention for drinking it.  However, due to the beet mixture, it was an enjoyable drink.</p>\n<p>Rashi explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאית ליה הנאה מיניה. לבד הרפואה יש לו הנאת אכילה</p>\n<p>He gets pleasure from it: Aside from the [pleasure of] healing, he has the pleasure of eating.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosefos says the same in s.v. כיון, and explicitly applies the principle to liquids.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch cites this principle in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1021\" rel=\"noreferrer\">O.C. 202:4</a>, that if one drank oil in a mixture, to soothe his throat, he would make a blessing on the oil.  The Magen Avrohom (204:8) generalizes the principal to all liquids and even to solids.</p>\n<p>When the medicine is in a mixture such that it tastes good, even though a blessing is made, the blessing is not necessarily on the medicine.  The Magen Avrohom (O.C. 202:10) holds that even if there is only a small amount of the medicinal substance, if the intent of consumption is for medicinal purposes then the blessing is made on the medicinal substance (and so the Mishna Berura (202:31) concludes), however he suggest according to the Rosh that there must at least be a substantial amount of it (or possibly even a majority - see Machazis Hashekel), even if it is the minority. The Elya Rabba concludes that there must be at least a significant amount.</p>\n<p>I heard from Rabbi Y. Frand that the implication of the suggestion of the Gemara that one would not recite any blessing when the intent of consumption is for medicinal purposes (as opposed to reciting a blessing on the non-medicinal portion) implies that that which is enjoyed, but is only present to facilitate the medicine, does not merit a blessing - either because it is secondary to the medicine, or because a taste which is only there to cover up another taste and not for the sake of its own taste is not considered a significant taste.  This would line up with the opinion of R' Neuwirth cited in the other answer.</p>\n\n\n",

He has untold numbers of individual victims who suffered shame and emotional distress due to his actions. He may well have been <em>machati eth harabim</em> (causing communal sin) by discouraging halachik <em>mikvah</em> use, which is one of the categories of sin for which one forfeits one's share in the world to come. This in addition to the huge <em>hillul hashem</em> (desecration of G-d's name) he created, which is never atoned for before death. See, e.g., <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1504.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maimonides' Yad Hachazaka The Laws of Repentance 4:1</a> and 4:3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עשרים וארבעה דברים מעכבין את התשובה.  ארבעה מהן עוון גדול; והעושה אחד מארבעתן--אין הקדוש ברוך הוא מספיק בידו לעשות תשובה, לפי גודל חטאו.  ואלו הן:  (א) המחטיא את הרבים; ובכלל עוון זה, המעכב את הרבים מלעשות מצוה</p>\n  \n  <p>Twent-four categories (of sin) prevent repentance.

This is found in Brachos 7a and Sanhedrin 27b. </p>\n\n<p>The explenation given כי עוון של דורות חמור יותר מעוון של פרט אחד does not appear there. In fact by reading the gemara in Sanhedrin and the psukim (especially Shmos 34 7) in context, the point is Hashem in his merciful kindness does not punish immediately but rather waits for repentance, up to the third and forth generation. If that does not happen, he will punish that generation, however all past misdeeds of the last generations which were hanging up in the air will come crashing down at long last.</p>\n\n<p>[Another point from the gemara there is that we are obviously discussing a situation where there was no possibility to reprimand the sinners. Anyone at any time can be punished for someone else's sins if they had the opportunity to reprimand them and did not.]</p>\n\n<p>See also Sanhedrin 39a where this pasuk is the basis for one of the only three extent parables out of three hundred fox  parables which Rav Meir had. See Rashi's explenation. Rav Hai Gaon had a different explenation that you might not have access to so I'll quote it in short.</p>\n\n<p>A fox tricked a lion into a trap when he told him he would not suffer for his attempt to eat a sleeping person, only his grandchildren would suffer.

Otherwise, perhaps the author meant to reference one of the sources mentioned in the comments (or Targum Onkelos where he explains e.g. the last of the 13 Middot).</p>\n\n\n",

Beis Shamai say: two males; Beis Hillel say: one male\n  and one female, as it says (Bereishis 5): He created them male and\n  female.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Several contemporary halachic issues are related to the mitzvah of\n  procreation, including such delicate topics as fertility treatments\n  (and the question of fatherhood), surrogacy, contraception, and the\n  general obligation to get married. We will leave these important\n  discussions for a future opportunity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given the mitzvah to have children, the mitzvah to marry follows since \"Kedoshim Tihyu\". One must be and act in a holy manner. Thus, having children outside of marriage would be forbidden. However, one could have children with a pilegesh (concubine). The talmud also points out that in normal circumstances, a person would not perform \"beilas znus\" and that relations between a man and a woman would be \"biah al mnas lekadeish\"</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, as it says at <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2011/01/is-marriage-a-mitzvah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Is Marriage A Mitzvah?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>RASHI explains that the Mitzvah which one fulfills by getting married\n  is the Mitzvah of Piryah v’Rivyah, having children. Other than the\n  Mitzvah of Piryah v’Rivyah, there is no inherent Mitzvah in the act of\n  getting married. This explains why the Gemara mentions that the case\n  of the Mishnah is not only where one already has a wife, but he\n  already has children as well.</p>\n  \n  <p>The RAMBAM (Hilchos Ishus 1:2) writes that marriage is a Mitzvas Aseh\n  [positive commandment]. The Rambam apparently maintains that every\n  time a man marries a woman he fulfills a Mitzvah. How does the Rambam\n  understand the Gemara here [Beitzah 36b] which says that one who is\n  already married and has children does not fulfill a Mitzvah by getting\n  married?</p>\n  \n  <p>Apparently, since it is uncommon for a woman to agree to become a\n  man’s Pilegesh (since she has no guarantee that the man will take care\n  of her and her children, as she receives no Kesuvah and there is no\n  Kidushin), the Gemara considers Kidushin a Mitzvah because in practice\n  one is unlikely to fulfill Piryah v’Rivyah by taking a Pilegesh. He\n  has no choice but to get married with Kidushin.</p>\n  \n  <p>Alternatively, perhaps the Rambam does not mean that it is a Mitzvas\n  Aseh per se to marry a wife with Kidushin. Rather, he means that it is\n  an Isur Aseh (a prohibition that results from a positive commandment)\n  to take a woman without Kidushin. (The Rambam rules that taking a\n  Pilegesh is prohibited; see Hilchos Melachim 4:4.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this then, the mitzva of pru u'rvu requires kiddushin (and nisuin) in order to be fulfilled properly.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, while one isn’t allowed to adjust the timer to switch on or off earlier than planned, one may adjust the timer to prevent or delay the timer from switching the appliance off by pulling pins out (Minchas Shlomo 1:11:8; 1:13). Likewise, one may adjust the timer to prevent or delay an appliance that is off from coming on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

These images are generally placed on top of the ark containing the Torah Scrolls and/or on the curtain covering the ark. In many renditions of the Tablets, they shaped as regular rectangles or squares, but in most renderings, they are rounded on top. In recent times, several Rabbinic figures have expressed their opinions regarding this matter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Tablets’ Dimensions</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Babylonian Talmud records the dimensions of the Tablets as six handbreadths long, six handbreadths wide, and three handbreadths thick. The Jerusalemic Talmud offers a similar description, noting that the Tablets were three handbreadths wide. All in all, both Talmuds seem to agree that the Tablets were square prisms because they note the Tablets’ dimensions in a linear way, without specifying that the Tablets were rounded. \nFurthermore, in the ensuing discussion in the Babylonian Talmud, the Talmud proves from the Tablets’ dimensions and the dimensions of the Holy Ark that when the Tablets were placed in their ark, the ark was completely filled exactly to capacity. Since the Holy Ark was a cube prism, the Talmud calculations can only work if the Tablets were also squared. If the rounding was done within the square dimensions of the Tablets, then there would be slightly more room in the Ark, while if the rounding was done outside of the square dimensions of the Tablets, then the Tablets would be too big to fit into the Ark.</p>\n\n<p>While the Talmud stops short of explicitly mentioning that the Tablets were squared, Rabbeinu Bachaya (1255–1340) does so in his commentary to the Torah. The Torah tells that at Marah, HaShem “offered [the Jews] a decree (chok) and ordinance (mishpat)”. Rabbeinu Bachaya explains that “decree” in this context alludes to the Tablets. He justifies this association by noting that according to the dimensions of each squared Tablets given in the Talmud, the volume of each Tablet equals one-hundred and eight cubic-handbreadths (6x6x3 = 108).

He seemingly arrived to this conclusion the same way as Rabbeinu Bachaya (only doubling the formula to calculate both Tablets together). In short, by calculating the volume of the Tablets as simply a function of its length, width, and thickness, these sources clearly understood that the Tablets were perfectly squared, which, in fact, Rabbeinu Bachaya wrote explicitly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rejecting the Notion of Rounded Tablets</strong></p>\n\n<p>In two responsa about this topic, Rabbi Eliyahu Katz (1916–2004), Chief Rabbi of Slovakia and later of Beer Sheva, writes that the Tablets given at Mount Sinai were definitely squared, not rounded. He notes that it seems Christian artists like Michaelangelo (1475–1564) and Rembrandt (1609–1669) were the first to introduce the notion of rounded Tablets and their widespread portrayals of the Tablets in such a permeated Jewish culture, even though it contradicts tradition.\nNonetheless, since it has become a widespread practice even in Jewish circles to portray the Tablets as having a rounded top, Rabbi Katz proposes an interesting theory to justify its prevalence by ascribing a more “Jewish” origin to the practice. He notes that in certain ancient Tunisian synagogues, there are images of the Tablets with three crowns atop them. These crowns ostensibly represent the three crowns which adorn the Jews: the Crown of Torah, the Crown of Priesthood, and the Crown of Kingship. While earlier images of the Tablets were supplemented with these three crowns, over time, the meaning of these three crowns was forgotten and people began to assume that the Tablets themselves were rounded on top. Based on this explanation, Rabbi Katz proposes that the old Tunisian custom should be restored with three crowns on top of the Tablets and a line of demarcation to separate the crowns from the Tablets so that the observer would realize that the Tablets themselves were not round.\nFollowing Rabbi Katz's suggestion, MK Yaakov Margi (Shas), who formerly served as the chairman of the local religious council in Beer Sheva, changed his council's official logo from a rounded depiction of the Tablets to a squared one.\nSimilarly, the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902–1994), spoke strongly against those who depict the Tablets as rounded on top and actively campaigned for an accurate portrayal of the Tablets. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Justifying the Common Practice of Rounded Tablets</strong></p>\n\n<p>In one of his responsa, Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher (1928–2003), Chief Rabbi of Badatz Eidah Chareidis in Jerusalem, defends an author who came under attack for including in his book an image of the Tablets as rounded. He writes that the Talmud never mentions whether the Tablets were squared or rounded and there is no clear proof to either approach (however, see above). Furthermore, he expresses his bewilderment as to why that author’s book came under attack, but no one ever complained about the multitude of synagogues across Jerusalem which portray the Tablets as being rounded. Instead, Rabbi Fisher proposes that there is justification for portraying the Tablets as round and the custom should not be discontinued.</p>\n\n<p>He begins by offering an interesting proof to the assertion that the Tablets were in fact rounded, not squared. The Jerusalemic Talmud in several places states that when HaShem created the world during the Six Days of Creation, squares did not naturally occur, implying that everything created then was circular, not squared. Additionally, the Mishnah teaches that the Tablets were created during the Six Days of Creation. By putting together these two sources, Dayan Fisher concludes that according to tradition the Tablets were completely rounded (even the bottom!), not squared.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Katz rejects this proof by noting that the Talmud itself qualifies its assertion about squares in nature by restricting it to living creatures (and perhaps also foods), but not all elements of creation. Furthermore, he notes that the same Mishnah teaches that HaShem created the script of Lashon HaKodesh during the Six Days of Creation, yet the script of Lashon HaKodesh surely contains squared figures such as the final mem (ם). </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Dayan Fisher argues that even if the Tablets were actually square, there is another reason to continue the custom of rounding the Tablets. The Talmud mentions a prohibition of constructing replicas of the Holy Temple and its paraphernalia. While some commentators restrict this prohibition to only those elements listed there in the Talmud (namely the Sanctuary, the Hall, the Courtyard, the Shulchan, and the Menorah), others, including the Galician Rabbi Yosef Babad (1801–1874) understand that this prohibition applies to anything for which the Torah prescribes certain dimensions. Dayan Fisher understood that the Tablets are therefore included in this prohibition (and explains that even though the Torah does not mention its dimensions, the Talmud does). Accordingly, he supports the custom of rounding images of the Tablets so that the distorted image would not fall under this prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, Rabbi Katz disagrees with Dayan Fisher’s assessment of the matter and contends that only what is mentioned in the Talmud is forbidden to be replicated, thus excluding the Tablets, which are omitted from the Talmud’s list. Furthermore, argues Rabbi Katz, this prohibition only applies to one who constructs these elements in their prescribed dimensions, but replicas of the Tablets do not generally match the dimensions of the Talmud. Even if one was particular to construct the Tablets at six handbreadths wide and long, they do not usually also make sure to have the Tablets three handbreadths thick. Since this change already removes the prohibition of replication, there is no need to further distort the image of the Tablets by rounding off the tops. </p>\n\n<p>In his final note on the topic, Dayan Fisher notes that since it is unclear whether the Tablets were squared or rounded, the custom is to square the bottom and to round the top, thereby surely altering the image from the original so as to completely avoid the prohibition of replicating components of the Temple.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Elazar Menachem Man Shach (1899–2001), Rosh Yeshiva of Ponovezh and leader of World Jewry in his time, was once asked by the board of a synagogue which was designing its building whether they should make the Tablets rounded or squared. He responded by writing that he sees that most synagogues have the Tablets rounded, even though in truth, the historic Tablets were squared. He concludes that while it seems that the accepted custom is to round the Tablets, the Steipler Gaon, Rabbi Yaakov Yisroel Kanievsky (1899–1985) instructed that the Kollel Chazon Ish should have squared Tablets. In his conclusion, Rabbi Shach defers to Rabbi Kanievsky’s position and recommends that the synagogue have squared Tablets, not rounded ones.</p>\n\n<p>King Solomon advises about the Torah and Mitzvos, “write them on the tablets of your heart” (Proverbs 7:2). Based on this, Radaz, Rabbi David ben Zimra (1462–1572) explains that the Tablets of the Ten Commandments represent the heart of a person in many different ways. Just as the word of HaShem is eternally inscribed on the Tablets, so should a person eternally inscribe in his heart the will of Hashem. Following this line of reasoning, Rabbi Chaim Friedlander (1923–1986), the Mashgiach of Ponovezh, explains that for this reason the Tablets are traditionally rendered as rounded on the top , i.e., “heart-shaped”. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachye does indeed <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/rabenobehayey/rabenobehayey08.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">write</a> that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודע, כי הלוחות היו מרובעות ששה טפחים באורך וששה טפחים ברוחב, וכן דרשו רז\"ל בבא בתרא פרק השותפין... ואם תשכיל עוד במידת הלוחות בין אורך ורוחב ובעובי, תמצא כי היה בכל לוח ולוח ק\"ח טפחים - </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>English translation by sabbahillel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And know that the luchos were squared six tefachim in length and six\n  tefachim in width and this is why the sages (a blessing on their\n  memory) explained it in Baba Basra, Chapter \"Hashutafin\".

I do not how this is done. However Hashem always accepts sincere Teshuva which includes not doing it again, regretting the sin, confessing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>The same tikkun as any other pre-marital or extra marital sex. Sleeping with a gentile is not a biblical prohibition, it's a rabbinic one.</p>\n\n<p>Because if the following interpretation of the verse is true:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Deut. 7:3): \"You shall not marry them (the gentiles, about which the\n  Bible speaks in the previous verses), you shall not give your daughter\n  to their son and you shall not take his daughter for your son.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>then this verse means to not marry any gentile, but this also means that you are obligated to kill every gentile you meet. Why? Because the previous verse says the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Deut 7:2): \" and when the LORD thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shalt smite them; then thou shalt utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them;\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You cannot cut this verse both ways. You can't say it's talking about inter-marrying with any and all gentiles, and then switch and say the commandment to kill these same gentiles doesn't apply in the same way. The only way to interpret this with any kind of sense is to take it in the proper context, which would be Deut 7:1</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Deut 7:1): \"When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You are not allowed to intermarry with the specific 7 Canaanite nations. So if by the off chance you happened to sleep with a Jebusite then yeah that would be a pretty grievous sin, almost as grievous as not murdering her [sarcasm].</p>\n\n\n",

Whoever accepts upon himself, in front of three friends, not to worship idolatry — these are the words of Rabbi Me'ir. And the rabbis say: Whoever accepts upon himself the seven sins which the sons of Noach accepted upon themselves. And others (i.e. Elisha Acher) say: None of these are a \"ger toshav.\" A \"ger toshav\" is whoever accepts upon himself all the commandments except not to eat neveilah.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (Isurei Biah 14:7) rules like the rabbis. This definition of a \"ger toshav\" is what we are regular to call a \"ben Noach.\" So according to the halachah, there is no difference between a ger toshav and a ben Noach, but according to the other opinions in the gemara there is. The Rambam there says that he's called a \"ger toshav\" (lit. resident stranger) because he's allowed to live in Israel with us.</p>\n\n<p>They are allowed to eat the dead animal carcass.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Think of Israel as the equivalent of the USA, and think of Judaism not as a religion, but as a Legal System, and thus as the equivalent of US Law. Now the categories are equivalent as such:</p>\n\n<p>1) Natural-born Jew = Natural-born US Citizen. They have all the rights and obligations of a US citizen, including voting, and may pursue the US Presidency. In extreme circumstances (i.e. acts of treason for which they have been found guilty by the judicial system), they are subject to punishment of anything from imprisonment up to and including state or federal capital punishment, but they cannot be stripped of their US Citizenship.</p>\n\n<p>2) Ger Tzedek (lit. \"Righteous Covert\") Jew = Naturalized US Citizen. They have all the rights and obligations of a US citizen, including voting, but subject to the restriction of pursuing the US Presidency. In extreme circumstances (i.e. acts of treason for which they have been found guilty by the judicial system), they are subject to punishment of anything from imprisonment up to and including state or federal capital punishment, but they can also be stripped of their US Citizenship (and thus deported). </p>\n\n<p>3) Ger Toshav (lit. \"Resident Alien\") = Green Card holders. These are Foreign nationals who are not US Citizen but are Legal US Permanent Residents holding a valid US Permanent Resident Visa. This grants them a right to legal permanent residency in the USA. They have all the obligations of a US citizen (i.e. pay tax, follow the law, etc...) but they do not have all right, though they do have most rights. They have the right to reside permanently, right to work, etc... The main rights they are excluded from are the right to vote and the right to pursue the US Presidency. In the most extreme of cases, they cannot be regarded as having committed treason against the USA since they are non citizens, however, for acts which would be treasonous if they had been a US citizen (for which they have been found guilty by the judicial system), they are still subject to punishment of anything from imprisonment up to and including state or federal capital punishment, but they can also be stripped of their Permanent Residency (and thus deported). </p>\n\n<p>4) Goyim (lit. \"Nations\") = Any and all Foreigners who is neither a Natural-born US citizen, nor a Naturalized US Citizen, nor a Green Card holder. This class of people includes Foreign Tourists on Visa Waivers, Foreign Tourists on Tourist Visas, Foreign Business people on Visa Waivers, Foreign Business people of Business Visas, International Student on Student Visas, and all other people on other visa types etc... It also includes Assylum Seekers awaiting Refugee Visas, Refugees on Refugee Visas, and finally people residing illegally in the USA without any visa or permit. This entire class of people termed \"foreigners\" have only non-privileged basic rights while in the USA. Those who are in the USA illegally without any visa or permit have even less rights than the basic rights, since they are in the USA illegally. Whatever the case, all foreigners in the USA, whether they are in the country with or without the appropriate visas or permits, have no right to work (unless on a current working visa), no right of residence (beyond the time granted in their visa), no right to welfare, no right to vote, no right to seek the presidency. These lack of rights comes with the benefit of having no real obligations to the USA other than ensuring they don't break the law as visitors that they are. They don't have to pay tax (because they shouldn't be working, unless they're on a working visa, in which case they pay tax but at a higher rate). Good and services tax can be avoided by them if they are travelling (\"duty free\" purchases). If they break any US laws during their visit, however, they may be deported, and the laws they break need not be the extreme of cases. They can also simply be refused entry into the USA.</p>\n\n<p>The different categories of status in Jewish law of people inside Israel also imposes different rights and obligations depending on the category one falls into. Including who can eat a carcass (Ger Toshav and Goyim), who keeps Shabbat (natural born Jews and Ger Tzedek Jews), who can marrying a Kohen (only a natural born Jew can marry a Kohen, though if you were born to a Ger Tzedek Jewish woman after she converted, then you yourself are a natural born Jew, and you can marry a Kohen), etc...</p>\n\n\n",

In this point I find no discrepancy with what the Rabbi is saying. It's this next point which I'm having trouble with.</p>\n<p>This Rabbi also goes on to say that the Rebbe fits into the category of the definite Mashiach, as outlined by the Rambam. \"He builds the Temple in its place\" -- this refers to 770 (\"in its place\" need not refer to Jerusalem, but rather to \"the Mashiach\"'s place, explains the Rabbi). \"He gathers the dispersed of Israel\" -- this refers to when the Rebbe exported a large number of Jews from the Soviet Union into the land of Israel. The Rabbi explained this all to me.</p>\n<p>Why I'm having a problem with this is the Rambam's <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e511.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">next clause</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ט:</strong>  ואם לא הצליח עד כה, או נהרג--בידוע שאינו זה שהבטיחה עליו תורה, והרי הוא ככל מלכי בית דויד השלמים הכשרים שמתו.  ולא העמידו הקדוש ברוך הוא אלא לנסות בו רבים, שנאמר \"ווּמִן הַמַּשְׂכִּילִים יִכָּשְׁלוּ לִצְרוֹף בָּהֶם וּלְבָרֵר וְלַלְבֵּן עַד עֵת קֵץ כִּי עוֹד לַמּוֹעֵד\" (ראה <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00794.html#HtmpReportNum0010_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">דניאל יא</a>,לה).‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"If he did not succeed to this degree or was killed, he surely is not the redeemer promised by the Torah. Rather, he should be considered as all the other proper and complete kings of the Davidic dynasty who died.\"</p>\n<p>The Rebbe is no longer alive. This appears to contradict what the Rambam stated just above. However, the Rabbi explains to me that Rambam only specifies \"...or was killed,\" whereas the Rebbe died of natural means (actually, he never directly said that the Rebbe died). Furthermore, Rambam then says he is to \"...be considered as all the other proper and complete kings... WHO DIED\". To be, this seems to clearly imply that the Rambam isn't simply referring to the Mashiach as someone who wasn't killed, but to someone who hasn't yet died.</p>\n<p>All this is one way to look at the Rambam's words, but to me it seems very clear that the Rambam is referring to someone who actually builds the third Beis Hamikdash in Jerusalem, gathers the people of Israel from all over the Earth, and to someone who is actually alive!</p>\n<p>How can this belief that the Rebbe is / has the potential to be Mashiach at all be properly justified, considering the clear words of the Rambam? (No offense intended, I just want to know).</p>\n<p>EDIT</p>\n<p>All of your answers are great, but the best is the one I heard from my real-life Rabbi, \"Let moshiach come and we'll find out!\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 41)\n\n<p>I'm going to answer this question indirectly. I have had discussions with several Lubavitchers who have come up with some compelling (to them) reasoning how the Rebbe זצ\"ל <em>can</em> be Moshiach, which leads inexorably to the conclusion that he <em>must</em> be Moshiach. I'm not going to attempt to express the arguments here, even though you have asked for them, because I personally am unconvinced by them (to say the least) and will therefore not be able to make a good case to answer your question directly.</p>\n\n<p>But I will make the point that when the Rebbe was on his death bed, there was not a <em>single</em> Lubavitcher (that I know of) who brought any of these rationales to explain that even if the Rebbe would die, he would still be the Moshiach. As one <em>meshichist</em> said to me at the time, \"Just as it is clear to me that the sun will rise tomorrow, so it is clear to me that the Rebbe will not die - and you will see he is Moshiach!\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, all these arguments \"proving\" that Moshiach could be someone who has already died were all formulated only <em>after</em> they became necessary. They are all post-rationalizations. To my mind, this in itself makes the arguments specious; it has all the markings of a massive case of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance\" rel=\"noreferrer\">cognitive dissonance</a>, where the pain involved in admitting that they were wrong was so great that the <em>meshichistim</em> had to come up with some kind of explanation that allowed them to hang on to their previously held beliefs. To be clear: cognitive dissonance is not a mental disorder; it's something that affects <em>every single human being on the planet</em>. So it shouldn't be surprising that normal, healthy people should react in this way to an occurrence that seems to challenge a deeply held belief.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize my answer: you asked, \"How can this belief... be properly justified\" - and my answer is: <strong>There is no limit to the acrobatics that the intellect can perform when driven by cognitive dissonance.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>See Gil Students tremendous treatment entitled \"<a href=\"http://moshiachtalk.tripod.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Can The Rebbe Be Moshiach?</a>\"</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://moshiachtalk.tripod.com/moshiach_chap5.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter Five</a> called What Counter-proofs can be\nBrought? Rabbi Student brings the arguments that many meshichist lubavitchers use to argue that the Lubavitcher rebbe was/is/will be Moshiach.\nFrom the beginning of the chapter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are two types of proofs that are brought for the claim  that a\ndead person can be Moshiach. The first type is  passages from primary\nsources and the second is  commentary on these sources. The former\ntries to  demonstrate that Chazal considered it possible, or maybe\neven likely, that a resurrected figure can serve as Moshiach.  The\nlatter attempts to show that regardless of what we think  the primary\nsource actually says, there were commentators  who may have thought\ndifferently. This distinction is  important because it highlights that\nthe value in a  commentary’s statement rests totally on the weight of\nwho  the commentator is and not on what text the author is\nexplaining. For example, if a relatively unknown twentieth  century\nrabbi wrote a commentary on the Talmud  Yerushalmi in which he says\nthat Moshiach can come from  the dead, we can only conclude from this\nthat this obscure modern commentator thought the idea was possible. We\ncannot deduce any more than that. This clarity in the relative  value\nof proofs is crucial in making a final evaluation of the  evidence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The texts that are generally brought revolve around  statements that\neither Daniel, King David, or Moshe will be  the future Moshiach.\nSince these righteous men are  deceased we can infer that there is\nnothing in Judaism that  contradicts the idea that Moshiach can come\nfrom the dead.  Since, as we proved in the previous chapter, Moshiach\ncannot come from the dead, the burden is on us to explain  these\napparently explicit statements to the contrary. As we  shall see, this\nhas already been done by those much greater  than we.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>in chapter four he discusses the Rambam quoted by the OP:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He initiated an unparalleled tshuvah movement that  brought many, many\nJews back to observance. He fought the  spiritual battles of G-d\nagainst assimilation and secularism  by sending out mitzvah tanks and\narmies of youths. Thus,  these people conclude, he is at least\nbechezkas Moshiach.  Some will even claim that he accomplished 4 and\n5. He built  a monumental holy place – 770 – in his place and helped  bring about the mass immigration of Russian Jews to Israel.  Thus,\nthese people argue, the Rebbe is not only bechezkas  Moshiach, he is\nvadai Moshiach.</p>\n<p>Yet, there are problems with this theory. First of all, none of  these\ntasks are done. The Rebbe did not fully succeed in any  of these.\nThere is still monumental ignorance and lack of  observance among Jews\nthroughout the world and Israel is  still under siege by terrorists\nand Arab armies. The Temple  Mount remains under Arab control and the\nmajority of Jews  still reside outside of Israel. The Rebbe's\naccomplishments  were glorious and awe-inspiring. However, they were\nnot  sufficient to fit the Rambam's criteria for Moshiach. In fact,\nthe Rebbe has not fulfilled any of the criteria for being  Moshiach\nexcept being a Torah scholar and religious man.  Let us look at the\ncriteria again:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Compel all of Israel to walk in the way of Torah</li>\n<li>Repair the breaches in observance</li>\n<li>Fight the wars of G-d</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Furthermore, it is a basic rule of learning that the Rambam  was very\nprecise with his language. <strong>As many will argue  regarding the\ndifference between “to die” and “to be killed”,  we must read each of\nthe Rambam’s words with great care.</strong>  The Rambam writes that in order\nto be bechezkas Moshiach  one must be a king from the house of David.\nOnly by a wild  stretch of the imagination – and a careless reading of\nthe  Rambam – can the Rebbe be considered to have been a king.\nContrast this with Bar Kochba for whom there is  archaeological\nevidence that he ruled as a king and was  punctilious in his\nobservance of mitzvos. The Rambam also  says that one who is bechezkas\nMoshiach will fight the wars  of G-d. In which battle did the Rebbe\nfight in the army? In  fact, the Rebbe wrote in Likkutei Sichos vol.\n16 pp. 304-305  n. 49 that the Rambam’s language here of “fight the\nwars of  G-d” means literal wars including the destruction of Amalek.</p>\n<p>It is not merely a figure of speech. But the Rebbe did not  fight a war\nand did not destroy Amalek. The Rambam's definition of a failed\nMoshiach is quoted  above from halachah 5. Note that the Rambam says\n“did not  succeed… or was killed” so someone's not succeeding in\ncompleting the messianic task is sufficient to disqualify him  from\nbeing Moshiach. But how can the Rambam list not  accomplishing these\nfive items as rendering someone  definitely not Moshiach? Maybe he\nwill be resurrected and  finish these tasks? Or maybe he will complete\nthem in his  trips to this world from under the Seat of Glory? No one\ncan  ever fall into this category if the Moshiach can come back  from\nthe dead and finish his messianic tasks. We must say  that, according\nto the Rambam, Moshiach cannot come back  from the dead to complete\nthe criteria. Otherwise, half of this  halachah is impossible. We\nwould never be able to declare  someone who is bechezkas Moshiach as\nbeing definitely not  the promised Moshiach for not succeeding. If we\nallow for  the possibility that someone can come back to this world\nand  finish these tasks, then we have nullified the Rambam's  words in\nthis halacha. Rather, when someone who is  bechezkas Moshiach dies we\nunfortunately discover for  certain that he is not Moshiach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the first link above for more on this topic.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Just for redundancy's sake, I'm included here a citation from <a href=\"http://www.tsel.org/torah/midrashraba/vayechi.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">מדרש רבה on ויחי</a> that clearly shows that a messianic candidate is disqualified by death:</p>\n<p>ויפול רוכבו אחור יחזרו דברים לאחוריהם לפי שהיה יעקב אבינו רואה אותו וסבור בו שהוא מלך המשיח כיון שראה אותו <strong>שמת</strong> אמר אף זה מת לישועתך קויתי ה</p>\n<p>See Menachem Kasher's תורה שלימה for parallel midrashim.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does a cape need tzitzit?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone wears a garment with four corners, it needs tzitzit. Now, a cape pretty clearly has four corners. However, it's not clear to me whether or not \"wearing\" it follows the halachic definition of wearing. A cape is (generally) worn by tying two of the corners around your neck, and letting the rest hang behind you. You know, Superman style.  In this manner, it doesn't provide any protection or cover you up at all. In fact, the only thing it seems to be good for is for looking cool while flying through the air.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>EDIT: <em>My initial reading of the shulchan aruch was wrong.

Sinai to hear the Ten Commandments. The 10 Commandments is not the entire Torah as we have it (I.e. - all 5 Books). 40 days later, Moses was given just the 2 tablets - also, not the entire Torah.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the entire Torah in the form that we have it must have occurred close the day of Moses's death, as the last story mentions his death. I am aware of various opinions that discuss who wrote it - whether it was Moses himself or Joshua. But, as I understand it, it was written close to Moses death, either way. It doesn't seem sensible that Moses would have written about his death 40 years in advance while still at Mt. Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>So, does the phrase \"receiving the Torah\" when referring to Shavuot refer to some other definition of \"Torah\"? What do we mean? What was actually \"given\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Ramchal in Da'as Tevunos siman 158 s.v. ומה שיש לנו לדעת (p. 170 in Friedlander edition) explains that the the spiritual <em>ability</em> to keep the Torah is what was given to the Jewish people at Har Sinai.  In the following paragraph, ותראי, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותראי כי זה מה שעשה האדון ב\"ה לישראל בהר סיני, שהנה לא נתן להם שם התורה כולה במעמד ההוא, אבל הייתה הכנה כוללת לכל עבודת המצוות... ואז נתן להם תחילה הכוח לשמור כל מצוותיו, ושמעשיהם בעבודתו יעשו הפרי הטוב המצטרך לתיקון הבריאה</p>\n<p>And see, that this is what Hashem did for Yisroel at Har Sinai, as behold He did not give them the entire Torah there in that encounter, but it was the general preparation for the entire <em>avodah</em> of <em>mitzvos</em>... and then He gave them first the ability to keep all the <em>mitzvos</em>, and that their actions in His <em>avodah</em> would have positive effects to repair all of creation...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In footnote [46], R' Chaim Friedlander comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לכן אנו מחיסים את קבלת התורה למעמד הר סיני, אף אל פי שרק חלק מן המצוות ניתן בהר סיני וכו</p>\n<p>And therefore we associate receiving the Torah with the standing at Har Sinai, even though only a fraction of the <em>mitzvos</em> were given at Har Sinai...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the <em>ability</em> to keep Torah, and the spiritual connection to the <em>mitzvos</em> which causes our actions to have cosmic effect, were the \"giving of the Torah\" that are referred to.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Beis HaLevi in Parshas Yisro writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכמו שאמרו בבבא מציעא (נט, א) ״לא בשמים\n   היא״, רק היא כמו שמסכימים ב״ד שבזה העולם, וכו'. <strong>וזהו שאומרים ״מתן\n   תורתנו״, ולא ״מתן תורה״, דתורתנו הפירוש שנעשית שלנו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shavuos is called the time of Matan Tora<em>seinu</em> - the giving of <em>our Torah</em>, as it is the time when the Torah became ours, and the principle of לא בשמים היא, the Torah is not in Heaven, took effect, giving us jurisdiction over the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>So the idea of it being the \"giving\" of the Torah is not the transmission of the content of the Torah, but rather the transfer of <em>ownership</em> of the Torah - the Torah became <em>ours</em> on Shavuos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I think the end of the question is key. What we call <em>the giving of the Torah</em> is really a code word for us having an ability for a direct relationship with Hashem, in a new reality which fosters us to understand Him better, in a more open way.</p>\n\n<p>This way, R' Moshe Shapiro in Thursday night shiur, often cites kabbalistic seforim that the 10 Commandments correspond to the 10 Pronouncements with which the world was created (as it states in a <em>mishna</em> in <em>Avos</em>). The correspondence is that each fundamentally established a reality, and we exist in that 2nd reality, created by the 10 Commandments.</p>\n\n<p>Shavuos is the beginning of our relationship to Hashem finally reaching the level of direct interaction of the highest level, where the entire nation experienced a simultaneous prophetic revelation. This is what we are celebrating, referring to the G-d's Plan of Creation as the Torah, and our ability to comprehend it as the time of it's giving.</p>\n\n\n",

If it's purely metaphorical, how literally can we take the Baal HaTurim's statement above? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Baal aTurim means the Jews saw the spiritual order, making up the spiritual worlds. As a result, they wanted to instill the order they saw above in their own world below, to reflect the higher order of the organization they saw the angels subject to.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the Throne of Glory is a purely metaphysical concept, but it has physical implications. One of the reasons, for example, why we sit during <em>birchos shma</em> in <em>shacharis</em> is that they are reflective of this world, where the Throne manifests itself, and since you use the throne by sitting, we usually indicate this by sitting through the relevant section of the prayers.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It is not physical but nor is it allegorical. It is very real. It even has something called 'legs', four of them. Being that it is not physical it obviously can't have physical legs or sides, but it does have legs. What a physical leg is to a physical object, meta-physical legs are to a meta-physical being. The legs are its support.</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, the physical world is modeled after the more basic, meta-physical world. The dimensions of length, width, and depth are born from the deeper, more essential concepts of emanation, expansion and connection.</p>\n\n<p>Hashem created the world in the order of a kingdom. He created many levels and aspects. These are the foundation of the universe as an autonomous existence. The Throne is the highest level of creation's perception of Hashem. Below that there is already plurality. That plurality is the carrier or the first and highest level in term of beings accepting the presence of Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>That is what the Jews asked for and that is what they got by surrounding the holy sanctuary in four camps. It was clearly and visibly an encampment centered on the Mishkan, rather than the Mishkan merely being there.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Halacha a system of Civil Law or Common Law?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I often see halacha paskened differently between rabbis. Sometimes, a rabbi will cite a rabbinic opinion made by an aharon and other times a rabbi will cite the Talmud, Shulchan Aruch, or Mishneh Torah, or some other legal compilation, to come to a decision.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is this: Methodologically speaking, is halacha decided through a civil law system, where law is decided through codified statues, or is it a common law system, where law is derived from halachic opinions decided from poskim? Is it both? Does halacha favor one process more than the other? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Marylin Raisch, who's credentials include an expertise in Civil and Common Law, <a href=\"http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Religious_Legal_Systems.htm#_Jewish_Law\" rel=\"nofollow\">opines</a> about Jewish Law:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is no appeal or stare decisis; one can ask the court to correct an erroneous judgment or re-open a criminal case. The tradition is much closer to that of the European civil law in that regard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the Wikipedia entry you linked in the comments, stare decisis - the legal doctrine that previous rulings are binding on future judges - is a fundamental pillar of the rationale behind common law, in that it is regarded as unfair that two people with the same relevant facts get a different result.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, the idea that Halacha has no stare decisis is overstating it, as at a certain point previous rulings do become authoritative for precedential reasons. For example, the Talmud Bavli is the final word in the Halachic disputes that precede it, and so forth. However, that mechanism has to do with its acceptance and the inability to reverse that acceptance rather than a philosophical commitment that two people receive the same result.</p>\n\n<p>And although there is no appeals court in the method of English Common Law, there were layers of authoritative courts in the times of the Beis HaMikdash, as seen by the description of a Zaken Mamrei in Sanhedrin, where he would go through layers of appeals before getting the final ruling from the Sanhedrin that sat in the Temple.</p>\n\n<p>So in the end, it seems that Halacha is its own thing, with characteristics which have similarities to Civil Law, and others which have similarities to Common Law. One aspect of Common Law that Halacha definitely doesn't have is <em>dicta</em> - the idea that an opinion expressed in a decision that doesn't have a bearing on the direct case being decided is non-binding.</p>\n\n\n",

Had they waited, the decision to refrain would have been their own free will decision and would have become part of creation. Then, once creation was complete, they could have eaten the \"ripe\" fruit, digested it and made it part of their lives as an integrated whole.</p>\n\n<p>It was the premature eating that \"spoiled\" creation and set us on the difficult path of trying to reach our potential.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nishma.org/articles/journal/tree3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">For example</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This was the dilemma that Adam and Chava faced and of which the snake\n  took advantage. The commentators are bothered about how it was\n  possible for Adam and Chava to have transgressed G-d's word if they\n  were lacking ra and free choice. They were rational, needing only to\n  determine truth and falsehood - yet at the Tree they met their\n  Waterloo, the paradox of their very existence. One part of their\n  essence declared they were subjects of G-d, to follow His Will. One\n  part of their essence, created by G-d, was that they were to be like\n  G-d, determining their own will. It was His Will that they make their\n  own decisions yet it was also His Will that they follow the decisions\n  of G-d. And nowhere was this paradox more confusing then at the Tree,\n  where G-d was telling these beings, created to make decisions, not to\n  develop their ability to make decisions.</p>\n  \n  <p>Adam and Chava knew that their state before the Tree was unacceptable,\n  not their final destiny. How, though, do they solve the paradox, unite\n  the decision-making of their wills with the decision-making of The\n  Will of G-d? It was in how they responded to the Tree that they would\n  find their answer, yet, on the surface, it was only a continuation of\n  the dilemma. To not eat would mean to follow Hashem, but where was\n  their own will? What about their own decision? To eat would mean to\n  follow themselves, but where was The Will of G-d? What about His\n  decision? What to do? How to answer the paradox, solve the riddle and\n  reach the essence beyond?</p>\n  \n  <p>The essence of Adam before the Tree had to change and, in truth,\n  either decision was a path to the new level of man. If Adam and Chava\n  would have followed the word of G-d, they would have achieved olam\n  habah immediately. Their decision to follow G-d would have provided a\n  point of integration[23]. They chose, however, the other way[24].</p>\n  \n  <p>It was not that Adam and Chava benefitted from their transgression. It\n  was not that G-d held back this special knowledge of tov and ra. The\n  situation as it was, was not permanent. On this sixth day of creation,\n  Adam and Chava would act, either in refraining from the Tree or\n  partaking, thereby culminating the creation specifically of the moral\n  universe. Whatever act was chosen would catapult man into the path\n  whereby s/he would complete him/herself. This was part of creation.\n  This path chosen would introduce the qualities necessary for the\n  needed growth. Adam and Chava, perhaps unfortunately[25], chose the\n  more difficult path.</p>\n  \n  <p>[22]See also Rabbi J.B. Soloveitchik's \"Lonely Man of Faith\",\n  Tradition 7:2 for a different approach to this dichotomy of man. I\n  believe that the thoughts presented in this article are inherently\n  reconcilable with the words of the Rav.</p>\n  \n  <p>[23]The concept that they were \"naked in mitzvot\", Bereishit Rabbah\n  19:6, may take on new meaning with this approach. It was this one\n  mitzvah that would have solved the dilemma.</p>\n  \n  <p>[24]Applying the Tanhuma, which implies that it was set-up for man to\n  transgress, it would seem that this was the only way for man to move\n  beyond the stage of before the Tree. For reasons that we will not\n  investigate at this time, this was the method by which G-d created\n  this aspect of creation. How, though, do we explain the act of\n  disobedience? There is always the question of how to reconcile that\n  all is performed through the Will of G-d, yet we have free choice\n  even, unfortunately to do evil. Yet, in this case, this event may be\n  less of a paradox since it occurred during the week of creation. Since\n  this event shaped the very nature of free choice and reward and\n  punishment, the greater direction by G-d over the actions of man may\n  be accepted. Strangely, though, what is being said is that through an\n  act which G-d knew man would, by nature, have to perform yet that G-d\n  did forbid, the stage of the moral universe was created. This law that\n  it was impossible for man to follow, a most unique creation, is the\n  Tanhuma's explanation for the creation of this unique world where man\n  can reach his unique goals - a most interesting concept that you are\n  invited to further investigate. The approach in the body of the\n  article - that man had a choice and made a mistake - is, however, more\n  normative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The other was secular and had several young children and was usually busy with them during services.

I never heard of such a mitzva, but given that there are enough mitzvot I've never heard of before I decided not to argue.

Only in\n  this way can the eternity of Torah be understood [properly], for the\n  changes in the generations and their opinions, situation and material\n  and moral condition requires changes in their laws, decrees and\n  improvements.</strong> Rather, the truth is that this [issues from] the\n  wonderful wisdom [and] profound insight of the Torah, [which teaches]\n  that the interpretation of Torah [must be] given over to the sages of\n  each generation in order that the Torah remain a living force with the\n  nation, developing with it, and that indeed is its eternity. In this\n  way may we understand correctly the wording of the blessing \"Who gave\n  us a Torah of truth and implanted in us eternal life,\" which the Tur\n  interprets as follows: \"a Torah of truth\" refers to the Written Torah\n  and \"eternal life\" refers to the Oral Torah (Orah Hayyim 138, see\n  Shulhan Arukh thereto). This can well be understood in light of what\n  we have said: Written Torah can be called \"truth\" because it is\n  absolutely true. No additions or subtractions can be made to or from\n  it, and thus it is transmitted in written form, and a Torah scroll\n  which is missing one letter is invalid for use. <strong>The Oral Torah, its\n  interpretation, however, is not called absolute truth, but rather\n  conventional truth which depends on the \"judge in your days\" [i.e.,\n  based on the agreement of the sages]</strong>. For this very reason, though,\n  it is called \"eternal life implanted within us,\" for in it enters the\n  living spirit of every generation of human endeavor, and thus it is\n  called \"eternal life.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The purpose of halachos being passed down through oral law is to lend the Rabbi's the ability to apply the halacha for their generation.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, with both of these ideas presented above, the picture that emerges is that the laws of ethics were not written for two very fundamental but possibly seperate  reasons:</p>\n\n<p>1) Laws of Ethics are so axiomatic and logical that the it does not require a written down code to be set down, for they precede the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>2) The Laws of Ethics are and their application are inherently fluid and can be applied differently in each Generation. Having them passed down orally allows for them to have that requisite flexability.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://dor4.net16.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for more on Rabbi Glasner.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Something written can often times be more misinterpreted than something said, but the situations are different.</p>\n\n<p>In a case of he said she said, you are arguing over what was said or heard and you don't have the source to verify, except you do because you can call that person and ask.</p>\n\n<p>With a written document, you have the source, and no one disputes what's been said, but often what was meant or how it was said, especially when dealing with a document that didn't come with written punctuation, and is constantly being looked at by people with thousands of years of separation.</p>\n\n<p>So for example, is this the correct sentence?\n“Most of the time travelers worry about their luggage”</p>\n\n<p>Or is this the correct sentence?\n“Most of the time, travelers worry about their luggage.”</p>\n\n<p>And since we can't call up the author of the Torah to ask questions, the text is left ambiguous in that regard. Another example is we have forgotten what certain words mean, and we therefore have many different interpretations of the same word, because its original meaning has been lost.</p>\n\n<p>There are also the cases of euphemisms. So let's just say for the sake of argument that you become a prophet of our time, and you write a book, and you write the sentence \"It was raining cats and dogs.\" Everyone in your generation, who speaks English, would know that you are using a euphemism to describe that it was raining very heavily. But people 4,000 years from now who don't speak English will run the risk of thinking that there was a miracle, and that God was making cats and dogs fall from the sky.</p>\n\n<p>The next level of potential misinterpretation grow further when you start to deal with complex and usually changing ideals of morality. In the time of the Torah, one of the great goods you could do in that world was to marry your sister in law once your brother, her husband, had died. That is hardly considered a good thing anymore, because women are able to choose a new husband for themselves in this era, and we don't have the issue of ancestral land anymore. If someone were to try to do this law of Yibum (levirate marriage) now, even though it's clearly a miswah d'oraita, there would probably be a communal uproar. In this vein, if one were to try and write all the nuances of ethics of the time, then you would end up with divine ethics of a particular time that would be unchanging, which isn't helpful in the long run. Therefore it makes more sense to have sets of rules, and to have sages throughout time write the mussar, because they will always (hopefully) be updated with the world in which you find yourself.</p>\n\n<p>As for the derech eres point. Your point is valid, but i would suggest listening to some Rabbi Fohrman over at alephbeta.org as he has some interesting thoughts on that. Including the idea that the Torah does indeed incorporate some laws that are Derech Eres, but he also points out that the Torah might also be overturning certain Derech Eres. One of his main points is this law in Devarim Chapter 21</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טו  כִּי-תִהְיֶיןָ לְאִישׁ שְׁתֵּי נָשִׁים, הָאַחַת אֲהוּבָה וְהָאַחַת שְׂנוּאָה, וְיָלְדוּ-לוֹ בָנִים, הָאֲהוּבָה וְהַשְּׂנוּאָה; וְהָיָה הַבֵּן הַבְּכֹר, לַשְּׂנִיאָה.<br>\n  15. If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated;</p>\n  \n  <p>טז  וְהָיָה, בְּיוֹם הַנְחִילוֹ אֶת-בָּנָיו, אֵת אֲשֶׁר-יִהְיֶה, לוֹ--לֹא יוּכַל, לְבַכֵּר אֶת-בֶּן-הָאֲהוּבָה, עַל-פְּנֵי בֶן-הַשְּׂנוּאָה, הַבְּכֹר.<br>\n  16. then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born;\n  Blockquote</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He posits that this Law is [possibly] a response to Jacob making Joseph the firstborn and thereby causing all the sibling rivalry.</p>\n\n\n",

Learn the Shulchan Aruch with the Mishna Berura, as this will help you gain practical knowledge for the rest of the day.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you are a beginner I would start with the Chayei Adam or the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n\n<p>If your primary focus is on Gemara, the best thing to do is not to get caught up in the plethora of different sefarim on the Gemara. Rather, focus on learning \"pshat\" - the inner mechanics of the sugya very well, including Rashi and Tosfos, </p>\n\n<p>After mastering <em>Pshat</em> you should look at the commentary of the Meharsha, as his peirush is geared specifically to better understanding the pshat in the sugya. Then look at the other Rishonim ie. Ramban, Rambam, Rosh, Ran and then the Ritva and the Rashba.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have a handle on this, you can move on to other books, as without a deep understanding of the sugya more often than not you will not understand their true intentions and chiddushim on the sugya.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How would one locate a specific book in a Bet Midrash?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am modifying this \"latent\" question that I asked about 2 years ago. For those who have access, you can view the original version. I'm leaving the basic topic, the same, though.</p>\n\n<p>I'm comfortable learning in a <em>Bet Midrash</em>. I can locate most of the \"basic\" books that I need such as a Chumash, Gemarah and Ramba\"m. But the Bet Midrash is filled with loads of other books, many of them commentaries - <em>Shitah Mekubetzet, Rabbeinu Bechayeh</em>, etc. I'm not sure what many of these books are for.</p>\n\n<p>Occasionaly, I find a somewhat \"obscure\" book mentioned, such as in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/80820/5275\">this M.Y. answer</a>. This is a sample. But, in general, if I saw the title of a book mentioned, and wasn't sure what \"category\" the book was in, how would I be able to locate this in a Bet Midrash?</p>\n\n<p>View this question from a novice's standpoint. Let's say someone comes into the Bet Midrash late at night and he's pretty much there, alone. He reads the Shulchan Aruch, let's say, and it talks about some other reference that he hasn't heard of. How would he know where to look if there's no directory or catalog?</p>\n\n<p>Is there any book, video or online guide or even a yeshiva that does a basic \"Guide to the Bet Midrash\" or something like that? What about a Yeshiva or Bet Midrash that has a computer \"info database\" or an information desk, like most libraries have? If not, I wonder why there isn't. Something like this would be a huge benefit to both novices and experienced people as well. How else would someone become more efficient in his own learning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Generally speaking, books are grouped by type: Halacha, Chumash, Gemarah, etc etc. So once you find, for instance, a halacha book you recognize, odds are the books in that section are the halacha books. In your example, since the Shulchan Aruch is quoting it, it's probably a halacha book that would be found in that area. </p>\n\n<p>(As far as information desks and databases, Y.U. in N.Y. has an information desk in their library and, I believe, a database (access to the database may be restricted). B.M.G in Lakewood N.J. has a library-like system as well in their sforim libraries, and a written catalog of all the books.) </p>\n\n\n",

In the second chapter I noticed that I have to clean my hands when I wake up, then I say a blessing (<em>netilat yadayim</em>). Am I allowed to use soap with water when I wash with my hands, or should it be pure water in a washing cup?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dinonline.org/2011/09/09/netilas-yadayim-with-dirty-hands/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This Q & A</a> summarizes the rule and its footnotes lead you to the discussion in Shulchan Aruch with more info.</p>\n\n<p>Citing from it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One must be careful that one’s hands are free of dirt that one is\n  generally makpid (particular) about. Even if one is not particular\n  about the type of dirt, but people in general are particular about the\n  type of dirt, one must also ensure that hands are clean of it before\n  washing. It therefore depends on the particles in question.</p>\n  \n  <p>For ink marks, although most people are probably particular, stains\n  that have no substance do not constitute a chatzitzah (Mishnah Berurah\n  161:14).</p>\n  \n  <p>If one washed without cleaning off dirt that one is not particular\n  about, but that most people are particular about, one should wash\n  again without a berachah, because this question depends on a dispute\n  among poskim.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sources:</p>\n  \n  <p>See dispute between Rambam (personal, subjective), and Rashba\n  (objective) concerning the question of dirt that most are particular\n  about and the person in question is not particular. <strong>We are concerned\n  for both opinions on a lechatchilah level</strong> (Mishnah Berurah 161:7,\n  10, citing from the Magen Avraham).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on the bold phrase it seems that the rule is if you wake up and for some reason, you have dirt on your hands, (it DOES happen for various reasons, that I don't care to elaborate, here.) then, you need to wash your hands with soap first.</p>\n\n<p>However, as I have stated in my comment, <em>netillat yadayim</em> is a separate process which means that you MUST use the cup. (See Shulchan Aruch which discusses the process and procedure.) The point is, that washing your hands with soap if there is dirt is a prerequisite to <em>netilat yadayim</em>, not a substitution.</p>\n\n\n",

Tosfot on Taanit 9a quotes Sifrei:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עשר תעשר את כל תבואת זרעך היוצא השדה שנה שנה אין לי אלא תבואת זרעך שחייב במעשר רבית ופרקמטיא וכל שאר רווחים מנין ת\"ל את כל דהוה מצי למימר את תבואתך מאי כל לרבות רבית ופרקמטיא וכל דבר שמרויח בו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We learn from the extra word כל, all, that it applies to all income, not just fruits.</p>\n\n<p>The Bach apparently says that while giving maaser is a \"midat chasidut\", a good thing, it is not halacha. (Source is given as Yoreh Deah 331. I don't have it with mefarshim, so i can't confirm.) The Taz states that it is actually a mitzvah d'oraita as part of <em>maaser ani</em>. Others (Tzitz Eliezer 9:1) say that it's only d'rabanan.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam (Hilchot Matanot Aniyim 7:5) says that giving 1/10th is the middle ground as for how much money to give.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This site deals with this <a href=\"http://www.thehalachacenter.org/print-journal/5774/bereishis/vayeitzei.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maaser Kesafim</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is clear that the verse is referring to the mitzvah of tithing\n  produce that grows in the ground. What about tithing other  forms of\n  income and giving it to tzedaka? While there is a mitzvah to tithe\n  this type of earning too, does the same guarantee .of reward, and\n  permission to test Hashem, apply to maaser kesafim, as well.</p>\n  \n  <p>The <strong>Shulchan Aruch</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.247.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh De’ah, 247:4</a>) implies that it does. He\n  first says that it applies to any form of giving charity, and  then he\n  quotes an opinion that it applies only to maaser, which seems to imply\n  that the contemporary practice of maaser kesafim is also included in\n  this.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are those (see <strong>Pischei Teshuvah</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pithei_Teshuva_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.247.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Y. D., 247:2</a>) who question\n  this, and hold that it applies only to tithing produce, and  not to\n  other forms of charity. According to this approach maaser kesafim is\n  not really a tithe, but rather, simply a method for .calculating and\n  distributing charity</p>\n  \n  <p>This difference of opinion would seem to be rooted in the question of\n  what the source for tithing income other than produce  really is. Some\n  hold that it is an obligation from the Torah<br>\n  (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.9a.1?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Taanit.9a.1.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefos to Taanis 9a</a>\n  quoting Sifri; <strong>Shaar Ephraim</strong>, 84), while  others hold that it is an\n  obligation miderabbanan (see <strong>Chavos Yair</strong>, 224; Teshuvah Me’ahavah,\n  I:86). A third opinion (<strong>Bach</strong>, Y  D., 331; this seems to be the\n  consensus of the later poskim – see <strong>She’elas Yaavetz</strong>, I:1,3,6) holds\n  that maaser kesafim is actually  not an obligation but rather merely a\n  custom. This dispute has a number of ramifications, and one of them\n  would seem to be  the point that we mentioned previously. If the\n  obligation of Maaser kesafim is min HaTorah then it might be included\n  in the  permissibility to test Hashem, like other forms of maaser,\n  whereas if is merely a method of separating funds to be distributed\n  to charity, it might not be included in this special dispensation.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, <strong>Ahavas Chessed</strong> (18) proves that even if Maaser kesafim is\n  only miderabbanan, it would still be included in the  special\n  dispensation to test Hashem. This is apparent from the fact that the\n  navi Malachi, who declared that it is permitted  to test Hashem with\n  the mitzvah of maaser, lived at the period of beginning of the second\n  Beis Hamikdash. According to  the Gemora<br>\n  (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.82a.11-14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 82b</a>) the mitzvah of\n  tithing produce did not apply min haTorah at that time. As such, when\n  Malachi  taught that the prohibition of testing Hashem does not apply\n  to maaser, it must have been a reference to the mitzvah of  “,tithing\n  all forms of income. In fact, implies the Ahavas Chessed, since the\n  verse says, “and there will be food in My house  the main point seems\n  to be providing for the poor in general, and Torah scholars in\n  particular, as they are those who reside  in “Hashem’s house.” In that\n  case, the verse in Malachi would even apply to  the general mitzvah of\n  charity, and not only maaser kesafim. Indeed, the  consensus of the\n  later authorities appears to be that one may indeed apply  ,this test\n  to any type of tzedaka (<strong>Radvaz</strong>, Matnos Aniyim, 7:10; <strong>Maharsha</strong> \n  Pesachim 8a; <strong>Chasam Sofer</strong>, ibid; <strong>Aruch Hashulchan</strong>), as per the first\n  opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the opposite of shalom?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Could anyone explain me the antonym of shalom?\nThe antonym of light is darkness, but Yeshayahu seems to tell that the antonym of shalom is rah. But isn't rah the antonym of tov, like in the etz hada'at tov v'rah?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In order to understand why the opposite of ra is shalom, not tov, we need to go back to Bereshit.   G-d created order.  Order in G-d’s\ncreation is an expression of harmony, balance and integration.   In\nG-d’s creation, this order leads directly to the well-being of\neverything created and the fullest possible relationship with the\nCreator.  In the Tenach, this is called shalom, peace.  The\nintroduction of evil into this harmonious existence brings about\nchaos, the disruption of shalom.  Our culture considers good and evil\nto be ethical opposites, but the Tenach views peace and evil as\nontological opposites.  The antonym “peace and evil” describes the\nexistence of the world, not the potential of ethical choices.  Peace\nand evil precede the ethical choices of good and evil.  Even in the\nBereshit account, good and evil stand as possible but not actual\nantonyms.  They only become actual ethical descriptions of human\nchoices after the choice is made.  But shalom exists as an actual\n(ontological) fact from the moment of creation.</p>\n<p>You might say, “All this is interesting philosophical discussion, but\nwhat difference does it make to me today?”  Ah, it makes all the\ndifference.  The Tenach tells us that evil is not a part of creation,\na fact of existence.  It is the disintegration of creation, the\ncollapse of what was originally and essentially at peace.\nFurthermore, this implies that the end of the game is not the Good,\nthe True and the Beautiful (as the Greeks thought), but rather shalom,\nthe state of the world where the lion lays down with the lamb.  Our\ndirection is toward the past, a return to the Garden of delight in\npeaceful harmony with itself and with its Creator.  G-d is restoring\npeace on earth because everything started in peace.  When I apply this\nfact of creation to my world today, I am directed to pursue peace.  I\nam called to be the peacemaker, the one who brings the world into\nharmony with its Creator.  I am challenged to stand against all the\nforces of chaos, disintegration, separation and dissention.  I am\nexhorted to seek unity.  Where I find brokenness, I am asked to heal.\nWhere I find heartache, I am asked to comfort.  Where I find schism, I\nam asked to repair.  Peace is my project.  It begins with peace with\nG-d and extends itself toward every aspect of His creation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Is this view correct?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Metzudat David on Ecclesiastes 3:1 states for explaining the phrase: \"There is a time for every purpose:</p>\n\n<p><b>ועת לכל חפץ .</b> לכל הדברים שהאדם חפץ בו גם לזה יש עת , כי לא בכל עת יחפוץ בדבר <strong>אחד כי פעם יחפוץ בדבר מה ופעם בחלופו</strong> , וכאשר יפרש במקראות שלאחריו : </p>\n\n<p>I am translating only the bold phrase:</p>\n\n<p>\"There is a time when someone will desire in one thing, and another time when he will desire its <strong>opposite</strong>\"</p>\n\n<p>From this explanation, I infer that what Solomon wrote in verses 2-8 (and what \"The Byrds\" sang <strong>almost</strong> verbatim ;-) consists of a pair of opposites.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, viewing verse 8:</p>\n\n<p>עֵ֤ת לֶֽאֱהֹב֙ וְעֵ֣ת לִשְׂנֹ֔א עֵ֥ת <strong>מִלְחָמָ֖ה</strong> וְעֵ֥ת שָׁלֽוֹם)</p>\n\n<p>A time to love, and a time to hate; A time for <strong>war</strong>, and a time for peace.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore the antonym for שָׁלֽוֹם is מִלְחָמָ֖ה</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think the postulate in the question is a false dichotomy.

    "content": "# Can Eruv Tavshilin be done for a Yom Tov rather than for shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Outside of Israel, we celebrate a Yom Tov for 2 consecutive days. This year, Shavuot comes directly after Shabbat. As I understand it, on such days, one is only allowed to cook in preparation for a 24 hour period (I'm not 100% clear on the limitations of this). </p>\n\n<p>My question is if we can do an Eruv Tavshilin before Shabbat or right before the Yom Tov, so that it becomes permissible to prepare food on the first day for both Yom Tov days. Is Eruv Tavshilin exclusive to Shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The premise in your 2nd paragraph is incorrect, namely  \"so that it becomes permissible to prepare food on the first day for <strong>both</strong> Yom Tov days\".</p>\n\n<p>The Eruv Tavshilin allows one to cook on Yom Tov to prepare for Shabbat only - not for another day of Yom Tov. Thus, if Yom Tov were on Thursday and Friday, followed by Shabbat, as was the case last Rosh Hashanna, one is NOT allowed to cook on Thursday to prepare for Shabbat or even for Yom Tov on Friday. Preperations for Shabbat can only be made on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise for Shavuot that passed, this case is simpler. One can and should cook on Friday as it is not Yom Tov and prepare sufficient food for Shabbat and the 2 days of Shavu'ot. If needed, one can cook on Yom Tov only what is needed for that day of Yom Tov, not the next day. As you know, one is not allowed to cook on Shabbat. Thus, since Shabbat does not follow Yom Tov, there is no Eruv.</p>\n\n\n",

The Radvaz suggests that he not take on those mitzvos that require kedusha or tahara such as Tefillin, Sefer Torah or Mezuzah.  Tzitzis do not have kedusha.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an interesting thought (at least I think it is:)  The question is raised as to how Avraham Avinu could have kept Shabbos as a Ben No'ach.  One answer that is given is that he wore tzitzis in a reshus ha'rabim (a public place.)  The logic goes that, if Avraham is a Jew and required to observe Shabbos then the tzitzis on his four cornered garment are necessary and he has not carried in the reshus ha'rabbim.  If, on the other hand, he is not Jewish then the tzitzis are unnecessary attachments to his garment and he would be carrying and violating Shabbos thus exempting him from being a Noahide observing our Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>So, you can attach whatever significance you want to Avraham's tzitzis.</p>\n\n\n",

Kadesh\n  was an important site in Israelite history. It was the chief site of\n  encampment for the Israelites during their wandering in the wilderness\n  of Zin (Deut. 1:46); it was from Kadesh that the spies were sent out\n  into Canaan (Num. 13:1-26); The first failed attempt to take the land\n  was made from Kadesh (Num. 14:40-45); Moses disobediently struck the\n  rock that brought forth water at this location (Num. 20:11); Miriam\n  and Aaron died and were buried nearby (Num. 20:1, 22-29); and Moses\n  sent envoys to the King of Edom from Kadesh (Num. 20:14), asking for\n  permission to let the Israelites pass through his terrain.

Ultimately, the methods by which one interprets the Torah, the list of rules that we use to get from rather-confusing-text to coherent-set-of-rules, are supposed to be those communicated to us from Moshe, who got them directly from God. There are of course certain wrinkles - one, for instance, is the fact that different Tannaim had different lists of rules, and one of the ones that had Gzeira Shava in it (as far as I know there were only two such competing lists, and it may have been in both; I don't know the details) was vindicated by history. It must be noted at this point that one of the assumptions in Judaism is that an omnipotent god will make sure that the correct version of his laws is the one that is vindicated by history.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the validity of the Oral Torah in general, there's a famous story in which Hillel is approached by a convert who wanted to learn only the Written Torah because he didn't trust the Oral Torah. Hillel being Hillel, he accepted the man's request and began by teaching him the Hebrew alphabet - א is the letter aleph, and so on. The following day he says, \"Let's review what we learned yesterday\" and says א is the letter bet. The convert, naturally, objects, to which Hillel replies, \"Isn't what you're saying right now part of the Oral Torah?\"</p>\n\n<p>The object lesson being, of course, that the difference between \"how to even pronounce the words written here\" and \"what the finer points of a particularly complex rule of Biblical exegesis are\" is just a matter of degree.</p>\n\n<p>I personally take a mathematical approach to Judaism based on the above principles. Judaism is like geometry. We have the Rambam's thirteen principles of faith (one of which attests the veracity of the text of the Torah) - call these our axioms. We have Rabbi Yishmael's thirteen rules of exegesis - call these our rules of inference. All of the rest of Judaism flows logically from that, just as all of the rest of Euclidean mathematics flows logically from Euclid's five original axioms and the laws of logic. If you switch out Rabbi Yishmael's rules of exegesis for Rabbi Akiva's, or switch out the Rambam's thirteen principles of faith for, say, an alternative grouping that allows for corporeality of God (which used to be far more legitimate than it is now), you get non-Euclidean Judaism. Which, though it sounds like the domain of Cthulhu, is if you know mathematics an equally valid system in which to work.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How will we know the moshiach when he arrives?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was asked this question over Shavuot and I didn't know either, so I turn to Mi Yodeya.  We are told<sup>1</sup> that when the moshiach comes Eliyahu HaNavi will announce him; the implication is that this is when he first arrives, not after he's fulfilled the duties of the job (gather the exiles, rebuild the temple, etc).  So how will we know at the beginning, before he's proved himself, that this really is Eliyahu and the moshiach?  Anybody could claim to be -- wouldn't be our first false claimants, after all.  So when somebody arrives and says he's the moshiach and we should immediately follow him to Eretz Yisrael, how will we know that we really should?  Will Eliyahu do something unambiguous to establish <em>his</em> identity, perhaps?</p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> Both of us have often heard that Eliyahu will herald the moshiach, and I have the impression that this is what we're hoping for when we sing Eliyahu HaNavi after <em>havdalah</em> each week -- let him show up <em>right now</em> with this news.  <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28183/rambam-and-eliyahu-hanavi-and-mosiach\">This question</a> and Scimonster in a comment point to Malachi 3:23.  (According to the linked question, the Rambam disagrees with Eliyahu as herald.  So I'm asking according to people other than the Rambam.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Eiruvin 43 quotes the Pasuk of הנה אנכי שלח לכם as proof that Eliyahu will come at least one day before משיח בן דוד. The Gemara there also takes it for granted that although Eliyahu won't come Erev Shabbos so as not to ruin Shabbos preparations, Moshiach himself <em>can</em> come since all our friendly neighbors will run to help us. Although, according to Rashi there, it is possible for Moshiach to come and not be aware of it even the next day, it seems like the change of attitude will happen without a catalyst. Therefore, we will see that the Galus with all its applications will be over.</p>\n\n<p>More to the point, though, is the fact that Eliyahu Hanavi is a Navi. The Halacha of any Navi is that he must prove himself to be a Navi. He will either predict something with razor-sharp accuracy, as the Rambam writes in his הקדמה למשניות or he will perform miracles. This is the criteria of a Navi.</p>\n\n<p>Moshiach himself has certain requirements that he must pass. The Pasuk says about him וירום ונשא וגבוה מאד. The Gemara says that he will be able to sniff out a liar, and he'll be able to rule without witness. The Gemara relates that when Bar Kochba first rose up against the Romans they thought he might indeed be Moshiach. The Chachamim tested to see if he isמורח וודאין. He wasn't, so they left him.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam seems to say that we don't have to know at the outset that it is the actual Moshiach. When he succeeds we will know, and if he doesn't succeed he can still be a Tzaddik who tried.</p>\n\n\n",

How do I know who to believe if, a) I want to come back with Moshiach and b) I don't want to contribute to a terrible holocaust?</p>\n\n\n",

I shall ask my question. \nI lost quite a lot of important things in an apartment fire (no insurance)\nso .. I set up a gofundme thing (now deleted from the massive amount of threats , accusations, and hatemail)\nand joined a few Jewish forums to... see if anyone could give the URL link a few shares or something.\nTzitzit , tefellin , prayer shawl , various books, etc.\nAll lost . . . . This was a while back .. anyhow Am I wrong to have tried to obtain help?\nI was told it was not \"kosher\" to ask for help , and my situation was \"fake\" , and that it is impossible for me not to know any other Jewish people.... (There isn't a synagogue nearby I live in a very rural area) there is .. like a geonology type thing.. but they don't even practice Jeudaism so..thats a no go ... *I'm not asking for help here , I just would like to know if I am wrong for seeking help... </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While there is no explicit commandment stating that you MUST ask for help when you need money, the implied mitzvah is that someone must <strong>give</strong> to someone who does ask for help. This implies that in order for the giver to perform the mitzvah, someone must ask him, though, of course, one should give even before being asked, if one knows that there is someone needy.</p>\n\n<p>There are numerous verses in the Torah regarding supporting the needy. One notable one is:</p>\n\n<p>Deuteronomy 15:7:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If there be among you a needy man, one of thy brethren, within any of\n  thy gates, in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt\n  not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy needy brother;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the above, we can infer that there is no sin in asking for help <strong>if you need it</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>However, the key part to this is that you must <strong>need</strong> it. In other words, if you haven't made even a small effort to support yourself and have no intention of doing so, that is problematic. That doesn't mean that you can't and shouldn't ask while you have no job or means to support yourself. But, the idea is that you cannot remain a continuous burden on society expecting others to continuously support you while you sit idly and take advantage of this.</p>\n\n<p>The importance of work is mentioned in Pirkei Avot 2:2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabban Gamliel the son of Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi said: Excellent is the\n  study of the Torah together with a worldly occupation, For the\n  exertion [expended] in both of them causes sin to be forgotten. And\n  all [study of the] Torah in the absence of a worldly occupation comes\n  to nothing in the end and leads to sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yonah explains that if one does not work, he becomes completely dependent on the donations of the community, and may even become so desparate that he begins to steal in order to supply even his basic needs.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, try to support yourself as best as possible, but if you are in dire need, ask for help as well. Most of all, if needed, ask for help for work, if you need that.</p>\n\n\n",

My question on this reason is The Mon started falling on the 16th of Iyar, the year the Jews left Egypt, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14313&st=&pgnum=76&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Kidushin 38a - 5 lines from the top</a> thus when they came back from receiving the Torah they ate Mon. Then what difference does it make that they were unable to slaughter, they ate Mon?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It seems, the point maybe in reverse: the custom of eating dairy on the holiday of Shavuos while maintaining all the stringencies of separation between the two is to show the angels that we carefully maintain the halachos of <em>basar becholov</em>. Perhaps, the difficulty of following these rules has motivated the approach that is mentioned in the question.</p>\n<p>There is an interesting take regarding the eating the dairy meal given by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.494.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RaM\"A Sh\"A O\"C 494:3</a>: We have a custom everywhere to eat dairy food on the first day of Shavuot. And it seems to me that the reason is: It is like the two foods that are taken on the evening of Pesach, a reminder of the Korban Pesach and a reminder of the Korban Chagiga, so too we eat a dairy food followed by a meat food, and we bring with them two loaves on the table in place of the Mizbeach, and thus there will be a reminder of the two loaves that were brought on \"The day of the Bikkurim.\"</p>\n<p>As we know from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.105a.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Chulin 105a</a> that one may eat dairy and meat at the same table, although one must eat dairy before meat. We also have many rabbinic restrictions on separation between eating dairy and meat, which need to be carefully followed. For example, one should not have hard or sharp cheeses for dairy, which will require waiting a long period of time after the eating dairy.</p>\n<p>There is a midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.8.2?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 8:2</a> which further corroborates on the point suggested by RaM\"A: When Hashem came to give the Torah to Yisroel, the angels were aggravated. Hashem said to them, “Why are you disputing the giving of the Torah? You ate meat with milk in Avraham avinu’s home, as the passuk says: ‘And he took cream and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and he placed [them] before them, ‘ (Bereishis 18:8) while even babies from Yisroel are careful not to eat both together.” And the angels left, rebuked.</p>\n<p>The source of this answer is dvar Torah from <a href=\"https://dinonline.org/2020/05/28/the-minhag-of-eating-dairy-products-on-shavuos/#:%7E:text=The%20Rema%20notes%20the%20accepted%20custom%20of%20eating,Halechem%20offered%20in%20the%20Beis%20Hamikdash%20on%20Shavuos.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dinonline.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Metsudah and Koren translate similarly, but this is what I have at hand now.</p>\n\n<p>My first question is the phrase ועל מנוחתם יקדישו את שמך. They are reading it as if it says ועל ידי, through. Is this a common phenomenon in nusach hat'fila? Usually על is used to mean 'on' or 'upon' such as וקדש את שמך על מקדשי שמך.</p>\n\n<p>The phrase על ידי, if we are to assume this is functioning as, should be  written out in full as we find in שחרית לשבת the phrase על ידי משה עבדך. </p>\n\n<p>A second less bothersome question.   The beginning of the request also seems uncommon. We don't usually run from the praise into the request without some type of dividing or connecting tool. Like a vav as is utilized in the regular weekday שמנה עשרה, or an address to Hashem like אלהינו ואלהי אבותינו as we find in the follwing paragraph. </p>\n\n<p>Edit:I ust found a variant translation which at least does not translate this as a request. The Hirsch siddur has this:\nYour children will realize it and they will know that such rest is theirs from You, and for their rest they will hallow Your Name.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, are there any other options in translating this phrase? I would also find acceptable if you can bring enough similar usages that would prove my assumptions wrong.</p>\n\n\n",

Hebrew, like all natural languages, has evolved over time from the times of Tanach until today, and on top of that, Modern Hebrew is the result of an intentional revival and modernization of the language, including a great deal of adaptations of words from other languages and re-appropriations of words that meant something slightly or drastically different in earlier forms of Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>Some examples of re-appropriations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The word <a href=\"http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2011/02/what-does-chashmal-mean.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">חשמל</a> (<em>chashmal</em>), which means \"electricity\" in Modern Hebrew, refers to some esoteric property of angels in Tanach (Yechezkeil).</p></li>\n<li><p>A more subtle example is the word דג (<em>dag</em>). In <a href=\"http://he.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow\">Modern Hebrew</a>, it refers to the same biological class of animals that the most common sense of the <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fish\" rel=\"nofollow\">English</a> word \"fish\" does: \"A cold-blooded vertebrate animal that lives in water, moving with the help of fins and breathing with gills.\" However, there's no good reason to assume that when used in Tanach, for example - famously - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah#The_fish\" rel=\"nofollow\">in Yonah</a>, the intent of the word accorded with contemporary biological taxonomy, so it could very well have meant \"whale\" or some other aquatic creature that we wouldn't call a \"fish.\" I have heard people unaware of the difference between Modern and Biblical Hebrew assuming that commentators interpreting the Bible were expressing ignorance of the true meaning of \"fish\" when including \"whale\" in the possible interpretations of an instance of \"דג.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>The verb \"גָּר,\" in Modern Hebrew, <a href=\"http://he.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%92%D7%A8#.D7.92.D6.B8.D6.BC.D7.A8\" rel=\"nofollow\">means</a>, simply \"to dwell somewhere.\" However, in Biblical Hebrew, it means specifically \"to sojourn through a strange land.\" A reader who is familiar with the Modern sense of the word but unaware of this nunance in the Biblical sense could miss important meaning in the text, as in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Ruth.1.1?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ruth 1:1</a>: \"‏... ‏וַיֵּלֶךְ אִישׁ מִבֵּ֧ית לֶ֣חֶם  יְהוּדָה <strong>לָגוּר</strong> בִּשְׂדֵי מוֹאָב‏ ...‏\" - \"... And a certain man of Beth-lehem in Judah went <strong>to sojourn</strong> in the field of Moab ...\" If this verb is read as \"to dwell,\" then the reader misinterprets the subject's intended temporary evacuation as an intended permanent relocation.<sup>1</sup> Thus, the dramatic <em>change of intent</em> hinted in the next verse's \"‏... ‏וַיִּֽהְיוּ־שָֽׁם\" - \"... and they continued there,\" is also lost.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I don't know if any comprehensive dictionaries of Biblical Hebrew, consistent with Jewish tradition, exist. To be fully accurate, such a dictionary would have to deal explicitly with the fact that the same word can have different meanings in different contexts, depending on the time period the book came from as well as the actual context.</p>\n\n<p>Not the same as a dictionary, but one way to read Tanach in English translation, consistent with Jewish tradition, would be to use a complete Jewish translation of Tanach.

This example is at the top of my mind thanks to <a href=\"http://www.etshalom.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Yitzchak Etshalom</a> having pointed it out in an excellent lecture I was fortunate to recently attend.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Hebrew used in the Tanakh is often the source for most of Modern Hebrew. However, influences of history have changed the modern day Hebrew in ways that are not always so noticeable. For Example:</p>\n<p>A lot of Aramaic has slipped its way into modern Hebrew, even down to the most basic words.</p>\n<p>Father in Tanakh: \"Av\"\nFather in Modern Hebrew: \"Abba\" (Aramaic)</p>\n<p>This is not a unique phenomenon, the Tanakh itself has loan words from other languages. If you asked the average Israeli, they would not know that Abba is Aramaic in origin.</p>\n<p>The reversing waw/vav is also heavily prevalent in Biblical Hebrew (but by no means is used 100% of the time). It's common English name of the reversing waw/vav is because it switches the past tense to future tense, and future tense to past tense, simply by adding a waw to the front of the verb. You often see a mixing of the normal verb conjugation with a sprinkling of this reversing waw in many paragraphs, including the first paragraph of the Torah.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּרֵאשִׁית, בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים, אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם, וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ.\nוְהָאָרֶץ, הָיְתָה תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ, וְחֹשֶׁךְ, עַל פְּנֵי תְהוֹם.\nוְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים, מְרַחֶפֶת עַל פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם. <strong>וַיֹּאמֶר</strong>\nאֱלֹהִים, יְהִי אוֹר; <strong>וַיְהִי</strong> אוֹר; <strong>וַיַּרְא</strong> אֱלֹהִים אֶת\nהָאוֹר, כִּי טוֹב .<strong>וַיַּבְדֵּל</strong> אֱלֹהִים, בֵּין הָאוֹר וּבֵין\nהַחֹשֶׁךְ; <strong>וַיִּקְרָא</strong> אֱלֹהִים לָאוֹר יוֹם, וְלַחֹשֶׁךְ קָרָא\nלָיְלָה. <strong>וַיְהִי</strong> עֶרֶב <strong>וַיְהִי</strong> בֹקֶר, יוֹם אֶחָד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some other oddities would include the verb roots having changed as Hebrew pronunciation by communities caused mistakes to become the new norm. i can't remember the word off the top of my head, but i remember that the root in the Tanakh had an Ayin, but in modern Hebrew, the Ayin was replaced with an Aleph, most likely due to the pronunciation of Ayin being lost in many communities and the writing reflecting the pronunciation.</p>\n<p>Another possible large difference is the use of the \"present tense.\" Modern Hebrew has an established present tense, while according to Historians and Biblical grammarians, Biblical Hebrew has no \"present tense.\" According to them, Biblical Hebrew has only two tenses, perfect tense (action is complete) and imperfect tense (action is not yet complete). For them, words/conjugations that we would call present tense are actually \"active participles.\" An example of what this means/looks like would be the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָנִי שׁוֹמֵר אוֹתֶךָ</p>\n<p>How the text translates in Modern Hebrew: \"I am guarding you.\"</p>\n<p>How the text translates in Biblical Hebrew according to Historians: \"I am the\none that guards you.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But if you try and make the argument of Biblical Hebrew not having a present tense to your local Rabbi, be prepared for some resistance. The prior two times i had mentioned in a Synagogue setting that Biblical Hebrew did not have a present tense, it led to a very long debate in which the Rabbi's would refuse to allow anyone who heard my statement to walk away with the belief that Biblical Hebrew didn't have a present tense.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Modern Hebrew is essentially the same as Biblical Hebrew. Of course as mentioned by the other writer there are differences in usage and also Hebrew isn't the same from one book of the bible to another; by the last books the language is often not Hebrew at all, it's Aramaic.  And there's evidence that the aleph and the ayin were pronounced the same even in Biblical times, at least later on, ayin often dropped out or was replaced by aleph.  As far as the present tense issue: Semitic languages (including Arabic) do not have present and past tenses, they have perfect/imperfect tenses. But Hebrew perhaps has more of a present tense than the others: in the famous formula about God, I was, I am, I will be,  the present tense is represented by the present participle just as in modern Hebrew.</p>\n\n\n",

Other small differences exist due to pronunciation (e.g. עוזיהו in M and עיזיה in 1QIsaᵃ in verse 1:1). </p>\n\n<p>Letters or words were occasionally added to 1QIsaᵃ supralinearly as a correction, or deleted. Usually the correction brings the spelling closer to that of the masoretic text (e.g. the insertion of the weak ע in the word יש[ע]יהו in 1:1).</p>\n\n<p>There are also times where 1QIsaᵃ agrees with the Old Greek (LXX) or other versions over M. For example, in Isaiah 36:11, we have העם in M but האנשים in 1QIsaᵃ, corresponding to the form in the LXX (ἀνθρώπων). </p>\n\n<p>Regarding petuchot and setumot, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=gJYAAAAAMAAJ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oesch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hum.huji.ac.il/upload/_FILE_1371985280.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maori</a> demonstrated that 1QIsaᵃ agrees with medieval masoretic manuscripts in about 80% of cases.</p>\n\n<p>For more on the phenomena see Emmanuel Tov's \"<a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=5Sh7dBDD7ykC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible</a>\".

    "content": "# Why do we need both the Two Tablets as well as the Sefer Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <em>sefer Torah</em>, i.e., the full scroll containing all 5 Books contains the 10 Commandments, which was inscribed on the 2 luchot (\"tablets\"). All of Israel heard the 10 Commandments (according to midrash, they heard the 1st directly from G-d, then Moses conveyed the rest to them afterwards) at Mt. Sinai, already.</p>\n\n<p>Several related questions:</p>\n\n<p>Why did they need a written version of the 10 Commandments on 2 Stone Tablet,. anyway, if they had already heard all of it before they received the written version carved on the tablets?</p>\n\n<p>If we assume the theory (IIRC, Ramba\"m mentions this) that the Sefer Torah was written by Moses as events occurred, then, shortly after the Revelation, Moses wrote down the 10 Commandments. Did B'nai Isra'el have access to a \"partial\" Sefer Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>i gave a lecture regarding this over Shavu'oth, let me see if i can sum my talk for you.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah is a copy of everything that was said, so one might think it's redundant to then have the Luchoth there as well, but they are two entirely different things. The Sefer Torah is the words of everything, whereas the Luchoth are the sign of contract while also being the contract. Which is why they are called \"לוחות הברית\" - the tablets of the covenant/contract.\" So their function has two purposes, one of which being to have written the terms of the agreement, the second of which is to by a physical symbol of the agreement, as is the case with the other covenants in the Torah (which is the same as how covenants were made in the Ancient Middle East).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Genesis 31:46-48</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּאמֶר יַעֲקֹב לְאֶחָיו לִקְטוּ אֲבָנִים, וַיִּקְחוּ אֲבָנִים\n  וַיַּעֲשׂוּ-גָל; וַיֹּאכְלוּ שָׁם, עַל-הַגָּל.</p>\n  \n  <p>And Jacob said unto his brethren: 'Gather stones'; and they took\n  stones, and made a heap. And they did eat there by the heap.</p>\n  \n  <p>וַיִּקְרָא-לוֹ לָבָן, יְגַר שָׂהֲדוּתָא; וְיַעֲקֹב, קָרָא לוֹ\n  גַּלְעֵד.</p>\n  \n  <p>And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha; but Jacob called it Galeed.</p>\n  \n  <p>וַיֹּאמֶר לָבָן, הַגַּל הַזֶּה עֵד בֵּינִי וּבֵינְךָ הַיּוֹם; עַל-כֵּן\n  קָרָא-שְׁמוֹ, גַּלְעֵד.</p>\n  \n  <p>And Laban said: 'This heap is witness between me and thee this day.'\n  Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The sign of covenant is supposed to not be owned by any one of the parties, but be accessible to all. Which is why Jacob and Laban build the stone pile in an area that belongs to neither party. And why it is not an accident that God makes the Rainbow as the sign of the covenant to not flood the Earth again. He makes a sign that is not owned by any of the three parties of the covenant, while being accessible to all three. The first party is God, which is why the Rainbow is in the heavens, but is still visible on Earth. The second is mankind (Noah and his family) who have control of the Earth but can see the heavens. And the third is the animals, who needed a sign that they could see, without the risk that it could be taken over by mankind on Earth. Hence, the Rainbow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Genesis 9:12</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים, זֹאת אוֹת-הַבְּרִית אֲשֶׁר-אֲנִי נֹתֵן בֵּינִי\n  וּבֵינֵיכֶם, וּבֵין כָּל-נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה, אֲשֶׁר אִתְּכֶם--לְדֹרֹת,\n  עוֹלָם.</p>\n  \n  <p>And God said: 'This is the token of the covenant which I make between\n  Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual\n  generations:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which is why according to some of the sages, the Ten Commandments were not split up as 5 on one tablet and 5 on the other, as this does not make contractual/covenental sense. It makes more sense for each tablet to be one complete copy of the ten, and then two tablets for the 2 parties, God and the nation of Israel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Midrash Rabbah on Exodus 37.6</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עשרת הדברות כיצד? היו עשויין ה' על לוח זה וה' על לוח זה כדברי ר'\n  יהודה. ור' נחמיה אומר: י' על לוח זה וי' על לוח זה, שנאמר שמות לד</p>\n  \n  <p>The Ten Commandments, how were they done? There was made 5 upon this\n  tablet and 5 upon the other tablet according to the words of Rabbi\n  Yehudah. And Rabbi Nehemiah says: Upon this tablet there is 10 and\n  upon the other tablet is (the same) 10, as it is written [in Exodus\n  34].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For more information on this topic, and an answer as to why then both copies would be placed in the Ark, please read this article by Dr. Meshulam Margaliot (Emeritus, Dept. of Bible Bar Ilan University)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What was Written on the Two Tablets?</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>…we are dealing with the text of a covenant, a type of contract\n  between two (or more) parties. For obvious reasons, it is customary\n  for every written contract or agreement to be issued in duplicate,\n  each party receiving a complete copy of the agreement, contract, or\n  covenant. This was also the practice in the ancient Near East. The\n  most famous example of two copies of a diplomatic agreement between\n  two kingdoms is the treaty containing the pact made between the\n  Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II and the Hittite King Hattusilis III, c.\n  1270 B.C.E. The Egyptian copy was found in Egypt, and the Hittite one\n  in the capital of the Hittites, in eastern Turkey. The contents of\n  both copies are identical. It would be reasonable for the pact made at\n  Sinai to be issued in two copies, one for the Lord, and one for the\n  Israelites. This practice explains why one tablet did not suffice,\n  rather two were needed. It is self-evident that the Lord's tablet had\n  to be placed where the Divine Presence (shechina, Biblical Hebrew\n  kavod) was found (see Ex. 29:43 and 40:34), in the Holy Ark made\n  specifically for this purpose: \"And deposit in the Ark the Pact which\n  I will give you\" (Ex. 25:16), \"He took the Pact and placed it in the\n  ark\" (Ex. 40:20). \"The Pact\" [edut] is used as shorthand for the \"two\n  Tablets of the Pact\" (Ex. 31:18), also called shnei luchot habberit,\n  the \"two Tablets of the Covenant\" (Deut. 9:15). But what about the\n  Israelite's copy, on the second Tablet, where was that copy placed?\n  Here we note a common practice in the ancient Near East. When a treaty\n  was made between parties of unequal status, the lesser partner, or\n  vassal, would place his copy of the pact in the temple of his god, the\n  reason being that the vassal had then to take an oath in the name of\n  his god, to \"the great king.\"  Depositing a copy in the temple of the\n  vassal strengthened the vassal's obligation to the greater king. In\n  addition, sanctity was ascribed to the treaty itself, because the gods\n  of each side were witness to the agreement: Compare Laban's words to\n  Jacob after striking a treaty: \"May the G-d of Abraham and the god of\n  Nahor\" --their ancestral deities-- \"judge between us.\" (Gen.31:53)\n  Since the Israelites had the status of vassal vis-à-vis G-d and were\n  the lesser partners to the Covenant, it was reasonable for them to\n  file their copy of the Pact in the Holy Ark of the Lord their G-d.\n  Thus we conclude that both Tablets were placed together in the Ark in\n  the Tabernacle…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/kitisa/mar.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/kitisa/mar.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

Moses Isserles</a> writes that someone who will turn 13 on Shabbat should not lead the Friday night services because at that point he is not yet 13:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובמקומות שלא נהגו כן אין לקטן לעבור לפני התיבה אפילו בתפלת ערבית אפילו הגיע לכלל י\"ג שנים ביום השבת אין להתפלל ערבית של שבת דהרי עדיין אין לו י\"ג שנה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Commenting on this, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Gombiner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Abraham Gombiner</a> explains that this is because we pray before night actually begins, thus the kid is still a minor. But if we would pray after it is already actually night then the kid can lead the services:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פי' דבמדינתנו מתפללין ערבית מבע\"י והוא לא נכנס בשנת י\"ד עד תחילת ליל שבת שהוא יום שנולד בו אבל אם מתפללים ערבית בלילה מותר לעבור לפני התיבה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this, the <em>Bar Mitzvah</em> takes effect the moment the kid's birthday begins, i.e. when the previous night begins. However, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naftali_Zvi_Yehuda_Berlin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Naftali Tzvi Yehuda Berlin</a> disagrees with this. In his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40994&st=&pgnum=7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to Berachot 2a</a> he cites the Talmud's question as a refutation of R.

The Talmud asks why the Mishnah first discusses the time for the nighttime recitation of <em>Shema</em> and then discusses the time for the daytime recitation of <em>Shema</em>; it should discuss the daytime <em>Shema</em> first. But, says R. Berlin, if R. Gombiner is correct then this question makes no sense. Of course the Mishnah would discuss the nighttime <em>Shema</em> first because that obligation occurs before the obligation of the daytime <em>Shema</em>, since every person becomes 13 at night. From the fact that the Talmud asks this question, then, we can infer that the <em>Bar Mitzvah</em> does <strong>not</strong> take effect when night begins; rather, it goes by the time that the person was born:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מכאן יש ראיה להפוסקים דשני גדלות תליא משעה לשעה ודלא כהמג\"א וסייעתו בסי' נ\"ג ס\"ק י\"ג דתליא בריש מעל\"ע דאם כן מאי מקשה הא סדר החיוב כך הוא תחילה של ערבית ואח\"כ של שחרית אלא מוכח דבתר שעה אזלינן והדברים עתיקים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This merging of national life in God is also included in the <em>Avodah</em> of the Shemoneh Esreh, which introduces individual everyday normal life (יעלה ויבא)...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Paragraph 639, regarding Yom Tov:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yet there are days which... are raised above the days of the year and should not allow life to spin along its usual course... The Divine Service, which imbues these days with their decisive significance, is definitely changed. Indeed, their task being mainly the revivifying of ideas, it is a task which must find its partial realization in <em>tefillah</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Accordingly (as expressed in paragraph 648), Yaaleh Veyavo is placed in the location which reflects the nature of the day as expressed through the prayer of that day.  On Chol Hamo'ed, which is a day characterized through the change to the <em>Avodah</em> of the day, has its Yaaleh Veyavo in the blessing of <em>Avodah</em>.  Yom Tov, on which the entire prayer is changed as a reflection of the entirely altered nature of the day, has its Yaaleh Veyavo in the central body of the prayer which reflects that nature.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Along the lines of what has been noted in the comments, the <em>Yaaleh V'Yavo</em> prayer is included in the blessing whose theme most closely matches that of the prayer itself. In the <em>Yom Tov</em> service, the middle blessing is devoted to the sanctity of the holiday itself which is directly relevant to the holiday-theme of <em>Yaaleh V'yavo</em>. However, on <em>chol hamoed</em>, when the regular <em>shemoneh esrei</em> is recited, the appropriate place for commemoration of the holy day is in the prayer for the return of the Avoda, which, at the time of the Temple, was what really defined the holidays (see, e.g., Isaiah 1:14 where the term \"<em>moadeichem</em>\" seems to be used in reference to the special <em>korbanot</em> of the holidays).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can one remove and return an oatmeal pot at a hotel free breakfast on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I understand that there is a rule that one should not remove a pot from a crockpot unit on Shabbat and return it to the unit, for he will be recooking the food.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say someone is staying at a non-Jewish hotel that serves the public a free breakfast. The food is not cooked specifically for the Jewish crowd ; it's for all hotel guests. There is a pot of oatmeal in an electric crock pot (verified that the oatmeal and the pot are both kosher.)</p>\n\n<p>Since the oatmeal is for the general public - Jews and Gentiles, is there any problem with a Jew removing the inner pot from the heater taking some oatmeal and then returning it, as the cooking is not specifically for the Jew?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As a general rule, you're allowed to return a cooking pot to the heat source on two conditions:\n1) If, at the moment you took it off, you took it off with the intention of returning it;\n2) The pot is in your hands continuously, and is never rested on anything else, until you return it.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have a source for this, but that's the halacha as I've always learned it. I'd wager that there's a third condition that it can't cool down all the way, but if you're carrying the pot for that long you have bigger problems :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The answer is, that first of all there is no difference between doing a melocho for a jew or for a non jew.\nNow, this is a classic case of a sugya called chazara.\nIn order to be able to return something to its heat source, you need 3 conditions that are known as \"Tenoi Chazara\".\nThey are, that the pot must still be in your hand, AND that you had intent to return it to the heat source, AND that you didnt put it on the ground.\nALSO the heat source must be \"Garuf V'katom\", which means that the coals are either covered with dirt or swept out of the oven, to make sure that you wont stoke the coals.\nNow regarding our electrical appliances nowadays, you must have the heat source covered. The most practical cover is to line the crock pot with silver foil.\nRegarding sfardim, R' Ovadia Yosef held that a hot plate is intrinsically Garuf V'katum. But i dont know if he held the same for a crock pot. Could be yes, i just dont know.\nALSO, all these things are issurei d'rabbonon. BUT YOU CANNOT FORGET ABOUT THE ISSUREI D'ORAYSA'S\nMeaning that if the oatmeal is liquidy, and it cooled down, you MAY NOT put it back because that is going to be \"bishul acher bishul on a liquid\".</p>\n\n<p>All that was in regards to putting it back, assuming that you were allowed to eat it to begin with. Now comes the problem of Amira L'akum.\nIf the non jew cooked it for you, then you were not allowed to eat it to begin with.\nIf it was cooked for the non jews, then you have to take into account how many jews were there, because if he added any for the jews, that is problematic</p>\n\n\n",

That works out in the Hebrew Calendar (other than the fact than 1939 is a rather arbitrary start date for a prediction of this nature since it is a post-hoc political view of when the war started) because September 1 1939 is in Elul 5699. Add 75 years from there, then you are in 5774 - last year.</p>\n\n<p>There are other problems, such as not counting WWII from Germany's annexation of Austria, a year earlier. You could then count WWI from the Second Balkan War (also a year earlier - it motivated the famous assassination), which more firmly puts this date in the past, but I think the above math problem makes the prediction tenuous at best at this point.</p>\n\n\n",

Prof. Yosef Patrich <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/44092217?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">divides</a> the Second Temple period into four stages per versions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The original version, built in the Persian period.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The renovations of the outer part of the Temple by Shimon Hatzaddik (per <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ben_Sira.50.1-4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer ben Sira 50:1-4</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The renovations of the Chashmonaim period. Most significantly, they widened the Temple Mount to the size of 500 square cubits.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Herodian renovations.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'll assume you mean the original version from the Persian era. Naturally, being that we don't have enough information on it, there are disagreements, so further note that all of the following is very hypothetical based on the limited information we have available:</p>\n<p>Prof. Leen Ritmeyer <a href=\"https://www.ritmeyer.com/2021/01/21/the-jerusalem-temple-on-mount-gerizim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thought</a> the hechal at the time of Nechemiah looked like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kBHD8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kBHD8.png\" alt=\"hechal/sanctuary per Leen Ritmeyer\" /></a></p>\n<p>In terms of measurements, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezra.6.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezra 6:3</a> is very clear that it was 60 cubits high and 60 cubits wide. The length is not mentioned. I do not know based on what Ritmeyer determined the length. Rambam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Chosen_Temple.1.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrote</a> that the Temple was built as a combination of the First Temple and Yechezkel's Temple-vision. According to Daat Mikra on Ezra 6:3, footnote 16, this would mean that the Second Temple's hechal's length was 20 cubits. It seems Ritmeyer thought the <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%91%D7%94_(%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%A9)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mesiba</a> that surrounded the hechal was built by Herod. Patrich <a href=\"https://www.ybz.org.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/Article_42.3.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">appears to concur</a>; contemporary architecture seems to prove this (i.e., mesibot as features in pagan temples were common in the Herodian period). I don't understand the length of Ritmeyer's ulam (entrance hall/porch). According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Middot.4.7?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Middot</a>, in the Second Temple it was 100 cubits, while in the First one it was 20 cubits (equal to the length of the rest of the hechal; i.e., there weren't parts that stuck out/were wider than the rest of the hechal).</p>\n<p>In terms of the outer court, Ritmeyer thought it looked like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4IVoA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4IVoA.png\" alt=\"Nechemiah's Temple Mount according to Ritmeyer\" /></a></p>\n<p>Ritmeyer assumes that from the onset of the Second Temple, the Mount was 500 square cubits. However, Patrich <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44092083.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_phrase_search%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3Afc2669650e2bf49d40ba91e9d41bb64c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pointed out</a> that it is highly doubtful that Koresh would have authorized the building of such a huge site. Its <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Middot.2.1?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">size of 500 square cubits</a> would have been from Shimon Hatzaddik's time or from the Chashmonaim period. In Ezra's time the Mount would have been significantly smaller.</p>\n<p>If I may, I also find the locations of Ritmeyer's leshachot (chambers) problematic. He puts them at the edge of the wall that surrounds the Temple Mount. The mentions of the leshachot in Ezra and Nechemiah seem to suggest that they were at least part of one of the courts of the Temple itself and not simply on the edges of the Mount. This seems most evident by the mention of what eventually became Tuvia's lishkah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Nehemiah.13.4-9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nechemiah 13:4-9</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Earlier, the priest Eliashib, a relative of Tobiah, who had been appointed over the rooms in the House of our God, had assigned to hima a large room where they used to store the meal offering, the frankincense, the equipment, the tithes of grain, wine, and oil, the dues of the Levites, singers and gatekeepers, and the gifts for the priests...When I arrived in Jerusalem, I learned of the outrage perpetrated by Eliashib on behalf of Tobiah in assigning him a room in the courts of the House of God. I was greatly displeased, and had all the household gear of Tobiah thrown out of the room. I gave orders to purify the rooms, and had the equipment of the House of God and the meal offering and the frankincense put back.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Hebrew it seems that Elyashiv had taken over a lishkah that had once held tithes of grain, along with some of the vessels of the Temple. Putting it at the edge of the Temple Mount does not seem to make sense. Moreover, the phrase \"לעשות לו נשכה\" seems to suggest that the lishkah was built then. It then says \"בחצרי בית האלוקים\" - \"courts\" in plural. To me it sounds as though we are talking about a lishkah that existed in the inner court and was then renovated for Tuvia, causing it to spill out into the outer court - thus making it within both of the courts (בחצרי).</p>\n<p>Here's my suggestion for where the leshachot might have been located:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mdzmE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mdzmE.png\" alt=\"my suggestion for the location of the chambers\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Nehemiah.3.30?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lishkat Meshulam</a> in the edge of the outer court is per Prof. Chanan Eshel's essay on Yerushalayim in the time of Nechemiah, pg. 334. Don't mind the nonexistent distance between the Western side of the Birah and the back of the hechal. The design is mainly for the proportions and locations of everything.</p>\n<p>Here's another possibility:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/brn9j.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/brn9j.png\" alt=\"second option for location of chambers\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is of course highly hypothetical. Even if the general design is correct, the location of the different leshachot could vary, and there may have even be some that we are not aware of, having not been mentioned in the text. I reasoned there were four for the following reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>A chamber of Yehochanan ben Elyashiv is explicitly mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezra.10.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezra 10:6</a>. I surmised that this chamber would have been on the side close to Yerushalayim because it seems that Ezra lamenting the nation in that chamber was a sight at least partially visible.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A chamber for vessels of the Temple - per <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Nehemiah.10.40?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nechemiah 10:40</a> where the vessels are mentioned, as opposed to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Nehemiah.13.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 13:5</a> where they are not.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A chamber for tithes given to Tuvia and evidently enlarged - see above. I think it makes sense that Tuvia would be given a chamber closer to the city - both easier to reach and safer.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Chambers for tithes are mentioned in plural in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Nehemiah.10.38?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nechemiah 10:38</a>. As there were at least two chambers for tithes, it is probable that they weren't close to one another - should a fire burn down one, at least the other has a good chance of being saved.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hope this helps for getting at least a partial picture of what the Second Temple looked like originally.</p>\n\n\n",

He was asked whether it is permitted to vote in the Israeli elections, The Steipler responds that “I don't understand the position of the Satmar Rebbe, though I agree with all that was written in his book...nonetheless the people have returned, it is a fact that the people have come back, it is now a reality and therefore whether it was done correctly doesn't matter, thus now one must vote in order to ensure the safety of Klal Yisrael...”. and in other letters he writes that all throughout Jewish history Jews were part of the Gentile governments in Europe and of course if one could be in a goyish government he can be in the Jewish government, but nonetheless says the Steipler that one must be very careful that being part of parliament or government is not about getting money, even for the Jews, rather it is about upholding Jewish law. </p>\n\n<p>This letter of the Steipler is very indicative of viewpoint of the Agudas Yisroel/Degel Hatorah party (The Steipler was considered one of the leaders of the party along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elazar_Shach?wprov=sfti1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Schach</a>). They agree in principle with the basic arguments of the Satmar Rebbe, but also take the pragmatic view that the state is a reality and arguing whether it was established in sin is not important anymore.

Now we must deal with it and join it to better and further Torah and mitzvos. </p>\n\n<p>For further reading I suggest the book <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0226705781\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Messianism, Zionism, and Jewish Radicalism by Aviezer Ravitzky</a>. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I will limit my answer to the first oath  שלא יעלו בחומה- \"they shall not go up by a wall\". All, if not most of the commentators interpret this phrase in a manner that makes the oath <em>irrelevant</em> in regards to Zionism. The general gist of these interpretations is that the oath is only violated when an armed force and/or most of the nation immigrates into the Land. (See the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Oaths\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia article</a> for comprehensive citations of these commentators.) Immigration into Israel never reached the numbers necessary to violate the oath, nor was there any armed invasion.</p>\n\n<p>Those who interpret the oath more broadly to include Zionism do so against a consensus that has developed over the centuries. (Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum insisted that the oath could be violated by any large group of immigrants, but does not cite a single source that states this <em>explicitly.</em> His argument for a broader definition is based on <em>inference</em> rather than clear unambiguous citations. Even he is forced to admit that Maimonides holds that oath is limited to an immigration of the majority of the nation.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It is not a Chassidic-Misnagdic issue at all. Far from it. Satmar is Chassidic and Neturei Karta are not. They base much, or perhaps some, of their ideology on the Brisker Rav z\"l. </p>\n\n<p>The typical, mainstream, approach is simply not to be busy about whether or not they were allowed to fight for a state, but rather to focus on what to do going forward. You can find this attitude in the קריינא דאיגרתא of the Steipler Gaon. The idea of the state being a bad entity because of the Shalosh Shvuos, is unique to Satmar and Naturei Karta. </p>\n\n<p>Since most Chassidim and the Litvishe don't have a dogmatic view on this topic, there is a wide range of personal views. Also, lack of discussion back home leads to acceptance of the louder view, being that it doesn't have much competition in the Frum/Heimish/Chareidi crowd. I am noticing this phenomenon taking place recently.</p>\n\n\n",

Menahem HaMeiri the definition of l'shon hara, is speech that is meant to be defamatory or hurtful. Thus, statements of a negative nature that are said for a positive reason (in this case the improvement of health and possibly the preservation of life in the context of mental health therapy), and not to hurt others, are permissible since by definition they are not <em>l'shon hara</em>. These are his words in is Hibbur HaTeshuva (Meshiv Nefesh I:4):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עקר לשון הרע הוא המתמיד לספר בגנות האחרים ויתן דפי בענינים או שילעג להם למעוט הצלחתם...ומעין זה מי שילעיג על חבריו למעוט השגתם בידיעה...<strong>לכונת לעג וליצנות</strong>...<strong>וכלל הדברים כל אשר יתן מום באדם...ללא כונת ענין נבחר הוא ענין לשון הרע</strong>...<strong>שאין לספר במומי בני האדם על דרך לעג וליצנות, אם לא יעשה כן...לאיזו כונה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The archetypal <em>l'shon hara</em> is one who frequently relates embarrassing things about others, and adds falsehood to what he says, or he defames them on their lack of success...And similarly one who defames his fellows on their lack of intellect for the purpose of defamation and mockery...The rule is that anyone who ascribes a fault to others...without some specific intent is <em>l'shon hara</em>...For one should not relate the faults of others in context of defamation and mockery, unless he is speaking for some purpose. (Translation my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So while you should always use your judgement as to the most effective way to help yourself, while minimising any damaging effects of one's behaviours, it does not appear that that speaking to a therapist for the purpose of therapy could qualify as <em>l'shon hara</em> according to the Meiri.</p>\n\n<p>This also appears to be the opinion of this is also the opinion of R. Elhanan Wasserman, who generalises this to all interpersonal mitsvot. He writes in Kovets Ha’arot (Yevamot: 70):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולולי דבריהם היה נראה, דכל האיסורין שבין אדם לחבירו אינן איסורין אלא דרך קילקול והשחתה שלא לצורך... \n  וכן בלאו דלא תלך רכיל, מותר לספר לה\"ר על בעלי מחלוקת כדי להשקיט המריבה. וכן בלאו דאונאת דברים... \n  ומוכח מכ\"ז, דכל האיסורין האלו הותרו לצורך תועלת  </p>\n  \n  <p>If not for their words, it would appear that all interpersonal prohibitions, are only forbidden in the context of degrading and tarnishing others for no purpose...And so too with the prohibition of gossiping, it is permitted to tell <em>l'shon hara</em> on disputants to quell the dispute...And similarly with the prohibition of <em>onaat d'varim</em> [verbal abuse]...And it is evident from all this that all of these prohibition are permitted to achieve an end. (Trans. my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Importantly, they do not attach conditions to <em>to'elet</em>, as the Haffets Hayyim famously does.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the eminent modern day halakhic authority, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osher_Weiss\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Asher Weiss</a> Shlit\"a writes in Minhat Asher to Leviticus (p. 268) that to'elet renders speech permissible and not l'shon hara, by definition.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>באיסורי תורה צריך לדון בדיני דחיה האם תועלת זו ראויה לדחות איסור ...אבל בהלכות לשה\"ר לאו מדין דחיה אתינן עלה, אלא יסוד האיסור תלוי במדה רעה וכל שכונתו לטובה...ולא לרעתו אין בזה עבירה כלל, ודו\"ק בכ\"ז כי לענ\"ד ברור הוא</p>\n  \n  <p>With Torah prohibitions one must evaluate with the laws of <em>dehiya</em> [prioritisation], whether this <em>to'elet</em> [purpose] is sufficient to supersede a prohibition. But with the laws of <em>l'shon hara</em>, we are not utilising the law of supercession. Rather, the very definition of the prohibition depends on negative character traits, and anything in which his intent is for good...and not for someone else's harm, has no prohibition whatsoever, and consider all of this, for in my humble opinion, it is clear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He shows that this is the opinion of Rashi (Moed Katan 16a s.v. amar lei la'avuha) and sharply disputes (p. 267) the Hafets Hayyim's attempt at escaping the implication of Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך בחפץ חיים...כתב...ודבריו קשים לכאו' דמלבד שאין הדברים מתיישבים בלשון רש\"י</p>\n  \n  <p>However in Haffets Hayyim...he wrote...and his words appear difficult, for besides for the fact that his words don't fit with Rashi's wording...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[Like R. Elhanan, he connects this to the idea that interpersonal mitsvot in general are by definition only prohibited when they are malicious. (In particular he connects this to the prohibition of overcharging, see p. 267)].</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, he clarifies (p. 267) that there are limits to the limitation of <em>l'shon hara</em> to cases of malicious intent:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דשאני המספר לשה\"ר דרך קלות ראש דהרי פושע גמור ובזה ודאי עובר בחטא כיון שהדברים מצד עצמם הם לשה\"ר גמור ובדרך שחוק וקלות ראש מנבל הוא את פיו בכה\"ג פושע הוא אף שלא התכוין להרע לחבירו</p>\n  \n  <p>For it is different if a person speaks <em>l'shon hara</em> with frivolity, since the matters are intrinsically <em>l'shon hara</em> and in the context of frivolity and levity, he pollutes his mouth. In such a case, he is a willful sinner even though he didn't intent to harm his fellow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is: \"I was just having a good time\", isn't a legitimate excuse to speak disparagingly about someone. However, by all indications, speaking when there is some specific purpose, such as speaking to a therapist, would be fine.</p>\n\n<p>This is stated by R. David Cohen Shlit\"a as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This to my mind [is similar to\n  when] the poskim speak about lashon harah l’toeles [for a helpful purpose], which is not limited to loshan\n  harah. Any [transgression of] bein adam l’chaveiro [when it is] l’toeles is mutar (cited <a href=\"http://drsorotzkin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eng-honoring-abusive-parents.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, page 7)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

A summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The blessing for understanding is after the blessing of G-d's sanctity based on the verse והקדישו את קדוש יעקב ואת אלהי ישראל יעריצו (sanctity) being juxtoposed with  וידעו תועי רוח בינה (understanding).</p>\n<p>The blessing for repentance is based on the verse ולבבו יבין ושב ורפא לו (understanding followed by repentance).</p>\n<p>The blessing for forgiveness follows repentance based on the verse וישוב אל ה' וירחמהו ואל אלהינו כי ירבה לסלוח (repentance followed by forgiveness).</p>\n<p>The blessing for redemption follows that of forgiveness in order that redemption be the 7th blessing, as redemption will begin in the 7th year (of a <em>shemitta</em> cycle).</p>\n<p>The blessing for healing follows in order that it be 8th, as <em>bris mila</em>, which requires healing, is on the 8th day.</p>\n<p>The blessing for sustenance follows in order that it be 9th, as it corresponds to King David's prayer to foil the attempts of those who inflate prices in the markets, which King David did in the 9th chapter of Tehillim.</p>\n<p>The blessing for ingathering the exiles follows that of sustenance as per the verse ואתם הרי ישראל ענפכם תתנו ופריכם תשאו לעמי ישראל כי קרבו לבוא.</p>\n<p>The blessing for justice follows, as once the exiles are gathered in, justice will be reinstated, as per the juxtaposition of the verses אשיבה ידי עליך ואצרוף כבור סיגיך and ואשיבה שופטיך כבראשונה.</p>\n<p>The blessing for the end of evil follows, as once justice is reinstated, evildoers will cease, as the verse two after the above verses is ושבר פושעים וחטאים יחדיו.</p>\n<p>The blessing for the righteous follows, as once evil is vanquished, the righteous will be uplifted, based on the verse וכל קרני רשעים אגדע תרוממנה קרנות צדיק.</p>\n<p>This will center around Yerushalayim, based on the verse שאלו שלום ירושלם ישליו אוהביך, and therefore the blessing for rebuilding Yerushalayim follows.</p>\n<p>The blessing for the emergence of Moshiach follows, as after Yerushalayim is reestablished, Moshiach will come, as the verse says אחר ישובו בני ישראל ובקשו את ה' אלהיהם ואת דוד מלכם.</p>\n<p>Once Moshiach comes, prayer will be heard, as the verse says והביאותים אל הר קדשי ושמחתים בבית תפלתי, and therefore the blessing for listening to prayer follows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That takes us through the requests.</p>\n<p>Some Rishonim give other explanations for some of the blessings.  The Seder HaYom, for example, explains that redemption precedes health, and health precedes sustenance, as that is the order of prevalence of the needs - one cannot be concerned about the relatively long-term concern of their health when they are in imminent danger, and one cannot be concerned about their livelihood when their very life is not on certain footing.</p>\n\n\n",

Sexual relationship is prohibited and punished by Karet. Touching  is not prohibited by itself, but as a guard rail, distancing between spouses in prohibited period are rabbinic. A problem of touching Nidda exists regarding to Tum'a and Tahara but is not included in the scope of the question. But a married woman (Eshet Ish, prohibited because married), even if clean from a nidda point of view, is not allowed to touch, e.g. shaking hand, rabbinicly (at least) because her status of Eshet Ish.<br>\n<strong>See Sefer Hachinuch 188:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>שלא</strong> להתעדן [נתעדן] באחת מכל העריות. והן קרובות ואשת איש ונדה, ואפילו בלא ביאה כגון חבוק ונשוק וכל הדומה לאלו הפעלות הרעות שמעמיקין בהן בעלי הזמה ההולכים אחרי ההבל ויהבלו, שנאמר (ויקרא יח ו) איש איש אל כל שאר בשרו לא תקרבו לגלות ערוה. ופרשו, כאלו אמר לא תעשה שום קריבה שהיא הגורמת והמביאה האדם לגלות ערוה. וכן דרשו זכרונם לברכה (ספרא אחרי יג טו וכא) לא תקרבו לגלות, אין לי אלא שלא יגלה מנין שלא יקרב? תלמוד לומר ואל אשה בנדת טמאתה לא תקרב, אין לי אלא נדה בבל [תקרב ובל] תגלה, מנין לכל העריות? תלמוד לומר לא תקרבו לגלות, ושם נאמר (שם כט) ונכרתו הנפשות העושות, שמא תאמר יהיו חיבים כרת על הקריבה לבד? תלמוד לומר העושות ולא הקרבות. ‏<br> It's prohibited to have a \"pleasant contact\" with a prohibited one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונוהגת בכל מקום ובכל זמן בזכרים ונקבות,‏<br>\nThis Mitsva apply equally for men and women.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>halachic reason that a Jewish woman could not touch a non-Jewish man? </code></p>\n<p><strong>--> Yes,</strong> here is the source.</p>\n<p>If we read the text in Sefer Hachinuch and poskim, accurately, shaking hands is a gesture of rapprochement. The Sefer Chassidim quoted by hazoriz is congruent whit Ramban ((On Rambam, Sefer Hamitsvot LT, 353; Ramban in his \"objections\" disagreed with the fact that there is a Scriptural prohibition, but agrees with this rule as rabbinic.).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>halachic reason that a Jewish woman could not touch a non-Jewish man? </code>\n--> Prohibition to marry is scriptural, and regards women as men, so it is prohibited (lechaora)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>I am referring to non-affectionate touch, such as sitting next to someone or passing</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>--> A non-affectionate touch is out of the spectrum of the prohibition above addressed.</p>\n<p>###Sifra Debe Rav\nThe Chinuch above cited (almost an excerp from Rambam) quoted a Berayta from Torat Qohanim. The famous discussion which is being held between Rambam and Ramban is surrounding this Berayta:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‏ פרק יג\n[יח,ו]\n(א) איש -\nמה תלמוד לומר איש איש?\nלהביא את הגוים שיהיו מוזהרים על העריות כישראל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>לא תקרבו -\nמה תלמוד לומר?\nלפי שנאמר: איש איש שיכול אין לי אלא איש ממש שהוא מוזהר על ידי אשה, אשה מוזהרת על ידי איש מנין?\nתלמוד לומר: לא תקרבו הרי כאן שנים.</p>\n<p>[יח, יט]\n(ב) ואל אשה בנידת טומאתה לא תקרב לגלות ערותה -\nאין לי אלא שלא יגלה מנין שלא תקרב? תלמוד לומר לא תקרב אין לי אלא נידה בל תקרב בל תגלה. מנין לכל העריות בל תקרבו ובל תגלו. תלמוד לומר לא תקרבו לגלות. אני ה' אני נאמרן לשלם שכר.\n‏\n\"Don't go too near\"(plural form) what is the meaning? A warning not only for men but also for women.</p>\n<p>In the Torat Qohanim (Sifra) we see comparison between rules concerning Nidda relationship prohibition and rules concerning all Arayot. The sifra makes equivalence with each other. <br></p>\n<h3>\nPoskim\n</h3>\nSee Bet Yosef YD 195. He explains that the  distancing must be greater with his wife Niddah because of a greater facilitation to engage relationship. The difference between nidda-wife and Eshet Ish concerning the touching problem is not qualitative, but quantitative. __Exemple given, to check pulse is Negia Bealma (a simple touching) with an other prohibited women and is allowed for a physician, but with his own wife Niddah, this can lead to greater rapprochement and is prohibited. So it is prohibited scripturaly according to Rambam (following the Bet Yosef understanding. Shach 157 sk 10 disagree with this explanation in Rambam).__ <br>\n<p>Rabenu Yona agrees with the Rambam opinion (following Bet Yosef) that to get closer to nidda is a case of Yehareg Veal Yaavor (let him be killed and do not infringe). Rabenu Yona's opinion is based on 2 premises which are specific to him. 1.- The rule of Yehareg Veal yaavor is for all women with which the intercourse is punishable of Kareth (as Ran in Chidushin Sanhedrin 74a), including Niddah. 2.- There is Yehareg Veal Yaavor with Kirva (to get closer) as we see in Gemara with Nathan Tsutsita (Sanhedrin 75a, Gemara explains that Chachamim do not allow to this man to look a women {2 opinions in Gemara if Eshet Ish (married) or celibate, anyways all opinions ruled this Gemara concerning Eshet Ish (אין מתרפאים באביזריהו דעריות)} even if he can die if he do not see him.<br>.\nMost poskim did not follow R.Y. in neither premises: concerning Yehareg, no Yehareg for Niddah (because Kiddushin Tofsim, some can marry a Niddah woman),  and not concerning this kind of kirva (Shach in 195, 20 and 157, 10 learn in Rambam a touching clearly sexually oriented, even if the woman is his wife).To get closer but not explicitly sexually oriented.<br>\nWe already said that the Shach <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5093\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 157, sk 10</a>, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5538\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 195, 20</a> said that the kirva prohibited scripturaly for Rambam is only when sexually oriented. <br></p>\n<h3>\n<p>Kinds of physical contact</p>\n</h3>\n<p>There are 4 degrees of touching. 1.- without rapprochement. 2.- without intrinsec rapprochement but between husband and wife. 3.- with no sexually oriented rapprochement. 4. with sexually oriented rapprochement.</p>\n<h3>\nShaking hand\n</h3>\nHand shaking is the 3rd degree . Following the Shach it is prohibited Rabbinicly for a prohibited woman,  Rambam ruled scriptural prohibition. For Ramban rabbinic. For Rabenu Yona scriptural and may be Yehareg Veal Yaavor. The sefer Chassidim seems to think that it is rabbinic. A Jewish woman is prohibited to shake hand to a non-Jewish man.\n<h3>Shaking hands with gloves, without gloves</h3>\nSee Yerushalmi Sota 3, 1:\n>וכהן מניח את ידו תחתיה ומניפה.  ואין הדבר כאור.  מביא מפה.  ואינו חוצץ.  ומביא כהן זקן אפי' תימר ילד שאין יצר הרע מצוי לשעה.‏\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Cohen puts his hand under hers and swings it. Is this not improper (hideous, according to Soncino's translation in Chulin)? He brings a towel. Is it not a \"barrier\". He brings an old Cohen, maybe even a young because the Yetser is not frequent for a very short time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A separation between skins make the contact not hideous, may be the brevity, or the old age of the man too.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2192&st=&pgnum=30&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Chassidim Nussach Parma</a> 1266 (תתתסו) The commentary (I learned the Yerushalmi above from it) says that Sefer Chassidim prohibit only when the shaking of hands has a symbolic meaning of contract, because it seems as a concluding contract about sexual relationship. So he does not prohibit, so shaking hand with glove to greet persons of different gender may be allowed, at least with glove, according this author (but it is very impolite to shake hand with glove in France!).</p>\n<p>Finally there is shaking and shaking. may be that a very fast and formal shaking is not rapprochement. But almost sure that it is. <strong>There is at least a Rabbinic prohibition. Chachamim said (Chulin 44b) \"but the Sages have said: 'Keep aloof from anything hideous or from whatever <code>seems</code> hideous'!\"</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This one's pretty straightforward -- relations are prohibited (at least at the rabbinic level) with all non-Jews. Therefore, we apply the concept of \"don't <em>come close</em> to a forbidden relation\", which prohibits affectionate touching according to all, and non-affectionate touching according to some.</p>\n\n\n",

As already noted by <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=17708&rid=620\" rel=\"nofollow\">Divrei Yirmiyahu</a>, the Rambam implies that the concept of \"tefillat ha-tzibbur\" relates not to the silent tefillah of individuals praying simultaneously, but to the prayer of the sheliach tzibbur. Divrei Yirmiyahu also notes that the Rambam instituted in Egypt that the congregation should always pray along silently with the chazzan, which is in accordance with his view that the prayer of the chazzan is what creates tefillat ha-tzibbur. Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik explained (<em>Siddur Mesorat HaRav</em>, p. 1212): \"The individual, no matter how righteous, has no right to claim anything from God; God owes the individual nothing... The <em>shaliah tzibbur</em> on the other hand, prays on hehalf of the entire congregation...\" R. Shternbuch, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19963&st=&pgnum=32&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mo'adim u-Zemanim, vol. 1</a>, likewise notes the Rambam's position, according to which the primary \"communal prayer\" is the prayer of the chazzan. </p>\n\n<p>R. Herschel Schachter, Nefesh HaRav, p. 126, records the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונראה דחובת הציבור להתפלל \"תפילת הצבור\" אין זה רק בכדי שיצאו ידי חובת\n  קדושה, דאפילו אמר החזן \"א הויכע קדושה\", ושוב התפללו כולם בלחש,\n  מתחייבים שוב לראות שהש\"ץ יחזור על התפילה בקול רם. ועי' רמ\"א לסי' קכ\"ד\n  ס\"ב, שכשיש שעת הדחק ואין פנאי להש\"ץ לחזור על התפילה ומתפללים \"א הויכע\n  קדושה\", שהצבור מתפללים עמו מלה במלה בלחש עד לאחר הקל הקדוש. [ועיי\"ש\n  במשנה ברורה סק\"ח, שאם אין השעה דחוקה כ\"כ, שלא יתחילו הצבור רק לאחר\n  שאמר הש\"ץ הקל הקדוש. ועיי\"ש בכף החיים שדעת כמה אחרונים אינה כן.] ונראה\n  לבאר בדעת הרמ\"א, שמן הנכון לומר קדושה באמצע השמונה עשרה שלו, ובשלמא\n  כשיש חזרת ש\"ץ והיא נחשבת כתפילת הצבור, והיא מצטרפת לכל המנין, וחשיב\n  כאילו כולם ביחד הגישו תפילה אחת להקב\"ה, דוגמת ציבור המגישים קרבן ציבור\n  אחד בעד כולם, הרי נמצא שאמרו קדושה באמצע \"תפילת הצבור\" שלהם. אך בשעת\n  הדחק שאומרים רק \"א הויכע קדושה\", בכדי שתהיה הקדושה באמצע השמונה עשרה\n  שלהם, בעינן בדוקא שיתחילו כולם להתפלל מלה במלה עם הש\"ץ, <strong>וכן נהג\n  רבנו</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Schachter argues that Kedushah is supposed to be recited during Shemoneh Esreh. In a case where the chazzan recites chazarat ha-shatz in full, the tzibbur recites kedushah in the middle of Shemoneh Esreh through the \"tefillat ha-tzibbur\" of the chazzan. But in a case of \"a heiche kedushah,\" the tzibbur should pray along with the chazzan for the first three berachot in order to have kedushah during the Shemoneh Esreh. R. Schachter records that this was in fact the practice of R. Joseph B. Soloveitchik (in accordance with the Kaf ha-Chaim, and against the Mishnah Berurah). </p>\n\n<p>Although R. Moshe Feinstein, (Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chaim 3:9), maintains that praying with the chazzan does not constitute <em>tefillah be-tzibbur</em>, it seems that most acharonim argue, (as enumerated in Piskei Teshuvot, 90:14 note 175), based on the aforementioned Rambam. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/59725/21\">As stated by Einbert</a>, there is textual support to this practice; the thinking behind it is pretty straightforward -- the Gemara says the original point of having a Chazzan's repetition is for those who didn't know the text: they could follow along quietly with the Chazzan and thus fulfil their obligation to pray. </p>\n\n<p>Briskers would therefore tell you that if I follow along with the Chazzan, I'm following the original version of that practice; whereas listen-silently-to-some-and-then-say-everything-my-self is a hybrid not found in the Gemara.</p>\n\n\n",

Rashi on Psachin (page 56) explains that the book was buried since people would immediately cure any disease they had and would not repent their sins.\nThe Rambam (on his commentary on Psachim 4:10) on the other hand claims that that is a retarded explanation (his words!), since there is no problem eating when you are hungry - there should be no problem taking medicine when you are sick! So the Rambam believes that the book included supernatural cures for diseases that otherwise the sick person would die from, and it is forbidden to use such cures. So while the book was for intellectual curiosity only it was fine, but when king Chezkia saw that people were actually using it he buried it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הלכה זו היא תוספתא, אבל ראיתי לפרשה ג\"כ לפי שיש בה תועליות. ספר רפואות, היה ספר שהיה בו סדר רפואות במה שאין מן הדין להתרפות בו... ומחברו לא חברו אלא על דרך הלימוד בטבעי המציאות לא כדי להשתמש במשהו ממה שנכלל בו, וזה מותר כמו שיתבאר לך שדברים שהזהיר ה' מלעשותם מותר ללמדם ולדעת אותם, כי ה' אמר לא תלמד לעשות ובא בקבלה אבל אתה למד להבין ולהורות. וכאשר קלקלו בני אדם ונתרפאו בו גנזו. ואפשר שהיה ספר שיש בו הרכבת סמים המזיקין כגון סם פלוני מרכיבין אותו כך, ומשקין אותו כך, וגורם למחלה זו וזו, ורפואתו בכך וכך, שכשיראה הרופא אותם המחלות ידע שסם פלוני השקוהו ונותן לו דברים נגדיים שיצילוהו, וכאשר קלקלו בני אדם והיו הורגין בו גנזו. \n  ולא הארכתי לדבר בענין זה אלא מפני ששמעתי וגם פירשו לי ששלמה חבר ספר רפואות שאם חלה אדם באיזו מחלה שהיא פנה אליו ועשה כמו שהוא אומר ומתרפא, וראה חזקיה שלא היו בני אדם בוטחים בה' במחלותיהם אלא על ספר הרפואות, עמד וגנזו. ומלבד אפסות דבר זה ומה שיש בו מן ההזיות, הנה ייחסו לחזקיה ולסיעתו שהודו לו סכלות שאין ליחס דוגמתה אלא לגרועים שבהמון. ולפי דמיונם המשובש והמטופש אם רעב אדם ופנה אל הלחם ואכלו שמתרפא מאותו הצער הגדול בלי ספק, האם נאמר שהסיר בטחונו מה', והוי שוטים יאמר להם, כי כמו שאני מודה לה' בעת האוכל שהמציא לי דבר להסיר רעבוני ולהחיותני ולקיימני, כך נודה לו על שהמציא רפואה המרפאה את מחלתי כשאשתמש בה. ולא הייתי צריך לסתור פירוש זה הגרוע לולי פרסומו. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>If Hashem wanted a ready-made world with nothing left to explore, He could have just stayed with a כסא הכבוד, or better yet, הוא ושמו.

Although the prophets and Tanaim knew more Torah than we do, the Torah grew and continues to grow with the years. There is a more detailed Torah with more finite definitions that constantly come up.

The shortening of human life and diseases themselves are explicitly described as inventions of G-d created in response to man's sins. There is a medrash (Berachot 10b) that Solomon wrote a book of all medical treatments that was subsequently hidden by Hezekiah exactly for this reason - people were making use of it and avoiding repentance (see also Bereshith Rabbah 65:9). (It's probably also noteworthy that much of the innovations of the modern world, such as the shift from an agricultural society, are often blamed for, amongst other ills, the rise in the incidence of depression, suggesting that modern technology is not necessarily as desirable as one might think.)</p>\n\n\n",

The Tosafot in Masechet Avodah Zarah\n(17b) deduce from the Gemara (ibid.) that one must distance himself\neven from the entrance of a house of idol worship as much as possible.\nSimilarly, Maran Ha’Shulchan Aruch in Yoreh De’ah (Chapter 150,\nSection 1) rules that there is a Mitzvah to distance one’s self four\nAmot (approximately 6.5 feet) from a path of idol worship. Thus, if\none is walking close to a house of idol worship, such as a church, one\nshould distance himself at least four Amot from the entrance to this\nplace, for it is well-known that Christian churches are considered\nhouses of idol worship as they believe in another deity besides for\nHashem. If so, it is certainly forbidden to actually enter their\nchurches, for they are actual houses of idol worship.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=2367\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=2367</a></p>\n<p>Despite these halakhic sources, there have been Jewish communities that had the custom to enter churches to attend funerals. The chief Rabbinate and I believe Egyptian Jews in general had a custom of entering churches for funerals of Christians in Egypt. Rav Ovadia Yosef was asked to attend such a funeral in a church as the Chief Rabbi was too ill to attend himself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While Maran Rabbeinu Ovadia Yosef zt”l served as a Rabbi and Av Bet\nDin (head of the rabbinical court) in Egypt in the year 5708 (1948),\nhe also served as Assistant Chief Rabbi of Egypt. The post of Chief\nRabbi was held by a man by the name of Chaim Nachum Afandi who was\nclose to the king of Egypt, a member of the Egyptian parliament in\nCairo, and a member of the Academy of the Arabic Language, and was\nthus chosen for this position. During this period, a certain\nwell-respected Christian diplomat passed away in Egypt and the\ngovernment invited the country’s Chief Rabbi to represent the Chief\nRabbinate and participate in the funeral services. Since the Chief\nRabbi was in a weakened state, he requested that Maran zt”l attend the\nfuneral in his place. When Maran zt”l heard that it was customary for\nall to file into the church where the deceased lay and listen to\nChristian prayers and the like, he notified the Chief Rabbi that under\nno circumstances would he agree to enter the church. The Chief Rabbi\nexerted much pressure on Maran zt”l to agree to go, for if no\nrepresentative of the Chief Rabbinate would be present, this might\ncause a serious diplomatic incident to ensue. Nevertheless, Maran zt”l\ndisagreed with his stance and claimed that, on the contrary, the\nparticipation of a rabbi at such an event is an unparalleled\ndesecration of Hashem’s name and a disgrace of the Jewish religion in\nthe eyes of the non-Jewish nations. He thus remained steadfast in his\nconvictions and no representative of the Chief Rabbinate attended the\nfuneral. Note: No fall-out ever resulted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The author of this article views Rav Ovadia Yosef's actions as a win for Halakha and claims that no fall-out ever resulted. That's a large statement considered the Jews were expelled from Egypt within a decade of Ovadia Yosef serving in the Chief Rabbinate office.</p>\n\n\n",

But halachically, what is the support for the prohibition?</p>\n\n<p>I am assuming here that the marriage performed would be a civil one or a Christian marriage or something like that.</p>\n\n<p>I know that intermarriage with the seven nations is prohibited in Torah, as well as a few others, like Moabites.

Also, today the danger of avodah zarah is not as it was before - today most Westerners are either monotheists following one of the Abrahamic religions, or some variety of skeptic or apathetic. So, I would like to know the major source for the prohibition of intermarriage today, and what this source says about the consequences of such an intermarriage.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even the halachic question of who is a Jew seems to be based on rabbis parsing a verse in a strange way to say it goes by the mother. A literal reading of TaNaKh may suggest it actually goes by the father. So, what does it even mean to marry a Jew or non-Jew when the person isn't fully observant?</p>\n\n<p>In your answer, if you could also address Deuteronomy 21 which describes marrying women captured in battle, that would help clarify the matter as well, since any halachic interpretation should probably address Torah commandments that would seem to be problematic for the interpretation.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your assumption is based upon an opinion in Talmud which is not the standard accepted opinion. </p>\n\n<p>The Rambam and Shulchan Aruch codified the opinion of Rabi Shimon bar Yochai found in maseches Avoda Zara 36b stating that marriage to any nonjew is biblical, it was casual promiscuity I.e. znus which the beis din of Chashmonaim enacted their nashga/nashgaz against as a safeguard so as not to marry them.</p>\n\n<p>See Rambam chapter 12 of hilchos Issurei Biah halacha 1&2 and Shulchan Aruch Even Ha'ezer siman 16 siff 1.</p>\n\n<p>See also Aruch HaShulchan siff two who says even the other opinion who argues on the Rambam and rules that biblically only the seven nations are not allowed agrees that in a situation where the couple lives together and have continual conjugal relations, this would also be biblically prohibited.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I believe the answer to your question is amply provided by Matt in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/51153/from-where-do-we-know-that-sexual-intercourse-with-a-non-jewish-woman-is-forbidd\">the reference linked in the comments</a>, namely, that the origin of the prohibition is disputed, but it seems that, at the very least, it is a very severe rabbinic prohibition. </p>\n\n<p>I would add that rabbinic prohibitions are not (necessarily) of a lesser severity than biblical ones, and can indeed be more severe. This prohibition is a case in point since it can even be considered a capital offense, inasmuch as the Hasmoneans enacted that it is liable to 39*4=156 (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94_%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%9C%D7%95_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">נשג\"ז/נשג\"א</a>) lashes which are potentially a death sentence, inasmuch as it is also liable to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kareith</a> midivrei kabbala (from the words of the prophets), and inasmuch as it is one of the prohibitions for which the rule is <em>kana'im pog'in bo</em> (zealots are allowed to extralegally execute him). Also, the reasoning mentioned explicitly in the verse by the seven nations, namely, of the gentile spouse leading one's children astray, is applicable whenever the spouse is not keeping the commandments one needs to impart on his children. </p>\n\n<p>As far as literal readings of tanach, as noted in the 2nd footnote in the source you cite, halacha is not determined by the layman's literal reading of tanach (nor even by the expert's) and it is a central principle of Judaism that just as there is a written Torah, there is an oral one as well that came along with it.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the captor in the source you mention is halachically obligated to free the captive woman if she is not willing to undergo a full conversion.</p>\n\n<p>(Perhaps you're better bet is in convincing her to convert as well.

However, the Mogen Avrohom there (179:6) writes that this is true even when he is offered the next cup while still in the middle of the previous cup, at which point he would not have decided he is done.  Even so, he needs a new <em>beracha</em>.  The Ketzos HaShulchan (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7721&st=&pgnum=151\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:56:9</a>), based thereon (Badei HaShulchan 13 there), writes that when one makes a <em>beracha</em> with intent to only eat one fruit or two, and then subsequently decides to eat more, he must make a new <em>beracha</em>, as his <em>beracha</em> only covers that amount which he had in mind.</p>\n<p>Therefore, this idea applies even to the same food, as is the case under discussion in the Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that R' Elyashiv, cited in Zos HaBeracha 20:9, held that today this rule is not so hard and fast. We are, by nature, more wishy washy in our decisions, particularly in the area of eating.  This may be a result of two factors - the general hecticness of our lives, and the fact that it is not such a big deal for us to eat more, since we have a whole refrigerator and pantry full of food. Therefore, our decisions to only eat so much are not such substantial decisions, and are not binding.  Unless there are mitigating circumstances which force the person to make his decision to end his meal, such as a cab is waiting outside, he does not have real binding intention to end his meal.</p>\n\n\n",

He writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When a male patient is examined by a female physician <em>[and her husband is not in town - cf. below]</em>, the door may\n  <strong>not</strong> be locked from the inside.

Besides, since the women are busy\n  with their work, we need not have any suspicions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A key difference in the laws of yichud between a man being allowed to be alone with a woman, and vice-versa, is that a man is used to go around the city and therefore his wife is worried he will discover her. While a woman typically doesn't wander around and therefore her husband doesn't have this concern.

According to\n  Rabbi Chaim Vital, these First Hasidim were among the important heirs\n  to the prophetic tradition (Sha’arey Kedushah, Introduction).</p>\n  \n  <p>The Mishnah states that “the First Hasidim would linger an hour and\n  then pray.” To this, the Talmud adds that they would also wait an hour\n  after their prayers, and that the prayer itself would also take an\n  hour (Berakhot 30b). Since there were three daily prayer services,\n  they would spend a total of nine hours each day involved in such\n  devotion.</p>\n  \n  <p>There is no mention in the Talmud as to what these Hasidim did during\n  the hours before and after prayer, but the Kabbalists explain it in\n  terms of classical meditative techniques (see Sha’ar HaKavanot\n  LeMekubalim HaRishonim, p. 122). In order to place oneself in the\n  frame of mind necessary for successful deep meditation, one must sit\n  calmly beforehand, quietly building up spiritual energy. Similarly,\n  after intense meditation, one must also sit quietly, absorbing the\n  effects of ths experience. This would then clearly indicate that the\n  prayer itself was used as a type of meditation among these First\n  Hasidim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He writes that meditation was the original intent of the Rabbis when they instituted the Amida Silent prayer. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The שער רוח הקודש from Harav Chaim Vittal has many meditations.

This is understood from the line in Tehillim (147:19), \"He told His words to Yaacov and His judgements to Yisrael.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Torah teachings on the type of meditation you are referring to are extensive and are still available today. There are schools in Israel and even individuals available online who might be able to help you in this area, like for example Rabbi Ariel Bar Tzadok at koshertorah.com.</p>\n\n<p>For someone limited to English, the three books by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan are a good place to start. They are titled, \"Meditation and the Bible\", Meditation and Kabbalah\" and \"Jewish Meditation\". As memory serves, the publisher was Weiser Press and it is probably available through Amazon.</p>\n\n<p>Like is found in Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah at the beginning, each individual is required to \"know\" and \"believe\" that there is a first cause that this cause is the Creator of all.</p>\n\n<p>This \"knowing\" aspect relates to that type of meditation which is associated with individual intellectual and emotional capacity. Generally, \"knowing\" is through thought, speech and action. It also has the implication of the connection of the spiritual with the physical, material plane of existence. This is because the word \"know\" in Hebrew (da'at) also has the meaning of connection, as in Adam \"knew\" Chava.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, this is also the meaning of the word \"mitzvah\". It means \"connection\" ('tzavtah' in Hebrew, as found in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16093&st=&pgnum=119\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likkutei Torah, parshat Bechukotai 55:3</a>). In other words, G-d's immanence in all aspects of creation, that there is no \"place\" devoid of \"Him\".</p>\n\n<p>The \"belief\" aspect is associated with that type of meditation which transcends the finite qualities of ones self, meaning relating to the innermost aspect of soul or what the Torah says is \"a piece of G-d above\" (in Hebrew, 'chelek Elokah Mi'Me'al).</p>\n\n<p>The daily requirement in halacha for meditation is associated with the recital of the Shema (Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chaim 60:5, 61:1, 63:5, 183:5). Minimally, the first two lines of Shema are to be said with \"intention\" morning and evening. What each individuals capacity is to fulfill that varies. But the intended meaning is that for someone with greater capacity, they are to meditate much more deeply. What is expected from a child is different from an adult and each and every individual is according to how they have been measured \"Above\".</p>\n\n<p>And that is only the starting place. There are specific visualizations, and breathing patterns, what could be described as 'mantras', and even postures. Each enables greater connection, called \"devekut\" with the Creator.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, lifestyle impacts ones effectiveness in meditation. The commandments one fulfills, what one eats, level of ritual \"purity\", types of clothing and the varying times of day, month and year impact on meditation. Geographic location also has its impact, beneficially or not. In other words, some things make the connection with the Creator more effective and are more conducive to the process, while others hinder. But it is important to keep in mind that these details only relate to that aspect of meditation which is associated with the finite, \"knowing\" side of the process.</p>\n\n<p>To really open the door to this  side of Jewish life requires learning Hebrew. It is the keys to the Kingdom and the foundation upon which everything is built. The written sources in Hebrew are extensive and show an uninterrupted tradition going back for 5775 years, all the way to the first \"book\" given to Adam HaRishon called \"Sefer Raziel HaMalach\" or \"Sefer Toldot Adam HaRishon\".</p>\n\n\n",

In modern terms, principals in the Tora relate \"Antisemitism\" to a \"secular\" approach by Yisrael. The Tora determines that Mitzvos are mandatory and that in case they are not observed, a punishment in the form of harassments and even war by neighboring nations may be upheld against the Jews, or exile and subsequent pogroms while at exile.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the strongest of the terrifying examples in the Tora is the out front warning in Parashas Bechukotai (Vayikra ch. 26) \"And if you will not listen to me and avoid those Mitzvos ... (וְאִם לֹא תִשְׁמְעוּ לִי וְלֹא תַעֲשׂוּ אֵת כָּל הַמִּצְו‍ֹת הָאֵלֶּה)...\nAnd you will fall before you enemies (וְנִגַּפְתֶּם לִפְנֵי אֹיְבֵיכֶם) ...

For the rest of us, the tradition is to spell it daleth, דלת. Now, according to scholars, and many older Middle Eastern Jewish communities, the sounds of ד and ת without dageshim are very closely related. They are made in the same place of the mouth, except one is voiced and one is not. In other words.</p>\n\n<p>Think of the English word \"the,\" say it to yourself and take note of how you pronounce the \"th,\" that is the sound that many communities used to pronounce ד.</p>\n\n<p>Think of the English word \"theft,\" say it to yourself and take note of how you pronounce the \"th,\" that is the sound that many communities used to pronounce ת. </p>\n\n<p>And so when you have sounds that sound similar, some trail off, some replace others. And once people are used to spelling it this other way, then that way stays. So they were probably originally spelling it דלד with the daledh at the end being pronounced like the th in \"the\" and then once that sound was lost, they were left with the spelling of דלד and are now pronouncing it as a hard d sound.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, many linguists claim that the more common Ashkenazic mispronunciation of the name of the letter ת is due to this same reason. The name of the letter ת is spelled תו.  But since many Ashkenazim pronounce their v's and f's in the same place in their mouths (like the example above) but the v is vocalized and the f is not (like the example above) they mispronounce תו and pronounce it תף. i remember a Chabadnik getting into an argument over this issue as he claimed the letter was spelled תף and the only way to get the argument to end was to grab the Chabad siddur which as the letters spelled out in the first few pages to show him that it was spelled תו.</p>\n\n\n",

Resh with dagesh might be a scribal tradition.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Answer 3b.</strong>\nDagesh Hazak is not generally admitted by the (אהחע''ר). But it could be that dagesh Qal is admited. That is my understanding and what I remember. The problem is that I know of a contradiction: Alef with a dagesh; as in Bereshith 43:27 and Waikra 23:17.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Answer 4 from EmLaMikra -Rav Nisan Sharoni:</strong>\nIn the book Em laMikra haShalem written by Nisan Sharoni In Chapter 14 of the Ashdod edition are presented the laws of Dagesh Kal and Hazak and their differences.\nספר אם למקרא השׁלם על ידי ניסן שׁרוני ׀ אשׁדוֹד ׀ תשׁס״א ׀ עמוד  62)</p>\n<p>In the 7 article of the chapter, the Rav says that the letters ״אהחער״  typically do not take a dagesh.\n₪ בּאוֹתיוֹת ״אהחער״ ־לֹא יָבֹא דָגֵשׁ, בְּדֶרֶךְ כְּלָל.   ₪ מכלול נז</p>\n<p>In the footnote 6 — Not to write it in Hebrew — ; it says: Except in a few cases where there is an exception to the rule… dagesh can be seen in Alef and Reish. See Mesorah haGedolah 43:26 and מכלול נז  Minchas Shai 43:26.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Thus, as a sum of the above:</strong>\nA) Rresh with dagesh can be a different phoneme from regular Resh when the dagesh inside it is — a dagesh kal (a round dot in Simanim editions).</p>\n<p>Thus, Resh has two possible pronunciations.</p>\n<p><strong>I.</strong> Resh without the (round) dot = IPA [r] = It is commonly called the rolled R, rolling R, or trilled R. [Because the real fricative \"r\" is a Ghimel without the dot = Rimmel of the Yemenite = as in the French \"bonsoir\" IPA(key): /bɔ̃.swaʁ/]</p>\n<p><strong>II.</strong> RResh with a (round) dot = IPA [r] and even more of a plosive; in this case a louder and longer and more abrupt trill.</p>\n<p>B) There are exceptions to the ״אהחער״ rule: when we could meet in a handful of cases Resh and Aleph with a dagesh hazzak (Dagesh Hazzak = a square dot in the center of the letter in simanim editions). Which practically means that Resh with a Dagesh Hazzak has an emphatic pronunciation. Resh plus 1/2 of another Resh. Which in fact amounts to an elongation of the letter. Never mind if the letter is a fricative (tongue is in a mid lower position) or a plosive (the tongue is up in front behind the teeth and is more of a trill = kind of plosive).</p>\n<p>C) Scribal tradition</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Answer 5</strong>\nRabbi Aryeh Kaplan has a few pages on the topic in his translation and clarification of Sefer Yetzirah Chapter 4:1 page 159 and 250. see it here: <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/seferyetzirah00arye/page/159/mode/1up?view=theater\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://archive.org/details/seferyetzirah00arye/page/159/mode/1up?view=theater</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>As of Feldheim Tanach with the Simanim; all 17 identified sources have a Dagesh Hazak. Thus underlining their refusal to see RResh as a different phoneme, or their understanding that in practice there would not be a difference between Resh with Dagesh Qal or with Dagesh hazak. <strong>This is unfortunately inconsistent with the rules of dagesh Qal and Hazzak. Since at least in two places can be no doubt that it should be dagesh Qal: Habakkuk 3:13 and Psalms 52:5.</strong></p>\n<p>Dagesh Hazak also for the two cases of Alef as we would have expected, even though the dot is actually in between the sizes of dagesh kal and dagesh hazak; because of the lack of space.</p>\n<p>P.S. There is no Resh with dot = Rresh in Job 39:9, or 2 Chronicles 26:10 in the Koren or Artscroll Tanach, but they do appear in the Feldheim Tanach with simanim as dagesh Hazak.\n<a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/tanach-simanim-hebrew-only\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.feldheim.com/tanach-simanim-hebrew-only</a></p>\n<p>Wonder which is the complete list for Rresh. Are there more than 15, some mentioned 17 other 19.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Answer 6.</strong></p>\n<p>Excerpt from: HIDĀYAT AL-QĀRIʾ (SHORT VERSION) Geoffrey Khan (author)</p>\n<p>Chapter of: The Tiberian Pronunciation Tradition of Biblical Hebrew, Volume 2(pp. 194–253)</p>\n<p>II.S.1.2.\nTake note that the place of articulation oḟ א̇ה̇ח̇ע is the root of the tongue and the place of swallowing, that is the throat and the base of the tongue. For this reason they are the lightest of the letters and never take dagesh. It may be thought that he and ʾalef take dagesh, but this is not the case. This is because the dot in the he at the end of a word indicates the (consonantal) property of the he. Surely you see that the property of the he at the beginning and in the middle of a word appears without a dot.</p>\n<p>As for (the dot in) ʾalef in the four places (where it is found), namely ל֛וֹ וַיָּבִ֥יוּאּ ‘and they brought him’ (Gen. 43.26), תָּבִ֣יוּאּ ‘you shall bring’ (Lev. 23.17), לָ֜נוּ וַיָּבִ֙יוּאּ ‘and they brought to us’ (Ezra 8.18), רֻאּֽוּ לֹ֣א ‘were not seen’ (Job 33.21), <strong>this reflects a strong effort to pronounce the letter by the reader and is not dagesh.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Answer 7:</strong></p>\n<p>But see the Rav GPT also 👇.</p>\n<p>Another answer from Rav GPT after corrections underlined by “Heshy”:  Traditionally, Resh does not typically take a dagesh in Hebrew grammar. However, there are exceptions in masoretic note traditions that indicate a rare occurrence of a dagesh in Resh.</p>\n<p>Such instances are exceedingly rare and the product of particular scribal traditions rather than standard Hebrew grammar.</p>\n<p>Another occurrence sometimes noted by commentators where the dagesh is used to indicate an emphatic pronunciation due to the phonetic context, which can be influenced by the guttural letter (Ayin) that follows.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that the presence of a dagesh in Resh is generally not considered part of standard Hebrew orthography and can be the result of scribal practices that may differ from one textual tradition to another. In modern printed editions of the Tanach, you would likely not find a dagesh in a Resh, as the original reasons for such markings are not part of contemporary Hebrew grammar. Or are difficult to realize because of technical and financial reasons.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>** Answer 8 **\nMore on strange letters: <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/43455678/TEACHING_OTIOT_MESHUNOT_FROM_SCRIBAL_BIBLICAL_HEBREW_TEXTS\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.academia.edu/43455678/TEACHING_OTIOT_MESHUNOT_FROM_SCRIBAL_BIBLICAL_HEBREW_TEXTS</a></p>\n<p>&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&</p>\n<p><strong>Answer 9</strong></p>\n<p>For an amusing answer, see</p>\n<p>FLY-SPECK by Ambrose Bierce</p>\n<p>-n.</p>\n<p>The prototype of punctuation. It is observed by Garvinus that the systems of punctuation in use by the various literary nations depended originally upon the social habits and general diet of the flies infesting the several countries. These creatures, which have always been distinguished for a neighborly and companionable familiarity with authors, liberally or niggardly embellish the manuscripts in process of growth under the pen, according to their bodily habit, bringing out the sense of the work by a species of interpretation superior to, and independent of, the writer's powers. The \"old masters\" of literature - that is to say, the early writers whose work is so esteemed by later scribes and critics in the same language - never punctuated at all, but worked right along free-handed, without that abruption of the thought which comes from the use of points. (We observe the same thing in children to-day, whose usage in this particular is a striking and beautiful instance of the law that the infancy of individuals reproduces the methods and stages of development characterizing the infancy of races.) In the work of these primitive scribes all the punctuation is found, by the modern investigator with his optical instruments and chemical tests, to have been inserted by the writers' ingenious and serviceable collaborator, the common house-fly - Musca maledicta. In transcribing these ancient MSS, for the purpose of either making the work their own or preserving what they naturally regard as divine revelations, later writers reverently and accurately copy whatever marks they find upon the papyrus or parchment, to the unspeakable enhancement of the lucidity of the thought and value of the work. Writers contemporary with the copyists naturally avail themselves of the obvious advantages of these marks in their own work, and with such assistance as the flies of their own household may be willing to grant, frequently rival and sometimes surpass the older compositions, in respect at least of punctuation, which is no small glory. Fully to understand the important services that flies perform to literature it is only necessary to lay a page of some popular novelist alongside a saucer of cream-and-molasses in a sunny room and observe \"how the wit brightens and the style refines\" in accurate proportion to the duration of exposure.</p>\n<p>&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&</p>\n\n\n",

This is similar to the story of Shimon Hatzadik and the young shepherd who became a nazir to prevent temptation. While one should not have to make a neder to go to an extreme, there are times when it needs to be done.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the fact that the Torah has the Parsha of nazir next to the parsha of sotah shows that there are times when one must go to one extreme in order to prevent the problems of the other extreme.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/tp/i/sacks/304906251.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Sacks</a> points out that the Rambam says both ways</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah does not make a direct evaluation of the nazirite. On the\n  one hand it calls him \"holy to God\" (Num. 6: 8). On the other, it\n  rules that when the period comes to an end the nazirite has to bring a\n  sin offering (Num. 6: 13-14), as if he had done something wrong.</p>\n  \n  <p>This led to a fundamental disagreement between the rabbis in Mishnaic,\n  Talmudic and medieval times. According to Rabbi Elazar, and later to\n  Nahmanides, the nazirite is worthy of praise. He has voluntarily\n  chosen a higher level of holiness. The prophet Amos (2: 11) says, \"I\n  raised up some of your sons for prophets, and your young men for\n  nazirites,\" suggesting that the nazirite, like the prophet, is a\n  person especially close to God. The reason he had to bring a sin\n  offering was that he was now returning to ordinary life. The sin lay\n  in ceasing to be a nazirite.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Eliezer ha-Kappar and Shmuel held the opposite opinion. The sin\n  lay in becoming a nazirite in the first place, thereby denying himself\n  some of the pleasures of the world God created and declared good.\n  Rabbi Eliezer added: \"From this we may infer that if one who denies\n  himself the enjoyment of wine is called a sinner, all the more so one\n  who denies himself the enjoyment of other pleasures of life.\" (Taanit 11a; Nedarim 10a.)</p>\n  \n  <p>What is more puzzling is the position of Maimonides, who holds both\n  views, positive and negative, in the same book, his law code the\n  Mishneh Torah. In The Laws of Ethical Character, he adopts the\n  negative position of R. Eliezer ha-Kappar: \"A person may say: 'Desire,\n  honour and the like are bad paths to follow and remove a person from\n  the world, therefore I will completely separate myself from them and\n  go to the other extreme.' As a result, he does not eat meat or drink\n  wine or take a wife or live in a decent house or wear decent clothing\n  ... This too is bad, and it is forbidden to choose this way.\" ( Hilkhot Deot 3:1)</p>\n  \n  <p>Yet in The Laws of the Nazirite he rules in accordance with the\n  positive evaluation of Rabbi Elazar: \"Whoever vows to God [to become a\n  nazirite] by way of holiness, does well and is praiseworthy ... Indeed\n  Scripture considers him the equal of a prophet.\" (Hilkhot Nezirut 10:14.) How does any\n  writer come to adopt contradictory positions in a single book, let\n  alone one as resolutely logical as Maimonides?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ohr Somayach  ::  Torah Weekly  ::   Parshat  Nasso\nby Rabbi Yaakov Asher Sinclair - www.seasonsofthemoon.com \n<a href=\"http://ohr.edu/6369\" rel=\"nofollow\">Insights</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Returning to the young man in the story told by Simon the Just we can\n  now understand that his “passionate urge” was an irresistible\n  temptation to become like the mythical Narcissus. The young man, who,\n  by the way, is nameless in the story, recognizes that he was\n  susceptible to arrogant pride and self-worship. He feared lest he\n  yield to a self-centeredness which leaves no room for the love of\n  others. And so he resorted to a very potent “therapy”: the Nazirite\n  vow.</p>\n  \n  <p>By telling this story so dramatically, assuring that it would be\n  retold time and again throughout the ages, Simon the Just addressed\n  the paradox of the Nazirite practice. It is not for every man. <strong>For\n  most of us it is a sin to forbid that which the Torah permits</strong>. But for\n  those of us who are vulnerable to the temptations of narcissism the\n  “strong medicine” of nezirut <strong>may be necessary, if only for a while</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rigorously pious lifestyles do not render a person immune from the\n  curses of narcissism. The ultimate paradox is that the Nazir, or\n  anyone else who lives a life of extreme religiosity, can become as\n  guilty as Narcissus of arrogant pride and self-worship. They can come\n  to project a “holier than thou” attitude towards others. The Nazir can\n  fail to rid himself of his self-admiration and instead become\n  sanctimonious, cynically convinced that he is spiritually superior to\n  his peers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"http://congksi.blogspot.com/2015/05/naso-5775-english.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parsha Naso</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This practice received adverse and contradictory responses throughout\n  Jewish thought.  Some, like Nahmanides (Catalunya, XIII Century)\n  follow the position set in the Talmud by Rabbi Eliezer and Shmuel in\n  favor of the Nazir.  According to these sages, the Nazir is a role\n  model, which we should follow not only to fulfill a promise, but to\n  reach a higher level of holiness throughout our lives.  On the other\n  hand, Maimonides follows the Talmudic opinion of Rabbi Eliezer\n  HaKapar, who believed that in many cases a Nazir became a transgressor\n  as an extremist alienating himself from the Community.  This\n  controversy regarding the Nazir continued all the way through the\n  centuries, and among those who also opposed this practice we find some\n  of the Hassidic sages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/balancing-the-extremes-of-parshat-nasso/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Balancing the Extremes of Parshat Nasso</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Both of these interpretations come to explain the necessary situations\n  in which one would assume the holy mission of becoming a Nazir.\n  However, we’ve previously seen that not all sources see Nezirut as a\n  positive undertaking. In fact, the Gemara (תענית יא:א) sees it as a\n  ירידה לצורך עליה, a spiritual downgrade to allow for eventually\n  reaching an even higher level of spirituality. R’ Elazar Hakafar\n  explains there that a Nazir is in fact a sinner for attempting to\n  change human nature. G-d created us with good and evil inclinations,\n  and once one attempts to remove the yetzer hara, he is effectively\n  taking away part of his free will, something which Rambam (הלכות דעות\n  ג:א) calls “wrong,” “sinning,” and “acting like priests of the idol\n  worshippers.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Now that we understand that Nezirut may not be so ideal, it’s very\n  easy to see the significance of its juxtaposition to Sotah. The Sotah\n  is a woman who was too involved in her looks, and this led her to sin\n  by secluding herself with a man forbidden to her. On the other hand,\n  the Nazir is someone who goes to the other extreme- he is so afraid of\n  sinning, that he doesn’t let himself become involved in the physical\n  parts of the world, like the way he looks.</p>\n  \n  <p>The end results are just as radically different. The Sotah’s head is\n  shaved as a reminder that she must involve herself less in the world,\n  to avoid sinning in the future (if she was innocent, that is, and\n  isn’t killed by the mei chatat). The Nazir is not allowed to shave his\n  head, possibly to emphasize to him that he must involve himself more\n  in the world, and that this one part of his physical looks must be\n  left be.</p>\n  \n  <p>We’ve now seen that neither the Sotah nor Nazir lead ideal lifestyles,\n  and this juxtaposition of complete opposites is a warning against\n  going to either extreme.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>That Chattas is for becoming Tammei.

This shows us that although fasting is not in itself a good thing, there can be a greater benefit which justifies it. The story of Shimon ben Shetach illustrates this point.</p>\n\n<p>The Maharal writes in Nesivos Olam (Nesiv Teshuva 7):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מכל מקום נראה שלא נאמרו דברים אלו רק מי שהוא מתענה שלא על החטא, אבל מי שמתענה על שום חטא ועושה תשובה לאדם כזה ראוי לו התענית בודאי אף לצער נפשו בשביל חטא שעשה, וכן בשביל צרה פשיטא שיש להתענות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He writes here that for a sin or time of need it is good to fast.

Its taste is bitter, although not offensively so.\") according to <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/halachos-of-the-hive/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this OU article</a> has different opinions as to it's Kosher status.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some have argued that royal jelly should be permitted because it is honey-like, and presumably included in the Scriptural exception as well. But this argument is difficult to support, based on the two reasons cited by the Gemara above. First of all, royal jelly is a glandular secretion, and therefore subject to the general rule of that which comes from an impure (being) is also impure. Also, since it differs in appearance, taste, and function from honey, it should not be included in the Scriptural exception granted to bees’ honey since royal jelly can be considered a totally different food than honey.</p>\n<p>Others have contended that royal jelly is not considered fit for human consumption as it is “very bitter” and therefore not subject to any prohibition. This contention, however, is erroneous, for while royal jelly is indeed somewhat tart and bitter, it is by no means inedible even in its pure raw state. This was confirmed by our gentile tester.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=3375\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> Yeshiva.org.il article says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are different approaches in Halacha on this matter.\nSome hold it to be like honey since the Talmud does not differentiate between the two;\nOthers hold it to be non Kosher because of your point as it comes from an insect.\nSome are lenient in the case of royal jelly when it’s mixed with honey.\n(See Talmudic Encyclopedia 23 p. 356 and footnotes for the different sources)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Who are the opinions that hold this?

There, he writes an opinion based on what Maran wrote in the Shulchan Aruch, in Yore De’Ah siman 95:4. Maran writes of the case where people wanted to use giant pots normally used for dairy cooking for the purpose of cleaning various tableware and cookware including meat dishes. Maran says that it would be permissible to use this giant dairy pot to clean meat dishes so long as a distasting agent such as ‘Efer’ (Ashes) or soap is added. Such an agent would render the milk in the walls of the pot ‘pagum’ (bitter, unsavory, unfit, spoiled), thus allowing the insertion of a meat vessel for cleansing. This leniency even applies if the meat pot is dipped in the giant milk pot together with boiling hot water. </p>\n\n<p>Chacham Ovadia Yoseph applies Maran’s reasoning by the giant milk pot to permit simultaneous washing of meat dishes and dairy dishes in a dishwasher. The soap deposited into that designated compartment when released together with the hot water renders the dishwasher cavity ‘pagum’. Chacham Ovadia Yoseph therefore comes out that not only is it permissible to use the same dishwasher for both meat and dairy dishes, but it is also permissible for one dishwasher to be used to wash dairy and meat dishes simultaneously. This is also the opinion of Chacham Matloub Abadi in his Sefer ‘Magen Ba'adi’.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.dailyhalacha.com/displayRead.asp?readID=810\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.dailyhalacha.com/displayRead.asp?readID=810</a></p>\n\n\n",

For example, gerim toshvim were at Har Sinai and are frequently instructed throughout Texts to keep the Law in the same way as Yisrael. This directly contradicts the claim for teaching \"non-Jews\".Throughout history, this group of people have had different legal standings, or no real standing at all, but rather a casual title.</p>\n<p>Anecdotally, and hashkafically (word?), I have had a rabbi explain that Gerim have no \"nation\" (goyim) and possess a Jewish neshama, and as such are not traditionally \"converting\" according to the English understanding of the word- a change from one thing to another, but rather returning to a spiritual birthright/nation. Extrapolating this concept, with the question in mind, Gerim, opposed to Goyim, are not entirely \"non-Jew\", and all the more so for Paternalineal Jews, I guess?

However, he is not to be executed.\nWe should not prevent a gentile who desires to perform one of the Torah's mitzvot in order to receive reward from doing so, provided he performs it as required. If he brings an animal to be sacrificed as a burnt offering, we should receive it.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Now, it is clear to me that the harsh prohibition, foreseen at the beginning of this passage, for the Gentile who studies the Torah, and therefore, by logical consequence, the prohibition for a Jew to teach the Torah to a Gentile,\nmust be interpreted in the light of what Rambam states in step 10: \"We should not prevent a gentile who desires to perform one of the Torah's mitzvot in order to receive reward from doing so, provided he performs it as required \". Question: But how can a Gentile exercise the right to fulfill a Torah mitzva, \"it as required\", if he does not study it thoroughly first?</p>\n<p>Suppose, for example, that an Italian cattle breeder wants, for free choice, to fulfill the mitzva on the kosher slaughter of meat: Rambam tells us that he has the right to do so, but in order to be able to do so, the Gentile must necessarily study what the Torah teaches on the subject, perhaps by consulting the Shulchan Arukh or the Mishneh Torah,\nor by asking a rabbi that this precept be explained to him in detail.</p>\n<p>It would seem at first glance that there is a contradiction in Rambam's thinking. But in my opinion the harmonizing solution lies in this specific passage:</p>\n<p><strong>\"The general principle governing these matters is: They are not to be allowed to originate a new religion or create mitzvot for themselves based on their own decisions. They may either become righteous converts and accept all the mitzvot or retain their statutes without adding or detracting from them\".</strong></p>\n<p>In my opinion, Rambam specifies here that the prohibition for the Gentile to study the Torah is related to the case in which he wants to alter the design that HaShem has established for Jews and Gentiles, creating a \"new religion\".\nIn fact, it is one thing that the Gentile fulfills by free choice a precept of the Torah not contained in the Noahide Law, another thing is that a religious faith is created on the basis of which the Gentiles are obliged by HaShem to observe commandments other than the seven precepts, which would go against the teaching of the Torah itself.</p>\n<p>I conclude with another reflection: there is also the study of a particular precept of the Torah that a Gentile can appreciate for pure intellectual pleasure; in this case the risk of creating a \"new religion\" seems to me excluded at the root.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"In that era, there will be neither famine or war, envy or competition\n  for good will flow in abundance and all the delights will be freely\n  available as dust. <strong>The occupation of the entire world will be solely\n  to know God</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, Israel will be great sages and know the hidden matters,\n  grasping the knowledge of their Creator according to the full extent\n  of human potential, as Isaiah 11:9 states: 'The world will be filled\n  with the knowledge of God as the waters cover the ocean bed.\"\" -\n  Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Melachim 12:5</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the uninitiated and idolatrous, and those that don't keep the sheva mitzvot bnei Noach(the seven laws of the children of Noah), one must start their learning process of Torah, God's wisdom, in these sheva mitzvot(Hilchot Melachim 10:9).</p>\n\n<p>Even the penimiut, inner dimension, of the sheva mitzvot can be learned and fully grasped by bnei Noach.

I won't discuss how a tzaddik could marry such a person because it is not for us to make ta'anos (claims) on such a holy person. However, as far as the second part of your question as to how Delilah brought about his downfall, we can explain as follows:</p>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.9b.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 9b</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The verse states: “And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah” (Judges 16:4). It is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: Even if she had not been called by the name Delilah, it would have been fitting that she be called Delilah, for she weakened [dildela] his strength, she weakened his heart, and she weakened his deeds, thereby decreasing his merits.</em> (Sefaria translation and notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem that Delilah had a strong influence on him that proved detrimental to Shimson's physical, emotional and spiritual faculties.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.9b.15?lang=bi&p2=Ben_Yehoyada_on_Sotah.9b.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Yehoyada</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דִילְדְּלָה אֶת כֹּחוֹ, דִּילְדְּלָה אֶת לִבּוֹ, דִּילְדְּלָה אֶת מַעֲשָׂיו (שופטים טז, יח). פירש הרב עיון יעקב ז\"ל לשון דלות ועוני. ונראה טעם בזה כיון שהלך אחר עין שלו בדרך הפכפך הפך הדין נהפכו לו אותיות עין לאותיות עני שנעשה עני ודל בשלשה אלה.</p>\n<p>ונקיט ג' דברים <strong>מַ</strong>עֲשָׂיו <strong>כֹּ</strong>חוֹ <strong>לִ</strong>בּוֹ דראשי תיבות שלהם 'מלך' כי הוא היה שופט שהוא במקום מלך באותו זמן והיא דלדלה אותו בשלשה דברים הרמוזים בשם המעלה והשררה שלו וזה היה לו בשלשה דברים הנזכר מפני שהלך אחר מראה עיניו שיש בהם שלשה גוונים לבן וירוק ושחור.\nובני ידידי כבוד הרב יעקב נר\"ו פירש בשביל שזאת היתה אשה שלישית לכך דלדלה אותה בשלשה עד כאן דבריו נר\"ו.</p>\n<p><em><strong>She weakened (דִילְדְּלָה - 'Dildelah') his strength, she weakened his heart and she weakened his deeds</strong></em> - <em>The Rav explain in Iyun Yaakov that (the term 'dildelah') is an expression of making poor and impoverished. And it appears that the reason is because since he followed after his eye - 'ayin' in a (literal. upside down) fickle way, the judgement of his was also equally turned upside down. Thus the letters of \"עין\" (\"eye\") can be rearranged / turned upside down to read \"עני\" (\"poor\"), since she made him in poor in these areas.</em></p>\n<p><em>And it mentions three things (that she weakened him in)- \"<strong>מַ</strong>עֲשָׂיו <strong>כֹּ</strong>חוֹ <strong>לִ</strong>בּוֹ\" - \"his deeds, his strength and his heart\", and the roshei teivos (the first letter of each word) can be arranged to spell \"מלך\" - \"King\", and his role was that of judge which was in place of a king at that time, and she weakened him in three areas where he lost his sense of virtue and dominion. And it was to him in these three things that we mentioned because he went after the sight of his eyes which have three shades - white and green and black</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would be fair to say that Delilah was quite a wily personality that Shimshon was besotted with, and she was able to systematically strip him away of these three previously, strong character defining traits.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R. Gershon Weiss a\"h discusses this at length in his book <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1600911838\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shimshon's Struggle</a>. For one thing, he says, it's not at all certain that Delilah was a Philistine by birth; she may have been a born Jewish woman. In fact, he suggests that the wording of Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960661/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Thirteen.htm#v16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Issurei Biah 13:16</a> (וכן שמשון גייר ונשא, \"and similarly Shimshon converted and married\") suggests that only his first wife, the girl from Timnasah (Judges ch. 14), was a convert. (Although Touger there translates the phrase as \"Samson converted [women] and married [them],\" in the plural.)</p>\n<p>He goes on to note the rule in the Midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ruth_Rabbah.4.3?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ruth Rabbah 4:3</a>) that when a person is introduced with the formula ושמו\\ושמה פלוני, \"his/her name was X,\" then it indicates that they're righteous. Delilah is introduced that way.</p>\n<p>Also, he points out that the verses don't describe her as beautiful, making it unlikely that he was attracted to her looks.</p>\n<p>The gist of his explanation, then, is that she was indeed originally righteous (and indeed must have been, to risk marrying an aging fugitive from Philistine justice - remember that by this time he had already served as shofet for 20 years). That's what attracted Shimshon to her. What happened, though, is that the Philistine leaders offered her money to betray Shimshon, while implying that they'd spare his life if they captured him (in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.16.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Judges 16:5</a> they say only that they plan to \"overpower him, tie him up, and make him helpless\"). The lure of money warped her judgment and caused her to rationalize that by handing Shimshon over to them she'd actually be saving his life - and then, as the Gemara goes on to say there, she sank so far down that she ended up committing other serious sins, all the way up to and including adultery.</p>\n\n\n",

So on the whole there was commonality between the yeshivas (this could be due to the overall influence of Slobodka on all of the yeshivas which was the first yeshiva to feature theese cycle of mesechtas) but the differences were so slight that it was quite common for students to bounce back and forth from one yeshiva to another. </p>\n\n<p>However, I was wondering about the yeshivas in the Sephardic countries such as on Istanbul, Syria, and other middle eastern yeshivas, was there a curriculum in those yeshivas?

According to Daniel Boyarin, who authored a study on Canpanton's circle, his method spread to “Safed and Jerusalem… Constantinople and Salonika… Cairo and Fez,” but has not been recognized appropriately. As described by R. Mazuz, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The foundation of the foundations of iyyun is that there is nothing\n  missing [from] or added onto the language of the Gemara, Rashi, and\n  Tosafot. There is nothing missing – because the text has not come to\n  shut out [information] but to explain [matters], and it is not proper\n  [to think] that the main elements of the matters [under consideration]\n  are missing from the Talmudic discussion [Aramaic sugya] and its\n  commentaries, for they [the rabbis] have not come to test us with\n  riddles… And there is nothing added – because our rabbis have always\n  tried to write with brevity and exactness, [with] the small carrying\n  the abundant [i.e. with a small number of words carrying great depth].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-third-way-iyyun-tunisai-as.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">aforementioned article</a> for further discussion of this method. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# 3 meals on shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've seen a few questions on this site relating to meals on shabbat, but I believe my question is unique from them.</p>\n\n<p>At the shul I go to for shabbat, they eat one bread meal in Friday night, and one bread meal shabbos afternoon, right before shkia. In the middle, they make kiddish over mezonos delicacies right after musaf.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone explain to me if this is halachically accurate? I thought that one is supposed to eat 3 meals on shabbos, with (at least) the first two consisting of bread. The Rabbi at this shul said that the middle mezonos meal counts as the second meal. What is his halachic basis for this, if any? What are the sources which discuss what the 3 meals of shabbos must consist of?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As you noted in the question, the accepted <em>halacha</em> is that one requires bread at the first two meals (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.274.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 274:4</a>). At the third meal, one needs to eat bread as well; however, there are opinions that one fulfills his obligation with <em>mezonot</em> items (or even meat and fish, or possibly even fruit) (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.291.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 291:5</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Now, the opinion that allows one to follow <em>kiddush</em> with <em>mezonot</em> in order to fulfill the requirement of <em>kiddush bemakom se'udah</em> (that <em>kiddush</em> must take place in the context of a 'meal') is that of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.273.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 273:11</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, I contend that even Magen Avraham believes that these <em>mezonot</em> would <strong>not</strong> count as his second <em>shabbat</em> meal. I base this on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.274.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 274:2</a> where he discusses someone who has no appetite to eat on Friday night. Magen Avraham writes that such a person should make <em>kiddush</em> on Friday night and eat/drink a little to fulfill <em>kiddush bemakom se'udah</em>, and then must eat <strong>three</strong> full meals on <em>shabbat</em> day.</p>\n\n<p>So, even according to Magen Avraham, eating <em>mezonot</em> on Friday night does not count as his first meal. I contend the same is true regarding the second meal, as in your case.</p>\n\n<p>However, it must be noted that some do hold that, <em>bedi'avad</em> one would fulfill his second meal with <em>mezonot</em>. <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=10215&st=&pgnum=497\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Responsa Divrei David 86</a> (R. David Meldola, 18th century) writes that, although one has acted incorrectly in not eating bread at his second meal, he has fulfilled his obligation <em>bedi'avad</em>. He therefore rules that if one eats bread at a subsequent meal and forgets to add <em>retzei</em> in <em>birkat hamazon</em> he does not repeat, as this bread meal is considered the <strong>third</strong> <em>shabbat</em> meal, where forgetting <em>retzei</em> does not necessitate repetition (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.188.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 188:8</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Tosefos to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=101&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 101a</a> s.v. טעמו מידי writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נראה דהיינו טעימת לחם כדאמרינן בפ\"ג דשבועות (דף כב:) כדאמרי אינשי ניטעום מידי ואזלי ואכלי ושתו ואם מועיל מיני תרגימא להשלים ג' סעודות שבת כמו בסוכה היינו דוקא בסעודה שלישית אבל לא בסעודת ערבית ושחרית שהם עיקר כבוד שבת</p>\n<p>[For <em>kiddush b'makom seudah</em>] they specifically ate bread... and if מיני תרגימא (could be fruit, could be <em>mezonos</em> of the 5 species - Tosefos on 107b s.v. מיני תרגימא) and the like work to complete the 3 meals of Shabbos, that is specifically for the third meal, but not the first two, which constitute the primary honor of Shabbos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tur O.C. 273 quotes the Ga'onim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודוקא שאכל לחם או שתה יין אבל אכל פירות לא</p>\n<p>Specifically if he ate bread or drank wine, but not fruit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although there is an excluded middle in the Geonim (skipping from bread to fruit and leaving <em>mezonos</em> unaddressed), <em>mezonos</em> would seem to be included as being at least as good as wine.  The Mogen Avrohom 273:11 explicitly makes this point, and writes that <em>mezonos</em> is more qualified for <em>seudas Shabbos</em> than wine is.</p>\n<p>The <em>Mishneh Berurah</em> 273:25 cites this Mogen Avrohom.  However, in the Be'ur Halacha there s.v. כתבו הגאונים, he cites from ספר מעשה רב that the Gra held that specifically bread makes a Shabbos <em>seudah</em>.</p>\n<p>So there is room to go both ways - some opinions hold that <em>mezonos</em> (and even wine) is enough to fulfill the <em>seuda</em> requirement, and some hold that specifically bread is required.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Cholov Yisroel \"Kashered\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>So I was eating one of my favorite meals -- a bunch of peanut butter and cheese sandwiches, and to pass the time, I looked at the package of cheese. It is \"<a href=\"http://www.naturalandkosher.com/Natural_Kosher.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Natural</a> and Kosher\" by Anderson International Foods. The particular product is White American Pasteurized Process Cheese.</p>\n\n<p>Among the little \"badges\" on the side there is one that reads \"Cholov Yisroel Koshered at 212 degrees\". You can make it out on the top left of the cheese in <a href=\"https://westernkosher.com/content/images/thumbs/0021885_natural-kosher-natural-kosher-mozzarella-cheese-chunk-8-oz.jpeg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> picture.</p>\n\n<p>I have a limited understanding of the laws of Cholov Yisroel <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-issues-cholovYisroel.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">products</a> and am unsure what it means for the cheese to be \"koshered at 212 degrees\" and what that would have to do with Cholov Yisroel status.</p>\n\n<p>Is the 212 degrees and a \"koshering\" part of the Cholov Yisroel? Or the pasteurization, or something else?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Their factory produces both Chalav Stam (non \"Chalav Yisrael\") and Chalav Yisrael cheese. (You'll see a similar-looking label on a non-Chalav Yisrael brand.) They're advertising that they always kasher the machinery by running 212 F water/steam through it before doing the Chalav Yisrael runs, so even if you view Chalav Stam as completely non-kosher that would <em>treif</em> up the machinery, this product is still kosher.</p>\n\n<p>(Many of those who keep Chalav Yisrael don't view Chalav Stam as making the equipment/dishes non-kosher, but they're advertising to even those who do.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are two views about how to Kasher in the method of כבולעו כך פולטו - the way the non Kosher goes in is the way it comes out.</p>\n\n<p>One is to require only slightly above the temperature of the non-Kosher. The other is to require, in the case of hot water, full boiling (212 degrees Fahrenheit) and not relying on any assumptions about the temperature.</p>\n\n<p>The former option is quoted <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/kosher_articles/hotel_kashering.php#_ftn28\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> by the CRC on footnote 28. The latter opinion (which the CRC article alludes to a \"custom\" to try to satisfy) I have often heard the Shulchan Aruch HaRav quoted as a source for the opinion, but I haven't seen it inside.</p>\n\n<p>The notation on the cheese is to indicate that the Kashering is done to this stricter standard. I remember 20 years or so ago there was a wide variety in Kosherization practices with regards to this. Manufacturing companies prefer the lower temperature because it puts less stress on their equipment, and the lower demand for Kosher foods then meant that more certifying agencies went along with it.</p>\n\n<p>Today Kashering with boiling water at 212 is much more prevalent, but some companies (like apparently Anderson Cheese) like to advertise it more prominently.</p>\n\n<p>Although when it comes to milk a statement about Kashering at 212 will be in regards to \"Cholov Stam\" issues, when it comes to cheese, the issue is non-Kosher cheese (Gevinas Akum) not just whether or not it was Cholov Yisroel. In order to make something not Gevinas Akum it requires supervision at the time of rennet insertion, so this is highly unlikely to have been what preceded the Anderson production.</p>\n\n\n",

The Mishna Berura (296:34) explains that women are obviously obligated to keep all laws of Shabbos. The difference of opinion lies in whether havdala is treated as a part of Shabbos, or as a regular time-bound mitzva (such as tefillin which women are exempt from). The Taz (296:7) points out, however, that women must say Hamavdil Bein Kodesh L’Chol before doing any melacha.</p>\n<p>The Biur Halacha writes that women may make havdala, though should omit the beracha of Meoiray Haesh on the candle. The Aruch Hashulchan (296:5) and R’ Moshe Feinstein (CM 2:47), however, write that women may say this beracha, too, in the same way as they would on shaking a lulav if they wish to do so. Likewise, R’ Eliezer Waldenberg (Tzitz Eliezer 14:43) criticizes the calendars that advise women against making the beracha on candles.</p>\n<p>One reason why women avoid making havdala is because the Shelah (quoted by the Magen Avraham 296:4) writes that women shouldn’t drink the havdala wine (for Kabbalistic reasons). The Aruch Hashulchan points out that not everyone keeps this custom, and it’s more important to properly fulfill havdala.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://doseofhalacha.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/women-and-havdala.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dose of Halacha</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why didn't the Ten Martyrs answer differently?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Without arguing either the historicity or the historical accuracy of the midrash of  Eleh Ezkerah, the 10 Martyrs, I am wondering about the details of the story as told. According to the version on the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2751091/jewish/The-10-Martyrs.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad</a> website, the ten are asked</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the law with regards to he who kidnaps a man from the Jewish nation and sells him [into slavery]?” The rabbis replied that Torah mandates that such a man be put to death. “If so,” continued Turnusrufus, “where are your forbearers who sold their brother into slavery? Had they been here, I would have prosecuted them before your eyes. As for you, accept the decree of heaven, for since the times [of the 12 tribes] there have never been 10 sages of your stature [alive at one time]. Take upon yourself to die in accordance with your law; for Joseph the son of Jacob was kidnapped and sold by his 10 brothers, and their punishment has never been exacted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What troubles me is the rashi on Bamidbar 7:22 which references the medrash Rabba and reads</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One young he-goat: to atone for the sale of Joseph, about which it says, “and they slaughtered a kid” (Gen. 37:31).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In terms of the narrative, the Rabbis had a perfect answer -- the kidnapping was atoned for by the specific offerings in the desert. Now, while God might have intended them to be killed for other reasons and the voice from behind the curtain might have intended things to end as they did, it seems that the rabbis in the story should have objected to the charge as having been resolved generations before. However, it seems that according to the language of the Eleh Ezkerah, the required punishment is death so the claim in rashi, that an offering atoned, could not be true.</p>\n<p>Is the rashi/M\"Rabbah wrong or did the composer of the Eleh Ezkerah ignore the fact for literary reasons, or is there another halachic wrinkle involved?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The difficulty in understanding the Rashi on a simplistic level is that no sacrifice atones for intentional sin.  However, if you look at the actual text of the Midrash which Rashi is basing himself off of (Bamidbar Rabba 13:14), the atonement of this sacrifice was for something much more specific.  The Medrash recounts how Yehuda was responsible for dipping the coat belonging to Yosef in blood and bringing it to his father.  The Medrash concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכך נאמר בזה החטאת שהביאוהו כפרה עליו על שציער את אביו</p>\n<p>And therefore it says by this [goat] \"sin offering,\" as he brought it for atonement <em>for causing his father suffering</em>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The purpose of this offering was to atone for the suffering which Yehuda had caused his father, which was not intentional.  The sin of selling Yosef which deserves a death penalty was not, and could not be, the subject of this atonement.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I really don't understand your question as you referenced yourself, they knew this was a heavenly decree.

And the angel confirmed what Turnusrufus had said—that they were to stand in place of the 10 brothers who sold Joseph into slavery and suffer their punishment.</p>\n\n<p>Upon his return to his colleagues, Rabbi Yishmael related what he had heard from Gavriel the angel and urged his fellow sages to accept that this was a heavenly decree.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Not many answers work on a people who produce emperors such as this one in the following Medrash (Eicha 3:41):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ראיתה ה' עותתי שפטה משפטי<br>\n  חד יהודאי עבר קדם אדריאנוס ושאל בשלמיה. אמר ליה: מאן את? אמר ליה: יהודאי.<br> אמר ליה: ואית יהודאי עבר קדם אדריאנוס ושאיל בשלמיה? אמר: איזילו וסבו ראשיה.<br> עבר אוחרן חמא מה איעביד בקדמייא ולא שאל בשלמיה. אמר ליה: מאן את?<br> אמר ליה: יהודאי. אמר ליה: ואית יהודאי עבר קדם אדריאנוס ולא שאל בשלמיה? אמר ליה: איזילו וסבו רישיה.<br> אמר לו סנקליטין שלו: לית אנן ידעין מה אילין עובדי דאת עביד. דשאיל בשלמך מיתקטיל, דלא שאיל בשלמך מתקטיל.<br> אמר להון: ואתון בעיין מלכה יתי איך אנא בעי למקטלה בשנאי?<br> ורוח הקדש צווחת ואומרת: ראיתה ה' עותתי ראיתה כל נקמתם וגו':</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A Jew went passed Hadrian and greeted him.

To this the Emperor said, \"Can a Jew pass me and not greet me? Chop off his head!\" His advisers couldn't understand him. They asked, which way is it?

Rashi in Yevamos thinks that Ravina there thinks that the child is \"Yisrael Gamur\" and so thinks Tosfot (on the spot).</p>\n\n<p>BUT - Rashi in Kidushin (p. 72) thinks that Ravina says that he follows his mother to be ruled out as a Mamzer, and therefore the \"Kosher Child\" din is not met according to Ravina and thus he is considered a Gentile! The same might be understood from Rashi's words: \"ויצא בן האשה הישראלית – מלמד שנתגייר\" - that implies that he had to go through the Giur process (Note that the Ramban clarifies that the meaning is not an actual Giur). </p>\n\n<p>The same opinion can be found in Tosfot (Kidushin p 71) and Shaar HaMelech (הל' איסורי ביאה פט\"ו הל' ט) explaining the Riff's opinion.</p>\n\n<p>And there are many Achronim who ponder on this issue and explain (it's a little too much for this forum)</p>\n\n<p><em>[edit]</em></p>\n\n<p>Some Achronim still fear for the other opinion, some of which are the Maharshal on the Tur (266), and on the Drisha there. Another opinion that fears for it is Rabi Akiva Iger who states that even though he is Israel, we fear for the other opinion. Another one is the Yaarot Devash (Ch 1 last Drush).</p>\n\n<p>According to this, if a Giur Lechumra will not be conducted, some will say the a Bris cannot be done on Shabes, some other will even fear for Lechumra on any gentile\\Jewish Halacha...</p>\n\n<p>And some will fear for the Mamzer opinion, which sadly cannot be solved by the Giur Lechumra (hapilly though, as shown above, is not a de-facto fear).</p>\n\n<p><em>[\\edit]</em></p>\n\n<p>-- <em>If you read Hebrew you can gain insight on many mefarshim, in great details from <a href=\"http://www.din.org.il/2014/04/16/%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9D-%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA-%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A7-%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%91%D7%99%D7%95-%D7%92%D7%95%D7%99/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this wonderful Q&A</a> in the DIN website</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><strong>Sources that child born to gentile father and Jewess is gentile:</strong></p>\n<p>This opinion is most explicit in Tosfos Kiddushin 75b (and is consistent with Tosfos' opinion in numerous other places, noteably Yevamos 15 & 23).

Rashi seemingly contradicts this position in Kiddushin 75a, ruling that a child fathered by an <em>eved kenaani</em> and a Jewess is a Jew.</p>\n<p>See Tosfos Rid (Gittin 41b) who [like Rashi] differentiates between son of an <em>eved</em> & Jewess to a gentile & Jewess, based on the dictum עבד אין לו חייס. Chemdas Shlomo (E\"H §2) quotes the Nesivos (also in Shu\"t R' Yackov MeLisa from the author of  the Nesivos) who says something very similar.

(The mix was intentionally done, incidentally, for explicit purpose of selling it this way. Let's say the cheese is called \"Parmerican\" - parmesan (aged) + processed \"American\") Does the person need to wait 6 hours because he ate <strong>some</strong> hard cheese? How much hard cheese would require waiting 6 hours - does it follow the same concept of \"batul beshishim\" (less than 1/60) as with milk accidentally mixed into a meat dish (i.e., less than 1/60 is nullified)? Is the amount based on majority (more than 50% hard cheese in the mix means 6 hours) or is there some other measurement in this mix that requires a 6-hour wait?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The concept of bitul b'shishim should certainly apply here. The idea is that any amount less than 1/60th of the volume of the mixture is undetectable (<a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-ABISSELBITUL.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>), and therefore considered to not exist. </p>\n\n<p>Bitul b'rov (nullification by 50%) would not apply in this case as that only works for identical foods. For example, if two non-kosher chicken legs are accidentally mixed up with 3 identical kosher chicken legs, all 5 legs are permitted (do not do this in practice without consulting your rabbi). This would not apply in this case since the hard cheese is clearly not identical to the soft cheese.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, any cheese mixture that is less than 1/60 hard cheese should not require waiting while any cheese mixture that is more than 1/60 hard cheese would require waiting.</p>\n\n\n",

I can see that occuring during a hurricane, as you may be locked up in your home \"riding\" the hurricane which lasts most of the day.</p>\n\n<p>Chances are you would not directly \"ride out\" a tornado, itself, unless you had no choice. If you saw a tornado from a distance, but you are not directly experiencing its winds, would you or <strong>could</strong> you recite any type of bracha?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fact: based on a deleted comment</strong> - If you have watched \"Storm Chasers\" or any similar U.S. cable TV program, you would see people watching a tornado from a distance of anywhere from 20 - 30 miles to as little as about 1-2 miles. A tornado's wind field is extremely narrow; pretty much limited to the width of the tornado itself. (FYI windspeed in the center of a tornado is calm, just as it is in the eye of a hurricane.)

They just says \"on the wind...\"</p>\n\n<p>I saw a <em>sefer</em> called עין ישראל cited in a <em>likkut sefer</em> (I don't recognize the sefer, though) in which he explains that the point of these blessings are because one is awed by these experiences.  Therefore, the measure of how/when you make the blessing is dependent on in what circumstances a person is normally awed by such a thing, such as how often it is seen.  R' Melamed says that different sights have different measures of the proximity from which you must see them for the same reason - each has its own point at which it is an inspiring experience.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the blessing has been generally understood to be applied based on how the situation in which it awes or inspires the person.  Therefore, I would apply the above discussion to tornadoes as follows: one doesn't need to feel the tornado to be inspired - just seeing the phenomenon which is tearing up everything in its path is pretty powerful. Thus a blessing could be recited on seeing it.</p>\n\n\n",

The difference is extremely subtle. The original way to pronounce the Veth is called a Voiced Bilabial Fricative. In IPA this is usually transcribed as /β/. American and Israeli Jews tend to pronounce the V as it was pronounced in Europe, as a \"Voiced Labiodental Fricative\", transcribed as /v/. The later is probably not the original pronunciation. While it is common in European languages, it is extremely rare in the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p>There also reason to believe that this was not the pronunciation as of the time of Masoretes based on the Niqqud system. The difference between a letter with and without a Dagesh Qal is always whether or not the letter is a \"Fricative\" or a \"Plosive\". The Beth is always pronounced as a \"Voiced Bilablial Plosive\", or a /b/. Without a dagesh, you would expect the same sound except a Fricative, or /β/.</p>\n\n<p>By extension, you can also extend this to Peh and Feh. A Peh is a \"Voiceless Bilabial Plosive\" or a /p/. Without a dagesh, you would expect a \"Voiceless Bilablial Fricative\" or a /ɸ/. You do see this in middle eastern dialects. The European Feh is pronounced as a \"Voiceless Labiodental Fricative\" or an /f/. So the difference is relatively minor. For both letters, it simply goes from a Bilabial place of articulation, to a Labiodental place of articulation. I have pasted a video below which shows the difference.

However, Jews from Arabic countries pronounce this sound by using their lips only as Arabic does not have a v sound. As a result of this, many Jews from Arabic countries have lost the ability to use the v sound and so they pronounce every ב as a בּ.

The Vaad\ninstituted that it is forbidden to eat any food or drink any wine from anyone, even someone who is assumed to be trustworthy, unless the person has a letter from a head of a Rabbinical Court testifying to the Kashruth of the food.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הדרכי תשובה יו\"ד סי' קי\"ט סע' א' אות ו', הלחם הפנים, ועוד אחרונים:\n  תקנת ועד ארבע ארצות שלא לאכול שום מאכל או לשתות ײן מאדם אחר אפילו ממי\n  שהוא מוחזק בכשרות אלא א״כ יש בידו כתב הכשר מאיזה רב אב״ד שנעשה בהכשר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The predominant opinion is to assume that this enactment only applies to establishments, but a private person can be generally trusted. Although there is a concept in Halacha called עד אחד נאמן באיסורין - that generally people who are trustworthy are believed to verify the kashrus of food, nonetheless the Vaad made this enactment. </p>\n\n<p>This is the source for modern day Kashruth Certifications. However, there is a debate if this enactment was for only their times, or if this was an enactment for all generations. However, in the Sefer \"<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50568&hilite=4ba31614-6dff-4936-817e-13403918f4cf&st=%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%AA+%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%93+%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A2+%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%90+%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9C+%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9D+%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9B%D7%9C+\" rel=\"nofollow\">B'nesivos Hakashrus</a>\"  the author writes Vaad did mean in for all generations. </p>\n\n<p>Thus it would appear to be that nowadays if a restaurant were to operate without a certificate attesting to its kasruth from the Beth Din, despite the fact they claim the food is kosher, nonetheless it would seem to be prohibited to procure food that establishment. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimatly this is how the author cited above concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל מוכר שאינו מכיר את המורכבות והמסובכות בכשרות שבזמנינו ואינו יודע\n  מספיק ממה  .צריך להזהר, אע״פ שהוא מוחזק בכשרות אין לקנות אצלו כמבואר\n  חילוקי הדינים בפנים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, one who is not well versed in the intricacies of the Laws of Kashruth in our times, and does not know of what to be concerned for, even though he is a trustworthy person, nonetheless one should not acquire food from him.</p>\n\n\n",

Later, he realized his horrible mistake, and made extremely sincere repentance. Among the penitent actions include his frequent mentioning of Ramba\"m in his commentary as well as writing Sha'arei Teshuva - another terrific work of \"common sense\", as teshuva supports humility - an essential behavioral quality that is, I feel, NOT innate but needs to become \"common sense\".

The change is manifested by minor changes in the vowels of the word. Note the following four changes that occur:</p>\n<p>A patah may change to a qamats. For example, כָתַב becomes כָתָב.</p>\n<p>A segol may change to a qamats in a segholate noun. For example אֶרֶץ becomes אָרֶץ.</p>\n<p>Words with the accent on the final (tonic) syllable may shift accent to the previous (pretonic) syllable. For example, as the accent shifts כָּתְבָה becomes כָּתָבָה.</p>\n<p>The 2nd person masculine singular pronominal suffix retracts. For example, לְךָ becomes לָךְ (which is identical to its feminine counterpart).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gericlements.edublogs.org/files/2011/12/41-Hebrew-Pausal-Forms-283zm8f.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></p>\n<p>However, this is unique to Biblical Hebrew, and by the time of Mishnaic Hebrew it was erased by Aramaic influence. Therefore, when blessings are, instituted by the Rabbis, they are never in this pausal form. So originally, both Ashkenazim and Sephardim used to say בּוֹרֵא פְרִי הַגֶּפֶן.</p>\n<p>This is attested to by The Ashkenazi Haggadah, which is the 15th-century manuscript by Joel ben Simeon.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kVpvl.jpg\" alt=\"Gefen\" /></p>\n<p>This is also attested in the Birds Head Haggadah, which is the oldest illuminated Ashkenazi haggadah in existence from the 1300s</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xN0Dr.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xN0Dr.jpg\" alt=\"Birds Head Haggadah Gefen\" /></a>\nSource: <a href=\"https://cja.huji.ac.il/browser.php?mode=set&id=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://cja.huji.ac.il/browser.php?mode=set&id=1</a></p>\n<p>As time went on, Ashkenazi scholars decided to make the Hebrew blessings more in line with biblical Hebrew, which would mean that since the word גֶּפֶן is at the end of the sentence, then its pausal form should be גָּפֶן. But the Sepharadim did not make these changes to their Hebrew, so it remained as it always was, גֶּפֶן.</p>\n<p>Note: Recently Hacham Ovadia Yosef said that indeed גֶּפֶן is the correct spelling because according to him, the blessing does not end with גֶּפֶן, but rather it ends with people responding אָמֵן, which means that גֶּפֶן does not need to take the pausal form.</p>\n<p>Note: Yemenites also have a custom to say גָּפֶן. I'm ignorant as whether this was always their custom or whether they underwent recent grammatical changes as well.</p>\n\n\n",

Be’er HaGolah quotes the Tur ibid. and the Mordechai at the end of Avodah Zarah as his source. The Bi’ur HaGra cites the famous teaching that all mitzvos get a beracha beforehand as the rationale. </p>\n\n<p>But it doesn’t seem that the Gemara ever explicitly prescribes a specific beracha for this specific mitzvah. As such, I’d like to suggest that the reason the Rambam doesn’t bring down על טבילת כלי(ם) is <em>because he holds one shouldn’t say it.</em></p>\n\n<p>This is similar to how, in Hilchos Tefillah ch. 7, he says one should say the various Berachos in Birchas HaShachar but omits הנותן ליעף כח. The Shulchan Aruch concurs that one should not say it (OC 47:6), and the Taz explains that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דאע\"פ שנתן הטור טעם לסידורי אשכנז שיש ברכה זאת [...] מ\"מ כיון שהברכה ליתא בגמ' ע\"כ אין לאומר' וכ\"כ רש\"ל בתשו' סי' ס\"ד</p>\n  \n  <p>Even though the Tur brings a reason for the Siddur Ashkenazim which has this Beracha [...] nevertheless, since the Beracha is not in the Gemara, therefore we shouldn’t say it.

Perhaps he holds that the fact that we make Berachos on doing mitzvos is enough to validate it, while the Rambam would hold that the Beracha has to actually be in the Gemara in order to be said.</p>\n\n<p>I have no source for any of this other than my own logic. That said, if someone <em>has</em> posed this interpretation of the Rambam, I’d love to hear it. </p>\n\n\n",

As was the Torah itself passed from 'heavens above' to 'our lowly world'. Thus the root becomes very appropriate in this context.

An ethic that does consider and that affirms such human associations as nation, people, family, neighborhoods, is realistic and hence morally invaluable.</p>\n<p>That would seem to be an acceptable and self-evident principle. Yet the need the Talmud saw for legislating this rule indicates, according to the historian’s device we mentioned earlier, that this principle was often violated. There were, and are, apparently, many people who would rather assist the stranger than the acquaintance, would rather benefit the non-relative than the relative.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I would diagnose this phenomenon as an American Jewish\ndisease! Western Jews, since the Emancipation, have grown up on the\nmyth of “Universal Man,” a universalism which negates ethnic identity\nand national-religious uniqueness. It is the kind of myth which, for\nmany years, fed anti-Zionist classical Reform and the American Council\nfor Judaism, which, thank Heaven, we hear less and less from as time\ngoes on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would myself add that arguably the biblical paradigm of inverting this principle is Lot who would have had his own daughter be persecuted rather than a stranger.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Although from the gemara it seems like a regular drasha from a pasuk, meaning don't blame this on the Talmud, there seems to be an interesting explenation that I'd like to point out.</p>\n\n<p>The way the עץ יוסף on the Medrash Tanchuma explains it, this is actually a device for self preservation.</p>\n\n<p>In parshas Mishpatim on the words אם כסף תלוה, the Tanchuma (#15) spends much time explaining how people should give and lend to each other. The medrash then points out how these acts must be done without embarrassing the poor person, שהוא עמי, darshaning the word ׳my nation׳ as if it has two חיריק and is pronounced ׳with me׳. \n The Tanchuma says this is the source of the drasha ענייך ועניי עירך, ענייך קודם. עניי עירך ועניי עיר אחרת, עניי עירך קודמין לעניי עיר אחרת. </p>\n\n<p>The medrash goes on to say that Hashem is in charge and if the rich man won't be kind to the poor man, Hashem will reverse their roles. The Medrash brings a pasuk calling them brothers, proving their equality, ending with the words לפיכך, את העני עמך. </p>\n\n<p>Upon these words the Eitz Yosef says the medrash is trying to convey the point that the rich man should be kind to the poor man so that the poor man should in turn be kind to him, for being poor is a turning wheel in the world and today or tomorrow he or his children will need help.</p>\n\n<p>I think it's obvious from the flow of the medrash and the intent that this insurance policy of kindness will work better the closer the investments stay to home. Which is why we find varying levels of whom to give, family members, fellow citizens of your city, etc. </p>\n\n\n",

So it should really read \"in <strong>some</strong> Hasidic circles.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Roi Tamir Shlit\"a in his sefer מאיר נתיבים, a compendium of Halachos of safety and driving, quotes both Rav Chaim Kanievsky and Rav Wosner forbidding women from driving as it is a prohibition of Klei Gever- utensils which are exclusive to men.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A while ago, I asked a Satmar Chassid who lives in my neighborhood about why women do not drive.</p>\n\n<p>He explained that one of the reasons is that it is not considered <em>derech tzni'ut</em> - a way of modesty. He surmises that perhaps part of this origin was that when cars were developed, they had higher entrances - i.e., you had to step <strong>up</strong> (climb) into the car. When doing so, women had to raise their legs, thus revealing the lower part of their leg (and if wearing a loose skirt, perhaps, a higher area was also revealed.) Hence, perhaps, that concern lent itself to the original prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason is that driving and cars' concerns was considered a \"man's\" role. Consider, for example, young boys and teenagers' interest in cars; stats showing few women drivers, in general for numerous decades until a spike around the 60's - 70's (Neither of my grandparents ever drove; my mom never drove; none of my aunts, except 1 of them drove - there's some consistency, I think); how few female auto mechanics / auto dealers, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Also, a general consideration is that women should be at or near home and outside, minimally. Thus, it's deemed that driving a car is unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p>As for being a passenger, they are passengers for \"minimal\" purposes, and it's almost always with the entire family, including the kids. When they attend weddings, often even the infants come with them, even to a friend's wedding.</p>\n\n<p>There may also have been a security concern regarding sole women drivers. They are more likely to be harmed than men, and their own cars could be used as the very means or place of attack, as well.</p>\n\n<p>For various reasons, not having women drive has become a long-established tradition that numerous Hasidic rebbe's enforce and the community follows the rebbe's policy.</p>\n\n<p>It is debatable as to whether this would be \"halacha\" or minhag. It depends on your analysis. Personally, I would consider this \"halacha\" as there is a halacha to follow rules of modesty. If this is the rebbe's interpretation of what fits into these rules, then, for these Hasidim, it is their halacha.</p>\n\n\n",

I can't assume he had nothing to say. There was a fifty year span of time from the death of Shimon ben Gamliel 1 until the birth of Shimon ben Gamliel 2. This was the period of time referred to as the second and third generation of Tanaaim, why just leave it blank?</p>\n\n<p>The next chapter begins with Shimon ben Gamliel's son Rabi Yehuda HaNassi so again, there is no gap there.</p>\n\n<p>*This last Shimon ben Gamliel is not the same personality as the one in the second to last mishna as pointed out by Tosafos Yom Tov.

With Rabban Gamliel begins a shift towards personal goals, so there is gap skipping between Hillel and him, to separate. That is why there is no mention of Shimon ben Hillel. With Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel there is a return to the original theme of correcting  man's actions as pertains to the outside world, so again, a gap is left where we don't mention his father Gamliel. </p>\n\n<p>He also adds that the Tanna wanted to have a list of ten generations starting with Shimon Hatzadik to correspond to the ten utterances of creation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R' Meir Soloveichik in his series on Avot (<a href=\"https://tikvahfund.org/pirkei-avot-the-misunderstood-masterpiece/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">episode 4</a>) addresses the missing R' Gamliel. In essence he makes the argument that the reason for R' Gamliel's absence was a choice by his grandson Rabbi Judah the Prince (Rebbi, the redactor of the Mishnah) as a way of showing that R' Gamliel's approach to limiting access to the Beit Midrash (which caused him to be deposed) was not accepted.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the peirush <em>Leiv Avos</em> by R' Yaakov Haber, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel 1st was the last tanna before the <em>Churban Bais Sheini</em>. Both him and Rabbi Yishmael Kohein Gadol were executed by the Romans, as we learn from the midrash <em>Eleh Ezkerah</em>, Kinna <em>Arzei Levanon</em>, or Selikhah <em>Eleh Ezkerah</em> from the Ashkenazi Yom Kippur mussaf. After the <em>Churban</em>, the Jewish tradition was rebuilt under the new reality without the Temple by Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai, who later appointed the son of Rabban Shimon, Rabban Gamliel of Yavneh, who was also his student. Since the first perek carefully records the chain of tradition, it stops with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as the entire epoch prior to Churban was different.</p>\n<p>According to Abbarbanel and seveveral other <em>meforshim</em>, the last statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel 2nd, is really an ending signature of the perek, which binds all the teachings of the 1st perek to those of the words of Shimon haTzadik. In fact, each perek of Pirkei Avos has such a signatory mishna at the end, which breaks the \"chain\" of the perek.</p>\n\n\n",

The only thing I can think of is making noise on Shabbos, but these kids often make tons of noise anyways.

This is a <em>kli shemelachto l'issur</em>, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.308.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA OC 308:3</a> and following.</p>\n\n<p>However note that one should not use these objects if one has available an article whose use is not restricted (SSK 20:8) or for a non-Jew.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I would also note the Shemirat Shabbat KeHilchata (20:81) explicitely discusses a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&rls=com.microsoft:en-US:%7Breferrer:source%7D&q=penknife&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjwp5aAtNbgAhVF0YMKHT1ZAxYQsAR6BAgBEAE&biw=1920&bih=872\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">penknife</a> which appears to be similar to a Swiss knife (i.e., a tool with multiple blades, some of which might be useful for a permitted use on Shabbat, others not)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A penknife sometimes has fixed attachments which may not be used on\n  Shabbath, such as scissors or a nail-file.

    "content": "# Why no halachos in the Babylonian Talmud like in the Jerusalem Talmud?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Most Jewish texts have a easy way to pin down a citation.</p>\n\n<p>Some are numbered. For example, <em>Rambam</em> and <em>Y'rushalmi</em> and <em>Tosefta</em> have chapter and <em>halacha</em>. Some of these have different numberings in differing editions, but there aren't too many different numberings and, as, long as you assume your readers have an edition numbered like yours is, you can cite unambiguously.</p>\n\n<p>Others have named (or colloquially named) sections, which are short enough that one can find stuff within each section. For example, <em>Tanach</em> has short sections, and many older texts (before chapters were in common use) refer to verses as being in \"the section on <em>sota</em>\", \"written near <em>Shimshon</em>\", or the like.</p>\n\n<p>But the <em>Talmud Bavli</em> has no classically named or numbered sections below the level of chapter — its current near-universal pagination is a late invention — and its chapters (named and numbered) tend to be quite long. With some exceptions, pre-pagination texts tend to refer to citations only as \"in (the start/end of) chapter such-and-such\".</p>\n\n<p>Why? It seems an easy matter to break up the text into sections numbered sequentially by the snippets of <em>Mishna</em>, as the <em>Y'rushalmi</em> does. Why was this not done?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Gemara on each \"snippet of Mishna\" is often pretty long anyway (see for example Rosh Hashana - second mishna is on 16a, or Kiddushin - second mishna on 14b), so that wouldn't really narrow things down much. Plus there are places where all of the mishnayos for the perek are jammed together at the beginning (last perek of Brachos, 1st perek of Sanhedrin), and in manuscripts there are even more such.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>More to the point, the OP's assumption that the numbering of the halachos in the Yerushalmi and Rambam is ancient is incorrect. Manuscripts of the Rambam and early printings are divided into halachos, but they're not numbered. It looks like that started in the 1500s. And for the Yerushalmi, even later (one of the introductions there says that various numbering systems were developed by the Pnei Moshe and the Korban Haeidah, both 18th century). By that time the system of referencing the Bavli by page numbers was well established, so nothing else was needed.</p>\n\n\n",

Response was overwhelmingly positive and launched the venture. The <strong>high investment required</strong> was another barrier to entry for competitors.</p>\n<p>Finally, soon enough, <strong>Europe got engulfed in World War 1</strong> and following, which massively restricted printing of new books.

The reason why the Vilna Shas began to dominate over the Lemberg Shas to the point that it is used almost exclusive today it that the Vilna Shas was widely viewed as more accurate. The  Vilna shas was meticulously  proofread  and edited to correct errors from earlier editions. The Lemberg Shas was simply considered less accurate.</p>\n<p>Another issue was a cultural and economical one for the printers. The groups who were more likely to use the Lemberg  Shas (and other non-Vilna versions  ) were  less likely to place heavy emphasis on learning Gemora to begin with. Those groups also emphasized learning things like  Tur and Bais Yosef etc. as an independent study matter.  Whereas  the groups who  learned  Gemora, Rashi, Tosfos almost to the exclusion of anything else, (unless it was necessary for the understanding of Gemora) were all groups who used the Vilna Shas . Therefore any new Gemora being published was more likely to use the format of the Vilna Shas to reflect the market for it. Furthermore when a Sefer quotes a Daf in Gemora is invariably referring to the Vilna Shas.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, it was not applicable in Babylonia. (As CashCow mentioned in a comment, the Jerusalem version has Gemarrah for it.)</p>\n\n<p>I can't explain why each of the other tractates have no Gemarah.

It must; it is the pinnacle of one's very consciousness, and therefore is the foundation of everything else - our intellect, our memories, our feelings. Because it has all of those, it can be the basis for one's own life, but also acts as the source to create more life, given that it contains the entirety of life within it.</p>\n<p>So, the Kabbalah says that angels are created from the externality of the Sefirot through Hashem's Chochma. What is the externality? Intellectual light: they are thus like students. A student learns a lesson from the teacher by the teacher giving them the information by speaking it to them, and may get it very deeply, but does not actually gain the actual <em>brain</em> of the teacher, forming an integrated identity with the teacher's intellect.</p>\n<p>Therefore, angels are generally made from a single sefira, such as Chesed (Michael's camp) or Gevura (Gavriel's camp) which becomes their \"self\"; their penimiut. This will be their essence and life force, but they will also receive an \"externalised lesson\" about the rest - they will be \"taught\" how to think and do the other aspects of life that are not their essence - this will be Hashem's, not their own.</p>\n<p>Not so with Neshamot: we are made thus from Hashem's 10 Sefirot (of Atzilut), the penimiut of the keilim. Neshamot are created with a fully integrated 10 Sefirot (a partzuf). They are therefore created in the Divine Image, an Adam, and have the entire map of life within them as their own, which they received from Hashem via His light that shines within the 10 Sefirot of Atzilut. Yisrael in particular take on this role and feel innately like His children (especially in moments of mesirat nefesh), and take on \"His personality\" so to speak because they received them from Him <em>internally</em>.</p>\n<p>See Derech Mitzvotecha Pru Urvu, and ר״ה 5656 for more information.</p>\n<h2>Angels do not have bodies, Neshamot are destined for bodies</h2>\n<p>R' Avraham Azulai explains at the end of Maayan 1 of his work, Chesed LeAvraham that angels are pure spiritual beings, and when they come to Earth, they must take on a delicate garment, made up of the spiritual elements of fire and air, but somewhat materialized. The \"fire\" is indeed consuming, but it is contained and won't burn anything.</p>\n<p>This very subtle garment is not like a body, but simply a vehicle with which to operate during their stay in this realm, as they can't otherwise. It is so subtle that not everyone can see it, and it's possible that only the people they are sent to interact with will be aware of the presence of the angel, and once they are done, the garment dissolves back to its source and the angel returns to their source.</p>\n<p>This is not considered a death. The relationship between the angel and the garment is even less significant than the relationship between a human and his clothes, and they do not suffer any pain. In fact, the garment is very uncomfortable for them.</p>\n<p>Neshamot, on the other hand, were created to be put into bodies, as we learn in Zohar Mishpatim.</p>\n\n\n",

The Chafetz Chaim in Hilchos Loshen Harah 5 writes that even if a father or rebbi asks him to say lashon harah it is prohibited. However, in a case of to'eles it is permitted just like in any other to'eles case.

On the other hand, once in a while one can ask a student can come and tattle on another.</p>\n\n<p>However, he finishes off that one should still be Machmir like the Igros Moshe, and says that this may be the reason people don't care for Lashon Hara - They were educated in it since their Cheder days!!</p>\n\n\n",

It implies rulership or command on something. Thus, G-d, who is the Ruler of the world is correctly referred to as . אדני. (What you may hear in colloquial  Modern Hebrew when people address a stranger as אדוני, which literally would mean \"My Lord\" or \"My ruler\", is technically, incorrect.)</p>\n\n<p>בעל means \"owner\" and it does not imply rulership, necessarily. Thus בעל הבית means \"the owner of the house\". However, within the context of the bracha you mentioned which is part of <em>Birkat Hamazon</em> - Grace After Meals, the term בית doesn't necessarily mean a physical house (the structure) but means \"household\" or \"family\". (See usage of the term בית in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.12.7?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Numbers 12:7</a>, as an example of similar usage.)</p>\n\n<p>Now that you know the difference in meaning, here's further proof that the word אדון for referring to your father would be confusing, if not inappropriate. In the bracha you refer to your father as בעל הבית and your mother as בעלת הבית . So you have two household family \"owners\" - mom and dad, together own the \"family\" or \"household\". If they were <strong>both</strong> אדון - rulers - well, IMO, I think you would have a confused dysfunctional family. It is not a given that dad is necessarily the אדון. In my household, my wife is the ruler far more than me. I'm just the \"nebbish\" chief executive trash disposal guy ;-)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The difference between Adonay and baal.

Soloveitchik in a powerful address to the RCA rabbinical convetion in 1973 told the story of a couple (<a href=\"https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/04/2013/the_rav_speak/\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rav told the story of a young man and woman who sought his\n  assistance.

    "content": "# Is the proof from creations sound?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the beginning of Hovot Helevavot the author prooves the existence of God by bringing a proof from all creations.</p>\n\n<p>To paraphrase: just as every creation (painting, car, book) has a creator so to does the universe and the living creatures have a creator.</p>\n\n<p>The issue I have with this line of thought is that the majority things in our environment have not been made by human creators (forests, oceans, galaxies). Can you prove how the majority of things came into existence by analyzing the minority?</p>\n\n<p>That's like saying that if a certain ethnicity has a certain unique physical attribute so to does the whole human race - which is not the case.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Chovos Halevavos does not refer to human beings but makes a general statement (Gate 1 ch.6):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"It is evident to us that for things which come about without the\n  intent of an intender (i.e. an intelligence) - none of them will\n  display any trace of wisdom or ability.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>so if we see something that displays wisdom and we know it cannot be eternally existing, then we conclude it must have come about through an act of intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>the alternative is dumb luck which is not impossible just that as the number of events that need to occur for the thing to function increases, the odds decrease exponentially.</p>\n\n<p>the scientist Roger Penrose for example calculated the odds of chance making the universe stable enough that it still exists is about 1 in 10^10^123</p>\n\n<p>i.e not 1 with 123 zeros but 1 with 10^123 zeros. see <a href=\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/creatorfacts/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/creatorfacts/</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Assuming you are referring to what is often called the \"teleological proof\", the proof is indeed sound (and, isolated from the noise of the angry agnostics/atheists, is even <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1560621834\" rel=\"nofollow\">obvious</a>). The argument is based on statistical induction, the same cognitive methodology that is behind all of the natural and social sciences, as well as basic, rational thought. The construct of the argument is fairly simple and, like all proofs about the real world, involves taking something we already know, and interpolating from it to something we originally did not. In the case of teleological reasoning, it is actually the exact same proof we use when we assume that other people exist (albeit somewhat stronger since in those applications there is technically more room for attacks based on the possibility of intentional deception, which would not apply here since the whole point is to show intention to begin with).</p>\n\n<p>With regard to your specific questions regarding the obvious differences between artificial machines and natural ones, the argument does not induce all properties from the known relationship to the unknown. Using Occams' Razor, one only induces the minimum \"properties\" necessary to explain the phenomenon.</p>\n\n<p>The argument is essentially the strongest form of what is known as hypothesis testing. When a scientist proposes a model to explain observed phenomena, he tests the models ability to explain the phenomena relative to the null hypothesis, namely, the likelihood that the phenomenon would be observed at random even if the model model/hypothesis were false. The criterion generally accepted to \"prove\" a hypothesis is 95% or in stronger studies sometimes %99. In the case of the teleological proof, the criterion reached is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...\" rel=\"nofollow\">99.99999999999...</a> which is as close to certainty a proof in the natural sciences could ever get (and, indeed, in no other instance do other such proofs come close.)</p>\n\n<p>Getting to the actual proof, the observed phenomena upon which the inferrer bases his inference are: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>his own existence (which includes his observations of his own intentions/conscious choices as well as of his own ability to control and design his environment to reflect his intentions);</li>\n<li>the changing medium/environment in which his intentions are expressed, including both changes that he observes to correspond to his own expressed intentions, as well additional changes that he does not observe himself to be in control of.</li>\n<li>the partial similarity between those changes he observes as self-initiated and those that are not observed as self-initiated.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Based on this information, he is able to infer the presence of another mind behind those environmental changes. Based on how similar the other-initiated changes are to the self-initiated changes, the inferrer can infer the level of similarity between the intention of the detected other and his own intentions. This process is known as Theory-of-mind. As you note, in the case of natural phenomena, there are large differences from artificial ones. This is why teleologists do not assume man made the natural universe and rather that the Mind behind it is quite different. But the same basic logical argument is used in infering both man and G-d.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What do you do if you realize your talit is damaged after donning it?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I saw this happen at minyan this morning and wondered what the correct response is.  The shul has a rack of <em>talitot</em> for people who don't bring their own.  Somebody took one from the rack, made the <em>b'racha</em>, donned it, sat down, began to daven, and only then noticed that one of the <em>tzitzit</em> was missing (which I understand renders it invalid).</p>\n\n<p>Upon noticing the problem, does the wearer replace the <em>talit</em> immediately?  With or without a new <em>b'racha</em>?  (Does the original still apply, or was it never valid?)  Does the amount of elapsed time matter?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>If someone is wearing a four cornered garment without Kosher Tzitzit (and missing one corner invalidates the whole thing (OC 13:1)), they must either tie on Kosher Tzitzit or take it off. (On Shabbat, of course, the former action is impossible.)</p>\n\n<p>If taking it off right there would cause serious embarrassment, the Rama (OC 13:3) allows one to remain with it on, at least until the next opportunity to take it off privately. Later commentaries there discuss the precise scope of this leniency (and how quickly one must seek such a private place), with greater leniency being offered on Shabbat as one can claim an exemption from the obligation of tying Tzitzit to that garment due to Oneis, and less leniency with our modern Talitot Gedolot which are worn over our clothes where there is less embarrassment in taking them off. A lot probably depends on the circumstances and how embarrassed the wearer feels. I note one suggestion, particularly relevant to the case of a Shul's public Talitot, is to renounce any <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/13888/should-the-shaliach-tzibbur-check-the-tzitzis-of-a-tallis-given-to-him-to-daven/13894#comment40282_13894\">ownership claim</a> to the garment, thereby exempting you from any obligation to attach Tzitzit to it for at least 30 days (OC 14:3).</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the Bracha, essentially the Bracha said on the invalid Talit was Levatala/invalid unfortunately and does not accomplish or exempt anything.

See there for his sources.</p>\n\n<p>3:4 Since God is absolutely perfect in Himself, it is obvious that He had no inner need to create the universe. It must be concluded that God's creation of the universe was a most perfect act of altruism and love. It is thus written \"The world is built of love\" (Psalms 89:3)</p>\n\n<p>3:12 Man was therefore created as a creature capable of to some degree understanding, and ultimately experiencing, the greatest possible good, which is God Himself. It can therefore be said that God's purpose in creation was to allow Himself to be experienced by a creature far removed and much lower than Himself. It is thus taught that God created the universe because \"He desired an abode in the lower world\". (Tanchuma Naso 16)</p>\n\n<p>3:13 God caused man to have a psychological makeup with which he would experience the greatest possible pleasure in doing something that he knew to be good and beneficial. This pleasure is enhanced according to the importance of the authority declaring that a given action is good. Since God Himself is the highest possible authority, there can be no greater pleasure in performing a job well done than in knowingly obeying the expressed will of God.</p>\n\n<p>3:15 Obedience to God's will therefore fulfills His altruistic purpose in creation.</p>\n\n<p>3:16 In order to enjoy the pleasure of such accomplishment, it is imperative that man know that his accomplishment is a matter of his own free choice, and not the result of his nature of compulsion. So that all choices of action be up to the individual, God gave man absolute free will. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are really two ways to look at this question.  One way is \"what purpose is served through the creation of man,\" which is what the other answers have addressed.  The other way to ask the question is \"what was Hashem's motivation in deciding to create man?\"</p>\n<p>This second question is what the Rambam describes as having no \"real\" answer.  The Rambam writes in Moreh Nevochim 3:13, after pointing out the difficulties in identifying the purpose (תכלית) of creation, what the inevitable conclusion must be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם תאמר אין זה לשלמותו אלא לשלמותנו, לפי שכך הוא הטוב לנו והיא שלמותינו, תתחייב השאלה עצמה ומה תכלית מציאותנו בשלמות זו?  והכרחי הוא שיסתיים הדבר במתן התכלית שכך רצה ה' או כך גזרה חכמתו, וזהו הנכון</p>\n<p>And if you will say that [creation of man] is not for the sake of His perfection but rather for our own, as this perfection is the best thing for us, this necessarily begs the question - what is the purpose of our existing with this perfection?  And one must conclude by giving the reason that this is what Hashem wanted or this is what His wisdom decreed.  And this is correct...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, answering, or even asking, the question would really be an infringement on the absoluteness of Hashem's existence and His <em>kadmus</em> (exclusive primordiality), as seeking a reason why Hashem would want to create the world implies the existence of something external from Himself which would influence His decision.  R' Yosef Alcastille makes this point explicitly (in a letter quoted by the Shela\"h in Beis Hashem):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם תשאל טעם לרצונו של מקום אתה שואל אם יש סיבה למעלה ממנו שתעורר אותו לעשות זה</p>\n<p>And if you ask for the reason of Hashem's will, you are asking if there is a cause above Him which aroused him to do this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can't tell you for sure that the Rambam would include this in במופלא ממך אל תדרוש - that which is beyond you do not seek (Chagiga 13b, see Moreh Nevochim 1:32), but it certainly seems reasonable to call it such.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>to answer part of the question</p>\n\n<p>from the chovos halevavos gate 4 ch.3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"That one is conscious of G-d's abundant goodness to man, and how He\n  brought him into existence out of abundant and pure benevolence and\n  kindness, without man being worthy of this, nor because G-d has any\n  need for him, but only out of generosity, benevolence, and goodness\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>hence, God does not gain anything. It is pure altruistic benevolence</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Can one cite divrei torah in the name of a rabbi who has gone astray?",
    "content": "# Can one cite divrei torah in the name of a rabbi who has gone astray?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the most recent issue of Jewish Action, there is a <a href=\"https://jewishaction.com/religion/jewish-law/halachah-and-the-fallen-rabbi-q-a-with-rabbi-hershel-schachter/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brief interview</a> with R. Herschel Schachter about \"Halacha and the Fallen Rabbi\". The final question is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>JA: Can we/should we continue to cite divrei Torah in his name?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>to which R. Schachter responds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>RS: We are not allowed to do so. The gemara (Avodah Zarah 35b) says\nthat if a rabbi violates halachah, one cannot say divrei Torah in his\nname. The statements found in the Talmud in the name of Elisha Ben\nAbuya were made when he was still committed to Torah observance and\nbelief (see Tosafot, Sotah 12b). If it would appear that the books and\narticles of the fallen rabbi were written before he began his sinful\nbehavior, they may be used.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Schachter's reference to Avodah Zarah 35b appears to refer to אמר להו רבא ואיתימא רב נחמן בר יצחק לא תשתעו (בהדיה דאיבו) דקאכיל לחמא דארמאי. The Bach comments:  בהדיה דאיבו. נ״ב ס״א לא תשתעו מיניה דאיבו פי׳ לא תאמרו דבר שמועה משמיה. אלפסי והר״ן והרא״ש. Does anyone else cite this Gemara as a source that it is forbidden to quote a dvar torah in the name of a rabbi who has sinned?</p>\n<p>Also, R. Schachter (or an editor?) refers to Tosafos in Sotah 12b as a source indicating that only statements of Elisha b. Avuyah \"when he was still committed to Torah observance\"\nare quoted. However, Tosafos there has two opinions about whether R. Meir is called \"Acherim\" only when citing Acher, or whether R. Meir was always called Acherim after the incident recorded in Horiyos 13b. How does this relate to the status of Elisha b. Avuyah? Here is the text of the Tosafot in question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אחרים אומרים נולד כשהוא מהול. ומקשים מדקאמר ר\"מ טוב שמו מכלל דאחרים\nלאו היינו ר\"מ ובשלהי הוריות (דף יג:) אמר דאסקוה לר\"מ אחרים ובפ\"ק\nדברכות (דף ט:) בגמרא מאימתי קורין שמע בשחרית אפליגו ר\"מ ואחרים וא\"ר\nשראה בקונטרס צרפת שמועות שקיבל מאלישע בן אבויה קבעום בשם אחרים מפני\nשהיה שמו אחר אבל שאר שמועות קבעום בשמו ולא מסתברא דהא לרבי נתן אסקו יש\nאומרים ואית לך שכל שמועותיו קבעו כך ולר\"מ נמי עשו כיוצא בו אלא נראה\nדלאחר דאסקוהו אחרים חזר בו ואמר נולד כשהוא מהול וכן בפ' קמא דברכות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>On the one hand, the Gemara in Chagigah (15a) quotes Elisha b. Avuyah specifically <strong>after his apostasy</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After his apostasy, Aher asked R. Meir [a question], saying to him:\nWhat is the meaning of the verse: God hath made even the one as well\nas the other? He replied: It means that for everything that God\ncreated He created [also] its counterpart. He created mountains, and\ncreated hills; He created seas, and created rivers. Said [Aher] to\nhim: R. Akiba, thy master, did not explain it thus, but [as follows]:\nHe created righteous, and created wicked; He created the Garden of\nEden, and created Gehinnom. Everyone has two portions, one in the\nGarden of Eden and one in Gehinnom. The righteous man, being\nmeritorious, takes his own portions and his fellow's portion in the\nGarden of Eden. The wicked man, being guilty, takes his own portion\nand his fellow's portion in Gehinnom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, the principle קבל את האמת ממי שאמרו tells us that we do not care about the source of an idea, only about whether it is true (Rambam, Shemonah Perakim, introduction). In a <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2015/06/more-about-rashbam-on-genesis-chapter-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">post on the Seforim blog</a>, Marc Shapiro notes that the Ibn Ezra often cites Karaite scholars by name, and R. Moshe Teitelbaum, in his Yismach Moshe, defends this practice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנה אנכי שולח מלאך ע' באברבנאל שכתב בשם חכמי הקראים כי זה נאמר על\nיהושע, והנה האומר דבר חכמה אף באוה\"ע חכם נקרא, <strong>ובאמת שהם גרועים כי הם\nמינים ואפיקרוסים, מ\"מ את הטוב נקבל</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the Gemara in Avodah Zarah 35b in which רבא tells his colleagues not to cite איבו, the Rishonim explain that the problem of citing איבו was that he did not fulfill rabbinic decrees, and therefore did not deserve to be treated as a rabbi in good standing (see Ramban, Meiri, Torat ha-Bayit ha-Katzar 3:7; Ritva: מידה כנגד מידה כי הוא מזלזל בדברי חכמים ז\"ל ותקנותיהם ולכן אין מקלסין דבריו בבית המדרש). Thus, as long as it is clear that this individual is not being cited as a rabbi in good standing, there should be no problem of citing him for his ideas.</p>\n<p>EDIT: See also <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=790&pgnum=45\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this teshuvah</a> (סימן יא) of the Machaneh Chaim in which he discusses this issue, and based on the Torat ha-Bayit says that one can quote the Torah but omit the name of the one who said it.</p>\n<p>However, as R. Ari Kahn notes in a shiur on <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/859704/.V346YOSCQjQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">yutorah</a>, the Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=193\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hil. Talmud Torah 4:1</a>) and the Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De'ah 246:8) rule that one may not learn from a rabbi who has gone astray, seemingly based on the Gemara in Mo'ed Katan (17a), and against the view of R. Meir:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר יוחנן מאי דכתיב (מלאכי ב, ז) כי שפתי כהן ישמרו דעת ותורה יבקשו\nמפיהו כי מלאך ה' צבאות הוא אם דומה הרב למלאך ה' יבקשו תורה מפיו ואם\nלאו אל יבקשו תורה מפיו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Citing the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=17456&rid=193\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Yirmiyahu</a>, R. Kahn also distinguished between learning directly from a <em>rasha</em> and studying his works.</p>\n<p>See also this <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/headlines/disgraced-rabbi-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">discussion</a> by Dovid Lichtenstein. Noteworthy is his citation of R. Nachum Eliezer Rabinovitch:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A different approach to explaining the Rambam’s view is suggested by\nRav Nachum Eliezer Rabinovitch, in his Yad Peshuta commentary to\nMishneh Torah.  Rav Rabinovitch observes that the Rambam links this\nprohibition with the prohibition against teaching a תלמיד שאינו הגון –\na student who conducts himself [im]properly.  The Rambam establishes that\none should not teach Torah to a student who “follows an improper\npath,” but should rather guide such a student towards appropriate\nbehavior, after which מכניסין אותו לבית המדרש ומלמדין אותו – “he is\nbrought into the study hall and then taught.”  Meaning, a wayward\nstudent should be taught privately until his behavior improves, at\nwhich point he may be allowed to join the beis midrash and learn with\nthe other students.  The Rambam then writes, וכן הרב שאינו הולך בדרך\nטובה…אין מתלמדין ממנו – “Similarly, a rabbi who does not follow the\nproper path…people should not learn from him.”  The word וכן suggests\na degree of parity between these two halachos – the prohibition\nagainst teaching a wayward student, and the prohibition against\nlearning from a wayward teacher.  Accordingly, Rav Rabinovitch\nsuggests, the second prohibition parallels the first, and thus we must\ndistinguish between public lecturing and private study.  Just as a\nwayward student is not allowed into the beis midrash to study with\nother students, a wayward teacher is not permitted to serve in any\nsort of public capacity, and this is the Rambam’s intent when he\nwrites, אין מתלמדין ממנו – he may not be allowed to teach groups of\nstudents.  Exceptional individuals, however, the likes of Rabbi Meir,\nare permitted to study from a wayward rabbi, just as a wayward student\nshould be taught privately until he is deemed worthy of joining the\nbeis midrash to participate in public Torah study.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/headlines/disgraced-rabbi-part-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Part 2</a> of his discussion, which concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In light of what we have seen, the following guidelines apply when a\nrabbi or educator is alleged to have engaged in inappropriate conduct:</p>\n<p>One must not reach any definitive conclusions based on hearsay, and\njudgment must be reserved until rumors of misconduct have been\nsubstantiated.</p>\n<p>If it is confirmed that the rabbi in question engaged\nin behavior that brings shame to Torah, one may not learn Torah from\nhim.</p>\n<p>It is questionable whether one may read a sinful rabbi’s written\nworks or use his recorded material. Written or recorded material that\nthe rabbi produced before he became a sinner may be used.</p>\n<p>If a\ndisgraced rabbi has sincerely repented, he may once again teach Torah,\nthough it would appear that according to some views, there must be\ncompelling evidence of true, genuine teshuva.</p>\n<p>At least according to\nsome opinions, even after a disgraced rabbi has genuinely and\ndemonstrably repented, he may not resume his official rabbinic post or\neducational position if his reinstatement will create a חילול ה’, or\nif the position is an especially distinguished post, such as in the\ncase of a Rosh Yeshiva.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. David Brofsky, after considering the sources, <a href=\"http://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/halacha-hashkafa/can-one-study-the-torah-of-disgraced-rabbis/2018/12/31/?fbclid=IwAR1KrpCI5VzUCUtijFvQhg4Yjdw4u7iz4uDuJP5EUf1IMTgPLPC-vx4maXY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">concludes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>May One Study the Books of a Disgraced Rabbi?</strong></p>\n<p>The answer to this question may depend on why we are not allowed to\nlearn from a rabbi who doesn’t resemble “an angel of the Lord of\nhosts.” One possible reason may be that a student who maintains a\nrelationship with such a teacher will learn from his behavior. If that\nis the case, perhaps his written works may still be studied. (Indeed,\nthe passage cited above [Chagiga 15b] questions how Rabbi Meir could\ncontinue to learn “from the mouth” of Acher.)</p>\n<p>The Divrei Yirmiyahu (commenting on Rambam, Hilchos Talmud Torah 4:1)\nholds this position. He writes that “the connection with the evil\nperson is bad and causes harm and [spiritual] destruction.” A written\nwork, however, is different. One can separate the good from the bad,\nwhich is why, he argues, the Rambam was allowed to study the written\nworks of non-Jewish philosophers.</p>\n<p>Rav Shmuel Wosner (Shevet Halevi 3:145), however, prohibited reading\neven the written works of a Torah scholar who acted inappropriately.\nHe assumed they “undoubtedly cause harm.”</p>\n<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>I believe it is important, especially in our day, to raise three\nadditional considerations:</p>\n<p>First, the presence of a disgraced rabbi’s works in our personal and\ncommunity libraries causes a great chillul Hashem and reinforces the\nnotion that the frum community does not properly sanction criminals.</p>\n<p>Second, it is terribly hurtful to the victims of sexual crimes to see\nthe community embrace the scholarship of their attacker.</p>\n<p>Third, continuing to study, cite, or even sell the works of a wayward\nrabbi sends a message, even if unintentional, that one who commits a\nhorrible crime can continue to be a respected member of the community.\nOne who sees the works of a sexual predator, or a criminal convicted\nof financial crimes, on the shelves of our homes and sefarim stores\nmay conclude that we are not fully committed to ridding our\ncommunities of these people. This concern – of sending the wrong\nmessage to others – is why we burn a Sefer Torah written by a heretic:\n“in order not to make a name for the heretics or their deeds” (Rambam,\nHilchos Yesodei HeTorah 6:8).</p>\n<p>For the reasons cited above, I believe it’s crucial nowadays to\nproperly distance unrepentant disgraced rabbis and leaders from our\ncommunities, and to discontinue studying and distributing their\nwritten Torah works.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Sdei Chemed <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14154&st=&pgnum=402\" rel=\"nofollow\">maareches haLamed klal 145</a> has a long list of sfarim from Rishonim and Achronim who do not allow one to quote something in the name of a Rabbi  turned heretic. He started off quoting this gemara under discussion.\nHe mentions a Rashba who says this is a measure for measure punishment for someone who doesn't lead his life according to the words of the Chachamim. </p>\n\n<p>Its especially noteworthy that he begins that klal by assuming the opinion that one may <em>read</em> the chidushei  Torah  of a heretic, even though one is not allowed to learn <em>from</em> a heretic. The reason being that written works do not have the same power to draw one after the personality of the writer, as does the spoken word. This is only a hetter to read their Torah of course, not other ideas they write.</p>\n\n\n",

A number of the walkers asked him why he allows this. He answered that he does not explicitly tell them to drive to shul on Shabbat. But, if he excluded them, inevitably, they would drive to the Reform shul in the next neighborhood. There, they would be less likely to be exposed to Shomrei Shabbat & Shomrei Mitzvot people. Thus, in a sense, the rabbi was concerned about <em>kiruv</em>. He felt that by encouraging them to come to his shul, when they see the beauty of the shul and Shabbat, hopefully, on their own, they would become Shomer Shabbat - of course with some assistance from him.</p>\n\n<p>The other two rabbis concurred with his viewpoint, as they had similar problems in their own shuls.</p>\n\n<p>In Rabbi #1's case, because he was in a small community, he stated that if the drivers didn't come on Shabbat, there would be no minyan at all, at in a sense, that would penalize him as well as the other walkers / Shomrei Shabbat people who attend shul. And, then, what would be the point of having his shul in the first place if no one came? I.e. - a firm \"No\" would have repercussions as he feared that to find SOME minyan on Shabbat, the Shomrei Shabbat people would daven in the Conservative or Reform shul. So, should his shul always remain empty on Shabbat while the other shuls \"pick up the slack\"?</p>\n\n<p>The other 2 rabbis agreed with the 1st rabbi's view. As for the rest of the week, ALL 3 shuls have had a problem with getting a minyan, even now. All 3 rabbis are happy when <strong>any</strong> Jew davens with a minyan. He cared enough to daven and he helped others daven with a minyan, esp. those who have to say Kaddish. For many of them saying Kaddish, alone is what makes them attend a minyan in the first place! All 3 rabbis have stated that in the majority of cases, when those that said Kaddish were not Shomer Shabbat, it was directly because of their 11-month experience of attending the minyan daily that many of them became Shomer Shabbat - something that almost certainly would NOT have happened on its own had the rabbi excluded them from the minyan.</p>\n\n<p>And, one rabbi pointed out that while Gentiles are not included in a minyan, they are invited to come to a shul and pray with us, if they wish. So, we should welcome a Gentile, but exclude a non-Shomer Shabbat Jew? (By excluding, he didn't mean that he would expel him from the shul. But he meant that they would exclude themselves because we made them feel unwelcome.)</p>\n\n<p>In brief, I have no direct halachic proof from any of these rabbis. But, I think that their view of kiruv and their insight into solidifying an often weak community by finding some leniency is notable and encouraging.</p>\n\n<p>If you'd like me to inquire further about any specific aspect, inform me as I am very much in contact with 2 of the 3 rabbis.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I learned from Rabbi Mizrachi that the halacha is you can't say amen to the kaddish of a mechalel shabbos, if you have a minyan with 9 shomer shabbos and 1 mechalel shabbos all the brachot you make with minyan are brachot in vain, and it's the halachic equivalent of having a non-Jew as a part of the minyah.  </p>\n\n<p>I asked a Chabad Rabbi, R. Itkin about this, and he said that he did quote the halacha correctly, but this does not apply to people who are considered children captive in war, and Rabbi Mizrachi agrees. So if you have an off the derech guy coming, he is not part of the minyah, but a baal teshuva who's still a beginner of teshuva or someone raised by the reform G-d forbid, his brachot can be said amen to. Furthermore he said that we're not allowed to assume if they drove for a life risk reason or not, I said, \"they tell me they drive because they don't want to walk 10 minutes\", and so he said \"if they are in the davening and have thoughts of teshuva, then they are 100% now and you can say amen to the bracha. I later thought of asking if a mechalel shabbos signs a ketubah, we know this ketubah is worthless, but if he had thoughts of teshuva while signing no?</p>\n\n<p>As for the semi-proof of not davening with an evil doer, yes a willing shabbos violator is considered an evil doer. If he doesn't understand what he's doing really, or was raised like a goy and now it's very hard for him, he is not an evil doer, he's considered dead in his life like one but from how I understood it, closer to lost in darkness than dead. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Anecdotally -- Baltimore's Beth Jacob Congregation broke off from Glen Avenue / Shearith Israel because the latter did not give honors to those who desecrated the Sabbath. (Beth Jacob wanted an Orthodox service that did not discriminate in any way against the not-necessarily-fully-Sabbath-observant.) Before that point, I read it was not uncommon for the <em>shalosh seudos</em> crowd at Shearith Israel to look out the window and see the wives of some members getting off the bus with shopping bags. Shearith Israel's rabbi at the time was R. Shimon Schwab zt\"l, hardly a left-winger. It appears that they were perfectly content to allow the non-Sabbath-observant to be there, though. (I've heard different rumors whether they were counted for a minyan.)</p>\n\n<p>Fun fact -- when Beth Jacob needed a rabbi, they found a young Semicha graduate who was doing his sociology doctorate, a single fellow by the name of Bernard Lander zt\"l; the Schwabs had him over for shabbos meals on occasion.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Three steps forward after daytime amidah (with no minyon)",
    "content": "# Three steps forward after daytime amidah (with no minyon)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Yo, I was wondering if one is required to take three steps forward upon conclusion of any of the day time amidas (or amidahim? Not too good with Hebrew grammar.).  </p>\n\n<p>According to the instructions of the Siddur Tehillas Hashem annotated edition, there is no mention of it in any or the weekday amidas (though it does mention to do it for maariv).</p>\n\n<p>The problem with this is that various rabbis I've talked to say that you DO take three steps forward, even when there's no minyon (although they were unable to provide the source).</p>\n\n<p>So, does such a custom exist? If so, where is it written?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT just to clarify, I'm wondering if this applies only without a minyon because some have the custom to take 3 steps forward specifically for kedusha.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The three steps forward are not for Kedushah. They are to end the status of Amidah, of which you are still connected to in some way while standing back three steps. The Halacha is, that instead of ending it right away we wait until Kedusha, and that if you are by yourself you should wait the time it would take to walk 4 cubits.</p>\n\n<p>When we step back the three steps it is like when you back away from a high official or holy Tzaddik. But you are still in his presence until you walk back. It is this presence that we are trying to not run away from by waiting the cubits or until Kedusha.</p>\n\n<p>The Tur Orach Chayim 123 says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סימן קכג \n  וכורע ופוסע ג' פסיעות לאחוריו ובכריעה אחת ובעודו כורע קודם שיזקוף יטה בראשו לצד שמאלו כמי שבא ליפטר מרבו ואחר כך לימינו דאמר ריב\"ל המתפלל צריך שיפסע ג' פסיעות לאחוריו ואח\"כ יתן שלום ואם לא עשה כן כאילו לא התפלל ויש נוהגין לומר שלום בשמאלי ושלום בימיני עושה שלום במרומיו וכו' וראייתם מהא דאמרינן במסכת יומא משום רבי שמעיה אמרו נותן שלום בימינו ואח\"כ בשמאלו פי' בימינה של שכינה שהיא כנגדו שהוא שמאלו וכ' אבי העזרי שאין לאומרה שאין פירושו שיאמר שלום בימיני וכו' אלא כשאומר עושה שלום במרומיו הופך פניו לצד שמאלו וכשיאמר והוא יעשה שלום הופך פניו לצד ימינו ובמקום שכלו ג' פסיעות יעמוד ולא יחזור מיד למקומו דאיתמר (יומא נג:) משמיה דרב מרדכי כיון שפסע ג' פסיעות לאחריו התם מיבעי ליה למיקם משל לתלמיד שנפטר מרבו שאם חוזר מיד דומה לכלב שב על קיאו שסופו הוכיח על תחילתו שלא פסע לאחוריו כדי ליפטר מרבו כיון שחוזר אליו מיד וכתב רב אלפס מבעי ליה למיקם התם עד דפתח ש\"צ וכד פתח ש\"צ הדר לדוכתיה ואיכא מ\"ד עד דמטי ש\"צ לקדושה : </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the Shulchan Aruch 123 says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סימן קכג </p>\n  \n  <p>{א} כורע ופוסע ג' פסיעות לאחריו בכריעה אחת ואחר שפסע ג' פסיעות בעודו כורע קודם שיזקוף כשיאמר עושה שלום במרומיו והופך פניו לצד שמאלו וכשיאמר הוא יעשה שלום עלינו הופך פניו לצד ימינו ואחר כך ישתחוה לפניו כעבד הנפטר מרבו. הגה: ונהגו לומר אחר כך יהי רצון שיבנה בית המקדש כו' כי התפלה במקום העבודה ולכן מבקשים על המקדש שנוכל לעשות עבודה ממש - דברי עצמו</p>\n  \n  <p>{ב} במקום שכלו ג' פסיעות יעמוד ולא יחזור למקומו עד שיגיע שליח ציבור לקדושה ולפחות עד שיתחיל שליח צבור להתפלל בקול רם. הגה: והשליח ציבור יעמוד כדי הילוך ד' אמות קודם שיחזור למקומו להתפלל בקול רם (תשובת הרשב''א סימן תל''ו). וכן יחיד המתפלל יעמוד במקום שכלו פסיעותיו כשיעור זה קודם שיחזור למקומו (בית יוסף בשם רבינו ירוחם וירושלמי).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the Magen Avraham there writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מג\"א\n  כתב הכ\"מ דאם רוצה עומד שם ואינו חוזר למקומו אבל לפי סברת י\"א הטעם דבעינן ו' פסיעות עב\"י ולכן צריך ג\"כ לפסוע ג' פסיעות לפניו ומהאי טעמא מקפידין שלא יעבור אדם לפניהם בעוד שעומדין שם שלא להפסיק בן הו' פסיעות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Without this Magen Avraham the idea is to go back to your place, but if you take larger steps and can do it in two that shouldn't matter לכאורה. The Magen Avraham is saying, though, that there is a point to taking six steps, three back and three forward. Without this Magen Avraham the idea is to go back to your place, but if you take larger steps that shouldn't matter לכאורה.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I don't think that there is any requirement to take three steps forward.</p>\n\n<p>ואמרי משמיה דרב מרדכי מקום שכלו ג' פסיעות שם צריך ליתן שלום. ואינו צריך לחזור למקום שהתפלל וליתן שלום  </p>\n\n<p>\"And they say in the name of Rabbi Mordecai: At the place where the three steps [back] end, there one needs to 'take leave' and does not\nneed to return to the place he prayed and take leave.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_49492_91.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siddur Rashi, section 39</a></p>\n\n<p>('Take leave' is my attempt to translate 'li-teyn shalom', which is some kind of a gesture of leave-taking. The custom is to bow to one's left and to one's right.)</p>\n\n<p>If you look at the relevant passages in the Gemara and at the halakhot in the Rambam, you see that, at the point where people ended up at the end of the three steps back, they would remain, and would perform supplications at that place while lying face down on the floor.</p>\n\n<p>(Those supplications don't correspond one-to-one to what we do today. They might have something to do with our contemporary 'nefilat appayyim' and/or with the practice of adding the personal supplication 'Elohay Neṣor' to the Amidah and/or with the recitation of the verses of supplication in u-Va le-Ṣiyyon. In any case, if they were done at the point where the three steps back ended, it would seem to preclude the notion of having to return to one's original prayer position.)</p>\n\n\n",

They saw\n  no form or picture of G-d, but they saw many miracles that proved that\n  G-d is the Creator of heaven and earth. They heard G-d's voice speak\n  and command Moses to instruct the Children of Israel on how to prepare\n  to receive the Torah. Then they heard G-d speaking directly to them,\n  the Children of Israel, and commanding them to keep the Torah. The\n  Children of Israel accepted the Torah and all its Commandments, and\n  they said: \"We agree to obey, even before we hear the actual\n  Commandments.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We are told not to believe in miracles; how do we know that the voice of God at Sinai wasn't some magician's ploy to convert the masses and how do we know that the miracles that took place at Sinai were done by God and not some magician?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Two approaches:</p>\n<p><strong>The Unmistakable Nature of Divine Experience</strong></p>\n<p>The Jewish people themselves heard Hashem speak at Har Sinai, on some level of prophecy.

If two people say they can make <em>triak</em> (an ancient mythical panacea), and the first shows you as he makes it that he has all of the ingredients and lets you watch as he puts them together.  Or, he makes it and then tests it and you see that it is effective.  The other person does all kinds of wonderous things like walks through fire and the like, and tells you that as he can do wonderous things, he clearly has some power and you should believe him.  In other words, the second person is asking you to transfer your belief from his wonders to his claims.  The same is true of any prophet viz-a-viz Moshe.  Moshe did not do wonders and, based thereon, ask us to rely on him.  He showed us that Hashem speaks to him.  There is no request for us to transfer our belief from him to his claims.  This direct belief is what distinguishes Moshe from any other prophet, and it is these kinds of indirect beliefs which are subject to doubt.</p>\n<p>In this type of demonstration, the doubt would not be on Moshe's word, but rather on the reliability of our own experiences.  This is the superiority of demonstration which is present in Moshe's credentials as messenger from Hashem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In order to pose such a possibility we would need an example of magic being done in such magnitude. The voice of Hashem was heard by all. It's source couldn't be traced to any one side, according to the Medrash.

Following this was the precise Hashgacha Pratis in the wilderness, where Korach, Dassan and Aviram died for going against the Torah. They had these large scale, foretold miracles that their lives depended on.</p>\n\n<p>Less than a thousand years later was the Galus Bavel, where we ceased to be a unified people. And yet, we held to the Torah. I couldn't make up a large scale story about the main history of the crusades, the Spanish wars and unification and the Magna Carta because they are relatively recent history, within a thousand years.</p>\n\n<p>There were no parallel Judaisms having their own story of origin, although there were two kingdoms in Israel from pretty early on, and after not having a king at all.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to know what a man-made religion would look like you have examples to compare.

    "content": "# How could the whole Torah be given at Sinai?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When we have instances of Moshe not knowing how to answer questions in the Torah. One of which happens in this week's Torah portion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Numbers 9 8 And Moses said unto them: 'Stay ye, that I may hear what\n  the LORD will command concerning you.' {P}</p>\n  \n  <p>ח  וַיֹּאמֶר אֲלֵהֶם, מֹשֶׁה:  עִמְדוּ וְאֶשְׁמְעָה, מַה-יְצַוֶּה\n  יְהוָה לָכֶם.  {פ}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>i can understand the argument that Moshe received so much nevu'ah that he could foretell things, or could write events before they happened, and even those that say he wrote about his own death. However, it doesn't make sense to me that Moshe received every letter, if he then has to ask God to get some answers to questions. A more clear example would be Zelophehad's daughters. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Numbers 27 ג  אָבִינוּ, מֵת בַּמִּדְבָּר, וְהוּא לֹא-הָיָה בְּתוֹךְ\n  הָעֵדָה הַנּוֹעָדִים עַל-יְהוָה, בַּעֲדַת-קֹרַח:  כִּי-בְחֶטְאוֹ מֵת,\n  וּבָנִים לֹא-הָיוּ לוֹ.   3 'Our father died in the wilderness, and he\n  was not among the company of them that gathered themselves together\n  against the LORD in the company of Korah, but he died in his own sin;\n  and he had no sons. ד  לָמָּה יִגָּרַע שֵׁם-אָבִינוּ מִתּוֹךְ\n  מִשְׁפַּחְתּוֹ, כִּי אֵין לוֹ בֵּן; תְּנָה-לָּנוּ אֲחֻזָּה, בְּתוֹךְ\n  אֲחֵי אָבִינוּ.   4 Why should the name of our father be done away from\n  among his family, because he had no son? Give unto us a possession\n  among the brethren of our father.' ה  וַיַּקְרֵב מֹשֶׁה\n  אֶת-מִשְׁפָּטָן, לִפְנֵי יְהוָה.  {פ} 5 And Moses brought their cause\n  before the LORD. {P} ו  וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה, אֶל-מֹשֶׁה לֵּאמֹר. 6 And\n  the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So my question is, if Moshe received \"All the laws of the Torah\" then why is he not able to answer these questions himself, why does he then need to ask God if he already knows the answer? Because to say that he has to inquire from God implies that he doesn't know, and if you were to say he knew but was too humble, then it means he was possibly deceitful.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a dispute in the Gemara as to how and when the content of the Torah was given.  According to Rashi, <em>both</em> opinions hold that the entire text and content of the Torah was not what was given at Har Sinai:</p>\n<p>Gittin 60a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר יוחנן משום רבי בנאה תורה מגילה מגילה ניתנה שנא' (תהלים מ, ח) אז אמרתי הנה באתי במגילת ספר כתוב עלי ר\"ש בן לקיש אומר תורה חתומה ניתנה שנאמר (דברים לא, כו) לקוח את ספר התורה הזאת</p>\n<p>R' Yochanan said in the name of R' B'na'ah \"The Torah was given piece by piece... Reish Lakish said \"the Torah was given sealed...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מגילה מגילה ניתנה - כשנאמרה פרשה למשה היה כותבה ולבסוף מ' שנה כשנגמרו כל הפרשיות חיברן בגידין ותפרן</p>\n<p>Piece by piece - as each section was said to Moshe, he would write it, and at the end of 40 years when all the sections were completed, he connected them with sinews and stitched them</p>\n<p>חתומה ניתנה - לא נכתבה עד סוף מ' לאחר שנאמרו כל הפרשיות כולן והנאמרות לו בשנה ראשונה ושניה היו סדורות לו על פה עד שכתבן</p>\n<p>Sealed - it was not written until the end of the 40 [years], after all of the sections had been said to him, and those which were said to him in the first years remained arranged orally until he wrote them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramban writes the same in his introduction to Bereishis.</p>\n<p>The content of the Torah is not what we refer to when we say that Hashem gave the Torah at Har Sinai.</p>\n<p>The Ramchal in Da'as Tevunos siman 158 s.v. ומה שיש לנו לדעת (p. 170 in Friedlander edition) explains that the the spiritual <em>ability</em> to keep the Torah is what was given to the Jewish people at Har Sinai.  In the following paragraph, ותראי, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותראי כי זה מה שעשה האדון ב\"ה לישראל בהר סיני, שהנה לא נתן להם שם התורה כולה במעמד ההוא, אבל הייתה הכנה כוללת לכל עבודת המצוות... ואז נתן להם תחילה הכוח לשמור כל מצוותיו, ושמעשיהם בעבודתו יעשו הפרי הטוב המצטרך לתיקון הבריאה</p>\n<p>And see, that this is what Hashem did for Yisroel at Har Sinai, as behold He did not give them the entire Torah there in that encounter, but it was the general preparation for the entire <em>avodah</em> of <em>mitzvos</em>... and then He gave them first the ability to keep all the <em>mitzvos</em>, and that their actions in His <em>avodah</em> would have positive effects to repair all of creation...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In footnote [46], R' Chaim Friedlander comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לכן אנו מחיסים את קבלת התורה למעמד הר סיני, אף אל פי שרק חלק מן המצוות ניתן בהר סיני וכו</p>\n<p>And therefore we associate receiving the Torah with the standing at Har Sinai, even though only a fraction of the <em>mitzvos</em> were given at Har Sinai...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the <em>ability</em> to keep Torah, and the spiritual connection to the <em>mitzvos</em> which causes our actions to have cosmic effect, were the \"giving of the Torah\" that are referred to, not the actual content of the <em>mitzvos</em>.</p>\n<p>Reclycled from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/59429/4794\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>He didn't get the Sefer Torah. He got the Torah, the laws. The Sefer Torah was either written in his last day or as things transpired. He learned all the laws during the forty days following Matan Torah, obviously excluding those laws that came up later.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There's a machlokes about כללות נאמרו בסיני (that by sinai moshe only got the 13 ways that you can derive things from torah (יג' מידות שהתורה נדרשת בהם) but not the details of each halacha.) According to this we can answer your question and it also explains many arguments that are found all over shas that affect halacha le'maase (for example rashi and rabbeinu tam's tefilin, times for davening (earliest and latest times) etc) because if all the Torah comes from Hashem and He obviously has one \"opinion\", Moshe received it by har sinai and gave it to yehoshua etc so how did it happen that we have so many opinions about so many basic and fundamental areas of Judaism?</p>\n\n<p>Because Moshe by har sinai only received the general rules of how to learn the torah and from then on the specifics of the mitzvos were learned out through these 13 ways. so one rabbi learned out his opinion with a certain limmud and another rabbi used a different limmud to learn out a differing opinion. </p>\n\n<p>This also explains what it says כל מה שתלמיד ותיק עתיד לחדש ניננה בסיני (any chiddush that someone will be mechadesh in torah was already given to moshe at har sinai.) seemingly this is a contradiction in itself, if it's a chiddush it wasn't given by sinai and if it was given by sinai then its not a chiddush? again we can answer that its takke a chiddush and this that it was given to moshe was only the general paths of learning out different limmudim from torah.</p>\n\n<p>In summary the answer is that Moshe got the general directions of how to learn out the specifics from Torah but he didn't get all the details and therefore when someone asked a question and he \"couldn't\" figure out with which limmud to use to answer the question, he asked Hashem. (The reason for the quotations is because I don't understand how Moshe really didn't know the answer, I'm sure there's a deeper answer to explain this.)</p>\n\n\n",

However, if it is dark or the entire road was filled with barrels, Shimon is exempt.</p>\n<p>Finally, if the entire road is filled with barrels to an extent where it's impossible to pass - even if Shimon broke it with his hands he is exempt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My friend is trying to figure out if this Halacha can be applied to a modern day case. Suppose, Reuven double parks his car illegally on a street. Shimon who is behind him thinks he can squeeze by so he starts inching forward... Except: crunch! Shimon hits Reuven's car and damages it.</p>\n<p>So can we say that this is the same case as one who placed his barrel (car) in such a way as it blocks the street?

That makes sense with the barrel case. The double parked car might be different as it is going to move in two minutes when the passenger gets out, there is no desperate need to make a path. So there would be no allowance to just plow through.</p>\n\n<p>See the next siman about the barrel carriers. If done properly, a person does have the right to hold up the reshus harabim temporarily.

Yet kabbalah continues to be treated as knowledge that is secret and is only appropriate for people to learn after they have reached a certain age and/or attained a certain level of learning. I'd like to understand what the reason is for the continued secrecy. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I heard Rabbi Akiva Tatz explain as follows - People think that \"mysticism\" is a secret means that you don't know it because no one will tell you.  But once you qualify, you'll find an old rabbi in a back alley who will let you in on the secret.  But that isn't what it means that \"mysticism\" is secret - it means that it is by nature <em>not possible to tell</em>.  It is information which cannot be expressed directly from one person to another.  It is only after you have enough of your own understanding that someone can lead you to figure it out on your own.  But it simply isn't possible without the prerequisite training - the words are empty words, and are <em>at best</em> meaningless.</p>\n<p>As the Mishna in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=13&daf=11b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chagiga 11b</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא במרכבה ביחיד אלא אם כן היה חכם ומבין מדעתו</p>\n<p>We do not expound the <em>maaseh merkava</em> even to an individual, unless he is a wise man who understands it from his own awareness</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>it is written in a special code (metaphorical) language so that only those with the necessary introductions and level of torah scholarship can understand it.</p>\n\n<p>so even with all the literature out there, it remains incomprehensible.</p>\n\n<p>see this audio by Rabbi Yaakov Hillel (regarded as one of the top kabalists today) </p>\n\n<p>see: <a href=\"http://audio.ohr.edu/track/id=521\">http://audio.ohr.edu/track/id=521</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The point of hiding it is that it shouldn't end up looking the way it does today.

In a way, it is considered understanding when you at least comprehend how far it is from you. Even if you can't climb the mountain if you see how high it is and you realize how far you are from getting there you are more on target than someone who imagines he is there already.</p>\n\n\n",

Whatever number we have at the end of the entire analysis is the number of mitzvot, and that number can theoretically be anything.</p>\n\n<p>This approach, I believe, resolves all the questions mentioned here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[I]t's clear from the Rishonim that there are more than just 613.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not an issue because R. Simlai was either being imprecise with the number 613, or his opinion was rejected.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[T]here would be only 3 mitzvos from Bereishis to Bo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has nothing to do with R. Simlai. We have to learn through the Torah and Talmud, and if we find mitzvot between Bereishis and Bo then we count them, and if we don't find mitzvot then we don't count them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[T]here would be entire parshiyos (not sidra's) without any mitzvos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Same as above – we learn through each parsha, and if we find mitzvot then we count them, and if we don't find mitzvot then we don't count them. It is not R. Simlai's fault if the Torah does not say anything that can be construed as a mitzvah in an entire parsha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One factor that may have an influence on the count of mitzvos is that some mitzvos are included in others.\nFor example, the ShLO hakadosh writes (I think on Pesachim ) that the  chessed associated mitzvos like hachnosas orchim, bikur cholim, levayas hamess  are included in veholachta bidrochav </p>\n\n\n",

This is based on the idea that a ruach ra (evil spirit) appears on used water that is spilled onto the ground. However, if the water is poured into a utensil, vessel or even onto a pile of twigs which is on the ground, there is no danger of inviting a ruach ra.</p>\n<p>I have found only a small number of references in the sources to removing the water, and no mention at all of the need to cover it. One halachic authority who refers to removing the water is the Kaf HaChayim Soffer (181:8). He quotes the Kaf HaChayim Palache (25:3) who says that if one does not have a special bowl for mayim achronim, or is too lazy to get the particular bowl, one can pour it into a food bowl, but then should be careful to remove it from the table before bentching. Why the need to remove it? According to the kabbalistic interpretation of the Kaf HaChayim Soffer, mayim achronim is an “offering” to the sitra achra—the “other side”—and therefore, must be removed. (This notion of the sitra achra is also mentioned by Rav Palache in the name of the Yalkut Reuvani, who states that Iyov (Job) suffered because he neglected to perform mayim achronim.) Thus, it seems that the only poskim (halachic authorities) who maintain that the water should be removed are those who are of the opinion that mayim achronim constitutes an offering to “the other side.” As already seen, however, most authorities draw on the Talmudic view that mayim achronim is for the sole purpose of cleanliness. Thus, according to the majority of halachic authorities, there is no basis for removing the water.</p>\n<p>Many people mistakenly believe that the water must be removed due to the presence of a ruach ra. This misconception is dealt with in the Siddur Tslusa d’Avraham, where the commentary Shirusa d’Avraham (page 362) states that since there is no danger of inviting a ruach ra if the water is poured into a utensil, there is no reason to remove the water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Therefore, \"a bicycle is muktza, as ... it is a <em>kli shem'lachto l'issur</em>.\" (from that answer)</p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/7482/5151\">there is a minority opinion</a> (that of the Ben Ish Chai) that permits riding on Shabbat within an eiruv for leisure, and even outside an eiruv for a mitzvah. Obviously, a bike is not muktzah according to this opinion. A comment on the answer linked mentions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My wife told me that in the Syrian community in Brooklyn they ride bicycles on Shabbat, and that they base it on the Ben Ish Chai's position. –  <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/2205/robert-s-barnes\">Robert S. Barnes</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is the muktzah status of a bike if there are two people spending Shabbat together, one of whom holds it is forbidden (henceforth: the <em>machmir</em>), and one who holds it's permissible (hencforth: the <em>meikel</em>)? I'll present a few different cases.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If the bike belongs to the <em>machmir</em>, may the <em>meikel</em> ride it? Does it make a difference whether or not they were together, or planning as much, at the beginning of Shabbat?

As above, does it make a difference whether or not they were (planning to be) together at the beginning of Shabbat?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This may not be the answer you want to hear but here goes.</p>\n\n<p>The only time ownership plays a role in the laws of muktzah is when we are discussing something which is muktzah due to being unusable. And even that has specific details.</p>\n\n<p>See the very end of hilchos muktzah in Orach Chaim 308 52 with Mishna Berurah. A useless item to a rich man is muktzah to him. It is therefore muktzah for poor people as well. M.B. points out this is specifically because this muktzah is dependant on the mindset of the owner. The opposite is true as well. If the poor man is the owner, it is not muktzah, and the rich man can move it as well.</p>\n\n<p>He goes on to quote Magen Avraham who says this law has nothing to do with something which is unusable  to the owner due to a vow he made, this would be muttar for everyone in the world to move, and even the owner can move it, being that it is allowed to be used by anyone else in the world( I assume he means that the owner was not mikatzeh the item in his mind due to this reality). Whereas if he made it assur to the whole world with his vow, it is now assur to be moved by anyone. </p>\n\n<p>The Pri Migadim at the end of the siman discusses how this pertains to Nolad which can be effected by having Daas on something.</p>\n\n<p>It is very telling that all types of muktzah under discussion are muktzah which have to do with a person's decisions about a given object. </p>\n\n<p>A case of muktzah which is due to a gezeira of sorts have nothing to do with ownership or consciousness of the owner. This is a person's religious leader saying 'Don't touch that! You might use it!' This has nothing to do with ownership. </p>\n\n<p>Think about it. If the premise of the question was true, any kli shemilachto l'issur of a nonjew would be allowed to be moved, this is something which should have been explicit, but it is an idea that we don't find. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there are a number of items which were disputed between the Mechaber and the Ramma as to whether they are muktzah or not. A ball for instance. No one said that a Sfardi can play with a ball which belongs to an Ashkenazi. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does the Torah 'know' about 'quantum mechanics' and 'DNA synthesis'?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are many articles and books available on the interplay between science and Judaism. Very often they come in the form of a halachic discussion of applying science to be able to resolve a halachic issue e.g. medical ethics (see techumin series for a whole collection of such essays). This avenue of interplay is useful, because the interplay directly sheds light on one another i.e. in terms of halachic decisions.</p>\n\n<p>There is another area of interplay - in the realm of the esoteric and mystical, whereby science and Torah cannot be literally resolved. Often, in the form of 'sensationalist writing', authors will try to fit science into an esoteric understanding of Judaism. I will give an bad example in order to prove my point. <a href=\"http://torahscience.org/natsci/Rabbi_Akiba_and_quantum_mechanics.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article</a> asserts that the periodic table is found in the Torah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Akiva first identified and then elevated all the water parts of reality, the\n  hydrogen element. In chemistry itself, hydrogen is no. 1 the most abstract of all elements.\n  Hydro means water and hydrogen is the essential component of water, the oxygen part is\n  the air element that we breathe but the hydrogen element of water is the water element.\n  Even in chemistry, all elements are just composites of the hydrogen atom because\n  hydrogen is one, one proton and one electron, and all others are just additional atoms of\n  hydrogen, as it were.*</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I often read sensationlist essays like this and think \"is there any gain in doing something like this\"? Is it a legitimate approach to take a theory in science and give a Jewish esoteric spin on the topic, even if it is never mentioned anywhere in scripture?</p>\n\n<p>There is an interesting passage in <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1592643094\" rel=\"nofollow\">Torah Umadda</a> by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Lamm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Norman Lamm</a> which sheds light on this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...The view some ascribe to the Gaon, that there is no autonomous wisdom outside of Torah, because all is contained in Torah, would leave committed contemporary Jews profoundly perplexed. No amount of intellectual legerdemain or midrashic pyrotechnics - or even sophisticated but capricious computer analyses of sacred texts - can convince us that the Torah somehow possesses within itself the secrets of quantum mechanics, the synthesis of DNA, and the like...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Do we have poetic license to invent otherwise non-existent connections between science and Torah, or does the Torah really 'know' about these things? There is an understanding that Hashem's 'unity' (including a revelation in His creation) will be revealed in the end of days - in what form will this revelation come?</p>\n\n<p>*inaccuracies and non-truths in the quoted article: what is 'most abstract'? Hydrogen is not a fundamental particle in any case, and, as science understands it, was not the initial building blocks of the universe. 'Hydro' - the latin meaning of a word doesn't impinge on any Jewish importance, so far as I'm aware. Hydrogen is as essential as Oxygen, in water - not as asserted by the author. \"All elements\" are certainly NOT composites of hydrogen; in fact, all elements (except from hydrogen) contain neutrons... etc. etc.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I'm not sure what you mean by \"the Torah\" knowing. The Torah was given from Hashem, and He is obviously aware of how He made the world. The Torah won't be saying something that is not true.

Therefore, it follows that everything we find in the world should be traced back into the Torah in some way. Just like we put Halacha into a Pasuk, we put other truths into the Pasuk if we can. It is a form of Drush where we aren't quite searching to find an answer, but rather we know the lesson and are trying to find a source.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Torah is the blueprint for the entire creation and therefore contains everything in it.

When Moshiach comes, he will reveal a new dimension to the Torah we already have.  This level of the Torah is called the Torah of Atik and corresponds to the razin d'razin.</p>\n\n<p>As we get closer to geula and Moshiach we are getting closer to this level of Torah and certain aspects of it are being revealed now. A good mashal for this is quantum tunneling - it's impossible for an atom one one side of a barrier to get to the other side, yet due to probabilities, it can get to the other side.  In the nimshal, some of the concepts of this future Torah are making their way into our pre-geula world.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know about the specific examples your bring - I don't know if they are good Torah or good science.

They were righteous men who wound up rationalizing that it would be better for Bnai Yisrael to remain in the desert, living a miraculous life. Once they started rationalizing, they started down a slippery slope that led to their bringing a \"bad report\". Another point is that they allowed themselves to be panicked as it says in 13:33 </p>\n\n<p>לג  וְשָׁם רָאִינוּ, אֶת-הַנְּפִילִים בְּנֵי עֲנָק--מִן-הַנְּפִלִים; וַנְּהִי בְעֵינֵינוּ כַּחֲגָבִים, וְכֵן הָיִינוּ בְּעֵינֵיהֶם.</p>\n\n<p>33 And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.'</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch at the beginning of the parsha points out that they were not the official leaders of the tribes, but people who were regarded with respect within the individual tribes. After all, the actual nesi'im were considered \"too old\" to actually go on such a trip. Thus, they sent \"young\" men who would be more able to deal with the trip and also would be able to find the areas of the land most appropriate for the each tribe.</p>\n\n<p>In answer to your question about how Yehoshua could send spies lies in the difference between the two missions. The group that Moshe sent was more like a congressional junket and the meraglim were more like the chief staffers. Thus, the meraglim could not sneak around and attempt to find out things. The stood out as Bnai Yisrael and were noticed immediately. They came back and delivered their \"report\" in public as well as inserting their own interpretations. Had they just given \"just the facts\" the people would not have panicked and Moshe Rabbeinu could have sent them in with no problems.</p>\n\n<p>Calev and Yehoshua were under extreme pressure to join in on the consensus so as to issue the \"compromise\" report. It would have been like some of the congressional committes that generate a report for the congress. It is very hard to attempt to maintain the minority report. Consider how Obamacare passed into law.</p>\n\n<p>Yehoshua sent Kalev and Pinchas who hat already proven themselves able to resist the pressure and maintain the truth. He sent them secretly (undercover) and they reported to him alone. This would be like a CIA mission reporting back to the head of the agency only or like an OSS mission to Europe during the war. They reported the exact facts, recruited Rachav and made sure that no-one else knew what was being done.</p>\n\n<p>Yehoshua sent Kalev and Pinchas in the same way that an army sends scouts ahead (Just as the tribes settling the East Bank went ahead as the initial scouts and front lines). That is, he knew that Banai Yisrael were supposed to fight \"b'derech tevah\" (according to the normal way of fighting). Thus he sent professionals ahead of the army to determine the best path, to see if the enemy was waiting with troops, and were to attack first. The cloud and the fire would no longer be available to show were to go. He already knew that Hashem would help them, but he had to show hishtadlus.</p>\n\n<p>The reason and method behind Kalev and Pinchas was completely different from that of the meraglim. That is why I compared them to the OSS missions sent to Europe during the war. The decision to cross and attack had already been made. The report (to Yehoshua alone) would not change that. It would only help determine the methodology that would be used after they crossed and were moving to conquer the land.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/ravfrand/5771/shlach.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Yud-Hay\" Will Save You from the Counsel of the Spies</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We recently mentioned the opinion of the Zohar that the problem of the\n  Meraglim was that they fell victim to the disease of \"negius\"\n  [conflict of interest].

In Moshe's time the Torah refers to the spies as \"תרים\" and with Yehoshua the lashon is \"מרגלים\". The difference being that a תר tends to focus on the positive, namely how good the land is etc. whereas a מרגל looks to the negative i.e. the weaknesses of such a territory. This had implications in each case. In the case of Moshe, each tribe had to send its own representative to pass judgement to truly determine that it was good for them. However, in the case of Yehoshua, the spies are not listed by name. The decision to conquer the land was already in place. Thus, the exercise was just to scope out the land to see the weak points and thereby guarantee a successful operation.</li>\n<li>Yehoshua's spies was a covert operation whereas the spies in Moshe's time was much more public with the Jewish nation waiting for them to report back. If Yehoshua's spies came back with a negative report they would have reported solely to him which would have allowed Yehoshua to act without any national fallout.</li>\n<li>Finally, the spies in Moshe's time were spying out the entire land of Israel whereas the spies of Yehoshua were only focusing on Yericho and the surrounding area.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The spies that Moshe Rabbeinu sent, although he wasn't aware, were sent with bad intentions. The people didn't trust that the land was great, but to Moshe they told a different story. Therefore some say (I do not recall who, right now) that since the Halacha is that a messenger has the status of the one who sent him, they got evil thoughts. On the other hand, Yehoshua initiated the idea of the spies that he sent.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, these spies were sent with questions to answer. Moshe Rabbeinu, being sure of the land's greatness, told them to report about the nature of the land. They got it into their head to be true reporters and to objectively judge the land without any preconceived notions from what Hashem said about it.</p>\n\n<p>Yehoshua and Kalev, through their righteousness saw everything through the real truth, that they knew to be absolutely true. It turns out that these two were the only ones to see things correctly, that the land is fruitful, and that the inhabitants are healthy, and that Hashem kept them preoccupied. On the other hand, those who threw away truth in the name of 'objective truth' — which is actually unguided truth — saw a very narrow view and fit all else into that view.</p>\n\n<p>Yehoshua sent tried and tested men. Not just were they great in insight and purity, but they were proven to be fully loyal to Hashem. What was holy to Hashem was holy to them and what was detested by Hashem was hated by them.</p>\n\n<p>When these two spied in Yericho, their whole experience was to be chased into hiding and escape, while striking a deal. And yet, they saw much past that. They reported that all the people are terrified of them. </p>\n\n<p>The Medrash calls the 10 spies, fools. This is because they didn't see things correctly.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>To summarize the above, there are two distinctions between those of the Midbar and those of Yehoshua. First is the intention of the actual senders. Second is that Kalev and Pinchas were trusted, tried, and tested.</p>\n\n<p>But a very basic answer is that just because someone, or even a group, fell through with something, that doesn't mean it is an irresistible pitfall. Moshe Rabbeinu wasn't afraid to go up for the second forty days.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the Meraglim didn't go unnoticed. They had to stick around an extra 38 years because of that. Believe me the lesson was learned. Moshe Rabbeinu brought it up at every opportunity. It wasn't going to happen again.</p>\n\n\n",

What about Sephardi?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Ashkenaz and Sfard are modern divisions based on where those groups lived during the time of the galus (exile). They have nothing to do with the original division into the twelve tribes. Consider that after the revolt against Rechav'am (son of Shlomo Hamelech) many members of the twelve tribes resettled in Yehudah because they maintained loyalty to Hashem. After the dispersion of the ten tribes, more of them fled to Yehudah. After the destruction of the two temples many lost the identity of their original tribes. </p>\n\n<p>The term Sephardi means \"Spanish\" and results from the expulsion from Spain in 1492. That is why others (such as the Yemenite Jews) are called Eidot Hamizrach (the Eastern Communities).</p>\n\n<p>Ashkenaz means Germany (though it includes Northern and western Europe) and after the expulsions of Europe they basically settled in Eastern Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Other communities became mixed with these two main groups. Since the Shulchan Aruch and the Ramah's gloss became the main halachic standard, they are the two groups that are most known.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Apperentaly, yes, the Ashkenazi Jews are (part of) the Tribe of Judah (which is the source of the word \"Jew\", in Hebrew \"יהודה\" is the Tribe of Judah and \"יהודי\" is Jewish) and the Tribe of Binyamin (those two tribes were not exiled with the rest of Bnei Yisrael). And so are the Spheradic Jews.</p>\n<p>In Addition, the Tribe of Levi was disperssed and assimilated within the other tribes and thus, when we lost contact with the Ten Lost Tribes, a portion of Levi members remained with Judah.</p>\n<p><strong>However</strong>: in Targum Yonatan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.49.8?lang=bi&with=Targum%20Jonathan%20on%20Genesis&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis, 49, 8</a>) he writes that the blessing to Yehuda included that all the tribes be named after him, and some say that from the Tefila in Parashat Haneseiim of the month Nissan it is implied that it is unknown. Furthermore, some claim that the Ashkenazi Jews are might in fact the decendants of the ten tribes and they \"prove\" that claim from the Book of Obadiah (end of chapter 1) which is the Haftara of Parashas VaYishlach. It is seems to be opinion of the Aruch and the Maharshal (on the Gemara Yevamos, page 17). And you can find more info in the book \"וַאֲשֶׁר תָּבֹאנָה יַגִּידוּ\".</p>\n\n\n",

May I do so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The seffer Maadanei HaShulchan in סימן פ׳ט s.v. 33 & 34  says that the תבשיל של בשר and תבשיל של גבינה which are subject to the minhag to be treated as real meat and milk as far as waiting goes, are specifically referring to תבשיל which do not have ששים and therefore do have טעם of whichever מין Is under discussion.</p>\n\n<p>At a surface glance he does not seem to directly source this idea from earlier works.</p>\n\n<p>But it seems that this is assumed. See Beis Yosef Orach Chaim 173 in the name of Rabeinu Tam who explains תבשיל של בשר as only having טעם. He also quotes הגהות מיימוני using this idea and saying therefore רוטב של בשר which is מושך טעם would be problematic. This point is brought in Taz in Yoreh Deah ad loc #5. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When explaining the concept of <em>batel bshishim</em> and <em>ain mevatel l'chatchilah</em>, the star-k gives the sources and explanations of these concepts. <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-ABISSELBITUL.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">UNDERSTANDING BATEL B’SHISHIM (One-Sixtieth)</a> However, the article deals with the actual mixing and whether or not it is kosher. The case given in the question could be derived from the analysis. Since the dairy (or meat) is <strong>not</strong> nullified, it is treated as if the second product is fully dairy (or meat). <strong>Thus, just as the mixture is asur, the second product must not be eaten within the forbidden time period.</strong></p>\n\n<p>However, based on the details of the case and the specific circumstances in the involved, there are various leniences that can be applied. However, the case as the OP describes it does not appear to have those leniences. For example, the description of \"<a href=\"http://www.cor.ca/view/183/what_does_dairy_equipment_mean.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dairy Equipment</a> shows that while it can be eaten after a meat meal, it is <strong>not</strong> the case of the question.</p>\n\n<p>The answers which deal with nonkosher also explain the circumstances that would apply with meat and dairy and when <strong>intensional</strong> bitul will apply. That is, just as putting a drop of milk into a meat pot would or would not allow bitul, eating a food with a certain amount of dairy in it after a meat meal would or would not be allowed.</p>\n\n<p>However, the main discussion on this matter would seem to involve the DE marking on some foods. The star-k link could be followed if needed.</p>\n\n<p>As seen in the dairy equipment explanation from the COR, it is only allowed if there is <strong>no</strong> dairy whatsoever in the food being considered.This implies that if there is anything dairy in the second food (which would not be batel l'chatchilah because it is a deliberate ingredient) it cannot be eaten after a meat meal and would not be batel.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As stated above, the pareve designation demarcates a product as having\n  neither diary nor meat ingredients. The DE designation which stands\n  for “Dairy Equipment” means that a hot product, while pareve in its\n  essence, has been manufactured using equipment that was also used to\n  manufacture hot dairy products where no kosherization occurred in\n  between. It is important to note that a thorough cleaning of the\n  equipment still occurs between production runs and there is absolutely\n  no dairy products contained in an item labeled DE. Thus, from the\n  standpoint of the kosher consumer, if someone has just completed a\n  meat meal, he may then eat a product labeled DE. He cannot however eat\n  something labeled DE during a meat meal. Some rabbis however are\n  stricter in this regard and consulting with one’s own rabbi for\n  personal guidance is always advisable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/cons-faqs-status.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">star-k</a> points out only items marked DE can be eaten in less than six hours and as the COR emphasizes, no item marked DE will have <strong>any</strong> dairy products in it.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, from reading the COR description,\nI would consider the sources involving a dairy product or a nonkosher product to a meat dish (making the meat dish nonkosher if deliberately added in a batel amount) similar to the halacha of eating a kosher food that has a deliberately added dairy ingredient. Thus, the analysis of if the second dish can be eaten would be similar to whether or not the mixture is forbidden.</p>\n\n\n",

For evidence, we can see that R\"G did not directly quote from the Torah when he said \"אֲמַר לֵיהּ, כְּתִיב לַן: בִּמְקוֹם בְּרָא, בְּרַתָּא לָא תֵּירוֹת\" - he was merely paraphrasing from \"אִישׁ כִּי יָמוּת וּבֵן אֵין לוֹ וְהַעֲבַרְתֶּם אֶת נַחֲלָתוֹ לְבִתּוֹ\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.27.8?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 27:8</a>). However, the sectarian still mimicked R\"G's wording when passing judgement, in both cases. And since he ruled differently depending who bribed him, I would say that he invented this \"quote\" as a basis for his favoring first Imma Shalom and later R\"G. This understanding is different than the way Herford, at least, read the text (in terms of who said what). I don't know why he thought he would get away with it, although it is noticeable that he is unaware who the Nasi, R\"G, and his sister are - so it seems that in his mind, he could get away with anything here.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Halévy bases this on a book called <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_PjPnbf0hQ30C/page/n63/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Philonea</a>, which brings Philo in Greek.

    "content": "# How complicated can a vesst pattern be?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Background: In the laws of <em>niddah</em> there is something called a <em>vesst haflaga</em>, which is a period that occurs at some consistent interval.  If a woman establishes a pattern for some amount of consecutive periods, there are various halachic stringencies and leniencies that result from assuming that this pattern will continue.</p>\n\n<p>The most straightforward occurrence of such a pattern would be if a woman had her period at equidistant times, i.e. day 1, 31, 61, 91 (30 days apart).  However, it can follow more complicated patterns, such as an incrementally increasing pattern (1, 30, 60, 91 ...) (S.A. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5498\">Y.D. 189:5</a>).  The pattern can also consist of a repeating series, such as 25 - 26 - 27 - 25 - 26 - 27 - 25 - 26 - 27, in which the pattern of 25 days later, followed by 26 days later, followed by 27 days later is repeated 3 times, and that whole series becomes the assumed pattern (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5498\">Y.D. 189:8</a>).</p>\n\n<p>My question is, how complicated can such a pattern be?  Can it be a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number\">Fibonacci Sequence</a>?  Can it be ascending perfect squares?  Do the numbers need to be mappable by a polynomial function (as opposed to, say, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_for_primes\">set of prime numbers</a>*)?</p>\n\n<p>*I'm not so interested in debating the mathematical claim</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Badei Hashulchan 189:5 (שבכל ענין) asks this question. His case is where it gets bigger by an extra day each time. He remains with the question, צ\"ע.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nAs for Fibonacci, the Mechaber in 189:10 has a case of 15,16,18 and says that since the last one jumped one more there is no <em>vesst</em>. The Shach there says that this would be the case even if there was a <em>vesst kavua</em> on the 14th beforehand. </p>\n\n<p>This shows us that we do not set a <em>vesst</em> of a Fibonacci pattern, since we now have 14,15,16,18. According to the Fibonacci pattern she should be <em>choshesh</em> on the 21st of the next month.</p>\n\n\n",

For example someone who sets fire to an object on Shabbat and gets stoned to death for it does not have to compensate the damage too.</p>\n\n<p>You might be asking, why not tzaraat \"instead\" of death (rather than as-well-as).

In a way tzaraat is a kind of \"severe warning\" to someone to change their ways and a public disgrace to them, for themselves having caused harm to someone else with their words.\nIn this case, as they had caused an entire generation to sin and lose the right to go into Eretz Yisrael, it was probably too much for one week outside the camp.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>They spoke Loshon Hara about Eretz Yisrael.

I am asking especially in how it relates to God.</p>\n\n<p>I.e. what does \"tov\" mean and what does it mean that God is \"tov\"? </p>\n\n<p>An example where God is ascribed \"tov\" is in <em>Derech Hashem</em> <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/mekorot/1b-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ch.2</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובהיותו הוא לבדו יתברך הטוב האמיתי, לא יסתפק חפצו הטוב אלא בהיותו מהנה\n  לזולתו בטוב ההוא עצמו שהוא בו יתברך מצד עצמו, שהוא הטוב השלם והאמיתי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(\"in that He alone is the true good...\")</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I am addressing what it means that G-d is \"tov\", and particularly how to understand the quote from Derech Hashem (along with other such quotes).  The following is as was explained to me by a close student of R' Yaakov Hillel and R' Nochum Lansky (both noted and recognized in the world of Kabbalah), as well as made explicit in R' Chaim Friedlander's notes to Da'as Tevunos, Iyunim [2] and [19].</p>\n\n<p>G-d in His essence has no positive attributions. He has no limitations and no definitions.  The <em>only</em> thing that we can know about the nature of His essence is that it is שלם (Derech Hashem 1:1:2).  Furthermore, all <em>middos</em> (attributes or characteristics) that we ascribe to Hashem are only a description of how He acts in the world, and not a description of His essence, which cannot be limited by such things (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/60446/4794\">source and translation</a>).</p>\n\n<p>This extends to any description of attributes that one might apply to Hashem, including His being \"good.\"  \"Good\" happens to be distinct from other <em>middos</em> of Hashem, in terms of it being the most primary רצון (will) at play in creation, but even \"good\" and the desire to do good were in themselves things that Hashem created and chose to employ. Thus the Ramchal always uses terms such as מה שנוכל להשיג (that which we are capable of grasping)(Da'as Tevunos Siman 18) and מה שנודע לנו (that which has been made known to us)(Klalei Pischei Chochma V'Da'as Klal Aleph) when discussing these concepts.</p>\n\n<p>Some read the words מחוק הטוב להטיב and think this means that Hashem is, in His essence, defined as being \"good\" and therefore \"must\" do good, or does good as a result of being good. In addition to ascribing specific limiting qualities to Hashem's essence, this is also a violation of Hashem's <em>kadmus</em>, which puts Hashem as preceding <em>any</em> other existence or concept, and being completely unbound in His רצון (sourced <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/59923/4794\">here</a>). R' Yaakov Weinberg was very happy about the publication of the R' Friedlander Da'as Tevunos for clarifying exactly this very dangerous misunderstanding.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, what it means that G-d \"is\" good is that the most basic and underlying רצון that Hashem created and chose to act with in creating the world was \"good.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>From what I understand God is not good in the sense that anything else is. For example when I say \"that piece of chocolate cake is good\" I might mean well constructed, or tasty, or visually appealing etc. Judaism holds that the very definition of 'good' <em>is</em> God. The Rambam states this fairly explicitly when he describes the 'good' that is hidden away for the righteous as being \"deriving pleasure from the splendor of God's presence\". The Ramchal in 138 Entrances to Wisdom likewise indicates that the greatest 'good' is God and therefore the greatest gift God can give to others is to give of Godself.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Based on malbim Torah v'mitzva shemos 20:12 - Tov is a human reference term which is used to mean \"as opposed to ra\". The discussion comes up by the first set of luchos, which as the gemara points out , is lacking the letter 'tes'. The 'tes' represents Tov and the gemara has a peculiar back and forth trying to figure out why that is. </p>\n\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"http://thoughtsonparsha.blogspot.com/2014/01/parshas-yisro-ten-commandments.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thoughtsonparsha.blogspot.com/2014/01/parshas-yisro-ten-commandments.html?m=1</a>)</p>\n\n\n",

(אמר) ר' חייא בר אבא א''ר יוחנן ראה הקדוש ברוך הוא שצדיקים מועטין עמד ושתלן בכל דור ודור שנא' {שמואל א ב-ח} כי לה' מצוקי ארץ וישת עליהם תבל</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Rav Chiya bar Abba said in the name of Rebbi Yochanan, Hakadosh Baruch Hu saw that the righteous are few, so He went ahead and sprinkled some in each generation.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Medrash in Vayeira Parsha 48:14:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי סימון קפצו מלאכי השרת לקטרגו אמרו לפניו רבון העולמים אדם שהוא עתיד להמית את בניך בצמא אתה מעלה לו באר אמר להם עכשיו מה הוא צדיק או רשע אמרו לו צדיק אמר להם איני דן את האדם אלא בשעתו קומי שאי את הנער</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Rebbi Simon taught, [when Yishmael was sick and Hashem decided to help him,] the angels jumped to prosecute him.

Hashem said, \"I only judge a person in his time [as he is].

And I also understand that <em>n'ttilath yadhayim</em> requires a <em>k'li</em> and <em>koah nothen</em> (and clean, unused water etc., ibid.), but my question is if clean hands is the goal, then why wouldn't washing one's hands under a faucet work? What is the point of all of the particulars listed in the <em>halakha</em> if not to ensure a useful amount of clean, flowing water that then ensures clean hands? Doesn't a modern faucet effect that in the same way as - and in many respects better than - <em>n'ttilath yadhayim</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <em>Arukh Hashulhan</em> discusses this issue in detail in <em>Orah Haim 4</em>. Your assumption is indeed correct; when clean hands are the only goal, such as when you scratch your head or the like, using a faucet or other flowing water would be fine, if not preferable to using a vessel. However, the <em>netilah</em> prior to eating bread and before <em>shacharith</em> involve other considerations. Washing before bread was originally instituted for <em>kohanim</em> only and was simply extended to others so as not to differentiate between people. Washing in the morning is due to cleanliness as well as to get rid of <em>ruah ra</em> and because we are considered new creations upon waking after a night's sleep. It is disputed amongst the <em>Rishonim</em> what exactly is required in these cases, and what suffices when one does not have access to the ideal resources.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi J.B. Soloveitchik (Reshimot Shiurim, Berakhot p. 202) suggests that whether one requires a vessel for hand washing prior to bread depends on a dispute between Rambam and Ra'avad in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=10534\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchot She'ar Avot Ha-Tum'ot 8:8</a>. Ra'avad there extends the law of washing hands for ritual purity to all hand washing, but Rambam implies that this reason extends only to terumah. Therefore, according to Ra'avad, one must use a vessel when washing for bread, because the reason is not just cleanliness, but removing ritual impurity of the hands. But according to Rambam, it seems that a vessel may not be necessary. Furthermore, Rambam in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=1017\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchot Berachot 6:2</a> seems to equate hand washing prior to bread with hand washing for prayer; in this case, when one has no vessel one may use any substance that cleans (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=15&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berachot 15a</a>). </p>\n\n\n",

A question came up regarding how to pronounce certain words that have a shewa following a conversive waw, and whether or not that shewa should be a shewa na or shewa nach. People fell into two camps regarding this issue, and the Rabbi said that there are grammarians who support each view. Does anyone here know the arguments for both these sides? And which grammarians support which pronunciation?</p>\n<p>For example וַיְחִי - some people pronounce it Waychi, and others pronounce it Wa-yechi</p>\n<p><em>EDIT</em> There is no meteg, and no dagesh in the yodh.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וַיְחִ֤י</strong> יַעֲקֹב֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם שְׁבַ֥ע עֶשְׂרֵ֖ה שָׁנָ֑ה וַיְהִ֤י יְמֵֽי־יַעֲקֹב֙ שְׁנֵ֣י חַיָּ֔יו שֶׁ֣בַע שָׁנִ֔ים וְאַרְבָּעִ֥ים וּמְאַ֖ת שָׁנָֽה׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think the most common iteration of the conversive waw with a yodh is וַיְדַבֵּר.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>(Taken from my answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/144055/32959\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>In the default form of Vav Hahippukh, the second letter takes a dagesh, indicating that it is geminated (doubled). For example, see the words וַיֹּאמֶר, וַיִּקְרָא, וַיַּעַל, and any instance of a feminine word with Vav Hahippukh (like וַתֹּאמֶר).</p>\n<p>The tradition for niqqud that we have today comes from the Tiberian Masoretes. They invented the niqqud symbols in order to record the pronunciation of תנ״ך, so that no vowels or gemination would be mixed up or lost. However, by the time they came around, many natural changes had already taken place over the millennia between them and הר סיני. One of these changes was that, probably due to normal quickness of speech, some “weak” letters that used to have gemination, had lost their gemination.</p>\n<p>One such example is that, on a masculine word, if the vowel under the י in Vav Hahippukh has a Shva, the dagesh is removed. Thus, words like וַיְהִי, וַיְחִי, וַיְחַל, and וַיְכֻלּוּ do not have a dagesh on the י, and the י is not doubled.</p>\n<p>Shva is only pronounced if it comes under a letter with Dagesh, or if it comes after a long vowel (usually). In this case, neither point is true: The י comes after a Patach, which is a short vowel, and the י lacks a dagesh. Therefore, the Shva is silent.</p>\n<p>This does not mean, however, that pronouncing the Shva as na` would be halachically wrong:<br />\nFirstly, Shva is only pronounced in some cases because of tradition, remnants of another vowel that was lost to time, or because pronouncing the word would be difficult otherwise. But really, both the pronounced and silent Shva mark the lack of a vowel. Pronouncing a Shva or keeping it silent won’t (usually) change a word’s meaning.<br />\nSecondly, as stated above, historically the י was geminated, so pronouncing it as such cannot be considered incorrect (this is especially true since in other cases, the י retains the dagesh even to this day). So if you forget that this י doesn’t have a dagesh, then realize your mistake after you read it, it’s completely fine. There’s no point in re-reading the word.</p>\n\n\n",

If the school tells the parents how critical the situation is, that alone will make the parents look for other schools, and by the additional loss of tuition the school will for sure close. Yet if they do not tell the parents the situation and continue to try to find the big donor they need, they may be forced to close right before school starts and thus the parents may be stuck without a school for their children.

By withholding the truth, you are implicitly letting the parents believe there is a school they can go to, and you are preventing the parents from having the information they need to make the decisions for their children.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a businessman trying to get investors into his business. And they initially are willing to invest because it seems like there will be a larger investor to make the business secure.

The Orthodox position that the Torah we have today is the same as it was given to Moses refers to the <em>content</em> of the Torah.  Our <em>Sifrei Torah</em> display a diversity of styles with regard to the script and are not presumed to be visually identical with the original Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, while there is traditional support for the academic position that the current script used was adopted at a later period I do not believe the evidence is so conclusive as to rule out the more \"conservative\" tradition that our script dates back to Sinai.  While it would probably be more appropriate from a <em>dispassionate</em> academic standpoint to adopt the former position, I do not see any reason that a private individual should find it strong enough to overwhelm a viewpoint received through tradition.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -7)\n\n<p>It's a good question, and I think the answer is much more pragmatic than you might think:</p>\n\n<p><strong>It has no practical implications.</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Shu\"A Yo\"D 256 states that the Talmud is called Bavli as it is a mixture of the 3 constituent parts of the Jewish knowledge: Mikrah, Mishnah, and Talmud.

If you noticed, we [mostly] use to refer to the Torah as whole Psukim, but according to some sources the Sages used much smaller chunks to derive the Halochos from - abbreviations, single letters, and even the single Ta'am. We lost those skills and our understanding is limited to what the Sages interpreted in the Talmud. That's why we could not possibly notice if the Torah was altered on the level of letters as long as the general commandments stay the same.</p>\n\n\n",

R. Judah says : the size of an egg</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mishnah seems to be specific to <em>zimmun</em> and also does not specifically mention bread.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, when one is full and has eaten only a lot of candy bars as his meal, he does not have to say <em>Birkat Hamazon</em>, AFAIK. Isn't this in contradiction to the Torah verse that says one should say it after being \"full\"?</p>\n\n<p>Why was this commandment tied in specifically to bread and it wasn't extended to saying it if you are filled with regardless of what food you ate?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.20b.11-15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 20b</a> says that bentching before one is full is Rabbinic in nature. It brings this Halacha in the context of the following question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ליה רבינא לרבא נשים בברכת המזון דאורייתא או דרבנן למאי נפקא מינה לאפוקי רבים ידי חובתן אי אמרת דאורייתא אתי דאורייתא ומפיק דאורייתא אלא אי אמרת דרבנן הוי שאינו מחוייב בדבר וכל שאינו מחוייב בדבר אינו מוציא את הרבים ידי חובתן מאי</p>\n<p>Ravina said to Rava: “Women[‘s obligation] in bentching - is it Biblical or Rabbinic? What practical difference does it make? To relieve others of their obligation. If you say that it’s Biblical, their Biblical obligation can relieve others’ Biblical obligations. But if you say it’s Rabbinic, it’s like someone who isn’t obligated in the matter, and whoever is not obligated in the matter cannot relieve others of their obligation. What [is the halacha]?”</p>\n<p>תא שמע באמת אמרו בן מברך לאביו ועבד מברך לרבו ואשה מברכת לבעלה אבל אמרו חכמים תבא מארה לאדם שאשתו ובניו מברכין לו אי אמרת בשלמא דאורייתא אתי דאורייתא ומפיק דאורייתא אלא אי אמרת דרבנן אתי דרבנן ומפיק דאורייתא</p>\n<p>Come and hear: “In truth they said, a son can bentch for his father, a slave for his master, and a woman for her husband. But they Sages said, a curse should come on a man whose wife and children bentch for him.” It is well if you say [a woman’s obligation is] Biblical - their Biblical obligation comes and relieves their [husbands’] Biblical obligation. But if you say it’s Rabbinic, can a Rabbinic obligation relieve a Biblical one?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here’s the key line for your question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולטעמיך קטן בר חיובא הוא אלא הכא במאי עסקינן כגון שאכל שיעורא דרבנן דאתי דרבנן ומפיק דרבנן</p>\n<p>And according to your logic, is a minor obligated? Rather, with what are we dealing here? For example, <strong>if he ate a measure which obligates him Rabbinically</strong>, where the Rabbinic obligation comes and relieves the Rabbinic obligation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In further exploring this Rabbinic obligation, the Gemara continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דרש רב עוירא זמנין אמר לה משמיה דרבי אמי וזמנין אמר לה משמיה דרבי אסי אמרו מלאכי השרת לפני הקדוש ברוך הוא רבונו של עולם כתוב בתורתך אשר לא ישא פנים ולא יקח שחד והלא אתה נושא פנים לישראל דכתיב ישא ה׳ פניו אליך אמר להם וכי לא אשא פנים לישראל שכתבתי להם בתורה ואכלת ושבעת וברכת את ה׳ אלהיך והם מדקדקים [על] עצמם עד כזית ועד כביצה:</p>\n<p>R’ Avira expounded, sometimes in the name of R’ Ami and sometimes in the name of R’ Asi: “The angels say before Hashem, ‘Master of the World! It is written in Your Torah, “Who does not favor nor accept bribes,” yet you favor Yisrael, as it says, “May Hashem favor you”!’ He said to them, ‘How can I not favor Yisrael? I wrote for them in the Torah, “You will eat, be satisfied, and bless Hashem, Your G-d,” and they’re particular about themselves [to bless] even on an olive’s or egg’s volume!’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The article says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Other kashrus officials reached by KosherToday also expressed the hope that the FDA would narrow the definition of milk to cows and goats, but did not see any immediate problem with the kosher status of dairy products. One official said simply: “Ask any American where milk comes from and they will tell you from a cow.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, I recognize that this is a media article and thus could just as likely get what the relevant official said wrong, but is there <em>any</em> Halachic basis for the idea that because the non-Jewish population expects their milk to be from a cow it can be presumed to actually be from a cow?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think he means something different. This is not an unfounded assumption in the eyes of the populace. His point probably is to say everyone knows it's cows milk, because that is what is normally used. This is an understanding between the retailer and the consumer based on practice. If anyone would deviate, expectations would not be fulfilled which would cause problems, which is why no milk seller will ever put other animals milk in their product, until of course it becomes socially accepted to.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming this, this would be  an explicit law in Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah siman 153 where we find an allowance to leave our animals with nonjews when the nonjewish society is not rova them, something which was not allowed in Talmudic times, being that they did do this issur and there is a lifnei iver issue. To clarify, our issur of lifnei iver is now assumed to be non existent due to our relying on their societal practices.</p>\n\n<p>At this point you might argue that that allowance would not help with other issurim which effect us directly. This is not true.</p>\n\n<p>Ramma filling in the rest of the gemara tells us we still shouldn't leave our children with them to be watched as they can still teach the children heresy and get away with it, so we cannot trust them. This is based directly off the gemara and Rashi as brought in the Tur.</p>\n\n<p>We see clearly that there is no distinction made between one type of issur and another. The case of the children is obviously dealing with an issue that will have a result on the Jewish person, and no distinction is made between the two.</p>\n\n<p>The fact is, if they commonly do something that is problematic for us, we cannot rely on them not doing it. Whereas if they don't commonly do something, we can assume they won't.</p>\n\n<p>The Mechaber here mentions a kol shekein to rely on them when the government enforces the allowed practice.\nBut that is not the basis for the basic rule. The basic halacha is simply a matter of assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>This idea is present in hilchos pas palter as well where we were able to assume there were no nonkosher ingredients added to the bread, back when they didn't normally add other ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>Again, this has nothing to do with believing them, or trusting them. This is our own assumptions made about them.</p>\n\n<p>To end off, I would just like to point out that I know many people who would never eat chalav stam chas vishalom, but regularly use nonjewish child care, whereas I can think of hardly anyone who consumes chalav stam but only uses Jewish childcare.\nI'm willing to bet the Ramma would tell people to save money by buying chalav stam and save up to afford the more expensive Jewish childcare.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Moshe's psak on \"Chalav HaCompanies\" is restricted to the U.S. and Canada because of the strictness of the FDA inspections and the laws and procedures involving the farms and the dairy processors. It has nothing to do with \"common assumptions\" as we see in European countries where such milk is not allowed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://matzav.com/rav-moshe-feinsteins-heter-of-cholov-stam-revisited/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Moshe Feinstein’s Heter of Cholov Stam Revisited</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Currently, the government inspects all milk farms 2-6 times per year.</p>\n  \n  <p>Governmental (state) farm inspection protocol specifically includes a\n  provision that only cows are in the farms’ milking parlors and/or\n  cowyard. This provision (formulated in terms of swine) is part of the\n  standard farm inspection form. (See sections of Dairy Farm Inspection\n  Forms below.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Government inspectors track the intake and output of all milk at\n  dairies. Thus, the source farms are identified by the inspectors, and\n  they must correlate with farms approved by the government.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/2926/in-what-countries-is-chalav-yisrael-not-required-for-milk\">In what countries is chalav yisrael not required for milk?</a> also discusses the matter.</p>\n\n<p>The official definition of <strong>milk</strong> from the FDA is restricted to cows. \"goats milk\" is restricted to goats. Changing the definition to include any other animal would require publication in the official FDA \"Request for Comments\" and require specific reference to the percentages of additional ingredients. Even discussions <strong>before</strong> the \"request for Comments\" is issued must first reach the public and the dairy industry.</p>\n\n<p>see the comment with the link from @Aaron</p>\n\n<p>Thus, according to the FDA, cows milk and goats milk may not be mixed without explicit labeling, much less that of any other animal.</p>\n\n<p>There is a movement by lobbyists to include Aspartame (artificial sweetener) in the definition but people are objecting to that. If they would change to definition to include that of other animals, they will have to first publicize the matter first.</p>\n\n<p>If the FDA is going to change the rules, then they would have to give the source animal on each label. Even if the definition changes, it would not allow \"blended\" milk from different animals. Thus, \"Cows milk\" must only be from cows. \"goats milk\" must only be from goats, etc. As a result, one should not worry about milk from nonkosher animals being sold without a reference to the animal it came from.</p>\n\n<p>Senator Dan Coats letter is dealing with mock milk (such as Soy Milk) rather than milk from other animals. If milk from other animals is mixed in to the milk from a dairy, the dairy can be forced to buy all such adulterated products at the full price of Grade A milk. It is that penalty which Rav Moshe used to allow \"Chalav HaCompanies\".</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?FR=131.110\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Code of Federal Regulations Revised as of April 1, 2014 PART 131 -- MILK AND CREAM</a></p>\n\n<p>(a) Description.

    "title": "Using the Coravin Wine Preserver on shabbat",
    "content": "# Using the Coravin Wine Preserver on shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a new device called the coravin which allows one to insert a needle into a cork of a wine bottle and the wine flows through the needle by using argon gas (protects quality of wine) and by doing this no oxygen comes in contact with wine. What makes this revolutionary is that now one can extract a glass a wine and put the bottle away for months without losing any flavor or substance (tastes like a brand new unopened bottle). </p>\n\n<p>My question is can one use this device (argon gas) on shabbas.  see how it works <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=490BvJQcFKw\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=490BvJQcFKw</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aA259.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aA259.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Assuming the question is only regarding the insertion of the needle on shabbos, and not placed before shabbos, this particular device presents a few issues within the prohibition of “creating a utensil” on shabbos which is prohibited. (Shabbos 146)</p>\n\n<p>The Needle is placed into the cork, and gas is then pumped to create a siphoning effect on the wine, which then goes through the tip of the needle and out of the spout. This would seemingly be running into an issue of making a hole in a vessel. Thus perhaps making this hole in the cork is, making a hole in a kli, Turning the cork into a dispenser.</p>\n\n<p>However, a response to this suggestion is that the cork is just a porous material, and all the needle is doing is pushing aside the cork.\nFurthermore, the hole, once the needle is removed, as the company claims, closes back up right away, which would, for halachic purposes, constitute this hole as not a nekev yafeh. Though perhaps this does not matter, as at the time of using it (בשעת מעשה) it has created a hole, or passageway in the cork for the air and wine to pass through. </p>\n\n<p>Another issue that needs to be addressed is whether the hole being made is a “nekev lahachnis U’lehotzi” a hole that is meant to draw out of or place within (Ibid.). For the needle is passing the argon gas through to the bottle, and then taking out wine. </p>\n\n<p>Some have suggested that this would be similar to a heter of Rav Shlomo Zalman egarding if one is allowed to punch two holes into a juice can, one to serve as the spout, and the other to allow air to push the juice out, thus taking the place of the juice (similar to the argon gas taking the place of the wine and causing the siphoning effect).</p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish (Orach Chaim 51:12) held that to do such a thing is assur min HaTorah as you are turning the can into a dispenser.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shlomo Zalman (quoted in Meor Hashabbos Vol. 1  Letter 18:3) allows it based on the sevara that the air coming in and pushing out the juice is insignificant, meaning that the person isn’t pumping air in on the account of “wanting” the air to come in, rather it is only in order for the juice to come out. The logic of Rav Shlomo Zalman is that a hole  that is created to insert something, but that insertion is only for the sake of removal, is not the type of hole that the Torah prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>However this contention seemingly does not help for the Coravin gas cartridges, as the person pouring the wine has to push the trigger to put the gas in, as in it is a direct act to “place” the gas inside.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps one could say that the claim the of the company that the hole closes up, is not accurate, as I had the chance to place the needle back into a new hole and then back into the original hole, I could tell there is a stark difference in terms of effort needed to place the needle back in (much easier), which leads me to believe that there really is a hole being created. If so, even if it is not a helpful hole, and not Boneh, perhaps that is called kilkul (destruction for its own sake, which is not a biblical prohbition) that is still assur medaraban. (This is obviously a debatable point, as its dependent on my own experience, perhaps others disagree)</p>\n\n<p>One possible argument to allow its use is that the hole that is being created in the cork, is only for a short period of time, an that once the needle is removed, the hole is closed up right away. This is based on the idea that the torah only prohibited a structure that is capable of being permanent (Binyan Keva), but a temporary structure (binyan arai). Based on this, Rav Tzvi Pesach Frank permitted making ice cubes on shabbos, despite the fact that one could compare it to making cheese (Megaven) as it is like adding one thing on tip of the other, similar to building a structure. Rav Frank allowed it because since the ice would soon melt, it is not considered a permanent structure, only a temporary one. (Shabbos 102b, Beitzah 32b, Tal Harim 1)</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the melacha of Zoreh, it is also not a problem as there is nothing that is being dispersed by spraying the gas in the bottle. Thus it is not an issue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However after much research into this topic, it would be permitted to use the Coravin on shabbos, because it the cork is to be viewed as just a plug in a old opening (סתימה לפתח ישן) that, according to the Chazon ish is permitted to make in it a wide opening, even if that is meant to go in and out (פתח להכניס ולהוציא).</strong></p>\n\n<p>See also the Chayei Adam (Shabbos 41) that permits opening the corks of wine bottles.  </p>\n\n<p>Watch <a href=\"https://www.torahanytime.com/#/lectures?v=59510\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a series of Shiurim (possibly the only place that has discussed this question in a halachic context) regarding some of the possible issues about the Coravin. </p>\n\n<p>I personally asked Rav Tuvia Leff and he said it is muttar to use on shabbos</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Shmuel Kamenetsky in Kovetz Halachos (Hilchos Shabbos 2:page 482) writes that the Coravin is mutar to use and one can change the gas cartridges as well.</p>\n<p>Text:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/b5mkm.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></p>\n\n\n",

We can, however, point up a couple things to at least rank it likely he was younger than Caleb. At JA 14.10-11 we find Caleb essentially boasting to Joshua that despite being of a now advanced age he's still been able to carry his weight and prove his mettle on the battlefield over the past six years. One imagines he wouldn't be boasting of such a thing to any fellow warrior equal to his age, much less older, from which it seems almost apparent Joshua was younger than Caleb, and perhaps younger to some significant extent. Secondly, Moses in their very first year, at ES 33.11, calls Joshua a young man, this being when [by NS 10.11 and JA 14.7] Caleb was age 39. It seems unlikely Joshua would have been the appropriate object of Moses' description if he'd been really even much near Caleb's age. He was probably ten or more years younger than Caleb, and may have ruled over Israel post-conquest as many as forty years. The author of the Seder Olam ventures [for the latter] a guess of 28 years, which would make Joshua an unlikely \"only three years younger\" than Caleb, but he does so in a way that strains against the otherwise straightforward meaning of the Judges account. Mind you, of course, this is not to attest to the actual historicity of the story, neither in part nor in whole, but is only to piece together missing details based on extant ones.</p>\n\n\n",

This rule against learning about idolatry should forbid virtually worshipping the idol, as well. In playing the game, you are watching the idolatrous service as it happens, even though you are not technically participating in it.</p>\n<p>Authorities are divided whether this prohibition applies to all idolatrous or only those that are no longer worshipped. In response to a question whether a teacher may cover Greek mythology in class, <strong>Rav Moshe Feinstein</strong> (Iggeros Moshe, Yoreh De’ah 2:53) rejects the suggestion that because no one currently worships the ancient religion, the prohibition no longer applies to it. Instead, he offers permission from another angle, that the education should be from the perspective of debunking the false stories. Otherwise, according to <strong>Rav Moshe</strong>, studying or watching ancient idolatrous religions remains forbidden.</p>\n<p>I recall hearing in the name of <strong>Rav Joseph B. Soloveitchik</strong> that he permitted studying Greek mythology for the reason Rav Moshe rejected, although I never confirmed this. Even if he did not, we can find others who suggest it. <strong>Rav Yair Chaim Bacharach</strong> (Chavos Yair, no. 1 secs. 11-12 sv. ve-adayin tzl”a) suggests that the prohibition to say the name of an idol only applies to an idol that is currently worshipped. We may freely say the names of ancient idols. <strong>Darkhei Teshuvah</strong> (147:4) quotes a responsum of the Beis Yitzchak 1:YD:152) that agrees in principle with the <strong>Chavos Yair</strong> but is concerned that maybe someone in the world still worships the Greek pantheon. Because of this possibility, he refuses to consider Greek mythology an abandoned religion.</p>\n<p>Some contemporary rabbis in Israel seem to follow the Chavos Yair‘a approach. <strong>Rav Shlomo Aviner</strong> (She’eilas Shlomo 4:167; Piskei Shlomo, vol. 2 p. 45) begrudgingly permits the study of Greek mythology. He cautions that it is full of nonsense and is a waste of time. However, he allows for leniency if necessary because the idolatry has been long abandoned. Similarly, <strong>Rav Yehuda Henkin</strong> (Bnei Banim 3:35:2) writes that if the religion is abandoned, the gods are no longer considered idols.</p>\n<p><strong>In this game, the idolatry is completely fictional. Not only does no one currently worship it, no one ever worshipped it. I believe that even Rav Moshe would not apply the prohibition to this religion because it is not, and has never been, a religion. It is simply fantasy.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It's perfectly permissible. The issue of avoda Zara comes in when you put together/ designate items to represent a god/s. And even that isn't avoda Zara. That goes against the prohibition of \"sculpting a figure of God.\" The actual prohibition of avoda Zara is when a person offers a sacrifice or makes an oath or does any sort of service in which he does  for the sake of a god or the such.</p>\n\n\n",

If Saul hears it he will kill me.” (1 Sm 17:2) The school of R' Yishmael taught: peace is so important that even the Holy One, blessed be He, altered what was said for its sake! For at first, [Sarah says] “My husband is old” and afterwards, [when G-d repeats her words to Abraham] it says “I am old.” (Gn 18:12)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/hf_LyingPermissible.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/hf_LyingPermissible.html</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Although we often invoke Midivar Shekker Tirchack as the Torah's command not to lie, it is not really a biblical prohibition. That <em>pasuk</em> is actually discussing <em>beis din</em> and witness. When the Gemara discusses keeping your word in business it invokes another verse, הין צדק איפה צדק. </p>\n\n<p>This still does not apply to a lie in conversation. For that we have the <em>pasuk</em>, דובר שקרים לא יכון לנגד עיני. The Gemara lists four groups of those who won't merit to accept the <em>shechina</em>. These are the haughty, the flatterers, liars and gossipers. So, while it is definitely not recommended, it is more of a <em>midos</em> issue than an actual sin. The same applies to haughtiness and flattery.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Bava Metzia gives three areas where a Talmid Chochom can lie: not to take credit for what he learned, for <em>tznius</em>, and not to announce a good host for everyone to converge. These aren't incidents of one <em>mitzva</em> colliding with another. It is weighing importance.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is Beis Hillel's famous retort that just as when you make a purchase you would want people to tell you it was worth it, we should also praise the bride even in virtues she does not posses.</p>\n\n<p>So as we see there are overriding factors. Kalev weighed the situation and realized that the way to get through it would be to act as he did.</p>\n\n\n",

If it was a question of majority vs. minority, they would have outnumbered 10 spies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Premise</strong></p>\n\n<p>Granted that all the spies physically visited the land and no women did, so one could argue that the people would believe testimony only from those who were actually there. However, both Kalev and Yehoshua based their positive claim on the faith and trust in G-d. The women would have supported that same claim, using the same strategy.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I shall give my answer here although it may be more appropriate to the question this is following up.\nThe question really should be why is it that the women wanted the land and not the men. This will also answer the question why the women couldnt speak up and influence the men. \nIn a previous answer I wrote the 'yesod' that the reason why the benai yisroel in the desert made the golden calf and why they always wanted to go back to Egypt (whereas the women didnt want to make the golden calf and wanted to go to Israel, in Korah they didnt want to argue with moshe rabeinu so they saved their husband) is because the men learned torah which the women didnt. \nThe torah in the desert was of the highest order. They were dor deiah. Everything they did was to make more torah. To stay in the desert would also have accomplished that. Korach was a bigger talmid chochom than Aaron (so says the sfas emes) so he deserved to be the kohen godol. </p>\n\n<p>But that is not what hashem wants. If he did, he could carry on giving us manna in Israel. This has the disadvantage since one is not 'working', of falling for each ill wind like the yidden did in the desert. Torah has to be gained by working for it not by being given on a plate like in the desert. That is how hashem wants the world to be.  The women who always knew the truth would never have been able to explain it to the  men. Try telling someone today that Torah isnt everything and 'working' for it is more important.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This comes from the Medrash on Parshas Pinchas, Parsha 21:10. The Medrash says that in that time the women fixed what the men ruined. They weren't part of the Egel and did not subscribe to the idea of the Meraglim.</p>\n\n<p>Just like the Egel happened without the women getting in their way, this happened too. What we see is that they lived the land and looked forward to living there. This doesn't mean they actively negated anything that got in the way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to some meforshim the meraglim first went among the families in order to panic the people about their children. As a result, when the men of the community started crying and complaining, the women too became afraid for their children and could no longer resist. As a result, the most they could do was keep quiet. The men were so panicked that they would not listen in any case.</p>\n\n<p>Note that since the men were the soldiers, the women could not do anything. If they had managed to say anything, the demoralization of the men would have made the army incapable of fighting.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the women could not have stopped the men from refusing to fight. Similarly at cheit haegel, the women refused to give up their jewelry by could not stop the men from giving up their jewelry.</p>\n\n\n",

G-d is perfect and infinite. He has no need for a universe; He has nothing to gain from creating mankind. Thus, we can only view creation as an act of altruism -- for the sake of man.</p>\n\n<p>Further, if G-d is truly perfect, His acts must be viewed as acts of perfect goodness. G-d created man in order to have creatures upon whom He could bestow goodness. Creation was, therefore, the ultimate selfless act: A G-d who needs nothing created a world in order to give the man everything.</p>\n\n<p>But Instead of giving us everything on a silver plate, the human being has to work for it. My question is: <strong>Why?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Zohar and kabbalists and the Ramchal refer<sup>(Where?)</sup> to the \"the bread of shame principle\" (\"nahama d'kisufa\"): If G-d were to \"reward\" us for doing nothing it would not be a reward; it would be humiliation/shameful.</p>\n\n<p>How does this principle work and how it leads to having a free will?<sup>(Is this a separate question?)</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramchal addresses this issue in Derech Hashem (among other places).</p>\n\n<p>He explains that the ultimate good is Hashem Himself, and therefore connecting to Hashem and being like Hashem is the ultimate experience of good.  A central element of Hashem's perfection is that He was not given His perfection by an external source, but rather His perfection is intrinsic to His existence.  Therefore, the way in which we become the most similar to Him as possible (although it is not a complete similarity) is by becoming the \"master\" of our own perfection.</p>\n\n<p>Derech Hashem 1:2:2</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אולם גזרה חכמתו, שלהיות הטוב שלם, ראוי שיהיה הנהנה בו בעל הטוב ההוא; פירוש - מי שיקנה הטוב בעצמו, ולא מי שיתלוה לו הטוב בדרך מקרה. ותראה שזה נקרא קצת התדמות, בשיעור שאפשר, אל שלימותו יתברך. כי הנה הוא יתברך שמו שלם בעצמו, ולא במקרה, אלא מצד אמיתת עניינו מוכרח בו השלימות, ומשוללים ממנו החסרונות בהכרח. ואולם זה אי אפשר שיימצא בזולתו, שיהיה אמיתתו מכרחת לו השלימות ומעדרת ממנו החסרונות. אך להתדמות לזה במקצת, צריך שלפחות יהיה הוא הקונה השלימות שאין אמיתת עניינו מכריח לו, ויהיה הוא מעדיר מעצמו החסרונות שהיו אפשריים בו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Arye Kaplan explains in his \"If You Were G-d\" that shame is being in the wrong place. Shame is not a vestigial emotion from the cave days. It is a perception of yourself. </p>\n\n<p>When you get without deserving you are getting what is not yours. It is like the butler sitting in the dais. Whether or not he feels funny about it, it is funny.</p>\n\n<p>This is like the difference between painting and electronic plating. In the case of the latter it is a full binding on the chemical level.</p>\n\n<p>Accepting G-dly goodness without owning it is being separate from it. When you seek out Hashem and play a part in spreading His name here in our domain, you joined forces with His mission. Then, when you merit divine closeness it is actual closeness.</p>\n\n\n",

She spent a few years in the Peace Corps in Mongolia, and brought me back a little hide box with sheep and horse ankle bones, which the people of Mongolia use for divination. Well, i don't believe in divination, nobody i know does, and even if i happened to meet someone who believes in divination, i think it would be rather unlikely they would know how to use the small trove of ankle bones to achieve anything.</p>\n\n<p>So as a history major, i find the bones fascinating, i don't mind having them around, however, since i'm religiously Jewish, this seems like it could be prohibited. And therefore it makes me curious. Since the Torah seems to be mostly concerned with people believing that idols or divination objects worked, i'm not sure that logic applies anymore.</p>\n\n<p>i know we aren't allowed to practice divination, and i imagine we would therefore be prohibited from having divination instruments. But since beliefs have changed so much throughout the centuries, i'm wondering if the more recent poseqim have commented on the following situation: if someone's entire household doesn't believe in divination, and even if they did, wouldn't be able to use the object for it, is an object still prohibited for them to keep?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# According to Chazal, does Beged Kefet matter?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Hebrew alphabet has 22 written characters (plus 5 specialized characters for the ends of words - ם, ן, ץ ,ף, ך) generally assumed to be each originally associated with distinct sounds. The Masoretes have a tradition (which to our [traditional] ability, we also attempt to follow) regarding a dual pronunciation of six letters in the Alephbet, namely, ב, ג, ד, כ, פ, ת (typically indicated visually by the presence/absence of a dot in the middle of the character) However, the Masoretes were predominantly from a Karaite-heretical sect. Is there any independent basis in traditional halacha, especially in Chazal, for distinct, contextual pronunciations of these letters? What is the view of linguistic scholars regarding the origin and development of <em>Beged Kefet</em> (and how might this be relevant to halacha)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Rav Saadiah Gaon writes in Chapter 2 of his commentary to Sefer Yetzirah lays down the correct pronunciation of the Hebrew letters, saying that not only is there בגד־כפת letters, but that even the ר has an alternate pronunciation with a dagesh so more like בגד־כפרת according to him.</p>\n\n<p>He basically says that Hebrew and Arabic share all the exact same sounds, except that  Hebrew has a בּ ) ב without a dagesh) that Arabic lacks,  פ ) פּ with a dagesh) that Arabic lacks, and Arabic has a Jimmal (the normal English J sound) that Hebrew lacks.</p>\n\n<p>i don't think anyone is about to call Saadia Gaon a Karaite, so you have a clear Rabbinic Posek speaking of the importance of pronunciation. </p>\n\n<p>As for how it may be relevent in Halacha, the Gemara says that one should extend the Daleth from the word Echad until one runs out of breath. This is not possible if you are unable to distinguish between ד and דּ. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"All who prolong the word echad will have their days and years prolonged. Rabbi Acha bar Yaakov said that one should prolong the letter daleth. Rabbi Assi added: Provided that he does not slur over the letter cheth.\" (Berachot 13b)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore you have at least one instance of the ד having at least 2 distinct sounds by the time of the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>And while this may not have a direct halakhic significance, it does draw the attention to the proper pronunciation of ו. In modern Hebrew, both ו and ב share the same sound. But according to Saadia, if Arabic doesn't have a ב, then he should have also said ו to go along with it. And he also does not say that Hebrew doesn't have a w sound, that Arabic clearly has. So according to many scholars who read the words of Saadia Gaon, the ו should make the sound of a w.</p>\n\n<p>As a bit of a side note, i haven't personally run across any Karaites that distinguished between all the בגד־כפת letters. So i think the idea of attributing the distingishment of these letters as something linked distinctly to Karaism might be a bit misguided.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are two points I'll make. But I do hope someone else has a sourced answer.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, this is something 'in the Torah' that these heretics are careful about. Therefore, they have believability as per the first chapter in Chulin regarding the Cuthim.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the Tshuvas HaRashba Hamyuchas LiHaRamban siman 232 which is brought in the Meiri's Kiryas Seffer maamar 2 chelek 3 deals with the issue of finding words written differently in chazzal than they were being written based on ׳חכמי הלשון והספרים המדויקין׳. The halacha was that if the word form in chazzal was the basis of a practical halachic drasha, we go with chazzal's version. If it was brought for midrashic purposes, we go with the mesora version. And if the mesora versions conflict, we go with the majority, as was done in the days of Ezra mentioned in maseches Sofrim 6 4 concerning the discrepancy of three words.</p>\n\n<p>All in all we seem to not mind relying on them, especially where it doesn't really go against any halacha.</p>\n\n\n",

So why put the reminder there rather than by the <strong><em>inner gold altar</em></strong> where the incense is ACTUALLY brought (and, presumably, where the warning would be needed)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The <em>Torah</em> is explicit about a rationale for [at least some part of] this command:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.17.3?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">וְיִֽהְי֥וּ לְא֖וֹת לִבְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל</a></p>\n<p>let them serve as a symbol to the people of Israel</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.17.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">זִכָּר֞וֹן לִבְנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל לְ֠מַעַן אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹֽא יִקְרַ֜ב אִ֣ישׁ זָ֗ר אֲ֠שֶׁר לֹ֣א מִזֶּ֤רַע אַהֲרֹן֙ ה֔וּא לְהַקְטִ֥יר קְטֹ֖רֶת לִפְנֵ֣י ה' וְלֹֽא יִהְיֶ֤ה כְקֹ֙רַח֙ וְכַ֣עֲדָת֔וֹ</a></p>\n<p>It was to be a reminder to the Israelites, so that no outsider—one not of Aaron’s offspring—should presume to offer incense before the LORD and be like Korah and his band.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the first one <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.17.3?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Numbers.17.3.5&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi comments</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ויהיו לאות</strong>. לזכרון שיאמרו אלו היו מאותן שנחלקו על הכהונה ונשרפו</p>\n<p>ויהיו לאות THEY SHALL BE AS AN אות — The word לאות is the same as לזכרון, something to be mentioned (cf. Exodus 13:9) — that people will always say: These plates were from (once belonged to) those who raised dissension about the priesthood and were burnt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He understands the signal to be a reminder not to disagree [contentiously] with the [institution, responsibilities and privileges of] the priesthood, which is presumably a fight anybody can pick, not just other <em>kohanim</em>. This is in keeping with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.17.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Numbers.17.5.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his explanation of the second one</a>, namely,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ולא יהיה כקרח</strong>. כדי שלא יהיה כקרח</p>\n<p>ולא יהיה כקרח means in order that he be not as Korah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here too, publicly protesting authority and societal order, or general rabblerousing - i.e. being like Korach - are activities anybody can engage in, so Rashi consistently explains this as the point the copper plating would make. It is reasonable to assume, seeing these comments of his, that Rashi concluded when Hashem commanded the plating to be made for \"the <em>mizbe'ach</em>\" that it was the outer, more visible one.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to Rashi, the command was to turn them into <em>coverings for the copper altar</em> in order to remind Israel not to attempt a repeat performance of bringing the incense inappropriately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your point that as much as B'nei Yisra'el are mentioned as a broader collective twice in this command, the reminder about burning incense properly doesn't relate directly to them is well-taken. But it comes from the Torah itself in the second <em>pasuk</em> quoted above, not from Rashi. Once we have established that the discouraged behavior is emulating Korach with respect to his [ilk's] confrontation with the priesthood, it stands to perfectly good reason that those closest to the action in question, would also be reminded not to fall victim to the exact same temptation that caused his downfall.</p>\n<p>I don't think we should understand the <em>os</em> and <em>zikaron</em> here to be practical impediments to a person who is literally on their way to transgress the proper burning of incense. After all, that is not how the pans were being used by Korach and friends to begin with<sup>2</sup>. Rather, Rashi and a theme of <em>midrashim</em> on this topic understand the \"sign\" to be an educational one, which is valuable to all sectors of the nation though perhaps in different ways, as seen from the <em>p'sukim</em> above.</p>\n<p>The Chizkuni goes as far as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.17.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chizkuni%2C_Numbers.17.5.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">to say</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הא למדנו שהדבור למשה שיאמר לאהרן שיהא הרואה שואל הרי כתיב מזבח אדמה תעשה לי שהיו ממלאים את חללו עפר אם כן מה טיבו להיות לו גג מנחושת והנשאל משיב גג זה נעשה ממחתות קרח ועדתו שהיו מערערין על הכהונה וכל העם ישמעו וייראו לערער עוד</p>\n<p>This teaches us that the statement to Moshe that he'd tell Aharon was so that the observer would ask \"But it's written, 'An altar of <em>earth</em> you should make for Me' - that we'd fill its cavity with dirt!

    "content": "# What is the source of the 'elu devarim' text printed in siddurim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The girsa of the <em>Elu devarim</em> text that appears in many prayer books after the blessings on the Torah cannot be sourced, so far as I can tell, to any particular rabbinic text. Here's the version that appears in siddurim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵלּוּ דְבָרִים שֶׁאֵין לָהֶם שִׁעוּר: הַפֵּאָה, וְהַבִּכּוּרִים, וְהָרֵאָיוֹן, וּגְמִילוּת חֲסָדִים, וְתַלְמוּד תּוֹרָה. אֵלּוּ דְבָרִים שֶׁאָדָם אוֹכֵל פֵּרוֹתֵיהֶם בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה, וְהַקֶּרֶן קַיֶּמֶת לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא: וְאֵלּוּ הֵן: כִּבּוּד אָב וָאֵם, וּגְמִילוּת חֲסָדִים, וְהַשְׁכָּמַת בֵּית הַמִּדְרָשׁ שַׁחֲרִית וְעַרְבִית, וְהַכְנָסַת אוֹרְחִים, וּבִקּוּר חוֹלִים, וְהַכְנָסַת כַּלָּה, וּלְוָיַת הַמֵּת, וְעִיּוּן תְּפִלָּה, וַהֲבָאַת שָׁלוֹם בֵּין אָדָם לַחֲבֵרוֹ וּבֵין אִיש לְאִשְׁתוֹ וְתַלְמוּד תּוֹרָה כְּנֶגֶד כֻּלָּם.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And here's the first mishnah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Peah.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peah</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלו דברים שאין להם שיעור – הפיאה, והביכורים, והריאיון, וגמילות חסדים, ותלמוד תורה. ואלו דברים שאדם אוכל מפירותיהן בעולם הזה, והקרן קיימת לו לעולם הבא – <strong>כיבוד אב ואם, וגמילות חסדים, והבאת שלום בין אדם לחברו; ותלמוד תורה</strong> כנגד כולם.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, the first sentence is the same, but the second clause of the siddur text includes six items – <em>hashkamat beit hamidrash, hachnasat orchim, bikur cholim, hachnasat kalah, lviat hameit,</em> and <em>iyun tefilah</em> (six and a half, if we include the <em>u'vein ish l'ishto</em> bit of <em>hava'at shalom)</em> – that are not in the Mishnah. The reference given in some siddurim (eg. Artscroll and Koren Sacks) for the second clause is to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.127a.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 127a</a>. Here's that version:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר יוחנן ששה דברים אדם אוכל פירותיהן בעולם הזה והקרן קיימת לו לעולם הבא ואלו הן <strong>הכנסת אורחין, וביקור חולים, ועיון תפלה, והשכמת בית המדרש, והמגדל בניו לתלמוד תורה, והדן את חברו לכף זכות.</strong> איני? והא אנן תנן, אלו דברים שאדם עושה אותם ואוכל פירותיהן בעולם הזה והקרן קיימת לו לעולם הבא, ואלו הן <strong>כיבוד אב ואם, וגמילות חסדים, והבאת שלום שבין אדם לחברו, ות\"ת</strong> כנגד כולם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, we still haven't found a list that matches the siddur text; the first list from Shabbat is missing items that appear in the siddur and the Mishnah <strong>(kibud av v'eim, gemilut chasadim)</strong> and also includes items that are in neither the Misnhah nor the siddur <strong>(magdil banav l'talmud torah, dan et chavero).</strong> And the second list here is just the same as the second clause of the Mishnah. A note in Shabbes sends you to yet another parallel text, this time from Kiddushin 39b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלו דברים שאדם אוכל פירותיהן בעולם הזה והקרן קיימת לו לעולם הבא אלו הן <strong>כבוד אב ואם וגמילות חסדים והכנסת אורחים והבאת שלום בין אדם לחבירו ותלמוד תורה</strong> כנגד כולם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But, alas, this version too is lacking several items (five and a half) from the siddur list – <em>hachnasat leveit hamidrash, hachnasat kalah, bikur cholim, leviat hameit, iyun teffilah</em> and the <em>uvein ish l'ishto</em> clause.</p>\n<p>So, the text recited by many pious Jews every morning seems to be a <em>mishmash</em> – none of the would-be sources contain all the same items, and it it contains at least one item <em>(leviat hameit)</em> that does not appear in <em>any</em> parallel text. I feel like there might be a problem with reciting such a text in a ritual context as a representative of <em>Torah sheba'al peh.</em> Any thoughts, or illuminating manuscripts or whatever, that might help us understand this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><em>Shut MaHaRaM Shik</em> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1494&st=&pgnum=12\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>siman</em> 2</a>) explains the reasons for the variations found in the <em>Siddur</em> as compared to the <em>Mishnah</em> and the quote from the <em>gemara</em> in Tractate <em>Shabbat</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><p>The <em>Siddur</em> adds \"הכנסת כלה והלוית המת\": Since they are greater than studying <em>Torah</em> (as evidenced by the fact that one should interrupt his <em>Torah</em> study in order to fulfill these <em>mitzvos</em>), Rabbi Yochanan should have included them in his statement.

(9) Work for six days and perform all of your labor. (10) And the seventh day will be sabbath for God your Lord. Do not perform any labor...

Or, they were informed of which day had been the seventh and began resting on it.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: is this assumption correct (and if so did they continue the existing week cycle, or had it strayed necessitating a realignment of the seventh day to the historical Shabbat), or perhaps was the Jewish halakhic week-cycle independent of the historical week.</p>\n\n<p>An alternative possibility, if the halakhic week were independent of the historical week, would be that the Jewish people were commanded to work for 6 days starting at some point (perhaps the Sinaic revelation) and rest on the seventh. Accordingly, the seventh day would not necessarily be the same day of the day of God's rest. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12868/how-do-we-know-that-the-civil-saturday-is-the-correct-shabbat?rq=1\">this question</a> which assumes that the Sabbath is aligned with the original day 7.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Essentially the simplest answer is that, at the time of the Manna, they were told then \"Today is Friday, gather double and save over because tomorrow is Shabbat and you won't find\".

Thus, the Masoretic text doesn't hold the exclusive rights to the \"Jewish text\".

He attempts to refute this position from a piece of <em>Tosefta</em> that says that anyone can go out wearing sack because shepherds do (implying that what's clothing/adornment for shepherds is permitted for anyone).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Rav Yosef</em> answers his own question: <em>Ula</em> indeed holds that what's permitted for one is permitted for all — but not between the sexes, as \"women are a nation unto themselves\".</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>The <em>g'mara</em> then asks why a woman's wearing a signet ring outside should be forbidden. After all, the prohibition is carrying — but she's carrying it on her finger, which is an unusual part of the body for carrying things with. The action should be permitted for that reason (כלאחר יד).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Rabi Yirm'ya</em> answers that treasuresses frequently carry around signet rings on their fingers. Thus, that method of carrying a signet ring is considered usual.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Okay, so treasuresses usually carry around signet rings on their fingers — that is, they wear them. So why doesn't the logic of the shepherds' sack apply to the treasuresses' rings? Recall that anyone can wear sack because shepherds wear sack. So why can't any woman wear a signet ring because treasuresses wear signet rings?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Shepherds do not merely carry sacks, they <em>use sacks as clothing/adornments</em> by using them as raincoats, as Rashi indicates (see ד\"ה בשקין and אלא).</p>\n\n<p>Women do not wear signet rings <em>as clothing/adornments</em>, period. R.

The shepherd's sackcloth raincoat is functioning as a garment when worn over the body (e.g. by protecting from the rain). For a woman, a signet ring has no aesthetic value when worn and wearing it is just a way to get it from point A to point B.</p>\n\n\n",

But we must consider that the two traditions have value. The qeri is not necessarily the \"correction\" of kétiv for doctrinal or linguistic reasons. Personally, I find it logical to treat them as a separate traditions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>2) from a linguistic point of view, the pe-yod verbs (the first radical is a yod) are originally pe-waw which became pe-yod, according to the rule observed that waw tends to become yod, yod to become he (and even he to become aleph). The same logic is observed for the lamed-he verbs that are originally lamed-yod (eg עשה which עשיתי). So on יצא or ישר, consider that these verbs are initially וצא and ושר and their waw has mutated into, yod and the kal and piel modes first, and at a later period also for the hiphil mode. The הוצא form is older and  היצא  is later.</p>\n\n\n",

If there is proof against this idea, you can answer the question that way.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Yes, it has been suggested that the Essenes and the Baitusim (Boethusians) are one and the same sect. Evidence has been advanced, much of it on the assumption (a very big assumption) that the Essenes are the same as the Qumran sect. <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/1322198/%D7%94%D7%91%D7%99%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9D\">Here</a> is a paper by Zachi Dvira on the Baitusim, and on pp. 42-43, he provides a good summary of the attempts to identify them with the Essenes. I further summarize as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The first such attempt was by R. Azariah de Rossi and was based essentially on (1) the fact that the Talmud never claims that Baitusim denied the concept of an afterlife like the Saducees (which would have exluded them from being Josephus' Essenes), and (2) the similarity between the names \"ביתוסים\" and \"איסיים\" to the extent that that former could have derived from \"בית איסיאי\" or something similar.</p>\n\n<p>Skip ahead a few centuries and we find several scholars following R. Azariah's lead (see Dvira's paper for references). Some base their identification of Baitusim with Essenes on R. Azarah's reason #2, providing a more detailed analysis of the connection between \"ביתוסים\" and \"בית איסי\" (does איסי = יוסי?) Others find similarities between what we know about the beliefs of the Baitusim and what we find about the beliefs of the Qumran sect (given that Qumran = Essene) or similarities between their interpretations of certain halachot.</p>\n\n<p>Professor Adiel Schremer published a paper (available <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/2095037/The_Name_of_the_Boethusians\">here</a>) arguing against this linguistic association between \"ביתוסים\" and \"איסיים\", pointing out several difficulties of the above-suggested derivation; additionally, we only know the Greek name \"Essene\", but not what the Hebrew form of the name was.</p>\n\n<p>Professor Moshe David Herr also argued against this identification, identifying differences in the known practices and beliefs of the Baitusim and the Essenes and Qumran sect, even though others had pointed out some similarities. Dvira in his paper also provides some fundamental differences between these groups and concludes that no further attention should be given to this suggestion that Baitusim were Essenes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Professor Lawrence Schiffman argues in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92hyhBXLaWE\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> presentation to University of California (starting from 50:40 and more at the hour mark, as well as later in more detail) that some argue that the Essenes were not the Qumran sect, which would make them the early forerunners of the tzedukim (of which the Qumran sect was). However, Professor Schiffman rejects this notion as Pliny the Elder incorrectly identified the essence to have lived \"above Ein Geddi\".\nThus, the true identification of the Essenes remains a mystery.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Tefillin without external separations\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In schul, I've noticed that there is a pair of peshutim which have been partially deconstructed. In particular, I noticed that the partitions between the compartments of the shel rosh seemed somewhat unsubstantial, in fact, they had no relation to the lines on the exterior of the bayit! Needless to say, I was somewhat surprised, as I was under the impression that the separations needed to be complete between the compartments. Is this not so?</p>\n\n<p>Pictured below are photos of the interior of a bayit of of a tefilla p'shuta (shel rosh):\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0mCTY.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>and exterior:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eZJIg.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Almost any shel rosh you dissect will be like that. A few years ago people took notice of this. They started carrying on saying everyone's Teffilin were passul. The Poskim ended up saying it was kosher. Rabbi Belsky was one of the ones who said not to worry, IIRC. </p>\n\n<p>At that point in time, I personally was in the middle of having a new pair written up for me and asked Rabbi Dovid Feinstein if I should try to get a Shel Rosh that were separated all the way down. He said 'don't bother. No-one knows how to make them like that anyways'.</p>\n\n<p>A little background. The issue at hand is brought in the Mishna Berurah siman 32 on siff 38. There he brings Achronim  discussing Sofrim who were using glue or stitches to attach four separate pockets of leather to make one shel Rosh, with this they considered all the compartments to be from one piece of leather, which is a requirement. This was allowed, although not ideal, being that there were poskim who did not want to rely on using stitches or glue to consider it one piece of leather.</p>\n\n<p>The major problem was that they were also using glue between those battim so that they would not spread apart from each other. If we consider the glue as having made the leather onto one body, than here too we should consider it as one and there are no longer four separate boxes, but rather one box with three separators inside.</p>\n\n<p>The Chayei Adam quoted in the Mishna Berurah left it as a question if Teffilin such as this would be kosher, even bidieved. See Biur Halacha there as well.</p>\n\n<p>Getting back to modern day Teffilin. Nowadays Teffilin shel rosh are made from one piece of leather. So even if they are glued between the battim, we will not be in that situation of passul bidieved. </p>\n\n<p>Of course there is also siff 40 in the Shulchan Aruch there where we see the chritz, the channel between the battim must be noticeable. The fake chritz put into the plastered on black paint is not really good as mentioned in that Chayei Adam brought again in the Mishna Berurah #188. However, here the Mishna Berurah does not use such a strong language. In fact he changes the wording of the Chayei Adam and refers to his displeasure in the practice as מיאן, I'm assuming based on the fact that the Chayei Adam's major issue was the contradiction between using glue for both uses.</p>\n\n<p>Again, having our Teffilin like this is not ideal, as our poskim have been telling us for hundreds of years, since the time of the Magen Avraham, but apparently the Sofrim have been practicing this for at least that long as well.</p>\n\n\n",

I used to use Orchos Shabbos, but I found that while I enjoyed it and got a lot out of it, the rest of my family had a harder time with the nature of using a Hebrew sefer and translating/explaining.  I also think that sometimes his thoroughness made it hard for everyone else to pay attention.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking for a sefer in English which can be easily broken into small digestible segments, and gives a good basic general knowledge of Hilchos Shabbos. Something that guests could also follow even if they are only there for just the one meal would also be another advantage.</p>\n\n<p>I am aware of several sefarim, such as me'oros haShabbos, the 39 Melachos, and The Shabbos Kitchen/Home etc. Artscroll set.  I don't have experience with them, but those could be possible answers.</p>\n\n<p>Please explain in your answers why your recommendation fits the criteria described here along with any other relevant information.

(We've often used it as a basis for table discussions.) He begins sections with more general basic background pieces before he gets into more detailed applications. His examples tend to be very relevant, which also makes it much more engaging. (On the negative side, some of his organization method can seem unnecessarily complex and confusing, especially with regard to looking up his Hebrew end-notes. But for the purpose your describing, it sounds perfect. I would add that being a 4-volume set, it is more expensive than other, one volume works. However, I personally find it to be an essential part of a practical halacha library.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/the-39-avoth-melacha-of-shabbath.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>The 39 Avoth Melacha of Shabbath</em> by Rabbi Baruch Chait</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is designed for children, with the entire book being pictures. Each quarter of a page deals with a melacha, with pictures of different forms of the melacha around. It shows for each action whether it is <em>d'oraita</em>, <em>d'rabbanan</em>, or permitted.</p>\n\n<p>It does not delve into the reasons much (at all), so be prepared for questions about why is this forbidden/allowed. It's really a cursory introduction to the halachot of melacha.</p>\n\n<p>The book also touches on some of the requirements to be chayav, such as <em>shogeg/meizid</em>, <em>mitasek</em>, <em>psik reisha</em>, <em>shelo/k'darka</em>. It also has a page on muktzah.</p>\n\n<p>Be prepared to pass it around the table to let everyone look at the pictures.</p>\n\n<p>It is definitely short segments, and a guest can jump right in, assuming they have a basic knowledge of melacha.</p>\n\n<p>Also, you might enjoy it. We have the book because my father needed a good reference for the melachot. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>My personal favorite to share at the Shabbos table is <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0899068820\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Shabbos Kitchen</a> by Rabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen and his entire Shabbos Halacha series.</p>\n<p>Each chapter generally begins with a overview of the principles involved followed by a sampling of practical applications. Each part is followed by a summary.</p>\n<p>I have used it at the Shabbos table and my family (including some children) has been able to follow along despite the fact that the Shabbos table is not the forum for serious in depth study. I find that we remember the concepts which helps us know what to do in many cases and it helps us know when a situation calls for further research.</p>\n<p>I also like that Rabbi Cohen is not opinionated (even though he can be excused if he was). This means that when looking up the sources that he quotes I am rarely surprised. This is in contrast to some other books which may present the author's interpretation of the source without letting on that there may be alternate interpretations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please explain in your answers why your recommendation fits the criteria described here along with any other relevant information.

'VeHaito Aretz' - <strong>the carnivore shall be called Chaya</strong> 'VeKolam Yitrofu'\n(בהמה הם המינים האוכלים עשב, בין ישובי בין מדברי:\nוחיתו ארץ - אוכלי הבשר יקרא חיות, וכלם יטרופו)</p>\n<h2>Common examples:</h2>\n<h3>Chaya which we can eat include:</h3>\n<p>Deer, Gazelle, Addax, Bubalus</p>\n<h3>Chaya which we cannot eat include:</h3>\n<p>Cat, Dog, Lion</p>\n<h3>Behema which we can eat include:</h3>\n<p>Cows, Goats, Sheep</p>\n<h3>Behema which we cannot eat include:</h3>\n<p>Horse, Camel</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>From shaareihoraah.org, Parshat Re'eh:</p>\n\n<p>Within the general family of land-dwellers, Halacha divides them into two sub-categories, Beheima and Chaya (generally translated as domesticated and wild animals respectively). The distinction between these classifications is trickier [than kosher vs. non-kosher] and quite complicated.</p>\n\n<p>While both groups share the same defining characteristics to determine their Kosher status and must be split-hooved ruminants, there are two significant distinctions between them. A Beheima has a stringency that its Cheilev, forbidden fats, may not be consumed, while they are permitted in a Chaya. On the other hand, there is an obligation to cover the blood from a slaughtered Chaya, which is not necessary for a Beheima. Consequently, despite the difficulty involved, it is essential to determine the appropriate category for each animal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra and Radak explain that behemot are domesticated animals, which live among people, and have utilitarian uses for mankind (e.g., their meat is for consumption or they are used for transportation). Chayot, on the other hand, are wild animals, which live in the uninhabited wilderness. Ramban suggests that all behemot are herbivores, meaning that they are animals which feed solely on plants and other flora. By contrast, chayot are carnivores, that is, meat-eating animals. We can have an interesting discussion about deer and how their chayah status fits into these paradigms, see sources.</p>\n\n<p>SOURCE: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/whats-in-a-word\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>What's in a Word?</em></a>, \"<a href=\"https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/shemini-dont-be-a-behemah-or-a-chayah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Don't be a Behamah or a Chayah!</a>\"</p>\n\n\n",

Neither Hillel or Rashi say anything about possible mechanisms for this adaptation, such as Darwinian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution#Natural_selection\" rel=\"noreferrer\">natural selection</a>, Lamarckian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism\" rel=\"noreferrer\">inheritance of acquired characteristics</a>, simple acquisition of the same adaptive characteristics by all individuals during their lifetimes, or instantaneous mutation via open miracle. In addition, if I recall correctly, not everyone agrees that Hillel's answers were serious analyses of the natural phenomena rather than allegorical lessons or non-serious dismissals. So, this is not a slam-dunk, but according to Rashi's preferred explanations, I think we can fairly say that Hillel <em>may</em> have been describing instances of micro-evolution.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This one is imaginative, but someone told this to me years ago and it does seem somewhat compelling. </p>\n\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.61b.7?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachos 61b</a> records a famous parable said by Rabi Akiva where he compares a Jew without Torah to a fish being taken out of the water. The story has a fox who was trying to trick the fish. The fox argued:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He said to them: Do you wish to come up onto dry land, and we will reside together just as my ancestors resided with your ancestors? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These words seem to say that the ancestors of the fox lived with the ancestors of the fish.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps he is even implying his ancestors lived in the water with the fish, and that it is possible for the fish to now come live on the land. There is much that can be read into this. Of course it would be interesting to note that the fox was trying to trick the fish, and is refuted by the fish, but at the same time we have no reason to say this actual line is assumed false, just inapplicable at that point in time. In fact, if it was a blatant lie, it would have been detrimental to his argument.

    "content": "# kiddush for someone else, excluding myself\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I would like to stop by and say Kiddush for someone who is homebound and unable to say it for themselves.  This would be on Shabbat morning after schul.  However, I don't want to be Yotze from this kiddush, since I would like to be included in the Kiddush I will say for my family upon arriving home!  Can I actually do this or am I automatically \"yotzei\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yes, you may. See Shulchan Aruch siman 273 siff 4 'One may make kidush for others even though he is not eating with them, because for them it is kidush in the place they are eating. <em>And even though the blessing on wine cannot normally be made for others if he is not drinking along with them, since this borei pro hagafen is necessary for kidush, it has the same rule as kidush hayom, and one can bless it for others, even if the one making the blessing does not drink</em></p>\n\n<p>The reasoning behind this is the chidush of Arvus tells us that someone who is chayav in a mitzvah himself can be motzi someone else, even when the motzi, the one performing the mitzvah, is not intending to fulfill the mitzvah himself. Whereas regular birchas nehenin does not work like this.\nSee Double AA's answer here <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/19126/759\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/19126/759</a></p>\n\n<p>Extra credit: Reb Shlomo Zalman Auerbach writes in Minchas Shlomo 1 3 that he is uncertain if Arvus works in a situation where the one doing the mitzvah is not being yotzeh himself, and this is happening at a not optimal time.  For instance on Friday afternoon where someone who was not mikabel shabbos yet wants to say kidush for someone else and not himself. The same goes for someone blowing Shofar after Alos Hashachar but before Neitz when the Tokaya is not being Motzei himself. </p>\n\n<p>This is brought in Halichos Shlomo hilchos Tkiyas Shofar chapter 2 siff 12. See footnote #50 which mentions Rav Shlomo Zalman was lenient for a cholah or in a situation where the listener would not have an opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah later.  That footnote also brings his son R' Avraham Dov Auerbach as saying the source of The Shlomo Zalman's uncertainty is not clear.</p>\n\n<p>But if one does want to take this chidush into account, then perhaps making kidush for someone between Shacharis and Mussaf which is not ideal, as seen in siman 286 siff 2 being than one should not be eating a seuda then, might come into play.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is no restriction on the number of times you make kiddush on a Shabbat morning because you are only reciting biblical verses followed by a blessing over wine that you have to make each time as it's a different drinking session.</p>\n\n<p>Daytime kiddush is really a \"procedure\". i.e. when you have your first daytime meal you need to start with a cup of wine. Introduced by the G'mara. Later poskim (I have no source for this) introduced the minhag we have today of reciting some relevant p'sukim about Shabbat to make a declaration of \"k'dusha\" so it doesn't look like any ordinary wine-drinking.</p>\n\n<p>Sufficient on Shabbat is just the verse starting \"Al Kein Beirach\" followed by the blessing on wine. On Yom Tov just the verse starting \"vayedaber Moshe es moadei Hashem\" will suffice to keep this \"minhag\".</p>\n\n<p>There is no aspect of \"Bracha L'vatola\" for reciting Biblical verses such as these which is why you can recite them multiple times. (However for the B'racha on the wine it needs to be a separate drinking session, and you do of course have to drink, although b'di-eved it may be permitted to make the b'racha on behalf of someone else who is going to drink).</p>\n\n<p>There seem to be 2 questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Can I make the kiddush for someone else without being yotze</li>\n<li>Is this a problem if I want to make kiddush for my family later.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the first one I am suggesting that to be not yotze you would not drink the wine (you'd recite the b'racha and the person you are making kiddush for would respond \"Amen\" and drink) or participate in a seuda (kiddush must be b'makom seuda). Ask your Rav before doing this if you want to try it this way as there are issues with either of these.</p>\n\n<p>For the second one I can respond confidently that you can make kiddush for your family later even if you are already \"yotze\" due to the reasons I gave above.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Kiddush before coffee?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Commenting on the Shulchan Aruch in siman 289 which states that one may not taste anything before kiddush shabbos morning, except water, the Biur Halacha s.v. Chovas Kiddush writes that that it is simple that whoever has a hetter to eat before prayers, such as one who is eating for refuah, such as mentioned in siman 89 siff 3, must make kidush first.</p>\n\n<p>In siman 89 #22 brings various circumstances and details whether one can drink coffee before prayers are brought up. The Mishna Berurah ends the discussion by giving his hetter for someone to coffee for refuah. This is obviously not using a 'coffee is only water' hetter as the Shulchan Aruch there allowed water as well. The hetter for water is that it is not haughty to drink it before praying. Coffee, as mentioned, needed the logic of refuah to be allowed.</p>\n\n<p>So, does this person need to make kiddush before he drinks his coffee? It would seem he does, but as far as I know, nobody makes kiddush before having a cup of coffee shabbos morning before shul. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to Igros Moshe in Orach Chaim chelek 2 siman 26 one would not make kiddush to drink coffee.</p>\n\n<p>He says he only rules with that Biur Halacha when one needs to eat real bread or pas habaa bikisnin which is real bread if someone is kovea seuda on it. As opposed to cooked grains which are never considered bread, when eating these for refuah, one would not need to make kiddush first. </p>\n\n<p>He adds that according to the opinion of Magen Avraham which states a person fulfills his obligation of kiddush bimakom seuda with minei targima, this is not so simple, but there are those that argue on him, so we can make a sfek sfeika to say this person does not need to make kiddush. Being so, why would we tell him to drink something for kidush which is assur for him to drink being that it is not for refuah. He ends off saying it seems more likely to him that this person would not need to make kiddush as he mentioned in his first letter. (I'm not sure if that letter is available).</p>\n\n<p>Getting back to our coffee, Reb Moshe's svara would definitely help to say one does not and should not make kiddush in order to drink coffee. Even more so because nobody would say you can use coffee in place of real bread for kiddush bimakom seuda.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>No, he does not have to make the Kidush before the Coffee. \nThere is the rule of Kidush Bimkom Se'uda (to make the kidush in the place where you are about to dine), which originates from the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow\">words of the Rashbam on Bavli, Psachim, page 100</a> (\"רב הונא ורבה ואביי כולהו סברי בסמוך אין קידוש אלא במקום סעודה וכן פסק במגילת סתרים\"), and therefore it is not even a Machloikes (meaning all poiskim agree on that one).</p>\n\n<p>Further more, that din would also apply in the event of eating before the Prayer. In that event it is a bit more complicated since there are opinions that he should perform the Kidush before eating, even before the Tefila, such is the opinion of the Mishna Berura, but \"LaHalacha\", you should not perform Kidush because of the opinions that you do not perform the Kidush before the Tefila.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm not doing a literal translation.)</p>\n\n<p>Let's say while borrowing the tefillin, the strap tears accidentally. Is the person liable to pay for or replace the strap?</p>\n\n<p>The person is considered a \"sho'el\" - borrower. Under the normal principles of borrowing, he is liable for all damages. However, in this case, perhaps, the strap was so weak already that it may have torn anyway the next time the owner would have put it on. (I.e. - at the time the borrower took the tefillin, there were no noticeable signs of a weak strap or any other noticeable damage, but something accidental occurred. Chances are, if there was some noticeable weak strap, the person might not have borowed the strap to start, as a torn strap would make the tefillin <em>pasul</em>, and the borrower wouldn't care to take the risk, and would rather have borrowed a sturdier pair.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, if it is assumed that the owner allows anyone to use his tefillin automatically, does the owner in a sense relinquish unknown borrowers from accidental damage as well?</p>\n\n\n",

He started getting used to using his left hand for everything, writing, throwing, everything.</p>\n\n<p>By the time his cast came off, his left hand was permanently stronger and he was behaving entirely as a lefty. This all happened when he was twelve. Then comes Bar Mitzvah time. What to do.</p>\n\n<p>I was asked to be the messenger and ask Reb Dovid Feinstein the next time I saw him.\nHis answer was that the boy was still considered a righty. He explained his logic as follows. A person who has his right arm amputated does not become a lefty just because he starts to use that hand now does he? Will you pattur him from putting Teffilin on his left arm now? Of course not! He is still a righty and must continue to wear Teffilin on his left arm. So too retraining oneself does not change anything.</p>\n\n<p>Wait, there's more. This family has close ties to Rabbi Siff, also from the lower east side. They told him the story and he ruled that he believes that the boy is now a lefty, and should wear Teffilin accordingly on his right arm. </p>\n\n<p>The end of the story is that this is in fact the ruling the family went with due to their relationship with Rabbi Siff.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately by checking off my answer you've made me feel compelled to provide more than just a story.</p>\n\n<p>In reality this is an old machlokes. See in siman 27 the Mishna Berurah and Biur Halacha that Fred quoted in his comments who says in the name of the Magen Avraham who quotes a Beis Yosef quoting Mordechai that says one who trains himself to be a lefty is treated as one. The Magen Avraham though points out that the Mordechai brings two opinions.</p>\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan in that siman siff 17 brings this issue and says it's a machlokes. In the parenthesis he mentions that he thinks the Ramma's opinion in the Darkei Moshe is that switching usage will change the halacha. He is apparently referencing the Darkei Moshe Ha'Aruch #6. The funny thing is that the footnote there brings a different girsa in the Mordechai that read one is only a lefty if he is born that way.</p>\n\n<p>One more interesting point is that the Aruch HaShulchan says there is a kol shekein that someone who became ill and lost use of his right hand would certainly be a lefty. He also quotes an anonymous opinion of someone who wanted to compare these cases to someone who loses their hand but dismisses this as irrelevant. This is the opinion of the Biur Halacha. </p>\n\n\n",

And it is according to this perception that we refer to Him with these terms, Merciful, Ruler, Strong, Judge, etc... and we do not say that because of this He in His perfection has these attributes in these particularly measurements, but rather it is all according to His will, and He can change it at will.  And on the contrary, according to His perfect completeness we cannot give any measure at all.  However, since he has chosen to use these attributes, and to act through them, therefore we use these terms.  And we are not to understand when we say that He is merciful, that He in His essence is so, like we would say about a person who has this character trait in him to be merciful, that such is ingrained in his nature... as we are not to think such a thing at all, as it is impossible to know about Him that which He is in His essence.  But when we call Him merciful, we are meant to understand that He wants to act with a certain attribute which is mercy, which is not according to His essence, but is in accordance with the state of the created existence... (translation mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Hashem neither acquired nor started with His qualities - He, in His essence, has no qualities that we can discuss.</p>\n<p>In response to the second point, Ramchal in Derech Hashem 1:2:2 seems to imply the reverse - that which is given to a person may be lower than that which he achieves on his own, but that which is innate and inherent to something is the highest level:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי הנה הוא יתברך שמו שלם בעצמו, ולא במקרה, אלא מצד אמיתת עניינו מוכרח בו השלימות, ומשוללים ממנו החסרונות בהכרח. ואולם זה אי אפשר שיימצא בזולתו, שיהיה אמיתתו מכרחת לו השלימות ומעדרת ממנו החסרונות. אך להתדמות לזה במקצת, צריך שלפחות יהיה הוא הקונה השלימות שאין אמיתת עניינו מכריח לו, ויהיה הוא מעדיר מעצמו החסרונות שהיו אפשריים בו</p>\n<p>He is perfect in essence, and not incidentally, but inherent in the G-d concept is that perfection is by definition, and all deficiencies are absent by definition.  However, this is impossible to exist by anything other than Him, that perfection should be by definition.  However, to be a little bit like Him, it is necessary to at least acquire the perfection which is not by definition, and be the one who prevents the possible deficiencies from himself...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramchal sets up Hashem's innate perfection as the pedestal that we try to come close to in some small way by achieving our own perfection.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Saying G-d is good or bad is an anthropomorphism. G-d created what we call good and bad, and it is thus within G-d. Thus we equate holiness and G-dliness with good, because based on the mitzvot following in the ways of holiness is \"good\". </p>\n\n<p>So G-d has not acquired good...good was created. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Hashem is Goodness itself. The point of Bechira is to bring out the potential goodness you have. Whether or not you will triumph over your evil desires depends on how good you really are. The merit of tested goodness over untested is merely that it was shown to be deeply good. Hashem is the source of all good.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the power a person has to overcome his desires is all from Hashem. The question during a Nesayon is how much Godliness you have. God is God.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, as it turns out, the Ramchal explains that the purpose of creation was in fact to create a scenario in which the good will overcome the evil. Hashem did in fact set up an existence in which there is apparently evil in operation, just so that there will be a triumph of the good.</p>\n\n<p>So, the answer is: both.</p>\n\n\n",

Here he is addressing Korach <em>and</em> his crew. There is no other easy for the Torah to describe this. He is addressing them by calling on them as \"כל עדתו\".</p>\n\n<p>He might be also hinting at the message of the wife of On ben Peles, that they don't gain by fighting Moshe since they are still not leaders. Instead of following Moshe they'd be following Korach. This is why he is calling them כל עדתו, his whole group, instead of y'all.

Lubavitch [however], certainly believes that the Rebbe is still the Nasi HaDor. No matter who you’ll ask in Lubavitch, even the most vocal person who speaks out against saying the Rebbe is Moshiach - [if] you’ll ask him, \"Who do you believe is your Nasi, is your leader and the leader of this generation?\" he will certainly say that it’s the Rebbe. And that belief is the universal belief of all Lubavitch and many people outside of Lubavitch, who daven Nusach Ashkenaz, who follow Non-Chabad minhagim, who do not consider themselves to be Lubavitch. But many of them are afraid to come out openly, and to say that that’s what their belief is. Although some of them have</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They believe that he inherited this title from the Sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe. As the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe constantly referred to his father-in-law as the Nasi Hador (even post death). </p>\n\n<p>As told to me by many Lubavitcher Shluchim-emissaries, the basis for this belief is that the Lubavitcher Rebbe was at one point the most recognized Rabbinical figure in the world, his opinions were sought after by politicians, gentiles and other Rabbinic figures. To a certain degree his opinions were taken as a legitimate representation of Judaism. And as Nasi Hador, all of the Jewish peoples souls are included within his soul, this is known as \"Neshama Haklalis\". Therefore, every Jew and his soul are intertwined and tied up with the soul of the Nasi Hador even if they are unaware of this. Thus, Chabad Chassidim believe that the Lubavitcher is the Rebbe and leader for everyone. </p>\n\n<p>The implications of this belief are twofold. Firstly, from the Lubavitch perspective. Non acceptance of this belief from other non Lubavitch Jews is viewed with astonishment, they ask questions such as \"how could you not follow his every directive? He is the Nasi Hador!?\". However, from the non-Lubavitch perspective, this claim to title is very hard to understand, for (excluding those that follow the opinions of Maran Rav Schach) they look at the Lubavitcher Rebbe as a man of greatness who did many good things for the Jewish people and observance of mitzvos. But that doesn't obligate one to profess belief in assigning an official title of supremacy to him. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, some Jews have a hard time understanding why the Lubavitcher Rebbe cannot be viewed within the whole of the rest of the Rabbinical Intelligentsia, rather than needing to elevate him above and beyond other Rabbinical figures. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/143692/jewish/Call-from-the-Chief-Rabbi-of-Israel.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Chabad website</a> may offer an answer to parts 2 and 3 of your question. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But, above all, the Rebbe loved the People of Israel. It is the\n  signature of his leadership and the enduring hallmark of the students\n  who follow in his footsteps: genuine, boundless and unconditional love\n  to each and every one of our brethren. From the rabbi and the\n  community leader to the simple layman, from the elder venerable\n  Chassid to the young child with hand outstretched to receive a coin\n  for charity, from the captain of industry to the woman who came to\n  pour her heart out in sorrow. Tirelessly and selflessly, the Rebbe\n  dedicated his most precious commodity, his time, to the welfare of his\n  fellow, remote and lonely as he or she may be. Hours on end the Rebbe\n  stood to greet the many who sought his guidance and blessing. From his\n  modest dwelling in Brooklyn, New York, his reach extended to the\n  far-flung corners of the globe. Thousands of shuls, mikvahs, yeshivas,\n  schools and outreach centers have been created around the world -- not\n  for the benefit of his own Chassidim, but for the benefit of all Jews.\n  Indeed then, he was not simply the Rebbe of Lubavitch; he was the\n  Rebbe of Klal Yisrael. The flourishing success of other groups, not\n  only among Chassidic circles but even the broader Yeshiva world and\n  the Jewish community at large, is in large measure due to the Rebbe\n  and his trailblazing efforts to establish, sustain and broaden Jewish\n  life wherever it may be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems that R' Menachem Mendel Schneerson z”l was the  Rebbe of Klal Yisrael in that his concerns were with all Jews rather than just with his own chassidim. </p>\n\n<p>How this belief is viewed in Chabad might be inferred by this quote (Posted Sunday, Nov 10 2013 2:37pm in Jewish News ) from a <a href=\"http://www.shmais.com/chabad-news/item/can-a-rabbi-of-a-shul-with-700-families-kah-feel-small-insignificant-copy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chabad site</a>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Hahn not only has close connections to our community, but also\n  has become a dear friend and colleague.  A few years ago, he and his\n  family moved to Spokane, Washington, to create the Chabad of Spokane.\n   I remember asking him then why he chose Spokane and being blown away\n  by his reply.  He explained that there is a waiting list to go out and\n  open a new Chabad house.  One jumps at the first opportunity given to\n  him without hesitating or asking questions. </p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Hahn explained to me that the Rebbe believed in sending a\n  shliach to any place that has even one Jewish resident.  At first I\n  thought this to be  inefficient, but after further consideration I\n  realized, would we not go anywhere in the world to show love and\n  concern for even one of our children no matter where he or she may be\n  found?  To the Rebbe and to his loyal Chabad shluchim, every Jew is a\n  precious child deserving of mesirus nefesh, selfless dedication and\n  devotion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It can be inferred that the principles underlying R' Menachem Mendel Schneerson's z”l role as the Rebbe of Klal Yisrael are alive and well in Chabad. </p>\n\n\n",

It is only after the angel, who is present at the time of birth, touches the upper lip of the child as it enters the body to be born, that this memory of all the Torah it had learned is wiped from the child. Surprisingly, this tradition from Rabbi Simlai also makes an allusion to Spain. It should also be noted that this idea of touching the upper lip, beneath the nostrils, seems to also correspond to the idea mentioned in  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 2:7</a> that G-d blows the Living Soul into the nostrils of Adam HaRishon.</p>\n\n\n",

Here's my proof:  I first corresponded with the Company.  The Company said the Star-K certifies their hescher as being legitimate.  STAR-K is a universally accepted kosher certifier.  I called the STAR-K and they confirmed the KA-Kosher products out of Mexico are approved by STAR-K.  Also, per KA's web site, the head masgiach of KA-Kosher is a BMG graduate.  The question I asked Ka-Kosher is why not show this on their web site?  Never heard back on that one.  Anyway, my Rabbi, Rabbi Aaron Gruman of E.

It seems very likely that this would be very similar if not identical to the usage of the Rambam.

At times, the  term  has  a definite  connotation.

Finally, sod is used, at times, in a more general way, indicating that there is some difficulty in the verse that has to be clarified or some  contradiction  that  has  to  be  resolved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One example where Rabbenu Avraham uses the term to refer to a non-kabbalistic idea, is in Rabenu Avraham's commentary to Genesis (26:20) in which he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יובן מזה סוד גדול כי האבות ע\"ה עם כל עושרם הגדול ונכסיהם המרובים לא היו עסוקים בעניניהם הגשמיים ועסקם האמתי ובילוי זמנם והתעסקות מחשבתם היתה רק לרכוש ענינים רוחניים וכאשר התגלע ריב ועסק מן אותה הבאר קרא אותה (יצחק) עשק כלו' באר זו נתנה לנו עשק במה שאין בטבענו להעסק בו </p>\n  \n  <p>It  is  understood  from  here  a  great  deep  secret  that  the  forefathers  with all  their  great wealth and their many possessions, did not really busy themselves with physical matters, but their true involvement and their time spent and their mental effort was only to acquire spiritual things.  And when the quarrel erupted with the trouble from that well, he (Isaac) called  it esek (trouble), i.e. “this well caused me trouble about that which I do not by nature become troubled (Trans. R. Labaton p. 269-9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Its place should be somewhere in vayikra where other 'tumos' are  mentioned.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>Answer to Question 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch states on 20:19 that their were two main \"Crown highways\" leading through Edom. The first and most convenient road דרך המלך was the main high road leading through the valley where there were fields and vinyards and along which the wells were dug. That is why Moshe specified the condition \"we will not pass through fields or vinyards or drink the water from the well, we will stick to the highroad and not turn aside to the right and the left:.</p>\n\n<p>When this was refused, the messengers asked to be allowed to use the more difficult mountain route במסילה נעלה and to pay even for any water from the mountain stream along the route, even though it is normally free for all travelers.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, Edom would not have to give thaem anything at all except permission to cross the land.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says on 20:22 that this is to emphasize that the death of Aharon was solely because of what happened at Kadesh with מי מריבה and it was his time to die. Thus he would have died at this point no matter what the response of Edom had been.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer to question 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch states that Moshe is to take the mateh in order to show that he is acting as the messenger of Hashem. However, hitting the rock with the mateh would imply that this is a special intervention from Hashem as a result of the uproar. Moshe is to take the staff \"show them that you are still my messenger\", but speak to the rock to show that it was Hashem who led them here and </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... the required water was already provided by Hashem at the place to\n  which He had directed them, and it mereley required a word from Moshe\n  and Aharon to the rock which would suffice for it to produce the water\n  which Hashem had placed ready for them</p>\n  \n  <p>... without any fresh miracle, simply with a word from you, <strong>you</strong> are to\n  provide them with a sufficiency for their undeniably present\n  requirements.</p>\n  \n  <p>This manner of obtaining the water would have convinced the people of\n  the deep wrong they had done in accusing Moshe and Aharon of leading\n  them to this waterless place against the will of Hashem; whereas water\n  gushing fort only as a result of a blow could still leave room for the\n  assumption that their having been led into the wilderness of Tzin wa\n  originally a wilful arbitrary act on the part of Moshe and Aharon and\n  only subsequently their justified revoltand their pressing need\n  brought about the merciful miracle of Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the first time in Beshalach he was instructed to hit the rock to show that this was an explicit miracle by Hashem just as the makos in Mitzraim or the splitting of the Yam Suf which also used the mateh.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Sorotzkin in Oznayim Latorah states that the speaking actually was not to the rock but was to teach the Bnai Yisrael Torah and to raise their spiritual level to the point that they would have deserved the miracle of the water coming from the rock themselves (with no further action by Moshe). Moshe was to take the mateh as a \"Plan B\" only if Bnai Yisrael could not reach that level. The error was that he concluded that Bnai Yisrael could not be raised to that level and he required the explicit miracle of hitting the rock.  This should have been delayed until <strong>after</strong> he had attempted to raise the Bnai Yisrael to that level.</p>\n\n<p>Note that this also explains why Moshe Rabbeinu was instructed to hit the rock in Beshalach, since they were not yet at the higher level.</p>\n\n\n",

This is because they were the progenators of the human race, and whatever defect they caused on their souls would be transferred and imprinted onto all future generations:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the Lurianic systemisation of preceding Kabbalah, the\n  anthropomorphic designation for Adam Kadmon describes its arrangement\n  of the latent future sephirot in the harmonised configuration of man.\n  However, Adam Kadmon itself is divine light without vessels, including\n  all subsequent creation only in potential. This exalted\n  anthropomorphism denotes that man is both the theocentric purpose of\n  future creation, and the anthropocentric embodiment of the divine\n  manifestations on high. This mythopoetic cosmogenesis and\n  anthropogenesis enables the \"Adam soul\" to embody all human souls: the\n  collective Yechidah (\"singular\") soul essence in Adam Kadmon, and the\n  collective Neshamah (\"soul\") revealed soul in the Biblical Adam\n  Ha-Rishon in the Garden of Eden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, when Chava caused Adam to sin, she caused damage not only to her soul, but also that damage became imprinted upon all future souls. </p>\n\n<p>We find this concept in the Talmud:</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara says in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 55a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב אמי אין מיתה בלא חטא</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Ami said: \"There is no death without sin\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara says <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%91%D7%90_%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%99%D7%96_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in Bava Basra</a> (17a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תנו רבנן ארבעה מתו בעטיו של נחש</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rabbis learned: \"There were four who died only on account of the\n  \"Hit of the Snake\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi explains: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בעטיו של נחש - בעצתו של נחש כלומר לא היו ראוין למות אלא שנגזרה גזירת\n  מיתה על כל תולדותיו של אדם הראשון בעצתו של נחש בעטיו תרגום של עצתו\n  כדכתיב (דניאל ו) אתייעטו כל וגו' וכן התיב עטא וטעם (שם ב):</p>\n  \n  <p>The hit of the Snake: from the advice of the snake, meaning that\n  really before the sin, Man was not meant to die, but it was decreed upon\n  the progeny of Adam Harishon that they would be subject to death due to the advice of the snake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, with the Idea of the Arizal quoted above in conjunction with the Gemara passages with Rashi's commentary it demonstrates for us that the punishment of pain in child labor, just like death, would be applied not just to her, but to all future woman -  as her soul, which included all future souls to be born were imprinted with this blemish.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>all humans must also die because of Adam and Chava. this is not a punishment but a consequence.

Thus, the action and the results affected the entire creation which caused the rest of humanity to be on the level that continued.</p>\n\n<p>See Rav Hirsch on 3:16</p>\n\n<p>(From memory) I think that Rabbi Leibtag had a posting from Virtual Bais Medrash that discussed that what was done at this point established the \"Laws of Nature\" for the future.

    "title": "Parshas Chukas: Hitting the rock vs. Talking to the rock",
    "content": "# Parshas Chukas: Hitting the rock vs. Talking to the rock\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Hashem is angered that Moshe hits the rock instead of following His specific instruction to speak to the rock. “Hashem said to Moshe and Aharon: Because you did not believe in me to sanctify me in the eyes of the Children of Israel, therefore you will not bring this congregation to the land which I have given them.” [ibid 20:12]. Here, Rashi explains that Hashem is saying, “Had you spoken to the rock, and it would have brought forth water, I would have been sanctified before the eyes of the Assembly, and they would have said ‘Just as this rock, which neither speaks nor hears and does not need sustenance nevertheless fulfills the will of Hashem, how much more so should we fulfill His word.’” [Rashi, ibid]. </p>\n\n<p>At first glance, this seems difficult to understand. When Moshe hits the rock, it still brings forth water. Given that the Children of Israel do not know that Hashem commanded Moshe to speak to the rock, surely, whether Moshe hits the rock or speaks to it, they see the rock produce water and deduce that if a rock obeys Hashem, how much more so should humans obey Him. What is the special significance of speaking to the rock? Why can’t the same message come across though hitting it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch states that Moshe is to take the mateh in order to show that he is acting as the messenger of Hashem. However, hitting the rock with the mateh would imply that this is a special intervention from Hashem as a result of the uproar. Moshe is to take the staff \"show them that you are still my messenger\", but speak to the rock to show that it was Hashem who led them here and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... the required water was already provided by Hashem at the place to\n  which He had directed them, and it merely required a word from Moshe\n  and Aharon to the rock which would suffice for it to produce the water\n  which Hashem had placed ready for them</p>\n  \n  <p>... without any fresh miracle, simply with a word from you, you are to\n  provide them with a sufficiency for their undeniably present\n  requirements.</p>\n  \n  <p>This manner of obtaining the water would have convinced the people of\n  the deep wrong they had done in accusing Moshe and Aharon of leading\n  them to this waterless place against the will of Hashem; whereas water\n  gushing forth only as a result of a blow could still leave room for the\n  assumption that their having been led into the wilderness of Tzin was\n  originally a wilful arbitrary act on the part of Moshe and Aharon and\n  only subsequently their justified revolt and their pressing need\n  brought about the merciful miracle of Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the first time in Beshalach he was instructed to hit the rock to show that this was an explicit miracle by Hashem just as the makos in Mitzraim or the splitting of the Yam Suf which also used the mateh.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Sorotzkin in Oznayim Latorah states that the speaking actually was not to the rock but was to teach the Bnai Yisrael Torah and to raise their spiritual level to the point that they would have deserved the miracle of the water coming from the rock themselves (with no further action by Moshe). Moshe was to take the mateh as a \"Plan B\" only if Bnai Yisrael could not reach that level. The error was that he concluded that Bnai Yisrael could not be raised to that level and he required the explicit miracle of hitting the rock. This should have been delayed until after he had attempted to raise the Bnai Yisrael to that level.</p>\n\n<p>Note that this also explains why Moshe Rabbeinu was instructed to hit the rock in Beshalach, since they were not yet at the higher level.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://divreichaim.blogspot.com/2010/06/amazing-yalkut-shimoni-on-sin-of-mei.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">an amazing yalkut shimoni on the sin of mei meriva</a></p>\n\n<p>Not to be missed among the many views of what Moshe did wrong at Mei Meriva is the opinion of Yalkut Shimoni (remez 564):</p>\n\n<p>יען לא האמנתם בי ארבע חטאות כתובין כאן לא האמנתם, לא קדשתם, מעלתם, מריתם, לא האמנתם שלא אמרתי לכם להכות והכית אותו. ולא קדשתם לעיני כל ישראל להוציא להם מים מכל סלע שרוצים, מעלתם אמרת המן הסלע הזה, מריתם ודברתם אל הסלע שנה עליו פרק אחד ועברת על דברי.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sin of “not speaking” according to the Yalkut does not mean not\n  ordering the rock to produce water, but rather refers to the sin of\n  not studying Torah near the rock. Moshe should have responded to the\n  demand for water by sitting and learning! Hitting the rock to produce\n  water undoubtedly demonstrated Hashem’s miraculous power, but it did\n  not demonstrate the power of Torah, and it was for that specific\n  crucial failing that Moshe was blamed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://divreichaim.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-haflaah-on-moshes-sin-mei-meriva.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Hafla'ah on Moshe's sin -- mei meriva</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We once discussed <a href=\"http://divreichaim.blogspot.com/2010/06/amazing-yalkut-shimoni-on-sin-of-mei.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> the amazing Chazal that says the “dibartem el\n  ha’sela” that Moshe was supposed to do instead of hitting the rock was\n  to learn Torah.  Chasam Sofer (brief version here at the end of Shu”T\n  E”H 121, longer version in his commentary on chumash) adds another\n  dimension to this interpretation that he heard from the Hafla’ah. \n  Chazal interpret the complaint of thirst in Parshas Beshalach as not\n  just a thirst for water, but as a thirst for Torah; the takana of\n  kri’as haTorah on Monday/Thursday was a response to this need.  No\n  longer would there be “va’yelchu shloshes yamim b’li mayim;” no longer\n  would there be three days without public learning.</p>\n  \n  <p>The episode of mei meriva in our parsha occurred right after the death\n  of Miriam.  It was in her zechus that there was a well in the desert;\n  with her death, the well vanished.  The thirst of the people returned,\n  but again, it was not just a thirst for water, but a thirst for Torah\n  as well.  However, this time around Moshe and Aharon were in aveilus\n  for their sister.  They could not learn torah or teach Klal Yisrael! \n  “Lu gavan’u b’gva acheinu lifnei Hashem,” the people complained – had\n  we died earlier, it would at least have been “lifnei Hashem,”\n  enveloped by ruchniyus; now, we have nothing. </p>\n  \n  <p>The Midrash says the sin of Moshe and Ahraon was not learning even one\n  perek or one halacha to satisfy their needs. Explains the Hafla’ah,\n  they could have learned perek “eilu megalchin; they could have learned\n  a din in hilchos aveilus.  There is never a need or an excuse to\n  completely abandon learning.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Chasam Sofer (al haTorah) adds his own two cents to this idea. \n  Why in the earlier episode of thirst in Parshas Beshalach was Moshe\n  commanded to hit the rock but this time he was told to speak to it? \n  There are different ways to combat the yetzer ha’ra.  One way is the\n  brute force method – crush it into oblivion.  That method is\n  symbolized by the hitting of the rock that took place shortly after\n  yetzi’as Mitzrayim.  Forty years later a more mature Bnei Yisrael was\n  ready to appreciate another approach to combating the yetzer –\n  “mashcheyhu l’beis ha’medrash,” redirecting its energy to a positive\n  goal.  Moshe was supposed to engage in talmud torah to demonstrate\n  that the stubborn rock could be harnessed for good as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Marital relations if pregnancy is potentially life-threatening?",
    "content": "# Marital relations if pregnancy is potentially life-threatening?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A while ago, I was poking around the Catholic section of Reddit, since I was curious about how the topic of birth control might be handled within it. In a comment to <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/26mlav/hard_question_but_kind_of_a_dead_horse_topic_when/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">one post</a>, someone stated that his girlfriend was diabetic and could only have very carefully planned pregnancies, as pregnancy could jeopardize her life. In response, another commentor argued that the \"correct\" Catholic response would still prohibit use of \"artificial\" birth control methods.</p>\n\n<p>These questions (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/39015/9535\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/50333/9535\">2</a>) suggests that there's <em>some</em> general precedent as to what \nhappens if the woman <em>does</em> get pregnant, but that's not my concern here. I'm more interested in this: in such a scenario, where pregnancy must either be entirely planned or averted, has there been any halachic precedent for whether the couple should still marital relations, and if so, whether birth control (or at least some forms of the such) is permissible?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/17079/9535\">This post</a> suggests that the solution isn't to not use birth control or abstain, but I would prefer a more explicit address of the problem.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note: this sounds like the sort of scenario where the advice to CYLOR would be extremely pertinent, but I am asking purely out of curiosity.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There is 100%, crystal-clear, absolute precedent in Jewish law for birth control if pregnancy would endanger the mother.</p>\n<p>Talmud, Ketubot 39a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תני רב ביבי קמיה דרב נחמן שלש נשים משמשות במוך אלו הן קטנה ומעוברת ומניקה קטנה שמא תתעבר ותמות מעוברת שמא תעשה עוברה סנדל מניקה שמא תגמול את בנה</p>\n<p>Rabbi Bibi taught before Rav Nachman: three women may/should/must [commentaries debate the language here] use a cloth [as a mechanical barrier]: one who is too young; pregnant; or nursing. Too young, as pregnancy may kill her. Pregnant, as it may harm the fetus. Nursing, as it may dry up her milk supply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Irrespective of exactly which cases the Talmud was discussing and whether we'd encounter them today, the theory is quite clear: we are not Catholics! Judaism very much allows at least some methods of birth control due to certain health concerns.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (d. NYC 1986), for instance, has responsa where the questions include: the parents have anxiety disorders; mom gets severe postpartum depression (where he writes explicitly that <em>I don't want to do anything</em> depression can easily slide into <em>I want to hurt someone including myself</em> depression, God forbid); and allowing adequate recovery time from C-sections.</p>\n<p>Obviously, please consult your local rabbi regarding particular needs and methods. If you can't do so for any reason, try emailing yoatzot.org.</p>\n\n\n",

Never did the Gaon come with prepared solutions to the gemara. He never discussed only those parts of the daf where he had something to be mechadesh….he strove for clarity in the pshat of the Gemara…He would never turn to the other Rishonim until Rashi and Tosafos were clear: in particular, he would get annoyed if one went right away to the Rambam…he eschewed any attempt at pilpul, and stressed the careful understanding of an inyan rather than hasty coverage of subject matter.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Lorch 41-42)</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the approach of the Chassam Saufer derech (which he likely learned from his rabbanim in Frankfurt) was to approach the Gemara with the aim of understanding, first with the text and then if necessary with Rashi and Tausefaus. If this was clear, he might continue by studying the other Rishonim presented in the back of the Gemara, although he would avoid pilpul.</p>\n\n<p>My grandfather ז”ל, who grew up in the Frankfurt IRG recalled that in the yeshiva, they also stressed the learning of Tanach, including Nevi'im and Ketuvim, not only Torah itself.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Shamshon Raphael Hirsch Yeshiva known as Breuer's learns in the classic Lithuanian yeshiva model, IE.

As opposed to the Hildeshimer Seminary, which was started by Rav Ezriel Hildesheimer. These two great men differed in approaches. Rav Berel Wein puts it like <a href=\"http://www.rabbiwein.com/Orthodox-Response-to-Modernitybr4-Lectures-P139.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Though closely associated with Rabbi Shimshon Rafoel Hirsch, Rabbi\n  Hildesheimer's view of \"Torah im derech eretz\" differed slightly. He\n  saw secular studies as necessary, but unlike Rabbi Hirsch, did not\n  believe they were in any way spiritually uplifting. Yet at the same\n  time, he was much less of a separatist than Rabbi Hirsch and worked\n  alongside the Reform when the German government required it. Because\n  of this, he met with opposition on both sides of the Jewish spectrum,\n  yet his solutions to the challenge of modernity are echoed in the\n  current solutions implemented in the Jewish world today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, knowing the history of both institutions, there would be no expectation that the Breuers yeshiva would have a similar approach to the Hildesheimer Seminary. </p>\n\n<p>From my own exsposure to students from the Breuers yeshiva, they generally move on after highschool or a couple of years in the Beis Medrash program to other mainstream yeshivas such as Long Beach, Mir Jerusalem, Lakewood, Brisk, Passaic etc.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is trying to get out of jury duty permitted halachically?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the comments on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/10245/472\">this question about being on a jury when a trial could run into Shabbat</a>, somebody brought up the point that it's generally not hard to avoid jury duty.  And, in my experience, lots of people try to \"get out\" of jury duty when they receive a summons, usually successfully.  I am wondering if such avoidance is permitted under <em>halacha</em>.  (I am not talking about <em>deferring</em> service, for example to avoid <em>yom tov</em> conflicts, but not serving at all.)</p>\n\n<p>For purposes of this question, assume the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In the US (I won't speak for other countries), being judged by a jury of impartial \"regular people\" (not judges, not lawyers, etc) is an important part of the justice system.  If everybody avoided jury duty the system would break down.  On the other hand, there are more eligible jurors than are actually needed, most of the time.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you are randomly selected for jury duty you're required to serve, and possibly be seated on a jury, unless you can demonstrate a significant hardship.</p></li>\n<li><p>Jury candidates are usually asked questions by lawyers for both sides and/or the presiding judge.  Jury candidates must affirm that they will tell the truth.  Some of these questions are pretty subjective (\"do you feel you could be fair under such-and-such conditions\", etc).  Giving the \"wrong\" answers generally leads to you not being chosen.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I assume that outright <em>lying</em> about either hardship or impartiality would be a problem.  But we can sometimes tell ourselves little half-truths that might or might not count as lying -- gee, I'd like to get out of jury duty, so maybe I would resent being stuck on the jury and that would affect my ability to judge the case fairly, and therefore I can say \"no I can't be impartial\".</p>\n\n<p>What does <em>halacha</em> say about avoiding jury duty?

He asks if a Beis Din which bigger in number or wisdom can argue on a previous Beis Din, why don't we find Amoraim arguing on Tanaim? He answers \"perhaps since the sealing of the Mishna, there was a general acceptance (kimu vikiblu) that the later generations would not argue on the previous ones. And this was done as well at the sealing of the Talmud, from the day it was sealed, no-one had permission to argue on it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Along this line of logic, we do find terms like Kim Li, and concerning a judge Mikabel Alai, which completely bind a person to a given ruling. The very fact that we accepted the Talmud as binding, is exactly what makes it binding.</p>\n\n<p>From here on is a related discussion, but not limited to Rambam's view.</p>\n\n<p>The Rosh in Sanhedrin chapter four #6 quoting the Baal HaMeor and Raavad who discuss arguing on Geonim, points to the gemara in Bava Basra 130b (#פ in Pilpulei Charifta) which states we cannot rule based on a teaching or a practice, until there is a ruling 'halacha limaaseh'. The Rosh seems to be saying that the later Amoraim's ruling for practice is the limaaseh based on the earlier teaching of the Shas. That is what makes it a ruling for us. But seemingly concerning any halacha in and of itself without a practical ruling, the Talmud itself says it should not be relied upon. So it is not so much that we are bound to Shas, but we are rather using the rulings of later Amoraim who used the shaas to rule. That is the binding factor from which we cannot deviate as we have nothing else to rely on. He leaves the idea possible that later generations could in fact argue on Geonim as long as they have a real proof from Shas. But while stating all this he takes for granted that no-one can argue on the explicit ideas that Ravina and Rav Ashi set up (סדר) in Shas. </p>\n\n<p>This idea that the very fact that Ravina and Rav  Ashi 'set up' Shas is what makes it binding might be understood by another couple of sources saying we cannot argue on the end halacha of Shas. \nThis would be the way the Or Zarua siman 753 understood the gemara in Bava Metzia 86a which states 'Ravina and Rav Ashi sof horaah'. He said \"we should not rely on any braisa or the Talmud Yerushalmi if it disagrees with the Bavli <em>because the Bavli was written in order to instruct practice (lihoros) to the Jewish people</em> , this is the meaning of Ravina and Rav Ashi were the end of Horaah. However it's always good to bring a proof or better understanding from those sources to the Bavli\". (Note this is not like Rashi's pshat there). According to him, our gemara told us we were bound to it  and it was written accordingly in a way to be binding.</p>\n\n<p>The Riff at the end of Eiruvin says a similar point as the Or Zarua that only the Bavli and not the Yerushalmi is binding. But his reasoning is different, more in tune with the Rosh. He says that \"the Bavli was finished later and the Babylonian Rabbis were more learned in the Jerusalem Talmud than us\" (I assume by 'us' he means Jews on the western front for whom he was writing, who might assume  they are not bound to the Bavli because they have the Yerushalmi, this he says is not true for the aforementioned reason). \nAgain, like in the Rosh, we find this idea of hilchisa kibasra. It is a matter of logistics. We need to rely on our Rabbis and the later ones were the most informed.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is one permitted to change one’s minhagim from Sefardi to Ashkenazi?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If a person grew up Sefardi, is he permitted to change his minhagim to Ashkenazi (including pronunciations)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I was told by a very well respected rebbe in the Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem that he, who was raised a sefardic home, was told by Rav Elyashiv that he was permitted to switch minhagim, including nusach hateffila, change his teffilin to Ksav Beis Yosef. But he still had to retain <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/6709/5514\">Chalak Beis yosef</a> meat in which ashkenazim are more lenient.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Elyashiv: </p>\n\n<p>Rav Eliashiv adds, though, that the prohibition against changing Minhagim is not without exception, as demonstrated by a ruling of the Chatam Sofer (Teshuvot Chatam Sofer, Choshen Mishpat 188). The Chatam Sofer was approached by members of a town where two Kehillot (communities), one Sephardic and one Ashkenazic, had formerly functioned. However, a pogrom had caused most of the Jews to leave, and since the remaining populace could not sustain two separate Minyanim, the two groups now had to combine into one functioning synagogue. The Chatam Sofer ruled that the remaining members of the community should choose which of the two synagogues would continue to function, whose Minhagim they then would follow. Rav Ovadia Yosef (Teshuvot Yabi’a Omer 6, Orach Chayim 10) cites numerous authorities who concur with the Chatam Sofer’s ruling.\nThe Chatam Sofer reasons that one may change from practicing all Ashkenazic traditions to practicing all Sephardic traditions and vice versa. Just as a non-Jew who converts to Judaism fully integrates into the Jewish community, so too may an Ashkenazic Jew fully integrate into a Sephardic community and vice versa. Rav Yosef Eliyahu Henkin (Eidut LeYisrael p. 162) similarly rules that if an Ashkenazic Jew decides to join a Sephardic community permanently, he may change his Nusach HaTefillah (liturgy) to the Sephardic one. He notes that historically, the entire Chassidic community changed from Nusach Ashkenaz to Nusach Sefard with the noble intention of praying in accordance with the mystical teachings of the Arizal.[4] Of course, one should consult with a Rav before deviating from any family practice, as great caution must be exercised before deviating from practices observed by one’s ancestors for generations.\nThis also explains the rulings of twentieth-century authorities like Teshuvot Igrot Moshe (Orach Chayim 1:158) and Teshuvot Yabi’a Omer (5, Orach Chayim 37) that Ashkenazic women who marry Sephardic men, or vice versa, should follow the husband’s traditional family practices.[5] Although doing so entails deviating from the wife’s family tradition, these Poskim apparently believe, as the Chatam Sofer asserts, that a Jew may fully integrate into the practices of a different Jewish community.\nBased on this, Rav Eliashiv rules regarding the case addressed to him that from the vantage point of Minhag, the son may continue to practice Torah in accordance with Ashkenazic tradition despite his Sephardic ancestry. Rav Hershel Schachter similarly rules that if someone was raised in a non-Chassidic community, he need not practice Chassidic Minhagim even if his paternal grandfather was Chassidic (see Beit Yitzchak 39:520). Indeed, most Modern Orthodox Ashkenazic Jews pronounce Hebrew differently than their European paternal forebears.[6]</p>\n\n<p>Further, I know someone whos brother sent this question into Rav Chaim Kanievsky and Rav Chaim permitted him to change his minhagim completely to Ashkenazic Minhagim.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Ovadia Yosef illustrated in the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.koltorah.org/halachah/once-a-sephardic-jew-always-a-sephardic-jew-by-rabbi-chaim-jachter%3Fformat=amp\" rel=\"noreferrer\">following story </a>was of the opinion that once a Sefardi - always a Sefardi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Ovadia Yosef and Rav Shlomo Amar Although I am unaware of Hacham\n  Ovadia addressing this particular issue in his voluminous writings or\n  in his son’s writings, I am aware of two situations in which Rav\n  Ovadia in practice ruled that once a Sepharadi, always a Sepharadi.\n  Rav Shlomo Amar told me the following story when he visited Teaneck’s\n  Congregation Shaarei Orah on Shabbat Nachamu of 5777: A young man\n  whose father was a Persian Jew and mother was a Yemenite Jew was\n  raised in his mother’s predominantly Yemenite neighborhood. His\n  maternal grandfather had a large influence upon him and trained him to\n  pray and read Torah in the distinctive Yemenite style. Upon reaching\n  the age of maturity, he posed a question to Rav Amar as to whether he\n  was permitted to follow the practice of his mother’s family or whether\n  he must adopt the more general Sephardic practice of his father and\n  his family. Rav Amar referred the young man to Hacham Ovadia who\n  instructed the young man to abandon Yemenite practice and change to\n  his father’s family practices. Rav Amar relates that the young man\n  followed Rav Ovadia’s ruling despite the considerable difficulty\n  involved in making this transition. The current president of\n  Congregation Shaarei Orah in Teaneck, Mr. Joshua Murad, relates a\n  similar story. Mr. Murad was raised in the overwhelmingly Ashkenazic\n  Jewish section of the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York\n  City. Both the synagogue and Yeshivot he attended were Ashkenazic, and\n  despite his father’s Sephardic origin, Mr. Murad practiced Ashkenazic\n  Halachah from A to Z. During his year of study in Israel when he was\n  eighteen years of age, Mr. Murad had the opportunity to meet Rav\n  Ovadia Yosef. Mr. Murad asked Rav Ovadia if he was obligated to return\n  to his ancestral Sephardic practices. Mr. Murad reports that Hacham\n  Ovadia insisted that he must “Machazir Atarah LeYoshenah,” “Restore\n  the crown to its original luster,” and fully observe Halachah in\n  accordance with Sephardic tradition. I am delighted to report that Mr.\n  Murad is very proud to be an enthusiastic follower of Rav Ovadia’s\n  ruling, to the extent that he currently serves as the devoted lay\n  leader of the Teaneck Sephardic congregation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>NO.</p>\n<p>First of all, regarding switching to Ashkenazi minhagim, Rav Ovadia forbids it. Ashkenazim are allowed to replace their Minhagim with the Sephardic Minhag, not the other way around. Sorry, but that’s how it is; <em>you're stuck a Sephardi</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, you are also ENTIRELY forbidden from adopting an Ashkenazi pronunciation over a Sephardi one. Because you are capable of pronouncing the Hebrew letters distinctly, pronouncing them differently would be considered speaking nonsense. In fact, many Rabbis, both Ashkenazi and Sephardi, have ruled that everyone should adopt distinct pronunciations of letters wherever possible (although that ruling is obviously not widely accepted).\nThere are tens of Rabbinical sources, many of them famous, one of the most persuading being the Yavetz. He was always extremely critical of his own congregation’s Hebrew pronunciation, writing about “our shame” and even “constant transgression” that he and his community couldn’t correctly pronounce Hebrew consonants. If he knew the correct pronunciations, he obviously would have tried adopting them.</p>\n<p>You already know good pronunciation. Your tradition from your parents is a privilege. Don’t allow yourself to forget it. Having an old Mesorah is valuable.</p>\n<p>Other sources include: Rav Yihya Yishai Hallewi’s \"Introduction to <em>Tephillath Kol Peh</em>\", Rav Ovadia Hadaya’s <em>Yaskil Avdi</em> volume II chapter 13, Rav Yehiel Weinberg’s <em>Sidrei Esh</em> vol.

They are important because they are currently the oldest extent manuscripts and texts of the Bible, as well as show the scrupulousness that scribes throughout the generations for thousands of years used when copying the texts. See <a href=\"https://www.probe.org/the-dead-sea-scrolls/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for an example: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After years of careful study, it has been concluded that the Dead Sea\n  Scrolls give substantial confirmation that our Old Testament has been\n  accurately preserved. The scrolls were found to be almost identical\n  with the Masoretic text. Hebrew Scholar Millar Burrows writes, “<strong>It is\n  a matter of wonder that through something like one thousand years the\n  text underwent so little alteration</strong>. As I said in my first article on\n  the scroll, ‘Herein lies its chief importance, supporting the fidelity\n  of the Masoretic tradition.'”\n  A significant comparison study was conducted with the Isaiah Scroll\n  written around 100 B.C. that was found among the Dead Sea documents\n  and the book of Isaiah found in the Masoretic text. <strong>After much\n  research, scholars found that the two texts were practically\n  identical. Most variants were minor spelling differences, and none\n  affected the meaning of the text</strong>.\n  One of the most respected Old Testament scholars, the late Gleason\n  Archer, examined the two Isaiah scrolls found in Cave 1 and wrote,\n  “Even though the two copies of Isaiah discovered in Qumran Cave 1 near\n  the Dead Sea in 1947 were a thousand years earlier than the oldest\n  dated manuscript previously known (A.D. 980), <strong>they proved to be word\n  for word identical with our standard Hebrew Bible in more than 95\n  percent of the text</strong>. The five percent of variation consisted chiefly\n  of obvious slips of the pen and variations in spelling.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretic_Text\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia</a> page as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The MT is widely used as the basis for translations of the Old\n  Testament in Protestant Bibles, and in recent years (since 1943) also\n  for some Catholic Bibles, although the Eastern Orthodox churches\n  continue to use the Septuagint, as they hold it to be divinely\n  inspired. <strong>In modern times the Dead Sea Scrolls have shown the MT to be\n  nearly identical to some texts of the Tanakh dating from 200 BCE but\n  different from others</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yigael Yadin remarked:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The great importance of the antiquity of the Dead Sea Scrolls,\n  therefore, lies in the fact that they belong to the period in which no\n  standardization of the holy scriptures had been effected. This is at\n  once obvious by comparing the text of the scrolls with that of the\n  translations on the one hand and the Masora on the other. <strong>What is\n  astonishing is that despite their antiquity and the fact that the\n  scrolls belong to this pre-standardization period, they are on the\n  whole almost identical with the Masoretic text known to us</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=13&article=357\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Most of the biblical manuscripts found at Qumran belong to the MT\n  tradition or family. This is especially true of the Pentateuch and\n  some of the Prophets</strong>. The well-preserved Isaiah scroll from Cave 1\n  illustrates the tender care with which these sacred texts were copied.\n  Since about 1700 years separated Isaiah in the MT from its original\n  source, textual critics assumed that centuries of copying and\n  recopying this book must have introduced scribal errors into the\n  document that obscured the original message of the author.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Isaiah scrolls found at Qumran closed that gap to within 500 years\n  of the original manuscript. <strong>Interestingly, when scholars compared the\n  MT of Isaiah to the Isaiah scroll of Qumran, the correspondence was\n  astounding. The texts from Qumran proved to be word-for-word identical\n  to our standard Hebrew Bible in more than 95 percent of the text.</strong> <strong>The\n  5 percent of variation consisted primarily of obvious slips of the pen\n  and spelling alterations</strong> (Archer, 1974, p. 25). <strong>Further, there were no\n  major doctrinal differences between the accepted and Qumran texts</strong> (see\n  Table 1 below). T<strong>his forcibly demonstrated the accuracy with which\n  scribes copied sacred texts, and bolstered our confidence in the\n  Bible’s textual integrity</strong> (see Yamauchi, 1972, p. 130).

These changes often seem to be scribal errors. There are some indications that either the Men of the Great Assembly or perhaps Chazal (the Rabbinic sages) emended some words in the Torah out of sensitivities to God's honor (see <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/717799/rabbi-jeremy-wieder/tiqqun-soferim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this lecture on tiqqun sofrim</a>).

    "content": "# The wicked rewarded here seemingly aren't rewarded in full. Fair?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm reading volume 1 of <em>Strive for Truth</em>, Rabbi Aryeh Carmell's English-language adaptation of <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Michtav Meeliyahu</em></a>, and one of the first essays cites <em>Chazal</em> as explaining that one reason good things happen to bad people is so that the bad people can be rewarded for their <em>mitzvos</em> in this world so that they do not instead get better reward in the afterlife.</p>\n\n<p>He questions why this is fair: after all, they did <em>mitzvos</em>, so why should they not get their reward where it's good? He offers two answers to that question:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Their <em>mitzvos</em> were earthly, viz done for ulterior motives rather than to fulfill God's will, so they deserve earthly reward rather than postmortem closeness to God.</li>\n<li>They would enjoy earthly reward but not closeness to God, as their postmortem desires will match their earthly ones, so He gives them reward they will enjoy.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That's good and well for explaining why the <em>quality</em> of wicked people's reward is diminished: according to the first answer, the quality of the reward matches the quality of the <em>mitzva</em> performance, and, according to the second, the reward is precisely what they would enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>But then there's the <em>quantity</em>. A previous essay says clearly that the entirety of pleasures to be found on earth for all time cannot compare to even a little bit of reward in the afterlife, and that's why there's no reward for <em>mitzvos</em> in this world. If that's the case, then where is the bulk of these wicked people's reward? They're getting rewarded in this world, which, yes, is the quality of reward they deserve, but aren't they missing out on the quantity they deserve? How is that just?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>We are dealing with real rishaim here, not just some guy who messed up and did something wrong. The point then is that Hashem doesn't want these real rishaim in Olam Habaah. In fact he gives them their reward in this world כדי לטרדן מן העולם הבא. If by them doing mitzvos they would get Olam Habaa, they would essentially be sneaking in with an undeserved reservation to an event they shouldn't be at. A rasha does not belong in Olam Habaa.</p>\n\n<p>But, since Hashem does not hold back reward from anyone, אינו מפקח שכר כל בריאה, He pays them back somehow. Sometimes they get a happy life. Sometimes their kids or grandkids get the reward in their place. Sometimes the 'reward' is that their kids are 'zoche' to torture Klal Yisroel, like the reward Orpa got. </p>\n\n<p>The point is not fairness in the way we or Hashem looks at it. It's just a matter of giving them something because they deserve something.</p>\n\n<p>That's the end of the answer.Here's another related Mishna in Avos.</p>\n\n<p>פרק ד - משנה ט \nרַבִּי יַנַּאי אוֹמֵר, אֵין בְּיָדֵינוּ לֹא מִשַּׁלְוַת הָרְשָׁעִים וְאַף לֹא מִיִּסּוּרֵי הַצַּדִּיקִים. </p>\n\n<p>פי׳ הברטנורה:\nאין בידינו. כמו לא הוה בידיה [יבמות ק''ה ע''א]. כלומר אין הדבר הזה ידוע לנו מדוע דרך רשעים צלחה ומפני מה הצדיקים מדוכאים ביסורין. פירוש אחר, אין לנו בזמן הגלות לא משלוה והשקט שרגיל הקב''ה לתת לרשעים כדי לטרדן מן העוה''ב, ואף לא מן היסורים המיוחדים לצדיקים שהן יסורים של אהבה שאין בהן בטול תורה. כלומר יצאנו מכלל רשעים שאין לנו השלוה שיש לרשעים, ולכלל צדיקים לא הגענו, שהיסורים שלנו אינן של אהבה כיסורי הצדיקים:</p>\n\n<p>פי׳  עיקר התוי׳ט:\n לא זו אף זו קתני, לא מבעיא שלות רשעים שאין בידינו, לפי שאנו יודעין שהוא רשע ורואים כי טוב לו. אלא אף זה יסורי הצדיקים שאפשר שנראה צדיק ואינו כן. והיינו דתנן ואף. מד''ש. ועתוי''ט: וקתני ואף דהא מלתא דפשיטא היא שאין בידינו השלוה אנתנו יגיעי הגלות, ובעי ר''י בזה לומר שלא נתיאש שנחשוב עצמנו כרשעים גמורים ושאבדה תקותנו ח''ו, ושגם אין אנו צדיקים ושכבר השלמנו מה שעלינו להשלים בתורה ובמצות. מד''ש:</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>For some reason, this makes me think of Esav selling the bechorah to Ya'akov - \"Hineh anocho holech lamus, v'lamah zeh li bechorah?\" Since the \"reward\" of the bechorah is only applicable after his own death, it has no NPV (net present value) to him. That's why Esav HaRasha (the quintessence of the type) can logically and rationally sell eternity for a bowlfull of soup - he's getting something for nothing!</p>\n\n<p>To a rasha, there is no value for reward that cannot be measured in the physical/temporal sense. To them, the marginal value of reward after death, even if it's infinitely greater in quantity than the reward during life, is ZERO. Therefore, the qauntity is irrelevant. </p>\n\n<p>Infinity*0=0</p>\n\n<p>Since the rasha doesn't value the reward, justice would demand that they receive ONLY THE WORTH OF THE GOOD AS THEY VALUE IT.

When it comes to the gray area in the middle, it depends on who you really are which will define the rest of your actions. The semi-rasha who happened to have done a few mitzvos clearly does not care about the mitzvos as being direct commandments from Hashem, otherwise he would have tried to work himself towards being a tzaddik. Therefore, although his good deeds require reward, they will be rewarded for in this world. However, the semi-tzaddik who spends his life working towards the right side of the spectrum, although he may have a number of aveiros on his list, those will be punished in this world rather than in the next world because they are really lower-leveled aveiros since they were not done purposely or specifically to go against the word of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

(Plus sources.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are two unrelated issues being conflated here.  One is the <em>halacha</em> of <em>makom kavuah</em>.  Your father is correct that it does not need to be a specific seat, as the Mogen Avrohom 90:34 writes that <em>makom kavuah</em> is satisfied within 4 amos.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you buy a specific seat, then you have a right to that seat. I am not buying a \"<em>makom kavuah</em>\" but rather a specific place (or the rights to use a specific place at a certain time) in the Shul.</p>\n\n<p>For one example in <em>halachic</em> literature where the exact location of the seats is clearly discussed, see <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1601&st=&pgnum=216\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Minchos Yitzchok 9:154</a> where he discusses the exact number of seats away from the wall or the aisle.  The person bought and has a right to exactly the 10th seat or whichever seat it is.</p>\n\n<p>While we're on the topic, I once saw a fascinating <em>teshuva</em> in which someone had purchased the aisle seat, and then the wall was knocked down and more seats were added.  He claimed that he had the right to the aisle seat and the shul said that his seat was in its original location and the new aisle seat was theirs to sell.  The Rov who was asked brought a very interesting proof - when the <em>yud</em> was taken from Sarai's name and replaced with the <em>hey</em>, the <em>yud</em> complained, and was consoled by being added to the beginning of Yehoshua's name.  However, isn't this a violation of the rights of the <em>hey</em> which was at the front of Yehoshua's name, and is now second?  You see from here that being at the front is not a right that has standing.

This means that of course if the person is a deceiver we don't give him anything, but if it is not known whether he is a deceiver or not, if he comes to ask for clothing we check after him — perhaps he is a deceiver — because he can survive  until the investigation. But if he requests bread we do not check after him, and we feed him immediately, because he might be starving and his pain would be great.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "How attached can one be to a Makom Kavua'?",
    "content": "# How attached can one be to a Makom Kavua'?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong><br>\nWhen I first joined my Shul, I floated between different Minyanim and didn't feel as though I truly had a set place where I belonged.  After a couple of years, I picked the \"main\" Minyan in the Shul's main sanctuary, and I picked one spot there to Daven.  It's a large Shul with several Minyanim, so I was a little surprised, though not entirely shocked, when a friend told me after a few weeks sitting there that I'd displaced an entire family that had been sitting there for three generations.  I guess they were just being nice and didn't want to make me feel awkward, but by my sitting in that one spot, this rather large family that typically took up an entire row so that they could sit together, from grandfather through grandson, moved and scattered throughout that section of the Shul.  I immediately moved over one row, and I soon noticed that they returned.  I was pretty embarrassed, but glad that I was able to rectify the situation.</p>\n\n<p>I then sat in this new seat for about six  years without incident.  I grew attached to this seat, and I even managed to get it assigned as my High Holy Days seat (usually, seats are reassigned from year to year or chosen through lottery if the seat isn't held by someone the previous year).  I was very proud that I had what I could definitively say was my Makom Kavua'.</p>\n\n<p>One day, though, I arrived late, and I discovered someone in my seat.  I recognized him as a regular in a different Minyan that I'd previously tried out.  I didn't say anything, since I'd been late, and since he probably just didn't know it was my seat, and I just moved over one row.  The next week the same thing happened.  And the next.  And the next.  I finally got up the courage to ask him if, like the family I'd inadvertently displaced for a month or so, perhaps I'd been displacing him all this time.  He gave me a vague answer suggesting that he preferred that seat when he comes, but he didn't really state outright that it was his, nor for how long he'd had that seat in mind. I had so many questions that I just couldn't get him to answer directly.  Did it predate my arrival? How often did he Daven there anyway?  He just wouldn't give me a straight answer.</p>\n\n<p>I made a point of trying to get there on time.  I noticed that he started arriving early.  Eventually he stopped coming (for the most part) and went back to his other Minyan.  But every once in a while, he shows up early and takes my seat!</p>\n\n<p>I once asked the rabbi what to do, and he did not support any action that might cause a conflict and advised me to just be on time or let him have it.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, a couple of years ago, someone else showed up in my seat.  I recognized him as well, only he didn't even go to my Shul.  He was a longtime member of a different Shul, and was even a past president there.  I didn't want to say anything, but then he showed up again the next week.  I thought, \"Here we go again!\"  I asked him if he had a particular attachment to this seat that I'd been sitting in for going on 8 years.  He said it had been his seat for well over a decade, once upon a time.  I said that I know he goes to a different Shul, and that I'd appreciate it if he'd let me have it, since I'd been sitting there for so long.  He emphasized that he is a member of both Shuls, and that he still considered it to be his seat.<br>\n<strong>/tl;dr</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So now I have two people vying for the same seat I've sat in for about a decade.  I can't seem to shake either one of them other than by coming extra early and never leaving for a bathroom break.  They just seem to go out of their way to snag this seat whenever they are in that Minyan (and they come more frequently than they used to).  I wonder: <strong>Is there anything in Halachah or common practice that I can bring to their attention (or the rabbi's), or am I just being too attached to my seat?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is actually extensive discussion in the Rishonim about the rights to a seat, and the point at which one has acquired a seat through adverse possession (chazaka).  The basics of the discussion can be found in Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=cm_x10303\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hoshen Mishpat 140:8</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, that discussion doesn't really apply in most shuls nowadays, as that was really referring to when a person bought his or her place in shul and had the rights to that specific seat through paying for it.  In most shuls today, the understood system is that members have the right to <em>a</em> seat, but not necessarily to a specific seat.  Of course, the administration of the shul owns the seats and has the right to apportion them as they see fit, but the congregants do not own their seats.  This is especially true in shuls where they have bench-style seating and there aren't even clearly defined spaces.</p>\n\n<p>So all you have to work with is the possible rights granted by the <em>halacha</em> which requires (or recommends) one to have a set place for his prayer.</p>\n\n<p>This <em>halacha</em> won't get you very far in terms of a specific chair, as the <em>Mogen Avrohom</em>  in O.C. 90:34 writes that you have 4 amos around the spot, so you cannot insist that you need that spot in order to fulfill your <em>makom kavuah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I heard from R' Gershon Bess that you shouldn't ask someone to move out of your seat unless you have prepared a new seat for him already.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think you're being too attached to your seat.

(Vayifga Bamakom, by Rabbi Mordechai Potash)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the same principle could apply to them.</p>\n\n<p>But one of you is going to have to budge. (pun intended)</p>\n\n\n",

I was astounded, as I never had this proposal before. I refused but gave her a few dollars.</p>\n\n<p>2 concerns at the time:</p>\n\n<p>1 - I was also very concerned about the security risk of her taking my account info or not even returning my card, itself. I'd like to be able to help a hungry person, but, do I need to implicitly trust in G-d and her that she won't abuse my credit card?</p>\n\n<p>2A - She would probably spend far more than I can afford. Wouldn't it be more embarrassing to her if I held onto my card and then when she checked out I say, \"Well, I can only pay this much?\"</p>\n\n<p>2B - I could tell the beggar in advance how much I can afford, and rely on her to buy only that amount. What if she says that would still leave her hungry?</p>\n\n<p>2C - What if I don't have the time to wait for the beggar to shop for her items, and I don't have the time to buy them?</p>\n\n<p>Is there any requirement under such circumstances to offer a credit card?</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, when I initially offered the cash, the woman refused and <strong>insisted</strong> on using my card. Only after I told her that there was no way I would do that, and she should take my money, did she accept the money!</p>\n\n\n",

He maintained and brought extensive documentation to prove that stainless steel can’t absorb anything and therefore should not need kosherization.

There was about a quarter of an inch of scum on the top of the pot. The engineer was passing by and I called him over to look at it. I said, “This was a completely clean pot.” I turned to the workers and asked, “Right?” The workers nodded their heads vigorously up and down. The engineer looked at it and said, “ I can’t argue with empirical evidence,” and walked away.</p>\n\n<p>Six months later I got a call from the engineer. He said, “Rabbi Cohn, I now understand.” “Great,” I thought, and asked, “You now understand what?” He answered, “I understand why a stainless steel vessel will absorb.” I asked, “Why?” He answered, “You have to understand, when it leaves the factory it can’t absorb anything, however, when it is heated it expands and contracts and it will produce micro fissures.

Rabbi Yehudah said When are dice-players\n  ineligible to adjudicate or testify? When they have no trade but this,\n  but if they have a trade besides this they are eligible.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rashi explains Rabbi Yehudah's view as people whose sole occupation is\n  gambling are not involved in doing anything useful. As a result, they\n  are unacquainted with basic business law and commerce, and have no\n  aversion to illegal activity. However, one who engages in some other\n  form of occupation is not flawed in this way and remains eligible.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The Gemara bring down a debate about why a dice-player's activity\n  disqualifies him:</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Rami Bar Hama says that the dice player is disqualified because the\n  wager agreement he is entering into is an example of asmachta4,\n  because each player consents to the terms of the game only because he\n  expects to win. Since the loser does not willingly surrender the\n  wagered amount, the winner is considered to be stealing when he\n  collects, and is thus ineligible as a witness or judge.5</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Sheshet says this agreement is not considered an asmachta.\n  According to this opinion the only situations that involve asmachta\n  are when the individual relies on his own ability. Dice players\n  realize that the outcome of the game is determined by chance and not\n  their own personal skill6. Rather, dice players are disqualified\n  because they are not involved with furthering the general welfare of\n  society.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The Talmud explains that the difference between these two opinions is\n  the case where the gambler learned another profession.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Rami bar Hama would still disqualify the gambler by virtue of his\n  accepting winnings based on a non-binding asmachta agreement, whereas\n  according to Rav Sheshet he is eligible because his second occupation\n  is socially useful.7</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Rami bar Hama the prohibition involved in gambling is not\n  the gambling itself but taking the winnings which involves the 'dust\n  of robbery'.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Rav Sheshet there is no prohibition in taking the\n  winnings, the problem is being a gambler. This occupation is\n  distasteful as is non productive.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The Rambam8 (Hilchot Gezela Chap. 6 Halacha 10) codifies that gambling\n  between two parties is Rabbinically prohibited as it is classified as\n  robbery by the Rabbis.</strong> Even though the winner took the proceeds with\n  the full knowledge and consent of the loser, since he took his money\n  for nothing, by playing, it is considered robbery. Similarly, wagering\n  on animals and birds is prohibited rabbinically.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>However the Rambam in Hilchot Edut9 says that a person who plays dice\n  is disqualified from giving testimony only if he is a professional\n  gambler and has no other occupation, since he is not engaged in\n  settling the world.</strong> He must be living of the proceeds of his gambling\n  which is the 'dust of robbery'10. Similarly a person who wagers on\n  animal and bird races is disqualified if he has no other occupation\n  except this.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The Shulhan Arukh follows the opinion of Rambam by classifying\n  gambling as asmachta which would mean that the winner is not entitled\n  to the proceeds of his victory and retaining would be considered\n  stealing.**22 **However, like Rambam, he also only disqualifies the\n  gambler as a witness if gambling is his only means of livelyhood</strong>,23\n  thereby creating the same compromise between Rab Sheshat and Rami Bar\n  Hama as did Rambam. <strong>The Remah however disagrees with the Shulhan Arukh\n  and decides the law according to the Tosaphot and Mordecha, The Tosaphot and the Mordechai16 explain that even according to the above mentioned opinion which permits \"Dice Playing\" as long as one has another profession, it is only permitted to do so if the actual cash is placed on the table and the money is transferred to the winner immediately follwing his victory</strong>i.24</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a further issue of wasting time:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Minhat Yitzhak49 discusses the general implications of playing\n  games in general. He quotes the classic ethical work Reishit Hochma50:\n  \"Included in a session of scoffers51 are those that play dice and\n  other games, even though they do not play for money, which is\n  prohibited because of robbery, it is considered a session of scoffers</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Cards are not specifically mentioned in Gemara as far as I'm aware but there is a mention of players of dice games, in Sh'vuot, where it says that such people are not acceptable as witnesses (to claim money owed to them or admit to a partial debt in court when the disagree on the full amount).</p>\n\n<p>And it means they play dice for money (e.g. craps or whatever they played back then) not backgammon or monopoly or whatever for leisure.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure exactly how it would to poker, which has a skill element to it such that a good player will win in the long run. (They won't win more games but they'll win more money because they'll fold earlier on losing hands more often).</p>\n\n<p>In particular, if you enter a tournament where you pay an entry fee, and the winner gets prize money, that is probably not considered gambling.</p>\n\n<p>However given that the Gemara (Rosh Hashanah, on giving testimony for the moon) mentions \"professional\" gamblers as detrimental to society, I will assume they did play games with a skill element such that the \"professional\" would win more than they lose, otherwise they could not make a living out of it. And also suggests that only such people are not allowed to give testimony.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As has been <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/1350/21\">discussed previously</a>:</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Sanhedrin asks why \"dice gamblers\" are invalidated from being witnesses. One explanation is that when people gamble they're not entirely cognizant of the likelihood they'll walk away with a loss, so it's ill-gotten gains. The other explanation is that it applies only to those who are professional gamblers, \"as they aren't among those who help civilize the world.\"</p>\n\n<p>There's a lot of halachic discussion about the parameters of the first reason -- what sort of commitment was made to pay up -- verbal, or something more formal? Maybe people are more aware of the risks if it's entirely a matter of luck (e.g. fair dice) rather than skill, where we are so incredibly good at deluding ourselves that we're \"better than average.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna in Shabbos also discusses some sort of lottery; Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef's opinion is that it's outright prohibited not just on Shabbos (because it looks like financial matters), but on weekdays as well.</p>\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan concludes that while many cases of gambling are technically allowed, as a seasoned rabbi he's seen it destroy a lot of lives.</p>\n\n<p>The Chochmas Adam specifically discusses someone who has a gambling problem and has taken an oath not to play cards. If the oath was because he's been losing money, then he's still allowed to play without money. If the oath was because he's losing all his time and getting into fights, then he can't even play without money.</p>\n\n<p>Chavos Yair 126 mentions that in his town, the rabbis enacted a policy to ban playing cards [I assume for money], except on Chanukah. This disturbed his father as that's how we celebrate a Jewish holiday?! Yet I've seen Hassidic Jews today who still do so -- only on Chanukah.</p>\n\n<p>In short -- it may very well be prohibited in the Sephardic world. In the Ashkenazic world, it's been around a long time and recognized as a very dangerous vice.</p>\n\n\n",

As the halacha of washing hands after touching a \"makom mechuse\" was said in a time period where people took showers very infrequently.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch 92:7 writes, “A dirty area is [defined as] the [normally] covered parts of a person’s body, because they contain beads of sweat. For instance, scratching one’s head [is considered touching a dirty place].” This refers to rubbing the roots of one’s hair, but if someone only touches the top of his head, he does not need to wash his hands (Shulchan Aruch HaRav; Mishnah Berurah 162:58, 164:10). </p>\n\n<p>Kaf HaChaim 4, small paragraphs 75 and 98, is lenient even if one scratches the roots of his hairs which are not covered with a hat, because there is no sweat there. </p>\n\n<p>Tzitz Eliezer, part 7, 2:14 concludes that if he washed his head and his hair is clean, even a person who scratches the roots of his hairs does not need to wash his hands.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/03-05-02/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For an interesting explanation why people in Mediaeval ages didnt bath see <a href=\"http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/05/why-bathing-was-uncommon-in-medieval-europe/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This latter “disease” point was very common; it was believed in many\n  parts of Europe that water could carry disease into the body through\n  the pores in the skin. According to one medical treaty of the 16th\n  century, “Water baths warm the body, but weaken the organism and widen\n  pores.  That’s why they can be dangerous and cause different diseases,\n  even death.”  It wasn’t just diseases from the water itself they were\n  worried about.  They also felt that with the pores widened after a\n  bath, this resulted in infections of the air having easier access to\n  the body. Hence, bathing became connected with spread of diseases, not\n  just immorality.</p>\n  \n  <p>For most lower class citizens, particularly men, this resulted in them\n  completely forgoing bathing.  During this time, people tended to\n  restrict their hygienic arrangements to just washing hands, parts of\n  the face, and rinsing their mouths. Washing one’s entire face was\n  thought to be dangerous as it was believed to cause catarrh and weaken\n  the eyesight, so even this was infrequent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

See also the Maharal in Be'er Hagolah (Be'er 6; p.134 in the old set, p. 317 in Hartman):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכמה גלים וגלי גלים היו נעשים בעצמות האיש הזה על כל דבר ודבר שאינו מאמין, כאשר יראה האדם בדבריו שכל דבר אשר הוא קצת זר בעיניו הוא אומר שהוא המצאה וכיוצא בו.</p>\n<p>And how many mounds and mounds of mounds were made with the bones of this man (Azariah de Rossi?) on each and every thing in which he does not believe, as one sees from his words that everything which is a bit strange in his eyes he says it is a fabrication or similar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My assumption is that if indeed we interpret the phrase to mean that he caused his actual death by \"setting his eyes upon him\", it would be related to the capital criminality associated with being a heretic (see, e.g., <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=81&perek=3&halocha=1&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchoth Mamrim 3:1</a>).</p>\n<p>** (It is self-understood that this attempted literal translation is less than insufficient to understand the Maharal's philosophical terminology, which requires some grounding in the philosophical conceptions of forces, actors, and void.)</p>\n\n\n",

Sichon made the first strike, and Klal Yosrael needed to defend itself. \"Vayilacheim b'Yisrael.\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>On a deeper level, the Targum Yonasan seems to have been bothered by this same difficulty. On the passuk by Edom, he translates it pashut p'shat: we'll pay for water. By Moav, though, he explains that it's a reference to immorality; \"we will not turn off into the fields or vineyards\" is a reference to oneis u'mefateh, and \"we will not drink water from your wells\" is a reference to eishes ish. \"We will go on the King's highway\" thus means that we will follow the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>Why is it specifically by Moav that he veers from the pashut p'shat?

Surely all Jews have their beliefs about which practices are “right” and which are “wrong”, but these differences are still a celebrated part of our greater tradition, and it’s not as though the rabbis with minority or overruled practices are <em>rejected</em> from the religion. So since the rabbis are all <em>still rabbis</em>, how could any of their particular practices be “wrong” in the eyes of Hashem?</p>\n\n<p>I think this is a separate question from the halakhic questions of what contemporary Jews should or shouldn’t do — we’d tell them to consult <em>their</em> rabbis with those questions. But theologically speaking, how should we understand the holiness of the practices of the rabbis whose practices differed?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit to explain difference from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9093\">this question</a>:</strong> The question \"how can eilu v'eilu be consistent with absolute truth?\" seems more philosophical and less personal than what I'm asking, and thus I wasn't quite satisfied by the answers posted there. What I'm getting at is, how can we relate to all the diverse teachers and examples in our tradition without being <em>worried</em> or <em>upset</em> about them, given their different ways of practicing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>First off, this is a perfectly valid and very important question, and it deserves a thorough, well thought out answer. While I'm not sure I can provide that, I'll try to give at least a small answer to try to explain this phenomenon.</p>\n\n<p>There is a concept in the tradition known as \"Shivim Panim Latorah\" which loosely translates to 'there are 70 interpretations for the Torah'*. This means that, within the confines of a legitimate interpretation of the Torah, there are many different ways to interpret a commandment or custom. Assuming the law/practice in question was reached through a legitimate method of understanding the Torah, it is a valid way of keeping the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>As per <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fjbq.jewishbible.org%2Fassets%2FUploads%2F411%2Fjbq411shivimpanim.pdf&ei=eaqMVZGlBsSjNsKYr7gF&usg=AFQjCNFN_4QTpcU7Juu2zNGdF0k1vYDXYA&sig2=zx_P0bhIi-E-DGHU3DWXQg\">this article</a>, the earliest source for the idea of Shivim Panim Latorah comes from Bamidbar Rabbah 13:15-16. The article also gives a nice explanation of the concept, well worth a quick read (it's only 4 pages, so not too heavy).</p>\n\n<p>A comparison that I've heard is with the American legal system. There are local, county, state, and federal laws that all could be valid and constitutional, yet are at times contradictory. I was speaking to an Orthodox lawyer once, who mentioned that all his classmates in law school had difficulty understanding how that worked too, but he easily understood it due to Judaism's acceptance of conflicting opinions. </p>\n\n<p>*This has been used by people who try to justify explanations of the Torah that are outside the realm of acceptable too. A clever response I've heard is \"There are Shivim Panim, but that explanation is Shivim V'Echad\". :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>תלמוד בבלי מסכת עירובין דף יג עמוד ב\nאמר רבי אבא אמר שמואל: שלש שנים נחלקו בית שמאי ובית הלל, הללו אומרים הלכה כמותנו והללו אומרים הלכה כמותנו. יצאה בת קול ואמרה: אלו ואלו דברי אלהים חיים הן, והלכה כבית הלל</p>\n\n<p>חידושי הריטב\"א מסכת עירובין דף יג עמוד ב\nאלו ואלו דברי אלהים חיים. שאלו רבני צרפת ז\"ל היאך אפשר שיהו שניהם דברי אלהים חיים וזה אוסר וזה מתיר, ותירצו כי כשעלה משה למרום לקבל תורה הראו לו על כל דבר ודבר מ\"ט פנים לאיסור ומ\"ט פנים להיתר, ושאל להקב\"ה על זה, ואמר שיהא זה מסור לחכמי ישראל שבכל דור ודור ויהיה הכרעה כמותם</p>\n\n<p>Fundamentally, when it comes to Halacha it has been given over to man to utilize his Halachickly trained mind to determine the law.  Therefore as long as each individual uses the proper Halachik method to yield a sevara and Psak Halacha (Legal Ruling) although it may not be the same as Moshe conceived or there is a dissenting position like in the argument of Hillel and Shamai they both none the less are considered valid Halachik positions.<br>\nHashem is not as much demanding us to come to the same conclusion, as much as we need to be involved in the proper Halachik process.  It is not about the result as much as the way of thinking if you will.  </p>\n\n<p>To put it in another perspective let me contrast it to another category of knowledge. When it comes to philosophy we don't say that all opinions are correct.  The Rambam and Ramban argue about what it will be like in the times of Moshiach.  One will be correct and one will be wrong.  Or the argument about whether the snake in Bereishit is an actual animal or a metaphor for the internal desires (Seforno).  Either the snake actually existed or not.  Both can't be correct.  Or if one person said God is physical and one said God is not.  They both can't simultaneously be correct.  </p>\n\n<p>The reason in all these cases is that we are saying something about reality.  We are trying to discover what really is.  Therefore, there can only be one truth.  However, when it comes to Halacha you are not studying the world around us, you are studying a Halachik reality.  A halachik construct if you will. It is a system unto itself. Therefore it can tolerate different logical possibilities within the framework of Halachik thinking. \nOur job is not to wear the Tephilin of Moshe, our job is to wear the Tephilin of the Halachik system.  </p>\n\n<p>I would encourage you to read Rav Moshe Feinstein's introduction to his Responsa.  It addresses these topics.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for the excellent question!</p>\n\n\n",

For example, if a person were to say to his friend \"this land belonged to your father, but I bought it from him\" the person would be believed.  Although he has no evidence that the land belongs to him now, since the son did not know that his father even had this piece of land, the person is believed because had he kept quiet the son wouldn't have even known about the land in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>Another example would be if a woman, who is not known to have been ever married, says that she was married (Therefore Prohibited to other men) but is now divorced (and therefore permitted to marry another). She is allowed to marry another man without proof of divorce.  The reason is the very statement that would have prohibited her also includes a statement that permits her. </p>\n\n<p>In other words my understanding is that we view the two statements as a unit.  If we are going to believe the first part of the statement then we should believe the second half.

It appears that in the days of Yehoshua they had read the\nTorah. It could also mean that they constructed the <em>sukkos</em>\nwholeheartedly with the intention of observing Hashem's commandment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is a very important question that touches the foundation of our entire mesorah, I have looked into this myself and here is my conclusion:</p>\n<p><strong>Understanding Ezra’s National Reawakening</strong></p>\n<p>One episode often misrepresented as a moment when the Torah needed to be “reintroduced” is the story of Ezra Hasofer (ספר נחמיה פרק ח׳). A closer reading of the pesukim in context shows that nothing could be further from the truth.</p>\n<p>Let’s go through a few points to explain why:</p>\n<p><strong>1. The context is clear that they already had and kept the Torah and sukkos</strong></p>\n<p>The very same text makes it clear that the Jewish people already possessed and followed the Torah well before Ezra’s arrival, and that they were already observing Sukkos prior to the episode in Nechemiah 8.</p>\n<p>a) Nearly twenty years earlier, the pesukim state clearly that they built the mizbeach in order to bring korbanos “as it is written in the Torah of Moshe, the man of Hashem”.(Ezra 3:2)</p>\n<p>b) The same passage states explicitly that they “observed the festival of Sukkos as written,” and that they kept the other Yamim Tovim as well.(Ezra 3:4-5)</p>\n<p>c) A few years later, when the Beis HaMikdash was rebuilt, the pesukim again emphasize their adherence to the Torah: they established the system of kohanim and levi’im “as written in the Torah of Moshe,” and they observed Pesach on its proper date.(Ezra 6:18-19)</p>\n<p>d) Ezra arrived in Eretz Yisrael only after all of these events had already taken place.(Ezra 7:1-8) This makes it unmistakably clear that the people possessed the Torah and were observing its mitzvos — including Sukkos — well before the episode under discussion. The passage in Nechemiah therefore requires a very different explanation.</p>\n<p>e) The text also makes clear that, while some Jews had assimilated and were ignorant of Torah, there were others who continued to observe it. When Ezra was sent to Eretz Yisrael by King Artaxerxes, his mission was to appoint judges to uphold both the law of the king and the law of your God. These judges were tasked with judging “all who know the laws of your God, and whoever does not know,” explicitly acknowledging that Torah knowledge already existed among the people, though some were more knowledgeable than others. (Ezra 7:25)</p>\n<p><strong>2. Historically, it is not plausible that Ezra “introduced” the Torah:</strong></p>\n<p> a) At the time of Ezra’s return, the Jewish people were already scattered across the Persian Empire: with the largest community in Bavel, a growing community in Eretz Yisroel, and others in Egypt and elsewhere. For Ezra to have “introduced” the Torah globally, he would have needed to distribute it to all these communities and convince them to accept it. If such a major, global transformation of the Jewish people had occurred, we would expect some record of it — yet none exists.  </p>\n<p>b) Even the Kusim (Samaritans) had a Sefer Torah (with only minor variations in a few places). Since the Samaritans and Jews were adversaries, it is unlikely that they would have accepted a Torah newly introduced by Ezra, the leader of the Jewish community.</p>\n<p><strong>3.Understanding the Text in Context</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Given all this, it is abundantly clear that Ezra was not introducing the Torah for the first time. A more reasonable way to read this passage is that “they found written” doesn’t mean they had never known it before. Rather, they discovered a deeper, more inspired understanding. The chapter itself makes this clear: they “read from the book of the Torah of Hashem, explaining clearly and giving understanding, and the people understood what was read,”(Nechemia 8:8) and they gathered “to understand the words of the Torah.”(Nechemia 8:13) It wasn’t about learning something new, but finally understanding what they already had on a deeper level.</li>\n<li>Also, when the text says that “they had not done so from the days of Yehoshua bin Nun until that day,” it is using a common style of expression in Tanach. This does not mean that the mitzvah had not been fulfilled at all, but that it had not been performed with such intensity and enthusiasm since the days of Yehoshua. We find the same type of language regarding the Pesach brought in the days of Yoshiyahu, where the text states: “And there had not been a Pesach like it in Israel since the days of Shmuel HaNavi…,” (Divrei HaYamim II 35:18) even though we know that Pesach had been observed earlier, as is clear from the account of Chizkiyahu’s Pesach just a few chapters earlier (Divrei HaYamim II 30).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taken together, the text, its context, and the historical setting leave no room for the idea that Ezra introduced the Torah. Rather, as with the episode in the days of Yoshiyahu, this was not a rediscovery of a lost Torah, but a powerful moment of national reawakening to a Torah that had never been lost.</p>\n\n\n",

There are, however, plenty of other civil calendars used around the world (e.g. the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_calendar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ethiopian calendar</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendars\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iranian calendar</a>). In addition, the Gregorian calendar has only been in use since the late 16th century (already into the period of the Acharonim!).  I see no reason why the Gregorian calendar should have any particular significance in Judaism. The fact that something happened on some date in some random calendar system is irrelevant. This applies to all calendars--not just the Gregorian calendar. I can't just make up a calendar that has a three-day year and say that I want a birthday party every three days!</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there is no reason why the Hebrew calendar cannot be used for \"secular\" purposes.  In fact, the State of Israel requires that the Hebrew date be included in all official government documents. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Talmud does recognize the concept of a 365-day solar year. The Gregorian calendar is the most accurate representation of the solar year around today. It is possible that there could be some mystical associations with particular solar dates although that is outside my realm of knowledge. Still, even if there is some significance to solar dates, that would still leave the Gregorian calendar as the sole exception to the rule that non-Jewish calendars are irrelevant.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are many astrological systems which ALL play important roles in the world - after all that is why they were created. Some have more of an effect on the lives of man than others, and even within the zodiacs that do, there are tiers of nations and within nations, people of who they are allowed to effect and to what extent. </p>\n\n<p>The Jewish calander is a lunar-solar calander, which mainly uses the monthly moon cycle, however due to a verse on the Torah commanding that Pesach always fall out in the spring, the solar calander with its set seasons plays a just as vital biblical role. As far as birthdays, everything age related follows after the \"Hebrew birthday\" fully and not the secular birthday for all halachik differences. However two notes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We use a lunar-solar calander so both are important </li>\n<li>Some Seasonal aspects of Jewish law will end up almost 100% \"depending\" on the secular seasonal calander - for example saying v'sain tal u'matar </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Also interesting to note that even before the news were commanded (first commandment ) to announce rosh chodesh each month,  the Torah does recognize Pharaoh's birthday (presumably his Egyptian birthday). Since seemingly only jews are commanded to keep the calander which we have (after all it is of no relevance to non jews who need not keep any holiday or rules based on months or years s other than a yearly accomplishment of still being alive, having a birthday is nothing more than having a celebration. The only question left to be asked is if it is an issue of u'vechokoseihem lo seileichu  </p>\n\n\n",

That is, the adjectives that modify it are plural adjectives, and the verbs of which it's the <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_%28grammar%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">subject</a> are plural verbs. For example, we have (Numbers 5:22) \"וּבָאוּ הַמַּיִם הַמְאָרְרִים הָאֵלֶּה\", \"this cursed water will come\", where the adjective \"this\" and the verb forms \"cursed\" and \"will come\" are all grammatically plural (which is why the verse is usually translated as something like \"these cursed waters will come\" even though that's <a href=\"https://blog.udemy.com/proofreaders-symbols/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">awkward</a> in English).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why does it say \"וְלֹא הָיָה מַיִם לָעֵדָה\", with a singular verb, in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.20.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Numbers 20:2</a>?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This means that the word \"water\" is a general term.

If I were to have one originally given to someone else would it be permissible to sell such a memento?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Rebbe gave the dollars to people to give to charity. People usually substituted it for another dollar, to keep the one from the Rebbe. Nevertheless, if one did give it to charity, of course that's alright. </p>\n\n<p>In this case, the dollar was given to you. If it was given to you to keep; then halachikly they'd be no problem, unless it was given to you on condition you don't sell it. It's no different halachikly then any random dollar.</p>\n\n<p>I, as a chossid, wouldn't sell it, being that it's from a Rebbe, so it's holy and special. Giving one to a child, or someone who needs a blessing... is a different story, but I wouldn't sell it.\nFrom your question, I assume you probably don't feel that way, though I recommend keeping it.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16076&pgnum=149\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ליקוטי שיחות חלק ט\"ז פרשת בא (ה)</a>, where it speaks about not selling something from a Rebbe to a gentile or making it hefker. Whether here, where the dollar was given to give to tzedaka, where the money can end up anywhere, is different, I can't really answer that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If the dollar is not officially yours, then no, you cannot. Selling it would be equivalent to selling someone else's property. Furthermore, it's money, so I don't know what that means halachically (if I sell a stolen dollar for $2, and normally the stolen property would have to be paid back in double...).</p>\n\n<p>That said, if it is your property, then yes you could sell it or do whatever you like with it. It is, after all, a dollar.</p>\n\n<p>What might be more valuable to you however is to give it away. The purpose of the Rebbe giving dollars out was as charity, and not to those who needed the money (mostly). Money was only the tool to share the blessing. Because that's all money is, a tool. So you could use it to, say, purchase pork to eat and boost negativity, or you could purchase a kosher meal and boost positivity.</p>\n\n<p>No matter what you do with it, the dollar remains a tool, and the blessing remains with it. My suggestion is that if you have no use for it yourself, that you give it to charity and allow that blessing to become stronger through your own gift. Or, if you have a desire to grow, spend the dollar towards that. That in turn will put the dollar into someone else's hands and grow as well, along with the rest of the money spent (what does a dollar buy these days?). There's no right or wrong answer with what you can do with the dollar; ultimately all money you spend will work the same way, as a tool. Only you decide whether that helps or hinders your spiritual growth.</p>\n\n\n",

There was no way of accurately pinpointing a verse except by indicating whether it was from Bereishis or Shemos, or perhaps mentioning that it was at the beginning or end of a weekly Sidra. To locate pesukim in olden times, you had to have a basic knowledge of the entire Tanach. Even though Hashem gave us the Torah divided into parshiyos (identifiable by gaps at the beginning or middle of lines) and pesukim, no one ever ascribed numbers to them, and the Sedarim later used in the three year Krias HaTorah cycle and the fifty-four weekly sidros used in our time were identified by name and never by number. Furthermore, no one ever created a chapter system based on the seven aliyos of the weekly parshiyos.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>A Church Invention</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Credit for dividing the Tanach into convenient chapter and verse generally goes to Cardinal Stephen Langton of France and England, who served as the Archbishop of Canterbury. He is thought to have created the chapters and verses in about 1205, which are used until this day. This was not too difficult a job since 617 out of his 779 chapters coincide with the parshiyos that existed since Sinai, while of the 162 chapters that he invented, many are illogical, while some border on the heretical.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And they are all together referred to as '<em>misswath lolav</em>' and we do not subtract from them and we do not add. And if one of them cannot be found, we do not bring another species in its place that is similar to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And in the seventh <em>halakhah</em> there, he writes as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>7</strong> <em>kammah nottel me-hen? lolav ehhadh wa-ethrogh ehhadh ushnei baddei `aravah usheloshah baddei hadhas. wa-im rassah le-hosif ba-hadhas kedhei sheyyihyeh agudah gadholah - mosif wa-noy misswah hu. aval she'ar ham-minin ein mosifin 'al minyanam wa-ein gor'in mehen wa-im mosif o gara' - <strong>pasal</em></strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Translation</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>7</strong> How many of each [of the four species] do we take [to perform the <em>misswah</em> of <em>nettilath lolav</em>]?

And if one desires to add to the number of myrtle branches so that there will be a large bundle then he may add and it serves as a decoration to the <em>misswah</em>. But with regard to the other species, we do not add to their number and we do not subtract from them, and if one either added or subtracted <strong>he invalidates their use to fulfill the <em>misswah</em></strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, essentially, if each particular species is <em>me-`akev</em> to the other, and if even adding or subtracting from the number of each kosher species causes the <em>agudah</em> to become <em>pasulah</em>, then <em>kol she-ken</em> that a fifth species added to the <em>agudah</em> would cause it to become <em>pasulah</em> and prevent from being <em>yossei yedhei hhovatho</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Le-`aniyuth da'ati</em>, according to the Rambam, to do so would prevent one from fulfilling the <em>misswah</em> of <em>lolav</em>.

This is based largely on a the testimony of Rabbenu Avraham ben HaRambam who says that his father later changed his mind based on a similar argument as brought by the <em>Ra'avadh</em> in his <em>hasaghoth</em> on the <em>Mishneh Torah</em>. Notably, HaRav Yosef Qafihh z\"l is of this opinion - which he explains in a comment (#20) which lasts for several pages - and rules that although the textual tradition for the \"<em>pasal</em>\" reading is strong and consistent, the text should nevertheless be changed to read \"<em>lo pasal</em>\" and the original reading should be viewed as stemming from a <em>mahadhurah qamma</em> written in the Rambam's youth.</p>\n\n<p>Although the <em>halakhah</em> is strictly speaking of adding or detracting from the number of each of the <em>arba`ah minim</em> and not explicitly regarding the addition of an entirely new species in addition to the four (although 7:5 does address the exchange of kosher species for a similar non-kosher one), I believe that this is due to the fact that while it was apparently a common error to equate species with one another, to add a fifth species may not have even been a <em>hawa mina</em> that was prevalent enough to merit discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.

Lulav is slightly more complicated.</p>\n\n<p>There is a girsa discrepancy in the Rambam chapter seven of Lulav halacha seven if the lulav becomes passul or not by adding to it in a way that is Bal Tosef. See Raavad and Magid Mishna there, there is a discussion whether this is intrinsic to the Lulav needing to be tied (צריך אגד) or not.</p>\n\n<p>The Encyclopedia Talmudis under Bal Tosef by note 76 brings opinions that a mitzvah which needs a certain amount of connected items to which an extra one is attached will in fact passul the items of proper mitzvah use. (I use this language to avoid the צריך אגד of Lulav).</p>\n\n<p>This is the opinion of Tshuvas HaRashba chelek 1 siman 468 & 535(mentioned earlier in note #47), Lechem Chamudos on the Rosh hilchos Teffilin #19. The note also mentions this is the opinion of Tosafos in Succah.</p>\n\n<p>This idea, that he would not be yotzah, is also implied in the Minchas Chinuch.</p>\n\n<p>See mitzvah 454 #6 he writes ומביא הרב המחבר, דמסיק רבא דלעבור על בל תוסיף בזמנו לא בעי כוונה, ושלא בזמנו בעי כוונה. והנה חמש טוטפות בתפילין אם כבר יצא ידי המצוה באותו היום הוי ליה כעבר זמנו ואינו עובר בלא כוונה וכו׳.</p>\n\n<p>He seemingly takes for granted that in order to consider this person who is wearing five parshios in his Teffilin as having already fulfilled his obligation, we must give a case where he already wore a proper pair. \n Now, if he believed the person is yotzeh while engaged in bal yosef, he could have said this person was wearing the five parsha version without intention for kiyum mitzvah, which according to Rava would still in fact be a kiyum mitzvah as mitzvos do not need to be fulfilled consciously, after which he consciously decided to be yotzeh the mitzvah of Teffilin etc. By choosing his case, it would appear he believes the person is never yotzeh in such a situation.</p>\n\n\n",

In later times, when the financial standing of the Jewish\n  community slipped, the rabbis resorted to the earlier decree to recite\n  havdalah during davening. In order to guarantee that the method with\n  which one is supposed to recite havdalah not change constantly with\n  the affluence of the community, the rabbis made a permanent decree to\n  recite havdalah during davening, and insisted that one who says\n  havdalah in davening still recite havdalah over a cup of wine.

Some Rishonim indicate that havdala constitutes\n  a rabbinic obligation, whereas others imply that it originates from\n  the Torah.  If, indeed, havdala is required according to Torah law,\n  the question arises as to the Biblical source of this obligation.  The\n  Rambam writes in Hilkhot Shabbat (29:1):</p>\n  \n  <p>\"There is a mitzvat asei from the Torah to declare the sanctity of the\n  Shabbat day, as it says, 'Remember the day of Shabbat, to make it\n  holy,' meaning, speak about it in terms of praise and sanctity.  One\n  must speak of it when it enters and when it departs: when it enters –\n  through the kiddush of the day; when it departs – through havdala.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>This passage implies that the havdala obligation stems from the mitzva\n  of \"zakhor\" (\"Remember the Shabbat day… \" – Shemot 20:8).  The Maggid\n  Mishneh notes that other Rishonim derive the havdala obligation from\n  the verse in Parashat Shemini, \"To distinguish between the sacred and\n  the mundane\" (Vayikra 10:10).</p>\n  \n  <p>This issue regarding the Biblical source of the mitzva may yield\n  several important ramifications.  For example, the Minchat Chinukh\n  (mitzva 31) raises the question of why we make no mention of the\n  Exodus in havdala as we do in kiddush.  If the obligation originates\n  from the verse in Parashat Shemini, the answer is easily resolved:\n  since the requirement of havdala stems from a different source from\n  kiddush, we should not expect its laws to parallel those of kiddush. \n  If, however, we view \"zakhor\" – the source of the obligation of\n  kiddush – as the source of havdala, as well, then these two should\n  indeed follow the same format.  The Minchat Chinukh leaves this\n  question unresolved.  Rav Tzvi Pesach Frank (Har Tzvi, O.C. 157)\n  suggests that we perhaps fulfill the obligation to mention the Exodus\n  through the recitation of arvit on Motza'ei Shabbat before havdala. \n  Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (cited in Shemirat Shabbat Ke-hilkhata,\n  chapter 58, note 18) claimed that even if we view havdala as part of\n  the mitzva of zakhor, this would not necessarily require mentioning\n  the Exodus in havdala.  It suffices to mention the Exodus while\n  reciting kiddush, and there is no need to mention it again in havdala.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Sages said, \"Everyone who derives [monetary] benefit from the words of the Torah removes his life from the world [to come].\" They further commanded and said, \"Don't make them [the words of the Torah] into a crown to make yourself great with them, nor a spade with which to till the ground.\" They further commanded and said, \"Love engaging in labor and hate the service of being a public <em>rav</em>. And all study of Torah that is not accompanied by engaging in labor, in the end it is worthless and the one who engages in such [exclusive Torah study] will in the end become one who steals from his fellow creatures.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, everyone needs financial help (i.e. <em>hesedh</em> and <em>ssedaqah</em>) at certain times throughout their life, and to varying degrees. However, the Rambam writes in the next <em>halakhah</em> (3:11) that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is a great virtue for one to be sustained through the work of his own hands, and to do so was a character trait of the ancient devoted ones (the \"<em>hasidhim rishonim</em>\", a group often mentioned in the <em>Mishnah</em> for their particular piety and devotion to God). And in doing so, one will merit all of the honor and goodness that is available in this world and in <em>`olam haba</em>. As it says, \"When you eat from the labor of your hands, you will be contented and it will be good for you\" (<em>Tehillim</em> 128:2) - \"contented\" in this world, \"good for you\" stored for <em>olam haba</em> which is entirely good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <em>Hilkhoth `Eduth</em> 10:4 where making a living from playing dice - or any other form of non-labor - is called \"<em>avaq gezel</em>\" (a phrase meaning, \"not technically theft, but it might as well be\"). In addition, it invalidates someone as being a reliable witness in a <em>beth din</em>.</p>\n\n<p>And see also <em>Hilkhoth `Aniyyim</em> 10:18 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A person should always push himself and exist in painful difficulty rather than cast himself on the mercy of the community. Thus the Sages commanded and said, \"Make tyour Shabbath like a weekday and do not demand your needs from your fellow creatures. Even if a poor person is a greatly honored <em>hakham</em>, he should sustain himself through a trade, even if it is a miserable one, and not demand his needs from his fellow creatures. It is better for a person to spread out the tanned skins of <em>neveloth</em> in the <em>shuq</em> rather than saying to the people, 'I am a <em>hakham</em>, I am a great person, I am a <em>kohen</em>, so support me.\" And in this matter the Sages commanded us to do thus. Even the greatest of the <em>hakhamim</em> were woodchoppers, carriers of building materials, water drawers for use in vegetable gardens, smelters of iron and producers of charcoal, and they did not ask for charity from the community, nor would they accept gifts from the community even while serving the community.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, there is no doubt that, YES, there is a halakhic imperative for a person to make a living to support himself. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p> (גדולה מלאכה שמכבדת את בעליה\" (נדרים מט, ע\"ב\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although that does not mean that we are required to work, it encourages one to live a life with dignity.</p>\n\n<p>But in אבות דרבי נתן  , chapter 11, we see that there may be a source in the torah itself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מלמד שיהא אדם אוהב את המלאכה ואל אדם יהי שונא את המלאכה. כשם שהתורה\n  נתנה בברית, כך המלאכה נתנה בברית, שנאמר: (שמות כ) \"ששת ימים תעבוד\n  ועשית כל מלאכתך, ויום השביעי שבת לה' אלהיך\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>see that whole chapter where you will find more related statments.</p>\n\n<p>Now, about taking money from learning torah  :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(ודאשתמש בתגא, חלף (פרקי אבות א יג</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some mefarshim say that it refers to the person that uses the Torah to get money or honor.\nBut the Avarbanel there says that nowadays (the middle ages) it became permisible, and builds an analysis to find under what conditions it must be made. In summary he says that the person should take money from a community fund, not from an individual donor; and that the quantity should be just the necessary to live properly. </p>\n\n\n",

What is the simple meaning of this pasuk? And why and how does the interpretation as the rebellious local judge work out with the words of the section?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>When interpreting a pasuk, it is critical to understand the context.</p>\n<p>One important piece of this context is that there were local courts established in the gates of each town. Thus, in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9980/jewish/Chapter-16.htm#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 16:12</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שֹׁפְטִים וְשֹׁטְרִים תִּתֶּן לְךָ בְּכָל שְׁעָרֶיךָ אֲשֶׁר ה אֱלֹהֶיךָ נֹתֵן לְךָ לִשְׁבָטֶיךָ וְשָׁפְטוּ אֶת הָעָם מִשְׁפַּט צֶדֶק:</p>\n<p>You shall set up judges and law enforcement officials for yourself in all your cities that the Lord, your God, is giving you, for your tribes, and they shall judge the people [with] righteous judgment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are local courts, because they are set up בְּכָל שְׁעָרֶיךָ, in all your gates [\"cities\"].</p>\n<p>With that as background, when we encounter <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9981/jewish/Chapter-17.htm#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 17:8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי יִפָּלֵא מִמְּךָ דָבָר לַמִּשְׁפָּט בֵּין דָּם | לְדָם בֵּין דִּין לְדִין וּבֵין נֶגַע לָנֶגַע דִּבְרֵי רִיבֹת בִּשְׁעָרֶיךָ וְקַמְתָּ וְעָלִיתָ אֶל הַמָּקוֹם אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ בּוֹ:</p>\n<p>If a matter eludes you in judgment, between blood and blood, between judgment and judgment, or between lesion and lesion, words of dispute in your cities, then you shall rise and go up to the place the Lord, your God, chooses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>we understand that the pasuk is not directed towards the litigants, but towards the local judges. That is, there are דִּבְרֵי רִיבֹת בִּשְׁעָרֶיךָ, words of dispute in your gates [\"cities\"], such that the local judges cannot come to a conclusion. Thus, כִּי יִפָּלֵא מִמְּךָ דָבָר, \"a matter eludes you\" [the judges] in judgement.</p>\n<p>In such a situation, the case goes to the Supreme Court, which is a Sanhedrin, or a kohen Gadol, or whatever the Supreme Court is in those days.</p>\n<p>This parallels the court system set up by Moshe in parashat Yitro (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9879#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 18</a>), in which there were lesser judges who judged the easy minor cases, while the difficult cases would be taken to Moshe.</p>\n<p>When interpreting the subsequent pesukim, Chazal kept the same actor throughout. Since the ones who were unable to ascertain the laws were the judges, it is the <strong>judges</strong> rather than the litigants who go to inquire in pasuk 9:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּבָאתָ אֶל הַכֹּהֲנִים הַלְוִיִּם וְאֶל הַשֹּׁפֵט אֲשֶׁר יִהְיֶה בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם וְדָרַשְׁתָּ וְהִגִּידוּ לְךָ אֵת דְּבַר הַמִּשְׁפָּט:</p>\n<p>And you shall come to the Levitic kohanim and to the judge who will be in those days, and you shall inquire, and they will tell you the words of judgment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And once the judges are informed what the words of judgement should be, that is what they should render as their own words of judgement.</p>\n<p>Now, in pasuk 10 and 11, reference is made to action (וְעָשִׂיתָ). This means how you [the judge] should render judgement in terms of what the practical action should be, rather than meaning how the litigant should act.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעָשִׂיתָ עַל פִּי הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר יַגִּידוּ לְךָ מִן הַמָּקוֹם הַהוּא אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר יְהֹוָה וְשָׁמַרְתָּ לַעֲשׂוֹת כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר יוֹרוּךָ:</p>\n<p>And you shall do according to the word they tell you, from the place the Lord will choose, and you shall observe to do according to all they instruct you.</p>\n<p>עַל פִּי הַתּוֹרָה אֲשֶׁר יוֹרוּךָ וְעַל הַמִּשְׁפָּט אֲשֶׁר יֹאמְרוּ לְךָ תַּעֲשֶׂה לֹא תָסוּר מִן הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר יַגִּידוּ לְךָ יָמִין וּשְׂמֹאל:</p>\n<p>According to the law they instruct you and according to the judgment they say to you, you shall do; you shall not divert from the word they tell you, either right or left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The importance of this is in establishing a consistent rule of law from a central authority. Even if you, the judge, disagrees, you may not divert.</p>\n<p>Finally, what if one refuses to listen? Again, this is taken to refer to the local judge. If, despite the ruling of the Sanhedrin, he persists in his insistence that he is right, and continues to rule practically (אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה) contrary to the Sanhedrin, then he is executed, as a way of preserving the rule of law. Thus, pasuk 12:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה בְזָדוֹן לְבִלְתִּי שְׁמֹעַ אֶל הַכֹּהֵן הָעֹמֵד לְשָׁרֶת שָׁם אֶת ה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אוֹ אֶל הַשֹּׁפֵט וּמֵת הָאִישׁ הַהוּא וּבִעַרְתָּ הָרָע מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל:</p>\n<p>And the man who acts intentionally, not obeying the kohen who stands there to serve the Lord, your God, or to the judge that man shall die, and you shall abolish evil from Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So you don't need to take my word for this, see for instance this entry in the Jewish Encyclopedia about the <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5518-elder-rebellious\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rebellious elder</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An elder who defies the authoritative rabbinic interpretation of the Mosaic Law. In the period when the Sanhedrin flourished this was a capital offense, punishable by strangulation (Sanh. xi. 1). This is based on Deut. xvii. 8-13, and according to the Talmud refers not to an ordinary man who refuses to abide by the decision of the priest or the judge, but to a regular ordained rabbi, or a judge, or an elder over the age of forty, or one of the twenty-three jurists constituting the minor Sanhedrin of a city or town. If such a judge dared to defy the decision of a majority of the major Sanhedrin, he became liable to the penalty of strangulation. R. Meïr, however, would convict only an elder whose opposition concerned a criminal act which, if committed unintentionally, would entail a sin-offering, or, committed intentionally, would be punished with excision (=כרת). According to R. Judah, the elder could be convicted only of a schismatic decision concerning a law which had its origin in Scripture, but the interpretation of which was left to the Soferim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

His example is related to Shabbos observance, where in one context it mentions Ger next to servants, who have to keep Shabbos, so that is a Ger Tzedek, whereas if it mentions Ger next to animals, that is a Ger Toshav who is allowed to do whatever he wants for himself on Shabbos, as one's animal is allowed to graze grass for itself on Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>2-3 years is actually quite a short time to expect to have heard of all Halachos. You probably haven't heard a Shiur in Halacha of living a Jew either. not have you heard a Halachic Shiur on jealousy, being haughty, or anger.</p>\n\n<p>These aren't in the Shulchan Aruch, although it was filled in by the Magen Avraham and Mishna Berura. They don't have set ins and outs. Therefore, although it is a Mitzva d'Oraysa it is treated as good Midos.</p>\n\n<p>We find that the Gemara in Keddushin applies loving your neighbor as a reason to love your wife, and her looks. That obviously doesn't apply to your bench-mate in shul. We see that there is a context to this that is not applied with rules, but rather with a sensitivity that you are brought up with or learnt by example.</p>\n\n<p>There are actually Halachos set in place to separate us from others, such as Yayin Nesech and Eiruvin. These have guidelines and are therefore discussed. </p>\n\n<p>Other Halachos surely don't add to the understanding that ואהבת לרעך כמוך was meant for non-Jews. For dealing with them we have the general ideals of being upright, well-mannered people, just like we expect them to be although they don't have this Mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>So, you are looking in the wrong place.

Though I think you mean verse 26.</p>\n<p>Talmud Pesachim, 25b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דתניא ר' אומר (דברים כב) כי כאשר יקום איש על רעהו ורצחו נפש כן הדבר הזה וכי מה ענין רוצח אצל נערה המאורסה הרי זה בא ללמד ונמצא למד מקיש רוצח לנערה המאורסה מה נערה המאורסה ניתן להצילה בנפשו אף רוצח ניתן להצילו בנפשו ונערה המאורסה מרוצח מה רוצח יהרג ואל יעבור אף נערה המאורסה תהרג ואל תעבור</p>\n<p>(Deut 22:26) \"Just as if one man jumped up and murdered his fellow, this [rape] is the same way.\" Why is the verse comparing murder to the violation of a betrothed maiden ... deadly force can be used to stop either, and one is obligated to be killed rather than transgress either.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note, however, that Deuteronomy there was speaking specifically about rape of a <em>betrothed</em> (i.e. married) woman. The concept of \"be killed rather than transgress\" is limited to certain categories of prohibited relations. In this case, it's actually the adultery that generates the \"be killed rather than transgress\" clause, rather than the assault.</p>\n<p>It's less clear, then, whether assaulting a single woman would be in the same category. (Mind you, trying to assault anyone could very likely wind up with the death of the assailant, victim, or both, which would invoke the rule of \"be killed rather than murder.\")</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In Yoreh Deah siman 157 the laws of which sins a person must give up his life so as not to transgress are discussed. </p>\n\n<p>In siff one, in the last gloss of the Ramma he points out \"and any issur of idolatry, or Giluy Arayos (sexual misconduct), and murder, even though the sin itself does not incur the death penalty but is only a 'lav', one must give up his life in order not to transgress it\".</p>\n\n<p>The Shach #10 brings a gemara from Sanhedrin 75a concerning a man who became obsessed with a certain woman, and the doctors said he would die unless he had relations with her. The Chachamim ruled he should die. How about for her to stand naked in front of him? Die. Talk to her from behind a fence? Die. </p>\n\n<p>The Shach quotes the Ran and other sources who point out that these sins would not be real Giluy Arayos, but are included in לא תקרבו לגלות ערוה, which is lav of Giluy Arayos.</p>\n\n<p>He goes on the use this gemara to rule with the Rambam who said kissing and hugging is included in the lav of lo sikrivu, and against the Ramban who said they are not.</p>\n\n<p>The Beis Yosef on that siman brings the Rambam in chapter five of Yisodei Hatorah halacha nine, who rules with the opinion in that gemara that we are dealing with a single girl, not an eishes ish. The Beis Yosef gives a reason and a proof from the gemara to the Rambam's ruling.</p>\n\n<p>So all in all, rape, even of an unmarried girl is a sin that one must give up his life so as not to commit.</p>\n\n<p>If the victim is one of the real Arayos of the Torah, such as a nida, a married lady, a forbidden relative, a male, or animal, than this would be even more universally accepted, but again, we don't rule with the opinions who made that distinction anyway.</p>\n\n\n",

(For if they were performed on Shabbat we would be dealing with larger problems).</p>\n\n<p>If so, this ought to constitute a double rabbinic prohibition: an initial prohibition of utilizing a gentile's services to perform labor on Shabbat, and a further rabbinic decree prohibiting activities that might be construed as such.  The rabbis generally do not enact such legislation (Cf. Betzah 3a).</p>\n\n<p>I am familiar with textbook solutions to problems of \"double enactments\" but am looking for solutions raised by the commentators to this particular question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I understand that BS says that is an Issur Mar'it Ha'ayn of an Issur derabanan, that the Nochri is a Shaliach of the Israel.

    "content": "# Relationship between \"Tafasta mi'uta tafasta\" and Occam's Razor\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud often invokes the principle of תפסת מרובה לא תפסת תפסת מועט תפסת. (E.g. Yoma 80a) This would seem to be a presentation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Occam's razor</a>. I am looking for confirmation (or rejection) of the idea that the two are identical.</p>\n<p>A subset of this question is the source for the aforementioned Talmudic dictum. If it is scripturaly sourced, then presumably it is not the simple logical principle of Occam. For logic is generally prefered to scriptural source. (למה לי קרא סברא היא).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The principles of Occam's razor and תפסת מרובה לא תפסת are not equivalent. Occam's razor is a logical principle stating that when comparing equivalently predictive hypotheses, the one that requires the fewest assumptions is most likely to be correct.</p>\n\n<p>The principle of \"תפסת\" on the other hand, is not a logical principle in the same way. Instead, it is more like the principle <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_minimalism\">judicial minimalism</a>. The purpose of judicial minimalism is to limit the scope of rulings to particular cases in order to avoid having to make assumptions about more general laws. For example, the US Supreme Court often tries to resolve cases on narrow grounds specific to the case at hand when possible rather than making a ruling on Constitutional grounds that sets a precedent for future cases. In our case, if our understanding of a law can come from two different sources, we should understand it to come from whichever source is narrower (i.e. leads to us making the fewest assumptions). This way, in the case that we were wrong about from where the law should be learned, we avoid doing the wrong thing. The analogy is not perfect since in the Talmud we are not discussing judicial rulings, but it is sufficient to explain the difference from Occam's razor.</p>\n\n<p>In your example from Yoma, the discussion is the size of an egg. It is suggested that maybe the egg-size is based on the size of an egg from the extremely large  bar-yochani bird. The problem is that if we are incorrect about that and really egg-size is based on the egg of a smaller bird, we are at risk of doing something wrong with food between the size of the two eggs.  Instead, we rule that egg-size comes from the smallest kind of egg because if we are wrong, it can only make things less likely that we will make a mistake.</p>\n\n<p>So in summary, Occam's razor states that the hypothesis that requires the fewest assumptions is most likely correct, whereas תפסת מרובה לא תפסת means that we try to limit our halachic rulings in order to avoid making assumptions and consequently possibly doing the wrong thing. It does not attempt to figure out \"which hypothesis is correct\" but rather \"which hypothesis is safer.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# ה׳ מלך for Rosh Hashanah Day Two\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During the repetition of the Amidah for both days of Rosh Hashanah, most Ashkenazi communities recite piyutim entitled  ה׳ מלך. On the first day, the format is relatively simple, being arranged in a regular alphabetical acrostic (with three verses for ת, due to the threefold nature of the refrain). However, on the second day, a more complex acrostic structure exists, although I am not quite sure how to view it. Furthermore, the third line of each stanza begins with the words \"אילו ואילו,\" \"These and Those.\" </p>\n\n<p>My question here is twofold:</p>\n\n<p>What is the purpose for the more complex (and frankly baffling) acrostic structure?</p>\n\n<p>What is the rationale for using אילו ואילו? Is it supposed to be a reference to the Talmudic principle?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The acrostic structure for the second day version of Hashem Melech is the name of the author: Shimon Bar Yitzchak. The last stanza starts with the traditional Chazak ( <strong><em>Cha</em></strong>-shmalei <strong><em>Zik</em></strong>-im).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the \"Eilu v'Eilu\" refrain, it could very well be a reference to the Talmudic principle, but it as the two sets aren't contradicting each other (as they do in the Talmud) it doesn't exactly fit. I'll keep looking for a more relevant reference.</p>\n\n<p>Found something!\nYechezkel 40:37-  ואילו, לחצר החיצונה, ותמרים אל-אילו, מפו ומפו</p>\n\n<p>Here Yechezkel is describing the structure of the future Beis Hamikdash, where the flanking Tamarim are described through אילו ואילו. Though the vowelization is off (eilav), it specifically connotes twinned parties operating in tandem, connected with explicitly holy imagery. This may be a better fit for the contextual meaning of the piyut.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the difference between HaSatan, Luficer and the Serpent\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am working on a paper for one my classes and I routinely run into the question of whether or not jewish individuals believe in view Satan in the same way Christians do.  More specifically, are the Serpent, Lucifer, and Ha-Satan the same Satan as seen in Christianity.  Several questions have addressed these individually but I have yet to find a comprehensive answer on this.  </p>\n\n<p>Also, if anyone could indicate a book going over this issue in greater depth, please let me know the title and author of the book.  </p>\n\n<p>Many of the comments in this forum have asked for clarification regarding terms so I will elaborate on the terms I am using to make sure we are using the same vocabulary.  </p>\n\n<p>I have been told that jewish and christian individuals have fundamentally different conceptions of Satan.  These views change depending upon whom one is talking to.  Some college professors, religious and non-religious have different views.  Some rabbis differ with other rabbis.  I am looking for the answer that 51% of Jewish individuals will agree with.  </p>\n\n<p>When describing Lucifer, \nLucifer was referenced in the Nevi'im specifically in the Prophet Isaiah.  Depending upon which jewish person one talks to this could refer to one of three different being: Satan (as the christains understand him), the king of Babylon, or HaSatan.  Some individuals say this refers to the King of Babylon only.  The word Lucifer appeared as a mistranslation and/or a christian reinterpretation of the text.  These views are not mutually exclusive.  Some individuals say that this text explicitly refers to the King of Babylon but is also a metaphor for Lucifer.  </p>\n\n<p>Which is the correct interpretation?  Who is Lucifer?</p>\n\n<p>In regards to the serpet, the serpet was referenced in the Torah, specifically in Genesis.  Depending upon which jewish person you talk to this could refer to: a talking snake, HaSatan, or Satan (as Christians understand him).  I had a professor who studied in Israel.  This professor insisted that the serpent was a talking snake and nothing more.  The serpent was no HaSatan, and the serpent was not Satan.  There are others who argue that the serpent is HaSatan.  In this context, the serpent is an accuser.  This may or may not be the same accuser spoken of in Job.  Some professor says that there are multiple Ha-Satans, whereas other suggest that there is only one accuser, that being Satan as the Christians understand him.  </p>\n\n<p>Which interpretation is correct?  Who is the serpent?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>i will answer you without citing very many sources, because to try and cite them, and then try to put them in context, and compare them to other sources, would be a dissertation and may be information overload. </p>\n\n<p>So let's start with some of the simpler things that do not get involved with theology:</p>\n\n<p>First, Lucifer is never mentioned in the Bible, in the Hebrew scriptures, nor in the Greek New Testament. Lucifer is the latin translation for \"shining one\" in Isaiah 14:12, which is why in spanish or other latin languages you see the word for light as luz, or having a similar sound to it. So if you were to travel back in time to meet any prophets, they would look at you like a crazy person for using the word Lucifer, as the word didn't exist until the latin Vulgate. And once the latin Vulgate had established Lucifer as the name of \"satan,\" tradition carried it forward to most Christian English translations of the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>Second: Satan is actually a normal Hebrew word, it can be used as a verb, or an adjective, or a noun, and is often used in many more contexts/scriptures than you realize. The Angel that opposes Bilaam and his donkey is actually described as a satan, because satan means to stand in opposition to, or to accuse. As far as i know, throughout the entire Hebrew Bible, it is never once used as a name. In the book of Job, many English translations say that \"Satan was in heaven.\" But that ignores the obvious Hebrew wording for the sake of Christian tradition again, the phrasing is actually \"THE Satan.\" The accuser/adversary. So as far as the book of Job is concerned, there was indeed a designated Angel who's job it was to accuse or oppose. Think of it like \"the prosecutor.\" So you can find a normal angel who stands in opposition of someone using the verb/adjective of satan, or you can find references to THE satan, as a noun (though not a proper name).</p>\n\n<p>Now for the theology parts:</p>\n\n<p>You can find lots of examples within the centuries of Judaism that fit all the opinions and questions you are asking for. Some Rabbis will say it was The Satan in the garden, others would be horrified to hear such an idea. The main difference between Christianity and Judaism is that Christianity focuses on theology/dogma (correct belief) whereas Judaism focuses on orthopraxy (correct actions). No one is going to be upset at you for holding x belief of satan over y, but if you don't keep kosher the right way, that is an issue needing to be discussed.</p>\n\n<p>So in Judaism who is the serpent? Some say it is the selfish animal nature of humanity, some say it's Satan, some say it was actually just a serpent. Some say it's all allegory for the sake of teaching a lesson. Judaism is about asking lots of questions, whose answers can bring insight and meaning to different people at different times. We aren't concerned with the right belief, because if the right beliefs were going to get us to the world to come, then the Bible would be a very different book. The Bible is full of examples of how to be righteous, it is NOT a book telling you the right things to believe.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the rationale behind tashlumin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I understand that according to <em>Masechet Brachot</em> and the normative <em>halacha</em>, in certain cases, one who unintentionally missed saying a prayer service may \"make up\" that service by reciting the <em>Shmoneh Esrei</em> twice in the next service (<em>Tashlumin</em>). I know that there are many laws about exactly what to say and in which cases this opportunity exists, and whether this applies to the recitation of the <em>Shma</em>, and I know that even in the <em>gemara</em>, there is a discussion of whether this entire concept is actually efficacious or whether missed opportunities are missed.</p>\n\n<p>But what I don't get is why this would ever be an option at all.</p>\n\n<p>If we miss an obligation to perform a <em>mitzvah</em>, why would one think that we can \"make good\" by doing the <em>mitzvah</em> twice later? It isn't the <a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/vbm/english/archive/halak71/14halak.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">case</a> for lighting candles (though I know some women increase the number of candles they light <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/454211/jewish/A-Missed-Opportunity.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">permanently</a> if they miss lighting on a <em>Shabbat</em>), and I can't think of another <em>mitzvah</em> where it IS the case. If I forget to <em>bentch</em>, I can't <em>bentch</em> twice after my next meal. If I forget to give <em>matanot le'evyonim</em> on one Purim, I can't give twice the next year. If I don't put on <em>tefillin</em> today, to I put them on twice tomorrow?</p>\n\n<p>Why should there be a chance to make <em>tashlumin</em>, and why would it only be for <em>Shmoneh</em> <em>Esrei</em>? Is it just because \"the <em>gemara</em> says so\" or is there an underlying rule or logical principle involved?</p>\n\n<p>Note -- I see this as related to, but not a duplicate of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18722/what-does-it-mean-to-make-up-for-prayers-unavoidably-missed-tashlumin\">What does it mean to make up for prayers unavoidably missed - Tashlumin?</a> because I see that question as based in the understanding of \"<em>Tashlumin</em>\" as \"making up\" whereas I see it as \"completing an obligation\" so I am less concerned with the object to whom one \"makes up\" and more with the notion that we can \"complete\" a <em>mitzvah</em> at some other time by doing it twice in any situation.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The basic scheme seems to be that Teffilos are רחמי and לואי שיתפלל כלל היום כולו, if only people would spend their entire day praying. Therefore a missed Teffila is not considered having passed it's time constraints. This is in stark contrast to a Teffila which was set up specially in place of a Korban such as Musaf. Once the proper time for that Tefilla passes, it's too late. See Tosafos in Brachos 26b s.v. איבעיא להו.\nThis distinction between Mussaf and other Teffilos is brought in Shulchan Aruch 108:6. </p>\n\n<p>There is another related point from Tshuvas Rashba brought in Prisha 1. The Aruch HaShulchan 13 also brings it when trying to explain the Mechaber in siff three who's words are based off this Rashba. The Rashba says the only time tashlumin works is when a person prays the teffila he is required to pray at that time, and then his last tefila which he messed up will also be excepted before Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>The Prisha builds off this Rashba and says just like one cannot pray the Tashlumin too early, meaning before the chov, so too he cannot push it off later, meaning one must pray the Tashlumin immediately after the chov, without taking a long break between them. (With this he explains the importance of the statement of the Rivash to say Ashrei before the Tashlumin for mincha brought in Ramma siff two.)</p>\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan used a phrase based off the Rashba  'while one is involved with praying עוסק בתפילתו , he can make up his mistake from the last tefila'.</p>\n\n<p>From both of these sources it seems that Tashlumin is an ability to squeeze the old missed Teffila through the opening of opportunity of acceptance along with the present Teffila. This would seemingly only make sense if Teffilos are Rachami which itself has no real time constraints as mentioned before, and not an act to be performed with a second chance clause.</p>\n\n\n",

Even the king of israel or the kohen gaol or a previously verified prophet</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Yes this law applies to everyone, even the king of Israel, the kohen gadol, or a previously verified prophet--see Sefer Hachinuch 517. In fact, there is a specific prohibition not to fear executing a false prophet (Sefer HaChinuch 519). Actually, there are some who say that the death penalty applies only to someone who could plausibly have been a prophet, but if the person could not have been a prophet regardless, he would not receive the death penalty--see Minchat Chinuch 517. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The death penalty appears to be a Heavenly one. The obvious source in Tanach is Jeremiah chapter 28, where a false prophet called Hananiah prophecies that Nebuchadnezzar's rule would be overthrown within 2 years and Judah restored to its own sovereignity.</p>\n\n<p>Jeremiah responds firstly with \"so it may be so..\" but warns Hananiah about false prophecies and then passes the word of G-d that he will die within a year, which he does.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16025/jewish/Chapter-28.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16025/jewish/Chapter-28.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Sanhedrin runs through laws regarding prophets and prophecies. In general, a \"bad\" prophecy might be overturned (e.g. Jonah) through \"teshuva, tefila and tzedaka\" but a good one will always come to pass (unless it's a false one).</p>\n\n<p>With regards to the \"detail\". it's often in the detail that it becomes clear that the prophecy was a true one. We see this a lot with Elisha. For example, the price of flour after the famine, and what happened to the king's steward who laughed at the prophecy. (The first is an example of a good prophecy. If that hadn't happened it would have meant Elisha was a false prophet. But of course he wasn't. With regards to the second, if the steward had responded \"I have sinned before Hashem\" and done a true teshuva, that one might have been overturned).</p>\n\n\n",

How is this reconciled with a person not to blame for words uttered in pain, as cited in <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0899061710\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Goldberg (1996) Mourning in Halacha</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even if a sick person, due to his pain and suffering, blasphemes, God forbid, it is proper for the visitor to overlook it and not even to admonish the sick person about it, for a person is not to blame for words uttered in pain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/d9IVG.jpg\" alt=\"scan from book\"></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The story is from <em>Avot deRabi Natan</em>. Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai visited someone who was in severe pain and cursed out God because of it. The conclusion of the story is that the best thing for the visitor to do is be a good listener, not show up to lecture the sufferer about faith.</p>\n\n<p>So if I see someone now cursing out God because of the pain, it's not <em>my place</em> to give them a talking-to. </p>\n\n<p>There are three distinctions between this and the woman in childbirth: a.) it's between her and God, no one is lecturing her. b.) she brings the sin offering once she's recovered; we're not demanding any religious thought of her while she's screaming in pain! c.) most significantly, the midrash about the sin offering isn't \"in case she cursed out God in pain\", but rather \"in case she swore never to touch her husband again.\" We may not take people to task for blaming God when in pain, but an oath is an oath. (Unless someone was tortured <em>into taking the oath</em>, which this wasn't.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara is not saying that the Korban is to atone for the words spoken during childbirth. It is to atone for reneging on what was sworn then. The concept of ignoring what was said during a time of distress is that complaints which would otherwise be inappropriate can be understood as coming from pain. This wasn't meant to apply to promises and swearing. A person can control himself that much.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Rav Yosef asked on this reasoning that the Korban does not match that of all other Shvuos. It is unusual for an Amora to critique a Tanna on Halachic matters (especially using the term מתקיף לה, which connotes refuting rather than begging to understand). Besides, the Gemara does not bother answering the question. </p>\n\n<p>It seems that the point of the question was to point out that it wasn't meant to be taken at face value. In fact, hardly anyone would actually verbalize such a vow.</p>\n\n<p>The Maharal explains that this vow is an inherent intention, albeit not a conscious one. It is a position which doesn't need to be expressed. He explains that you entered a marriage for your benefit and here it turns against you. </p>\n\n<p>It is not an actual Shvuah and is not treated as such but there was a powerful break from the bond with her husband, analogous to a verbalized vow.</p>\n\n\n",

To whom do you ask?</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam holds that the Torah will never change, not even a single part of it. He even includes that as one of his 13 principles. His claim is based in the fact that the Torah is the absolute truth, and truth doesn't change.</p>\n\n<p>The Sefer Haikarim, however, says that while the truth doesn't change, the torah is meant to be a way for humans towards that truth, and humans Do change, with the circumstances of space and time. And that kind of change has already happened, for example, Adam was given only 7 commandments, and couldn't eat meat, then that was allowed to Noach, while adding a mitzvah of עבר מן החי.\nNeedless to say, this kind of changes can only be given by god himself, and in Matan Torah, he defined what it is a divine command-giving event like. So unless something like Matan Torah (<em>everybody</em> reaching a level of prophecy) happens again, we wont accept any change on the Torah</p>\n\n\n",

He continued the evening and conducted his seder in his traditional fashion, only omitting a dance during nirtzah. He said Kaddish the next day, despite the fact that his father was at that point unburied. </p>\n\n<p>I know, from my grandfather's passing, that directly after one learns of a close relative's death, one becomes exempt from all positive timebound mitsvot,until arrangements for the burial have been completed. However, what is the status of aninut when a close relative dies on Shabbat and one learns of the death on the same Shabbat?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>PS.

Note that both the execption for Shabbos and the exception for the seder night apply to the case that you specify.</p>\n\n<p>The first exception is when it is <strong>impossible</strong> for the person to be involved with the niftar (deceased person).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><p>The deceased is not in the possession of his relatives, as when the government has not released the body to the family, or if he was\n  drowned, or if he is missing in combat and cannot be found, although\n  there may be certain knowledge of his death.</p></li>\n  <li><p>He could not physically be present at the funeral preparations because he is under military obligation, or is confined in a hospital\n  or prison, or is overseas, or is in a city too distant from the\n  funeral.

He is\n  permitted meat and wine and is obligated to perform all the mandatory\n  Sabbath observances.

The onen should attend religious\n  services. Preferably he should not serve as reader or cantor. He\n  should not recite the Kaddish if other mourners are present, unless he\n  has Yahrzeit or is in the midst of the year of mourning for one of his\n  parents.</p>\n  \n  <p>On the first night of Passover, the onen should observe all the\n  mitzvot of the Seder night. On Sefirah days, between Passover and\n  Shavuot, the onen should refrain from reciting the counting of the\n  days with the blessing, until immediately after burial. After the\n  funeral, he may count the days and recite the blessing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Concerning the issue of women\n  reciting Kaddish, Rav Goldberg notes the following: \"If the deceased\n  left only daughters, although some have permitted a daughter to recite\n  Kaddish at a prayer service in her home, virtually all other Poskim\n  disagree and rule that a daughter should not recite Kaddish even in\n  her home.\" (Mourning in Halachah, chapter 39:21, p. 359) Thus it would\n  appear that halakhic authorities are generally opposed to women\n  reciting Kaddish whether at home or in the synagogue.</p>\n  \n  <p>The difficulty with this pervasive negative halakhic orientation is\n  that it fails to take into consideration the rulings of the three most\n  influential halakhic sages in America. Indeed, it is openly recognized\n  that the rulings of the following three rabbis permeated the essence\n  and formed the standards of synagogue life in America: namely, Rav\n  Yosef Eliyahu Henkin, Rav Moshe Feinstein and Rav Yosef Dov\n  Soloveitchik.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Henkin (1880-1973) was the Director of Ezrat Torah, a relief\n  organization for needy rabbis. Each year, he authored and published\n  the popular \"Luach\" for synagogue life wherein he detailed halakhic\n  practices. He was deemed the \"Posek haDor\", the decisor for issues\n  impacting on synagogue life. Concerning women saying Kaddish, he\n  wrote: \"The question as to whether a [bereaved] daughter may recite\n  the Kaddish is bound up with her observance of the Sabbath, kashruth,\n  and the laws of family purity. If she does keep these basic mitzvoth,\n  it is permissible for her to say Kaddish in the women's gallery while\n  the men are doing so in the synagogue proper.\" (Teshuvot Ivra. The\n  entire text of the teshuva is translated by David Telsner, The\n  Kaddish, p. 301.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Subsequent to Rav Henkin, the halakhic arbiter for American Orthodox\n  synagogues was Rav Moshe Feinstein, of blessed memory. In a posthumous\n  publication of his responsa, the following is reported. Rav Moshe was\n  concerned with whether it was necessary to have a Mehitza separating\n  the men and women sections for prayer, in the event that there were\n  only one or two women . He notes: \"Throughout the generations the\n  common custom was for a poor woman to be in the Bet haMidrash to\n  receive charity, or as a mourner to recite Kaddish.\" His response was\n  that a Mehitza was necessary even for one woman [who attended] on a\n  regular basis. On an occasional basis, it was not necessary, should\n  only one or two women be present. (Iggrot Moshe, Vol. 8, O.H. 5:12b)\n  Note the terminology and the concern. Rav Moshe does not question the\n  propriety of the woman who comes to the Bet haMidrash to recite\n  Kaddish. He seems to assume that there are no halakhic qualms at all\n  with such a function of women at religious services. The only problem\n  is whether there need be a Mehitza during her recital. Indeed, it is\n  apparent that Rav Moshe accepts a woman reciting Kaddish as a normal,\n  unquestionable practice.</p>\n  \n  <p>For many thousands of students of Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik, of\n  blessed memory, (former Rosh haYeshiva of Yeshiva University, and\n  halakhic authority for the Rabbinical Council of America) a halakhic\n  ruling from him was deemed authoritative. It is reported that Rav\n  Soloveitchik ruled that is was permissible for women to recite Kaddish\n  in synagogue. (cited by Joel Wolowelsky in a letter to the editor of\n  HaDarom, vol. 57, Ellul 5748/1988, pp. 157-158.)</p>\n  \n  <p>It is important to note that the ruling of the Havot Yair (1638-1702)\n  cited by the Pit-hei Teshuva and the ArtScroll translation is not an\n  accurate rendition of the actual position of the Havot Yair. The\n  following is a full translation of the responsum of Havot Yair:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[translation not included for space reasons - see article]</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I suggest that many may have misread the concerns of the Havot Yair.\n  He was not perturbed by a woman reciting Kaddish at a regular minyan.\n  Note that the case was not dealing with a regular minyan for daily\n  services, but related to a very unique request. It was for a minyan to\n  learn Torah in a home and for a woman to recite Kaddish subsequent to\n  the learning. It was, therefore, an unusual request. It was as if it\n  was not important for the daughter to recite Kaddish at a normal\n  minyan for morning, afternoon and evening services. The only concern\n  was for the daughter to say Kaddish after a special Torah learning\n  session. This was deemed a denigration of the normal recitation of\n  Kaddish. To permit this and not be concerned with saying Kaddish after\n  a regular daily prayer was tantamount to giving people the right to\n  make new customs and disdain the old. Accordingly, the Havot Yair\n  opposed such a practice. However, should a daughter pray in a regular\n  synagogue and recite Kaddish together with the other mourners, perhaps\n  even the Havot Yair would permit such a practice for the reasons he\n  himself articulated:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>While it seems that @SabbaHillel seemed to cover the basic points., I'll add in what I've seen regarding this issue. There will likely be plenty of overlap, but hopefully I'll be able to add certain points as well.</p>\n\n<p>To start off with, Artscroll's Mourning in Halachah (39:21) seems to unequivocally say that a woman should not say Kaddish. In one of the footnotes, the Mateh Ephraim is quoted, and seems to imply that there might be an issue of Kol Isha.</p>\n\n<p>What's interesting is that the above source seems to say that almost all sources strongly discourage a woman from from saying Kaddish, but several strong 'mainstream' sources seem to allow a woman to say Kaddish. The Be'er Haitaiv (132:5) says that if we want to, we can assemble a Minyan to let a woman say Kaddish (wording seemed to strongly imply that it's optional, not obligatory), with the Sharei Teshuva (also 132:5) adding the caveat that the Minyan should be assembled at the woman's home. Neither source mentions anything about Kol Isha, which would imply that it isn't an issue here, for whatever reason.</p>\n\n<p>It's interesting to note, though, that historically, Kaddish has been said differently than most Ashkenzic communities nowadays say it. Nowadays, it seems that the custom has almost universally evolved into a situation where all the mourners say every Kaddish all together as one. It seems like in the past (although someone I know shared a story where he was in a Shul in Israel (Jerusalem, I believe) and they still had this custom) only one mourner would say a Kaddish, and the mourners would 'cycle' and take turns for each Kaddish (to the point where if there were more mourners than available Kaddishes, some mourners wouldn't get a chance to say Kaddish during that Minyan). The above Be'er Haitaiv and Sharei Teshuva both seem to be discussing saying Kaddish in the 'old fashion', and presumably Mourning in Halachah (as it was published relatively more recently - 1991) deals with the more common manner of saying Kaddish.</p>\n\n<p>As a conclusion, while I haven't found the source for my comments in the question (which is touched upon in Sabba Hillels excellent and thorough answer), I stand by what I said that a woman is allowed to say Kaddish in a Shul from behind the Mechitzah (although possibly only with other men saying it along as well). I've seen this done in different (Orthodox) Shuls and remember hearing my Rebbi say this is allowed.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, the Rema (Darchei Moshe OC 567:2), Elya Rabba (567:5) and Baer Heitev (OC 567:5) relate that the Maharil used to rinse his mouth with water while being particular not to swallow any.<br>\n  The Mishna Berura (567:11 quoting the Chayei Adam 132:20) writes that on one of the minor fasts one may rinse their mouth with water if they are uncomfortable and on Tisha B’av, one may only do so if they are suffering. One doing so should bend over the sink to ensure that they don’t swallow any water. A healthy person cannot rinse one’s mouth on Yom Kippur.<br>\n  The poskim write that brushing one’s teeth is the same as rinsing one’s mouth (See Minchas Yitzchak 4:109).<br>\n  R’ Ovadia Yosef (Yalkut Yosef, Ta’anis, 13) writes that if one is uncomfortable not brushing one’s teeth, one may do so, though ensure that one uses less than a revi’is of water and try not to swallow any.<br>\n  The Aruch Hashulchan (OC 567:3) is more lenient still, allowing one to rinse (but not gargle) even with more than a revi’is of water.<br>\n  In conclusion, one who wants to brush their teeth on a minor ta’anis may do so, though they should ensure that they don’t swallow any water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There have been several publicized law suits in a few states where a gay couple sued a caterer that refused to cater a gay couple marriage because the caterer stood on religious principles. In all these publicized cases, the caterer lost the suit and in at least one case, had to pay damages. As far as I know, all these gay marriages were Gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>My question is focused on these aspects:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>In viewing the answers to the linked question, it seems that halachically, Noahides have accepted the prohibition of gay marriage. It is unclear how Jews should should enforce these rules.</p></li>\n<li><p>Va'adei Rabanim have had a practice of using the owner's adherence to <em>mitzvoth</em> as criteria for certifying a place. (E.g., many Va'adim will not certify a kosher establishment if the owner is not <em>Shomer Shabbat</em>, even if the food is 100% kosher.) I am uncertain as to why this plays a factor as it doesn't seem to have anything that directly affects the kashrut of the food. This is another aspect of my question. I.e. - IF a caterer decides to cater a gay marriage affair, halachically, MUST or should the Va'ad revoke the kashrut?</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Din Demalchut</em> <strong>may</strong> play a role in these cases, eventually at the point that a gay couple files suit against a kosher caterer. If there is no direct halachic basis for a Va'ad to revoke kashrut based on #2, would the Va'ad have to halachically allow caterers to cater to gay couples and furthermore require that they do so to obey <em>Din Demalchut</em> to keep their certification (in a sense, the opposite effect of #2.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Is there any difference in the criteria if the caterer performs a Gentile gay couple affair or a Jewish gay couple affair? </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

When he would tell her, \"Prepare me\nlentils.\" she would [instead] prepare <em>chimtzei</em> (<em>Rashi</em> - possibly\npeas) [If he said, \"Prepare me] <em>chimtzei</em>\", she would [instead]\nprepare lentils.

[However] you should\nnot do this, for it says (<em>Jeremiah</em> 9:4) <em>they train their tounge to\nspeak falsehood, striving etc. (to be iniquitous)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, you would be training the children (as well as yourself) to cheat As we see from the medrash, this is not allowed even from \"good\" motives.

Even\nso, this is prohibited because it is said: \"From a false matter keep\nfar.\"</p>\n<p>The Sephardic author of Ben Yehoyada suggests (Yevamot 65b) that the\ngeneral rule permitting truth to be altered for purposes of peace has\na basic limitation: i.e., the rule relates only to a situation where\nthere is - a preexisting problem where an untrue statement may.\nmaintain calm and harmony.

Generally, the rule is that any commandment of the Torah does not demand martyrdom for its observance with the exception of the 3 severe sins (idolatry, sexual crimes [i.e. adultery, incest, homosexuality, and bestiality], and murder) and the desecration of G-d's name (see Rambam <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=50\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Hilchot Yesodei Hatorah</em> 5:2</a>). However, at a time when there is a movement on the part of the non-Jewish authorities to destroy Jewish practices, then even minor commandments (or even mere customs) also demand martyrdom for their observance (see e.g. Rambam <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=51\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Yesodei HaTorah</em> 5:3</a>). What is the extent of this rule? Is a distinction made for when the existence of the entire Jewish people is threatened (e.g. in the days of Haman or the Holocaust) vs. just that of an individual ? Are there any other limitations that mitigate how widely this rule is applied - for example, is there any reason why it might not apply to being involved in <em>halachically</em> forbidden ceremonies (such as gay marriages or abortions) where the government might mandate the involvement as part of \"anti-discrimination\" statutes?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You ask, “Is a distinction made for when the existence of the entire Jewish people is threatened vs. just that of an individual (e.g. in the days of Haman or the Holocaust)?” </p>\n\n<p>In Halacha 1, Rambam says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Should a gentile arise and force a Jew to violate one of the Torah's\n  commandments at the pain of death, he should violate the commandment\n  rather than be killed,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>from the expression “and force a Jew” it seems that the mitzvo of giving up one's life applies even if the life of one Jew is threatened.</p>\n\n<p>You ask, “Are there any other limitations that mitigate how widely this rule is applied - for example, is there any reason why it might not apply to being involved in halachically forbidden ceremonies (such as gay marriages or abortions) where the government might mandate the involvement as part of \"anti-discrimination\" statutes?”</p>\n\n<p>Halacha 3 states,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All the above [distinctions] apply [only in times] other than times of\n  a decree.

There's no problem analyzing the <em>generalities</em> of the situation.</p>\n\n<p>However, you cannot rightfully form a judgment or an opinion such as, \"He failed, and I would have succeeded\" unless you have been in the same situation with identical circumstances. That's forming an opinion with insufficient facts.</p>\n\n<p>The best that you can do is analyze the generalities.</p>\n\n\n",

It is mainly about <em>emunah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Think about it. Why didn't G-d just leave the mahn like a huge supermarket where there was so much of it that people could take a lot and store some of it for later? In the story, you see what happened to people that left over the mahn. It got wormy and melted. So every day, people had to go into the field to gather mahn for just that day. Why? To teach people their <em>emunah</em>. How did everyone know that the next day they wouldn't have mahn? Indeed, that's what happened to some people on Shabbat when they went and didn't find it. They thought The mahn had ended! Only when Moshe reminded them, that it was just on Shabbat that they wouldn't have mahn (which is why on Friday they took a double portion) were they re-assured. That was a temporary lack of <em>emunah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In short, try reading <em>parshat ha-mahn</em> daily. Read it with some good commentaries, perhaps, so that you can understand and better appreciate how G-d provides everything you need each day, <strong>every day</strong>. It is more than just a historical lesson of <em>emunah</em>. Its message is highly applicable to all of us today, as well.</p>\n\n<p><em>Behatzlacha Ve'emunah</em></p>\n\n\n",

This concept is called <em>`oseh min ha-'asui</em> (essentially, \"attempting to fulfill the <em>misswah</em> [of <em>ssissith</em>] from something already made beforehand\"), and it is not permissible.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (<em>Hilkhoth Ssissith</em> 1:12-13) says the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>wa-ssissith shen-na`asath min he-'asui miq-qodhem pasulah. kessadh? hevi kanaf shey-yesh bo ssissith uthfarah 'al hab-beghedh afilu yesh be-othah hak-kanaf ammah 'al ammah pesulah, shen-ne'emar \"wa-'asu lahem ssissith\" wa-lo min he-'asui she-hareizeh domeh le-mi shen-na'asath me-eleyha. Umuttar le-hattir ssissith mib-beghedh zeh wa-lithlothah be-veghedh ahher - ben lavan ben tekheleth.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Translation</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>\"And [when the misswah of ssissith is] performed using [ssissiyyoth] that were already made, it is invalid. What is a practical example? Someone brought a [severed] corner of a garment on which there is [already a] ssissith, and sews it onto another garment - even if that corner has a square <em>ammah</em> of cloth still attached (i.e. the smallest possible area of a garment that is still subject to the laws of <em>ssissith</em>) - it is invalid. As it is said, '<em>wa-`asu lahem ssissith</em> - And they shall make for themselves <em>ssissith</em>' (<em>Bamidbar</em> 15:38) [in order to perform the <em>misswah</em>] and they should not attempt to perform it [using <em>ssissiyoth</em>] that were already made, for this is like a garment that became <em>messuyyesseth</em> (\"tassled\") on its own. But it is permissible to untie <em>ssissiyyoth</em> from one garment and [re-]tie them onto another garment - whether they contain <em>tekheleth</em> or whether they are completely white.\"</p>\n\n<p>[See also 1:14-16 for cases involving this concept.]</p>\n\n<p>And although it should be obvious, the transferring of <em>ssissiyyoth</em> from one garment to another mentioned in the closing statement this <em>halakhah</em> does NOT mean that one may take whole/tied <em>ssissiyyoth</em> from one garment and simply attached them - with a cow's hitch or by any other means - to another garment. To do so would violate the first statement of the <em>halakhah</em>. Rather, it means <strong><em>to completely untie</em></strong> the <em>ssissiyyoth</em> on one garment, thread the strings into the corner of another garment and re-tie them.</p>\n\n<p>As it says in the new edition of the <em>Mishneh Torah</em> with explanatory notes by HaRav Yohai Maqbili (<strong>יצ\"ו</strong>) and jointly published by <em>yeshivoth</em> \"<em>Or Wiyeshua`</em>\" and \"<em>Torath Hhayyim</em>\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>להתיר ציצית... ולתלותה</strong> - שאינו מעביר את הציצית בשלמותה מבגד לבגד אלא מתיר את החוטים ועושה מהם ציצית חדשה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<strong>Translation</strong>: \"To untie <em>ssissiyyoth</em>...and to hang them\" - Not that one is transferring the <em>ssissith</em> while it is still fully-tied. Rather, he is completely untying the strings and from them making a new <em>ssissith</em>.\")</p>\n\n<p>In short, <em>ssissiyyoth</em> that are put onto any garment while already fully-tied are invalid without exception. Thus, attaching them impermanently with a \"cow hitch\" to the corners of your garment so that you may remove them and easily re-attach them is <strong><em>not permissible</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.

One would therefore need to recite both shehakol and ha’etz (ideally on another raisin, etc).</p>\n<p>The Baer Hetev (204:19) holds that the raisin is the ikar (See Mekor Habrocha 22) while the Vezos Habracha (p96-97) quotes one opinion that chocolate is the ikar, and another that as the volume of the raisin is usually greater than the chocolate, the correct beracha should be ha’etz (see Yalkut Yosef 3 p431).

When did this halakha change?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In actuality the halacha still applies today. This law can be found in the Shulchan Aruch Chapter 147, section 1 and is derived from the Talmud, tractate Megilla 32a.</p>\n\n<p>We can see the discussion in <a href=\"http://hearos.blogspot.com/2014/07/megillah-7a-kisvei-hakodesh-making-your.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Megillah 7a - Kisvei HaKodesh Making Your Hands Tamei</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Where does this halacha of kisvei hakodesh being metamei come from\n  and why? Rashi references the sugya in Shabbos 14a. The gemara in\n  Shabbos says there were two independent gezeiros made on kisvei\n  hakodesh. One was that it is metamei Terumah because there was a\n  tendency to store the Terumah next to the Torah in the Aron Kodesh\n  causing mice to nibble at the Torah when they went to eat the Terumah.\n  Therefore, chazal were gozer tu'mah on the Torah that it would be\n  metamei teruma as a way to prevent people from putting the Terumah\n  next to the Torah in the Aron. A second gezeira that was made was that\n  a Torah would be metamei one's hands. The rationale for this the\n  gemara explains has nothing to do with Terumah, rather it is based on\n  the din of R. Pranach - האוחז ס\"ת ערום נקבר ערום בלא אותה מצוה. One\n  who holds a bare Sefer Torah is punished that whatever mitzvah they\n  were doing while holding the Torah, they lose reward for that mitzvah.\n  Rashi explains that people's hands were generally dirty (not\n  necessarily tamei) and they would touch the Torah with dirty hands,\n  which is why R. Pranach said that it is assur. To prevent people from\n  touching a Torah with dirty hands, they were gozer tu'mah on kisvei\n  hakodesh. Since one's hands would be come tamei by touching the\n  scroll, they would refrain from touching it.</p>\n  \n  <p>Tosafos (Shabbos 14a) writes that the din of R. Pranach applies\n  equally to all kisvei hakodesh from the simple fact that chazal were\n  gozer that ALL kisvei hakodesh would make one's hands tamei. Rashi in\n  Megilla implies that as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As we see <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=873\" rel=\"nofollow\">Touching a Torah Scroll with One’s Bare Hands</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Gemara in Masechet Shabbat (14) cites a Halacha in the name of\n  Rabbi Parnach forbidding touching the parchment of a Torah scroll\n  barehanded. One who must touch the scroll must do so indirectly, while\n  holding some material in his hand, such as a cloth or Tallit. The\n  Gemara warns that a person who touches the scroll barehanded forfeits\n  the Misva in which he is involved, Heaven forbid. Thus, for example,\n  if a Sofer (scribe) is writing a Sefer Torah, or if somebody studies\n  from the scroll, lifts it to show it to the congregation, or rolls it,\n  he forfeits the merit of the Misva if he directly touches the scroll\n  while performing that Misva.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Shulhan Aruch (Orah Haim 147:1) codifies this Halacha (listen to\n  audio recording for precise citation), and adds that it applies even\n  if one washes his hands just before handling the Sefer Torah. One\n  might have thought that this issue depends solely on the Tum’a\n  (impurity) of one’s hands, such that it would be permissible to\n  directly touch the scroll after performing Netilat Yadayim. According\n  to the accepted Halacha, however, even immediately after performing\n  Netilat Yadayim it is forbidden to directly touch the scroll.</p>\n  \n  <p>The exception to this rule is the scroll of Megilat Ester. Although\n  the prohibition against directly touching a Torah scroll applies also\n  to the Megila, Hacham Ovadia Yosef rules (based on the Kaf Ha’haim)\n  that the one who reads Megilat Ester may touch the scroll after\n  washing his hands, as the Megila may be treated more leniently than a\n  Sefer Torah.</p>\n  \n  <p>Summary: It is forbidden to directly touch the parchment of a Sefer\n  Torah; one who must touch the scroll should make sure to do so\n  indirectly, while holding a cloth or his Tallit. This applies even if\n  one washed Netilat Yadayim. However, one may directly touch a Megilat\n  Ester after performing Netilat Yadayim without a Beracha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's not really that the law has changed; it's just that it's become rather moot.</p>\n\n<p>The problem was that people would store their holy scrolls (Torah or other parts of Nach) with the \"holy food\" in the house, i.e. the tithes that had to be given to a Kohen. The problem is that pests eating the food would damage the scrolls. The rabbis therefore decreed that the scrolls were just impure enough that they would contaminate \"holy food\", forcing people to keep the scrolls away from the holy food. It's highly technical, but here are the mechanics, roughly: a corpse is contamination level -1, a dead lizard level 0, a contaminated clay pot, or a person who touched a dead lizard, level 1; contaminated normal food, level 2; contaminated tithings are level 3, and contaminated sacrifices are level 4. (I'm following Talmudic nomenclature here, in which lower levels are stronger; sorry it's confusing.)  The scrolls were declared to be Level 2, which contaminate tithings (Level 3) but not ordinary food (can only become a Level 2 by touching a Level 1 or stronger). </p>\n\n<p>If a person touches weak-level impurity, they remedy the situation by washing their hands. There is some discussion about washing hands concerning those who directly handle a scroll, but otherwise it's pretty moot today. We're all sufficiently contaminated (usually at Level 0) today that we don't really care. A Kohen is only prohibited from exposure to a corpse, not scrolls. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I asked this question to a rabbi last week. He said that people used to store their torahs in the safest, most water resistant part of their dwelling- the pantry. Apparently scrolls were being damaged by rats in the pantry so they made this decree so people would find the mixture of food and scrolls repugnant. Apparently tosafos says this.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Difference between הנאה for doing a service for free and for lending an object for free\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am learning the Mishnayot of Masechet Nedarim and I came across an apparent contradiction that I cannot quite wrap my head around. The seifa of the first mishna in the fourth perek mentions that a person (we'll call him Reuven) who has made a neder not to benefit from his neighbor (Shimon)'s food cannot borrow even a non-food-related tool for free if it is the type of tool which would normally be rented. The Rav Bartenura explains based on the Gemara that the reason is because Reuven could use the money that he saves by not paying to rent the item to buy food and he is therefore benefiting food-wise from Shimon.</p>\n\n<p>Fine. So far I understand. </p>\n\n<p>Now, the next couple of mishnayot discuss the kinds of services that Shimon can do for Reuven if Reuven made a neder not to get any הנאה from Shimon at all. Among these things are certain services that definitely save Reuven money. For example, Shimon may pay Reuven's מחצית השקל (since the money goes to the גזבר rather than to Reuven), or he may settle Reuven's debts (similar reasoning), or he may provide food for Reuven's wife (similar reasoning).</p>\n\n<p>My question is, what's the difference between the first case where Reuven is not allowed to indirectly get הנאה from Shimon and the second case where (at least to me) it seems like the הנאה is much more direct, but is still permitted?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>It seems like the issue is that we broaden the definition of food to include what can turn into food. By giving you this item he is in that way giving you food, or food currency.</p>\n\n<p>By saving you money, he will be at most saving you your own food, or food money. But he isn't giving you anything that will translate into food that can be traced to him.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Nedarim and Ksubos has two ways to explain this Mishna. Rav Hoshia says that this Mishna is according to Chanan, that when you pay up someone's debt he doesn't owe you anything for it. Therefore there is nothing that is considered to have gone over from benefactor to beneficiary. If you are not indebted to him for this it is as if he did an act in which you just happened to have gained.</p>\n\n<p>Rava says that it is even according to the Chachamim but it is talking about a case where he borrowed without any time limit, in which case there is no technical gain since at no point do I save what I would have lost.</p>\n\n\n",

As <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=15#C3034\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's <em>Living Torah</em> puts it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Since it was not specified what must be done to him, they placed him under guard.</strong>\nThe death penalty was specified (Exodus 31:14, 35:2). However, the form of the penalty had not been specified (Sanhedrin 78b; Sifri; Rashi).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 80b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא ושאר חייבי מיתות שבתורה אין ממיתין אותן אלא בעדה ועדים והתראה ועד שיודיעוהו שהוא חייב מיתת ב\"ד רבי יהודה אומר עד שיודיעוהו באיזה מיתה הוא נהרג ת\"ק יליף ממקושש ורבי יהודה אומר מקושש הוראת שעה היתה</p>\n<p>It was taught [Tosefta Sanhedrin 11:1]:</p>\n<p><em>... [incitement to worship idols can be punished without warning] ... but all other capital crimes in the Torah require a congregation, witnesses, and a warning [for the death penalty to be carried out]; and the warning must include that it carries execution by the courts. Rabbi Yehuda says: they must inform him what form of execution will be used.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The original opinion [\"it carries the death penalty\"] is derived from the wood-gatherer</strong> [of Numbers 15, for whom the form of execution was not yet known]. And Rabbi Yehuda says the wood-gatherer was a one-time exception [i.e. God explicitly ordered him executed despite what would generally be an inadequate warning].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=79&perek=12&halocha=2&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Laws of Sanhedrin and the Punishments Entrusted to Them 12:2</a> follows the majority opinion -- all they have to say is \"it carries the death penalty.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכיצד מתרין בו אומרין לו פרוש או אל תעשה שזו עבירה היא וחייב אתה עליה מיתת בית דין או מלקות.</p>\n<p>And how do they warn the transgressor? <em>\"Cease!\"</em> or <em>\"Don't do it!\"</em>, <em>\"as this is a sin and you will be liable to the death penalty or lashes.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I recall hearing that it was an Horaas Shaa, a unique ruling just got that time.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps, it can be understood that since the specific method of death was not commanded yet it was not a necessary part of the Hasraah. At that time the punishment consisted of the fact that he will get killed in some way. </p>\n\n<p>This is different from an התראת ספק, an unsure warning, because in this case this is the whole law.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What does it mean for atheists to raise their children 'Jewish'?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was reading the book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom by Amy Chua. In this book she mention that her Jewish husband is not religious in the slightest but still when they got married insisted that the children where raised 'Jewish'. I'm curious what exactly to be raised Jewish means in a general sense (as opposed to what it means to Ms. Chua specifically), especially considering that it is important for non-religious Jews as well.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Being \"Raised Jewish\" in this context means that, to the degree that there is any religious experience in the home, it is of Jewish origin. So if they go to a house of worship, it will be a synagogue. If they do something of a religious commemoration in the month of December, it will be Chanuka, and most significantly if the child asks what religion they are, they will be told \"Jewish\".</p>\n\n<p>The specific practices above are only common examples. Another very popular one in America is attending a Seder on Passover.</p>\n\n<p>Jews, even if they don't particularly practice their Judaism, often have a strong identity as \"Jewish\" and can want to pass that identity on to their children. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34848/postponing-circumcision-what-consequences\">here</a> for such an example). So exactly what form that takes will depend on what practices they were themselves particularly impressed with as children, but the general sentiment is this: They aren't particularly concerned with their children practicing the Jewish <em>religion</em> but they do want them to identify as Jews.</p>\n\n\n",

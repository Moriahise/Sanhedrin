    "content": "# Is having kavanah me'akev in the verse \"Hashem sifatay tiftach ufi yagid tehilatecha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One must have <em>kavanah</em> (intent/concentration) in the first bracha of Shemoneh Esrei. And if he didn't, he would have to repeat it. See the <em>g'mara</em> in <em>B'rachos</em> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.34b.15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">34b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>איכא דמתני לה אברייתא: המתפלל צריך שיכוין את לבו בכולן. ואם אינו יכול לכוין בכולן יכוין את לבו באחת. אמר רבי חייא: אמר רב ספרא משום חד דבי רבי: באבות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does this also apply to the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A0%D7%90_%D7%99%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verse</a> \"Hashem sifatay tiftach ufi yagid tehilatecha\" said before beginning <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Siddur_Sefard%2C_Weekday_Shacharit%2C_Amidah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the first bracha</a>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein in <em>Igros Moshe</em> vol. 8, Orach Chayim <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=922#p=125&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">24:8</a> discusses the closely related question of whether the opening (this one) and closing (\"...יהיו לרצון\") verses that surround <em>sh'mone esre</em> must be said at all (לעיכובא). He holds that in this day and age - when there are no <em>karbanos</em> - they must. In principle, not saying either of those lines would call for one repeating everything from that point on (though this applies differently to the closing <em>pasuk</em> than the opening one).</p>\n<p>From the 3rd page, righthand column:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל פשוט שמי שטעה בתפלתו באופן שצריך לחזור לראש כשהוא עדיין עומד בתפילה,‏ שלא עקר רגליו,‏ שלא יצטרך לחזור אלא לתחלת ברכה ראשונה שהוא מ\"ברוך אתה ה׳\",‏ לא מ\"ה׳ שפתי\".‏ מאחר דהתפילה עצמה מתחלת בברכה ראשונה שהוא מריש הברכה,‏ שהתחלתה הוא מ\"ברוך אתה ה׳\" דברכת אבות.‏</p>\n<p>Obviously somebody who erred in his <em>t'fila</em> in a way that requires him to return \"to the beginning\" while still standing in <em>t'fila</em> [mode], having not moved [from his position], would only need to return to the beginning of the first <em>b'racha</em>, i.e. \"ברוך אתה ה\", not [to] \"ה', שפתי\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if one were to have to repeat that prefatory <em>pasuk</em> it would be for its own sake, and not because it is part of the first <em>b'racha</em>.</p>\n<p>Further on, he explores the hypothetical situation in which an audience member is relying on the <em>sh'liach tzibur</em> to recite the <em>amida</em> by proxy, as opposed to the common practice today of listening intently to the repetition thereof after having discharged each of our personal obligations ourselves. He assumes that even those who are not well enough versed to say the whole <em>amida</em> could still learn or repeat word-for-word the verse in question, and that they would do so right before the repetition. However. . .</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‏ ואם היה מזדמן אחד שגם לומר עם אחר לא היה יכול לומר אף רק פסוק זה,‏ היה פטור מטעם אונס.‏</p>\n<p>If there were a person who was unable to say even this sole <em>pasuk</em> [by repeating after] another person, they would be exempt due to [the technical exemption from obligations that arises in the presence of uncontrollable external] forces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this does not address saying the words without intent, he seems to be setting the bar very low for what qualifies as prepending \"...ה', שפתי\" - i.e. repeating another person's words after them. Even if one were required to have some level of intent in saying that line (e.g. knowing that it was one's gateway to <em>t'fila</em> in a general sense) the requirement would be dissociated from the reason making intent during the first <em>b'racha</em> a sine qua non.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.111.1?lang=bi&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.111.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 111 (1) [1]</a> says about אדני שפתי תפתח וכ׳:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פסוק זה מכלל תפלה הוא דהא מהאי טעמא נוכל לומר אותו בין גאולה לתפילה\n  מפני דכיון דקבעוהו רבנן בתפלה יש לו דין תפלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>that it is part of the Tefillah. </p>\n\n<p>The מחזור מסורת הרב  (K'hal Publishing) quotes the hanhagos of Rav J B Soloveitchik. He insisted that the chazzan must </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“recite each and every word of the repetition of the Shemoneh Esrei\n  out loud, including the introductory verse אדני שפתי תפתח וכ׳.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is more strict than the standard ashkenazi practice which is to say it quietly. We see that  Rav Soloveitchik was strict in this respect with  the introductory verse.</p>\n\n<p>It is well established on this site that “Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence”. Nevertheless, I want to suggest that had Rav Soloveitchik held that kavanah in אדני שפתי תפתח וכ׳ was essential, this would have been recorded in the Hanhagos Harav. </p>\n\n<p>None of the commentators in Sefaria on the Shulchan Oruch OC 111 goes further than saying that אדני שפתי תפתח וכ׳ is part of the tefillah.</p>\n\n<p>On these grounds, I suggest that it is most unlikely that kavanah for אדני שפתי תפתח וכ׳ is essential to the extent that if one does not have kavanah one has to repeat the  Shemoneh Esrei. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How exactly did Solomon determine the child's mother?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In 1 Kings 3:16–28, Solomon judges a dispute between two prostitutes about the parentage of a baby. Readings of the story that I have previously seen indicate that Solomon identifies the mother <em>after</em> threatening to have the baby cut in half. (An example would be <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3949089/jewish/Judgement-of-Solomon.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this summary</a> of the haftarah from Chabad.) The logic of his ruse makes sense: the actual mother of the child would prefer to have the child raised by another woman rather than dead.</p>\n\n<p>However, the footnotes in the <em>Jewish Study Bible</em> seem to indicate that Solomon already knew who the mother was and simply chose to reveal the mother's identity with this ruse.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>23:</strong> <em>One says … the other says …</em> : Solomon discerns a distinctive pattern in each woman's speech: The more loquacious one emphasizes death first while the other emphasizes life. Solomon intuits who is the mother of the living child and announces it circumspectly. <strong>24–26:</strong> Since justice requires a more convincing demonstration of truth, Solomon stages a confrontation in which the passionate public behavior of the mother emphasizing life validates his intuition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Assuming I'm not just splitting hairs here, when exactly did Solomon figure out the mother's identity? If he already knew (in a sense) after the women spoke, was the confrontation supposed to confirm his answer, or was it <em>just</em> an instrument used to force the answer to be revealed \"naturally\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The commentaries have different angles on it. Radak says that the words of the first mother (the one who accused of a switch) just rang true when he heard them.</p>\n<p>(Notice that the verse says \"the true mother offered to give up the baby\" ... but doesn't actually tell us whether that true mother was the first one, who spends all these verses with the sob story about a switch, or the second one, who says very little.)</p>\n<p>Malbim actually says that the whole lengthy sob story is a ruse; what Radak felt was \"ringing true\" was actually a lie! The first mother says <strong>yours is dead and mine as alive</strong> (which means it's more important to her that the other one's is dead); the second, true mother, cares more that hers is alive, and therefore reverses the order -- <strong>mine is alive and yours is dead</strong>!</p>\n<p>(Note as well, in the Malbim's favor, that the plaintiff in the story is combining what she saw with what she presumes happened.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As I explain below, Shlomo knew from the claims and the circumstances which one was the <em>real</em> mother.

Had the living child been that of the mother-in-law, then the other woman would have had to wait until it grew up and was bar mitzvah in order to get yibum (or chalitzah). However if the child of the mother-in-law had died (even due to the decree of the king), she would have been completely free. This shows the motive of claiming the living child. It also shows why she was willing to let the king cut the baby in half (and kill it).</p>\n<p>Malbim on verse 22 says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכלל בלשון שהאדם יקדים תמיד מה שהוא העקר ויאחר את הטפל,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That people tend to put first what is most important to them and that is why the two women emphasized the different claims. Malbim explains that this is why the king called for his sword in order to show which one wanted the child to live and which one wanted the child to die.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולברר זאת אמר קחו לי חרב – כי בזה יבורר מי הרוצה שיחיה ומי שתתרצה שימות, וכן היה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Halachic status of ישמך אלקים כאפרים וכמנשה\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Yaakov blessed Ephraim and Menashe by stating that future generations would bless their children by saying \"ישמך אלקים כאפרים וכמנשה\" - \"God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.48.20?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 48:20</a>). Was this statement a prophecy or a proclamation?</p>\n\n<p>There are various customs to bless children with these words at various times, on Friday night (according to <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> this is a fairly recent custom first recorded by R' Chaim the Maharal's brother) or at a bris (not in Artscroll Ashkenaz but I see it in various sources, particularly Encyclopedia Talmudit).  Rashi says it was used, but not at any particular time.</p>\n\n<p>What's the halachic status of Yaakov's statement?  It's not counted as a mitzvah by the Rambam or as far as I know by anyone else.  It's apparently not even a \"derabbanan\"*, as it wasn't always practiced.  Was it a prophecy that \"at some point various Jewish communities will have customs to use this form of blessing for their kids\"?  Or was it a \"derabbanan\"* commandment that if you bless your kids, you should use these words?  Or that if you decide to give this blessing, you should say Ephraim first?  Or something else?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>* putting derabbanan in quotes because I'm not sure the terminology makes sense before Matan Torah, but I imagine a command from Yaakov Avinu is at least as binding as a gezeirah by the amoraim.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>This blessing is based upon a general principle found in Torah that, <em>the acts of the Patriarchs are a sign for their descendants.</em> (מעשה אבות סימן לבנים) This principle is also applied in matters of halacha, like is found for example in the commentary <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Divrei_Yirmiyahu_on_Mishneh_Torah%2C_Scroll_of_Esther_and_Hanukkah.1.3.1?vhe=Friedberg_Edition&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Yirmiyahu to Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Megillat Esther v'Chanukah, Chapter 1:3:1</a> by <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37168&st=&pgnum=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yirmiyahu ben Benyamin Wolf</a> <a href=\"https://www.geni.com/people/%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95-%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%95-%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%94%D7%93%D7%99%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95/6000000000008744439\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(1811-1874</a>), which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומעשה אבות סימן לבנים שאמרו רז\"ל נתקיים בהנעשה אז לאבותינו גם לבניהם אחריהם עד כהיום הזה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is discussed in general at this <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9F_%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia link</a> which points to the commentary of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.6?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban to Bereshit 12:6</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויעבר אברם בארץ עד מקום שכם <strong>אומר לך כלל תבין אותו בכל הפרשיות הבאות בענין אברהם יצחק ויעקב והוא ענין גדול הזכירוהו רבותינו בדרך קצרה ואמרו (תנחומא ט) כל מה שאירע לאבות סימן לבנים</strong> ולכן יאריכו הכתובים בספור המסעות וחפירת הבארות ושאר המקרים ויחשוב החושב בהם כאלו הם דברים מיותרים אין בהם תועלת <strong>וכולם באים ללמד על העתיד</strong> <strong>כי כאשר יבוא המקרה לנביא משלשת האבות יתבונן ממנו הדבר הנגזר לבא לזרעו ודע כי כל גזירת עירין כאשר תצא מכח גזירה אל פועל דמיון תהיה הגזרה מתקיימת על כל פנים</strong> ולכן יעשו הנביאים מעשה בנבואות כמאמר ירמיהו שצוה לברוך והיה ככלותך לקרוא את דברי הספר הזה תקשור עליו אבן והשלכתו אל תוך פרת ואמרת ככה תשקע בבל וגו' (ירמיה נא סג סד) וכן ענין אלישע בהניחו זרועו על הקשת (מלכים ב יג טז-יז) ויאמר אלישע ירה ויור ויאמר חץ תשועה לה' וחץ תשועה בארם ונאמר שם (פסוק יט) ויקצוף עליו איש האלהים ויאמר להכות חמש או שש פעמים אז הכית את ארם עד כלה ועתה שלש פעמים תכה את ארם <strong>ולפיכך החזיק הקב\"ה את אברהם בארץ ועשה לו דמיונות בכל העתיד להעשות בזרעו והבן זה ואני מתחיל לפרש הענינים בפרט בפסוקים בעזרת השם</strong> \"ויעבור אברם בארץ עד מקום שכם\" -

The sign of that blessing was demonstrated via the dry land appearing in the midst of the waters both at the beginning of the Creation and at the splitting of the Red Sea.), it actually began with Adam HaRishon and his descendants in connection with Rosh HaShanah as pointed out from VaYikra Rabbah 29:1 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בחדש השביעי באחד לחדש - הדא הוא דכתיב (תהלים קיט): לעולם ה' דברך נצב בשמים. תני, בשם ר' אלעזר: בכ\"ה באלול נברא העולם. ואתיא דרב כההיא דתני ר' אלעזר דתנינן: בתקיעתא דרב זה היום תחלת מעשיך זכרון ליום ראשון כי חוק לישראל הוא וגו'. ועל המדינות בו יאמר איזו לחרב ואיזו לשלום איזו לרעב ואיזו לשובע ובריות בו יפקדו להזכירם לחיים ולמות. נמצאת אתה אומר: ביום ר\"ה, בשעה ראשונה, עלה במחשבה. בשניה, נתייעץ עם מלאכי השרת. בשלישי, כנס עפרו. ברביעי, גבלו. בחמישי, רקמו בששי, עשאו גולם. בשביעי, נפח בו נשמה. בשמיני, הכניסו לגן. בתשיעי, נצטוה. בעשירי, עבר. באחד עשר, נידון. בשנים עשר, יצא בדימוס. <strong>אמר הקדוש ברוך הוא לאדם: זה סימן לבניך</strong> מה אתה נכנסת לפני בדין ונתתי לך דימיס, אף בניך נכנסין לפני בדין ואני נותן להם דימיס. אימתי בראש השנה, בחדש השביעי באחד לחדש:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is also worth pointing out that from the Jewish viewpoint, it is not only the males that we follow, meaning Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaacov, but we also follow the acts of their wives (<em>husband and wife are considered as one</em>) like is expressed in Bereshit Rabbah 60:5 which says in regard to Rivkah from Bereshit 24:16:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ותרד העינה ותמלא כדה ותעל כל הנשים יורדות וממלאות מן העין, וזו כיון שראו אותה המים, מיד עלו. <strong>אמר לה הקב\"ה: את סימן לבניך</strong>, מה את, כיון שראו אותך המים מיד עלו, אף בניך כיון שהבאר רואה אותן, מיד תהיה עולה. הה\"ד (במדבר כא): אז ישיר ישראל את השירה הזאת עלי באר ענו בה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In that context, if you were trying to find a legal term to describe this category of action and to what degree it is binding, it would seem to fall under the domain of <em>Dat Yehudit</em> as is discussed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/8573.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en&p3=Mishnah_Ketubot.7&lang3=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Ketubot 7:6</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואלו יוצאות שלא בכתבה, <strong>העוברת על דת משה ויהודית</strong> .ואיזו היא דת משה, מאכילתו שאינו מעשר , ומשמשתו נדה, ולא קוצה לה חלה, ונודרת ואינה מקימת .<strong>ואיזוהי דת יהודית</strong>, יוצאה וראשה פרוע , וטווה בשוק, ומדברת עם כל אדם.אבא שאול אומר, אף המקללת יולדיו בפניו.רבי טרפון אומר, אף הקולנית.ואיזו היא קולנית, לכשהיא מדברת בתוך ביתה ושכניה שומעין קולה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

See talmud-gemara Sanhedrin 102a where Yehu King of Israel spoke evil of himself and that evil befell him:</p>\n\n<p>ויהוא לא שמר ללכת בתורת ה' אלהי ישראל בכל לבבו לא סר מעל חטאת ירבעם אשר החטיא את ישראל - \"And Yehu wasn't carefull to go in the way of Hashem with all his heart, He did not stay away from the sin of Yerovom that he had caused Israel to sin (i.e worship the 2 golden calves as a replacement of the Beis hamikdash)\" (Melachim 2 10 30), מאי גרמא ליה אמר אביי ברית כרותה לשפתים שנאמר What caused this sin? Says Abaye The covenant to the mouth. i.e not to say something bad about oneself as it says:. (Melachim 2, 10, 18) וַיִּקְבֹּץ יֵהוּא, אֶת-כָּל-הָעָם, וַיֹּאמֶר אֲלֵהֶם, אַחְאָב עָבַד אֶת-הַבַּעַל מְעָט; יֵהוּא יַעַבְדֶנּוּ הַרְבֵּה.- And Yehu gathered all the people and said to them \"Achav served the Baal idol a bit, Yehu will serve it a lot\"</p>\n\n<p>See also talmud-bavli Moed Kattan where Shmuel also spoke ill of his brother Pinchas and was chastised for his words became fulfilled for the demise of Pinchas.</p>\n\n<p>פנחס אחוה דמר שמואל איתרע ביה מילתא על שמואל למישאל טעמא מיניה חזנהו לטופרי דהוו נפישן אמר ליה אמאי לא שקלת להו אמר ליה אי בדידיה הוה מי מזלזלת ביה כולי האי הואי (קהלת י, ה) כשגגה שיוצא מלפני השליט ואיתרע ביה מילתא בשמואל על פנחס אחוה למישאל טעמא מיניה שקלינהו לטופריה חבטינהו לאפיה אמר ליה לית לך ברית כרותה לשפתים</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara then further explains in the name of Rabbi Yochanan that the \"Covenent of the Lips\" can also benifit someone if he speaks of good tidings in the future which may be fulfilled Like when Avraham (Bereishit 22,5) said he would return with Yitzchak and it actually happened that they both survived and returned,even though Yitzchak was supposed to be sacrificed.</p>\n\n<p>דאמר ר' יוחנן מנין שברית כרותה לשפתים שנאמר (בראשית כב, ה) ויאמר אברהם אל נעריו שבו לכם פה עם החמור ואני והנער נלכה עד כה ונשתחוה ונשובה אליכם ואיסתייעא מלתא דהדור תרוייהו</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is indeed a Torah source for this idea.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Of every clean animal you shall take seven pairs, males and their\n  mates, <strong>and of every animal that is not clean</strong>, two, a male and its\n  mate (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.7.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit (Genesis) 7:2</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why does the Torah write \"every animal that is not clean\" instead of \"every unclean animal\"? The question is even stronger when you know that many laws are derived from the addition or omission of a single letter - and here we find 8 extra Hebrew letters.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.3a.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 3a</a>) answers</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: <strong>A person should never express a crude\n  matter</strong>, as the formulation of a verse was distorted by the addition of\n  eight letters rather than have it express a crude matter, as it is\n  stated: “From the pure animals and from the animals that are not pure\n  [asher einena tehora]” (Genesis 7:8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A similar story is told (see <a href=\"https://torah.org/learning/integrity-cleanspeech/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Someone once informed the Chazon Ish [a great 20th century rabbi] that a person was a liar. The\n  Chazon Ish immediately rebuked the one who spoke to him: “<strong>That is no\n  way to speak about someone.

The first half of the passuk refers to a descendant of each Shimon and Levi, who stirred up trouble for Klal Yisrael. Why does Yaakov not want to be associated with them? Because, as Rashi explains further,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>כי באפם הרגו איש</strong> - אלו חמור ואנשי שכם, ואינן חשובין כלם אלא כאיש אחד [...] ופשוטו, אנשים הרבה קורא איש, כל אחד לעצמו, באפם הרגו כל איש שכעסו עליו [...] <strong>וברצונם עקרו שור</strong> - רצו לעקר את יוסף שנקרא שור, שנאמר ״בכור שורו הדר לו.״</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>For in their anger, they killed a man</strong> - these are Chamor and the people of Shechem, who were not considered any more important than a single person [...] Its simple explanation is many people are called \"a man,\" each one individually; in their anger, they killed any man who angered him [...] <strong>and in their whim, they maimed an ox</strong> - they wanted to uproot Yosef, who is called an ox, as it says, \"the firstborn ox is a glory to him.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is the connection between these two parts of the passuk? Why does their annihilating the city of Shechem and wanting to kill Yosef lead to Zimri and Korach, and Yaakov's not wanting to associate his name with them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>According to the חומש רש''י המבואר (which is a compialation of different meforshim on rashi)  footnote נו that (loosley translated) that you are forced to say the whole pasuk is basically Yakov apology/excuse that he shouldn't be  associated  the ideas of shimon and levi, but since some of the Pasuk is written in the future tense it must be hinting to future events (of desendents of shimon and levi that yaakov doesn't either want to be associated with).</p>\n\n\n",

Preferably include the hour, or at least day, during which each thing happened. </p>\n\n<p>Other than for facts about which all meforshim agree, please provide sources (or better yet, a single source).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>What a wonderful and high gain question!</p>\n<p>The creation of <em>man</em>, meaning Adam HaRishon, was on the morning of the sixth day of <em>the six days of Creation</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.26-31?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:26-31</a>). (<em>The creation of Adam HaRishon was only after the passing  of the twelve hours of night on the sixth day like is found in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20173&st=&pgnum=40&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Chemdat Yamim to Bereshit 5:1</a> and also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.38b.2?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 38b in the name of Rabbi Yochanan bar Chanina</a>. That days in the Torah begin with the dark of night, like it says in Bereshit 1:5, “<strong>…and there was evening and there was morning, one day</strong>”.</em>)</p>\n<p>It began at the first hour of daylight and was completed in the seventh hour of daylight of that same day.</p>\n<p>This was the point when Adam and Chava were married. That at this point, they both existed as separate individuals and were joined as mates in a pair bond like is expressed in tractate <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.62b.12?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 62b-63a</a> starting with Rabbi Tanchum and concluding with Rabbi Elazar who says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any man who does not have a wife is not a man, as it is stated: “Male and female He created them…and called their name Adam” (Genesis 5:2)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A very significant detail of Rabbi Elazar’s comment concerns the usage of the term <em>Adam</em> (אדם), which as used in the beginning of Bereshit has multiple different meanings (like for example, <strong>Adam</strong> אדם in the sense of <em>dust from <strong>the earth</strong></em> מן האדמה and also <em>Similar</em> to G-d, above דומה לעליון).</p>\n<p>Abarbanel in his commentary to Bereshit explains that it can also mean either the <em>entire species of modern man</em>, or <em>a particular individual human</em> being, or it can appear as <em>the personal name of the individual</em> in this narrative (See ב<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14387&st=&pgnum=131&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ראשית ד, קלב ד״ה האמנם בדרך וכו׳</a> and also <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14387&st=&pgnum=133\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שם ה, קלד-ה ד״ה זה ספר תולדות אדם וכו׳</a>).</p>\n<p>Properly comprehending the meaning of the written text of the Torah is dependent upon knowing which meanings apply for each expression.</p>\n<p>Their first consumation (<em>physical relations</em>) between Adam and his wife was in the eighth hour of daylight on the sixth day of Creation.</p>\n<p>This is enumerated in many places within the literature of the Torah, but a good single source to reference, which cites many other sources is <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46817&st=&pgnum=40&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder HaDorot, First Millennium</a>.</p>\n<p>At this point it is important to note that these <em>Days of Creation</em> are counted according to <em>G-dly time</em>, like we learn from Moshe Rabbeinu in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.90.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 90:4</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thousand years are in Your eyes like a day of yesteryear that has passed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the first seven days of Creation (the six days of the week and the first Shabbat), time is counted like we count time currently, in this world.</p>\n<p>In this context (meaning specifically as the paradigm relates to the creation of Adam HaRishon), the first week mentioned at the beginning of the Torah spans 7000 years in our current timeframe. Each hour of a 24 hour day during that first week account for approximately 41.6 years as we currently count.</p>\n<p>(<em>It is important to note that the paradigm of the narrative in Bereshit also applies simultaneously to the Creation of the entire Universe.</em>)</p>\n<p>The best way to conceive of this is in terms of the concept of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">time dilation</a></em> like is discussed in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity</a>. <a href=\"https://www.mayimachronim.com/torah-on-the-big-bang-and-the-age-of-the-universe/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A good discussion of this subject in relation to traditional Torah teachings can be found here</a>.</p>\n<p>The effect of time dilation is manifest either by approaching the speed of light, called <em>relative velocity time dilation</em> or by close proximity to a great mass, called <em>gravitational time dilation</em>.</p>\n<p>Absent any mention of Adam HaRishon being accelerated to the speed of light, the other possibility would be proximity to great mass.</p>\n<p>This enters into the subject of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dark matter <em>and</em> dark energy</a></em>. It is present everywhere and accounts for approximately 80% of the mass of the universe. But its effect on material existence as we experience it is usually almost undetectable.</p>\n<p>The primary evidence of Dark Matter today is the presence of <em>Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</em>. By this description, dark matter seems to align with the concept of the Lamp of Darkness (בוצינא דקרדינותא) mentioned in the the commentary Mikdash Melech,  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mikdash_Melekh_on_Zohar.1.15a.6-12?vhe=Zholkva,_1864&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:15a:6-12</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Bereshit.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar, Bereshit 15a</a>.</p>\n<p>That the <em>Lamp <em><strong>(meaning the source)</strong></em> of Darkness</em> refers to the moment at the beginning of Creation just prior to the first manifestation of Light in the Created Universe in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.2-5?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:2-5</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the description given by the <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/Cosmic_Microwave_Background_CMB_radiation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">European Space Agency</a>, at this point light and matter were inseparable meaning so closely bound because of the extreme heat that atoms were unable to <em>coagulate</em> allowing empty space, so light could not radiate. Therefore the entire universe was opaque, meaning dark and black (the Lamp of Darkness).</p>\n<p>As the universe cooled, atoms began to coagulate (צמצום) allowing light to begin to manifest everywhere, like is described on the first day of Creation, light without a light source that is everywhere (יהי אור ויהי אור). That first light is still observable today and is called Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.</p>\n<p>This paradigm of cooling, coagulation and manifestation of light is actually described by the fourth Lubavitcher Rebbe, known as the Maharash, in a quote from him, explaining the meaning of the word <em>Kavod</em>, for <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/hayomyom.asp?tdate=3/27/2023\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the fifth day of Nisan in the book, HaYom Yom</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אאזמו\"ר [אדוני אבי זקני מורי ורבי] אמר במרז\"ל [במאמר רבותינו זכרונם לברכה] לא מקומו של אדם מכבדו אלא אדם מכבד את מקומו, <strong>כבוד יש בו שני פירושים</strong>: לשון כבדא כמרז\"ל [כמאמר רבותינו זכרונם לברכה] <strong>כבד לב פרעה</strong> נעשה לבו ככבד. <strong>ולשון כבוד, גילוי אור מקיף נעלה</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That <em>Kavod</em>, Glory (as used by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.6.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 6:3</a>, the whole world is filled with His Glory, just like Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation) has a meaning like <em>liver</em>, which is cold and coagulates (<em>thickens blood</em>) and also a meaning of the <em>revelation of highly Sublime, <strong>all encompassing light</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>This concept of time dilation also relates to the statement found within Torah teaching that the distance from the earth to the <em>Rakia</em> is 500 years Chagigah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.12a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">12a</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.13a.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">13a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.9.1.13?vhe=The_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Brachot 9:1:13</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.94b.2?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Punctuated_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 94b</a>).</p>\n<p>This concept reveals one of the underlying paradigms of the whole of Creation. It is the underpinning to the union and <em>oneness</em> of the spiritual with the physical, the seven Heavens and the earth, male and female, and husband and wife.</p>\n<p>That this union is the source of life and is the underlying meaning of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.14.21?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BeMidbar 14:21</a></p>\n<p>which states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאוּלָ֖ם חַי־אָ֑נִי וְיִמָּלֵ֥א כְבוֹד־יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶת־כׇּל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before (meaning <em>prior to</em>) <strong>everything</strong>, <em><strong>I am life</strong></em> and <em>the glory of G-d fills the whole world</em>.</p>\n<p>Ultimately it is a statement that <strong>G-d is one</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <em>Nachash</em> was among the land dwelling creatures that were created during the 12 hours  of night during the sixth day like is stated in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.24?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:24</a> or possibly in the fifth day pertaining to the <em>Taninim</em> (תנינים) like is mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.20-23?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:20-23</a>.</p>\n<p>This second possibility follows what is mentioned in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20173&st=&pgnum=23&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Chemdat Yamim to Bereshit 1:21</a>. It also seems to be the understanding of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.12.3-4?lang=he&with=Navigation&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni to Bereshit 12:3-4</a> which says the Taninim are also called <em>Leviatan-Nachash</em> and emphasizes that they were called Taninim because they do not have a mate. (<em>Which would lead to its extinction.</em>)</p>\n<p>The wording of Chemdat Yamim cited above also indicates the nature of the relationship between the Nachash and Adam HaRishon, meaning the modern human species as a whole.</p>\n<p>It establishes the paradigm of the Animal (<em>Animating</em>) <strong>Soul</strong> (<strong>נפש</strong> הבהמי׳) and the G-dly <strong>Soul</strong> (נפש אלוקי׳ היינו <strong>נשמה</strong>) which in kabbalistic nomenclature is also called the <em>Soul of Intellect</em> (נפש השכלי׳) and (<em>which has no ability to interact with the material world directly</em>). That the Animating Soul is the intermediary between the material existence and G-dly/Spiritual existence. And this is in keeping with the wording of the Alter Rebbe at the <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49432&st=&pgnum=14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">end of chapter 1 in the Tanya, section Likkutei Amarim, beginning with the words, \"אך ביאור הענין על פי מ״ש רח״ו ז״ל וגו׳\" and the beginning of chapter 2</a>.</p>\n<p>The creation of the Nachash preceded the creation of Adam HaRishon which began  with the first hour of daylight on the sixth day like is enumerated many sources like <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46817&st=&pgnum=40&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder HaDorot at the beginning of the first millennium</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.11.6-7?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer 11:6-7</a>.</p>\n<p>The Nachash is a type of <em>proto-human being</em> (it was intelligent, could speak and walk upright) that preceded in the order of the creation before Adam HaRishon.</p>\n<p>In an archeological sense it relates to any of the pre-Cro Magnon proto-humans, like Homo Erectus, Homo Heidelbergensis, Homo Floresiensis, Denisovans, Neanderthal and other subsumed human sub-species.</p>\n<p>This follows the language of Yedidyah HaKohen of Alexandria, also known as Philon (Philo) of Alexandria in his discussion of the giants to Bereshit 6:1. (See Kitvei Philon, Mosad Bialik edition, volume 4, part 2, pg.11, where he discusses <em>our species</em> of human being in contrast to the species related to the <em>giants</em> mentioned in the Torah.</p>\n<p>These proto-humans are generally described as the ten branches  of <em>pre-Adamic</em> peoples, specifically: קיני, קניזי, קדמוני, כנעני, אמרי, חתי, פרצי, חוי, יבוסי ורפאים</p>\n<p>These ten sub-species of proto-humans occupied ten different lands around the globe. In particular, the <em>Nachash</em> was from the branch known as Chivi (חוי) like is discussed by <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42660&st=&pgnum=20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shlomo Molcho in Sefer HaMefoar</a> (ספר  המפואר,דרוש עשר ארצות כנגד עשר ספירות ד״ה דע כי שם חוי הוא נחש כתרגומו וכו׳). This also follows Targum Onkelos to Bereshit 3:1 which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וְחִוְיָא</strong> הֲוָה חַכִּים מִכֹּל חֵוַת בְּרָא דִּי עֲבַד יְיָ אֱלֹהִים וַאֲמַר לְאִתְּתָא בְּקוּשְׁטָא אֲרֵי אֲמַר יְיָ לָא תֵיכְלוּן מִכֹּל אִילַן גִּינְתָא:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These proto-humans are also referenced in the Torah (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.13.33?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BeMidbar 13:33</a>) as <em>giants</em> (ענקים), physically larger than modern humans or Nefilim (נפילים) from the root הפל which linguistically relates to a miscarried fetus. The idea being that these branches of proto-humans will ultimately fail and become extinct or be subsumed by modern humans through interbreeding with the descendants of Adam (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.6.4?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 6:4</a>). In this context, it is worth noting that there are still genetic traces of these proto-humans in a small portion of the human population today.</p>\n<p>As Rabbi Molcho explains, the branch of the Chivi sub-divided into further branches which were called the Girgashites and the Refo'im.</p>\n<p>These proto-humans are all enumerated in Torah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.15.18?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 15:18-21</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.2.11?lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 2:11</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.2.20?lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 2:20</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.3.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 3:11</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.3.13?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 3:13</a> among other places in Tanach.</p>\n<p>In this context, the subject mentioned in Midrash and Zohar of Chava being seduced and impregnated by the <em>Nachash</em> has an entirely new and deeper meaning. That she was impregnated and possibly raped by this proto-human at about the same time as the first conception between Adam and Chava (something alluded to in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.23.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim, chapter 23</a> which recalls Chava collecting food in preparation for the first Shabbat) and that the first two children (Kayin and Hevel), or at least one of them (Kayin) were actually from the seed of the proto-human. This follows the view of <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20173&st=&pgnum=36&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Chemdat Yamim to Bereshit 4:1</a> that begins, \"And Adam knew Chava, his wife...\".</p>\n<p>To understand this correctly in terms of the human genetics, it would mean that Kayin and Hevel because they had such widely different traits were <a href=\"https://www.verywellfamily.com/facts-about-fraternal-twins-2447159\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fraternal twins</a>, meaning conceived from two different eggs (Chava hyper-ovulated) and two different sperm, that of Adam and that of the Nachash.</p>\n<p>This is also supported in the midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaYashar_(midrash)%2C_Book_of_Genesis%2C_Bereshit.10?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Yashar to Bereshit discussing the killing of Kayin by Lemech</a> many years later. It says that Tuval Kayin who was helping his grandfather Lemech hunt, misidentified Kayin at a distance, who looked not like a human being, but like a wild animal meaning a proto-human.</p>\n<p>In the ninth hour of daylight of the sixth day of Creation, Adam was given his commandments and in the tenth hour the transgression took place, meaning <em>eating from the tree</em>.</p>\n<p>In the eleventh hour of that day was their judgement by G-d.</p>\n<p>Finally, in the twelfth hour of that day, they were sent from Gan Eden to Kedem (<em>note that Seder HaDorot cited above says they went out to the people, meaning the proto-humans</em>), which in this world corresponds to Beit Shean in the Jordan River valley. (<em>See also VaYikra Rabba 29:1, Pesikta d’Rav Kahana 23:1 and Zohar, BeShalach 16:232</em>)</p>\n<p>This <em>Upper world/State of Existence</em> concept, that there are upper worlds which parallel this lower world, also relates back to the concept of time dilation mentioned above.</p>\n<p>That there are universes on different <em>energy levels</em> or <em>spiritual levels</em> which are all bound by the same paradigms of the Creator. This is associated with the <a href=\"https://fractalfoundation.org/resources/what-are-fractals/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">concept of fractalization</a>. Everything which exists in the lower realm, comes from and is a consequence of its parallel in the higher realm. But what is perceived from one level to the next is not the same.</p>\n<p>This can be understood in the context of the light receptors in the human eye. Human beings in this world generally perceive the visible light spectrum. But there are other ranges outside of the visible spectrum, both higher and lower which the human eye does not detect. They are constantly present and may even effect us yet are not perceived with our eyes.</p>\n<p>This parallel land, where they were created is called Eldah (אלדה) in <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/he/books/NNL_ALEPH990019643800205171/NLI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaYovelim, Bereshit, end of chapter 3</a> 3:32 which relates linguistically to <em>the land of their birth</em>.</p>\n<p>This sequence is also how it is recounted in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21858&st=&pgnum=85\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 11:27-47</a>.</p>\n<p>The first Shabbat is also explained there. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21858&st=&pgnum=121\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 20:1-13</a> How G-d kept the first Shabbat while Adam and Chava were in a transitional state outside of time.</p>\n<p>It goes on to explain in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21858&st=&pgnum=122\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 20:14-23</a> that G-d provided light for Adam to say the first havdalah at the close of the first Shabbat.</p>\n<p>Like is recounted in <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46817&st=&pgnum=41\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder HaDorot</a>, it was at this time, starting on the night of motzi Shabbat, following that first Shabbat, that Adam separated from Chava in this world for 130 years as part of the avodah of his teshuvah. This follows the teaching of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.18b.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Meir in Eruvin 18b</a> and is also detailed  in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21858&st=&pgnum=125\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 20:29-38</a>.</p>\n<p>Even more detail about this episode can be found in the beginning of <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35003&st=&pgnum=5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Raziel which is also called Sefer Toldot Adam Kadmon</a> (beginning with Adam's first three days of prayer, see זה תפלת אדם הראשון כו׳).</p>\n<p>That similar to the behavior of the Jewish people at Har Sinai in their preparation for receiving the Torah, higher states of kedusha and taharah are required, including the separation of husband and wife, in preparation for intimacy like is described in Shemot <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.19.14-15?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">19:14-15</a>.</p>\n<p>It should be noted in regard to this 130 year separation that it is a measure for measure judgement from G-d on Adam relating specifically to the sin he transgressed.</p>\n<p>That Adam added to G-d's commandment concerning eating the fruit from the tree of Knowledge of Good and its opposite like is found in Bereshit 2:16-17 which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְצַו֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים עַל־הָֽאָדָ֖ם לֵאמֹ֑ר מִכֹּ֥ל עֵֽץ־הַגָּ֖ן אָכֹ֥ל תֹּאכֵֽל׃\nוּמֵעֵ֗ץ הַדַּ֙עַת֙ ט֣וֹב וָרָ֔ע לֹ֥א תֹאכַ֖ל מִמֶּ֑נּוּ כִּ֗י בְּי֛וֹם אֲכׇלְךָ֥ מִמֶּ֖נּוּ מ֥וֹת תָּמֽוּת׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following the giving of this commandment to Adam HaRishon, G-d <em>built</em> a mate for Adam from a part of Adam's body. That mate was to be named Chaya, as in the source (Mother) of all life (Bereshit 3:20). But her name was changed to Chava, meaning the source of <em>culpability</em>, his wife. (Regarding this letter transformation of Yud and Vav, see the commentary of Radak to Bereshit 32:31-32)</p>\n<p>But Chava had not been built and was not present when G-d gave Adam HaRishon his commandments. She was taught this knowledge by her husband, Adam, who added to G-d's (<em>negative</em>) commandment like is seen in Bereshit 3:2-3, where she recounts to the Nachash what her husband had taught her was G-d's commandment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתֹּ֥אמֶר הָֽאִשָּׁ֖ה אֶל־הַנָּחָ֑שׁ מִפְּרִ֥י עֵֽץ־הַגָּ֖ן נֹאכֵֽל׃\nוּמִפְּרִ֣י הָעֵץ֮ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּתוֹךְ־הַגָּן֒ אָמַ֣ר אֱלֹהִ֗ים <strong>לֹ֤א תֹֽאכְלוּ֙ מִמֶּ֔נּוּ וְלֹ֥א תִגְּע֖וּ בּ֑וֹ פֶּן־תְּמֻתֽוּן׃</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That Adam added to G-d's prohibition when teaching his wife (<em>even though it is suggested that he was only building a fence to avoid an accidental transgression by his wife</em>), a transgression enumerated in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.10.1?lang=he&with=Rambam&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam's commentary to Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:1 enumerating the 13 Foundations of Jewish Law</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>היסוד התשיעי</strong>\nההעתק והוא <strong>כי התורה הזאת</strong> מועתקת מאת הבורא הש\"י לא מזולתו <strong>ועליה אין להוסיף וממנה אין לגרוע לא בתורה שבכתב ולא בתורה שבעל פה</strong> שנאמר לא תוסיף עליו ולא תגרע ממנו וכבר בארנו מה שצריך לבאר ביסוד זה בפתיחת זה החבור:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That the judgement that Adam should separate from his wife for 130 years corresponds to what Adam added to G-d's commandment, \"וְלֹ֥א תִגְּע֖וּ בּ֑וֹ <strong>פֶּן</strong>־תְּמֻתֽוּן׃\n\".</p>\n<p>That the Hebrew word, <em>lest</em> (פן), has a gematria of 130. And that this is associated to the connection of <em>Heaven</em> and Earth (meaning Husband and Wife, that Adam is from the Earth and Chava, his wife is from Heaven. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 2:7</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.39a.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 39a</a>) like is hinted at by the ladder (סלם) of Yaacov's dream <em>whose head reached to Heaven and whose foot rested upon the Earth</em> (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.28.12?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 28:12</a>) and the location (Mount Sinai) where the Torah was given (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.19.11?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 19:11</a> סיני). <em>Literally described as the joining of Heaven and Earth</em>. That these Hebrew words all have a gematria of 130.</p>\n<p>That through Adam adding to G-d's commandment, he had diminished the revelation of G-d's presence in the world and caused a separation, so to speak. Adam made this separation through his speech and this precipitated the actions between the Nachash and his wife and the events which followed it including his separating from his wife for 130 years after that first Shabbat. At the conclusion of that process of Teshuva, he and his wife were blessed by G-d and given a new son (שת) to replace their son (הבל) and to preserve his species (אדם).</p>\n<p>Concerning the birth of Kayin and Hevel, as contrasted to the time of their conception (which was in the eighth hour of the sixth day of the six days of Creation), their birth was much later. Kayin was born in the 65th year following that first Shabbat and Hevel was born in the 72nd year. They also had a sister named Avone, who would later become the wife of Kayin, who was born in the 93rd year after that first Shabbat. Kayin murdered Hevel in the 100th year after that first Shabbat. All this is recorded in <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/he/books/NNL_ALEPH990019643800205171/NLI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaYovelim, beginning of chapter 4:1-3</a>.</p>\n<p>This is also discussed in the commentary of Don Yitzchok Abarbanel to Bereshit, cited above.</p>\n<p>Abarbanel brings this in the name of the author of יוסיפון in his other book called ספר הקדמוניות. This text of יוסיפון  is also mentioned and partially copied in Me'ir Einayim by Azarya ben Moshe DiRossi of Edom (<em>Rome</em>), who says it is based on an earlier book called ספר העתים which was written by Philo of Alexandria.</p>\n<p>This tradition attributed to Philo (<em>also known as Yedidyah HaKohen, the leader of the Jewish community in Alexandria in Egypt and who actually records his travels to the Temple in Jerusalem while it was still operating, places him chronologically at the time of the Tannaim, 1000 years before the Abarbanel.</em>) actually originates from Sefer HaYovelim.</p>\n<p>Sefer HaYovelim is counted among the <em>Sifrei Chitzonim</em>. But the beginning of this book states that it was written by Moshe Rabbeinu at G-d's command at Har Sinai. That Moshe was to write the history from the beginning of the Creation divided into Yovelim. Remnants of this tradition are also found in Sefer Yashar. The Jews of Ethiopia (Beta Yisroel) also preserved this tradition. But most surprisingly, with the discovery of the scrolls from the Qumran community (the Essenes), the near complete text of Sefer HaYovelim has been found in the original Hebrew. In this context, it is worth noting that Philo writes about the Essene community in his other works. He was familiar with their teachings.</p>\n<p>To recap, Sefer HaYovelim 4:2 says that Kayin murdered Hevel at the beginning of the third Yovel, meaning 100 years after the exile of Adam and Chava from Gan Eden, like the Abarbanel states in his commentary cited above.</p>\n<p>This means that Kayin would have been 35 years old and Hevel would have been 28 years old. It is in connection with the murder that there are additional indications that Kayin and Hevel were actually born after departure from Gan Eden like is mentioned above.</p>\n<p>Midrash HaGadol to Bereshit 4:13 recounts the details of G-d's interaction with Kayin following the murder. That G-d was trying to lead Kayin through the process of Teshuvah. This is detailed even more in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Aggadah%2C_Genesis.4.8.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Agadah, Bereshit 4:8-9</a>.</p>\n<p>It is clear that Kayin was unaware of knowledge of G-d, like his father and mother possessed from when they were in Gan Eden. This would be the consequence that he had been conceived in Gan Eden but wasn't actually born until much later, in this world, when G-d's presence was greatly concealed.</p>\n<p>It goes on to bring out that even though Kayin's Teshuvah was accepted by G-d, it was not complete Teshuvah (תשובה גמורה) and for this reason required that Kayin go into exile from the land where his father and mother resided.</p>\n<p>It goes on to explain in Sefer HaYovelim chapter 4:7 that Adam and Chava mourned the murder of Hevel for 28 years, and in the thirty-second year after Hevel's murder, Adam rejoiced (possibly over the completion of his teshuvah and the period of his separation from his wife) and conceived a second time with his wife from which was born a son who was called Shet (שת). It adds that in the 36th year after the murder of Hevel, a daughter named Azura was born to Adam and Chava.</p>\n<p>It continues and explains that Kayin married his sister Avone, who gave birth to his first child, Chanoch, 200 years after the exile and expulsion of Adam and Chava from Gan Eden.</p>\n<p>You have also asked about the other descendants of Kayin and on this subject it is worth noting the discussion of this subject in Philo in his commentary of the Torah mentioned above. Philo suggests, based on the grammar of the text that the <em>additional offspring</em> from Kayin are not actual human beings, but paradigms for negative human behavior which leads to extinction from this world.</p>\n<p>This is also the emphasis from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Aggadah%2C_Genesis.4.8.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Agadah, Bereshit 4:17-18</a>. Perhaps this points to extinct or subsumed proto-humans discussed above in regard to Bereshit 6:4. This is also referenced in Sefer HaYovelim 4:22 which refers to these proto-humans as <em>Irim</em> (העירים).</p>\n<p>And finally, in Sefer HaYovelim 4:29-32 it records that Adam died 930 years after the six days of Creation and the first Shabbat. It relates this to the idea that 1000 years are like a single day in relation to the testimony of Heaven (Sefer HaYovelim 4:30 and Tehillim 90:4) and that this reveals the meaning of Bereshit 2:17 which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>but from the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat of it; for <strong>on the day</strong> that you eat of it, <strong>you shall die</strong>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in the year after Adam died, Kayin was killed (by Lemech). But Sefer HaYovelim says that the buildings which Kayin had built collapsed and the stones from the collapsing buildings which struck him, killed him, measure for measure like he had done to his brother Hevel. Once again, this alludes back to the names of Kayin's descendants (the letters (<em>also of names</em>) are called stones) mentioned above in the name of Midrash Agadah, in particular Irad (עירד) which means <em>to crumble</em> from the world.</p>\n<p>So the chronological order of the events listed in your question is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The creation of the Nachash.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The creation of Man, meaning Adam HaRishon.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and its opposite.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Expulsion from Gan Eden.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The first Shabbat</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Disappearance of the original Gan Eden and Tree of Life.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Adam separates from Chava and his process of teshuva begins.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The birth of Kayin and Hevel.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The murder of Hevel (With G-d's judgement and Kayin's turning from G-d, meaning he becomes a wanderer following the murder of his brother, his process of teshuva begins.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The birth of Shet (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Olam_Rabbah.1.2?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%90%D7%93%D7%9D&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam Rabbah 1 with the commentary of the Vilna Gaon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Olam_Zutta.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam Zuta 2:1</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The birth of Kayin's first child, Chanoch.

One is from Sefer Yashar which recounts the hunting accident with Lemech and Tuval Kayin.

    "content": "# Were there prophets who could “see” the past?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophets_in_Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>, Judaism holds that there were 48 males prophets and 7 female prophetesses mentioned by name in Tenakh, counting ONLY the Jewish ones. (Judaism recognizes that there were many other Jewish prophets as well as prophets among all the nations, Balaam one of the most famous of them). </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/84902/jewish/What-is-Prophecy.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a> states that a “prophet is an individual who receives a message from G‑d to transmit to the people”. Sometimes, a prophet can foretell the future. </p>\n\n<p>My question is, does the Torah (or other sources of Jewish tradition such as the Talmud) identify and discuss people who did—I suppose one way of putting it—-the exact OPPOSITE of prophecy? Namely, “see” the past (maybe even past lives) unveiling unknown events and knowledge in order to guide people in the present? I hesitate using the term “past live regression” as that is done by placing an individual under the state of hypnosis. I also hesitate using the term “psychic” which has negative connotations. Quite frankly, I have NO idea what call the phenomenon if it exists at all!</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that if there were prophets who could foresee the future, there had to be those who could see into the past as well, not only in the context of gilguls but past events that were known by few if any. Revealing secret meaning to a known event might also qualify. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Note that the definition of <em>prophecy</em> that you quote is <em>a prophet is an individual who receives a message from G‑d to transmit to the people</em>. This means that if the message involves the past, the present <strong>or</strong> the future, it would still be a valid message. Examples in the Torah would include the events that involved Par'o and his servants when Moshe was not present to hear them as well as the conversations between Balak and Bil'am. Similarly, the events written in Shoftim before Shmuel haNavi was born could be of this type. Another example is the entire Book of Ruth. A specific example can be found in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15838#v=20&showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I Shmuel 9:20</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And concerning the she-asses which are lost to you, (and you have\n  sought them as of) today, three days, do not take them to heart, for\n  they have been found; and to whom does all that is desirable in Israel\n  belong? Is it not to you and to your father's house?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It should be recognized that most prophetic oracles are not \"foretelling\" oracles, but rather \"forthtelling,\" i.e. speaking an uncomfortable truth to the prescribed audience, usually to a powerful authority; e.g. Nathan's warnings to King David in Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles (especially 2 Samuel 7:2-17, 12:1-25) or Yonah's warnings to Nineveh. The latter generally presented the behavior in which the recipient of the oracle was engaging, and what Hashem's historic (past) reaction to it had been. Projecting Divine responses from the past onto present behaviors predicts future consequences. In that sense, prophets \"see the past\" throughout the Nevi'im. This approach worked because Hashem Himself said that He does not change (Malakhi 3:6). </p>\n\n<p>The intent of prophecy is almost always to change current behaviors of those being addressed. There must be a message to the original audience, or what is the point of delivering to that specific audience rather than to an audience 500 or 1000 years later? The purpose is to correct the path of an individual, a nation, or a society. Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote in his classic tome <em>The Prophets</em> (New York: Harper, 1962), \"All prophecy is one great exclamation: God is not indifferent to evil!\" (p. 365).</p>\n\n<p>In philosophical Kabbalah, the concept of the gilgul is for the purpose that the individual be given multiple attempts to achieve obedience to all of the positive mitzvot which apply to him or her and successful abstinence from all applicable Torah prohibitions. Its relevance would not extend beyond the individual him or herself. There is nothing I am aware of recording a person being aware of their performance to that end in a past life; the idea is to perform to the best of one's ability in the current life, for one doesn't know whether it is his first chance or his last.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>He saw an Egyptian man ,Exodus 2:12. Moshe saw through divine inspiration what the Egyptian has done to the Jewess in the house I.e. that the Egyptian has committed adultery also that the Egyptian was smiting the Jew in the field because he wanted to kill him. Shemos Rabbah 1:28,29, Eitz Yosef. </p>\n\n<p>It appears that Moshe saw the “past”from my understanding in this matter </p>\n\n\n",

However, I suspect that one should be <em>very</em> cautious about doing so, based on YD 344:1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצוה גדולה להספיד על המת כראוי ומצותו שירים קולו לומר עליו דברים המשברים את הלב כדי להרבות בכיה ולהזכיר שבחו ואסור להפליג בשבחו יותר מדאי אלא מזכירין מדות טובות שבו ומוסיפין בהם קצת רק שלא יפליג ואם לא היו בו מדות טובות כלל לא יזכיר עליו וחכם וחסיד מזכירין להם חכמתם וחסידותם וכל המזכיר על מי שלא היה בו כלל או שמוסיף להפליג יותר מדאי על מה שהיה בו גורם רעה לעצמו ולמת:</p>\n  \n  <p>It is a great mitzvah to eulogize the deceased properly. The mitzvah is to raise his voice, to say about him things which shatter the heart, in order to increase crying, and to recall his praise. It is forbidden to exaggerate his praise too much, more than is necessary; rather, one should mention some of his good attributes and add to them slightly, only that he not exaggerate. If he has no positive attributes, he should not mention about him. A sage or pious person - we recall for them their wisdom and piety. Anyone who recalls regarding one who does not have at all, or one who adds to exaggerate more than is necessary regarding him, he causes evil to himself and to the deceased. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given how important it is that the eulogy be delivered properly, I would posit that, unless it’s absolutely necessary to bring out whatever point the eulogizer is making, one should avoid discussing it in his eulogy.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm assuming that the fact that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.70.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">women are exempt</a> from saying Shema doesn't necessarily imply that if they do end up saying it that they can ignore this halacha. But I could be wrong.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In his book Shorashe Minhag Ashkenaz (vol. 2 pg. 58), <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binyamin_Shlomo_Hamburger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Hamburger</a> brings that the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Elazar_Spira\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minhat Elazar</a> was asked this question and he replied (ME <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1860&st=&pgnum=79&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vol. 2 §28</a>) that since the idea is Zoharic it follows that the reasoning is too and suggests that the limbs to which the amount of words correspond pertain to the spiritual realm and therefore even a woman, whose physical limbs aren’t equal to a male, can still recite the supplementary Shema words. </p>\n\n<p>R. Yitzchak Weiss of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrbov%C3%A9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vrbové</a> also dealt with this query (Siach Yitzchak vol. 1 §29) but offers a more literal approach: The female shares the same essential 248 limbs as the male -indeed the female’s additional limbs <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bekhorot.45a.74?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">do not generate impurity in an enclosed area</a>- and therefore it’s “perhaps good for her to recite the words too” just as we find other examples of females doing/saying things that corresponds to the 248 limbs. (One notable example is the ‘Mi She’berach’ for an ill woman in which the accepted text remains “for all her 248 limbs”.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>I think the answer is far simpler than you assumed.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Zohar does not say we recite Shmah <em>because</em> it has 245 words. The Gemmorah in Berochos discusses how much of Shmah should we read at all, only the first line, one-two or three paragraphs. Therefore reading Shmah is obligatory for both women and men with no connection to the number of words.</p></li>\n<li><p>Shmah can be read in any language, and besides the first Passuk, it can be read even by omitting words, so again 245 is not obligatory.</p></li>\n<li><p>The 3 additional words are not there anyway. So Shmah was not \"designed\" to reflect the body organs, it was the Achronim's idea.</p></li>\n<li><p>The 248 limbs are not real, they are metaphorical. I've already asked a couple of question on that counting, the Mishnah in Ohalot only counts the bones, no muscles, no brains, eyes, and soft tissues etc. Therefore the claim that women have 252 bones is also simply wrong. Read the Gemorah where it arrives at the conclusion that women have more bones than men and you'll see the hoax.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/94941/different-counts-of-the-613-248-organs-bones-or-soft-tissues\">different-counts-of-the-613-248-organs-bones-or-soft-tissues</a>,<br>\nSee: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/95020/women-less-mitzvot-more-body-parts\">women-less-mitzvot-more-body-parts</a>,<br>\nSee: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/94954/how-is-the-male-skeleton-different-from-female\">how-is-the-male-skeleton-different-from-female</a></p>\n\n\n",

As for why the verse would be placed out of order, we could explain simply that it would have been too disruptive to the narrative if placed in its proper chronological place.</p>\n<p>Consider that immediately after this, in verse 32, the Torah states that Leah gave birth to Reuven. The next verses after that list the births of Leah's next three sons. If the Torah would have followed the chronological order it would have to tell us that God saw that Leah was hated and opened her womb, and then interrupt with six verses about marrying Rachel as well, and then return to the narrative of Leah giving birth.

And he said: Do not send\nyour hand to the young man and do not do anything to him, for now I\nknow that you fear G-d, for you did not withhold your son, your only\none, from Me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bereshit 22:15-17</p>\n<p>ויקרא מלאך ה' אל אברהם שנית מן השמים: ויאמר בי נשבעתי נאם ה' כי יען\nאשר עשית את הדבר הזה ולא חשכת את בנך את יחידך: כי ברך אברכך והרבה ארבה את\nזרעך ככוכבי השמים וכחול אשר על שפת הים</p>\n<p>And an angel of Hashem called to Abraham from heaven a second time.\nAnd he said: I have sworn, says Hashem, that because you have done\nthis thing, and you did not withhold your son, your onle one, that I\nshall certainly bless you and certainly increase your offspring like\nthe stars in the sky and like the sand by the seashore, and your\noffspring shall inherit the gates of their enemies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Scriptural text--which is to say, Hashem Himself--praises Abraham as one that fears G-d and promises him tremendous blessing because of his choice to obey G-d rather than follow his own preferences and thoughts.</p>\n<p>So, while I cannot claim the incredibly broad knowledge to say that there is no legitimate and respected source supporting the interpretation here ascribed to Cardozo, I would be absolutely astonished to find it.

A haggadist of the third century, Abba bar Kahana, states (Midr.

He writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A fetus that dies in the womb or is born dead (stillbirth) is called a\n  “nefel,” and no laws of mourning apply. If the baby is born alive, the\n  rules are more complex. Generally, a baby who lives for less than\n  thirty days is in a category of uncertainty and is categorized as a\n  “safek nefel” (even if the baby died from an external cause, such as\n  an accident [Gesher Ha-Chaim 19:3(4)]). <strong>Since Jewish law is lenient\n  when it comes to mourning, one is not obligated to observe the laws of\n  mourning for the death of a baby who dies within thirty days of birth</strong>\n  (Semachot 3:1; Shabbat 136a; Rambam, Hilkhot Avel 1:6; Shulchan Arukh,\n  YD 374:8, all based on Torat Kohanim, Emor 1:6).</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>However, if it is certain that the baby was born after nine full\n  months of gestation</strong> (certainty would require the parents to not have\n  had relations since conceiving nine months prior to the birth), then\n  if the baby is born alive, even if he or she dies that day, the baby\n  is not a “safek nefel,” but rather a “ben kayama”—a “viable” baby, the\n  term normally given to a baby that survives more than thirty days. In\n  this case, <strong>one observes all mourning laws and customs</strong> (Shabbat 136a;\n  Niddah 44b; Rambam, Hilkhot Avel 1:7; Shulchan Arukh YD 374:8), <strong>but\n  not the traditional funeral practices. However, in practice, many are\n  not accustomed to observe the mourning customs in this situation\n  unless the baby survives at least a few days after birth</strong> (Ke-Chalom\n  Ya’uf, 95).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pages 106-107 go deeper on the issue of <strong>shiva (not required) and kaddish</strong> (\"There is no obligation to say Kaddish after the passing of a fetus or baby younger than thirty days, and it is not customary to do so.\")</p>\n\n<p>See the article for the spiritual reasons why this is the case and approaches for dealing with such terrible cases, e.g., see footnote 20 on p. 98 where R Yosef Tzvi Rimon is quoted</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the parents developed a connection to the baby, a funeral or shivah\n  may be recommended to help them cope. (This may apply to saying\n  Kaddish, even for an entire year, since this ritual may have a\n  positive influence on the one saying Kaddish.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>May God comfort all families suffering such a terrible experience. And as with all personal issues, please <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9146/why-is-it-necessary-to-ask-a-rabbi\">ask your rav</a> for any personal ruling.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I asked R Binyamin Tabady this question.

Wikipedia does a good job explaining how it works, and I’ll direct the reader there for the relevant equations and their explanations. </p>\n\n<p>The important part for this question is that Shabbos starts shortly before sunset on Friday evenings. The first places on the globe to accept Shabbos would be just west of the International Date Line (henceforth IDL), and the last places would be just east of the IDL. Further, since the days are shorter and longer at the extremes (leading to the opening sentence of this post), the earliest Shabbos of the year would be at the northernmost place just west of the IDL (i.e. the tip of Siberia) on the winter solstice, and the latest Shabbos of the year would be at the southernmost place just east of the IDL (i.e. Tahiti). </p>\n\n<p><em>However</em>, things get confusing because you need to consider where, exactly, the IDL <em>is</em>. In the examples above, I assume that it’s the civil IDL, but it’s not so clear that this is the case. A more detailed discussion can be found in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/322/9682\">this question</a>. Based on the various opinions there, the earliest Shabbos would seem to remain in Siberia, but the latest one could be anywhere between King Island (just south of Australia) to Tahiti.</p>\n\n<p>To confuse things further, there’s the concept of “early Shabbos.” While commonly applied in the summer, Shabbos can be taken in at Plag any day of the year. As such, the earliest Shabbos is not <em>sunset</em> of the winter solstice, but the time 10 3/4 of the way between either sunrise and sunset or Alos and Tzeis (the latter opening up yet another can of worms, depending on your definition of when those times are). This problem can be avoided, at least, by restricting yourself to “on-time” Shabbos and ignoring “early” Shabbos. </p>\n\n<p>One final point: I kinda lied earlier when I said that the earliest Shabbos occurs around the winter solstice and the latest around the summer solstice. You see, due to certain astronomical phenomena that I’m not going to get into right now, while those are indeed the shortest and longest days on the calendar, sunset starts creeping later a couple of weeks before the winter solstice, and earlier a couple of weeks before the summer solstice.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the easiest way to answer your question would, indeed, be to write an app to calculate it for you, but with the above information, you should be well on your way to doing so. Find the farthest northeast, just before the winter solstice, and plug it into the equation, and the farthest southwest, just before the summer solstice, and plug that in as well. Just make sure you’re clear on which posek you’re following when you define “farthest southwest.”</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was Reuben's repentance accepted? If not, why not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The midrash (Bereshit Rabba 84:19) indicates that Reuben did teshuva (repentance) for sleeping with his father's concubine Bilhah (Bereshit 35:22). However in both Yaakov's blessing (ibid 49:3-4) and in 1 Divrei HaYamim (5:1) Reuben's sin is discussed as if his act teshuva had not gained him forgiveness. \nI would like to know if my assumption that Reuben's sin was not forgiven is correct, and if so why not. If his repentance was in fact accepted why was he still described as being a sinner. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that Yaakov first turns to determining which of his sons will become the leader of the family. As such he discusses the character traits that will lead to the malchus (kingship). This means that he is saying that even though Reuven repented of the actual action, the character flaw that led to it still disqualified him from becoming the king.</p>\n\n<p>This flaw was that he was <em>unstable as water</em>. Another translation of <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8244#v=4&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vay'chi 49:4</a> is</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[You have] the restlessness of water; [therefore,] you shall not have superiority, </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But as nevertheless he says here: \"you are the most precious gem in my\n  treasury, are כחי וראשית אוני, but for the leadership of the family\n  you are not qualified, for that one must be עז, may not be moved by\n  soft flattering winds nor by stormy hurricanes, must have strong inner\n  firmness not be unstable like water\", from all this it was evident\n  that the incident referred to could not have had that importance which\n  the harsh blunt words וישכב וגו would seem to imply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Reuven had a tendency to jump up and act hastily, as we see when he offered to allow his two sons to be killed if he failed to bring back Binyamin. He rushed off, planning to rescue Yosef, without thinking that others (like the Midyanim) might come by and pull Yosef out and sell him. In fact he <em>moved his father's bed</em> from Bilha's tent to Leah's because he was sensitive to the honor of his mother. This is what is regarded as his sin even though it is not the literal meaning of <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8230#v=22&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayishlach 35:22</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And it came to pass when Israel sojourned in that land, that Reuben\n  went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard [of\n  it], and so, the sons of Jacob were twelve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rashi says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>and lay:</strong> Since he (Reuben) disarranged his (Jacob’s) bed,\n  Scripture considers it as if he had lain with her. Now why did he\n  disarrange and profane his bed? [It was] because when Rachel died,\n  Jacob took his bed, which had been regularly placed in Rachel’s tent\n  and not in the other tents, and moved it in to Bilhah’s tent. Reuben\n  came and protested his mother’s humiliation. He said,“If my mother’s\n  sister was a rival to my mother, should my mother’s sister’s handmaid\n  [now also] be a rival to my mother?” For this reason, he disarranged\n  it. — [from Shab. 55b]</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>and so, the sons of Jacob were twelve:</strong> [Scripture] commences with the previous topic (i.e. the birth of Benjamin). When Benjamin was\n  born, the marriage bed (i.e. the destined number of sons) was\n  completed, and from then on, it was proper that they be counted, and\n  [so] it (Scripture) counted them. Our Sages, however, interpreted that\n  these words are intended to teach us that all of them (Jacob’s sons)\n  were equal, and all of them were righteous, for Reuben had not sinned.\n  — [from Shab. 55b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch emphasizes that this was a character flaw that prevented leadership rather than an actual sin.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To a son who was the כח וראשית אונו of his father and who should be\n  יתר שאת ויתר עז any offence which would otherwise be considered quite\n  lightly, is taken most seriously. Had he really committed a real sin,\n  surely a Jacob would not have designated a Reuben by such a mild and\n  gentle epithet as פחז כמים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

An object is a specific vibration, every thing, or\n  subject, is an expression of a variant frequency. ‘Things’ are mere\n  externalized manifestations of internal, cosmic vibrations. Creation\n  begins with a subtle, (spiritual) vibration and movement within the\n  Infinite Creator, which then gives rise to a physical vibration of\n  energy, which is eventually solidified into matter. At every moment,\n  every physical time/space expression is an externalized manifestation\n  of a spiritual vibration. Man below is a reflection of the Above. The\n  power of human speech below mimics the creative power of Divine\n  speech. Divine speech creates reality and human speech qualifies\n  reality, calling it good or bad. On a deeper level, our words and how\n  we language our thoughts is a process of continually creating the\n  world around us. In other words, things are to us what we say they\n  are... Just as we have the power to create with speech, we have the\n  equivalent ability to destroy through speech. Our words, which are our\n  projections and vibrations, alter the inner frequency of the universe,\n  for good and for the opposite.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav DovBer Pinson</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The word דבר is used in everyday Hebrew just as freely as \"thing\" is used in English. </p></li>\n<li><p>You're seemingly wrong, the word \"דבר\" alone is never translated as \"a word\". And the root דבר as speech is used only as a verb, not a noun. Also, I don't recall where in Tanach דבר is used as a single word.</p></li>\n<li><p>There are synonyms to דבר, e.g. חפץ (stuff) or עצם (object).</p></li>\n<li><p>Technically you might be right, as the physical reality might be represented through scientific \"language\" of formulas - math, physics, chemistry etc. So every object is seen as a representation of scientific \"words\".</p></li>\n<li><p>Speculations are good, but maybe it's the other way around - the speech is called לדבר because of its objectification (לדבר דברים), as every word represents a \"thing\" therefore the speech is \"things\"?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Making Up Missed Tefillin-wearing\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Over at <a href=\"http://lifeinisrael.blogspot.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Life in Israel</a>, we find the <a href=\"http://lifeinisrael.blogspot.com/2018/12/interesting-psak-tefillin-twice-day-to.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">following interesting psak story</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As reported by Kikar, A frum, Haredi, man found himself in a faraway land with no Jews. The beginning of this sounds like the start of a fairy tale.. Anyways, the traveler came across a local Jew - the local was happy to see another Jew and asked to borrow his tefillin and lay them each day the traveler was in town.</p>\n<p>When it was time for traveler to leave and head back home, Mr Local Jew made a somewhat difficult request of his new Jewish friend - he asked if he would mind leaving his tefillin behind, for him to keep, and Mr Traveler would be able to replace them with a new pair when arriving back home in Israel. Mr Local Jew has no tefillin and has no way to get a pair, but Mr Traveler could easily get a new pair when he gets back home...</p>\n<p>Mr Traveler thought about and happily decided to leave his tefillin for Mr Local Jew. When he got back home, he bought himself a new set.</p>\n<p>After the fact, Mr Traveler asked a number of rabbonim if what he had done was correct and proper or if it was wrong - because he left his tefillin behind for Mr Local Jew he had to go a couple of days without laying tefillin until he could replace them! Maybe he was wrong for doing so.</p>\n<p>The question was brought to Rav Chaim Kanievsky who said that what he did was proper, but he needs to make up for the days he did not lay tefillin by laying his tefillin twice per day, once at the morning Shacharis services and once at the afternoon Mincha services, to make up for the days he missed. Other rabbonim the question was presented to agreed with this response.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rafi, the blogger there, notes that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The whole story ad [sic] discussion is interesting, but what is most interesting, to me, is the idea that because he missed a few days of laying tefillin he has to lay tefillin twice a day for a few days to make up for it. I don't think I ever heard that before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is, where in any Halachic literature is there a precedent for this suggestion, where we are told that someone who missed a day of tefillin should make it up in this fashion?  (Note that it is possible that this is his own chiddush, and that there is no precedent.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is very much a halachic position, not just a <em>tikkun</em> or <em>teshuva</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The discussion revolves around a central issue: Is the obligation to wear Tefillin <em>every</em> day, or <em>all</em> day. [Although we don't wear Tefillin all day, this is only due to our inability to ensure the requisite consistent cleanliness. The question still remains how to define the obligation, which has ramifications to this Psak]</p>\n\n<p>If the obligation is daily, then of course missing one day is something that can never be fixed.</p>\n\n<p>The Brisker Rav — quoted by Reb Moshe Shternbuch תשובות והנהגות ח”א <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20025&st=&pgnum=45\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סי’ מ”ט</a>, ח”ב <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20026&st=&pgnum=36\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סי’ ל</a>, ח”ג <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49820&st=&pgnum=15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סי’ י”א</a> — held that the obligation is <em>all</em> day, and that there is no different between one day and the next. See also <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19961&st=&pgnum=253\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moadim Vezmanim</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, if I wore it tomorrow for the hour I would have worn it today, it is the same <em>kiyum</em>. So in a case where one was unable to wear Teffilin for a day, he could and should wear it for extra time the following day (or any other day).</p>\n\n\n",

Would they allow one to browse this website?\nWhat about if the answers/questions were about Nittel?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If you hold that you can't learn on nittel then learning on this site is still considered learning . If you hold that learning in private is fine ,then browsing this site in private is fine. \nRegarding looking up questions about nittel on nittel would seem to be fine. Just like we find by Tisha bav that one can learn about laws of tisha bav so too on nittel one should be able to learn about nittel,however learning biyun on the subject may be problematic . To give a halachic source would be difficult since this is a minhag,and many do not hold of it,but I think one can compare to tisha bav,since it shouldn't be any worse than tisha bav which is written in the SA.</p>\n\n<p>There is an idea(Korban Nesanel) that the minhag of not learning is beacuse of mourning and is like the destruction of the Bais Hamikdash. So the prohibiton of not learning could be similar to tisha bav.</p>\n\n<p>Nitei Gavriel:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fDWTv.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do Jews handle when a baby dies due to circumcision?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is a real question. I personally know of two cases. One is a friend of mine in USA. The other is in UK via my wife on a professional basis, where I was able to read the coroner's report. This is in addition to cases I know of via newspapers.</p>\n\n<p>The case involving my friend is the core motivation for this question. She is in a paradox of faith and anguish.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What comfort is there?</p>\n\n<p>What scripture can you turn to?</p>\n\n<p>What can you say to the grieving mother?</p>\n\n<p>How does the mohel handle his feelings of guilt?</p>\n\n<p>How does the community respond if that bereaved mother now refuses to have a future son circumcised?</p>\n\n<p>How does the community respond if that mohel now refuses to conduct another circumcision?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>At least to points 1-3, I'm not sure there's any one-size-fits-all answer. First of all, what comforts one person may not comfort another (or they might even consider it insensitive). Second, ideas from one or another Jewish source may or may not mean something to your friend, depending on her level of engagement/identification with those sources and ideas. (It's also possible that the wound is too raw for any kind of comfort right now.)</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>There is a popular story about a couple whose son, born after many years of childlessness, died at age 2. They are told by the Baal Shem Tov that this child was a reincarnation of a heroic Jew whose soul needed just a short time more on earth to complete its mission, and that they had the privilege of helping it to do so. (The entire story is at <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/102694/jewish/The-Reincarnated-Prince.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/102694/jewish/The-Reincarnated-Prince.htm</a>. I think I've also seen a version where the couple ended up having another child who grew up to be a famous holy Jew.)</p>\n\n<p>Conceivably the same might be true of your friend and her child, although (a) there's of course no way for us to know, (b) depending on to what extent she identifies with the Baal Shem Tov's teachings and/or accepts reincarnation as a Jewish belief, this story may or may not mean something to her.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Talmud (Gittin 57b), commenting on a verse (Psalms 44:23), \"For Your sake we are killed all day long,\" comments that circumcision is an example of this (because of the nonzero level of danger involved). That statement follows several other interpretations of this verse, one of them being that it refers to the famous story of Chanah (Hannah) and her seven sons, a classic example of Jews being ready to die \"for the sanctification of G-d's name\" (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/429014/jewish/chanah-and-her-seven-sons.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/429014/jewish/chanah-and-her-seven-sons.htm</a>). And such sacrifice has always been seen in Jewish history as a privilege and a great merit (it's told about R. Yosef Caro, a revered sage and author of the standard code of Jewish law, that he was promised this privilege and then later had it withdrawn).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It might be worth checking with her local Orthodox rabbi to see whether either of these, or other relevant sources, might speak to her.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>About point 4 (and 6), if the mohel's guilty feelings make him re-evaluate his practices (make sure to check the baby more carefully, improve his hygienic standards, etc.), so much the better. He might choose instead to withdraw, in which case one important factor to consider might be whether are there enough other mohalim available to serve the community.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Let me get started on this point, about future circumcisions. Obviously if there is familial hemophilia or any other medical indication against future babies having circumcision, don't do it. If, however, the doctors say \"this baby is totally fine\" and the parents can't bring themselves to do it ... the parents are viewed as tragically mistaken, but not heretics.</p>\n\n<p>Zevachim 22b reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Had the Torah told us that a heretic can't serve as a Temple priest, I would have said that's because his heart isn't aligned with Heaven. However someone who didn't fulfill circumcision, their heart is aligned with Heaven, so I would have thought they could; therefore the verse (Ezekiel 44) spells out that both the heretic and the circumcision-noncompliant may not serve. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(A similar quote appears in Pesachim 96a concerning who may eat the Passover sacrifice.)</p>\n\n<p>Tosafot (on Zevachim, s.v. <em>arel</em>) observes that we are talking about someone who is obligated to perform circumcision and not doing it, yet we still say \"their heart is aligned with Heaven.\" He says this means someone who believes in the mitzva, but just panics as he fears his child being in pain. </p>\n\n<p>One of the other commentaries on that subject -- afraid I haven't found it off-hand -- suggest another case of \"they're not doing when obligated, but their heart is in the right place\" -- would be if only one previous child died of circumcision. </p>\n\n<p>So if the parents couldn't do it again, we'd say they're wrong, they are still obligated ... but we certainly understand where they are coming from.</p>\n\n\n",

It's making your residence in two places!\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The introduction of ר׳ פנחס קהתי's to מסכת ערובין reads, in part (in my own translation and with emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>… that residents of the courtyard not carry from their houses to the courtyard or from the courtyard to their houses unless they made an \"<em>eruv [chatzeros]</em>\", i.e. that all the residents place food before the sabbath in the house of one of their number. By doing so their domain becomes combined, <strong>they themselves are as if they're all concentrated in the residence in which the <em>eruv</em> food is placed</strong>, and the entire courtyard with its houses becomes as if one homogeneous domain.…</p>\n<p>… makes an \"<em>eruv t'chumim</em>\" before the sabbath, i.e. that he places… two meals' food, thereby acquiring sabbathhood at that location when the sabbath starts, meaning that <strong>we look upon the location where he left the <em>eruv</em> as if it's his house for this sabbath</strong>…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My kid asked: Why is it possible for someone to make both an <em>eruv chatzeros</em> and an <em>eruv t'chumin</em>? It's setting his residence in two different places for the same sabbath and shouldn't work. [I might add that the same applies to making two <em>eruve chatzeros</em>.] We've never heard that's impossible.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To address your bracketed query regarding making two <em>eruvei chatzerot</em>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.372.15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch HaShulchan, Orach Chayyim 372:15</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בית העומדת בין שתי חצרות, שכל אחת עירבה לעצמה והוא עירב עם שתיהן - יכול לטלטל לכאן ולכאן כל דבר. ואין לומר איך אדם דר בשני מקומות, דאין זה שאלה, דכל אדם יש לו רשות לדור ולאכול בכמה מקומות, וכולם חשובים אצלו דירות.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>A house which is in between two courtyards, each one having made its own <em>eruv</em>, and [the inhabitant of this house] makes an <em>eruv</em> with both of them, he may carry anything to both courtyards.</p>\n  \n  <p>Don't ask, \"How can someone live in two places?\" This is no question, because every person can live and eat in multiple places, all of which are considered his houses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As far as your primary question regarding creating both an <em>eruv techumin</em> and <em>eruv chatzerot</em>, I would posit that the same holds true. One can create a residence at the time <em>shabbat</em> starts in the place where one places one's <em>eruv techumin</em>, while simultaneously having another residence (to be used later on during <em>shabbat</em>) in the courtyard for the purposes of creating an <em>eruv chatzerot</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is a big difference between them. Eruv t'chumin establishes your residency for this shabbos. While, eruv chatzeros establishes your ownership or actually gives up your ownership rights for other to use.\nIts easier to image when you are owner of 2 houses. You decide to spend the shabbos in house A but your neighbors from house B are asking if their kids can play in your backyard of house B?<br />\nSo your eruv t'chumin is in house A while the neighbors from house B need you to relinquish your ownership rights for them to carry in your rightful property there.\nThe best example is a bungalow colony where there are communal areas such as playground and all the owners have part in it and therefore no one can carry from their private bungalow to a shared space. The way around is to create eruv chatzeros by relinquish their personal rights to the communal space and thereby making into 1 owner property.</p>\n\n\n",

However, they do not permit cutting letters on cake. Similarly, they forbid cutting through letters on a wrapper or piece of paper (e.g. <em>Shemiras Shabbos Ke-Hilkhasah</em> 9:12; R. Gersion Appel, <em>Concise Code of Jewish Law</em>, vol. 2, p. 199).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To peel a hard-boiled egg, I usually follow these steps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Crack it.</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/peel-a-hard-boiled-egg-in-three-seconds-with-a-one-hand-1654232058\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Roll it on the table</a>. (Some say that this <a href=\"https://greatist.com/eat/how-to-peel-hard-boiled-eggs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">helps</a> to detach the membrane from the egg white. A <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/life/2017/03/24/life-hack-investigator-hard-boiled-eggs-unyielding-no-more.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">column</a> by the Life Hack Investigator says that the rolling technique is almost as good as the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/quickly-peel-a-hard-boiled-egg-by-shaking-it-in-a-glass-1683335985\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shake method</a>. Both of the aforementioned techniques are more popular than the <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/peel-a-boiled-egg-with-a-spoon-1674482421\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">spoon method</a>.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Remove the peel.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Where I live, many eggs have the best-before date <a href=\"https://www.chowhound.com/post/stamping-eggs-date-338070\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">printed on the shell</a>. After boiling, the date marking fades but doesn't fully disappear.</p>\n\n<p>Cracking and rolling the egg might be likely to tear the letters.</p>\n\n<p>I'd rather not peel the egg before Shabbat and store it in a plastic bag. I bet the egg might stay fresh for more days if I keep it in its shell.</p>\n\n<h1>My question</h1>\n\n<p>Is it okay to crack and roll a boiled egg on Shabbat, even if the rolling will tear the letters printed on the egg?</p>\n\n<h1>Why I think it might be okay</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Maybe the final Halachic ruling is more lenient than we thought; please see Rabbi Student's full <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2013/07/the-candy-wrapper-dilemma/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Also, maybe cracking and rolling isn't guaranteed to tear the letters; so maybe this changes things. But I currently don't have any boiled eggs handy in order to experiment with and find out.</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, rolling an egg on a table isn't the usual way of erasing letters, so maybe the problem is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinuy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reduced</a> or eliminated.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Postscript</h1>\n\n<p>Instead of trusting the answers here, it's best to ask your own rabbi, for <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9146/why-is-it-necessary-to-ask-a-rabbi\">many reasons</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In the English version of <em><a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/shemirath-shabbath.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemirath Shabbath k'Hilchata</a></em> (11:10), R' Yehoshua Neuwirth is strict and writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When removing the shell from an egg, one should be careful not to\n  break through any letters or designs which may be stamped on it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but he is most likely speaking of hand-removing the shell while your case is slightly different.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that, in your case, when rolling the egg, you don't want to break the letters, and you have no use for the peel. This is therefore a case of \"a certain outcome which one doesn't benefit from\" (<em>pesik reisha de-lo nicha le</em>).</p>\n\n<p>I asked your question to R Binyamin Tabady who agreed and gave the conclusion as follows: since the the tearing of the letters is an <em>issur de-rabanan</em> (as it is <em>mocheik she lo al menat lichtov</em> -- to erase but not in order to write), Sefaradim permit the action. Ashkenazim only permit it with a <em>shinui</em> (different way of performing the action than regular). For me who never peels eggs your way, rolling them might be enough of a <em>shinui</em> but for someone who regularly peels this way it would require something more, e.g., doing it with the opposite hand.</p>\n\n<p>As always with Mi Yodeya, don't trust what you read here and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9146/why-is-it-necessary-to-ask-a-rabbi\">ask your rabbi</a>.</p>\n\n<p>PS.

Moreover, the Pasuk talks of Yehoshua that wasn't a king (officially) but he was a prophet, so the punishment can be seen as זקן ממרה  - contradicting G-d's prophecy, and not as a King's will.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.8?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 8</a>, Shmuel lists the 30 rights of the Jewish King: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"וַיֹּאמֶר זֶה יִהְיֶה מִשְׁפַּט הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר יִמְלֹךְ עֲלֵיכֶם:<br>\n  אֶת־בְּנֵיכֶם יִקָּח וְשָׂם לוֹ בְּמֶרְכַּבְתּוֹ וּבְפָרָשָׁיו וְרָצוּ לִפְנֵי מֶרְכַּבְתּוֹ׃<br>\n  וְלָשׂוּם לוֹ שָׂרֵי אֲלָפִים וְשָׂרֵי חֲמִשִּׁים וְלַחֲרֹשׁ חֲרִישׁוֹ<br>\n  וְלִקְצֹר קְצִירוֹ וְלַעֲשׂוֹת כְּלֵי־מִלְחַמְתּוֹ וּכְלֵי רִכְבּוֹ׃<br>\n  וְאֶת־בְּנוֹתֵיכֶם יִקָּח לְרַקָּחוֹת וּלְטַבָּחוֹת וּלְאֹפוֹת׃<br>\n  וְאֶת־שְׂדוֹתֵיכֶם וְאֶת־כַּרְמֵיכֶם וְזֵיתֵיכֶם הַטּוֹבִים יִקָּח וְנָתַן לַעֲבָדָיו׃<br>\n  וְזַרְעֵיכֶם וְכַרְמֵיכֶם יַעְשֹׂר וְנָתַן לְסָרִיסָיו וְלַעֲבָדָיו׃<br>\n  וְאֶת־עַבְדֵיכֶם וְאֶת־שִׁפְחוֹתֵיכֶם וְאֶת־בַּחוּרֵיכֶם הַטּוֹבִים<br>\n  וְאֶת־חֲמוֹרֵיכֶם יִקָּח וְעָשָׂה לִמְלַאכְתּוֹ׃<br>\n  צֹאנְכֶם יַעְשֹׂר וְאַתֶּם תִּהְיוּ־לוֹ לַעֲבָדִים׃\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I can't spot the right to sentence to death. It is also very counterintuitive (in our times) to place a King's whims before G-d's justice.</p>\n\n<p>So Where is this power learned from?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As to your point about Yehoshua not being a(n official) king, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/93713/why-yehoshua-was-not-anointed-as-a-king\">your question</a> about this and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/93722/13438\">the</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/93761/13438\">answers</a> thereto which provide sources stating that Yehoshua <em>was</em> a king.

David Ibn Zimra</a> writes that a king for these purposes does not have to be officially appointed. As long as all of Israel accepts him, he has the status of a king:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והאי מלך היינו שהומלך על פי נביא או שהסכימו עליו כל ישראל אבל אם קם איש אחד ומלך על ישראל בחזקה אין ישראל חייבין לשמוע אליו והממרה את פיו לא נקרא מורד במלכות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As to why the ability to put rebels to death is not mentioned in Shmuel's list of the king's powers, I would suggest that it is because this ability is fundamentally different from the others mentioned. The other things mentioned there are things that the king can do to the commoners that the commoners have no control over. Shmuel is warning them that having a king will be unpleasant because a king can seize their property and family for his own interests. But the death penalty under discussion here is not something that the king can just inflict on the people. It is a specific punishment for a specific crime. If a citizen rebels against the king then the king has the right to kill the citizen. But if the citizen does not rebel then the king cannot kill the citizen. So it's not something that is subject to \"abuse\" in the same way; the citizens can just not rebel against the king's orders and then the king will not have the right to kill them.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that he learned this from ancient Egyptian texts and Greek books. He suggest that perhaps Bas Pharaoh learned Hebrew, or maybe she asked a Hebrew for the proper translation.

He was called \"Yered\" by Miriam, \"Chever\" by Amram, \"Yekusiel\" by Yocheved, \"Shemaiah\" by the Jewish people,  \"Avi Zenuach\" by Aharon, \"Avi Socho\" by his nursemaid, and \"Avi Gedor\" by Kehas ben Levi.

Similarly, Rambam does not count it as a Mitzvah on a King.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>(AFAIK) This rule was not applied before the main sequence of kings (ie. from Yehoshua to Shmuel), rather the only existing examples are starting from Saul/David times.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Besides being אסמכתא בעלמא how this verse can be the source of that law?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would suggest that this law--that the king may execute someone that disobeys his command--was originally a Halacha L'Moshe MiSinai, a law handed down strictly orally without mention in the text of the Torah.  If so, then n the verse you reference, they were simply referring to a well-known law that had been taught orally by Moshe Rabbenu.  But, since their comment was preserved in Sefer Yehoshua, we can point to their comment as a support or a source.</p>\n<p>As for Shmuel's comments in 1 Shmuel 8, it seems to me that there he is listing ways in which having a king will be painful to the nation, in an attempt to get them to change their minds and withdraw their request for a king.</p>\n<p>There's no need to mention that he will have authority to punish people who violate royal commands, because the authority to command and to enforce commands is the essential and obvious attribute of a king.  That's what the people are actually asking for.</p>\n\n\n",

You may wish to read through the entire siman. Since it appears from your question that you are particularly interested in disqualifications relating to sins the person may have committed, the following statement of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Isserles\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Moshe Isserles</a> from <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x419\" rel=\"noreferrer\">seif 5</a> is probably the most relevant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מי שעבר עבירה בשוגג כגון שהרג הנפש בשגגה וחזר בתשובה מותר להיות ש\"ץ אבל אם עשה במזיד לא דמ\"מ יצא עליו שם רע קודם התשובה</p>\n<p>One who committed a sin unintentionally, e.g. he killed someone unintentionally, and he returned in repentance, he is permitted to be a <em>shaliach tzibur</em>. But if he did [the sin] purposely, he cannot [serve as <em>shaliach tzibur</em>] because bad reports have still been circulated about him before the repentance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechiel_Michel_Epstein\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yechiel Michel Epstein</a> explains the status of \"unintentional\" and \"purposely\" as follows:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7705&st=&pgnum=105\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aruch hashulchan O.C. 53:8</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מלשון זה משמע דבמזיד אפילו פעם אחת ולא מהני התשובה לענין התמנותו לש\"ץ ובשוגג מהני לפעם אחת ותימא דבשוגג אפי' בכמה פעמים למה יפסול דעל שוגג לא שייך שם רע כמובן וצ\"ל דאין כונתו על פעם אחת דבפעם אחת אפילו במזיד כיון ששב מותר להיות ש\"ץ דכיון ששב נתבטל השם רע מיד ופסולו במזיד אינו אלא כשעשה איזה פעמים ובשוגג גם בכה\"ג כשר וכן משמע מדבריו בספרו דרכי משה ע\"ש</p>\n<p>From this language it is implied that [one who sins] purposely even one time [is disqualified] and repentance does not help for his being appointed to be a <em>shaliach tzibur</em>, and [one who sins] unintentionally [repentance] does help if [he only sinned] one time. And this is astounding, because in a case where [the sin] was unintentional, even if [he committed the sin] many times why should he be disqualified? Bad reports are not involved [if the sin was] unintentional, as is understood. We must [therefore] say that [R. Moshe Isserles's] intent was not to refer to a one-time [sin], for by a one-time [sin] even if done purposely he is allowed to be a <em>shaliach tzibur</em> because he repented, and since he repented the bad reports were immediately nullified.The disqualification for a purposeful [sin] is only when he has done it a bunch of times, and if [the sin was] unintentional then even in such a case [i.e. where he has sinned many times] he is valid [as a <em>shaliach tzibur</em>]. And this is implied from his words in his book Darchei Moshe, see there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later, R. Epstein discusses which sins R. Isserles was referring to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודע דזה שכתב הרג את הנפש לאו דוקא וה\"ה עבירה אחרת ויש להסתפק בעבירות דרבנן כששב אם נקרא יצא עליו שם רע אם לאו ונראה דאין חילוק בין דאורייתא לדרבנן</p>\n<p>And know that this that he wrote \"he killed a soul\" is not exact. It is the same if he committed another sin. And it is subject to doubt whether rabbinic sins once repented are considered to have created bad reports. And it appears that there is no difference between biblical and rabbinic [sins].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some of the commentators debate whether a purposeful sinner who repented can serve as a <em>shaliach tzibur</em> during the rest of the year but not for public fasts, because the disqualification of \"bad reports\" might only pertain to a <em>shaliach tzibur</em> for public fasts.</p>\n\n\n",

Brother Daniel was a Catholic monk who applied for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return, since he was born Jewish. In it, Rav Lichtenstein deals with this very question.</p>\n<p>While we generally repeat the gemara that says that once someone converted, even if they returned to their old faith, they are still Jewish. An apostate Jew is still a Jew, and his marriage valid. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.47b.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 47b</a>) As the idiom goes, \"ישראל, אף על פי שחטא, ישראל הוא -- an Israelite, even though he sinned, is an Israelite.\"</p>\n<p>However, there are two other gemaras. R' Assi worries about the potential validity of a marriage between a non-Jew and a Jew, because it is possible that the alleged non-Jew is actually a descendent of one of the 10 lost tribes. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.16b.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 16b</a>) But the gemara concludes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.17a.1-4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 17a</a>) with Shmuel's commitment to find a disproof. Apparently the 10 tribes are no longer \"an Israelite, even though he sinned.\" Quoting Hosea, one of their last prophets who warned them (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.5.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hosea 5:7</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"בַּה' בָּגָדוּ, כִּי-בָנִים זָרִים יָלָדוּ; עַתָּה יֹאכְלֵם חֹדֶשׁ, אֶת-חֶלְקֵיהֶם</p>\n<p>They were treacherous with Hashem, for they have begotten strange children, now shall the new moon consume them [and?] their portion.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Aharon cites a second gemara with this position. Rav Ami and Rav Assi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.6a.6-7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 6a</a>) learned that the Kusim (Samaritans) were not observing the Torah. \"ולא זזו משם עד שעשאום עובדי כוכבים גמורין - and they did not move from there until they made them [the Kusim] full-fledged gentiles.\"</p>\n<p>So how is it that a backslid convert is considered still Jewish, but the 10 Lost Tribes and Samaritans are not?</p>\n<p>Rav Aharon lists three possible resolutions:</p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> The Rashba tones down the statement about the Kusim. He says yes, they are indeed Jewish halachically, but since the rabbinate has the power to make or break marriages, they invalidated the marriages of Samaritans, making the marriage invalid LIKE those between a Jew and a non-Jew. Similarly, the Shulchan Arukh (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.159.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 159:3</a>) rules that Kusim are included in the prohibition against charging or paying interest.</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> The Mordechai (Hagahos Mordechai Yavamos 107) takes the opposite approach -- the validity of the marriage of the backslid convert is only as a stringency. We cannot invalidate the marriage because the husband might have thoughts of teshuvah. But if we could read minds and know that he really did return to his old faith, his Judaism would evaporate.</p>\n<p>(I am pausing my summary of the article to note that while this is theoretically interesting, I would be hard pressed to believe the Mordechai's position is a viable ruling today for pragmatic use. Consensus seems to have retired it. Perhaps as one factor among others when a rabbi is seeking a way to let a wife remarry when her apostate husband won't give her a <em>get</em>.)</p>\n<p><strong>3)</strong> Rav Aharon rules like his wife's great-grandfather's, Rav Chaim Brisker's resolution of the apparent contradiction. The Rambam rules that the apostate's marriage is still valid (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Marriage.4.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Ishus 4:15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Intercourse.13.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hil' Issurei Bi'ah 13:17</a>). And he writes in his commentary on the mishnah to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Niddah.7.4?lang=bi&p2=Rambam_on_Mishnah_Niddah.7.4.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah 7:4</a> that something that is in an inclosed with a Kusi's body in it is not tamei, like it would be if it were a Jewish body.</p>\n<p>Rav Chaim (and Rav Lichtenstein) understands the Rambam as distinguishing between the cases on the grounds of core identity. The apostate who goes back to acting as he did before converting to Judaism, even in worshipping idols (or the trinity), committed what Rav Aharon calls an \"apostasy of action\". However, the 10 Tribes and the Kusim lost their core identity. When the person gives up their Jewish roots, Jewishness is indeed lost.</p>\n<p>I think that gives two or maybe three valid answers to your question. (Depending if you agree to what I wrote about consensus burying the viability of ruling like the Mordekhai today.)</p>\n<p>However, Rav Aharon Lichtenstein rules in practice like the third. Brother Daniel joined another faith community. He doesn't try to be one of the Jewish Community. So, he is not halachically Jewish.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Brother Daniel may share more beliefs with Rav Aharon than would the typical Reform Rabbi -- he believes that the Torah was given to Moshe (perhaps even dictated) in the Sinai, that the Exodus really happened as told, that G-d \"Spoke\" to the Jews at Sinai, etc... But the Reform Rabbi did not give up his Jewish roots.</p>\n<p>The apostate Jew who sees himself as just that -- an differently-believing <em>Jew</em>, and a member of the Jewish community -- is not obligated to convert. However, <em>lechatchila</em> (if we can, before the fact) we would require a dunk in the mikvah as a sign of commitment before counting him toward a minyan.</p>\n<p>A baal teshuvah doesn't need to go to the mikvah before we count him toward a minyan, because typically they are not apostates in the active sense, they are products of upbringing (tinoqos shenishbu) who happened to end up believing apostasy.</p>\n<p>But Brother Daniel, because he left the Jewish People except when there was a legal advantage to pretend otherwise, would actually need that dunking halachically, at least according to this ruling.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Dr. Lawrence Schiffman addresses this question in his book <em>Who Was a Jew?: Rabbinic and Halakhic Perspectives on the Jewish Christian Schism</em>. The answer he provides for Christianity is that it was a gradual process but there were major milestones such as the promulgation of the blessing against heretics in the amida and the banning of Jews from Jerusalem after the Bar Kochva revolt. These factors combined to make it abundantly clear to the outside world who was a Jew and who was a Christian. Jewish Christians may have persisted in smaller groups after that and a possible final demarcation would be the declaration of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire.</p>\n<p>I would speculate that similar world events helped to identify that followers of Shabbtai Tzvi were no longer considered part of Judaism after he apostatized. In other words, historical reality led to a tacit halachic understanding over time. Spurred by individual cases, for example if a 'jewish christian' male married a non-Jewish (christian) woman the child would halachically not be Jewish. Add that up enough times and you get an emergent social trend to not treat children in families that have affiliation with christianity as Jewish. No formal halachic 'line in the sand' was drawn, nor was one needed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>A form of worship(or even \"sect\" of Judaism) halachically becomes distinct from Judaism when it rejects any or all of the fundamentals of Judaism and adopts halachic practices and processes rejected by Chazal. Children born to these sects remain Jewish until they are born to a non-Jewish woman. Once they are borne from a non-Jewish woman, the child loses their status as a Jew and requires conversion, should they wish to become Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamentals of Judaism have been redacted to 13 principles by the Rambam and can be found here:<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/332555/jewish/Maimonides-13-Principles-of-Faith.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/332555/jewish/Maimonides-13-Principles-of-Faith.htm</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These are them(credit to chabad.org):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Belief in the existence of the Creator, who is perfect in every manner of existence and is the Primary Cause of all that exists.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief in G‑d's absolute and unparalleled unity.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief in G‑d's non-corporeality, nor that He will be affected by any physical occurrences, such as movement, or rest, or dwelling.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief in G‑d's eternity.</p></li>\n<li><p>The imperative to worship G‑d exclusively and no foreign false gods.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief that G‑d communicates with man through prophecy.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief in the primacy of the prophecy of Moses our teacher.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief in the divine origin of the Torah.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief in the immutability of the Torah.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief in G‑d's omniscience and providence.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief in divine reward and retribution.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief in the arrival of the Messiah and the messianic era.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief in the resurrection of the dead.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The early catholics rejected the Torah and replaced it with a \"new testament\"; thus changing the Torah in violation of principle #9. They also violated principle #5.</p>\n\n<p>The Tzadukim and Beitusim rejected the principle of olam haba, in violation of principles 12 & 13.</p>\n\n<p>The Karaites rejected that the Torah is divine, in violation of principle #8.</p>\n\n<p>The kutim worshipped a small dove, in violation of principle #5.</p>\n\n<p>The Reform and Conservative movements rejected the belief in one God(or don't require it, at least), that the Torah is divine, and more. Although many of them are still Jews(for now), they marry non-Jews freely and their children and/or grandchildren are not or won't be Jewish once they will be born to a non-Jewish woman. See here for a chart based on statistics from the Pew Research center:<a href=\"https://www.simpletoremember.com/grandchildren/WYGBJpdf.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.simpletoremember.com/grandchildren/WYGBJpdf.pdf</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As with most of the above listed sects, the first generations were Jewish, but they eventually married out(demarcation/halachic line of maintaining Jewish status) and lost their status as Jews. The same will be true and is true of every religion that doesn't adhere to Judaism; they eventually marry out and bear non-Jewish children until the majority/totality of the sect becomes non-Jewish. </p>\n\n\n",

This, it is\n  evident, is the meaning since Scripture adds \"I am the Lord your God\"\n  (the plural) — both you and your father are equally bound to honour\n  Me! <strong>Do not therefore obey him if it results in making My words of no\n  effect.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From this I understand that one shouldn't overcome the prohibition of entering a church because of wanting to please one's father.</p>\n\n<p>A second reason might be that a convert loses his family connection, as such he doesn't have a formal commandment of obeying his father (although he is still bound to honor and respect them, see e.g., <a href=\"http://dordeah.com/index.php/our-articles/all-articles/10-articles/167-jewish-converts-on-honoring-one-s-parents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>As always here, should this be a real question, you should <a href=\"http://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9146\">CYLOR</a>.</p>\n\n<p>PS.

It also rules (Yevamos 114a) that a Jewish baby may nurse from a non-kosher animal. As a result, Rabbeinu Chananel states that this is a case of Pikuach Nefesh. That is that a baby is always considered in a state of pikuach nefesh and would thus be allowed to have non-kosher food.</p>\n\n<p>There are those who say that mothers' milk is never considered non-kosher (just as it is not considered dairy). However, the reason for avoiding the milk of a non-Jewish woman is for hashkafic reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi and Ritva explain that the milk of a woman who eats non-kosher food will affect the infant. Thus, a nonJewish woman who only eats kosher food (while she is nursing) will avoid this problem. A Jewish woman who must eat non-kosher food for medical reasons (so it is permitted) should still not nurse the infant.</p>\n\n<p>Rashba and Meiri argue that the milk of a nonJewish woman will engender the traits of the goyim in the baby. Thus, even if the gentile only eats kosher food, the nursing should be avoided. One should nurse from a Jewish woman instead who will instill in the child the signature Jewish character traits of mercy (rachmanim), modesty (baishanim), and kindness (gomlei chasadim). Thus, they would allow a Jewish women who is forced to eat non-kosher food for health reasons to nursa the baby.</p>\n\n<p>The Rama (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 81:7) rules that a child should always avoid nursing from a non-Jewish woman when it is possible to nurse from a Jewish woman. The Rema quotes the Rashba’s reasoning that the nature of non-Jewish women will affect the child. The Rama also cites an opinion that a Jewish woman who is forced to eat non-kosher foods should refrain from nursing. Thus, he says to follow the stricter opinion of both possibilities.</p>\n\n\n",

So unless you have a super-strong youth program that is <em>itself</em> a community within your community, you need to engage the families, not just the kids.</p>\n\n<p>I see this problem in liberal congregations, which are also the ones where core Jewish values including <em>regular</em> communal prayer are weakest.  In a traditional community, kids grow up learning that <em>this is what we do</em>, not just because they're told but because they see their parents and older siblings and friends doing it, which in turn happens because of the centrality of <em>torah</em> and <em>mitzvah</em> observance in all aspects of life.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like you don't have a community where families routinely come, where (therefore) kids are part of and connected to the community from early on.  I don't know how you bootstrap that; it's a hard problem that I watch my liberal congregation, and others, struggle with.  But it's a whole-family, community-level challenge, not just \"how do we get kids to come\", because any special thing you do to attract kids, like special teen programming, revolves around the <em>programming</em> and not the service you're trying to get them to join.  My congregation has a special \"tot shabbat\" once a month, for example -- and those families come once a month, not every week.</p>\n\n<p>My congregation has a small, dedicated core on Shabbat mornings.  It started out as adults only and is still <em>mostly</em> adults, but as people in the <em>minyan</em> had kids, we had to think about how to be accessible to them too -- without sacrificing aspects of the service that keep that dedicated core coming.  For example, we knew that if we stripped out parts of the service to make it shorter for fidgety children, or dumbed down content for beginning readers, we'd lose the regulars.  Instead we looked for ways to engage kids while doing what we normally do; for example, kids are always part of the torah procession, and we have small stuffed \"torah scrolls\" for them to carry around.  We have a room just outside the chapel with comfortable furniture for parents and kids who need to step out for a bit of quiet time.  We use <em>niggunim</em> to teach, or reinforce, newer melodies (which helps adults too).  We set up the room so that it is as easy as possible for people to come late, leave early, or just step out for some time without drawing lots of attention.  We (like most places, I imagine) have food, including cookies (a kid favorite), after the service.  We don't have lots of kids coming, but the \"children of the <em>minyan</em>\" come.  With luck we'll grow the <em>minyan</em>, both adults and kids, over time.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p><strong>Why do teenagers do anything?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A few basic reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Their parents make them.</li>\n<li>Bribery.</li>\n<li>They get to see their friends.</li>\n<li>They get something out of the experience.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You're heading straight for #4 and asking, how can we make the experience more meaningful to youth so they'll want to come?  While it's an excellent question, I think it's the wrong one.</p>\n\n<p>If you get kids used to the experience and make it part of their routine, this will make it easy for them to do it when they are adults and truly have the choice.  How many Jews don't go to shul as adults because they \"don't know how\"?  Or they're afraid of being judged for not knowing what to do?  Or they just don't want to deal with a new experience?  </p>\n\n<p><strong>So I start with #1: make them.</strong>  In other words, it's not the kids you need to convince, it's the parents.  I made my kid go to shul regularly in the year before her bat mitzvah.  Now she rarely goes and it's totally her parents' fault.  I made her go last week though and the tradeoff was she had to greet people before the service and attend the oneg (that part is easy) but she didn't have to sit in the service.  Two of her friends came and they all hung out in another room.  I wasn't thrilled with that, but at least they were in the building, right?</p>\n\n<p><strong>A lot of times teens would be perfectly happy to go to shul or anyplace else, but they won't admit it.</strong>  So telling them they have to works like a charm.  They can roll their eyes and scowl at you, but they actually want to do it.  My daughter's like that every single morning when I drop her off at school.  She says \"do I have to go to school?\" but only 30 seconds before we arrive (if she's actually sick, she'll tell me when she wakes up...and when she does skip school, she can't wait to get back).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other times the teens might want to go someplace but only if their friends are there.</strong>  Friend circles are really important at this age, far more than they are to adults or even to younger kids.  Encouraging them to group message their friends so everyone knows who is and isn't coming is a plus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But what can the shul do?</strong>  I'd say give the teens special tasks.  Some can be service related, like Monica talks about, and others can be separate (like helping to hand out the drinks for kiddish).  Make sure friends are there.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Target kids by age.</strong>  Teens do <em>not</em> want to go to \"kids\" events.  My teen is only 13 but will not go to anything aimed at 11-12 year olds.  So unless the teens are asked to help out (with actual important tasks, not just to be there), forget about getting them to kids programs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And ask them.</strong>  Every community is different.  Maybe the shul wants to do a charity event.  Let the teens choose and plan it, with some adult supervision.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Childcare is also important</strong>, because parents of teens also have younger children.  Teens can help with the childcare too, which gets them in the building.  Make it easy for the parents to come and the kids (of all ages) are more likely to follow.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Sorry for coming late!</p>\n<p>This is unfortunately a situation that keeps happening.</p>\n<p>I'll try to also bring my own testimony as someone who went from not going at all (Not even Yom Kippur) to someone who tried to daven at shul every day (Difficult because of school).</p>\n<p>Firstly, as everyone before me said, parents are one key factor on the equation. You can't expect kids to do what their parents don't do.</p>\n<p>BH my shul has a very strong teenager program (CTeen), however, this does bring youth to shul, but mostly not for conection to Hashem, instead, they come to have a fun time and still keep some type of  \"tradition\".</p>\n<p>Having made this points along all points everyone did earlier, I think the issue is not on actually bringing the kids to shul, It's making them want to go to shul by what shul represents (meaning: connection to Hashem, davenin, connecting to other people and making ugmilus chassadim)</p>\n<p>However, this Is not a new issue, instead, I think it has to do with Haskala and eventually making of Judaism some type of social and cultural enviroment.</p>\n<p>In my case I became frum on my own, but maybe (and just maybe) if there was a big involvement of both parents and the shul organization on transmitting the core beliefs of Judaism, and actually trying to help each single teen, there would be with no doubt a pretty big change. Teens for the most part are not knowledgeable, with a lot of doubts and in need of someone to help them.\nHowever, this implies that both parents and the organization have an actual interest in keeping Judaism alive, which sadly, doesn't happen in every place.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, when a <em>segol</em> vowel eventually found its way in (*malk > *malek > melek), the pausal and the non-pausal forms were the same. The same would be true of a word like תבן, which comes from *tibn (I think, cf.

It seems from Pharaoh's and the overseers' commands that they couldn't collect twice as much straw one day and then make twice as many bricks the next day, or form an assembly line with one person collecting straw and someone else making bricks (כלו מעשיכם <strong>דבר יום ביומו</strong>).  They had to spend part of each day collecting straw and the second half making bricks, which must have been much less efficient and was an extra form of oppression.</p>\n\n<p>To symbolize that the straw wasn't the end of the story, it doesn't get a kamatz even when it should at the end of a pasuk.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn't fit with the Ibn Ezra and doesn't work out of the box for the two times the word appears in Yeshaya, but it's a start.</p>\n\n\n",

Learning tosfot is really learning talmud. All the mefarshim, rishonim and acharonim address the limud of tosfot. In yeshivot people say that if you don't understand the Maharsha, this is a proof that you didn't read accurately the tosfot. So Maharsha (called chidushe halachot) is the main relevant book on tosfot for most people, with Maharshal and Maharam. Mahari Ben Lev, and Torat Chayim, that are not printed in the Vilnius Talmud édition but are in the same category of basics for tosfot learning. But if you are still beginning and learn alone, the first (Chidushe Hatosfot) that you can see in the link can help you a lot to learn tosfot, this book helps to decifer the structure.</p>\n\n<p>In tosfot you need first to translate the text in \"formal language\", kushia, teruts, reaya, stira. Several times the structure is implicit, tosfot anticipate that he will refute an explanation before its explanation. You must translate \"this is an explanation\", but it's not agreed because x and y reason. And later tosfot quoted a rav that defends this opinion. If tosfot rejected a guirsa, you need first explore the pshat of the talmud with this girsa, or if he rejected the Rashi commentary, you need to explore it first. Each of the pshatim has strong points and weak points, tosfot makes comparison between them. The text of tosfot is very concise and you need to make your own length paraphrase with all details addressed. It's help to see e.g. Tosfot Harosh or Tosfot Santz, Tosfot Rabeinu Perets that are lengthened versions of tosfot help to decifer the tosfot on the daf which is a shortened version.</p>\n\n<p>Ve im Tomar comes as a consequence of the text above. Vechi tema Is a refuted teruts. Mihu, Ela is a refutation, af Al gav is a refuted objection. Veod yesh lomar is a new teruts because of a dochak in the first \"Veein lehakshot de...\" is a kushia followed by a teruts. You can learn darkei hatalmud from Rabbi ytschak kampenton to help the tosfot learning. Finally tosfot is very structured and the important is to find the words that work as \"operators\".</p>\n\n\n",

From what I understand, since it's night, we don't have the proper recognition of Hashem to say that His honor is blessed from His place (which is apparently localized), but only to say that the honor of His kingdom is blessed, since that is everywhere always:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזהו כבוד מלכותו ולא כבוד ה' שכבוד ה' אינו מלא הארץ רק במקומו ושיהיה ברוך ממקומו ויתברך כבוד מלכותו הניכר בארץ שהוא מצד השגת ה' הנעלמת להיות מושגת הבירור מצד היראה הברורה שבלב. רק תפשפש באפילה ובדרך אמוניי כדרך שנאמר (תהלים צ\"ב, ג') ואמונתך בלילות בעת חשכת ליל שאין אומרים קדושה בלילה שאז הוא חושך והעדר ההכרה הברורה ומשכה אז האמונה הטמונה בלב כל איש ישראל. שיש מלך אף על פי שאינו עומד לפניו שאז הוא כאדון העומד על עבדו ואב על בנו רק כמלך יושב בהיכלו. ומצד השגה באופן זה שהוא המכונה בזוהר ובפי חכמי האמת יחודא תתאה והשגה נעלמת ושפילה. היא הברוך והבקשה ממקומו שיהיה בזה תוספת וריבוי עד שיהיה ניכר ומושג לשפילים: </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Alternatively, it seems possible that this was to distance us from the Karaites. In <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=Gm8_AAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA21&dq=%22%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9%20%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9%20%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9%22%20%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Karaite Siddur</a> (page 10/5b), they appear to have a prayer based around \"kadosh\" and \"baruch\" that they say specifically at nights. However, that may just as easily be a Karaite response to us saying it only during the day (this is here just because it's cool).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now for some real halachic sources that show that there is no concern:</p>\n\n<p>The notes to Yalkut Yosef (OC 233 note 8) clearly say that there is no issue whatsoever with saying kedusha at night, and it wasn't added for ma'ariv since ma'ariv is only a reshus (i.e. it has a lesser status), and therefore, if someone hears kedusha after ma'ariv, they should certainly answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דהא דקיימא לן שאין קדושה בלילה, אינו בשביל שיש איסור לומר קדושה בלילה, אלא משום דערבית רשות ולא תקינו לומר קדושה. ולכן השומע קדושה מהצבור אחר שהתפלל ערבית, רשאי לענות קדושה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is said by Rav Ovadia Yosef himself in Yabia Omer 6:OC:21, note 4, and I direct you there (as well as the previous teshuvah) for a full halachic analysis, which I will not repeat here, but suffice it to say that there is another whole boatload of sources from all sorts of mainstream places. I will leave you with one early example (Ra'avan Berachos 169):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומדלא תקינו קדושה בתפילת ערבית כמו בשחרית ובשאר תפילות ש\"מ שהוא רשות כר' יהושע, ואפי' בערב שבת שתיקנו לש\"צ לומר ברכה אחת מעין שבע לא תיקנו לומר קדושה דרשות היא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is essentially what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_ben_Solomon_ibn_Abi_Zimra\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. David Ibn Zimra</a> writes in his responsum about Karaite Torah scrolls:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1952&pgnum=265\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shu\"t Radvaz 2:774</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואני שאלתי את פי הגדול שבהם והוא בקי בכ\"ד ספרים על עניינים הרבה שאינם מפורשים בתורה כעין קדושין וגטין ושחיטה שהם נוהגין בהם כל אלו מנין לכם ואמר לי כך למדו רבותינו ואמרתי לו א\"כ למה אין אתם מאמינים בכל דברי רז\"ל אמר לי כל דבר שאינו מנגד פשטי הכתובים אנו מאמינים להם וכל דבר שהוא מנגד פשטי הכתובים אין אנחנו מאמינים אמרתי לו תפח רוחו אם כן תורתכם בחיריית תופסים מה שהוא נאות לכם ומניחים מה שאינו נאות נמצא כל אחד מכם מפרש במצות הכתוב מה שירצה ויתיר מה שירצה ויאסור מה שירצה שהרי אין לדתכם שום גדר וסייג ולא שום מדה מהמדות שהתורה נדרשת בהם כללות הדברים הכחישו הקבלה והרי הם כעורים באפלה לא ידעו במה יכשלו ועליהם אמר הכתוב ורשעים בחשך ידמו</p>\n<p>And I asked the mouth of the greatest of them — and he was an expert in the 24 books — about many matters that are not explicit in the Torah, such as marriage, divorce, and slaughter, all of which they [Karaites] practice, \"whence do you know?\" And he said to me, \"such have our teachers taught us\". And I said to him, \"if so, why do you not believe in all the words of the Sages?\" He said to me, \"anything that is not against the plain meaning of the verses, we believe them; anything that is against the plain meaning of the verses, we do not believe them.\" I said to him, \"blast his soul. If so, your Torah is free. You can grasp whatever is pleasant for you and leave aside whatever is not pleasant. It comes out that each of you interpret the commandments of the Torah however he wants, and permits whatever he wants, and forbids whatever he wants, for behold your religion has no wall or fence, and none of the methodologies by which the Torah is expounded.\" The general principle is: they deny the Tradition, and they are like blind people in the dark; they don't know in what they are stumbling, and about them Scripture states, \"and the wicked in darkness shall be silent.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This general idea is also noted by Karaites themselves:</p>\n<p><strong>As it is Written: A Brief Case for Karaism p. 29</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Do Karaites believe that everything contained in the Talmud is wrong?</em></p>\n<p>No: To argue that every interpretation contained in the Talmud is wrong would be the same as arguing that a view is wrong simply because it is possessed by Karaites. This is not a fair means of debate, nor is it conducive to finding the truth behind some of the more pertinent issues in the Tanakh. When evaluating an interpretation, one must evaluate <em>the interpretation</em> rather than <em>the person</em> who holds the interpretation. In this case, it is fair to say that we should look at the message and not the messenger. On the other hand, to read the Talmud with the preconceived notion that it is the final word on the issues at hand is unacceptable — especially since the Talmud often reaches conclusions devoid of biblical support or even directly in contradiction to the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in short, they can accept anything in the Oral Torah as long as it does not contravene their methodology of interpretation. This methodology is explained more earlier, on p. 14:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fundamental tenet of Karaism is thus: \"Search in the Scriptures well and do not rely on anyone's opinion.\" Since in the end, we are accountable for our own decisions and actions, it is important that we each loo into the religious issues that concern our daily lives. While Karaites are encouraged to seek the opinion of others, it is imperative that we not accept those opinions without verifying that they make sense in the context of the Biblical narrative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For a specific example of how the Karaite interpretation of a commandment differs from the Rabbinic interpretation, you can see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/45294/how-do-karaites-shecht/96759#96759\">my answer</a> about Karaite slaughter.

The text of the responsum actually says \"<em>First</em> Temple\" but that seems to be a mistake.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to a baraita cited by the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.20b.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 20b</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן היה רבי יהודה אומר ג' מצות נצטוו ישראל בכניסתן לארץ להעמיד להם מלך ולהכרית זרעו של עמלק <strong>ולבנות להם בית הבחירה</strong></p>\n<p>And so would Rabbi Yehuda say: Three mitzvot were commanded to the Jewish people upon their entrance into Eretz Yisrael: to establish a king for themselves, and to cut off the seed of Amalek <strong>and to build the Chosen House (the Temple)</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, another baraita cited by the Talmud (<em>id</em>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא רבי יוסי אומר שלש מצות נצטוו ישראל בכניסתן לארץ להעמיד להם מלך ולהכרית זרעו של עמלק ולבנות להם בית הבחירה ואיני יודע איזה מהן תחילה</p>\n<p>It is taught in a baraita: Rabbi Yosei says: Three mitzvot were commanded to the Jewish people upon their entrance into Eretz Yisrael: To establish a king for themselves, and to cut off the seed of Amalek, and to build for themselves the Chosen House. But I do not know which one they are obligated to do first.</p>\n<p>כשהוא אומר (שמות יז, טז) כי יד על כס י-ה מלחמה לה' בעמלק הוי אומר להעמיד להם מלך תחילה ואין כסא אלא מלך שנאמר (דברי הימים א כט, כג) וישב שלמה על כסא ה' למלך</p>\n<p>When the verse states: “The hand upon the throne [kes] of the Lord: The Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation” (Exodus 17:16), you must say that this means they are obligated to establish a king for themselves first, and “Throne” means nothing other than a a king, as it is stated: “Then Solomon sat on the throne [kisei] of the Lord as king” (I Chronicles 29:23).”</p>\n<p>ועדיין איני יודע אם לבנות להם בית הבחירה תחלה או להכרית זרעו של עמלק תחלה כשהוא אומר (דברים יב, י) והניח לכם מכל אויביכם וגו' והיה המקום אשר יבחר ה' וגו' הוי אומר להכרית זרעו של עמלק תחלה</p>\n<p>And still I do not know whether building them the Chosen House is first, or cutting off the seed of Amalek is first, [i.e., after the appointing of the king]. When [the verse] states: “And He will give you rest from all your enemies [round about, so that you dwell in safety;] then it shall come to pass that the place that the Lord your God shall choose [to cause His name to dwell there, there shall you bring all that I command you]” (Deuteronomy 12:10–11), you must say that [the obligation is] to cut off the seed of Amalek first.</p>\n<p>וכן בדוד הוא אומר (שמואל ב ז, א) ויהי כי ישב המלך דוד בביתו וה' הניח לו מסביב וכתיב (שמואל ב ז, ב) ויאמר המלך אל נתן הנביא ראה נא אנכי יושב בבית ארזים וגו'</p>\n<p>The baraita continues: And so the verse states concerning David: “And it came to pass, when King David dwelled in his house and the Lord had given him rest round about [from all his enemies]” (II Samuel 7:1). And it is written [immediately] afterward: “The king said to Nathan the prophet: See now, I dwell in a house of cedar [but the Ark of G-d dwells within curtains” (II Samuel 7:2), and King David then began seeking a site to build the Temple].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Seemingly, while there is indeed a biblical commandment upon Israel to (re)build the Temple, there are preconditions (i.e. the obligations to appoint a king and to destroy Amalek) that delay the obligation.</p>\n<p>This is codified in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides' Laws of Kings and Wars 1:1-2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שָׁלֹשׁ מִצְוֹת נִצְטַוּוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל בִּשְׁעַת כְּנִיסָתָן לָאָרֶץ. לְמַנּוֹת לָהֶם מֶלֶךְ שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים יז טו) \"שׂוֹם תָּשִׂים עָלֶיךָ מֶלֶךְ\". וּלְהַכְרִית זַרְעוֹ שֶׁל עֲמָלֵק שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים כה יט) \"תִּמְחֶה אֶת זֵכֶר עֲמָלֵק\". וְלִבְנוֹת בֵּית הַבְּחִירָה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים יב ה) \"לְשִׁכְנוֹ תִדְרְשׁוּ וּבָאתָ שָּׁמָּה\":</p>\n<p>Israel was enjoined with three Commandments upon entering the Land: to appoint a king, as it says, “you shall set a king over yourselves” (Deut. 17:15); to destroy the descendents of Amalek, as it says “erase the memory of Amalek” (Deut. 25:19); and build the Temple, as it says, “you shall seek His habitation, and there you will come” (Deut. 12:5).</p>\n<p>מִנּוּי מֶלֶךְ קוֹדֵם לְמִלְחֶמֶת עֲמָלֵק. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמואל א טו א) \"אֹתִי שָׁלַח ה' לִמְשָׁחֳךָ לְמֶלֶךְ\" (שמואל א טו ג) \"עַתָּה לֵךְ וְהִכִּיתָה אֶת עֲמָלֵק\". וְהַכְרָתַת זֶרַע עֲמָלֵק קוֹדֶמֶת לְבִנְיַן הַבַּיִת. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמואל ב ז א) \"וַיְהִי כִּי יָשַׁב הַמֶּלֶךְ בְּבֵיתוֹ וַה' הֵנִיחַ לוֹ מִסָּבִיב מִכָּל אֹיְבָיו\" (שמואל ב ז ב) \"וַיֹּאמֶר הַמֶּלֶךְ אֶל נָתָן הַנָּבִיא אָנֹכִי יוֹשֵׁב בְּבֵית אֲרָזִים\" וְגוֹ'...</p>\n<p>The appointment of the king comes before the war with Amalek, as it says, “G-d has sent me to anoint you king…Now, go and smite Amalek” (I Samuel 15:1-3). The eradication of Amalek precedes the construction of the Temple, as it says, “and it was so, when the king was settled in his home, and G-d allowed him respite from his enemies all around. And the king said to Nathan, the Prophet, ‘I am living in a house of cedar…’” (II Samuel 7:1-2)...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nonetheless, (as noted by @DoubleAA in a comment) Kings David and Solomon had not entirely wiped out all traces of Amalek before seeking to and building the Temple.  Arguably, Rabbi Yosi's teaching may be more of a conceptually practical nature rather than an absolute legal precondition.  Thus his point may be that the Temple and what it represents cannot be built till the forces that fight it are subdued.  In the hypothetical you suggest, that may indeed be the case.  (Likewise, one might argue that a ruler that is able to rebuild the Temple fulfills the requirement of being a king.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Benefits of and punishments for Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I really wish to know with sources what are the benefits or rewards of observing Shabbat and what are the punishments for someone who desecrates it. Furthermore, what are the disadvantages of being a <em>Mekhalel</em> Shabbat from different sources? (For example, Chacham Ovadia says a <em>Mekhalel</em> shabbat can be lent money with interest) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=1574\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DailyHalacha</a> has a nice summary based on the Tur on SA OC 242</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Tur cites a number of passages from the Talmud that underscore the\n  importance of observing and enjoying Shabbat:</p>\n  \n  <p>1) One who observes Shabbat as a day of enjoyment and delight is\n  rewarded with a \"portion without boundaries,\" meaning, unlimited\n  blessings. Just as he spent money freely for the purpose of honoring\n  Shabbat, so is he rewarded with unlimited blessing.</p>\n  \n  <p>2) A person who properly observes Shabbat is spared subjugation and\n  oppression by foreign governments. Since he has joyfully accepted upon\n  himself God's kingship through the careful observance of Shabbat, he\n  will not have to endure subjugation to any other authority.</p>\n  \n  <p>3) Whoever observes Shabbat as a day of enjoyment and delight is\n  granted all the wishes of his heart. Just as he enjoyed the Shabbat,\n  so will God grant him what he needs to always experience joy and\n  contentment.</p>\n  \n  <p>4) Whoever properly observes Shabbat earns atonement for his misdeeds,\n  even if he worshipped foreign gods.</p>\n  \n  <p>[etc.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>R Eliezer Melamed (<a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/01-01-14/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Peninei Halakha Shabbat 1:14</a>) describes the punishment for the desecration of Shabbat</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if one intentionally desecrates Shabbat in front of witnesses who\n  forewarned him, he is liable for death by stoning. If no witnesses\n  were present, but the violation is intentional, he is subject to karet\n  (extirpation), as it is written: “You shall keep Shabbat, for it is\n  holy for you. He who profanes it shall be put to death; whoever does\n  work on it shall be cut off (ve-nikhreta) from among his people”\n  (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.31.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shemot 31:14</a>). In actuality, almost no one was ever put to\n  death, as it was rare for all the conditions that would mandate the\n  death penalty to be met.</p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>The severity of Shabbat desecration can also be seen in Zohar, which\n  states that during Shabbat, the fires of Hell stop consuming the\n  wicked, with the exception of those wicked who never observed Shabbat\n  (Zohar II 151:1). However, one who repented – and certainly one who\n  was already punished for his sin, like the wood gatherer – is forgiven\n  and not punished in Hell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For more see also <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/01-01-11/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for the benefits and <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/01-01-15/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">there</a> for the status of one who desecrates Shabbat.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.israel613.com/SHABBAT1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This has it good</a></p>\n\n<p>THE GREAT REWARD AND GLORY PROMISED TO HIM WHO SANCTIFIES THE HOLINESS OF SHABBAT AND THE PUNISHMENT TO HIM WHO DESECRATES THE SHABBAT</p>\n\n<p>THE PUNISHMENTS FOR THE TRANSGRESSORS</p>\n\n<p>1) \"To fear the L-rd your G-d all your days\"- This refers to Shabbat and festivals (Yevamoth 93).</p>\n\n<p>2) \"Fires are common only where there is desecration of the Shabbat\" (Shabbat 119b).</p>\n\n<p>3) \"Jerusalem was destroyed only because the Shabbat was desecrated\" therein (ibid.).</p>\n\n<p>4) When Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai would see his mother talking too much on Shabbat, he would say to her, \"Mother, today is Shabbat (Yerushalmi Shabbat 15:3).\"</p>\n\n<p>IDOLATRY AND DESECRATION OF SHABBAT HAVE THE SAME GRAVITY</p>\n\n<p>5) \"We may accept sacrifices from Jewish sinners so that they will repent, except from an apostate who offers wine as a libation to idols, or a flagrant violator of the Shabbat. From here we deduce that idolatry and desecration of the Shabbat are of equal gravity\" (Eruvin 69b).</p>\n\n<p>6) \"I would think that honoring one's father and mother would supersede the Shabbat. Scripture states, therefore: Each man shall fear his mother and father, and you shall observe my Shabbatot\" (Yevamoth 5b).</p>\n\n<p>7) \"One who casts excessive fear upon the members of his household, will eventually desecrate the Shabbat\" (Gittin 6b).</p>\n\n<p>8) \"Said Haman, \"if you wish to uproot them, uproot the Shabbat and curtail it, afterwards you will destroy them\" (Esther Rabbah 7).</p>\n\n<p>9) \"Tur Shimon was destroyed because they would play ball on Shabbat\" (Eichah Rabbah 2:3).</p>\n\n<p>10) \"Desecration of Shabbat is one of three sins for which their perpetrators are blamed for committing all sins.\" (Midrash Tannaim, Deut. 5).</p>\n\n<p>11) \"Whoever desecrates Shabbat, although he possesses Torah and good deeds, has no share in the World to Come\" (Avoth d'Rabbi Nathan, ch. 26).</p>\n\n<p>IT IS CONSIDERED AS VIOLATING ALL OF THE TORAH</p>\n\n<p>12) \"If you desecrated the Shabbat, I (G-d) consider it as though you desecrated all the commandments\" (Shemoth Rabbah 25)</p>\n\n<p>13) \"Whoever desecrates the Shabbat, testifies before He Who spoke and the world came into existence, that He did not create His world in six days and rest on the seventh\" (Mechilta Yitro)</p>\n\n<p>14) \"Any Jew who did not observe Shabbat in this world, has no rest to eternity. One official takes his body and brings it into Gehinnom in the presence of the wicked, where his soul has no rest in the fires of Hell. When Shabbat is over, that official returns his body to its place, and each is tortured individually\" (Midrash quoted by Maavar Yabbok, Sifthei Renanoth 39).</p>\n\n<p>THE EXILE CAME THROUGH THE DESECRATION OF SIN</p>\n\n<p>15) \"Because of desecration of Shabbat, we were scattered through the Diaspora\" (Tana d'vei Eliyahu Rabba ch. 26).</p>\n\n<p>16) \"As long as one honors his father and mother, neither the sin of desecration of Shabbat nor other sins will come about through him.\" (Tana d'vei Eliyahu Rabba 26).</p>\n\n<p>A BEATIFUL AND AWESOME STORY</p>\n\n<p>17) \"This incident occurred to a man who had an ox that he used to plow with every week day. When Shabbat arrived, he would let it rest. After a time, this righteous man lost his property and was required to sell the ox to a gentile. When Shabbat arrived, the ox refused to plow, as was its wont, even after receiving many cruel blows from the gentile. Consequently, the gentile turned to the Jew, the former owner, and requested that he take back the ox. The tzaddik immediately understood, and whispered into the ox's ear that now he belonged to a gentile and was obligated to perform his master's work even on Shabbat. He immediately stood up, ready to perform his work. Upon viewing this incident, the gentile feared that the ox was enchanted and did not let the tzaddik go until he related to him the entire matter.</p>\n\n<p>A SMART DEDUCTION MADE BY THE GENTILE</p>\n\n<p>When the gentile heard the story, he became frightened, quaked, and deduced the following concerning himself. He reasoned, \"if this animal, which has neither knowledge nor understanding, recognizes its Maker, is it not proper that I, whom the Holy One, Blessed be He, created in His image and His likeness, and gave me knowledge and understanding. Is it not proper that I, too, recognize my Maker?\" Immediately, he turned to the fear of heaven and was privileged to learn Torah. He was called Rabbi Yohanan ben Torasa\" (lit. the son of a cow) (Pesikta d'Rav Kahana, ch. 24; Midrash Aseres Hadibros).</p>\n\n<p>18) \"Because Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah did not protest the desecration of Shabbat perpetrated through his neighbor's cow, it was counted on his name [he was held responsible] and his teeth became black on account of the fasts [he performed to repent]\" (Shabbat 54 Betzah 23 Yerushalmi ibid.).</p>\n\n<p>19) \"Whoever desecrates Shabbat, has no forgiveness to eternity\" (Midrash Tannaim, Deut. 5). [author’s remark- unless he repents wholeheartedly]</p>\n\n<p>20) \"Whoever desecrates Shabbat is judged as having committed all evil\" (ibid.).</p>\n\n<p>A SPECIAL PLACE IN GEHINOMM FOR THOSE\n WHO VIOLATE THE SHABBAT</p>\n\n<p>21) \"There is a special place in Gehinnom for desecrators of  Shabbat (Zohar introd 14).</p>\n\n<p>22) \"Whoever desecrates Shabbat intentionally, cannot raise his head until he repents\" (Letters of Rabbi Akiva).</p>\n\n<p>SHABBAT IS THE NAME OF THE HOLY ONE BLESSED BE HE</p>\n\n<p>23) \"Shabbat is the Name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as is explained in the holy Zohar, Shemoth 88. It is, therefore, prohibited to pronounce 'it' where we may not utter holy words of Torah, I know some very pious people who exercise caution not to mention the word Shabbat unnecessarily\" (B'nei Yissochor, 1:1). 26) \"It is stated in the book Ruach Chaim (by Rabbi Chaim Palaggi o.b.m.) ch. 84, that, according to Chesed L'Avraham, who maintains that, according to the Zohar, Shabbat may not be mentioned in an unclean place, one should rather say, \"Shabbah\" instead of \"Shabbat\". Without a vow, I will take care to say, \"Shabbah\" instead of \"Shabbat\" (Sedey Chemed).</p>\n\n<p>WOMEN DIE DURING CHILDBIRTH FOR NOT\n LIGHTING SHABBAT CANDLES</p>\n\n<p>24) \"Because of three sins, women die during childbirth: ... One of these are because they are not careful with the kindling of the Shabbat lights\" (Shabbat 31b).</p>\n\n<p>25) \"Both Shabbat [observance] and [the interdiction of] idolatry, are each as important to us as all the mitzvot of the Torah. Shabbat is the sign between the Holy One, Blessed be He, forever, and us. Therefore, all those who transgress other mitzvot, are included among the wicked of Israel, but those who flagrantly desecrate Shabbat are regarded as idolaters in all respects\" (Rambam hil. Shabbat 7:15).</p>\n\n<p>26) \"An apostate for one sin is not regarded as an apostate for the entire Torah, and his slaughtering is not invalid, but an apostate who desecrates Shabbat is regarded as an apostate on the entire Torah, and his slaughtering is invalid, his wine is considered like that offered in libation to idols\" (Chulin 5a, Orach Chaim 385:3 Yoreh Deah 3, 119).</p>\n\n<p>QUOTATIONS FROM THE HOLY ZOHAR</p>\n\n<p>1) \"If one ignites fire on Shabbat, the Holy One, Blessed be He, says, \"I quenched the fire so that it would not burn, yet you ignite it. You will, therefore, burn in Gehinnom\" (Tikkunei Zohar 24, 69b).</p>\n\n<p>2) \"If the Jews do not observe the Shabbat, Scripture says: 'Sending away, you shall send away,' implying two expulsions\" (Tikkunei Zohar 6, 21b).</p>\n\n<p>THE ONE WHO KEEPS SHABBAT IS MADE IN G-D’S IMAGE OTHERWISE NOT</p>\n\n<p>3) \"If one keeps the mitzvah of Shabbat, he is \"in our image.\" Otherwise, he has no part of the seed of Israel\" (ibid. 47, 83b).</p>\n\n<p>4) \"All those who flagrantly desecrate the Shabbat and festivals, with no consideration for the honor of their Creator, just as they did not keep Shabbat in this world, so they do not keep it in the future world and they have no peace in Gehinnom. Rabbi Yehudah says: They keep Shabbat against their will.\" (Vol. 2, 150b).</p>\n\n<p>THE FIRE OF GEHINOMM NEVER DIES FOR THE WICKED WHO VIOLATED THE SHABBAT</p>\n\n<p>5) \"Those wicked who never keep Shabbat - the fire of Gehinnom never subsides for them, and all the wicked in Gehinnom ask about them. The angels of justice reply to them: \"These are the wicked who denied the existence of the Most Holy, Blessed be He, and desecrated the entire Torah by not keeping Shabbat\" All the wicked emerge from their place to look at them, as one angel puts the bodies of the Shabbat desecrators into Gehinnom within view of the other wicked who see that their worms do not die, nor does their fire extinguish itself all the wicked surround him and announce, \"This is so-and-so, the wicked, who had no consideration for the honor of his Creator. He denied the existence of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and the entire Torah. Woe is to him! It would have been better for him had he not been created.

He is sentenced to three severe punishments of the punishments of Gehinnom...\" (vol. 288b).</p>\n\n<p>19) \"Upon the departure of Shabbat the evil forces come out hurriedly and glide throughout the world, striving to rule over the nation of Israel. The Rabbis therefore, instituted the recitation of the song of demons (Ps. 91, which refers to G- d's protection of the righteous from demons).

The Holy One brought the plagues upon them in the order of a flesh-and-blood [king]. In the case of a flesh-and-blood king, when a state revolts against him, what does he do? He sends out legions which surround it. First he {smashes} [dams up] their aqueduct. If they repent, well and good; but if not, he brings war cries against them. [If they repent, well and good; but if not, he shoots arrows at them. If they repent, well and good; but if not, he brings the legions against them. If they repent, well and good; but if not, he brings hand-to-hand combat against them.] If they repent, well and good; but if not, he hurls (boiling) naphtha at them. If they repent, well and good; but if not, he hurls stones at them from a catapult. Then, if they repent, well and good; but if not, he stirs up {six legions} a lot of troops against them. If they repent, well and good; but if not, he binds them in prison. If they repent, well and good; but if not, he kills their noble ones. So did the Holy One come against the Egyptians in the order of kings.<br>\n  <strong>1.</strong> First he {smashed} [dammed up] their aqueduct(WATER SOURCE), as stated (in Ps. 78:44): HE TURNED THEIR NILES INTO BLOOD SO THAT THEIR STREAMS WERE UNDRINKABLE>.<br>\n  <strong>2.</strong> When they did not repent, he brought war cries against them. These were the frogs, as stated (in Exod. 8:8): THEN MOSES CRIED OUT TO THE LORD> ABOUT THE MATTER OF THE FROGS….<br>\n  <strong>3.</strong> Then, when they did not repent, he brought arrows upon them. These were the gnats, as stated (in Exod. 8:13 [17]): AND THERE WERE LICE [UPON HUMAN AND UPON BEAST], for each of them entered an Egyptian body like an arrow.<br>\n  <strong>4.</strong> [Then, when they did not repent, he brought the legions upon them. These were (according to Rabbi Yehuda) Wild ferocious animals /(according to Rabbi Nechemia) swarms of flies, as stated (in Ps. 78:45): HE SENT - MIXTURES OF WILD ANIMALS / SWARMS OF INSECTS - AMONG THEM TO DEVOUR THEM.<br>\n  <strong>5.</strong> Then, when they did not repent, he brought hand-to-hand combat upon them, as stated. This is the plague.]<br>\n  <strong>6.</strong> Then, when they did not repent, he hurled naphtha at them. This corresponds to the boils.<br>\n  <strong>7.</strong> Then, when they did not repent, he hurled great stones at them from a catapult. This is the hail.<br>\n  <strong>8.</strong> Then when they did not repent even after that, he stirred up a lot of troops against them. These were the locusts.<br>\n  <strong>9.</strong> Then after that he put them in prison. [This is the darkness,] as stated (in Exod. 10:21): DARKNESS THAT CAN BE TOUCHED….<br>\n  <strong>10.</strong> Then, when they did not repent, he killed all their eldest sons, as stated (in Exod. 12:29): THAT THE LORD SMOTE ALL THE FIRST-BORN.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

WHY THEN IS IT SAID, AND\n  WHEN THOU LIEST DOWN AND WHEN THOU RISEST UP? [THIS MEANS], AT THE TIME\n  WHEN PEOPLE LIE DOWN AND AT THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE RISE UP. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/zeraim/Berachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here we see that Beit Shammai interprets \"lying down\" and \"getting up\" as the position one should assume while reciting Shema, while Beit Hillel interprets it to mean that the time for reciting Shema is the time when people lie down and get up. </p>\n\n<p>The Talmud elaborates on Beit Shammai's view, and we see that Beit Shammai agrees that \"lying down\" and \"getting up\" refer to times of the day, just that they <em>also</em> tell us the correct position to assume:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=11&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 11a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא ב\"ש מ\"ט לא אמרי כב\"ה אמרי לך ב\"ש א\"כ נימא קרא בבקר ובערב מאי בשכבך ובקומך בשעת שכיבה שכיבה ממש ובשעת קימה קימה ממש</p>\n  \n  <p>But why do not Beth Shammai accept the view of Beth Hillel?\n  — Beth Shammai can reply: If this is so, let the text say, ‘In the morning and in the evening’. Why\n  does it say, ‘When thou liest down and when thou risest up’? To show that in the time of lying down\n  there must be actual lying down, and in the time of rising up there must be actual rising up. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/zeraim/Berachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How do we know that \"lie down\" and \"get up\" refer to times? Wouldn't the simplest reading of the Torah be that one should recite Shema when he lies down and when he gets up? I.e. it should be an event-based obligation, and it shouldn't matter what time it is. Yet it seems that no opinion understands it this way (even though the Talmud does not record any response on behalf of Beit Hillel regarding why the Torah doesn't just say \"morning\" and \"evening\" if it's just trying to tell us a time).</p>\n\n<p>Why? Was there simply a universal tradition that the verse refers to times? Was there some other textual evidence? Is it simply obvious that the commandment would be time-based?</p>\n\n<p>(Note that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34177/source-for-obligation-to-recite-the-shema/90108#90108\">according to R. Yehuda the recitation of Shema is only a rabbinic obligation</a>, in which case the Sages could have set whatever parameters they wanted. This question is assuming that the obligation is actually based on the verse.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The reason for the end of prophecy\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've heard people describe the lack of prophecy in the modern era as a result of the \"lower spiritual state\" of the Jewish people today. Many Jews are atheists or agnostic and don't keep Shabbat and so on. Is this correct? </p>\n\n<p>With that said, if the purpose of the creation is to establish a dirah b'tachtonim for G-d, I've always considered the forward march of history as approaching that spiritual state. In other words, we should be at a higher spiritual elevation today if the coming of Moshiach is closer now than it was 3,000 years ago. </p>\n\n<p>Is a better way to approach this question as one of dips and valleys? Perhaps we entered a lower state since the time of the last prophets (valley) but the general trend is an upward one? Does that mean that prophecy could potentially resume before the coming of Moshiach? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here's how I personally see this (<em>based on the tradition of <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/1709418/jewish/Rabbi-Rafael-Moshe-Luria-of-blessed-memory-A-Memorial.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">my Rabbi</a></em>) - <strong>it takes two to tango</strong>. This is based on a famous parable about the Moon  (Chulin 60b):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי שמעון בן פזי: ... אמרה ירח לפני הקב\"ה רבש\"ע אפשר לשני מלכים שישתמשו בכתר אחד אמר לה לכי ומעטי את עצמך</p>\n<p>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi... explains: When G-d first created the sun and the moon, they were equal. Then, the moon said before G-d: Is it possible for two kings to serve with one crown? G-d, therefore, said to the moon: If so, go and diminish yourself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p>This parable is frequently compared to the dynamics of this world, which is based on the interaction between G-d and the Jewish people, G-d being the Greater luminary and Israel being the Lesser luminary. As you might see, that just as all the light that comes from the Moon is just a reflection of the light of the Sun, similarly the wisdom of the Jews is a \"reflection\" of the divine wisdom.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>As we know the Torah is divided into two parts - the Written (the Writings) and the Oral (Mishnah, Talmud and on). While the first was received from G-d (either dictated or by Ruach Hakodesh), the other is the product of the Rabbinical thought (i.g. the \"reflection\"). (Note in Kabbalah, the former is called ז\"א and the later מלכות).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Similarly, the times (of the 6000 years of the creation) are roughly divided into 3 eras of 2000 years (based on Avodah Zarah 9): 2000 years before Torah, 2000 years of \"the Written Torah\" being the main part and 2000 years of the Oral Torah playing the main part. Here's where the tango example kicks in - after the receiving of the Torah, there is an epoch when G-d leads and an epoch where the Sages lead.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The epoch of the prophecy lasted until the beginning of the second Temple. That was the time of the Divine light, so to speak, where [practically] no Halachic arguments existed - the prophets could reveal the truth to anyone. The written Torah served as the ultimate source of knowledge and everything Halachic being derived from it by accepting the Divine messages. But the problem was that in the light of the Prophets no real Rabbinic thought could be expressed as it becomes unimportant.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>However, it is not fun for G-d to lead alone and He \"wanted\" to reveal the light of the Sages. But as we know \"שרגא בטיהרא מאי אהני\" (Chulin 60) - the light of a candle cannot be seen in sunlight, therefore to let the Sages' light shine G-d needed to withdraw His own light (aka prophecy) and become \"Hester/Hester Panim\". That's how the epoch of the Sages started (with the revelation of Purim - קבלו ברצון) and continues till nowadays.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Therefore, as I showed, the end of prophecy did not occur \"randomly\" or as a result of \"ירידת הדורות\" but was \"planned\" from the beginning of the creation, just as the destruction of the two Temples was planned (as Rashi brings on \"והוא בכה על צואריו\" Ber 45,14) with the sole purpose of enabling the light/the wisdom of the Sages (and Tzaddikim) shine.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope it \"shades some light\" on the necessity of the ending of the era of prophecy.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>NB. 1. Please don't downvote anonymously just because you've never heard those ideas.</em></p>\n<p><em>2. I know, some may argue that Chachamim existed from the times of Moses. True, but they always were subservient/secondary to the leader of the Nation and not as prominent as the Sages in the times of the Second Temple.</em></p>\n\n\n",

The Torah states regarding\n  an altar that it must be made out of whole stones – ones which iron\n  was never “waved on” (Deuteronomy 27:5-6). The reason, as the Talmud\n  explains, is because iron is used to shorten the life of man (through\n  war), while an altar lengthens the life of man – by granting him\n  atonement before God (Mishna Middot 3:4).</p>\n  \n  <p>Based on this, we do not use metal to cut tzitzit strings, since\n  fulfilling the mitzvah of tzitzit may also potentially lengthen a\n  person’s life.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>On top of this, there are Kabbalistic reasons that the tzitzit should\n  only be cut with one’s teeth. Thus, ideally, you should shorten them\n  by biting off the ends. If this is difficult, however, it’s fine to\n  cut them via other methods – such as burning the ends or cutting them\n  with any non-metallic instrument, such as a ceramic knife.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>(Note that however they’re cut, they should not be shortened down\n  beneath the required length – preferably about 11.5 inches).</p>\n  \n  <p>(Sources: Rema to Shulchan Aruch O.C. 11:4, Magen Avraham 18 with\n  Machatzis HaShekel, Ta’amei HaMinhagim 19, Shulchan Aruch HaRav 11:24,\n  Kaf HaChaim 11:17, Mishna Berurah 11:61.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also further sources on this related MY question: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9556/11501\">Cutting tzitzis strings</a> as well as <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2011/02/14/cutting-off-tzitzis-strings/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n\n",

So if you’ve got an answer, answer quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose that we use the word “summer” to refer to that part of the year when the northern hemisphere has relatively warm weather, long days and short nights; and we use the word “winter” by contrast to mean that part of the year when the northern hemisphere has relatively cold weather, short days and long nights.</p>\n\n<p>If we do all of that math described in all of those previous questions and conclude that in one century we will begin to pray for rain on December 3, and in the next century we will begin on December 4, and in the next century we will begin on December 5, is that because December is moving from winter to summer, or because our prayer for rain is? Or is there some third alternative?</p>\n\n<p>In other words, I'm not asking how to compute anything. I'm asking what these computations are supposed to achieve, and what they will achieve. In what sense will this set of rules (our complicated rule for this prayer and the complicated rule concerning February 29) preserve the seasonality of our prayer and of the months January through December?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The rules try to keep the date for requesting rain in the late fall. They are not perfect. No rule would be except adding the ever-changing long decimal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year\" rel=\"noreferrer\">tropical year length</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If we were to take a simple rule and start requesting rain always 365 days after the previous time, we'd end up shifting a day earlier every four years.</p>\n\n<p>If we were to do that, but every four years add back one day to compensate, we'd end up shifting a day later about every 130 years.</p>\n\n<p>If we were to do that, but three times every four hundred years drop out one day each to compensate, we'd still end up off a day every ~3200 years.</p>\n\n<p>Method 2 is what we use for simplicity because it's good enough. Method 3 is what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar\" rel=\"noreferrer\">modern calendars</a> use (by way of including February 29 sometimes). That's why 3 times every 400 years (specifically, in whole century years not divisible by 400) our date shifts relative to modern calendars.</p>\n\n<p>But everyone really is just approximating since the tropical year isn't a rational number of days long. Either you use the precise astronomically calculated decimal value, or you approximate to an accuracy that is \"good enough\" for your purposes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The rules you mention in your question are supposed to give a date 60 days after the autumnal equinox as the start date for requesting rain, following the practice in Babylon during Talmudic times.</p>\n<p>As noted in @DoubleAA’s answer, the current system is based on the ‘tekufah of Shemuel’ which assumes a mean solar year of 365.25 years, causing a slight drift year on year, relative to the ‘true’ solar year.</p>\n<p>R. Moshe Feinstein in Iggerot Moshe Orach Chaim 4:17 notes that we are unconcerned by this inaccuracy for a couple of reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>There is nothing inherently special about ‘Day 60 following the equinox’. It’s just that in most years, rain is beneficial from that time on. In order to have a practice which stays consistent from year to year, ‘Day 60’ was selected, and because Shmuel’s estimate is more easily computed, that is what is used in practice, with its inaccuracies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For us, ‘Day 60 following the equinox’ has even less meaning from an agricultural or climatic perspective. We don’t necessarily need the rain to start precisely then. We just do what they did in Talmudic Babylonia. And in Talmudic Babylonia, they followed Shmuel’s opinion (whose inaccuracy at the time was either not known or not relevant on their timescales).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can one \"turn around\" a tefilin arm strap in case it is damaged?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If the tefilin strap of the arm tefilin is broken, can one use the remainder piece if it is long enough?</p>\n\n<p>Can one turn the strap around and use the \"other side\"  of the strap that was around finger and hand (in case the original side by the knot shows significant tear) or must one use the original side? Is there an issue of <em>maale bekodesh</em> that might prevent from using the strap in the other direction?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Kesset HaSofer (a compendium of the laws of scribal writing by the author of Kitzur Shulchan Arukh) 25:5 (<a href=\"http://www.hasoferet.com/halakha-for-scribes/keset-ha-sofer/chapter-25/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, quoted <a href=\"http://tiferet-stam.co.il/en/shut-haposkim/chapter-four-the-tefillin-straps\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) writes it is forbidden to turn a strap around and re-tie it so that the end that beforehand was below is now above near the <em>kesher</em>, because it lessens the <em>kedusha</em> of the end that beforehand was above.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the strap of the shel yad was broken near to the knot, it is forbidden to take the strap out, turn it round, and use the other [less worn out – Maḥatzit ha-Shekel.] end to make the knot, and knotting in the broken end, which used to have the knot in it, below. This is because doing so reduces its sanctity; it used to have the yud in it, and now it is being used for the wrapping (Magen Avraham, and see the Maḥatzit ha-Shekel) – and if the strap was shorter now, he just shouldn’t wrap it so many times around his arm. <strong>Even if he discarded the broken part</strong>, assuming he had enough left over, he shouldn’t turn it round, but he should make the knot as close to its original location as possible (Peri Megadim).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, if the strap is long enough, the Kesset HaSofer would permit cutting the broken part, putting it in <em>geniza</em> and retying the knot with the upper part of the (now shortened) strap.</p>\n\n<p>PS. Cutting the strap is not an issue, many <em>sofrim</em> will do this as straps tend to be sold in formats which are too large for most men (I discussed it no later than two days ago with a <em>sofer</em>). This is also the ruling of <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2012/01/18/tefillin-with-retzuos-too-long/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dinonline</a>. But one has to be careful to put the discarded piece of strap in <em>geniza</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.154.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA OC 154:3</a>).

However I cannot figure out what to do on evening Shabbat. I know that the middle is left out but I am not sure what defines the middle in the audio. Can anyone tell me?</p>\n\n<p>Also, is this same version of the Amidah to be used for morning, evening, and afternoon? I read that the Amidah should be done 3 times a day during the week.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Indeed one prays the amida three times a day (four times on Shabbat and holidays), once in the evening (<em>arvit</em>) since the Jewish  day goes from evening to evening, once in the morning (<em>shaharit</em>) and once in the afternoon (<em>minha</em>). See <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/calendar/zmanim_cdo/jewish/Halachic-Times.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> if you are interested in the exact times (definitions are <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/134527/jewish/Zmanim-Briefly-Defined-and-Explained.htm#shema\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>During the week it is nearly the same <em>amida</em> prayer between morning, afternoon and evening but on Shabbat it is a different version. The Shabbat <em>amida</em> has the same first three and last three blessings, but only has one blessing in the middle (making it seven blessings instead of nineteen during the week).</p>\n\n<p>You would need a prayer book (<em>siddur</em>) to properly learn and understand the differences. If you don't yet read Hebrew, you can get a transliterated siddur (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578191512.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> from artscroll for weekdays, <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578191505.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for Shabbat and holidays). And <a href=\"http://siddur.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> appears to be a transliterated online siddur (Friday night <a href=\"http://siddur.org/transliterations/friday-night-sabbath-services/shabbat-maariv-amidah#prologue\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>There is also a version of the Shabbat amida on Sefaria, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Ashkenaz%2C_Shabbat%2C_Maariv%2C_Amidah%2C_Patriarchs?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for Friday night, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Ashkenaz%2C_Shabbat%2C_Shacharit%2C_Amidah%2C_Patriarchs?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for Saturday morning.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, nothing beats joining a real Jewish community and asking someone to help you through prayers. Contacting the rabbi in advance is always a good idea so he can pair you up with a friendly congregant. To prepare, take a look at <a href=\"https://njop.org/resources/shabbat/learn-about-shabbat-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this introduction</a> to the Shabbat service from <a href=\"https://njop.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NJOP</a>, incidentally they run <a href=\"https://njop.org/partners/programs/shabbat-beginners-service/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">beginner services</a> in many synagogues where thousands have learned to pray.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck on the journey, welcome to Mi Yodeya and don't hesitate to ask here for further questions. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What was Chazal's understanding of the cause and purpose of menstruation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there a Jewish midrash, kabala, chasiddut or commentary addressing Chazal's understanding of the cause and purpose of menstruation?</p>\n\n<p>Not just that is it a curse, that blood comes out, but with more details. \nFor example, an explanation from which it is also understood why it does not happen before puberty, during pregnancy and nursing, and in old age.\nIs it related with the ability to get pregnant? Some claim that \"before the 19th Century, doctors didn’t realize periods were even linked to ovulation.\" So what was the perspective of Jewish Rabbis?</p>\n\n<p>I am not looking for explanations based on modern science.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=37&daf=9&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Niddah 9a</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא נמי הכי דם נעכר ונעשה חלב דברי ר\"מ רבי יוסי אומר אבריה מתפרקין ואין נפשה חוזרת עליה עד עשרים וארבע חדש א\"ר אלעאי מאי טעמא דר\"מ דכתיב מי יתן טהור מטמא לא אחד</p>\n<p>So it was also taught: The menstrual blood is decomposed and turns into milk; so R.\nMeir. R. Jose stated: Her limbs are disjointed and her natural strength does not return before\ntwenty-four months. R. Elai explained: What is R. Meir's reason? That it is written, Who can\nbring a clean thing49 from out of an unclean? Is it not the Only One? (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/taharoth/Nidah.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Meir is of the opinion that the menstrual blood becomes the milk that a woman produces. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechezkel_Landau\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Ezekiel Landau</a> elaborates on this in his commentary to a different Talmudic passage:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37718&st=&pgnum=20\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tzlach Berachot 10a</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונלע\"ד דההתחלת הפיכת הדם לחלב מתחיל מימי העיבור ולכן גם אז אין הנשים רואות דם כלל והחוש יעיד על זה דרוב הנשים עוברות וכמעט כולם כשמגיעים לחדשים האחרונים הסמוכים ללידה כבר יש להם חלב בדדיהן ומה לי להביא ראיה מן החוש שלנו והדבר מפורש במס' יבמות דף מ\"ב ע\"א דקאמר התם וכי מלו שלשה חדשים לבדוק ופירש רש\"י לבדוק בדדיה כדרך נשים וכו' הרי שדרך נשים עוברות שתיכף כשהוכר העובר יש להם חלב בדדיהן וא\"כ גם פסיקת דם נדה שבימי העיבור הוא משום דדם נעכר ונעשה חלב (וברש\"י במס' בכורות לא משמע כן) ואמנם החלב שבעת ההיא אינו לצורך מזון העיבור בשעתו במעי אמו שהרי אז הוא אוכל ממה שאמו אוכלת ושותה ממה שאמו שותת כמפורש במס' נדה דף ל' ע\"ב אבל הוא הכנה למזונו אחר שיצא לאויר העולם ויצטרך לינק</p>\n<p>And it seems to me that the start of the transformation of the blood to milk begins from the days of pregnancy, and therefore then too women do not see blood at all. And our senses testify to this – most pregnant women, practically all of them, when they reach the later months near the birth they already have milk in their breasts. And what do I need to adduce a proof from our senses? It is explicit in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=42&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Masechet Yevamot 42a</a>, where it says \"when the three months will have been fulfilled she might be examined\" and Rashi explains to examine by her breasts like the way of women etc. Behold the way of pregnant women is that immediately when the fetus is recognizable, they have milk in their breasts. And if so, the cessation of the menstrual blood during the days of pregnancy is because the blood has decomposed and turned into milk (though Rashi in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=32&daf=6b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Masechet Bechorot</a> implies not so). However, the milk of that time is not for the sake of nourishing the fetus during its time in its mother's womb, because at the point it eats from what the mother eats and it drinks from what the mother drinks, as is explained in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=37&daf=30b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Masechet Niddah 30b</a>. Rather, it is a preparation for its nourishment after it exits into the air of the world and needs to nurse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this, one could perhaps argue that the Sages (according to R. Meir) viewed the purpose of the blood as generating milk, and when a woman is not pregnant/nursing and there is no need for the blood to transform into milk, it simply gets discharged as blood. Thus, the purpose of menstruating was to get rid of the unnecessary blood.</p>\n\n\n",

A psalm of David.\" - <em>King David</em> is the person who was wise truly knew to take note of the greatness of Hashem, and so his writings are now to be applied to this later generation.</p>\n<p>I recommend watching the video, where he also explains the reasoning for the slight differences between the similar verses in the chapters.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n<p>I heard a class by Rabbi Uzi Bienenfeld (head of Midreshet Orot Etzion in Israel) on this topic yesterday. Here's a short summary:</p>\n<p>Ch. 60 is a chapter explaining a severe tactical setback during David's war against Amon, Aram and Edom (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.8.13-14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 2:8:13-14</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.10.1-19?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 10:1-19</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.11.15-16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 1:11:15-16</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.18.12-13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:18:12-13</a>).</p>\n<p>One of the contradictions in these descriptions of the battle is the number of fallen. Some verses say 12,000, others say 18,000. And who exactly fell? And why is ch. 60 apparently a criticism of Hashem?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Aramaic_Targum_to_Psalms.60.2?vhe=Mikraot_Gedolot&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Yonatan on Tehillim 60:2</a> explains that when Yoav and Avishai brought their forces to the fortified capital of Amon, the battleplan was to lure Bnei Amon out with two units and have a third unit surprise them from behind. But the third unit never showed up, and so the army was caught between a kind of pincer movement: Amonites on one side and Arameans on the other. Yoav had to think quickly and decided to battle his way out and hope that Hashem would be with them (Shmuel 2:10:11-12). They succeeded, and then Yoav rushed his forces to Yerushalayim to warn David that a third of their military manpower was gone- having disappeared somewhere around Gei Melach, Edomite territory. David assembled the rest of the reservist manpower to launch an attack on Aram (10:17-18). Meanwhile, Yoav took his forces to Gei Melach to see what happened to the third unit. What happened there is explained in Tehillim 60:3-4:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"O God, You have rejected us, You have made a breach in us; You have been angry; restore us! You have made the land quake; You have torn it open. Mend its fissures, for it is collapsing.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that as the unit was heading out of the valley (gei = valley), a massive earthquake occurred (it's in the area of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_Rift\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Red Sea Rift</a>, so tectonic shifts make sense) and everyone died. The 12,000 fallen men were Israelites! A massive blow to Israelite morale, a horrific tragedy. Thanks to Yoav's quick decision-making and David managing to gather more forces quickly, they were able to turn the loss into a decisive victory. And that's how they eventually felled 18,000 Edomites, who were allied with Aram and Amon.</p>\n<p>Ch. 60 opens by stating that this psalm comes to testify and teach. What it comes to testify is regarding the terrible tragedy that occurred, and this only a short time after the Ark was brought to Yerushalayim in a parade that included all of Am Yisrael (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.6.15-19?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 2:6:15-19</a>). Yisrael was at its peak: David was a beloved ruler, everyone was unified behind him, he was ready to build the Mikdash - yet, nevertheless, tragedy struck. What the chapter comes to teach is that we don't always understand the ways of Hashem.</p>\n<p>Ch. 108 is a kind of version B of ch. 60. After David cried out in shock and despair in ch. 60, asking Hashem rhetorically whether He had left Yisrael and noting that nonetheless, Yisrael will continue on with the battle, otherwise they will be overrun and destroyed, ch. 108 was composed after the tremendous victory. David replaced the tragic opening with an opening talking about singing and playing music and praising Hashem, and left the last verses as a reminder of what happened.</p>\n\n\n",

I could not find any mentioning of B\"K's sayings or wisdom in the Talmud, instead, he's only mentioned as a purely military leader, not a Chacham.</p>\n\n<p>First, is there a contradiction in Rambam betweens his first view that the Moshiach should be \"more intelligent than King Salomon\" and R\"Akiva's view that Bar Cochbah was the Moshiach despite his mediocracy?</p>\n\n<p>Second, which way do we hold LeHalachah - should the Moshiach be Gdol Hador or just an exceptional military leader?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.93b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for the six virtues chazzal said Moshiach will have.</p>\n\n<p>משיח דכתיב (ישעיהו יא, ב) ונחה עליו רוח ה' רוח חכמה ובינה רוח עצה וגבורה רוח דעת ויראת ה' וגו' וכתיב (ישעיהו יא, ג) והריחו ביראת ה'</p>\n\n<p>The Messiah was blessed with six virtues, as it is written: “And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord”(Isaiah 11:2); and it is written: “And his delight [vahariḥo] shall be the fear of the Lord, and he shall neither judge after the sight of his eyes, nor decide after the hearing of his ears” (Isaiah 11:3)</p>\n\n<p>I see nothing in your sources that is difficult with any of this. He died for what he did wrong at a later point than when Rabi Akiva assumed he was Moshiach. We can assume Rabi Akiva agreed he wasn't Moshiach once he was killed. We shouldn't assume he had any mediocre traits while in his prime just because nothing is mentioned explicitly.</p>\n\n\n",

If a service has been recited without such concentration, it must be recited again devoutly. If a person finds that his thoughts are confused and his mind is distracted, <strong>he may not pray till he has recovered his mental composure</strong>. Hence, on returning from a journey <strong>or if one is weary or distressed*</strong>, it is forbidden to pray till his mind is composed.

If he did pray, it isn't a real prayer; once he is able to concentrate again, he still has to make it up.</p>\n\n<p>These days, people tend not to put this law into practice.

They simply are a Jew who has certain abilities.</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Precognition (predicting the future)</p></li>\n<li><p>Reading people (Knowing things about people by look or interaction)</p></li>\n<li><p>The ability to heal people</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>How exactly would a Rabbi handle the situation? If the individual is observant and loves Hashem and isn't actively seeking to use their abilities to hurt others, would it be overlooked or would there still be a problem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There have been legends about mekubalim with psychic powers, notably <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/isaac-blind#:%7E:text=Abraham%20ibn%20Gaon%20(1287%E2%80%931330,.%2C%20Va-Yeshev).\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaac the Blind</a> (who was said to be able to \"read people\" as you put it), the <a href=\"https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/699-abulafia-abraham-ben-samuel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abulafia</a> dynasty (who are said to be able to see the future), and the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/379898/jewish/The-Great-Healer.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baal Shem Tov</a> (who was said to be able to heal and spiritually protect people). So, if stories about these tzadikkim having psychic abilities are true, it's probably halachicly permissible, if it comes from Heaven. That means it depends on whether or not the psychic ability came from Sitra Achra or the forces of purity. As neil alluded to, some rabbis are able to tell.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As IsraelReader noted, it's possible to do these things without using prohibited means.  Doctors heal people all the time, we predict the future based on probability, and reading people by how they interact is a normal part of how we relate to each other.</p>\n\n<p>However, you're assuming a case where someone is doing this in a prohibited way.  The answer is it's no different than any other prohibition.  \"If the individual is observant and loves Hashem and isn't actively seeking to use their abilities to hurt others\", then they wouldn't be using these abilities any more than they would be eating at McDonald's.  And if they found it too difficult to refrain from using them, then that would be treated the same way as someone who finds it too difficult to keep kosher - the rabbi would work with them and help them grow in their observance.</p>\n\n<p>(By the way, you don't have to get so exotic.  Precognition by prohibited means could be as simple as using your phone to check the weather on Shabbat.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The \"supernatural\" abilities you listed, aren't necessarily forbidden by the Torah verse you cited from Deut 18:11.</p>\n\n<p>The critical issue the rabbis would be looking for, is whether or not he is also preaching any ideas.

The L-RD is in the right, and I and my people are in\n  the wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He asks them 9 (28)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַעְתִּ֙ירוּ֙ אֶל־ה׳ וְרַ֕ב מִֽהְיֹ֛ת קֹלֹ֥ת אֱלֹהִ֖ים וּבָרָ֑ד\n  וַאֲשַׁלְּחָ֣ה אֶתְכֶ֔ם וְלֹ֥א תֹסִפ֖וּן לַעֲמֹֽד׃ </p>\n  \n  <p>Plead with the LORD that there may be an end of G-d’s thunder and of\n  hail. I will let you go; you need stay no longer.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see that when he sent for them, the plague was still ongoing and continued until Moshe davenned 9 (33)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֵּצֵ֨א מֹשֶׁ֜ה מֵעִ֤ם פַּרְעֹה֙ אֶת־הָעִ֔יר וַיִּפְרֹ֥שׂ כַּפָּ֖יו\n  אֶל־ה׳ וַֽיַּחְדְּל֤וּ הַקֹּלוֹת֙ וְהַבָּרָ֔ד וּמָטָ֖ר לֹא־נִתַּ֥ךְ\n  אָֽרְצָה׃ </p>\n  \n  <p>Leaving Pharaoh, Moses went outside the city and spread out his hands\n  to the LORD: the thunder and the hail ceased, and no rain came pouring\n  down upon the earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How were the messengers to Moshe and Aharon able to get to them through the hail?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.9.29?lang=bi&with=Chizkuni&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Chizkuni on 9 (29)</a> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כצאתי את העיר לפי שאמר למעלה אשר ימצא בשדה וירד עליהם הברד, עכשיו בעת\n  המכה שלא יאמרו ירא הוא לצאת בעבור הברד, אמר כצאתי את העיר אפרש כפי ולא\n  אירא מן הברד. ד״‎א כצאתי מאתך לבא אל העיר, אפרש כפי בתוך העיר. וכן הוא\n  אומר ויצא משה מעם פרעה את העיר וגו'. ד״‎א לפי הפשט מכת ברד נכרת בשדה\n  יותר מבעיר לכך אמר כצאתי את העיר ואראה בשדה השחתת הברד ואתפלל לפי\n  הצורך. </p>\n  \n  <p>1] “as soon as I leave the boundaries of the city;” seeing that\n  earlier the Torah had written (verse 19) that anyone who will still be\n  found outdoors will become a target for the hail, now, at the time\n  when the plague was in full swing, the people might say that Moses was\n  afraid to venture outside on account of that hail, Moses announces\n  that he will open his hands in prayer as soon as he is beyond the\n  borders of the city, and that the hail will not stop him from leaving\n  the city. </p>\n  \n  <p>2] An alternate explanation for this phrase: Moses announces that as\n  soon as he leaves the palace to go into the city, he will spread out\n  his hands in prayer while inside the city. This is also what the Torah\n  reports in verse 33: ויצא משה מעם פרעה את העיר וגו', “as soon as Moses\n  left the presence of Pharaoh and went into the city, etc;”</p>\n  \n  <p>3] Yet another explanation: according to the plain meaning of the text\n  the plague of hail was far stronger in the fields than in the city,\n  [as there were no trees and grain fields inside the city to destroy,\n  Ed.]. This is why Moses boasted that he would brave the hail and then\n  begin his prayer as necessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>From these explanations, it could be suggested that messengers could seek Moshe and Aharon if they were still in the city either without or with reduced risk. </p></li>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%99_%D7%90%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94.html?id=MiYRAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaarei Aharon</a> suggests that the hail was not continuous but intermittent (as in showers) and so it might have been possible to send messengers immediately after a big shower. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

However the author there comments (note 218):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ומסתבר דהיינו מזמן מנחה גדולה שראוי כבר לקרוא את הפרשה החדשה״</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to be explaining the bolded text to mean that one can start Shnayim Mikra immediately after zman mincha gedolah which is the earliest time for the congregation to daven mincha.</p>\n<p>I asked one of my Rabanim who has been and is currently a very close talmid of Rav Avigdor Neventzal Shlit\"a (who was the longest-lasting chavrusa partner of Rav Shlomo Zalman zt\"l) about this quandary and he himself asked Rav Neventzal about it. Rav Neventzal answered that one does not need to actually have davened mincha(neither by himself nor b'tzibur)rather one just needs to start after zman mincha gedolah.

There are those who say they should not live together lest they become repulsed by one another]. Even with couples that are not engaged there is concern, even if they became engaged through relations, he cannot sleep with her a second time in her father's house until he brings her into his house, is secluded with her and separates her for himself, and this seclusion is known as entering into the Chuppah and it is called marriage in all places.

The simple custom nowadays to call the chuppah a place where they place a cloth on poles and bring the groom and bride underneath in public and he engages her there and they say the blessings of engagement and marriage and then they walk them to their house and they eat together in a secluded places, this is how the chuppah is done now.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Today's custom: we basically follow exactly what the Rama says in the above link <strong>[ie groom must bring her into his house, spreading a cloth over her head at the time of the blessing, say blessings of engagement/ marriage under the <em>chuppah</em>]</strong>, but we generally use a mix of everything to cover all bases. Many weddings do a <em>badeiken</em> which according to some is also considered a form of <em>nisuin</em>. We also go under a canopy which represents the husbands domain. Sefardim use a <em>talis</em> which also represents the husband taking his wife into his domain. Then after the chuppah the couple goes into a yichud room in order to satisfy the opinion that the couple needs to be secluded alone in a place where relations can happen.</p>\n\n<p>Additional <em>mekoros</em> of what exactly constitutes <em>nisuin</em> (from YU Student Organization):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lhXO5.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n\n",

I had been under the impression that the river stayed as blood for a week, which led me to ask <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/38359/472\">where the magicians got water for their trick</a>, and from answers there, R' Shor's view isn't universal.</p>\n<p>If the Nile turned to blood only briefly and then turned back as R' Shor says, then what happened in the following week, where the text tells us (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0207.htm#25\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shemot 7:25</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּמָּלֵא, שִׁבְעַת יָמִים, אַחֲרֵי הַכּוֹת-יְהוָה, אֶת-הַיְאֹר.</p>\n<p>And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It doesn't seem to be saying merely that seven days <em>passed uneventfully</em>; the text says וַיִּמָּלֵא, which JPS translates as \"were fulfilled\", rather than something more passive like וַיְהִי.  It sounds to me like something happened at the end of the seven days.</p>\n<p>What was it that happened?  According to the R' Shor view, did it take seven days for the dead fish to clear so the water was usable again?  Or does the text just mean that seven days passed before preparations for the next plague began, and in fact it is more passive (just that time passed)?  Or does the text mean that the river stayed as blood, contrary to R' Shor?</p>\n<p>R' Shor doesn't comment on that verse and the person who provided one of those answers didn't know how he handles this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Ramban connects the seven days mentioned concerning this maka to the need to dig for fresh water in the passuk beforehand.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ופסוק וימלא שבעת ימים קשור בעליון, וימלא בזה שבעת ימים, שחפרו מצרים סביבות היאור ולא יכלו לשתות ממימי היאור עד מלאת שבעת ימים אחרי ההכאה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Shor, while not making this direct statement, did also mention that the digging was done in order to find fresh water that didn't have rotting fish in it</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויחפרו. לעשות מעיינות להם שלא יהיו שם דגים ולא יבאשו אותם מנבלת דגים:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is important as they seem to side with Ibn Ezra at least in the point that fresh water was available to Egyptians who dug for it. In contrast to the medrashic approach assuming no Egyptian had access to fresh water unless bought from the Jews.</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Acha Karchina'a challenges this, based on the fact that revenge is also mentioned between two of God's names.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מתקיף לה רב אחא קרחינאה אלא מעתה גדולה נקמה שנתנה בין שתי אותיות שנאמר אל נקמות ה׳</p>\n<p>Rav Aḥa Karḥina’a strongly objects to this: However, if so, Great is revenge that was placed between two letters, as it is stated: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance shine forth” (Psalms 94:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His interlocutor (I assume Rav Ami) responds to the problem by saying that even though it can be bad, revenge is indeed a great thing in certain cases.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ליה אין במילתה מיהא גדולה היא והיינו דאמר עולא שתי נקמות הללו למה אחת לטובה ואחת לרעה לטובה דכתיב הופיע מהר פארן לרעה דכתיב אל נקמות ה׳ אל נקמות הופיע</p>\n<p>He said to him: Yes. At least in its place, it is great. That is that which Ulla said: Why are these two vengeances mentioned in a single verse? One for good and one for evil. Vengeance for good, as it is written: “He shined forth from Mount Paran” (Deuteronomy 33:2); vengeance for evil, as it is written: “God of vengeance, Lord, God of vengeance shine forth.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To cite two examples where we <em>are</em> obligated to take revenge:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.31.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Numbers 31:2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נְקֹ֗ם נִקְמַת֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל מֵאֵ֖ת הַמִּדְיָנִ֑ים אַחַ֖ר תֵּאָסֵ֥ף אֶל־עַמֶּֽיךָ׃</p>\n<p>“Avenge the Israelite people on the Midianites; then you shall be gathered to your kin.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.22b.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoma 22b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמר רבי יוחנן משום ר' שמעון בן יהוצדק כל תלמיד חכם שאינו נוקם ונוטר כנחש אינו תלמיד חכם</p>\n<p>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: Any Torah scholar who does not avenge himself and bear a grudge like a snake is not a Torah scholar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it's the third statement which is incorrect (or rather, only partially correct).

Is this some new \"fashion\" in Modern Hebrew?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It is the plural of respect. Think of Shalom Aleichem, which you say to an individual.</p>\n<p>I will (now) add that this is a common feature of many languages. While not true for Biblical Hebrew (though there is the plural of mastery), looking at the entry on T-V distinction on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yiddish makes use of the second person plural form as the polite form for both singular and plural. In the second person plural form איר (ir), there is therefore no distinction between formal and informal forms. There is a dialectal pronoun עץ (ets) strictly for informal second-person plural form, but this pronoun is rarely used today and is only found in some dialects of Poland and neighboring regions.</p>\n<p>Given that old German dialects were the main influence on the development of the Yiddish language, this form may be recognized with older polite forms of the German language.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it might well be an influence of Yiddish, which indeed could exist more in more religious circles.</p>\n<p>It <em>could</em> also be influence from Arabic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Modern Standard Arabic uses the majestic plural form of the second person (أنتم antum) in respectful address.[citation needed] It is restricted to highly formal contexts, generally relating to politics and government. However, several varieties of Arabic have a clearer T–V distinction. The most developed is in Egyptian Arabic, which uses حضرتك ḥaḍritak (literally, \"Your Grace\"), سعادتك sa‘adtak and سيادتك siyadtak (literally, \"Your Lordship\") as the \"V\" terms, depending on context, while أنت inta is the \"T\" term. Ḥaḍritak is the most usual \"V\" term, with sa‘adtak and siyadtak being reserved for situations where the addressee is of very high social standing (e.g. a high-ranking government official or a powerful businessman). Finally, the \"V\" term is used only with social superiors (including elders); unfamiliar people perceived to be of similar or lower social standing to the speaker are addressed with the T term inta.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding Hebrew, they have this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In modern Hebrew, there is a T–V distinction used in a set of very formal occasions, for example, a lawyer addressing a judge, or when speaking to rabbis. The second person singular אַתָּה (ʔaˈta, masculine) or אַתְּ (ʔat, feminine) are the usual form of address in all other situations, e.g. when addressing ministers or members of the Knesset.</p>\n<p>The formal form of address when speaking to a person of higher authority is the third person singular using the person's title without the use of the pronoun. Thus, a rabbi could be asked: ?כְּבוֹד הָרַב יִרְצֶה לֶאֱכֹל (kəˈvod haˈʁav yiʁˈtse leʔeˈχol', \"would the honorable rabbi like to eat?\") or a judge told: כְּבוֹדוֹ דָּן בְּבַקָּשָׁתִי (kəvoˈdo dan bəvakaʃaˈti, \"his honour is considering my request\").</p>\n<p>Other persons of authority are normally addressed by their title only, rather than by name, using the second person singular. For example, officers and commanders in the army are addressed as הַמְּפַקֵּד (haməfaˈked, \"the commander\") by troops.</p>\n<p>In non-Hebrew-speaking Jewish culture, the second-person form of address is similarly avoided in cases of higher authority (e.g., a student in a yeshiva would be far more likely to say in a classroom discussion \"yesterday the Rav told us...\" than \"yesterday you told us...\"). However, this usage is limited to more conservative (i.e. Orthodox) circles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

OR Were they in Egypt 240 years?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rashi comments on the apparent discrepancy between numbers</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS — Altogether from the birth of Isaac until now were 400 years, and we must reckon from that event, for only from the time when Abraham had offspring from Sarah could the prophecy (Genesis 15:13) “Thy offspring shall be a stranger” be fulfilled; and there had been 30 years since that decree made at “the convenant between the parts” until the birth of Isaac. It is impossible to say that this means that they were 430 years in the land of Egypt alone, for Kohath was one of those who came into Egypt with Jacob (Genesis 46:11); go and reckon all his years and all the years of Amram his son and the whole eighty years of Moses, the latter’s son, until the Exodus and you will not find that they total to so many; and you must admit that Kohath had already lived many years before he went down to Egypt, and that many of Amram’s years are included in the years of his father Kohath, and that many of the 80 years of Moses are included in the years of his father Amram, so that you see that you will not find 400 years from the time of Israel’s coming into Egypt until the Exodus. You are compelled to admit, even though unwillingly, that the other settlements which the patriarchs made in lands other than Egypt come also under the name of “sojourning as a stranger” (גרות), including also that at Hebron, even though it was in Canaan itself, because it is said, (Genesis 35:27) “[Hebron] where Abraham and Isaac sojourned”, and it says, (Exodus 6:4) “[the land Canaan], the land of their sojournings wherein they sojourned”. Consequently you must necessarily say that the prophecy, “thy offspring shall be strangers… [four hundred years]” began only from the time when he had offspring. And only if you reckon the 400 years from the birth of Isaac will you find that from the time they came into Egypt until the time they left it, was 210 years (as alluded to in Genesis 15:13). This was one of the passages which they altered for king Ptolemy (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 12:40; Megillah 9a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ibn Ezra explains the 430 as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מיום שיצא אברהם אביהם מארץ מולדתו\n  From the day when Avraham Avinu left the land of his birth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Sforno wrotes,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the sum of 430 is arrived at by commencing the count from the time G’d took Avraham out of Ur Casdim in order to conclude the covenant of the pieces with him. During that conversation with Avraham, G’d had specifically taken credit for taking Avraham out of Ur Casdim, (generally understood as saving him from the fire of Nimrod’s furnace when Avraham had been a voluntary martyr for his belief in the G’d of heaven. Genesis 15,7) This is the reason why the author of Seder Olam, an ancient historical text, describes Avraham as having been 70 years old at that time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are many other explanations and computations details the commentators' various positions on exactly what each of the numbers refers to and when that particular measure starts and stops.</p>\n\n<p>Check through the commentaries at <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.40?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.40?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en</a></p>\n\n<p>Note -- this answers the WHAT in your question, but not the underlying \"why\" in your title -- why the text would be imprecise, or confusingly precise is a separate question.</p>\n\n\n",

This may be reconciled that one died childless and therefore, he was not mentioned there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How does Rashi draw this conclusion?

    "content": "# If a Mesorah for letter pronunciation is rediscovered, would we have to change our pronunciations?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Let's say that someone finds some historical evidence that a particular system of pronunciations, whether it be currently extant or not, is the one which Klal Yisrael used at the time of Kabalas HaTorah. Let's further assume that this evidence is absolutely indisputable and everyone from all sects of Judaism are able to agree on its accuracy.<sup>1</sup> </p>\n\n<p>Would we all have to change our pronunciations accordingly? For instance, if the evidence supports, say, the Yemenite tradition, will we all have to begin saying Berachos and leining and whatnot with that tradition? Or does the minhag that has been accepted by the various communities override any evidence to the contrary? Would it depend on the halacha it's being applied to (ex. Torah requirements like saying Shema would have to change, but you can say Rabbinic berachos however you want)?</p>\n\n<p><sup><sup>1</sup>What would such evidence be? I don't know. You should be able to tell it's a theoretical question just from the fact that everyone is able to agree on its accuracy.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּי-אָז אֶהְפֹּךְ אֶל-עַמִּים, שָׂפָה בְרוּרָה, לִקְרֹא כֻלָּם בְּשֵׁם יְהוָה, לְעָבְדוֹ שְׁכֶם אֶחָד.

None of these sources address your <em>exact</em> formulation, but the implication from all of them is that were that pronunciation actually known, it would be objectively best and conclude any inter-communal debate and that there is value to working to fix mistakes that crept into different communities. Since the evidence you propose seemingly doesn't actually exist, these sources generally limit themselves to various specific cases, generally consonants, where they feel there is sufficient evidence already, if any, and recommend following your custom for all debatable cases. CYLOGrammarian.</p>\n\n<p>Two caveats:</p>\n\n<p>1) Unless the evidence also provides a magic way for everyone to change, it's just not going to happen. Changing completely takes years and years of hard monotonous work and requires significant mental acuity. Thus I say \"should\" because for most adults it won't be practical or worth the effort (like R' Yaakov Emden <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22431&st=&pgnum=10\" rel=\"noreferrer\">wrote</a> \"one should be careful to pronounce the letters distinctly, not like us Ashkenazim who pronounce ת like ס to our embarrassment; but one who didn't grow up with the distinctions from his youth it is impossible to bother him with the great burden to change, and his loss will be greater than his gain\"). You shouldn't be surprised that you don't see everyone changing things now even with various pretty conclusive mistakes known. This is an old problem. The more realistic thing is to do is to properly train the schoolchildren (like R' YE Henkin writes that Ashkenazim in America should hire Sefardi school teachers to teach their young children the various guttural consonant sounds).</p>\n\n<p>2) The target goal here need not be how Moshe spoke but may be how Hebrew was spoken with the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/22586/759\">codification of Tanakh (if those are different)</a>. Just as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/18735/759\">we follow the Halakha of the Sanhedrin/Talmud Bavli against Moshe</a>, for Tanakh we follow the [western \"Ben Asher\"] Masorah (even <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/11290/759\">against the Talmud</a>), and the system of vowel marks we have is clearly reflective of an underlying system of consonant sounds (through phenomena like furtive patach, dagesh lene, or composite shva). If you throw out the Tiberian pronunciation, you throw out any tradition of how to read anything.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>BeMareh HaBazaq 3:1</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רוב רובם של פוסקי זמננו הסכימו שלכתחילה עדיף, שכל מתפלל יחזיק במנהג אבותיו...‏  </p>\n  \n  <p>יוצאים מכלל זה אותן האותיות שברור הוא, שהגייתו אותן משובשת (למשל חי\"ת ועי\"ן שהאשכנזים מבטאים אותן בדרך כלל\n  ככ\"ף ואל\"ף)‏\n  שבהן עדיף לאמץ את ההגיה, שברור כי היא נכונה ‏\n  <sup>4</sup>.‏<br>\n  אמנם, לרוב בני-אדם מאד קשה להחליף באחרת את הגיית התפילה שבה הם רגילים להתפלל. ועל כן, אם נסיון החזרה להגיית\n  אבותיו יגרום לו לתערובת הגיות ולתפילה מבולבלת, באמת עדיף להמשיך להתפלל בהגיה שאליה הוא רגיל, למרות שאינה הגיית\n  אבותיו.‏  </p>\n  \n  <p><sup>4</sup>\n   הגרי\"א הענקין (שם) שו\"ת ישכיל עבדי\" (שם ובח\"ד או\"ח סי ג) וכן הורה הגרש\"ז אויערבאך, אבל הדגיש שאין צריך להתאמץ בעניין. ועיי\"ש בשו\"ת ישכיל\n  עבדי (ח\"ב אות ז) שכתב \"שאין בזה משום מוציא לעז על הראשונים ח\"ו דהראשונים לא נהגו בזה מרצונם... שאם היתה להם היכולת בזמניהם לעמוד על\n  אמיתות תורת הלשון בנימוקו וטעמו, ודאי שהיו שמחים כמוצא שלל רב לתקן מבטאם ולשונם...\".‏<br>\n   אבל יש לנקוט זהירות יתירה כאשר קובעים, שפרט מסוים בטעות יסודו, כי בהרבה פרטים ה\"ידועים\" כטעויות יש באמת חילוקי-דעות בין גדולי המדקדקים, ורק\n  במקום שכולם מסכימים בוודאות, שפרט מסוים אינו מקורי, נראה שיש לסמוך עליהם; ושלא כמשמעות ה\"אורח משפט\" (שם עמ' ה,כג) \"משפטי עוזיאל\" (סוף\n  התשובה שם ה) \"אגרות משה\" (או\"ח ח\"ג סי ה') ומנחת יצחק (ח\"ד סי' מז). אבל על כל פנים ברור הוא שיש להתייעץ עם מדקדקים ובלשנים מקצועיים,\n  שיראתם לשמים קודמת לחכמתם.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The vast majority of the Poskim of this generation agreed that ideally one who prays should stick to the pronunciation of his ancestors... The exception to this is those letters where it is clear that their pronunciation is faulty (such as ח and ע that Ashkenazim generally pronounce like כ and א) that for them it is best to strengthen the pronunciation that it is clear is correct.<br>\n  However for most people it is very difficult to change their manner of pronunciation for another. Therefore, if attempting to change will lead to inconsistent and confused prayers, in truth it is preferable to continue to pray in the manner he is accustomed to, even if it isn't his ancestors'.<br>\n  But one must be exceptionally careful when deciding what is a mistake, for many things \"known\" as mistakes are actually subject to disagreement among grammarians, and only in a place where everyone agrees it is a mistake can one rely on them. And it is clear that one should consult expert grammarians and linguists whose fear of Heaven precedes their knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

[73] Your enemy will place an iron yoke upon your neck, working you until he has destroyed you.</p>\n<p>49 [74] God will bring upon you a nation from afar, from the end of the earth, who will conquer you unexpectedly, successfully, and quickly, the way the eagle swoops down upon its prey. It will be a nation whose language you will not understand,</p>\n<p>50 a brazen nation who neither respects the elderly nor shows favor to the young.</p>\n<p>51 [75] They will devour your animals, the fruit of your livestock, [76] and your produce, the fruit of your soil, [77] until they destroy you through starvation.

[87] You will be uprooted from the land that you are entering in order to possess.</p>\n<p>64 [88] God will scatter you among all the nations, from one end of the earth to the other, and there [89] you will serve these nations, who serve other deities that were unknown to you or your forefathers—deities of wood and stone—by paying tribute and poll taxes to pagan priests.</p>\n<p>65 [90] You will find no respite among those nations, [91] nor will your foot find any rest. [92] There, God will give you a frightened, trembling heart, [93] dashed hopes, [94] and a depressed soul.</p>\n<p>66 [95] Your life will hang in suspense before you:80 you will live in daily fear both for your very life and for your livelihood, for you will be dependent on the availability of food in an unstable market. [96] You will be afraid night and day, [97] and since you will be dependent on bakeries for bread, which will in turn rely on an unreliable economy, you will not believe in the reliability of your own life.</p>\n<p>68 [98] God will bring you back to Egypt, which in itself will be traumatic since your worst memories are of your captivity in Egypt, but in addition—for as much of the journey as possible—you will return thereas captives in slave-ships, in which captives suffer greater subjugation to their captors than they do when transported overland. For the rest of the journey, which cannot be made by sea, you will return overland via the route you took leaving Egypt: through the huge and awesome desert filled with snakes, vipers, and scorpions, plagued by drought and devoid of water.81 This is the path about which I promised you and said to you, ‘You will never see it again’82 because you were so traumatized by its memory. There, your slavery will be so insufferable that you will beg your captors to let you offer yourselves for sale to your other enemies as slaves and bondwomen rather than serve them, in the hope that your other enemies will not treat you as badly as your captors; but there will be no buyer among your other enemies, for your original captors will have already sentenced you to death and annihilation.”83</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why for a divorce does a woman do many different actions, but doesn't do them for Kiddushin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've witnessed the giving of a get, and it has many steps (the below bulletpoints are adapted <a href=\"https://www.itim.org.il/en/get-divorce-ceremony/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">from here</a>). For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the woman accepts the folded get into her cupped hands grasping it.</li>\n<li>The woman then raises her hands, while holding the get, about 30 centimeters high. This act called ‘hagbahah (raising)’, serves as a symbolic legal act of transfer of ownership. </li>\n<li>After the hagbahah, the woman places the get under her left armpit, next to her heart</li>\n<li>takes 2-3 steps forwards</li>\n<li>turns around, and retraces her steps (walking a total of 4 amot) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Presumably all of this is done because we're Machmirim and want to make sure the giving of the get was <em>chal</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Why aren't we also this level of machmir for <em>kinyan kiddushin</em>? Namely, instead of just putting the ring on the kallah's finger, why doesn't she also do all these additional kinyanim that we do for a get?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>As noted by @joelk in a comment, if the <em>kiddushin</em> (engagement) are not valid, there is a <em>bitul aseh</em> (annulment of a positive commandment; see <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/952874/jewish/Ishut-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Laws of Marriage 1</a>:1-2) or, at worst*, no marriage (see, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/26403\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).  If, however, the giving of the get is invalid, every subsequent act of intimacy between the woman and any future \"husband\" is a capital crime for both, and any descendant that results from such act is a <em>mamzer</em>, forbidden to marry into Israel for all future generations.  As such, we try to (at least <em>l'chatchila</em> - ideally) keep stringencies and/or minority opinions, to avoid complications down the road.</p>\n\n<p>[In addition (and as per a comment from @DoubleAA), see, e.g. <a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/2009/hain1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shmuel Hain</a> who draws a more fundamental distinction between the act of <em>kiddushin</em> and that of divorce.  Thus, according to some opinions (see e.g. <em>Avnei Miluim</em> 30:1 and <em>Mishne L'Melech</em> <em>Ishut</em> 1:1) <em>kiddushin</em> may be valid even in cases where <em>gittin</em> are not.]</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*except in the very unlikely scenario where she accepts <em>kiddushin</em> from another man while assuming she is already married - though even then, the <em>chupa</em> alone, and/or subsequent consummation of the \"first\" marriage, may have been enough effect the first marriage, thereby preempting the second (<a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/26403\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>id</em></a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Years ago I saw the Nesivos Shlom explains Har Gegegos using this Ran, Nedarim (30a), s.v. vi’Isha Nami  (.ר”ן נדרים (ל (it should answer your question)</p>\n\n<p>אלא כיון שהתורה אמרה כי יקח איש אשה ולא אמרה כי תלקח אשה לאיש לא כל הימנה שתכניס עצמה לרשות הבעל ומש”ה אמרי’ בפ”ק דקידושין (דף ה) דאי אמרה היא הריני מאורסת לך אין בדבריה ממש אלא מכיון שהיא מסכמת לקדושי האיש היא מבטלת דעתה ורצונה ומשוי נפשה אצל הבעל כדבר של הפקר והבעל מכניסה לרשותו הלכך אין אנו דנין בקדושין מצד האשה אלא מצד הבעל</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ran states that the woman must be totally passive.

    "content": "# Did the Israelites leave Egypt in haste or not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>(1) The Talmud says: \"[It was also taught in the baraita]: On Rosh HaShana our forefathers’ slavery in Egypt ceased. [From where is this known?] It is written : “And I will bring you out from under the burdens of Egypt” (Exodus 6:6); and it is written [with regard to Joseph]: “I removed his shoulder from the burden” (Ps. 81:7). [By verbal analogy of the word “burden”, just as Joseph was released from prison in Tishrei, so the slavery ended in Tishrei.]\" [Rosh Hashanah 11b]</p>\n\n<p>So we stayed in Egypt 7-8 months between being released from slavery and leaving for the Promised Land.</p>\n\n<p>(2) Yet the Torah tells us we left Egypt in haste, and the symbol of the Exodus is the matzah -- the bread that did not have time to rise because we left in haste.  In this week's Torah portion, Bo, we read: וּשְׁמַרְתֶּם אֶת-הַמַּצּוֹת\nAnd you shall watch over the matzot. [Ex. 12:17] The Maharal says that the lesson of the haste is that God Himself (and not human or natural forces) took us out of Egypt. God makes things happen very fast.  We emphasize this in the Haggadah:</p>\n\n<p>\"I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night – I, and not an angel.\nAnd I will slay all the firstborn in the land of Egypt – I and not a seraph. \nAnd I will execute judgment upon all the gods of Egypt– I and not a messenger.\nI, God – it is I and no other.\" [Pessah Haggadah]</p>\n\n<p>By remembering the swiftness of the exodus, we remember that God made it happen, whence the centrality of the matzah -- as opposed to the other symbols.</p>\n\n<p>-So: How do we reconcile these two teachings?  [Note that the first is a derivation, not a tradition passed down as fact.]</p>\n\n\n",

From this union came Peretz (Bereishis 38:15-29), the forebear of David HaMelech (Rus 4:18-22). </p>\n\n<p>On the other side of the family, we have Rus, a descendant of Moav. He was born from the union of Lot with his eldest daughter (Bereishis 19:36-37).</p>\n\n<p>Continuing down the line, David himself married Bas Sheva, after seeing her beauty and sending her husband Uriah to the front lines of the war to be killed in battle such that she would be single (Shmuel 2:11:2-27). From this union came Shlomo HaMelech (ibid. 12:24). </p>\n\n<p>David’s lineage was called into question by Doeg HaEdomi, until it was confirmed that a female Moavite convert is not prohibited (Yevamos 76b-77a). </p>\n\n<p>David himself was thought to have been born from the union between Yishai and his maidservant, rather than his actual wife (Me’am Loez to Shmuel 1:16:11; cf. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/95052/\">here</a>). </p>\n\n<p>Shlomo himself married Ne’amah, a descendant of Ben-Ami, the son of Lot with his <em>other</em> daughter (Bereishis 19:36,38). Ne’amah went on to be the mother of Rechavam (Melachim 1:14:21). </p>\n\n<p>All of these incidents were either technically permitted or at least done for noble causes, yet smack of something illicit. David married a single woman, after her husband was killed as rebelling against the king (Kiddushin 43a), yet was reprimanded for it (Shmuel 2 ch. 12). Yehudah, even if he didn’t know it, was fulfilling the mitzvah of Yibum, yet thought that he was being intimate with a harlot. And Lot’s daughters are praised for their actions, as they thought that the world had been destroyed and it was up to them to continue the human race, but at the same time, their actions are termed “sins” for Heaven’s sake (Horayos 10b-11a). While Rus was allowed to marry into the congregation, it wasn’t without controversy. And David’s mother wasn’t confirmed to even be permitted to his father until the truth came out that she wasn’t a maidservant. </p>\n\n<p>Why must the Davidic dynasty come from such a background?

In fact, the Talmud tells us: Why was humanity derived from a single couple, Adam and Eve?  So that no one should be able to tell his neighbor, \"My ancestors were better than your ancestors\".

The Talmud says, in Sanhedrin 98a, “The son of David [i.e., the Messiah] will come only in a generation that is entirely wicked.”  David is the archetype for the messianic soul because he showed how to make repentance into a life principle…  And just that is the realization of ultimate fulfillment – that the root of evil will be transformed to good…  At that time, the lowest will become the highest.”</em></p>\n\n<p>(Actually, a direct check show that Sanhedrin 98a says:  “Rabbi Yohanan also said: The son of David will come only in a generation that is entirely wicked <strong>or entirely righteous</strong>.”)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>As the frumteens Rav wrote:  (i'm paraphrasing from my memory of what he wrote)  The satan is always poised to foil the ultimate purpose of Creation, which is the coming of Moshiach and the resulting acceptance of the Kingdom of Hashem upon all humanity.  The satan will do anything to stop this ultimate victory of God's universal recognition and malchus.  In order to fool the Satan, and so he wouldn't interfere with the coming of Moshiach, which is the ultimate good, and thus Satan's chief adversary, God made it so that the unions that would ultimately produce moshiach would appear to be improper, so that the Satan would never suspect that these unions were the forerunners of Moshiach, so he wouldn't interfere with them.</p>\n\n\n",

During this time his brother Aharon left the main city in Mitzraim and traveled towards Midian. The meeting occurred on Mt. Sinai. Thus, the distance from Pi-Rameses to Mt. Sinai must be twice as long as the distance from Mt. Sinai to Midian. If we make adjustment for the fact that Moshe's travel with sheep and then with his family was slower than that of Aharon, we would have to count the 2:1 relation roughly from Mecca! R' Hool uses this relation to identify a possible candidate for Mt. Sinai as <a href=\"https://doubtingthomasresearch.com/jabal-harb-mount-sinai-saudi-arabia/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jabal Harb</a> (1), which has a similar name as חורב.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>R' Hool assumed that Pi-Rameses was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelusium\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pelusium</a> on the Mediterranean Coast, which makes a small impact on the calculation result.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was a king necessary in the first place?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When Moshe led the Jewish people, there came a time where he spoke with Hashem and asked for him to relieve his burden. He needed help with the responsibility that had been placed upon him.</p>\n\n<p>This led to the 70 elders being gathered who would all share in the burden so Moshe wouldn't have to carry it alone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where did a king fit into any of this and wouldn't a king have been problematic from the Jewish perspective?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Sanhedrin existed as a series of councils which dealt with everyday matters and deeper religious matters.</p>\n\n<p>In theory, we could have existed entirely independent from kings/royalty and Jewish society would have functioned through the guidance of the Rabbis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here is where the question ultimately comes from.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Kings can be inherently problematic. If you look at the history of monarchies in Europe, you see that kings place themselves as being equal to the authority of god in a certain respect. <strong><em>The idea being that god made them king so gods authority is his authority.</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p><em>We saw this go down with King James and the church of England.</em> </p>\n\n<p>We even saw how the politics of the situation could damage the structure of society. Specifically, the divide that occurred between Judah and the Northern Kingdom. </p>\n\n<p>My question is why was a king necessary? Didn't the Jewish people have structures in place which could have met the everyday functions of Jewish society? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I personally think the reason is explicitly presented in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.3.2?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 3,1</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"רַבִּי חֲנִינָא סְגַן הַכֹּהֲנִים אוֹמֵר, הֱוֵי מִתְפַּלֵּל בִּשְׁלוֹמָהּ שֶׁל מַלְכוּת,<br>\n  שֶׁאִלְמָלֵא מוֹרָאָהּ, אִישׁ אֶת רֵעֵהוּ חַיִּים בְּלָעוֹ.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Rabbi Chanina, the Deputy High Priest, says: Pray for the welfare of the government, for were it not for the fear of it, man would swallow his fellow alive.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, the fear that the egoistically evil nature of humans will ultimately lead to mass destruction obligates them to appoint a government whose purpose is to restrain and streamline their urges into positive coexistence.</p>\n\n<p>This need [for self-preservation] is so strong, that the people are not only willing to forgo their property as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.8?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 8</a>, where he lists the 30 rights of the King: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"וַיֹּאמֶר זֶה יִהְיֶה מִשְׁפַּט הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר יִמְלֹךְ עֲלֵיכֶם:<br>\n  אֶת־בְּנֵיכֶם יִקָּח וְשָׂם לוֹ בְּמֶרְכַּבְתּוֹ וּבְפָרָשָׁיו וְרָצוּ לִפְנֵי מֶרְכַּבְתּוֹ׃<br>\n  וְלָשׂוּם לוֹ שָׂרֵי אֲלָפִים וְשָׂרֵי חֲמִשִּׁים וְלַחֲרֹשׁ חֲרִישׁוֹ<br>\n  וְלִקְצֹר קְצִירוֹ וְלַעֲשׂוֹת כְּלֵי־מִלְחַמְתּוֹ וּכְלֵי רִכְבּוֹ׃<br>\n  וְאֶת־בְּנוֹתֵיכֶם יִקָּח לְרַקָּחוֹת וּלְטַבָּחוֹת וּלְאֹפוֹת׃<br>\n  וְאֶת־שְׂדוֹתֵיכֶם וְאֶת־כַּרְמֵיכֶם וְזֵיתֵיכֶם הַטּוֹבִים יִקָּח וְנָתַן לַעֲבָדָיו׃<br>\n  וְזַרְעֵיכֶם וְכַרְמֵיכֶם יַעְשֹׂר וְנָתַן לְסָרִיסָיו וְלַעֲבָדָיו׃<br>\n  וְאֶת־עַבְדֵיכֶם וְאֶת־שִׁפְחוֹתֵיכֶם וְאֶת־בַּחוּרֵיכֶם הַטּוֹבִים<br>\n  וְאֶת־חֲמוֹרֵיכֶם יִקָּח וְעָשָׂה לִמְלַאכְתּוֹ׃<br>\n  צֹאנְכֶם יַעְשֹׂר וְאַתֶּם תִּהְיוּ־לוֹ לַעֲבָדִים׃\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But even sacrifice their lives, either by willingly go to a war that a King declares or to let him \"to execute anyone who rebels against a king.\" (Rambam Melachim 3,8) without a trial or any intervention from Sanhedrin.</p>\n\n<p>It appears to me (after studying Masechet Sanhedrin) that, by following the principle of \"לא בשמים היא\", throughout the Jewish History a king (or a king-like Judge or prophet) took precedence over Sanhedrin (if ever existing) in all aspect of general conduct. (I think the common phrase \"X and his court\" - \"דוד ובית דינו\" and not \"דוד וסנהדרין\" is a proof that they took over the Sanhedrin even in setting Halochos).</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Korach never speaks independently, why?",
    "content": "# Korach never speaks independently, why?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A plain reading of Bamidbar chapter 16 suggests that Korach was basically silent in the whole \"episode of Korach\". However, Chazal and the midrash explain, at length, about Korach's involvement and his instigation of the rebellion against the extant leadership.</p>\n<p>The only utterance of Korach, however, is in Badmidbar 16:3, where Korach speaks collectively with 'Datan and Aviram' and 'On ben Pelet'. This is the only time he speaks (14 words), and he speaks along with the others mentioned:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּקָּהֲלוּ עַל-מֹשֶׁה וְעַל-אַהֲרֹן, וַיֹּאמְרוּ אֲלֵהֶם רַב-לָכֶם--כִּי כָל-הָעֵדָה כֻּלָּם קְדֹשִׁים, וּבְתוֹכָם יְהוָה; וּמַדּוּעַ תִּתְנַשְּׂאוּ, עַל-קְהַל יְהוָה</p>\n<p>They gathered unto Moshe and Aharon and said to them: \"You have gone too far! For all the community are holy, all of them, and the LORD is in their midst. Why then do you raise yourselves above the LORD’s congregation?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other than this collective rebuke against Moshe and Aharon, Korach is silent. The narrative text suggests that it was \"Korach and his congregation\" (ibid 16:10) that were the responsible party; however, Korach never speaks. In fact, it is Datan and Aviram who are presented as the most rebellious by refusing the call of Moshe (16:12 \"וַיֹּאמְרוּ, לֹא נַעֲלֶה\") and then say (16:13-14):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַמְעַט, כִּי הֶעֱלִיתָנוּ מֵאֶרֶץ זָבַת חָלָב וּדְבַשׁ, לַהֲמִיתֵנוּ, בַּמִּדְבָּר:  כִּי-תִשְׂתָּרֵר עָלֵינוּ, גַּם-הִשְׂתָּרֵר.\nאַ֡ף לֹ֣א אֶל־אֶרֶץ֩ זָבַ֨ת חָלָ֤ב וּדְבַשׁ֙ הֲבִ֣יאֹתָ֔נוּ וַתִּ֨תֶּן־לָ֔נוּ נַחֲלַ֖ת שָׂדֶ֣ה וָכָ֑רֶם הַעֵינֵ֞י הָאֲנָשִׁ֥ים הָהֵ֛ם תְּנַקֵּ֖ר לֹ֥א נַעֲלֶֽה׃</p>\n<p>(13) Is it not enough that you brought us from a land flowing with milk and honey to have us die in the wilderness, that you would also lord it over us? (14) Even if you had brought us to a land flowing with milk and honey, and given us possession of fields and vineyards, should you gouge out those men’s eyes? We will not come!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was surprised, when reading this passage again, that Korach doesn't say anything independently. Especially since he is considered the primary cause of the rebellion. Do any commentaries explain the silence of Korach?</p>\n\n\n",

Bar Kappara gave one of the students permission to recite a blessing. He hurried and recited a blessing over the pullets and his counterpart ridiculed him for gluttonously reciting the blessing that should have been recited later, first. Bar Kappara became angry with both of them, he said: I am not angry with the one who recited the blessing, but at the one who ridiculed him. If your counterpart is like one who never tasted the flavor of meat and was therefore partial to the pullet, and hurriedly ate it, why did you ridicule him? Bar Kappara continued and said to the second student: I am not upset at the one who ridiculed him, rather it is with the one who recited the blessing that I am angry. And he said: If there is no wisdom here, is there no elder here? If you are uncertain which blessing to recite first, couldn’t you have asked me, as I am an elder?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The student had a preference for meat, which caused him to say shehakol first. Yes, describing him as \"like one who never tasted the flavor of meat and was therefore partial to the pullet\" seems somewhat negative, in the sense of being unrefined, but it is not a criticism because of the resultant halachic repercussions. And bar Kappara felt that ridicule of the student was unwarranted.</p>\n\n<p>That is just my subjective reading of this source, though.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You address several rules.

The ykar of the mixture is not necessarily the component that is in greater amount.

(from the op-cit Mishna 44a). When the food eaten with a piece of bread is what you want to eat, but you cannot eat it alone because it's too strong, e. g. too salted. In this case, the bread comes as an attenuating food and is Tafel.</p>\n\n<p>Tosfot says that the case of the Mishna comes to teach that bread is not always the essential food even if you eat the second food with the bread (as a sandwich for instance).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואף על גב דאשמעינן דפת פוטר את הפרפרת איצטריך לאשמעינן \n  דפעמים דפת טפל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>The concept of Chashuv is generally used when two foods with the same beracha, to decide on what to bless.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So we explained some principles regarding ykar and tafel, you addressed in the text of the question.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>But your case address the din kdima, precedence, of Brachot.

More importantly for the purposes of this question, he's an Orthodox Jew. </p>\n\n<p>Some of his fans (some serious, some joking) have suggested Shapiro run for U.S. President sometime in the future (slogans like \"Shapiro 2020\" <a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/teepublic/image/private/s--e7092Ho_--/t_Preview/b_rgb:ffffff,c_limit,f_jpg,h_630,q_90,w_630/v1506708968/production/designs/1938707_1.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">have ended up</a> on t-shirts worn by his fans). <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWPfT1Fl6_s\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shapiro himself has suggested he may run for office in the future</a>, but it is unclear whether or not it's all tongue-in-cheek. </p>\n\n<p>According to halacha, is a Jew allowed to be the President of the United States, or be the leading government official in any country that isn't Jewish, be it Prime Minister, King, etc.? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As far as I’m aware, there’s no specific <em>prohibition</em> against a Jew being head of a foreign state. As noted in the comments, we have somewhat of a historical precedent in the form of Yosef, Mordechai, Nechemiah, Daniel, and Esther. Admittedly those aren’t perfect parallels, since Yosef was before Matan Torah, all but Esther were second-in-command, and Esther was forced into the position. </p>\n\n<p>That said, it’s certainly a terrible idea. To quote Avos 1:10:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שְׁמַעְיָה וְאַבְטַלְיוֹן קִבְּלוּ מֵהֶם. שְׁמַעְיָה אוֹמֵר, אֱהֹב אֶת הַמְּלָאכָה, וּשְׂנָא אֶת הָרַבָּנוּת, וְאַל תִּתְוַדַּע לָרָשׁוּת: </p>\n  \n  <p>Shamaya and Avtalyon received [the Mesorah] from [Yehudah Ben Taba’i and Shimon Ben Shetach]. Shamaya says, “Love work, <strong>hate lordship, and do not become familiar with the government.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the emphasized phrase is explained by the Bartenura:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּשְׂנָא אֶת הָרַבָּנוּת. [...] פֵּרוּשׁ אַחֵר, וּשְׂנָא אֶת הָרַבָּנוּת, הִתְרַחֵק מִלִּנְהֹג שְׂרָרָה עַל צִבּוּר, שֶׁהָרַבָּנוּת מְקַבֶּרֶת אֶת בְּעָלֶיהָ: </p>\n  \n  <p>“Hate lordship” [...] Another explanation: “hate lordship” - distance yourself from acting with authority over the community, for lordship buries those who have it. </p>\n  \n  <p>וְאַל תִּתְוַדַּע לָרָשׁוּת. כְּדֵי לִטֹּל רַבָּנוּת עַל יָדֶיהָ. אִי נַמִּי, אַל תִּתְוַדַּע לָרָשׁוּת, שֶׁלֹּא יַעֲבִירוּךָ עַל דַּעַת קוֹנְךָ, כְּמוֹ שֶׁאֵרַע לְדוֹאֵג הָאֲדוֹמִי. לָרָשׁוּת, הַשְּׂרָרָה קְרוּיָה רָשׁוּת, מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהָרְשׁוּת בְּיָדָהּ לַעֲשׂוֹת כִּרְצוֹנָהּ: </p>\n  \n  <p>“Do not become familiar with the government” to take lordship through it. Alternatively, “do not become familiar with the government” so that it does not cause you to violate the will of your Maker, like what happened with Doeg HaEdomi. “With the government [lit. ‘permission’]” - dominion is called “permission,” as permission is in its hands to do as it wants. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Further on, in Avos 2:3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הֱווּ זְהִירִין בָּרָשׁוּת, שֶׁאֵין מְקָרְבִין לוֹ לָאָדָם אֶלָּא לְצֹרֶךְ עַצְמָן. נִרְאִין כְּאוֹהֲבִין בִּשְׁעַת הֲנָאָתָן, וְאֵין עוֹמְדִין לוֹ לָאָדָם בִּשְׁעַת דָּחְקוֹ:  </p>\n  \n  <p>Be careful with the government, as they only draw a person close for their own needs. They appear like lovers in beneficial times, and they don’t stand for a person in the time of his trouble. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All that said, consider the Tosfos Yom Tov to this latter Mishnah, quoting Midrash Shmuel quoting the Rashbatz:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הוו זהירין ברשות וכו'. כתב הר\"ב אע\"פ שאתם צריכים להתוודע לרשות כדי לפקח וכו' דעל כיוצא בזה לא אמר שמעיה [בפרק דלעיל משנה י'] כי זו מצוה רבה היא להתוודע להם לפקח על עסקי צבור ומרדכי ורבינו הקדוש יוכיחו. מד\"ש בשם רשב\"ץ: </p>\n  \n  <p>“Be careful with the government, etc.” - The Bartenura wrote, “Even though you need to become familiar with the government in order to supervise [communal needs, be careful, etc.]” Shamaya (above, 1:10) was not discussing such a case, for this is a great Mitzvah to become familiar with them to supervise communal needs, as Mordechai and Rabbeinu HaKadosh [Rebbi Yehudah HaNasi] prove. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Incidentally, Rebbi Yehudah HaNasi’s son Rabban Gamliel is the one who taught this Mishnah, as per the opening line of Mishnah 2.)</p>\n\n<p>Seemingly, then, as long as one makes absolutely, positively sure his priorities are straight - that he’s acting solely for Hashem’s sake, that he’s fulfilling the Mitzvah of helping out his fellow Jews, that he doesn’t become corrupted by the power of the office, etc. - <em>perhaps</em> there is room to say it’s fine. But it still seems to be heavily discouraged. </p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, consider Horayos 10a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וינגע ה' את המלך ויהי מצורע עד יום מותו וישב בבית החפשית ויותם בן המלך על הבית (מלכים ב טו, ה) מדקאמר בבית החפשית מכלל דעד השתא עבד הוה </p>\n  \n  <p>“And Hashem struck the king, and he became a Metzora until the day of his death. He sat in the Freedom House, and Yosam son of the king was over the house” (Melachim 2:15:5). From that it says “in the Freedom House,” it implies that until then he was a slave [i.e. to his people]. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rashi spells out on the final line:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מכלל דעד השתא עבד הוה - דשררות עבדות הוא לו לפי שמוטל עליו עול רבים:</p>\n  \n  <p>“Implies that until now he was a slave” - for dominion is slavery to him, for it places on him the yoke of the public. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Is it a good idea? Probably not. Is it permissible? Yes, as long as you keep your priorities in check. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does Rashi interpret Chizkiya’s dragging Achaz’s bones differently in different locations?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Braisa says (Pesachim 56a, quoted as Mishnah 4:8):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תנו רבנן ששה דברים עשה חזקיה המלך על שלשה הודו לו ועל שלשה לא הודו לו גירר עצמות אביו על מטה של חבלים והודו לו [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rabbis taught: King Chizkiya did six things; regarding three did [the Sages] agree to him, and regarding three did they not agree to him. He dragged his father’s bones on a reed bed, and they agreed to him. [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi there, in Pesachim 56a, explains why he did this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גירר עצמות אביו - משום כפרה ולא קברו בכבוד בדרגש ומטה נאה ומפני קידוש השם שיתגנה על רשעו ויוסרו הרשעים:</p>\n  \n  <p>“He dragged his father’s bones” - as an atonement, and he did not bury them honorably with a canopy(?) and a nice bed. This was to sanctify the Name which [Achaz] disgraced in his wickedness, and the wicked suffer. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems from this Rashi that Chizkiya dragging Achaz’s bones was to Achaz’s benefit, enacting some form of atonement for his sins. </p>\n\n<p>But Rashi to Berachos 10b explains this Braisa differently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גירר עצמות אביו - לפי שהיה רשע בזהו ולא נהג בו כבוד בקבורתו להוציאו כהוגן במטות זהב וכסף:</p>\n  \n  <p>“He dragged his father’s bones” - because [Achaz] was wicked, [Chizkiya] denigrated him and did not treat him with honor in his burial, to take him out properly with beds of gold and silver. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here Rashi sounds like he did not have the intention to benefit Achaz, but rather solely to denigrate the wicked.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi uses this latter interpretation on Pesachim 47a as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>על מטה של חבלים - דרך בזיון מפני שהיה אביו רשע וביזהו לעיני כל [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>“On a reed mat” - in a denigrating way; since his father was wicked, he denigrated him in the eyes of all [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why does Rashi change the overall message?</li>\n<li>Rashi also changes what a “proper burial” would be - in Pesachim 56a he talks about a “canopy(?) and nice bed,” but in Berachos he describes “beds of gold and silver.” Is this related, in that he didn’t do certain things to benefit him and he didn’t do other things to denigrate him?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Biblical שלישית = Chazalic שליש; Biblical רביעית = Chazalic רביע. Could be that this is because the forms with ית- are ambiguous: שלישית can mean \"(fem.) third (in a series)\" or \"one-third.\"</p>\n\n<p>With ששית you can't do that without introducing another ambiguity, because then you're left with שש, which is the cardinal number \"six.\" (The difference in nikkud probably wouldn't have been enough to resolve it.) So the logical thing to do would be to borrow an Aramaic-derived form instead.</p>\n\n<p>There's also the complication that we do find Chazal often using the term רביעית, and sometimes also (as mentioned in comments) שמינית and עשירית. It might be that רביעית had already become established as the name of a unit of measurement, and it kept that name even when the term for the fraction was changed. In fact, רביעית generally is used just for that specific measurement, a quarter of a log; as a fraction (or a different unit of measurement, such as a quarter of a kav), the term רובע is usually used instead. (In that sense it might be a little like the way in English we have \"quart\" as a measurement vs. \"quarter\" as a fraction.) And so the related שמינית - which is half of a רביעית and was probably used fairly commonly too - also kept its original form when referring to an eighth of a log (or its metaphorical equivalent, like אחד משמונה בשמינית).</p>\n\n<p>(As for עשירית - that seems to be used only when talking about עשירית האיפה, the measurement for a mincha, where that's the expression used in Chumash for it. Keep in mind that the eifah itself was no longer in use as a day-to-day unit of measurement in the times of Chazal. In other contexts the word עישור tends to be used.)</p>\n\n\n",

For example, imagine buying a siddur from a local synagogue's Gabbay for $70 and a day later stumbling upon an official pricelist that states that the price is $60. Would you feel as \"surely forgive\"?</p>\n\n<p>THe question: was it a common practice in their times that's backed by external sources (maybe Greek or Roman law) or what's the explanation of that (nonexistent now) psychology?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Not really comparable - in your scenario there's an official shul price list which the gabbai knows about and is expected to follow. But most of the time there's a range of prices within a geographical area; does every grocery store in your neighborhood sell bread at exactly the same price, for example? So if you go to one store where a loaf of bread is $2.99, and then later to another store where you can get it for $2.50, you're usually not going to go and return the bread to the first store in order to save 49 cents - it's not worth the trouble. That's mechilah. (At most, you'll start shopping at the second store from now on.)</p>\n<p>See Tur Choshen Mishpat 227:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכתב א\"א הרא\"ש ז\"ל... אלא שחכמים אמרו עד שתות הוי מחילה לפי שכן הוא דרך מקח וממכר שאין הלוקח והמוכר יכולין לכוין דמי המקח בצמצום ודרך העולם למחול טעות עד שתות</p>\n<p>The Rosh writes that the Chachamim said that there's mechilah up to 1/6 <strong>because this is the normal way of commerce, that the buyer and seller can't establish the value of the item with such precision</strong>, and so people typically forgo an error of up to 1/6.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we're explicitly <strong>not</strong> talking about a case where there's a fixed price, but one where the price fluctuates within some reasonable range.</p>\n\n\n",

Apart from the prohibitions, how am I to behave? </p>\n\n<p>It sounds odd but ever since I've became (somewhat) more religious, I tried to isolate myself as much as possible during Shaabath. Used to go to shul but later on, I spend Shaabath in solitude. And now that the time comes near, it feels kinda weird to be put in a situation in which I, one Jew among gentiles, spend Shaabath with non-Jews. </p>\n\n<p>So to sum it up: is there anything noteworthy how a Jew must behave during Shaabath when among gentiles? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Spending Shabbat with non-Jews, or Jews who aren't Shomer Shabbat, can be difficult. I think the best idea would to avoid being put in such a situation. But if you can't, make sure:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>kosher food will be avaliable. </li>\n<li>People in the household (like your father) have a working understanding of what can and cannot be done on Shabbat. (If your father exhibits a hostile attitude towards your observance, emphasize what you CAN do versus what you can't. For example, \"We can't go for a drive but we could go for a walk instead.\") </li>\n<li>That the people in the household will not perform melachah just for you (this is especially crucial in a house where the people are Jewish, but just not Shomer Shabbat). </li>\n<li>You can create an environment for yourself to remind yourself it's Shabbat. For example, bring along sefarim to read. Immerse yourself in the parshat hashavua. Make sure to keep your conversations Shabbat friendly. No politics, sports, business, etc. </li>\n<li>Bring along things you'll need for the rituals. Bring grape juice/wine along. Have hot meals for the Shabbat Seudot. It's probably the best idea that you have mevushal wine to ensure nothing goes wrong. But pour your father a glass and serve him a nice meal, show him what Shabbat IS and what it means and does for you, not what it doesn't. (As mentioned above, focus only on the positive). </li>\n<li>Show people around you that your Shabbat observance isn't a burden, but is truly a menuchah (rest). </li>\n<li>If possible, go to a shul or frum family nearby and spend some time there. There's nothing like community. If not, stick to the prayers at the house, but make sure to find a room where you won't be disturbed and also where there is nothing problematic making it impossible to pray there (example, a cross hanging on the wall, a bathroom). </li>\n<li>Constantly remind yourself throughout the day that it's Shabbat. Look down at your tzitzit every now and then, grab them and say \"It's Shabbat Kodesh\". Before doing anything, ask yourself, \"Can I do this on Shabbat?\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is just some advice coming from someone who has spent many Shabbatot among non-Jewish family and non-Shomer Shabbat Jews (family and not). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I would suggest something different - making Kiddush Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Besides all the Halochos Ezra rightfully mentioned, I would recommend <strong>focusing on your father's perception of your Shabbos</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Does keeping Shabbos make you really happy? Do you really like Shabbos and not only perform those chores as a burden on you?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does it make your father be proud of you and your religiosity? Is that something your father can mention before his friends?</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Does Shabbos bring extra peace in the house</strong> or the opposite? It's common with Baale Teshuvah that Shabbos always comes at expense of Shlom Bays. Remember \"כל שרוח הבריות נוחה הימנו, רוח המקום נוחה הימנו\" (Avos 3)</p></li>\n<li><p>As Halachicly you're not obligated to honor your biological father, we're afraid he could claim \"my son went from a more stringent religion to a more lenient (toward honoring parents)\", as Russians are well known for respecting their parents, and that could cause a huge Hilul Hashem. So one has to consult a Rabbi on how to balance between the Halacha and honoring the father- what Chumros can be omitted (temporarily of course).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Shabbos with gentiles can be spiritual in a different way.

It is from this pool of souls in the spiritual realms that every soul departs when it is about to descend into a body, and it is to this same state that the soul returns when it leaves the body at the conclusion of its mission.6 Ultimately, when the time comes for the Resurrection, this will be (as conceived by Rambam) a transient stage, for after the Resurrection the body will again die, and the soul will return to the World to Come, i.e., to the World of Souls.</p></li>\n<li><p>Most authorities** Including the Arizal*** hold that the phrase “World to Come” in the Talmud refers to the era of the Resurrection of the Dead in this world. (This state is called Olam HaTechiyah; literally, “the World of the Resurrection.”) The Olam Haneshamos is a temporary place for the Souls to rest before the Resurrection of the Dead.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As with regards to where will Klal Yisrael be when \"Hashem will remain on his own on that day\"(Isaiah 2:17), The Zohar Hachodosh 164,1 explains That when the <em>Klipa</em> is removed from <em>Klal Yisroel</em> we will be are One with Hashem and therefore we will not be destroyed as we are part of Him.(This requires much more explanation in the appropriate setting)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתיב (ישעיה כה ח) בלע המות לנצח וגו', וישתאר קב\"ה בלחודוי, כמה דכתיב (שם ב יח) והאלילים כליל יחלוף, וכתיב (שם יז) ונשגב יהו\"ה לבדו ביום ההוא, הוא בלחודוי, כמה דכתיב (דברים לב יב) ואין עמו אל נכר, בגין דישתצי חילא מסאבא מעלמא, ולא ישתאר לעילא ותתא אלא קב\"ה בלחודוי, וישראל לפולחניה עם קדיש, ויתקרי קדוש, דכתיב (ישעיה ד ג) והיה הנשאר בציון והנותר בירושלם קדוש יאמר לו כל הכתוב לחיים בירושלם, וכדין יהא מלכא יחידאי לעילא ותתא, ועמא יחידאה לפולחניה, כמה דכתיב (דה\"א יז כא) ומי כעמך ישראל גוי אחד בארץ.</p>\n  \n  <hr>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>*Hilchos Teshuvah 8:8.

    "content": "# Karet and No Share in ha'olam Haba\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the difference between a person who died without doing teshuva on his sins on <em>Karet</em>,  Eternal <em>gehinnom</em> and having no share in the world to come? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I’ll cite the relevant pieces momentarily, but here’s a quick summary of these ideas, according to the Rambam: Eternal Gehennom is exactly what it sounds like, while Kareis means being cut off from Olam HaBa - no Gehennom but no Gan Eden either. While the default is that a Jew has a share in Gan Eden (perhaps having a temporary dip in Gehennom first to cleans one’s soul), he’s able to forfeit that right for certain sins (assuming he doesn’t do Teshuvah, as you assume in your question). </p>\n\n<p>There’s also a confusion of terminology to be cleared up here: according to the Rambam, Olam HaBa refers to after a person dies, before he is resurrected (Lechem Mishnah, to 8:1). To clarify this, I’ve been using the term “Gan Eden” rather than the more ambiguous “Olam HaBa”; in the quotes below, I will use the term Olam HaBa, as that is the term the Rambam uses. </p>\n\n<p>Note that others (ex. Ramban) argue that Olam HaBa indeed refers to after the Resurrection; I don’t know if, according to such opinions, one who gets Kareis has a share in Gan Eden first. </p>\n\n<p>Now for the relevant quotes, all of which are in the Rambam’s Mishnah Torah:</p>\n\n<p>Teshuvah 8:1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַטוֹבָה הַצְּפוּנָה לַצַּדִּיקִים הִיא חַיֵּי הָעוֹלָם הַבָּא וְהִיא הַחַיִּים שֶׁאֵין מָוֶת עִמָּהֶן וְהַטּוֹבָה שֶׁאֵין עִמָּהּ רָעָה. [...] וּפִרְעוֹן הָרְשָׁעִים הוּא שֶׁלֹּא יִזְכּוּ לְחַיִּים אֵלּוּ אֶלָּא יִכָּרְתוּ וְיָמוּתוּ. וְכָל מִי שֶׁאֵינוֹ זוֹכֶה לְחַיִּים אֵלּוּ הוּא הַמֵּת שֶׁאֵינוֹ חַי לָעוֹלָם אֶלָּא נִכְרַת בְּרִשְׁעוֹ וְאָבֵד כִּבְהֵמָה.</p>\n  \n  <p>The good which is hidden for the righteous is the life of Olam HaBa, which is the life which there is no death with it, where there is good with no evil. [...] The punishment of the wicked is that they do not merit this life, but rather they are cut off and die. Anyone who does not merit this life is dead, for he doesn’t live forever, but rather is cut off in his wickedness and is lost like an animal. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Teshuvah 8:5:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַנְּקָמָה שֶׁאֵין נְקָמָה גְּדוֹלָה מִמֶּנָּה שֶׁתִּכָּרֵת הַנֶּפֶשׁ וְלֹא תִּזְכֶּה לְאוֹתָן הַחַיִּים שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (במדבר טו לא) \"הִכָּרֵת תִּכָּרֵת הַנֶּפֶשׁ הַהִיא עֲוֹנָהּ בָּהּ\". וְזֶה הָאֲבַדּוֹן הוּא שֶׁקּוֹרִין אוֹתוֹ הַנְּבִיאִים דֶּרֶךְ מָשָׁל בְּאֵר שַׁחַת וַאֲבַדּוֹן וְתָפְתֶּה וַעֲלוּקָה וְכָל לְשׁוֹן כְּלָיָה וְהַשְׁחָתָה קוֹרְאִין לוֹ לְפִי שֶׁהִיא הַכְּלָיָה שֶׁאֵין אַחֲרֶיהָ תְּקוּמָה וְהַהֶפְסֵד שֶׁאֵינוֹ חוֹזֵר לְעוֹלָם:</p>\n  \n  <p>The revenge which there is no greater revenge than it is that the soul is cut off and does not merit those lives, as it says, ”That soul will surely be cut off; its sin is in it.” This is the loss which the prophets called by parable “pit of destruction,” “loss,” “burning flame,” “leech,” and all other languages of cessation and destruction they call it, for it is the cessation after which there is no rising, the loss which does not return ever. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Teshuvah 3:5-6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְכֵן כָּל הָרְשָׁעִים שֶׁעֲוֹנוֹתֵיהֶן מְרֻבִּים דָּנִין אוֹתָן כְּפִי חֲטָאֵיהֶם וְיֵשׁ לָהֶן חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא שֶׁכָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל יֵשׁ לָהֶם חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁחָטְאוּ [...] וְאֵלּוּ הֵן שֶׁאֵין לָהֶן חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא אֶלָּא נִכְרָתִים וְאוֹבְדִין וְנִדּוֹנִין עַל גֹּדֶל רִשְׁעָם וְחַטָּאתָם לְעוֹלָם וּלְעוֹלְמֵי עוֹלָמִים. [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>And likewise all the wicked whose sins are many, they are judged according to their wickedness, but they have a portion in Olam HaBa, for all Jews have a portion in Olam HaBa even if they have sinned [...] And these are those who have no share in Olam HaBa but rather are cut off, lost, or judged on the severity of their wickedness and sins for all eternity [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Notice in this last paragraph that the Rambam, in addition to discussing being \"cut off and lost\" (i.e. receiving Kareis), also discussing being \"judged.\" This stitch of the Rambam seems to be paraphrasing Rosh HaShanah 17a, which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל המינין והמסורות והאפיקורסים שכפרו בתורה ושכפרו בתחיית המתים ושפירשו מדרכי צבור ושנתנו חיתיתם בארץ חיים ושחטאו והחטיאו את הרבים כגון ירבעם בן נבט וחביריו יורדין לגיהנם ונידונין בה לדורי דורות</p>\n  \n  <p>But [various types of sinners] descend to Gehennom and are judged there for all generations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But I'd like to suggest another: I've found that if you put a <em>blech</em> (made of the kind of metal that works with induction cooktops) on the burner and under the pot, taking off the pot does NOT break the connection, or cause any change in the display.

Years ago, when the question was posed to me, I told the consumer to simply put a blech over all of the burners and let the heat radiate over the entire surface.   Bad move – the cooktop shattered!

Presumably (I don't know how the shut-offs work or the like) you could leave the induction on, with the interface disk in place, all of shabbos. At which point the only concerns would be the risk of someone mistakenly removing the disk, plus the obligation to \"cover the fire\" (and/or controls, depending on who you ask) to prevent someone from fiddling with it. I don't know how contemporary rabbis would rule on those; you could argue that the disk already <em>is</em> the cover, or alternatively that the disk is the \"fire\" that still needs to be covered.</p>\n\n\n",

זה בעיני נכבדת כי ע\"י שגרם במעשיו דאסתלק קב\"ה לעילא ואתייקר ביקריה כנ\"ל. על ידי זה נעשה ג\"כ מכובד ע\"ד כי מכבדי אכבד. ויש לרמז זה גם כן בתנחומא (פ' זו ט) ל\"ו דורות מאדם עד יעבץ ולא כתיב בא' מהן כבוד אלא ביעבץ דכ' ויהי יעבץ נכבד מאחיו כו' והיינו שהוא היה הראשון בעולם שלמד התורה ביגיעה שהוא החזיר בפילפולו ההלכות שנשתכחו באבלו של משה ולזה נקרא יעבץ שיעץ וריבץ תורה בישראל (כמ\"ש תמורה טז.) והיינו שורש תורה שבעל פה שנצרך ליגיעה רבה כדי להיות חקוקה על לב האבן וכמ\"ש (מגילה ו :) אלמלא חטאו ישראל לא ניתן להם אלא ה' חומשי תורה כו' כי ברוב חכמה רוב כעס שלתקן הרב כעס שיוחקקו הדברי תורה על לב

(recalled and said at Kiddush of Shabbat night, ויהי ערב ויהי בוקר יום הששי) <em>And it was evening and it was morning, the sixth day</em>, as recalled above, that specifically through the <em>evening</em> (the transitional time at the end of the day when the sun begins to set and the sky starts to darken) and the darkness (full night after the appearance of three medium stars, that night and darkness are compared to the period of exile, like the Egyptian exile which preceded the Giving of the Torah), preparation is made for the aspect of <em>the sixth day</em>, which is the quality of <em>Tzaddik, Yesod Olam</em> (Yosef, son of Yaacov Avinu is referred to as <em>Yosef HaTzaddik</em>. The Egyptian exile actually began during the lifetime of Avraham Avinu which corresponds to the time of sundown at the end of the 5th day. The night of the 6th day corresponds with when Yosef actually descended into Egypt.). And their known discourse (Shabbat 88) that the Holy One, blessed be He teaches that the letter <em>Heh</em> of the word <em>HaShishi</em> (השישי) is in relation to the works of the days of creation (which preceded the sixth day).</p>\n\n<p>That if Israel accepts the Torah, they (meaning everything created before the sixth day) will be maintained, that all the works of creation are dependent upon the sixth of Sivan (the day of) the giving of the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Meaning that then, the completion of the jewelry (or the repair from the damage caused by Adam HaRishon) will be finished like it says, <em>Engraved on the Tablets</em> (חרות על הלוחות, that <em>cherut</em> can mean either <em>engraved</em> or <em>free from</em>) <em>Free from the Angel of Death</em> (like it says in Shemot Rabbah, chapter 41), which is the <em>Yetzer HaRa</em>, like is said (in Bava Batra 16).</p>\n\n<p>And since the degradation (the worship of the golden calf) was also then and the tablets were shattered, it said, <em>hew for yourself two stone tablets, like the first ones, etc.</em>. That also now they said (in chapter 6 of Avot) from this posuk, that one is not free, except someone who is engaged in Torah study. Because for a certainty, at the time of the Giving of the Torah it was like the beginning of Creation. That G-d made Adam HaRishon <em>True</em> (ישר meaning he was intended to live eternally and not die). </p>\n\n<p>That at the time that Israel heard the utterance I (am the L-rd, your G-d, etc. Shemot 20:2), Torah study was wedged into their heart (like it says in Shir HaShirim Rabbah on the posuk, <em>Let Him kiss me...</em> Shir HaShirim 1:2). </p>\n\n<p>And they were in a state of absolute perfection because the heart was continuously joined together with fear and love of Him, blessed be He and they didn't require tablets of stone. That all the words of the Torah were engraved upon their heart and the Yetzer HaRa was uprooted from their heart with the utterance, You will not have...(like it is written there in Shemot 20:3) etc.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why does the number of letters Vav in name Achashverosh vary?",
    "content": "# Why does the number of letters Vav in name Achashverosh vary?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why does Megillas Esther spell Achashverosh's name varyingly with one (as in 2:21), two (as in 1:1), and zero (as in 10:1) letters Vav?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Sefer Orah v’Simchah (cited <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2833361/jewish/Chapter-Ten.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> at Chabad) discusses the specific example of no vav’s in 10:1. He explains that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Public officials are highly lauded when they reduce taxes and criticized and scorned when they increase taxes. Not knowing Esther’s nationality, the King proclaimed an amnesty (from taxes) for all the provinces in her honor when he married her (2:18), thus enhancing his popularity with all the people. Now that he had levied taxes, he immediately lost some of their admiration and to indicate the decline in his popularity, his name is not spelled as fully as previously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps we can extend this logic. His name is spelled with two vav’s consistently throughout the Megillah (no less than 24 times), as well as in Ezra 4:6.<sup>1</sup> His name is only spelled with one vav in four places: 2:21, 3:12, 8:7, and 8:10. </p>\n\n<p>2:21 is in the context of Bigsan and Seresh’s plot to kill the king:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויבקשו לשלוח יד במלך אחשורש</p>\n  \n  <p>And they sought to send hand against the king Achashveirosh</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clearly he’s a bit unpopular here. Perhaps he only loses one vav because it’s only a couple of people who don’t like him, rather than the populace at large. </p>\n\n<p>3:12 is in the context of Haman’s decree:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בשם המלך אחשורש נכתב ונחתם בטבעת המלך</p>\n  \n  <p>In the name of the king Achashveirosh was [the decree] written, and it was sealed with the signet ring of the king. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here Haman is abusing his authority. While Achashveirosh acquiesced to the decree, Haman’s motive in asking for permission was to use him toward his own needs; since a decree signed with the king’s seal cannot be overturned, it’s in Haman’s best interests to get it signed that way. Since Haman is using the king for his own interests, rather than actually respecting him, the king loses a vav here as well.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<p>8:7 and 8:10 are in the context of the revision of Haman’s decree, that the Jews are now able to fight back. </p>\n\n<p>Many of the populace hated the Jews and attacked any of them they could when the 13th of Adar finally rolled around. While the Pesukim indicate that 75,810 were killed in this battle (9:5-16), certainly there were many more who didn’t. Those who wanted to attack certainly wouldn’t have liked this new edict that the Jews could defend themselves (especially since they ended up dead as a result), but since the overwhelming majority did not attack — many of them, indeed, actually honored the Jews (9:3) — Achashveirosh’s name only loses one vav.<sup>3</sup></p>\n\n<p>In short: If only a minority, especially a tiny minority, dislikes the king’s actions, the name only loses one vav. But since nobody likes having their taxes raised, 10:1 drops both of the vav’s. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>It’s also spelled with both vav’s in Daniel 9:1. I’m not counting this one, though, as it’s in the context of his son, as דריוש בן אחשורוש. </p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup>3:7 uses the name in full, as it’s not referring to Haman’s interactions with him, just stating the year. 3:8 uses the name in full, as Haman wouldn’t dare to speak disrespectfully to the king in his presence. But in 3:12, when Haman is no longer in the king’s presence, Haman can show his true feelings.</p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup>Yes, his name appears in full in 8:12, but since that refers to the countries, rather than the king himself, it doesn’t count, either. </p>\n\n\n",

Please cite sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>When a person did lose his free choice, we say that he became Shote, loosely linked to the inaccurate term of \"crazy\" or insane. He is categorized as a child regarding responsibility and this state is often reversed to sanity.</p>\n\n<p>For instance mishna Gittin 2.6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קיבל הקטן והגדיל, חירש ונתפקח, סומא ונתפתח, שוטה ונשתפה, נוכרי ונתגייר--פסול.  אבל פיקח ונתחרש וחזר ונתפקח, פיתח ונסתמא וחזר ונתפתח, שפוי ונשתטה חזר ונשתפה--כשר.  זה הכלל--כל שתחילתו וסופו בדעת, כשר.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The status of Shote makes him exempt from mitsvot and no responsible for his actions even if he caused damages, even if he murdered. But sane people need to apply every duty toward insane people, there is no reciprocity, as you see in Baba Kama 8.4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חירש שוטה וקטן, העבד, והאישה--פגיעתן רעה.  החובל בהן, חייב. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So not everybody has free choice. If a man doesn't have free choice, why was he created? King David asked this, and the answer is that this has a functionality that is not appearing immediately.</p>\n\n\n",

Throughout the building, English translations of passages from the Tanakh (and probably the Christian New Testament) were engraved on the floor. Is it right to assume that there is a problem with stepping over those engravings? What would be the relevant references for this situation?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/44200/9535\">Is there a halachic problem with the Columbia University seal on the floor of the library?</a> is relevant but seems focused on cases in which one or another of the names of God appears <em>in Hebrew</em>. Columbia is also a secular university, where use of the seal might be regarded as simply a matter of tradition, whereas the seminary clearly engraved the words as an expression of <em>Christian</em> piety.</p>\n\n<p>While researching a different problem, I came across a Conservative teshuva on shemot that argued that sacred books prepared by Gentiles for Gentile use are not sanctified, but, aside from the question of whether or not non-Orthodox opinions are valid, I am unsure if this situation is sufficiently similar. (I also have not read through the teshuva in full, so I may be missing context.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In many areas, we distinguish between two aspects of a \"transgression\" - objective (חפצא) and subjective (גברא) (many address only the objective one). </p>\n\n<p>So if you ask objectively, those writings bear no holiness, as nobody learns from them, they are carved by gentiles and for gentiles.

For example, \nclothes or watches that you wear are <em>presumably</em> yours, if you work in a field for three consecutive years it's <em>presumably</em> yours, if you and your girlfriend come to a new community and cohabit with her you become <em>presumably</em> married, if a woman comes from far away and holds a child she continues to fosters for years he becomes <em>presumably</em> her son. </p>\n\n<p>So if you're not a Jew, but come to a new community that can't check your background (very difficult nowadays) and keep the Torah and Mitzvos you become <em>presumably</em> a Jew by a Chazakah. Of course you'll be a sort of a \"second-grade\" Jew, a Jew without ancestry, but still a lawfull Jew.</p>\n\n<p>It is very easy to visualize: think about driving by the countryside at late night and hitting a man. He's hurt and unconscious but nothing serious. He looks like a full-fledged Chassid - black coat, Shtreiml, white socks etc. When he awakens he remembers nothing and has no IDs. You post his picture on every social network but nobody recognizes him. He knows all the Halachos and keeps them piously. What would you do? Would you accept him into your community or suspect he's a masquerading gentile? Well, if he walks like a duck and quacks like a duck ...</p>\n\n<p>The second part <strong>about G-ds acceptance</strong>, I think, is even easier, because it is commonly accepted that one who <em>truly wants to be a Jew and keep the Torah</em> already has a Jewish soul (why would he otherwise). So the conversion is always only a formal communal acceptance, just as a marriage.</p>\n\n<p><em>THe sources for this statement are:</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Rambam's ruling at the end of Melachim (): \"משפחה אשר נטמעה נטמעה\".

As many mefarshim point out, once the Torah mentions something in one place, it does not need to detail it in any other places whatsoever.  A good example of this is the Selav not being mentioned in Hashem's introduction to the Man, as explained by Ramban (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/Ramban/Shemot/16.4#m7e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 16:4</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה לא הזכיר כאן דבר רק המן שהוא הלחם שהמטיר להם, אבל כאשר אמר להם משה: בתת י״י לכם בערב בשר לאכול ולחם בבקר לשבוע (שמות ט״ז:ח׳), ידענו כי הכל נאמר לו, <strong>אבל הכתוב יקצר בדברים הנכפלים בענין הצווי או בספור, כאשר הזכרתי לך פעמים רבים</strong> (רמב״ן שמות ט׳:י״ב, י׳:י״ב, י״א:א׳), <strong>ופעמים לא יזכיר האחד כלל</strong>, דכתיב בפרשה הזאת: זה הדבר אשר צוה י״י מלא העומר ממנו (שמות ט״ז:ל״ב), ולא נכתבה הצואה כלל, <strong>וכן במקומות רבים</strong>.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, in this case it is very possible that they do appear elsewhere in the Torah.</p>\n<p>In Parshas Matos (Bamidbar 31), Moshe gets angry and rebukes \"Pekudei Hechayil, Sarei Alafaim and Sarei Mei'os\", \"officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds\", who are mentioned a number of times in that Parsha, not only within the context of war itself, but also about related halachos (see <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/31.1#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a> for details).  This wording is almost identical to when Moshe chooses these leaders:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּקְצֹ֣ף מֹשֶׁ֔ה עַ֖ל <strong>פְּקוּדֵ֣י הֶחָ֑יִל שָׂרֵ֤י הָאֲלָפִים֙ וְשָׂרֵ֣י הַמֵּא֔וֹת</strong> הַבָּאִ֖ים מִצְּבָ֥א הַמִּלְחָמָֽה׃‏</p>\n<p>Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.</p>\n<p><strong>וַיִּבְחַ֨ר</strong> מֹשֶׁ֤ה <strong>אַנְשֵׁי־חַ֙יִל֙</strong> מִכׇּל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וַיִּתֵּ֥ן אֹתָ֛ם רָאשִׁ֖ים עַל־הָעָ֑ם <strong>שָׂרֵ֤י אֲלָפִים֙ שָׂרֵ֣י מֵא֔וֹת שָׂרֵ֥י חֲמִשִּׁ֖ים וְשָׂרֵ֥י עֲשָׂרֹֽת</strong>׃‏</p>\n<p>Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps these leaders who Moshe speaks with here in Bamidbar were those same leaders who he appointed?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Moshe Aharon Nadav and Avihu and The 70 sages already were appointed on the people, yet Yisro told them it as still way <strong>too much for all 74 of them to bear</strong> as stated in Mechilta Shemos 18,17:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' אלעזר המודעי אומר, ינבלו אותך ויקנטרו אותך כתאנה זו שעליה נובלות שנ' (ישעיה לד) כנבול עלה מגפן וכנובלת מתאנה. - גם אתה. אתה, זה משה. גם, זה אהרן. העם הזה אשר עמך, אלו שבעים זקנים, דברי ר' יהושע; ר' אלעזר המודעי אומר: אתה, זה משה. גם, זה אהרן. גם זה, נדב ואביהוא, העם הזה אשר עמך, אלו שבעים זקנים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So therefore Sanhedrin 18a says in order to judge the people on a day to day basis (for all 40 years of wandering  wilderness till they died where they were probably replaced to make up the shortfall of Dayanim) there were 78,600 Dayanim appointed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תנו רבנן (שמות יח, כא) ושמת עליהם שרי אלפים שרי מאות שרי חמשים ושרי עשרות שרי אלפים שש מאות שרי מאות ששת אלפים שרי חמשים שנים עשר אלף שרי עשרות ששת ריבוא נמצאו <strong>דייני ישראל שבעת ריבוא ושמונת אלפים ושש מאות</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The 70 sages were replacement of the 70 sages(the grand Sanhedrin) that died in Taveira as stated in Rashi quoting Tanchuma Bamidbar 11,6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אספה לי. הֲרֵי תְשׁוּבָה לִתְלוּנָתְךָ שֶׁאָמַרְתָּ לֹא אוּכַל אָנֹכִי לְבַדִּי; וְהַזְּקֵנִים הָרִאשׁוֹנִים הֵיכָן הָיוּ? וַהֲלֹא אַף בְּמִצְרַיִם יָשְׁבוּ עִמָּהֶם, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמות ג') \"לֵךְ וְאָסַפְתָּ אֶת זִקְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל\"? אֶלָּא בְּאֵשׁ תַּבְעֵרָה מֵתוּ; וּרְאוּיִים הָיוּ לְכָךְ מִסִּינַי, דִּכְתִיב \"וַיֶּחֱזוּ אֶת הָאֱלֹהִים\" (שם כ\"ד) — שֶׁנָּהֲגוּ קַלּוּת רֹאשׁ כְּנוֹשֵׁךְ פִּתּוֹ וּמְדַבֵּר בִּפְנֵי הַמֶּלֶךְ, וְזֶהוּ \"וַיֹּאכְלוּ וַיִּשְׁתּוּ\", וְלֹא רָצָה הַקָּבָּ\"ה לִתֵּן אֲבֵלוּת בְּמַתַּן תּוֹרָה וּפָרַע לָהֶם כָּאן (תנחומא):<br>\n  But where were the first elders, that God commanded him to gather elders anew?

    "content": "# In what manner / How, did Hashem appear to Avraham at Mamre? (Gen 18:1)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In what manner / How, did Hashem appear to Avraham at Mamre? (Gen 18:1) </p>\n\n<p>We read in Gen 18:1  וַיֵּרָא אֵלָיו יְהוָה, בְּאֵלֹנֵי מַמְרֵא; וְהוּא יֹשֵׁב פֶּתַח-הָאֹהֶל, כְּחֹם הַיּוֹם.</p>\n\n<p>And Hashem/The LORD, appeared to him by the oaks/terebrinths of mamre, and he sat by the opening of the tent during the heat of the day.</p>\n\n<p>We see then three men (Shlosha Anashim), approach Avraham(18:2). In v22 The  men leave, Avraham continued standing before Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Hashem says he will go down (To sodom). Also(v23) Avraham drew near(to the LORD/Hashem), and he spoke to him.  </p>\n\n<p>So I don't think anybody can claim based on the text, that God appeared in any human form, and judaism doesn't make that claim so that's fine. Furthermore, while Avraham does bow to the ground to greet the men(vayishtechu artzah v2), so too David bows like that to Jonathan(artzah vayishechu) 1 Sam 20:41. So one can't read too much into a bow or such a bow. i.e. the bow doesn't indicate that the men are God in any way, though they are perhaps messengers from God.</p>\n\n<p>And afterwards, (v33) Hashem went.. ..וַיֵּלֶךְ יְהוָה    </p>\n\n<p>But it does leave open the question -  in what manner did God appear to Avraham?</p>\n\n<p>So Hashem had not yet come down to Sodom. And assuming he hadn't come down, then it seems he appeared to Avraham in a vision. If so, do we have any traditions about what that vision was? </p>\n\n<p>Or just generally any traditions or opinions on the nature of this appearance that Hashem made to Avraham?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note-</strong> There is something else that I had not noticed before.  And it may also explain why some rabbinical commentators consider this to be a vision rather than a literal event. (note, Gen 18 and Gen 19 have a good selection of variations of Adonai to look at), When there is a kamatz on the nun of ADNY, it's a name, a proper noun, for Hashem. (Putting ADNY aside for a moment), many translations distinguish things well with the word Lord/LORD/lord(s), by writing LORD for the tetragrammaton, (back to ADNY),  Lord for Adonai with a kamatz. There is ADNY with a patach, adonay (lords), which is rare. And adonee for  my lord. So the English distiguishes very clearly with the capital l, LORD, and Lord and lowercase 'l', lord(s). (And of course God and gods for elohim).  Given that, there are two things here.. </p>\n\n<p>The main thing I recently noticed in Gen 18, is the kamatz on Adonai, so a man(or what was referred to as a man), is addressed with Adonai(with kamatz). </p>\n\n<p>The other thing, which I don't think is that significant  I couldn't find a Jewish link listing all the tikkunei sofrim(emendations of the scribes), but these links <a href=\"https://levendwater.org/companion/append32.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://levendwater.org/companion/append32.html</a>      <a href=\"http://www.oocities.org/hebrew_roots/html/hr-2-1-02.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.oocities.org/hebrew_roots/html/hr-2-1-02.html</a>  mention 134 compiled by Ginsberg, and Gen 18:3 is one, where according to those links, the tetragrammaton was changed to Adonai(i.e. Adonai with kamatz)  it's not that significant in terms of meaning because it still means the same thing, Lord with a capital L, be it LORD(the tetragrammaton) or Lord(the name, Adonai with a kamatz).</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I hadn't noticed is in Gen 19:1,  it says 2 messengers came to sodom. That suggests that in the earlier Gen 18:22  when it said the men left to sodom, it was only two that left, and one remained.   </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is answered directly by G-d to Moshe. It appears in parshat V'Era (Shemot 6:2-3) which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֑ה וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖יו <strong>אֲנִ֥י יְהוָֽה</strong>׃\n  ג <strong>וָאֵרָ֗א אֶל־אַבְרָהָ֛ם אֶל־יִצְחָ֥ק וְאֶֽל־יַעֲקֹ֖ב בְּאֵ֣ל שַׁדָּ֑י</strong> וּשְׁמִ֣י יְהוָ֔ה לֹ֥א נוֹדַ֖עְתִּי לָהֶֽם׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Both the angels and the appearance of G-d were not material, physical beings in the encounter you cite. They were a vision that Avraham had during one of his meditations while sitting at the <em>mouth of his tent</em> (which may also have a meditative connotation). And just as G-d tells Moshe later, He revealed Himself to Avraham via His name, El Shaddai.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rashi on the Chumash speaks of it in terms of a revelation of the Shechinah. The Rambam in Moreh Nevuchim describes the whole experience, including the visiting angels, as a prophetic vision. (Rambam holds that the angels did not actually physically come to Avraham's tent, and in fact, in his view, such a thing is not even possible -- see what he writes in the first chapters of Hilchos Yesodei Hatorah about angels).\nEither way you look at it, this was a transcendental event that cannot be described in ordinary, everyday terms. Whenever a person \"sees\" something that has no physical substance or form, by definition it is a transcendental event.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think a possible interpretation is that G-d used a malaach  / appeared to Avraham through a malaach, and that's what Avraham saw. Perhaps one can understand the word malaach as more of an agent, than a messenger. And the bible often uses the language of agency in relation to malaachim.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. the Lord will destroy sodom, and the Malaachim do.</p>\n\n<p>And you can have a malach that carries God's name.</p>\n\n<p>Just like </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ex 23:20 “See, I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along\n  the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared. 21 Pay\n  attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him;\n  he will not forgive your rebellion, since my Name is in him. \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Gen 18 says 3 men.  One of them continues speaking to Avraham, two had left.</p>\n\n<p>Gen 19:1 mentions the two malaachim that left.</p>\n\n<p>So when the torah says men there in Gen 18, it may meant appearing as men, and may have been not just two malaachim, but three malaachim. One of them, the one addressed as Adonai, was a malaach that carried G-d's name.</p>\n\n<p>A non-judaism interpretation might be that there were only two malaachim, and the third person was a man that G-d appeared as, but I think that'd be quite radical.  </p>\n\n<p>I think it's pretty reasonable to say there were 3 malaachim, they appeared as men. One of them carried G-d's name and therefore was addressed as such.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason has nothing to do with the bins it is stored in, however. Room temperature solids are not halachaly able to render one another non-kosher, so a non-kosher chocolate in a fig bin, as per your example, will not render the dried figs non-kosher. (Below 110° F, but if it's above 110° F at your local supermarket, you've got bigger problems than whether or not the bulk dried fruit is kosher.)</p>\n\n<p>The real kashrut issue is insect infestation- non kashrut-certified dried fruit should conform to FDA standards at least, but these are significantly more lenient than kashrut as pertains to bugs and bug parts. You should ask a rabbi what dried fruits are considered problematic in your area and those need to be checked prior to eating.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://oukosher.org/publications/inspecting-dried-fruits-for-insects/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://oukosher.org/publications/inspecting-dried-fruits-for-insects/</a></p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, a Hidabroot article on Tu B'ishvat I am unable to link to states that \"Kashrut of oil spread on fruit: dried fruit often has oil spread on it and you should make sure those oils are kosher\".

    "content": "# Why will Moshe Rabbeinu be worn down?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi says that Moshe Rabbeinu did not literally judge the people from morning to evening. The verse that says so means that judging true judgments for one hour is considered like learning Torah all day long.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מן הבקר עד ערב. אֶפְשָׁר לוֹמַר כֵּן? אֶלָּא כָּל דַּיָּן שֶׁדָּן דִּין אֱמֶת לַאֲמִתּוֹ אֲפִלּוּ שָׁעָה אַחַת, מַעֲלֶה עָלָיו הַכָּתוּב כְּאִלּוּ עוֹסֵק בַּתּוֹרָה כָּל הַיּוֹם וּכְאִלּוּ נַעֲשֶׂה שֻׁתָּף לְהַקָּבָּ\"ה בְּמַעֲשֵׂה בְרֵאשִׁית, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר בּוֹ וַיְהִי עֶרֶב וְגוֹ'<br>\n  (שבת י)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if Moshe did not judge all day, why did Yisro say he will get worn down, and Hashem seemingly agreed to this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Interesting question! But Moshe need not have literally been judging all day long for Yisro's point to be legitimate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נָבֹל תִּבֹּל גַּם אַתָּה גַּם הָעָם הַזֶּה אֲשֶׁר עִמָּךְ כִּי כָבֵד מִמְּךָ הַדָּבָר לֹא תוּכַל עֲשֹׂהוּ לְבַדֶּךָ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the order of the conversation, the point made by Moshe immediately before Yisro's admonition is \"when people have an issue I arbitrate between them and inform them of God's laws and statutes\". Although the morning-till-night demand was the introduction to this conversation, it isn't explicit in Rashi's comment that it is what Yisro was responding to. The problem he saw may have simply been the large number of people bearing down.</p>\n<p>If \"נָבֹל תִּבֹּל\" doesn't mean \"you will wear down\", but \"you will get confused\" (cf. <em>Chizkuni</em>) - i.e. between people/cases due to the volume he is processing - then the absolute number of people could be more of a contributing factor than hours spent per day. Then Yisro's advice fits right where it appears in context. But Rashi does not believe that is the meaning of \"נ.ב.ל\" (at least not here).</p>\n<p>It is interesting to note that the prooftexts Rashi gives to corroborate his opinion that the operative root means \"worn down\" are both withered leaf metaphors. That is, a kind of decay that comes not from overuse but from disuse. Add to that the fact that Yisro is concerned not only for Moshe but also for the populace - \"גַּם אַתָּה גַּם הָעָם הַזֶּה\" - and it seems like Yisro is suggesting that the <em>time</em> it would take Moshe to deal with them all alone would be inordinate, leading them all to wither away in the queue. If so, then the logical suggestion of splitting up the work may not have made Moshe work any less hard, but improved the throughput of the operation nonetheless.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting the premise of Rashi's question, which is a paraphrase of Rav Chiya bar Rav Midifti's question in the <em>g'mara</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>?וכי תעלה על דעתך שמשה יושב ודן כל היום כולו? תורתו מתי נעשית</p>\n<p>Could one possibly think that Moshe was sitting in judgment the whole day? [Then] when did he learn Torah?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As well as its resolution - quoted in the question - that the honest work of a judge is so fundamental to the functioning of the world that high quality execution thereof is not \"all in a day's work\", but \"all in a <em>day's work</em>\". So there is no reason to believe that Moshe would have been working any less hard or to any less effect in his capacity as judge before and after this reorganization since a) the question assumes his non judging time was occupied as well and b) as far as that <em>d'rasha</em> is concerned, he was presumably just as \"מִן הַבֹּקֶר עַד הָעָרֶב\" after as before.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Chafetz Chaim al Hatorah answers my question, in the second piece on Parshas Yisro.\nHe says that Yisro asked Moshe what he is doing, and Moshe responded that he is teaching the people the laws of the Torah.\nYisro said he will get worn down that way; he should rather teach the people:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהִזְהַרְתָּ֣ה אֶתְהֶ֔ם אֶת־הַחֻקִּ֖ים וְאֶת־הַתּוֹרֹ֑ת וְהוֹדַעְתָּ֣\n  לָהֶ֗ם אֶת־הַדֶּ֙רֶךְ֙ יֵ֣לְכוּ בָ֔הּ וְאֶת־הַֽמַּעֲשֶׂ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר\n  יַעֲשֽׂוּן׃</p>\n  \n  <p>and enjoin upon them the laws and the teachings, and make known to\n  them the way they are to go and the practices they are to follow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This verse is explained by Chazal as referring to proper behavior between man and his neighbor, and going beyond the letter of the law, by means of which the people will sanctify the Name of Heaven through praiseworthy behavior:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דתני רב יוסף (שמות יח, כ) והודעת להם זה בית חייהם את הדרך זו גמילות\n  חסדים [(אשר) ילכו זה ביקור חולים בה זו קבורה ואת המעשה זה הדין אשר\n  יעשון זו לפנים משורת הדין:</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara cites a source for going beyond the letter of the law in\n  the performance of mitzvot. As Rav Yosef taught in a baraita with\n  regard to the verse: “And you shall teach them the statutes and the\n  laws, and shall show them the path wherein they shall walk and the\n  action that they must perform” (Exodus 18:20). The baraita parses the\n  various directives in the verse. “And you shall teach them,” that is\n  referring to the structure of their livelihood, i.e., teach the Jewish\n  people trades so that they may earn a living; “the path,” that is\n  referring to acts of kindness; “they shall walk,” that is referring to\n  visiting the ill; “wherein,” that is referring to burial; “and the\n  action,” that is referring to acting in accordance with the letter of\n  the law; “that they must perform,” that is referring to acting beyond\n  the letter of the law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, explains the Chafetz Chaim, Yisro was saying that teaching them the letter of the law is not enough. Moshe needs to teach them midos and derech eretz, and then the burden of leading the people will be lightened, and he will not get worn down.</p>\n\n\n",

Further, this man lives in a kind of desert. On the other hand, his strange behavior leads people to stay away from him. This second aspect is highlighted by the translation you quoted and is congruent with the Metsudat David comment on the verse in Kohelet.</p>\n\n<p>If you ask about the difference between Tishomem and Tishtomem, we can easily answer that Tishomem is also an hitpael, sometimes, the chirik on the first syllabe is accentuated and the Tav is \"swallowed\". I'm not sure it's right because here we have a small dog chirik, without the letter yud. I may see an indirect allusion to this pshat in the <strong>Ibn Ezra</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>....תסור מדרך הישוב כמו שיעשו הר\"ומיטי בארץ אדום וישמעאל וכן אם בקשת להתחכם יותר מדאי</p>\n  \n  <p>You will move away from the society, as did hermits in Edom and Yishmael countries. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"You will make\" this, so, Tishomem is not a passive form, but rather an active form, without object complement. And because \"you do it to yourself\", this is a transitive form, an hitpael.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In conclusion the right understanding of the Rambam is a paraphrase of the verse from Kohelet, following the pshat of Ibn Ezra, not as the English translation that follows the pshat of metsudot, the translator identified the paraphrase but he didn't use the a translation adapted to the intent of the Rambam.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Based on this it is permitted to pour water over\n  tea leaves (making sure not to break the laws of cooking on Shabbat -\n  aiyn bishul achar afiya and kil shlishi) that are in a strainer, as\n  the tea just flows through the strainer, absorbing the tea taste, and\n  out the other side (see Shmirat Shabbat 3, 64 [Hebrew, new edition],\n  and the Chazon Ish, Orach Haim, 53).</p>\n  \n  <p>This is exactly the use of the\n  coffee filter that sits on the top of a cup.

    "content": "# How could Yocheved be conceived\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.46.15.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">brings</a> the <em>Midrash</em> that Yocheved was born as Yaakov's family arrived in Egypt. They had to migrate due to the devastating famine.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Rashi earlier <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.41.50.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">points out</a> that we learn from Yosef that it's forbidden to be intimate with one's wife during a famine. This is learned out from the fact that the Torah stresses that Efraim and Menashe were born before the famine started. This halacha is codified in Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.240.12\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 240:12</a>).</p>\n\n<p>How then was Yocheved conceived by Levi during the famine? I admit I'm assuming he kept this <em>halacha</em> just like Yosef, as I see no reason why Yosef would follow it and not the rest of his family. Otherwise how could we learn anything from Yosef's behavior; maybe he was just being extra pious.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the Shulchan Aruch brings a special dispensation for those who have not yet fulfilled <em>pru urvu</em>, having a boy and girl. However, I don't see how this helps, as Yosef also didn't have a boy and <strong>girl</strong>, yet the Torah stresses that he abstained from his wife.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>I just discovered that many <em>Rishonim</em> address this question. For example:</p>\n<p><strong>Tosafos</strong> to <strong>Taanis</strong> 11a s.v. אסור לאדם</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אסור לאדם לשמש מטתו בשני רעבון - ואם תאמר הרי יוכבד נולדה בין החומות ואותו העת עת רעב היה וע\"כ שימשו מטותיהן בשני רעבון ויש לומר דלכ\"ע לא הוי אסור אלא למי שרוצה לנהוג עצמו בחסידות ויוסף לא שימש אבל שאר בני אדם שימשו</p>\n<p>If you ask, Yocheved, who was born between the walls, and at that time it was a famine, so it must be they were intimate during the famine...an answer is that it's not prohibited for everyone, just those who want to act with extra piety. Therefore Yosef was abstinent but not others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Chizkuni</strong> to <strong>Genesis</strong> 41:50</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>י\"ל דיוסף היה לו לפרוש מתשמיש המטה לפי שאביו ואחיו שרויין בצער אבל לוי שהיה יודע שאין מחסור לאביו לא היה לו לפרוש, ואם בשביל יוסף לא אסרו הדבר בשביל היחיד.</p>\n<p>You can say that Yosef should have been abstinent since his father and brothers were suffering in the famine. Levi however knew that his family wasn't lacking, so he didn't need to abstain. If [you'll ask] he should have abstained because of [the pain of] Yosef, the matter isn't forbidden just because of an individual.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>Chizkuni</strong> seems to understand the prohibition relates to having family members suffer. Not sure where he got that. Regardless, <strong>Rav Chaim Paltiel</strong> gives the same answer in the name of <strong>Rabbeinu Elchanan</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Daas Zekeinim</strong> and <strong>Hadar Zekeinim</strong> <em>ad. loc.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמר ר' יהודה החסיד דמה שאסור לשמש מטתו כגון נביא ששמע מפי הקדוש ברוך הוא שעתיד להיות רעב כגון יוסף שידע הדבר בבירור על ידי חלום פרעה אבל לוי שלא היה יודע הדבר בבירור לא היה נאסר לו</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Yehudah HaChossid</strong> answers that it's forbidden only for a prophet who is told in prophecy that there will be a famine, like Yosef, who knew through the dream of Pharaoh. Levi however didn't know as clearly, so intimacy wasn't forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They give a second answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש מתרצין דלוי ויוסף פליגי בפלוגתא דתנאי דפליגי במסכת יבמות דאיכא מאן דאמר התם מצות פריה ורביה שני זכרים ואיכא מאן דאמר דלא קיים עד שיוליד זכר ונקבה. ולוי סבר כמ\"ד עד שיוליד נקבה ג\"כ ולפיכך שמש כי עדיין לא נולדה לו נקבה ואמרינן במס' תענית חשוכי בנים משמשין מטותיהן בשנ' רעבון כדי לקיים מצות פריה ורביה. ויוסף ס\"ל כמ\"ד שני זכרים ולפיכך לא רצה לשמש כי כבר קיים</p>\n<p>Some answer that Levi and Yosef disagree how many children are needed to fulfill <em>pru urvu</em>. Levi held that until you have a boy and a girl, so he continued to be with his wife during the famine as the <em>gemarra</em> says those without children are permitted to be together during a famine. Yosef however held that you've fulfilled the <em>mitzvah</em> with two boys, so he didn't want to further be with his wife once he fulfilled the <em>mitzvah</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hadar Zekeinim</strong> to <strong>Genesis</strong> 26:8 also says this answer, and adds two more:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עוד י\"ל דלילה ראשונה של טבילה מותר. וי\"ל דאינו אסור אלא ברעב שיש לו קצבה כגון של יוסף שהיה זמן הרעב קצבה שבע שנים</p>\n<p>You could further answer that the first night after the <em>mikveh</em> is permissible. Also you can answer that it's only forbidden during a famine that has a set time, such as the one of Yosef which was set to be 7 seven years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Subsequently I found an interesting explanation from the <strong>Panim Yafos</strong> to <strong>Numbers</strong> 26:59. He suggests that we actually hold you <em>can't</em> be intimate during a famine, even to fulfill <em>pru urvu</em>, because the woman isn't commanded in that <em>mitzvah</em> (<strong>Yevamos</strong> 65b). However, she <em>is</em> commanded in the Rabbinic <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>lasheves yetzara</em>, which obligates her to have at least one child (<strong>Shulchan Aruch</strong> <em>Even HaEzer</em> § 1). That means they're allowed to procreate during a famine if and only if he needs to fulfill <em>pru urvu</em> <em>and</em> she needs to fulfill <em>lasheves yetzara</em>.</p>\n<p>We know Yocheved was Amram's aunt through her father but not through her mother (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.58b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Sanhedrin</strong> 58b</a>). Meaning, Amram's father Kehas was only half-siblings with Yocheved, as they shared Levi as a father. That means Levi had at least one other wife besides Yocheved's mother; i.e., Kehas' mother. Perhaps he only had sons with that wife, but never had any daughters. For him there was a <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>pru urvu</em>, and perhaps Yocheved's mother never had <em>any</em> kids. She was then obligated in <em>lasheves yetzara</em>, and both of them were permitted to procreate. Yosef's wife on the other hand already had two sons, so there was no permit for them to procreate further during the famine.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yaakov's family wasn't subject to the famine. He had plenty of money and was in the process of purchasing grain, which was for sale to the public, from Egypt when Joseph revealed himself. Perhaps if he had no more money or grain was no longer for sale it would have been forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there are commentators who posit that Yaakov miraculously had plenty of food and only sent the brothers to purchase food so neighbors won't be covetous of him.</p>\n\n\n",

One is what are the parameters of a \"nickname\" that is problematic, and another is what is meant by the punishment of \"no share in the world to come. Regarding the first issue, there are a number of relevant Talmudic passages. In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=58b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 58b</a> we find the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר ליה אביי לרב דימי במערבא במאי זהירי א\"ל באחוורי אפי דאמר רבי חנינא הכל יורדין לגיהנם חוץ משלשה הכל ס\"ד אלא אימא כל היורדין לגיהנם עולים חוץ משלשה שיורדין ואין עולין ואלו הן הבא על אשת איש והמלבין פני חבירו ברבים והמכנה שם רע לחבירו מכנה היינו מלבין אע\"ג דדש ביה בשמיה</p>\n  \n  <p>Abaye asked R. Dimi: What do people [most] carefully avoid in the West [sc. palestine]? — He replied: putting others to shame.  For R. Hanina said: All descend into Gehenna, excepting three. 'All' — can you really think so! But say thus: All who descend into Gehenna [subsequently] reascend, excepting three, who descend but do not reascend, viz., He who commits adultery with a married woman, publicly shames his neighbour, or fastens an evil epithet [nickname] upon his neighbour. 'Fastens an epithet' — but that is putting to shame! — [It means], Even when he is accustomed to the name. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/babamezia/babamezia_58.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=20b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanit 20b</a> we have the following passage:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאלו תלמידיו (את רבי זירא ואמרי לה) לרב אדא בר אהבה במה הארכת ימים אמר להם מימי לא הקפדתי בתוך ביתי ולא צעדתי בפני מי שגדול ממני ולא הרהרתי במבואות המטונפות ולא הלכתי ד' אמות בלא תורה ובלא תפילין ולא ישנתי בבית המדרש לא שינת קבע ולא שינת עראי ולא ששתי בתקלת חברי ולא קראתי לחבירי בהכינתו ואמרי לה בחניכתו</p>\n  \n  <p>The disciples of R. Adda b.\n  Ahaba asked him: To what do you attribute your longevity? — He replied: I have never displayed\n  any impatience in my house, and I have never walked in front of any man greater than myself, nor\n  have I ever meditated [over the words of the Torah] in any dirty alleys, nor have I ever walked four\n  cubits without [musing over] the Torah or without [wearing] phylacteries, nor have I ever fallen\n  asleep in the Beth Hamidrash for any length of time or even momentarily, nor have I rejoiced at the\n  disgrace of my friends, <strong>nor have I ever called my neighbour by a nickname given to him by myself,\n  or, some say by the nickname given to him by others.</strong> (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Taanith.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a very similar account in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=27b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 27b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאלו תלמידיו את רבי זכאי במה הארכת ימים אמר להם מימי לא השתנתי מים בתוך ד\"א של תפלה ולא כניתי שם לחבירי ולא ביטלתי קידוש היום אמא זקינה היתה לי פעם אחת מכרה כפה שבראשה והביאה לי קידוש היום</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Zaccai was asked by his disciples: In virtue of\n  what have you reached such a good old age? He replied: Never in my life have I made water within\n  four cubits of a place where prayers have been said, <strong>nor have I given an opprobrious epithet to my\n  fellow,</strong> nor have I omitted [to perform] the sanctification of the [Sabbath] day. I had a grandmother\n  who once sold her headdress so as to bring me [wine for] the sanctification of the day. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These latter two passages make it seem as if not nicknaming someone is an act of special righteousness, while the first passage made it seem that nicknaming someone is one of the worst things you can possibly to.</p>\n\n<p>Tosafot on the passage in Taanit explains that it's only a derogatory nickname that is problematic but a positive nickname is fine:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בהכינתו. פירוש בכינוי שמכנין אותו בן אדם לגנאי בחניכתו פי' כינוי שם משפחתו שם לווי כמו שם חניכת אבות בגיטין עד עשרה דורות כגון רבי אברהם אבן עזרא שכל בני משפחתו היו נקראים כך ודוקא לגנאי אבל לשבח מותר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosafot on the passage in Megillah explains that the especially praiseworthy act described is that the sage wouldn't even use a <em>non</em>-derogatory nickname. And the passage in Bava Metziah is referring to degrading the family name:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא כניתי שם לחבירי. אפילו כינוי דלא הוי גנאי והא דאמרינן דהמכנה שם לחבירו אין לו חלק לעולם הבא היינו בכינוי של פגם משפחה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, according to Tosafot a nickname which degrades the family name is what forfeits your share in the world to come, a neutral nickname and a positive nickname are permissible, and certain righteous individuals refrained from even these (certainly neutral names, unclear about positive names).</p>\n\n<p>Rambam in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=149\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Deiot 6:8</a> writes simply:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כך אמרו חכמים המלבין פני חבירו ברבים אין לו חלק לעולם הבא לפיכך צריך אדם להזהר שלא לבייש חבירו ברבים בין קטן בין גדול ולא יקרא לו בשם שהוא בוש ממנו ולא יספר לפניו דבר שהוא בוש ממנו</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Sages said: \"A person who embarrasses a colleague in public does not have a share in the world to come.\" Therefore, a person should be careful not to embarrass a colleague - whether of great or lesser stature - in public, and not to call him a name which embarrasses him or to relate a matter that brings him shame in his presence. (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910346/jewish/Deot-Chapter-Six.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=5&perek=3&halocha=14&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Teshuva 3:14</a> he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש עבירות קלות מאלו ואעפ\"כ אמרו חכמים שהרגיל בהן אין להם חלק לעוה\"ב וכדי הן להתרחק מהן ולהזהר בהן ואלו הן המכנה שם לחבירו והקורא לחבירו בכינויו </p>\n  \n  <p>There are other sins which are less severe than those mentioned. Nevertheless, our Sages said that a person who frequently commits them will not receive a portion in the world to come and [counseled] that these [sins] be avoided and care be taken in regard to them. They are:</p>\n  \n  <p>one who invents a [disparaging] nickname for a colleague; one who calls a colleague by a [disparaging] nickname; (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911896/jewish/Teshuvah-Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Yaakov Ben Asher formulates the law as follows, in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=cm_x10243\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur C.M. 228</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויזהר אדם מלכנות שם לחבירו כדי לביישו אפילו שהוא רגיל באותו כינוי כיון שכוונתו לביישו</p>\n  \n  <p>A man should be careful of nicknaming his fellow in order to embarrass him, even if [the fellow] is accustomed to this nickname, since his intent is to embarrass him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is repeated by R. Yosef Karo in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=cm_x10570\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch C.M. 228:5</a>, R. Mordechai Yaffe in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14588&st=&pgnum=207\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Levush C.M. 228:5</a>, and R. Yechiel Michel Epstein in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14241&st=&pgnum=102\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan C.M. 228:2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>R. Avraham Azulai in his glosses to the Levush writes, based on Tosafot above, that degrading the family name forfeits your share in the world to come (whereas apparently a general derogatory nickname is only forbidden but does not forfeit your share in the world to come):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'ובשם של פגם משפחה אין לו חלק לעולם הבא תוס' מגילה כ\"ז ב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding the second issue, of what it means to forfeit your share in the world to come, in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/88742/13438\">this answer</a> I cited a couple of sources arguing that such statements are hyperbolic. Additionally, Rambam in his Commentary to the Mishnah (Sanhedrin 10:1) writes as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכבר הזכירו דברים זולת אלה שהעושה אותם אין לו חלק אמרו המלבין פני חבירו ברבים אין חלק לעולם הבא והקורא לחברו בכנויו והמתכבד בקלון חברו לפי שלא יבוא מעשה מן המעשים האלו ואף על פי שהם קלים לפי מחשבת החושב כי אם מנפש חסרה שלא הגיעה לשלמות ואינה ראויה לחיי העולם הבא (Kafih translation)</p>\n  \n  <p>And they have already mentioned other things besides these that one who does them does not have a share. They said that one who whitens the face of his friend in public has no share in the world to come, and one who calls his friend by his nickname and one who glorifies in the disgrace of his friend, because though these actions are insignificant in the mind of the thinker they only come from a lacking soul that has not reached perfection and is not fitting for the life of the world to come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, according to Rambam, it may be that this act itself does not <em>cause</em> one to lose his share of the world to come; rather, such an act is indicative of the type of person who would anyway not have a share in the world to come.</p>\n\n\n",

The article's conclusion is that the references attributed to Jesus describing God as a \"father\" are essentially similar to contemporary rabbinic usage, although perhaps slightly different in that the \"father\" role is portrayed more actively in Jesus's usage. Nonetheless, as your question hints, modern Jewish and Christian theology treat the concept of God's \"fatherhood\" extremely differently. As the article states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While a common theological ground is recognized, the Christian understanding of divine fatherhood in relation to Jesus, rather than as a universal metaphor, is deeply at odds with the Jewish understanding, expressed in the Hebrew Bible and in rabbinic literature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Throughout the story of Yetzias Mitzraim, Hashem tells Moshe, and Moshe tells Paroh, to send “My nation” out of Mitzraim (Shemos 3:7, 3:10, 5:1, 7:4, 7:16, 7:26, 8:16, 8:17, 9:1, 9:13, 10:3, 10:4). Guess who leaves? Not all the Jews - just the 20% of them who wanted to leave and join Hashem’s nation (Rashi to Shemos 13:18). Perhaps we see from here that when the word עמי or עמך is used, it only refers to those who are עושה מעשה עמך, just as by Yetzias Mitzraim, only those who were בעושה מעשה עמך actually left. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of practical Halacha, do we apply the exposition of עושה מעשה עמך to these mitzvos as well? For instance, is there still an obligation to give a poor person tzedakah if he is a Rasha? Does the exposition apply anywhere that the term עמך appears, or can we only apply it where we have a tradition that it can be applied?</p>\n\n<p>I should clarify: Even if the Halacha <em>is</em> that there is no obligation to give tzedakah to wicked poor people, I’m only looking for answers that derive this Halacha specifically from the term עמך. </p>\n\n\n",

The incorrect vocalization of דְזָבִין was taken from Wikipedia, which is, Wikipedia.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, as cited by WAF, the Frank dictionary does claim that the correct text is זְבַן, meaning sell. </p>\n\n<p>However, the question still stands because a sampling of my printed collection seems to yield both results. </p>\n\n<p>A בּ should not be vocalized זַבִּין for 'sell' past tense, rather זַבֵּין (based on Frank grammar, p. 59).

I think it makes more sense to say the goat was owned by the father, and conquered by the babylonians than to say the goat was sold by the father (Hashem), because if the goat was sold to someone else, then the father becomes irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>I looked through a bunch of <em>Haggados</em> we have at home (we have a lot), and <em>in all of them</em> I found the Hebrew text of דְּזַבִּין, yet translated bought.

Non-Jew (\"goy\") life is held in much lower regard. </p>\n\n<p>As an example, just recently in 2012, the most highly-esteemed religious leader and halachic rule-maker among Sepharadi Jews in Israel, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, <a href=\"https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4229407,00.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ruled</a> that a doctor should <em>not</em> violate even the commandment of observing the Sabbath to save the life of a Non-Jew. But this is an example of a \"in principle X but in practice opposite-of-X\": Yosef ruled that because the law requires otherwise (and there are all sorts of reasons to respect non-Jewish state law), it is ok to violate the Shabbat; and that doctors can use a Halachic \"trick\" to get around the restriction by working in teams of two; etc.</p>\n\n<p>This continues a long line of ambiguous rulings of the same character, which forbid, yet effectively-allow violating the Shabbat to save a Goy (excerpt taken from <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/01-27-03/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יסוד ההיתר כדי למנוע סכנה מיהודי מבואר בחת\"ס יו\"ד קלא, ודברי חיים או\"ח ב, כה. וכ\"כ אג\"מ או\"ח ד, עט; רשז\"א בשש\"כ מ, הערה מז; צי\"א ח\"ח טו, ו; ח\"ט יז, א; יבי\"א ח, לח. ויש להוסיף שלרמב\"ן (הוספות לעשה טו), מחללים שבת על הצלת גר תושב. וכן דעת רשב\"ץ. ויש אומרים שגם בלא קבלת המצוות בפני שלושה מי ששומר בפועל שבע מצוות נחשב כגר תושב (מהרי\"ץ חיות, רמ\"ד פלאצקי). וכ\"כ הרב רבינוביץ' במלומדי מלחמה מג. ולדעת רבים אין מחללים שבת על גר תושב, וגם אין כיום דין גר תושב. אבל לכל הדעות מצילים כמבואר למעלה. ובבית חולים שמתנהל על פי ההלכה, יש להעדיף לקבוע בשבת תורנות לרופאים ואחיות גויים, ואם יגיעו חולים גויים, יטפלו הגויים בגויים. ואם הגיע גוי עם מחלה שהרופא היהודי מומחה יותר ברפואתה, ורגילים בימות החול לפנות אליו במקרים שכאלה, יטפל הרופא היהודי בחולה הגוי, גם במלאכות דאורייתא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So you have Rabbi Moshe son of Nachman, Rabbi Moshe Sofer (the Hetem Sofer), Rabbi Shimon son of Tzemah Duraan etc. - and these are Halachic heavy-weights going back many many centuries.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the examples I gave so far are just about the Sabbath, which is a relatively \"weak\" commandment, i.e. there are quite a few excuses for violating it. And on the other end of the spectrum, the super-strong commandments are not violable, as the other answers suggest. </p>\n\n<p>What I really can't tell you is what the deal is with the in-between commandments. For example, is it allowed (in practice) to steal in order to save a Goy's life? I'm sure some Halachic scholars have considered these questions, but better-versed people than me would need to fill you in on that one.</p>\n\n<p>PS - The lives of non-Jews are sometimes forfeit, or you are even commanded to just kill them. For example, non-Jews living in the lands which the Jewish god has promised to Jews/Hebrews - the fundamental principle is that they need to be exterminated, including men women children and livestock see <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy%2020&version=NIV\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy chapter 20, verses 16-18</a>. But this is not done in practice, and two millennia of post-biblical Halachic scholarship basically say otherwise. I've only provided this quote to emphasize how these things are complex and have contradicting layers of what is required in principle.</p>\n\n\n",

Were just the mitzvot presented to other nations or the entire Torah as given to Moshe?</p>\n\n<p>I don't believe this is a dupe because other questions simply ask why it was offered to other nations.

Do you have a <em>yetzer hora</em>?\"</p>\n\n<p>One answer given in <em>seforim</em> (source ...) is that the exact wording of the Torah had not yet been finalized.  The letters were, but not the exact <em>tzerufim</em>.  (Similar to one explanation of Moshe writing the last 8 verses בדמע - mixed up, not \"in tears\".)  As such, the Torah as given to the angels could have been formalized differently.  I imagine a similar answer could be given for other nations.</p>\n\n<p>A simpler answer is that the the Torah would have been offered to the Jews regardless.

So, eating need a bracha because it overrides the isur (by the way, see SA oc 204, in nos'e keilm, some poskim said that if he feels bad because of the fact that he eats prohibited food, there is no really hanaa and he cannot bless), the mitsva however, per se, cannot override the isur, because to lose a mitsva is not physically lethal. So, without the nutritional need, he will not make it (in the case of achilat matsa), so he is patur and cannot bless for the mitsva.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, it's stated that one doesn't fulfill the mitsva eating tevel</p>\n\n<p>Psachim 2.5</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל לא בטבל, ולא במעשר ראשון שלא ניטלה תרומתו, ולא במעשר שני והקדש שלא נפדו.  חלות תודה ורקיקי נזיר--עשאן לעצמו, אין יוצא בהן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we have an answer from svara, the cause of the infraction is the need to eat, not the need to fulfill the mitsva, so the mitsva is not a duty, and the beracha is on the Tsivui, and this is demonstrated, in several mishnayot regarding birkat hamazon, eruvin, matsa and Maror, one of the cases is quoted as example.</p>\n\n<p>In poskim.Rambam is one of the Rishonim who exempt from blessing on a prohibited food anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the birkot hanehenin for prohibited foods in a situation that allows their consuming (Bet Yosef OC 196, 204),, there are several opinions in rishonim, Rambam, Raavad, Rosh, Rabenu Yerucham, Rashba, Rosh. The discussion addresses bracha rishona an acharona, (bhm and motsi). The reason of the opinions that one  does bless is the hanaa. Regarding birkat hamitsva, despite that the mitsva is to be nehene (to eat), the hanaa is not the cause of the mitsva, but one the conditions, so no one of our poskim addressed a chyuv to bless bircat Hamitsvot. We need to  check our assumption in BY OC 196, here is a quote around a passage of Yerushalmi.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גרסינן בירושלמי פ\"ק דמסכת חלה תני <strong>מצה גזולה אסור לברך עליה א\"ר אושעיא על שם ובוצע ברך נאץ ה' הדא דאמרה בתחלה אבל בסוף דמים הוא חייב לו רבי יוסי אומר אין עבירה מצוה א\"ר אילא אלה המצות אם עשיתן כמצותן הרי הן מצות ואם לאו אינם מצות. ומשמע דלרבי יוסי ורבי אילא בסוף נמי אינו מברך על מצה גזולה.</strong> ואין לדחות ולומר דאדרבה משם ראיה דטעמא דמצת מצוה היא הא לאו הכי שפיר מברך עליה דהא איכא למימר דבה\"מ נמי מצוה היא דכתיב ואכלת ושבעת וברכת והא דנקט מצה להודיעך כחו דר' אושעיא דאע\"ג דאיכא נמי מצות מצה מברך בסוף. וההיא דהרי שגזל חטים וכו' נמי כדברי הרמב\"ם דייקא לפום נוסחי דידן שכתוב בהם כיצד מברך אין זה מברך אלא מנאץ דמשמע דמתמה כיצד אפשר שיברך והלא אם היה מברך אינו אלא מנאץ הלכך לא יברך...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can follow a reasoning regarding mitsvot - hanaa comparison, our topic. One of the sides argued that there is no proof from Yerushalmi that one cannot bless on prohibited food. Because the Yerushalmi, is discussing birkat \"al achilat matsa\".  Birkot hanehenin are different and are related to hanaa.  (This is our svara above!). The second size, that stands up for Rambam, and says that the Yerushalmi is a proof that one cannot bless on a piece of isur. In a first time, BY says that can interprete that the pshat of the first svara, is: One needs to bless regarding birkat hamazon but not birkat \"Al achilat matsa\". He refutes this svara, because BHM is a mitsva as well. So one cannot bless neither birkat al achilat matsa nor birkat hamazon. Just to be clear, assuming that one need to bless birkat hamazon, this doesn't imply that one need to bless birkat Al achilat matsa. Birkat hamazon is different from \"Al achilat matsa\", BHM is a mitsva about satiety state, but not an independent duty, note that it's nusach doesn't contain \"asher kiddeshanu...\". It's a \"result\" of eating, a mitsva to thank for satiety. Anyway, the Yerushalmi unanimously taught that there is never bracha for achilat matsa, and even if there is bracha on food.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe that I missed details, if something is wrong, I will be thank if someone reports an error. </p>\n\n\n",

In contrast to the majority teachings of todays Christian theologists who teach that Aramaic was the most common language of the time, older Christian sources confirm that Hebrew was spoken, and Aramaic had a certain importance, too.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is only a partial answer:</p>\n<p>In the aforementioned time, Judaism had already spread out widely. Jews lived in Syria and Persia (today mainly Iraq), where Aramaic was the common language, in the Mediterranean areas where Greek was the common language, in Ethopia, where Geez was the common language and probably also in Arabia and Yemen where Arabic was the common language and in southern Egypt where people spoke Coptic.</p>\n<p>It is sure that Hebrew has always remained the language that a Jew living abroad learned when he had an education in religion. Nevertheless, Hebrew was a foreign language to them as it later was for Jews spread around the world.</p>\n<p>The crucial question is what language would usually have been spoken in the Main Lands, Judea and the Galilee (also in Samaria, situated in between, which followed a different sect of Jewish religion).</p>\n<p>Christian scientists in the late 20th Century often stated that Hebrew was not used as a common language among the inhabitants of Judea and the Galilee but rather they spoke Aramaic. The thesis that Greek was the most common language is hardly ever defended.</p>\n<p>Now, we observe that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many texts of the Tanakh were written after the Babylonian Captivity. Almost all of them were written in Hebrew, not in Aramaic. It is certainly false to say that the Jews who returned from the Babylonian captivity had abandoned Hebrew for Aramaic. Else, the contemporary texts that speak of the Babylonian Captivity or the re-establishment of the Temple would have been written entirely or partly in Aramaic.</li>\n<li>Only a part of the Jews was brought to Babylon. There must have remained a common people in the Main Land; there was no other people settling in the Land; it would not have been possible that the prisoners returning from Babylon could establish a Jewish people without any reported conflict. It is not likely that those people had abandoned their language.</li>\n<li>Hebrew dominates religious texts in the <a href=\"https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> even if they were written in the community (thus in their time), but Aramaic was used to a smaller extent, also Greek, even few Latin.</li>\n<li>Greek was certainly the most international language in the greater area after Alexander the Great conquered the whole region; many people, including the Romans, used Greek to communicate with people speaking other languages. It is likely that many people in the Land of Israel knew some Greek but it is unlikely that common people used it speaking to each other.</li>\n<li>After the destruction of the 2nd Temple, texts were still written in Hebrew, above all the Mishna. The fact that the Gemara of the Babylonian Talmud is written in Aramaic is logical as it was written in Babylon where Aramaic was spoken.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These arguments speak in favour of the thesis that Hebrew remained the most important language at least in religious context, but possibly also in common life.</p>\n<p>In the following centuries, Greek was not a commonly learned language in Judaism, whereas even educated Christians hardly ever learned Hebrew. On this background, the importance of Greek in Jewish religion and culture is under-estimated in Judaism and over-estimated in Christianity.</p>\n<p>There is enough evidence that Greek was not the language commonly spoken in Eretz Israel at this time. Still, there remains the open point: Was language was commonly used among common people Hebrew or Aramaic?</p>\n<p>Although this is a historic question rather than a question on Religion, contributions showing signs in favour of one or the other will be welcome.</p>\n\n\n",

(The details being what we find out in 14:12, namely, that the people said that they would rather be slaves in Egypt than die in the wilderness.)</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_Pentateuch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samaritan Pentateuch</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=SP%7Creference=Exod.6&options=UVNHG\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">version of 6:9</a> has an additional clause in which it is explicitly stated that the Israelites told Moses that they would rather stay as slaves in Egypt than die in the wilderness:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וידבר משה כן אל בני ישראל ולא שמעו אל משה מקצר רוח ומעבדה קשה <strong>ויאמרו אל משה חדל נא ממנו ונעבדה את מצרים כי אוב לנו עבד את מצרים ממותנו במדבר</strong></p>\n<p>And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. <strong>And they are saying to Moses: leave us please and we shall serve to Egyptians because it is good for us to be servants of Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=SPE%7Creference=Exod.6&options=VNHUG\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">STEP translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether this is due to a differing original text or a later interpolation, it apparently agrees with Ibn Ezra and Ibn Kaspi about when the Israelites actually said this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Ephraim_Luntschitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Ephraim Luntschitz</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49295&st=&pgnum=49\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to 14:12</a>) acknowledges that Rashi's explanation requires elaboration. He explains that when the Israelites in 5:21 said \"to give a sword in their hands to kill us\" they meant that even if they would escape Egypt the Egyptians would chase after them and kill them in the wilderness. Thus, in 14:12 when the Egyptians have chased after them and are about to kill them, they tell Moses that this is exactly what they had said would happen back in 5:21.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, when we look at Rashi's source in the Mechilta it appears that it is not actually saying that the Israelites said this in 5:21. Rather, in 5:21 the Israelites merely expressed their distress over the slavery. Later when many of their brethren died during the Darkness, that was even more distressing to them. Now when the Egyptians are about to kill them in the wilderness it is even more distressing than when their brethren died during the Darkness (because at least their brethren were properly buried and eulogized). Thus, it seems that 14:12 should be read as only the first half of the quote being an actual quote, while the second half is actually the explanation of the quote. That is to say, rather than reading it as <em>we said \"leave us be and let us serve Egypt, for it is better to serve Egypt than to die in the wilderness\"</em> we should read it as <em>we said \"leave us be and let us serve Egypt\" because it would have been better for us to serve Egypt than to die out here in the wilderness</em>.</p>\n<p>This point is elaborated on by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Mizrachi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Elijah Mizrachi</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19159&st=&pgnum=140\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">supercommentary to Rashi 14:12</a>), who notes that this has to be the case because at the time of 5:21 they were still in Egypt so it wouldn't have made sense for them to say then that they would rather be slaves in Egypt than die in the wilderness.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_David_Luzzatto\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Samuel David Luzzato</a> notes (commentary to 14:12) the Samaritan version which has the Israelites actually saying this in 6:21, but he argues that there would be no reason for them to have thought of dying in the wilderness when they were suffering the backbreaking labor in Egypt. And if they <em>did</em> somehow think of it then the verse would be inaccurate since it says that the reason why they didn't listen to Moses was due to the hard labor and their low spirits, when the real reason was that they made a calculated decision that slavery was better than death in the wilderness. He therefore also cites the Mechilta's interpretation, apparently understanding it to mean that the Israelites added in the second half of the statement now in 14:12 (that it would have been better to remain as slaves in Egypt).</p>\n\n\n",

But to what extent should the parents enforce halacha on them?  If they write on Shabbat, stop them?  If they scream bloody murder because they want a glass of milk shortly after a meat meal, let them scream?  If they play with an electric toy on Shabbat, confiscate the toy (note: the toy is muktzeh!) What is the extent of required enforcement?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It all depends on the age of the children. The older they become, the more we teach them about positive and negative commandments. To start from a practical example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.616.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA OC 616:2</a> writes about training children to fast on Yom Kippur (summary from <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=2388\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dailyhalacha.com</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Shulhan Aruch rules that children under the age of 9 should not\n  fast at all on Yom Kippur. Below age 9, according to Maran, there is\n  no concept of Hinuch (training in Misvot) with regard to fasting on\n  Yom Kippur, and thus these children should be fed on Yom Kippur just\n  as they are on any other day of the year. Once a child reaches age 9,\n  the Shulhan Aruch then writes, he or she should be trained to fast for\n  a brief period of time. For example, if a child normally eats\n  breakfast at 8am, on Yom Kippur he should be fed around an hour later,\n  at 9am, so he begins training to fast on Yom Kippur. If the child is\n  weak and it is important for him or her to eat at the regular time,\n  the Shulhan Aruch adds, then the training should begin a year later,\n  when the child is ready.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Shulhan Aruch then rules that once a boy or girl reaches the age\n  of 11, he or she is required Mi’de’rabbanan (on the level of Rabbinic\n  enactment) to observe the Yom Kippur fast and fast the entire day.\n  (Ashkenazim follow a more lenient view, and maintain that youngsters\n  should begin observing the full fast later.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These rules can change over time based on the evolution of children (see <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=1713\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a modern take on the rules above).</p>\n\n<p>More generally, as R Shraga Simmons <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/jewish-law/daily-living/4-Children-and-Halacha.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, in order that children are properly trained to perform the\n  mitzvot when they reach the age of obligation, parents must accustom\n  them at an earlier age. This is a rabbinic mitzvah known as chinuch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You ask about negative mitzvot</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once a child can comprehend that a particular act is forbidden, the\n  parents should teach the child to refrain from the action. This stage\n  typically occurs at age 4.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, a parent must restrain a young child from violating a\n  mitzvah. For example, if a mother observes her toddler taking a\n  crayon to draw on Shabbat, she should stop him from doing so. Or if a\n  father hears his daughter speaking lashon hara, he must gently correct\n  her behavior.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is forbidden to give a child (of any age) something that will cause\n  him to violate a commandment. For example, one may not feed non-kosher\n  food even to an infant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/jewish-law/daily-living/4-Children-and-Halacha.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a> at length for positive <em>mitzvot</em>, further advice and sources.</p>\n\n\n",

The king was Pharaoh, who started by saying \"I don't know Hashem\" but eventually was forced to recognize Him; the priest is Yisro, who declared \"Now I know that Hashem is greater than all other powers.\"</p>\n<p>So that makes it appropriate for the parsha in which the Torah is given to be named for Yisro, who made it possible.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Understanding תוד״ה תפילין on קידושין דף לו ע״א\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.36a.2-14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 36a</a>) cites a view that women are exempt from the prohibition on balding themselves in mourning. <em>Rava</em> there says that we know of this exemption because the same words \"between your eyes\" are used in Scripture when describing that prohibition and when describing tefillin which we know women are exempt from. <em>Abaye</em>, however, says we know of the exemption elsehow. The Talmud continues:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why doesn't <em>Abaye</em> say like <em>Rava</em> [that we know the exemption from \"between your eyes\"]? He'd answer you: For tefillin themselves, we learn a rule from this [similarity of wording]. Just as [for balding, \"between your eyes\"] means a place where one makes a bald spot — the high part of the head — likewise [for tefillin] the location at which to place them is the high part of the head.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.36a.2-14?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Kiddushin.36a.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Tosafos</em>, commentary ad loc.</a>, ask:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So what [if \"between your eyes\" is used to learn a rule from balding oneself to tefillin]? Nonetheless let's learn a bald spot from tefillin [also], for there's no <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/gemara/the-13-rules-of-rabbi-yishmael/methodology2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>g'zera shava</em></a> by halves, and let's say that just as women are exempt from tefillin they're exempt from the balding [prohibition]!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Maybe the <em>g'zera shava</em> was learned only to teach the location for placing tefillin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I fail to understand this answer. The very question was that there's no halfway <em>g'zera shava</em>; so what's the answer? \"Yes, there is!\"? Is there or isn't there? If there is, what was the question? If there isn't, what's the answer?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(For what it's worth, <em>Tos'fos Harosh</em> give what seems to be the same answer, worded differently: \"He holds that the <em>g'zera shava</em> was said not to teach requirement and exemption but only to explain what 'between the eyes' is.\" My question is the same on this as on <em>Tosafos</em>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: What follows is my own interpretation that I have not seen  in any commentaries, so feel free to be skeptical of it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary: The difference between the question and the answer is that the question assumes we are dealing with a true <em>gezeirah shavah</em>, while the answer rejects that assumption.</strong></p>\n<p>I would suggest that Tosafos's answer is that we are not dealing with a true <em>gezeirah shava</em>. A true <em>gezeirah shavah</em> links two cases that would not necessarily be related, and tells us that the same law (or laws) that apply to one case apply to the other case. Tosafos's question assumes that this is a true <em>gezeirah shavah</em>. As such, the law that women are exempt from <em>tefillin</em> should carry over to balding themselves.</p>\n<p>Tosafos's answer then comes and says that this is not a true <em>gezeirah shavah</em>. Rather, this is simply an example of using one case to figure out what an ambiguous term means. The term \"between your eyes\" is ambiguous. When it comes to <em>tefillin</em> we are unsure what it means. Does it mean that the <em>tefillin</em> must be on your forehead between your eyes, or does it mean that the <em>tefillin</em> should be on the top of your head?</p>\n<p>We can use the case of balding to determine what the ambiguous term means. As Rashi (ד\"ה תפילין) explains, when it comes to balding it is obvious that the prohibition of balding must apply to an area where there is hair. As there is no hair on the forehead, \"between your eyes\" perforce cannot mean \"on your forehead\". Once we know from the case of balding that \"between your eyes\" does not refer to the forehead, we can go back to <em>tefillin</em> and determine that since the <em>tefillin</em> are supposed to be \"between your eyes\" it must be somewhere on top of your head and not on your forehead.</p>\n<p>In other words, no law was derived from the case of balding. The only thing we used that case for was to figure out what a term meant. We arrived at the law for <em>tefillin</em> not via applying a law from balding, but by simply reading the Torah with our newfound knowledge of definitions.</p>\n<p>Since you mentioned Tosafos HaRosh, I would argue that this fits particularly well into the language used there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דקסבר דלא נאמרה ג\"ש ללמד חיוב ופטור אלא לפרש היכן הוא בין העינים</p>\n<p>For he holds that the <em>gezeirah shavah</em> was not said to teach obligation or exemption, but to explain where \"between your eyes\" is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. the <em>gezeirah shavah</em> was not to teach us any laws, but to define a term.</p>\n<p>Now let's see if this explanation can fit with the remainder of Tosafos (not mentioned in the question). Following this understanding, Tosafos then asks why <em>tefillin</em> cannot be placed anywhere on the head. If the term \"between your eyes\" can be defined by what it means in the case of balding, then <em>tefillin</em> should be able to be worn anywhere on the head just like the prohibition of balding applies to anywhere on the head.</p>\n<p>This, I believe, fits with the above explanation. If we can use the case of balding to define the term \"between your eyes\" we can't select only half of the definition to apply to <em>tefillin</em>. We have to accept the entire definition, which should lead to the conclusion that <em>tefillin</em> can be worn anywhere on the head, since that is the full extent of what \"between your eyes\" means.</p>\n<p>Tosafos then answers this question by saying that if it was true that <em>tefillin</em> can be worn anywhere on the head, why did the Torah write \"between your eyes\"? It should have simply written \"on your head\". Thus, we <em>do</em> accept the entirety of the definition gleaned from the case of balding, but there is an external reason why <em>tefillin</em> cannot be worn anywhere on the head, namely, because there is an implicit exclusion of the rest of the head by the fact that the Torah chose not to use the term \"on your head\".</p>\n<p>This, too, fits with the above explanation. Tosafos is still holding to the idea that the \"<em>gezeirah shavah</em>\" is really just a definition, and we can still explain how the laws of <em>tefillin</em> can seem to not incorporate the entirety of the definition.</p>\n<p>Then Tosafos has a follow-up question on this latest answer. If it is true that the Torah's use of \"between your eyes\" instead of using \"on your head\" is an implicit exclusion of the rest of the head (even though the term \"between your eyes\" technically includes the entire head), why don't we make the same argument in the case of balding and say that the prohibition does not apply to the entire head because if it did then the Torah would have used the term \"on your head\"?</p>\n<p>Again, this still fits with the above understanding. Tosafos is merely testing whether the latest answer is actually a valid answer, and it appears that it is not.</p>\n<p>Tosafos then answers this question as well, by saying that while it is true that in a vacuum the non-use of \"on your head\" would be an implicit exclusion of the rest of the head, when there is a specific reason to not use the term \"on your head\" this implication would not hold true. In the case of balding there is a specific reason to not use the term \"on your head\", namely, that by using \"on your head\" we would lose the opportunity of using the case of balding to figure out what \"between your eyes means\". We would then be stuck in the case of <em>tefillin</em> not knowing that \"between your eyes” does not refer to the forehead. Thus, the Torah was \"forced\" to use the term \"between your eyes\" for an external reason; therefore, the failure to use the term \"on your head\" cannot be taken as an implication that the rest of the head is excluded.</p>\n<p>This last answer also fits with the idea that the <em>gezeirah shavah</em> was not a true <em>gezeirah shavah</em>. When all the dust settles there are still no laws being transferred from one case to the other. All that has happened is that we have used the definitional knowledge gleaned from one case to understand the text in another case, and the Torah was written this way deliberately to allow us to glean that knowledge.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וי\"ל דשמא לא נגמרה ג\"ש אלא לאשמועינן מקום הנחת תפילין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After reminding us the rule of reciprocity of gezera shava (his first understanding of \"there is no gezera shava for half\"), Tosfot answered that Amorayim have a Kabala from Sinai that the gezera shava regards the  teaching of tefilin's position only. </p>\n\n<p>Now we can understand the teruts of tosfot helping us by question it generates (the second kushia of Tosfot help to understand his answer above). [Note that Tosfot Harosh doesn't ask this second question].</p>\n\n<p>Indeed Tosfot changes the definition of \"There is no gezera shava for half\". Let's look at the new definition. Since we know (by kabala) that some gezerot shavot are \"one way\" only, the true definition of \"there is no GS for half\" is: We need to learn all the characteristics of the teacher for the student, not a part of them only. \nAs a result of this, we have a new kushia, the kushia of Rabenu Meir. He asks, the place of tefillin needs to be the whole scalp as the place of the korcha!? The teruts is that the choice of the words \"between your eyes\" in tefilin teach us acccurately  their place.</p>\n\n<p>So, asks Tosfot between the lines, as a result of this, why the same words in korcha of parashat Kedoshim is not restrictive?</p>\n\n<p>Teruts, because in korcha of parashat Kedoshim, the word is mufne (specially added) for gezera shava, his significated is not primary. But in tefillin, the words are needed for the pshat.</p>\n\n<p>The Yad Malachi paragraph 30 discusses the definition of Tosfot for gezera shava lemechtsa. He cites our Tosfot for his conclusion.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Tosfot doesn't say that it's a \"false gezera shava\" that teach definition of words or group of words only, as we find sometimes in Talmud (¹), because the Gemara makes the count of gezerot shavot and counts it. But Tosfot is examining what is the kind of masoret of this gezera shava. Here, Tosfot understands that the signified is the mekubal from Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>Tosfot have reference to different ways of oral transmission for gezera shava. This issue is addressed by Ramban on his critics on Sefer Hamitsvot, also quoted in Halichot Olam.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פעמים נמסרו <strong>המקומות לבד</strong> כלומר פלוני ילמוד מפלוני נשארו תיבות הגזירה שוה לחכמים לדון איזו הן כגון הך דפרק אלו נערות גבי אונס ומפתה דילפי אהדדי בגזירה שוה דאשר לא אורשה ומקשה ואימא בתולה לגזירה שוה משמע שקבלו מרבן דאונס ומפתה למדין זה מזה בגזירה שוה אבל לא קבלו מאיזו תיבה ולכך חוזר הגמרא לידע ולעמוד על התיבות המופנות לגזירה שוה ההיא ופעמים נאמרו <strong>התיבות סתם</strong> מלה פלונית תלמוד ממלה פלונית כגון טומאתו טומאתו לגזירה שוה פרק קמא דשבועות ולא נמסרו המקומות והחכמים מבקשים מנוח לתיבות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sometimes Gemara's wises know which parashiot are linked but not by which words, Sometimes, they know the words but not the parashiot. </p>\n\n<p>Tosfot appearently added to the list, in his conclusion a third category, sometimes they know what is the \"teacher\" and what is the \"student\". </p>\n\n<p>So, we can understand that Tosfot and Tosfot Harosh you cited don't say the same thing [an argument in favor of this is the lack of the kushia of Rabenu Meir in Tosfot Harosh, because this kushia applies only to true gezera shava]. Tosfot \"Tuch\" wrote the same teruts as Tosfot Harosh on the name of Rabenu Shimshon (the broad text of Tosfotim ancestor of our condensed Tosfot). Tosfot Harosh says that it's a false gezera shava. (This pshat is dachuk, because Gemara says that whis this gezera shava we can learn that korcha is for men only from tefillin). But Tosfot says that the din of position of tefillin is transmitted, and the gezera shava contains this teaching only. Right,  there is no gezera shava lemechtsa, but Tosfot formulated a new definition of this concept.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, the Ramban in chiddush has a very convincing pshat.</p>\n\n<h2>How long is the way of Tosfot</h2>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(¹):  <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/tohen.asp?id=782\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">  הליכות עולם</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן כל מקום שאומר נאמר למעלה ונאמר למטה אינו גזירה שוה גמורה שקבלה מרבותיו אלא כמו ילמוד סתום מן המפורש. כי ההוא דבבא קמא נאמר שדה למעלה ונאמר שדה למטה מה שדה האמור למעלה דניזק אף שדה האמור למטה דניזק וכו'. וכן הרבה כיוצא בזה.‏ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, he did a lot of Mitzvos also and he's promised a part in the WTC as all Jews are.</p>\n\n<p>Can he trade in the Heavenly court his merits for his punishment?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578197576.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Making Sense of Suffering</em></a>, adapted from the speeches of Rabbi Yitzchak Kirzner, who, in turn, seems to have adapted the large majority of his work from the Ramchal in Derech Hashem (beginning <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derech_Hashem%2C_Part_Two%2C_On_Personal_Providence.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, mostly), discusses this.</p>\n\n<p>To explain his premise, let me provide his analogy. Consider a person who ingests poison. Naturally, his body will attempt to purge it from its system by throwing it up. Likewise, when a person sins, he \"ingests\" spiritual poison. The natural response is to vomit, which is what suffering attempts to do.</p>\n\n<p>With that background, here is his argument (beginning on p. 78) that what you describe is impossible:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If everything is for our benefit, isn't there a better way for G-d to deal with us? After all, we are basically decent people. We may have done some things wrong, but we can think of a lot more good that we have done. Why can't G-d just subtract the bad from the good and leave us with a net surplus of good? [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>If we keep in mind the function of punishment, we can answer this question. We explained that transgression changes us in a way that prevents us from developing a complete relationship with G-d: We introduce something negative into our system which blocks our connection with the Higher Realm. Punishment repairs the damage by cleansing us, or altering our circumstances, to allow for the continued development of our relationship with G-d.</p>\n  \n  <p>If transgressions only caused the equivalent of a pain in the toe – if they merely restricted incidental activities, while leaving us functioning normally – then we could talk about trading a transgression for a good deed. But transgression cripples the whole system.</p>\n  \n  <p>By tying us more closely to the physical world, it hampers us in our attempt to draw close to G-d. Trying to reach G-d while still under the influence of our misdeeds is like trying to understand a profound discussion under the influence of a powerful sedative.</p>\n  \n  <p>The effects of transgression must be erased in order for us to experience the rewards for our good deeds. We must shake off the sedative, so to speak. That is what punishment does; it reduces our attachment to the physical aspects of life.</p>\n  \n  <p>Good deeds and sins exist on two completely different planes. Thus one can no more be subtracted from the other than apples from oranges. Good deeds are expressions of the soul projected onto the physical world. They reflect our connection to an infinite level of being and bind us to G-d. Sin, on the other hand, is an expression of our over-attachment to the finite, physical world.</p>\n  \n  <p>Because good deeds express our eternal essence, their reward is eternal. Because our transgressions are related to the physical and transitory within us, their consequences need not reach beyond the finite time frame of this world. To trade a good deed for a sin is like sticking a gold coin in a soda machine. If the coin is the right size, it will buy you a can of soda. But a soda only costs a quarter while the gold coin can buy a palace.

When he arrived in Egypt and was reminded of how he escaped from Pharoh, he called his son Eliezer which means G-d aided me.  Shemos 4,20 says that they both went to Egypt*:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויקח משה את אשתו ואת בניו וירכבם על החמר וישב ארצה מצרים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When the Jews were commanded to do the Korban Pesach it says Shemos 12,48:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכי יגור אתך גר ועשה פסח לה' המול לו כל זכר ואז יקרב לעשתו והיה כאזרח הארץ.<br>\n  When the convert converts and lives among you and makes a Paschal lamb he shall first circumcise and then he can bring it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mechilta says on that Parshas that it apply for all future generations:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זאת חוקת הפסח בפסח מצרים ובפסח דורות הכתוב מדבר, דברי רבי יאשיה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So when Tzipora went back to Midian she probably told her father Yisro that he could convert to Judaism after she told him about how they went out of Egypt.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*See Rashi however who says that when they were about to arrive in Egypt Aharon told Tzipora to return. According to this Yisro might not have known about whether converts were accepted but he still pushed to try and convert just like Ruth did after she was initially rejected by Naomi.

However, for one who's unable to change the punishment seems otiose and useless.</p>\n\n<p>In the afterlife, we're allegedly judged in the Heavenly court and sentenced for our misdeeds to some form of punishment - but for what purpose, if we're helpless and unable to change?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is the concept discussed in many books. Not to delay in doing Teshuvah while alive. And the levels are, for example mentioned in Sefer hayashar 13, right after you sin, a long time after continued sinning, when the sin no longer satisfying, when he is sick, when he is in great distress, when he finds a teacher, when he’s old, when he’s dying. </p>\n\n<p>This Teshuvah improves oneself in a spiritual manner. The ideal location for this improvement is before death. Sometimes one is improved with יסורין (physical punishments) as an atonement to get to this improvement. So it says in Yerushalmi, Sanhedrin 10.1, that יסורין can atone. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>העובר על הכריתות ומיתות בית דין במזיד התשובה ויום הכיפורים מכפרין מחצה והייסורין מכפרין מחצה ועליו הוא אומר ופקדתי בשבט פשעם וגו' </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The goal of this improvement is to get to gan eden (Even Shleimah 10.13). Gahenim is one of three things which must pass over a person before he gets to gan eden (ibid. 10.12). Gehenom is like fire, and it is painful for the נשמה (ibid. 10.33,32). </p>\n\n<p>Teshuvah during life can save one from Gehenom, even if he has already been determined to die (ibid. 10.24). In general, gehenom will remove the spiritual impurities (ibid. 10.31). </p>\n\n<p>So, the point is to change while it’s still in your hands. Otherwise, spiritual ‘punishment’ will accomplish that, for you failed to do so, and can no longer. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578197576.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Making Sense of Suffering</em></a>, adapted from the speeches of Rabbi Yitzchak Kirzner, who, in turn, seems to have adapted the large majority of his work from the Ramchal in Derech Hashem (beginning <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derech_Hashem%2C_Part_Two%2C_On_Personal_Providence.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, mostly), discusses several reasons why one may suffer.

    "content": "# Are questions of the form “Why is XYZ true of this Sidrah” “valid”?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, where the weekly Sidra breaks start and end are somewhat arbitrary: it doesn’t seem to matter how long the Sidros are, as long as there are enough Pesukim for seven aliyos, each of which are at least three Pesukim, cannot begin or end in certain places. The only restrictions, seemingly, is that the Tochacha in Bechukosai is read before Shavuos and that the Tochacha in Ki Savo is read before Rosh Hashanah. </p>\n\n<p>Yet many questions are asked about why certain Sidros are the way they are: the famous question of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/5764/9682\">why Moshe’s name is missing from Tetzaveh</a>, Rabbi Dovid Feinstein’s <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/66012/9682\">sefer on the notes on the Sidros’ Pesukim counts</a>, etc. etc. </p>\n\n<p>As the Sidros seem to be pretty much arbitrarily broken up, such questions seem to be invalid. “Why does Tetzaveh lack Moshe’s name?” I dunno, because his name happens to be missing from those Pesukim, and whoever broke up the Sidros decided to make a Sidra split in those places such that Moshe’s name gets cut out? Such questions seem to be based on a false premise.</p>\n\n<p>Yet many Gedolim still ask such questions (refer once again to Rav Dovid Feinstein’s Sefer, for instance). Is there something wrong with my logic? Are they just asking according to the common minhag, not that there’s anything inherent in the Sidros, per se? What am I missing here that such questions are asked without hesitation?</p>\n\n\n",

(See e.g. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&st=&pgnum=326&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>How is this number arrived at?</p>\n\n<p>By my count, if one uses <em>ta'am tachton</em> for the Ten Commandments there are 75 verses in the <em>sidrah</em>.

A nice overview is given in the Likutei He'aros Mesorah, who assumes that this happened by accident:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Exodus, Chapter 20 contains 20 verses according to the Eastern tradition, but 22 verses according to the Western tradition . The Eastern tradition counts 10 verses in the Ten Decrees, counting one verse for each Decree, while the Western tradition counts 12 verses. Thus, according to the Eastern tradition, Exodus contains 1207 verses, and Parashath Yitrô contains 72; while according to the Western Masoretic tradition, the book contains 1209 verses and the parasha contains 74. If we consider all the different traditional verse divisions (counting a verse for every occurrence of sillûq, in both upper and lower accentuation), there are 26 verses. Many modern printed editions have 23 verses in Chapter 20, following the Western tradition except for separating the first two Decrees, which are combined in the Western tradition. <strong>The printed editions that show the upper accentuation in Yithro often count 19 verses. They mistakenly combine the first two Decrees as the Western tradition does, thus counting 9 verses in the 10 Decrees. In doing so, however, they mix the upper and lower accentuations.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Minchas Shai <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/Minchat_Shai/Shemot/19.24#m7e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> quotes Chizkuni, who lists the te'amim as many chumashim have them, in an arrangement which would leave 9 pesukim in the ta'am ha'elyon according to his view.  He gives the reason that it is because the first two dibros were said together, but it's possible that he is making the same mistake as the others mentioned above, and that this was simply a mix up:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גם בדברות אנכי ולא יהיה לך יש נגינה גדולה לעשותן שתיהן פסוק אחד לזכרון שבדבור אחד נאמרו, כיצד בתיבת אנכי פשטא ובתיבת אלהיך זקף קטן ובתיבת הוצאתיך תלישא ובתיבת מארץ מצרים קדמא ואזלא ובתיבת עבדים רביעי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are indeed 72 verses using the Ta'am Elyon split up. I counted on Mechon Mamre.</p>\n\n<p>That's 62 for the rest of the Parsha and 10 for the Ten Commandments.</p>\n\n<p>(It seems you stumbled upon a mistaken rendition of the Ta'am Elyon. Until quite recently, the two sets were always written overlaid. When various people started printing them separately, they unfortunately confused which notes went where and invented a half dozen different mistaken variations. Your question is but one proof of many.)</p>\n\n\n",

The Taz wrote that since it’s something which one cannot be careful about, they didn’t decree on it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To quote the Taz (DH biraglav v’eino chosheish) in full:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נראה דאע\"ג דא\"א שלא יהי' נימוח והוי פסיק רישיה מ\"מ לא גזרו בזה כיון דא\"א להזהר מזה בימות החורף דכל הארץ היא כך מלאה כפור וגליד והמנעלים הם לחים ונימס השלג שם:</p>\n  \n  <p>It seems that even though it’s impossible that it won’t be smoothed out, and it would be a Pesik Reisha [it will definitely occur if you do this action], nevertheless they did not decree on this, since it’s impossible to be careful about this in the winter, when the entire ground is full of frost and ice, and shoes are wet and melt(?) the snow there. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the Mishnah Berurah, that the leniency is that it’s unintentional, does this leniency apply when there is a path that’s not covered by snow? Do we say that since one <em>doesn’t</em> have to trample the snow, one should avoid it (or perhaps going on the snow anyway might indicate that one intends to crush the snow)?

Most early sources identify Mount Sinai with Jebel Musa or Mount Catherine on the southern Sinai peninsula, a five day journey (200 miles) from Egypt, and some 40 miles from the Red Sea (Ma'asoth Binyamin 24; Masa Rabbi Obadiah Bertenoro 3). According to this, Moses had traveled approximately 100 miles along the west coast of the Gulf of Aqaba.\n  There are some difficulties, with this, however, since this 'Mountain of God' seems to have been on a direct route between Midian and Egypt (Exodus 4:27), and not more than a three day journey (some 120 miles) from where the Israelites lived (Exodus 3:18). On the basis of this, it may be conjectured that Mount Sinai was Jebel Ya'llaq (some 32 miles from the northern end of the Gulf of Suez) or Jebel Sinn Bishr (60 miles due east of Bitter Lakes).

    "content": "# Did God really backup the Sun dial for Hezekiah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to 2 Kings 20:9-11., Hezekiah while on his deathbed, was visited by the prophet Isaiah. The King was about to die so he asked for a sign as proof that G-d would grant him a longer life. Isaiah said he could ask G-d to make the sun go 10 degrees forward. But Hezekiah insisted the shadow go ten degrees BACKWARD! Ten degrees is exactly 40 minutes!</p>\n\n<p>There is a story floating around about Mr. Harold Hill, President of the Curtis Engine Company in Baltimore Maryland from NASA who claimed to discover the \"missing\" day by using a computer to measure the exact positions of the sun and moon. But this has been debunked since it was a copy from a book by Prof C. A. Totten of Yale, written in 1690.</p>\n\n<p>So did G-d make the sundial of Ahaz moved backward? We know this is impossible since the earth rotates around the sun. It could have been that G-d turned the earth, but the earth is moving at 1000 miles per hour, so this would throw everyone off balance, creating total chaos. Some rabbis claim Joshua 10:8 is speaking of a poem. So what does commentary like the Ralbag or Rambam have to say of Hezekiah? Was this metaphors, allegory, or a miracle?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Indeed, Ralbag in his commentary there rejects the straightforward understanding of this miracle. For such a miracle to occur, nature would be changed in ways surpassing any of the miracles performed even by Moses whom no miracle-performer can actually surpass. In fact, for Hezekiah to even ask for such a miracle would be utterly foolish, which, based on context, is not an adjective we wish to apply to Hezekiah.</p>\n<p>If I understand it correctly, Ralbag's interpretation goes something like this: The rays of the sun are sometimes refracted by the movements of the clouds. Where a ray should have hit point A it might end up hitting point B. Now the miracle was going to be that the clouds would move in such a way as to make the rays of the sun move 10 <em>ma'alot</em> (however you want to translate that) from where it was. Hezekiah saw that the natural conditions present, such as wind, mist, etc. were such that the clouds would have been moving in one direction anyway, so that Isaiah saying that the sun's rays would move in that direction would not be much of a miracle. Instead Hezekiah demanded that the natural movement be reversed, and the clouds move in the opposite direction from where they would have been moving based on the natural conditions. Thus, the miracle was that God spontaneously moved the clouds in the opposite of their natural direction to a point where they would refract the rays of the sun 10 <em>ma'alot</em> from their original position.</p>\n<p>Thus, nothing actually happened to the Sun or Earth. Thus, it would not be a miracle that  would surpass those of Moses, nor would it utterly destroy the world.</p>\n<p>In Milchamot Hashem (Wars of the Lord) Book VI Part 2 Chapter 12 Ralbag discusses this again, saying the same basic idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If someone were to raise the question of the miracle of the shadow [moving backward] performed [by Isaiah] for Hezekiah — which might be thought as entailing a change in the order of the movements of the sun —  we reply to him [as follows]. It is obvious that this miracle did not result from a change in the order of the motion of the sun. If it had, Scripture would not have attributed this [backward] movement to the shadow but rather to the sun; for the movement of the shadow is consequent upon the motion of the sun. Moreover, if this were true [i.e., that the sun has changed its motion], it would not have been possible for Hezekiah to say \"It is a light thing for the shadow to decline [forward] ten degrees\". For it is not possible for the order of the sun's motion to be upset with respect to quickness any more than it is possible for [its regular motion] to be upset by reversing its motion; the miracle is the same in both cases. The miraculous element in this event is as follows. In a receiving [body] of some thickness, which operates like a mirror, the [reflection] of a heavenly body can be seen. This is the explanation of haloes and the rainbow, as has been demonstrated in the <em>Meteorologica</em>. Now when a cloud is under the sun, the sun is reflected in it. If this cloud moves quickly, it can move the ray of the sun along with it and cause the ray to be seen not in its proper place; for the cloud will have moved for a while before this impression disappears from it. It is in this way that when a cloud passes under the sun you see the ray of the sun not in its place. This is the explanation of what happens with flowing water: a man sees his reflection duplicated. Because of its quick motion in the water, in which the image is reflected, flows by and the image disappears from it only after it is reflected in another part of the water. [Now,] since Hezekiah had noticed the movement of the cloud in a certain direction, he said that it would be easy for the shadow to incline 10° in the direction of the motion of the cloud, because of the speed of that motion. But it would have been a miracle if the shadow had gone <em>backward</em> 10° in an opposite direction to that of the motion of the cloud. Thus, the miracle at that time consisted in the reversal of the cloud's motion from the direction it was going at the moment, as fixed by the prophet. It is evident therefore that the miracle did not occur in the domain of everlasting phenomena [i.e., the heavenly domain].</p>\n<p>(Feldman translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Possibly Hashem turned the sundial itself 10 degrees and caused the shadow to move that way</p>\n\n\n",

There is a lot that could be said about it, but I will write mostly about the more controversial aspects and differences in Jewish practice, rather than, for example, psychological insights.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yisra'el advocated taking the time to learn works of musar. Already in his <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14564&st=&pgnum=104\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Letter of Musar</a> (<a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/igeresHamussar.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">English</a>), he says that intellectual knowledge isn't enough; he recommends visualizing \"a sword between your legs and hell beneath you\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.7a.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Talmud</a> says this about a judge; he explicitly generalized this statement to everyone). Learning musar was not just reading a book; after the intellectual understanding it had to be repeated <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14564&st=&pgnum=32\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"with an excited soul, a ready heart, a distraught voice, burning lips.\"</a> But even apart from his special method, his advocating actually learning musar at set times and at set places (he required <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14564&st=&pgnum=31\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a special place for this learning</a>), in addition to learning standard books of Torah, was a novelty. One of his students, Rabbi Simcha Zisel Ziv, opened up a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelm_Talmud_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Talmud Torah</a>, i.e. a yeshiva, in which musar was one of the prominently studied subjects, not only more traditional subjects such as Talmud. This was controversial and sometimes unpopular even within; in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshivas_Knesses_Yisrael_(Slabodka)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">another yeshiva</a> the students actually <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7265&pgnum=88\" rel=\"noreferrer\">revolted</a> against this type of learning and forced it to split into two.</p>\n\n<p>Another novelty with regard to Jewish practice was that ethical behavior is actually a law on par with other religious obligations. In his <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14564&st=&pgnum=105\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Letter of Musar</a> he bemoans the fact that while people are careful to eat kosher food, they are not careful in their business dealings. The Torah counts both of them as commandments, and yet people who would never violate the commandment not to eat non-kosher food aren't careful not to cheat in business.</p>\n\n<p>In other cases, Rabbi Yisra'el \"discovered\" unnoticed laws in the Talmud. One example would be <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14564&pgnum=114\" rel=\"noreferrer\">his close reading</a> of the law in certain cases (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Bava_Metzia.6.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Metsi'a 6:1</a>), that if two parties deceived each other, the only claim they have against the other party is \"a complaint.\" He learns from this that the right to have a complaint against someone is a legal right just like any other monetary claim. When the Torah allows you to have a complaint, you can have a complaint. Conversely, if you forgive the other party, you are no longer allowed to have a complaint against him, just like you wouldn't be allowed to demand his money if you had forgiven a monetary claim. (And, he continues, you can use this trick to stop fighting with a person: you can forgive him, which will legally forbid you to retain any anger against him.)</p>\n\n<p>For more information about the movement, you might want to read Rabbi Dov Katz's five-volume <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A8_(%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tenu'at Hamusar</a> (unfortunately not online) and <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/7265\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pulmus Hamusar</a> (about the controversy surrounding the movement). The primary source for Rabbi Yisra'el of Salant are his letters, nearly all published posthumously in Rabbi Yitschak Blazer's <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/14564\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Or Yisra'el</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Speaking as someone who works to revive ideas from the Mussar Movement... (My credentials in this regard : I teach for The Mussar Institute, whose target audience is primarily spiritually seeking non-Orthodox Jews, I founded the AishDas society, whose target audience is Orthodox synagogues, and I just came out with a Mussar text.)</p>\n\n<p>At the time Rav Yisrael Salanter came to the scene, Jewish Thought was split between Chassidus and the notion that our primary goal in life is a relationship with G-d, and the Lithuanian tradition which defined the goal in terms of self-refinement. I just wrote an <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/98986/1570\">answer about this to another question</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But to address the subject from within, as opposed to focusing on context...</p>\n\n<h2>Foundation Stories</h2>\n\n<p>There are two foundation stories about the birth of the Mussar Movement (which should not be confused with mussar as a whole).</p>\n\n<p>The first is where a young Yisrael Lipkin used to follow R’ Zundel Salanter around. Rav Zundel wanted to live privately, secretly, so Rav Yisrael had to sneak around to watch the actions of this ba’al mussar. One time, he followed Rav Zundel into the woods, where Rav Zundel engaged in passionate hispa’alus (pouring out his soul “with lips aflame”). (No, this really isn’t a Breslov story…) Suddenly, Rav Zundel turned around, made eye contact, and instructed, “ישראל, לערן מוסרת, אז דו זאלסט וערען א ירא שמים — Learn mussar so that you will be one who lives in awe of [the One in] Heaven!” In Nesivos Or it writes that Rav Yisrael Salanter called the moment a “thunderbolt” that changed his life.</p>\n\n<p>The second was a time on Yom Kippur when Rav Yisrael didn’t have a machzor with him. At one point he got lost, and needed to peer over the other person’s shoulder. He got shoved in response to his efforts. How dare you shterr my kavanah (harm my concentration)! At that point Rav Yisrael realized that he couldn’t keep Mussar to himself, and had to share it with the world.</p>\n\n<p>Hold onto those, I’ll get back to them.</p>\n\n<p>So to ask again: What is mussar?</p>\n\n<p>I’m going to answer that with a set of three triads.</p>\n\n<h2>First Triad</h2>\n\n<p>There are three ways to see the relationship between tiqun hamiddos (repairing the dimensions of one’s personality traits) and halakhah. They are far from mutually exclusive.</p>\n\n<p>1- The Rambam’s Hilkhos Dei’os describes the obligations specific to personality. They are obligations among other halakhah‘s other obligations.</p>\n\n<p>2- Without tiqun hamiddos, one is incapable of making the right decisions at the actual time one is faced with a choice. It is the means by which one is capable of following halakhah to an ever greater extent. Mussar is a central component to Judaism, but logically inferior to halakhah.</p>\n\n<p>While the first notion is universal, for even the gemara asserts (for example) “whomever loses their temper it is as though they worshiped idols”, this one is only nearly universal. It is not consistent with some forms of Chassidus. Chassidus is inherently experiential in nature. Breslov argues that trying to over-analyze or work at it would actually get in the way of the experience.</p>\n\n<p>3- The entire purpose of halakhah is to achieve sheleimus ha’adam (completeness of the person), to finish Hashem’s creation — “let us make man in our image”. The use of plural can be taken to include both Hashem and the person himself. Perfection of the “image” of G-d which by definition must be self made — as He is. Thus, all of halakhah is an exercise in tiqun hamiddos. Halakhah is logically a consequence of Mussar.</p>\n\n<p>And it is fair to assert that the two to coexist symbioticly, seeing mussar is the only way to fully follow halakhah and seeing halakhah as the critical means of achieving mussar‘s goal. Two sides of one integral whole.</p>\n\n<p>This notion is far from universal — it’s the sheleimus (personal wholeness) fork in the road of Jewish philosophy. Chassidus took the other route, deveiqus (cleaving to G-d). Others have argued non-personal perfection as a goal — perfection of society, or of the Jewish community. And Brisk would argue against the entire concept of defining goals; halakhah must be understood on its own terms.</p>\n\n<h2>Second triad</h2>\n\n<p>A rebbe-chaveir of mine, R’ Dr Ephraim Becker, describes mussar (in the third sense of the previous triad) as a three part thing:\n– There is the real, knowing where one stands\n– There is the ideal, knowing where the Creator wants us to be\n– There is the process of getting from the real to the ideal</p>\n\n<p>There is an interesting contrast in book titles. When R’ Yaakov Hillel wrote a book on Jewish philosophy, he called it “Ascending Jacob’s Ladder”. When Dr Alan Morinis documented his path back to classical Judaism by studying Mussar under R’ Yechiel Perr he titled his book “Climbing Jacob’s Ladder”. (Rabbi Perr is the rosh yeshiva of Derech Ayson, Far Rockaway NY, and scion of Novhardok three different ways.) Ascending, with no mention of work, vs climbing.</p>\n\n<p>To go to primary sources, note that Rav Zundel Salanter told the future Rav Yisrael Salanter “zal tzuzain a yarei Shamayim” — not to gain awareness of the significance of the One in heaven, but to become the kind of person who has such awareness. As I wrote above, Chassidus tries for deveiqus. The Mussar Movement asserted that one must try to become kind of person capable of deveiqus. There could be no other reason why deveiqus isn’t achieved. Hashem would leave no break between Him and us. The break is between us and ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>It is this notion of process, of climbing — literally “shteigin” — that is of value within nearly all derakhim, all paths, all approaches to the Torah. And thus lower case “m”, not specifically the Mussar Movement. The different derakhim define the ideal by stressing different aspects of it. Which will in turn suggests different paths, thus the name “derakhim“. But using tools to become the kind of person who can follow that path, to consciously pursue that derekh’s perspective on the end-goal, makes sense according to any derekh.</p>\n\n<h2>Third Triad</h2>\n\n<p>Note that the story with Rav Zundel portrays mussar as the route to becoming a yarei Shamayim. The one about the man who wouldn’t share his machzor for a moment focuses on his being so enraptured in Yom Kippur’s theme of teshuvah he neglects a central part of that — his relationship to the person standing next to him. It tells of the need to refocus the masses who were increasingly looking to rite, to defend our self-definition as Reform tried to tear it away. Following along the tefillah on Yom Kippur to the exclusion of more fundamental mitzvos. And that second theme is central to how R’ Yisrael is portrayed; most of the stories told about him are about being stringent in interpersonal mitzvos over common stringencies in mitzvos between man and the Omnipresent.</p>\n\n<p>Mussar is also very centrally a third theme — tiqun hamiddos. (Thus completing our last triad.) Whether it’s Mesilas Yesharim’s working up the ladder of middos up to divine inspiration or Cheshbon haNefesh’s list of middos that have more interpersonal implications. And this is true even in the “Hilkhos Dei’os” sense of Mussar, never mind the approaches in the first triad that make tiqun hamiddos even more central.</p>\n\n<p>We can view the goals of the Mussar Movement as creating a “holistic Jew”, one who works on his relationship with the Creator, with other people, and with himself. And compared to where the other man in shul and his ilk stood, that means a greater stress on interpersonal and intrapersonal (bein adam lenafsho, between man and his soul, as the Gra put it) mizvos than one sees in other paths to serving the A-lmighty. And if that’s true of 19th cent Lithuania, it’s even more true of today’s society, with its providing grist for “chumrah of the month club” jokes.</p>\n\n<p>That would explain why Rav Yisrael is so associated with stories stressing the interpersonal. Had the Judaism of his day been more centered on that, the stories retold about him would be about prayer, etc… E.g. the Mussar Movement promoted tefillah behispa’alus; a minyan no less passionate (and possibly no quieter) than anything found among Karliner chassidim.</p>\n\n<h2>Mussar Today</h2>\n\n<p>Using the real-ideal-path concept:</p>\n\n<p>Rav Kook taught a philosophy. He therefore defines an ideal, but no way to become the kind of person who can live up to it. For that matter, Rav Samson Raphael Hirsch doesn’t either. Rav Hirsch is closer to the Mussar Movement in ideal — both aim at a refined Jew. Different focuses on refinement, but it’s no coincidence both Slabodka and Hirsch’s Torah im Derekh Eretz produced well groomed, secularly informed, doers. But Rav Hirsch didn’t discuss the means to get there.</p>\n\n<p>Mussar in the loose sense is encapsulated in the notion of finding and following a path from the real me to the ideal me. It requires belief that tiqun hamiddos is a prerequisite for being able to follow halakhah. (In shorthand: Embracing the first triad, real-ideal-path, and at least the second but also possibly all three positions about the role of mussar in a halachic life.)</p>\n\n<p>This kind of Mussar can therefore be applied within most derakhim. One can live by Rav Hirsch’s definition of the ideal or the Tanya’s and still seek to transform oneself into the kind of person who better lives that ideal.</p>\n\n<p>And it is in that sense that AishDas strives to promote mussar.</p>\n\n<p>Mussar in the sense of the Mussar Movement requires embracing all three triads in full: adopting the notion that sheleimus ha’adam is the entire tachlis of the Torah, perfecting our tzelem E-lokim. And being whole can only be possible with full attention to all three relationships. Thus Rav Yisrael was lead to balancing all three of Shim’on haTzadiq’s pillars (Avos 1:2) equally: Torah’s perfection of the self, Avodas Hashem, and Gemillus Chassadim toward others.</p>\n\n<p>Notice what I’m excluding. I don’t see the darkness and harshness of the early Mussar Movement, with a focus on the evils of the yeitzer hara, keeping in mind the day of one’s death, the dark candle-lit room, etc… as defining for the Mussar Movement. Rather, mussar inherently is very subject to knowing where you are. And therefore, the same era that created the stereotype fire-n-brimstone preacher called for a very “dark” mussar. It’s as unfair to judge it from where we stand as it is to judge the role of tokhachah in contemporary Sepharadic maggidim.</p>\n\n<p>And thus, the Mussar Movement had to “repackage” itself repeatedly as people changed. Slabodka’s Gadlus haAdam is no less part of the Mussar Movement even if it dovetails well with contemporary Human Potential talk. (The Alter’s Yahrzeit is just four days away, on the 29th of Shevat.) And Rav Shelomo Wolbe (who is somewhat less of the movement, since it was really a casualty of Hitler) wrote in the 1970s about the need to focus on “planting and building” (to quote the title of his seifer on parenting) rather than pruning. Carrots, not sticks, are what work for today’s Jew.</p>\n\n<p>What killed Mussar? Mussar never survived the end of East European Jewry’s golden era. But why not, whereas Chassidus is rebuilding itself?</p>\n\n<p>Two yeshiva students noticed that of all the Slabodka graduates who built post-War yeshivos, only R’ Dovid Leibowitz (founding Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim) strived to build a mussar yeshiva. Not R’ Aharon Kotler, R’ Yaakov Kamenecki, Rav Hutner, Rav Kahaneman, etc, etc, etc… They actually went around the US asking these rashei yeshiva why. Rav Hutner’s answer is telling. He felt that the American student couldn’t handle the long work that real change requires. Rav Hutner therefore chose the more modest goal (in his opinion) of inspiring them with the Maharal’s thought.</p>\n\n<p>It is easy to be inspired by ideals. The trick is staring at the details, the step-by-step work, and still following through. And so today’s generation of Israeli Orthodox “seekers” find a home in some “chulent” Rav Kook’s and the Tanya’s philosophy and Breslover experiences and Carlebach minyanim. They do not search for a program, a plan for getting from here to there. In the US, Carlebachian Neo-Chassidus is popular because it provides inspiring experiences without that demand of the day-to-day attention to detail and following a spiritual discipline that defies America’s love of the “quick fix”. Rav Hutner, in the founding years of the American Orthodox community of today, thought all we can do is inspire people toward the ideal and hope for the best without conscious work or a plan to get there.</p>\n\n<p>Given the increasing lack of a holistic, three pillar, approach to Yahadus, demonstrating a real need for mussar, and the greater strength of the community and its educational system today providing opportunity, I believe we have a sizable population ready to work for something better. To set out and build idealists — of all the various ways we have formulated the Torah’s ideals.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>So, to summarize. The Mussar Movement asserted three essential points, the full acceptance of each of the above triads:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You need to consciously follow a process to reach qedushah (holiness).</li>\n<li>That process is the purpose of the Torah. Life is about the completion of the “image” of G-d within.</li>\n<li>The whole person is one who perfects his relationships with Hashem, other people, and his own soul. And thus, one can’t overlook interpersonal and intrapersonal mitzvos in the pursuit of qedushah.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The lessons of mussar have value to us today, even for those who choose to view the Torah using a different framework. But one must be willing to work for qedushah if they are to fully use their potential to obtain it.</p>\n\n<p>(Taken from my blog post, \"<a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/asp/what-is-mussar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What is Mussar?</a>\")</p>\n\n\n",

That alone defines \"successful prayer\". Getting what you request is secondary.</p>\n\n<p>But in other contexts he notes that the usual verb for prayer, <em>lehitpallel</em>, is in the reflexive, something we do to ourselves. Before Rabbi Soloveitchik, Rabbi SR Hirsch made the same observation. Successful prayer is thus a transformative one. Including the transformation that may be the one from someone who shouldn't have X, the requested item, in their lives, into someone who ought to. It could be that X was withheld until now in order to illicit that prayer. Or that getting X without turning to G-d would cause damage via egotism and thinking one was more accomplished or more capable than in reality. Or perhaps the old, unprayed, version of the person wouldn't be best-served by X for some entirely different reason that somehow changes through the process of prayer -- Hashem's equations are quite a bit more subtle than our intellects.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The question: Why does Hashem answer some prayers and not others?</p>\n\n<p>I am not saying that the following is an absolute answer, but Rashi appears to be saying in \"Tehillim - Psalms - Chapter 17\" that Hashem answers those who take refuge in Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>Reference: Psalms 17:7 <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16238#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16238#showrashi=true</a></p>\n\n<p>To me, this means, those who take refuge in Hashem receive answers as opposed to those who do not take refuge in Hashem; and therefore, such people (the latter ones) do not receive an answer to the situation they find themselves in. </p>\n\n<p>I can imagine somebody might also ask, \"what does it mean to take refuge in Hashem\"?

Taking this approach to the human condition is suggested by the notion of the Ran (Derashos haRan ch. 10) and his student R’ Yosef Albo (Seifer haIkarim 4:13),  who hold that the effects of sin are to dirty the soul and that the punishment of sin is that barrier blocking the soul’s access to Divine Good.</p>\n\n<p>The implication is that the sinful soul itself is fine, but it made for itself a layer blocking it from the Light. And in fact, the Ramchal (in the opening paragraphs of Mesilas Yesharim), among many others, articulates this as the goal we seek to accomplish with mitzvos, that they are acts that bring us closer to G d. In contemporary terminology, we would call this a deveiqus (/dbq/ = attach) approach.</p>\n\n<p>The other approach would be to assume the cup is flawed, perhaps its mouth could be widened, or there is a hole to repair. In this opinion, the purpose of life is to give us opportunities to perfect the self. Apparently this is the position of Rabbeinu Yona (Shaarei Teshuvah 4:1), who compares the soul of a sinner to someone who is sick. Just as a sick person suffers from his disease, so does a sinner feel the effects his deeds had on his soul. Teshuvah is a repairing or healing process. This leads to an approach to mitzvos, equally well represented (by R’ Yehudah haLevi in the beginning of the Kuzari as just one example) as the previous, the idea of man’s quest as temimus, or “sheleimus ha’adam”, the completion of man. Man’s goal in life is to strive for self-perfection.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the rishonim cited, the Ran, R’ Yosef Albo and Rabbeinu Yona, all define punishment as a consequence of the imperfection or barrier created by sin. Both sides of this machlokes are within the context of a “following doctor’s orders” or “preparing on erev Shabbos so that one may enjoy Shabbos” understanding of the mitzvos described in the above mentioned Mesukim article.</p>\n\n<p>The mitzvah of beris milah, the first mitzvah given to us as a people, is introduced with the words, “Ani E-l Shad-ai, his-halekh lifanai v’heyei tamim — I am E-l Shad-ai, walk yourself before Me, and be whole.” (Bereishis 17:1) How are we supposed to read this quote? Is the walking before G-d, deveiqus, that is primary, and being whole a side effect? Or, is being whole the focus of the pasuq, and walking before G d is a means to reach that temimus?</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we say in the Amidah for Shabbos and Yom Tov, “vetaheir libeinu le’avdecha be’emes – purify our souls to serve You in truth.” One can see this in two ways: We request from Hashem that He purify us, so that we may reach that deveiqus to serve Him truthfully and reliably. Alternatively, we could be requesting temimus, that purity which we are describing by its enabling us to serve Him.</p>\n\n<p>On another level, these two approaches are different aspects of the same idea. To achieve wholeness, so that the entire person is working harmoniously, he would necessarily be walking in Hashem’s path. The converse is equally true. If one strives for deveiqus to a singular G-d who has a single goal, how could he be a chaotic battleground of warring urges? Cleaving to G-d forces His priorities to be yours, thereby causing temimus, a wholeness and harmony of self.</p>\n\n<p>This is not to say that there is no distinction in approach. By stressing different elements, there are profound practical implications. For example, consider the debate between Chassidim and non-Chassidim on the importance of davening in the appointed times. (We should be clear that the Chassidic position is that one must invest time to prepare for davening, even if this is at the expense of timeliness — it is not blanket permission to ignore the clock.) Chassidus is a deveiqus-based hashkafah. Therefore, when weighing the relative merits, it is more important to be able to invest time to prepare one’s mind and heart for the act of tephillah, for relating to Hashem, than when the tephillah actually begins. To someone with a temimus orientation, however, zehirus, meticulousness, care in how each facet of the mitzvah is done, is the more important consideration. Zerizus, haste to do what’s right, is an important middah (personality trait). Both come into play when considering the timeliness of tephillah.</p>\n\n<p>Contemporary Orthodox Jewish thought embraces a number of variants of these two basic approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Most forms of Chassidus consider the route to deveiqus to be the experience of each act, with the focus on having one’s feelings in line with those we can perceive in the Creator. The Ba’al HaTanya, on the other hand, focused on Chaba”d (insight, comprehension and knowledge), to make one’s thoughts G-dly. In this he follows the Rambam, (Moreh Nevuchim III ch. 51) who writes that one’s connection to Hashem is strictly determined by the extent of one’s knowledge of Him.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there has been variation in the understanding of temimus. The Vilna Gaon writes, “the whole purpose of the Torah is to shatter the [evil] middos.” (Even Sheleimah, title, ch. 1) The Ba’alei Mussar took the idea further, and committed themselves to character improvement through means beyond halakhah as well. In Rav Samson Raphael Hirsch’s Neo-Orthodoxy, temimus translates to a well-rounded individual, using derekh eretz in service of Torah. To Rav Yosef-Ber Solovetichik zt”l, the goal of man is to maximize his creativity, to be in the image of the Creator (this is a major part of the thesis of Halachic Man; c.f. pg. 109)</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps this plurality is the whole point of the Torah’s doubled phraseology. Because there many approaches to accomplishing the same end, Hashem didn’t specify one to the exclusion of the other. “Derakheha darchei no’am, its ways are ways of pleasantness” (Mishlei 3:17) – ways, in the plural. Each community or person can pick out a derech that best suits him — as long as the goal is “his-halech lifanai v’heyei tamim”.</p>\n\n<p>(I have a more developed version of these ideas [the blog post was last updated in 2006] in Widen Your Tent, Mosaica Press, 2019, sec. i.2-3, pp. 10-21.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In my humble opinion, there is no true disagreement, but two levels of language. This is an element of answers only, but it lacks in the text of the two previous answers.</p>\n\n<p>The willingness to do good is from a \"Top to Down\" point of view, while the willingness to be recognized is from a \"Bottom to Up\" point of view. The two effects of the action of creating are planned in advance. \"סוף מעשה במחשבה תחילה\" said the poet Rabbi Shlomo Elkabats. The first thinking is about the final result. So to be recognized is the goal. But the motivation is the willingness to do good. Because g-d has no need, since he is already perfect. The world \"goal\" is broad and two opinions about his definition can lead to a false controversy about \"what is the goal?\" There are two narrowed senses and a broad sense that includes them.The one is the motivation, the second is the result expected. </p>\n\n<p>I understand this from the book Shomer Emunim Hakadmon from <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%A1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef Irgas</a>. </p>\n\n<p>First disputation,  paragraph 41.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהרי כל החכמים הסכימו דתכלית הבריאה היתה כדי להיטיב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All wises aggreed that the goal of creating was to do good.</p>\n\n<p>Explanation (partial), He has no need.

Therefore he fasted 100 times to forget that seder limud and went into the seder limud of Bnei Eretz Yisrael which are more in comfort, they don't enter into each others words, and even if there are rejections they try to uphold answers.

Namely like it is written in Isaiah 49:3-7, which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וַיֹּ֥אמֶר לִ֖י עַבְדִּי־אָ֑תָּה יִשְׂרָאֵ֕ל אֲשֶׁר־בְּךָ֖ אֶתְפָּאָֽר׃</strong>\n  וַאֲנִ֤י אָמַ֙רְתִּי֙ לְרִ֣יק יָגַ֔עְתִּי לְתֹ֥הוּ וְהֶ֖בֶל כֹּחִ֣י כִלֵּ֑יתִי אָכֵן֙ מִשְׁפָּטִ֣י אֶת־יְהוָ֔ה וּפְעֻלָּתִ֖י אֶת־אֱלֹהָֽי׃\n  וְעַתָּ֣ה ׀ אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֗ה יֹצְרִ֤י מִבֶּ֙טֶן֙ לְעֶ֣בֶד ל֔וֹ לְשׁוֹבֵ֤ב יַֽעֲקֹב֙ אֵלָ֔יו וְיִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לא [ל֣וֹ] יֵאָסֵ֑ף וְאֶכָּבֵד֙ בְּעֵינֵ֣י יְהוָ֔ה וֵאלֹהַ֖י הָיָ֥ה עֻזִּֽי׃\n  <strong>וַיֹּ֗אמֶר נָקֵ֨ל מִֽהְיוֹתְךָ֥ לִי֙ עֶ֔בֶד לְהָקִים֙ אֶת־שִׁבְטֵ֣י יַעֲקֹ֔ב</strong> <strong>ונצירי [וּנְצוּרֵ֥י] יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לְהָשִׁ֑יב</strong> <strong>וּנְתַתִּ֙יךָ֙ לְא֣וֹר גּוֹיִ֔ם לִֽהְי֥וֹת יְשׁוּעָתִ֖י עַד־קְצֵ֥ה הָאָֽרֶץ׃</strong>  <strong>כֹּ֣ה אָֽמַר־יְהוָה֩</strong> <strong>גֹּאֵ֨ל יִשְׂרָאֵ֜ל קְדוֹשׁ֗וֹ</strong> <strong>לִבְזֹה־נֶ֜פֶשׁ לִמְתָ֤עֵֽב גּוֹי֙</strong> <strong>לְעֶ֣בֶד מֹשְׁלִ֔ים</strong> מְלָכִים֙ יִרְא֣וּ וָקָ֔מוּ שָׂרִ֖ים וְיִֽשְׁתַּחֲוּ֑וּ לְמַ֤עַן יְהוָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר נֶאֱמָ֔ן קְדֹ֥שׁ יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל וַיִּבְחָרֶֽךָּ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>and <em>(He)</em> said to me, <strong>\"You are My servant, Yisra᾽el, in whom I will be glorified.\"</strong>\n  Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the L-rd, and my reward with my G-d.\n  And now, says the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring Ya῾acov back to him, that Yisra᾽el should be gathered to him, and I was honoured in the eyes of the L-rd, and my G-d was my strength.\n  And He said, <strong>\"It is too slight a thing that you should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Ya῾acov, and to restore the preserved of Yisra᾽el: I will also give you as a light to the nations, that My salvation may be to the end of the earth.\"</strong>\n  <strong>Thus says the L-rd, the redeemer of <em>Yisra᾽el, his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers</em>,</strong> Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall prostrate themselves, because of the Lord who is faithful, and the Holy One of Yisra᾽el, who has chosen thee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this closing idea is precisely the scenario described in the Rashi to Bereshit 1:1 which you quote.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That if the nations of the world state \"You are thieves! You conquered the land of the 7 nations!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When the nations express their abhorrence for Israel and how they despise them, we are to serve as a <em>Light to the nations</em>, <strong><em>serving Him</em></strong> to direct them back to proper service of G-d, the Creator of us all.</p>\n\n<p>And this is exactly what Rashi directs our attention to, as is found in Tehillim, chapter 111:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּמַה טַּעַם פָּתַח בִּבְרֵאשִׁית? מִשׁוּם כֹּחַ מַעֲשָׂיו הִגִּיד לְעַמּוֹ לָתֵת לָהֶם נַחֲלַת גּוֹיִם </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But to truly understand the context of this single sentence, it is appropriate to look at Tehillim 111:1-9.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>הַ֥לְלוּ יָ֨הּ ׀ אוֹדֶ֣ה יְ֭הוָה</strong> בְּכָל־לֵבָ֑ב <strong>בְּס֖וֹד יְשָׁרִ֣ים וְעֵדָֽה</strong>׃\n   <strong>גְּ֭דֹלִים מַעֲשֵׂ֣י יְהוָ֑ה</strong> דְּ֝רוּשִׁ֗ים לְכָל־חֶפְצֵיהֶֽם׃\n   הוֹד־וְהָדָ֥ר פָּֽעֳל֑וֹ וְ֝צִדְקָת֗וֹ עֹמֶ֥דֶת לָעַֽד׃\n   זֵ֣כֶר עָ֭שָׂה לְנִפְלְאֹתָ֑יו <strong>חַנּ֖וּן וְרַח֣וּם</strong> יְהוָֽה׃\n   טֶ֭רֶף <strong>נָתַ֣ן לִֽירֵאָ֑יו</strong> <strong>יִזְכֹּ֖ר לְעוֹלָ֣ם בְּרִיתֽוֹ׃</strong>\n   <strong>כֹּ֣חַ מַ֭עֲשָׂיו הִגִּ֣יד לְעַמּ֑וֹ לָתֵ֥ת לָ֝הֶ֗ם נַחֲלַ֥ת גּוֹיִֽם׃</strong>\n   מַעֲשֵׂ֣י יָ֭דָיו <strong>אֱמֶ֣ת וּמִשְׁפָּ֑ט</strong> <strong>נֶ֝אֱמָנִ֗ים</strong> כָּל־פִּקּוּדָֽיו׃\n   <strong>סְמוּכִ֣ים לָעַ֣ד לְעוֹלָ֑ם עֲ֝שׂוּיִ֗ם</strong> <strong>בֶּאֱמֶ֥ת וְיָשָֽׁר׃</strong>\n   <strong>פְּד֤וּת ׀ שָׁ֘לַ֤ח לְעַמּ֗וֹ צִוָּֽה־לְעוֹלָ֥ם בְּרִית֑וֹ</strong> קָד֖וֹשׁ וְנוֹרָ֣א שְׁמֽוֹ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Hallelujah. I praise the L-rd with all my heart in <strong><em>the assembled congregation</em></strong> of <strong><em>the Upright</em></strong>.\n   The works of the L-rd are great, <em>within reach of all who desire them</em>.\n   His deeds are splendid and glorious; His beneficence is everlasting;\n   He has won renown for His wonders. <em>The L-rd is <strong>gracious and compassionate</strong>;\n   He gives food <strong>to those who fear Him</strong>; He is <strong>ever mindful of His covenant</strong>.</em>\n   He <em>revealed to His people His powerful works</em>, in <em>giving them <strong>the heritage of nations</em></strong>.\n   His handiwork is <strong><em>truth and justice</em></strong>; all His precepts are <strong><em>enduring,\n   well-founded for all eternity, wrought of truth and equity.</em></strong>\n   He sent redemption to His people; He ordained His covenant for all time; His name is holy and awesome.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are two groups praising G-d, the <em>Yasharim</em> and the <em>Congregation</em>. The Yasharim refers to the children of Israel, those who are born Jews.</p>\n\n<p>The Congregation is referring to the rest of the nation of Israel, those who convert (גרי-צדק) according to Jewish law and also to the righteous from among the nations, those who are referred to as the <em>Children of Noach</em>. They accept upon themselves to keep the seven commandments of Noach. And this entire group is described a little further as <em>those who fear G-d</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It explains that G-d provides directly for the needs of those that <em>fear</em> Him. (It's worth pointing out that the word <em>fear</em> is related to the idea of <em>movement</em> and <em>action</em>, like is found in Tehillim 76:9. The emphasis being that we are expected to actually do what G-d commands us. <strong><em>Our action is the main idea.</em></strong>)</p>\n\n<p>It then goes on to explain that G-d revealed <em>His powerful actions</em>, a reference to the acts of Creation, to His people, the people Israel, in order to give to them the <em>inheritance of the nations</em>. That this refers to the individuals from among the nations who upon hearing how G-d is the Creator of us all, will be drawn close to Israel including even wanting to become an actual part of the Jewish people through conversion according to G-d's law.</p>\n\n<p>And as it concludes in Tehillim 111:9, Redemption was sent by G-d to His people, the people Israel, in order to connect (or command) His covenant to the world. That there is no place devoid of G-d.</p>\n\n<p>And so what Rashi is saying is that we are to tell the world that there is one G-d, the Creator of us all, who supervises all things and in truth, justice and kindness, maintains and judges the entire world according to His will. He gives and takes according to what is upright in His view, <em>not ours necessarily</em>. And it is only in that context that we, His people Israel, at this time, have come into possession of the land of Israel again. Not because of our strength or greatness, but only because the Creator of us all has willed it so.</p>\n\n\n",

There is to say: I might have thought that these words are by a wound caused by man, but for an ailment that comes from Heaven, when he heals, it appears like he’s contradicting the decree of the king; it comes to teach us that it is permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There seems to be two problems with Tosfos’ logic:</p>\n<h1>1. Why isn’t healing a wound caused by man also an issue of “it appears like he’s contradicting the decree of the king”?</h1>\n<p>Contrast with Shabbos 32a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תנא דבי רבי ישמעאל כי יפול הנופל ממנו ראוי זה ליפול מששת ימי בראשית שהרי לא נפל והכתוב קראו נופל אלא שמגלגלין זכות על ידי זכאי וחובה על ידי חייב</p>\n<p>The academy of R’ Yishmael taught: “For the one who falls will fall from it” - this one is fitting to fall since the six days of creation. For he has not fallen, yet the passuk calls him “the one who falls.” Except that good things comes by one who is innocent and bad things come by one who is guilty. [Therefore, build a fence so that it doesn’t come by your hands - Rashi to Devarim 22:8.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Notice that this Gemara was also taught by the academy of R’ Yishmael!)</p>\n<p>By the same logic that the one who would fall was destined to fall anyway, just don’t be the messenger by which it occurs, why can’t one say that this person was destined to be injured anyway, just one shouldn’t be the messenger? In other words: Even injuries caused by man are decrees of the king, and if one heals such a wound, it should be no different than if one heals an ordinary illness! Therefore, once we see that wounds caused by man aren’t an issue from ורפא alone, we don’t need an additional teaching that it’s permissible to heal ailments from Heaven, since it’s all the same thing anyway.</p>\n<h1>2. “It appears like he’s contradicting the decree of the king” isn’t a valid argument</h1>\n<p>Contrast further to Bava Basra 10a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא היה רבי מאיר אומר יש לו לבעל הדין להשיבך ולומר לך אם אלהיכם אוהב עניים הוא מפני מה אינו מפרנסן אמור לו כדי שניצול אנו בהן מדינה של גיהנם וזו שאלה שאל טורנוסרופוס הרשע את ר\"ע אם אלהיכם אוהב עניים הוא מפני מה אינו מפרנסם אמר לו  כדי שניצול אנו בהן מדינה של גיהנם</p>\n<p>It was taught in a Braisa: R’ Meir used to say: There is for an opponent to argue to you and say to you: “If Hashem your G-d loves the poor, why doesn’t He sustain them?” Say to him: “So that we may be saved through them from the judgement of Gehennom.” This is the question that the wicked Turnus Rufus asked R’ Akiva, “If Hashem your G-d loves the poor, why doesn’t He sustain them?” [R’ Akiva] said to [Turnus Rufus], “So that we may be saved through them from the judgement of Gehennom.”</p>\n<p>אמר לו [אדרבה] זו שמחייבתן לגיהנם אמשול לך משל למה הדבר דומה למלך בשר ודם שכעס על עבדו וחבשו בבית האסורין וצוה עליו שלא להאכילו ושלא להשקותו והלך אדם אחד והאכילו והשקהו כששמע המלך לא כועס עליו ואתם קרוין עבדים שנאמר (ויקרא כה, נה) כי לי בני ישראל עבדים</p>\n<p>[Turnus Rufus] said to [R’ Akiva], “To the contrary, that’s what <em>obligates</em> you to the judgement of Gehennom! Let me pose to you a parable. To what is this comparable? To a human king who became angry at his servant, imprisoned him, and commanded that nobody give him to eat or drink. A man went and gave him to eat and drink. When the king hears, should he not be angry at him? And you are called servants, as it says, ‘For to me are the Jews as servants’!”</p>\n<p>אמר לו ר\"ע אמשול לך משל למה הדבר דומה למלך בשר ודם שכעס על בנו וחבשו בבית האסורין וצוה עליו שלא להאכילו ושלא להשקותו והלך אדם אחד והאכילו והשקהו כששמע המלך לא דורון משגר לו ואנן קרוין בנים דכתיב (דברים יד, א) בנים אתם לה' אלהיכם</p>\n<p>R’ Akiva said to [Turnus Rufus], “Let me pose to you a parable. To what is this comparable? To a human king who became angry at his son, imprisoned him, and commanded that nobody give him to eat or drink. A man went and gave him to eat and drink. When the king hears, should he not send him gifts? And we are called sons, as it says, ‘You are sons to Hashem your G-d’!”</p>\n<p>אמר לו אתם קרוים בנים וקרוין עבדים בזמן שאתם עושין רצונו של מקום אתם קרוין בנים ובזמן שאין אתם עושין רצונו של מקום אתם קרוין עבדים ועכשיו אין אתם עושין רצונו של מקום אמר לו הרי הוא אומר (ישעיהו נח, ז) הלא פרוס לרעב לחמך ועניים מרודים תביא בית אימתי עניים מרודים תביא בית האידנא וקאמר הלא פרוס לרעב לחמך:</p>\n<p>[Turnus Rufus] said to [R’ Akiva], “You’re called sons and servants. When you do the will of Hashem, you are called sons. When you don’t do the will of Hashem, you’re called servants. And now you are not doing the will of Hashem!” [R’ Akiva] said to [Turnus Rufus], “Behold, it says, ‘Is it not to break bread for the hungry and bring the poor that are cast out into your house?’ When do we bring the poor that are cast out into the house? Now [that the Roman soldiers are occupying them]! And it says, ‘Is it not to break bread for the hungry?’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why should healing be any different than giving Tzedakah? The same way that Hashem gives poverty in order to provide merit for others on the poor’s behalf, so too, we should argue that Hashem gives ailments in order to provide merit for others on the sick’s behalf. The same way that we bring them in to help them monetarily, we should bring them in to help them medically. (Sanhedrin 73a provides precedent for such a comparison, deriving that one is obligated to save someone’s life <em>a fortiori</em> from the obligation to save someone’s property.)</p>\n<h1>TLDR</h1>\n<p>If Tosfos are not providing a valid line of logic, then, well, it’s not a valid line of logic. And if they <em>are</em> providing a valid line of logic, then why does it only apply to ailments by Heaven and not to wounds by man? As such, their original question - why are both terms “Heal, he will heal” necessary - returns. How can Tosfos be defended?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Regarding the first issue, I think a key point that has to be noted is the precise wording used by Tosafos, particularly at the end. When discussing ailments that are directly God-inflicted, Tosafos does not say you might think that healing them is contravening the decree of the king. Rather, Tosafos says that you might think that healing them <em>appears</em> like contravening the decree of the king. The word \"appears\" is of the utmost importance here, because it tells us that the entire issue might be about appearances rather than objective reality. Even if the objective reality is that man-inflicted wounds ultimately come from God just as much as God-inflicted ailments, it does not <em>appear</em> that way. If a fellow man wounds you it <em>appears</em> as if the injury came from the fellow man, whereas if you simply contract a disease it is much more obviously from God. Thus, healing a man-inflicted wound simply looks like you are undoing the damage caused by another human being, while healing a sickness directly <em>appears</em> to be contravening the decree of God. In point of fact, you are allowed to heal in both cases because it's <em>not</em> actually contravening the decree, but if not for the extra word in the verse we might have thought that the type of healing which <em>appears</em> to contravene the decree is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>As for the second issue, one could argue that there is not a real contradiction from the Talmudic passage about charity. This is because Tosafos agrees that giving charity does not contravene the decree of the king, just like healing diseases does not actually contravene the decree of the king. As mentioned above, Tosafos's only suggestion is that it would <em>appear</em> like healing diseases contravenes the decree of the king. Indeed, giving charity also <em>appears</em> to be contravening the decree of the king — that was precisely Turnus Rufus's argument to R. Akiva. Yet the Torah allows us (and even obligates us) to give charity despite the fact that it might <em>appear</em> to be contravening the decree of the king. Similarly, the Torah allows us to heal diseases even though it might <em>appear</em> to be contravening the decree of the king. </p>\n\n<p>(Note, though, that as I mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/92840/13438\">this answer</a>, R. Abraham Ibn Ezra seems to accept something similar to Tosafos's suggestion even <em>after</em> the additional word was used in the verse.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there a problem with buying a Christian a Christmas gift?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>To make the question easier, suppose that the recipient of the Christmas gift is a devout Christian who actually celebrates for religious reasons. </p>\n\n<p>Potentially there are several issues with buying a Christmas gift for such a person:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It is forbidden to benefit from anything related to idolatry, because of “Do not bring the abomination to your house” and “Let nothing from the Cherem cling to your hand.” (See Rambam, Avodah Zarah 7:2)</li>\n<li>One is prohibited to do business with idolaters near their festivals (AZ 2a). There are two reasons brought (ibid. 6a, as explained by Rashi): \n\n<ol>\n<li>The non-Jew will thank his gods (a violation on the Jew’s part of “the name of other gods...may not be heard on your account”)</li>\n<li>The non-Jew will use the object for his idolatrous service (a violation on the Jew’s part of Lifnei Iveir, causing another to sin)</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Christianity, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/134/\">according to some</a> is considered Shituf, serving Hashem along with an idol, and is only prohibited for Jews, not non-Jews. I’d imagine that the Lifnei Iveir issue would therefore not apply, and I would imagine that “the name of other gods...may not be heard on your account” <em>would</em> apply. </p>\n\n<p>Would there be an additional prohibition because of possession of idolatrous items? On the one hand, Christianity is idolatry for Jews, and so it might be prohibited. On the other hand, it’s not idolatry for its recipient, and since it’s intended for that Christian, perhaps it would be permitted.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Does the Midrash say we have guardian angels?",
    "content": "# Does the Midrash say we have guardian angels?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Midrash quotes Rabbi Hama on the story where Jacob wrestled an angel but, not just any ordinary angel, but the guardian of Esau. Needless to say, Maimonides, I think said it was a symbolic guardian in a dream or a vision, regarding this. Thus, it is unclear whether the Midrash understands the story literally or not.</p>\n\n<p>The question however is, do we have guardian angels according to the Midrash?</p>\n\n<p>PS, the Midrash in Genesis Rabbah 77:4 (fifth century C.E.), understands the story to be symbolical but does not forbid a literal reading.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Roughly speaking, it can at least be argued but we'd be dishonest if we equated it to the idea of a mainstream society \"guardian\" angel. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Outside of Judaism</strong>, you hear this idea that every person has a personal angel assigned to them who is invested in their outcome. The \"guardian angel\" of modern society <em>(roughly speaking)</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>In Judaism</strong>, angels are specific beings which serve a specific function. They aren't generalized but they each have a specific application in reality. In terms of personal angels, we actually do have a concept related to personal angels but the relationship isn't quite the same. Judaism teaches that there are both good angels and bad angels and that we actually create angels through our actions. Jews who perform mitzvot are actually creating good angels. Jews who transgress are creating evil angels. <strong><em><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/692875/jewish/What-Are-Angels.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This relates to a deeper spiritual concept which you can read more about here.</a></em></strong></p>\n\n<p>This concept regarding the creation of angels can actually be found in <strong>Pirkei Avot (The Ethics of Our Fathers) - Chapter 4:11</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2032/jewish/Chapter-Four.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eliezer the son of Yaakov would say: He who fulfills one\n  mitzvah, acquires for himself one angel-advocate; he who commits one\n  transgression, acquires against himself one angel-accuser. Repentance\n  and good deeds are as a shield against retribution.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea is that these angels are advocates for the positive contributions you've made to the world. They are quite literally the evidence of your good deeds and therefore exist on your behalf. The same can be said for evil angels in the opposite fashion. Their existence is a testament to your misdeeds and transgressions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So as I said originally, while it can be roughly argued that Judaism sort of has \"guardian angels\" they really don't function the same way. \"Personal angels\" is really the more appropriate way of framing the relationship and this relationship can be both positive and negative.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

The Greek version was <em>Iēsous</em> (the <em>-s</em> suffix was added because of Greek morphology, as in <em>Ioudas</em> from <em>Yehuda</em>). <em>Yeshu</em> seems to me to be a re-borrowing of the graecified <em>Iēsous</em> (maybe in order to mock the Greek pronunciation).</p>\n<p>The initials יש\"ו as standing for ימח שמו וזכרו is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym\" rel=\"noreferrer\">backronym</a>.

These stories are written as parodies rather than serious history: one even credits Peter the Apostle with the invention of the Latin alphabet (<em>a, b, c, d</em> אבי ציד \"my father was a hunter\" = Esau; <em>o, p, q, r, s</em> = אפיקורוס)!

So, much of my answer is based on what I have seen as well as what I Have done and still do.</p>\n\n<p>First, as DoubleAA hinted, there is no \"barrier\" to blessings. Anyone can bless anyone else. In some cases, blessings from a sage or rabbi are considered \"holier\" or \"more effective\", but the Friday night blessing of the children, I don't think, is in that category. If the father is there, he should do it, of course. But, there is no known prohibition for anyone to say this blessing.</p>\n\n<p>I have frequently been a guest at a rabbi's home or a friend's home. The host technically considers all his guests as his own family members and all guest children at the table are as his own children. So, he blessed me as well as all the other children there, along with his own children and his wife, of course. (The wife certainly deserves a HUGE Shabbat blessing, no?)</p>\n\n<p>When I have guest children in my home, I bless them as well as my own children.

    "content": "# Our I, Our Self leading us to separation and idolatry\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Looking at the words:\n\"Anochi HaShem Eloheichem -  אָנֹכִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ \" (Shemot 20:2 & 20:5, Devarim 5:6 & 5:9)\" I noticed that on the one hand HaShem emphasizes that we should serve Him while on the other hand using the exact same words HaShem emphasizes that one cannot serve others ( כִּי אָנֹכִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֵל קַנָּא). This reminded me of two great teachings:</p>\n<p>And G-d said to Moshe: “Hew for yourself (<em>Psal Lecha</em>) two tablets of stone\",  (Exodus 34:1). And \"Do not make for yourself a hewn image (<em>lecha pesel</em>)\", Exodus 20:4.</p>\n<p>I can't remember the source but I once heard that: the key to understand the difference if on where we place the word 'lecha (yourself)'. Because in the first occasion, in the order of the sentence, the carving comes first, and 'yourself' is secondary. While in the commandment against idolatry, on the other hand, 'yourself' comes first, and the carving is secondary. The difference is that in one occasion we make our ego secondary to our service. While in the second occasion we place our ego first and let us create our own image on how to live.</p>\n<p>Likewise there is this drash on Devarim 5:5 where the words: “I (Anochi) stand between HaShem and between you...” are taken to mean that our (<em>Anochiyus</em>) I-ness, ego, self-centeredness, is the screen that separates between human and the Divine. It is 'anochi' – egotism – that separates us from G-d.</p>\n<p><em>So first of all I'm looking for the sources of these ideas, secondly I would like to know if there are any good commentaries which dig more into these ideas (and specifically connect these concepts with idolatry)?</em></p>\n<p>So are there any commentaries which link our ego/I-ness/self-awereness/self-centeredness with idolatry?</p>\n<p>P.s. I also noticed both in the Aseret HaDevarim as in Vayikra 19:4 the prohibition regards idols is not to make them for 'ourself' (i.e. yourself and yourselves). Why did the Torah stresses it that way? Why not only state don't make... why the addition of the words 'for yourself'? Is there a deeper meaning/understanding in these words?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Chabad beginner visiting a Modern Orthodox shul\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have been practicing my observance with a super-friendly Chabad congregation but my area, predominantly secular and Modern Orthodox, has a bunch of MO congregations that I'm very curious to visit, perhaps to taste the difference. As someone with a Chabad background, albeit a beginner, what are some things I should expect to be different?</p>\n\n<p>(Also, I am going to bring a Koren Sacks siddur there instead of the Tehillat Hashem one, good idea?)</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I'm curious about all aspects of difference, not just the nusach.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>You won't find too many differences other than some changes in the Nusach and the siddur. </p>\n\n<p>Most MO shuls tend to be Nusach Ashkenaz from what I've seen, but you should inquire. That's not a given rule. I don't recommend bringing a siddur with you unless you are personally comfortable with the Koren siddur and can't readily transfer to another one. My reasoning:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The shul has its own siddurim usually in ample supply, so there's no need to bring your own</li>\n<li>If the shul is not in an eruv on Shabbat, then you definitely should not bring your own siddur</li>\n<li>You may get confused with finding the proper page that the cong. is on if you use a different siddur than the rest of them do</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The tunes the cong. sing may or may not be familiar to what you’re used to. It depends where you go. Some do more congregational singing than others.</p>\n\n<p>MO shuls tend to start much earlier than Chab\"d shuls on Shabbat. In the U.S., that time can range from 8 - 9 AM in most places. But, it's most likely not starting at 10AM as many Chaba\"d shuls do.</p>\n\n<p>If you're a guest, you may or may not find the \"open friendliness\" that I've found Chaba\"d tends to offer. Some MO shuls have people that will spot you as a guest immediately and you may get numerous lunch offers. Others, have no clue that you came in or cared either way. Pick a \"small\" place, if you can. It will be a less intimidating start.</p>\n\n<p>I will say that MO shuls have changed significantly since the 70s. In U.S., it seems that philosophy and demographics have trended towards being halachically stricter. Many men in MO shuls wear black hats, now whereas that wasn't as much the trend until about 20 years ago. I've seen a bit of a trend towards separate men / women seating at meals and even at lectures. My point is that there's no set \"standard\" - at least less so now than there was 30 - 40 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>(If you're somewhat curious about the MO trend, Rabbi Riskin's Lincoln Square shul in NYC was considered MO when he was there. I don't know if it would still be considered that way, now. Even so, I understand that it has attracted more of a \"yeshivish\" crowd.)</p>\n\n<p>In short, I recommend contacting the shul's rabbi and asking some basic questions and introducing yourself. It will provide you with answers and it helps if the rabbi, at least, knows that you will be a guest there. It also makes it easier for you vs. entering \"blindly\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Things you’ll find in the <em>shuls</em> you would like to visit (unlike Chabad):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Congregants don’t wear a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gartel</a> (waistbands)</li>\n<li>The pronunciation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holam\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cholam</a> (Chabad substitutes it with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzere\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tzere</a>)</li>\n<li>Typically only say the prescribed Kaddeshim (Kaddish) in their respective siddur (Chabad customarily will add pieces of liturgy or other things to say additional Kaddish)</li>\n<li>Even unmarried <em>chazzan</em> for Shacharit will don a <em>tallit</em></li>\n<li>Even an unmarried <em>ba’al koreh</em> (Torah reader) will don a tallit</li>\n<li>The <em>chazzan</em> will ordinarily don a <em>tallit</em> for afternoon and evening services</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Hagbah_and_Gelila\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Haggbah</a> is done differently than at Chabad.

    "content": "# Do the Rabbanim know more than King Solomon about the reality of post-death?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I believe it's accepted in the mainstream that Kohelet is authored by King Solomon in his wisdom. </p>\n\n<p>In it, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>19</em>- For there is a happening for the children of men, and there is a happening for the beasts-and they have one happening-like the death of this one is the death of that one, and all have one spirit, and the superiority of man over beast is nought, for all is vanity.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>20</em>- All go to one place; all came from the dust, and all return to the dust.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>21</em>- <strong>Who knows that the spirit of the children of men is that which ascends on high and the spirit of the beast is that which descends below to the earth?</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><em>22</em>- And I saw that there is nothing better than that man rejoice in his deeds, for that is his portion, for who will bring him to see what will be after him?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>-Kohelet / Ecclesiastes 3:19-22</p>\n\n<p>So there's this ambiguity present here, and really all across the Tanakh with regards to the conditions of the afterlife. Though here it's more directly addressed as being unknown.</p>\n\n<p>However, our Rabbanim speak about Olam Haba and Gehhinom with a certainty and at times list particular actions that can land an individual in one or the other. This seems to contradict the statement made above in Kohelet.</p>\n\n<p>Why do the Rabbanim know and not King Solomon? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>The punctuation of words makes sense.</strong></p>\n\n<p>To understand the answer, one need to know the rules of <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%22%D7%90_%D7%94%D7%99%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">definite article in hebrew</a>. In hebrew it is a letter \"hey\" adjointed at the begining of a word. In hebrew, there is an other case in which a letter \"hey\" is adjointed at the begining of a word, a hey that express a question, or demonstrate astonishment. It's generally called <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%22%D7%90_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Hey of questioning\"</a>, one can see in the link that the rules of the \"hey of questioning\" and \"hey of knowledge\" are different. Following both rules, it's obvious that the verse doesn't ask if human spirit ascend or not. The sentence of Kohelet es however a question, but a question is \"who knows\", because to understand the nature of human spirit needs a great wisdom. The question is rethoric, as to say, nobody understands. </p>\n\n<p>I quoted below a sample of Jewish authorized commentator who are as major grammarians, regarding our verse.</p>\n\n<p>הָעולה היא למעלה. has a kamats on the letter Hei, there is not a \nquestion about the ascent of human soul. See the machberet of Menachem who report that this verse is surprising (¹), and see Ibn Ezra(²) on the verse.

    "content": "# Incorporeal Resurrection\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was under the impression that, in contrast to Maimonides' distinction between <em>techiyath hameithim</em> (resurrection of the dead) and <em>olam haba</em> (the world to come), those Medieval/Renaissance period scholars more closely associated with kabbalistic leanings, such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharal MiPrague</a>, do not distinguish between the two concepts.  I was therefore somewhat surprised to come across the following quote in the Maharal's <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Netivot_Olam%2C_Netiv_Hashalom.2.5?vhe=OYW&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Nethiv HaShalom</em> Chapter 2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הזריז צריך שיהיה גובר על גופו, כי גופו יש בו העצלות מאוד, וכאשר גובר על גופו בזריזות, שדבר זה סלוק הגוף, <strong>לכך ראוי לו עוה\"ב ששם סלוק הגוף לגמרי</strong></p>\n<p>...therefore he is worthy of the world to come for there is the removal [or absence] of the [physical] body entirely</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was curious if anyone has any sources relevant to interpreting this passage, such as regarding whether or not the Maharal does indeed agree with Maimonides' distinction.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I don’t believe the Maharal is necessarily stating that one does not have a guf/body in olam habah. I believe he is stating that his body is elevated and removed to the greatest extent from all its physical properties such as sloth.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this interpretation is evident in that very sentence. For in discussing the effects of zerizus even in this world, the Maharal states that it brings about siluk haguf, removal from the body. I don’t believe he means that there is any real measurable change in a corporeal sense, rather he means that it creates some sort of spiritual elevation. And thus he continues that it’s fitting to cause further removal in olam habah. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Hattip @wfb who dug up <a href=\"http://www.aspaklaria.info/070_AYIN/%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%9D%20%D7%94%D7%91%D7%90.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this site</a>, which presents (amongst many other relevant source texts) other relevant passages of the Maharal, that do together certainly sound like they are describing an incorporeal \"resurrection\" more in line with the Maimonidean <em>olam haba</em> alone.  For example, indicating that <em>chayei olam haba</em> are incorporeal, we have:</p>\n<p><strong>Gevuroth Hashem 42</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל לעולם הבא שלא יהיה האדם חמרי וגשמי כמו שהוא בעולם הזה, רק יהיה האדם\nבמדריגת המלאכים המסולקים מן הגשמות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...However, in the world to come that man shall not be corporeal and physical as he is in this world, rather man shall be at the level of the angels who are removed from physicality...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tifereth Yisrael 15</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאין עולם הבא רק קנין העולם הנבדל מן הגשמי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...For the world to come is only the acquisition of the realm separated from the physical...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Chidushei Aggadoth Sanhedrin 110b</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עולם הבא הוא עולם השכל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...The world to come is the world of the intellect...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, implying that <em>techiyath hameithim</em> is identical to <em>chayei olam haba</em>, we have, for example:</p>\n<p><strong>Tifereth Yisrael 15</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כאשר יאמר שאין תחיית המתים מן התורה, הרי זה מתנגד לעולם הבא מצד המקבל, כי אין עצם עולם הבא רק העולם שיבא אחר התחיה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...when one says that there is no resurrection of the dead from the Torah, he is in opposition to the world to come from the receiving end, for the essence of the world to come is only the realm that comes after the resurrection...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי העולם הבא שיחזור האדם ויקבל החיות מן השי\"ת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...For the world to come [is] that man shall return and receive life from THE NAME, may He be blessed...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Derech Chayim 4:16</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ופירוש עולם הבא הוא העולם שיהיה אחר התחיה לא זולת זה, ולא יהא לך בדבר זה שום ספק וערעור... הרי כי שכר המצות הוא לאחר התחיה, ואין ספק כי העולם הבא הוא העולם ששם יהיה שכר מצות. ודבר זה נקרא עולם הבא, וזהו לאחר התחיה...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...and the explanation of the world to come is the realm that will be after the resurrection, nothing else. And you should have no uncertainty or qualm about this matter... for indeed the reward for the commandments is after the resurrection, and there is no doubt that the world to come is the realm that there will be the reward for the commandments.  And this thing is called the world to come, and this is after the resurrection...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Gemara (Shabbos 12b) relates about R' Yishmael ben Elisha who inadvertently desecrated Shabbas, and wrote a record of his sin to bring a <em>chatas</em> upon the rebuilding of the Temple.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קרא והטה, וכתב על פנקסו, אני ישמעאל בן אלישע קריתי והטיתי נר בשבת\n<strong>לכשיבנה בית המקדש אביא חטאת שמנה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara specifically discusses the Messianic age, and according to most interpretations, it is implied that sacrifices will be relevant then (Zevachim 45b).</p>\n<p>When the Gemara posed a halachic question about an intricacy in the laws of <em>pigul</em>, the Gemara responded with 'הילכתא למשיחא' - are you asking questions about something only relevant with the coming of Mashiach?</p>\n<p>There are numerous explanations to this passage in the Gemara - primarily Rashi, who explains that although these laws <em>will</em> be relevant with the coming of Mashiach, the Gemara still doesn't discuss these laws.</p>\n<p>Tosfos cites R' Chaim who explains that the Gemara refers specifically to laws with circumstances based on sin.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והר\"ר חיים מפרש דלא פריך הלכתא למשיחא אלא היכא דאיכא תרתי שהוא למשיחא וגם עושה איסור דליכא נפקותא בהלכתא אלא על ידי איסור לא שייך לפסוק למשיחא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosfos Yeshanim (Yuma 13a) and Ritva add an explanation to this qualification.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דלא פריך תלמודא הלכתא למשיחא אלא בדבר שיש בידו עבירה ולא תנהוג לימות המשיח כדכתיב ועמך כולם צדיקים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this interpretation, the Gemara has no reason to codify laws based on sin in the Messianic age, for there will be no sin. However, the general laws of <em>korbanot</em> will be relevant.</p>\n<p>This is explicit in the Rambam (Melachim 11:1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המלך המשיח עתיד לעמוד ולהחזיר מלכות דוד ליושנה לממשלה הראשונה ובונה\nהמקדש ומקבץ נדחי ישראל וחוזרין כל המשפטים בימיו <strong>כשהיו מקודם מקריבין</strong>\n<strong>קרבנות</strong> ועושין שמטין ויובלות ככל מצותה האמורה בתורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes, and there's no contradiction:</p>\n\n<p>All the <em>relevant</em> [for the WTC] sacrifices will be reinstated, as in the WTC there will be no sinning, no sacrifices resulting in sinning will be brought (like Asham).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In light of my <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/136322/17563\">previous answer</a>, sacrifices will certainly be relevant in the Messianic age. How to reconcile this with the Midrash quoted in the question?</p>\n<p>Avudraham (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Abudarham%2C_Second_Gate%3B_Prayer.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaar Sheni, Tikun Tefilla</a>) understands this Midrash to be referring to <em>karbanos</em> which are brought due to sin. Although the <em>korban chatas</em> and <em>asham</em> will still be relevant for sins committed prior to this era, at that point sin will be obliterated and there will be no new obligations to bring sin offerings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ופירש החכם ר' דוד קמחי שרצה לומר באמרו כי התפלות בטלות שלא יצטרכו\nלשאול צרכי העולם הזה כי בטובה גדולה יהיו כל הימים. ואין להם אלא שבח\nוהודאה לשם ית' וכן לא יהיו חוטאים לעתיד לבא ואז לא יצטרכו לקרבן חטאת\nואשם כי אם קרבן תודה שאינו בא על חטאת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Accordingly, the generalization 'כל הקרבנות' must be referring to personal sacrifices - the <em>tamid</em> and <em>mussaf</em> and other communal sacrifices will still be relevant. [Essentially similar to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/99024/17563\">this answer</a> from @AlBerko, although I don't think the 'כל' refers to 'relevant' sacrifices as he suggests, and the 'חוץ' doesn't quite work either.]</p>\n<p>Alternatively, as mentioned in numerous comments [@Shmu, @YaacovDeane], the period of לעתיד לבא is not necessarily referring to the Messianic Age. See, for example, Sanhedrin 99a which differentiates between the two times. [See <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%93%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99%D7%AA:%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97#.D7.91.D7.99.D7.97.D7.A1_.D7.9C.D7.96.D7.9E.D7.A0.D7.99.D7.9D_.D7.A2.D7.AA.D7.99.D7.93.D7.99.D7.99.D7.9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here] </a></p>\n\n\n",

You can recognize a food as certified kosher it if contains one of the symbols shown on <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/agency_list.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this list</a> of certifications approved by the Chicago Rabbinical Council (a well-known and widely-accepted kosher authority).</p>\n\n<p>Some of the more common symbols that you'll see on a product that signify that it is kosher are the Orthodox Union's symbol: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZlybT.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZlybT.jpg\" alt=\"Orthodox Union symbol\"></a></p>\n\n<p>and OK Kosher's symbol:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XAkCk.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XAkCk.jpg\" alt=\"OK Kosher symbol\"></a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For bread specifically, there are certain additional stringencies that some Jews observe (i.e. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/91527/1713\">pas Yisrael</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/49070/1713\">yoshon</a>).

Many people are taking a variety of vitamins, nutrients, and herbs in the same way they would take a prescription from a doctor. </p>\n\n<p>The problem with supplements is they sort of blur the line between medicine and food as they can sometimes be a little bit of both. Obviously, medicine gets held to a different standard due to the importance of personal health. <strong><em>A Jew doesn't need a hechsher for heart medication.</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>Supplements though, they're a different thing entirely. While there are some supplements which can genuinely benefit your health and even treat certain diseases, they're only \"kind of\" medicine. Many are food stuffs or derivatives of food stuffs. That leaves open the question of <strong>\" when and where does a Rabbi involve themselves in overseeing supplements?\"</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>B12 is a nutrient that your doctor will actually give you a shot for. It's used medically. </p></li>\n<li><p>Vitamin D is used in a similar way with prescriptions being given.</p></li>\n<li><p>Turmeric is an herb used in cooking but is also used as an anti-inflammatory supplement for various conditions <strong><em>(Depression, Arthritis, Dementia, etc.)</em></strong></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is there a Rabbinically verified method of determining which supplements fall under a medicinal category and which fall under a food category <strong><em>(and thus would need Rabbinical oversight)</em></strong> or is the issue one where there exists a lack of a uniform definition?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Halakha does not distinguish between \"medicine\" and \"supplements\" with respect to the laws of kashrus. There is a prohibition on eating non-kosher food, but certain considerations cause that prohibition to be overridden. It seems to me that kosher options are always preferable to non-kosher options when all else is equal. However, there are three halakhically-recognized types of illness, which will affect whether non-kosher medicine or supplements may be taken:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Life-threatening illness</li>\n<li>Non-life-threatening illness</li>\n<li>Discomfort</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Life-threatening illness (חולה שיש בו סכנה)</h1>\n\n<p>For a life-threatening illness, one can trivially take non-kosher medicine when kosher medicine is not available since this is a case of <em>pikuach nefesh</em>. Seemingly this would also apply to a medication recommended by a doctor to <em>prevent</em> a life-threatening illness that one is susceptible to. (An obscure exception may be medicine derived from an idol.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Non life-threatening illness (חולה שאין בו סכנה)</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/medicine/452/a-kashrus-guide-to-medications-vitamins-and-nutritional-supplements/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Star-K</a> defines this category as someone with a fairly significant amount of discomfort, but who is not in life-threatening danger. Their examples are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>One who is experiencing symptoms of the flu.</li>\n  <li>One who suffers from chronic debilitating arthritis pain.</li>\n  <li>One who suffers from migraine headaches or mild depression.</li>\n  <li>A pregnant woman suffering from non-life threatening complications (e.g. lower back pain).</li>\n  <li>A woman who has given birth in the past thirty days without any known problems or who is experiencing non-life threatening postpartum complications. This may apply for an extended period of time.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In such a case, the Shulchan Arukh (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.155.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 155:3</a>) rules that non-kosher medicine may be taken if consumed in an unusal way (i.e. not the way we normally eat things, for example by swallowing a pill whole). There are a couple of exceptions to this cited in the Shulchan Arukh which are not permitted in this case even if eaten in an unusual way, but none of them are likely to appear in medicine that you would get in the drug store.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Discomfort (מיחוש)</h1>\n\n<p>The Star-K (in the article linked above) rules that in the case of discomfort (e.g. slight joint pain, runny nose, mild headache, etc.) or for a healthy person consuming supplements, one should make every effort to choose kosher-certified medicines or medicines with all kosher ingredients, even if consumed in an unusual manner. When no kosher option is available, a rabbi should be consulted as it may still be permissible when not eaten in a normal manner.</p>\n\n<p>Still, we live in a time when the strict kosher consumer has many available options, and this is no different when talking about medicine (perhaps this is why the Star-K rules as they do). <a href=\"https://www.koshervitamins.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.koshervitamins.com/</a> has a huge array of kosher-certified vitamins, medications, and supplements. Also, while many over-the-counter medications are not marked with a kashrus certification symbol, the Chicago Rabbinical Council maintains <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/OTCMedicineReport.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a list</a> of over-the-counter medications and their kosher status (some are listed as acceptable even without a kosher symbol).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As you mentioned, the difference is simple: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Medicine is what you <em>have to use</em></strong> to prolong your life on a short span (immediate), what's obligatory to use not to transgress Venishmartem (see last chapters of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Murderer_and_the_Preservation_of_Life.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam's הלכות רוצח ושמירת הנפש</a>). This Mitzvah takes precedence over [many] considerations of Kashrus (always consult your Rabbi). This falls under \"Sur Merah\" category - prevent oneself from sinning.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Supplement is what you <em>might use optionally</em></strong> to prolong your life on the long span, it is not obligatory and it does not override any Kashrus requirements. This falls under \"Aseh Tov\" - do good.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

The company perhaps broadcast this to all the monitors in each conference room, not realizing that we were there. Part of the presentation showed the inside of churches with figures of Jesus and crosses, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Should the <em>Shat\"z</em> have stopped the Amidah in the middle? Moved to another room to continue? faced a different direction? Or would have he been allowed to continue?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Maybe this would be similar to a case in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x461\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 90:27</a>, where a child urinates in shul while a person is davening. Several options are given: stop and wait (in that case, until water is brought to pour over the urine and nullify it), walk four amos forward or to the side, or go out of the shul. (Rama there adds that it's best not to use the first option, because if it takes too long, you would have to start Shemoneh Esrei over.)</p>\n\n<p>In general, of course, you're not supposed to move from your place during Shemoneh Esrei, but this kind of situation is an exception (see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x469\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 104:2</a>).</p>\n\n<p>(As a practical matter, if the switch to turn off the monitor is easily accessible, then of course logically that would be the best solution.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The issue of praying in a place with AZ stems from Moshe who exited Egypt, which was full of AZ, in order to pray (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.9.29?with=all&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ex. 9:29</a>, cf. Rashi quoting Mekhilta). Yet in this case, there is no physical AZ in the room [and not all agree that Christianity is bonafide AZ, specially to-day (contrary to Rambam’s opinion, commentary to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_on_Mishnah_Avodah_Zarah.1.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">m. AZ 1:4</a> [“הנוצרית” should be inserted after “האומה” as in Qafih ed.], others did not maintain that any and all modes of Christianity is halachically considered AZ for a non-Jew)]. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless it can appear that one is bowing to the said images and therefore may be compared to bowing behind one’s rabbi or in front of a mirror. Yet, the basis for this is in a <em>gem</em>. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.27b.1?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ber. 27b</a>) which is not unanimously agreed to as <em>peshat</em> of the <em>gemara</em> (cf. Rashi, Rambam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Torah_Study.5.6?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TT 5:6</a>, Kesef Mishnah and Bet Yosef YD §242, not like Tos. and others; see also Meiri for other explanations). Likewise, the mirror issue is the stringent opinion of Radbaz (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_HaRadbaz_Volume_4.1178.1?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§1178</a>) and not Chazal or nec. other medieval poskim. This is important bec. on the other hand interrupting prayer (specifically berachot) is an issue of <em>hefsek</em> (cf. SA §104). Also, Rashba famously decided (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1376&pgnum=89\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">resp. 1:177</a>) that where a gentile holding an AZ enters into a Jewish person’s space the latter is not required to remove the AZ which does not belong to him and he did not admit. </p>\n\n<p>And so, IMHO, in such a (hypothetical?) question where there is a non-physical image (monitor) displaying something which is not necessarily considered AZ (cross, religious images) in a room where somebody had begun praying prior to the display, one would be permitted to continue the ’<em>amidah</em>. If, however, it distracts his concentration he may motion to somebody to handle the monitor (cf. poskim on SA <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.104?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">104:1-2</a>). Then, if for whatever reason it can’t be covered or turned off he may turn away or exit the room (cf. MB <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.104.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid</a>. and others). </p>\n\n<p>(If too “<em>khop plop</em>” and concise feel free to delete; started as a comment but exceeded the space.)</p>\n\n\n",

How does that work?</p>\n\n<p>A hint based on something I tried a while ago. I had to recommend a siddur for a Rosh Hashanna congregation that I was officiating, about 15 years ago. I wanted the congregation to use something that had fairly simple / \"modern\" English. (I don't care for the Siddurim that use unnecessary \"poetry\" and arcane terms like \"thee\" / \"doeth\". etc.) I narrowed the choices down to Phillips, Adler and Birnbaum. I chose Birnbaum because one of the factors I discovered is that it tended to be the closest accurate Hebrew translation. (There were other factors in that decision, incidentally, which I don't want to elaborate on.) One way I tested this was to look up some words and terms in a Hebrew / English dictionary as well as ask an Israeli. My Hebrew is fairly good, so I could vouch for much of it, myself, but, I wanted a second and third \"impartial\" opinion.</p>\n\n<p>There are loads of English / Hebrew siddurim around now, so the choices are a bit more challenging now than about 20 years ago. I can't tell you which siddur / Tehillim translation is accurate or the <strong>most</strong> accurate. But, perhaps, a test is to ask a knowledgeable Hebrew speaker or try a good dictionary and see how closely that translation matches your siddur.</p>\n\n<p>I do caution you to bear in mind that much of what you see in the Siddur is metaphoric and poetic. So, don't <strong>always</strong> accept an exact literal translation for everything.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The consensus is that public prayer can be in any language, but private prayer must be in Hebrew.  Below is a compendium of what various commentators said:</p>\n\n<p>Mishnah Sotah 7:1\nThese are said in any language: The portion of the Sotah, the confession over tithes, the reading of the Shema, tefillah [Amida], the grace after meals, the oath relating to testimony and the oath relating to a bailiment.\nAnd these are said in the holy language [Hebrew]: The reading over first-fruits, the release from levirate marriage, the blessings and curses [recited by Israel upon entering the land], the priestly blessing, the blessing of the high priest, the portion of the king, the portion of the broken heifer, and the speech of the priest anointed for battle to the people.</p>\n\n<p>Talmud Yerushalmi Sotah 7:1, 21b\nThe reading of the Shema [can be done in any language]. Because it is written: “And you shall speak them.” Rabi says: “I say that the Shema can only be read in Hebrew.” Why? “And these words [that I command you today shall be in your mind].\nR. Levi bar Ḥaita went to Caesarea. He heard voices reading the Shema in Greek. He wanted to stop them. R. Yose heard this and got angry. He said: “Here is what I am saying, should a person who doesn’t know Hebrew not say the Shema at all? No, one’s obligation is fulfilled in whatever language one knows… Prayer [can be said in any language]. So that a person will know how to ask for his/her needs. The Grace after Meals [can be said in any language]. So that one will know whom\none is blessing.</p>\n\n<p>Talmud Bavli Sotah 33a\nTefillah. It is a request for mercy; one prays however one needs to. And can tefillah indeed be in any language? Did not R. Yehudah say: One should never ask for one’s needs in Aramaic, for R. Yoḥanan said: Anyone who asks for his needs in Aramaic is not attended to by the ministering angels, because the ministering angels do not understand Aramaic! There is no contradiction [between the Mishnah and R. Yehudah’s statement]; [R. Yehudah’s ruling applies in] private, [the Mishnah’s applies in] public</p>\n\n<p>Rif Berakhot 7a\nThat which it says, “tefillah may be recited in any language,” only applies in public, but in private, it is not applicable, for R. Yehudah said in the name of Rav: One should never ask for one’s needs in Aramaic, and R. Yoḥanan said: Anyone who asks for his needs in Aramaic is not attended to by the ministering angels, because the ministering angels do not understand Aramaic.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Yonah on the Rif vs Gemara\nSince we have concluded that private tefillah can only be said in Hebrew, I am deeply puzzled by the universal custom of women to pray in other language, since by virtue of their obligation in prayer, they should have to pray in Hebrew [like everyone else]. The rabbis of France try to justify this practice by saying that when an individual prays the same tefillah that is recited in public, [that private prayer] is considered “public”, and one can say it in another language. And that which R. Yehudah said, “One should never ask for one’s needs in Aramaic, applies when one asks for one’s private needs, such as praying for a sick person or regarding any other problem in one’s home, but tefillah, which is known by the whole community, even when one prays it in one’s own home, it is as if it is being prayed in public, and if one does not know Hebrew, one may fulfill one’s obligation in\nany language. And the reason that public requests are made in any language but private needs are not is because the community [when praying as a whole] does not need an intermediary with God, but an individual does…and the ministering angels only attend to [requests made in] Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>Rosh Berakhot 2:2\nIt seems to me that [the practice cited by R. Yonah] poses no difficulty, because it was specifically in [Aramaic] that R. Yehudah forbade making requests.</p>\n\n<p>Shulḥan Arukh Orah Ḥayyim  101:4\n1. One may recite tefillah in any language one chooses. This, however, is true only in public, but in private, one may only recite tefillah in Hebrew. (Rif)\n2. Some say that [the ban on other languages] applies only to asking for one’s [personal] needs, such as praying for a sick person or regarding any other problem in one’s home, but the fixed tefillah recited in public may even be recited privately in any language. (Rabbis of France)\n3. Some say that even an individual making private requests may do so in any language he chooses, except for Aramaic. (A lenient reading of Rosh)</p>\n\n<p>Sefer Ḥasidim 588, R. Yehudah HeḤasid et al, Germany, 12th- 13th c.\nIf you come across a man who does not understand Hebrew, and he is God-fearing and wshes to have proper intent, or a woman, tell them that they should learn the prayers in the language they understand, because prayer is only effective with an understanding mind, and if the mind does not understand, what possible effect could the words have when they come out of one’s mouth? Therefore, it is better to pray in the language that one understands.</p>\n\n<p>Synopsis of Ḥatam Sofer 6:84, R. Moshe Sofer, Hungary, 19th c.\nRuling: The permission to pray in a language other than Hebrew only applies on an ad hoc basis; one may not permanently have prayers in other languages. Reasons Given:\nThe Men of the Great Assembly fixed the prayers in Hebrew, even though many people at the time did not speak Hebrew. \nPrayer was meant, in part, to address the absence of the Temple, and the Men of the Great Assembly chose the Hebrew words carefully in order to achieve these goals.\nHebrew captures nuances and allusions that other languages do not.\nIf the concern is that people do not understand, it is best to leave the prayers in Hebrew and to educate people, rather than to change the language of prayer.\nHebrew is God’s language, used to address the prophets and to create the world. Anyone who deviates from established custom has the burden of proof.</p>\n\n\n",

This is a decree, enacted lest a purchaser pay for an article and before he takes possession of it, it be destroyed by factors beyond his control - e.g., a fire breaks out and burns it, or thieves come and take it. If the article is considered as in the possession of the purchaser, the seller may hesitate and not endeavor to save it.</p>\n  \n  <p>For this reason, our Sages ordained that the article remain within the possession of the seller, so that he will attempt to save it.

It’s a dispute to begin with whether the particular form of death needs to be specified in the warning:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא ושאר חייבי מיתות שבתורה אין ממיתין אותן אלא בעדה ועדים והתראה ועד שיודיעוהו שהוא חייב מיתת ב\"ד רבי יהודה אומר עד שיודיעוהו באיזה מיתה הוא נהרג</p>\n  \n  <p>We taught in a Braisa: For all others that make liable to death from the Torah, we don’t kill them except with a court, witnesses, warning, and until they warn him that he’s liable to death. R’ Yehudah says: until they tell him with which death he will be killed. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara continues, explaining the Mekoshesh:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ק יליף ממקושש ורבי יהודה אומר מקושש הוראת שעה היתה:</p>\n  \n  <p>The Tanna Kamma learns this from the Mekoshesh, and R’ Yehudah says, the Mekoshesh was a <em>hora’as sha’ah.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the Tanna Kamma, just as the Mekoshesh was warned that he’d be put to death but not which one, so, too, all warnings for the death penalty. According to R’ Yehudah, that case was uniquely instructed by Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>Now, they <em>did</em> know that one who violates Shabbos is liable to death; the only question was which one. To quote the Gemara ibid. 78b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא יודע היה משה רבינו שהמקושש במיתה שנאמר (שמות לא, יד) מחלליה מות יומת אלא לא היה יודע באיזו מיתה נהרג שנאמר (במדבר טו, לד) כי לא פורש </p>\n  \n  <p>It was taught in a Braisa: Moshe knew that the Mekoshesh was to be put to death, as it says, “One who violates [Shabbos] will be put to death,” but he didn’t know with which death he should be killed, as it says, “It was not explained.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rashi and Rav Hirsch explain that Hashem had already commanded that he was subject to the death penalty, but they did not yet know the precise manner of the punishment.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9943#v=34&showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shlach Lecha 15:34</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They put him under guard, since it was not specified what was to be\n  done to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>since it was not specified what was to be done to him:</strong> With which method he\n  should be executed. But they did know that one who\n  desecrates the Sabbath is put to death. — [Sifrei Shelach 57]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But here: כי לא פרש מה יעשה לו, that it was a capital crime punishable\n  by death was in no doubt, מחלליה מות יומת (Exodus XXXI,14) had already\n  been proclaimed, the only doubt was מה יעשה לו, which form of death\n  was to be administered. יודע היה משה רבינו שהמקושש במיתה שנאמר מחלליה\n  םות יומת אלא לא היה יודע באיזה מיתה נהרג (Sanhedrin 78b).\n  Nevertheless, the התראה was legally sufficient, for all that is\n  required is שהתרו בו סתם that he is told that what he does is a\n  capital crime (Ibid 80b). But in the opinion of רב יהודה any התראה is\n  incomplete if the actual form of the death to which he is liable is\n  not specified to the criminal, then the killing of the מקושש was a\n  special case, an הוראת שעה dictated directly by Hashem and cannot be\n  used as an example for the general practice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9943#v=35&showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shlach Lecha 15:35</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הוַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־משֶׁ֔ה מ֥וֹת יוּמַ֖ת הָאִ֑ישׁ רָג֨וֹם אֹת֤וֹ\n  בָֽאֲבָנִים֙ כָּל־הָ֣עֵדָ֔ה מִח֖וּץ לַמַּֽחֲנֶֽה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

According to the Tanna Kamma, that’s enough, and according to R’ Yehudah, it was a unique case. </p>\n\n<p>But what about the Mekalel? In <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0324.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 24:10</a>ff we’re introduced to a man who blasphemed against Hashem. Similar to the woodchopper, he was thrown in prison, as the punishment wasn’t known. Also similar to the woodchopper, Sanhedrin 78b poses two explanations of the incident. </p>\n\n<p>In context, the Gemara is analyzing a dispute between R’ Nechemiah and the Rabbanan regarding the Halacha that if Reuven attacks Shimon, we imprison Reuven and wait to see if Shimon recovers or not. Both agree to this Halacha, but because of technicalities beyond the scope of this question, they are forced to derive it from different sources. Further, we need a source for each where even if we don’t know whether he would be liable to the death penalty, we would still imprison him.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ורבי נחמיה יליף ממגדף דלא הוה ידע אי בר קטלא הוא וחבשוהו ורבנן מגדף הוראת שעה היתה כדתניא יודע היה משה רבינו שהמקושש במיתה שנאמר (שמות לא, יד) מחלליה מות יומת אלא לא היה יודע באיזו מיתה נהרג שנאמר (במדבר טו, לד) כי לא פורש וגו' אבל מגדף לא נאמר בו אלא לפרש להם על פי ה' שלא היה משה יודע אם הוא בן מיתה כל עיקר אם לאו</p>\n  \n  <p>And [from where does] R’ Nechemiah [learn this]? He derives it from the blasphemer, for [Moshe] did not know if he was liable to death or not. And [why do] the Rabbanan [not learn from the blasphemer]? It was a <em>hora’as sha’ah</em>. As we taught in a Braisa: [First half deals with the woodchopper.] But by the blasphemer, it doesn’t say [“For it was not explained,” as it does by the woodchopper,] but rather “to explain to them by the word of Hashem,” for Moshe did not know if he was liable to death at all or not. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand according to the Rabbanan, this was a unique case, similar to R’ Yehudah’s understanding of the woodchopper. But according to R’ Nechemiah, how could he be killed? Whether he holds like the Tanna Kamma or R’ Yehudah, nobody knew what the appropriate punishment was, so how could proper warning be administered?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=4230#p=540&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chasam Sofer Kovetz Teshuvos 85</a> says that even though they did not know whether the <em>Mekalel</em> (blasphemer) was <em>Chayav Misa</em>(liable to death) or not, they still warned him that transgressing could lead to death by <em>Sekila</em>-stoning (which is the most severe death according to <em>Rabanan</em>). Going like the opinion Sanhedrin 80b מותרה לדבר חמור הוי מותרה לדבר קל (one who is warned a a more severe punishment [death by stoning] can still receive a lesser punishment [lashes/beheading/burning/strangulation]), they could subsequently have given the <em>Mekallel</em> a lesser punishment e.g <em>chenek</em> or <em>Malkus</em> as they warned him of the most severe consequence if he sinned.</p>\n\n\n",

It seems from the verses that Avraham and Sarah understood that if Pharaoh thought Sarah was unmarried he would take her as a consort. My question is, given that adultery is one of the seven Noahide laws and one of the 3 transgressions for which one must give up one's life rather than violate, for what reason or by what right did Avraham and Sarah perpetrate this ruse? Shouldn't Sarah, under fear of rape/adultry have disclosed her relationship? And, shouldn't Avraham allowed himself to be killed, or perhaps at least wait until his life was threatened, before putting Sarah in that predicament? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Zohar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.1.81b.7?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">part 1, 81b-82a</a>) says that Avraham saw the Shechinah with Sarah, and therefore knew that she'd be safe:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רַבִּי יֵיסָא אָמַר יָדַע הֲוָה אַבְרָהָם דְּכֻלְהוּ מִצְרָאֵי שְׁטִיפִין אִנּוּן בְּזִמָּה, וְכֵיוָן דְּכָל הַאי\n  יָדַע אַמַּאי לָא דָחִיל עַל אִתְּתֵיהּ דְּלָא אַהֲדַר מֵאָרְחָא וְלָא יֵיעוּל לְתַמָּן. אֶלָּא בְּגִין דְּחָמָא שְׁכִינְתָּא עִמָּהּ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the Midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.32?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra Rabbah 32:5</a>) adds that her experience there enabled the Jewish women during the Egyptian exile to be protected from arayos:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רַבִּי הוּנָא בְּשֵׁם רַבִּי חִיָּא בַּר אַבָּא אָמַר שָׂרָה אִמֵּנוּ יָרְדָה לְמִצְרַיִם וְגָדְרָה עַצְמָהּ מִן הָעֶרְוָה, וְנִגְדְּרוּ כָּל הַנָּשִׁים בִּזְכוּתָהּ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8176#v=13&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lech Lecha 12:13</a> that they were actually in less danger this way than if they had admitted that they were married.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After all that occurred in Egypt and in the land of the Philistines we\n  can conclude that - to which European countries in our modern times\n  may not be without analogy - virgins, unmarried women were more\n  protected against the prevailing immorality than married women. And\n  add to that, a stranger! In both cases, married or unmarried, Sarah's\n  honour was in danger. But, as a married woman the danger would be\n  imminently threatening. One simply kills the objecting husband and\n  rapes the wife. In the case of an unmarried girl accompanied by her\n  brother one hopes to get her through the favor of that brother. In any\n  case this way takes longer, postpones the matter, and in the meantime\n  Hashem can help.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Egyptians (even the nobles) would have thus, restrained themselves while they tried to get Avraham to agree. Once Par'o expressed an interest, they would have withdrawn and been careful not to offend someone that Par'o wanted to favor. Avraham was successful until Par'o decided to stop playing around and kidnap Sarah.</p>\n\n<p>If Avraham had not taken this tack from the beginning, he would have been unable to make the claim later.</p>\n\n<p>The point Rav Hirsch is making is that one is allowed to take steps in order to avoid being forced into a position of יהרג ואל יעבר. In the way the culture of the time behaved, what he did was to prevent them from being faced with rape/adultery in the first place. Even after she was kidnapped and taken to the palace, Par'o first tried to appease Avraham. Then Hashem intervened so that Sarah was never placed in the יהרג ואל יעבר situation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is addressed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> in his commentary there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>התועלת השלישי הוא ג\"כ במידות והוא שכשיביא ההכרח שיגיע הרע לאדם מהראוי שיסתכל האדם באי זה אופן יתכן שיגיע לו יותר מעט מהרע ויבחר בו ולא יתרשל מזה מפני הרע שיקרה לו כי ראוי שיהיה נבחר הרע היותר מעט לברוח מהרע הגדול ממנו הלא תראה שאברם בחר לרדת לארך  מצרים לברוח מהרעב שהיה בארץ כנען ואע\"פ שהיה נכון המקום ההוא אל שיקרה לו מהגנות שתתגאל אשתו בזימת הארץ וראוי שתדע שלא היה בזה חטא לאברם כי שרה תעשה באונס מה שתעשה מזה ולזה לא תאסר לבעלה אפילו אחר נתינת התורה כמו שאמרו ז\"ל באסתר קרקע עולם היתה  ואם היה אברם בוחר סבל הרעב אשר היה אפשר שימות בו על סבל מה שאפשר שיקרה לשרה מהגנות היה זה חסידות של שטות כאמרם בשלישי מסוטה היכי דמי חסיד שוטה כגון דחזי דטבעה אתתא בנהרא ואמר לאו אורח ארעא לאצולה ולאיסתכולי בה</p>\n<p>The third lesson is also in character traits. And it is that when circumstances force that evil will reach man, it is proper for the man to look which way has the possibility of less evil and choose that one. And he should not give up on this on account of the evil that will happen to him, because it is proper to choose the lesser evil to escape from the greater evil. Do you not see that Abram chose to descend to the land of Egypt to escape from the famine that was in the land of Canaan, even though that place was predisposed to the occurrence of the degradation that his wife be sexual in the promiscuity of the land.</p>\n<p>And it is proper that you should know that there was not a sin for Abram in this, because Sarah did what she did under coercion and would therefore not be forbidden to her husband even after the giving of the Torah – as the Sages say about Esther that she was like mere ground. And if Abram had chosen to bear the famine, in which it was possible for him to die, over bearing the possible degradation that could happen to Sarah, it would be piety of foolishness. As [the Sages] say in [Chapter] Three of Sotah: \"What is a pious fool? For example, he sees a woman drowning in the river and he says 'it is not the way of the land to save her and look at her'.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I understand Friday dinner, blessing over Sabbath candles, blessing over bread, and blessing over wine, and I know that Havdalah comes at the end.  But what else? Basically, what does a typical Jewish USA-ian household do to celebrate Sabbath?</p>\n\n<p>I understand it varies between Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.  I'd like to understand what is normative or typical.  I'm corresponding with a fiction author who uses Jewish characters but never has them do anything religious, and now he's asking for \"traditional family observances of the sabbath\".  So assume if you will the typical conservative family Friday night, Saturday, and Saturday night activities. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Note: Orthodox</p>\n\n<p>Shabbat begins with Kabbalat Shabbat, the Friday evening \"pre-Shabbat\" prayer service to welcome the Divine Presence into the home. </p>\n\n<p>Following this is Ma'ariv (also called Arvit) which is the evening prayer service. </p>\n\n<p>The traditional hymns \"Shalom Aleichem\" and \"Eishet Chayil\" are sung before the Friday night meal. </p>\n\n<p>The Friday night meal opens with Kiddush, the benediction on wine, and the cutting of the Challah, the bread. A hot meal prepared before Shabbat is served, and the family spends time together usually with Divrei Torah, small thoughts on the weekly Parsha. </p>\n\n<p>Many people will sing Zemirot, hymns, at the Shabbat table. There are many traditional Zemirot printed in most prayer books. </p>\n\n<p>On Shabbat day, the day is opened with Shacharit, the morning service, which includes the Torah Reading in synagogue. This service can last a long time. Not long after Shacharit is Mussaf, the additional mid-afternoon service recited only on Shabbat and the holidays. Most congregations recite Shacharit and Mussaf back-to-back, for convenience. (Also, Shacharit tends to be scheduled for a later time on Shabbat, so people have a chance to sleep in a little and rest.) </p>\n\n<p>Between Shacharit and Mincha, the afternoon service, people will do a number of things: learning Torah on their own, attending Torah classes and/or Shiurim, taking naps, or playing board games with their family and friends. If there is an Eruv, a \"Shabbat walk\" is not uncommon. </p>\n\n<p>It is the custom to have three hot meals on Shabbat: one Friday night, one Shabbat morning, and one Shabbat day. Each of these meals have their own rituals accompanying them (for instance, the Shabbat morning Kiddush), and there are Zemirot to be sung as well. </p>\n\n<p>Most congregations pray Mincha later in the afternoon towards evening, so Mincha and Ma'ariv can be back-to-back (again for convenience). </p>\n\n<p>Havdalah is made, and many people have a \"Melaveh Malka\" meal, a meal in honor of the Shabbat's departure on Saturday night. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>Note: Reconstructionist</strong></p>\n\n<p>I attend a small Reconstructionist synagogue in Northern California.  We are not able to afford to pay our Rabbi full time so we have Friday night services twice a month and Saturday morning services once a month, plus a Friday night chant circle (think Shefa Gold), the occasional B'nai Mitzvah, and various other events.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Friday night:</strong>  Tonight we will attend services (not sundown yet here), which we drive to, as does almost everyone there.  They last about 2 hours and include a lot of singing, chanting, and speaking of prayers in both English and Hebrew.  The Rabbi gives a drosh (which are always wonderful).  Our siddurim have both languages plus transliteration.  Everything is 100% egalitarian. </p>\n\n<p>The service starts with candle lighting.  After the service we go into what we call the oneg room for a kiddish (we just call it oneg).  A light buffet dinner provided by whatever person/family volunteered that week.  We pray over the wine (with grape juice and water for kids and non-drinkers) and then the bread.  Then we eat and chat.</p>\n\n<p>If we're home Friday night, we light shabbat candles and have a sit down dinner.  I don't know what most of my fellow congregants do regularly but at least some weeks we all try to make Friday night dinner special, and sometimes get together with others (sometimes we have a potluck dinner at shul).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Saturday morning</strong>, if there is a service we drive to shul and attend.  We wear talliot (tallism? I often mix the Yiddish with the Hebrew) and bring out the Torah for a reading or 3.  We do not have designated readings and do not make any distinction between someone who is a Cohen or Levite vs not, though readers are chosen in advance so they can practice.  We have a full service that runs about 2 hours, along with the usual singing, etc.  We sometimes do Storahtelling or have a drosh, but those are usually for special occasions.  People who have had a B'nai Mitzvah can sometimes lead a service and we have guest leaders too (also on Fridays).  Saturday morning services are also followed by a kiddish, or at least the wine.</p>\n\n<p>Occasionally, our shul will have a Saturday night service for Havdalah.  I admit we rarely do that at home, though we have all the materials.  And of course we have services for various holidays, not just High Holy Days, plus other holiday events (a Passover seder, a Chanukah party, late night Shavuot study) throughout the year.</p>\n\n<p>People differ greatly on what they do and don't do on Shabbat.  The shul's board and other leadership do not do shul business on Shabbat.  Many congregants do not do their usual work on Shabbat, or at least try not to (not everyone gets to pick their schedules).    </p>\n\n<p>Some people try to make Shabbat family time and go for walks or play games that aren't electronic.  Some try to do some Torah study or other religious study.  Some families with young children get together to do outdoor activities, weather permitting.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the prohibitions just aren't part of our lives though.  I don't know anyone aside from Orthodox friends/family who won't drive, use electricity, cook, etc.  Two Conservative Rabbis I know will not write on Shabbat, but I don't know anyone Reconstructionist who doesn't write.  Setting the day aside as \"different\" is common, but we are not frum.</p>\n\n\n",

After describing how he prayed for 40 days and 40 nights for the forgiveness of the sin of the golden calf, Moses says that he <em>also</em> prayed for Aaron, apart from his praying for all of the Children of Israel.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וָֽאֶתְנַפַּל֩ לִפְנֵ֨י יְהוָ֜ה כָּרִֽאשֹׁנָ֗ה אַרְבָּעִ֥ים יוֹם֙ וְאַרְבָּעִ֣ים לַ֔יְלָה לֶ֚חֶם לֹ֣א אָכַ֔לְתִּי וּמַ֖יִם לֹ֣א שָׁתִ֑יתִי עַ֤ל כָּל־חַטַּאתְכֶם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר חֲטָאתֶ֔ם לַֽעֲשׂ֥וֹת הָרַ֛ע בְּעֵינֵ֥י יְהוָ֖ה לְהַכְעִיסֽוֹ׃ כִּ֣י יָגֹ֗רְתִּי מִפְּנֵ֤י הָאַף֙ וְהַ֣חֵמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר קָצַ֧ף יְהוָ֛ה עֲלֵיכֶ֖ם לְהַשְׁמִ֣יד אֶתְכֶ֑ם וַיִּשְׁמַ֤ע יְהוָה֙ אֵלַ֔י גַּ֖ם בַּפַּ֥עַם הַהִֽוא׃ וּֽבְאַהֲרֹ֗ן הִתְאַנַּ֧ף יְהוָ֛ה מְאֹ֖ד לְהַשְׁמִיד֑וֹ וָֽאֶתְפַּלֵּ֛ל גַּם־בְּעַ֥ד אַֽהֲרֹ֖ן בָּעֵ֥ת הַהִֽוא׃</p>\n<p>I threw myself down before the LORD—eating no bread and drinking no water forty days and forty nights, as before—because of the great wrong you had committed, doing what displeased the LORD and vexing Him.\nFor I was in dread of the LORD’s fierce anger against you, which moved Him to wipe you out. And that time, too, the LORD gave heed to me.\nMoreover, the LORD was angry enough with Aaron to have destroyed him; so I <strong>also</strong> interceded for Aaron at that time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, the incident of the golden calf is specifically held up as an instance of <em>not</em> showing nepotism, because the Levites didn't favor their relatives whom they were instructed to kill (Exodus 32:27, Deuteronomy 33:9 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.33?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Deuteronomy.33.9.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">according to Rashi</a>).</p>\n<p>Making the golden calf was clearly an embarrassing sin, and Aaron's part in it is no exception, but for Moses to pray for his brother (as he does elsewhere for his sister, Numbers 12:13) is not a bad thing.

Among them, he includes <em>parah adumah</em> (the laws of the red heifer.) </p>\n\n<p>This is puzzling. The beginning of <em>Parshat Chukat</em> refers to the laws of <em>parah adumah</em> (Red cow) as a <em>chok</em> (illogical law that we perform for the sake of G-d), not a <em>mishpat</em>(logical law).</p>\n\n<p>So, why is Mechilta including this among the <em>mishpatim</em>, here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Bamidbar Rabba 19,1 it describes that the Kohen that sprinkles the <em>Mei Chattas</em> (solution of red cow Ashes) on the Tamei whereby the _tamei becomes <em>tahor</em> and the sprinkler who was <em>Tahor</em> becomes <em>Tamei</em> is The \"decree which is impossible to understand\" as only G-d can bringing purity out of the ritually contaminated:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"זֹאת חֻקַּת\" זש\"ה (איוב יד, ד): \"מי יתן טהור מטמא לא אחד\" תמן תנינן: \"העוסקין בפרה מתחלה ועד סוף מטמאין בגדים, היא גופה מטהרת בגדים\". אמר הקדוש ברוך הוא: חקה חקקתי, גזירה גזרתי, אי אתה רשאי לעבור על גזרתי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that according to Rashi Bamidbar 19,2 the idea of purchasing and burning the Red cow and the laws that it shouldn't have a blemish  not pulled a yolk is actually understandable.        </p>\n\n<p>The Cow has to be purchased with public funds as an atonement for the \"son\" i.e the golden calf which people donated their gold to make. The cow has to be red representing the sin which is red that we want to turn white i.e atone (this happen to the string on the Goat of Azazel on Yom Kippuras well). It has to be without blemish just like we had no blemish before we sinned with the golden calf. And it cannot have had a yoke on its back just like we took of the Yoke of Heaven from our backs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"ויקחו אליך\" - משלהם כשם שהם פרקו נזמי הזהב לעגל משלהם כך יביאו זו לכפרה משלהם</p>\n  \n  <p>\"פרה אדמה\" - משל לבן שפחה שטינף פלטין של מלך אמרו תבא אמו ותקנח הצואה כך תבא פרה ותכפר על העגל</p>\n  \n  <p>\"אדמה\" - על שם (ישעיהו א, יח) אם יאדימו כתולע שהחטא קרוי אדום</p>\n  \n  <p>\"תמימה\" - על שם ישראל שהיו תמימים ונעשו בו בעלי מומין תבא זו ותכפר עליה' ויחזרו לתמותם</p>\n  \n  <p>\"לא עלה עליה עול\" - כשם שפרקו מעליהם עול שמים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since according to Seder Olam Rabba CHapter 6 straight after the 10 commandments Moshe went up for 120 days during that time the Golden calf had already been made, all the subsequent commandments including the Making of the Mishkan and Mizbeach mentioned at the end of Pasrshas Yisro and the rest of the Torah were given after the Golden calf was made. (Had they not sinned with the Golden calf they would have lived forever and not died like Adam before he Sinned.)</p>\n\n\n",

Both the questioner there and the various sources cited <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/11661/\">in this answer there</a> seem to assume that it would have been better for Rashi to say nothing rather than ask a question and leave it unanswered. </p>\n\n<p>The Maskil L’Dovid cited there asks the question as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מה בא ללמדנו שאינו יודע אם לא ידע ישתוק</p>\n  \n  <p>What is he coming to teach us that he doesn’t know [this]? If he doesn’t know, let him be quiet!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Likewise the Sifsei Chachamim’s wording:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש מקשים מה בא להודיענו שאינו יודע אם לא ידע ישתוק</p>\n  \n  <p>There are those who ask what Rashi is coming to inform us that he doesn’t know [this]. If he doesn’t know let him be quiet!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(I’d quote the Lubavitcher Rebbe cited in that answer as well, but I don’t speak Yiddish.)</p>\n\n<p>What is the basis for this? If Rashi’s point in writing this commentary is to explain the Pesukim, why would it be better for him to be quiet rather than alert us to a problem that he can’t answer?</p>\n\n<p>There’s certainly precedent for asking questions and leaving them unanswered. All throughout Shas halachic questions are posed and left unanswered, but there’s what to learn just from the question. Why isn’t that an option here, to explain that Rashi, in his goal to explain the Pesukim, felt that it’s better to highlight a question than leave it unanswered?</p>\n\n<p>Others in the cited question answer similar to what I’ve outlined above. The Lubavitcher Rebbe, for instance, answers that Rashi just didn’t have a sufficiently simple explanation, even if he had a Midrashic one. But the Maskil L’Dovid doesn’t like this, as he poses a wildly different understanding in Rashi, where “I don’t know” doesn’t refer to the explanation of the passuk at all, but rather <em>is</em> its explanation, in a sense. Likewise, the Sifsei Chachamim, in an admittedly simpler explanation, understands that Rashi wasn’t sure which of several explanations were correct, but still isn’t willing to answer that Rashi didn’t have an explanation at all. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why were these two commentaries unwilling to take Rashi at face value, insisting that it can’t be he said “I don’t know” because if he really didn’t he wouldn’t have said anything?</strong></p>\n\n\n",

A nation that was severely enslaved for hundreds of years, I assume, would want to erase the idea of slavery from its norms, namely a free Jew being a slave of another more powerful and resourceful Jew. I would also presume they would want to eradicate that idea for all nations, being \"אור לגויים\" - the enlightenment for all nations.</p>\n\n<p>However, the first thing that G-d says to them is that they will continue that practice - selling and buying a needy and starving fellow into human slavery.</p>\n\n<p>It does not sound right to me at all. </p>\n\n<p>Why G-d did not promise the Jews to end slavery once and for all and why did the Jews not revolt against such laws?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In parshas noach, c'naan is cursed: וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אָר֣וּר כְּנָ֑עַן עֶ֥בֶד עֲבָדִ֖ים יִֽהְיֶ֥ה לְאֶחָֽיו. In a similar way to how Yaakov blessed his sons, Noach was actually directing his children towards the path in life which would yield them the greatest success in this world. He was telling C'naan that as a servant to others he would be able to reach his ultimate shleimus as a human being. Because of who he and the character traits he has, he can do the best for the world by being an eved. See Gur Aryeh, he IS a despised person, in leardership he will not allow society to develop, he will do best for everyone as a slave (including himself because he will not have the freedom to follow his desires to the point of destroying himself). This is the first instance of slavery in the torah (I think) and therefore we learn its essence here. \nSlavery exists in the torah because there are certain people (the torah delineates who) for whom slavery is their best chance of a successful life. And sometimes people are able to recognise this themselves and give themselves up for slavery.\nWe have laws about how we treat a slave becuase he is a human, a human who has a different path towards a successful life.\nWe, all of us, are slaves to Hashem. The slavery in Mitzrayim existed to teach us what it is to be a slave, how all encompassing and life consuming slavery is so that we could be ideal servants of Hashem.\nWe never want to forget what slavery is, we never want to forget that we were slaves  (and Hashem took us out) because that experience of slavery informs out lives to this day.\nAnd we also recognise that just as our slavery enables us to reach our fullest potential, so too, in certain situations for certain people, slavery is very much in place to help them realise their greatest potential. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>The Torah allowed the concept of slavery but restricted its practices with the intention of teaching the wrongs within the system. The goal of the Torah was to end slavery. Other examples are the sacrifices, polygamy, and much more. Yet it allows the license to these primitive laws because the ancient Israelites lived in a time where slavery was customary.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam teaches that although G-d can change human nature, He choices not to do so. Thus G-d has to allow certain rules in the Torah that seem harsh even today. The legislation of slavery, sacrifices, and capital punishment served a better interest for the public, even though a careful reading and analysis will show that the Torah never condoned these practices. For example, the Torah’s legislation of a slave’s life made his life much easier than his contemporaries in other countries. So much so, that the rabbis later said, “he who acquires a slave secures a master over himself,” for in Hebrew the correct translation is “servant.”</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the sacrificial system was restricted and minimizing only to certain animals and the abhorrence of capital punishment made its infliction impossible. The same can be applied to stoning misbehaving children in Deuteronomy 21:18-21, not offering peace to the Canaanites in Deuteronomy 20:16-18, the laws of a condemned city in Deuteronomy 13:13-19, and the law of a captive woman and Deuteronomy 21:10-14. </p>\n\n<p>For example, the law for an “eye for an eye” was always met with compensation as restricted in the Torah and Oral law in the Talmud(s). The injury was not met with physical damage in any way. The anti-Semites that use this phrase, like slavery and many others, to justify revenge which is forbidden in (Leviticus19:18) shows that these laws were never implemented.</p>\n\n<p>Sources: The parashah found in Exodus 21:19 and Targum Onkelos understands that and eye for an eye is met with payment. See also Midrash Mekhilta and the Babylonian Talmud, Bava Kamma 85a. See Talmud (ibid.). Also Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice (4:1) makes is abundantly clear that the law is not physical damage. </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is Aryeh Kaplan's definition of the self in Jewish Meditation accurate (\"nothingness\" chapter)?",
    "content": "# Is Aryeh Kaplan's definition of the self in Jewish Meditation accurate (\"nothingness\" chapter)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Let me preface this question by stating that I'm Jewish with a background in Zen Buddhism. Eastern philosophy was my first introduction to spirituality coming from an atheistic/materialistic worldview. However, I've been studying Judaism, and I'm currently reading <em>Jewish Meditation</em> by Aryeh Kaplan, but I'm confused about his description of the self in the chapter titled \"nothingness.\" I've read <em>Letters To a Buddhist</em> Jew by Akiva Tatz as well, and unless I'm mistaken, they seem to disagree with each other, which is what brings me here. </p>\n\n<p>Kaplan's definition of the self follows an argument similar to one I've encountered in Buddhism. He states that because one can think of the body, then the body alone cannot represent the self. The same goes for the mind and even the soul. I can conceive of the mind and the soul, so that which is observing those categories (the self) must be even more fundamental. Therefore, he states that the soul \"cannot be the real me.\" He then argues that volition, or the capacity to bring forth action or thought, is still more fundamental than thought. He writes: \"because I must will myself to think, the source of my will is beyond thought.\" In other words, \"the source of my will\" is the closest thing to this definition of \"self\" he's seeking, and since no mental category exists for the \"source of my will,\" it's in the same category as contemplating nothingness. He then provides the Hebrew word for אני which spells אין or nothing after being rearranged as an example illustrating this.  </p>\n\n<p>The chapter continues by introducing Kabbalistic teachings that speak of God as that which is beyond all categories. So in the same way that \"the source of my will\" is beyond mental categories and akin to nothingness, so is G-d. However, the self is not G-d, and Kaplan is clearly not arguing that. I'm not sure what he's trying to illustrate here, which takes me back to a major problem I encountered while studying Buddhism. </p>\n\n<p>One of the most important teachings in Buddhism is that the self is an illusion. As such, enlightenment, or the cessation of all suffering, is attained when one fully realizes this \"truth.\" The final conclusion of this line of reasoning is that one attains a state of consciousness where there is no longer any distinction between oneself and creation. There is no longer an inside or an outside or a \"me\" or \"you.\" However, this is absolute insanity and implies that since G-d is everything, and enlightenment is a state where there is no longer any distinction between one and the universe, one is or can become G-d. In fact, if you study abnormal psychology, you'll find that many people believe they're G-d while in a psychotic state.  </p>\n\n<p>After reading <em>Letters to a Buddhist Jew</em> and studying Kaballah, my current understanding is that although G-d is everything, and as part of that creation I, too, am part and parcel of everything, a fundamental separation still exists between the Creator and the vessel of creation. Therefore, attaining absolute oneness with G-d is never possible and claiming to do so is perhaps the worst form of blasphemy. </p>\n\n<p>So if the vessel is the fundamental unit of creation then individual souls can be considered the fundamental units of man. The highest spiritual state I can strive for, then, is the full expression of my soul as opposed to my bodily inclinations. Therefore, I'm not sure what Kaplan is trying to illustrate in that chapter. As far as I can tell, the soul is, in fact, that fundamental unit of \"self\" he was trying to define despite stating that the \"soul cannot be the real me.\" </p>\n\n<p>Is Kaplan's definition of the self accurate? Perhaps my understanding of this chapter is off, but I feel like his description of the soul is misguided (or at least not Jewish).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I read the book Jewish Meditation many years ago and going through my library, it appears that I must have lent it to someone. So this is unfortunately only using what you have copied here.</p>\n\n<p>The two paragraphs you use to state Rabbi Kaplan’s definition of self sound correct but the English translation is losing what he is trying to say.</p>\n\n<p><em>Self</em> in Hebrew is often called יש (Yesh). Rabbi Kaplan is using a less used term to point out the Hebrew play on words. He is saying <em>self</em> is אני (Ani), which means <em>I</em>. And that through the nullification of that sense of self (in his terms, the <em>I</em>), one achieves a state of אין (Ayin), which means <em>nothingness</em>. That this nothingness is the concept he describes as <em>transcending</em> all of creation, whether physical, emotional, intellectual or even spiritual.</p>\n\n<p>And this is described in other places as the <em>Pintele Yid</em>, the true, innermost aspect of the Jew which is in the words of the Tanya, <em>a piece of the transcendent G-d</em>, (חלק אלקא ממעל ממש) so to speak.</p>\n\n<p>And this term for G-d is described in the words of the Kabbalists as אין סוף (Ain Sof). This term for G-d can be understood as <em>infinite transcendence</em> .</p>\n\n<p>Considering the background you express here and your personal spiritual yearning, I cannot recommend strongly enough that you should take the time to listen to the You Tube video lectures of Rabbi Shimon Jacobson on the book known as <em>Ayin Beis</em>. It deals directly with the subject you are investigating and will connect you with authentic, traditional Jewish teaching about it.</p>\n\n<p>All the lectures are in English and will not disappoint.

    "content": "# To serve, the biggest command?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Looking at the basis for our covenant with G-d, I noticed G-d said to Avraham (Bereshit 17:1): “Walk before Me”, which is sometimes understood to mean: “Serve Me”. And also (Bereshit 17:9): “You shall keep My covenant”.</p>\n<p>Afterwards G-d Himself says regards this in\nBereshit 26:5 that Avraham obeyed the Voice of the Almighty and indeed kept it.</p>\n<p>I noticed some similarities when looking at the story of Mount Sinai revelation. First, G-d says (Shemot 19:5): “If you will obey My voice” and “keep My covenant”.</p>\n<p>The people response was: “All that the Lord has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient (i.e. we will obey and keep).”</p>\n<p>Secondly, I noticed G-d's saying (Bereshit 17:7): “I will establish My covenant between Me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to thy G-d and to thy seed after thee.”</p>\n<p>While in Shemot 6:7 G-d promises that He will take them as His own people and that He will be their G-d.</p>\n<p>Many more similarities can be found.</p>\n<p>These covenants seem to be based on two principles. From G-d's side the covenant contains certain promises. From the human side the covenant asks for commitment and obedience. It all starts with acknowledging G-d, and accepting Him as G-d, but once we do this, it seems one needs to show obedience (we make ourselves avadim, to be His servants, and He promises to be our G-d).</p>\n<p>With obedience to seem to be such a big part of our covenant / relationship with G-d, why isn’t it the first commandment to be found after getting to know G-d?</p>\n<p>Isn’t serving G-d the biggest Mitzvah of them all? One that covers all other commandments, one that encompasses the entire  range of what’s being asked of us? Of course obedience and service is asked and commanded many times, but are there any commentaries which teach that serving G-d is the basis/main item for our entire covenantial relationship?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There exists a verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.55?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 25:55</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>כִּֽי־לִ֤י בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ עֲבָדִ֔ים עֲבָדַ֣י הֵ֔ם</strong> אֲשֶׁר־הוֹצֵ֥אתִי אוֹתָ֖ם מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם אֲנִ֖י יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶֽם׃</p>\n<p><strong>For it is to Me that the Israelites are servants: they are My servants</strong>, whom I freed from the land of Egypt—I, your G-d Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.22b.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 22b</a> uses the verse as rebuke for any Jew who chooses to be a slave of someone else, but not a separate mitzvah.

Torah study is one component of a Torah life, but one who serves a Torah scholar learns about every aspect of life from his actions. This is derived from the verse that speaks in praise of Elisha, as it is stated: “Here is Elisha son of Shafat, who poured water over Elijah’s hands” (II Kings 3:11). The verse does not say that he learned from Elijah, rather that he poured water, which teaches that the service of Torah represented by Elisha pouring water over Elijah’s hands is greater than its study.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To Love the LORD your God with all your heart, soul, and mind is the greatest commandment- for all else hinges on this.</p>\n<p>This comes down to what is in our hearts, what motivates and drives us.

This is clear from the words of the Rosh (the source for this idea). It is not a requirement because you are allowed to rely on the <em>chazakah</em> that the <em>tzitzit</em> were valid and are thus presumed to still be valid until proven otherwise. Thus, even if it turns out that the <em>tzitzit</em> were not valid, there is no problem of wearing a garment without <em>tzitzit</em> or of making a blessing in vain, since at the time that you put it on and made the blessing you had every right to do so, relying on the <em>chazakah</em>.</p>\n<p>However, it is an act of piety to check the strings beforehand, because even if you did nothing forbidden by donning the garment (that in actuality did not have valid <em>tzitzit</em>) and making a blessing, at the end of the day a blessing in vain still came from your mouth.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וברור הוא שמעיקר הדין אין חשש בזה דמקורו הוא מהרא\"ש והוא כתב בלשון זה בסוף הל' ציצת והחרד על דבר ה' יבדוק קודם כדי שלא יברך לבטלה עכ\"ל ובתשובה כלל ב' כתב שהעולם לא נהגו לבדקו דמוקמינן אחזקה ע\"ש וזה אינו אלא ממדת חסידות ולכן כתב חשש ברכה לבטלה ולאו משום דחמירה טובא כמ\"ש מקודם אלא דלענין טלית בלא ציצת אף אם ימצא שפסולה מיד יפשטנו ומקודם לא עבד איסור כיון שמדינא היה מותר ללובשו מטעם חזקה אלא דלענין ברכה לבטלה נהי דאין עליו עונש כי היה מותר לו לברך מטעם חזקה מ\"מ סוף סוף הוציא ברכה לבטלה מפיו ולכן ממדת חסידות יש לו לבדוק</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like he is saying that there is something inherently bad about a blessing in vain even in a context in which the blessing was entirely permissible. What is the nature of this \"badness\", and why doesn't it also apply to the fact that at the end of the day you also still wore a garment without <em>tzitzit</em>? I.e. both acts are normally forbidden, and both acts are permitted in this case for the very same reason. So why is one of the acts still considered \"bad\" while the other one is not?</p>\n\n\n",

But shouldn't the expected expense of farming the land factor into its value?

As some scholars put it, “the consumer’s sense of gain or loss is directly related to the usefulness of the goods in question”; ... it can thus be argued that the item that is subjectively valued at a higher level will generate the greatest <strong>loss aversion, regardless of its objective value</strong>.</p>\n<p>...And in assessing what would be a more severe punishment for the tortfeasor, imposing the penalty that damager pay from iddit is indeed more powerful, but on a psychological basis rather than an objective financial one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A very good question. It seems from different Sugyot (Kiddushin, BM and more) that a $1000 worth of good land is <strong>perceivably</strong> <em>worth more</em> than $1000 worth of worst land. For example, אחים שחלקו - brothers that inherited land and seemingly divide it by its value might have additional considerations, not strictly assessable in value and therefore they are allowed to break the deal later.</p>\n\n<p>A possible reason for that is (my own conclusion) that in their times they had very little flexibility in prices, and the price did not reflect additional considerations. This is consistent with the Sugya of Ona'a - how come that different tomato are sold in the market for the same price? So they had a price list with only 3 types of land, however, the \"best land\" had many additional circumstantial benefits not assessed in its price, like proximity to water sources, easy access, easy to trade etc. and more.</p>\n\n<p>An additional example would be paying a $1000 debt with $100 or $1 bills (as the Gemmorah claims that the debt could be returned with crops). Even if that's the same monetary value, one is perceivably valued more.</p>\n\n<p>So paying with the best land does not pay the exact amount of debt, but losing additional benefits not included in the price. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It should be noted that nowadays we tend to assess the value taking into considerations all possible pros and cons. it reminds me that some 20 years ago, here in Israel, the semi-official price list for a car only included the model and the year. Today it has more than 10 additional features, like types of previous ownership, mileage and more. </p>\n\n\n",

According to Rabenu Yitschak after the acquisition of the object, there is no more psul of mitsva habaa beavera for the thief, because the object is acquired before the Mitsva, the Avera is already done and doesn't more cause psul.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>… והא דאמר בריש הגוזל קמא (ב''ק צד.) הרי שגזל סאה של חיטין טחנה לשה ואפאה והרים ממנה חלה כיצד יברך אין זה מברך אלא מנאץ ואע''ג דקנה קודם לכן דשנוי קונה לענין ברכה ראוי להחמיר יותר וחשיב מצוה הבאה בעבירה אע''ג דכבר קנה אין להזכיר שם שמים עליו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But, according to Rabenu Yitschak <strong>despite that a thief can make a mitsva when a stolen object is beforehand acquired, to bless on the Mitsva remains a Mitsva Habaa Beavera</strong> (the line of Rabenu Tam hasn't this discrepancy, because he holds that the psul remains even after the Kinyanim and shinui hashem).</p>\n<p>Note. It seems from Tosfot that if Mitsva Habaa Beavera is a Rabbinic Psul, the Mitsva is done Bediavad. But if it is a Deorayita Psul, the Mitsva is not done. This is indeed one of the opinions in Tosfot.</p>\n<p>There are two opinions that MHB is a psul Deorayita, Rabenu Tam and Rabenu Yitschack, with differences explained above.</p>\n<p>There is an opinon for which the ganav alone has a problem of MHB, reported in SA in the link below (in Bet Yosef the author is identified as the Orchot Chayim).</p>\n<p>There are also discussions in Rishonim if MHB applies for Mitsvot Derabanan, see a long discussion in the Ran at the beginning of the third chapter of Succa.</p>\n<p>From the words of the <a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%98_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA OC 649.1</a> It seems that he holds the line of Rabenu Yitschak.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are there any recordings of the Tanakh read or chanted according to reconstructed Ancient Hebrew pronunciation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm looking for audio recordings of the Tanakh, but without modern or Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciations - rather an attempt to recreate what Ancient (and Archaic) Hebrew actually sounded like.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also very interested in examples of older types of cantillation. Is the Yemenite style of singing/chanting supposed to be older?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It's a very difficult task to reconstruct the way Hebrew was pronounced in ancient times. As you might know, the Hebrew alphabet is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">abjad</a>, which marks consonants in most of the cases, and the vowels have to be guessed using some help, called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater_lectionis#Hebrew\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">matres lectionis</a>. Therefore, linguists could reconstruct most consonants based on similar languages, and many rabbis from the Arab world used similar technique to figure out the meaning of some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon#Hebrew_examples\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rare words</a>. Another possibility is to use transliterations of Hebrew words in other languages (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secunda_(Hexapla)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ancient Greek</a>, Latin), but one should be careful with this for obvious reasons. However, even in the era of the Talmud there were debates on different pronunciations (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.24b.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 24b</a>).</p>\n<p>On YouTube you can find many reconstructions. Almost exclusively they do the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberian_Hebrew\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiberian Hebrew</a>, which developed in the Land of Israel in the 8th–10th centuries CE. The reason is simple, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Masoretes</a> tried to add some kind of notation of the vowels in order to preserve the reading tradition they had. There were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_vocalization\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">other</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_vocalization\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">traditions</a> as well, but the Tiberian one quickly became the standard among Jews.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/O7RIAPosxEI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This recording</a> tries to show how the Tiberians pronounced the consonants. In <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qi_i2w6tpCU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">another video</a> he tries to read a sample text. Here's <a href=\"http://www.budling.hu/%7Ekalman/arch/popular/szoszatyar/20170118.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">another recording</a> from 9:11. Please note that the vocals are mostly educated guesses. Rhymes, which are really helpful to determine the exact nature of vocals, were only used from medieval Jewish poetry. This reconstruction is very similar to the Yemenite tradition, since people from the Arab world can distinguish letters that most European can't. With the help of their geographical isolation, Yemenite Jews were very keen on preserving their own tradition, which were almost intact until their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Magic_Carpet_(Yemen)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">moving to Israel</a>.</p>\n<p>Regarding the cantillation part, it is a scientific dispute whether a single tradition existed. Some researchers maintain that there was one (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Ha%C3%AFk-Vantoura#%22Music_of_the_Bible_Revealed%22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Haik-Vantoura</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jewish-music.huji.ac.il/content/masoretic-chant-bible\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Weil</a>), while most of them (e.g. <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=YGxLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA105\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avenary</a>) refuse such possibility. Since there are different cantillation marks with the same grammatical function, it is quite sure that the Masoretes had a musical tradition to read the text, but musical notation was not advanced enough in those years.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Tiberian reading tradition has been reconstructed by Prof. Geoffrey Khan of Cambridge University.

Just as we don't try to save somebody sentenced in a Rabbinic court, we don't try to save somebody sentenced in the Heavenly court.</p>\n\n<p>(Needless to say that the in contrary, any intervention to the first type of disorders is readily allowed just like coping with any natural situation - if you're hungry you eat, if you're thirsty you drink etc.)</p>\n\n<p>So the Torah brings a big Chiddush here, related to the similar Gemmorah's (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.10a?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B\"B 10a</a>) discussion on G-d's relations with the Jewish nation: either as His slaves or His sons.

And one person went ahead and fed him and gave him to drink. If the king heard about this, would he not be angry with that person? And you, after all, are called slaves,\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We can see that if we behave like slaves, doctor's intervention will be perceived as negative, as overriding G-d's orders. the Gemmorah continues:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר לו ר\"ע אמשול לך משל למה הדבר דומה למלך בשר ודם שכעס על בנו וחבשו בבית האסורין וצוה עליו שלא להאכילו ושלא להשקותו והלך אדם אחד והאכילו והשקהו כששמע המלך לא דורון משגר לו ואנן קרוין בנים דכתיב (דברים יד, א) בנים אתם לה' אלהיכם</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Akiva said to Turnus Rufus: I will illustrate the opposite to you with a different parable. To what is this matter comparable? It is comparable to a king of flesh and blood who was angry with his son and put him in prison and ordered that he should not be fed or given to drink. And one person went ahead and fed him and gave him to drink. If the king heard about this once his anger abated, would he not react by sending that person a gift? And we are called sons, as it is written: “You are sons of the Lord your God” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, if the Jews are seen as G-d's sons, everyone who helps them, even if their father's angry with them, is welcomed and well compensated.</p>\n\n<p>Because we see the Jews as G-d's sons a doctor has the right to heal.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why may a master torture his non-Jewish slave?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We’re commanded to be sensitive to a convert, as we know what it’s like to be in a foreign land (Shemos 23:9):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְגֵ֖ר לֹ֣א תִלְחָ֑ץ וְאַתֶּ֗ם יְדַעְתֶּם֙ אֶת־נֶ֣פֶשׁ הַגֵּ֔ר כִּֽי־גֵרִ֥ים הֱיִיתֶ֖ם בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Do not oppress a convert: you know the soul of a stranger, for you were strangers in Mitzraim. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By the same logic, one would expect that we be commanded not to oppress a slave, as we know what it’s like from being slaves in Mitzraim. Yet the Rambam (Avadim 9:8) rules that, by non-Jewish slaves, one is technically allowed to oppress them:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מֻתָּר לַעֲבֹד בְּעֶבֶד כְּנַעֲנִי בְּפָרֶךְ. וְאַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהַדִּין כָּךְ מִדַּת חֲסִידוּת וְדַרְכֵי חָכְמָה שֶׁיִּהְיֶה אָדָם רַחְמָן וְרוֹדֵף צֶדֶק וְלֹא יַכְבִּיד עֵלּוֹ עַל עַבְדּוֹ וְלֹא יָצֵר לוֹ וְיַאֲכִילֵהוּ וְיַשְׁקֵהוּ מִכָּל מַאֲכָל וּמִכָּל מִשְׁתֶּה.</p>\n  \n  <p>One is allowed to make a non-Jewish slave work with hard work. Even though this is the law, it is the the pious measure and the way of wisdom that a man be merciful, chase righteousness, not weigh his yoke on his slave, not pain him, and feed him and give him to drink from all food and drink. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam goes on to describe how the earlier Sages would give their slaves from whatever they themselves were eating, even feeding them before themselves; how they wouldn’t embarrass them, reasoning that they were sentenced to enslavement, not embarrassment; how they would listen to their sorrows and comfort them, rather than heaping pain on them; etc.</p>\n\n<p>All that said: while one might be an idiot for doing so (not walking “in the way of wisdom”), the Rambam clearly writes that one is allowed to be a cruel master toward his non-Jewish slave. Why? The same way we’re supposed to be sensitive to other groups, since we know how it feels to be in that position, why isn’t there a strict requirement to be a kind master to a non-Jewish slave?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As @user15464 mentions in the comments, the Rambam defines \"porech\", or the torture that you quote as being permitted, in Avadim 1:6:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואיזו היא עבודת פרך זו עבודה שאין לה קצבה ועבודה שאינו צריך לה אלא תהיה מחשבתו להעבידו בלבד שלא יבטל</p>\n<p>What is \"porech\" labor? Labor that has no limit, or labor that is unnecessary and is asked of the servant with the intent to give him work so that he will not remain idle.</p>\n<p>מכאן אמרו חכמים שלא יאמר לו עדור תחת הגפנים עד שאבא שהרי לא נתן לו קצבה אלא יאמר לו עדור עד שעה פלונית או עד מקום פלוני</p>\n<p>Based on the above, our Sages said that a master should not tell a Hebrew servant: \"Hoe under the vines until I come,\" for he has not placed a limit on the work asked of him. Instead, he should tell him: \"Hoe until this and this time,\" or \"until you reach this and this place.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, this means giving the slave work without a defined limit or giving him busy work. For a Jewish slave, this is forbidden. However, for a non-Jewish slave this is technically allowed (though frowned upon, as you quoted). This is not permitting \"torture\" of a slave, rather this is a mandate that Jewish slaves have an additional requirement to be treated better.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Koren Siddur on Kal Atzmotai Tomarna\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>(Note: likely not relevant to those who Daven/read Hebrew with an Ashkenazi pronunciation.)</em></p>\n\n<p>This Shabbos I was asked to lead Pesukei Dezimrah at a shul I was visiting, and I was given a Koren Siddur to daven from.  I noticed that when I reached the Passuk of \"כׇּ֥ל עַצְמוֹתַ֨י׀ תֹּאמַרְנָה֮ י״י֗ מִ֥י כָ֫מ֥וֹךָ מַצִּ֣יל עָ֭נִי מֵחָזָ֣ק מִמֶּ֑נּוּ וְעָנִ֥י וְ֝אֶבְי֗וֹן מִגֹּֽזְלֽוֹ׃\" in Nishmat, they punctuated the first word (really letter) with a Kamatz Katan, to be read as \"Kol\". I found this interesting, as I had always been told that this was one of the exceptions to the general reading of \"Kol\" with a Kamatz Katan, and I had been taught to read it \"Kal\". </p>\n\n<p>I looked into it in two ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I consulted the commentaries on that Passuk (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Tehillim/35.10#e1n6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tehillim 35:10</a>), which confirmed what I had been taught (see Minchat Shai and Radak at the above link).</li>\n<li>I asked a didkduk expert, who told me that it's a Machlokes.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Now, I'm quite the dikduk novice, so please help me with this - who disagrees, and on what basis? Please give as much background as possible...</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hint: I see it is mentioned <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/31576/16354\">here</a> backhandedly, although not with much detail.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit in honor of Rosh Chodesh Adar: To summarize my post with a quote from Megillat Esther (5:13): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ו\"כל\" זה איננו שוה לי </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Newer editions of the Koren Tanach also mark kamatz katan, and they agree with the siddur and mark this one as kamatz katan as well.  Here's what they have to say about it in the back:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>באותו אופן הבדלנו בין הקמץ הרגיל לקמץ הקטן באמצעות סימן גדול לקמץ הקטן, למשל, חכמה.  כידוע, ישנו הבדל בין מסורת הקריאה הספרדית לאופן הקריאה שהמליצה עליו האקדמיה.  כל הקמצים שבהם ישנה מחלוקת, מסומנים בטעמי המקרא באמצעות געיה.  משום כך, סימנו אותם כקמצים קטנים בהתאם להוראות האקדמיה.  המקפידים על המסורה הספרדית, יקראו כל קמץ שיש בו געיה כקמץ רחב.  (להרחבה ראו במאמר על שיטת הניקוד המופיע באתר ההוצאה, במדור \"אותות\".) ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly we distinguished between a regular kamatz and a kamatz katan by using a bigger symbol for a kamatz katan, (example).  As is known, there's a difference between the Sefaradi tradition and the recommendation of the <a href=\"https://hebrew-academy.org.il/2010/03/24/%D7%A6%D6%B8%D7%94%D6%B3%D7%A8%D6%B7%D7%99%D6%B4%D7%9D-%D7%A0%D6%B8%D7%A2%D6%B3%D7%9E%D6%B4%D7%99-%D7%94%D7%92%D7%99%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%A7%D7%9E%D7%A5-%D7%9C%D7%A4%D7%A0%D7%99-%D7%97%D7%98/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Academy of the Hebrew Language</a>.  All of the kamatzim that fall under this disagreement have a gaya.  Therefore, we marked them as kamatzim ketanim following the Academy's recommendation.  Those who follow the Sefaradi tradition should read any kamatz with a gaya as a kamatz rachav.  (For more information see an <a href=\"https://www.korenpub.com/media/productattachments/files/f/i/file_11.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article on our website</a> [thanks to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/14850/joel-k\">Joel K</a> for finding it!].)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The relevant part of the article is the bottom of page 3 - top of page 4.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כלל ידוע הוא, כי אות קמוצה שיש תחתיה געיה נקראת בקמץ רחב. וכן כתב ר׳ אליהו בן אשר הלוי\n  אשכנזי (הבחור): ״כל קמץ שאחריו שוא נח נקרא קמץ חטוף כמו ח ָ כְ מ ָ ה, זָ כְ ר ָ ה לי אלדי (נחמיה ה,\n  יט). ויהיה לך סימן כשאין מאריך אצל הקמץ. אבל זָ ֽ כְ ר ָ ה ירושלם (איכה א, ז) השוא הוא נע כי יש\n  מאריך אצל הקמץ״. יש בסידור תיבות אחדות שבהן כלל זה דורש עיון: במזמור שיר חנוכת הבית\n  (תהלים ל, ד) ִמּיְרִדי־בוֹר, בברכת השיר (נשמת כל חי) בפסוק (תהילים לה, י) ָּ֥כל ַע ְצמַֹתי תאמרנה,\n  ובמכתם לדוד הנאמר בבית האבל (תהלים טז, א) ָׁ ֽש ְמֵ֥רִני אל. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>נראה שבעלי המסורה לא כיוונו במקומות אלו להנעת השווא. הגעיה של ״מירדי בור״ מסמנת\n  שהטעם במילה ״מירדי״ נסוג אחור, ולפי כללי הטעמים המילה ״כל״ נחשבת כמוקפת למילה\n  ״עצמותי״, אף שהמקף לא נכתב. לדעת חוקרי המסורה, הגעיה שב״שמרני אל״ תכליתה מוזיקלית\n  ולא הנעת השווא (׳געיה כבדה׳). משום כך נהגנו בהם כדעתו של ר׳ מנחם די לונזאנו, שבכלל\n  דבריו — דברינו, שיש לקרוא בפסוקים אלו קמץ קטן. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>It's a known rule that a letter with a kamatz and a gaya is read with a kamatz rachav.  And similar R' Eliyahu Ben Asher Halevi Ashkenazi \"Any kamatz that has a sheva nach after it is read as a kamatz katan, and you know that's the case when there's no gaya next to the kamatz, for example חכמה, זכרה-לי אלהי.  But in זכרה ירושלים there's a gaya next to the kamatz so it's a sheva na.\"  There are a few cases in the siddur where this general rule needs further explanation.  For example מירדי בור, כל עצמותי, שמרני אל.</p>\n  \n  <p>It seems that the mesorah here doesn't mean that the sheva is a sheva na.  In the case of מירדי-בור it indicates that the word is nasog achor.  The rules of trop indicate that כל is connected to עצמותי, even though the makaf isn't written.  According to masoretic scholars, the gaya in שמרני אל is musical and doesn't indicate a sheva na, and is known as a gaya keveidah.  Therefore we've treated them following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menahem_Lonzano\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Menachem de Lunzano</a>, whose opinion includes our recommendation that these words should be read with a kamatz katan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that both כל עצמותי and the similar pasuk in Mishlei, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.19.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">כל אחי-רש</a> have a mercha on כל serving an azla legarmeih on the עצמותי/אחי-רש, which is unusual.  The normal case is to have a mahpach there instead.  Another example is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.14.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 14:5</a> (found with the help of the introduction to Daat Mikra Tehillim).  The word with the mercha there is אם, also a small word.  <a href=\"http://sefaria.org/tehillim.47.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 47:5</a>, mentioned by Double AA in the comments to the question, seems to be another example, this time involving a mercha followed by a regular azla.  As far as I understand this is what they mean about an \"unwritten makaf\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Being that others seem opposed to posting this for some reason, I wanted to make one more simple note about this Machlokes which answers the question:</p>\n\n<p>In footnote 26 of <a href=\"https://www.korenpub.com/media/productattachments/files/f/i/file_11.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Koren article linked above</a>, it records Di Lonzano's back and forth with Minchat Shai about this question.  Di Lonzano suggests that a reason for the reading of \"Kal\" here would be that the nikkud should actually be a Patach, and that the word does not mean \"all\" (which in his opinion would be read as a Kamatz Katan), but rather comes from the Shoresh of <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Dictionary/3615\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kilah/Kalah</a>, or completing/finishing (similar to \"Tzav Et Benei Yisrael\", which comes from the root of Tzivah).</p>\n\n<p>(This would be similar to וכל בשליש עפר הארץ, which also does not mean \"all\", as per <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Yeshayahu/40.12#e1n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">all of the mefarshim there</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus, it is possible that the original Machlokes came from the understanding of the meaning of the words in each of these exceptional contexts.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See my answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/145858/\">here</a>. This debate stems from the same linguistic development.</p>\n<p>The word כל was originally pronounced /kull/. By the pre-Masoretic era, this was /kul/, with a non-doubled final consonant.<br/>\nIn the tradition of Hebrew preceding the Palestinian and Tiberian Masoretic traditions, short unstressed /u/ evolved into short /o/. Thus, /kul/ became /kol/.</p>\n<p>In the early Tiberian tradition, short /o/ became short /ɔ/, transcribed as Kamatz Katan. So /kol/, now pronounced /kɔl/, was vocalized as כָּל.<br/>\nBy the later stages of the Tiberian tradition, the cantillation tradition was extremely developed, with long detailed tunes, and complex prosody across clauses. This strict prosody resulted in the lengthening of certain vowels in some verses. One example of such lengthening is the word כל in Tehillim 35:10, where the /ɔ/ was lengthened (/ɔː/); ergo, /kɔːl/.</p>\n<p>Another thing that occurred in Tiberian Hebrew was a shift of long /aː/ to long /ɔː/, written as Kamatz Gadol.</p>\n<p>Contemporary with this pronunciation tradition was another one, called the Palestinian Masoretic tradition. It had a five vowel system, and lost phonemic length distinctions. Importantly, <em>none of the aforementioned Tiberian shifts occurred in the Palestinian Masoretic tradition</em>. /aː/ didn’t shift to /ɔː/ (but it <em>did</em> lose phonemic length and merge with /a/), and /o/ didn’t shift to /ɔ/.</p>\n<p>When the Tiberian system of vocalization became mainstream, users of the Palestinian tradition noticed that Tiberian Kamatz Gadol usually corresponded to their /a/, while Kamatz Katan usually corresponded to their /o/. When they came upon this word in Tehillim, nobody knew the linguistic history described herein, and made the very reasonable assumption that this Kamatz Gadol, like the others, corresponded to Palestinian /a/; ergo, /kal/.</p>\n<p>In other words, it was a hypercorrection meant to “fix” the Palestinian pronunciation tradition, bringing it into line with the prestige, increasingly-standard Tiberian vocalization.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Let’s go to the present day.</p>\n<p>Sephardim (that is, Iberian Jews) use the Palestinian five-vowel system. They also preserve this ancient hypercorrection of the Palestinian Masoretes, likely due to the sole and uncontested influence of the written Tiberian vocalization, which has this as a Kamatz Gadol. So Sephardim hold that this is pronounced /kal/.</p>\n<p>Mizraħim in Arabic countries use a modified version of the Palestinian vowel system; but far from losing vowel length, these Mizraħim have restored it to phonemicity. They too inherit the hypercorrection; but because of the restored vowel length, they consistently pronounce the vowel long, ergo /kaːl/.</p>\n<p>Ashkenazi vowel systems originate from the Tiberian one¹, where both versions of Kamatz had the same quality. However, every Ashkenazi pronunciation has completely lost vowel length, which was the only thing differentiating the two variants of Kamatz in the Tiberian tradition. This leaves Kamatz Kattan and Kamatz Gadol completely identical. Those who use these pronunciations have no such issue—they would pronounce the Kamatz the same regardless of whether it has a גַעְיָה or not, as it does here.</p>\n<p>So all said, <strong>here are the answers</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s a debate <em>between Ashkenazim and others²</em>.</li>\n<li>The debate <em>originated from historical changes in Hebrew pronunciation</em>.</li>\n<li>Until very recently, neither side was aware of this linguistic history; so really, in their minds, the debate was <em>based on differing oral traditions</em>.</li>\n<li>Historically, both are entirely incorrect; but <em>halachically, both are acceptable</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If users of the late Palestinian tradition knew of the history behind this word, then Sephardim (and most Mizrahim, who use a modified version of the Palestinian tradition with revived vowel length distinctions) would likely have pronounced it with a lengthened Kamatz Kattan (which for them is identical to a Cholam), as /koːl/; but by now, the pronunciation with a Kamatz Gadol is standardized. (As noted in the linked answer, a few Mizrahim indeed have a tradition to pronounce this like Cholam; but they are a minority.)</p>\n<p>¹<sub>Technically, the first Ashkenazim used the Palestinian vowel system; but very early on, the Tiberian system had tremendous influence on them, such that eventually, their vowels didn’t resemble the Palestinian system in any significant way. The only remnants were 1) the pronunciation of Shva as /e/ in many communities, and 2) an arbitrary difference between Kamatz Gadol and Kamatz Kattan in very few communities. The rest of the paragraph doesn’t apply to those communities who fall under #2, nor to those influenced by them in this regard.</sub></p>\n<p>²<sub>Several variants of the Yemenite pronunciation pronounce Kamatz the same as the Tiberian Masoretes; that is, Kamatz Gadol as /ɔː/, and Kamatz Kattan as /ɔ/. These Yemenite varieties hold that this is a Kamatz Gadol, but because they simply <em>preserve</em> the intended pronunciation of this Kamatz, they are not involved in the debate (and in this regard, are the most historically correct).</sub></p>\n\n\n",

There is also a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/97155/1713\">prohibition against wearing tefillin after sunset</a> on any day. In congregations where mincha and maariv are prayed together, everybody removes their tefillin after mincha before sunset.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, everybody also removes their tallis before maariv of motzei Tisha B'av, despite the fact that there is clearly no prohibition to wear a tallis in the evening. The tallis gadol is worn for maariv on Yom Kippur and, in my experience, most people also leave it on after ne'ila and through maariv of motzei Yom Kippur. Furthermore, the general practice is not to remove the tallis katan in the evening on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>So why is the common practice to remove the tallis gadol for maariv after Tisha B'av?

Is there some other reason why the tallis should be removed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I've learned that wearing a tallis at night should not be done and the Mishna Berura discusses it (I think around <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.18.1?lang=bi&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.18.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berura 18:4</a>, although I cannot confirm off hand).

But there were also theological problems with the second paragraph: It affirms that God rewards the observance of the mitzvot through rainfall in its proper season, and punishes violations through drought.</strong> To the modern scientific mind, this seemed rather primitive and gross, both as an account of the weather and as an understanding of divine providence. [...] In more radical Reform circles, the third paragraph, (or minimally, its first part, dealing with the mitzvah of tzitzit ), <strong>was deemed expendable because the tallit, as distinctively Jewish, non-western prayer garb, was also deemed expendable</strong>. Also, the passage describes the function of the tzitzit as reminders to perform God's mitzvot---but many of these, too (particularly the ritual ones), were deemed archaic and dispensable in the modern world. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Rabbi Eliot Stevens writes more about early Reform <em>siddurim</em> in the last article on <a href=\"https://www.ccarpress.org/content.asp?tid=505\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this page</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>From the mid-19th century, the Reform movement largely rejected the obligations of \"ritual\" <em>mitzvot</em> (while adhering to ethical ones).  If you reject <em>mitzvot</em> then you pretty much have to reject the torah's views of reward and punishment.  And the Enlightenment movement drove a desire to \"pass\", to blend in and not be distinctive, including through clothing.</p>\n\n<p>Leaders of the movement now seem to understand that they went too far.  Early drafts of Mishkan T'filah included both the second and third paragraphs (my <em>minyan</em> was part of a pilot study).  There was fierce debate among both lay people and rabbis at the time.  In the end, the third paragraph was kept but the second was removed.  R' Sarason writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nonetheless, the verses describing an angry God \"sealing up the heavens\" were printed in smaller type [in the pilot version], indicating the theological difficulties with this image. The paragraph ultimately remained sufficiently problematic to require both a recommendation from the Siddur Editorial Committee and a vote by the CCAR Executive Committee. Both decided to uphold the earlier Reform deletion of the paragraph in its entirety: even though subject to mitigating non-literalist interpretations, the text itself remains difficult for a modern Jew to recite in the liturgy. The third paragraph, on the other hand, has been restored as an option, since many Reform Jews have embraced the tallit as distinctively Jewish prayer garb; viewing the tzitzit while praying can usefully remind us of our religious obligations. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The 2 opinions who prohibit cheese fried with meat are the Creisi upleisi and the Pri Chodosh, but the Chavos Daas says that this opinion is unfound and we rely on the Rishonim who say frying cheese with meat is prohibbitted only <em>Miderabannan</em>. <strong>So there seems to be no prohibition <em>mideoraisa</em> of <em>Basar Bechalav</em> for cheese fried with burger according to most opinions</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Also scientific research has been done to suggest that as little as <strong>12% content of the average burger is actual beef</strong>  (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18995204\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see here</a>). The Rambam Maacholos Assusros 14,4 that inflating a piece of meat with water which accounts on average 49% of the burger does not count towards the measurement:היה פחות מכזית מבתחלה ונתפח ועמד על כזית אסור ואין לוקין עליו:<br>\nThe Rambam  Maacholos Assuros 4,18-20, mentions bone, sinews hooves,stomache (these get mushed up in burgers) etc. are not <em>Chayav Min Hatorah</em> (though prohibited miderabanan when one eats them as food). </p>\n\n<p>Of course it is Forbidden <em>Min HaTorah</em> to eat even a small content of <em>Neveila</em> which has not been Shechted, but i think its safe to say that <strong>an untouched piece of pork contains significantly more non-Kosher Meat than the same size Hamburger, so eat the hamburger first in a life threatening situation.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Chances are that the beef is not kosher, in which case there are two issurim for the cheeseburger: eating neveila, and basur v'chalev, versus one issur of eating pork.</p>\n\n<p>There may be additional problems of \"kedoshim tihiyu\" or ma'arit ayin (assuming it is only a proverbial desert island) but I'm not sure societal norms make a difference between pork and cheeseburgers. My impression is that pork is slightly less acceptable in the western world, but only slightly less so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Eating pork is worse. We have no instances of God speaking of divine retribution for those who consume meat or dairy together, or even those that don't eat properly prepared/slaughtered meat from an acceptable animal.

A space of half a nail's breadth is left as a margin above and below the column. If the Pentateuchal sections were written in two or three columns, the Mezuzah is fit for use. They must not however be written in the shape of a tail (broad at the top line and gradually narrowing to a point), or of a circle, or of a tent (narrow at the top and broadening to the base). A Mezuzah written in any of these forms is unfit for use. If the text was written out of order, for example, if the second section was in front of the first, it is unfit for use. If it was written on two slips of parchment, even though these were sewn together, the Mezuzah is unfit for use. A Scroll of the Law that has become worn out or phylacteries that are worn out may not be used for a Mezuzah. Nor may margins cut off from a scroll of the Law be so used; for anything dedicated to a sacred purpose may not be degraded from a higher to a lower degree of sacredness.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that only these section on Mezuzah are to be written and nothing else as this essence of the argument between Korach and Moshe. </p>\n\n\n",

I think the comment was intended to suggest that ימות takes that form to match שנות. Indeed, they write that the standard plural forms יָמִים and יְמֵי were used (instead of *יוֹמִים and *יוֹמֵי) \"probably on the analogy of שָׁנים, שְׁנֵי\", and if that's the case, then matching forms of יוֹם by analogy to forms of שָׁנָה already has precedence.</p>\n<p>However, they also point out that the non-construct form שנת and ימת appear in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Siran_inscription#:%7E:text=The%20Tel%20Siran%20inscription%20is,in%20the%20%22Ammonite%20language%22.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tel Siran inscription</a> (see line 7), so there is potential for an independent plural form יָמוֹת and שָׁנוֹת that are simply unattested in Tanakh, but reflected in the construct forms we see here.</p>\n\n\n",

Lately, I asked some question on slavery and here's where those topics cross.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemmorah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.25a.4?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 24a</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Slaves.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Avadim 5, 4-5</a> count the organs which damage sets the Cananian slave free:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ד. \"כֵּיצַד בְּרָאשֵׁי אֵיבָרִים: הַמַּכֶּה אֶת עַבְדּוֹ בְּכַוָּנָה וְחָסְרוּ אֶחָד <strong>מֵעֶשְׂרִים וְאַרְבָּעָה רָאשֵׁי אֵיבָרִים</strong> שֶׁאֵינָן חוֹזְרִין יָצָא לְחֵרוּת\"...<br>\n  ה. \"...אֶצְבְּעוֹת יָדַיִם וְרַגְלַיִם עֶשְׂרִים רָאשֵׁי הָאָזְנַיִם וְרֹאשׁ הַחֹטֶם וְרֹאשׁ הַגְּוִיָּה וְרָאשֵׁי הַדָּדִין שֶׁבָּאִשָּׁה. אֲבָל הָעֵינַיִם וְהַשִּׁנַּיִם הֲרֵי הֵן מְפֹרָשִׁין בַּתּוֹרָה: </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When counting these 24 organs I noticed some controversies (<em>should I post each as a different question?</em>):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Mishnah in Ohalot (1:8) states that \"מָאתַיִם וְאַרְבָּעִים וּשְׁמֹנָה אֵבָרִים בָּאָדָם, שְׁלשִׁים בְּפִסַּת הָרֶגֶל, שִׁשָּׁה בְכָל אֶצְבַּע,\" - there are 6 limbs in each finger, but for the slave each finger counts as one - why?</p></li>\n<li><p>How come that this number - 24 limbs - <strong>excludes</strong> the organs mentioned in the Torah - the eyes and the teeth? The original Mishna in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Negaim.6.7?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Negayim 6,7</a> deals explicitly with \"ראשי אברים\" - limbs that \"protrude\", that's why it does not mention neither the eyes nor the teeth.</p></li>\n<li><p>The nose: while the fingers or the eyes are vital organs for slave's work, what about the nose? How can it be damaged - does it mean breaking the bone or losing the sense of smell?</p></li>\n<li><p>Rambam continues: \"אֲבָל הַמְסָרֵס עַבְדּוֹ בַּבֵּיצִים אוֹ הַחוֹתֵךְ לְשׁוֹנוֹ אֵינוֹ יוֹצֵא לְחֵרוּת שֶׁאֵינָן מוּמִין שֶׁבְּגָלוּי.\". So what can be said about רֹאשׁ הַגְּוִיָּה, isn't it a hidden part?</p></li>\n<li><p>The ears: Torah mentions hitting on the ear and making deaf, on the other hand, the Mishnah mentions ראשי אברים. What would happen if one cuts his slave's outer ear without impairing his hearing?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To answer at least your first three questions: Read the Rambam again, more carefully this time.</p>\n\n<p><em>1. How are the fingers counted?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֶצְבְּעוֹת יָדַיִם וְרַגְלַיִם עֶשְׂרִים</p>\n  \n  <p>Fingers of the hands and feet - twenty. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>i.e. each finger and toe counts as an independent “organ”. Yes, there are six “organs” in each finger, but it’s only the ones at the ends that set him free. </p>\n\n<p><em>2. Why aren’t the eyes and teeth included?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אִם כֵּן לָמָּה נֶאֱמַר בַּתּוֹרָה (שמות כא כז) \"שֵׁן\" וְ (שמות כא כו) \"עַיִן\" לִדּוֹן מֵהֶן מָה שֵׁן וְעַיִן מוּמִין שֶׁבְּגָלוּי וְאֵינָן חוֹזְרִין אַף כָּל מוּמִין שֶׁבְּגָלוּי וְאֵינָן חוֹזְרִין יֵצֵא הָעֶבֶד בּוֹ לְחֵרוּת.</p>\n  \n  <p>If so, why does the Torah say “tooth” and “eye”? To learn from them: just as the tooth and eye are external blemishes that do not return, so too all external blemishes that do not return - the slave goes out to freedom through it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The 24 limbs are the ones learned out from the teeth and eyes, so of course those aren’t included. In the words of the Kesef Mishnah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל העינים וכו'. כלומר ואין צריך למנותם: </p>\n  \n  <p>”But the eyes [and teeth are in the passuk],” that is to say, there’s no need to list them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course the slave goes free by his eye and tooth - these 24 “organs” are the novelty. </p>\n\n<p><em>3. How does the nose factor into this?</em></p>\n\n<p>First of all, where do you get vitality to work from? A slave can work just fine with one less tooth. The issue is only if it’s an external blemish, and if it won’t grow back. </p>\n\n<p>Putting that aside, the Rambam does <em>not</em> say that the slave goes free from losing his nose. His wording is the slave’s</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ראש החטם</p>\n  \n  <p>tip of the nose. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since it has to be an injury which can’t grow back, breaking his nose doesn’t set him free - nothing’s been dislodged permanently off of his face. Clearly he means that the master managed to tear the cartilage bit off of the tip of the slave’s nose. </p>\n\n\n",

So Rambam should have used the language of \"When the slave is sold less than 6 years before the Yovel\" because his price will surely go down accordingly, and not \"If Yovel intervenes\". Rambam sounds like \"if he was paid the full price but Yovel suddenly came, he breaks free\".</p>\n<p>\"How this Rambam's\"IF\" of \"<strong>the jubilee year intervention</strong>\" can be explained?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>שלשה דברים מעכבין ביובל (there are 3 things that, if not done, prevent the Yovel from taking effect), and one of them is Beis Din blowing the shofar (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=7603\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, Hilchos Shmittah Veyovel 10:13</a>, from Rosh Hashanah 9b).

In fact, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=110516&rid=7604\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnas Yaakov to Rambam ibid. 10:14</a> says as much, and also suggests that maybe this is why from Rosh Hashanah till Yom Kippur the slaves were in limbo, not working but not free either - because it would depend on whether Beis Din actually blows the shofar.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=110505&rid=7591\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">In his commentary ibid. 10:1</a> he also quotes R. Chaim Brisker that another factor is whether Beis Din counts the years; if they don't, the years they skipped don't count towards the Yovel cycle.

They would set the total price and it would be regarded as having been met once the period of slavery is over, no matter how long it would be.

Allow me to quote the entire passage, v. 1-7, in the original Hebrew:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ה֚וֹי הַשַּׁאֲנַנִּ֣ים בְּצִיּ֔וֹן וְהַבֹּטְחִ֖ים בְּהַ֣ר שֹׁמְר֑וֹן נְקֻבֵי֙ רֵאשִׁ֣ית הַגּוֹיִ֔ם וּבָ֥אוּ לָהֶ֖ם בֵּ֥ית יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃ עִבְר֤וּ כַֽלְנֵה֙ וּרְא֔וּ וּלְכ֥וּ מִשָּׁ֖ם חֲמַ֣ת רַבָּ֑ה וּרְד֣וּ גַת־פְּלִשְׁתּ֗ים הֲטוֹבִים֙ מִן־הַמַּמְלָכ֣וֹת הָאֵ֔לֶּה אִם־רַ֥ב גְּבוּלָ֖ם מִגְּבֻלְכֶֽם׃ הַֽמְנַדִּ֖ים לְי֣וֹם רָ֑ע וַתַּגִּישׁ֖וּן שֶׁ֥בֶת חָמָֽס׃ הַשֹּֽׁכְבִים֙ עַל־מִטּ֣וֹת שֵׁ֔ן וּסְרֻחִ֖ים עַל־עַרְשׂוֹתָ֑ם וְאֹכְלִ֤ים כָּרִים֙ מִצֹּ֔אן וַעֲגָלִ֖ים מִתּ֥וֹךְ מַרְבֵּֽק׃ הַפֹּרְטִ֖ים עַל־פִּ֣י הַנָּ֑בֶל כְּדָוִ֕יד חָשְׁב֥וּ לָהֶ֖ם כְּלֵי־שִֽׁיר׃ הַשֹּׁתִ֤ים בְּמִזְרְקֵי֙ יַ֔יִן וְרֵאשִׁ֥ית שְׁמָנִ֖ים יִמְשָׁ֑חוּ וְלֹ֥א נֶחְל֖וּ עַל־שֵׁ֥בֶר יוֹסֵֽף׃ לָכֵ֛ן עַתָּ֥ה יִגְל֖וּ בְּרֹ֣אשׁ גֹּלִ֑ים וְסָ֖ר מִרְזַ֥ח סְרוּחִֽים׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Ho, those who are at ease in Zion, and those who are confident on Mount Shomron, you notables of the head of the nations, that the House of Israel comes to them. Cross over Calneh and see, go from there to Greater Hamas, and go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than these kingdoms? Is your border larger than their border? You ward off a day of bad and convene in a session of lawlessness. They lie on ivory beds, lolling on their couches, feasting on lambs of the flock and cows of the stall. They hum snatches of the song, to the tune of the lute; they think themselves musicians like David. They drink from the wine bowl and anoint themselves with oil, but they are not concerned with the ruin of Joseph. Therefore, shortly they will be exiled at the head of the exiles; they shall no more loll at festive meals. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem with your understanding of the passage is that it’s point has nothing to do with abstinence. Joseph here (as it often does throughout the Prophets) is a placeholder for the Jewish people at large, particularly the northern Ten Tribes. They were sinning - in particular, the prophet here warns them about assimilation - and, rather than recognizing they were doing anything on, instead relaxed and rejoiced. We’re meant to be different, and we’re not supposed to be like all the nations, so why do these people assimilate? </p>\n\n<p>Targum Yonason translates the third clause in v. 1 as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מְקַיְמִין שׁוּם בְּנֵיהוֹן כְּשׁוּם בְּנֵי עַמְמַיָא וְכָל דְמִן דְיִסְתַּמְכוּן עֲלֵיהוֹן בֵּית יִשְׂרָאֵל:</p>\n  \n  <p>who set the names of their children like the names of the children of the nations</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And as Rashi comments on v. 2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עברו כלנה וראו. למה מאסתם בתורתי לדבק בחוקות עכו\"ם עברו וראו בעכו\"ם החשובים אם טובים הם מן הממלכות האלה שבשומרון ושבירושלים: </p>\n  \n  <p>Why have you rejected My Torah, to cling with the ways of the idolaters? Go and see in the notable idolatrous [nations] if they’re any better than these kingdoms in Shomron and Jerusalem. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All of these nations mentioned in v. 2 were the largest powers in their times, yet ultimately they too fell. Why do you seek to emulate them? Babylon (here named Calneh) came and went. Antioch (here named Hamas) came and went. Gath came and went. Yet we still stand. Why would you seek to join them?</p>\n\n<p>Yet you close your eyes to the truth and indulge in materialism. In v. 4 they stretch out on ivory beds - Rashi quotes our Sages that this is a euphemism for wife-swapping, a Biblical prohibition (Deuteronomy 24:4). In v. 5 they proclaim that their song, sung for pure enjoyment, is on the level of David’s hymns, crafted for the sake of Heaven.</p>\n\n<p>So the issue at play here is <em>not</em> that they’re indulging in materialism. Whether that’s an issue or not depends entirely on the circumstances and is a topic that will have to wait for its own day. The problem with the people discussed in the Amos passage is not their indulgence in materialism, but their indulgence in actual sins - assimilation, which led to wife-swapping as well. </p>\n\n\n",

At the end of days, God will recompose one's\n  body, place within it one's immortal soul, and that person will stand\n  before God in judgement. The idea of a messianic age has a prominent\n  place in Jewish thought, and is incorporated as part of the end of\n  days. Jewish philosophers from medieval times to the present day have\n  emphasized the soul's immortality. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Medieval rabbinical views</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>While all classic rabbinic sources discuss the afterlife, the classic\n  Medieval scholars dispute the nature of existence in the \"End of Days\"\n  after the messianic period. While Maimonides describes an entirely\n  spiritual existence for souls, which he calls \"disembodied\n  intellects,\" Nahmanides discusses an intensely spiritual existence on\n  Earth, where spirituality and physicality are merged. Both agree that\n  life after death is as Maimonides describes the \"End of Days.\" This\n  existence entails an extremely heightened understanding of and\n  connection to the Divine Presence. This view is shared by all classic\n  rabbinic scholars.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>In contemporary Judaism</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Irving Greenberg</p>\n  \n  <p>Irving Greenberg, representing a Modern Orthodox viewpoint, describes\n  the afterlife as a central Jewish teaching, deriving from the belief\n  in reward and punishment. According to Greenberg, suffering Medieval\n  Jews emphasized the World to Come as a counterpoint to the\n  difficulties of this life, while early Jewish modernizers portrayed\n  Judaism as interested only in this world as a counterpoint to\n  \"otherworldly\" Christianity. Greenberg sees each of these views as\n  leading to an undesired extreme - overemphasizing the afterlife leads\n  to asceticism, while devaluing the afterlife deprives Jews of the\n  consolation of eternal life and justice - and calls for a synthesis,\n  in which Jews can work to perfect this world, while also recognizing\n  the immortality of the soul.</p>\n  \n  <p>Conservative Judaism both affirms belief in the world beyond (as\n  referenced in the Amidah and Maimonides' Thirteen Precepts of Faith)\n  while recognizing that human understanding is limited and we cannot\n  know exactly what the world beyond consists of. </p>\n  \n  <p>Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism affirm belief in the afterlife,\n  though they downplay the theological implications in favor of\n  emphasizing the importance of the \"here and now,\" as opposed to reward\n  and punishment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The quoted Wikipedia article says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the late Second Temple period, beliefs about the ultimate fate of\n  the individual were diverse. The Essenes believed in the immortality\n  of the soul, but the Pharisees and Sadducees, apparently, did\n  not.[37].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">“Pharisaic beliefs became the foundational, liturgical and ritualistic basis for Rabbinic Judaism.”</a>.  It is therefore surprising that the Wikipedia  article asserts that the  Pharisees did not believe in  the immortality of the soul. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artsci.uc.edu/content/dam/artsci/departments/judaic%20studies/Docs/dating_game.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> says that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the <strong>afterlife,</strong> the Pharisees believed that the evil would be\n  punished for their sins and the good be rewarded and so acted\n  accordingly. The Sadducees by contrast “dismissed the idea of a soul\n  living after death and punishment in the next world.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.near-death.com/reincarnation/history/judaism.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article too</a> points out Josephus held that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the Pharisees, the Jewish sect that founded rabbinic Judaism to which\n  Paul once belonged, believed in reincarnation. He writes that the\n  Pharisees believed the souls of evil men are punished after death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>whereas</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Sadducees rejected all Persian concepts such as resurrection,\n  angels, or spirits. The Sadducees did not emphasize life after death\n  at all …</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I conclude that the  Sadducees did not believe in the immortality of the soul while the  Pharisees did. </p>\n\n<p>So it seems that most Jewish denominations believe in the afterlife; the Sadducees did not believe in the afterlife.</p>\n\n\n",

(see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.5b.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Succah 6a</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היה לבוש כליו וסנדליו ברגליו וטבעותיו באצבעותיו הוא טמא מיד והן טהורים עד שישהה <strong>בכדי אכילת פרס</strong></p>\n<p>If he was dressed in his clothes, and his sandals were on his feet, and his rings were on his fingers, he immediately becomes ritually impure, but they, the clothes, sandals, and rings, remain pure until he stays in the house <strong>long enough to eat half a loaf of bread</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus while a house with leprosy may not be practical, nonetheless the halachos learned for it are very much so-  <strong>and presumably a Ben Sorer U'Moreh & an idolatrous city also have practical halachot/ concepts that are learned out from them.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I have seen a few responses:</p>\n<p>Rav Tzadok HaKohen of Lublin notes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Dover_Tzedek%2C_Miscellany.4.51?vhe=hebrew%7CR%27_Zadok_--_Dover_Tzedek&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dover Tzedek</a> in the case of a ben soreh umorer (and similar) that the Gemara is coming to show us that the Torah’s punishment procedure (stoning him to death for his wayward ways etc.) never actually took place, because the criteria (age window, identical parental voices, exact warnings, exact behaviour patterns, etc.) are so strict they never aligned.</p>\n<p>However, the moral reality of a rebellious child certainly exists, which is why the Torah addresses it — to warn us, to give mussar (ethical instruction), and to show the danger of such a path:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי אין לך איסור אחד מאיסורי תורה או רז\"ל שלא יהיה נמצא אדם בכל הדורות שעבר עליו. כי השם יתברך צופה מראשית אחרית ואם לא יעבור עליו אדם לא היה מזהירו. ומאן דאמר בסנהדרין (ע\"א את עצמו) בן סורר ומורה ועיר הנדחת לא היו ולא נבראו אידחי מהלכה, וגם לפי דעתו היינו לענין משפט העונש שבתורה יש תנאים ידועים שאין מצוים. לא על גופה של עבירה.</p>\n<p>For there is not a single prohibition among the prohibitions of the Torah or of our Sages over which there has not been a person in every generation who transgressed it. For Hashem sees from the beginning to the end; and if no person would ever transgress it, He would not have warned against it. And as for the opinion stated in Sanhedrin (71a) that “the wayward and rebellious son and the condemned city never were and never came into being” - [those laws] are set aside only with respect to their practical halakhah. And even according to that view, this is only with regard to the judicial punishment of the Torah, for which there are specific conditions that are not commonly found — but not with regard to the essence of the transgression itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alternatively, note <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Devarim.21.21.3?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbeinu_Bachya_%5Bben_Asher%5D._Warsaw,_1878&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachya on Devarim 21:21</a> who comments that it was to foster a supreme obligation to love Hashem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וא\"כ יש לשאול מפני מה הוצרכה תורה להודיע ולכתוב מה שלא היה ומה שאין ענינו נוהג בדרך העולם, אבל זה היה מחכמת התורה ללמד דעת את העם בגודל חיוב אהבת הש\"י, שהרי אין לך אהבה חזקה בעולם כאהבת האב והאם לבן, וכיון שהבן עובר על מצות השם יתעלה, וזה דרכו כסל לו, חייבין הם שתגבר עליהם אהבת הש\"י על אהבת הבן עד שיצטרכו להביא אותו הם בעצמן לב\"ד לסקילה</p>\n<p>If so, one may ask: why did the Torah need to inform and write about something that never occurred and whose matter does not follow the normal way of the world? Rather, this was from the wisdom of the Torah: to teach the people knowledge of the greatness of the obligation to love Hashem. For there is no love in the world as strong as the love of a father and mother for their son. Yet when the son transgresses the commandments of the Exalted One, and this is his chosen path of folly, they are obligated that their love for the Blessed Name overpower their love for their son, to the point that they themselves must bring him to the court for stoning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Yissocher Frand <a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/ravfrand-5767-kiseitzei/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> says that we mention it to teach us that learning the word of God is worthwhile in and of itself — not only for its results, but because Torah study itself is a sacred end i.e. Torah Lishmah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yisrael Salanter (in the Sefer Or Yisrael) wonders about the meaning of this statement. After all, he argues, is the Torah not big enough without this set of laws to provide enough material to learn, expound upon, and gain the reward of Torah study? Rav Yisrael says that a person could live for 1000 years and still not exhaust the potential for deriving reward from Torah study — even excluding the four pasukim in Parshas Ki Seitzei and the 7 folios in tractate Sanhedrin dealing with the Wayward and Rebellious son.</p>\n<p>He therefore concludes that the chapter of Ben Sorer U’Moreh indeed teaches us a unique and profound lesson: Learning for learning’s sake alone, without any application to the “real world” whatsoever, is worthwhile in and of itself. Certainly, the purpose of learning is to bring one to action and there is value in being “results oriented”. However Reb Yisrael teaches us that we should not think that the whole point of learning is to know “what to do”. Even if something will never be practically relevant, there is still value in just learning the Word of G-d.</p>\n<p>There are other esoteric areas of Halacha that may not be relevant in our time and that may, most likely, not be relevant in any time, for the overwhelming number of people. However, all other areas of Torah are at least at some time theoretically relevant. But the Torah found it necessary to give at least one Halacha where one could be absolutely sure that it would never be relevant. No one will ever tell an Orthodox Rabbi “I have a ben Sorer U’Moreh shaylah (query) for you!” It will never happen!</p>\n<p><strong>The point the Torah is trying to make is: Learn it anyway. The lesson to be derived is the lesson of Torah learning. The intrinsic purpose of Torah learning is to study the word of G-d. Its benefit is not dependent on practical application.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This was recognized by the Sages in the\n  Gemara, Yerushalmi Rosh Hashana 1:2. </p>\n  \n  <p>Why the Jews adopted these Babylonian names is a good question. In\n  fact, it seems like the Jews did have their own ancient names for the\n  months, such as 'Ziv' and 'Bul', which are mentioned in Kings I\n  6:37-38, but weren't used by the time of destruction. </p>\n  \n  <p>1.Ramban (Shemos 12:2) says that we adopted the Babylonian/Persian names as commemoration of the fact that God took us out of those\n  countries (and brought about a smaller redemption from those exiles\n  with the building of the Second Temple). This is parallel to the\n  command regarding the new month and setting up of the calendar that\n  came about with the redemption from the Egyption exile (see there, in\n  Shemos/Exodus ch. 12). This reason (in slightly different forms) is\n  also given by Rabbeinu Bachya and the Abarbanel in their commentaries\n  there, as well as by R. Yosef Albo in Sefer HaIkarim 3:16.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, the Babylonians had twelve names.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the idea of adding the extra month is older than the Babylonian era, anyway, and all the months were numbered.</p>\n\n<p>In a sense, the numbering system is \"easier\" to understand than the way we have it now when we have the same month name used twice.</p>\n\n<p>You should also view <a href=\"http://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/64808/5275\">this answer</a> as it suggests a different analysis, namely that during a leap year Adar is one \"long\" month lasting 60 days.</p>\n\n<p>I would also suggest that since Adar II is the \"real\" Adar and the extra month is Adar I, perhaps if we gave it a new name we should call Adar I \"pre-Adar\" or \"predar\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>In short, The problem is that we ran out of YHWH combinations for the new month and this is true REASON.</p>\n\n<p>Every month stems from one of <a href=\"http://chabadpedia.co.il/index.php/%D7%94%D7%95%D7%99%22%D7%94_(%D7%A9%D7%9D)#.D7.99.22.D7.91_.D7.A6.D7.99.D7.A8.D7.95.D7.A4.D7.99_.D7.94.D7.95.D7.99.22.D7.94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the combinations of G-d's name</a> (that's printed in Musaf for R\"H) - has השפעות that come from a particular combination: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4hMui.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4hMui.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>G-d's name - YHWH has only 3 letters י+ה+ו in 4 positions with two ה interchangeable. That gives only 12 possible combinations. Each month represents a combination.</p>\n\n<p>Any additional month has to have a unique combination of the name like having its own personality and there are none left. That's why we're stuck with that boring Adar II.</p>\n\n<p>That's why we have 12 in daily hours also. And this is also represented well in Astrology and more.</p>\n\n\n",

Yechiel Michel Epstein</a>'s explanation for rejecting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_ben_Aaron\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yaakov of Karlin</a>'s suggestion that the times for <em>Shema</em> are not based on <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_hour_(Jewish_law)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sha'ot zemaniot</a></em>. In truth, however, I don't really see how his explanation addresses the issues. Here is the quote reproduced:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מיהו יש בזה שאלה דנהי דודאי לכל דיני התורה כן הוא מ\"מ לענין ק\"ש דכתיב בה ובשכבך ובקומך הלא השכיבה והקימה לא ישתנו בהתארך היום או יתקצר כלומר כשהיום והלילה שוים הוי זמן ק\"ש עד אחר שעה תשיעית דהם ג' שעות על היום משום דבני מלכים ישנים עד ג' שעות וא\"כ אטו בתקופת תמוז שרביע היום הוא בחצי שעה שמינית יקומו אז הבני מלכים הרי הם ישינים עד אחר שעה התשיעית וא\"כ ליהוי זמן ק\"ש תמיד עד אחר שעה תשיעית שהרי קרינן אז ובקומך וראיתי לאחד מן הגדולים שעלה על דעתו לומר כן [משכנות יעקב סי' ע\"ו וכתב אלולי דמסתפינא ע\"ש] אמנם באמת אין זה שאלה כלל ודיני התורה לא ישתנו לעולם כלומר לראות לפי מנהג המקום והדברים התלוים ביום ובלילה צותה לנו התורה שכל אחד במקום שהוא כשאצלו יום ינהוג דיני יום אף שבמקום אחר הוי לילה וכשאצלו לילה ינהוג דיני לילה אף שבמקום אחר עדיין יום ועל זה נאמר שבת היא לה' בכל משבתיכם כלומר תקבלו השבת בכל מקום שאתם יושבים שכשבמקומכם יום הששי הגיע הלילה אצליכם שבת אף שבמקום אחר עדיין הוא יום ששי ולהיפך בשבת בערב כשהוא לילה אצליכם חול אף שבמקום אחר עדיין הוא שבת וכן גבי ק\"ש שהתורה אמרה ובשכבך ובקומך אינו תלוי בכל אדם מתי שישכב ומתי שיקום אלא זמן שכיבה לרוב העולם וזמן קימה לרוב העולם ושיערו חז\"ל שבזמן הנץ רוב העולם קמים ממטתם ויש שקמים מעמוד השחר ובני מלכים ישנים עד ג' שעות שהוא רביעית היום ואין משגיחים על מה שיש כמה ערים שבנץ החמה עדיין כולן ישינים וכיוצא בזה ולפ\"ז הוי כאלו התורה אמרה שבנץ החמה תקרא ק\"ש ועד רביע היום הוה זמן ק\"ש ואז ממילא דבכל מקום ומקום לפי מה שעומד בכדור הארץ כששם תנץ החמה הוה זמן ק\"ש וכששם יעבור רביע היום עברה זמן ק\"ש כמו בשבת ולא משגחינן אם שם כבר עמדו או עדיין ישנים דלא לפי מנהג בני אדם ניתנה התורה אלא גזירה היא כך וכך תעשה ביום ובלילה וממילא שכל אחד מתי שהוא אצלו יום הוה מצות היום עליו ובלילה מצות הלילה עליו</p>\n  \n  <p>However, there is a question with this: Granted that this is certainly true with regard to all the laws of the Torah, nevertheless regarding <em>Keriat Shema</em> where it is written \"when you lie down and when you get up\", the [times of] lying down and getting up don't change with the lengthening or shortening of the day. That is to say that when the day and night are equal [i.e. twelve hours each] the time for <em>Keriat Shema</em> would be until after 9:00 which is three hours into the day, for the children of kings sleep until three hours into the day. If so, during the summer when a quarter of the day is 8:30, do the sons of kings get up [at 8:30]? They still sleep until after 9:00! So the time for <em>Kerias Shema</em> should always be until after 9:00, because that is when it is called \"when you get up\". And I saw one of the great [rabbis] who thought to say this (Mishkenot Yaakov # 76, and he wrote \"if I was not afraid\", see there).</p>\n  \n  <p>However, in truth this is not a question at all, and the laws of the Torah never change, meaning, to look at the practice of the locale. For the things that are dependent on day and night the Torah commanded us that each individual — in the place where he is — when it is day for him he should observe the laws of day even though elsewhere it is night. And when it is night for him he should observe the laws of night even though elsewhere it is still day. And about this it was said \"it is Shabbat for God in all of your dwelling-places\", meaning that you should accept Shabbat in any place where you are dwelling such that when in your place on Friday the night arrives it is Shabbat for you even though elsewhere it is still Friday. And conversely on Saturday in the evening when it is night, for you it is non-Shabbat even though elsewhere it is still Shabbat.</p>\n  \n  <p>And so too by <em>Kerias Shema</em>, where the Torah said \"when you lie down and when you get up\", it is not dependent on when the individual person lies down and gets up. Rather, it is [based on] the time of lying down for the majority of the world, and the time of getting up for the majority of the world. And the Sages assessed that at the time of sunrise most of the world gets up from their beds, and there are some who get up at dawn, and the sons of kings sleep until three hours [into the day] which is a quarter of the day. And we don't care that there are many cities where everyone is still sleeping at sunrise, or the like.</p>\n  \n  <p>Accordingly, it is as if the Torah said that sunrise is when you should read <em>Shema</em>, and until a quarter of the day is the time for <em>Keriat Shema</em>. And then automatically, in each place depending on where it is located on the globe, when the sun rises there it is the time for <em>Keriat Shema</em>, and when a quarter of the day passes there the time for <em>Keriat Shema</em> passes, just like by Shabbat. And we don't care if there they already got up or are still sleeping because the Torah was not given according to the practice of the people; it is simply a decree [that] such-and-such you do by day or by night. And automatically whenever it is day for each individual the day <em>mitzvot</em> are upon him, and at night the night <em>mitzvot</em> are upon him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I don't understand is how any of this relates to <em>sha'ot zemaniot</em>. The suggestion was that since the Torah specified the time for <em>Shema</em> in terms of getting up from bed, the time for <em>Shema</em> should be fixed throughout the year since the sons of kings don't modify their sleeping habits based on how long the <em>sha'ot zemaniot</em> of a given day are. That doesn't seem to have anything to do with whether laws can change, or whether they can be different for different individuals. R. Yaakov of Karlin agrees that Shabbat is determined by when night begins in your locale. But that's because Shabbat is simply a day; whenever the day begins (starting with the night) Shabbat begins. Had the Torah said \"read <em>Shema</em> at night and by day\" then the times for <em>Shema</em> would also fluctuate over the year when the times for day and night fluctuate.</p>\n\n<p>So how exactly did R. Yechiel Michel Epstein refute R. Yaakov of Karlin's suggestion? Furthermore, R. Epstein argues that we only look at the majority and we don't care about the fact that other groups of people might be getting up later. But isn't this explicitly contradicted by the very Talmudic passage under discussion? The whole debate stems from the fact that the time for <em>Shema</em> ends when the sons of kings get up, because as long as there is a (significant) group of people not getting up it can still be called \"a time of getting up\". But surely the sons of princes do not constitute the majority of the population! In fact, he said himself that most of the world gets up at sunrise.</p>\n\n<p>How, then, did R. Epstein reach the conclusion that the time for <em>Shema</em> is always fixed as the time between sunrise and the end of the third solar hour, and it's as if the Torah said \"read <em>Shema</em> between sunrise and a quarter of the solar day\"? That doesn't seem to follow from what was said. If everyone would get up at noon, how would we know that the Torah meant sunrise?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If I understand the  משכנות יעקב  [in סי' ע\"ט] correctly, he writes that krias shema would depend on the time locals get up and go to sleep, and it is not dependent on the beginning of the day or the night. Therefore, he writes that places that have a short night, only the sleeping habits are taken into account. He then takes it a step further, and tries to explain why people say Shema after the proper time. Using this logic, it makes sense that the time should be the same throughout the year, as sleeping habit don't change.</p>\n\n<p>The ערוך השולחן is arguing on his starting point, and claims that בשכבך ובקומך are just a way to describe the beginning and the end of the day, and do not change based on the shortness of the night or local habits. The משכנות יעקב and the ערוך השולחן are not discussing how to determine שעות זמניות.</p>\n\n\n",

And the third category is Levites, when they were first sanctified for their service, as it is stated: “And this you shall do to them to cleanse them: Sprinkle the water of purification upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh” (Numbers 8:7). And with regard to all of them, if they shaved with an implement other than a razor, or if they left two hairs uncut, they have done nothing, i.e., they have not fulfilled their obligation.</p>\n\n<p>It appears that Leviyim  Nezarim and Lepers can use a razor but why can’t anyone other than these three use a razor? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The gemara you reported in Nazir 40a taught that Leviim, Nazir and Metsora have a mitsva to shave with a blade(1). This is a Mitsvat asse, the Mitsvat asse pushes out the mitsvat lo taasse, the prohibition of shaving beard with a blade for metsora and leviim who need to shave the beard and of shaving temporal scalp for the nazir who shave the scalp only. </p>\n\n<p>So, without a special mitva from Torah to shave with a blade, nobody, no leviim, no Metsora not at the time of shaving, no nazir not at the time of shaving can make what the mitsvat tiglachat orders.  </p>\n\n<p>(1):\nFor Leviim במדבר ח,ז</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְכֹֽה־תַעֲשֶׂ֤ה לָהֶם֙ לְטַֽהֲרָ֔ם הַזֵּ֥ה עֲלֵיהֶ֖ם מֵ֣י חַטָּ֑את וְהֶעֱבִ֤ירוּ תַ֙עַר֙ עַל־כׇּל־בְּשָׂרָ֔ם וְכִבְּס֥וּ בִגְדֵיהֶ֖ם וְהִטֶּהָֽרוּ׃‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For Nazir (see Nazir 39b), במדבר ו, ה </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כׇּל־יְמֵי֙ נֶ֣דֶר נִזְר֔וֹ תַּ֖עַר לֹא־יַעֲבֹ֣ר עַל־רֹאשׁ֑וֹ עַד־מְלֹ֨את הַיָּמִ֜ם אֲשֶׁר־יַזִּ֤יר לַיהֹוָה֙ קָדֹ֣שׁ יִהְיֶ֔ה גַּדֵּ֥ל פֶּ֖רַע שְׂעַ֥ר רֹאשֽׁוֹ׃ \n  ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This teaching is needs Gemara to be understand, below an extract of Gemara and Rivan's comment</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לפי שלא למדנו לתגלחת האחרונה [שיהיה בתער] - של טהרה לאחר תשלום ימי נזירות שיהא בתער לפי שלא כתב אלא וגילח את שער ראש נזרו לכך כתב לך תער כאן שאינו צריך ללמדך שאותה תגלחת לא תהא אלא בתער:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To teach that the prohibition of cutting hair for nazir with blade only is not right (se Gemara), so why the verse writes \"blade\", it is unnecessary? To teach that the finally cutting hair of the Nazir needs to be with a blade. </p>\n\n<p>Metsora is deducted from Nazir and Leviim. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# May a Jew drink a fruit drink that has less than 1/60 of grape juice?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are a number of manufactured fruit drinks that have trace amounts of grape juice that are less than 1/60 of the volume of ingredients. (A way to tell is when the product label states the percentage of grape juice.)</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/611/when-its-null-and-void-understanding-batel-bshishim-one-sixtieth/#_ftnref31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Star_K article</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Avoda Zara – An idol, or anything used in the service of idolatry\n  including wine,31 is not batel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But Note 31, there says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is known as yayin nesech.  For conditions and details, see Y.D.\n  134.  Note that the halachos of wine that is prepared or touched by an akum (stam yaynam) are different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, my question - Considering that the grapes are most likely pressed by machinery in the processing plant, it's doubtful that a Gentile has touched the grape juice at all. Would this, then be considered stam yaynam, or what? In short, can a Jew drink this juice product?</p>\n\n<p>Assuming that the grapes were pressed by non-Jews, can Jews use the product if the juice is less than 1/60 of the volume?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One should note that the bitul you are referring to can only take place if the grape juice (as in your example) was added <strong>accidentally</strong>. In the case that you mention, the grape juice was a deliberately added ingredient and any attempt to calculate bitul is invalid.</p>\n\n<p>As an example we see the Vaad of Denver <a href=\"https://scrollk.org/guide-to-kashrus-does-it-need-a-hechsher/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Does it need a hechsher</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Juices – Apple, cranberry, grapefruit, orange, and pineapple juices,\n  shelf stable requires reliable certification. Refrigerated, fresh or\n  from concentrate, does not require certification at the present time,\n  <strong>provided that they do not have any added questionable ingredients,\n  such as flavorings, colors, grape juice or glycerin.</strong> However, we\n  recommend that you purchase juices that do bear reliable\n  certification, since changes in ingredients or production procedures\n  can take place at any time. Grape, prune and tomato juices require\n  reliable certification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/category/bein-adam-lechaveiro/page/4/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Kaganoff</a>, for example, points out</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ein Mevatelin Issur Lechatchilah</p>\n  \n  <p>Although prohibited substances that spill into food are sometimes\n  nullified, this applies only when the mixture occurred\n  unintentionally. One may not deliberately add prohibited food to\n  permitted food in order to nullify the banned substance. This\n  prohibition is called ein mevatelin issur lechatchilah. Bitul is\n  something that happens after the fact and cannot serve as a\n  premeditated solution .</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Because of the above rule, if non-kosher food accidently fell into\n  food at a rate too great to be nullified, one may not add extra kosher\n  food or liquid in order to nullify the prohibited substance. This act\n  is also prohibited under the heading of ein mevatelin issur\n  lechatchilah. Here too, someone who knows that this act is prohibited\n  and intentionally added permitted food to nullify the forbidden\n  component, may not consume it because he violated ein mevatelin issur\n  lichatchilah (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 99:5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>If grape juice is indeed 1/60 of the mixed juice, the fruit juice is permitted. In our times, poskim consider only wine actually used for idol worship to be <em>yayin nesech</em>, the standard wine produced by akum for non-sacramental purposes is <em>stam yayin</em>, which is treated as a standard non-kosher  ingredient rather than one connected to Avodah Zarah. </p>\n\n<p>Ain Mevatlin is not an issue for commercial products made by gentiles for gentiles, from the same article you cited, \"However, if a gentile company adds a non-kosher ingredient and the non-kosher ingredient is batel, a kosher consumer may buy this product as there is no prohibition of “ain mevatlin” for the gentile.(  Darchei Teshuva 108:20. ) This is only true if it was not done explicitly for Yidden.\"</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in terms of distinctive taste, grape juice is not so strong tasting a juice that it would come through in the taste of a fruit juice mixture in which it was 1/60 of volume (unlike, say, Balsamic vinegar made with stam yayin). As such, the juice is certainly permitted.</p>\n\n\n",

(See the Basi Legani 5742 Maamar for more on this last point).</p>\n\n<p>So that's why there's no Hei, because it's referring to the soul in the essence of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hebrew slaves and Yovel - how does it starts and ends?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemmorah links the Hebrew slavery to the [idea of] Yovel (Gitin 65, Kidushin 69, Erchin 29, Rambam Avadim 1, 10):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"אין אמה העבריה נוהגת ולא עבד עברי נוהג אלא בזמן שהיובל נוהג.<br>\n  בין עבד עברי שמוכר עצמו בין זה שמכרוהו בית דין. \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yovel itself is the 50th year from the beginning of counting (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbatical_Year_and_the_Jubilee.10?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Yovel 10,2</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"ומאימתי התחילו למנות. מאחר ארבע עשרה שנה משנכנסו לארץ\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>The first question</strong> - did slavery start on the first year of the Yovel, when they decided on keeping Yovlot, or after the last year when they actually performed the Mitzvah of Yovel and counted it once?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Yovlot ended with the destruction of the first temple, which was on the 36th year of the cycle:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"שבעה עשר יובלים מנו ישראל משנכנסו לארץ ועד שיצאו. ושנה שיצאו בה שחרב הבית בראשונה מוצאי שביעית היתה ושנת שש ושלשים ביובל היתה.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>The second question</strong> - how exactly slavery ended relative to Yovlot? Was there a Rabbinical decree of cancelation of Yovlot? Once they left Israel on their way to Babylon?</p>\n\n<p><strong>The third question</strong> - what happened to the existing slaves - were they automatically freed or stayed forever?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In answer to your first question, the Torah had decreed a term of six years for anyone who became a slave. Thus if someone stole and became a slave or became that impoverished in the first fifty years after the conquest, then the first yovel would have freed those who had become slaves during the previous six years. However, the whole point is that someone would not become a slave unless he had been forced off of his ancestral land. The yovel would return the land to him so he would no longer be poor enough to become a slave. I doubt that this loss of ancestral land would have occurred so soon.</p>\n\n<p>To answer your second question:</p>\n\n<p>Ever since the tribes of Reuven and Gad were exiled from their land. Rashi says on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15939#v=23&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshayahu 8:23</a>\nthat they were exiled in the twelfth year of Ahaz. Ahaz started his reign in the <a href=\"https://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2015/05/rabbi-leibtag-shiurim-hebrew-calendar.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">year 3190</a> Twelve years later would be 3202. The first temple was destroyed in the year 3338 one hundred twenty eight years after that exile.</p>\n\n<p>Your third question would be answered as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Theoretically, without a yovel, every slave would have to serve a full six year term. The torah explicitly decrees that no eved Ivri can serve more than six years. However, we learn that the people had kept slaves past the correct term as we see in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16031#v=8&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 34:8 - 11</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>after King Zedekiah had made a covenant: In the seventh year of his\n  reign. So we learned it in Seder Olam (ch. 26): “And it came to pass\n  in the seventh year… men came of the elders of Judah (sic) to inquire\n  of the Lord” (Ezekiel 20:1). They said to Ezekiel, ‘The slave of a\n  priest whom his owner sold what is the ruling regarding whether he may\n  eat of the priest’s due?’ That is to say, because they wanted to say\n  that they should not be punished for infracting the commandment by\n  returning the slaves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The pesukim then continue that the people then kidnapped their former slaves and re-enslaved them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That every man should let his manservant and every man his\n  maidservant, a Jew and a Jewess go free, that none should hold his\n  Jewish brother as a slave.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now all the princes and all the people who had entered into the\n  covenant hearkened that every one should let his manservant and\n  everyone his maidservant go free, no longer holding them in slavery;\n  then they obeyed and let them go.</p>\n  \n  <p>But afterwards they turned and brought back the manservants and the\n  maidservants whom they had let free, and forcibly made them into\n  manservants and maidservants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hashem then sent Yirmiyahu to castigate them in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16031#v=15&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 34:15 - 17</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And now this day you turned and did what was right in My sight by\n  proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor, and you made a covenant\n  before Me in the House upon which My Name is called.</p>\n  \n  <p>But then you turned and profaned My Name, and you took back, each man\n  his manservant and each man his maidservant, whom you had let free to\n  themselves, and forced them to be manservants and maidservants to you.</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, so says the Lord: You have not hearkened to Me to proclaim\n  freedom, every one to his brother and every one to his neighbor;\n  behold I proclaim freedom to you, says the Lord, to the sword, to the\n  pestilence, and to the famine, and I will make you an object of horror\n  to all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>behold I proclaim freedom to you: from Me, that I am not your master\n  to save you, and you shall be free to the sword and to the famine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once the temple was destroyed four years later, the Bnai Yisrael no longer had the power to enslave anyone and the institution of slavery ended.</p>\n\n\n",

The Midrash proves this from the words אלה אלוהיך ישראל, “these are your gods O Israel.” Had the makers of the golden calf been natural born Jews they would have chanted: “these are our gods O Israel, who have brought us out of Egypt.“ This episode prompted our sages in Yevamot 16 to say that the process of assimilating converts is as much of an affliction for Israel as being struck with a form of skin eczema called ספחת on raw flesh, a dread disease, (compare Leviticus 13,2). On the same subject of accepting converts Shemot Rabbah 42,6 has stated that the reason G’d told Moses: “go on down for your people have become corrupt, was that Moses had accepted these converts at face value without having first obtained G’d’s permission to convert them. G’d reminded Moses that He had specifically said to him (Exodus 7,4) “I shall take out My hosts, My people, the Children of Israel. He had never mentioned taking out people who were not “Children of Israel,” whereas Moses had taken it upon himself to accept the mixed multitude. G’d now made it plain that He did not consider these converts as “My people.” In spite of what the Midrash writes, the fact remains that though these converts originated the disaster, the natural born Jews joined in of their own accord. This is why all of them were punished.</p>\n\n\n",

When Rav Ashi dreamed of King Menashe, he  asked him: If you are so wise, why did you worship idols?  King Menasheh replied: If you had lived in my time, you would have done the same.  You would have lifted the hems of your robes to run behind me to worship idols also. [Sanhedrin 102b]</p>\n\n<p>Then, after the exile in Babylon, idolatry disappeared from Judaism, suddenly and completely, and has remained absent for the next 2,500 years, to this day.  What happened?</p>\n\n<p>My explanation: During the 1,000 years of idolatry, the Jews were essentially free and masters of their own house.  They felt they could indulge in whatever appealed to them, as free people do.  Those who found idolatrous rites colorful and attractive felt free to indulge in them.  But for the next 2,500 years, the Jews were subjugated and persecuted – by the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Christians, the Muslims, etc. They felt they HAD to keep their own traditions and not adopt any of the customs of their overlords, as an act of rebellion.  They were even willing to die rather than be forced to indulge in idolatry or reject their traditions.</p>\n\n<p>Here we have the evidence that antisemitism preserved Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>As for quotes, I found something by Maharsha in Artscroll: When a fruit or vegetable falls on the ground, it rots.  Yet the very ground which causes it to rot is the environment necessary for it to take root and grow and be reborn.  So it is with Israel in exile: Although many Jews will die, the very hostile environment of persecution will cause their spiritual rebirth.</p>\n\n\n",

Here it is, with the Davidson Edition translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורבנן ההוא לכנות לה שם דתניא ר\"א אומר מנין לעוקר עבודת כוכבים שצריך לשרש אחריה ת\"ל ואבדתם את שמם</p>\n<p>The Gemara asks: And what do the Rabbis derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: That verse teaches that it is a mitzva to give a derogatory nickname to an idol. As it is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Eliezer says: From where is it derived that when one deracinates an object of idol worship, he needs to root out all traces of it? The verse states: “And you shall destroy their name out of that place.”</p>\n<p>אמר לו ר\"ע והלא כבר נאמר (דברים יב, ב) אבד תאבדון אם כן מה ת\"ל ואבדתם את שמם מן המקום ההוא לכנות לה שם</p>\n<p>Rabbi Akiva said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “You shall destroy” (Deuteronomy 12:2)? This obviously includes rooting out all traces of idols. If so, what is the meaning when the verse states: “And you shall destroy their name out of that place”? This means that it is a mitzva to give it a nickname.</p>\n<p>יכול לשבח לשבח ס\"ד אלא יכול לא לשבח ולא לגנאי ת\"ל (דברים ז, כו) שקץ תשקצנו ותעב תתעבנו כי חרם הוא</p>\n<p>One might have thought that one may give it a positive nickname. The Gemara interjects: Would it enter your mind that one may give a positive nickname to an idol? Rather, the baraita means that one might have thought that the reference is to a nickname that is neither positive nor negative. Therefore, the verse states: “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, and be accursed like it; you shall detest it, and you shall abhor it; for it is a proscribed item” (Deuteronomy 7:26). This verse clearly indicates that the nickname should be a negative one.</p>\n<p>הא כיצד היו קורין אותה בית גליא קורין אותה בית כריא עין כל עין קוץ</p>\n<p>How so? To what type of nickname is this referring? If the idol worshippers would call their house of worship the house of elevation [beit galya], one should call it the house of digging [beit karya]. If they call it the all-seeing eye [ein kol], one should call it the eye of a thorn [ein kotz].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>This is essentially in response to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/99331/source-for-it-being-a-mitzvah-to-make-fun-of-avodah-zarah#comment331547_99332\">Ploni's comment above</a>, that the source given in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/99332/16354\">Daniel Ross' answer</a> only shows that it is permitted to mock Avodah Zarah, and not that it is a Mitzvah.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://daf-yomi.com/Data/UploadedFiles/DY_Item/5784-sFile.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">This article</a> cites the Minchas Elazar Telisa'ah 52 (I could not find this on Bar Ilan) as making the same comment - based on the Gemara, there is no indication that there is a Mitzvah to do so!</p>\n<p>However, the same Minchas Elazar is cited in Daf Al Hadaf to Megillah 25b, and it says that the conclusion must be that if the Nevi'im said this, there must have been a Mitzvah to do so, not simply permission, (and this is probably why so many people upvoted the answer, since it is intuitive).</p>\n<p>Another excellent point is the citation of Orchos Tzaddikim which notes that this will help deter people from worshiping Avodah Zarah, and therefore would be a mitzvah.</p>\n<p>However, the article (and others) note another possible halachic source for this entire discussion:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat 8:1</a> writes (Denburg translation, see notes there):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכל דיין המתמנה בשביל כסף או זהב אסור לעמוד לפניו ולא עוד <strong>אלא שמצוה להקל ולזלזל בו</strong></p>\n<p>And every Judge who gets appointed on account of silver or gold, — [the law is that] it is forbidden to rise before him; and what is more, <strong>it is a religious duty to treat him with disrespect and to despise him</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why is it a mitzvah to mock such a person?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.8.1?lang=bi&p2=Me%27irat_Einayim_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.8.5&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sema</a>, followed by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.8.1?lang=bi&p2=Urim_VeTumim%2C_Urim.8.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Urim</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.8.1?lang=bi&p2=Netivot_HaMishpat%2C_Hidushim_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.8.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nesivos</a>, <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=pm5iAAAAcAAJ&pg=PT11&lpg=PT11&dq=%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%94%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%9C%20%D7%91%D7%95%20%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%96%D7%9C%D7%96%D7%9C%D7%95&source=bl&ots=y6tvqzhqbn&sig=ACfU3U1CcfQJ8y2PRHL9BU3eUfWRl8rQMg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj9w9zy0KvgAhVKnFkKHQO9C7IQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%94%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%9C%20%D7%91%D7%95%20%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%96%D7%9C%D7%96%D7%9C%D7%95&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Levush</a>, <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh6/11/1/17.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Harav</a>, and others, note <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=NaM7DwAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PT139&lpg=RA1-PT139&dq=%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%20%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%20%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%9F&source=bl&ots=jCt6kiTYiQ&sig=ACfU3U3EEcs5tQFjFX1o26AqcebmBiJz9w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjpqJKg0avgAhWHjlkKHT8uCsUQ6AEwAHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%20%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%20%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%9F&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yerushlmi Bikkurim 3:3</a>, which writes (Denburg translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר' מנא מיקל לאילין דמתמניי בכסף. רבי אימי קרא עליהון [שמות כ כ] אלהי כסף ואלהי זהב לא תעשו לכם</p>\n<p>R.

Rabbi Yannai said: This principle that one is permitted to mock idol worship is derived from here: “The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in dread for the calves of Beth-aven; for its people shall mourn over it, and its priests shall tremble for it, for its glory, because it is departed from it” (Hosea 10:5). Do not read it is as “its glory [kevodo],” rather read it as its burden [keveido], meaning that it is unable to restrain itself from defecating.</p>\n<p>אמר רב הונא בר מנוח משמיה דרב אחא בריה דרב איקא שרי ליה לבר ישראל למימר ליה לעובד כוכבים שקליה לעבודת כוכבים ואנחיה בשין תיו שלו אמר רב אשי האי מאן דסנאי שומעניה שרי ליה לבזוייה בגימ\"ל ושי\"ן האי מאן דשפיר שומעניה שרי לשבוחיה ומאן דשבחיה ינוחו לו ברכות על ראשו:</p>\n<p>Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ said in the name of Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika: It is permitted for a Jew to say to a gentile: Take your idol and put it in your shin tav, i.e., shet, buttocks.

One whose reputation is commendable, it is permitted to publicly praise him, and one who praises him, blessings will rest upon his head.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it allowed to live in a place which has brazen Avodah Zarah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is a Jew allowed to live in a place which has brazen Avodah Zarah? I'm talking about places such as India, China and Cambodia. While Christians worship idols as well they say that doing so is wrong.</p>\n<p>I'm talking about living amongst people who not only worship idols but say that it is the right thing to do. What is the halacha on this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Practically yes you can live in a city where people practice <em>avoda zara</em>. But you have to follow to the end to know why.</p>\n<p>There is a relevant mishna in Avodah Zarah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Avodah_Zarah.1.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:4</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is permitted to be outside a city that contains avodah zarah. If\nthere is avodah zarah outside it, inside the city is permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Various halachic authorities disagree how to understand the mishna with Rashi, Raavad and the Shulchan Aruch ruling one can enter a city with idols when no idolatrous festival is being celebrated. The Rambam and the Schach disagree.</p>\n<p>R Yirmiyohu Kaganoff explains further (<a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/jews-and-idols/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n<p>The Mishnah implies that one may not be inside a city that \"contains avodah zarah.\" The question is: What is meant by the clause, a city that contains avodah zarah? This is the subject of a dispute among the early authorities. Most Rishonim (e.g., Rashi, Avodah Zarah 11b; Raavad, to Hilchos Avodah Zarah 9:9) explain that the Mishnah is prohibiting entering a city on a day that there is a big festival in honor of a deity. One may not visit the city that day, because people may think that he is entering the city in order to buy or sell from those observing a holiday. This is prohibited, because his financial dealing with the idolaters may cause them to thank their god for the commerce that was provided, which means that the Jew caused a gentile to worship idols. <strong>According to this approach, one may enter a city that contains idols when no festival is being celebrated.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>However, the Rambam understands the Mishnah differently, prohibiting entering any city that contains idols</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Avodah_Zarah.1.4?lang=bi&p2=Rambam_on_Mishnah_Avodah_Zarah.1.4.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Commentary to Mishna Avodah Zarah 1:4</a>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>You should be aware that it is prohibited to travel intentionally\nthrough any city in which there is a temple of avodah zarah, and it is\ncertainly prohibited to dwell in such a city.</strong> However, we are under\ntheir control and we live in their lands against our will… if this is\nthe law regarding the city, it is certainly so regarding the temple\nbuilding itself. It is almost prohibited for us to see it, and,\ncertainly, we may not enter it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam rules the same in his Mishneh Torah (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/912368/jewish/Avodat-Kochavim-Chapter-Nine.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Avodah Zarah 9:9</a>), <strong>stating that one may not enter a city that contains an idol</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.149.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh Deah 149:1</a>) rules according to the majority opinion, meaning that it is prohibited to enter a city containing a building intended for idol worship only on a day when there is a festival. The Shach, however, appears to disagree, quoting the Rambam’s opinion as normative halachah.</p>\n<p>R Binyamin Tabady told me though that, in the language of the Rambam and Shulchan Aruch, a city was a small settlement, unlike our modern cities. <strong>As such those who forbid entering a city mean a small place where everyone goes to perform <em>avoda zara</em> but not our modern cities.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Avodah Zarah tractate of the Talmud helps Yehudim with weak self-control (prone to disobedience), unfit to fulfill Yeshayahu 49:6.  - For Example : <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.27b.8?lang=bi&with=Daf%20Shevui&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 27b : 8</a></strong>\n\"The Gemara explains: Heresy is different, as it is enticing. In other words, it is prohibited to accept medical treatment from a heretic, as one might come to be drawn after his heresy. By contrast, receiving medical attention from a gentile is permitted if it is certain that one will die if he is not treated.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Confident Yehudim would recognize opportunities to fulfill Yeshayahu 49:6 by revealing Torah, while receiving bandages or even when receiving haircuts by Goyim.</strong></p>\n<p>Although <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.29a.9?lang=bi&with=Daf%20Shevui&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 29 a: 9</a></strong> states: \"The mishna teaches: And one may not have his hair cut by gentiles anywhere. The Sages taught in a baraita: A Jew who has his hair cut by a gentile should observe the gentile’s actions in a mirror while he cuts his hair. And in the case of a gentile who has his hair cut by a Jew, when the Jew reaches the gentile’s forelock he removes his hand and does not cut it, because it is associated with idol worship.\"</p>\n<p><strong>How could Yeshayahu 49:6 ever be fulfilled לְא֣וֹר גּוֹיִ֔ם if Yehudim recoil from living with Goyim (in fear of Avodah Zarah)? - Are Goyim not as equally enticed to learn Truth, as a Yehudim/Ivrim may be enticed to idolatry?</strong></p>\n<p>What was the point of G-d revealing His Edict in Yeshayahu 49:6, if Yehudim are predestined to cower from living kasher amongst goyim?</p>\n<blockquote>\"And He [G-d] said, \"It is too light for you to be My servant, to establish the tribes of Yaqov and to bring back the besieged of Yisrael, but I will make you a light of goyim, so that My salvation shall be until the end of the earth.\" (וַיֹּ֗אמֶר נָקֵ֨ל מִֽהְיֽוֹתְךָ֥ לִי֙ עֶ֔בֶד לְהָקִים֙ אֶת־שִׁבְטֵ֣י יַֽעֲקֹ֔ב וּנְצוּרֵ֥י (כתיב וּנְציּרֵ֥י) יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לְהָשִׁ֑יב וּנְתַתִּ֙יךָ֙ לְא֣וֹר גּוֹיִ֔ם לִֽהְי֥וֹת יְשֽׁוּעָתִ֖י עַד־קְצֵ֥ה הָאָֽרֶץ ) </blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>And you shall burn the city along with all its goods with fire\ndeut 13 :17</p>\n<p>Since it does not say not to pive there, the command is to burn it, not to avoid it. If you don't aproach the city how will you burn it? Logically a city is really big therefore you would have to live there for at least some time either way to burn it. G-d speed.</p>\n\n\n",

And we are not concerned that perhaps from seeing that the first one was pushed away from before him, [the second one] will glorify in his heart to say that there is no one like him, and he will become lax with the children because he will not be afraid that they will remove him. On the contrary, when he sees that they respect him he will certainly set his heart to teach well because he will worry about the jealousy of his fellow whom they removed from before him, that they will embarrass him among the townspeople.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechiel_Michel_Epstein\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yechiel Michel Epstein</a> also codifies this in Aruch Hashulchan (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14244&st=&pgnum=223\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Y.D. 245:18</a>) and like R.

And it seems that the same applies to the previous law, because [in that case as well] the second one is better than him. And there is someone who does not say this (see Pitchei Teshuvah <em>Seif Katan</em> 11), but he is incorrect. And know that this law is in the Talmud there, and this is what is there: \"Raba also said: If we have a teacher who gets on with the children and there is another who can get on better, we do not replace the first by the second, for fear that the second when appointed will become indolent.\" Meaning that he will glorify in his heart that there is no one like him, and he will become lax, etc. (Rashi s.v. <em>Dilma</em>) \"R. Dimi, however, held that he would exert himself still more if appointed: 'the jealousy of scribes increaseth wisdom.'\" And we hold like R. Dimi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is perhaps noteworthy that Rambam in his code seems to have left out this law (although R. Epstein above does cite Rambam along with the Tur and Shulchan Aruch). R. Joseph Karo notes this in his <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6220\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to the Tur</a>, and says he doesn't know why Rambam left it out:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא נתבארו דברים אלו בדברי הרמב\"ם ולא ידעתי למה</p>\n<p>And these matters are not explained in the words of Rambam, and I don't know why.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In any event, it seems that all the other major codes ruled in accordance with R. Dimi that we do replace a teacher when a better one comes along. In his compendium (Bava Batra  2:9) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_ben_Jehiel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Asher Ben Yechiel</a> explains that we follow R. Dimi in the next dispute mentioned in the Talmud  (partly) because of the general rule of following the view of the later Sage. Presumably this is why we follow him in this dispute as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והלכתה כרב דימי דבתראה הוא</p>\n<p>And the law follows R. Dimi because he is later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There I try to establish that Hashem doesn't judge actions, He judges the state of a person as they shape themselves through those actions. As I wrote (after opening with sources) there, \"Yishmael was repaid in terms of 'ba'asher hu sham -- as he was there.' The way your soul stands at that moment is the direct cause of reward or punishment.\"</p>\n<p>I think that's what the Rambam is saying here too. A person who sins once or twice... they made mistakes. A person for whom the sin became a habit, that's who they are.</p>\n<p>The Raavad (ad loc) in his objection to this Rambam, invokes the verse I did about how Hashem judged Yishmael \"as he was there\". He understands the Rambam as conflating two gemaros:</p>\n<p>1- Rosh Hashanah 16b-17a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תנא דבי רבי ישמעאל: \"מעביר ראשון ראשון\" -- וכן היא המדה. אמר רבא: ועון עצמו אינו נמחק, דאי איכא רובא עונות מחשיב בהדייהו.</p>\n<p>[A beraisa] was taught in school of Rabbi Yishmael: \"He passes over the first, first\" and so is the attribute [of Mercy, to forgive the first sin]. Rava said: But that sin itself is not ; if the person['s actions] are [still] mostly sins, G-d accounts for [the first sin too] for him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>2- Yuma 86b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא ר' יוסי בר יהודה אומר: אדם עובר עבירה פעם .ראשונה מוחלין לו. שניה מוחלין לו. שלישית מוחלין לו רביעית -- אין מוחלין לו. שנאמר, (עמוס ב:ו) \"כה אמר ה' על שלשה פשעי ישראל ועל ארבעה לא אשיבנו\" (ונאמר) (איוב לג:כט) \"הן כל אלה יפעל אל פעמים שלש עם גבר.\"</p>\n<p>It was taught [in a beraisa]: Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: When a person commits a transgression the first time, he is forgiven; a second time, he is forgiven; a third time, he is forgiven; but the fourth time, he is not forgiven, as it is stated: “So says Hashem: For three transgressions of Israel, but for four I will not reverse it” (Amos 2:6). And it says: “All these things does God do twice or three times with a man” (Iyov 33:29).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Raavad, these two gemaros refer to two different times of judgment. The gemara in Rosh haShanah is saying that when a person is judged at the end of life, Hashem will overlook an initial mistake, if it doesn't fit their general character; ie if after ignoring the initial errors, the person is overall not a sinful person. Whereas the gemara in Yuma is talking about during the course of life, and the person can still change their behavior. Then, it is not until the sin is habitual that G-d will address the sin.</p>\n<p>The Raavad's understanding of the Rambam's sources supports my theory that the Rambam's intent was to talk about which sins become \"of the person\" rather than a history of activity.</p>\n\n\n",

Both have strong backing in Jewish tradition but rather when using them in a descriptive way (to explain the past) and not to make predictions. To answer your question directly, it is \"Jewish\" to believe people are influenced by their birthdate although they retain much freedom to influence their fate and that specific dates/months have particular influences on the Jewish people.</p>\n\n<p>More specifically:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jewish numerology</strong> - <em>gematria</em> - works with correspondence between letters and numbers, and have been used heavily in text analysis (e.g., the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Baal_HaTurim_on_Genesis.1.1.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baal Haturim on the Torah</a>). In the words of <a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/gematria/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">myjewishlearning</a> \"If a word’s numerical value equals that of another word, a commentator might draw a connection between these two words and the verses in which they appear and use this to prove larger conceptual conclusions.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jewish astrology</strong> also has strong sources, for instance the belief that certain months have positive (e.g., Adar) or negative (e.g., Av) connotations, see TB <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.29b.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanit 29b</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Pappa said: Therefore, in the case of a Jew who has litigation\n  with a gentile, let him avoid him in the month of Av, when the Jews’\n  fortune is bad, and he should make himself available in Adar, when his\n  fortune is good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.156a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 156a</a>) lists the impact of being born on a certain day or at a certain hour. See there at length. However the gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.156b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">concludes</a> that there is no influence of constellations on Israel since it can be counteracted with good deeds.</p>\n\n<p>It is clear that earlier Torah sages were masters in understanding seasons and <em>gematriot</em> (numerology) as well as other esoteric matters (see e.g., Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.28a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 28a</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays though, one should not use astrology or numerology to predict the future. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/361901/jewish/Angels-and-Mazalot.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chabad.org</a> describes it well</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah states (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.18.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>) “There shall not be found among\n  you one who calculates times.” The Talmud, in the name of Rabbi Akiva,\n  specifically applies this prohibition to one who calculates auspicious\n  times, <strong>meaning that one should not make astrology a dominant influence\n  in one’s daily life and predictions through astrology are forbidden</strong>.\n  Therefore one should not use horoscopes to determine one’s future\n  actions, though it is permitted to do character analyses through\n  astrology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, I checked R Yaakov Hillel's <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0873065360\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Faith and Folly</a> which is a wonderful review of all sorts of occult practices, clearly differentiating between the permitted and the forbidden. Regarding astrology he explains (pp. 55ff) that Jews are beyond the influence of constellations, even more as their perform <em>mitzvot</em> and improve their bonding to God through prayer and Torah study, and quotes the Zohar that a sinner severs his bond with God and his evil deeds block the influences of sanctity, therefore placing him again under the rules of the constellations.</p>\n\n<p>He does not list numerology as a forbidden practice directly, but forbids divining auspicious times, divining by omens and consulting mediums and oracles.</p>\n\n<p>For further reading see also <a href=\"https://www.ouisrael.org/torah-tidbits/astrology-judaism/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>There's a distinction to be made between finding relationships between words and ideas or maybe describing personal traits and predicting the future.</p>\n\n<p>The former is perfectly fine, as you mentioned, it is well known Gematriot, the later is forbidden under \"לא תעוננו\" as a branch of idolatry. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarification</strong>: similarly to astrology, it might be allowed to predict large-scale events, that influence large groups of people (aka General providence) but it is forbidden to make personal predictions (aka Private providence). For example, as in printed in weekly horoscopes - \"This week, people of Aries tend to improve their finances\" - is OK but \"you will seriously profit on Tuesday\" is forbidden.</p>\n\n\n",

(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nashim/Kiddushin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is reformulated by Rambam (Hilchot Milah 1:<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=1118\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>-<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=1119\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2</a>) as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומצוה על האב למול את בנו ועל הרב למול את עבדיו יליד בית ומקנת כסף עבר האב או האדון ולא מל אותן ביטל מצות עשה ואינו חייב כרת שאין הכרת תלוי אלא בערל עצמו ובית דין מצווים למול אותו הבן או העבד בזמנו ולא יניחו ערל בישראל ולא בעבדיהן</p>\n  \n  <p>A father is commanded to circumcise his son, and a master, his slaves. This applies both to those who are born in his home and to those purchased by him. If the father or the master transgressed and did not circumcise them, he negated the fulfillment of a positive commandment. He is not, however, punished by <em>karet</em>, for <em>karet</em> is incurred only by the uncircumcised person himself. The court is obligated to circumcise that son or slave at the proper time and should not leave an uncircumcised male among the Jewish people or their slaves. (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/932325/jewish/Milah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n  \n  <p>אין מלין בנו של אדם שלא מדעתו אלא אם כן עבר ונמנע למולו שבית דין מלין אותו בעל כרחו נתעלם מבית דין ולא מלו אותו כשיגדל הוא חייב למול את עצמו וכל יום ויום שיעבור עליו משיגדל ולא ימול את עצמו הרי הוא מבטל מצות עשה אבל אינו חייב כרת עד שימות והוא ערל במזיד</p>\n  \n  <p>We may not circumcise a person's son without his knowledge, unless he has transgressed and did not circumcise him. [In such an instance,] the court must circumcise [the child] against [the father's] will.</p>\n  \n  <p>If the matter does not become known to the court and they do not circumcise him, when [the child] reaches bar mitzvah, he is obligated to circumcise himself. With each and every day that passes after he has reached bar mitzvah, he negates a positive commandment. He is not, however, liable for karet until he dies uncircumcised, having intentionally [failed to perform the mitzvah]. (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/932325/jewish/Milah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is echoed by the subsequent codes: Tur (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6259\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Y.D. 261</a>), Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6743\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Y.D. 261:1</a>), Levush (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14587&st=&pgnum=285\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Y.D. 261:1</a>), Aruch Hashulchan (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14244&st=&pgnum=271\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Y.D. 261:1</a>).</p>\n\n<p>It seems from these sources that there is a hierarchy wherein first the father is obligated, then the court if the father doesn't do it, and then the boy himself when he attains majority if the court doesn't do it. And, moreover, it appears that no one else is allowed to jump in and perform the circumcision instead of the father, unless he deliberately refuses to have his son circumcised, because as explained by the commentaries it is primarily his <em>mitzvah</em> so anyone else would be stealing his mitzvah (and would even be fined for doing so).</p>\n\n<p>But this doesn't seem to directly address the case of an abandoned baby. Based on the above it might seem as if it is simply the court's responsibilty to take care of the circumcision, and if he is still uncircumcised when he attains majority then it becomes his own problem.</p>\n\n<p>However, in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14244&st=&pgnum=271\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the next <em>seif</em></a> in Aruch Hashulchan we find the following, which does seem to directly address your case:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דבר פשוט הוא שבמקום שאין ב\"ד ואין אב החיוב מוטל על כל ישראל שבאותו מקום למולו דהא כתיב המול לכם כל זכר ולכל ישראל נאמרה אלא דכשיש ב\"ד ממילא דהחיוב יותר על הב\"ד </p>\n  \n  <p>It is obvious that in a place where there is no court and no father, the obligation devolves to every Jew in that place to circumcise him, because the verse states \"every male among you shall be circumcised\" and this was said to all of Israel. It's just that if there is a court then obligation happens to be stronger on the court [than on an individual].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So in short, it would seem that a father can do the circumcision himself or appoint someone else to do it. No one can usurp the father and do the circumcision on their own unless the father is derelict in his duty. If there is a court around then it becomes the court's responsibility to appoint someone, but if there is no court than anyone has the right —  and the obligation — to perform the circumcision.</p>\n\n\n",

Then time and time again, Hashem, through Moshe, effects a major attack on the well being of Egypt: the water supply, the food, the trees, the animals etc.</p>\n\n<p>Why doesn't Paroh just kill Moshe as someone threatening the wellbeing of the nation? He sought to kill Moshe after the killing of a single Egyptian but he doesn't seem to lay a hand against Moshe during (at least) the first 7 plagues.</p>\n\n<p>Are there midrashim or meforshim which deal with this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Or HaChaim says in his commentary (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Exodus.2.15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 2:15</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויבקש להרוג וגו'. פירוש ביקש להוכיח הדבר אם כן עשה כדי להרוג אותו,\n  ולזה ברח משה מפני פרעה שמא יתברר הדבר ויהרגנו. או ירצה באומרו מפני\n  פרעה כי הכיר בפניו כי זעומים הם והרגיש מזה וברח הגם שלא ידע כי הגיעו\n  הדברים לפרעה:</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>ויבקש להרוג אותו. He tried to kill him.</strong>  This means that Pharaoh tried to establish proof that Moses had killed the Egyptian as a\n  result of which he would be brought to trial and be executed. This is\n  why Moses fled from Pharaoh in case Pharaoh would obtain enough proof\n  to make him stand trial. On the other hand, the words מפני פרעה may\n  refer to Pharaoh's face. When Moses looked at Pharaoh's angry face he\n  realised that he was in danger and fled even though he did not know\n  what Pharaoh knew and what he did not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If Pharaoh needed to \"establish proof that Moses had killed the Egyptian as a result of which he would be brought to trial and be executed\" then that leads me to believe that Pharaoh, for whatever reason (legal, political or otherwise), was not necessarily in a position to unilaterally order the execution of Moses. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This will be an unsourced answer. I imagine this has a lot to do with politics. Moses only goes back to Egypt after the Pharoah who wanted to arrest him dies, this leaves open the idea that Moses can't be convicted of having killed that Egyptian 40 years ago. This might explain why the new Pharoah never bring's up the Egyptian that Moses killed in the past.</p>\n<p>So when Moses makes demands of Pharaoh he seems to be making those demands with the understanding he will not be arrested. And Moses's initial public demand is not \"Let my people free,\" it was \"let them celebrate a festival to our God.\" This is actually a reasonable, and probably lawful demand in Egyptian society. We know that Egypt had a forced labor class that was paid, had rights, and <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/11-things-you-may-not-know-about-ancient-egypt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">even organized labor strikes</a>, so it makes sense that Pharaoh wouldn't kill Moses outright because that would make Pharaoh look bad to the royal court.</p>\n<p>Moving on from there, Moses never threatens Pharaoh directly with harm. God causes all the plagues, even if Moses (or Aaron?) put on a little show while it happens. This gives the impression that even if Pharaoh decided to kill Moses/Aaron, the plagues might still keep coming, so killing them off wouldn't solve anything.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If God could harden Pharaoh's heart against freeing the Israelites, He could harden Pharaoh's heart against killing Moses.</p>\n\n\n",

Bavel is healthy (has a good lineage), Mishon is dead (totally bad lineage), Maday is sick (mostly good), and Elam is dying (mostly bad).</p>\n\n<p>Immediately afterwards, the Talmud <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.71b.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">asks</a> what the boundaries of Bavel are, beginning by quoting the opinions of Rav and Shemu'el.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that this dispute about the boundaries of Bavel is about lineage, meaning which places have a good lineage. (The practical ramification could be that you can marry a Babylonian man or woman without checking, on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.71a.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the assumption that he or she has a good lineage</a>.)

However, the Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.71b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">has already established</a> that Rabbi Yochanan is unaware of the fact that Babylonians had a pure lineage. Rabbi Yochanan believes that there are also people with bad ancestry in Babylon. Why would Rabbi Yochanan discuss the boundaries of Bavel within the context of determining who has a good lineage, if he doesn't believe that Babylonians have an especially good lineage?</p></li>\n<li><p>The Talmud Yerushalmi (4:1, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40740&st=&pgnum=465&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">43a</a>) also mentions this dispute between Rav and Shemu'el. While the Yerushalmi does have (quoting the Babylonians) the comparison between Bavel, Mishon, Maday and Elam, this is mentioned <em>after</em> the dispute about the boundaries of Bavel. The Yerushalmi gives these borders next to a dispute about whether to accept converts from Tadmor in marriage. Could it be that the dispute is about the border between Bavel and Tadmor, i.e. between Jewish converts from Tadmor who can't intermarry with Jews (according to one opinion) and Babylonians who can? And if so, would the Talmud Yerushalmi be interpreting this dispute differently than the Talmud Bavli, or could they both be sharing this understanding of the dispute?</p></li>\n<li><p>Side point: It strikes me as strange that Rabbi Yochanan, from the land of Israel, voice an opinion specifically on the <em>northern</em> border of Babylon, and that the Yerushalmi is aware of Rav and Shemu'el's dispute (via Rabbi Yose berabbi Bon), but not Rabbi Yochanan's opinion. How can this be explained?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

ROY further adds that in contemporary times employers are not strict in these matters (essentially forgiving the couple of extra minutes) and therefore all workers are obligated to recite all benedictions upon finishing a meal (cf. SA <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.191.2?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">191:2)</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Yet, it is still important to note that this can’t be a sweeping pronouncement or prohibition since other factors need be taken into account: What if the employer is a non-Jew and there likely is no “אדעתא דהכי” as assumed in the aforementioned SA? Employers are aware that many an employee has a drunken weekend, they might be lax on an added coffee-break the following work-day but would they tolerate a full unproductive day? Is there really no possible concern of “stealing” when, for example, a traveling salesman has a customer to which the employee must fly to and on account of his fasting he is unable to perform after the employer already spent money on the flight and lodge? </p>\n\n<p>In short: People’s livelihood can be literally at stake when fasting. My -obviously theoretic- solution: If a person knows they will not be able to perform at work if they fast it is best to eat/drink within the minimum amount (cf.<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Biur_Halacha.554.6.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> Beur Halachah 554:6</a>) so A) they won’t fall ill [and consequently a <em>bedieved</em> case] and B) the fast won’t be considered broken. Suggestion: Choose your food and drink wisely. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Give these strangers benefit of the doubt. They may be transferring flights and have come from somewhere else where the fast has ended for them, but not where you are, now.</p>\n<p>For further explanation, please see: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/12965/5275\">\"Fast days and time zones\"</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus referring to Hashem as <em>He</em> would involve blasphemy. While English does have the word <em>it</em>, that word refers to something that is inanimate and sexless like a table or chair. As a result, it would not be proper to refer to Hashem as <em>It</em>. It in English does not refer to a being whose gender is indeterminate or a mixed group.

How can one understand such a strong desire to worship idols? Who today has an urge to bow to statues?</p>\n\n<p>The closest I could get to understand it is the <em>gemara</em> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.69b.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 69b</a> (and a parallel passage in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.64a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 64a</a>) that juxtaposes the <em>yetzer hara</em> for idol worship to the <em>yetzer hara</em> for forbidden relations. Apparently, at a time, the passion for idols was equally strong to the sexual passion.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe, just as Hashem wants us to channel our sexual passion in the right way (for the sake of harmonious relations between spouses and to have children), He wants us to channel our urge to worship in the right way.</p>\n\n<p>PS.

It works like a cycle; one has a weak connection to God(due to poor spiritual choices), which causes them to be scared because God took a certain degree of protection from him, and, in an effort to replenish their \"holy\" protection, they replace God with something else(chas v'shalom). However, it's all an illusion based on feelings. The difference between Judaism and other religions, is that Judaism is based on knowledge while other religions are based on feelings.</p>\n\n<p>I could keep going but I think that's enough to get the point across. I think this is the true answer(in conjunction to the answer offered by the Talmud that the cause of avodah was to \"permit\" illicit relations) and based on a lot of thought. Just a simple answer I think could shed light on the topic.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>As I answered to \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/99484/15579\">Definition of AZ</a>\", #2 - the theological background:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>G-d is one and only and omnipresent and omni-everything. But wait, what are we, then? What about the rest of the creation - Sun, Moon, Earth, mountains, trees et all - does it all exist or not?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the idea of an almighty deity is impossible to grasp in our human mind. We're not built to perceive infinity in anything - space, numbers (math), matter. That complicates the belief in One G-d very problematic. On the other hand:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>The idea of one G-d is impractical, for we have to admit the existence of other bodies and powers within the Creation, for example, Sun is a physical body, Sun exerts [gravitational, thermal] powers onto Earth and us, or angels are spiritual bodies that can exert powers on humans and the rest of the creation. This idea aligns perfectly with the Torah.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, it is a clear contradiction to say \"G-d is everywhere\" and \"there are me AND G-d, where I am not G-d\". That makes the idea of one G-d impractical - we can't observe the commands thinking there's only G-d in existence - we have to admit that we exist as well as all other things in creation to allow the interaction prescribed by the Torah.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Therefore, we need to think about a handier deity, one that exists alongside His Creation, and that's exactly the shift that the Torah does, presenting a \"human-like\" G-d, with \"limbs\", \"thoughts\", \"feelings\" and \"actions\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.1.9?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Yesodey 1, 9</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p>That shift is very clearly presented in the Torah puzzling many interpreters with \"אלוהים אחרים\" or \"גָדוֹל ה' מִכָּל־הָאֱלֹהִים\" or similar expressions, implying there are many forces and powers in play.</p></li>\n<li><p>However, that's exactly where we are obligated to stop (see my definition of idolatry) and draw the line: even though other bodies and powers exist and act, we are to worship G-d alone admitting that the powers of all others come solely from His will. </p></li>\n<li><p>But some people just can't stop and extrapolate #1 further to people (Christianity) or solar bodies and natural forces (classical idolatry).

Looking at the way Avraham (the steps he took by which he) established his faith it seems to start with (the recognition) knowing and acknowledging G-d (that He exists) , which could be the cognitive form of his faith. Next Avraham seems to accept G-d as His G-d, which could be the affective form of his faith, and from hence forward he commits himself to the ways of G-d (he shows obedience to the will/voice/words of G-d).</p>\n\n<p>To sum things up we have 'acknowledgement, relationship and actions' seem to be the steps of faith here. Looking at the covenant making with the people of Israël, one could say the covenant exists of 'a agreement, a bond (relationship), and actions'. </p>\n\n<p>So it seems that faith is being built on:'mind, heart and actions'. </p>\n\n<p>Do these elements form the foundation of what we would call faith? \nAre there any commentators which teach us about the steps/elements of faith?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It appears that the OP is describing 3 different approaches that exist in Judaism regarding building faith, character, and demonstraing bitachon. One can also view these as targeting the three parts of one's soul: nefesh, ruach, and neshamah.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Cognitive: <strong>Emunah</strong>. The Rambam defines <em>emunah</em> as the knowledge that Hashem created and continues to run all of Creation. In Shemoneh Perakim, he delineates the first of the Thirteen Principles of Faith: “The Creator, blessed be He, created and orchestrates all activities, and He alone did, does and will do all actions.” Simply put, nothing can exist and no activity can occur without Hashem. Emuna includes many aggadetas by ChaZaL about our forefathers and foremothers who set for us the example of what is the right course in life. By studying these sources we build <em>emunah</em>. One can also view these as bringing purity to one's neshamah, which relates to the mind and intelligence.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Service of the heart is commonly understood as prayer. However, there are many other matters, such as having joy from mitzvos, gratitude, teshuvah, which can be placed under the domain of one's heart's service. One can certainly include in it working on one's character traits as described in Mishna Avos, books on Chassidus and Mussar. It is a work which makes our emotional part <em>ruach</em> more flexible and humble.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Finally, actions to perform the mitzvos, which one may define as bitachon, it is the work of one's <em>nefesh</em>, which relates to behavior and action. One can view these as a fruit on the tree of one's <em>emunah</em>, which was spiced with one's service of the heart.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is known from the books on kabbalah, that our soul also has two other aspects: <em>chaya</em> - experiencing awareness of G-d as continually creating the world; and <em>yechidah</em> - ultimate unity of the soul in G-d, as manifest by pure faith, absolute devotion and the continuous readiness to sacrifice one’s life for G-d. <strong>These two aspects are not mentioned by OP but they are also crucial in Judaism.</strong></p>\n<p>Sefer \"Mesilas Yesharim\" by R. Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in the introduction comments on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.10.12-13?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 10:12-13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעַתָּה֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל מָ֚ה יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ שֹׁאֵ֖ל מֵעִמָּ֑ךְ כִּ֣י אִם־לְ֠יִרְאָ֠ה אֶת־יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ לָלֶ֤כֶת בְּכׇל־דְּרָכָיו֙ וּלְאַהֲבָ֣ה אֹת֔וֹ וְלַֽעֲבֹד֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ׃ לִשְׁמֹ֞ר אֶת־מִצְוֺ֤ת יְהֹוָה֙ וְאֶת־חֻקֹּתָ֔יו אֲשֶׁ֛ר אָנֹכִ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּ֑וֹם לְט֖וֹב לָֽךְ׃</p>\n<p><em>And now, O Israel, what does your God יהוה demand of you? Only this: to revere your G-d Hashem, to walk only in divine paths, to love and to serve your G-d Hashem with all your heart and soul. Keeping Hashem’s commandments and laws, which I enjoin upon you today, for your good.</em></p>\n<p>Here he [Moshe] incorporated all the elements that are necessary for the perfection of that service that is desired by the Holy One blessed be He: awe of the Eternal, walking in His ways, love [of the Eternal], perfecting the heart, and observance of all mitzvos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While each of these elements may simultaneously impact different parts of the soul, the main contribution can be ordered as: observance of all mitzvos (action, nefesh), perfecting the heart (emotional, ruach), love [of the Eternal] (cognitive, neshamah), walking in His ways (chayah), awe of the Eternal (yechidah).</p>\n<p>Mesilas Yesharim uses the gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.20b.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avoda Zara 20b</a> to show that these five aspects of service are interrelated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From here Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir would say: Torah study leads to care in the performance of mitzvot. Care in the performance of mitzvot leads to diligence in their observance. Diligence leads to cleanliness of the soul. Cleanliness of the soul leads to abstention from all evil. Abstention from evil leads to purity and the elimination of all base desires. Purity leads to piety. Piety leads to humility. Humility leads to fear of sin. Fear of sin leads to holiness. Holiness leads to the Divine Spirit. The Divine Spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead. And piety is greater than all of them, as it is stated: “Then You did speak in a vision to Your pious ones” (Psalms 89:20).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, one can use these 11 levels of observance of mitzvos as a web in which the five aspects of service of G-d from Devarim 10:12-13 get connected in their impact on different parts of one's soul.</p>\n\n\n",

I don't understand the Gemara's answer to that question.  Can anybody explain it to me?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yohanan originally made a statement that if anybody violates any negative commandment which is preceded by a positive commandment (לאו שקדמו עשה), everybody agrees that he would receive lashes as punishment.</p>\n\n<p>Later on, he retracts this statement and the gemara asks why. The reason he retracts the statement is because of a difficulty. There is a <em>beraisa</em> that states that a non-kohein who divorces the woman he raped (the negative commandment is not to divorce her and the positive commandment that precedes it is the commandment to marry her) does not receive lashes. Rather, he is forced to re-marry the woman. This contradicts Rabbi Yohanan's original statement.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See Ritba who paraphrased the comment of Rashi in a very clear way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמרו לו אמרת פירש\"י ז\"ל אמרו לו לר׳ יוחנן אמרת להא דאמר תלמידך משמך? וא\"ל ר׳ יוחנן לא ואמר רבה האלהים אמרה אלא שחוזר בו ולא היה \n  צריך לחזור בו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They asked Rabbi Yochanan: \"You said it?\",  regarding the rule that his student reported in his name. He answered: \"No!\". Rabba explained that when they asked him, it was after that Rabbi Yochanan changed his mind, i.e. he answered that he doesn't hold this rule is true. And Rabba explained that there was two steps in Rabbi Yochanan's opinion and they asked at the time of the second step. Further Rabba said that Rabbi Yochanan was not right when he changed his mind, because there are several proofs that his first mind was right. Rabbi Yochanan didn't say \"I never said this\". </p>\n\n<p><strong>The students when they asked Rabbi Yochanan, didn't know that there were two steps, so, their question was obviously of the type \"Is it what you are teaching?\". It was not an investigation.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

And the Ba’al Shem Tov, zichrono livracha, in general also did that. Of course, in scholarship, the Ba’al Shem Tov wasn’t as famous as the Vilna Gaon was. He wasn’t as famous as the Vilna Gaon as a Torah scholar but he devoted himself to an entirely different field! His field was to awaken devotion in the hearts of the multitude. And therefore he used different methods. They weren’t methods that were opposed to the Torah, but they were different methods however.</p>\n<p>For instance, the Vilna Gaon had no need to sing a melody. And that’s because he dealt only with the intelligentsia. He didn’t have any direct contact with the masses. He had an influence on the masses, but it was only indirectly. The Vilna Gaon was one of the top scholars, not only of his generation but of any generation. And therefore, he dealt only with great men. Whereas the Ba’al Shem Tov, he dealt also with the general masses. Even with very ignorant people too.

We sometimes hear that the pursuit of material possessions is worship of wealth; that objects of sentimental value, such as items that belonged to a loved one, is worship of objects; that viewing certain ideas as absolute and not subject to inquiry is worship of ideas, or idolatry of the mind; that nationalism is worship of country; that egocentrism is worship of self; that astrology is worship of the stars; that love of another human being is worship of a person; that love of pets is worship of animals; that excessive family pride is worship of ancestors; and so on.  </p>\n\n<p>I don't buy it.  According to this view, anything you care one whit about is idolatry.  So the only way to observe the commandment against idolatry would be not care at all about anything.</p>\n\n<p>Is there ANYTHING in our traditional Sources about idolatry (avodah zara -- strange worship) being anything other than the worship of material objects as if they had power over your destiny?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.105b.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 105b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והתניא רבי שמעון בן אלעזר אומר משום חילפא בר אגרא שאמר משום רבי יוחנן בן נורי המקרע בגדיו בחמתו והמשבר כליו בחמתו והמפזר מעותיו בחמתו יהא בעיניך כעובד עבודה זרה שכך אומנתו של יצר הרע היום אומר לו עשה כך ולמחר אומר לו עשה כך עד שאומר לו עבוד עבודה זרה והולך ועובד אמר רבי אבין מאי קראה לא יהיה בך אל זר ולא תשתחוה לאל נכר איזהו אל זר שיש בגופו של אדם הוי אומר זה יצר הרע‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Wasn’t it taught in a baraita that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Ḥilfa bar Agra, who said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri: One who rends his garments in his anger, or who breaks his vessels in his anger, or who scatters his money in his anger, should be like an idol worshipper in your eyes, as that is the craft of the evil inclination.

On the other hand, one speaks of satisfying and the other of performing – two different things.</p>\n\n<p>But there is no preposition linking it to the rest of the phrase, so the meaning is obscure. We also do not know whose desire or desirability is being discussed – Hashem’s or ours.</p>\n\n<p>The Targum renders it, “And satisfies for every living being their desires.” Similarly, Rav Hirsch, in his siddur, has “satisfy the desire of every living thing”. The Metzudah and ArtScroll siddurim take the same approach. But that would more usually be “retzon kol chai”.</p>\n\n<p>Shemos Rabbah (beginning of Ch. 24) points out that the Tehillim does not say “hunger” because, as we all know from experience, the hungers of a person are not always satisfied. Rather, it refers to Hashem’s Ratzon, that Hashem gives according to His Will. However, that is an idea more usually written “beratzon – in/through His Will.”</p>\n\n<p>In his book on tefillah, Rav Schwab repeats a devar Torah said at his Sheva Berachos. Why is Ashrei is written as an alphabetic acrostic? The alef-beis structure represents the natural order. When we thank Hashem for satisfying our needs, we are speaking of his doing so through natural means. He does not support us by showering money upon us. Rather, Hashem provides us with material success. Rav Schwab therefore suggests that “ratzon” means desirability, and that we are praising Hashem as the One who bestows the desirability and charisma upon His creations necessary for succeeding at business.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Kook offers a unique alternative. Man needs purpose, goals, something to strive for.  Without wants, there is no concept of mission; boredom and ennui quickly set in. Rav Noach Weinberger says that man is a happiness seeker. Thomas Jefferson speaks of the “pursuit of happiness”. Happiness can even be defined as the emotion that drives a search, which is why we feel more happiness during the pursuit than once we have gotten used to having our goal. Along similar lines, in Borei Nefashos we thank Hashem for creating “the many souls and their lacks”. Hashem satisfies us by giving us desires. We thank Hashem for giving us purposeful existence, meaningful lives.</p>\n\n<p>Having needs has a second advantage, in addition to the one discussed by Rav Kook. After the sin of tempting Chavah to take the forbidden fruit, the snake is punished that it go on its stomach and that its food will be dust. Rashi repeats Chazal’s question: How is this a punishment? Is it not good to have food wherever one goes? The punishment was in the implied statement. Hashem did not want to be bothered by the requests and needs of the snake. By giving us needs, Hashem pushes us to pursue a relationship with Him. This provides a nice counter-balance – Hashem supplies our needs, but not to the point that we are free of needing to have a dialogue with Him.</p>\n\n<p>And then there are the interpretations in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/99516/1570\">LN6595's answer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to suggest that the ambiguity is intentional. That, in fact, David and the One Who inspired him intended each of these meanings – and others of which I am unaware and I did not identify in this essay. This is what makes a tefillah rich. Each verse has layers of meaning so that even after years of three-times-daily repetition, there are still knew thoughts to inspire.  Each time we say Ashrei we may be saying the same words, but the intent behind those words could be something that speaks particularly to what we wish to express to Hashem at that moment.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I’d like to propose an answer of my own, which I have not seen anyone say, based on the continuation of the Pesukim: “Hashem is righteous in all His ways...Hashem is close to those who call Him, to those who call Him sincerely. The will (רצון) of those who fear Him He does, and their cries He hears, and He saves them, etc.” </p>\n\n<p>Bamidbar Rabbah 11:7:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּתוּב אֶחָד אוֹמֵר (תהלים קמה, יח): קָרוֹב ה' לְכָל קֹרְאָיו, וְכָתוּב אֶחָד אוֹמֵר (תהלים י, א): לָמָּה ה' תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק. עַד שֶׁלֹא נֶחְתַּם גְּזַר דִּין קָרוֹב ה' לְכָל קֹרְאָיו, מִשֶּׁנֶּחְתַּם גְּזַר דִּין לָמָּה ה' תַּעֲמֹד בְּרָחוֹק.</p>\n  \n  <p>One passuk says, “Hashem is close to all who call Him,” and another passuk (Tehillim 10:1) says, “Why, Hashem, do you stand far away?” Before the decree is sealed, “Hashem is close to all who call Him.” Once the decree is sealed, “Why, Hashem, do you stand far away?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps the passuk of “You open Your hand” is only fulfilled when the later Pesukim are as well - when one “calls out sincerely,” and when done so before the decree is sealed. Whether that’s <em>sufficient</em> for the passuk to be “violated” I imagine would vary by the person; however, “Hashem is righteous in all His ways” and will only induce suffering when justice absolutely demands it. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In his commentary to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37718&st=&pgnum=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 4b</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechezkel_Landau\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Ezekiel Landau</a> notes that the word רצון used in this verse appears out of place. If the verse was referring to every creature receiving all of its sustenance needs it should have used the word מזון or שובע which would directly mean that. R. Landau therefore argues that the word רצון suggests that it is referring not to the fulfillment of the needs, but to the person's attitude. It is saying that God gives people the will/fortitude to be satisfied with what they receive, even if they should have received more for their needs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונחזור לענינינו שסידור א\"ב הוא ופסוק פותח את ידיך ומשביע לכל חי רצון יש לנו בו דקדוק דהוה ליה למימר ומשביע לכל חי מזון או שובע מהו לשון משביע רצון ואומר אני שדבר זה אמר דוד כלפי מי שמזונותיו מצומצמים בדוחק ובעוני שהקב\"ה נותן וחונן לו דיעה לשמוח בחלקו ואיזה עשיר השמח בחלקו ואין לך מדה טובה כמדת ההסתפקות ולקמן סוף פרק שני אמרו כל העולם ניזון בשביל חנינא בני וחנינא בני די לו בקב חרובין וכו' דוק בדבריהם שלא אמרו וחנינא אין לו אלא קב חרובין אבל אמרו די לו בקב חרובין שהיה לו בזה די והותר וקיבל זה ברצון כאדם שיש לו די כל צרכו וזהו שרמז בפסוק זה פותח את ידיך ומשביע לכל חי רצון שישביעו במה שנתן לו בדעתו שישמח בחלקו ויהיה זה כאילו נתמלא כל רצונו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, those stolen by bandits are not considered to be like captives, as there is a concern that they might have consented to their captors, thinking that they will marry them. The Gemara raises a difficulty: But isn’t it taught in a baraita that the reverse is the case, i.e., women taken by the monarchy are not classified as captives, whereas this status does apply to those abducted by bandits?</p>\n<p>מלכות אמלכות לא קשיא הא במלכות אחשורוש הא במלכות בן נצר</p>\n<p>The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction between the ruling of one baraita with regard to those captured by the monarchy and the ruling of the other baraita with regard to those captured by the monarchy is not difficult: This first baraita is referring to the monarchy of Ahasuerus, i.e., a powerful king, as the woman is aware that he is merely using her to satisfy his lust and will certainly not marry her, whereas that other baraita is dealing with the monarchy of ben Netzer, a man who established for himself a minor kingdom through robbery and small-scale conquests. It is possible for a woman to suppose that a king like ben Netzer will eventually marry her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would therefore conclude that Esther would have the halachic status of a captive and would be subject to the mitzvah of pidyon shevuyim.</p>\n\n\n",

He commanded to his son that he go to the rooms, but not to all of them. \"Even though I built all of them, but you, because your understanding is small, if you go to all of them, you will stray in them, your knowledge will be confused, you will be left there, and you will be unable to return outside.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, the Torah is not merely describing the sin as something in which people stray; it's speaking directly to the potential sinner, warning him, \"You don't understand how much harm will befall you if you do these sins; if you try to eat these foods, <em>you will stray</em> more than you will ever know.\"</p>\n\n<p><sup>I <em>did</em> say that he interprets the Gemara as referring to a different usage of the term.

We have seen the addition of many favorites, such as:</p>\n\n<p>Lecha dodi -- 16th cent.; \nShalom Alechem -- 15th cent.; \nYigdal -- 15th cent.; \nAdon Olam -- 11th cent.; \nPrayer for Israel -- 1948; \nEn kelohenu -- 9th cent.; \nkEl Adon -- 8th cent.; \nHamavdil -- 11th cent.; \nMaoz Tzur -- 13th cent.; \nYedid nefesh -- 16th cent.;  </p>\n\n<p>So, can we conclude that we may add a completely separate prayer extolling women (if that's what a congregation wants) without breaking halacha, but not make it part of the Amidah, which must remain in fixed form?</p>\n\n\n",

When this is understood, it becomes clearer that the Tanya actually is a manual for how to become a <em>beinoni</em>.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>In the language of the Tanya, the <em>beinoni</em> is at a very high level but a realistic target (from <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/2031161/jewish/What-is-the-Tanya.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a> introduction to Tanya)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a person who exercises complete self-control and never commits a sin\n  knowingly in any of the three areas of human activity: thought, speech\n  and deed. [... the author] insists that this ideal personality is\n  within grasp of the average individual, although not without constant\n  effort and vigilance. The underlying doctrine here is that man is\n  essentially and inherently a moral being.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>rasha</em> of the Tanya is not all bad either (from <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1028910/jewish/Chapter-11.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">chapter 11</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is also the person in whom the wickedness prevails more\n  strongly, and all three garments of evil clothe themselves in him,\n  causing him to commit more heinous and frequent sins. But\n  intermittently he suffers remorse, and thoughts of repentance enter\n  his mind, from the quality of good that is in his soul, that gathers\n  strength now and then. However, he has not enough strength to vanquish\n  the evil so as to rid himself entirely of his sins and be as one who\n  confesses and abandons [his evil ways, once and for all]. Concerning\n  such a person, the Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said, “The wicked\n  are full of remorse.” These represent the majority of the wicked, in\n  whose soul still lingers some good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Tanya's audience was large and varied and aimed to help all reach their potential (from <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/2031161/jewish/What-is-the-Tanya.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most of [R Shneur Zalman's followers], undoubtedly, were simple folk and laymen. But there were\n  also many students of the Talmud, and philosophically inclined young\n  men, who, like himself in his teens, sought a new way of life and new\n  outlets for their intellectual as well as spiritual drives. The\n  consideration of such a [varied] audience largely determined the\n  form and style of the book.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My recommendation for someone wanting to learn Tanya is to find a good commentary, or a simplified version of it. I personally got a lot out of <a href=\"https://www.judaica-world.com/index.php/gps-for-the-soul-h-c.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GPS for the Soul</a> by R Nadav Cohen which is an explanation and simplification of many of Tanya's concepts, in a language modernized for our day and age. See also <a href=\"http://ascentofsafed.com/cgi-bin/ascent.cgi?Name=Tanya-Nadav\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>No, the Tanya is meant for the average person who is not a tzadik and who has the potential to be a bononi. The reason that the Tanya and the first part of Tanya are referred to as \"sefer Shel benonim\" (the book of the in between each) is to help each of us attain the rank of being a benonim as the parable in the talmudic quoted in Tanya as being the longer shorter route to acheiving this goal. </p>\n\n\n",

The Egyptians worshipped the Nile and the canals branching from it, but the natural formations there (such as the reeds) wouldn't thereby become forbidden for use as an object of idolatry. So Yocheved placed the basket in the reeds. Then along came Basya to immerse in the water in order to convert to Judaism, and with that she \"nullified\" the river as an idol - so now Moshe's basket could enter it. (See footnote *ח there.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ותשם בסוף על שפת היאור. ולא בתוך היאור, מחמת דהם היו עובדים לנילוס, רק דאין בו תפיסת ידי אדם, ועי׳ פסחים דף נ״ג סימן לנחלים קנים ע״ש מ״ש, ר״ל דנחל איתן למ״ד שלא נשתמש לעבר, אבל תוך היאור לא דהוה תפיסת ידי אדם, ב״מ דף ק״ג, ע״ב (ונ״מ) אריסא. רק כיון דבת פרעה הלכה לרחוץ ביטלה [הע״ז] שזה להתגייר ושוב באתה התבה בתוך היאור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The point, then, is that (according to this source, at least) the question is a nonstarter. Without Basya being there and immersing herself in the river, Moshe wouldn't have been in it in the first place; he would have remained among the reeds, and eventually Yocheved would have taken him back from there. You could say, I suppose, that her merit was that she was the one Egyptian at that time who was converting to Judaism and thus nullifying the river as an object of idolatry, but then her saving Moshe is a side effect of the free-willed choice she made to undertake that conversion.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In the Midrash HaGadol, Bereishis 23:1 it notes that Basya saw through Ruach HaKodesh (Divine Inspiration) that the redeemer of the Jews would be raised by her, so she would walk besides the River Nile every morning and evening. When Moshe came her way, Hashem gave her what she sought and she rejoiced with much happiness.</p>\n\n\n",

There are shittos which hold that wearing a kippa saves your from the issur min HaTorah of bechukasaim lo teilachu (Taz opinion in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x351\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 8:3</a>). Then there are those who hold you can even learn without a head covering (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44345&st=&pgnum=115\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"t Maharshal #72</a>). Then with regard to a woman's head covering you have many opinions who hold that all of the hair must be covered even in one's house, and then you have opinions which are melamed zechus that covering hair today is not required (Rav Yosef Messas <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22016&st=&pgnum=216\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Otzar Hamichtavim 3:1884</a>, translated <a href=\"https://forthodoxy.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/responsum-of-rav-messas-on-covering-the-hair-forthodoxy-revised-and-updated.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, and Mayim Chaim 2:110). As you can see every scenario can change the halacha and based off which opinions you hold by. There is such a shitta that in your own home covering hair is not required even if there is a guest (check Nosei Keilem in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7794\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even Ha'ezer 115</a>). </p>\n\n<p>However, the more accepted approach according to most poskim is that wearing a kippa is only a minhag, and covering hair is surely more required. So simply put the wife would get the covering since that is more important. I do believe that such a case is highly unlikely to ever happen because one can use many items to cover ones head, but hypothetically the poskim would be more concerned about the woman's hair being uncovered.</p>\n\n\n",

The innermost part was the site of the Holy Ark with the cherubs on its lid, the Holy of Holies. Beyond the dividing curtain was the Sanctuary known as the \"Tent of Meeting\". Beyond that was the Courtyard, containing the copper altar on which most sacrifices were offered.\n  The Golden Altar, the Table, and the Menorah … correspond to the world of the planets in our universe….\n  These three areas correspond to the three parts of the universe the world of the angels, the world of the planets and our world. <strong>That most important element in Creation, man himself, is similarly composed of three distinct parts</strong>. He represents the very existence on earth known as \"olamha'katan\", microcosm. Existence on earth is similarly divided into three parts: The \"olam ha'dibur\", the \"world of speech\", the creatures who can freely communicate with one another; there is the \"olam ha'chayot\", the other living creatures; and there is the \"olam ha'teva\", inanimate nature.\n  <strong>The first part of the Tabernacle is the section beyond the dividing curtain containing the Holy Ark, the Tablets and the Cherubs, all of which are interior vessels concealed from inspection</strong>. These represent the Divine Chariot. Ezekiel describes this first part in the words: \"And the Glory of Israel's G‑d was upon them, above.\" (Ezekiel 10:19) We also have a verse in Psalms 80:2describing the Shepherd of Israel, as \"sitting on the cherubs.\" This is a reference to the world of the angels, who are tangible, invisible intellectual beings who serve as throne and carrier of G‑d. <strong>The corresponding manifestation in our world is the olam ha'dibur, the head, seat of the brain and wisdom</strong>. The intellect is perceived as pouring out wisdom to the brain. A truly righteous person serves as a \"chariot\" - a carrier of G‑d's Presence - as did the patriarchs of old; we can similarly serve as the Chariot by fulfilling the commandment of wearing tefillin on the head, symbol of the brain, and on the arm opposite our hearts. These two organs correspond to the two cherubs. By keeping this in mind we can understand the powerful effect of putting on and wearing the tefillin.\n  <strong>The second part of the Tabernacle, the one outside the Holy of Holies, contained the Altar for the incense (the Golden Altar), the Table, and the Menorah</strong>. These are highly distinguished interior furnishings, though not of the highest order. These furnishings correspond to the world of the planets in our universe. The planets are considered as highly honored, conveying the glory of the Creator by their very existence and regular orbits. They are responsible for the continued existence of an orderly universe. The world of the beasts and other living creatures performs a function on earth comparable to that of the planets in space. <strong>The organ in man corresponding to that world of beast in man is the heart, an interior organ upon which life itself is dependent</strong>. Our entire body remains functional only by the heart pumping blood through it on an ongoing basis.\n  <strong>The third part of the Tabernacle is the Courtyard, in front of the Tabernacle, the site of the copper altar, the altar on which the public Elevation offering was offered up each morning and each evening</strong>. As a result of this, the animals being sacrificed, sustained losses, i.e. they lost their lives. This part of the Tabernacle corresponds to our \"lower\" world, which constantly undergoes birth and death, i.e. sustains losses. <strong>The parallel part in man is olam ha'teva, the merely functional nature, the parts from the navel downwards</strong>. It is this region from which man's existence develops first. This is also the reason it is the region whence the eventual death of the body commences. We must regard the loss of life as the cause of renewed existence; if there were no losses in our world there would not be a need for new life [be it human, animal or merely botanical, Ed.] to come into existence.\n  We have now learned that the three parts of the Tabernacle correspond to the three parts of the universe concerning which King David said: \"Bless the Lord, O, His angels, mighty creatures who do His bidding, ever obedient to His bidding. Bless the Lord all His hosts, His servants who do His will; bless the Lord all His works, through the length and breadth of His realm.\" (Psalms 103:10) David's sonSolomon also adopted his father's outlook when he alluded to this in three consecutive verses in Song of Songs 5:13-15. Three different parts of the human body form the subject of those verses, each one representing a different aspect of the universe and how man's composition reflects this division of the universe into three constituent parts. I[Rabbenu Bachya] have explained this in detail when I discussed Jacob's dream of the ladder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Sources indeed describe a review of once's life.

Since there is no physical form, there is neither eating,\n  drinking, nor any of the other bodily functions of this world like\n  sitting, standing, sleeping, death, sadness, laughter, and the like.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam describes how souls will go back to their Godly source and experience the ultimate good, which is to be close to God's presence (see further in Hilchot Tshuva).</p>\n\n<p>Other sources describe a phase of judgement after death where souls are indeed judged, or judging themselves.</p>\n\n<p>See how chabad.org describes it (section <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/282508/jewish/What-Happens-After-Death.htm#footnote2a282508\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What is Heaven and Hell?</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After death, the soul returns to its divine Source, together with all\n  the G‑dliness it has “extracted” from the physical world by using it\n  for meaningful purposes. <strong>The soul now relives its experiences on\n  another plane, and experiences the good it accomplished during its\n  physical lifetime as incredible happiness and pleasure, and the\n  negative as incredibly painful.</strong> [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>When the soul departs from the body, it stands before the heavenly\n  court to give a “judgment and accounting” of its earthly life. But\n  the heavenly court does only the “accounting” part; <strong>the “judgment”\n  part—that, only the soul itself can do.</strong> Only the soul can pass\n  judgment on itself; only it can know and sense the true extent of what\n  it accomplished, or neglected to accomplish, in the course of its\n  physical life. <strong>Freed from the limitations and concealments of the\n  physical state, it can now see G‑dliness; it can now look back at its\n  own life and experience what it truly was.</strong> The soul’s experience of\n  the G‑dliness it brought into the world with its mitzvot and positive\n  actions is the exquisite pleasure of Gan Eden (the “Garden of\n  Eden”—Paradise); its experience of the destructiveness it wrought\n  through its lapses and transgressions is the excruciating pain of\n  Gehinnom (“Gehenna” or “Purgatory”).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/282508/jewish/What-Happens-After-Death.htm#footnote2a282508\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a> at length.

It (the light) assumed the appearance of a finger opposite the Tablets corresponding to the dimensions of the requisite letter G'd wanted to inscribe. G'd did this in order to ensure that no more and no less than the letter should be engraved on the Tablets themselves. Seeing that the light G'd used to do this with was more powerful than the light the Tablets were made of, the light of the \"finger\" penetrated the requisite area of the Tablets. We may perceive of that area on the Tablets as having either been devoured or pushed aside. What remained were holes forming the letters G'd had engraved. Thanks to the superior power of the light of the \"finger\" the inscription became visible from either side of the Tablets. This is what is meant when the Torah wrote in 32,16, that the Tablets were written from both sides, i.e. that the inscription was deeply engraved. The Torah uses the expression חרות על הלוחות \"engraved on the Tablets,\" instead of saying חדות בלוחות, engraved in the Tablets. This is the allusion to G'd having placed His finger \"on\" i.e. opposite the material of the Tablets as we have explained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Their characters were suited to the positions they held, they could not perform the role of the other.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Saks points to the pasuk in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16306#v=11&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 85:11</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a wonderful Midrash that bears out this idea, based on the\n  verse in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16306#v=11&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 85:11</a> “Loving-kindness and truth meet together;\n  righteousness and peace kiss each other.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Loving-kindness – this refers to Aaron. Truth – this refers to Moses.\n  Righteousness – this refers to Moses. Peace – this refers to\n  Aaron.<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.5.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot Rabbah\n  5:10</a></p>\n  \n  <p>The Midrash brings proof-texts for each of these identifications, but\n  we understand them immediately. Moses and Aaron were quite different\n  in temperament and role. Moses was the man of truth, Aaron of peace.\n  Without truth, there can be no vision to inspire a nation. But without\n  internal peace, there is no nation to inspire. Aaron and Moses were\n  both necessary. Their roles were in creative tension. Yet they worked\n  side by side, each respecting the distinctive gift of the other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9893#showrashi=true&v=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ki Sisa 32:1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That which Aaron was to make was not to take the place of Hashem, but\n  of Moses. They presumed that Moses had had an accident and was dead,\n  and so they wanted Aaron to give them a \"Moses\" whom they could not\n  lose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus any other human being could not, in their minds, take the place of \"Moses\" and they would have to <em>create</em> a permanent replacement that could never be lost.</p>\n\n\n",

They check the calories, reduce the size of their meals\nand reduce the number of foods that they eat. But all this does not\nadd joy.  In order to say  Grace after Meals with “with happiness and\nwith gladness of heart” one needs to eat a olive's bulk of bread and\nthe condition of “with happiness and with gladness of heart” is an\nintrinsic part of the mitzva.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbis Munk and Tauber say that the fulfilling the mitzvos should be a source of happiness and gladness of heart. Rav Tauber says that the happiness is intrinsic to the mitzva.</p>\n<p>So not eating bread to avoid saying Grace after Meals displays a state of mind which is not as it should be. It seems that someone who has such a state of mind needs to work on it so that he can progress to saying  Grace after Meals as it should be said. His Rabbi may pronounce on whether he should avoid eating bread until then.</p>\n\n\n",

If I'm not back on the 17 of Tamus and you don't hear anything from me I herein appoint Aharon to be my replacement.

Moshe, therefore, doesn't have the authority to appoint others.  If something were to happen to Moshe while he was in God's care (<em>chas v'shalom</em>), then we should expect that either God will appoint a new leader or the <em>brit</em> will be broken and it won't matter who is nominally in charge because chaos is about to commence.  (Korach's probably wouldn't be the only faction trying to seize control.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't have sources; I offer the following reasons in support of what I say:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>God, not Moshe, chose Yehoshua as Moshe's successor and even controlled the timing.</p></li>\n<li><p>God, not humans, appointed prophets throughout our history to carry God's word to the people.</p></li>\n<li><p>The system of \"lower courts\" for answering questions was for interpreting <em>halacha</em> that had already been given; this is stuff that Moshe could \"offload\" because it didn't require any further divine input.  Cases that do require God's input, like that of the daughters of Tzelofechad, go all the way up.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We cannot assume that, if something <em>had</em> happened to Moshe on the mountain, Aharon would be next in line.  God might have chosen somebody else.  It's not up to Moshe.  The roles of priest and prophet are different.</p>\n\n\n",

The underlying vowel phoneme in such cases is always /a/, which is called a \"changeable vowel\" by some grammar books.  segol is a form of vowel reduction (like sheva) that can apply to either /a/ or /e/.  When words like גֶשם are not lengthened, the vowel takes this reduced form.  (Also, note that in some communities - notably the Teimanim - segol is pronounced like the \"a\" in the \"apple\".  So ancient segol might have been closer in sound to kamatz than tzere.  Of course, no one knows for sure.)</p>\n\n\n",

Then I remembered that Korach had an issue with a beged that was full of techeiles that it forsure shouldn't need techeiles based off logic that if a small string of techeiles paturs a full beged then a full beged of techeiles should certainly not need . </p>\n\n<p>Then I thought that Korach was speaking of the Me'il specifically. I reasoned that Korachs issue was that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/31972/759\">the Me'il wasn't required in tzizts (techeiles)</a> and so certainly any full beged of techeiles wouldn't need techeiles and the fact that the Chachamim (Moshe Rabbeinu) said that a full beged does need then why doesn't the Me'il need,must be they are making things up (Korachs reasoning). Has anyone seen a peirush which has such an idea that Korach was talking about the Me'il? I do believe the Tanchuma which brings this story uses the lashon of beged זו , meaning Korach had a specific beged as an example.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Midrash Tanchuma when explaining Korach's argument calls it a טלית שכולה תכלת, a garment made entirely of <em>techeiles</em>.

That said, there are some who have explained his argument as referring to the <em>me'il</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yisrael_Ariel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

In fact, the descriptions given in the Parshah are incredible precise and clear. One could actually (re)create the garments fairly accurate based upon the Torah descriptions. There is nothing vague in the instructions, I'd say.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I understand (and I don't understand a single thing) the garments were to be worn exclusively in the Mishkan and possibly in the first and second temple, on Yom Kippur special requirements were to be met. \nWhat do our sages say regarding recreating the garments and wear them during communal service even though the third temple is still not around? Would it be disrespectful to dress in that particular way even though there no temple nor Mishkan arose in the present time? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is <a href=\"https://www.templeinstitute.org/about.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an institute in Jerusalem</a> that seeks to recreate them to have them ready at some point in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, using them today is misguided. At the bare minimum, they contained a mix of wool and linen, which is prohibited to wear unless specifically commanded to do so, i.e. by priests in the Temple.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan notes this in his <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=28#C1721\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus 28:40</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"sash\" -- Avnet in Hebrew. ... It was made of linen embroidered with colored wool (Yoma 12b; Yad, Kley HaMikdash 8:1).

The kohen gadol had several additional garments that contained both wool and linen.)</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, the Torah repeatedly stresses that there is exactly one Temple service.

When the Holy One, blessed be He, sent for Jonah, to prophesy against (the city) its de­struction, Pharaoh hearkened and arose from his throne, rent his garments and clothed himself in sackcloth and ashes, and had a proclamation made to all his people, that all the people should fast for two days, and all who did these (wicked) things should be burnt by fire. What did they do? The men were on one side, and the women on the other, and their children were by themselves; all the clean animals were on one side, and their offspring were by themselves. The infants saw the breasts of their mothers, they wished to have suck, and they wept. The mothers saw their children, (and they wished) to give them suck.

He is told that as long as he does not commit any further crimes, he will not have to pay. If he does commit another crime, he will have to pay both what is owed for the future crime but also for the original debt. This is not that a person is being punished for what his ancestor did, but he is being punished for what he did as well as the debt that was already owed.</p>\n\n<p>Note that when we say that a person is not punished for what his father did, that only means that he does not continue to sin. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, this is something that applies to the entire nation, such as the meraglim or the destruction of the temple. It does not necessarily mean the sin of an individual.</p>\n\n<p>The Bnai Yisrael caused themselves to be lowered in the level of spirituality by sinning with the <em>aigel hazahav</em>. They were not punished fully as they would have deserved. Thus, every sin (as a people) that is done, includes the results of that sin as well. For example Mikraos Gedolos <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Shemot/32.34#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ki Sisa 32:34 </a> cites <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Isaac_Bekhor_Shor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yosef Bechor Shor</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וביום פקדי ופקדתי עליהם חטאתם</strong> – כלומר: אני מוחל להם עתה, שלא יזוקו בדבר זה, כל זמן שלא יוסיפו לחטא. אבל אם יוסיפו לחטא, כשאפקד עליהם החטא\n  שיעשו, אפקוד גם זה עמו. כאדם שאומר לחבירו: אני מוחל לך כל זמן שלא תוסף\n  לעשות, אבל אם תוסף, לא דיי שלא אמחול, אלא שאפקוד עליך גם מה שעשית עתה.</p>\n  \n  <p>That is to say that I will forgive them now, so that they will not be\n  harmed by this matter, as long as they do not continue to sin. But if\n  they continue to sin , when I judge them for the sin that they do, I\n  will also judge this also with it. Like a person whio says to his\n  friend: I forgive you as long as you do not continue to do [this], but\n  if you continue, it is not enough that I will not forgive you, but I\n  will judge what you did now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is like someone who receives a suspended sentence and is released on parole. If he commits another crime, his parole is revoked and he must serve the original sentence as well as whatever punishment is due to the next crime.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that this is a matter of the entire people having to raise themselves back to the level they had been at during matan Torah. As a result, every sin that occurs <strong>as a people</strong> needs to take into account the level that the people are at, and what has caused them to be reduced to that level.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You have to enter a future on the basis of the sin not being atoned\n  for - a future which has to raise the people to a higher standard by\n  passing the most testing experiences of trying events, and so attain\n  atonement. A complete forgiveness, a lifting off of the sin, making it\n  as if it had not occurred (נשא) would imply that the people were\n  already back to the stage of moral elevation at which they were when\n  they were when they received the Torah ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dessler</a> in Michtav Me'Eliyahu can explain this using the <em>Nekudas Habechira</em> (point of free will)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He states that a man has one point in\n  his service to G-d where he has to fight his evil inclination, while\n  at other points there will be no struggle, for the levels below this\n  have already been conquered, and he will easily win those battles of\n  will; whereas levels higher are not yet within his grasp. (For\n  example, someone who adheres to Orthodox Judaism will have no problem\n  keeping kosher, but may sometimes be tempted to rely on unreliable\n  kosher supervision, while somebody farther away from religious\n  practice will have to struggle with whether to eat a ham sandwich\n  (which is non-kosher regardless of supervision).) Each time one\n  defeats the evil inclination by choosing to do good over evil, his\n  Nekudas Habechira is raised a bit higher, and that choice will be\n  easier for him to make in the future. Consequently, Man's task in life\n  is to consistently raise his Nekudas Habechira, thus growing ever\n  greater in his service of God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>chet ha'aigel</em> lowered the <em>nekudas habechira</em> to such an extent that all of Bnai Yisrael was reduced to a level so that any future sin became possible only as a result of what they did. As an example, had they not allowed the <em>chait ha'aigel</em> to occur, they would not have panicked and sinned when the meraglim brought the bad report of the land. Indeed, it is quite possible that the meraglim themselves would not have rationalized themselves into bringing that report in the first place. Had they not sinned, they might have been able to avoid the destruction of the mishkan at Shiloh or of the temple.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I occasionally ask people a parallel question on my way to work. \"Some guy I never met stole some kind of fruit I can't even identify, and therefore <strong>I</strong> have to go to work?

Why are descendents paying for the sin of the ancestor?</p>\n\n<p>The case of our still feeling the Golden Calf (or the Forbidden Fruit) goes far beyond the text in Shemos: \"פֹּקֵד עֲוֹן אָבוֹת עַל בָּנִים וְעַל בְּנֵי בָנִים עַל שִׁלֵּשִׁים וְעַל רִבֵּעִים -- who remembers [and acts on] the sin of the ancestors on the children, the grandchildren, the third [generation] and the fourth.\" (Shemos 37:7, Bamidbar 14:18) or \"עַל בָּנִים עַל שִׁלֵּשִׁים וְעַל רִבֵּעִים לְשֹׂנְאָי -- ... to those who hate Me (I \"Hate\"?)\" (Shemos 20:5)</p>\n\n<p>On that last verse, Rashi quotes the Targum, \"כְּשֶׁאוֹחֲזִין מַעֲשֵׂה אֲבוֹתֵיהֶם בִּידֵיהֶם -- when they hold their ancestors' actions in their hands.\" (And then continues to note that unlike punishment, reward is not limited to 4 generations.)</p>\n\n<p>But in the case of the Golden Calf, that doesn't really fit. We aren't still a bunch of idolaters. For that matter, that kind of idolatry isn't even part of the human psychological makeup anymore; as the Talmud put it, the rabbis and prophets of the Great Assembly trapped the <em>yeitzer hara</em> for idolatry in a lead pot. (Yuma 66b) So we can't still be feeling the punishment of the sins of our ancestors far more than 4 generations later because we aren't \"holding their deeds in our hands\", we aren't continuing from their example.</p>\n\n<p>But there is another possibility. If my ancestor 15 generations ago had a chance to build a palace, I would could have been living in an ancient palace. But since none of them (that I know of) did build that palace, I don't have that opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Adam and Eve could have built one kind of world. We had that kind of world for 40 days with the revelation at Sinai. At least the Jewish People did, charged to bring it to everyone else. We would have lived forever. Then, with the Golden Calf, we plummeted back to the post-fruit plane of existence. This is why Medrash Tanchuma (Chuqas 8, quoted by Rashi, Bamidbar 19:22) explains the use of a red heiffer in particular is used to remove the <em>tum'ah</em> after contact with the dead; \"מָשָׁל לְבֶן שִׁפְחָה שֶׁטִּנֵּף פָּלָטִין שֶׁל מֶלֶךְ, אָמְרוּ תָּבֹא אִמּוֹ וּתְקַנֵּחַ הַצּוֹאָה, כָּךְ תָּבֹא פָרָה וּתְכַפֵּר עַל הָעֵגֶל -- it may be [explained by a] parable of a handmaid’s child that soiled the king’s palace. They said: Let the mother come and clean up the excrement. Similarly: since they became defiled by [the Golden] Calf, let its mother [a cow] come and atone for the calf.\"</p>\n\n<p>Our ancestors moved to a bad neighborhood, in a spiritual sense. We're stuck with what it's like to live in a bad neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, you could continue as per Rav Hirsch and R Dessler as cited in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/99643/1570\">Sabba Hillel's answer</a>. I just think this metaphor avoids many of the comments raised in answer to his post. The Bechor Shor talks about inherited debt; I think the later sources talk more in terms of what the good we failed to \"inherit\".</p>\n\n<p>But it's time to stop worrying about why and make sure <em>our</em> descendents 15 generations from now aren't complaining about the palace we didn't leave them!</p>\n\n\n",

Tikrovet has the same din as AZ itself.

That is an allusion to Moshiach ben Yosef. The first posuk states explicitly that Yehoshuah is standing before \"the Angel of G-d\", and then clarifies who that angel is by name as the Satan, whose job is to accuse and prosecute.</p>\n\n<p>In Zechariah 3:2, it goes on to explain that G-d says to the Satan what his job will be. Meaning that the Satan will rebuke/accuse in regard to Yehoshuah, HaKohen HaGadol who is the one who is chosen by G-d in regard to Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<p>According to traditional Jewish teaching, the Heavenly figure referred in the prophecy as Yehoshuah HaKohen Gadol is Moshiach. This is the same name for example, that was referenced by <a href=\"http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/23877/Default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchok Kaduri, zt\"l in a handwritten note made famous toward the end of his life</a>. It associates the Kohen Gadol to Moshiach like is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.4.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">VaYikra 4:3</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אִ֣ם הַכֹּהֵ֧ן הַמָּשִׁ֛יחַ יֶחֱטָ֖א לְאַשְׁמַ֣ת הָעָ֑ם וְהִקְרִ֡יב עַ֣ל חַטָּאתוֹ֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר חָטָ֜א פַּ֣ר בֶּן־בָּקָ֥ר תָּמִ֛ים לַיהוָ֖ה לְחַטָּֽאת׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which Sefaria translates as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If it is the anointed priest who has incurred guilt, so that blame falls upon the people,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So to answer the <em>Why</em> aspect of your question, this means that the blame for the <em>sin</em> of the Moshiach lays with the Jewish people. As their representative, meaning the representative of the whole nation, <em>the Tzibbur</em>, Moshiach brings the korban.</p>\n\n<p>The angel referred to in this prophecy is, according to traditional Jewish teaching, pertaining to Armilus HaRasha, who is also called the embodiment in this world of \"the Satan\". An example of this can be seen in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38251&st=&pgnum=29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Avkat Rochel by Rabbeinu Makir ben Abba Mori in the first book, Section 1, Sign 7</a> of the ten signs of Moshiach.</p>\n\n<p>Zechariah's prophecy here is explaining how the struggle between Moshiach and Armilus, who is also referred to by the Christians as the \"anti-Christ\", is actually directed by G-d.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of this prophecy is also referenced in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.56.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit Rabbah 56:9-11</a> which associates it with the <em>Binding of Yitzchok</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Moreover, matzah is eaten because there was no time for bread to rise when the Jews went out of Egypt (this is attested in numerous places, including <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.16.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut. 16:3</a>), and this has not happened yet, so either way, I do not see why they would eat it.</p>\n\n<p>How exactly is this supposed to be rationalized? Or is this supposed to simply be a coincidental prefiguration of Pesach in some shape or form?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is not a simple question, but I'll try to keep on the Pshat path. Here's the simple logic of saying what he's saying:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Obviously, because the Midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereishit_Rabbah.48.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B\"R 48,12</a>) says that Avraham meeting the angels took place on Pesach, and afterward, the angels went straight to Lot, therefore with Lot, it was Pesach time too (adn Rashi refers to that Midrash).</p></li>\n<li><p>So was Lot on Avraham's side or not? Was he good or bad? The Torah says he served Matzos - Rashi uses it to stress that Lot was as observant as Avraham.</p></li>\n<li><p>Rashi, traditionally, never dives into philosophical questions of logicality and consistency even with hos other interpretations.

There is nothing about wings and belching smoke and fire.

Thus, we learn in the Baraita, \"If it is the form of a <em>dirakon</em>, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar explains, 'All (snakes) that have blossoms (like the petals of a flower) between the neck joints like fins, which it (meaning the snake) prepares to strike (meaning to bite) with them. But (if the image of the snake is) without the blossoms, it isn't restricted. That it (meaning such an image) isn't made for idol worship, rather for worldly ornamentation.</p>\n\n<p>The Baraita which Rabbi Yehonatan is quoting is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Avodah_Zarah.6.1?vhe=Tosefta_Avodah_Zarah_-_Machon_Mamre&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta to Avodah Zarah, 6:1</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is also worth pointing out that the specific type of avodah zarah described can still be seen in the world among both the Yazidi people in Iraq and among the Hindus.

    "title": "What exactly is the meaning of \"I will hide [haster asteir] my face on that day?\"",
    "content": "# What exactly is the meaning of \"I will hide [haster asteir] my face on that day?\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong><em>[This is a long and complicated question, but if you want just scroll down to the end summary to get the main points]</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>It says in the Talmud <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.139b.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin Daf 139b</a>, it says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Where is Ester from the Torah? The verse says, \"and I will hide\n  (hasteir asteir) my face on that day\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi there (apparently he had a different Girsa slightly as seen from the Dibur Hamashchil):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>למעשה אסתר - הסתר אסתיר בימי אסתר יהיה הסתר פנים ומצאוהו צרות רבות\n  ורעות:\n  [Where do we know about] <strong>the story Of Ester</strong> --  Conceal, I will conceal; in the days of Ester there will be a concealment of [Hashem's] face, troubles and tribulations will find them [seemingly the Jewish people].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Haster Asteir and Ester rhyme, and are even from the same root, but how exactly is the verse translated accordingly? I think Rashi is somehow alluding to how the verse is translated after the drasha, but I don't fully understand it: is the verse translated \"I will Ester-ize [/hide] my face on that day\" -- referring to the days of Ester? I don't get how the words Hasteir Asteir fit after the drasha, do they still just mean \"hide\", or do they mean \"I will hide in the times of Ester\" specifically? I just don't get the connection exactly. And also, why does Rashi even say at the beginning \"הסתר אסתיר\"? Seemingly the next part he says \"בימי אסתר יהיה הסתר פנים\" is already a full statement, so it couldn't (?) be translated as \"conceal I will conceal <strong>in the days of Ester</strong> etc..\" because that's already part of the next statement, so how is Rashi translated exactly, why does he start off by saying \"Conceal, I will conceal\"? That's what the Gemara just said but <strong>how does it fit into the verse</strong> (and the beginning of Rashi)?</p>\n\n<p>BTW: I totally get that it means how Hashem will hide his presence etc. which could have a lot of side effects, like the miracles being invested in nature and the people not feeling Hashem's presence during the times of Ester (and exile in general, which is the simple meaning), but still I don't understand how to literally translate the verse after the drasha, are the words \"Hide, I will hide\" replaced with \"Ester, I will Ester\"?</p>\n\n<p>So I do (relatively) understand the actual simple meaning in Devarim, where Hashem tells Moshe that in the time of the exile his face will be hidden, but even regarding that detail in the simple meaning (and also in the Gemara's drasha), I don't get what it means \"on <strong>that</strong> day\", is the entire golus / story of Ester just in one day? Does it refer to the first day that it will happen, why does it say \"In that day\" and not just \"at that time\" or something??</p>\n\n<p>So so far I have 2 main questions on the verse:\n1) According to even the simple meaning, what does \"on that day\" mean, if the exile is more than a day</p>\n\n<p>2) According to the Gemara's drasha, how do you translate the words \"Hasteir Asteir\", if they still both mean literally hidden, then how does Ester fit in <strong>with the verse</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>Also in <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/toraor/23/93d.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Ohr page 93D</a> at the bottom it says, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנה כנס\"י נקראת בשם אסתר על שם ואנכי הסתר אסתיר פני ביום ההוא. כי פני\n  ה' שהוא גילוי שכינתו כמ\"ש יאר ה' פניו אליך הוא עכשיו בזמן הגלות מסותרת\n  בבחי' ביום ההוא (כי יום ההוא מורה על יום שאינו נראה ונגלה משא\"כ יום\n  הזה). ודרך פרט בכל נפש מישראל הנה כאשר בחי' נצוץ נפשו האלהית הוא מכוסה\n  ומלובש בלבושי מחשבה דבור מעשה הגשמיים ואין אור ה' שורה ומתגלה בו להיות\n  נתפס ונקבע במוחו ולבו האהבה לה' לדבקה בו בהתגלות הלב כי אם בבחי' מקיף</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically that the Jewish people are called \"Ester\" -- \"al sheim\" our verse \"and I will hide my face on that day\", and he said that during <strong>the golus</strong>, the revelation of the Shechina (his face) is hidden in (a <strong>different</strong> spiritual level known as \"that day\" (see below from the Tzemach Tzedek and other parts of Torah Ohr) , so I don't really get it, in the simple meaning \"on that day\" is referring to the exile itself, so how do you translate the verse according to this, what does \"on that day\" refer to, and does it / how does it also imply the time of the exile if it also refers o a specific spiritual level? </p>\n\n<p>Regarding what that exact spiritual level is, earlier in <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/toraor/23/92a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Ohr page 92a</a> in the middle it says that the level of \"on that day\" refers to \"bina, and \"my face\" refers to malchus, how it hides itself at the beginning of bria, and that's why the level of atik (of bria) is called \"I will hide..<em>in</em> that day\", because the level of malchus of atzilus (atik of bria) hides itself in Bina of bria, since the revelation of atik is generally in bina\", and then he explains, \"that means that the level of \"my face\" refers to the level of keser-malchus (which I'm not sure if that refers to malchus of atzilus or malchus of keser of atzilus), because malchus (in general) doesn't have anything for itself, and it only takes in from the \"ten kings\", and [this part I don't really get so I'd like someone to explain it], \"keser accepts from malchus of keser, which is the level of \"my face\"..</p>\n\n<p>So basically a summary of the Torah Ohr's explanation (which I sill don't fully get): </p>\n\n<p>\"I will hide my face on that day\", he says that Hashem's \"face\" refers to the revelation of his Shechina (which even according to the simple meaning seems to fit), and this revelation of the Shechina is hidden, in the time of the galus, in a spritiual state known as \"that day\". So before even getting into what spiritual state \"that day\" is referring to, I first need to even understand where is the implication that \"the revelation of His Shechina\" is hidden in the spiritual state known as \"that day\", <strong>in the time of galus</strong>, seemingly \"on that day\" itself is referring to the time of the Golus, so if it's also referring to a spiritual level that \"His face\" is hidden in, how does it <em>also</em> imply golus?</p>\n\n<p>Also, he says in Torah Ohr at the beginning of the Maamar Vayoshet Hamalech (quoted first above) that \"Knesses Yisroel (the Jewish people in general) are called Ester <strong>al sheim</strong> \"and I will hasteir asteir panai bayom hahu...\", and even in the back of the Torah Ohr, the Gemara in Chullin isn't even quoted, although this uses the same verse as the Gemara, it seems to be saying something totally different. The Gemara says simply that this is an allusion to Ester, and in Torah Ohr it seems to say that this verse is referring to the entire Jewish people, so if someone can explain that that would be great..</p>\n\n<p>So according to the Gemara, first of all, what is the actual simple explanation of the verse, and then how does it change exactly in the Torah Ohr?</p>\n\n<p>In Ohr HaTorah Megillas Ester page 111, commenting to the Torah Ohr maamer, he says (rough translation): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“That day” means the level of bina, which is called “He/that”, and\n  bina nests in “the throne”, the world of briah, which is the level of\n  “he creates darkness”, a helem and hester, and the level of malchus\n  which is made atik to briah, it hides itself  “in that day” (in the\n  level of bina), and it doesn’t become revealed below, so if so there\n  is to explain that the level of “that day” is the world to come, which\n  also conceals itself, since it (malchus of atzilus which I guess is\n  the revelation of the world to come?) is made an atik to bria, which a\n  makif and hidden, and “this day” -- that means the level of za (of\n  atzilus?) which nests in yetzira (so is that referring to Z”a of\n  atzilus how it goes in and mainly manifests itself in yetzira? He just\n  says Z”a so seemingly that refers to that of atzilus, and if so then\n  the bina mentioned before is also from atzilus, only that it “nests”\n  in briah), and yetzira is the level of “he forms light” -- the level\n  of revelation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>that when Hashem's face is concealed in the level of \"that day\" it refers to how Malchus -- Hashem's Shechina (and it said in Torah Ohr that \"my face\" refers to a revelation of his Shechina), is concealed in \"bina\" of Bria, which is referred to \"that\" day (and not \"this\"), since Bria in general is the \"world of darkness\" (relative to us, since it's so far beyond us) and also bina (where \"my face\" is concealed) is a high level of Bria which can't be grasped, but the level of \"this\" day in general is a lower level, that of the revelation of Z\"a how it goes even lower, into the world of Yetirah (I guess he's referring to Z\"a of <strong>Atzilus</strong> how it goes into Yetzirah, and seemingly just because the higher something is, the lower it goes like it says in Tanya regarding this...).</p>\n\n<p>So it's clear that according to Torah Ohr \"that day\" is a very specific spiritual level, so how does it <em>also</em> imply the time of Galus? Is it maybe based on later in the maamer and in the tzemach tzedek notes, when it says that \"that day\" (bina of bria) will become revealed to us and transformed to \"this day\" (in a higher way than Z\"a of Yetzirah, since Z\"a of Yetzirah is only the level of \"this\" because it's lower and more accessible to us, but when bina of bria is transformed into \"this day\" it means that even the higher, normally concealed level of \"that\" day is transformed into \"this\" - a revelation, just to explain this a little better here's the rest of the Torah Ohr paragraph (continuing a few lines after we left off above, first link):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהיא מסותרת בבחי' ביום ההוא שאינה בהתגלות. והיא בחי' נקודה בהיכלא\n  בפנימיות נקודת לבו ודאי מסותרת היא האהבה בכל נפש מישראל ואין לך אדם\n  שאין לו בחי' פנימיות זו אלא שלהוציא מההעלם אל הגילוי אינה שוה בכל אדם.\n  ולכן לימות המשיח שאז יזדכך האדם אזי יהיה בבחי' ונגלה כבוד ה' וראו כל\n  בשר וגו'. ואמר ביום ההוא הנה אלהינו זה קוינו לו וגו'. פי' שיאיר אור ה'\n  בהתגלות עד שיהא נתפס ונקבע אפי' במוחו ושכל אנושי וראו כל בשר בראיה\n  גשמית חושיית כי אלהינו הוא בחי' זה אשר לזה קוינו לו ולא בבחי' ההוא:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>that in the future the \"hidden\" part of the soul, known as Ester, which is hidden in the level of \"on that day\" (of the soul, and also of Hashem),  will be revealed and what is usually \"that\" will become \"this\".. </p>\n\n<p>but still, <strong>how does all this imply that on \"that day\" refers to exile?</strong> (true that during exile the level of \"that\" day is in fact hidden, \"that\" and in the future it will be \"this\", so \"that day\" alludes in some way to the exile, but how do you translate it in the verse?) </p>\n\n<p>Also <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/admur/tm/19/13/index.htm#_ftnref_896\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">related</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ידוע הפירוש7 שסיפור המגילה רומז על כנס\"י והקב\"ה, שאסתר קאי על כנס\"י8\n  בהיותה בזמן הגלות שנקראת בשם אסתר, ע\"ש ואנכי9 הסתר אסתיר פני ביום\n  ההוא10, והמלך אחשורוש זה מלכו של עולם11 שאחרית וראשית שלו12</p>\n  \n  <p>7) ראה ס' מחיר יין (להרמ\"א), ומנות הלוי (לר\"ש אלקבץ) – על מג\"א.</p>\n  \n  <p>8) ראה מאמרי אדהאמ\"צ שם ע' שמט.</p>\n  \n  <p>9) וילך לא, יח.</p>\n  \n  <p>10) תו\"א מג\"א צג, סע\"ד. צד, ריש ע\"ד. ובכ\"מ. אוה\"ת שם ס\"ע טו. ד\"ה ויהי\n  אומן את הדסה עטר\"ת (סה\"מ עטר\"ת ע' שח ואילך). תשי\"ג (תו\"מ ח\"ח ע' 7\n  ואילך). תשכ\"ד.</p>\n  \n  <p>11) ראה תו\"א שם קכ, ב. אוה\"ת שם ע' נח.</p>\n  \n  <p>12) מאורי אור א, קפב. הובא באוה\"ת שם ס\"ע כד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So, just to summarize, four questions:</strong> (getting ready for Pesach)</p>\n\n<p>1) In the simple meaning, why does Hashem say (to Moshe) that he will hide his face in the times of the exile, by saying \"on that day\"? How does \"that day\" imply the time of golus, isn't golus more than just a day?</p>\n\n<p>2) In the Gemeara's explanation, that \"Hasteir Asteir\" <em>alludes</em> how Hashem will be hidden during <strong>story</strong> of Ester, how does it actually <em>translate back into the verse??</em> And how does the beginning of Rashi's comment explain this (because I think it does) and why is it even there, it doesn't seem to fit into a full sentence (see above).</p>\n\n<p>3) In Torah Ohr, it says that when the verse says \"I will hide my face on [or according to Torah Ohr, it's really translated as \"<strong>in</strong>\"] that day\", it explains that that means that in the time of exile, his face is (also?) concealed in a spiritual level of \"that day\" (see above from the Tzemach Tzedek what exactly that level is). Seemingly it has something to do with the fact that during the exile, we all receive from Hashem's \"face\" (malchus of Atzilus) as it's concealed <em>in</em> the spiritual level of \"that day\", bina of briah, and it's called \"that\" because it's something that's concealed (as opposed to \"this\" which you can point at directly -- like \"this is my G-d and I will glorify him...\"), but that's only in the times of the exile, but like he says later in that same paragraph in Torah Ohr (and see the notes to the Tzemach Tzedek there, page 112), that in the future what is normally considered \"that\" day (bina of bria), since it is so distance and removed from us (because of it's great level), will be transformed into \"this\" day, because even the hidden-ness will be reveleaed, and what is normally only \"that\" because it's so far removed will be easily felt by everyone in a way of \"this\", in the times of Moshiach, so seemingly that is the relation between \"that\" day and exile, but still, <em>how does it translate back into the verse ???</em> I will hide my face \"in exile\" or \"I will hide it in Bina of Briah,  thereby resulting in it being hidden in the time of the exile\"?</p>\n\n<p>4) In Torah Ohr, it says that the Jewish people are called Ester like it says in the verse \"and I will hasteir asteir panai on that day\" (meaning that we're called Ester not just from the word \"hide\" in the verse, but as seemed there, from the entire verse), and he then goes on to say how every Jew has a \"hidden\" level of his soul known as \"Ester\" because it is hidden within a level of his soul known as \"that\" day, which implies a deeper, hidden part of the soul which is beyond revelation, since \"this\" means something that you can directly point at -- a revelation of something, but \"that\" is a word used to describe something that's not in front of you, it implies a concealment. SO anyway I still am trying to figure out <strong>this</strong> explanation, since it seems different than the Gemara in the sense that here it says that <strong>we're called</strong> Ester al sheim the entire verse, but in the Gemara it just says \"where is an allusion to Ester\"....</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You seem to have 3 questions: </p>\n\n<p>Q1: What does the verse <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9995#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devorim 31 (18)</a> “And I will hide My face on that day, because of all the evil they have committed, when they turned to other deities” have to do with Esther?  </p>\n\n<p>Q2: From Torah Ohr page 93D </p>\n\n<p>Q3: From Torah Ohr page 92a </p>\n\n<p>I will attempt to answer the first.</p>\n\n<p>The short answer is this: The miracles of Purim were performed by Hashem without revealing Himself. The verse tells us that a time will come when Hashem will operate in a way in which His part in the actions will be hidden from us. The time of Purim was such a time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/holidays/purim/article_cdo/aid/480943/jewish/Miracles-Masked.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a> puts it like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some divine interventions are as plain as day. Like walls of water,\n  manna from heaven, and stopping the sun. These are the heroic,\n  supernatural displays that only the Master of the universe could pull\n  off. It's as if He painted an extravaganza and signed His name in the\n  middle in fluorescent orange, \"I am the L-rd your G‑d.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Then there are miracles like Purim — understated, implicit, devoid of\n  fanfare, completely enclothed in the ebb and flow of the vagaries of\n  nature and society. Like an anonymous tapestry, the Scroll of\n  Esther—the Megillah--weaves an intricate, real-life drama that does\n  not even once mention the name of G‑d, so well disguised is His hand\n  in the story.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aish.com/h/pur/t/har/48965501.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aish.com</a> says (edited):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Book of Esther is the only book in the Bible which does not\n  mention G-d.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Book of Esther takes place six decades after the destruction of\n  the First Temple. This cataclysmic event changed the way that God\n  relates to human beings. While the Temple brought the Divine Presence\n  into explicit manifestation (witness the ten open miracles everyone\n  could see there), with its destruction, the Divine Presence receded\n  into a state of hiddenness.</p>\n  \n  <p>The sages called this still prevailing modus operandi hester panim,\n  meaning \"hidden face.\" from the same root word as the name Esther.\n  Megillat Esther, the Scroll of Esther, can as well be translated: \"the\n  Scroll of Hiddenness.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>If someone is hiding, it means he is there, but you can't see him.\n  Nevertheless, certain signs, such as a bulge in the curtain, may hint\n  at his whereabouts. The Book of Esther is full of coincidences, the\n  right person \"happening\" to be in the right place at the right time,\n  and dramatic, unexpected reversals of fortune. These are the bulges in\n  the curtains that hint at the Divine orchestration of events. A\n  witness can choose to attribute such serendipitous happenings to\n  \"luck\" or to G-d.</p>\n  \n  <p>Our challenge since the destruction of the First Temple is to find God\n  hiding behind the curtain of history, to identify the Divine hand\n  behind current events, and to recognize God's direction in the\n  seemingly fortuitous occurrences of our own lives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I did not see any other commentary (from those available on Sefaria) who made a similar connection to Amalek.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are two aspects to your question.</p>\n\n<p>The first is to try to determine if the text for Rashi’s comments to Tehillim 75:11 as found in the Sefaria version is correct and accurate or not.</p>\n\n<p>Then, the second aspect is to address your primary question as stated in the heading and recapped in your closing paragraph.</p>\n\n<p>On the first aspect, the accuracy of text of Rashi on Tehillim, the authoritative and critical edition of Rashi’s commentary on Psalms by <a href=\"https://prabook.com/web/mayer_irwin.gruber/553355\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi, Professor Mayer I. Gruber</a> republished in paperback by JPS in 2004 is important.</p>\n\n<p>As Gruber discusses in detail in pages 158-164, after reviewing over 60 extant handwritten manuscripts, most dating from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, he determined that virtually all printed editions, including Parshandatha by <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/maarsen-isaac\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchok Maarsen</a> are corrupted and inaccurate. Gruber goes on to explain that he relied primarily on two handwritten manuscripts known as Oppenheim 34 and Vienna 220. The details of why are quite interesting and worth the read if you can find a copy of Gruber’s book, which is currently in print.</p>\n\n<p>The correct text of Rashi to Tehillim 75:11 for the words, “וכל קרני רשעי׳״ is actually:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>של עשו הרשע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no mention of Amalek whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>It then adds a <em>final Mem</em> to עגדע<strong>ם</strong> to indicate that <em>they</em>, the <em>Rasha’im</em> from Esav will be cut down, and continues with the citation from Ezekial 25:14.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כעניין שנ׳ ונתתי נקמתי באדום ביד עמי ישר׳ ישר׳ יגדעו קרן עשו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So that resolves your question about the discrepancy concerning the mention of Amalek, which is not found in the Navi Rashi cites. The correct text of Rashi is consistent and accurate with the appropriate Navi.</p>\n\n<p>The second aspect of your question, about what the meaning of this <em>horn</em> is in regard to Esav, can be found in the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/Strzyzow/str010.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eliezer Fishel ben Rabbi Yitzchok of Krakow</a> to his super commentary <em>Parshat Eliezer</em> to Sefer Karnayim with the commentary of <a href=\"http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Shimshon_ben_Pesah_of_Ostropolye\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shimshon of Ostropole</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7434&st=&pgnum=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">n paragraphs 3 and 4,</a> he explains how the concept of <em>horn</em> (קרן) as it pertains to Israel in the context of the final redemption means <em>Moshiach</em> like is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Habakkuk.3.4?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Habakkuk 3:4</a> which says, “קרנים מידו לו”. He goes on to explain how this is referring to both Moshiach ben Yosef and Moshiach ben David.</p>\n\n<p>As he explains further on in the book in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7434&st=&pgnum=88\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the 14th discourse</a>, just as there is a <em>Moshiach</em> for Israel (actually two, ben Yosef and ben David) the side of Holiness, there is also an <em>anti-Moshiach</em> for the <em>other side</em>. In the context of Tehillim 75:11, (וכל קרני רשעים של עשו) the Moshiachs of the <em>Rasha’im of Esav</em>.</p>\n\n<p>And this principle, including Rashi referencing Israel and Esav is in keeping with Bereshit 25:23-24 which addresses the conception and birth of the fraternal twins, Yaacov (<em>Yisroel</em>) and Esav. Please take note of Rashi’s comments to the citation from Bereshit.</p>\n\n\n",

Avrohom Lieberman's article mentions ideas such as that the emendations go back to when the book was first written e.g. moses made the emendations in the 5 books(no doubt avrohom lieberman assumes/holds to mosaic authorship).  Ginsberg lists about 134 but that article by avrohom lieberman says that modern masoretic scholarship puts it at less than Ginsberg lists. Ginsberg's list is mentioned <a href=\"https://levendwater.org/companion/append32.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://levendwater.org/companion/append32.html</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oocities.org/hebrew_roots/html/hr-2-1-02.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.oocities.org/hebrew_roots/html/hr-2-1-02.html</a> </p>\n\n<p>The list mentioned in Avrohom Lieberman's article also doesn't detail each one, and suggests there may be some variation in the list, as he says the listing he gives is \"more of less, the classical 18 tikkunei soferim\". </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mCKxo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mCKxo.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I notice that when comparing the small list, the 18, compared with Ginsberg's list.. It's not like Ginseberg's list is all of the 18 + more. Infact it looks to me like Ginsberg's list includes none of the 18. So the lists may be different in nature. According to the two links I gave for Ginsberg's list, Ginsberg's list is for changes of the tetragrammaton to Adonai(with kamatz).<br>\nThe 18 may be changes other than that e.g. that \"times of israel\" link mentions one of the 18.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The original wording in Zechariah 2:12 has God saying that “whoever\n  touches you [Israel] touches the apple of my eye.” The metaphor of\n  someone poking a finger in God’s eye suggests that God has an eye and\n  can be harmed. It was replaced to “his eye,” implying that whoever\n  touches Israel will be punished so severely that it is as if he\n  damaged his own eye.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, that, from the 18, is not a change of Tetragrammaton to Adonai(with kamatz), and likely all the 18 are not. Whereas the Ginsberg list , according to those two links, are all changes of Tetragrammaton to Adonai(with kamatz).  </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the 18, or perhaps even generally any change <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/tikkun-soferim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/tikkun-soferim</a>  \"Not Everyone Agreed That Words Were Substituted in the Torah\" </p>\n\n<p>Hopefully somebody can post a better answer, that'd be one that lists the details of each one of the 18.</p>\n\n\n",

There is no evidence on the part of the people that have gone through any of the stages of the repentance process.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>And indeed there seems to be little forgiveness (34, 35)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Go now, lead the people where I told you.

Moshe seeing this intense and immediate regret assumes that Hashem will forgive them. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>1) According to the Ibn Ezra <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.11?lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the prayer (32, 11) of Moshe (וַיְחַ֣ל מֹשֶׁ֔ה )</a> \nwas how Moshe asked for forgiveness for the Jewish people. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזאת הפרשה היתה ראויה להכתב אחר וישב משה אל ה'. ואין מוקדם ומאוחר\n  בתורה. </p>\n  \n  <p>And this parsha should be written after “Moses went back to the LORD”\n  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.31?lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(32,\n  31)</a>\n  and there is no historical order in the Torah narrative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This prayer makes no mention of repentance and argues from the disgrace to Hashem's name (= reputation) if He would annihilate them (G-d forbid).</p>\n\n<p>2) If the verses are in chronological order, a similar argument can be made. The key aspect of Moshe's request for forgiveness of the people is  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.32?lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(32, 32)</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְעַתָּ֖ה אִם־תִּשָּׂ֣א חַטָּאתָ֑ם וְאִם־אַ֕יִן מְחֵ֣נִי נָ֔א\n  מִֽסִּפְרְךָ֖ אֲשֶׁ֥ר כָּתָֽבְתָּ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Now, if You will forgive their sin [well and good]; but if not, erase\n  me from the record which You have written!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems that the premise of the question is wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Moshe does not ask for forgiveness for the people based on their repentance. He either asks on the basis of the reduction of the Hashem's reputation or on the basis that Moshe does not want to be included in the Divine narrative if he cannot save the people.  </p>\n\n\n",

Basically, how can I learn this \"Practical Kabbalah\" as well?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The dispensation to practice Kabalah Maasis (Practical Kabbalah) via Sefer Yetzira is codified in Shulchan Aruch (YD 179, based on Sanhedrin 57b). The Shach there (:18) quotes the Levush who states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[The reason this is permitted is because] they are Holy Names, and Hashem gave them the ability to be able to perform things through the pious and prophets. One who utilizes them demonstrates the greatness and strength of Hashem. However he should make sure to delve into them in purity and holiness and for the sake of the Holiness of Hashem, or for the sake of a big mitzvah such as the honour of Shabbos, which we are not capable of doing in these generations, and even in the time of Yeshaya we find that he was punished for this. Certainly in our times it is not possible to act in purity and holiness and Hashem desires a [sincere] heart. This is the words of the Levush, and his words are correct. And similarly we find in several compilations that one should only use the Holy Names for a Holy purpose. [Like it says in Perkey Avos 1:13] דאשתמש בתגא חלף – one who exploits the crown [of Torah for his own ends] shall persish. The Rama wrote to this affect “One who exploits the crown shall perish – some say this refers to one who utilized the Holy Names”. The books of the Kabbalists also explain that it is a big sin to use His Name, therefore one who abstains will be blessed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R’ Chaim Vital writes (Sharey Kedusha Chelek 3 Shaar 6) regarding one who utilizes Kabbalah Maasis nowadays:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We have a tradition that either he or his descendants will become poor, or sick or non-religious”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, it would appear that the best solution would not to go into it at all, although there are sefarim on it.</p>\n\n\n",

In other words, the author says \"I believe by complete faith in the coming of the Messiah, and even though he tarry in waiting, in spite of that, I will still wait expectantly for him each day that he will come\" </p>\n\n<p>Compare this formulation to the other principles - he doesn't say \"Believe in G-d even if you don't see Him and have no inkling that He's there\" or \"Trust that G-d rewards the righteous and punishes the wicked even though a long time passes without justice.\" Why does Moshiach have this twist?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rambam writes in <em>Hilchos Melachim</em> (11:1):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...anyone who does not believe in (the Messiah), or one who does not\n  wait for his arrival - he is not merely denying the other prophets but\n  rather denies the Torah and Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moreover, the original source for these fundamental beliefs as described by the Rambam come from his introduction to <em>Perek Chelek</em> in a more straightforward fashion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Twelfth Fundamental Principle refers to the Messianic Era. We are\n  to believe as fact that the messiah will come and not consider him\n  late. If he delays, wait for him (Hab. 2:3); set no time limit for his\n  coming</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From these sources we see that there is a two-fold element to belief in the ultimate redemption: 1) to believe that there is an anointed Redeemer and that 2) we must actively wait for his inevitable arrival. Those two elements are distinct and must be met for one to fulfill that principle of faith. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, the formulation rendered by the anonymous author of <em>Ani Ma'amin</em> (as noted in a now deleted comment to the OP's original question [before the question was edited to reflect the fact that Rambam did <em>not</em> in fact write the piece that is printed in most <em>siddurim</em>]) is able to address these two crtierion by a) asserting the belief in an anointed messiah (<em>I believe in the arrival of the mashiach</em>) and b) asserting the belief that he can come at any day, at any time and that we must actively anticipate this arrival (<em>even though he may tarry... I await his arrival every day</em>).</p>\n\n<p>The anonymous author's poetic license seems fitting to me to cover both aspects of this fundamental of faith as it speaks both to the necessity of the latter part of the principle while accounting for the very reason why one may struggle with that aspect of the principle (i.e, the perception that there is a delay in his arrival).</p>\n\n\n",

The issue is about a drop of milk that fell on a pot of meat on the fire.</p>\n\n<p>First version:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טיפת חלב שנפלה על החתיכה, אם יש בה בנותן טעם באותה חתיכה, אסור.\n  ניער את הקדרה, אם יש בה בנותן טעם באותה קדרה, אסור.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam's version :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טיפת חלב שנפלה על חתיכה אם יש בה בנותן טעם באותה חתיכה נוער את הקדירה אם יש בה בנותן טעם באותה הקדירה אסור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Rambam's version, the Mishna says that one needs to shake the pot (נוער את הקדירה). In other rishonim's version, it doesn't address this rule. Mishna only speaks about the case they already did shake (the version is ניער את הקדרה). Is it a machloket in Halacha?  <strong>Is it universally accepted that one can shake milk that fell on one of the pieces of meat?</strong> It seems that the Rambam's version allows to augment the amount of meat in contact with the milk drops, to lead to annulation of the milk after its already present. In Isur deorayta, all poskim in YD seems to prohibit this. </p>\n\n<p>I noticed this Rambam version of Mishna recently. I am familiar with the other version, it's the version in standard Gemara, in Rashi and Tosfot. Reading the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/99558/9215\">post of @mbloch</a> I sudenly realized that the Shulchan Aruch rules the Halacha following the Girsa of Rambam on Mishnayot. Poskim, Taz, Shach explain the Rambam source is a Mishna in Teruma (5.12) saying that isur that fell in one of two containers, and no one of them can annul it alone. Because we don't know in which it fell, the two together annul the Isur. Peri Megadim has a great pilpul in siman 92 and 111. <strong>Poskim don't speak about the different versions of the Mishna. Perhaps they did'nt know the version of Rambam?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here is the version of other rishonim in English (Sefaria).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A drop of milk which fell on a piece [of meat], if there is enough of it to give flavor into that piece, it is forbidden. [If] one stirred the pot, if there is enough of it to give flavor to the [contents] of that pot, it is forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<h3>Yes the different versions show lechaora a machloket regarding the definition of Bitul Isur Lechatechilla.</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>טיפת חלב שנפלה על החתיכה, אם יש בה בנותן טעם באותה חתיכה, אסור.\nניער את הקדרה, אם יש בה בנותן טעם באותה קדרה, אסור.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A drop of milk, that fell on a piece of meat, if its able to give taste in this piece, it's prohibited. If he shook the pot, if it's able to give taste in the pot, it's prohibited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The version of the Mishna following the Rambam is different.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ח,ג  טיפת חלב שנפלה על חתיכה--אם יש בה בנותן טעם באותה< חתיכה, נוער את הקדירה; אם יש בה בנותן טעם באותה הקדירה, אסור.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A drop of milk, that fell on a piece of meat, if its able to give taste in this piece,  one needs to shake the pot, if it's able to give taste in the pot, it's prohibited.</p>\n<p>Two differences:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first statement, ruling that if the milk drop is able to give taste in the meat piece, it prohibits (or the piece only, or the whole pot's content),</li>\n<li>One is allowed to shake the pot, even if one knows that this action lead to the annulment of an isur which is now happening.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can assume that what is recommended in the second version isn't following the supporters of the first version.</p>\n<p>The Bartenura, following Rashi,  comments on the second statement of the Mishna according to the first version.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ניער את הקדירה - שהגיס בה מיד קודם שקבלה החתיכה טעם מן הטפה, דהשתא נתערבה הטיפה בכולן:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shaking the pot is useful when one shake immediately, before the drop impregnated the meat piece.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם יש בנותן טעם באותה קדירה - כלומר אין כח בטפה לאסור כולן אא\"כ יש בה טעם ליתן בכל הקדירה: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In consequence,it is consistent that  Mishna says that the result of shaking depends if the whole pot is great enough to annul the milk drop. All is allowed or all is prohibited.</p>\n<p>The first statement of the Mishna describes what is the rule when one has not been fast enough to shake the pot immediately. Bartenura says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כלומר אם אין באותה חתיכה לבדה ששים לבטל הטפה, מיד נאסרת החתיכה, ואוסרת חברותיה וצריך ששים כנגד כל החתיכה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the meat piece on which fell the milk drop is not (volumetrically) sixty time bigger than the milk drop, the piece is immediately prohibited. In consequence, if the rest of the content of the  pot is not sixty time bigger than this piece, the whole pot is prohibited. The meat piece prohibits the entire pot because one shaked the pot after it absorbed the milk (Tosfot Yom Tov explains this from the Gemara) .</p>\n<p>In summary, the Mishna enumerates two laws depending on whether the shaking was before or after the time needed for the drop to give taste in the meat piece.</p>\n<p>But the Mishna according to the Rambam gives advice what to do to avoid to make tref the pot (Dikduke sofrim).</p>\n<p>I am pretty sure that the version of the Rambam vehicles a \"novelty\" not universally accepted, regarding the topic \"one does not annulate an isur Lechatechilla\".</p>\n<p>The same statement of Rambam is in Mishne Tora (Maachalot Asurot 9.10), and is quoted in Shulchan Aruch (YD 92.2).</p>\n<p>I found the Machloket (that I presented as Machloket Girsaot) it in the Sifte Cohen sk 8. We see that poskim searched the source of the chiddush of Rambam, and didn't know his Girsa.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואין להקשות היאך ינער הקדרה שיתערב הכל דלמא יש טעם בחתיכה אחת ואיך יבטל איסור לכתחלה וא\"כ הוי ליה למימר שיטעום העובד כוכבים כל חתיכה וחתיכה בפני עצמו יש לומר דכיון דלא נודע לאיזה נפל הרי נכנס כל הקדרה בספק ואין כאן משום מבטל איסור וגם דמי למה שכתב מהרא\"י בת\"ה סימן קע\"א ואין זה מבטל איסור לכתחלה כיון שספק הוא אם יתערב שום איסור כלל עכ\"ל והבאתיו בסי' פ\"ד ס\"ק ל\"ח וכן לקמן סימן קט\"ז ס\"ק כ\"ח וה\"נ ספק הוא אם יש טעם בחתיכה זו ונראה דגם הטור הבין דעת הרמב\"ם כן אלא ס\"ל כיון דאפשר למיקם עלה דמילתא א\"כ לא נכנס הכל בספק שהרי יודע הדבר על ידי שיטעום העובד כוכבים כל חתיכה וחתיכה בפני עצמה והלכך כיון שחתיכה א' היתה מתבררת בודאי שהיא אסורה א\"כ מאי מועיל ניעור אח\"כ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shach objects (Tur and Rema hold this objection) against this practice (to shake lechatechilla) that it may be a problem of annulling isur Lechatechilla (1). And answers that the whole set of pieces it in safek isur situation, perhaps the drop of milk is already annulled in the first meat piece. So this is annulment of a safek isur. And with safek isur there is no bitul isur Lechatechilla. But for the Tur and Rema, the objection is due to the possibility to verify each of the meat pieces (there are upper the water's level) if one piece have milk taste it's \"nevela\". When one can check the situation, the din is not safek. So shaking is mevatel isur Lechatechilla.</p>\n<p>See in Peri Megadim who addresses the issue of bitul isur Lechatechilla on his comment on the Shach called Sifte Daat. There are a lot of details in the Sugia, e.g. the different steps of the shaking.</p>\n<p><strong>I just wanted to point that the version of the Mishna of the Rambam is not mentioned in poskim as a source, but seems to source be the for the Din of Rambam, despite that Poskim didn't address it. Perhaps they wasn't aware of this version</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1): To be more precise. If the drop of milk fell on a small piece of meat, there are two possibilities of problems. 1) If it didn't still be absorbed, when one shake it, we add meat to annul it. 2) If it's still absorbed, we have a prohibited piece of meat that \"became nevela\" as says the Gemara, and we annul it with the others pieces.</p>\n<p>But we don't know what happened. The first problem is treated as obvious by the Mahari Ben Chaviv, may be,  no problem because there is no isur at all at this stage. The second is discussed. I will expose two terutsim. The teruts of the Magid Mishne is that when we cannot identify the piece, there is no din \"piece became nevela\". The teruts of Mahari Ben Chaviv is that because he cannot identify the piece, the pieces are seen as mixed and one can shake them.</p>\n\n\n",

I have bolded the specific issues identified by these <em>poskim</em>. Nearly all these issues apply to your second question as well.</p>\n\n<p>R Shlomo Dichovsky (“Ha’azanat Seter” in Torah Shebe’al Peh 35, p. 57) is quoted <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2011/03/04/recording-phone-call-phone-tapping/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> as writing</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although it would <strong>not be permitted</strong> to tap phones in general, and to\n  listen or publicize others’ conversations (<strong>because of</strong> prohibitions\n  such as <strong>publicizing others’ secrets, the cherem of R. Gershon, heizek\n  re’iah</strong>, and others, which are discussed by poskim), it would be\n  <strong>permitted for the sake of saving oneself from damage</strong>, based on the\n  principle of <em>avid inish dina lenafsheh</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.businesshalacha.com/en/newsletter/recording-conversation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">businesshalacha.com</a> writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In halachic literature (C.M. 228) [geneivas daas] is classically\n  described as the act of misleading and deceiving someone in a manner\n  that will cause this person to mistakenly feel morally indebted, even\n  though he is not actually indebted. Thus secretly recording someone\n  does not violate the prohibition of geneivas daas. Nevertheless <strong>we do\n  find authorities who would consider such an act geneivas daas</strong> (see\n  Chikekei Lev 1, Y.D. 49 and Pele Yo’etz, Geneivah).</p>\n  \n  <p>But there are additional issues to consider. This act may <strong>possibly\n  violate the Cherem D’Rabbeinu Gershom</strong> (Be’er Hagolah, Y.D. 334), who\n  prohibits reading other people’s correspondence. It is debatable\n  whether this ban extends to all manner of communication or whether it\n  is limited to written correspondence. It is obvious that, at the very\n  least, it constitutes a violation of <strong>v’ahavta l’rei’acha kamocha</strong> (see\n  Chikekei Lev ibid., which suggests this as the underlying rationale\n  behind Rabbeinu Gershom’s cherem). </p>\n  \n  <p>Additionally, some write that it is prohibited to <strong>reveal a friend’s\n  private concerns, which is an extension of the prohibition of\n  tale-bearing (rechilus)</strong>. If one may not tell tales to others, one may\n  certainly not seek tales for himself (Halachos Ketanos 1:6).</p>\n  \n  <p>Some contend that secretly recording conversations is a form of <strong>hezek\n  re’iyah</strong> — the prohibition against causing damage by gazing at another.\n  It is broadly defined as the prohibition against violating another\n  person’s privacy, even if he is aware of it, as he might be too\n  embarrassed to protest.</p>\n  \n  <p>Chazal relate that when Bilam observed that placement of the tents of\n  the Jews was done in a way that assured each one’s privacy, he\n  commented that that made them worthy to receive the Divine presence\n  (see Shulchan Aruch Harav, Nizkei Mammon 11:13). The obvious extension\n  of this principle is that secretly recording a conversation is a\n  <strong>violation of privacy and represents a lack of tznius</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, <strong>for purposes of chinuch it may be permitted to secretly\n  record a conversation when necessary</strong> (see Rashba 1:557), for example,\n  to afford one the opportunity to prevent someone from sinning or to be\n  able to recover money that is owed to him (Pele Yo’etz).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Possibly, they used the expression העלוך \"they brought you up,\" to hint that there was a Power on earth which equals the Power in the Heavens, G'd forbid;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whereas the Rabbeinu Bahya writes that this was about adding something to a pantheon of figures,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You have to realise that when the Israelites said: “these are your gods O Israel, who brought you out of Egypt,” there would have been nothing wrong with this if what they had in mind had been the same as what Aaron had in mind when making the calf. After all, we have already explained that Exodus 14,19 accorded the title “elohim” to a column of cloud and a column of fire; there was therefore nothing inherently wrong in the use of the word אלוהים or אלוהיך. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>…</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our sages in Sanhedrin 63 derive from this that these Israelites strove to have many deities. They derive this from the word אלה “these,” instead of זה, “this,” if they had referred only to the golden calf. We do indeed find the latter expression in Nechemyah 9,18: זה אלוהיך אשר העלוך ממצרים, “this is your god who took you out of Egypt.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Torah Temima cites an opinion that there were multiple calves made, one for each tribe, though they all looked alike</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלה אלהיך וגו׳. תניא, ר׳ שמעון בן יוחאי אומר, י\"ג עגלים עשו ישראל ואחד דמוסיא לכולן זכלומר י\"ב עגלים עגל לכל שבט ושבט ואחד היה משותף לכל השבטים ביחד, ודמוסיא הוא הנהגה כללית בלשון רומי. דכתיב אלה אלהיך ישראל אשר העלוך הרי י\"ב שבטים, וכתיב (נחמיה ט׳:י״ח) זה אלהיך אשר העלך, הרי דמוסיא אחד לכולן חכונת הדרשה ליישב סתירת הלשונות דכאן כתיב אלה אלהיך אשר העלוך, בלשון רבים, ובנחמיה כתיב זה אלהיך אשר העלך בלשון יחיד, ודרשו שזה שנאמר בלשון רבים מוסב על מאמר כל שבט לעגל שלו, ומה שנאמר בלשון יחיד מוסב על מאמר כל העם להעגל המשותף, ועיין בויק\"ר פ' ה' ובדרשה הבאה. .\n  (ירושלמי סנהדרין פ\"י ה\"ב)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Another interesting discrepancy -- Exodus says <em>these are your gods, <strong>Israel</strong>, who took you out...</em>; Nehemiah reads <em>this is your god who took you out.</em></p>\n\n<p>The simplest suggestion would be that \"god\" is acceptable in Hebrew in both singular and plural; or perhaps it was more commonly plural in earlier Hebrew and changed in later Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively: the narrative in Exodus is hinting at all kinds of complexities that actually went into the golden calf, such as multiple calves for multiple tribes; and the involvement of the <em>erev rav</em> (as the Kli Yakar points out -- if the audience is addressed as \"Israel\", that would imply the speakers are not Israel).</p>\n\n<p>When Nehemiah is recapping Jewish history to get the Second Temple going, he needs to drive home a few points. At this moment in history, there is just one Jewish people; he can't afford blaming the quasi-Jews (especially not when the \"bluebloods\" stayed behind in Babylon; a whole mishmash of pedigrees returned to Israel), and he certainly can't afford any nods to divisions between the tribes -- that had turned out disastrously during the First Temple period -- you'll notice the North/South split is completely glossed over in Nehemiah Chapter 9. So for the sake of what the Jews need to know for their new existence in Israel, the focus is simplified -- one golden calf that the Jews made.</p>\n\n\n",

While <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.72b.5?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 72a</a> discusses a handbreadth thick for the pure gold plating, the alternative given in the gemara itself is a mashehu / \"negligible amount\".</p>\n<p>Must the \"mashehu\" be a fingerbreadth, and if so, literally so?

That would adjust all of your calculations downward.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Israelites just left Egypt, and the ancient Egyptians quite possibly had a form of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1932/11/12/archives/egypt-knew-secret-of-electroplating-columbia-chemists-bring-fact-to.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">electroplating</a> (link goes to New York Times article).

I am not exactly sure how much a talent weighed at that time. It is estimated at between 75 and 100 pounds. Let's say it was 100 pounds. That means that 29 talents weighed about 2900 pounds. I think it is reasonable to figure that 20 talents were used to make the Ark. That's 2000 pounds of gold. The wood might have weighed another 200 pounds. Let's say that the luchot (tablets) weighed 300 pounds each. That's another 600 pounds for a total of 2800 pounds. Even that amount would mean that each of the four Kohanim would have to lift and carry 700 pounds. That is not realistic. Even if they could lift and carry it, I doubt that they could go very far. The Torah says that they could carry it for at least one day and one night, sometimes for much longer. The point is that clearly the Ark carried them.</p>\n\n\n",

As the Jewish Calender is based on the moon. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<p><strong>Some background - why your question cannot be answered \"truly\" Halachicly</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of Halacha - derived from other sources and made-up from nowhere. Yes, many Halochos have no existing sources whatsoever, but because something has to be Halachic they are made-up. The probably best example is the use of electricity on Shabbos - we had no precedent or even true understanding of electricity when the Rabbis were \"forced\" to rule it out.</p>\n\n<p>Why go so far to other planets - What about the time at the poles? How do you keep time at the poles that have no hours? As this Halacha cannot be derived from existing sources that were not aware of the existence of the poles, you just make it up, for example, you align with Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<p>How about going to the orbit and having 6 sunrises in 24 hours? Same here, you make the Halachah up. </p>\n\n<p>So your question is from the same area - it can not be derived from the existing sources - once it will be relevant, the Rabbis will make something up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To your question</strong> - no, we only have one specific Moon, not just any moon that orbits the planet you're currently on. Our Moon is one that orbits the Earth and has the same relative size as the Sun and metaphorically represents the Jewish people as we say in Birkas Levonah. Outside the Earth, it makes no sense.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the time as we know it in Judaism has no sense outside the Earth, because the only way of telling time in Judaism is by knowing the relative position of the Sun (hours) or the Moon (days). There's no idea of a minute or a second or fixed hour or else. THerefore once you're up in the skies you're on your own - the Halacha does not cover it. Come back soon!</p>\n\n\n",

Why is this daily miracle not even mentioned during the celebration of Sukkos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Sukkos is directly tied to the Exodus itself, just like matzah (Vayikra 23:42-43). After leaving Ramses, the Israelites immediately traveled to a place called Sukkos (Shemos 12:37). This first stop represents a key moment in the Exodus journey, the first land upon which they tasted freedom, much like the eating of matzah, which commemorates the haste in leaving Egypt.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the manna started a month later (Shemos 16), after the Exodus had already occurred. Since Sukkos marks a significant point in the actual departure from Egypt, it is celebrated as part of the Exodus, while the manna, which came later, is not directly tied to that event.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://musingsonthetorah.blogspot.com/2023/10/sukkos-pesach-20.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://musingsonthetorah.blogspot.com/2023/10/sukkos-pesach-20.html</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to the theory suggested by Rabbi Laufer in the book \"<a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/rendezvous-with-godhardcoverstandard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rendzevous with G-d</a>\" the sources for 7 of the Jewish holidays, mentioned in the Torah, originate with 7 national revelations that Jewish people had beginning with <em>leil shimurim</em>, the Pesach Mitzraim night, and ending with Hashem's fire consuming the sacrifices in the Mishkan.</p>\n<p>G-d's raining down the manna was the revelation number 3, perek <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.16?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 16</a>, and according to R.

    "content": "# Should we interpret the Torah literally or allegorically?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I had a question regarding how we should interpret the Torah. Should we interpret it literally, or if not how far can we abstract its teachings, or should we favour a mix of both approaches?</p>\n\n<p>I have heard that one of the objectives of the Torah (according to the Rambam) is to combat avodah zerah and in order to achieve this the Torah was given to Moses by HaShem in a way that would be intelligible to the Israelites. I have seen <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/97327/on-the-interpretation-of-genesis-1-1\">other threads</a> on this board which refer to the Rambam's statement that Genesis is allegorical. Is this true of the entire Torah, or is this a reference to the many layers that can only be learned with time and experience?</p>\n\n<p>I hope that I have formulated a question in such a way as to imply my lack of certainty and knowledge pertaining to my postulations and I am grateful for any and all assistance/critique.</p>\n\n<p>Have a nice day,</p>\n\n<p>Shalom!  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Almost everyone will agree that neither extreme is correct. That is to say, that almost no one will interpret every word of the Torah literally, and almost no one will interpret every word of the Torah allegorically. The real question is what the balance is. How do we determine which parts of the Torah should be interpreted literally, and which parts should be interpreted allegorically? And, of course, this is subject to much debate.</p>\n<p>The first systematic methodology was given by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Sa'adia Gaon</a>. In Emunot V'Deiot 7:2 he lists four criteria for deviating from the literal meaning of Scripture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When Scripture contradicts the senses.</li>\n<li>When Scripture contradicts reason.</li>\n<li>When Scripture contradicts Scripture.</li>\n<li>When there is a rabbinic tradition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He very clearly states that <strong>these and only these</strong> are valid reasons for deviating from the literal meaning.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And so I declare, first of all, that it is a well-known fact that every statement found in the Bible is to be understood in its literal sense except for those that cannot be so construed for one of the following four reasons. It may, for example, either be rejected by the observation of the senses, such as the statement: <em>And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living</em> (Gen. 3:20), whereas we see that the ox and the lion are not the offspring of womankind. Hence we must needs conclude that the implication of the statement embraces human descendants only.</p>\n<p>Or else the literal sense may be negated by reason, such as that of the statement: <em>For the Lord thy God is a devouring fire, a jealous God</em> (Deut. 4:24). Now fire is something created and defective, for it is subject to extinction. Hence it is logically inadmissible that God resemble it. We must, therefore, impute to this statement the meaning that God's punishment is like a consuming fire, in accordance with the remark made elsewhere in scripture: <em>For all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of My jealousy</em> (Zeph. 3:8).</p>\n<p>Again, [the literal meaning of a Biblical statement may be rendered impossible] by an explicit text of a contradictory nature, in which case it would become necessary to interpret the first statement in a non-literal sense. Thus, for example, it is said in Scripture: <em>Ye shall not try the Lord your God, as ye tried Him in Massah</em> (Deut/ 6:16). And it is also said, on the other hand: <em>And try Me now herewith... if I will not open you the windows of heaven</em> (Mal. 3:10). Now the point wherein these two statements agree is that we must not test our Lord as to whether He is able to do a certain thing, as they did of whom it is reported: <em>And they tried God in their heart by asking food for their craving. Yea, they spoke against God; they said: \"Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?\"</em> (Ps. 78:18, 19.) It is to these that the remark <em>as ye tried Him in Massah</em> refers. It is, however, permissible for a servant of God to test his Master by asking whether it be possible for Him to create a miracle in his behalf. Such a request was indeed made by Gideon, who said: <em>Let me make trial, I pray Thee, but this once with the fleece</em> (Judg. 6:39). It was also done by Hezekiah (II Kings 20:8) and others.</p>\n<p>Finally any Biblical statement to the meaning of which rabbinic tradition has attached a certain reservation is to be interpreted by us in keeping with this authentic tradition. Thus it has been transmitted to us that the punishment of stripes consists of thirty-nine blows, although Scripture states: <em>Forty stripes he may give him</em> (Deut. 25:3). We therefore adopt the view that this is just a rough way of saying that there be thirty-nine stripes. The text of Scripture has merely expressed this thought in round numbers, as it has done in the statement: <em>After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years</em> (Num. 14:34). For in reality there were only thirty-nine years, since the first year of Israel's sojourn in the wilderness did not enter into this punishment.</p>\n<p>There exist, then, only these four possible reasons for a non-literal interpretation of the verses of Sacred Writ, there being no fifth.   (Rosenblatt translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ibn_Ezra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Abraham Ibn Ezra</a> in his commentary to Exodus 20:1 discusses commandments that appear to contradict sense:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וחלילה חלילה שתהיה מצוה אחת מהן מכחשת שקול הדעת רק אנחנו חייבים לשמור כל אשר צונו השם בין שנגלה לנו הסוד בין שלא נגלה ואם מצאנו אחת מהן מכחשת שקול הדעת אינו נכון שנאמין בו כי הוא כמשמעו רק בספרי חכמינו ז\"ל נבקש מה טעמו אם היא על דרך משל ואם לא מצאנו זה כתוב נבקש אנחנו ונחפש בכל יכלתנו אולי נוכל לתקן אותה ואם לא יכלנו נניחה כאשר היא ונודה שלא ידענו מה היה כמו ומלתם את ערלת לבבכם וכי הוא צונו שנרצחנו כאכזרי</p>\n<p>And heaven forfend that there should be a commandment, one of them, that contradicts the assessment of intelligence; we just are obligated to keep all that God commanded us, whether the secret has been revealed to us or whether it has not been revealed. And if we find one of them contradicting the assessment of intelligence it is not proper that we believe about it that it is as it sounds. Instead we should search its reason in the books of our Sages of blessed memory, [to see] if it is by way of parable. And if we do not find this written, we [ourselves] should search and seek with all our ability that we may perhaps be able to fix it. And if we are unable, we should leave it as it is and acknowledge that we don't know what it is, like [the commandment of] <em>and you shall circumcise the foreskin of your heart</em> — did [God] command us that we should kill ourselves like a cruel [person]?!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He seems to be of the opinion that anything which contradicts sense must be reinterpreted, and if we can't find a way to reinterpret it we should put it aside. Notably, this is specifically not limited to narrative portions of the Torah.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> may be the one most famously held as the champion of non-literal interpretation. Much of his writings are dedicated to eradicating the literal interpretations of verses which corporify God. As I mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/97334/13438\">this answer</a>, Rambam wrote that he could easily interpret the account of creation against the literal meaning of a created universe, if not for the fact that an eternal universe would undermine the religion. Indeed, as I mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/92973/13438\">this answer</a>, he states in <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp116.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 2:29</a> that the account of creation is not to be taken entirely literally. Similarly, as I mentioned in the same answer, he interpreted many Scriptural narratives as occurring in dreams/visions, even though the literal reading of the text implies that they happened in real life, as he explains in <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp128.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Guide for the Perplexed 2:41</a>-<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp129.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">42</a>.</p>\n<p>He did assert that certain things had to be literal, though. As I mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/96330/13438\">this answer</a> in <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp186.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 3:50</a> he insisted that there was a literal person Adam created.</p>\n<p>Like Rambam, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> interpreted many passages non-literally. However, as I explained in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/97146/13438\">this answer</a>, he strongly cautioned against abusing the policy of allegorization, even criticizing Rambam for invoking it unnecessarily, noting that excessive alllegorization can destroy the entire Torah.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Caspi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Joseph Ibn Kaspi</a> also followed Rambam in interpreting some passages non-literally, but also criticized Rambam for excessive allegorization. As I mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/97146/13438\">this answer</a>, he argued that by following Rambam's lead it would be possible to allegorize everything, and we would be left with no Torah.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> also strongly criticized Rambam's interpretations. In his commentary to Genesis 18:1 he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the book Moreh Nebuchim it is said that this portion of Scripture consists of a genearal statement followed by a detailed description. Thus Scripture first says that the Eternal appeared to Abraham in the form of prophetic visions, and then explains in what manner this vision took place, namely, that he [Abraham] lifted up his eyes in the vision, <em>and lo, three men stood by him, and he said, if now I have found favor in thy eyes</em>. This is the account of what he said in the prophetic vision to one of them, namely, the chief.</p>\n<p>Now if in the vision there appeared to Abraham only men partaking of food, how then does Scripture say, <em>And the Eternal appeared to him,</em> as G-d did not appear to him in vision or in thought? Such is not found with respect to all the prophecies. And according to his words, Sarah did not knead cakes, nor did Abraham prepare a bullock, and also, Sarah did not laugh. It was all a vision! If so, this dream came <em>through a multitude of business,</em> like dreams of falsehood, for what is the purpose of showing him all this! Similarly did the author of Moreh Nebuchim say in the case of the verse, <em>And a man wrestled with him,</em> that it was all a prophetic vision. But if this be the case, I do not know why Jacob limped on his thigh when he awoke! And why did Jacob say, <em>For I have seen an angel face to face, and my life is preserved</em>? The prophets did not fear that they might die on account of having experienced prophetic visions. Jacob, moreover, had already seen a greater and more distinguished vision than this many times, in prophetic visions, he had also seen the Revered Divinity. Now according to this author's opinion, he will find it necessary for the sake of consistency to say similarly in the affair of Lot that the angels did not come to his house, nor did he bake for them <em>unleavened bread and they did eat</em>. Rather, it was all a vision! But if Lot could ascend to the height of a prophetic vision, how did the wicked and sinful people of Sodom become prophets? Who told them that men had come into Lot's house? And if all these [i.e., the actins of the inhabitants of Sodom], were part of prophetic visions, then it follows that the account related in the verses, <em>And the angels hastened Lot, saying: Arise thake thy wife. ...And he said, Escape for thy life... See, I have accepted thee</em>, as well as the entire chapter is but a vision, and if so, Lot could have remained in Sodom! But the author of the Moreh Nebuchim thinks that the events took place of themselves, but the conversations relating to all matters were in a vision! But such words contradict Scripture. It is forbidden to listen to them, all the more to believe in them! (Chavel translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How could there be so little gold in the Mishkan, when it’s clear there’s much more?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Shemos 38:24, we’re told that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּל־הַזָּהָ֗ב הֶֽעָשׂוּי֙ לַמְּלָאכָ֔ה בְּכֹ֖ל מְלֶ֣אכֶת הַקֹּ֑דֶשׁ וַיְהִ֣י ׀ זְהַ֣ב הַתְּנוּפָ֗ה תֵּ֤שַׁע וְעֶשְׂרִים֙ כִּכָּ֔ר וּשְׁבַ֨ע מֵא֧וֹת וּשְׁלֹשִׁ֛ים שֶׁ֖קֶל בְּשֶׁ֥קֶל הַקֹּֽדֶשׁ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>All the gold that was used for the work [in the Mishkan], in all the work of the sanctuary—the elevation offering of gold—came to 29 talents and 730 shekels by the sanctuary weight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi defines a “talent”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ככר. שִׁשִּׁים מָנֶה, וּמָנֶה שֶׁל קֹדֶשׁ כָּפוּל הָיָה, הֲרֵי הַכִּכָּר ק\"כ מָנֶה, וְהַמָּנֶה כ\"ה סְלָעִים, הֲרֵי כִּכָּר שֶׁל קֹדֶשׁ שְׁלֹשֶׁת אֲלָפִים שְׁקָלִים</p>\n  \n  <p>”A talent” - 60 [common] Maneh. The Maneh of the Sanctuary was doubled; thus a talent is 120 [common] Maneh. A Maneh is 25 Sela [the Talmudic equivalent to a Biblical Shekel], thus a Sanctuary talent was 3000 Shekalim. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kiddushin 12a states that there are 1536 Perutos in two Sela, or 768 Perutos in one Sela. A Perutah is 0.025g according to the Shulchan Aruch (CM 88:1), or 0.018g according to Rashi (Bechoros 49b), leading to a Sela being 19.2g according to the Shulchan Aruch or 13.824g according to Rashi. </p>\n\n<p>The total gold in the Mishkan, then, was either 1,684.416kg according to the Shulchan Aruch or 1,212.77952kg according to Rashi.</p>\n\n<p>Now, my <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/99739/9682\">ballpark estimate</a> of <em>just the gold in the Aron</em> yields at <em>minimum</em> 3,565.97kg, over double the Shulchan Aruch’s number for the <em>total gold</em> in the Mishkan, and close to triple Rashi’s number!</p>\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/88099/9682\">see</a> that this issue was raised by the Ralbag.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone reconcile these numbers?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>By way of prefatory remarks I will include this Ibn Ezra on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.38.24?lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the verse mentioned</a> as a precursor to any information below, and by doing so we can then remain level-headed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומי יוכל לשער כמה זהב צפוי כל כלי המשכן</p>\n  \n  <p>We cannot really properly assess the gold in the Mishkan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, in the Ralbag cited, he proceeds those statements <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42541&st=&pgnum=197\" rel=\"noreferrer\">by saying</a> that we do not know the golden ark thicknesses [at all].</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועובי ארונות הזהב לא נודע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br>\nThe Living Torah (<a href=\"https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=38#C1939\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ch. 38</a>) breaks down the gold distributions in the Mishkan:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since a talent is 3000 shekels, this was a total of 87,730 shekels,\n  1/7 shekel for each person counted. It was a total of 4386 1/2 pounds\n  of gold. According to Saadia Gaon (quoted in Ibn Ezra, Perush\n  HaKitzur):</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>1/2 talent was used to plate each of the 48 beams of the Tabernacle, accounting for 24 talents. </li>\n  <li>Another 2 talents was used for the four pillars holding the cloth partition.</li>\n  <li>1 talent for the menorah. </li>\n  <li>1 talent for the ark and its cover. </li>\n  <li>1 talent for the table and golden altar. </li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>This accounts for the 29 talents. The additional 730 shekels (36.5\n  pounds) were used for such items as the fasteners and clothing.</p>\n  \n  <p>[Since 1/2 talent was used for each pillar, which was 10 cubits high,\n  and 1 1/2 cubits wide, it can easily be calculated that the thickness\n  of the gold on the pillars was approximately 1/100 inch. If it is\n  assumed that the same thickness was used all around the incense altar,\n  it can be calculated that the top of the altar had a gold layer around\n  1/4 inch thick.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Earlier, too, he presented (25:17) similar contradictory information you find yourself with regarding the ark cover:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3' 9' x 2' 3', like the dimensions of the ark (Exodus 25:10). The\n  Talmud states that the ark cover was one handbreadth (3 inches) thick\n  (Sukkah 5a). It can easily be calculated that if it were solid gold,\n  it would weigh (without the cherubs), some 2500 pounds, or 17 talents\n  (see note on Exodus 25:39). Some sources thus state that the ark cover\n  was considerably thinner (Tur), since we find that the ark had to be\n  light enough to be carried easily (Baaley Tosafoth on Exodus 25:11).\n  One source states that the ark-cover weighed one talent (150 pounds),\n  just like the menorah (Exodus 25:39; Saadia Gaon, quoted in Ibn Ezra\n  on Exodus 38:24). The ark cover would therefore have been around 3/16\n  inch thick, or, if the cherubs are taken into account, more likely\n  around 1/8 inch thick. It may have been made like an inverted open\n  box, so that its sides were one handbreadth thick on the outside.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The most lenient opinion cited would still be too large to fall under the 1 talent prescribed for both the ark and ark cover.</p>\n\n<p>An answer can be found with the Ibn Ezra cited, expounded and explained by 'Mishenh Lezra'. An additional problem he cites is regarding the leftover 730 shekels - how can that small amount of gold, a little more than 1/5 talent, provide for all rest of the odds and ends in the Mishkan (from clothe items to structural items, see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34553&st=&pgnum=387\" rel=\"noreferrer\">link</a> for full list)?</p>\n\n<p>He answers that in counting the total amounts of gold and silver, the Torah did not go into specifics regarding what the gold was used for because the gold was donated. As apposed to the silver which was mandatory. The numbers of the gold were not as relevant, especially compared to the silver which doubled as a census device.</p>\n\n<p>It thus comes out that we cannot necessarily know what the measurements of the gold were, and, if desired the Ibn Ezra presents an opinion the fits the ark into one talent, which removes the question at hand who places it at many talents.</p>\n\n<p>[It is also probably likely that more attempted calulations of other gold parts of the Mishkan may lead to a number exceeding 29 talents, as well.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Warning: this is a chiddush.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to suggest that the amount of gold in Pekudei did <em>not</em> count towards the gold in Pekudei.  The pesukim don't say what the gold mentioned there was used for, so there's no explicit contradiction.  There's also a precedent for this: the kiyor isn't mentioned in the copper section, and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Exodus.38.8.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> says the copper mirrors used to make it don't count towards that number.</p>\n\n<p>I have two pieces of evidence that this may be the case.  The first is the Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Chosen_Temple.1.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beis Habechira 1:6</a>, who lists the seven vessels that we are supposed to make for the Beis Hamikdash: copper mizbeach, its ramp, kiyor, its base, gold mizbeach, menorah, and shulchan.  The aron is missing.  In the next few perakim he gives the halachos for constructing these vessels, and again, he doesn't give any details of the aron.  The closest he comes is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Chosen_Temple.4.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4:1</a>, where he describes the <em>history</em> of how the aron was lost, but doesn't say how it's supposed to be made.</p>\n\n<p>The Frankel Rambam gives a long list of acharonim who discuss whether the aron is part of the mitzvah of ועשו לי מקדש according to the Rambam.  I have not yet had a chance to pursue this further yet.  However, if it's a separate, one-shot mitzvah (analagous to the miluim and to Har Gerizim and Har Eival), that's a good reason for its gold to be counted separately.</p>\n\n<p>My other evidence is from the mishnah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shekalim.6.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shekalim 6:5</a>, which describes the 13 donation boxes in  the Beis Hamikdash.  One of them is called זהב לכפורת.  There's a machlokes what this actually meansץ  Rashi, Bartenura, and others relate it to a pasuk in Ezra and say that it means for general klei shareis.  The Rambam says it's for the kapores and kodesh hakodashim.  (R' Kapach says in the footnotes of the Mosad Harav Kook edition that what he actually means is בית הכפורת, i.e. the kodesh hakodashim.  We know that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shekalim.4.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gold plating was added to the walls and floor on a fairly regular basis</a>.  Based on the translations I have the Rambam's language seems redundant according to this explanation, but I don't speak Arabic so I can't really comment.)</p>\n\n<p>It's possible that the phrasing of זהב לכפורת was originally used for the actual donation of gold to construct the aron, and then when that wasn't needed anymore they kept the category but switched the purpose to something closely related.  This works best according to the Rambam's explanation, but is also possible according to Rashi.  In either case, it explains why the language of כפורת is used to label the box rather than a word that more directly describes what the money was used for.</p>\n\n\n",

One example is the <a href=\"https://www.azm.org/educational-programs/holiday-ideas/purim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">American Zionist Movement</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This year, for the 2018 Purim Connection, the American Zionist Movement collaborated with its member organizations, networks and volunteers in Israel on two exciting projects in celebration of Purim. This includes partnerships with our Purim Connection coordinating partner, the Israel Forever Foundation, along with  Yad Ezra V’Shulamit, Yashar L’Chayal, AMIT Children and Bnei Akiva.</p>\n<p>Mishloach Manot – baskets of treats – were distributed to impoverished\nIsraeli children and to Israel’s Border Police “Magav” (מִשְׁמַר\nהַגְּבוּל) to bring Purim joy to the guardians and citizens of Israel.\nThe brave men and women of the Border Police guard and protect the\nState of Israel and are often the first line of defense against urban\nand cross-border terrorism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that while poor children can be considered the recipients of <em>matanos la'aniyim</em>, the border police and those organizations that send to Tzahal would be sending <em>Mishloach Manot</em>. In this case, since you are sending money to the organization, which then buys food for the recipient, it is as if you sent the food via the shaliach.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/tzarich-iyun/mishloach-manot/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishloach Manot -OU Torah</a> cites:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The posekim of the last several hundred years discuss many differences\nin the performance of the mitzvah, depending on the reasoning behind\nit. For example, according to Rav Alkabetz, sending non-food items is\nacceptable<sup>3</sup> because such a package also engenders friendship</p>\n<p><sup>3.</sup> Some reject non-food ideas for technical reasons. For\nexample, the Gra (695 on seif 4) learns from Beitzah 14b that “manot”\nmeans specifically food. Some suggest that one can send money because\nit can then be used to purchase food. The Be’er Heiteiv (695:6) rules\nthat non-food items are acceptable as long as there is still time on\nPurim day to sell the items and purchase food. See Yechave Da’at 6:45\nfor a discussion of this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

First the Mishna says that the prohibition is only on wearing as the verse clearly says.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Kilayim 9.2) הכרים והכסתות אין בהם משום כלאים, ובלבד שלא יהיה בשרו נוגע בהן ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Pillows and blankets</strong> are included.  The Rash explains, according to Gemara Yoma 69a, that from the verses clothes that cover the body are prohibited, and, as the Mishna  Kilayim 9.2 says for sheets or blankets , even if they don't touch the body, e.g. if a kosher cloth isolates them from the skin, the Gemara adds the same rule for soft sheets or blankets on which you lie. (1)</p>\n<p>For a <strong>pillow or a mattress</strong>: this last stringency is not mentioned because their prohibition is rabbinical. Chachamim have are worry perhaps a hair from the pillow will wrap around the body. See <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A9%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA YD 301.1</a> When there is a separation, this Chashash is no more actual.</p>\n<p>A <strong>saddle</strong> doesn't have the same rule as a pillow as written in Mishna 4, because it's harder. But there is an additional doubt that one may make from the saddle a patch for clothes and then the problem will be the same as for a pillow. One cannot wear a saddle on the shoulder, even to avoid getting dirty. If a hard fabric is placed on a padded mattress, it becomes equivalent to a pillow. SA YD 301.8.</p>\n<p><strong>Towels</strong> are also prohibited d'rabanan because one may use them as gloves to protect hands. Rash in Mishna 3, following Rabbi Eliezer. Yerushalmi rules as Rabbi Eliezer. SA YD 301.9.</p>\n<p><strong>Bath towels</strong> may be used to cover oneself and are also prohibited rabbinically. <strong>Towels used at a hairdresser</strong> if there is an intent to use them as clothes are also prohibited. In Mishna Shabbat 5.3 they prohibit <strong>to keep in the hand ropes of wool and of linen knoted together</strong> because they can warm up the hand. SA YD 301.10</p>\n<p>So in summary from your list</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>curtains -> as towels SA YD 301.11</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>carpets -> sometime a little padded and sometime have lengthy hairs</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>chairs, sofas and armchairs -> padded</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>handbags -> can warm up the hand</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>pillows -> meforash in Mishna</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>stuffed toys -> can warm up the hands</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>tablecloths -> as towels because they are sometimes used as towels</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the second part of the question, you need to check how this fabrics are made in the country they come from. In many cities in Israel there is a Shaatnez laboratory. You can ask where is that known problems. Nowadays Shaatnez is relatively rare.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1): Mishna 9.2.

Any positive act designed to hasten the\n  death of the patient is equated with murder in Jewish law, even if death\n  is hastened by only a matter of moments. <strong>No matter how laudable the\n  intentions of the person performing an act of mercy-killing may be, the\n  deed constitutes an act of homicide.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>One nineteenth-century commentator finds this principle reflected\n  in the verse \"But your blood of your lives will I require; from the hand\n  of every beast will I require it; and from the hand of man, from the\n  hand of a person's brother, will I require the life of man\" (Genesis 9:5).\n  Fratricide is certainly no less heinous a crime than ordinary homicide.\n  Why then, having already prohibited homicide, is it necessary for Scripture to prohibit fratricide as well? R. Ya'akov Zevi Mecklenberg, in his\n  commentary on the Pentateuch, Ha-Ketav ve-ha-Kabbalah, astutely\n  comments that, while murder is the antithesis of brotherly love, in some\n  circumstances the taking of the life of one's fellow man may be perceived as indeed being an act of love par excellence. Euthanasia,\n  designed to put an end to unbearable suffering, is born not of hatred or\n  anger, but of concern and compassion. It is precisely the taking of life in\n  circumstances in which it is manifestly obvious that the perpetrator is\n  motivated by feelings of love and brotherly compassion that the Torah\n  finds necessary to brand as murder, pure and simple. <strong>Despite the noble\n  intent which prompts such an action, mercy-killing is proscribed as an\n  unwarranted intervention in an area which must be governed by God\n  alone.</strong> The life of man may be reclaimed only by the Author of life. So\n  long as man is yet endowed with a spark of life-as defined by God's\n  eternal law-man dare not presume to hasten death, no matter how\n  hopeless or meaningless continued existence may appear to be in the\n  eyes of a mortal perceiver.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(TRADITION 30:3 / Copyright 1996 Rabbinical Council of America, pages 52-52)</p>\n\n<p>However, there is a famous story of the death of Rabbi Chanina Ben Tradyon and his executioner from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avodah_Zarah.18a.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 18a</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר לו קלצטונירי: רבי אם אני מרבה בשלהבת ונוטל ספוגין של צמר מעל לבך אתה מביאני לחיי העולם הבא?<br>\n  אמר לו הן. השבע לי. נשבע לו. <strong>מיד הרבה בשלהבת ונטל ספוגין של צמר מעל לבו</strong>.<br>\n  <strong>יצאה נשמתו במהרה</strong> אף הוא קפץ ונפל לתוך האור.</p>\n  \n  <p>The executioner said to him: My teacher, if I increase the flame and take off the tufts of wool from your heart, <strong>so that you will die sooner and suffer less</strong>, will you bring me to the life of the World-to-Come? Rabbi Ḥanina ben Teradyon said to the executioner: Yes. The executioner said: Take an oath for me, that what you say is true. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Teradyon took the oath for him, and <strong>the executioner immediately increased the flame and took off the tufts of wool from his heart, causing his soul to leave his body quickly.</strong> The executioner too leaped and fell into the fire and died. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not only is the suicide of the executioner apparently condoned, but his act of \"mercy\", hastening the death of R. Chaninah earns him a place in the world to come. </p>\n\n<p>Is, then, euthanasia on a Jew allowed if performed by a non-Jew?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems that Rambam differentiates between a heaven-induced death and human-induced one (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Murderer_and_the_Preservation_of_Life.2.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rotzeah 2, 7</a>:)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֶחָד הַהוֹרֵג אֶת הַבָּרִיא אוֹ אֶת הַחוֹלֶה הַנּוֹטֶה לָמוּת.<br>\n  <strong>וַאֲפִלּוּ הָרַג אֶת הַגּוֹסֵס נֶהֱרָג עָלָיו</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>וְאִם הָיָה גּוֹסֵס בִּידֵי אָדָם</strong> כְּגוֹן שֶׁהִכּוּהוּ עַד שֶׁנָּטָה לָמוּת וַהֲרֵי הוּא גּוֹסֵס.<br>\n  הַהוֹרְגוֹ <strong>אֵין בֵּית דִּין מְמִיתִין אוֹתוֹ</strong>: </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> Mishna Sanhedrin 6,4</p>\n\n<p>It appears that all the opinions you quoted in the first part refer to the former. But in the case of the later, when the death is caused by another human it is (seemingly allowed) not so forbidden even by a Jew for a Jew, in other words, if a Gentile, say, tortures a Jew it is allowed to hasten his death. See also R' Moshe's IM Y\"D 2, 174-2.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The question is so fascinating that I found another aspect to it. As it happens many times with the stories in the Bavli, they are repeated elsewhere with different details, so I was looking for the same story in a different Masechet.</p>\n\n<p>So the same story is told completely differently in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tractate_Kallah.5.4?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mas. Kalah 5, 4</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמרו עליו על רבי חנינא בן תרדיון שפעם אחת נתחלפו לו מעות פורים במעות של צדקה <strong>והיה יושב ותמיה ואמר אוי לי שמא נתחייבתי מיתה לשמים</strong>.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So in the beginning of the story R\"C was wondering if he was sentenced to death by the heavenly court.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עד שהיה יושב ותמיה בא קסטינר א״ל רבי גזרו עליך לכורכך ולשורפך בתורתך ולישראל עמך.<br>\n  ועמד וכרכוהו בתורתו והקיפוהו חבילי זמורות.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the executioner came and told R\"C that he is to be put to death by the Romans... </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והציץ בו האור והיה אור מצטנן ומתרחק ממנו. עמד קסטינר בבהלה. א׳׳ל רבי אתה הוא שגזרו לשורפך? א״ל הן. א״ל ולמה האור מכבה א״ל נשבעתיו בשם קוני שלא יגע בי עד שאדע אם גזרו עלי מן השמים המתן לי שעה אחת ואודיעך. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the fire couldn't touch R\"C and the executioner wondered if he's one who's sentenced to death. But R\"C sweared the fire not to touch him until he knows the verdict.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היה קסטינר יושב ותמיה. אמר הללו שגוזרין מיתה וחיים לעצמן למה עול מלכות עליהן? א\"ל קום לך וכל מה שמלכות רוצה לעשות - בי יעשה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The executioner said to R\"C - you're free to go ...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר לו ריקה, הסכימה עלי <strong>גזרה מן השמים ואם אין אתה הורגני הרבה הורגים יש למקום</strong> ... אלא סוף שהמקום עתיד ליפרע דמי מידך. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>And then R\"C realised that that was the verdict of the heavenly court</strong> - that he's to be put to death and it has to be by that executioner. (This is THE Chidush here that's missing from AZ 18a version.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וידע קסטינר שכך היא המדה מיד עמד ונפל על פניו וכיון אבד והשמיע קולו מן האש ואמר באשר תמותי אמות ושם אקבר באשר תחיה אחיה מיד יצתה בת קול ואמרה רבי חנינא בן תרדיון וקסטנירו מזומנין לחיי העולם הבא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What we see here is that R\"C already knew he was sentenced by the court and he was <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/search?q=%D7%92%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%20%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%90&tab=text&tvar=1&tsort=chronological&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">גברא קטילא</a>.

However, the gemara in megila 7a seems to imply that two different items should be used. This is how the Aruch Hashulchan (695:14) seems to hold. So if you send a dark piece of meat and a white piece of meat those are considered two separate  manos since they taste different. Rav Eliyashiv (Ashrei Ha’Ish pg 311:5)\nholds that two different drinks counts as two manos. So it seems according to this two different apples would count as two separate manos, especially if they taste different. \nRav Eliyashiv also held that two big pieces of the same thing may be considered two separate manos. However, he held that one should be machmir and use different items,or at least two separate parts of a chicken.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shmuel Kamenetsky in Kovetz Halachos 17:2 holds that one should not use two of the same thing, based off the Aruch Hashulchan 695:14.

Those whose eyes will be opened will be called \"the children of miracles.\"\"</p>\n\n<p>Pastor Huch's book is available on Google in preview if you would like to view the entire page this was stated on for context.</p>\n\n<p>The other is a quote from Pastor Rod Parsley who made a similar claim/statement/quote in a message delivered from his Church. Parsley stated:</p>\n\n<p>\"A prominent Jewish rabbi was teaching ten thousand rabbis, and here's what he said, \"Messiah is ready to come right now.

Alternatively, I suggested that the distinction between these two forms of storing lies in <em>what</em> is being stored. In the Biblical examples the word teivah refers specifically to “storing” a live person, i.e. Noah and his family or the baby Moshe.

The Rambam explains in the halacha above that learning Tora is an obligation and needs a very large investment. It is not the case for other studies.

He didn’t appear to him. [R’ Yehoshua Ben Levi] fasted many fasts, and Eliyahu appeared to him. [When asked why he didn’t appear, Eliyahu] said to him, “Would I appear to informers?” [R’ Yehoshua Ben Levi] said to him, “Wasn’t I fulfilling a teaching [i.e. the Tosefta]?” [Eliyahu] said to him, “Is that the teaching for pious ones?!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rambam, Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah 5:5:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְכֵן אִם אָמְרוּ לָהֶם עוֹבְדֵי כּוֹכָבִים תְּנוּ לָנוּ אֶחָד מִכֶּם וְנַהַרְגֶּנּוּ וְאִם לָאו נַהֲרֹג כֻּלְּכֶם. יֵהָרְגוּ כֻּלָּם וְאַל יִמְסְרוּ לָהֶם נֶפֶשׁ אַחַת מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל. וְאִם יִחֲדוּהוּ לָהֶם וְאָמְרוּ תְּנוּ לָנוּ פְּלוֹנִי אוֹ נַהֲרֹג אֶת כֻּלְּכֶם. אִם הָיָה מְחֻיָּב מִיתָה כְּשֶׁבַע בֶּן בִּכְרִי יִתְּנוּ אוֹתוֹ לָהֶם. וְאֵין מוֹרִין לָהֶם כֵּן לְכַתְּחִלָּה. וְאִם אֵינוֹ חַיָּב מִיתָה יֵהָרְגוּ כֻּלָּן וְאַל יִמְסְרוּ לָהֶם נֶפֶשׁ אַחַת מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל:</p>\n  \n  <p>Likewise, if the idolaters say to them, “Give is one of you that we may kill him, and if not, we’ll kill all of you,” let them kill al of them, and not hand over a single Jewish life. But if they single him out, and they say, “Give us so-and-so, or we’ll kill all of you,” if he is liable to the death penalty like Sheva Ben Bichri, give him to them, but we don’t rule to them like this initially. If he is not liable to death, let them kill all of them, and do not hand over a single Jewish life. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Kesef Mishnah ad. loc.:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ופסק רבינו כר''ל אף על גב דמן הסתם לא קיי''ל כוותיה לגבי דר' יוחנן משום דהוי ספק נפשות ולהחמיר דלא ימסרוהו בידים ביד העובדי כוכבים ועוד דמתניתא מסייעא ליה דקתני כשבע בן בכרי משמע כשחייב מיתה כמותו דוקא ומקרא איכא למידק הכי שאל''כ למה ליה ליואב למימר נשא יד במלך בדוד כלומר והרי הוא חייב מיתה משמע דאי לאו הכי לא היו רשאים למוסרו לו וסובר רבינו דההוא בר נש דריב''ל היה חייב מיתה כשבע בן בכרי ואפ''ה לא איתגלי ליה אליהו מפני שמסרו וא''ל וזו משנת חסידים היא אלמא דלכתחילה אין מורים כן: </p>\n  \n  <p>The Rambam rules like Reish Lakish, even though normally we don’t hold like him against R’ Yochanan, because it’s a doubt regarding life-and-death, for which we’re stringent not to actively hand him over to idolaters. Further, the teaching implies like him, since it teaches “like Sheva Ben Bichri,” implying that he was liable to death, like him. Further, one can infer from the passuk, because if this is not so, then why did Yoav need to say, “He raised his hand against King David”, that is to say, that he’s liable to the death penalty? This implies that otherwise they would have been unable to hand him over. The Rambam holds that the man by R’ Yehoshua Ben Levi was liable to the death penalty like Sheva Ben Bichri, but nevertheless Eliyahu did not appear to him, since he handed him over. He said to him, “Is this the teaching for pious ones?!” - we see that initially we do not rule like this. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Kesef Mishnah continues:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כתב הרמ''ך אף על פי שנמצא בתוספתא כדבריו לא ידענא טעמא מאי דהא מסיק בגמרא (פסחים כ''ה) דמש''ה אמרינן בשפיכות דמים יהרג ואל יעבור דסברא הוא מאי חזית דדמא דידך סומק טפי והכא ליכא האי סברא דהא יהרגו כלם והוא עצמו ומוטב שיהרג הוא עצמו ואל יהרגו כולם. ואני אומר שאין טענתו טענה על התוספתא דאיכא למימר דהתם שאני שיחדו לו וא''ל קטול לפלניא ומש''ה אי לאו טעמא דמאי חזית דדמא דידך סומק טפי לא הוה אמרינן דיהרג ואל יעבור והיינו דקתני סיפא יחדוהו להם אבל ברישא שלא יחדוהו שלא אמרו אלא תנו אחד מכם ונהרוג אותו בכל אחד מהם שירצו למסור אותו איכא למימר להו מאי חזיתו שתמסרו את זה תמסרו אחד מכם ותצילו את זה דמאי חזיתו דדמא דהאיך סומק טפי דלמא דמא דהאי סומק טפי וע''פ טענה זו א''א להם למסור שום אחד מהם אבל אי קשיא על ר''ל קשיא דאמר שאע''פ שיחדוהו להם אם אינו חייב מיתה לא ימסרוהו דהא ליכא הכא סברא דמאי חזית דדמא דידך סומק טפי שהרי הוא והם נהרגים אם לא ימסרוהו. ואפשר לומר דס''ל לר''ל שמ''ש דבש''ד סברא הוא אינו עיקר הטעם דקבלה היתה בידם דש''ד יהרג ואל יעבור אלא שנתנו טעם מסברא להיכא דשייך אבל אין ה''נ דאפילו היכא דלא שייך האי טעמא הוי דינא הכי דיהרג ואל יעבור: </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, he quotes the Ramach, who asks why we don’t apply the general rule that murder is forbidden, based on “what do you see that his blood is redder - maybe your blood is redder.” Seemingly we don’t apply that here, as even if he is included in the group, we still kill all of them according to the Rambam and according to Reish Lakish. </p>\n\n<p>The Kesef Mishnah takes issue with this argument, saying that without “what do you see,” we wouldn’t require that he be liable to the death penalty when he’s singled out to permit his being handed over. In the first case, where they don’t single anyone out, the logic is that nobody can be handed over, because who can determine who’s blood is “reddest”? The question on Reish Lakish, he says, is the case where he’s singled out but not liable to the death penalty: why don’t we say the fact that he’s singled out makes his blood “redder,” since he’s going to die anyway? Perhaps, he says, the reason that one must give up his life by murder is not the logic, but a tradition; the logic was later posed to justify the tradition, but the law still holds even when the logic does not. </p>\n\n<p>I feel justified in applying all of this to your case, where he says to kill him, rather than to give him over to be killed, based on the Kesef Mishnah: the same logic of being stringent by life-and-death and therefore not actively handing him over extends to not actively killing him as well. Additionally, because the second half of the Kesef Mishnah explicitly compares this case with a standard case of murder, by attempting to apply “what do you see,” we see another proof that the two cases can be equated. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Therefore:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Your logic is the one posed by R’ Yehudah and R’ Yochanan, but the Halacha does not follow them. Even though he was singled out, unless he happens to be liable to the death penalty, one may not kill him, but rather allow both of them to be killed. </p>\n\n\n",

The question arises as to whether she can (if she married a kohein) eat of his t'rumah. One element of the answer is that, min hatorah, she can because the eirusin status is enough to allow her to do so regardless of the nesuin status, but the robonon extended the law and require nisuin so as to avoid potential problems that could arise if she, still living in her father's house, brought back any t'rumah from her betrothed.

For relevant sources, see <a href=\"https://www.kashrut.com/articles/turk_part4/#:%7E:text=TRANSMITTING%20A%20MESORAH,Wadi%20El%20Arish.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The former opinion seems to indicate that even if a verbal mesorah was cut off at some point, a written and/or pictorial description would be enough to bring it back or to transfer it to a community that didn't originally have the mesorah.</p>\n<p><em>Once the mesorah for a bird is gone it's gone forever OR it could potentially be \"reawakened\"?</em></p>\n<p>Rabbi Zivotofsky <a href=\"https://www.kashrut.com/articles/turk_part4/#:%7E:text=EXTENDING%20OR%20%22CREATING%22%20A%20MESORAH%3A\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lists</a> several ways in which a mesorah can be extended to unknown birds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kilayim: If the offspring of two birds isn't considered kilayim, then the mesorah of one extends to the other.</li>\n<li>Eggs: A demonstration that the eggs of one species of bird are indistinguishable from the eggs of a known kosher bird would lead to the inclusion of the former species within the latter.</li>\n<li>Shachen ve'nidmeh: If an unknown bird lives with a known (kosher or non-kosher) bird and resembles it, it follows the mesorah or lack thereof of that other bird.</li>\n<li>Goose comparison: Any non-predatory (<em>dores</em>) bird that has a wide beak and webbed feet is considered part of the goose family and therefore kosher.</li>\n<li>Hybridization test: Based on the gemara that states that kosher and non-kosher animals cannot breed, testing whether an unknown bird can breed with a known kosher or non-kosher bird would verify whether it is kosher or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in other words, according to some opinions, if we had a written mesorah for the dodo, that would appear to be enough to go back to consuming it. But others think that only a verbal mesorah from a prominent individual from a community that had such a tradition to eat the dodo would allow us to eat it. However, there are ways to extend a mesorah to unknown birds. If we find that one of the above options is relevant for the dodo, then maybe, just maybe, we may find ourselves chowing down on dodo schnitzel some Shabbos in the future.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Blessing Over Kiddush Covering Future Drinks\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This past Shabbat, my Rabbi's father-in-law was over and they disagreed over whether or not to say a blessing.</p>\n\n<p>After Shacharit, my Rabbi said kiddush over wine, ate <em>mezonot</em>, and then (as always) wanted to have a few <em>l'chaims</em>. So, he proceeded to say <em>shehacol</em> over the scotch. His father-in-law said that <em>borei pri hagafen</em> covered his scotch and the <em>shehacol</em> blessing was in vain.</p>\n\n<p>So, does the blessing over the kiddush wine cover future drinks at the kiddush?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>His father in law is correct. When one makes hagefen and then drinks more than a reevis then that will exempt all other drinks (assuming they are on the table). However,if one goes to a kiddush and only hears kiddush but doesnt drink the wine then they would require a bracha for all other drinks. It's the bracha on wine and the drinking as well which absolves all other drinks.</p>\n\n<p>Source: Shulchan Aruch 174:2.</p>\n\n<p>Relevant Mishna Brurah (<a href=\"http://mishnaberura.eu5.org/14_sh_mishna.html#HtmpMishna4119_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודע שאם קידש על היין והוציא אחרים בברכתו אם לא טעמו מכוס של קידוש ורוצים לשתות שארי משקין אף שהיו לפניהם בשעה שבירך על היין צריכים לברך על המשקין כי הטעם שיין פוטר הוא משום שכל המשקים טפלים לו וכשאינו שותה לא שייך טעם זה ועיין בבה\"ל מה שכתבנו עוד בענין זה:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (OC 174:2) rules:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יין פוטר כל מיני משקין: הגה אפילו מברכה ראשונה (הר\"י פרק כיצד מברכין וב\"י בשם הפוסקים):</p>\n  \n  <p>Wine exempts all types of drinks. Rema: Even from a first Beracha. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah (§3) comments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל מיני משקים - ובלבד שיהיו לפניו על השלחן בשעה שבירך על היין [דאלו לא היו לפניו בשעת ברכה אף שהביאו המשקין לפניו בשעה שעמד עדיין היין לפניו לא מהני וצריך לברך עליהם] ויש מקילין אפילו לא היו לפניו ורק שהיה דעתו עליהם</p>\n  \n  <p>All types of drinks - Provided that they’re on the table before him when he made the blessing on the wine. For if they were not before him at the time of the blessing, even when they bring the drinks before him at the time that he stands, and the wine is still before him, it doesn’t help, and he needs to make a blessing on them. Some are lenient, even if they were not before him, just that his intent was on them. </p>\n  \n  <p>וכ\"ז בשלא קבע עצמו לשתות יין ורק כוס זה בלבד אבל אם קבע לשתות יין הסכימו כמה אחרונים דפוטר אפילו המשקין שלא היו לפניו בשעת ברכה כיון שבאו לפניו עכ\"פ בעוד שהיין לפניו [ואם באו לפניו אחר גמר שתיית היין צריך לברך על המשקין כ\"כ מהר\"מ בנעט בביאורו אם לא שהיה דעתו על המשקין קודם גמר השתיה] ולכתחלה טוב יותר לעולם שיהיו שאר המשקין לפניו בעת ברכתו על היין.</p>\n  \n  <p>All this is when he did not establish himself to drink wine, just this cup alone. But if he established to drink wine, many Achronim agree that he exempts even the drinks which were not before him at the time of the blessing, since they come before him in any event when the wine is still before him. If they came before him after he finished drinking the wine, he needs to make a blessing on the drinks, if his intent wasn’t on the drinks before he finished drinking. Ideally, it’s always much better that the other drinks be before him when he makes the blessing on the wine. </p>\n  \n  <p>ודע שאם קידש על היין והוציא אחרים בברכתו אם לא טעמו מכוס של קידוש ורוצים לשתות שארי משקין אף שהיו לפניהם בשעה שבירך על היין צריכים לברך על המשקין כי הטעם שיין פוטר הוא משום שכל המשקים טפלים לו וכשאינו שותה לא שייך טעם זה ועיין בבה\"ל מה שכתבנו עוד בענין זה:</p>\n  \n  <p>And know that if he made Kiddush on the wine and fulfilled others[‘ obligations] with his blessing, if they did not taste from the cup of Kiddush and want to drink other drinks, even if they were before them at the time that he made the blessing on the wine, they need to make a blessing on the drinks. The reason that wine exempts is because all drinks are secondary to it, but when one doesn’t drink, this reasoning doesn’t apply. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on the above, I see several explanations for the argument between your Rabbi and father-in-law:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Your Rabbi is Sefardi, while the father-in-law is Ashkenazi. Only the Rema says that a first-Beracha is exempted; the Shulchan Aruch doesn’t agree to that. </li>\n<li>Both are Ashkenazi, but the father-in-law interpreted that he always goes to drink scotch afterwards as meaning that your Rabbi had the scotch in mind when he made Kiddush. Your Rabbi didn’t have the scotch in mind, and so it wasn’t included.</li>\n<li>Your Rabbi held like the first opinion cited in the Mishnah Berurah, that the drinks must be before him when Kiddush is made for them to be exempted, while his father-in-law held like the second opinion, that even if they’re not before him, as long as he has them in mind, they’re exempted. </li>\n<li>The father-in-law interpreted that he always goes to drink scotch afterwards as meaning that he was establishing himself to drink, so it would be included. Your Rabbi held that it’s not a drinking session; perhaps this is because it was interrupted by the Mezonos, perhaps this is because the later drinks need to be wine to fix it as a drinking session. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Therefore the only subject that is a fulfillment of Talmud Torah without understanding is the Torah itself, since even when reading without understanding it is God's words that are being read.

To learn Mishna is this. The Shlah (1) in masechet shevuot (the name of a part of the book) says that learning with Bartenura is called Gemara, not Mishna. Mishna is to read and memorize with a very minimal understanding of the words. One doesn't need to know If there is a חסורי מחסרא והכי קתני or other important things to understand rightly the Mishna.

Without speculating as to the reason for this, it seems clear that the most humane course of action which also protects David and his army from misuse is to render the horses unfit for battle.</p>\n<p>After additional searching I found these sources which I have not been able to consult directly</p>\n<p>Richard A. Gabriel, \"The Great Armies of Antiquity\" (2002).

For this reason many jewish cemeteries are laid out in a fashion that mourners standing in front of the grave will actually be facing towards the Temple Mount. That way, mourners don't have to turn away from the grave in order to say Kaddish, but that is more of an emotional than a Halachic thing. Some might even hold it to be disrespectful to the dead to face towards the grave when davening, if that is not also the direction of the Temple Mount. Just as we refrain from Mizvot (like Tallit and Tefilin) and other activities (like eating or running) on cemeteries because the dead cannot participate in them, turning towards the grave (and away from the Temple Mount) when saying Kaddish might be considered as ostentatious. We say Kaddish for the benefit of the souls of the deceased, but we direct Kaddish towards Hashem, not a (dead) body.</p>\n\n\n",

That way, it was the coins being counted, not the people, and so the Evil Eye would not rule over them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -5)\n\n<p><strong>David decides to take a census</strong></p>\n\n<p>II Samuel, chapter 24, records one of the most puzzling stories in the Bible. II Samuel 24:9 tells us that King David took a census that resulted in a plague that killed seventy thousand Israelites. But counting or taking a census in the Bible could be done in order to determine the availability for war, for the division of land, and for tax purposes. But what did David do wrong and why were innocent people, indeed seventy thousand of them, killed by a plague?</p>\n\n<p>In the story, David orders his commanding general Joab to assemble the soldiers to tally people. The procedure ends after nine months and twenty days, when Joab returns with the count of eight hundred thousand men, along with an additional five hundred thousand from Judah as reserves which could be mobilized in a time of war. When David heard this report he immediately began to regret ever having taken the census. For the count has been made public.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did Maimonides think</strong></p>\n\n<p>In his Guide of the Perplexed 2:48, Maimonides explains that whenever the Bible says that G-d did something, it is not that G-d actually did it but what occurred was the result of the laws of nature. Since G-d created the laws of nature, the Bible attributes the event to G-d, since G-d is the ultimate cause. If we understand the text in this way, we can posit that G-d did not really become angry (Rambam felt that G-d does not have emotions).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did David take the census?</strong></p>\n\n<p>David probably undertook the census to gauge how many men or to procure potential soldiers that he could muster for an anticipated battle since David engaged in many wars. For the census, David dispatched his senior officers to determine who was fit for military service. However, the census was done publicly which came to the attention of Israel’s enemies, the very nations that David was assembling forces to fight. When the enemies learned of the census they took preventative measures and mapped out the area of drafting disseminated along Israel's boarder, resulting in an ambush of David’s forces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Natural consequences</strong></p>\n\n<p>After the census, David lamented it was too late. There was nothing he could do but face the consequences. The world functions according to the laws of nature, and one of those laws is that every act has a consequence. Thus, the prophet Gad had three possibilities for David’s negligent behavior. David could have fought the enemy or famine might arise as what happened to Saul. The plague was the result of a great slaughter [decomposing corpses]. Alternatively, the seventy thousand men were killed in battle, a “plague.” This number would have been much smaller had the census not been publicized. After the plague, Gad told David to set an altar where the plague has stopped, as a remembrance for David not to make the same mistake twice. The phrase “David’s Heart Smote Him” is a metaphor for David’s regret since the ancients considered the heart to be the seat of wisdom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>The last chapter of the biblical book of Samuel, if taken literally describes an angry G-d pushing David, resulting in deaths of tens of thousands. This is theologically problematic. But if we read according to Maimonides’ teaching in Guide 2:48, it can be explained in a more rational manner. David was punished due to natural consequences. When David dispatched a military contingent to take a census over a nine-month period which was mistakenly publicized. We can surmise that the enemy discovered the secret, fought or ambushed David’s army, resulting in the deaths of seventy thousand men, followed by a three-day plague.</p>\n\n\n",

Isaac Ben Sheshet</a> has a responsum in which he asserts that the Sages often exaggerated the severity of sins in order to prevent people from stumbling in them. He specifically gives this Talmudic passage about <em>lashon harah</em> as an example of such an exaggeration:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shu\"t HaRivash # 171</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה שאמרת שהגאונים והרשב\"א ז\"ל כתבו שהעובר על החרמים והשבועות הוא בכלל לא ינקה והיינו כעובד ע\"ג דכתיב בה ולא ידבק בידך מאומה מן החרם ע\"כ אם הפליגו להגדיל העון ההוא כמו שעשו חז\"ל שאמרו שבכל עברות שבתורה נאמר בהן ונקה וכאן לא ינקה וכן שנפרעין ממנו ומכל העולם לא אמרו בו שיהרג ואל יעבור כמו באותן ג' עברות וזה לא עלה על דעת שום אדם ולא חשב אנוש אלא שדרך החכמים להפליג בהגדלת העונות כדי שישמר אדם מהכשל בהן אמרו בפ' יש בערכין כל המספר לשון הרע מגדיל עונות כנגד שלש עברות ע\"ג וגלוי עריות ושפיכות דמים וכו' וכן במס' נדרים יצא ר' עקיבא ודרש כל שאינו מבקר את החולה כאלו שופך דמים ובפ' ר\"א דאורג אמרו הקורע בגדיו בחמתו וכו' יהיה בעיניך כעובד ע\"ג היאמר אדם באלו וכיוצא בהם יהרג ואל יעבור הא ליכא למימר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, one is not obligated to give up his life rather than transgress <em>lashon harah</em> because the comparison to the three sins for which one does have to give up his life was just an exaggeration.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Chaim Kanievsky (Doleh U'Maskeh pg.263) was asked this question. He answered that lashon harah is a very grave sin, but one is not chayav misah. In footnote 29 the Orchos Tzadikim shaar Lashon Harah is brought as a source. The Orchos Tzadikim explains why lashon harah is equated with the big 3 sins. See also Shaarei Teshuvah 3:202.</p>\n<p>Orchos Tzadikim (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Orchot_Tzadikim.25.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria translation</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said, \"If one speaks gossip, it is as though he denied God\" (Arakin 15b, and see T.P. Peah, 1:1). As it is said (Ps. 12:15), \"Who have said : 'Our tongue will we make mighty : our lips are with us : who is lord over us?' \" (Arakin 16b, and see T.P. Peah, 1:1). And therefore our Sages considered him as though he denied God, for he does a great evil to his companion, by making him odious in the eyes of the people and causing him other losses, though he himself derives no profit out of this. There is no doubt that one who makes a habit of speaking gossip has thrown off the yoke of Heaven from upon him, for he sins without any benefit to himself, and he is worse than a thief or an adulterer, for they pursue after their pleasure (Shohar Tov, 120:3). And there is no throwing off the yoke of Heaven as bad as when one deals in gossip. <strong>Our Sages further said, \"The sin of gossip is weighed equally with the sin of idolatry and sexual immorality and bloodshed\" (Arakin 15b). Now it is very astonishing that gossip should be equated with these sins, which are those to avoid which a man must rather let himself be killed than transgress (Sanh. 74a). And they said, \"The sin of idolatry is so great that anyone who confesses to it, it is as though he denied the whole Torah\" (Hullin 5a). And they said, \"One who lusts after any form of idolatry, is a rebel against the whole Torah\" (Hullin 4b).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And it is important to give the full meaning in this matter, for a gossip repeats his folly; ten times or more every day he humiliates and shames people, aside from the damage that he does to the one that he speaks against. And even a small transgression, when done many times, becomes great, just as although a single hair is soft and very weak, if you gather many hairs together, you can make of them a strong rope. And when they said that gossip is on a scale with those three mortal sins, they referred to one who commits any of these sins once, because of great temptation, but not to one who is such a complete apostate that he has excluded himself from the people of Israel, in order to commit these sins repeatedly.</strong> Moreover, a gossip finds it difficult to repent, because he is used to this habit and has taught his tongue to speak evil. Furthermore, this sin appears very light in his eyes, for he says, \"I did not do anything — it was just talk.\" He does not consider the great damage he does, and therefore he does not repent. And even if he should repent, his repentance is not complete, for he does not realize the enormity of the sin which he has committed. Moreover, he must first obtain forgiveness from those against whom he has spoken, and he cannot remember whom they all are. And it may happen that he spoke against a man, and did him evil, and caused him harm and forgot what it was that he said about that man, for gossip is always covered up; it is a blow struck in secret. The gossiper is here and smites with his tongue a person who is far away from him (Arakin 15b, Gen. Rabbah 98:19). And this type of sinner is ashamed to let his victim know that he has done him evil. Sometimes he speaks about a defect in the family of the object of his gossip, thus injuring the generations that come after him, and there is no forgiveness for this, for our Sages said, \"For one who speaks about a flaw in a family, there is no forgiveness eternally\" (T.P. Baba Kamma 8:10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/b8sq6.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></p>\n\n\n",

Anything with a rank of '?' means it's not cited; you can filter on those to focus more on the uncited chapters.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Perek_order Perek   Bavli_rank  Yerushalmi_rank\n1    בראשית א   52  30\n2    בראשית ב   66  37\n3    בראשית ג   205 423\n4    בראשית ד   208 319\n5    בראשית ה   375 265\n6    בראשית ו   93  145\n7    בראשית ז   115 380\n8    בראשית ח   185 290\n9    בראשית ט   87  509\n10   בראשית י   524 473\n11   בראשית יא  281 295\n12   בראשית יב  229 392\n13   בראשית יג  210 526\n14   בראשית יד  231 706\n15   בראשית טו  197 694\n16   בראשית טז  573 281\n17   בראשית יז  123 67\n18   בראשית יח  56  129\n19   בראשית יט  167 152\n20   בראשית כ   188 203\n21   בראשית כא  162 487\n22   בראשית כב  142 385\n23   בראשית כג  310 525\n24   בראשית כד  111 92\n25   בראשית כה  89  723\n26   בראשית כו  450 424\n27   בראשית כז  169 387\n28   בראשית כח  214 297\n29   בראשית כט  435 676\n30   בראשית ל   269 313\n31   בראשית לא  217 143\n32   בראשית לב  165 342\n33   בראשית לג  174 576\n34   בראשית לד  462 95\n35   בראשית לה  331 402\n36   בראשית לו  461 550\n37   בראשית לז  156 439\n38   בראשית לח  125 98\n39   בראשית לט  250 438\n40   בראשית מ   778 196\n41   בראשית מא  338 236\n42   בראשית מב  394 126\n43   בראשית מג  346 668\n44   בראשית מד  558 534\n45   בראשית מה  528 352\n46   בראשית מו  500 519\n47   בראשית מז  317 139\n48   בראשית מח  135 131\n49   בראשית מט  71  119\n50   בראשית נ   184 320\n51   שמות א     120 ?\n52   שמות ב     190 178\n53   שמות ג     168 457\n54   שמות ד     107 96\n55   שמות ה     534 667\n56   שמות ו     293 356\n57   שמות ז     516 ?\n58   שמות ח     705 ?\n59   שמות ט     665 722\n60   שמות י     750 539\n61   שמות יא    540 470\n62   שמות יב    4   1\n63   שמות יג    49  44\n64   שמות יד    294 184\n65   שמות טו    63  124\n66   שמות טז    80  65\n67   שמות יז    227 364\n68   שמות יח    131 177\n69   שמות יט    84  91\n70   שמות כ     37  16\n71   שמות כא    2   17\n72   שמות כב    6   22\n73   שמות כג    38  14\n74   שמות כד    85  94\n75   שמות כה    69  36\n76   שמות כו    133 142\n77   שמות כז    114 193\n78   שמות כח    74  49\n79   שמות כט    61  63\n80   שמות ל     60  29\n81   שמות לא    113 168\n82   שמות לב    90  53\n83   שמות לג    118 191\n84   שמות לד    48  54\n85   שמות לה    206 81\n86   שמות לו    459 459\n87   שמות לז    ?

    "content": "# Are OC 3:2 and 3:13 practiced nowadays?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In OC 3, the Shulchan Aruch discusses many halachos regarding using the bathroom. Many of these seem to be disregarded with the relatively modern invent of the urinal; this is particularly concerning in public restrooms, since most of these halachos are because of <em>tzni'us</em>. Specifically:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rema, §2:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויסגור הדלת בעדו משום צניעות</p>\n  \n  <p>He should close the door for himself because of <em>tzni'us</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Urinals usually aren't enclosed behind doors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SA, §13:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא ישתין מעומד מפני ניצוצות הניתזין על רגליו אם לא שיעמוד במקום גבוה או שישתין לתוך עפר תחוח</p>\n  \n  <p>One should not urinate while standing because of sprinkles that fall on his legs, if he doesn't stand in a high place or urinate on loose dirt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem here should be obvious.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is it actually forbidden to use a urinal for these reasons?</li>\n<li>If the answer to #1 is \"yes,\" then why do so many shuls and other frum institutions have them?</li>\n<li>If the answer to #1 is \"no,\" then why?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Geviha ben Pesisa give the response that he gave to the Mitzri'im?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.91a.6-9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 91a</a> records the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שוב פעם אחת באו בני מצרים לדון עם ישראל לפני אלכסנדרוס מוקדון אמרו לו הרי הוא אומר (שמות יב, לו) וה' נתן את חן העם בעיני מצרים וישאילום תנו לנו כסף וזהב שנטלתם ממנו</p>\n<p>Further, one time, the children of Mitzraim came to judgement with Yisrael before Alexandar the Macedonian. They said to him, \"Behold, it says (Shemos 12:36), 'And Hashem gave the grace of the nation in the eyes of Mitzraim, and they lent them.'\" Give us the silver and gold that you took from us!</p>\n<p>אמר גביהא בן פסיסא לחכמים תנו לי רשות ואלך ואדון עמהן לפני אלכסנדרוס אם ינצחוני אמרו להם הדיוט שבנו נצחתם ואם אני אנצח אותם אמרו להם תורת משה רבינו נצחתכם נתנו לו רשות והלך ודן עמהן</p>\n<p>Geviha ben Pesisa said to the Chachamim, \"Give to me permission and I will go and do judgement with them before Alexandar. If they triumph over me, say to them, 'You triumphed over an average person among us.' If I triumph over them, say to them, 'The Torah of Moshe Rabbeinu triumphed over you.'\" They gave him permission, and he went and judged with them.</p>\n<p>אמר להן מהיכן אתם מביאין ראייה אמרו לו מן התורה אמר להן אף אני לא אביא לכם ראייה אלא מן התורה שנאמר (שמות יב, מ) ומושב בני ישראל אשר ישבו במצרים שלשים שנה וארבע מאות שנה תנו לנו שכר עבודה של ששים ריבוא ששיעבדתם במצרים שלשים שנה וארבע מאות שנה</p>\n<p>He said to them, \"From where do you bring your proof?\" They said to him, \"From the Torah.\" He said to them, \"Also I will not bring to you a proof except from the Torah, as it says (Shemos 12:40), 'And the dwelling of Bnei Yisrael that they dwelled in Mitzraim was 430 years.' Give to us the payment for work of 600,000 who you enslaved in Mitzraim for 430 years.\"</p>\n<p>אמר להן אלכסנדרוס מוקדון החזירו לו תשובה אמרו לו תנו לנו זמן שלשה ימים נתן להם זמן בדקו ולא מצאו תשובה מיד הניחו שדותיהן כשהן זרועות וכרמיהן כשהן נטועות וברחו ואותה שנה שביעית היתה</p>\n<p>Alexandar of Macedonia said to them, \"Return to him a response.\" They said to him, \"Give us time - 3 days.\" He gave them time. They searched and did not find a response. Immediately they left their fields when they were planted and their vineyards when they were planted, and they fled. That year was a Shemitah year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Contrast <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avot_D%27Rabbi_Natan.41.9?vhe=Talmud_Bavli,_Vilna_1883_ed.&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos d'Rebbi Nassan 41:9</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כסף מצרים חזר למקומה שנאמר (שמות יב) וינצלו את מצרים ואומר (בראשית מז) וילקט יוסף את כל הכסף [ ואומר (מלכים א יד) ויהי בשנה החמישית למלך רחבעם עלה שישק מלך מצרים וגו׳ ויקח את אוצרות בית ה׳ וגו׳].</p>\n<p>The money of Mitzraim returned to its place, as it says (Shemos 12:36), \"And they emptied out Mitzraim,\" and it says (Bereishis 47:14), \"And Yosef gathered all the money.\" And it says (Melachim 1:14:25-26), \"And it was in the fifth year of King Rechavam, Shishak, king of Mitzraim, came up...and he took the storehouses of the House of Hashem...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So why does Geviha answer \"You owed us at least that much,\" rather than \"You already got it back\"? Is it just that he wants to use Pesukim from the Torah, and this response requires a Passuk from Nach? Or is there a reason why the response he gave was a stronger response?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One possible answer:</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.119a.6-10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 119a</a> it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said: Joseph collected all the silver and gold in the world and brought it to Egypt, as it is stated: “And Joseph collected all the money found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 47:14)...And when the Jewish people ascended from Egypt they took this treasure with them, as it is stated: “They despoiled [vayenatzlu] Egypt” (Exodus 12:36)...And this treasure remained in Eretz Yisrael until the time of Rehoboam, at which point Shishak, king of Egypt, came and took it from Rehoboam, as it is stated: “And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. And he took the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king’s house; and he took away all” (I Kings 14:25–26). Zerah, king of Kush, who ruled over Egypt, later came and took it from Shishak. Asa came and took it from Zerah, king of Kush, when he defeated him in battle (II Chronicles 14) and sent it to Hadrimmon ben Tabrimmon, king of Aram (see I Kings 15). The children of Ammon came and took it from Hadrimmon ben Tabrimmon, as learned by tradition. Jehosaphat came and took it from the children of Ammon (see II Chronicles 20), and it remained in Eretz Yisrael until the reign of Ahaz. Sennacherib came and took it from Ahaz. Hezekiah came and took it from Sennacherib, and it remained in Jerusalem until the reign of Zedekiah. The Chaldeans came and took it from Zedekiah. The Persians came and took it from the Chaldeans. The Greeks came and took it from the Persians. The Romans came and took it from the Greeks, and this treasure of silver and gold still remains in Rome.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see that Geviha ben Pesisa couldn't say \"that gold is already back in your hands\" because it had long not been in the Egyptians' hands. In fact, it had been plundered three more times by <em>the Judeans</em> in the time of Asa, in the time of Yehoshafat and in the time of Chizkiyah, and yet also wasn't in the hands of the Jews at the time, because it had been plundered from them as well. At that point in time it was in the hands of <em>the Greeks</em>. And since the gold was not in the hands of the Jews, the Egyptians still owed them money.</p>\n<p>This actually adds another layer of humor to the story, because both sides knew they couldn't simply turn to Alexander and demand the gold...</p>\n<p>Another possibility is that the total wages of all of the people of Yisrael over hundreds of years amounted to more than the people took from the Egyptians, so even after counting out what they took from them, the Egyptians <em>still</em> owed them.</p>\n\n\n",

However, this opinion has been rejected both within Tanach as well as in the words of Chazal. Behold it is clearly stated “A sorcerer who performs a real act of sorcery is liable, but not one who deceives the eyes” (Sanhedrin 67a). It is even more bewildering that Rambam writes “one who deceives the eyes is exempt” (Hilchot Avodat Kochavim 11:15), and immediately following that, he writes “these actions are entirely falsehood and trickery” (11:16). In truth, it is very tough to explain all of the verses that refer to magic and sorcery if we assume that they are falsehood and trickery. But this is not the case. The sorcery and other magical actions were not all false. <strong>At least some of their performers knew about some hidden powers that even today, science has not yet revealed. It is possible that magnetism and electricity, forces that at that time were unknown, acted for those who knew them as acts of magic. But even other forces that have still not been clarified, may have served as supernatural powers. Their performers did not understand these forces in a scientific way, and did not use them in an appropriate way…</strong> And it would be even less wise to deny all of the historical testimonies such as this just because we do not understand them.

An allusion to the meaning of the name Pharaoh is to be found in the pasuk describing the sin of the Golden Calf: \"Moshe saw that the nation was paruah, exposed, for Aharon praah, had uncovered them\" (Shemos 32:25). Rashi interprets this: Paruah means exposed, for the nation's evil and shame was revealed. Thus, paruah/Pharaoh denotes a breaching of the parameters of the heart, a granting free rein and open license to the evil-inclination. This is Pharaoh. It is to this exposed, unabashed evil-inclination that the Rambam refers when he says that Pharaoh embodies the essence of the evil-inclination. Man's resistance to restriction and confinement lies at the root of all sin. No one wants to be told, - \"No!\"</p>\n\n<p>In addressing the original question, Rav Miller cites the Malbim who underscores Pharaoh's reaction to the concrete display of Hashem's Omnipotence. He explains that the purpose of the first three plagues was to demonstrate that Ani Hashem, \"I am G-d,\" the existence of Hashem's power. The second set of plagues was to demonstrate the concept of Divine Providence. Hashem is powerful, and He controls every aspect of this universe. Now, Pharaoh was threatened. He felt that he was the undisputed ruler of Egypt. No one else could undermine him, or claim this position. Pharaoh could not deal with this. His identity as supreme ruler was being challenged, restricting the extent of his total control over the freedom of others. The third group of plagues crumbled the last vestige of Pharaoh's imaginary power, for they attested, without any room for doubt, that Hashem was the Supreme Ruler and power. Each step in the process called the Ten Plagues presented further indication to Pharaoh, the individual who challenged any form of personal limitation, that his powers were truly restricted.</p>\n\n<p>During this entire process, Pharaoh refused to acknowledge the fact that he was not in control, that he did not dominate. In the beginning, Pharaoh could still render his own decision, but in the third set of plagues, this, too, was taken from him. He was now completely confused. It was at this point that he was admonished, \"How long will you refuse to be humbled before me?\" You have already lost everything. Do you not see that you are not what you think you are? Your mind is no longer your own. You have lost your free choice. You have been censured for refusing to acknowledge your limitations and Hashem's Omnipotence.</p>\n\n<p>Pharaoh's defiance, his virulent objection to the limitation of his own power, identified him as evil incarnate. The Ten Plagues taught him how wrong he was.</p>\n\n<p>P.s. found a lot of commentaries based on  wordplays:\n<a href=\"https://biblicalhebrewetymology.com/2018/12/14/vayigash-pharaoh-exposed-tzvi-abrahams/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://biblicalhebrewetymology.com/2018/12/14/vayigash-pharaoh-exposed-tzvi-abrahams/</a></p>\n\n\n",

Svora hu.”</p>\n\n<p>Although Torah laws themselves must be stated in order to provide sufficient warning [Sanhedrin 56b] and ample reward [see, eg., Chulin 142a], the underlying logical concepts need not be stated.  Sefer HaChinuch views most of the ten commandments and many mishpatim as necessary to prevent destruction of civilization [see, Mitzvos 33-37, 49-54].  These mitzvos, commonly understood as essential, or mitzvos sichlios (rational mitzvos) are nonetheless written in the Torah.  The logical concepts on which they are based are not stated and they are not independent mitzvos.  Tzlach [Berachos 21a] states that logic is insufficient to create a mitzvah d’Oraisa.</p>\n\n<p>The phrase “lamma lee kra” is common throughout the Gemara when seeking to discover why the Torah states a particular point that otherwise would not have been understood.  However, the specific phrase, “Lamma lee kra?  Svora hu” seems to be reserved for only three concepts.  The first, was your example of hamotze mchavero.  The second is mai chazis d’dammach didach sumach t’fei (what makes it appear that your blood is redder) [Sanhedrin 74a; Pesachim 25b; Yoma 82b].  This means, no person has the right to claim that his life is more precious than another’s life.  There is an equal right to live.  The third is peh sh'asur peh sh'hitir (the mouth appearing to restrict, is the same mouth that permits).  This means, one may qualify his own statement, so that it is understood in its entire context [Kesuvos 22a].  Thus, the Gemara stated, “Lamma lee kra?  Svora hu” only with regard to the most basic rights: life, freedom of expression and ownership (life, liberty, property).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding mai chazis, logic alone is not the basis of the mitzvah in the Torah not to take another’s life.  The logic of mai chazis is dependent upon the commandment of lo seertzach (you shall not murder).  Only after the Torah commands us not to murder, is logic able to dictate that murder is prohibited even to preserve one’s own life.  Since this prohibition is fundamental to coexistence, logic is merely used to extend lo seertzach to a situation where one’s personal desire to live might cause him to contemplate taking another’s life.  However, the exceptions to lo seertzach must be explicitly stated in the Torah.  These include, killing a rodef (to stop murder or certain cases of rape)[Sanhedrin 74a, based on Devarim 22:26]; habba b’machteres (for self defense)[Sanhedrin 72a, based on Shemos 22:1]; and Rabbi Akiva’s ruling  that one should drink from his own canteen in order to survive, rather than sharing the water and thereby perishing [Bava Metzia 62a, based on Vayikra 25:36].</p>\n\n<p>It might be argued that there is a fourth case mentioning, “Lamma lee kra?  Svora...hu.”  However, the wording states, “Sevora b’alma hu” [Niddah 25a].  Here, the Gemara uses the usual format of seeking to discover circumstances where a pasuk discloses an aspect of halacha that would not be understood on the basis of logic.  (Similar examples include Yevamos 47a; Kiddushin 41b; inter alia).</p>\n\n<p>With regard to your second example, of shlo tehay choteh niskar, this is a basic principle in every society.  A criminal should not benefit from the fruit of his crime.  This concept is found in Tanach several times.  For example, in Malachim I [21:19], “will you murder and also inherit?”  Again, this is a principle upon which rulings are made.  It is not an independent mitzvah. </p>\n\n<p>A related concept is not permitting one to transgress, in order to prevent another from sinning.  This is expressed as, vchee omrim chateh keday sh’yiske chavercha? [Shabbos 4a].  As such, one may not harm himself spiritually in order to benefit another.  In this regard, Rambam stated, “I have never heard a more remarkable saying than that of the Rabbis in Talmud Yerushalmi, in the ninth chapter of Nedarim, where they strongly criticize those who obligate themselves by oaths and vows, resulting in being bound like prisoners. The exact words they use are, ‘Rabbi Edy said in the name of Rabbi Yitzchak, “Don’t you think, what the Torah prohibits is sufficient, that you need to take on more prohibitions?” [Shemona Perakim, Chap. 4].  This is a remarkable example of the basic logic of not impairing oneself.  Similarly, the Mishnah [Bava Kamma 90b] states that one does not have the right to physically harm himself.  Yet, the Torah does not expressly prohibit it as an independent mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to your third example, kull d'allim gvar (stronger position prevails) [Bava Basra 34b], this is limited to a financial dispute where, as you stated, there is neither evidence nor presumptive ownership.  It applies to circumstances where neither party had prior possession.  Therefore, there can be no presumptive ownership.  Since evidence is not available, it is wrong for a court to become involved with a matter it cannot resolve.  This is the reason the parties are left to resolve their dispute outside of beis din.  The logic of kull d'allim gvar is, the resoluteness of a party investing more effort to obtain the item in dispute, indicates he may be right.  He may eventually come up with proof, since he is making more of an effort  [Rosh, Bava Metzia 2a].  The opposing party would reason, why should I bother, when it is possible my opponent will be able to produce evidence the next day? [Id.]   In the interim, kull d'allim gvar has no evidentiary value.  It simply recognizes the possibility of someone having legitimate possession of an item that had previously been in dispute.  Obviously, the Torah does not need to state various possibilities of what may happen when there is no judicial resolution.</p>\n\n<p>There are other logical concepts that are commonly shared by civilized peoples.  For example, the act of snatching is inherently dishonest [Bava Basra 33b-34a; Shevuos 32b] and during a legal proceeding, failure to deny a claim is generally construed as an admission [Yevamos 87b; Bava Metzia 37b].  These are principles that provide a framework for rulings that are based on human experience.  Since the Torah deploys the speech of people [Berachos 31b], so we can relate to it, certainly the Torah does not need to tell us basics of human interaction.  No system of law attempts to do so, but similarly relies on logic.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -10)\n\n<p><em>A very unpopular but seemingly true answer:</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Judaism lacks consistent and systematical methodology.</strong> Totally.

Both are, as evidenced by the contexts in which they appear, masculine.</p>\n<p>The variation (as opposed to one of the two appearing consistently) is visible in the line you quoted, as well as the next one, which is the <em>pasuk</em> it leads up to.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲנַחְנוּ מוֹדִים לָ<code>ךְ</code> וּמְבָרְכִים אוֹתָ<code>ךְ</code> יִתְבָּרַךְ שִׁמְ<code>ךָ</code> בְּפִי כָּל חַי תָּמִיד לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד:</p>\n<p>וְאָכַלְ<code>תָּ</code> וְשָׂבָעְ<code>תָּ</code> וּבֵרַכְ<code>תָּ</code> אֶת ה' אֱלֹהֶי<code>ךָ</code> עַל הָאָרֶץ הַטֹּבָה אֲשֶׁר נָתַן לָ<code>ךְ</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, what may look like m. m. f. - all with the same referent, followed by what looks like m. m. m. m. f. - all with the same referent.</p>\n<p>I am no genreist, but there are clues in <em>birkas hamazon</em> that it was written in the style of Biblical Hebrew. (An example is the use of the particle \"נא\".) So the pattern of this standard alternation between forms in Biblical Hebrew makes sense to appear in <em>birkas hamazon</em> as well.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I realize as I am writing this that the answer (and possibly the question) already appears <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10890/why-lach-not-lecha-in-modim-anachnu-lach\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As noted <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=1628\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> by Rabbi Elchanan Lewis, in response to the same question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In biblical Hebrew the feminine Lach is used for the masculine form as well in hundreds of cases. (Gen. 3;18 4;6,12 14;21,23 15;1 just to mention a few)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See, however, the answers to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9663/ashkenazic-vs-sefardic-grammar-tendencies\">this question</a>, from which it seems that actually the suffix is the Mishnaic Hebrew version of the masculine.</p>\n<p>That said, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Numbers.11.15.1?vhe=Pentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann_--_corrected_vocalization&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> comments on Numbers 11:15:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם ככה את עושה לי. תָּשַׁשׁ כֹּחוֹ שֶׁל מֹשֶׁה כִּנְקֵבָה כְּשֶׁהֶרְאָהוּ הַקָּבָּ\"ה הַפֻּרְעָנוּת שֶׁהוּא עָתִיד לְהָבִיא עֲלֵיהֶם עַל זֹאת, אָמַר לְפָנָיו, אִם כֵּן, הָרְגֵנִי תְּחִלָּה:</p>\n<p>ואם ככה את עשה לי AND IF THOU DO THUS WITH ME [KILL ME, I PRAY THEE …] — The Hebrew word for “Thou” appears in the feminine form את instead of the masculine אתה to intimate that Moses’ strength grew weak as that of a woman when the Holy one, blessed be He, showed him the punishment which He was to bring in future upon them for this (for their sin). He, (Moses) therefore, said before Him, “If so, kill me first” (Sifrei Bamidbar 91).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gur_Aryeh_on_Bamidbar.11.15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharal</a> (after rejecting other interpretations of the passage) seems to explain there that Moshe's perspective of the Divine influence was weakened as a result of his frustration with the nation's baser tendencies.  Accordingly, Moshe did not witness the Divine influence in his usual way of <em>gevuroth hashem</em> - the might of G-d, associated with the miraculous/subjugation of the natural order.  The \"might-of-G-d\" perspective is that encapsulated by the masculine pronoun; whereas this diminished, weaker perspective is associated with the feminine pronoun.  (Notably, actually ascribing weakness to the Divine is heresy in the eyes of Judaism.  These explanations are focused on the diminished ability of the person witnessing divine influence.)</p>\n<p>Likewise, one might explain that the usage of feminine-seeming forms in our liturgy, might also, on a deeper level, reflect our inability in this world of exile and suffering, to experience the divine at the masculine level of <em>gevuroth hashem</em>.  So instead, we thank Him from our diminished perspective of His \"natural\" influence.</p>\n<p>(See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.32a.28?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhoth 32a</a>.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is an interesting question and hopefully, the following answer will offer some insight and something to reflect upon.</p>\n<p>The G-d we pray to is one, above, meaning transcendent of all division including gender. That concept refers to G-d at the level of essence which is actually above names altogether.</p>\n<p>In the first paragraph of Birkat HaMazone, that level is referenced by the statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>הוא</strong>-נותן לחם לכל-בשר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is similar to the language in the Kedushah for Musaf of Shabbat after saying the first line of Shema. It means that G-d, at <em>His essence</em> (referred to without any name but simply as <em>He</em> in this case) is the actual Giver and Provider of everything.</p>\n<p>Then slightly further in the first paragraph is introduced the first concept of one of G-d's names, Havayeh (יהוה). This name is masculine (even paralleling the physical form of a human male, head, shoulders and arms, torso, and hips and legs) and also associated with the first man, Adam (אדם), who is similar to G-d's name Havayah (דומה לעליון). This follows the teaching of Rabbi Menachem Azaryeh of Fano in his explanation of Bereshit 2:20 (ולאדם) from his discourse, <em>Em Kol Chai</em> regarding the cantillation note, Zakef Gadol above it which has a gematria value of 26 like this particular name of G-d.</p>\n<p>The second paragraph to Birkat HaMazone then changes, as you have noted, to feminine when referring to G-d. This name of G-d is addressing (אהיה) which also  relates to the feminine. This connection is somewhat more complicated.</p>\n<p>These names of G-d also have what are called expansions of those plain names. They are often referred to by their numerical values. One of the expansions for Ehyeh is 161 which is written (אל״ף, ה״י, יו״ד, ה״י). And this expansion is equated with the name that is actually mentioned in the opening lines of Bereshit dealing with the creation and formation of the first man and woman. That name of G-d associated with the first woman is Tzelem (צלם) which actually parallels the physical form of the human female. And that name, including the kollel for the whole name itself is also 161 just like the expansion of Ehyeh.</p>\n<p>So in terms of intention, the gender switch in the second paragraph of Birkat HaMazone is referring to this name of G-d.</p>\n<p>And in this context, it is worth pointing out that these two, four-letter names of G-d (אהיה-יהוה) which correspond to the concepts masculine and feminine, meaning husband and wife, originate from the one, single, six-letter name of G-d, (אהיהוה) which alludes to the union of husband and wife. This was the original state of man, meaning male and female were actually created as one, single being.</p>\n<p>And the creation of the first man (אדם הראשון) also parallels the creation of light (a single light with no source) on the first day and then the creation of the two great (and initially equal) sources of light on the fourth day. This single, six letter name of G-d is actually alluded to in the first posuk of the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

(Frankly, we don't see that this passage mentions the Torah burned at all, so maybe he did remove, then it contradicts the whole point of the Gemmarah in AZ).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How come that the story is told so differently even factually?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Rather, this is metaphoric\n  imagery. [Similarly,] all [such expressions] are metaphoric imagery.</p>\n  \n  <p>A proof of this concept: One prophet says that he saw the Holy One,\n  blessed be He, \"clothed in snow white\" [Daniel 7:9], and another\n  envisioned Him [coming] \"with crimson garments from Batzra\" [Isaiah\n  63:1]. Moses, our teacher, himself envisioned Him at the [Red] Sea as\n  a mighty man, waging war, and, at Mount Sinai, [saw Him] as the leader\n  of a congregation, wrapped [in a tallit].</p>\n  \n  <p>This shows that He has no image or form. All these are merely\n  expressions of prophetic vision and imagery and the truth of this\n  concept cannot be grasped or comprehended by human thought.

With regard\n  to all such statements, our Sages said: \"The Torah speaks in the\n  language of man.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>This is [borne out by the rhetorical question (Jeremiah 7:19):] \"Are\n  they enraging Me?\" Behold, [Malachi 3:6] states: \"I, God, have not\n  changed.\" Now were He to at times be enraged and at times be happy, He\n  would change.

Everyone had sworn not to marry off their daughters to them, but now they regretted their oath because they didn't want the tribe to be permanently destroyed.  They came up with a way to get wives for them without violating the oath - first they destroyed Yaveish Gil'ad, who had disobeyed the community, and left 400 girls alive.  Then they asked the other 200 men to kidnap their wives from Shilo.</p>\n\n<p>From the Shilo story, it appears that the oath only applied to the parents, not the girls.  So instead of the complicated plan, why didn't they just let their daughters marry whomever they wanted, without their parents' involvement?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The theme of the Book of Judges is that from time to time the Jews would worship idols and do stupid things until God would send a judge to get them on the right track.

On this, I have two questions. </p>\n\n<p>1) Where is this source from Rashbi? (Gemarah, Zohar?)</p>\n\n<p>2) There is a mesorah from the Vilna Gaon that there is never any conflict between <em>nigleh</em> and <em>nistar</em>. If this statement is indeed from the Zohar, and is one of <em>nistar</em>, how does this fit into, say, the Rambam's definition of who a <em>kofer</em> is. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The source you are looking for is in the Zohar, parashat Teruma, 131b, traditionally attributed to Rashbi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומאן דמשתעי בבי כנישתא במילין דחול, ווי ליה דאחזי פרודא, ווי ליה דגרע מהימנותא, ווי ליה דלית ליה חולקא באלהא דישראל, דאחזי דהא לית אלהא ולא אשתכח תמן ולא דחיל מניה ואנהיג קלנא בתיקונא עלאה דלעילא</p>\n  \n  <p>And one who speaks about mundane matters in the synagogue: Woe to him for he shows dissension [in the supernal worlds], woe to him for he lessens the faith [in the Divine Unity] and woe to him for he has no part in the G‑d of Israel [for he isn't ashamed to interrupt His praises], because he shows that [<strong>he considers in his mind that</strong>] <strong>G‑d is not present there</strong> [in the synagogue]. And he does not fear Him and he disgraced the supernal perfection of Above [through interruption of prayer with worthless speech]. (Translation by Rahmiel-Hayyim Drizin)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Zohar does not specifically call the talker a <em>kofer</em>, and this and other terms for people labeled as not having a share in the world to come (e.g., <em>apikores</em>) are often conflated in colloquial speech. If you're looking for a link with Rambam's thought, the sin as described by the Zohar sounds more approximate to a definition of the <em>apikores</em>, specifically:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...שלשה הן הנקראים אפיקורסין</p>\n  \n  <p>והאומר שאין הבורא יודע מעשה בני האדם</p>\n  \n  <p>Three individuals are described as Epicursim...one who maintains that the Creator is not aware of the deeds of men.

Perhaps the passuk means that even the tenth generation may not enter, but beyond the tenth generation is permitted?

Rabbi Meir said to him: When it says: “From all your uncleanness, and from all your idols,” this emphasizes that God will purify people from these types of impurity, but not from mamzer status.

And there are other cases of \"sha'Atah\", eg in Emes veYatziv.</p>\n\n<p>In the Torah, you will not find a \"she-\" prefix. HQBH uses \"asher\". (Nor the \"kishe-\" for when / whenever.)</p>\n\n<p>In early Navi, you'll find \"sha-\". Not too often, but one case is in Shofetim 6:17, when Gid'on refers to Hashem as \"sha'Atah\". (Another is the two occurrences of \"shaqqamti\" in Shiras Devorah, 4:7.)</p>\n\n<p>Joshu Blau of the Academy of the Hebrew Language says that this was the Northern contraction of \"asher\", but the Southerner's \"she-\" eventually wins out. (Phonology and Morphology of Biblical Hebrew, pg. 183) Except that Devorah was in Bet-El, so unless she borrowed northern coinage to make the poem work...</p>\n\n<p>Tefillah used to tend toward Mishnaic Hebrew in both Ashk and Seph. With exceptions like the masculine \"lakh\" in \"Modim anachnu Lakh\". But when the printing press made publishing a siddur with nequdos possible, some hypercorrections went into Nusach Ashkenaz by experts convinced we're all saying it wrong.</p>\n\n<p>These tended to be maskilim, as few else in Ashkenaz were studying diqduq. One prominent name is R' Shelomo-Zalman Hanau (Razah). Research seems to indicate his diqduq rules were employed by Lubavitch's Alter Rebbe in making Nusach Ari. But that has been debated here in the past. In any case, somehow, people managed to buy into the idea of changing large chunks of the vowelization of their davening in a comparatively short time.</p>\n\n<p>Although, the medieval manuscripts indicate that we were using Mishnaic Hebrew all along.</p>\n\n<p>These corrections made the Ashk siddur a lot more biblical. It began the debates between \"morid hagasham\" vs \"morid hageshem\", since in Mishnaic Hebrew there is no \"hagashem\", even if it's the last word of the sentence. And in earlier Ashkenaz, they said \"vesein chelqeinu besorasakh, sab'einu mituvakh\" -- just as Seph still say.</p>\n\n<p>The presence of \"sha'Atah\" in Shoferim meant that that became the form in Ashkenazi in the past 2-3 centuries. And indeed, in earlier manuscripts, the word is \"she'Atah\".</p>\n\n<p>In addition, it is possible that the \"sha-\" is the usual contraction for when one word is taking both the \"she-\" and \"ha-\" prefixes. That Gid'on was calling G-d \"The You\", and this is what we're imitating in davening.</p>\n\n\n",

As we taught in the\n    Mishnah (Chagigah 2:7): “The clothing of Amei Ha’aretz [contaminates\n    by] treading for Perushim.”</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Originally, when I read this Bartenura, I interpreted it to mean that the Tzedukim came up with the name; perhaps they meant it disparagingly, that the Chachamim think they're so great, they don't have to mingle with the common people. The Chachamim, on the other hand, took the term as a symbol of pride.</p>\n\n<p>That's what I thought, until I was reminded of Kiddushin 66a, recalling an incident involving several Chachamim who were killed at a banquet held by King Yannai, which began with this comment:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר אלעזר בן פועירה לינאי המלך ינאי המלך לבם של פרושים עליך</p>\n  \n  <p>And Elazar ben Po'irah said to King Yannai, \"The hearts of the Perushim are against you.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.48a.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">King Yannai was Shimon ben Shetach's brother-in-law</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shimon ben Shetach was Antigonos Ish Socho's teacher</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avot_D'Rabbi_Natan.5.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Antigonos was Tzadok's and Baisos's teacher</a>. Thus, the term \"Perushim\" was in use <em>two generations before Tzedukim even existed!</em></p>\n\n<p>My question, therefore, is twofold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Who first used the term Perushim to refer to the Chachamim?</li>\n<li>What was their motivation in doing so? That is, very nice that the term refers to that they separated themselves from Amei HaAretz, but why did this person feel the need to come up with this name? Did they mean it disparagingly, or complimentary?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

It gives the story of how Rebbi Yehuda Ben Bava gave semicha to his five talmidim. The Gemara asks: how can Rebbi Yehuda Ben Bava give semicha alone? Don't you need at least 3 judges? The Gemara answers that there were two other people there as well, but they weren't mentioned because of the honor of Rebbi Yehuda Ben Bava.  </p>\n\n<p>There is a discussion whether all three judges need to have semicha to confer semicha or if only one needs to have semicha. The Ran wants to prove from here that only one needs to have semicha, since if the other two had semicha, they would be mentioned. </p>\n\n<p>My question is: why does Rebbi Yehuda Ben Bava need two extra people according to the Ran?

    "content": "# If copper mirrors were good, leave them?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Torah (Shemot 38:8) tells us that the Kiyor was built with the copper mirrors brought by women. The Midrash (brought in Rashi ad loc) explain that, at first, Moshe wanted to reject the gifts, but Hashem told him to take them, because they were great. Why? Because they helped the Bnai Israel to multiply.</p>\n\n<p>So, why take them now? Wasn't better to leave them to the women, so that they could use them again and continue to multiply?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The point was that they did not need the mirrors anymore to convince the men to continue to raise families. While in mitzrayim, the men were so downtrodden, overworked, and in despair, that they would have just given up if the women had not taken the initiative. Consider that even Amram was ready to give up and divorced Yocheved. He would not have been willing to have Moshe, had Miriam not convinced him. Once they left mitzrayim and had received the Torah, the people were happy to serve Hashem and raise their families without the external stimulus of the mirrors. The women wanted to donate the mirrors to the Mishkan in thanks for what Hashem had done and to acknowledge what the mirrors had done for the people.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi points out on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9899#v=8&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayakhel 38:8</a> that the כיור was designed to make peace between a man and his wife. Thus, it was appropriate that the women donated in memory of having been used to create the families of those who survived the slavery in Egypt.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is [the meaning of] what is בְּמַרְאֹת הַצֹבְאֹת [lit., the\n  mirrors of those who set up legions]. From these [the mirrors], the\n  washstand was made, because its purpose was to make peace between a\n  man and his wife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is deeply significant that the vessel of the Sanctuary which was to\n  represent \"the moral <em>keeping holy</em> of ones acts and efforts\" קידוש\n  ידים ורגלים was made out of the women's mirrors. Mirrors are articles\n  which lay stress on the physical appearence of people being an object\n  of special consideration. So that it was shown that the physical\n  sensual side of human beings is not merely not excluded from the\n  sphere which is to be sanctified by the Mikdash, but that it is the\n  first and most essential object of this sanctification. After all, at\n  rock bottom, as Man has complete free will in moral matters, it is\n  just this side of human nature which is necessary to come under the\n  influence of the Mikdosh, if the sanctification of life which is aimed\n  at is to be achieved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note: Rav Hirsch points out that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the כיור was made up of the mirrors fitted together almost without any\n  alteration at all, so that it was recognizable that the basin\n  consisted actually of mirrors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Maybe the women had now <em>gold or silver</em> mirrors. They, indeed, received many treasures from the Egyptian, either by asking them or by the Sea butin.</p>\n\n<p>So, copper mirrors were now obsolete. But the women kept them as an emotional value (of their use in Egypt).</p>\n\n<p>And, when the women had an opportunity to bring these mirrors to an eternal life, they all happily gave them for the construction of the Mishkan.</p>\n\n<p>Personal answer, have no sources.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think we can answer this question by understanding <em>how</em> the mirrors helped them multiply. As the Rashi you cited states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כשהיו בעליהן יגיעין מעבודת פרך בשדה היו הולכות ומוליכות להם מאכל ומשתה ומאכילות אותם ונוטלות המראות וכל אחת ואחת רואה עצמה עם בעלה במראה ומשדלתו בדברים אני נאה ממך ומתוך כך מביאות אותם לידי תאוה ונזקקות להם ומתעברות ויולדות שם</p>\n<p>When their husbands were worn out from the difficult labor in the field they would go and bring them food and drink, and feed them. And they would take the mirrors, and each one of them would see herself with her husband in the mirror and would seduce him with words: \"I am more beautiful than you\". And with this they would bring them to a desirous [state]  and they would cohabit with them and whey would become pregnant and give birth there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems from this that the mirrors were necessary to stimulate the desire of the men because the men were too worn out from their hard labor to stimulate their own desire. But this was a particular set of circumstances unique to their slavery in Egypt. Once they were free the desire-block that the men had in Egypt would be gone; they would thus presumably desire their wives without the mirror-machinations. Therefore, the mirrors would no longer be necessary in the same way that they had been in Egypt, and it would be fine to donate them for use in the Tabernacle.</p>\n\n\n",

At the same time, it's noteworthy how in the Chiddushim he refers to his Rebbeim, the Ramban and Rabbenu Yonah, as living with נר\"ו, and in Torat HaBayit, he appends ז\"ל indicating they had since passed away. Therefore, the author of the introduction of the Mossad HaRav Kook edition of Torat HaBayit considers it crystal clear that Torat HaBayit is (ultimately) a later work. He also points out that the Rashba references Torat HaBayit a number of times in the Shu\"t, as well, but doesn't mention any references to the Shu\"t in Torat HaBayit, indicating the Teshuvot were written later in life. </p>\n\n<p>I personally wonder if we can figure this out with the dates of the Teshuvot, Ramban and R' Yonah's presumed years of death, etc. It's quite possible that he wrote Teshuvot when he was younger as well, after all.

    "content": "# Is there an opinion that plowing and harvesting on Shabbos are not punishable by Kareis and Skilah? If not, why?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shabbos 70a records a dispute between R' Nassan and R' Yosi on how to interpret the seemingly extra passuk (Shemos 35:3):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לֹא־תְבַעֲר֣וּ אֵ֔שׁ בְּכֹ֖ל מֹשְׁבֹֽתֵיכֶ֑ם בְּי֖וֹם הַשַּׁבָּֽת׃ </p>\n  \n  <p>Do not light a fire in all of your dwellings on the day of the Shabbos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to R' Nassan, it's to indicate that if one violates several categories of Melacha, he's liable for each one of them, just as we see by lighting a fire that one is liable for it alone.</p>\n\n<p>R' Yosi, on the other hand, learns the passuk differently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא הבערה ללאו יצאת דברי רבי יוסי</p>\n  \n  <p>It was taught in a Braisa: Lighting a fire was singled out as a prohibition -  the words of R' Yosi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does this mean? As Rashi explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאין חייבין עליה כרת וסקילה כשאר מלאכות אלא מה שאמור בה</p>\n  \n  <p>That one is not liable over it Kareis and stoning like the other Melachos, but rather what is said by it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, lighting a fire is singled out in order to indicate that it's unique in its punishment. But lighting a fire isn't the <em>only</em> one that's singled out. Consider Shemos 34:21:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בֶּחָרִ֥ישׁ וּבַקָּצִ֖יר תִּשְׁבֹּֽת</p>\n  \n  <p>In your plowing and in your harvesting you shall rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is expounded in Rosh HaShanah 9a to refer either not to <em>days</em> but to <em>years</em> and comes to prohibit plowing before Shemitah in preparation of Shemitah and harvesting Shemitah produce after Shemitah, or to indicate that just as one is not obligated to plow, so, too, the liability is only when he is not obligated to harvest, thus permitting cutting the grain for the Omer and Shtei HaLechem.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anyone who expounds the latter passuk regarding harvesting and plowing in the same vein as R' Yosi by lighting a fire? If not, why?</p>\n\n<p>(I don't ask according to R' Nassan's interpretation of the passuk of lighting a fire, as he indeed incorporates the passuk of harvesting and plowing into his interpretation of that of lighting a fire.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What criteria allow rabbis to use the \"Shomer Petayim\" principle?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a principle called <em>shomer petayim</em> (Meaning \"G-d protects the simple\". Based on Psalms 116:6.) which rabbis occasionally use to allow people to do something that would probably be considered dangerous. The rabbis make the activity permissible if it becomes evident that a significant populace is willing to take the risks.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Rav Moshe Feinstein ztz\"l used this principle to allow smoking despite the large evidence available explaining the dangers. See <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/83d5/460431254d90f0b9ae7ff24cafb70c71805c.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> for details.</p>\n\n<p>What criteria allows rabbis to use this principle to permit something? Can they freely use this for anything whatsoever that shows \"societal normalcy\" (i.e. society accepting the dangers?) For example, numerous people speed or weave on the highway. It's become the \"norm\" for people to exceed the speed limit by 10 - 20 MPH. There's sufficient evidence that increased speed causes increased as well as more severe crashes. But, since it has become societal norm, can rabbanim use this principle to allow people to do this? (I'm asking only about the halachic aspect of using this principle, here; not about prohibiting it b/c of <em>Dina Demalchuta</em> - i.e. one violates the law by exceeding the speed limit.)</p>\n\n<p>The above is an example. I'm sure there are numerous others where this rule is applied.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Thanks to @Alex's source (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14514&st=&pgnum=110\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"t Tzitz Eliezer 15:39</a>), this is what I also got from R' Schlesinger (an opponent of R' Moshe):</p>\n\n<p>The שומר פתאים principle can only be applied when the danger is not known but speculated and to one that is not aware of it. So the advice to stay פתי implies that neither the Rabbi nor the questioner is aware of the danger.</p>\n\n<p>Once the person IS aware of the danger he can not continue to pretend to be פתי and the principle would not apply. For instance, your example with speeding - no driver is unaware of the dangers of speeding - therefore this principle cannot apply.</p>\n\n<p>But if a person tries a new drug which might be dangerous, but the statistics are yet to be known, or regarding smoking in the 60s-70s, when a person might doubt, he can be considered פתי and the principle applied.</p>\n\n<p>You forgot to mention, that R\"M's Psak was issued in the early 70s and that fits my answer perfectly!</p>\n\n<p>If however only the Rabbi is aware of the real danger but hides it from the questioner, it seems to be לפני עוור and לא תעמוד על דם רעך.</p>\n\n\n",

The explanation itself is in hebrew and very lengthy in so l will do my best to summarize his answer:</p>\n<p>He explains that the Torah that is received directly from Hashem is not something that Moshe could have passed on. \"For every matter there is an interpretation that requires 80 years,\" as is known from the teachings of the Arizal (haven’t been able to locate the source). In the Sefer עמק המלך it brings a story about Rabbi Avraham Halevi, who found the Arizal speaking in his sleep. When asked if the Rabbi would reveal what he had learned, the rabbi began to laugh and said, \"I bear witness to heaven and earth, if I had taught for eighty consecutive years, I would not have been able to complete what I learned this time in the portion of Bilaam and the donkey.\" This Torah, which came from Hashem, is called the Torah of Atzilut (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atziluth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for explanation), which means a very high level of Torah learning (since Atzilut is the highest spiritual world) and to interpret that Torah and explain it, requires eighty years to convey what was received in one moment during sleep.</p>\n<p>To make this make more sense, a comparison can be made to the contemporary reality where vast amounts of information can be transmitted with the push of a button. Similarly, although there is a vast distance between this and the Torah of Atzilut, the Torah is given from the mouth of Hashem in such a way that one who receives it needs 80 consecutive years to transmit even one part of what was received in a moment of sleep. The Arizal explains that any righteous person who reaches the state of אין (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin_and_Yesh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for explanation), meaning a very high level in spirituality, can merit receiving the Torah of Atzilut. The Baal Shem Tov also said that he knew righteous people who attained the state of אין and received Torah from the mouth of Hashem, yet they did not believe in themselves until their death. Consequently, this Torah of Atzilut that came from the mouth of Hashem is not something Moshe could have received from Hashem and passed on to Yehoshua. So until now it's just משה קיבל תורה מהקב״ה, period.</p>\n<p>However, after what happened on the 17th of Tammuz with the sin of the golden calf and the breaking of the tablets, the manner of receiving the Torah was different with the second tablets. The Torah was given in a way that Hashem descended upon Har Sinai, which is considered the Torah of Briah (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beri%27ah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), meaning a level of Torah learning which is a step down. This is the Torah that was given to us, which Moshe received from Sinai and passed on to Yehoshua. Indeed, Moshe, who reached the level of אין, received the Torah from the mouth of Hashem. However, what he passed on to Joshua was only the Torah of בריאה– the Torah from Sinai. Moshe did not pass on to Yehoshua everything he received, since for example מה שתלמיד ותיק עתיד להורות/לומר/לחדש לפני רבו (see <a href=\"https://www.mayim.org.il/?parasha=%D7%9E%D7%94-%D7%A9%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%93-%D7%A2%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%93-%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9#gsc.tab=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) was given to Moshe but not Yehoshua and onwards. But rather he passed on the Torah of בריאה.</p>\n<p>Therefore in summary, the reason it says משה קיבל תורה מסיני is because it refers to the form of receiving the Torah on the second tablets, which were given in the manner of Sinai, which is the aspect of Torah that comes from בריאה which was passed down from Moshe to Yehoshua and not אצילות which is the highest form which was only able to be passed down from Hashem to Moshe and includes a lot of Torah that we don't know.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Elsewhere the Talmud discusses in more detail this same process of disseminating the Oral law. In this version, Moshe receives the law directly from God. It seems nothing would be lost, because the same teaching is found with God at the front of the line.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.54b.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 54b</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תנו רבנן כיצד סדר משנה משה למד מפי הגבורה נכנס אהרן ושנה לו משה פירקו נסתלק אהרן וישב לשמאל משה נכנסו בניו ושנה להן משה פירקן נסתלקו בניו אלעזר ישב לימין משה ואיתמר לשמאל אהרן רבי יהודה אומר לעולם אהרן לימין משה חוזר נכנסו זקנים ושנה להן משה פירקן נסתלקו זקנים נכנסו כל העם ושנה להן משה פירקן נמצאו ביד אהרן ארבעה ביד בניו שלשה וביד הזקנים שנים וביד כל העם אחד</p>\n<p>The Gemara continues to discuss methods of Torah study. The Sages taught the following baraita: What was the order of teaching the Oral Law? How was the Oral Law first taught? Moses learned directly from the mouth of the Almighty. Aaron entered and sat before him, and Moses taught him his lesson as he had learned it from God. Aaron moved aside and sat to the left of Moses. Aaron’s sons entered, and Moses taught them their lesson while Aaron listened. Aaron’s sons moved aside; Elazar sat to the right of Moses and Itamar sat to the left of Aaron. Rabbi Yehuda disagreed with the first tanna with regard to the seating arrangements and said: Actually, Aaron would return to sit to the right of Moses. The elders entered and Moses taught them their lesson. The elders moved aside, and the entire nation entered and Moses taught them their lesson. Therefore, Aaron had heard the lesson four times, his sons heard it three times, the elders heard it twice, and the entire nation heard it once.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The wording מסיני is taken from the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.33.2?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 33:2</a> (only such a case in the Tanach!):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּאמַ֗ר יְהֹוָ֞ה <strong>מִסִּינַ֥י</strong> בָּא֙ וְזָרַ֤ח מִשֵּׂעִיר֙ לָ֔מוֹ הוֹפִ֙יעַ֙ מֵהַ֣ר פָּארָ֔ן וְאָתָ֖ה מֵרִבְבֹ֣ת קֹ֑דֶשׁ מִימִינ֕וֹ (אשדת) [אֵ֥שׁ דָּ֖ת] לָֽמוֹ׃</p>\n<p>He said: Hashem came <strong>from Sinai</strong>, And shone upon them from Seir; [God] appeared from Mount Paran, And approached from Ribeboth-kodesh,\nLightning flashing at them from [God’s] right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.33.2?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi quotes Sifrei</a> on this verse as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויאמר ה' מסיני בא AND HE SAID, THE LORD CAME FROM SINAI — First he began with praise of the Omnipresent, and only afterwards did he begin with what concerned Israel; but in the praise of God with which he began there is <em>also mention of Israel’s merit</em>. All this was by way of intercession, as though to say, “These are worthy that blessing should rest upon them” (Sifrei Devarim 343:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. G-d is mentioned in the tractate by way of a רמז (hint). As we also understand, the tractate Pirkei Avos deals with developing qualities of fear of G-d and going beyond the letter of the law, especially in reference to the generations of the past. Thus it is no wonder, that it started specifically with a <em>hint</em> to the verse which also mentions the merits of Jewish people in connection with receiving the Torah from G-d.</p>\n<p><strong>It might be said</strong> then, that by stating <em>Moshe received the Torah from G-d</em> explicitly, we will not have such a connection to a specific verse. Additionally, such a statement at the beginning of maseches Avos, dealing with personal growth would diminish its message. If Moshe received his greatness as a divine gift, that would not teach us anything beyond what we know that some people naturally (from G-d) are more gifted or able than others.</p>\n<p><strong>It seems that</strong> the Mishna Avos 1:1 is teaching a significanly stronger point: משֶׁה קִבֵּל תּוֹרָה מִסִּינַי - Moshe received the Torah from Sinai, meaning from the <strong>entire experience at Sinai</strong>, when Moshe led a nation to the covenant, described in parshiyot Yisro - Pikudei, also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.88a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 88a</a> and many midrashim.

In Daniel 9:25, after a commandment is\ngiven to initiate the restoration of Jerusalem and its temple, and\nafter the conclusion of the prophesied 62 weeks, that temple, which\nCyrus commanded to rebuild, is to be destroyed. The link between the\n62-year-old Darius the Mede and the 62-year-old Cyrus the Great\nreinforces this prophecy concerning the 62 weeks which is to pass\nbefore the new Temple will be destroyed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I'm not a history professor, I don't think the time line fits.</p>\n<p>I'll just drop this random fragment from <a href=\"https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/anointed-one-that-shall-be-cut-off\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gerald Sigal</a>. I can't find the whole article, so props to anyone who can locate the rest of Part Six:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The second anointed one</strong></p>\n<p>Verse 26. And after the sixty-two weeks an anointed one shall be cut\noff, and he shall have nothing; the people of a leader who is to come\nshall destroy the city and the Sanctuary; and its end shall be with a\nflood; and until the end of war desolations are determined.</p>\n<p>Verse 26 is concerned with events that are to take place after “the\nsixty-two weeks.”  It is only after the sixty-two weeks that an\nanointed one is cut off and no mention is made of how long after this\nwill occur.  That is all that can be derived from the text.  As\npreviously mentioned, the presence of a definite article before the\nmention of sixty-two weeks shows that there is a separation between\nthe seven weeks and the sixty-two weeks.  This emphasis necessitates a\ngrammatical division represented by a semi-colon in the rendering of\nverse 25 to show that there is a division between the seven weeks and\nthe sixty-two weeks.  The resultant span of years makes it impossible\nfor the two mentions of “anointed one” to refer to the same\nindividual.</p>\n<p>In this time segment two events are mentioned.  First, after a\nsixty-two week period (434 years) of “troubled times” in which\nJerusalem “shall be built again, with broad place and moat” “an\nanointed one shall be cut off.”  Obviously, this anointed one is not\nto be identified with the anointed one of verse 25.  The time\ndifferential is just too great.  Second, this verse mentions the fate\nof “the city and the Sanctuary” (that is, Jerusalem and the Temple),\nwhich are to be destroyed by “the people of the leader who is to come”\nas if by a devastating flood (cf. Nahum 1:8).  Although “desolations\nare determined” while the war is still in progress it is seen from\nverse 27 that this verdict was put into full effect at the war’s end.\nThat is, its fulfillment did not end with the war but continued into\nthe future with further negative decrees and persecutions seeking to\ndestroy the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>The first seven weeks of the seventy week period ends in 537 B.C.E.\nwith Cyrus the anointed one who issues the decree allowing the Jews to\nreturn from exile.  The second segment of sixty-two weeks in length,\ncovered by verse 26, culminates in 103 B.C.E. (586-49-434=103 B.C.E.).\nVerse 26 indicates that “after sixty-two weeks an anointed one shall\nbe cut off.”  This “anointed one” is the High Priest Alexander Yannai\n(reign:  103-76 B.C.E.) who came to power just at the end of the\nsixty-two week period in 103 B.C.E.  and was the last of the important\nHasmonean leaders.<sup>6</sup>  There is nothing unusual in referring\nto a high priest as an anointed one, since he was anointed on assuming\nthat position.  Alexander Yannai also held the position of king, a\nposition formalized by anointing.</p>\n<p>The phrase “after sixty-two weeks” indicates the time frame during\nwhich the “anointed one shall be cut off,” that is, suffer karet,\n“excision.”  Alexander Yannai is not “cut off” immediately after\nsixty-two weeks, but through the actions of his reign he was to have\nthis final judgment following his death.  From this we see a further\nindication that there are intervals between the specific identifiable\ntime periods.  The penalty accompanying karet is here aptly described\nas “to have nothing,” or “be no more.”  That is, he will have no\nreward after death.</p>\n<p>This punishment is given to Alexander Yannai infamous for his unjust,\ntyrannical, and bloody rule.<sup>7</sup>  He is notorious for his\nviolent animosity directed against the Pharisees and his brazen\nrejection of the Oral Law.<sup>8</sup>  For example, Josephus records\nthat Alexander Yannai fought against the Pharisees for six years, “and\n… slew no fewer than fifty thousand of them.”<sup>9 </sup> He also\n“ordered some eight hundred of the Jews to be crucified, and\nslaughtered their children and wives before the eyes of the still\nliving wretches.”<sup>10</sup></p>\n<p>Verse 26 shows when Alexander Yannai, the “anointed one,” would assume\npower and what kind of punishment would be meted out to him for his\ntransgressions against God. Alexander Yannai’s sons and grandsons\ncontinued his unmitigated lust for power and thereby finalized the\ndemise of the Hasmonean dynasty.  The fate of these three generations\nmay be expressed by the psalmist’s words:  “But transgressors shall be\ndestroyed together; the future of the wicked shall be cut off” (Psalms\n37:38).<sup>11</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Futhermore, the <a href=\"https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/daniel-9-a-true-biblical-interpretation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">website</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Daniel was confused because although he now witnessed that, with the\nadvent of Darius the 70 years to the Babylonian subjugation were over\nin fulfillment of Jeremiah 25:11-12, Daniel had not yet seen the\nfulfillment of Jeremiah 29:10 that promised that after the 70 years\nthe Jewish exiles would return and rebuild Jerusalem. He did not\nforesee that very shortly Cyrus world rule and fulfill this promise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only allusion I can find tying these numbers together is a cryptic reference in the Talmud. The <em>Gemara</em> (<em>Megillah</em> 10b) says that the phrase “<em>Vayehi bimei</em>” always indicates trouble. The <em>gematria</em> of <em>vayehi</em> is thirty-one, which doesn't always indicate trouble, but if <em>bimei</em> is added (which has the <em>gematria</em> of sixty-two) then there's surely trouble.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Daniel.6.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> explains the trouble that arose 62 years before when Darius was born:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To tell you that on the day that Nebuchadnezzar entered the Heichal in\nthe days of Jehoiachin, his adversary, Darius, was born (Seder Olam\nch. 28). From the exile of Jeconiah until now were sixty-two years,\nand the master said: They were exiled in the days of Jehoiachin in the\nseventh year counting from the conquest of Jehoiakim, which is eight\nyears after the beginning of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. There remained to\nNebuchadnezzar’s reign thirty-seven years, for he reigned forty-five\nyears, and twenty-three of Evil-merodach’s, as our Sages stated in\nTractate Megillah (11b), and the two years of Belshazzar that passed,\ntotaling sixty-two.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>6</sup> The Hasmonean dynasty ended in 37 B.C.E. with the execution of the last Hasmonean king, Mattathias Antigonus, by the Romans.  Antigonus’ sister held Hyrcania, a fortress in the Judean desert, for another five or six years (Josephus, Jewish Wars I. 19. 1 [364].)</p>\n<p><sup>7</sup> Alexander Yannai came to power after the culmination of the sixty-two weeks and is obviously the second anointed one.   Calculating according to Seder Olam Rabbah an alternate anointed one is suggested.  According to Seder Olam Rabbah, the First Temple was destroyed seventy years before the Second Temple was built, and the Second Temple, which was destroyed in 70 C.E., stood for 420 years.  Accordingly, the First Temple was destroyed in 421 B.C.E. (not 420 — there is no zero year between 1 B.C.E. and 1 C.E.).  This means that the first seven weeks ended in 372 B.C.E. (during the reign of Cyrus).  The second segment of the Seventy Weeks period, sixty-two weeks in length, covered by verse 26, culminates in 62 C.E. (421-49-424=62 C.E.).  The seventieth week would end in 69 C.E., followed by the Temple destruction.  There are a number of questions concerning the accuracy of the Seder Olam Rabbah calculations.</p>\n<p>According to this reckoning, the first “anointed one” mentioned is Cyrus.  The second “anointed one” who verse 26 says will be “cut off” “after 62 weeks,” that is, suffer karet, “excision,” is the High Priest Ananias (Chanin).  He was appointed high priest by Herod of Chalcis in 47 C.E., deposed by Agrippa II in 59 C.E., and killed by the Sicarii at the outset of the rebellion against Rome.  He continued to wield considerable power after being replaced as high priest, “using his wealth to attract those who were willing to receive bribes” (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities XX.\n9. 4 [213]).  Of the post-62 B.C.E. period Josephus writes:  “Now the high priest Ananias daily advanced greatly in reputation and was splendidly rewarded by the goodwill and esteem of the citizens; for he was able to supply them with money:  at any rate he daily paid court with gifts to Albinus and the high priest.  But Ananias had servants who were utter rascals and who, combining operations with the most reckless of men, would go to the threshing floors and take by force the tithes of the priests; nor did they refrain from beating those who refused to give.  The high priests were guilty of the same practices as his slaves, and no one could stop them.  So it happened at that time that those of the priests who in olden days were maintained by the tithes now starved to death” (Jewish Antiquities XX. 9. 2 [205-207]; see also T.B. Pesachim 57a:  “Woe to me because of the house of Boethus … For they are High Priests and their sons are [Temple] treasurers and their sons-in-law are trustees and their servants beat the people with staves.”).  “An anointed one shall be cut off” may in a sense refer to the anointed priesthood officiating in the Temple generally.  In any case, Ananias exemplified those in the priesthood who through injustice grew wealthy in this world, disgraced the Temple and the priestly office, and caused needless hardship and death.  As a result of his actions in this world there was nothing for him in the next world.</p>\n<p>According to the calculation based on Seder Olam Rabbah, the second part of verse 26 describes the most crucial event occurring following the sixty-two weeks (that ended in 62 C.E.), the destruction of the city of Jerusalem and the Second Temple, “and the people [the Romans] of the leader [Pompey] who is to come, shall destroy” that is, the year 63 B.C.E. and subsequently.</p>\n<p><sup>8</sup> “To him [the priest] who performed the libation they used to say, ‘Raise your hand!’ for on one occasion he poured it over his feet and all the people pelted him with their etrogim” (Mishnah Sukkah 4:9).  Josephus (Jewish Antiquities XIII. 13. 5. [372]) identifies the offending priest as Alexander Yannai.</p>\n<p><sup>11</sup> The early Hasmoneans called themselves mere custodians of the throne until the coming of the Messiah and the restoration of the Davidic monarchy.  Once power was consolidated in their hands, they ruled without restraint.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do any poskim exempt 13-20-year-olds from Mussaf?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422617236.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Artscroll’s edition of Sefer HaChinuch</a> (vol. 2, p. 303), they quote a discussion regarding whether women are exempt from davening Mussaf:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If women are obligated as men are in all the communal offerings, there is a reason to obligate women in the Mussaf prayer, since it is representative of the Mussaf offering in which women are obligated. Thus, the question of whether women must recite the Mussaf prayer today is contingent upon the question of whether they are included in the obligation of all the communal offerings, and that they are therefore exempt from reciting the Mussaf prayer (see Teshuvos R’ Akiva Eiger §9, and R’ Akiva Eiger on Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 106:2). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Artscroll spends the rest of the piece addressing how this opinion interprets Ben Buchri’s opinion that Kohanim and Leviim are exempt from the Shekalim in light of the fact that Sukkah 53a indicates that they davened an obligatory Mussaf.)</p>\n\n<p>I see also that Mishnah Berurah 106:4 cites the Tzlach (Artscroll ad. loc. references Tzlach to Berachos 26a without actually quoting him) as saying similarly that women are exempt, without quoting a reason; I don’t have access to this Sefer to see his reasoning inside. </p>\n\n<p>According to these opinions, that women are exempt from Mussaf due to their being exempt from the Shekalim, would the same hold true for the other groups of people exempt from Shekalim, i.e. children under 20<sup>1</sup> and slaves? (I ask more about the children, as in general slaves are liable and exempt in the same Mitzvos as a woman.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>I base this statement on the Bartenura to Shekalim 1:3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וקטנים. אפילו הביא שתי שערות והוא פחות מבן עשרים:</p>\n  \n  <p>”And minors” - even if he has produced two hairs and is younger than 20. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And Yachin ad. loc.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וקטנים כל שהוא פחות מבן עשרים קרוי קטן, ואפילו הביא ב' שערות. </p>\n  \n  <p>”And minors” - anyone younger than 20 is called a minor, even if he produced two hairs. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, I see that the Rambam ad. loc. understands this exemption differently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וקטן שלא הביא שתי שערות אין ממשכנין אותו אלא שמניחין אותו ואם נתן מקבלין מידו אמרו אין ממשכנין עד שיביא שתי שערות</p>\n  \n  <p>And a minor who has not produced two hairs, we do not take collateral from him, but rather we leave him. If he gave, we will accept from his hand. They said: we do not take collateral until he produces two hairs. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously my question can only apply if children ages 13-20 are exempt from Shekalim, as children under 13 are exempt from Mitzvos anyway. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>R. Baruch HaLevi Epstein in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14019&st=&pgnum=432\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Torah Temimah to Shemot 30 footnote 22</a> writes that according to the opinion which you cited that would exempt women from <em>tefilat musaf</em> (which he attributes to Besamim Rosh and subsequently R. Akiva Eger) and according to the many opinions that a young man from thirteen to twenty years of age was exempt from the obligation to donate a half-shekel (Bartenura, Chinuch, Rokeach, Gra), then it would indeed appear that a boy under twenty would be exempt from <em>tefillat musaf</em>, to the extent that he would not be able to pray <em>musaf</em> as a <em>shatz</em> in order to allow the congregation to fulfill their obligation.</p>\n\n<p>However, he concludes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והוא דבר חדש ונפלא מאד וצ\"ע רב</p>\n  \n  <p>This is something new and very astounding, and requires much thought.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This may very well depend on the reason for women's exemption from <em>mussaf</em>. R. Akiva Eiger (both in the <em>teshuvah</em> and in the commentary to Shulchan Aruch) cites the Besamim Rosh as linking their exemption to their lack of involvement in the <em>korbanos</em>. However, in the commentary to Shulchan Aruch he also cites the Tzlach's explanation. This is what the Tzlach says (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37718&st=&pgnum=49\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 26a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומדברי התוס' למדתי כונה אחרת רמוזה בלשונם שכתבו משום שהיא תדירה בכל ולכאורה מלת בכל אין לה הבנה שהיה להם לומר שהיא תדירה בכל יום או בכל זמן ולכן אני אומר שכיונו במה שאני מסתפק אם תפלת המוספין נוהגת בנשים שהרי היא מצוה שהזמן גרמא ואף שהתפלה אין מן התורה רק מדרבנן הרי לדעת התוס' לעיל דף כ' ע\"ב גם במצות דרבנן שהזמן גרמא נשים פטורות אלא שבתפלה חייבינהו רבנן כיון דרחמי נינהו כמבואר לעיל והיינו בשלש תפלות הקבועות בכל יום ואפי' בשבת וי\"ט שהם רק שבח מ\"מ כיון דבחול רחמי נינהו לכן לא חילקו בין שבת ויו\"ט לחול וכמ\"ש רבינו יונה כאן לענין תשלומין בתפלה שאחריה אבל תפלת מוסף שאיננה רחמי כמבואר ברבינו יונה כאן דלכך אין לה תשלומין והיא מצות עשה דרבנן שהזמן גרמא ודאי דנשים פטורות לדעת התוס' וא\"כ זהו כוונת התוס' שהקדים תפלת המנחה למוסף משום שהיא תדירה בכל ותרתי קארי למעליותא דמנחה חדא שהיא תדירה ועוד שהיא נוהגת בכל באנשים ונשים משא\"כ מוסף שאינה תדיר ואינה נוהגת בנשים</p>\n<p>And from the words of Tosafos I derived another intent hidden in their language, for they wrote \"that it is frequent in everything\". And seemingly the word[s] \"in everything\" have no understanding – they should have said  that it is frequent every day, or every time. And therefore I say that they intended that which I was unsure about, if the <em>mussaf</em> prayer is practiced by women since it's a time-bound positive commandment. And even though prayer is not [a] biblical [commandment] but only rabbinic, according to the opinion of Tosafos above on 20b women are even exempt from rabbinic commandments that are time-bound, except that the Sages obligated them in prayer since it is [requesting] mercy as explained above. But that is only with [regard to] the the three daily set prayers, and even on <em>Shabbos</em> and holidays when [the prayers] are only praise but since on weekdays they are [requests for] mercy [the Sages] did not make a distinction between <em>Shabbos</em>/holidays and weekdays, as Rabbeinu Yonah writes here with regard to making up [a prayer] with the next prayer. But [with regard to] the <em>mussaf</em> prayer which is <em>not</em> [a request for] mercy – as is clear from Rabbeinu Yonah here since that is why there is no makeup – and it <em>is</em> a rabbinic time-bound positive commandment, women are certainly exempt according to the opinion of Tosafos. And if so, this is the intent of Tosafos: that [the Mishnah] mentions <em>minchah</em> before <em>mussaf</em> because it is frequent in everything, and minchah has two advantages 1) it is frequent 2) it is practiced by everyone – men and women. Whereas <em>mussaf</em> is not frequent and it is not practiced by women.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this women's exemption has nothing to do with <em>korbanos</em> so it would be hard to extrapolate to other people who are similarly not involved in <em>korbanos</em>. (and of course <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/5812/sefer-besamim-rosh\">the Besamim Rosh is of dubious value</a>.)</p>\n\n\n",

Jewish law says that, in minor cases, if you \ndetermine that the people are going to do a certain wrong thing no matter what you say, it is better not to tell them that they are breaking a commandment, because by teaching them that, they would then break the commandment deliberately. The Talmud says:\nIt is better to transgress unintentionally than intentionally.

Ḥiyya was the redactor of the Sifra. There are no less than 39 passages in Yerushalmi and the midrashim in which expositions found also in the Sifra are quoted in the name of R.

This interpretation is seems to be somewhat problematic however, since the text would not have mentioned that G-d did not harm (literally, raise His hand against) them.

(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Taanith.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosafot back in Megillah picks up on the fact that though the Mishnah forbids business, building, and planting, the Beraita only defines the parameters for building and planting. The Beraita does not tell us anything about the parameters of the ban on business.</p>\n<p>To this, Tosafot begins by asserting that the ban on business mirrors the ban on building and planting, meaning that only \"joyous\" business is forbidden just as only joyous building and joyous planting is forbidden. Tosafot then seeks to prove this assertion. The proof is that if in fact <em>all</em> business was forbidden (and not just joyous business) then building itself would be forbidden, because building is the paradigmatic example of business (אין משא ומתן גדולה מזה). But since the Beraita explicitly stated that only joyous building is forbidden, all other building is perforce permitted. Since all other building is <em>necessarily</em> business it is thus demonstrable that regular business is permitted (as long as it is not joyous).</p>\n<p>Tosafot is not giving us advice about what line of business to go into; Tosafot is simply trying to prove that regular business is permitted even when the Mishnah states simply that business is forbidden.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Tosfos on Megillah 5b <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.5b.12?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Megillah.5b.12.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ד\"ה ממעטין במשא ומתן</a> seems to be saying we forbid only building which is of <em>simcha</em>.<br />\nAs translated by <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/megilah/tosfos/mg-ts-005.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dafyomi.co.il</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פי' של שמחה דומיא דבנין ונטיעה דבסמוך</p>\n<p>[We diminished business] of Simchah, just like the building and planting below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosfos then continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל שאר בנינים שרו ואין לך משא ומתן גדול מזה</p>\n<p>Other building is permitted, as there is no business greater than this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't think this Tosfos phrasing of <strong>\"there is no business greater than this\"</strong> should be read in a \"Wow!

Rava therefore asks that we drink on Purim until we can’t tell the difference between “blessed is Mordechai” and “cursed is Haman,” due to the fact that Mordechai also played a large role in the potential destruction of the Jewish people; after all, Rava says that “wine and good scents made me wise.” </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/59911?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the sequel</a>, the author argues that the following story, where Rava killed R’ Zeira, did not actually happen, but rather was a Purim shpiel by those who disagreed with Rava’s assessment of events (notably Abaye), arguing that following Rava’s advice would lead to someone getting killed. </p>\n\n<p>While there are other ways to explain these Gemaras that doesn’t lead to anyone arguing that Mordechai was wrong in his actions (not for this thread), I wonder: is the author of these source sheets the first to come up with this theory, or did any Rishonim or Achronim posit it before him?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is definitely not a strange read of the pshat of the Megillah...  </p>\n\n<p>In terms of the reading of Rava in this way, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_David_Sinzheim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shlal David</a> (Esther 4:5) understands it to be so (Hebrew follows, emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש לדקדק, <strong>מה ראה רבא על ככה דכנסת ישראל היו מתרעמים על דוד ועל מרדכי, ולא דרש לזכות כמו אידך אמוראי. ונראה דרבא לשיטתו אזיל</strong>, דהתוספות בשבת דף ע\"ב [ע\"ב ד\"ה רבא] כתבו, וא\"ת <strong>ולרבא דאמר העובד מאהבה ויראה פטור אמאי לא השתחוה מרדכי להמן</strong>. וי\"ל משום קידוש השם, כדאשכחן בירושלמי [שביעית י, א] בפפוס ולולינוס אחיו שנתנו להם מים בזכוכית צבועה ולא קיבלו מהם. והנה ודאי פפוס ולולינוס קידשו השם בסכנת עצמם דוקא ולא לכל ישראל וודאי שפיר עבדו, <strong>אבל מרדכי שהכניס כל ישראל בסכנה לא הותר לו לקדש השם ולסכן כל ישראל, וזה היה תרעומת ישראל על מרדכי.</strong>‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A6%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%96%D7%90%D7%91_%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Betzalel Safran</a> also clearly notes this in a Teshuvah (Yalkut Hachinuchi 15):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבא מיחייב איניש לבסומי בפוריא עד דלא ידע בין ארור המן לברוך מרדכי [מגילה ז' ע\"ב].  ‏\n    רבא אזיל בזה לשיטתו שאמר (מגילה י\"ב ע\"ב, י\"ג ע\"א): כנסת ישראל היא דקאמרה לאידך גיסא, ראו מה עשה לי יהודה, דלא קטליה דוד לשמעי בן גרא דאתיליד מיניה מרדכי דמקני ביה המן, וגרם ליה צערא לישראל. ומה שילם לי ימיני, דלא קטליה שאול לאגג דאתיליד מיניה המן דמצער לישראל, יעו\"ש ברש\"י ד\"ה לאידך גיסא, שכתב \"לצעקה. ולא לשבח, איש יהודי, ואיש ימיני, גרמו לי הצער הזה\". וזה שהשכיל רבא את פיהו ומשתעי בלשון חכמה: \"מחייב אינש לבסומי בפוריא עד דלא ידע בין ארור המן... לברוך מרדכי\"... כי אזיל בזה לשיטתו! ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As an aside, this was famously the controversial opinion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Samuel_Reggio\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yashar, Rabbi Isaac Samuel Reggio</a> (although I don't think he cites Rava).</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Samuel_Reggio#His_philosophy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> summarizes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Mafteaḥ el Megillat Ester is an introduction to the Book of Esther, and deserves special notice in consideration of its originality. Having concluded that the Persian king in that book was Darius Hystaspes, Reggio shows that the main object of the writer was to prove that Darius was the first to establish the post. Analyzing the text carefully, Reggio maintains that Mordecai was by no means such a great man as the Rabbis declare him to have been, but that, on the contrary, he was an ordinary Jew; for he not only gave no religious education to his adopted daughter Esther, but he even commanded her to deny her race and religion. <strong>His refusal to bow before Haman was unnecessary, as such an act would not have violated any Jewish religious law.</strong> Even when he was informed of the imminence of the danger to his co-religionists consequent upon his senseless refusal, he did not resort to prayer and fasting; it was Esther who did that. His inhumanity is evidenced by his command to slaughter women and children (Esth. viii. 11). Afterward, when Mordecai attained great power, he did nothing to better the lot of his brethren in Jerusalem (comp. Neh. ix. 36-37). This view of Reggio's provoked a protest from Isaac Bär Lewinsohn (Bikkure Ribal, p. 115, Warsaw, 1889), and was violently criticized by Mendelson (Orient, Lit. viii. 314 et seq.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The full Hebrew of his commentary (where he says this) is available <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/R._Y.S._Reggio/Esther/3.2#m7e2n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What does אחָד in שמע ישראל actually mean?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Shema the word used for the oneness of God is אחָד (<a href=\"http://www.scripture4all.org/OnlineInterlinear/OTpdf/deu6.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ref</a>.). This is startling for a Muslim, as they find in the Quran almost a transliteration of the same word, i.e. the Arabic احد (pronounced: Ahad). </p>\n\n<p>What is surprising, however, is that in almost all the translations that I could find on the Internet, אחָד has been translated as \"One,\" The Arabic counterpart, even though, can be used in the sense of \"one,\" but a truer meaning is conveyed by \"alone,\" or even \"unique.\" Theologically, this has huge significance, because a God who is \"Alone,\" is a denial of any other God.</p>\n\n<p>My question then is: Does the hebrew אחָד bear the same connotations of alone and unique? If yes, then has Judaism always understood God of Israel to be the God of the whole universe? If there is only one God, there cannot be any place for henotheism.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>\"One\" can mean two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>One and not two or more</p></li>\n<li><p>Oneness of G-d, the ultimate unity and uniformity, where everything is included within Him, everything IS Him.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>However, the first paragraph of Shema, including this sentence, is a declaration of accepting G-d as King. From Quoting Berakhos 13a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי יהושע בן קרחה למה קדמה פרשת שמע לוהיה אם שמוע כדי שיקבל עליו עול מלכות שמים תחלה ואחר כך מקבל עליו עול מצות...</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Qorchah (\"the bald one\", ie the son of Rabbi Aqiva) said: Why does the paragraph of Shema come before that of VeHayah Im Shamoa? So that one accepts upon oneself <em>ol Malkhus Shamayim</em> -- the yoke of the Kingship of [the One in heaven] and after words accept upon oneself <em>ol mitzvos</em> -- the yoke of mitzvos....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the first paragraph is accepting G-d as my King. Not as a theory, but as a yoke I am harnessing myself to. To elaborate the \"yoke\" metaphor -- accepting G-d's rule as part of my means of being productive. (Followed by accepting his Mitzvos in the next paragraph of Shema.)</p>\n<p>This is why we use the same verse as one of the 10 prooftexts in the berakhah of Malkhios in the Mussaf for Rosh haShanah, as it declares Hashem as our King.</p>\n<p>Although on Rosh haShanah 32b, Rabbi Yehudah objects to the proposal, we rule otherwise. In an interesting essay, Rav Hutner (Pachad Yitzchaq, Rosh haShanah #11) says that Rabbi Yehudah is bothered about the difference in modality: Shema is accepting G-d as my King, in practice. Which may not fit Malkhios, which is a declaration of G-d as King in fact, whether I choose to be a loyal subject or not.</p>\n<p>So this is what we mean when we say Hashem E-lokeinu -- Hashem is our G-d.</p>\n<p>And when we say Hashem is One, it is in this context alone. I am ruling out dual loyalty -- He alone is my King.</p>\n<p>This is why we're taught that when saying <em>echad</em>, there is a thought we're supposed to have for each letter relevant to Kingship. Shulchan Arukh Orakh Chaim 61:6:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>צריך להאריך בחי\"ת של אחד כדי שימליך הקב\"ה בשמים ובארץ שלזה רומז החטוטרות שבאמצע הגג החי\"ת ויאריך בדל\"ת של אחד שיעור שיחשוב שהקב\"ה יחיד בעולמו ומושל בד' רוחות העולם ולא יאריך יותר מכשיעור זה ויש נוהגים להטות הראש כפי המחשבה מעלה ומטה ולד' רוחות:</p>\n<p>It is necessary to extend [the pronunciation of] the [letter] <em>ches</em> of [the word] <em>echad</em> (one) in order to make the Holy One, blessed be He, King in the Heavens and the Earth, in that this is hinted at in the humps in the middle of the roof of the chet. And one should extend the letter <em>dalet</em> of <em>echad</em> long enough to think that the Holy One, blessed be He, is unique in His world and rules in the four directions of the world, but he should not extend more than this amount. There are those who have the custom to turn the head in accordance with the thought: up, down, and to the four directions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Others associate the <em>ches</em> using <em>gematria</em>: Hashem is King over 7 heavens + 1 earth = 8, the numerical value of <em>ches</em>. As for extending the <em>dalet</em>, in his accent, the undotted version of <em>dalet</em> makes the /dh/ sound at the beginning of the word \"this\". As the Rambam describes it, \"the sound a bee makes\". There are Ashkenazim who try to make do with the Ashkenazi traditional sound, but err by ending up saying the non-word \"Ech-ch-ch-a-a-a-a-deh\". Can't extend by adding a vowel at the end.)</p>\n<p>The Chafeitz Chaim went further, and warned about this thought of the Shulchan Arukh, \"Don't be so busy accepting G-d as King of heavens and earth, across all four compass points of the world, that one forgets to accept Him as King over oneself!\"</p>\n<p>As a matter of theory, the unity of G-d means two things -- (1) that Hashem is Unique; and (2) that Hashem is indivisible. Remembering these two facts are two of the Six Constantly Applicable Mitzvos. So it's not terrible to have those in mind either. But as you see above, it's not the primary thrust of how our sages explain the word <em>echad</em> in the mitzvah of reciting this verse.</p>\n\n\n",

And now, how is it possible that the story in the Passover Haggadah of R. Eliezer and R. Akiva who were reclining in Benei Berak that entire night, i.e. the night of Passover? Behold R.

And there at the end of the discussion [the Talmud] tells that R. Eliezer spent Shabbat in the succah of R. Yochanan Ben Ilai in Ceasaria, [and the Talmud asks] how he could leave his dwelling on the holiday. And the Talmud was forced to say that it was Shabbat [and not a holiday].

Gamliel and the elders were on a boat and R. Gamliel designated the various tithes. This occurred on the day before Passover which is the time of removal for tithes. Therefore, it is possible that they docked in the port of Jaffa on the day before Passover, and Jaffa is opposite Benei Berak as is clear from <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0619.htm#45\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Joshua 19:45-46</a>.

Even though the officiant is making the blessing on the wine on behalf of the couple who will drink from it, he does not need to ask their permission to do so (either because of his position as the local rabbi, or because the couple have asked him to officiate). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Adding to Joel's answer, Sheva Brachot (the ones at the end of the meal; not the ones said at the chuppa.) also don't get <em>savri</em>.</p>\n\n<p>By the logic stated in Joel K's answer, consider that the one making that bracha is the one who led the zimun.

Unfortunately, many pastors, priests, or rabbis don’t come to help these precious souls as they near death and I am the one with them in their final days.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I read the Psalms and offer the blessing from Numbers 6:22-27.\nPlease show me how and what to pray with these men and women as they approach death.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Thank you for asking the question and performing this great action. In his book <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Products/MOUH.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mourning in Halacha</a> (pp. 29-46), Rabbi Chaim Binyamin Goldberg has a number of recommendations based on Jewish law which would apply to your visits.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is desirable to explain to the patient that illness in this world is a kindness which the Holy One bestowed for mankind. The patriarch Jacob prayed and requested that people should become sick so that they could give their final commands to their family and so that their children would have time to come and be with their parent</li>\n<li>It is desirable to speak with the patient about the need for giving instructions and putting his affairs in order, e.g., if he owes money, or if others owe him; if he has money or property deposited with others, or if he holding deposits for others</li>\n<li>It is desirable to speak with him in a positive way regarding how he wishes his property to be disposed and what he wishes to command regarding personal and family matters. It is very important to him to explain the great spiritual merit that a person receives when he gives <em>tzedakah</em> (charity) before parting from his belongings</li>\n<li>One must be extremely careful when speaking to the sick person about these matters, to make sure that one's words do not cause them suffering and worsen his condition</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Regarding prayers, Jewish law prescribes saying <em>viduy</em>, a confession of sins, before departing this world, as a great merit to the soul. This is also seen as a powerful aid for rapid and complete recovery. Legal texts state one should tell the patient \"Most of those who confessed did not die, and many who did not confess died. Many who are walking the streets recite the confession, and in reward for confessing you will live. Whoever confesses has a portion in the World to Come\".</p>\n\n<p>The <em>viduy</em> is said near death. See <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/364287/jewish/The-Viduy-Confession-Prayers.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for more details, translation and transliteration.</p>\n\n<p>When a person who is ill prays, it is very effective. Therefore the sick person himself should try to pray from the depths of his heart. Recommended psalms are some or all of psalms 16, 23, 25, 51, 91, 102, 103, 121, 139, 142. Additional recitations (e.g., Pitum HaKetoret) can be found in Jewish prayer books if you have access to one. See pp. 34-40 and 45-46 of Mourning in Halacha for additional prayers including for the final moments.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/364288/jewish/Jewish-Prayers-for-the-Final-Moments-of-Life.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here from Chabad</a> for prayers for final moments (with Isaac Moses' very helpful <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/100225/11501\">prioritisation and guide to these prayers</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is intended as a supplement to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/100214/2\">mbloch's answer</a>, which refers and links to a collection of practices and prayers that provides ample material for the chaplain to choose from.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking without pastoral experience or particular expertise this area of law and custom, I can suggest which of the prayers listed are likely to be most familiar to all Jews, including those with limited synagogue or Hebrew background.

Or, to put it another way, when the gemara you quote (Sanhedrin 68b) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"תניא, אמר רבי יוסי: מתחילה לא היו מרבין מחלוקת בישראל, אלא בית דין של שבעים ואחד יושבין בלשכת הגזית</p>\n<p>[A beraisa was] repeated: Rabbi Yosei said: Initially, discord would not proliferate among Israel. Rather, the court of seventy-one judges would sit in the Chamber of Hewn Stone...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It says \"לא היו מרבין מחלוקת -- discord would not proliferate\", <strong>not</strong> \"לא היו מחלוקת -- there was no discord\". And the translation is apt, we mean here מחלוקת in the sense of discord, not difference of opinion.</p>\n<p>There were three styles of tefillin found in ancient use during the Maccabean and Bar Kokhva Revolts. Among the them both the styles we now identify with Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam.[1] The Sanhedrin saw no need to resolve the dispute, because it hadn't become a point of discord.</p>\n<p>Even earlier, the tribe of Efraim didn't have the letter shin in their Hebrew -- thus the whole \"<em>shibboles</em>\" vs \"<em>sibboles</em>\" story in Shofetim 12. They must have fulfilled the mitzvah by saying \"Sema Yisrael...\", and the Sanhedrin didn't rule that Shema was one or the other.</p>\n<p>Each city and <em>sheivet</em> had its own high courts, and only questions that needed escalation were referred to higher courts. They are even prohibited from punting a question they were capble of adjudicating themselves! (Sanhedrin 16b) So, if a city beis din or the sheivet's beis din hagadol had a ruling they were content with, the question never went to the Sanhedrin. And so, there would necessarily be regional differences.</p>\n<p>And that was a good thing.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[1] Geza Vermes, “Pre-Mishnaic Jewish Worship and the Phylacteries from the Dead Sea,” Vetus Testamentum 9 (1959); J.T. Milik, “Textes littéraires,” in Discoveries in the Judaean Desert, Vol. 2* (texte) (Oxford 1961): p. 81.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Essentially, the difference between the two sources you cited is the difference between Mishnah and Talmud (in their original senses, as in Sotah 22a, Kiddushin 30a, Bava Metzia 33a-b, etc.). \"Mishnah\" is the basic halachos; \"Talmud\" is the analysis of those halachos, including also the application of them to different scenarios and conditions. (The Rambam, Hilchos Talmud Torah 1:11-12, calls the first one \"Torah shebaal peh\" and the second one \"Talmud.\")</p>\n\n<p>So the \"Mishnah\" part, the actual halachos, continued to be said כנתינתן מסיני; everyone knew them clearly. The \"Talmud\" part is, as you said, subject to human variability, and that's where they would need to resort to the Sanhedrin (as indeed implied in Devarim 17:8ff, כי יפלא ממך דבר למשפט).</p>\n\n<p>Over time, of course, things migrate from \"Talmud\" to \"Mishnah,\" in the sense that once a halachah is applied (via \"Talmud\" analysis and, if necessary, a vote of the Sanhedrin) to a certain scenario, then that becomes \"Mishnah,\" settled case law. (For example, the Baal Hatanya writes in his <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh5/6/2/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Talmud Torah 2:1</a> that the Tur, Shulchan Aruch and Rema - where many of the halachos come from the Talmud - are categorized as \"Mishnah\" for purposes of Torah study, while the commentaries on them count as \"Talmud.\")</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam, in his <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/hakdama/3-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction to Perush Hamishnayos</a>, draws such a distinction within the \"Mishnah,\" between the halachos that were known to have been given to Moshe at Sinai (which remained clear and were never subject to debate, even after machlokes began to proliferate) and the halachos derived later on (such as via the 13 Middos), where there was unclarity, and thus dispute.</p>\n\n<p>In short, then, the Gemara in Sanhedrin (should be 88b, by the way) is talking about \"Talmud\" and the halachos derived from it; Rashi is talking about \"Mishnah,\" where originally both parts of it were clear, and later on only one part of it - the ones known to be Halachah Lemoshe Misinai - remained so.</p>\n\n<p>To give an example, using the first Mishnah of Berachos:</p>\n\n<p>מאימתי קורין את שמע בערבית: that Shema has to be recited in the evening (ובשכבך), and that there exists a definition of when this begins - universally accepted, and never lost. Every talmid chacham, from Moshe down to our times, learned this כנתינתו מסיני (not necessarily with the same wording, of course; Biblical Hebrew would probably have been מן מתי or something like that.)</p>\n\n<p>משעה שהכהנים נכנסים לאכול בתרומתן: includes two points: (a) that kohanim who were tamei (and toveled) have to wait until \"evening\" to eat terumah, and (b) that this is the same time when \"evening\" begins as far as Shema. (a) is also universally accepted (based on the known facts that ובא השמש וטהר means טהר יומא, and that ואחר יאכל מן הקדשים refers to terumah), while (b) is not (as we see that the Gemara there brings several other opinions). In other words, at one time all talmidei chachamim knew and learned when \"evening\" begins for both of these purposes; later on they still knew and learned (a) כנתינתו מסיני, but weren't sure about (b), and so argued about it.</p>\n\n<p>עד סוף האשמורה הראשונה... עד חצות... עד שיעלה עמוד השחר: obviously a matter of machlokes. From Moshe until the Zugos, it was known (it may have been decided by a vote of the Sanhedrin, for example) that ובשכבך delineates a certain time of the night, beginning at time X and ending at time Y. (It's also possible that in one generation the Sanhedrin voted one way, and in a later generation differently; see Rambam, Hilchos Mamrim 2:1.) But later on this was forgotten, and so different Chachamim try to reconstruct X and Y, each in their own way.</p>\n\n\n",

DId they do Smicha on Yom Tov before H & S? How did they treat witnesses before the Machlokos in Sanhedrin? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam, in the first lines of his introductions to both <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/hakdama/1-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Perush Hamishnayos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/0000.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yad Hachazakah</a>, states explicitly that all of the mitzvos were given by Hashem to Moshe, and then taught by Moshe to the Jewish People, \"with their interpretations.\" In Perush Hamishnayos, he gives the mitzvah of sukkah as an example - the posuk says בסוכות תשבו שבעת ימים, and Moshe was given the details: only men are obligated in sukkah, women and sick people and travelers are not, the schach has to be made of plant matter, etc.</p>\n\n<p>He also goes on to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכאשר מת ע\"ה, אחר שהנחיל ליהושע מה שנאצל עליו מן הפירוש, והחכים והתבונן בו יהושע ואנשי דורו, וכל מה שקבל ממשה, הוא, או אחד מן הזקנים, אין לדבר עליו ולא נפלה בו מחלוקת. ומי שלא שמע בו פירוש מפי הנביא ע\"ה, מן העניינים המשתרגים מהם, הוציא דינים בסברות, במידות השלש עשרה, הנתונות על הר סיני, שהתורה נדרשת בהם. ובאותם הדינים שהוציאו יש דברים שלא נפלה בהן מחלוקת אבל הסכימו עליהם, ויש מהם מה שנפלה בו מחלוקת בין שתי דעות, זה אומר בכה וזה אומר בכה, וזה סובר סברה ונתחזקה לדעתו, וזה סובר סברה ונתחזקה לדעתו, כי מידות ההיקש שעל דרך התוכחת יקרה בסברותיהם המקרה הזה. וכשהייתה נופלת המחלוקת היו הולכים אחרי הרוב, כמו שנאמר, אחרי רבים להטות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>the gist being that all halachos were known in Yehoshua's time and later: some of them had been transmitted by Moshe, others were derived using the 13 Middos and unanimously agreed to by the Sages, and still others were decided by majority vote.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of the machlokos of later times concern what engineers call \"corner cases.\" Take your example of the argument of Beis Hillel and Beis Shammai about yibum (I assume you mean the one about צרת הבת), then consider among other things: (a) how often is yibum needed in the first place, (b) how often was the deceased married to his niece or some other woman who would be an ervah to his brother, (c) how often would the one to whom she's an ervah be the only brother available for yibum, etc. - and the result is that the case probably was a rarity that wouldn't make a difference to 99.9% of marriages. (Also, the Gemara in Yevamos 13b-14a brings the opinions of Reish Lakish and Rav that Beis Shammai never actually acted in accordance with their opinion anyway.) (If instead you meant their machlokes about whether kiddushin requires a shaveh prutah or a shaveh dinar - there too, most people probably used a larger amount anyway, just as nowadays few people do kiddushin with a 25-cent ring.)</p>\n\n<p>With some halachos, too, it may have been the case that the instructions given to Moshe allowed for more than one way of doing things. An example (according to Rav Hai Gaon) is the three types of teruah (shevarim, teruah, or both together): each one, he says, is a valid form of teruah, but eventually the Chachamim (specifically, R' Abahu in Rosh Hashanah 34a) decided to make it uniform for everyone. (The Rambam, notably, disagrees about that one: he says that there was only one original form of teruah, but it was forgotten over time, and so different minhagim developed. It's worth bearing in mind that we're used to hearing shofar only during Elul-Tishrei, but in earlier times the shofar was used for other purposes too, such as an alarm, and of course for that they didn't necessarily have to blow according to any particular sequence. So it's plausible enough that people may have confused one shofar sound with another.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Chronological order of stories involving Rabban Gamliel\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There’s several stories (that I know of) which deal with Rabban Gamliel acting in a less-than-ideal way in regard to his contemporaries:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rosh HaShanah 25a-b, where Rabban Gamliel insisted that R’ Yehoshua violate Yom Kippur according to his own calculations and defer to that of the court</li>\n<li>Bechoros 36a, where Rabban Gamliel publicly humiliated R’ Yehoshua in response to his contradictory ruling regarding R’ Tzadok’s firstborn animal</li>\n<li>Berachos 27b-28a, where Rabban Gamliel publicly humiliated R’ Yehoshua in response to his contradictory ruling regarding Maariv being obligatory or not, and which also deals with the aftermath of this and the above two incidents, in which Rabban Gamliel was temporarily deposed from his office</li>\n<li>Bava Metzi’a 59b, where Rabban Gamliel has his brother-in-law R’ Eliezer excommunicated for arguing against the majority; ultimately R’ Eliezer’s tefillos inadvertently led to Rabban Gamliel’s early death</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is there any indication as to the chronological order of these stories? (Obviously Rabban Gamliel’s death in Bava Metzi’a happened last, but it’s possible that the excommunication happened before any of the other incidents cited here.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/89016/\">As I’ve said previously</a>, it seems to me that the first three incidents cited took place before the other two, as Berachos only records those two incidents as prompting Rabban Gamliel’s being deposed, leaving out the latter incident. Given that both deal with R’ Yehoshua, and the conclusion of the story in Bechoros is repeated in the story in Berachos, it’s possible that all three of these happened simultaneously. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps Berachos only cites Rosh HaShanah and Bechoros (and itself) as those were the <em>immediate</em> triggers, but there had been a history of perceived abuse of the position by Rabban Gamliel before then?</p>\n\n<p>(Feel free to edit in other stories that I missed, but I think these are all of them.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Partial answer:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>בראש השנה <strong>אשתקד</strong> צעריה בבכורות במעשה דרבי צדוק צעריה.   (emphasis mine).   To me this means that a bunch of time had passed (a year?) between the first incident mentioned (Yom-Kippur) and the current one (Maariv).   </p></li>\n<li><p>Not quite sure where to place R' Tzadok's story.   Given the order mentioned, I think it likely it took place between #1 and #3, though given the similarities in the story (e.g. \"אלמלא אני חי והוא מת\"), it's quite possible #2 and #3 took place at the same time. </p></li>\n<li><p>The story in Berachot (Maariv) results in R' Eliezer Ben Azaria becoming a Nasi, yet in the famous story in the Hagaddah, he's at a seder together with R' Eliezer, implying that the latter had not yet been excommunicated.

    "content": "# What happens when you turn 100?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishna says:</p>\n\n<p><em>A hundred-year-old is as if he were dead, passed away and ceased connection with the world. [Avot 5:25]</em></p>\n\n<p>At first blush this seems callous and disrespectful.  What is the teaching here?</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe said:  When God said \"No man will see Me and live\", it implies \"While alive one does not see, but when dead one sees.\" \"A 100-year-old is as if he were dead,\" means that he can have insights into Godliness.  Also, \"passed away and ceased connection with the world\" means \"has risen above all worldly matters\". His focus and concern are solely spiritual.</p>\n\n<p>I like it, but am not fully satisfied.  Other explanations?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>When I studied at Lubavitcher Yeshivah (about 30 years ago), I learned a sicha (talk) of the Rebbe on Parshas Va'Yera (Gen. 17).</p>\n\n<p>I believe the sicha appears in one of the earlier books of the Yiddish volumes (aleph - vav)</p>\n\n<p>In general, I am sharing my memory of the teaching with you based on that sicha and my Yeshivah learning at that time on the subject of that Mishnah in Pirkei Avos (5:25).</p>\n\n<p>It appears that you have only a snipet of the entire teaching (the OP's reference to the Rebbe talking about a 100 year old etc.)</p>\n\n<p>I hope by sharing the rest, that it would sound more satisfying.</p>\n\n<p>The Rebbe starts with a famous story about the Tzemach Tzedek (3rd Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch) and his grandson the Rebbe Rashab (5th Rebbe).</p>\n\n<p>When the Rashab was a boy of about 5, he came into his grandfather's room crying. The Tzemach Tzedek asked him why he was crying?</p>\n\n<p>The boy said that he just learned in Cheder that Hashem \"appeared\" (revealed Himself) to Abraham. The boy was so upset, because he also wanted that Hashem should appear to him too!</p>\n\n<p>The Tzemach Tzedek answered: \"When a Jew of 99 years of age decides to circumcise himself, he merits that Hashem appears to him.\" The boy calmed down. </p>\n\n<p>What did the answer mean?</p>\n\n<p>The Rebbe Rayatz (6th Rebbe) explained that a Jew does not recon his years by his passport date. There are older people who are \"young\" (immature) and so called younger people who are considered old (in wisdom and maturity). Actual age is not the deciding factor; rather it is spiritual development.</p>\n\n<p>The Rebbe then explains that this applies to the entire reading of Pirkei Avos 5:25. (the ages there are from 5 - 100)</p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah is not discussing physical ages, but rather discussing levels of character refinement.</p>\n\n<p>(Kabbalah teaches that the soul has 100 levels of refinement available because there are ten sefirot in the \"image of G-d\" in a man. In this world of \"Tikkun\" (repair) the sefirot may unite, thereby producing ten times ten = 100 middot (character) combinations to work on. NOTE: the popular combinations listed in sefiras ha'omer are only 7x7=49 middos, because only the purely emotional combinations of middos are being focused on. (Chesed - Malchus) However, there are really ten including the intellect; being the 3 of Chabad as well.)</p>\n\n<p>We should notice, that the Mishnah says \"ben-arbayim\" (40) and not \"ben-arbayim shannah\" (40 years) for instance. (Although the word \"shanim\" is mentioned at the beginning by the youngest ages, it changes later.)</p>\n\n<p>Although it may be that it takes an average man a year to refine each middah, the truth is that everyone is different and may refine themselves at different paces with some middos taking longer than others.</p>\n\n<p>So, the Mishnah is not binding itself to actual age. Rather, it is a scale of 1-100 where each level is another percent toward 100% mature development of the soul and body in this world.</p>\n\n<p>As each person develops further, they are capable of more levels.</p>\n\n<p>So, the Tzemach Tzedek's answer to the young boy was that when a Jew who has worked on himself tirelessly to achieve 99% development, runs to circumcise himself for Hashem, because 99% just isn't good enough; he must have 100% closeness to Hashem, then Hashem feels obligated to reveal Himself to him. (This explains why the boy would stop crying as obviously he was only 5 (5% developed), and had no reason to be worried that Hashem was ignoring him. He now knew that if he worked on things, he could achieve such revelation.)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the \"90 year old is bent over\" actually means that the \"90% master of middos has his body and yetzer hara (evil inclination) bent over completely to his own spiritual control.\"</p>\n\n<p>The \"100 year old is \"like dead\", null and gone from the world\" actually means that the \"100% master of his own middos is not subject to physicality at all and it is as if they are not bound by this world.\"</p>\n\n<p>Pirkei Avos is a set of teachings to improve middos. It is not a simple commentary on aspects of life. So it makes more sense that the message here, is one of human character development, and what someone could achieve if they work on it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>one who reaches that age probably lost all his friends and has all kinds of health problems, like poor eye sight, hard of hearing, etc. thus people tend to stay away from him due to difficulty communicating with him and other issues so he feels all alone</p>\n\n\n",

What Sefarim does one have to learn? What learning method is the most effective? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to the Gemara in Sanhedrin (5a), one would need to be learned (גמירנא), able to reason (סבירנא), and have permission from his (qualified) Rav (נקיטנא רשותא).  Normally, a rav will only grant this permission, known (colloquially) as סמיכה, <em>semicha</em>, after being satisfied that the student has proven the first two conditions, and possibly after an internship period known as שימוש (<em>shimush</em>).</p>\n\n<p>There are several different areas of Rabbinic expertise.  For most religious questions (איסור והיתר), the permission is referred to as יורה יורה, \"He may teach\" (or decide).  For religious civil law, the permission is called ידין ידין, \"He may judge\" (or adjudicate).  <em>Semicha</em> may be limited to the scope of an individual's areas of knowledge (e.g. Shabbos, <em>kashrus</em>, <em>Nidda</em>) within the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There are many <em>Kolels</em> with <em>semicha</em> programs, and I believe Yeshiva University has one as well.  These programs generally focus on <em>Orach Chaim</em>, the laws of Shabbos and Yom Tov (sections 2 and 3, or 3 to 6 in the <em>Mishna Berura</em>), and on <em>Yoreh Deah</em>, the laws of <em>kashrus</em> (בשר בחלב and תערובות) and purity (<em>Nidda</em> and <em>tevilla</em>).  Other programs focus on civil law (in <em>Choshen Mishpat</em>) or on marital law (in <em>Even HaEzer</em>).  Those aiming for pulpits (or community rabbis) may have more specific requirements.</p>\n\n<p>As for authoring a <em>sefer</em>, I would suggest that the question is a bit premature.  (Especially if you're asking on this site.)  However, the upper echelon of <em>Poskim</em> can generally issue rulings in all four sections of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, and amass enough experience to gain acclaim among their colleagues others so they become the targets of queries (שאלות).  Eventually, an especially accomplished <em>posek</em> may have enough responses to be able to publish a <em>sefer</em> of שאלות ותשובות (Responsa).  Others may be able to write a commentary, or clarify a section of laws in their own words.  <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> is of this latter form, and was written after Rabbi Epstein had been the rabbi of a large community for a number of years.</p>\n\n\n",

rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Chinuch, Mitzvah 208</a> codifies this. The punishment for passing one's child to Molech is death by stoning. </p>\n\n<p>Continuing the discussion about Molech, the gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.64b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 64b</a>) proceeds to make a <strong>shocking</strong>(!) inference:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב אחא בריה דרבא העביר כל זרעו פטור שנאמר <strong>מ</strong>זרעך ולא <strong>כל</strong> זרעך</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, says: [One who] passed all his offspring [through fire to the priests of Molekh is] exempt, as it is stated: “<strong>of</strong> your offspring,” [indicating:] But not <strong>all</strong> your offspring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Semag (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%95_%D7%9E\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סמ\"ג · לאו · מ</a>) offers a WILD rationale for this reasoning.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>העביר כל זרעו פטור שנאמר כי <strong>מ</strong>זרעו נתן למולך <strong>מקצת זרעו ולא כל זרעו</strong> ויש טעם בזה לתשובת המינים מפני שב<strong>מיתת ב\"ד מתכפרין המומתין וזה עשה כל כך עבירה גדולה שאין הקב\"ה רוצה שיהא לו שום כפרה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>If one passed all of his children [to Molech] he is exempt [from being put to death via <em>beis din</em>], because it says [a person who gives] <strong>from</strong> his seed to Molech. ie  <strong>some of his seed, not all of his seed</strong>, and there is a reason for this to answer the heretics, namely that <strong>death via <em>beis din</em> redeems the said person who was put to death, and this person</strong> [who passed ALL of his children to Molech] <strong>did such a huge <em>aveirah</em> that Hashem doesn't want him to receive any redemption at all</strong> [ie via being put to death via <em>beis din</em>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: the Semag says the punishment of stoning is only for a person that gives \"<strong>some</strong>\" of his children to Molech. But if that person gave \"<strong>all</strong>\" of his children to Molech, it's such a big <em>aveirah</em> that there is no forgiveness and we don't give him a <em>kaparah</em> by putting him to death.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>This answer is not about Rishonim, but the very idea of sin too severe to be punished</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The tradition I've got from R' Moshe Luria Z\"l (Beis Gnozay), <strong>there's no sin too severe to justify the complete extermination of the Jewish soul</strong>. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>This is similar to the idea of <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A6%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">עצם הלוז</a> - the \"indestructible\" bone (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luz_(bone)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">WIKI</a>) from which a person is resurrected in the days of Moshiach. <a href=\"http://%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%A9%20%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%9D,%20%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%AA%20%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA,%20%D7%93%D7%A3%20%D7%A7%D7%9C%22%D7%96%20%D7%A2%22%D7%91,%20%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%95%20%D7%92%D7%9D%20%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA%20%D7%A1%D7%98,%D7%90,%20%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%97,%20%D7%91.)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Midrash</a> explains that no matter how bad the body is decomposed, this bone always remains to allow the resurrection. Allegorically, the Jewish soul never gets totally corrupted, but some part stays pure to allow the continuation.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another allegory the Gemorrah elsewhere brings is a tree, that's been cut, but as long as the roots exist, it grows back. Even if most of the soul is soiled and needs thorough cleansing, the root of the Jewish soul gets never stained.</p></li>\n<li><p>The 600k letters of the Torah analogy: as every Jewish soul is connected or stems from a letter of the Torah, it can't totally vanish, as it would \"lack\" the  letters of the Torah.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yet another proof is from the accepted Halachah on us, the Jews, being G-d's sons as R' Meir (B\"B 10) even when we don't follow His commandments. As no father, no matter how angry he is with his sons, will attempt to murder them, God's will never let us be cut out.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Torah uses the word כרת to designate the cutting of a soul from \"the tree of souls\" and thus ending its existence. For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּשְׁמַרְתֶּם אֶת הַשַּׁבָּת כִּי קֹדֶשׁ הִוא לָכֶם מְחַלְלֶיהָ מוֹת יוּמָת כִּי כָּל הָעֹשֶׂה בָהּ מְלָאכָה וְנִכְרְתָה הַנֶּפֶשׁ הַהִוא מִקֶּרֶב עַמֶּיהָ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemorrah (for example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Moed_Katan.28a.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">M\"K 28</a>) tries to define כרת, but stays within earthy terms (similar to מיתה בידי שמיים):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבה: [מיתה] מחמשים ועד ששים שנה זו היא מיתת כרת. מת בחמשים שנה זו היא מיתת כרת חמשים ושתים שנה זו היא מיתתו של שמואל הרמתי ששים זו היא מיתה בידי שמים\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One can conclude that despite its severity the Sages prefer to \"pass the responsibility to the heavenly court\", rather than proclaim the total abolition of a Jewish soul.</p></li>\n<li><p>As I often point out, many interpretations should be taken as motivational rather than informational. Just like we, parents, tell to our kids: \"if you put your fingers in the outlet you'll die\" or \"if you drop out of school you'll be poor and starving as an adult\".  Therefore those statements should be processed with caution.</p></li>\n<li><p>(some Kabbalic thoughts) There are 5 parts/levels of a Jewish soul, (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org.il/Concepts/Item.asp?ArticleID=55&CategoryID=200&SubjectID=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">נרנח\"י</a>) and different sins impair different parts of the soul. A Jewish court has only the jurisdiction to judge the sins that impair the lower parts (נפש, רוח) but not the higher ones. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore some serious sins mentioned in the Torah are either punished by Kares or left [intentionally] totally unpunished (by our courts) (ז\"ל, בועל ארמית, and more), in other words, only G-d can treat such impairment.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

After saying that it’s forbidden not only because of Dina d’Malchusa but also by Torah law, he turns to address the premise of the question: that studying is Bitul Torah. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם חשקה נפשו בתורה אין לו לדאוג שמא לא ידע כל כך ולא יהיה לו סימן טוב עלייהו אבל האמת שאין בזה ענין בטול תורה שמאחר שהולך ללמוד למודי חול הוא רק עצלות בעלמא כשלומד באופן שלא לידע כי הזמן הוא עכ״פ מבטל ואדרבה מתרגל שלא לידע מה שלומד ומתרגל לעצילות</p>\n  \n  <p>If his soul desires Torah, he should not be worried maybe he doesn’t know so much and there will not be a good Siman on him. In truth, there is not Bitul Torah in this, for once he’s going to learn secular subjects, it’s merely ordinary laziness if he learns in a way that he doesn’t know it, as the time will in any event be wasted. To the contrary, he regularly acts to not know what he learns, and he regularly acts toward laziness. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, if one is in school and is learning secular subjects, it is <em>not</em> Bitul Torah to do his homework or whatever else is necessary to retain that information, as the other option is letting the time in class go to waste.</p>\n\n\n",

Their prominence in this part of <em>B'reshis</em> would be explained not by their connection to food but by their security roles.

(Notable others include Nechemya for Artachshast' and Ravshakeh [=רב of משקה] for Sancheriv.) So maybe their appearance there is not too surprising, albeit exclusive.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many rulers in the ancient world were murdered in plots centering around a butler, a baker or somebody filling those roles. It wasn't a simple matter to slip poison into the king's beverage or food. The butler had to care for the king's life and his security, not just pour his drink and serve him the cup. . .

We see this by David who loved goodness and kindness and prayed (Ps. 23:6) \"Only may goodness and kindness chase me\"; the same is true for peace. But Aharon, he explains, was different. He not only loved peace but chose to chase it. How did Hilel know this? It says in B'shalach (Ex. 14:8) that the pharaoh took his best chariots and chased the Jews. It clearly wasn't to fight them: there's no mention of weapons in what the pharaoh took. So he must have been chasing peace. And we know this was Aharon because Aharon was not with the Jews until here (there's no mention of him from the exodus in 12:51 until this point) but he was after this point (he appears again a short while later in 16:6).</p>\n\n\n",

REBBI DOUBLE SAYS: ON THE TORAH, NEVI’IM AND KESUVIM. REBBI YITZCHAK SAYS: EVEN ON THE OUTER BOOKS. REBBI DOUBLE SAID TO HIM: NO, IF YOU HAVE SAID ON THE OUTER BOOKS, THERE WILL BE NO LIMIT TO THIS. REBBI MSH TESTIFIED ABOUT MONICA WHO WISHED TO REMOVE ALL THE OUTER BOOKS, AND REBBI DOUBLE COMMANDED HER AND SAID TO HER: EVERY DAY WE JUDGE THE INNOCENT AND THE GUILTY THROUGH THE VOTE, BUT WE DO NOT PRESENT GENERAL RULES ON THE OUTER BOOKS, AS IT SAYS (KOHELETH 12) MY SON, MAKE MANY BOOKS</p>\n<p>גמרא: למה לי למתני כיצד שואלין את היודעין ליתני כיצד שואלין קמ״ל טעמא דשואלין את היודעין הא לאו הכי שואלין אף על העכו״ם פשיטא הקמ״ל דהשתא הוא דאקרי יודעין הא נפק מדוכתיה לדוכתא אחרינא התם נמי איקרי יודעין קמ״ל:</p>\n<p>Why do I need to teach ‘how do we ask the Yodeyans’, He should teach ‘how do we ask’. This comes to tell us the reason [we are restricted in asking] is because we are asking the Yodeyans. Were it not so, we would even be able to ask about other religions. That is obvious! No, this come to tell us that it is now whence [a Yodeyan] is called Yodeyan. If he went out from his website to another website, there would he still be called a Yodeyan? This indeed comes to tell us [that he would not].</p>\n<p>רבי דובל אומר וכו: מאי טעמיה דרבי דובל כדתנן אמרו היודעין לא ירדו אבותינו למצרים אלא כדי לקבל את התורה ואם אין אנו מקיימין אותה מוטב לנו לעבוד אותם בפרך השתא דקאמר תורה שבכתב תורה שבעל פה מנא ליה מנא ליה כדקאמרן</p>\n<p>REBBI DOUBLE SAYS ETC.: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Double? As we have learned in a Mishnah. The Yodeyans said: Our forefathers only descended into Egypt in order to accept to the Torah, and if we are not fulfilling it [properly] it would be better for us to serve them in hardship. Now that he is discussing the Written Torah, how does he know of the Oral Torah? How does he know of it? As we have [already] said!</p>\n<p>אמר אלקס סבר רבי דובל מאי תורה בין תורה שבעל פה בין תורה שבכתב אי הכי הנביאים וכתובים למה לי לתני תורה ואנא ידענא תורה שבכתב והנביאים וכתובים בכלל צריכא כיון דתורה שבעל פה בכלל לא ניחא ליה לתנא למתני ביה תרתי ולתני תורה שבכתב ותורה שבעל פה וליליף הנביאים וכתובים מיניה חד מן חד יליף תרי מן חד לא יליף:</p>\n<p>Alex said: Rabbi Double thought, what is Torah [referring to]? Both the Written and Oral Torahs. If [that is] so, why do I need ‘the Nevi’im and Ketuvim’? He should teach ‘Torah’ and I will know that the Written Torah and the Nevi’im and Ketuvim are included [in that word]. It is needed. Since the Oral Torah is included, it does not please the Tanna to teach two items [in one]. And so let him teach ‘the Written and Oral Torah’ and let him derive ‘the Nevi’im and Ketuvim’ from it. He will derive one from one, but not two from one.</p>\n<p>אמר רב שלום אלקס איהו קמייתא דהדר לא ואמאי נפק קמייתא בתר דנחת למהוי אלימא מן בין חבריא שדרו גזירפטי האי מבני חילא למיהב ליה תלת מאה רבוא דהבא ולא ליהדר טפי לבי היודעין ולא קבלה מיניה בתר הכי נפק קלא מן הרמנא דמלכא ארישיה למקטל ביה ערק וסבר מטמר נפשיה אזל טשא בי מדרשא ואוקי התם ויליף וגריס להו אורייתא יומא חדא אידכר האי עלמא דבי יודעין וסבר למימר אנא לית אנא יכיל למהדר בהו אלא אית לי גבאי האי גברא רבא ואיהו צורבא מרבנן ונפק אלקס בתרייתא תותי שמיה דידיה דקמייתא:</p>\n<p>Rav Shalom said: Is Alex the first one which has [now] returned? No [he is not]. And [then] why did the first one leave? After he had settled to be the superior among his colleagues, the royal officers sent a soldier [to Alex] to give him [by way of bribery] three million golden pieces in order so that he shall never return again. [However, Alex] did not accept it from him. After this [incident], an official proclamation went out from the king’s authority upon [Alex’s] head, to kill him. [Alex then] fled, and figured that he must hide himself. He went and hid out in the study hall, and established [himself] there, and he learned and taught them Torah [there]. One day, he recalled upon the world of Mi Yodeya, and he thought to say, I am unable to return to them. However, there is a great man by my locale, and he is a young scholar among the Rabbis [and so Alex sent him]. So, the second Alex went out under the username of the first.</p>\n<p>תניא אלו הן ספרים החיצונים ספרי לעז ספרי מדינת ישראל ספרי מומרים בעי רב גרשון האי דקאמר רבי דובל אין לדבר סוף הא קחזינן דאיכא אמר ליה רבות אימא סיפא אין נותנין הכלל על ספרים החיצונים אלמא הדר ביה רבי דובל:</p>\n<p>We have learnt in a Baraita: These are the outer books, books of secular topics, books of the State of Israel and books of renegade Jews. Rav Gershon asked: This which Rabbi Double is saying ‘there will be no limit to this’, we see that there is [a limit]! Rabot said [to Rav Gershon], say from the ending [of the Mishnah], ‘but we do not present general rules on the outer books’. Therefore, Rabbi Double retracted [his opinion].</p>\n<p>דרש עמם בר בלאח כתיב (אסתר א) וישלח ספרים וכתיב (אסתר ט) וישלח ספרים מה הכא ספרים ואל עם ועם כלשונו אף התם ספרים אל כל היהודים לומר לך דהלכה כרבי יצחק ולא יחסר מעם היהודים:</p>\n<p>M bar Bloch expounded: it is written (Esther 1) ‘And he sent books’ and it says (Esther 9) ‘And he sent books’. Just as here [in the first verse, it is referring to] books, and to each nation according to their language, also there [in the second verse, it is referring to] books to the Jews. [This is in order] to teach you that the law follows Rabbi Yitzchak, and so that the Jew nation shall not be lacking [books].</p>\n<p>בעי עאל מהו לדבר אבל לא לשאול מהו להשיב על הנשאלין מהו לתקן מהו להכשיר הפסול מהו להוציא בעל מום מהו לאסור הטריפה מהו לאסור המותר תיקו:</p>\n<p>Al asked: What is [the law] to speak of [a prohibited item], but not to ask of it? What is [the law] to respond to the [prohibitively] asked? What is [the law] to edit [the prohibitively asked]? What is [the law] to make the prohibited into a permitted [question]? What is [the law] validate the invalidated? What is [the law] to delete a blemished [post]? What is [the law] to prohibit a spam [post]? What is [the law] to prohibit the permitted? Let [these questions] stand [unanswered].</p>\n<p>ת״ר אין בין רבי דובל לרבי יצחק אלא שלשה דברים בלבד ואלו הן כינויי לעז שיחה גזולה וזמן קבלת התשובה והתנן רבי יצחק אומר אף ספרים החיצונים ואמרינן מאי ספרים החיצונים כל ספרים החיצונים אלמא איכא טובא בינייהו לא קשיא הא ספרא הא מילתא</p>\n<p>The Rabbis taught [in a Braita]: There is no [difference] between Rabbi Double and Rabbi Yitzchak except three things, and these are they: jargons, plagiarism, and the time of answer acceptance. But we have learned in our Mishnah: Rabbi Yitzchak says: Even the outer books. And we say on this, what [does the Mishnah mean by] the outer books? [It means] all the outer books. So we see, there is indeed many [things] which they differ upon! This is not a problem. Here [in the Mishnah] is a book, here [in the Braita] is a thing.</p>\n<p>קתני מיהת כינויי לעז שיחה גזולה וזמן קבלת התשובה כינויי לעז סברי רבנן למימר משלי העכו״ם נינהו עד שבא עמם בר בלאח מארץ רחוקה ואמר קבלה בידי אין כינויי לעז אלא דיבורי בני אדם וכל חרד לבו לא ידבר בהם שיחה גזולה ומי איכא דפליג עליה דרבי דובל אין רבי יואל בן קירא היא דאמר מה שיחה שאינה גזולה יש בה חוששין לספק גזולה מחמת הטבע ושרי שיחה גזולה דוודאי גזולה עאכ״ו דשרי</p>\n<p>We have nonetheless taught of jargons, plagiarism, and the time of answer acceptance. Jargons: The Rabbis thought to say [that they are] gentile quips. Until, M bar Bloch came from a distant land and said: I have a tradition that Jargons are just simply local dialectal expressions. However, anyone whose heart is righteous shall [better] not speak of them. Plagiarism: Does anyone argue with Rabbi Double [concerning this matter]? Yes, it is Rabbi Joel ben Kera, who said: Just as unplagiarized [content still] has a concern of a doubt of plagiarism by dint of nature, [however,] it is [nonetheless] permitted. Plagiarism which has certainly been plagiarized, all the more so that it should be permitted!</p>\n<p>מתיב אלקס ותסברא גזולה דספק נידוי ספק אינו נידוי מי אמרינן ליזיל ולשמתיה קמ״ל כל חרד לבו לא ידבר בהם וזמן קבלת התשובה כלל אמרו במרילנד כל תשובה שאין בה דרישה וחקירה תולין לא מקבלין ולא מוחקין אמר שמואל הא נקטנין זמן קבלת התשובה מעת לעת כפולה</p>\n<p>Alex questioned this: Is that at all logical? Plagiarized [content] which has an uncertainty of [receiving an account] suspension, do we say that he shall go and be suspended? This comes to teach us that anyone whose heart is righteous shall [better] not speak of them. The time of answer acceptance: They taught a general rule in Maryland: Any answer which does not contain examination and inquiry, we put it on hold, [that is,] we do not accept it, but we do not delete it. Shmuel said: But we have a teaching that the time of answer acceptance is a twenty-four hour period of time doubled.</p>\n<p>אמר ליה רבות בריה דמחשבות כי קתני מעת לעת כפולה היכא דאית ביה חקירה ודרישה אבל היכא דלית ליה כולי עלמא לא פליגי דתולין אמר אברהם בן יצחק ואמרי לה יוזר בן שייקס בן פיאב בן ניאן בן אעון ואמרי לה משום עזרא מעיקרא כל מאן דבעי לקבולי תיובתא אזל וקבל מאחר שיצאו הטרולין חזרו ותקנו שלא יהו מקבלין התשובה אלא מעת לעת כפולה:</p>\n<p>Rabot Brei DeMachashavot said to him: When we learnt [that the time of anwer acceptance is] a twenty-four hour period of time doubled, [only] where it contains examination and inquiry, however, if it does not contain [examination and inquiry] all do not disagree that we put it on hold. Avraham Ben Yitzchak said, and some say it  was User Ben Six Ben Five Ben Nine Ben One and some say from Ezra: Originally, anyone who wanted to accept an answer, went and accepted it. After the trolls went out [the mods] reconvended and enacted that [Yodeyans] shall not accept the answer unless a twenty-four hour period of time doubled [has elapsed].</p>\n<p>אמר רב מנחם אמר דני בר שר אמר דן משום זקן אחד וסבא הלל שמיה דבי המבקש אמרו ויוט אינו אלא תיפלה בעלמא והתנן רבי דובל אומר השאול מתוך ששואל לשם ויוט בא לידי לשמה אחיכו עליה\nאמר להו אלקס גברא רבה אמר מילתא לא תחיכו עליה וא\"כ אלמה תנן וצוה לה ואמר לה (אי סבירא ליה בא לידי לשמה צוה למה לי) אמר להו רב דניאל לא אמר רבי דובל אלא אמירה ומתוך גדולת תורתו שנו לה בלשון צוה תניא ויוט אינו אלא מלשון וי\"ו הבא להוסיף כל טוב שנאמר (משלי כ\"א) רדף צדקה וחסד ימצא חיים צדקה וכבוד:\nהדרן עלך כיצד שאולין וסליקא לה מסכת יודעין</p>\n<p>Rav Menachem said [in the name of] Dani bar Schoer [in the name of] Dan from a certain old man whose name is SabbaHillel: They have said in the academy of Mevaqesh: A vote is only a mere frivolity. Have we not learned in a Mishnah: Rabbi Double says: One who asks [a question] through asking for the purpose of votes, he will come to [ask] for its own sake. They laughed [upon hearing] this statement. Alex said to them: A great man said [this statement], you shall not laugh upon him. If so, why have we learnt in [our] Mishnah ‘And he commanded her, and he said to her’ (if he indeed holds [that one is able] to come [to asking] for its own sake, why do I need it to say ‘and he commanded her’). Rav Dniel said to them: Rabbi Double said [this statement] only by way of saying, [however], on account of the greatness of his Torah [scholarship], they taught the Mishnah using the language of ‘commanded’. We have learnt in a Baraita: The word vote is from the same language of the letter ‘vav’ which only comes to add on all goodness, as it says (Mishlei 21) One who chases charity and kindness will surely find life, charity, righteousness and honor.</p>\n<p>WE SHALL RETURN TO YOU KEITZAD SHOALIN AND MASECHET YODEYAN.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You forgot the Peirush Rashi on that (please feel free to add, I have actual work to do now, but I'll leave it as a community wiki answer):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משנה: כיצד שאולין את היודעין רבי דובל אומר שואלין על התורה הנביאים וכתובים רבי יצחק אומר אף על ספרים החיצונים אמר לו רבי דובל לא אם אמרת על ספרים החיצונים אין לדבר סוף רבי משהה העיד על מוניכא שבקשה להוציא כל דברי ספרים החיצונים וצוה לה רבי דובל ואמר לה בכל יום דנין את הזכאי ואת חיב על ידי ויוט ואין נותנין הכלל על ספרים החיצונים שנאמר (קבלת יב) בני וגו׳ עשות ספרים הרבה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi:<br>\nה\"ג <strong>כיצד שואלין את <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1763/16354\">היודענין</strong></a><br>\n<strong>על התורה</strong> - אין זה <a href=\"http://alhatorah.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">עלהתורה</a> באינטרנט, אלא עלהתורה אחר<br>\n<strong>רבי משהה</strong> - דהוה בן מאתים ועשר שנים</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גמרא: למה לי למתני כיצד שאולין את היודעין ליתני כיצד שאולין קמ״ל טעמא דשאולין את היודעין הא לאו הכי שאולין אף על העכו״ם פשיטא הקמ״ל דהשתא הוא דאקרי יודעין הא נפק מדוכתיה לדוכתא אחרינא התם נמי איקרי יודעין קמ״ל:</p>\n  \n  <p>רבי דובל אומר וכו: מאי טעמיה דרבי דובל כדתנן אמרו היודעין לא ירדו אבותינו למצרים אלא כדי לקבל את התורה ואם אין אנו מקיימין אותה מוטב לנו לעבוד אותם בפרך השתא דקאמר תורה שבכתב תורה שבעל פה מנא ליה מנא ליה כדקאמרן אמר אלקס סבר רבי דובל מאי תורה בין תורה שבעל פה בין תורה שבכתב אי הכי הנביאים וכתובים למה לי לתני תורה ואנא ידענא תורה שבכתב והנביאים וכתובים בכלל צריכא כיון דתורה שבעל פה בכלל לא ניחא ליה לתנא למתני ביה תרתי ולתני תורה שבכתב ותורה שבעל פה וליליף הנביאים וכתובים מיניה חד מן חד יליף תרי מן חד לא יליף:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>סבר רבי דובל</strong> - בכמה מקומות אחרות בש\"ס, כמו <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/76645/does-the-torah-prohibition-to-not-add-or-subtract-from-the-mitzvot-also-apply-to/76646#76646\">לגבי בל תוסיף</a> ואחרים.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב שלום אלקס איהו קמייתא דהדר לא ואמאי נפק קמייתא בתר דנחת למהוי אלימא מן בין חבריא שדרו גזירפטי האי מבני חילא למיהב ליה תלת מאה רבוא דהבא ולא ליהדר טפי לבי היודעין ולא קבלה מיניה בתר הכי נפק קלא מן הרמנא דמלכא ארישיה למקטל ביה ערק וסבר מטמר נפשיה אזל טשא בי מדרשא ואוקי התם ויליף וגריס להו אורייתא יומא חדא אידכר האי עלמא דבי יודעין וסבר למימר אנא לית אנא יכיל למהדר בהו אלא אית לי גבאי האי גברא רבא ואיהו צורבא מרבנן ונפק אלקס בתרייתא תותי שמיה דידיה דקמייתא:</p>\n  \n  <p>תניא אלו הן ספרים החיצונים ספרי לעז ספרי מדינת ישראל ספרי מומרים בעי רב גרשון האי דקאמר רבי דובל אין לדבר סוף הא קחזינן דאיכא אמר ליה רבות אימא סיפא אין נותנין הכלל על ספרים החיצונים אלמא הדר ביה רבי דובל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>ספרי לעז וכו.</strong> ברייתא זו סותרת למה שהבאנו לעיל דהיו ספרי לשון הקודש, ספרי היסטוריה ועם ישראל, וספרי ארץ ישראל:<br>\n\"This question does not appear to be about Judaism within the scope defined in the help center.

Since the Torah is infinitely broad and deep, this is impossible, but learning <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishneh_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishne Torah</a> is one way to approach it.</p>\n\n<p>As you know, the Rambam codifies all <em>halachot</em>, both those practiced today and those that will be practiced when the <em>Beit Hamikdash</em> is rebuilt. As such, it is broader than most traditional halachic codes (e.g., Shulchan Aruch, Kitzur SA). The language of the Mishne Torah is also exceptionally clear and structured; its organization makes it easier to remember what is where.</p>\n\n<p>It is for these reasons the last Lubavitcher Rebbe instituted a <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/900030/jewish/Learning-Daily-Rambam-Mishneh-Torah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">daily learning schedule</a> for Mishne Torah</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It gathers all of Jewish law in a concise and clear fashion.

If the first one read three verses, the second one reads the remaining two verses from this paragraph and then one verse from another, i.e., the following, paragraph.

Some people sing whenever they eat or drink, and bubbly water is refreshing and gladdens the spirit and the esophagus. It's something to sing about. And, I know we're allowed to drink soda on all these days except Yom Kippur. (OK, I can understand, then, why it's eliminated then.)</p>\n<p>So what's special about all the other days when we can't sing about soda?</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It's obvious. You should be drinking wine on those days - not soda. As for Erev Yom Kippur, you should be drinking wine then too in order to make the transition from drinking to fasting harder and therefore intensifying the \"inui\" affliction. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Well, we really have to start with the reason why we are always guzzling soda like, well, soda. And the reason is because of what you mentioned, that it gladdens the spirit, and helps us to be happy, as the psalm there continues (verse 2) עִבְד֣וּ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה בְּשִׂמְחָ֑ה, serve Hashem with happiness. That is, we are singing about the soda because it enables us to serve Hashem with joy.</p>\n\n<p>On days when we anyways have joy, there is no need for soda. Therefore, on Shabbos and Yom Tov with the festive meals<sup>1</sup>, and erev Yom Kippur where we are already happy about our upcoming atonement, and on erev Pesach when we get to stuff ourselves with all of the junkfood we can fit into our mouths under the guise of \"getting rid of it before it's too late,\" we don't have to resort to soda to bring us happiness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup> 1 </sup> and on Chol HaMoed Pesach, when we have all of the leftovers that we didn't eat at the seder because we forgot that by the time Shulchan Orech rolls around at 1:38 a.m. no one will be in the mood to eat a whole meal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's because תודה reminds us of סודה, which reminds us of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.9.18?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">founding of Mitzrayim</a>, which is a sad time and not a happy time.  If Mitzrayim had never been founded then an evil Paro would not have arisen to enslave us all, and we would not have been driven down so far that we fell into Mitzrayim's idolatrous ways mere weeks after receiving the torah.  Mitzrayim brought us sorrow and woe, and we do not want to be sad on festive days!  And even on Yom Kippur, we should be reflecting on our own deeds, not Mitzrayim's.</p>\n\n<p>So why is it permitted to sing of soda on other days?  On other days we hear of sadness and evil all the time (at least if we are within range of any news source).  Singing that reminds us of Mitzrayim cannot possibly make things worse on those days; in fact, a little singing about Mountain Dew might distract us and singing of Red Bull might even elevate us.  But don't sing of Sprites, though; that way lies trouble.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is kares a greater punishment than capital punishment, or vice versa?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In many cases (e.g., no warning, no witnesses) a capital crime is not punished by a beis din, but instead the offender gets kares. Let's assume for the purposes of this question that kares includes punishment in the afterlife (and is not only dying before one's time).</p>\n\n<p>Now, from this <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/100204/13680\">answer</a> it almost seems that punishment by the court is <em>better</em> than an afterlife punishment. There we have an offender whose crime is so heinous that he can't get a kapparah through beis din's execution. Presumably, though, he still gets punished in the afterlife. So we see that punishment in the afterlife is a greater punishment, and that that offender wasn't 'deserving' to get the lesser punishment on Earth. Thus here we have kares > capital punishment</p>\n\n<p>But how can this be, if kares is usually given for less severe violations of the same sin? If someone is warned by two witnesses and still blatantly continues doing the sin, that sure seems like a more severe offense than if he did it in private, overcome by his passions. So we really ought to have capital punishment > kares.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Meseches Megillah (daf 22b) says that an Aliya, or a Torah reading, is added every time we add something. For example: from weekdays to Rosh Chodesh, we add mussaf, therefore Rosh Chodesh has 4 Aliya’s while weekdays only have 3. The Gemara then goes on to say: ביום הכיפורים דענוש כרת שישה, שבת דאיכא איסור סקילה שבעה.- on Yom Kippur there are six, because the punishment is kares, while on shabbos there are seven because the punishment is s’kila, one of the capital punishments.\nTherefore capital punishment is a worse punishment (it is “added on” to s’kila)</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I just realized that in Megilla (daf 23a) there is a Tanna who argues and says that on Yom Kippur we read 7 aliyot, and on shabbos we read 6, presumably for the same reasons as above. In the end though, the Halacha is like the first Tanna </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The Gemorrah discusses that explicitly (I'll let others to provide a standard answer). But spiritually, Karet is \"higher\" as it addresses higher parts of the Jewish soul.</p>\n\n<p>I've answered that there #7: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/100212/15579\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/100212/15579</a></p>\n\n<p>Let me explain how my answer is different and even opposed from the standard on (above):</p>\n\n<p>Let me provide you with an analogy, a kid might see a wound that bleeds because it's local but he can't see his leukemia because it's so big for him. For him, the wound is far more severe than leukemia, because it is something he can perceive, he can't fear something he can't perceive.</p>\n\n<p>However, we all know, that leukemia is far more dangerous and lethal than a simple wound and needs far more difficult treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Earthy Beis Din has limited authorities, only to judge the sins that are \"local\" to Nefesh, that can be treated with simply killing the sinner after he atones. He continues straight to Eden or whatever and there's no \"danger\" to his afterlife. </p>\n\n<p>But in case of a more serious sin that affects his Neshama or even higher parts, there's a danger of dying out completely (ונכרתה הנפש ההיא), to be cut out from Hashem completely. And that condition can be treated only by Hashem himself, that's why for us it seems less serious.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For @Yaakovdean, this is similar to what AriZ\"l writes about Tzizis that's מקיף and therefore לית ביה תפיסא. Hence it can be Halachicly \"downgraded\" to a mop when finished, unlike תשמישי קדודה that have perceivable Kedushah.</p>\n\n\n",

A pig can never become <em>tereifa</em>, and its carcass has the same <em>neveila</em> status (with regards to <em>tum'ah</em>) whether it was slaughtered or not.</p>\n\n<p>At most, if we accept that the rationale of <em>shechita</em> is that it's the most humane way to kill an animal, there might be an issue of <em>tzaar baal chai</em> to cause the pig as little pain as possible.  However, IIRC, the blood vessels in a non-kosher animal's neck are situated slightly differently, so <em>shechita</em> might not even accomplish that. </p>\n\n<p>[There is a well-known joke about the Jew who had to partake of pork for health reasons, and insisted it be slaughtered properly and the lungs checked.

When pressed, he responded, \"What can I say, that it's kosher?  It's a pig! It's not kosher, and can never be kosher.  The questioner may eat it, because of <em>pikuach nefesh</em>, regardless of the lung's status.

To replace Moshe.</p>\n<p><strong>Thus, Dummy = your brother = shepherd = Korach.</strong></p>\n<p>Now you might ask why some of these verses appear to use the plural form (e.g. צעקים, רעים) if they are talking about one person, namely Dummy. The answer to that lies in a Talmudic statement in Zevachim 43b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונאמרו קדשים בלשון רבים</p>\n<p>And the holy ones are said in plural form.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And what was Korach's mantra? We find it in Numbers 16:3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל העדה כלם קדשים</p>\n<p>The entire congregation is all holy ones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So of course Korach (Dummy) would be referred to in the plural form!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Baruch Shekivanta!

(Perhaps the common custom nowadays to wear socks under our shoes is meant to be a sign of mourning the Beis HaMikdash.)</p>\n\n<p>What is the reason for this? David HaMelech says further in Tehillim 147:9:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נוֹתֵ֣ן לִבְהֵמָ֣ה לַחְמָ֑הּ לִבְנֵ֥י עֹ֝רֵ֗ב אֲשֶׁ֣ר יִקְרָֽאוּ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Who gives to an animal its bread, to young ravens when they call out?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who, indeed, is it who gives food to young ravens? It must be the Angel of Death, who smites creatures, which the ravens then eat. </p>\n\n<p>“Bread,” of course, is a euphemism for living creatures; as we find in Bereishis 39:6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַלֶּ֖חֶם אֲשֶׁר־ה֣וּא אוֹכֵ֑ל</p>\n  \n  <p>The bread which he eats</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which, as Rashi explains,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הִיא אִשְׁתּוֹ</p>\n  \n  <p>This is [Potiphar’s] wife</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi further notes on Bereishis 37:33:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חיה רעה אכלתהו. [...] סוֹפוֹ שֶׁתִּתְגָּרֶה בוֹ אֵשֶׁת פּוֹטִיפַר.</p>\n  \n  <p>”A wild animal ate him” - [...] His end is that the wife of Potiphar will drag him. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see that Potifar’s wife is a wild animal, and she is called “bread,” so we may deduce that living creatures in general are called “bread.”</p>\n\n<p>Okay, back to the passuk in Tehillim 147. Having established that we’re talking about the Angel of Death, the passuk continues (v. 10):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לֹ֤א בִגְבוּרַ֣ת הַסּ֣וּס יֶחְפָּ֑ץ לֹֽא־בְשׁוֹקֵ֖י הָאִ֣ישׁ יִרְצֶֽה׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Not in the strength of a horse does he desire, nor in the shins of man is he appeased. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Angel of Death doesn’t desire strength, so the practice is to mourn and refrain from many activities. He is not appeased by the shins of man, so the practice is to cover them with socks.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>You ask a hole-y question.

Obviously there’s someone else in the room, who he’s talking about when he uses plural, and this person is probably an enemy, because David asks that ‘he’ not fall into the hand of man (meaning his enemies hand), not that ‘they’ not fall into the hand of man. Since most enemies of the Jews are not Jewish, we can assume that this enemy wasn’t Jewish.\nTherefore, the pasuk can be explained like this: “and David said to God ‘I, David, am in a great strait, let us (both me and my enemy) fall now into the hands of HaShem, and let me not fall into the hands of my enemy.’”<br>\nBecause of the (not Jewish) enemy, who might think that the use of ‘God’ was referring to a different deity, David also used the name HaShem, and didn’t say “your hand”. </p>\n\n<p>The reason why God isn’t counted among the names of HaShem is, like I said before, the name ‘God’ can be confused with other deities, and we don’t want non- Jews thinking that their god is our God.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is no conflict with what Rambam states and what appears in Shmuel II 24:14, which you cite.

In fact, in the posuk cited from Shmuel II, the <em>bri’ach</em> between אל and גד reminds us of Moshe’s staff.</p>\n\n<p>This is a photo of the actual rock which Moshe is purported to have struck at Rephidim.</p>\n\n<p>In the context of the source in Shemot from which we learn about this type of letter transformation, it is also understood why the name changes between <em>HaShem</em> and the 42 letter name of G-d. <em>HaShem</em> was the one who originally revealed this to Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Qlm8p.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Qlm8p.jpg\" alt=\"Horeb Split Rock\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This transformation is used with 4 letter words. The first two letters are multiplied together for one sum, and the second two letters for a second sum. Then the two sums are added together.</p>\n\n<p>In this particular case, the four letter <em>word</em> is formed from <em>אֶל־גָּ֖ד</em>. The <em>bri'ach</em> between the two words consisting of two letters indicates that they are to be considered as a single word.</p>\n\n<p>So by multiplying 30 and 1 (אֶל) the first sum is 30. Multiplying 3 and 4 (גָּ֖ד) gives a second sum of 12. Adding the two together (30 plus 12) gives a result of 42, which alludes to the 42 letter name which was David's actual intention.</p>\n\n<p>Jest saying...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>“God” is not listed as a divine name because of the explicit verse in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1065.htm#11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah (65:11)</a> demonstrating that it is a secular name:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאַתֶּם֙ עֹזְבֵ֣י יְהוָ֔ה הַשְּׁכֵחִ֖ים אֶת־הַ֣ר קָדְשִׁ֑י הַֽעֹרְכִ֤ים לַגַּד֙ שֻׁלְחָ֔ן וְהַֽמְמַלְאִ֖ים לַמְנִ֥י מִמְסָֽךְ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hashem Himself stated that the name “God” is secondary, subservient, secular in regards to divine names. Therefore, David didn’t say “<em>your</em> hand” because he was referring specifically to <em>Hashem’s</em> hand. The plural “נפלה” could easily have been referring to himself and “God”, indicating that all secular manifestations are subjected (“fall”) to Hashem. </p>\n\n\n",

Does this apply to flights on El Al and only through Nefesh B'Nefesh, or would it apply to other airlines or private aliyot as well?</p>\n<p>And why would the third group be the Yisra'elim? If they are Yisra'elim, haven't they already had their Aliyah?</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Well, you really have to start at the root of the Halacha to answer this one.</p>\n<p>The reason that Kohanim go first (and Levi'im second) is because of the Halacha (גיטין נט ע\"ב) of וקדשתו - לכל דבר שבקדושה - that Kohanim go first for all matters of being mekadesh. This would exclude most flights to Israel, where chillul Hashem is happening left, right, and center (just google \"airplane chillul Hashem\" for examples). Therefore, there is no need to let the Kohanim board first, and we can continue the status quo of airplane chillul Hashem by pushing and shoving to get on first. Kohanim should be allowed to board first on trans-European Aliyah train rides.</p>\n<p>In terms of your second question, this is referring to the Mishnah in Yoma (4:5) which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בכל יום, כוהנים עולים במזרחו של כבש, ויורדים במערבו</p>\n<p>Each day, the Kohanim go up the east side of the ramp, and the Yordim are in the West</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The West, as we all know, is the United States. So, on Aliyah trips from the U.S., the Yisra'elim, who had already had their Aliyah but then had Yerida to the West, should board last.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Originally, one person read the Torah for everyone and there was no concept of <em>aliyot</em>. It was only when people fought for the honor to read that the concept of <em>aliyot</em> for Torah reading began.</p>\n\n<p>So, let's apply this to airline boarding. (I infer that's what you mean, but, you may want to edit this in your question.) There's no question that there is a \"hidden fight\" when boarding a plane. People prefer being first because it's easier to move around and get into your seat, and most of all, have space in the overhead bin for the carry on.</p>\n\n<p>But, airlines already have boarding priorities. Disabled, elderly and parents accompanying small children go first. That seems to be the general airline policy on all airlines and on all flights - going to Israel or elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>So, in short, the answer to your question is a \"no\". You can't really change this long-standing airline boarding policy. That's been established long ago, and, personally, I think it's extremely fair. Elderly, disabled and parents with kids definitely need the additional time to board, and they definitely need more space to do it.</p>\n\n\n",

God Himself, the Teacher of the Jewish people, had forgone the honor due Him and took the trouble to guide the people. Rava said: How can these cases be compared? There, with regard to the Holy One, Blessed be He, the world is His and the Torah is His, and therefore He can forgo His honor. By contrast, here, is it his Torah, that the teacher can forgo its honor? Rava then said: Yes, if he studies, it is his Torah, as it is written: “For his delight is the Torah of the Lord, and in his Torah he meditates day and night” (Psalms 1:2). This indicates that at first it is “the Torah of the Lord,” but after he studies, it becomes “his Torah.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rava appears to be teaching us that we are indeed standing up for honour of the Torah, but inasmuch as the Torah \"belongs\" to the Rav, it is within his gift to forego the honour due.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Disclaimer: Joelk has already successfully addressed whether a Talmid Chacham can Mocheil on his Kavod as it is \"His Torah\", I am just here to take issue with the statement quoted that you are standing up for his Torah alone. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemora in Gittin 31b implies that we stand up for the person rather than the just the Torah that he has acquired:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רב הונא ורב חסדא הוו יתבי חליף ואזיל גניבא עלייהו אמר חד לחבריה ניקום מקמיה דבר אוריין \n  הוא א\"ל אידך מקמי פלגאה ניקום<br>\n  Rav Huna and Rav Chisda were sitting and Geniva (name) walked past. One said to the other \"should we stand up for him as he is full of spiritual light i.e Torah.\"<br>\n  The other replied \"How can we stand up in front of someone who argues disrespectfully with Talmidei Chachamim (i.e Mar Zutra who was belittled by Geniva see Gittin 7a)?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed the Tashbeitz 1,146 brings such a conclusion from many citations all over Shas: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.31b.10?lang=he&with=Sefer%20HaTashbetz&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.31b.10?lang=he&with=Sefer%20HaTashbetz&lang2=he</a></p>\n\n<p>So while its true that without the acquisition of Torah we don't stand up for him, we need both Torah and Middos - good attributes, we do not stand up for Torah if not accompanied by good Middos this is a misquote from the Brisker Rov. </p>\n\n\n",

This is indicated by the Gemara's following question and answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והא רב הונא קרי בכהני בשבתות ויו\"ט שאני רב הונא דאפילו רבי אמי ורבי אסי כהני חשיבי דא\"י מיכף הוו כייפי ליה</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Huna read the Kohen aliyah on Shabbos and Yom Tov!

When people say this phrase, they are expressing their wish that the person will make aliya, so to speak, and be buried in Israel. If the person has already been buried, the bracha is still applicable as even the original occurrence of this practice involved exhuming the body and transporting it to Israel.</p>\n\n\n",

Also, if the woman made a condition and cancelled it privately, the condition is cancelled. Therefore, if one betrothed with a condition and then had intercourse with her without remark, or married her without comment, she requires a divorce [if she wishes to marry another man] even though the condition was not fulfilled, for perhaps the condition was cancelled when he had matrimonal relations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So in the case mentioned the woman has given her consent already to get married in spite of the <em>tenai</em> (stipulation) not having been fulfilled. So its up to the man to <em>Mocheil</em> (forgive) the <em>Tenai</em> and then the Kiddushin is valid retroactively. If he does not say anything till entering his house and consumating the marriage together with her, we say he is married <em>Misafeik</em> (Rema). So at some point someone should clarify whether he was Moichel the Tenai of depending the Kiddushin on the value of the coin, and that it does not matter any more as he wants her to remain married to him.</p>\n\n\n",

I found it very interesting. There were four ceremonial wine blessings and everyone drank four cups of wine. (The kids had grape juice.) There was sweet bubbly white, there was Merlot, Cabernet, Syrah. One guy drank port.</p>\n<p>Mealtime was over and the singing began. They explained the first songs were Psalms. But after the fourth cup of wine I think it finally got to them and they started singing silly songs.</p>\n<p>So I'd like to ask about one of those songs. They told me the name was \"Ah, Dear Me\" or something like that, I don't remember exactly, but I think most of the song was in Hebrew.</p>\n<p>However, the refrain of the song, it was repeated many times throughout the song, was: \"Cabernet! Cabernet!\"</p>\n<p>2 times, just like that. After every stanza.</p>\n<p>I understand a drinking song about wine. But why sing about Cabernet? Does it hold more religious significance than the other wines? Or did they sing about all the wines, maybe that was the only one I understood. Maybe if someone explains the whole song it will make more sense.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I don't know what the following means but it's on the bottom of every question so I'm putting it here too:</p>\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously.

At first blush (so to speak), it reads like someone demanding more wine of all sorts of varieties:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ah, dear me, ah, dear me, give me Bordeaux and Merlot; Barbera, Barbera, Nebbiolo, and Merlot, Cabernet, Cabernet; make me Bordeaux and Merlot. </p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://bakerwineshop.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Baker</a>, too, <a href=\"http://gadolng.com/wine\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gadol</a>, too, <a href=\"https://doubleavineyards.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Double</a>, too, give me Bordeaux and Merlot; Barbera, Barbera, Nebbiolo, and Merlot, Cabernet, Cabernet; make me Bordeaux and Merlot. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s several more stanzas, but I think you get the point. It’s not just Cabernet; there’s plenty more to go around. </p>\n\n<p>Why do we sing this at the Seder night? Well, if you remember all the way back to Tu Bishvat, many have a custom to drink four cups of wine, of varying mixtures of white wine and red wine, which correspond to the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/68574/9682\">four worlds</a> discussed in Kabbalah (more on this concept <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/379846/jewish/Tu-BShevat-Basics.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here at Chabad</a>). With this connection of wine to the four worlds, it should become apparent why we sing about wine: at the final part of the Seder, we sing about such lofty concepts as the four worlds through which action is made possible. We can’t describe the worlds in such vivid detail (partly because of the metaphysicality of it, partly because we’re drunk and half asleep), so we use the metaphor of wine and wine merchants instead. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You misunderstood -- they were demanding <em>caberet</em>, surely someone would have gotten up and performed after all of that drinking!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>On second thought, they were in fact cheering for Cabernet. You see, the fourth cup ritually drunk will receive its own after-blessing, which contains the phrase <em>return us to Israel, where we will thank you for the Land and the wine.</em> However if the wine used for that cup is a product of Israel, you say \"for the Land and <strong>its</strong> wine.\" Therefore many prefer to use an Israeli wine for the fourth cup.</p>\n\n<p>By the time they got to \"Ah dear me\", the fourth cup had been drunk; at this point you're not supposed to eat any more food, but you can drink more wine. Having already satisfied the ritual preference for an Israeli wine, they're now asking for something French. And who is better than sighing <em>ah, dear me</em> than the French?!</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, many French Jews will be in Israel for the holiday and then return to France for work, so they were singing about <em>beito b'karov</em>, \"his house is nearby\", as many of them are commuting between Israel and France.</p>\n\n\n",

As the <strong>Mishna in Avot (1.1)</strong> explains seyag latora. The purpose of the fence is to avoid contact with the isur Tora (¹). The Mesilat Yesharim explains that this principle is  demonstrated in one of the mitzvot of the Tora, Nazir. He cannot eat grapes, or vine leaves because of they are related with wine. The Tora gives an example of gader to help Sages how to make fences, or at least an example of personal fences, that are an other topic.</p>\n\n<p>Porets gader is one who isn't afraid about isur Tora and he thinks he can avoid alone isure Tora. And he doesn't follow Sages. E.g. Gemara in AZ 27b states that Minut (a seductive theory of kfira, dangerous for Jews) is so dangerous that it's prohibited to get help by a doctor who is Min, or treat with Minut. If one treats himself with such a doctor, a \"Snake Derabanan\" will bite him. Its bite is treatment resistent. Note that some rishonim understand that the curse is extended to all mitzvot derabanan as blessings derabanan for food or other berachot derabanan (²). source describing this curse is the verse in Kohelet quoted by the OP.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(¹): Rambam comment Avot 1, 1.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>..ועשו סייג לתורה. ר\"ל הגזירות והתקנות אשר ירחיקו האדם מן העבירות כמו שאמר יתברך ושמרתם משמרתי ונאמר בפירושו עשו משמרת למשמרתי: ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Seyag (fence). Decrets of sages that keep away people from sins as says g-d in the verse, \"to keep my guard\" and sages interpreted you need to make a fence around my fence. (loose translation).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabenu Yona there.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א׳:א׳\n  ועשו סייג לתורה. כענין שנאמר (ויקרא י\"ח ל') ושמרתם את משמרתי כלומר עשו משמרת למשמרתי. והסייג הוא דבר גדול ומשובח לעשות סייג וגדר למצות לבל יוכל להכשל בהם הירא את דבר ה'. לכן המקיים את דברי חז\"ל שהם סייגים למצות של תורה חיבב היראה ממי שעושה המצוה עצמה כי אין עשיית המצות הוכחה ליראה כמו השומר לסייגים שהוא נזהר מתחלה שלא יביא לידי פשיעה. <strong>אך העושה המצוה ואינו מקיים הסייג מראה לנו כי אם ייטיב בעיניו לעשות מצוה אל ירע בעיניו אם יפשע בה ולפרוץ פרץ לא חש מפני היראה ופורץ גדר ישכנו נחש</strong>.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Who makes mitzvah and not the fence show that he is not afraid to fall and does sin, breaking is not a preoccupation for him, One who breaks a fence should be bitten by a snake\n  For instance the term is used in masechet Nidda several times. See Rashi Nidda 3.2</p>\n  \n  <p>סייג. חזוק וגדר מדרבנן לטמא למפרע</p>\n  \n  <p>(For a woman who find blood when checking herself, to view herself unclean retroactively ...)

Moses Isserles</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והמדקדקים מתחילים מיד במוצאי י\"כ בעשיית הסוכה כדי לצאת ממצוה אל מצוה</p>\n<p>And the careful ones begin making the <em>succah</em> immediately at the termination of Yom Kippur, so as to go from one <em>mitzvah</em> to another <em>mitzvah</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2987\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 625:1</a> (the very next <em>se'if</em>) he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומצוה לתקן הסוכה מיד לאחר יום כפור דמצוה הבאה לידו אל יחמיצנה</p>\n<p>And it is a <em>mitzvah</em> to fix the <em>succah</em> immediately after Yom Kippur, because a <em>mitzvah</em> that comes to his hand he should not let go stale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to simply be a restatement of what was just said earlier, albeit worded differently. Why does R. Isserles need to repeat the same law twice in a row?</p>\n<p>I am aware that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Meir_Kagan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Israel Meir Kagan</a> addressed this in his commentary thereto (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49628&st=&pgnum=168\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 625:2</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף דכבר כתבו לעיל בסוף סימן תרכ\"ד התם בלילה התחלה בעלמא ולמחרת מתקן כולה אם אפשר גם שם איירי לענין מדקדק במעשיו יתחיל דבר מה בסוכה מיד בלילה ומי שאין מדקדק עכ\"פ ביום המחרת אחר יציאה מביהכ\"נ יתחיל ויגמור כולה אם אפשר ואפילו הוא ע\"ש עד חצות ואחר זה י\"ל דאסור</p>\n<p>Even though they already wrote this above, at the end of Siman 624, there [it was referring to] a mere beginning [of building the <em>succah</em>] at night, and fixing it entirely the next day if possible. Also, there it was dealing with one who is careful in his actions – <em>he</em> should start some amount of [building] the succah immediately at night. And one who is not careful should at least start and complete it entirely the next day after leaving the synagogue if possible. And even if it is Friday [he should build it] until noon, but after this some say that it is forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He seems to be suggesting two possible reasons for the repetition:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first statement was talking about starting that very night, while the second statement was talking about completing it the next day.</li>\n<li>The first statement was talking about an extra pious person beginning immediately that night, while the second statement was talking about a regular person building it the next day.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Neither of these suggestions seem to really fit, though. In both statements R. Isserles gives the time frame of immediately after Yom Kippur. It doesn't seem like that would refer to the next day. Additionally, if there were two different points, that still wouldn't explain the need for two separate statements. He could have simply written one statement encompassing both points, e.g. \"one should start that night and complete it the next day\" or \"a pious person should build it that night and a regular person should at least build it the next day\". Moreover, in R. Isserles's commentary to the Tur (Darchei Moshe) from which his rulings in Shulchan Aruch are distilled, he mentions this law at the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2712\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">end of Siman 624</a> and then in the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2713\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">beginning of Siman 625</a> he says to refer back to the end of Siman 624 to see that it's a <em>mitzvah</em> to start building the <em>succah</em> right away – implying that the two statements are conveying the same idea.</p>\n<p>So how can we explain R. Isserles's repetition?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <em>Darkei Moshe</em> (625) has an additional phrase which is not present in <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, which I believe will shed some light on this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומיד לאחר י״ה יעשה הסוכה <strong>ואפי׳ אם הוא ע״ש</strong> דמצוה הבא לידו אל יחמצנה</p>\n<p>And immediately after Yom Kippur he should make the <em>succah</em>, <strong>even if it is <em>erev shabbat</em></strong>, because a mitzvah that comes to his hand he should not let go stale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here we can see that the second statement is referring to the next day.</p>\n<p>The first statement (which is also referenced at the beginning of 625, but not the main focus there) is referring to the night immediately following Yom Kippur, as is indicated by the phrase \"במוצאי י\"כ\", which is not found in the second statement.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Could a secular marriage contract conceivably be considered a shtar kiddushin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Suppose a secular Jewish couple got civilly married- <strong>no halachik ceremony</strong>- and they get their marriage license. Could this marriage license serve as a Halachik <em>Shtar</em>, ie they'd need a <em>Get</em> if they wanted a divorce?<br />\n(<strong>please scroll to the bottom for an example of a secular marriage license</strong>)</p>\n<p>Initially I thought \"No way! Of course this wouldn't be a valid <em>shtar</em>! Where are the <strong>witnesses</strong>, and the <em>shtar</em> wasn't written <em><strong>l'shma</strong></em>!\"</p>\n<p>However after taking a look at the Shulchan Aruch where <em>kiddushin</em> via a <em>shtar</em> is discussed (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.32.1-4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even Haezer 32:1-4</a>), I'm not so convinced. Allow me to explain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>problem of no witnesses</strong>-<br />\nThe gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.3b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 3b</a> teaches us a we need <em>sh'nei eidim</em> (two witnesses) for the <em>kiddushin</em> to be valid. We see in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.32.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even Haezer 32:4</a> that:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתבו בכתב ידו <strong>ואין עליו עד מקודשת מספק</strong> (נ\"י פ\"ד אחין) ינתן לה שטר ואמר לה ע\"מ שהנייר שלי אינה מקודשת (הר\"ן פ\"ק דקדושין):</p>\n<p>If he wrote it in his hand <strong>and there are no witnesses on it she is questionably engaged</strong> (Nimukei Yosef the Chapter of Four Brothers). If he gave her a document and said, on the condition that the paper remains mine she is not engaged (Ran First Chapter of Kiddushin).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-if there are no witnesses she's \"<strong>questionably engaged</strong>\"... that doesn't sound like a \"no\" to me.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>problem of not being l'shma</strong>-\nThe gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.9a.13-9b.2?lang=bi&with=Shulchan%20Arukh,%20Even%20HaEzer&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 9a-9b</a> teaches us a that <em>shtar kiddushin</em> must be written l'shma. We see in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.32.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even Haezer 32:1</a> that:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וצריך שיכתוב אותו <strong>לשם האשה</strong> המתקדשת כמו בגט</p>\n<p>And he must write it <strong>for the woman</strong> he is getting engaged to like with a Get.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-What's to say what qualifies as \"<em>l'shma</em>?\" Maybe calling the marriage office and indicating he wants a marriage license for him and his wife could be considered enough to meet the requirement of \"<em>l'shma</em>\" ie \"<strong>for the woman</strong>\"!</p>\n<p><strong>So...</strong></p>\n<p>Obviously not something one should do <em>l'chatchilah</em>, but could a secular marriage contract potentially serve as valid <em>shtar Kiddushin</em>?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>For reference: A sample NYC marriage licence:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3sMpu.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3sMpu.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Even if there were Kosher witnesses and the bridegroom intend to <em>mekadesh</em> the bride, if the <em>Shtar Kidushin</em> was written by a <em>Nochri</em> a like a civil marriage, it is an invalid Kiddushin, as the questioner stated we need <em>Kesiva Lishma</em> Even Haezer 32,1. This is assuming the civil marriage document itself is worth less than a <em>shave Pruta</em> (for everyone else and cannot be substituted as a monetary kiddushin <em>Shave kesef</em> )*.<br>\nThe Gemara Gittin 23a says a <em>Nochri</em> writes autonimously and will on purposely not have in mind to think about the wedded woman when writing her name so there is no Kesiva Lishma and the Gett/Kiddushin is invalid:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בעינן כתיבה לשמה והא ודאי עובד כוכבים אדעתיה דנפשיה קעביד       </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Note if he says that the woman is <em>Mekudeshet</em> to him with the civil marriage she is <em>Safeik Mekudeshet</em> (questionably married) and requires a <em>Gett</em> (Halachik Divorce) as stated in Shulchan Aruch Even Haezer 32,2 because the paper might be worth a Pruta elsewhere in the world and might be valid as <em>Kidushei Shave Kesef</em>. So since we are not sure, she needs a new Kidushin to get married or if she changes her mind she needs a Divorce.</p>\n\n\n",

A few examples:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The going rate for a soccer match back in the day was 400 silver coins, as the Torah states: ארבע מאות שקל כסף עובר ל<strong>שוכר</strong> - Bereishis 23:16 - \"400 shekels was the going rate for a soccer match\"</li>\n<li>Rambam delineates 13 principles of faith.

The story is told of the wife of Manoach to whom an angel appeared to inform her that she was going to have a child and to instruct her that the child would be a nazir. At the end of the story, Manoach asks the angel what his name is. He responds \"והוא פלאי\", which means \"My name is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pel%C3%A9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pelé</a>\", one of the greatest soccer players of all time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>It seems that in this particular instance, they were playing a giant game of checkers.</p>\n<p>One of the teams' colors was red (Exodus 32:7):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר ה' אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֑ה לֶךְ־רֵ֕ד</p>\n<p>God spoke to Moses, \"Go to red!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They had already gotten quite far in the game, because many of them already had been kinged (33:6):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּֽתְנַצְּל֧וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל אֶת־עֶדְיָ֖ם</p>\n<p>And the Children of Israel took off their crowns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>God was quite upset about this game because this is one of two games he dislikes in particular (Psalms 101:7):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹֽא־יֵשֵׁ֨ב ׀ בְּקֶ֥רֶב בֵּיתִי֮ עֹשֵׂ֢ה רְמִ֫יָּ֥ה דֹּבֵ֥ר שְׁקָרִ֑ים לֹֽא־יִ֝כּ֗וֹן לְנֶ֣גֶד עֵינָֽי</p>\n<p>One who does rummy will not sit in my house; one who speaks of checkers will not stand in front of me!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Jewish people needed not fear when they left Egypt, since they practiced Karate, as it says (Chagai 2:5):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֶת-הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר-כָּרַתִּי אִתְּכֶם, בְּצֵאתְכֶם מִמִּצְרַיִם, ... אַל-תִּירָאוּ.</p>\n<p>Because of that which you had Karate with you when you left Egypt ... have no fear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As a case in point, sibling incest is described in the Torah as חסד. R' Dessler (Michtav M'Eliyahu vol. 2 pages 165) describes that Yishmael had the Middah of חסד not tempered by גבורה, and it was חסד taken to its illegitimate extreme in which it is a negative force. The חסד that Hashem does for us is purely positive.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>חסד can be short-sighted</strong>. For example, if I do my son's math homework for him every night, he can spend more time playing. But when he fails his math test, my \"חסד\" won't be so helpful.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Siach Yitzchok seems to take this approach - on the phrase in question, his comment is \"תכליתם טוב\", that Hashem's חסד is ultimately good and leads to only good.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>חסד, even from Hashem, can be detrimental. Rabbeinu Peretz in his Maareches HaElokus writes that had Yitzchok followed in the path of his father and worked further on the Middah of חסד, the resulting shift of Hashem's חסד in His relationship with the world would have unbalanced the scales of justice, nullified the existence of retribution, and reduced the opportunity for Avodas Hashem, for which the world was created.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This concept is pretty common, that even the good deeds have to have a good measure - too much good for people and you spoil them, for example:</p>\n<p>The Torah says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.32?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dvorim 32</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"חֶמְאַת בָּקָר וַחֲלֵב צֹאן עִם־חֵלֶב כָּרִים וְאֵילִים בְּנֵי־בָשָׁן וְעַתּוּדִים עִם־חֵלֶב כִּלְיוֹת חִטָּה וְדַם־עֵנָב תִּשְׁתֶּה־חָמֶר׃ <strong>וַיִּשְׁמַן יְשֻׁרוּן וַיִּבְעָט</strong> שָׁמַנְתָּ עָבִיתָ כָּשִׂיתָ וַיִּטֹּשׁ אֱלוֹהַ עָשָׂהוּ וַיְנַבֵּל צוּר יְשֻׁעָתוֹ׃</p>\n<p>\"Curd of kine and milk of flocks; With the best of lambs, And rams of Bashan, and he-goats; With the very finest wheat— And foaming grape-blood was your drink.

Had it been written: “I shall make man,” we would not\n  have learned that He was speaking with His tribunal, but to Himself.\n  And the refutation to the heretics is written alongside it [i. e., in\n  the following verse:]“And God created (וַיִּבְרָא) ,” and it does not\n  say,“and they created וַיִּבְרְאוּ.” - [from Gen.

Selem does not mean a shape because G-d does not have shape. G-d does not have corporeality (tzelem). People are not made in the “image” of G-d in terms of likeness but in intellect. </p>\n\n<p>The Talmud exclaims that G-d always consults His angel before he does anything in the Creation. How can an all-powerful G-d be unsure? Why is the plural used in this verse? Genesis verses 1:26 states, “Let us make man in our demut. Verse 1:27 relates that “God made man in His tzelem, in the tzelem of God, He made him.”</p>\n\n<p>The (selem) denotes natural form which comprises the essence of reality and that is man's intelligence. </p>\n\n<p>Plato's Timaeus quotes a sage, \"The Holy One, blessed be he, as it were, does nothing without contemplating the host above.\" Does G-d contemplate?  Rambam interprets it to mean that \"G-d contemplates the intellects,\" and what comes into existence emanates.  The sage says that G-d \"does nothing without consulting the host above.\" Is something \"above\" G-d?  The rabbinic dicta convey the idea that G-d works through angels. Maimonides equates angels with natural forces because G-d is not a Pasha surrounded by servants that carry out the Pasha's commands. G-d has no need for assistants. Thus, Rambam says G-d works from natural forces. This is why we must study nature. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, G-d is not consulting angels but He is consulting nature (metaphorically). </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How did Adam receive his knowledge and what he knew?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The tradition says that Adam was created grown up and extremely intelligent. We know that his body was formed from the earth and his soul was blown into the body and then he became a living (talking) soul.</p>\n<p>It would immensely help me to know the following, to reconcile various commentaries on Genesis. Do our sources reveal the details of his intelligence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>was his knowledge of the world imprinted or<br />\nwas he taught by God or angels?</li>\n<li>what exactly did he know and not know about the world?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The general concept found all over the place in our sources (e.g. Chesed LeAvraham Maayan 4:5), is that Adam is a speaking being, that's his essence. He derives speech from the Yud in Hashem's Name, which corresponds to Chochma. From Chochma arise 32 intellectual pathways, which is the foundation of Adam's intellect.</p>\n<p>Now, you ask about knowledge. What did he <em>know</em>? As far as I know, the main source for addressing this question is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Vayeshev.4.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this midrash</a>, which explains that Adam knew about the Torah, and about the material world that includes death, and indeed knew that Hashem intended for him to descend to it one way or another.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/3140460/jewish/page.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chassidus fleshes this out</a> by saying that Adam and Chava knew that Hashem's plan involved us partnering with Him, in order that this lowest world should also be a place of holiness and Godliness - a place where Hashem's Essence would belong, comfortably. It adds that Hashem didn't exactly explain it in full to them, but rather wanted them to volunteer for the job, and gave them enough clues and intelligence to figure it out - which they did.</p>\n<p>We can see from this that Adam and Chava's knowledge at birth was selective. They knew Lashon Hakodesh, yes but not the names of animals. We can surmise that Hashem taught them whatever limited knowledge He deemed fit, and no more, and taught them in a similar way that parents teach children, who also start by <em>knowing</em> nothing.</p>\n<p>As for why Adam was not \"smart enough\" to figure out certain things, we can only speculate, but it seems obvious that \"smarts\" and \"knowledge\" have to work together. Einstein figured out relativity with his \"smarts\", because he <em>knew</em> more than the smart people that came before him, who couldn't have worked it out. We do know that Adam was smart enough to realise that none of the animals could fulfil the need, but only when he knew about Chava could he \"figure out\" that she was the one...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Garden of Eden story is one of the most fantastical and hardest to understand. I don't believe that any major commentator takes the story at face value, it's always interpreted allegorically and then you have to ask other allegorical questions. We say God made Adam unique as a talking being, and yet I believe the snake talks more than Adam in the story.</p>\n<p>Here is my interpretation and I hope it answers your question. I believe the narrator is trying to give you the following impression/premise to the story:</p>\n<p>Life is very simple now, the whole world is made but we are going to talk about a garden with all its animals. Everything grows easily, and so mankinds job is to tend/protect the garden, and all their food grows for them. No one is allowed to eat each other, both humans and animals are commanded a vegetarian diet. EVERYONE appears to be talking and figuring things out, Adam names animals, animals and Adam figure out whether they'd be good mates for each other (spoilers: they aren't). But so far everyone in the story has a simple easy life, there are no struggles, and any talking is about pretty simple topics.</p>\n<p>And for the commentators who say that Adam spoke Hebrew, and really understands Hebrew, I would argue the opposite:</p>\n<p>Genesis 2:23</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כג  וַיֹּאמֶר, הָאָדָם, זֹאת הַפַּעַם עֶצֶם מֵעֲצָמַי, וּבָשָׂר\nמִבְּשָׂרִי; לְזֹאת יִקָּרֵא אִשָּׁה, כִּי מֵאִישׁ לֻקְחָה-זֹּאת.     23\nAnd the man said: 'This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my\nflesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most of us with a simple understanding of Hebrew see nothing wrong with Adam's statement. It seems nice and is a good d'rash we would hear from the podium. The problem is that Adam is <em><strong>wrong.</strong></em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Probably the earliest \"modern\" commentator that I could find who dealt\nwith the issue was Shadal. He wrote:</p>\n<p>\"Moses recorded these words as they were pronounced in his time, even though ishah was not actually derived from ish, but rather from\nenash, which became enesh (as gevar became gever), yielding the plural\nanashim, as well as the feminine form inshah, which became ishah. The\nword ish, however, has been preserved in its original form.\"</p>\n<p>Now while I'm generally willing to explore any resource in order to\nfind the history of words on this site, I was a little nervous going\nforward here. I needed to present an \"unbelievable\" etymology, and it\nseems to contradict a verse in the Torah! And from conversations with\nfriends, I had the feeling that my \"modern\" commentators weren't going\nto cut it.</p>\n<p>So I was relieved when I found that the Radak in his Sefer HaShorashim\n(entry אנש) wrote that:</p>\n<p>ואפשר שתהיה אשה מזה השרש והדגש לחסרון הנו\"ן והראוי אנשה</p>\n<p>\"And it is possible that isha is from this root (אנש) and the dagesh is due to the missing nun, and it is properly אנשה\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.balashon.com/2008/10/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.balashon.com/2008/10/</a></p>\n<p>Lots of religious people will try to explain away this problem because \"God/Torah can't be wrong,\" but I don't see a problem with saying Adam can be wrong. Adam who is learning to talk with his wife and all the animals can make mistakes in understanding where language comes from. Ishah does <em>sound</em> like it comes from Ish, the only way you know it's from a different root is from seeing how Ishah is written.</p>\n<p>I would say the story represents Adam as having a rudimentary knowledge of a spoken language. He can't write the language, he doesn't seem to know the history of the language or its roots. In fact, he doesn't seem to be able to speak his language any better than the animals in the story.</p>\n\n\n",

In his opinion, lo Tov means that it could be better at this point, but that originally Adam's creation was good. He lists them in his commentary, linked above.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא טוב היות האדם לבדו. ואין כוונתו לאמור שבהיות האדם לבדו אין טובה כלל שהלא בראו יחידי, ואין השכל נותן שברא דבר המשולל כל טוב, אלא היותו יחידי בראשונה היתה לטובתו מכמה בחינות:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Chizkuni seems to understand that G-d originally created Adam with the intention of also creating an Ezer Kenegdo, but that it only happened now. Therefore, we can say that it was called good before, since \"stage 1\" of the two-step operation was complete, but that it was still not finished.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא טוב היות האדם לבדו – מתחילה עלה בדעת{ו} לעשות לו זוג, ולא מצא פתח לעשות עד לאחר קריאת השמות, כדי שיתאוה לה ויחבבנה יותר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is similarly expressed by Shadal:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא טוב היות האדם לבדו – אין הכוונה לומר שהאל נמלך ממחשבתו, אלא המכוון הוא להעיר אותנו על יקרת הזווג, ולהודיע כי לא טוב היות האדם לבדו, ולפיכך רצה הקב״ה שיהיה האדם שרוי שעה אחת בלא אשה ואח״כ הזמינה לו כדי שתהיה חביבה עליו אחר שהרגיש כי בזולתה היה חסר, ומזה ילמדו גם הדורות הבאים כי לא טוב היות האדם לבדו. ותלמידי מוהר״ר איגל מוסיף כי מה שכתוב לא טוב וגו׳ אינו אלא כאומר שעדיין לא נשלמה כוונת הבורא בבריאת האדם, כי אחר בריאת כל דבר כתוב וירא אלהים כי טוב, שנעשה רצונו, וכאן לא נעשה עדיין רצונו, כי מעולם לא היה רצונו שיהיה האדם יחידי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch suggests that this took place prior to the creation of man altogether:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר ה׳ אלקים – לפני בריאת האדם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is similarly expressed by Rav DZ Hoffman:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משום כך נברא האדם תחילה לבדו, כדי שירגיש את הצורך בעזר זה. ומשום כך אומר האלהים ״לא טוב״, כלומר אין הבריאה שלמה עדיין (רק אחרי השלמת הבריאה אומר ״והנה טוב מאד״).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also the approach of very many Rishonim who understand this to have taken place earlier (meaning, this is a detailed retelling of the creation of Adam), and therefore write that God never called Adam \"Tov\" before Chava was created, see Rabbeinu Bachya for example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הזכיר עד עתה בכל אחד מהם כי טוב לפי שהטוב הוא הקיום בכל המינין אבל בבריאת אדם שאין המין יכול להתקיים בו לבדו אמר לא טוב.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There are places where they call braiding hair <em>binyata</em>. (<em>And that is what is meant by <strong>vayiven</strong></em>). Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: Do you think that He brought her to him under a carob or under a sycamore? (<em>i.e. with no adornment</em>). It was only after He adorned her with twenty-four types of ornaments (See Isaiah 3:18–24) that He brought her to him. That is what is written: “You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your <em>canopy</em>: Ruby, topaz…” (Ezekiel 28:13).\nThe Rabbis and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, the Rabbis said: There were ten [canopies], (i.e. <em>there are ten precious items listed in the aforementioned Ezekiel verse</em>) and Rabbi Shimon said: Eleven. [This is because] Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, both of them say: When there is a generalization followed by details, the generalization is meant to add on something to the details, so that the word “every” is also included. (<em>i.e. it is intended to add one more item to those listed explicitly</em>). “Every precious stone was your canopy” is the generalization; “Ruby, topaz and clear quartz, beryl…” are the details, and the word “every” is included: “Every precious stone was your canopy.” (<em>i.e. this is why Rabbi Shimon said there were eleven canopies</em>).</p>\n<p>Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Simon, one said: There were nine [canopies], and one said: Ten. The one who said ten, it is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. (<em>i.e. in the previous paragraph</em>). The one who says that there were nine, [this is because] the gold mentioned here (<em>i.e. it is the final item on the list</em>) is not one of the canopies. (<em>rather, it was given to Adam to put to his own use</em>).  Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: He made the [canopy’s] walls of gold and the roofing of gems and pearls. Rabbi Elazar bar Bisena said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: He even made hooks of gold for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Midrash speaks of many canopies (<em>succos</em>, <em>chupos</em>) out of precious stones and gold. However it appears from the commentary <em>Yafeh Toar</em> that some commentators attribute these canopies only to king Chiram (Rashi) and some consider that just like Chiram had <em>chupos</em> so did Adam haRishon.</p>\n\n\n",

Those aren't the same - \"a river flows out of Eden to water the Garden\" (Bereishis 2:10), and Chazal point out that no human eye has ever seen Eden (Berachos 34b, Sanhedrin 99a). (2) Chazal also state (Pesachim 94a, Taanis 10a) that the entire world is 1/60 of the Garden, which in turn is 1/60 of Eden. True that such expressions aren't necessarily literal, it would still mean that the Garden (let alone Eden) is pretty big.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>\"Adam and Chava didn't have anything important to do, after all, they weren't positively commanded on doing anything\": what about לעבדה ולשמרה?

[Later edit: thanks to an anonymous user for pointing it out - Zohar 1:27a, לְעָבְדָהּ בְּפִקּוּדִין דְּעֲשֵׂה וּלְשָׁמְרָהּ בְּפִקּוּדִין דְּלֹא תַעֲשֶׂה.] In Bereishis Rabbah 16:5 it does bring one opinion that they refer to working during the six weekdays and keeping Shabbos, and another that they refer to the korbanos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -7)\n\n<p>Where was Adam in the garden when the snake tempted Eve (Chava)? Nowhere. Because the temptation of Eve never happened.[1]</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, how could Chava be fooled or cheated by a snake when they can't actually speak? We know that animals do not speak because it is contrary to the nature of things. A breach in the laws of nature. The truth is: natural law is fixed and needs no change. To suggest otherwise is arrogance in claiming that they alone know better than the Creator. As empirical observations well tell you, animals simply do not possess highly evolved language skills nor the complexity of writing. How then, should we reinterpret the Bible, especially Genesis? It was a parable. Which is to say that animals do not have the same kind of vocal cords as humans. At best parrots can talk, but they only go by repetition and cannot produce sentence structures on their own. What then, is the metaphor?</p>\n\n<p>The \"Garden of Eden\" story is about morality and intelligence, and the duty and obligation to develop one's intelligence. It is certainly a mitzvah, one in which the Torah expects us to observe. Verbal intelligence is the tzelem Elohim, “the image (or, form) of G-d,” often mistaken to be the soul, (or in Hebrew שפנ). </p>\n\n<p>Genesis 2:7 reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The L-rd G-d formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a nefesh chayah.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Onkelos does not render this simply as “a living being,” but characterizes this as man's ruach m’mal’la, “one with the power of speech,” a phrase denoting a certain level of intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>Since G-d does not emit evil it is inconceivable to image that G-d would produce or create \"dark forces\" such as Satan or malevolent talking serpents (snakes) to manipulate or distort the creation of the world in which the Bible calls \"Very good.\" In fact, it would be an insult to G-d and His Torah, G-d forbid, if people were to read the text in a literal fashion, promoting secularist to mock religion. Indeed the Zohars call such a person a fool.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, the Mishnah Hagigah 2:1 states: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Whoever has no regard for the honor (kevod) of his creator is worthy of not having come into the world.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In his commentary to the Mishnah, Maimonides explains “the honor of his creator”: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“This means whoever has no regard for his intellect, for the intellect is the glory of G-d.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus the lack of use of one's intelligence when decerning these matters would be anti-religious and certainly not pious. G-d desires that we use our intellection and our five senses when reading scripture. In short, to do otherwise would be akin to one who commits intellectual suicide since our intelligence is, in essence, the only thing that separates us from animals, \"an image of G-d.\"</p>\n\n<p>[1] It is worth mentioning here that Adam and Eve most certainly did exist but that they had a mother and a father like you and me. </p>\n\n\n",

That being said, is lying for the sake of Hashem and to promote a positive life change for a fellow Jew considered a positive act? Or does it tarnish the act by establishing it on a foundation of lies?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A Jew should tell the truth, as the Torah writes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.23.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 23:7</a>): \"stay away from falsehood\". There is a small list of situations where one might \"dance around the truth\" to e.g., promote peace, practice humility (e.g., arguing one doesn't know something) or to protect someone from embarrassment. See a good list <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1049008/jewish/Telling-the-Truth-and-When-It-Is-Permissible-to-Be-Less-Than-Honest.htm#footnoteRef8a1049008\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> including limitations of this approach. Note lying to promote an observant lifestyle or to \"help Hashem\" is <strong>not</strong> on the list.</p>\n\n<p>So Hashem doesn't need our lies to promote a religious lifestyle. However one might need to learn to appreciate the benefits of increased observance so one can describe them. Noticing those and speaking about them should be enough without the need to resort to lies. In a small but powerful book (<a href=\"https://menuchapublishers.com/products/what-s-the-purpose\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What's the Purpose?</a>) based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Chaim_Luzzatto\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramchal</a> and R <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dessler</a>, R Hillel Rotenberg lists a number of them</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Faith in the master of universe endows a person with a feeling of calm.

I hope the above doesn't come across as \"preachy\" - it was not the intent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is no doubt that being observant benefits one's life tremendously. For example, if one properly observes Shabbos (Shabbat), one is free of stress. All enterprising activity is considered completed.  There is nothing further to do during Shabbat.  It becomes a time for family, relaxation and Torah. Mundane pursuits no longer matter. Shabbat is similar to embarking on a journey at sea. [Kohelet Rabba 1:36]. Once the land disappears, so does the possibility of involvement with all the uncompleted tasks left behind. Everything will have to wait until one returns. Further, upon returning, somehow the tasks left behind are not quite as critical as they seemed before the journey.\nHowever, if one just became observant, or if one never learned to block out weekday distractions, Shabbat is not going to be a delight, but may even feel confining, where one struggles with feeling compelled to wash a car, fix a cabinet, buy shoes, research a new investment, text an acquaintance, or any other one of a myriad of tasks that are beckoning.\nTherefore, unless one has reached the level of appreciation that Torah observance brings, it is absolutely wrong to pretend otherwise, for at least eight reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Mitzvah habah b’avayra.  If one transgresses in order to perform a mitzvah, it is considered as though the mitzvah is not accomplished. [Suca 30a].</li>\n<li>Ayn omrim chayt kday sheyizke chavayro.  One may not transgress in order to confer merit on his friend. [Shabbos 4a].</li>\n<li>If one does not notice an improvement in an obvious way, saying that it did, is lying.  Falsehood is measured by an objective standard [Shavuos 39a]. </li>\n<li>At the same time, stating that one has not actually noticed a difference, should also not be said. Such a comment would be from a unripe perspective, before developing appreciation. It is not well thought out and needlessly discouraging. Observance by itself, is not an ends, but a means. The mitzvos would not be given, but for people to be refined by them. [Bereshis Rabba, 44:1].\nObservance often begins with ulterior motives, i.e, shlo lishma. The purity of intent comes later. As the Talmud states in several places, “A person should always engage in Torah and mitzvos, even shlo lishma, because out of (observing) shlo lishma, one will eventually (observe) lishma.” [Berachos 17a; Pesachim 50b; Sanhedrin 105a; Arachin 16b; Nazir 23b; Sota 22b, 47a; Horayos 10b].</li>\n<li>It is prohibited to mislead any human being. [Berachos 9a; Chulin 94a].</li>\n<li>This is the punishment of a liar: Even when he speaks truthfully, nobody listens to him. [Sanhedrin 89b].</li>\n<li>Kiruv (drawing another close) is not one of the very few exceptions for slightly altering one’s words. [Bava Metzia 23b].</li>\n<li>Last but not least, pretending to have a superior lifestyle is the essence of hypocrisy. One who steals a measure of wheat, grinds it, bakes it and pronounces a blessing over it, is not a blessing, but revilement. [Bava Kamma 94a].</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Thus, the differences between the date of Daylight Savings Time in different countries depend on which countries merit more or less punishment. This is part of the judgment decided on Rosh Hashana:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מִי יָנוּחַ וּמִי יָנוּעַ<br>\n  מִי יִשָּׁלֵו וּמִי יִתְיַסָּר<br>\n  מִי יִשָּׁפֵל וּמִי יָרוּם</p>\n  \n  <p>Who will rest and who will have to move,<br>\n  Who will have peace and who will be bothered,<br>\n  Who will lie down and who will get up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is why the sound of an early alarm clock is considered a symbol of God's retribution (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.66.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 66:6</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ק֤וֹל <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שָׁעוֹן֙ מֵעִ֔יר</a> ק֖וֹל מֵהֵיכָ֑ל ק֣וֹל יְהֹוָ֔ה מְשַׁלֵּ֥ם גְּמ֖וּל לְאֹיְבָֽיו׃</p>\n  \n  <p>The sound of the Wakening Clock, the sound from a chamber, the sound of God punishing his enemies!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The word קוֹל is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rosh_Hashanah.25a.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">repeated three times</a> to teach: <strong><em>sound</em></strong>, even if you're tired, <strong><em>sound</em></strong>, even if you need more sleep, <strong><em>sound</em></strong>, even if school/work doesn't start for another hour anyway!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the U.S. (I can't vouch for what occurs in countries other than U.S. and Israel. That includes not understanding what occurs in Canada, which is my northern border neighbor.) the change is decided by Agudat Yisra'el. They base it on a combination of what would be a \"reasonable\" vasikin and hashkama minyan time for most people in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, here are the primary factors:</p>\n\n<p>There are people who like davening <em>vatikin</em> - i.e. the goal is to begin saying the Amidah exactly at sunrise. It doesn't matter when sunrise is - these people want to be there. Others, like the hashkamah minyan. These minyanim tend to start at a fixed time, say 6 AM. They are mainly geared for commuters who are on a tight schedule to, say get a train or a ride that leaves at a specific time - same schedule each day. (You can see that the goals and focuses of vasikin and hashkama are very different.)</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that getting the best time frame is challenging. Daylight time pushes sunrise ahead an hour, thus making vasikin \"later\" than it was. If vasikin starts at 7 AM, you're probably going to get all those people moving to hashkama and you won't have enough for a vasikin minyan. On the other hand, there's also a minimal time when you are allowed to daven shacharit. So, if you made daylight time too early in the winter making sunrise at 8 AM, the 6 AM hashkama minyan couldn't run either, so everyone would have to shlep their tallit / tefillin to work and either daven by themselves or lose time from work to find a minyan near work - not that likely for many people.</p>\n\n<p>In short, they have to find some proper balance to accomodate both forms of minaynim to make the majority of the population in Jewish cities in the U.S. happy. So, the scheduling seems to be based on a best average of the times needed in the U.S. to do it. That's why they determined the 2nd Sunday in March to be the best time in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>I'll have to research a bit what goes on in Israel, so after I ask my friend, IY\"H, I'll edit that in.</p>\n\n\n",

So a bowl with a cup next to one's bed is the solution. But the Mordechai (Rishon) seems to be lenient that one can walk till the sink to wash ones hands with a cup. As long as one is under one roof this is considered like walking no more than 4 cubits (only outdoors 4 cubits is relevant) as this Halacha is not mentioned explicitly in the Gemora.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כ' הב\"ח בשם ת\"י <strong>ההולך ד' אמות בשחרית קודם שנטל ידיו חייב מיתה</strong> ותמה הב\"ח על הרב בית יוסף שהשמיטו ואולי משום מוטב יהיו שוגגים כו'. ובס' אליה רבה סי' א' הביא בשם גיסו ה\"ה מהרר\"י בעל מנחת יעקב שאמר ליישב מנהג העולם שסומכים ע\"ד המרדכי שהביא ש\"ך יורה דעה סימן שד\"מ בהא דאמרינן אין אומרים בפני המת אלא דבריו של מת. וכ' רב האי גאון דוקא תוך ד' אמות של מת וכ' המרדכי דכל תחתיו נחשב כד\"א וא\"כ ה\"ה כאן מותר לילך בכל החדר קודם נטילה. ובעל א\"ר דחה דהא קי\"ל בכל דוכתי גם לענין צואה בבית דאין כל החדר נחשב לד' אמות א\"כ קשיין דברי המרדכי אעכצ\"ל דהמרדכי לא אמרה אלא לגבי מת <strong>דלא הוזכר בפי' בגמ' שיעור ד' אמות לכן להאי טעמא מסתבר למרדכי דכל החדר נחשב לענין זה כד' אמות</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the sink is is in the restroom then one should refrain saying the Brocha till walking out of the restroom. as it is a dirty place, but a sink outside the restroom is not a dirty place and one can make a Brocho.

That's why so many Rebbes are working miracles on a practically daily basis, while the Litvish have to suffice with the occasional \"Hashgacha Pratis\" story once every few weeks if they're lucky.</p>\n<p>This is because the Chassidim steadfastly hold on to their Yiddish, speaking a different language than everyone else no matter where they live, and this tenacious clinging to one of the three things through which the Jews merited to leave Egypt brings much praise to Hashem, as we say elsewhere in our prayers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משובח ומפואר בלשון כל חסידיו</p>\n<p>[Hashem] is praised and glorified through the language of His Chassidim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is another form of <em>Birkat Hagomel</em>.

The תורה tells us that אברהם engaged his ‘trained’ men in order to rescue לוט. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.14.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">תורה</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וירק את <strong>חניכיו</strong> ילידי ביתו\" – “and he armed his trained men who had been born in his house”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.14.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.14.14.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רש\"י</a> there explains that these men were \"שחנך אותן למצות\" – <em>“He had trained them in מצוות”</em>.  Thus, the first way to understand חינוך is to see it as a period of training.  A time in which we carefully nurture our children by teaching them the ways of the תורה and מצוות and therefore, train them to be a proper Jew.\n(Refer to חובת התלמידים – (Feldheim Publishers – 2011), p. 6)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>Definition 2: Initiation/Inauguration</strong></h2>\n<p>Alternatively, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.14.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.14.14.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רש\"י</a> writes further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"והוא לשון <strong>התחלת כניסת האדם</strong> או כלי לאומנות שהוא עתיד לעמוד בה\"</p>\n<p><em>“[The root חנך] means the beginning of the entry of a person or an implement in the craft in which he/it is destined to stay”</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this second explanation, the word ‘חניכיו’, from which חינוך is derived, is a reference to some sort of starting point (Also refer to רש\"י (שמות כח:מא) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.28.41?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Exodus.28.41.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ד\"ה ומלאת את ידם</a>). In this context, it refers to the disciples of אברהם who joined his household by virtue of the fact that he ‘initiated’ them into Hashem’s commandments. Therefore, when taken in the framework of children, it is to be understood as their entry point into the world of תורה and מצוות. This means to say, when a child arrives at this stage of life, one is able to begin the process of making them aware of what is expected of a תורה Jew (See זריעה ובנין בחינוך, 'העיתוי הנכון – נקודת ההתחלה' עמ' יד - טו). This beginning phase is absolutely pivotal as it establishes the standard from which everything subsequently emanates. (Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.42.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">פרק מב of פרקי דרבי אליעזר</a> where it says, \"הכל הולך אחר הראש\" – <em>“Everything goes after the head”</em> i.e. all that happens stems from the beginning point.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Based on these two definitions, the term 'chinuch' is something that comes into effect right from the beginning and is ongoing as a child grows both from a בין אדם למקום and בין אדם לחבירו perspective. Through 'chinuch', parents foster the sense of expectation and code of conduct that a Jew should live by.</p>\n<p>'Limmud' however, is a reference to a more knowledge-based growth. The תורה <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“<strong>ולמדתם</strong> אותם את בניכם לדבר בם”</p>\n<p><em>“And you shall teach them to your children, to speak of them.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Using this פסוק as a starting point the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.42a.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">גמרא</a> notes that as soon as a child learns how to speak, their father is required to teach them the פסוק of \"תורה צוה לנו משה מורשה קהלת יעקב\" – “Moshe commanded to us Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Yaakov” as well as the first פסוק of קריאת שמע. Rabbi Shlomo Wolbe זצ״ל cites an interesting <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.46.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ספרי</a> that sheds more light on this important חז״ל. The ספרי writes that when a child begins to speak, his father must converse with him in לשון הקודש and teach him תורה. If he doesn’t do this, \"כאילו קוברו\" – “it is as if he buried him,” as it says “ולמדתם אותם את בניכם לדבר בם”, which means to say, if you teach them you will merit a long life, and if not, your days will be short. R’ Wolbe explains this cryptic ספרי to mean that in the early stages of development when a child is learning to speak, it is crucial for a father to plant the seeds for eventual spiritual growth. At this age, a child is ready to be infused with the virtue of אמונה, basic belief in G-d, and conversing in לשון הקודש acts as the medium through which this planting can firmly take root. As such, this point represents a serious and significant moment which must not be delayed at any costs, and must be regarded as the “נקודת ההתחלה” – “starting point” (See זריעה ובנין בחינוך, \"העיתוי הנכון – נקודת ההתחלה\", עמ' יג-יד. Also refer to the חפץ חיים in שמירת הלשון, שער ג, פרק ז). The serious phrase of “it is as if he buried him” is employed to teach you that already when the child is at this young age, a commitment to Torah must be instilled immediately.</p>\n<p>Thus, the term Limmud also begins very early on but it focuses on enhancing a child's knowledge base to give them a Torah framework. It is the way in which the sense 'mesorah' is passed on by teaching a child the different tenets of Torah and Mitzvos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'll explain it in two aspects:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Simply put, <strong>Limud is about knowledge</strong> - knowing what's written in the books. <strong>Chinuch is about observing</strong> and following what's written in those books.</p></li>\n<li><p>Metaphorically, Limud is about intellect, Chinuch is about being a Mentch.</p></li>\n<li><p>Kabbalically, Limud is about 3 Rishonot (חב\"ד) and Chinuch is about 7 Tachtonot (Midos).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>When I was learning to chant Torah from some Sepharadi teachers they referred to Hinukh as the idea of training via repetition.

A place where the custom is not to light - we don't light. We light in shuls, study halls, dark alleyways, and on the backs of sick people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, Mishnah Terumos 11:10 (h/t Heshy) says one can even do this with Terumah oil, if the sick person is owned by a Kohen:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מַדְלִיקִין שֶׁמֶן שְׂרֵפָה בְּבָתֵּי כְנֵסִיּוֹת, וּבְבָתֵּי מִדְרָשׁוֹת, וּבַמְּבוֹאוֹת הָאֲפֵלִין, וְעַל גַּבֵּי הַחוֹלִין בִּרְשׁוּת כֹּהֵן</p>\n<p>We light Terumah oil that must be burned in shuls, study halls, dark alleyways, and on the backs of sick people owned by a Kohen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why are we advised to set fire to sick people's backs on Yom Kippur night?</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Mishnah is talking about the ancient medical practice of <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauterization\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cauterization</a></strong>. Cauterization is the practice of burning wounds (in ancient times with a red hot iron) in order to prevent bleeding. Wounds were often cauterized during surgeries and amputations to prevent hemorrhages and infection. The Mishnah here is mainly referring to the cauterization performed after a surgery. </p>\n\n<p>The reason the patients were treated on Yom Kippur night was because Yom Kippur is a time of forgiveness. Although cauterization can be a potentially life-saving treatment, it is still extremely dangerous. It has the ill-effect of possibly speeding up infections and causing the sick person's death. Many people were afraid (and rightly so) that they would die from the treatment because of their sins. Therefore, the Mishnah tells us to cauterize wounds on Yom Kippur, when the sins are forgiven, so the surgery should have a higher chance of success. </p>\n\n<p>In general, oil from terumah is permitted for this, because it is a case of pikuach nefesh. However, the Mishnah in Terumos is talking about a case where there is both regular and terumah oil available. In that case, it is permitted to use the terumah oil only if the person being treated is owned by a kohen.</p>\n\n\n",

I know there's a rule that a Get has to be written Lishma.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>So how can this Get, which was clearly written for one woman be sold to another?</li>\n<li>And what does the fact that it was found in his container have anything to do with it?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm really looking for some clarification in this Gemara. Someone told me to look it up in artscroll, but I'm not so good with big english words, so I hope someone here might give me simpler <em>pshat.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Respectfully, I believe you are misreading the Mishna. The word מכירו shold not be read with root word 'sale', but rather it should be read as מִכֲּירוֹ, with the defitinition of 'from Cairo'. As you'll see below, that answers all your questions.</p>\n\n<p>As the Gemara (presumably*) explains later on, we are dealing with a case of a businessman who needs to travel outside of Eretz Yisrael for business purposes. </p>\n\n<p>There is generally a Halachah that either spouse is allowed to compel the other one to move to Israel (see the end of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.75.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SH\"A E\"H 75:4</a>). There is also a Halachah that one is not allowed to leave Israel except for specific reasons (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.5.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Melachim 5:9</a>). This particular businessman wanted to move out of Eretz Yisrael for work, but his wife did not want to join him, therefore he sent her a Get to end the marriage. That's why the Get is found in a [shipping] container.</p>\n\n<p>But wait, you might ask, one of the permitted reasons to leave Israel is in order to do business! Why would the wife insist on a divorce if there is no prohibition on leaving Eretz Yisrael for business purposes?</p>\n\n<p>And that's why the Mishna speifically stated the lcation of where the Get was delivered from. The husband went to Cairo, Egypt for business, and since there are <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/2637/5346\">additional prohibitions</a> with regards to leaving Israel for Egypt, the wife insisted on a divorce in this situation.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Well, technically I didn't read the Gemara, but since this explanation is clearly absolute Emes, it logically follows that the Gemara must say the same thing I did.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You misunderstand. The person who wrote the get is an ordinary sofer, who writes Gittin for everyone. He’s selling it because that’s what sofrim do - they’re paid for writing them. </p>\n\n<p>The way the line should be read is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If one is bringing a get, lost it, and immediately found it, it’s kasher. If not, if a disqualification is found in his container, it’s kasher. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The case is that the sofer sent someone to deliver it to the husband. From the fact that the sofer doesn’t take these halachos seriously, not personally delivering it himself, the Rabbis penalized him: if he lost it, he must find it immediately, or else it’s passul. </p>\n\n<p>The interesting bit is the second case in the Mishnah. The Gemara (28a) defines the containers mentioned in the Mishnah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצאו בחפיסה או בדלוסקמא: מאי חפיסה אמר רבה בר בר חנה חמת קטנה מאי דלוסקמא טליקא דסבי:</p>\n  \n  <p>What is a “chafisa”? Rabbah bar bar Chanah said: a small anger. What is a “deluskema”? An elderly purse. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words: these containers are metaphors for emotions. If the sofer sent it, rather than bringing it personally, it must be either that he was angry with the husband (but only a small anger, as if it were a large one, he wouldn’t have sent it at all), or he’s too lazy (symbolized by the elderly, who are unable to get up and go places), or he’s too busy. </p>\n\n<p>We only penalize him in the first two cases; thus, if there’s a disqualification in his anger or laziness, indicating that he did not do so entirely out of these emotions, then we do not penalize him, and the get is still kasher. </p>\n\n\n",

Notably, the Mishnah (Nedarim 3:10) refers to the Jews as \"those who eat garlic.\"</p>\n<p>It was so important to them, the custom was to write it into their Kesuvos. Consider Kesuvos 6:3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פָּסְקָה לְהַכְנִיס לוֹ אֶלֶף דִּינָר, הוּא פוֹסֵק כְּנֶגְדָּן חֲמִשָּׁה עָשָׂר מָנֶה. וּכְנֶגֶד הַשּׁוּם, הוּא פוֹסֵק פָּחוֹת חֹמֶשׁ.</p>\n<p>If she approprtions to bring in 1000 dinar, he apportions 15 maneh. But corresponding to the garlic, he apportions 1/5 less.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's for this reason that the Kesuvos were called \"garlic documents,\" as in Moed Katan 3:3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלו כותבין במועד...אגרות שום</p>\n<p>These may one write on the Moed: [...] documents of garlic</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and Bava Metzia 1:8:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מצא אגרות שום</p>\n<p>If he found documents of garlic</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's presumably for its importance in marriage that Rabban Gamliel instituted (Gittin 4:2) that we write in the get</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>האיש פלוני וכל שום שיש לו</p>\n<p>The man so-and-so, and any garlic there is to him</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h1>Silver garlic</h1>\n<p>Some people would make silver garlic cloves, and they would make a big fanfare over the process, as in the Mishnah you cite from Bava Kamma. This was usually done only for orphans or for Hekdesh (Erchin 6:1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שום היתומים שלושים יום ושום ההקדש ששים יום ומכריזין בבקר ובערב</p>\n<p>Orphans' garlic - 30 days. Hekdesh garlic - 60 days. They would announce it morning and evening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara (Bava Kamma 14b) emphasizes that this <em>must</em> be done with silver:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מאי שום כסף אמר רב יהודה שום זה לא יהא אלא בכסף</p>\n<p>What is \"silver garlic\"? Rav Yehudah said, this garlic may not be except with silver.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The process was as follows: Every morning and evening, for the requisite period, they would call the court and witnesses to session (hence the announcing in the Mishnah in Erchin), at which point they would smelt, refine, and reshape the silver. It was sold as a treasure, and the proceeds used for the orphans or for Hekdesh, as discussed in Kesuvos 11:5:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שׁוּם הַדַּיָּנִין שֶׁפִּחֲתוּ שְׁתוּת אוֹ הוֹסִיפוּ שְׁתוּת, מִכְרָן בָּטֵל.</p>\n<p>The garlic [made by] judges which was lowered by a sixth or raised by a sixth, their sale is nullified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it must have been sold, as Yoma 33a clearly says they did not use silver garlic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי ירמיה שום עצים</p>\n<p>R' Yirmiya said, [they used] wooden garlic</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and ibid. 34a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וחביתין לנסכים שום מנחה</p>\n<p>The griddle-cake offering precedes the libations of the Minchah garlic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As an aside, it's these wooden and Mincha garlics that Megillah 12b refers to when it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר לוי כל פסוק זה על שום קרבנות נאמר</p>\n<p>R' Levi said: This entire passuk was said regarding the garlic offerings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This practice was common enough that Bava Metzia 101a records the expression</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זיל שום ליה</p>\n<p>Go, garlic him</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which means to do the above practice.</p>\n<p>The workmanship of the garlic was impeccable. It shone brilliantly, as the morning star does at its peak. According to Megillah 13a, it's for this reason that Esther was called Esther:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר' נחמיה אומר הדסה שמה ולמה נקראת אסתר שהיו אומות העולם קורין אותה על שום אסתהר</p>\n<p>R' Nechemiah says, her name was Hadasah. Why was she called Esther? For the nations of the world would refer to her by the Venus garlic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The symbolism is very clear: garlic is the means by which the entire Pesach story happened, after all. R' Abba bar Kahana once said (Shabbos 146a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יעקב הוליד שנים עשר שבטים שלא היה בהן שום דופי</p>\n<p>Yaakov bore twelve tribes, among whom there was no flawed garlic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clearly it's because they were lacking garlic, even flawed garlic, that they went to Mitzraim in the first place; the passuk records that they were looking for food. The rest of the story is summarized by Rabban Gamliel (Pesachim 10:5):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פֶּסַח, עַל שׁוּם שֶׁפָּסַח הַמָּקוֹם עַל בָּתֵּי אֲבוֹתֵינוּ בְמִצְרַיִם. מַצָּה, עַל שׁוּם שֶׁנִּגְאֲלוּ אֲבוֹתֵינוּ בְמִצְרַיִם. מָרוֹר, עַל שׁוּם שֶׁמֵּרְרוּ הַמִּצְרִים אֶת חַיֵּי אֲבוֹתֵינוּ בְמִצְרָיִם</p>\n<p>Pesach, for the garlic which Hashem passed over the houses of our forefathers. Matzah, because of the garlic which redeemed our fathers in Mitzraim. Marror, because of the garlic with which the Mitzri'im embittered the lives of our forefathers in Mitzraim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h1>Arguments against garlic</h1>\n<p>Nevertheless, many disapproved of the practice of making silver garlic. Ulla's position (Shabbos 13a) was that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שום קרובא אסור משום לך לך אמרינן לנזירא סחור סחור לכרמא לא תקרב</p>\n<p>Garlic of Closeness is forbidden because of \"'Go, go,' we say to the Nazir, 'circle around, do not approach the vineyard.'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just as we tell a Nazir to stay away from vineyards, lest he drink, we tell people to stay away from silver garlic, as it leads one to idolatry. He calls it \"Garlic of Closeness\" as a euphemism, as his position is that it draws people <em>away</em> from Hashem.</p>\n<p>This position is further captured by the parallel drawn by Rav Ulla (Shabbos 31b):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מאי דכתיב אל תרשע הרבה וגו׳ הרבה הוא דלא לירשע הא מעט לירשע אלא מי שאכל שום וריחו נודף יחזור ויאכל שום אחר ויהא ריחו נודף</p>\n<p>What is that which is written, \"Do not be overly wicked\"? He shouldn't be overly wicked, but just a little wicked?! Rather, one who ate garlic, and its smell wafts, should he go back and eat another one, and the smell will waft more?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's not just a metaphor, but a direct comparison between sinning and garlic. Likewise, Yosef HaBavli (Menachos 18a) referred to this as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שום פסולת בעולם</p>\n<p>Trash garlic in the world</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h1>A compromise: flawed garlic</h1>\n<p>It's for this reason that praise is sung of <em>flawed</em> garlic. As R' Yehudah quoted Shmuel (Yoma 22b):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מפני מה לא נמשכה מלכות בית שאול מפני שלא היה בו שום דופי דאמר רבי יוחנן משום רבי שמעון בן יהוצדק אין מעמידין פרנס על הציבור אלא אם כן קופה של שרצים תלויה לו מאחוריו שאם תזוח דעתו עליו אומרין לו חזור לאחוריך</p>\n<p>Why didn't the kingship of the house of Sha'ul last? Because he didn't have any flawed garlic. For R' Yochanan said in the name of R' Shimon ben Yehotzadak, we do not appoint someone to sustain the community unless he has a box of bugs hanging behind him, so that if he becomes haughty, we say to him, turn around.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A leader must come from an ignoble past. If this person becomes haughty, we show him the flawed garlic in his possession, as if to say, \"You're only in this role because of your flaws.\"</p>\n<p>Of course, the fact that it's broken also negates the idolatry issue. It's for that reason that it was called a Yehudi garlic (Megillah 13a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמאי קרי ליה יהודי על שום שכפר בע\"ז</p>\n<p>Why was it called a Yehudi? Because it's the garlic which denies [opportunity of] idolatry [to its possessors].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara (Nazir 51b) further elaborates on this opinion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שום מת יש לו רקב שום חי אין לו רקב</p>\n<p>Garlic of a corpse - there is to him dust. Garlic of a living person - there is not to him dust.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning: Whole silver garlic is comparable to idolatry, which, in turn, is compared to the dead (Tehillim 106:28); one who smelts one of these will die and turn to dust, as happens to an idolater. One who has flawed silver garlic is not an idolater, and, as such, \"All of you who cling to Hashem, your G-d, you are all alive today\" (Devarim 4:4).</p>\n<p>While at first glance this symbolism would have shown Yeravam as an idolater long before he dreamed of making two golden calves, as the Gemara says of him (Sanhedrin 102a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תורתו של ירבעם לא היה בה שום דופי</p>\n<p>The Torah of Yeravam did not have flawed garlic in it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>notice that this practice began shortly after Yosef ben Yoezer's death (Temurah 15b):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל אשכולות שעמדו לישראל מימות משה עד שמת יוסף בן יועזר איש צרידה לא היה בהם שום דופי מכאן ואילך היה בהן שום דופי</p>\n<p>All the vineyards which the Jews stood up from the days of Moshe until Yosef ben Yoezer of Tzereidah died - there was not among them a flawed garlic. From then on, they had flawed garlic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h1>Avoiding silver garlic in public</h1>\n<p>Nevertheless, there was a different reason for which others disapproved of the practice, which flawed garlic doesn't address: they felt that since it's unfitting for someone to eat garlic in public, as it will cause disturbances, by promoting silver garlic, it will promote the benefits of garlic in general, which will cause garlic to be eaten in public more often. There's a reason that Ezra enacted eating garlic specifically on Friday nights (Bava Kamma 82a) - that's when everyone's home, so people can partake in their garlic addiction without bothering the public at large.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it was after Rebbi's Shiur was disturbed by someone having eaten garlic (Sanhedrin 11a) that he composed his prayer for one's host, which says, in part (Berachos 46a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואל יזדקר לא לפניו ולא לפנינו שום דבר הרהור חטא ועבירה ועון מעתה ועד עולם:</p>\n<p>And may the garlic, a thing of thought of sin, not stand before him or before us, from now and forevermore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is probably a reference to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takkanot_Shum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Garlic Enactments</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, \"silver garlic\" refers to the Garlic Enactment that a dowry (which was often of silver) is returned in the event of the wife's death during the first year of marriage, and half of it is returned in the case of death during the second year. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.53.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rema to Even HaEzer 53:3</a>.)</p>\n\n\n",

He wonders why the Sefer Hachinuch (cited in the question here) states that women are exempt because they are not war-wagers yet in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40631&st=&pgnum=539\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mitzvah # 425 (or 423)</a> he states that women <em>are</em> obligated in the destruction of the seven nations. </p>\n\n<p>R. Bornsztain then makes a distinction between the nature of the commandment for men and women. The Sefer Hachinuch mentions that the obligation of eradicating Amalek is incumbent upon every individual. That is why it would apply to women – even though they don't go to war, they can still kill an individual person if they see one. However, if it's just an individual killing and not an act of war, then it would be no different from any other death penalty which is not administered on Shabbat. Since (for women) the commandment is not operable on Shabbat, it is considered a time-bound positive commandment from which women are exempt.</p>\n\n<p>Eradicating the seven nations, on the other hand, is for the purpose of preventing them from having a negative influence on us. As such, killing them would be a <em>melacha she'aino tzericha legufa</em> and therefore biblically permitted on Shabbat. Since it is then not a time-bound commandment it is incumbent upon women as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What emerges from this is that eradicating Amalek would not supersede Shabbat when done as an individual killing, just like all other death penalties, but it would supersede Shabbat when it was part of a war.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How long will a pair of Tefillin last?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>After how many years are Tefillin supposed to still be acceptable and Kosher? \nDo people often pass down Tefillin from generation to generation?\nIf so, how old is the oldest pair still in use?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Within the scope of this question, I'll have to in some sense, \"redefine\" the term \"tefillin\". You'll see why.</p>\n\n<p>The \"foundation\" of the tefillin is the parchment on which all the words are written. Technically good quality parchment has an almost indefinite lifespan. Think of the Torah scrolls that you've seen in shuls. Some are a century old or more. Some are in better condition than others. Part of that has to do with the thickness and quality of the parchment, and part has to do with the environment the scrolls are kept in.</p>\n\n<p>The parchment of your tefillin are the same way. You do have one advantage, here, in that the parchment is not exposed to air quite as much as Torah scrolls are, but they can get some dampness if you happen to store them in a damp place. So, to start, when you buy tefillin, try to get some idea of the strength and quality of the parchment. Ideally, if you could find a sofer who is in the process of writing the scrolls that will go into the tefillin housing, that's best, but otherwise, try to get a recommendation to someone who is honest and straightforward. If the sofer doesn't mind opening the housing before you buy it - terrific.</p>\n\n<p>Next, the housing of the tefillin needs to be fairly thick and sturdy. There are different \"grades: of thickness, so the thicker the housing is, the better it will protect the parchment from dampness.</p>\n\n<p>The straps get the most exposure, and there are different thicknesses and grades of straps. Regardless of what you do, straps will have to be replaced every 3 - maybe 10 years from what I've seen depending on its thickness and quality. Fortunately, the straps aren't overly expensive compared to the other parts of the tefillin.</p>\n\n<p>The common custom is to have tefillin checked once every 7 years. regardless of the quality of all the parts. The main concern is that letters on the parchment may rub off and the sofer needs to manually correct something. A layman usually doesn't know what to look for so don't try to figure this yourself. The sofer will also check for any dampness / mold / wearing or other problems with the housing and possible problems with the parchment. As I said, I found that rarely does the parchment go completely bad. The housing may have to be replaced and, as before, probably the straps.</p>\n\n<p>The key to all this is proper maintenance and care. If you keep it in a fairly dry place (I don't recommend a typical basement, for example, and not in a humid room during the summer.) and have it inspected on a regular schedule, it should last indefinitely and both you and your progeny will make good use of it for numerous years.</p>\n\n<p>I think I have the tefillin from my father-in-law which is probably close to a century old, and in usable shape. I'm not saying its pretty, necessarily, but it is kosher and usable as of last check a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn't venture any guess as to how old the oldest existing tefillin is or who owns it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>\"The halachic tradition through the ages has nearly unanimously followed the position of Beit Shammai and Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel.

He cites the story about Hillel as found in the Yerushalmi presumably as a basis for his ruling. The Smag (Aseh 22, also citing Hillel), Rosh (last halachah in Hilchot Tefillin [31]) and Tur (OC 39) rule similarly. The Beit Yosef (OC 39:10) cites the Mechilta (in the name of Tosafot [Menachot 42b-43a, s.v. “tefillin”]) and the Yerushalmi, and rules that “tefillin that are known to be kosher never need to be checked” (SA, OC 39:10).\"</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/tzarich-iyun/checking-tefillin/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/tzarich-iyun/checking-tefillin/</a></p>\n\n<p>Some can last for 100s of years.

Yosef Kafach (Mishneh Torah, Hilkhos Teshuvah ch. 8 n. 4) offers a different interpretation. He suggests that the Rambam’s view is that kares is an eternal suffering of the soul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Several questions regarding that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Eternal suffering means it lasts an <em>infinite</em> amount of time. A billion, trillion to the trillionth power, 10^number of atoms in the universe...any finite number is as actual 0 compared to infinity. So according to this view, this would be a completely disproportionate punishment compared to all the other views (e.g., dying young or even losing share in olam haba or even destruction of the soul). Unlike any of those, this punishment and suffering would just never ever stop. Could that really be what was meant and is it compatible with Judaism's conception of Divine mercy (even for the most heinous crimes)?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This punishment is much greater than just being executed by the court. Execution by the court is a relatively quick demise and grants atonement, and enables the person to retain his olam haba. Kares on the other hand, potentially (according to some views) makes one lose a share in olam haba or have his soul be destroyed entirely, or (according to this view) subjects the soul to eternal suffering.</p>\n<p>How can that be, since kares is generally thought of as a lesser punishment than execution by the court. For example it appears lower in the order of Rambam's eight levels of punishment (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/85864/yom-kippur-more-lenient-than-shabbos?noredirect=1&lq=1\">see here </a> and other answers there too). Also, often kares is given for the very same sins as execution by the court, except when a technicality (like witnesses) was missing. Surely the absence of witnesses shouldn't make the crime <em>more</em> heinous, and to the degree that the punishment would be so much more severe than just execution?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So what's going on here? Is kares a lower [or even basically equal] form of punishment than execution by the court, or is it, counter-intuitively, a much higher one (perhaps infinitely so)?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# PTIJ: How can I halachically kill a vampire?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Just to be safe, I've been reading up on how to vanquish a vampire. Never hurts to be too careful. From what I've read, it seems that many authorities agree that the simplest and surest way to kill a vampire is with a wooden stake through the heart.</p>\n<p>The concern that I have is, our Sages teach us (Kiddushin 49b) that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דברים שבלב אינם דברים</p>\n<p>things in the heart are not things</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and therefore, seemingly as soon as the stake penetrates the vampires heart, it will cease to exist.</p>\n<p>So how can I vanquish vampires if my stake will stop existing?</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>A stake in Hebrew is a יתד, and as it says in Yishayahu, ותקעתיו יתד במקום נאמן, you need to stick the stake in a \"trustworthy place\".   In Nechemya we find: ומצאת את לבבו נאמן. So it's obvious the torah is saying you need to stick the stake in the heart.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the question is what to do about דברים שבלב, and the answer is that we do have a number of exceptions to the rule.  One of those is having in mind to bring an offering to the Beit Hamikdash (shavuout 26b):  גמר בלבו מנין ת\"ל כל נדיב לב.  -- even if you just have in mind to bring an offering, it is sufficient.  </p>\n\n<p>So, generally, when staking the vampire, make sure you are having in mind to bring him as an offering to the Beit Hamikdash, and you should be good to go.  </p>\n\n<p>Note:  The pasuk כל נדיב לב specifically includes זהב וכסף ונחשת , etc. so you can bring the vampire as an offering of any type of metal, but most poskim agree that the מצוה מן המובחר is to have in mind to use silver, especially for vampires.  As the Mishna says (Bava Kamma 1:3) שום כסף -- \"Silver is like garlic\", which we all know is good against vampires.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>There are a variety of ways to kill a vampire. The first thing to remember is that while there may not be \"devarim\" in the heart, you can still effect work in the heart by praying for the death of a vampire -- <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/71745/why-is-avodah-shebalev-service-of-the-heart-known-as-prayer\">tefilla</a> is avodah shebalev.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, one can burn them as the halachot of nosar-<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosferatu_(word)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">feratu</a> read, Ba'eish <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/makos/review/ma-rg-015.htm?q=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">tisrofu</a>. Also, one can purify a house from the evil of a vampire by exposing the vampire to sun, or even to evening! (Uva Hashemesh Vetaher). You could cover it in silver, but I'm afraid that would appear like kisuf. Lastly, you can cut the head off but that lacks finesse and is just if you have to do a ראש job.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>You can hand the vampire an uninteresting newspaper. There's historical precedent that doing so destroys evil.</p>\n\n<p>Precedent: Yael gave Sisra the Yated and bored him to death.</p>\n\n<p>(Credit to @Nic for reminding me of this old joke).</p>\n\n\n",

If it’s after twelve months, he says, “May his memory be for a blessing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even if the Shulchan Aruch had a different reading of the Gemara, he was certainly aware of Rashi’s interpretation of it, as he directly quotes him in Beis Yosef ad. loc.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חייב לכבדו אפי' לאחר מותו כיצד היה אומר דבר שמועה מפיו וכו' ברייתא שם (לא:) ופירש\"י הריני כפרת משכבו. עלי יבא כל רע הראוי לבא על נפשו: לאמר שנים עשר חדש. כבר קבל מה שקבל שאין משפט רשעי ישראל בגיהנם אלא י\"ב חדש: </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>THe Midrash Bereyshis Rabba 49a says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"רבי יצחק פתח (משלי י, ז): \"<strong>זֵכֶר צַדִּיק לִבְרָכָה וְשֵׁם רְשָׁעִים יִרְקָב</strong>\" .<br>\n  אמר רבי יצחק כל מי שהוא מזכיר את הצדיק ואינו מברכו עובר בעשה מה טעמיה \"זֵכֶר צַדִּיק לִבְרָכָה\".<br>\n  וכל מי שהוא מזכיר את הרשע ואינו מקללו עובר בעשה מה טעמיה \"וְשֵׁם רְשָׁעִים יִרְקָב\". </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Acc. to this Midrash everyone who mentions the name of a Tzaddik has to add \"Zichrono Livraha\" (and the opposite with the wicked) because the Possuk says \"זכר צדיק לברכה\" meaning \"if you mention a Tzaddik - bless him\".</p>\n\n<p>So literally, Z\"l does not mean \"his memory blessed\", but actually <strong>\"when mentioned (זכרונו) - blessed (לברכה)\"</strong>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I don't know how and if it helps the soul, it just means we treat him as a Tzaddik.

Kesef is learned from Torah Shebaal Peh (Kichah Kichah), and Shaveh Kesef is another Derasha on top of that.

All marriages are in Parshas Ki Seitzei. The Shadchan just doesn’t want to discuss it more specifically, because marriage is only discussed in the context of divorce (Devarim 24:1) and a husband who accuses his wife of cheating (Devarim 22:13). Because we don’t want to inadvertently cast a curse on the couple, the custom is not to specify the Parsha. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>\"The Parsha\" is a colloquial way of referring to the upcoming week's Torah reading.

Their money and their children should be taken as spoil, but neither women or children should be killed, as Deuteronomy 20:14 states: 'But the women and the children... take as spoil.\" 'The children' refer to males below the age of majority.</p>\n  \n  <p>The above applies to a <em>milchemet hareshut</em> fought with other nations. However, <strong>if either the seven nations or Amalek refuse to accept a peaceful settlement</strong>, not one soul of them may be left alive as <em>ibid</em>. 20:15-16 states: 'Do this to all the cities that ... are not the cities of these nations. However, from the cities of these nations,... do not leave a soul alive.' Similarly, in regard to Amalek, Deuteronomy 25:19 states: 'Obliterate the memory of Amalek.'</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>How do we know that these commands are only referring to those who did not accept a peaceful settlement?</strong> Joshua 11:19-20 states: 'There was no city which accepted a peaceful settlement with the children of Israel except the Chivites who lived in Gibeon. All the rest, they conquered in battle. This was inspired by God, Who strengthened their hearts to engage in battle against Israel so that they would be destroyed.' From these statements, we can infer that a peaceful settlement was offered, but they did not accept it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, according to Rambam, Amalekites are only killed if they do not agree to the peace offer. It should therefore be certainly possible for them to convert to Judaism. Furthermore, Rambam explicitly writes elsewhere (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=5&hilchos=27&perek=12&halocha=17&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Issurei Biah 12:17</a>) that people from any nation can convert, and he does not list Amalek as an exception:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל העכו\"ם כולם כשיתגיירו ויקבלו עליהן כל המצות שבתורה והעבדים כשישתחררו הרי הן כישראל לכל דבר שנאמר הקהל חוקה אחת יהיה לכם ומותרין להכנס בקהל י\"י מיד והוא שישא הגר או המשוחרר בת ישראל וישא הישראלי גיורת ומשוחררת חוץ מד' עממין בלבד והם עמון ומואב ומצרים ואדום שהאומות האלו כשיתגייר אחד מהן הרי הוא כישראל לכל דבר אלא לענין ביאה בקהל</p>\n  \n  <p>Whenever any of the gentiles convert and accept all of the mitzvot in the Tora or a servant is freed, they are considered as Jews with regard to all matters, as [Numbers 15:15] states: \"For the community: there will be one law [for you and the convert].\" A convert may marry within the Jewish community immediately, i.e., a male convert or freed servant may marry a native-born Jewess and an Israelite may marry a female convert or a freed maid-servant.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are four nations from which [converts] are exceptions: Ammon, Moab, Egypt, and Edom. When a person from one of these nations converts, he is like an Israelite with regard to all matters with the exception of marriage within the Jewish community. (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960660/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Twelve.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, there may in fact be a specific rule against accepting Amalekite converts, as formulated in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekhilta_of_Rabbi_Ishmael\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mechilta of R. Yishmael</a> at <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40607&st=&pgnum=124\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the end of Parshat Beshalach</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' אליעזר אומר נשבע המקום בכסא הכבוד שלו שאם יבא אחד מכל אומות העולם להתגייר שיקבלוהו ולעמלק ולביתו לא יקבלוהו שנ' ויאמר דוד אל הנער המגיד לו אי מזה אתה ויאמר בן איש גר עמלקי אנכי נזכר דוד באותה שעה מה שנאמר למשה רבינו אם יבא אחד מכל האומות שבעולם להתגייר שיקבלוהו ומביתו של עמלק שלא יקבלוהו מיד ויאמר אליו דוד דמך על ראשך כי פיך ענה בך לכך נאמר מדור דור</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Eliezer says that God swore on His throne of glory that if someone from any of the nations of the world comes to convert, they should accept him, but [if someone comes from] Amalek and his house, they should not accept him. <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08b01.htm#13\" rel=\"noreferrer\">As it says</a>, <em>And David said unto the young man that told him: 'Whence art thou?' And he answered: 'I am the son of an Amalekite stranger.'</em> At that moment David remembered that which had been told to Moses our teacher  – if someone from any of the nations of the world comes to convert, they should accept him, but from the house of Amalek they should not accept him. <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08b01.htm#16\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Immediately</a>, <em>And David said unto him: 'Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee,</em> Therefore <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0217.htm#16\" rel=\"noreferrer\">it says</a> <em>from generation to generation</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this, then, it should not be possible for Amalekites to convert to Judaism.

Through superior erudition and laborious work I have assembled a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/search?q=%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%A8%20%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9C&tab=text&tvar=1&tsort=relevance&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"noreferrer\">comprehensive list of Jewish sources that permit eating</a> which you can peruse at your leisure. Chief among the sources is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Nedarim.7.8?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nedarim 7:8</a>, which states unequivocally:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מֻתָּר לֶאֱכֹל</p>\n<p>It is permitted to eat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now you may ask why, if it is permitted to eat, the other sources all forbid eating. The answer is that this is a classic case of שני כתובים המכחישים זה את זה עד שיבוא הכתוב השלישי ויכריע ביניהם - two sources that contradict each other, which are resolved by a third source which explains them.</p>\n<p>Our sources tell us the proper way to eat:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִכְלוּ רֵעִים</p>\n<p>Eat friends.

But what's more, this is precisely the kind of food we are supposed to eat for the Purim meal. That's why the commandment on Purim is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּמִשְׁלוֹחַ מְנוֹת־אִישׁ לְרֵעֵהוּ</p>\n<p>Sending portions of a person to one's friend.

As everyone knows this is also the exact gematria of \"ויאמר י-ה-ו-ה אל אברהם למה\", which translates as \"And the L-rd said to Abraham 'Why?'\" (Genesis 18:13) Thus, clearly, the L-rd wanted Abraham to say the answer to your question, \"Why can't I eat anything?\"\nWell, if you look at Genesis Chapter 18, it seems that Abraham doesn't reply. This would seem to demonstrate there is no answer.\nHowever, 637 is also the gematria of \"עפר ואפר\", which translates as \"dust and ash\" (Genesis 18:27). If you look at that verse, we can see cleary that Abraham was replying as it says, \"And Abraham replied.\"\nTherefore, the prohibition of eating, says Abraham, is only with regards to dust and ash. However, we all know that there is a custom of eating bread, water, and a hard boiled egg with ash on the eve of the ninth of Av.\nWe can solve this problem with Genesis 3:12, which says, \"Then the L-rd G-d said to the serpent, “Because you did this, ... and you shall eat dust eat.\" We can make an inference from this that <strong>only</strong> the serpent shall eat dust, but everyone else shall not eat dust, as Abraham said. Now, since one of the things that Abraham said that one shall not eat actually only applies to everyone but the serpent, it is only fair that we be allowed to eat ash, whilst the serpent is prohibited from eating ash.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is one of those questions where you are really complicating things. </p>\n\n<p>All these places are giving you a subtle hint to what your mom always told you when you were about to steal that cookie from the cookie jar, taste the batter, eat desert first, etc. C'mon, you remember those famous words that your mom said:</p>\n\n<p><strong>DON'T EAT THAT.

You asked \"Why <strong>Can't</strong> I eat anything?\" You don't have the ability to eat anything whatsoever .. EVER! All because of that one time in life that you ate something before dinner!! You're appetite is <strong>permanently</strong> ruined!</p>\n\n<p>Moral of the story - listen to your mom. She knows!!</p>\n\n\n",

He had <em><strong>already</strong></em> learned/ received that Torah!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I once heard Rav Herschel Schachter discuss this question. He gave an analogy, that if one were to bring out Euclid, and show him a modern suspension bridge, and tell him it was built using Euclidean geometry, he would have no idea what you are talking about. Because Euclid started with five postulates and built from there, and later mathematicians continued to build on that. But they were always building, and combining or extending existing principles to deduce new ones. R' Schachter suggested the same with R' Akiva and Moshe - R' Akiva was teaching Torah which was firmly rooted in <em>Toras Moshe</em>, but was advanced by developing the existing framework. Thus, Moshe was consoled when R' Akiva said he knew it from <em>Halacha L'Moshe MiSinai</em>, because he understood that it all was still rooted back to the Torah brought from Har Sinai, and it had not been supplanted or replaced. Thus, everything <em>was</em> told to Moshe, for all of the future <em>chiddushim</em> are not <em>new</em> to the Torah, they are just the complexity and the depth of the Torah being expounded and explicated. But Moshe did not necessarily have the conscious awareness of all of these details of what he was receiving. The Maharal in his Chiddushei Aggados to the Gemara in Menachos, in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14199&st=&pgnum=79\" rel=\"noreferrer\">second approach</a>, says something similar, namely that Moshe had the השגה of the Torah as a כלל, in one general unified grasp, but not of the particulars. R' Akiva had the grasp of Torah in the form of detailed particulars. (The Maharal understands this to be what it means that R' Akiva was expounding the <em>taggin</em>, the crowns of the letters, which Maharal understands are references to the details which \"come out\" of the letters.) Perhaps this could mean that Moshe had, in potential, all of the Torah to ever be taught, but not with a conscious appreciation of each detail.</p>\n\n<p>In his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14199&st=&pgnum=77\" rel=\"noreferrer\">first approach</a> the Maharal says something that I don't fully understand but will try to present. Firstly, he established that the <em>taggin</em> represent a level of grasping some higher level, finer concepts of the Torah. He then says that Moshe's level was higher than R' Akiva in that he received everything at the level of prophecy, and everything that he knew, he had higher clarity in because he knew it through prophecy. He also explains that Moshe was on the level of mastery of this world. He therefore knew all of the Torah relevant to this world (which would explain that he knew everything a future scholar would instruct, all of the <em>halachic</em> material of Torah). However, he specifically did not know it through חכמה. R' Akiva knew it through חכמה, and therefore was able to grasp things which are beyond this world, and R' Akiva lived an existence on a level of beyond this world. He could therefore connect to the <em>taggin</em>. (See there for more details and explanation.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Was discussing this with my rabbi recently and he gave me an answer. This can be answered based on logic. Moshe's learning of the Torah in many respects was not linear and was visual as well as with many details being conveyed simultaneously. One specific example of this is the menorah. While Rebbi Akiva is teaching a subject in a logical and progressive linear fashion. It makes sense that Moshe could not recognize the same teaching being tought in another fashion. At the end of that story Moshe is reassured when Hashem tells him this is what was taught on mt sinai. </p>\n\n<p>In short. Moshe knew what was being taught but did not recognize the thing being taught right away</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Please see Michtav Meliyahu Chelek 5 page 216. There he brings the Maharal as well as his own understanding.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Akiva develops his knowledge from the specifics to whole. So from even the taggim he understood and expanded ideas in Torah. Whereas Moshe understood the Torah as a whole, it confused him as to why someone would need such profound logic for things that were so obvious. They both had different learning styles.</p>\n<p>My own analogy: A blind man can infer that since it is hot outside there must be a massive producer of heat, and since there are general periods of hot and cold there must be day and night, clouds, winter etc....</p>\n<p>If you did not know the person was blind you would be confused why he was developing such complicated pieces of logic for things that were so obvious. I think this is the \"kind\" of difficulty Moshe had. It is of my opinion that it was not that Moshe didn't understand the class; rather, the whole idea was difficult until he heard Rebbi Akiva mention Halacha Moshe Mi'Sinai, that we need the general picture, but you could also infer it. According to the analogy the person says I know there is a sun, but look how you could logically infer it if you needed to.</p>\n<p>This shows the greatness of Torah and how interconnected it is.

Now my father called him \"Herb\"... but so did Herb's kids. Is that allowed?</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, is this something a parent can be <em>mochel</em> on, ie: \"I don't mind, you can refer to me by my first name\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are instances where a child can use their parent's name.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Radvaz, Hilchos Mamrim 6:3, s.v. אבל, a child may use their parent's name, even in their parent's presence (and presumably even to the parent, although he does not explicate that point), as long as it is qualified with an honorific, such as Reb/Rav Avrohom, or Don Avraham.</p>\n\n<p>R' Akiva Eiger, D'rush V'chiddush Shabbos 115a s.v. אמר ר' יוסי, proves (in the name of his son R' Shlomo Eiger) basically the same thing from a Rashi in Sanhedrin, which says that a heretic is someone who refers to their father as Ploni, and not as Rebbi Mori Ploni (my rebbe my teacher Ploni), which means that with the honorific it would be ok. (Although we see nothing from here about even in the father's presence.)</p>\n\n<p>According to the Maharshal, Yam Shel Shlomo Kiddushin #65, honorifics only work with regard to a teacher's name, but not a parent's name, since you only have one father and there is no need to clarify further than just to say \"my father.\" Pischei Teshuva, Y.D. 240:2 writes that based on this, if someone asked who your father is you could answer with his name, because it's a necessary clarification (but you should still add an honorific).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding if a parent can nullify this, the Gemara in Kiddushin says that a father who pardons his honor, his honor is pardoned. Calling him by name is really a facet of fear, not honor, as the Rambam classifies it, but the Turei Even proves from Kiddushin 32a that even disgracing a parent is in their jurisdiction to pardon.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Rebels.6.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Mamrim 6:8</a>) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֶלָּא יִמְחל וְיִתְעַלֵּם שֶׁהָאָב שֶׁמָּחַל עַל כְּבוֹדוֹ כְּבוֹדוֹ מָחוּל</p>\n<p>Rather he should forgive and ignore, as the father that forgave his honor, his honor is forgiven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So a parent who allows their kid to call them by name, the kid is allowed to call them by name. From the fact that Herb didn’t object to his kids calling him by name, he probably allowed them to call them by name. Nevertheless, it is better to be mechabed, because, as it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.32b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin  32b</a><br />\nאפ\"ה הידור מיעבד ליה בעו - even so, he should honor him (literally praise him)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Cursing Adam and Eve in addition to punishment?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When Adam was commanded not to eat from the tree of knowledge, G-d presented him with the punishment (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.2.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ber 2.17</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּמֵעֵץ הַדַּעַת טוֹב וָרָע לֹא תֹאכַל מִמֶּנּוּ כִּי בְּיוֹם אֲכָלְךָ מִמֶּנּוּ מוֹת תָּמוּת׃</p>\n<p>but as for the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat of it; for as soon as you eat of it, <strong>you shall die.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So \"you shall die\" was the punishment, as I understand. However, it looks that \"things went emotional\" (please edit) when G-d started to curse the serpent, Eve and Adam, things that were not detailed in the commandment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּלְאָדָם אָמַר כִּי־שָׁמַעְתָּ לְקוֹל אִשְׁתֶּךָ וַתֹּאכַל מִן־הָעֵץ אֲשֶׁר צִוִּיתִיךָ לֵאמֹר לֹא תֹאכַל מִמֶּנּוּ אֲרוּרָה הָאֲדָמָה בַּעֲבוּרֶךָ בְּעִצָּבוֹן תֹּאכֲלֶנָּה כֹּל יְמֵי חַיֶּיךָ׃</p>\n<p>To Adam He said, “Because you did as your wife said and ate of the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You shall not eat of it,’ Cursed be the ground because of you; By toil shall you eat of it All the days of your life:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So let's say I'm speeding, and a cop stops me. I'm liable to the full punishment outlined in the law, but not to additional curses, humiliation, hatred etc.</p>\n<p>So it is either that the curses should have been elaborated in the commandment or G-d should have terminated Adam as promised.</p>\n<p>Why G-d cursed Adam and Eve and the Serpent contrary to the wording of the punishment in the commandment?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I’ve heard two approaches to this, but I don’t have a source for either one. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>These aren’t curses, nor punishments; simply facts. Because they ate from the tree, this is the natural consequence of the action, the reality in which they now live. It’s no different than a parent telling a child that if they take an extra cookie, they have to go to their room, and when the child eats it, he gets a stomachache. “That wasn’t the deal! You only told me I’d go to my room, not that I’d have a stomachache!” (I thought I had heard this in the name of Michtav MeEliyahu, but <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/100715/\">it seems this is Rav Hirsch’s approach</a>.)</li>\n<li>These are punishments not for eating but for their subsequent deferring blame (Adam to Chavah, Chavah to the snake) rather than taking responsibility for their actions. Had they owned up to their sins and expressed remorse, these punishments would not have been placed on them.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8167#v14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 3:14-15</a> that the words used show that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the speech to the serpent had been preceded by the speech to the\n  woman, and that this had been preceded by that to the man. Accordingly\n  ארורה האדמה בעבורך, the earth had already been cursed for the sake of\n  mankind. The whole world, including its animal life, had already been\n  doomed to suffer by Man's sin, for his sake i.e. as a means for his\n  betterment, but the serpent most of all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rash Hirsch explains in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8167#v119\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 3:18-19</a> that Adam was never cursed. Since this is still within the first days of Creation, Adam's action caused a change in the nature of the universe in order to allow him to attempt to raise himself back to his original level.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One consideration does however seem to us of the utmost importance.\n  <em>In the whole of this verdict of Hashem, the curse is pronounced only against the\n  ground and an animal, but in no wise over Man. Mankind is\n  in no manner whatsoever placed under a ban for his first disobedience.\n  In all that was said, not a single syllable altered by a hairbreadth\n  Man's high calling or his ability to reach and fulfill it.</em> Only the\n  stage on which, and the external circumstances under which he has to\n  accomplish his mission are altered for his benefit. The mission\n  itself, his God-like calling and his God-like competence for it\n  remains undisturbed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains In <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8167#v17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 3:17</a> that the translation of <code>אֲרוּרָ֤ה הָֽאֲדָמָה֙ בַּֽעֲבוּרֶ֔ךָ</code> is <code>the ground will be cursed **for your sake**</code></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So here: <em>not because you sinned, but for your betterment,</em> for your\n  sake, ארורה וגו, is the ground to be restrained in its development. I\n  will not let it develop freely any longer, it will no longer smile at\n  you, will no longer of its own will offer you its products, only with\n  renunciation of s grest deal will you be able to enjoy any of it,\n  בעצבון תאכלנה. <em>The purpose of this blight on the blessing of the soil\n  is to habituate Man to this עצבון.</em> \"Every sacrifice brings a profit\"\n  (Prov. XIV,3) is still today a principle of education. Giving things up\n  makes a man free, brings out his better, nobler self, makes him\n  independent of external things, of that which the world offers or\n  denies, and allows him to fid his own true worth in faithfulness to\n  Hashem, and at the same time his undisturbable happiness. Into this\n  school of renunciation Man was now to be led.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Gershon Chanoch Henoch Leiner</a> was the first person in modern times to try to \"rediscover techeiles\". He wrote a short book called <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/41312\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefunei Temunei Chol</a> in which he outlines 10 criteria for identifying the creature that would produce techeiles. In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41312&st=&pgnum=48\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the last paragraph</a> he says that he was able to obtain the species that fits all the criteria, but further research with live samples is necessary to actually produce techeiles.</p>\n\n<p>Then he wrote a second book called <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/41254\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesil Techeiles</a> in which he describes how he went to the aquarium in Naples, Italy and saw the creature and learned everything about it and saw that it was indeed the creature that produces techeiles. In this book he explains how the creature fits all the criteria he laid out in the previous book. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Petil Tekhelet Institute</strong></p>\n\n<p>Eventually, via the research of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_HaLevi_Herzog\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yitzchak Isaac Herzog</a>, it was discovered that the techeiles produced from the cuttlefish was simply <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_blue\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prussian Blue</a>. That means that the cuttlefish played no role in the dyeing process; it simply provided the organic compound which, when certain chemicals were applied, became Prussian Blue, a synthetic dye. Most people therefore rejected this techeiles, as the same synthetic dye could be produced from any organic compound.</p>\n\n<p>In his research, R. Herzog suggested other candidates. The one used by the Petil Tekhelet Institute (and probably everyone else besides a few Chasidic groups who stick with the Radzyner techeiles) is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexaplex_trunculus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hexaplex Trunculus</a>, more commonly called the Murex Trunculus.</p>\n\n<p>R. Herzog had several issues with this candidate, most notably that no one could actually produce a blue dye from it.</p>\n\n<p>After R. Herzog's death Otto Elsner discovered that the dye could be turned blue by leaving it out in the sun. Since then they have been using this dye as techeiles. Hundreds of articles have been written discussing how the Hexaplex Trunculus, and the dye it produces, fit or don't fit the necessary criteria. The best starting point is probably the series of articles in <em>The Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society</em>  by Dr. Mendel Singer an Dr. Baruch Sterman, which can be read <a href=\"http://techelet.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/contemporary_discourses_on_the_chilazon.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (Singer argued against the Hexaplex Trunculus, and Sterman argued in favor of it.) </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Janthina</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janthina_janthina\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Janthina</a> was another suggestion by R. Herzog, and it may have fit some of the criteria better than the other candidates but no one was able to produce a blue dye with it. I believe Dr. Saul Kaplan is convinced this is the correct creature, and even claims to be able to produce dye from it, but as far as I know no one has ever been able to publicly produce techeiles from it.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I think this covers the basic views, albeit in a somewhat simplistic manner.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>An extension of R' Herzog's opinion on the Murex/Purfura being the source of Techeiles is that Chilazon is the generic word for snail (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQyuo1gKGUs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQyuo1gKGUs</a>). Interestingly there's a new \"mexican murex\" (Plicopurpura Pansa) which can produce a Techeiles color. Alternatively there's the \"black murex\" or \"hexaplex nigritus\" in California (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexaplex_nigritus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexaplex_nigritus</a>), which hasn't been tested for dying but there's no reason to suspect it can't dye the same result.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not in the future that will be as halachically accepted as the murex trunculus is now remains to be seen, but I was told in confidence by unnamed members of both Ptil Tekhelet and the Techeiles Chabura in Lakewood that they feel that logically it should be fine. Again, this whole sugya is still in the exciting groundbreaking stages and it will be very interesting to see how this continues to develop in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n",

There are some very good reasons for the coffee stains you have observed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Mikvaot.6.5?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishnah Mikvaot 6:5</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קפה מטבילין בהן כמה</p>\n  \n  <p>Coffee, we dip much in to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously, this will cause the coffee to overflow the cup and will result in stains.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shabbat.4.2?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishnah Shabbat 4:2</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קפה מטה על צדה</p>\n  \n  <p>Coffee, we tip on its side.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clearly, this is going to produce even more stains.</p>\n\n<p>However, we can pose a question from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Beitzah.4.1?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishnah Beitzah 4:1</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא יפשיל את הקפה לאחוריו אבל מביאה הוא בידו</p>\n  \n  <p>One must not throw the coffee behind him, but rather bring it in his hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Mishnah rules that we must be very careful when transporting coffee, to avoid stains.</p>\n\n<p>We can resolve the contradiction by positing that the obligation to spill coffee is only in public spaces. In one's home, one is meant to avoid doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Support for this distinction can be seen from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.181.6?vhe=Ashlei_Ravrevei:_Shulchan_Aruch_Yoreh_Deah,_Lemberg,_1888&lang=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah 181:6</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אשה אינה במצות הקפה</p>\n  \n  <p>Women do not have the commandment of [spilling] the coffee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, if the obligation to spill coffee applied at home, women would be included. However, because it only applies in the <em>beit midrash</em>, women are exempt. As we learn in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Moed_Katan.18a.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mo'ed Katan 18a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אשה בי מדרשא לא שכיחא</p>\n  \n  <p>Women are not commonly in the <em>beit midrash</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The fact that you also see some stains in private books is probably because not all of the masses are aware that this distinction exists - they see coffee stains in the <em>beit hamidrash</em> and mistakenly believe that they should also practice this at home.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Tehillim 19 says:</p>\n\n<p>בבוקר יציץ וחלב</p>\n\n<p>In the morning, he has <em>yatzitz</em> with milk. Well, what do people drink in the morning that has milk in it? Coffee. Therefore <em>yatziz</em> is the term for coffee.</p>\n\n<p>Many people come to the <em>Bet Midrash</em> to learn before davening. They drink coffee while they learn. One tends to shuckle while learning, which seems to be a mitzvah, as one should \"put his entire self\" into his learning. So, if he's shuckling, it means that he will spill his coffee on everything. This is a mitzvah on the person doing it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, note that I mentioned specifically the morning. If you learn in the afternoon, these rules don't apply. However, it is considered praiseworthy to use a coffee-stained book so that you can gain some of the <em>kedusha</em> that was passed onto that book by someone who used this before you and was nice enough to leave his mark on it.</p>\n\n\n",

As Wikipedia teaches us:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In his autobiography I Am Not Spock, Nimoy wrote that he based it on the Priestly Blessing performed by Jewish Kohanim with both hands, thumb to thumb in this same position, representing the Hebrew letter Shin (ש), which has three upward strokes similar to the position of the thumb and fingers in the gesture. The letter Shin here stands for El Shaddai, meaning \"Almighty (God)\", as well as for Shekinah and <strong>Shalom</strong>. Nimoy wrote that when he was a child, his grandfather took him to an Orthodox synagogue, where he saw the blessing performed and was impressed by it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The best part is, you can try it right at the keyboard with <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/raised-hand-with-part-between-middle-and-ring-fingers/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> emoji. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Dr. Shmuel mentioned the Vulcan Salute - a good option. But, I have heard that since that gesture came from Leonard Nimoy a\"h, who claims that he saw the Cohanim use this gesture while they were blessing the people, and he wasn't supposed to look, it indicates that he may have disobeyed the halacha and used that disobedience to promote the idea on a famous TV series.

See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Actually, according to <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0426.htm#65\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Numbers 26:65</a> in Biblical days dogs were people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא נותר מהם איש כי אם כלב</p>\n<p>There was no man left from them except for a dog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, Jonah must have been swallowed by a person. We know that it is possible for a person to swallow another person based on two Talmudic passages. In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=35&daf=14&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Keritot 14a</a> we find that a person's throat can hold two olives:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ושיערו חכמים דאין בית הבליעה מחזיק יותר משני זיתים</p>\n<p>And the Sages assessed that the throat can hold no more than two olives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=21b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Metziah 21b</a> we see that olives are people:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי אבהו שאני זית הואיל וחזותו מוכיח עליו ואע\"ג דנתרין זיתי מידע ידיע דוכתא דאיניש איניש הוא</p>\n<p>R. Abahu said: \"The olive is different since its appearance proves it; and even though the olive falls, its place is surely known because <strong>a man it is a man</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, a human throat can hold two people. Therefore the dog – being a person – would have been able to swallow Jonah (who was only one person) with plenty of room to spare.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Hashem used the technology of the TARDIS to make the inside of the dog bigger than the outside. He also used the Star Trek replicator technology to provide food and water for the three days. When it was time for Yonah to be released, he used a transporter to put him ashore near Nineveh.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From the creation we learn:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וירדו בדגת הים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The dogs of the seas have dominion.  These are very special dogs, not like the ordinary ones that walk on land.  We know that this is so because when God sought to destroy His creation He did it through a <em>flood</em>, which the sea-dogs wouldn't care about because they live in the sea but other dogs were affected.  </p>\n\n<p>These special sea-dogs, like the Levyitan, are huge, the better to assert their dominion with -- such as by swallowing up errant prophets whole.  Like their lesser brethren on land who did not sound the alarm during the Exodus, the sea-dogs are kind to Yisrael; the one who swallowed Yonah did not harm him and provided him a safe place to contemplate his errors for three days.</p>\n\n\n",

Refael gets the same mention in the same sources. Besides for Samael (aka Satan aka Malach Hamaves aka Yetzer Hara), Gavriel seems to be the only one who ever does anything. </p>\n\n<p>My question is twofold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why Gavriel?</li>\n<li>Out of these sources, almost none of them actually mention Gavriel in the original Pesukim (where the event actually took place in the times of Tanach). How do Chazal know that it was Gavriel in these instances? Is there a pattern by which they can deduce Gavriel’s involvement, or is it just tradition?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Gevurah is generally understood to mean restraint. Like the strength it takes parents to watch their toddler fall on her rump, because that's the only way she'll learn how to walk. Rushing in to help isn't always the best choice. Which is why Qabbalah portrays Gevurah as being in dialectic tension with Chessed. Hashem is \"Gomeil chassadim tovim -- supports us through good instances of chessed\", but \"stands back\" with Gevurah when the chessed wouldn't be tov. (See Zohar, Naso 267; although the toddler metaphor is mine.) </p>\n\n<p>Hashem's general rule with people is to give us room to make our own history. Only stepping in rarely, and usually in ways that still leaves us some room for free will. (Maharal, Chiddushei Aggados, Sotah 33)</p>\n\n<p>And so, Gavriel -- G-d's Gevurah -- typifies most of His interaction with people. Notice how many items on your Gavriel list were stepping in after He let us make a mistake.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas Mikhael -- Who is Like G-d? -- is employed when nature is violated in an obvious way, such as in your Mikhael example, when a woman decades past menopause gets pregnant. (Whereas Refa'el came with, as did Mikhael to punish Sodom, Amora and the other cities of the planes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>A good question and a surprising answer:</p>\n\n<p><strong>It's the other way around</strong>!

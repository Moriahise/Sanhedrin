The city of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baalbek\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baalbek</a>, which was originally a Baal center of worship, eventually became a center of Bacchus (Dionysus to the Greeks) worship. On this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_C._Steiner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Richard C. Steiner</a> wrote in the essay \"<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25610200?seq=1#?seq=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">On the Rise and Fall of Canaanite Religion at Baalbek: A Tale of Five Toponyms</a>\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Residual effects of the cult of Bacchus, with its wine-drinking rituals and competitions can perhaps be seen in a medieval descritption of Baalbek. In the introduction to his geographical treatise (tenth century C.E.), al-Muqaddasi writes: \"There are no greater drinkers of wine(s) than the people of Baalbek and Egypt.\"...It is hard to imagine a closer phonetic match than that between Ba'labakku and Ba'al-Bacchus...Since Hadad-Baal and Bacchus-Dionysus are both fertility gods portrayed (frequently) with bull horns, syncretism between Hadad-Baal and Bacchus-Dionysus is by no means unnatural. Indeed, Julius Wellhausen seems to have viewed this syncretism as self-evident, speaking of \"Baal-Dionysus\" and \"the Baal whom the Greeks identified with Dionysus.\"...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's possible that Rambam was referring to this syncretism between the Baal of Baalbek and Bacchus.</p>\n<p>About the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysian_Mysteries\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bacchian Mysteries</a> worship, it says <a href=\"https://oxfordre.com/classics/classics/abstract/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-8126?rskey=3PoJYe&result=12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A metrical lex sacra of a Bacchic association in Smyrna prohibits people from eating the heart and the meat of an animal that has not been sacrificed.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here it sounds like that indeed the heart was removed prior to sacrificing the animal.</p>\n<p>A more detailed study of the text can be seen <a href=\"http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/%7Esgcole/cole/dionysos/Ionia/smyrna.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. According to that study, there seems to have been a number of heart-related rituals. One may have been \"the heart seems to have been cut out of the victim separately, placed on the altar, and sprinkled with fat or blood\". Another perhaps was \"a sacrifice of a ram and goat to Dionysos Zagreus, where the heart was not eaten, but taken away\".</p>\n<p>So it's possible that the mishnah was referring to a Bacchian or Dionysian ritual, which the Rambam related to Baalim, a later evolution/syncretism of that type of worship that was still known about circa the Rambam's time.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n<p>It seems I was correct in terms of connecting this to Dionysus/Bacchus. Prof. Emmanuel Friedheim likewise noted in his doctoral thesis \"Pagans and Paganism in Eretz Yisrael in the Talmudic Literature - Historical Aspects\" (in Hebrew), p. 159:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Another source, on the other hand, speaks about ripping out hearts while the animal is still dying, and that is from the mythology of the baby Dionysus (<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/clementofalexand00clem/page/38/mode/2up?q=heart%20of%20dionysus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Clement of Alexandria, Protempt, p. 38</a>). Also from the iconography related to the mystery rituals of Dionysus one can occasionally find images showing a priest stabbing an animal in the heart, and that is what causes the beast to die...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Most opinions hold that he did complete Teshuva.</p>\n<p>However,The Tosfos Yeshanim Yoma 38B,  asks a similar question to the one being asked here; How can we use the name Yishmael if based on the Gemora Sanhedrin  mentioned in this question he was a Rasha? He answers that  since Hashem was the one to choose and make the name Yishmael it is used despite the way he turned out. He seems to be reaching the conclusion that according to that Gemara, Yismoal indeed never did complete Teshuva.</p>\n<p>Rashi on Chumash brings down the Medrash of Yismael doing Teshuva, yet Rashi also (Megilah 17A) refers to him as a Rasha.</p>\n<p>According to those that he remained a Rasha he must have done Teshuva for <em>some</em> things as the Midrash says. But not all.So in one sense yes he did Teshuva. But in other areas he remained a Rasha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Akiva Eiger (Gilion hashas baba basra 16b) brings the Toras Chaim who asks on the gemara in Sanhedrin 104a that why did Yishmael need saving if he did teshuva. However the Reishonim in Yuma 38b imply that the gemara in Sanhedrin held Yishmael didn't do Teshuva. Therefore it's a machlokes whether Yishmael did teshuva or not. I've seen Rav Yehonasan Eibshitz say that the gemara in Pesachim 119b holds Yishmael didn't do Teshuva. On the haga they comment it's not neccessary to say that, but rather it's reffering to the nation of Yishmael. Since that nation came out of him, Avraham wouldn't be allowed to bless.</p>\n<p>Regarding the drasha in Baba Basra that mentions Yitschak before Yishmael implying that Yishmael did teshuva, I've seen in the chumash Hagra that he explains the pasuk according to the one that holds Yishmael didn't do Teshuva.  He explains the pasuk mentions Yitschak first because he was the ben hagvira and Yishmael was the son of the maid. However I think you can explain differently based off the Gur Aryeh. The Gur Aryeh asks on Rashi what's the proof Yishmael did Teshuva, maybe he allowed Yitschak to go first because he was giving honor to the ben Hagvira (see there what he answers). I think that's what the Midrash Rabba is saying on this pasuk.The medrash says from here the son of the maid gave honor to the ben hagvira, implying that Yishmael didn't do teshuva.</p>\n<p>There is some more gemaras that might need to be answered up, however I won't address them now, because they weren't mentioned in the question. Also the Bear Bisadeh tries to reconcile the gemara in Sanhedrin with Yishmael doing teshuva but I don't remember where he is. However probably he didn't see the reishonim in Yuma.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>The world works according to the laws of nature. One of these laws is that acts has consequences. Whether or not G-d forgives, the consequences do not go away. Thus he was punished. (David also repented) but that did not remove the consequences of their acts.</p>\n\n\n",

The Sadducees make the mistake of thinking that the count of the omer must start on the Sunday following the first day of Passover (the 15th of Nisan) rather than the day after Passover (the 16th of Nisan) as we did from the beginning. The article compounds this error by pretending that not only does this mean that the 16th of Nisan must occur on Sunday every year, but that this error is extended to every month. This of course is total garbage and has never been part of any calendar, not even that used by any sectarian during the past.</p>\n<p>One of the obvious errors is a misquote from the mythology of John that in that year the Passover was on the Sabbath and pretends that it is saying that every year has the first day of Passover occurring on the Sabbath.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong></p>\n<p>You have misunderstood the calendar. The days of the week are based on the days of creation. Thus the first day of the week is counted from then with the seventh day on which Hashem <em>rested</em> we have the seventh day. Each week continues from that point every seven days. The month on the other hand is based on the cycles of the moon. At each new moon the day of the month is counted as one no matter what day of the week it may occur. The cycle of the moon is approximately 29.5 days. Thus each new month would start one or two days later in the week. Av is 30 days. For example The first of Av this year (5780) was Wednesday July 22. The first of Elul will be Friday August 21.</p>\n<p>Since most years are not evenly divisable by 7, the new year would be be on a different day of the week each year.</p>\n\n\n",

According to this view, one who is expected to live only for a short while is forbidden to engage in a medical procedure if there is a chance greater than fifty percent that the medical procedure might kill him immediately, even though there is a chance that the procedure might completely heal him.  The Chatam Sofer (Teshuvot Y.D. 76, cited in the Pitchei Teshuva Y.D.  155:1) seems to agree with this ruling.  Rav Chaim Ozer Grodzinsky (Teshuvot Achiezer ad.  loc.), however, disagrees and permits a patient to assume an even greater risk than fifty percent in the hope to achieve a longer life.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This view of the Mishnas Chachomim is also supported by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Waldenberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Eliezer Waldenberg</a> in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14509&st=&pgnum=130&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvos Tzitz Eliezer (10:25:5:5)</a></p>\n<p>He then mentions the Rav Moshe cited above that one may take the risk but then writes however, that Rav Moshe wrote elsewhere in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14677&st=&pgnum=271&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igros Moshe, Yoreh Deah 3:36</a> that he is more inclined to the opinion of the Mishnas Chachamim, concluding that we cannot protest if one wishes to rely upon the ruling of Rav Chaim Ozer and assume a very great risk to Chayei Shaah.</p>\n\n\n",

Do we say that just because there are 600,000 people travelling on it during the work week it retains its status as a Reshus Harabbim even thought there aren't 600,000 people travelling on it on Shabbos?</p>\n<p>What about the opposite- if there are only 600,000 people travelling on it on Shabbos but most days there aren't 600,000 people travelling on it? Do we go by Shabbos or the majority of days?</p>\n<p>(I know that this question is only relevant according to the opinions that 600,000 people travelling in it is a necessity in order to be a Reshus Harabbim.

The pasuk over there expressly calls her the nurse of Rivka.</p>\n<p>It would make sense to assume that she was sent at the time to care for Rivka, owing to the fact that Rivka got married at such a young age. Indeed the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.59?lang=bi&with=Targum%20Jonathan%20on%20Genesis&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Yonasan</a> translates the word 'מֵֽנִקְתָּ֑הּ' - 'nurse' as פַּדְגְוָותָהּ stemming from the word 'pedagogy', meaning to say that her role was that of an educator. Moreover, this relationship was one of care and not of servitude like that of a 'shifcha' - maidservant like you ask. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.59?lang=bi&with=Shadal&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shadal</a> writes on the pasuk 24:59:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מנקתה: בימים הקדמונים (ראב\"ע), ונראה שהיו המיניקות נשארות בבתי העשירים אצל יונקותיהן (גם אחר שגדלו) באהבה ורעות, ולא שלחו המינקת לשמשה כשפחה, כי כבר שלחו עמה גם נערותיה (פסוק ס\"א).</p>\n<p><em>Her nurse: In the early days, it appears that nurses remained in the houses of the wealthy by their infants (even after they grew up) with love and friendship. And they didn't send the nurses to serve like maidservants because they had already sent with her her lads.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem from this explanation that she definitely was not serving in a 'shifcha' capacity but rather maintained an ongoing relationship with Rivka by virtue of being hired by a wealthy home.</p>\n<p>This loyalty continued to the end of her life. If we return to the pasuk that I started with in which the Torah quotes her death. Rashi tells us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותמת דבורה. מָה עִנְיַן דְּבוֹרָה בְּבֵית יַעֲקֹב? אֶלָּא לְפִי שֶׁאָמְרָה רִבְקָה לְיַעֲקֹב וְשָׁלַחְתִּי וּלְקַחְתִּיךָ מִשָּׁם, שָׁלְחָה דְבוֹרָה אֶצְלוֹ לְפַדַּן אֲרָם לָצֵאת מִשָּׁם, וּמֵתָה בַדֶּרֶךְ; מִדִּבְרֵי רַבִּי מֹשֶׁה הַדַּרְשָׁן לְמַדְתִּיהָ:</p>\n<p><em>AND DEBORAH DIED — How came Deborah to be in Jacob’s house? But the explanation is: because Rebékah had promised Jacob (Gen. 27:45) “then I will send and fetch thee from thence”, she sent Deborah to him to Padan-aram to tell him to leave that place, and she died on the return journey I learnt this from a comment of R. Moses Ha-darshan.</em> (sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Rivka after sending Yaakov away from home to flee an enraged Eisav, is now fulfilling her promise to notify Yaakov that the time was now right for him to return home (Also refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.35.8?lang=bi&with=Chizkuni&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a>). Hence, the ever dutiful Devorah right to the end, is in the service of Rivka as she and the household of Yaakov make their return to her mistress Rivka.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To complement Dov's answer, <a href=\"https://shiratdevorah.blogspot.com/2011/12/other-devorah.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this page</a> quotes two divrei Torah on the subject, the first from R' Yissocher Frand and the second from R' Azarya Berzon (although I have a vague memory of reading, in one of Rav Frand's books, something akin to that second one).</p>\n<p>Key points from the first one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yaakov was most reluctant to leave the house of Yitzchak and Rivka... Rivka promised \"I will take you back and I will restore to you what you lost spiritually in the years you were away.\"</p>\n<p>To accomplish such a mission, one cannot send a young kid. On such a mission, one must send a \"great grandmother.\" To restore the idea of what the House of Yitzchak was like in Yaakov's mind, it was necessary to send someone from the older generation. The person who grew up in yesteryear presents an untarnished image. They come from the \"old home.\" Unlike the \"younger generation,\" they represent \"the way it is supposed to be.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and from the second:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apparently, there was an underground movement in Charan which preached Avraham's morality and circulated his teachings. Rivka belonged to that movement... But who was the leader? Who was the teacher?</p>\n<p>The leader was Devorah...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Where do we find a source for such a concept?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>He spent 60% of the shiur bringing sources for eulogizing sheimos. mentioned several sources:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A Kal V'Chomer: The Rosh says “מכבד כל מי שפתח לך פתח לבקש די סיפוקך\" \"These sofrim which we have buried today have opened up a pesach for us to pursue our needs in Torah and mitzvos. And, the Mishnah in bava metzia (2:11) says \". אֲבֵדַת אָבִיו וַאֲבֵדַת רַבּוֹ, שֶׁל רַבּוֹ קוֹדֶמֶת, שֶׁאָבִיו הֱבִיאוֹ לָעוֹלָם הַזֶּה, וְרַבּוֹ שֶׁלִּמְּדוֹ חָכְמָה מְבִיאוֹ לְחַיֵּי הָעוֹלָם הַבָּא.\"   If one found his father’s lost item and his teacher’s lost item, his teacher’s takes priority, for his father brought him into this world, but his teacher who taught him Torah brings him into the world to come.” So, if the Orchid Chaim L'Harosh says that you should give honor to anyone who opened up a doorway for you in matters of this world, all the more so to someone or something which opened up the doorway for you in matters of the world to come!</li>\n<li>“For sure the chiyuv (obligation) to be mechabed (honor) sheimos is very big, and we are are not allowed to be mevazeh(disgrace) them. It says in this week’s sedra (Torah portion, Deuteronomy 12:3) 'וְנִתַּצְתֶּ֣ם אֶת־מִזְבּחֹתָ֗ם וְשִׁבַּרְתֶּם֙ אֶת־מַצֵּ֣בֹתָ֔ם וַאֲשֵֽׁרֵיהֶם֙ תִּשְׂרְפ֣וּן בָּאֵ֔שׁ וּפְסִילֵ֥י אֱלֹֽהֵיהֶ֖ם תְּגַדֵּע֑וּן וְאִבַּדְתֶּ֣ם אֶת־שְׁמָ֔ם מִן־הַמָּק֖וֹם הַהֽוּא׃ 'Tear down their altars, smash their pillars, put their sacred posts to the fire, and cut down the images of their gods, obliterating their name from that site.' From here we learn out that a person is obligated to honor articles of holiness, devarim shebikedusha, And it is certainly not allowed to do anything to break them or or degrade them or do anything negative to them.\"</li>\n<li>Much of the sheimos came from the institutions of Torah education: tests, handouts, etc. They helped in the education and in shaping the next generation. For that they certainly deserve gratitude and tremendous honor. “So If we want to live in an a torahdike town (a town of torah), in an ehrliche town (an honest, sincere town), people that do mitzvos properly, we have to give the kavod to everything that helped to do this! Certainly, if we have seforim in the sheimos which fell apart because they were learned in them so much, then certainly we owe a great appreciation to these seforim.”</li>\n<li>He mentioned many halachos about giving respect to seforim. I assume he was saying that this is another form of respect. As it is reffered to in seforim, \"kavod haacharon\", \"the final respect\".</li>\n</ol>\n<p>He finished with a quote from the sefer mat’amim, page 140(couldn’t find the sefer on the Otzar Hachochma, so I am quoting from what I can make out from the recording):\nטעם למנהיג כשגונזים ספרים בלים וקרועים הן מספר תורה הן משאר ספרים, הולכים בהמון אל בית הקברות וגונזים שם בקרקע ועושים עליהם אוהל וסימן לידע ש(ינהגו?) (ב?)קדושה באותה מקום, והרב דורש, שעל פי רוב עושים זאת בעת המגפה, רחמנא ליצלן, והיא סגולה כדי לעורר רחמים בזה, כי כמו שאנו חסים על שמות ודברים שבקדושה, שלא ילכו לאיבוד, כן ירחם השם יתברך עלינו ועל בנינו שלא נלכו לאיבוד ולביזון כי גם אני משותפים בשמו הגדול: ישראל ואורייתא וקודשא בריך הוא חד הוא, ושמו משותף בינינו ואנו גם כן נקראים גוי קדוש, ואנו מבקשים מאת השמות הקדושים שירחמו עלינו בזכות שאנו מכבדים אותם.\nThe reason for the custom that when they bury seforim (Hebrew books) which are worn and torn, whether it be a Torah scroll or other seforim, they go as a large crowd to the cemetery and bury them there in the ground, and make a tent over them and a sign to (so that others should) know that they should (conduct themselves?) (with?) holiness at that place. And teacher expounds (obviously referring to someone specific, unclear from this excerpt who), that the majority of the time they do this <em><strong>in the time of a pandemic, may The Merciful One save us</strong></em>, and it is a segula (supernatural cure) in order to awaken Divine Mercy through this. Because, just like we are having compassion on the sheimos and articles of holiness – that they should go to destruction – so Hashem should have mercy on us and our children that we shouldn’t go to destruction and embarresment, because we too are partners with his holy name (just like the sheimos): The Jews and the Torah and The Holy One, Blessed Be Her are one, and his name is partnered among us, and we see are called a holy nation(i.e. we are called holy, just like “the articles of <em>holiness</em> and the sheimos are called holy), and we request from Hashem through these holy sheimos that He should have mercy on us in the merit that we are honoring them.</p>\n\n\n",

In fact, the <em>gemarra</em> there brings a dispute about this. <strong>Tosafos</strong> leave the matter as <em>tzarich iyun</em> how someone could say there's no <em>melacha</em> of trapping with a <em>Chilazon</em>.</p>\n<p>What is the reasoning behind this dispute? Does anyone offer suggestions? The <a href=\"https://www.dafyomi.co.il/shabbos/insites/sh-dt-075.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">only one I found</a> is from <strong>Rabbi Mordechai Kornfeld</strong> from the Kollel Iyun HaDaf. He suggests that the Bavli and the Yerushalmi are arguing about the identity of the <em>chilazon</em>. He doesn't mention this, but that would seemingly also make it the dispute in the Yerushalmi itself between the Tannaim. I find this approach unreasonable because the Tannaim and Amoraim and even Geonim had access to <em>techeiles</em>, so they seemingly should know the identity of the <em>chilazon</em> and not argue about it. Also, saying it's a dispute calls into question the characteristics the Bavli suggests for identifying the <em>chilazon</em>, as the Yerushalmi could be right about its identity and not the Bavli.</p>\n<p>In any event, what's the reason for the dispute?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40741&st=&pgnum=108\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">See the Korban HaEida there</a> who suggests that that opinion means to say that trapping is never a melacha on Shabbos. The reason it is said in the context of chilazon is to prove that trapping was unnecessary in the Mishkan, and thus is not an av melacha.</p>\n<p>None of the animals that were used in the Mishkan required trapping; they were either domestic animals or supernatural (i.e. the tachash, which was given directly to Moshe and did not need to be trapped). Thus, the only trapping that could have occurred in the Mishkan would be the chilazon.</p>\n<p>According to this rendering, the dispute in the Yerushalmi is if they trapped chilazons in the desert. This opinion holds that they did not have the chilazon in the desert, as it was only found in Eretz Yisroel, and therefore trapping never occurred in the Mishkan. Hence, no trapping would be a melacha, not just a chilazon.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershon_Henoch_Leiner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radziner Rebbe</a> addresses this Yerushalmi in his landmark <em>kuntres</em> on <em>techeiles</em>, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41312&st=&pgnum=28\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sefunei Temunei Chol</em></a>.</p>\n<p>He explains the opinion in the Yerushalmi that exempts a person for trapping the <em>chilazon</em> as follows. He says it's only necessary to trap the <em>chilazon</em> while it's in the sea. However, the <em>gemarra</em> says that it sometimes goes up mountains. When it's there, it's considered already trapped, as it's easily accessible. He argues that while the Jews were in the wilderness, constructing the <em>Mishkan</em>, the <em>chilazon</em> was miraculously brought there. While on land, it doesn't require trapping.</p>\n<p>Since when the Jews built the <em>Mishkan</em>, it wasn't necessary to trap the <em>chilazon</em>, therefore even later on in history, when it is necessary to trap it while it is in the sea, there's no violation of Shabbos. This opinion holds that only other animals, that weren't involved in the <em>Mishkan</em>, would then be forbidden to trap on Shabbos. This is learned from the <em>Tachash</em>, which although it was created miraculously when the Jews were in the wilderness, it still required trapping on their part.</p>\n<p>The opposing opinion in the Yerushalmi, as well as the opinion mentioned in the Bavli, which says there is a violation of trapping the <em>chilazon</em>, simply holds the <em>chilazon</em> is no different than any other animal. Since there are times where it is necessary to trap it, namely while it is in the sea, at those times it is forbidden.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6735&st=&pgnum=29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos Aharon</a> (Rov of pinsk 18 century) completely rejects the Korban Haeda (brought in the other answer) who is suggesting that the Yerushalmi holds there is no Melacha of <em>Tzod</em> (i.e only 38 Melachos) which is against the Mishna Shabbos 7,2 that clearly enumerates <em>Tzod Tzvi</em> as one of the 39 Melachos.</p>\n<p>The Tosfos Aharon suggests an alternative explanation according to the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=1336\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam 10,19</a> who says that one who captures kosher locusts to eat is exempt from <em>Tzod</em> as <em>ein bemino nitzod</em> - it is not a common type of animal to capture. So too with <em>Chilazon</em> as useful as it was, it is very uncommon to catch (indeed it rose to the surface once every 70 years and was very expensive). The Yerushalmi brings this opinion that we only learn the <em>av melacha</em> of <em>tzod</em> - capturing - from the capturing of the <em>Tachash</em> which was made readily available to Moshe specifically at that time, unlike the chilazon which was extremely scarce when required and therefore not included in the <em>melacha</em> of tzod -capturing easily available animals.</p>\n\n\n",

The list is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אשר יצר • ברכת אלוהי נשמה • ברכות השחר • ברכת החמה • ברכת הלבנה • ברכת\nמשנה הבריות • ברכת האילנות • ברכת הגומל • הטוב והמיטיב • ברכת הנסים •\nשהחיינו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.breslevmeir.com/%d7%91%d7%a8%d7%9b%d7%aa-%d7%90%d7%a9%d7%a8-%d7%99%d7%a6%d7%a8/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breslevmeir.com</a> describes the berocho as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ברכת אשר יצר היא ברכת הודאה ושבח להשם יתברך,על החכמה הנפלאה בבריאת\nגופו של האדם.כי מכונה נפלאה זו של הגוף והנפש עובדות רק בעזרת השם יתברך</p>\n<p>The blessing is a blessing of acknowledgement and praise to G-d, may\nHe be blessed, for the wonderful wisdom in the creation of the body of\nman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your question is treated halachically by <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/ask/98474\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הרב יצחק בן יוסף atYeshiva.org.il</a> which writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בנוגע להוצאה ידי חובה, השאלה תלויה בדיון בין הפוסקים: האם ברכת \"אשר\nיצר\" מוגדרת בקטגוריית ברכת השבח לבורא או ברכת הנהנין? אם ברכת \"אשר\nיצר\" נחשבת ברכת השבח, יכול אדם לברך ולהוציא את חברו ידי חובה. לעומת\nזאת אם הברכה נחשבת לברכת הנהנין אינו יכול להוציא את חברו. לדיון זה יש\nהשלכה נוספת: האם צריך לברך ברכה זו בעמידה? אם היא ברכת הנהנין מותר\nלברך בישיבה, ואם היא ברכת השבח צריך לברך בעמידה. למעשה פוסקים בכל אחת\nמהשאלות לחומרה: המברך אינו יכול להוציא את חברו בברכתו, ויש לברך\nבעמידה.</p>\n<p>Regarding the obligation to bless, the question depends on the\ndiscussion between the Poskim: Is the blessing \"אשר יצר\" defined as a\nblessing of praise to the Creator or as a blessing of enjoyment?</p>\n<p>If the blessing of \"who created\" is considered the blessing of praise,\na person can bless and acquit his friend of his duty. On the other\nhand if the blessing is a blessing of enjoyment he cannot acquit his\nfriend.</p>\n<p>This discussion has another implication: Should this blessing be\ngreeted standing up? If it is a blessing of enjoyment it can be said\nsitting, and if it is a blessing of praise it  should be said\nstanding.</p>\n<p>In fact, each of the questions is decided strictly: one cannot acquit\nhis friend  and one must say it standing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary, at first sight (Wikipedia and  Breslevmeir.com) it seems to be a blessing of praise. But it is treated halachically as having both the characteristics of a  blessing of praise (must be said standing) and the characteristics of a  blessing of enjoyment  (cannot acquit his friend).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>So after researching a bit - I came across this from Rabbi Aryeh Lebowitz <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/792230/Rabbi_Aryeh_Lebowitz/Ten_Minute_Halacha_-_The_Beracha_of_Asher_Yatzar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It would seem that Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach zt\"l raises my question. It brings in the <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/en/book/book.php?book=84639&width=-17&scroll=0&udid=15972291474024012&pagenum=54\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sefer Siach Halocho, siman 6, se'if koton 4</a> that Rav Shlomo Zalman draws the conclusion that the nafka minah like @AvrohomYitzchok says, is whether one can be motzi his friend.</p>\n<p>There appear to be two diametrically opposed proofs.</p>\n<p><strong>PROOF 1:</strong>\nIn <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.6.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 6:10</a> it says that if a shaliach tzibbur starts bircas hashachar and then he realises that he has already said it at home (including saying asher yatzar) and he hasn't been to the bathroom since - he can get someone else to say asher yatzer on his and the tzibbur's behalf. However the notion of having someone else saying for another person does not work for bircas hane'enin, e.g. if a person wants to eat an apple and his friend doesn't. That friend cannot say the borei pri ha'etz on the first person's behalf. However, with bircas hashevach this would work and so this would lead us to believe that Asher Yatzar is indeed a bircas hashevach.</p>\n<p>However, proof 1 would only ring true for the first asher yatzar of the day, but what about the subsequent ones - does it then turn into bircas hane'enin?</p>\n<p><strong>PROOF 2:</strong> If a person didn't say asher yatzar and then when he remembers he then need to go again, the halacha is that you don't say a new bracha. If we say it is a bircas hashevach then this doesn't work as in the same way one thanks Hashem once, he then thanks Hashem again. But if it is a bircas hane'enin then the benefit went away because the person needs to go to the bathroom again, and therefore the one bircas hane'enin is going to be motzi both of them.</p>\n<p>So it would seem that it is not clear cut.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Other gods or gods of others?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have recently noted that the phrase אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים is consistently translated by Artscroll as <em>gods of others,</em> suggesting a construct state or <em>semikhut.</em> However, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/14850/joel-k\">Joel K</a> pointed out, the construct state would be אֱלֹהֵי אֲחֵרִים. The choice of <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0513.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JPS</a> is the more simple noun phrase with an adjective: <em>other gods.</em> I checked <a href=\"http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/freimann/content/pageview/1901714\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Hirsch</a>, and he also wrote <em>andern Göttern</em> (other gods). Both versions assumes the existence of false idols, so from a philosophic perspective it seems to be the same. What sources support the <em>semikhut</em> version of Artscroll?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>It's from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Exodus.20.3.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi, Shemos 20:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלהים אחרים. שֶׁאֵינָן אֱלוֹהוּת אֶלָּא אֲחֵרִים עֲשָׂאוּם אֱלֹהִים עֲלֵיהֶם, וְלֹא יִתָּכֵן לְפָרֵשׁ אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים זוּלָתִי, שֶׁגְּנַאי כְּלַפֵּי מַעְלָה לִקְרֹאותָם אֱלוֹהוּת אֶצְלוֹ...</p>\n<p>OTHER GODS — which are not gods, but others have made them gods over themselves. It would not be correct to explain this to mean “gods other than Me”, for it would be blasphemy of the Most High God to term them gods together with Him (cf. Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 20:3:1)...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi's source, Mechilta d'Rabbi Yishmael, says the same but in different phrasing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...ומה תלמוד לומר \"אלהים אחרים\"? אלא שאחרים קוראין אותם אלוהות</p>\n<p>...What, then, is the intent of \"other gods\"? That others call \"gods.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Each of those sources does present other explanations as well.)</p>\n<p>About the fact that (as Joel K pointed out) the expected form would then be אלהי אחרים: we do find in a lot of places where a regular form is used instead of a construct one. Examples include הארון הברית (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.3.14?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehoshua 3:14</a>) and העם המלחמה‎ (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.8.11?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:11</a>). Closer to our case, we have אלהים צבאות, which Radak, at least, says means אלהים אלהי הצבאות, \"G-d, the G-d of hosts\" (i.e., that in his view צבאות isn't one of the Divine names, even though halachah considers it as such). See, for example, his commentary to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Psalms.80.5.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 80:5</a>, and in more detail <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Psalms.80.15.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. verse 15</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This translation is probably (ultimately) based on an opinion brought in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta_d%27Rabbi_Yishmael.20.3.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mekhilta 20:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכי אלוהות הן? ... אלא שאחרים קוראין אותם אלוהות</p>\n<p>Are they in fact gods? ...

The Gemara asks: What is the meaning of: The second day? If we say that this is referring to the second day of the Festival day of Rosh HaShana, is that to say that they rendered Elul a full month, so that the thirtieth day of Elul was the first day of Rosh HaShana and the first day of Tishrei was the second day? But didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana say: From the days of Ezra onward we have not found that the month of Elul was ever rendered full. Rav Ḥisda said: What is the meaning of: The second day? It means on the second day, the next time it was Rosh HaShana, i.e., on Rosh HaShana of the following year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why doesn't the Gemara simply answer that that year it was necessary to add a day to Elul, as the Gemara says on 19b? This Gemara on 32a seems to be taking Rav Chinana's statement literally, and there never were Eluls with thirty days. How can these Gemaras be reconciled?</p>\n\n\n",

But even this isn't right, surely, because when it comes to tumah, public/ private areas are defined not by whether or not anyone <em>is</em> around but whether or not it's the sort of place where people might <em>generally</em> be around.

    "content": "# Does the fact that \"Elohim\" is plural indicate that parts of the Tanakh hearken from a pre-Jewish polytheistic culture?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>(disclaimer, I am a gentile and don't know how to type in square script)</p>\n<p>My question applies to the whole Tanakh, but I'm specifically curious about Genesis. Translating strictly literally (ie, etymologically), Genesis 1-3 seem to indicate some sort of polytheism. The Hebrew etymologically translates as \"the <strong>gods</strong> said let <strong>us</strong> make man in <strong>our</strong> image\", and such plural language recurs pointedly throughout the book.</p>\n<p>I'm just wondering what sort of Jewish reflection there has been on this scriptural phenomena? What do the Rabbis (both ancient and modern) say and what sorts of official histories/explanations are put forward? At face value, Genesis seems to be an ancient text produced by a polytheistic culture, and later reinterpreted in line with Monotheism. I'm wondering what opinions and explanations have been put forward by the Jewish tradition itself. So far I have only read Christian theories (which inevitably read the Trinity in) and Academic theories (which double down on the \"polytheism\" hypothesis)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 27)\n\n<p>The reason this is confusing is that in Biblical Hebrew, the plural can be used to denote a position of authority. For example, in Exodus 22 the Bible refers to a property owner in the plural even though from context there is only one person. See specifically <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.22.10?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 22:10</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שְׁבֻעַ֣ת יְהוָ֗ה תִּהְיֶה֙ בֵּ֣ין שְׁנֵיהֶ֔ם אִם־לֹ֥א שָׁלַ֛ח יָד֖וֹ בִּמְלֶ֣אכֶת רֵעֵ֑הוּ וְלָקַ֥ח <strong>בְּעָלָ֖יו</strong> וְלֹ֥א יְשַׁלֵּֽם׃<br />\nan oath before the LORD shall decide between the two of them that the one has not laid hands on the property of the other; the owner must acquiesce, and no restitution shall be made.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From context it is clear there are only two people, but the verse still says בעליו, which is a combination of בעל, meaning owner, and the suffix יו, which is plural possessive.</p>\n<p>Another example with the word Elohim specifically comes from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.7.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&ven=The_Rashi_chumash_by_Rabbi_Shraga_Silverstein&lang=bi&with=Translations&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 7:1</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהוָה֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה רְאֵ֛ה נְתַתִּ֥יךָ <strong>אֱלֹהִ֖ים</strong> לְפַרְעֹ֑ה וְאַהֲרֹ֥ן אָחִ֖יךָ יִהְיֶ֥ה נְבִיאֶֽךָ׃<br />\nAnd the L-rd said to Moses: See, I have made you an <strong>overlord</strong> to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother shall be your spokesman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, Moses was one person, but the plural Elohim is still used.</p>\n<p>Yet another example comes from a case of idol worship. By the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bekhor_Shor%2C_Exodus.32.4.2?lang=en&p2=Exodus.32.4&ven2=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang2=bi&aliyot2=0&w2=Translations&lang3=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Golden Calf</a> the plural is also used to describe one idol</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּקַּ֣ח מִיָּדָ֗ם וַיָּ֤צַר אֹתוֹ֙ בַּחֶ֔רֶט וַֽיַּעֲשֵׂ֖הוּ עֵ֣גֶל מַסֵּכָ֑ה וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ אֵ֤לֶּה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר הֶעֱל֖וּךָ מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃<br />\nAnd he received the gold at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it a molten calf: and they said, These are thy gods, O Yisra᾽el, which brought thee up out of the land of Miżrayim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When it comes to pronouns, sometimes they are also plural to grammatically match the noun in the verse, as in the last example, and sometimes they are singular to match the reality. Hebrew is a very flexible language, and there are often multiple ways to say the same thing that are all grammatically correct.</p>\n<p>In regard to the case Let Us Make Man, the simplest explanation is that this is the royal we, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.26?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=HaKtav_VeHaKabalah%2C_Genesis.1.26.1-2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">see here</a> and in the commentary of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.26?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashbam_on_Genesis.1.26&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashbam</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נעשה אדם - כמו שמצינו במיכיהו בן ימלא במלכים, ובישעיה: את מי אשלח ומי ילך לנו, וגם באיוב.<br />\n“Let us make man” – like we find with Michayahu ben Yimla in Kings, and in Yeshayahu, “Who shall I send, who will go for us”, and also in Job.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are also deeper meanings, just as every verse has layers of meaning, but the deeper layers cannot and do not contradict the fundamental of our faith, that G-d is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.1.26.1?ven=Pentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann&lang=en&p2=Deuteronomy.6.4&ven2=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang2=en&aliyot2=0&w2=Translations&lang3=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">one</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hear, O Yisra᾽el: The Lord our God; the Lord is one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>R. Judah Halevi addresses this in Part IV of the Kuzari:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The word has a plural form, because it was so used by gentile idolaters, who believed that every deity was invested with astral and other powers. Each of these was called Eloah; their united forces were therefore, called Elohim.</p>\n<p>(Hirschfeld translation p. 198)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it’s not that it was written by a polytheistic culture, but that it was written against the backdrop of a polytheistic culture.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Often I see ignorant skeptics of the Torah as using this argument to \"prove\" that Judaism adopted terms from polytheism, but this not at all the case.</p>\n<p>The reason why Elohim ends with \"-Im\", (which <em>usually</em> implies a plurality) is because \"-Im\" is used in this instance in a respective, majestic form.</p>\n<p>(the following is a rephrased summary from Isaac Troki's book against christianity, Chizuk Emuna chapter 9)</p>\n<p>Genesis 1:1, \"In the beginning Elohim [God] created the heaven and the earth.\" Elohim, ending in a plural form as though it meant Gods, has been interpreted by Christians as an evidence of the plurality in the Deity, consisting of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who are denominated Trinity. The correct terminology of Elohim is as follows: —</p>\n<p>Those who know the Hebrew language are aware that Elohim relates not merely to the Supreme Being, but also to angels and human authorities. Manoah, the father of Samson (mentioned in Judges 13:22), after he found that he had perceived \"an angel of the Lord,\" said, \"We shall surely die, for we have seen Elohim.\" In reference to human authorities, we read in Exodus 22:9, \"Before the Elohim [judges] the cause of the two men shall be brought, and he, whom the Elohim [judges] shall declare guilty, shall pay twofold unto his neighbour.\"</p>\n<p>We should like to understand how the name of Elohim.....in Exodus 7:1 \"Behold I have made you an Elohim to Pharaoh,\" can be allowed by Christian expounders to allude to a plurality of persons, and represent in a mortal creature a visible Trinity?</p>\n<p>The real object in the plural form in Elohim is to <em>represent authority and power</em>. This respective plurality is not just used for Elohim, but in words of profane signification. For an example, Adonim (lords) instead of Adon (lord). For instance, Isaiah 19:4, \"In the hand of a hard Adonim [lord, literally lords], Genesis 39:20, \"And the Adonai [lords instead of Adon, Lord] took him, viz., Joseph,\"</p>\n<p>The plural form is used instead of the singular in many modern languages (for instance you instead of thou).</p>\n\n\n",

He then asks your question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש לברר האם צער בעלי חיים הוא גדר של מצות שבין אדם למקום, וכמו בל\nתשחית שהוא  שלא להשחית מה שעשה הקב\"ה, כך איסור צער בעלי חיים הוא שלא\nלצער. או שזה כמו הלכות שבין אדם  לחברו ועיקרו הפן המוסרי של המעשה</p>\n<p>It must be ascertained whether animal cruelty is an aspect of מצות\nשבין אדם למקום, and just as one may not destroy what G-d made, so the\nprohibition of animal cruelty is not to cause suffering. Or is it like\nthe laws between a person and his friend and it is essentially the\nmoral aspect of the act which is forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, the more ZBC is like  בל תשחית, it is בין אדם למקום and the more there is a moral aspect, it is like בין אדם  לחברו.</p>\n<p>He brings various sources tending both ways and concludes regarding animal experimentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ניסויים שלא כרוכים בהריגה, נראה שיש שתי גישות. מתוס' ע\"ז רואים שלא כל\nצורך מתיר, ולכן אף אם אין  בל תשחית עדיין יש איסור צער בעלי חיים.\nואילו התוס' בבבא מציעא משוים ונראה לכן שמקילים יותר. כיוצא בזה מחלוקת\nהאחרונים האם הרמ\"א באה\"ע התיר רק משום צורך או גם לרווח ממוני (וכן\nנוהגים שהרי  מפטמים אווזים וכיו\"ב). לדעת התוס' בע\"ז נראה שיש לחוש לצער\nבעלי חיים אף כשיש צורך ואם כן יש לשקול את התועלת של  המחקר לעומת הצער.\nואף דבר שמותר על פי ההלכה, יש לשקול את הפן המוסרי כמו כתב הנודע ביהודה\nלגבי ציד.</p>\n<p>For experiments that are not linked to killing the animal there are\ntwo approaches. From Tosefos in Avodoh Zoroh we say that not every\nneed permits ZBC and that even if there is no possibility of  בל\nתשחית, there would still be a prohibition of ZBC. The Tosefos in Bovo\nMetzioh compares ZBC and בל תשחית and would be more lenient.  There is\na corresponding argument amongst the later authorities as to whether\nthe Rema permits only cases of need or allows even ZBC for profit.\nAccording to  Tosefos in Avodoh Zoroh even where there is need it is\nnecessary to take care with ZBC and weigh the benefit of the pain\nagainst the value of the research. And even where something is\npermitted according to halocho, the moral aspect should be considered\nas the Nodeh BiYehudah says regarding hunting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The situation is not clear-cut but it seems that there is a slight majority view in favour of the moral aspect which would categorise the mitzvah as  בין אדם  לחברו.</p>\n\n\n",

The will, however, expressed in the word of God signifies the essence of the thing, and is at the same time His script. Imagine a silk weaver considering his work[.] The silk obeys him, accepts the colours and patterns which he has contrived. The garment therefore comes into existence by his will and design. If we were able when speaking of, or drawing a human figure, to produce a human form, then we should have the word of God in our power and could create, just as we are able to do partially in forming objects in the mind. Spoken or written words have certain advantages over each other. In some cases the name fits the object exactly; in others less so.</p>\n<p>The language created by God, which He taught Adam and placed on his tongue and in his heart, is without any doubt the most perfect and most fitted to express the things specified, as it is written: 'And whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof' (Genesis 2:19). This means that it deserved such name which fitted and characterized it. This shows the excellence of the 'holy tongue' as well as the reason why the angels employed it in preference to any other. Writing is judged from a similar point of view. The shapes of the letters are not the result of accident, but of a device which is in harmony with the character of each letter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was directed to this source by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%98%D7%91%D7%A2_%D7%90%D7%95_%D7%94%D7%A1%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>, which also notes that the Rambam (Guide to the Perplexed 2:30) holds the opposite position, that language is conventional, and derives it from the exact same verse.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Shaar hsyichud veemunah, Tanya book 2, chapter one mainly, references a teaching from the Baal Shem Tov that the Hebrew name for an object gives life to it, and constantly brings it into existence.

In all instances, the Divine life-force which created a particular creature must constantly be vested within it, incessantly creating and vivifying it anew, just as it ceaselessly recreates the heavenly firmament, as shall soon be explained.</p>\n<p>כי אילו היו האותיות מסתלקות כרגע, חס ושלום, וחוזרות למקורן</p>\n<p>For if the creative letters were to depart even for an instant, G‑d forbid, and return to their source, that source being the degree of G‑dliness from whence they emanate,</p>\n<p>היו כל השמים אין ואפס ממש, והיו כלא היו כלל</p>\n<p>all the heavens would become naught and absolute nothingness, and it would be as though they had never existed at all,</p>\n<p>וכמו קודם מאמר: יהי רקיע כו׳ ממש</p>\n<p>exactly as before the utterance, “Let there be a firmament.”</p>\n<p>Before that Divine utterance the firmament did not exist at all. Were the letters that constitute the Divine utterance to depart from the firmament, it would revert to the state of never having existed at all.</p>\n<p>The Alter Rebbe now concludes that this is true not only of the firmament, but of all created beings.</p>\n<p>וכן בכל הברואים שבכל העולמות עליונים ותחתונים</p>\n<p>And so it is with all created things, in all the upper and lower worlds,</p>\n<p>ואפילו ארץ הלזו הגשמית, ובחינת דומם ממש</p>\n<p>and even this physical earth and the realm of the completely inanimate.</p>\n<p>Even immobile beings that show no signs of animation or spirituality, not even the degree of animation observed in the process of growth in the vegetative world, — even this extremely low life-form constantly harbors within it the Divine life-force that brought it into being.</p>\n<p>אילו היו מסתלקות ממנה כרגע, חס ושלום, האותיות מעשרה מאמרות שבהן נבראת הארץ בששת ימי בראשית</p>\n<p>If the letters of the Ten Utterances by which the earth was created during the Six Days of Creation were to depart from it but for an instant, G‑d forbid,</p>\n<p>היתה חוזרת לאין ואפס ממש, כמו לפני ששת ימי בראשית ממש</p>\n<p>it would revert to naught and absolute nothingness, exactly as before the Six Days of Creation.</p>\n<p>וזה שאמר האריז״ל, שגם בדומם ממש כמו אבנים ועפר ומים יש בחינת נפש וחיות רוחנית</p>\n<p>This thought was expressed by the AriZal,8 when he said that even within that which appears to be utterly inanimate matter, such as stones or earth or water, there is a soul and spiritual life-force.</p>\n<p>דהיינו: בחינת התלבשות אותיות הדבור מעשרה מאמרות המחיות ומהוות את הדומם</p>\n<p>That is, i.e, although they evince no demonstrable form of animation, [within them] are nevertheless enclothed the letters of speech from the Ten Utterances which give life and existence to inanimate matter,</p>\n<p>להיות יש מאין ואפס שלפני ששת ימי בראשית</p>\n<p>enabling it to come into being out of the naught and nothingness that preceded the Six Days of Creation.</p>\n<p>The Ten Utterances usher inanimate matter into a state of existence, in contrast to its former state of non-being, prior to the Six Days of Creation. Thus, the letters of the Ten Utterances which cause inanimate matter to be created are its soul and life-force.</p>\n<p>ואף שלא הוזכר שם אבן בעשרה מאמרות שבתורה</p>\n<p>Now, although the name אבן (“stone”) is not mentioned in the Ten Utterances recorded in the Torah, — how, then, can we say that letters of the Ten Utterances are enclothed within a stone?</p>\n<p>אף על פי כן נמשך חיות לאבן על ידי צירופים וחילופי אותיות</p>\n<p>nevertheless, life-force flows to the stone from the Ten Utterances by means of combinations and substitutions of their letters,</p>\n<p>whereby an alef, for example, may take the place of a hei, since both letters are articulated by the same organ of speech, and so on,</p>\n<p>המתגלגלות ברל״א שערים פנים ואחור, כמו שכתוב בספר יצירה</p>\n<p>which are transposed in the “two hundred and thirty-one gates,” either in direct or reverse order,9 as is explained in Sefer Yetzirah,10</p>\n<p>עד שמשתלשל מעשרה מאמרות ונמשך מהן צירוף שם אבן</p>\n<p>so that ultimately the combination of letters [that forms] the name אבן descends from the Ten Utterances, and is derived from them,</p>\n<p>והוא חיותו של האבן</p>\n<p>and this combination of letters is the life-force of the stone.</p>\n<p>וכן בכל הנבראים שבעולם</p>\n<p>And so it is with all created things in the world.</p>\n<p>The Holy Tongue, the Hebrew of the Torah, was the language used in creation. Thus, all created things are directly affected by their Hebrew names, as well as by the component letters of their names. In this, the Holy Tongue is unlike other, arbitrary languages, the meaning of whose words is the result of mere concensus.</p>\n<p>השמות שנקראים בהם בלשון הקודש הן הן אותיות הדבור המשתלשלות ממדרגה למדרגה מעשרה מאמרות שבתורה</p>\n<p>The names [of all creatures] in the Holy Tongue are the very letters of speech which descend, degree by degree, from the Ten Utterances recorded in the Torah,</p>\n<p>על ידי חילופים ותמורות האותיות ברל״א שערים, עד שמגיעות ומתלבשות באותו נברא להחיותו</p>\n<p>by means of substitutions and transpositions of letters through the “two hundred and thirty-one gates,” until they reach a particular created thing and become invested in it, thereby giving it life.</p>\n<p>לפי שאין פרטי הנבראים יכולים לקבל חיותן מעשרה מאמרות עצמן שבתורה</p>\n<p>This descent is necessary because individual creatures, unlike the more pervasive beings such as the heavens, earth, sun and moon, cannot receive their life-force directly from the actual Ten Utterances recorded in the Torah,</p>\n<p>שהחיות הנמשך מהן עצמן גדול מאד מבחינת הנבראים פרטיים</p>\n<p>for the life-force issuing directly from them is far greater than the capacity of the individual creatures; i.e., it is far too intense to serve as their life-force.</p>\n<p>ואין כח בהם לקבל החיות אלא על ידי שיורד החיות ומשתלשל ממדרגה למדרגה פחותה ממנה, על ידי חילופים ותמורות האותיות</p>\n<p>They can receive the life-force only when it descends and is progressively diminished, degree by degree, by means of substitutions and transpositions of the letters,</p>\n<p>וגימטריאות, שהן חשבון האותיות</p>\n<p>and by means of gematriot, their numerical values,</p>\n<p>The life-force may be so muted that it reaches a created being not even through a transposition of letters, but merely through their numerical equivalent.</p>\n<p>עד שיוכל להתצמצם ולהתלבש ולהתהוות ממנו נברא פרטי</p>\n<p>until [the life-force] can be condensed and enclothed, and a particular creature can be brought forth from it.</p>\n<p>וזה שמו אשר יקראו לו בלשון הקדש, הוא כלי לחיות המצומצם באותיות שם זה</p>\n<p>And the name by which [the creature] is called in the Holy Tongue is a vessel for the life-force condensed into the letters of that name</p>\n<p>שנשתלשל מעשרה מאמרות שבתורה, שיש בהם כח וחיות לברוא יש מאין ולהחיותו לעולם</p>\n<p>which has descended from the Ten Utterances recorded in the Torah, that have the power and vitality to create a being ex nihilo and give it life forever.</p>\n<p>דאורייתא וקודשא בריך הוא כולא חד</p>\n<p>Why does it have the power to do so? — For11 “the Torah and the Holy One, blessed be He, are one.” Just as G‑d has the ability to create ex nihilo, so too do the Ten Utterances of the Torah.</p>\n<p>« Previous\nShaar Hayichud\nNext »\nChapter 2\nFOOTNOTES\n1.<br />\nDevarim 4:39.</p>\n<p>2.<br />\nNote of the Rebbe: “This verse continues the idea of an earlier verse [4:35], which begins with the phrase אתה הראת (‘You have been shown...’), and which refers to the time at which the Torah was given.

If your neighbor's money comes into your possession with his consent; for example, if he lent you money, or you owe him wages (or rent), and you do not wish to pay him, or you put him off by saying, \"Go,\" \"and return [later].\" Since the verse states: your [Jewish] neighbor, <strong>it is not forbidden to do so with a non-Jew. This is true only if this will not cause the Name of God to be desecrated;</strong> for example if you borrowed from a non-Jew and he died, it is permitted to deny the loan to his son, because he does not know for sure that you are lying. However, <strong>if the non-Jew knows you are lying, it is forbidden because of the desecration of God's Name.</strong> And even if the son is not sure, it is only permitted to deny a loan, or any other such debt you owed him. If you have in your possession an article you received from a non-Jew which is intact, you are forbidden to deny it, for this constitutes actual robbery. Moreover, even if you buy something from a non-Jew, you are forbidden to fool him in counting out the money, as it is said, \"And he shall reckon with his buyer,\"4 which refers to a non-Jew. For he is only conveying the article to you in consideration of the sum agreed upon, and if you fool him in the payment, it is tantamount to stealing the article, and not merely denying a debt. Even <strong>deception not involving any loss of money is forbidden in business dealing</strong>, as was explained in Chapter 63. Nevertheless, <strong>if the non-Jew makes a mistake, it is permitted to benefit from it</strong>, provided there will be no desecration of God's Name, [for example] in such a case where he remains unaware of his mistake.

Even if it was someone else, the question would be unaffected) that one should put a mask over the wide end of the Shofar while blowing to prevent spreading COVID. The Rabbi of the Shul I Davened at yesterday (a close Talmid of Rav Mordechai Willig) was convinced that Rav Mordechai Willig was either misquoted or would retract this soon.</p>\n<p>His reasoning was that he feels putting a mask changes the tone and would render the blowing Passul.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know whether this is true? The Rabbi tried demonstrating but it was hard to tell (it certainly muffles the sound but it was unclear if the tone was changed as well) because its so easy to change the tone anyway. You move it the tiniest bit and the tone is different.</p>\n<p>Has anyone heard anything else about this Shaila? Does anyone have any Maareh Mekomos that they can think of that may be relevant? Have any other well known Rabbanim weighed in on this?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How to safely write a name of G-d in Hebrew?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I noticed that in English it is preferred by some to say G-d. What is the preferred way to write the/a name of G-d in <em>Hebrew</em>? For example, if you were to title a paper \"G-d\", how would you title it in Hebrew, safely, as it seems you are not supposed to write the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tetragrammaton</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>As, in Hebrew, the words which refer to \"God\" are actually titles calling forth qualities and characteristics, there are different ways to write things out. If you are speaking of the entirely of God, you can use the Hebrew word Hashem (lit. \"The Name\"), or some prefer a more mystical \"Ein Sof\" (the infinite).</p>\n<p>If you are writing in Hebrew, another option is to mask one of the letters in the word by writing it as another letter which would turn El-him into Elokim (the kuf replacing the hey). That same replacement can be used in the 4 letter name so the resulting letters are yod then kuf, then vav and then kuf.</p>\n<p>Often, people use the abbreviation of a Hey with an apostrophe (or a dalet with an apostrophe) to signal a reference to God.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>HaShem, meaning \"the name\" is how Jews refer to God outside of formal prayers.</p>\n\n\n",

But societies like those in China or Latin America or Africa have mentions of all kinds of magic. For example, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Ching</a> is full of specific actions you could take (with \"Hexagram\" symbols to go along with them) which is said will bring you \"abundance\" of various kinds. The shamans of Peru use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca#Traditional_use\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">magic plants</a> to \"directly connect with the cosmos\" and heal people. Then there is \"voodoo\", \"witchcraft\", and other terms for similar things. There is a book floating around, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galdrab%C3%B3k\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Galdrabók</a>, an Icelandic book of spells. This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQk0fGMGWvM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">UC Berkeley Old Norse professor</a> talks about some related stuff here and there. It is the closest work I have found to \"magic\" that is described, but even then it is rather mundane and says more like \"I know of a spell which can do X\", rather than \"The spell to do X is Y\". Then there are secretive groups and such like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosicrucians</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetica\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Corpus Hermeticum</a> and other \"esoteric\" works.</p>\n<p>So people all over the world are, at least to some degree, exploring magic, whether they are doing it secretively like the fraternities, or openly like the shamans. But, I have never seen a list of the magic practices (a) that are even possible or were done in the past, and (b) why they are <a href=\"http://www.jtsa.edu/forbidden-magic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">forbidden</a>. All I have read so far is that the Torah mentions magic over and over again and how its use results in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft_and_divination_in_the_Hebrew_Bible\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">death</a> (in Judaism, I assume only for Jewish people, not the Chinese or Peruvians or whoever else). There are very few online resources, and those that exist are very short and non-descriptive.</p>\n<p>The first part of my question is:</p>\n<h3>What is this magic that they are talking about? What is the list of \"forbidden\" magics?</h3>\n<p>Not how do you practice the magic, but what is it? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromancy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Necromancy</a> is mentioned as one, but even that article on necromancy doesn't explain what is done. I feel like since the spread of the scientific method, we have almost completely lost sight of \"magic\" as it was used in the Torah. But <em>I would like to gain a better sense of what the actual magical practices were (in Israel or Judaism during the time of the Torah).</em> What were people doing back then? What Hebrew or English texts go into depth / down the rabbit hole on this topic? Is it not just what the other cultures in China and Latin America and Africa are doing, or was there more to it?</p>\n<p>The second part of my question is:</p>\n<h3>Why is the magic forbidden?</h3>\n<p>What books/resources go into significant depth on this topic? I get that God doesn't want or like humans to be doing that, but why? All I have read here and there online so far is summarized as \"If you do magic you will get death, [with no explanation of what the magic is or does, or why such a punishment]\".

Looking for books and books on it :)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Great question!</p>\n<p>The verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.22.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 22:17</a> writes strongly about a one who practises sorcery:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מְכַשֵּׁפָ֖ה לֹ֥א תְחַיֶּֽה׃</p>\n<p><em>You shall not tolerate a sorceress.</em> (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.18.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 18:10</a> the direct command not to practise sorcery:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹֽא־יִמָּצֵ֣א בְךָ֔ מַעֲבִ֥יר בְּנֽוֹ־וּבִתּ֖וֹ בָּאֵ֑שׁ קֹסֵ֣ם קְסָמִ֔ים מְעוֹנֵ֥ן וּמְנַחֵ֖שׁ וּמְכַשֵּֽׁף׃</p>\n<p><em>Let no one be found among you who consigns his son or daughter to the fire, or who is an augur, a soothsayer, a diviner, a sorcerer</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Sefer HaChinuch (Lit. Book of Education) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.62?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commandment 62</a> qualifies the first quote  to mean anyone who practises magic. It writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>From the roots of the commandment are that it is known that magic is a very bad thing and causes many mishaps to people. I do not have to write at length about it, as the things are well-known. And therefore we were commanded to put away from the world someone who makes efforts with this, as he is coming against the will of God, as He desires [the world's] settlement and that everything should be administered in a natural way. As nature was at the beginning of creation and this one wants to change everything.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem that practising these types of magic are problematic as they are essentially, whether knowingly or not, trying to alter G-d's creation.</p>\n<p>The Rambam in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.37.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevuchim (Guide for the Perplexed) 3:37</a> writes in quite some detail about how the various magic types were practised. It is clear from the Rambam that the practise of such magic is a form of idol worship and that is why there is such a strong command to distance oneself from it.</p>\n<p>In keeping with this idea, there are certain idolatrous practises that also engage in some form of magic which the Torah warns against.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.31?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 19:13</a> it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַל־תִּפְנ֤וּ אֶל־הָאֹבֹת֙ וְאֶל־הַיִּדְּעֹנִ֔ים אַל־תְּבַקְשׁ֖וּ לְטָמְאָ֣ה בָהֶ֑ם אֲנִ֖י ה' אֱלֹקיכֶֽם׃</p>\n<p><em>Do not turn to ghosts and do not inquire of familiar spirits, to be defiled by them: I the LORD am your God.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi, the Medieval commentator explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אל תפנו DO NOT TURN [TO THE אבת NOR TO THE ידענים]</strong> — This is a warning addressed to the necromancers and the charmers themselves (not to the people who consult these tricksters). The בעל אוב, the controller of the spirit אוב, as the necromancer is called (cf. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.28.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Samuel 28:7</a>), is identical with the פיתום (in Greek: πύξωυ); he is one who speaks out of his arm-pit; ידעני is one who puts a bone of an animal the name of which is ידוע into his mouth and the bone speaks (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.65b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 65b</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Torah also speaks about the idolatrous cult of Molech - first appearing <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.18.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 18:21</a> which involved passing children through a fire and is referenced in the verse cited in Deuteronomy 18:10 above.

I mean, is there such an halachic obligation? or is it, at least, a nice thing to do? And what about other post-food benedictions (not after bread)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As far as making brachos achronos (after blessings) on food the rundown is as follows:</p>\n<h2><strong>1) Bensching (Grace After Meals)</strong></h2>\n<p>With regards to bensching the Shulchan Aruch says expressly in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.183.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 183:9</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>צריך לישב בשעה שמברך בין אם היה הולך בביתו כשאכל או עומד או מיסב כשמגיע לברך צריך לישב כדי שיוכל לכוין יותר וגם לא יהא מיסב שהוא דרך גאוה אלא ישב באימה: הגה נ\"ל דלאו דוקא המברך אלא ה\"ה כל המסובין לא ישבו בקלות ראש אלא באימה מיהו אם לא עשו כן אפי' בירך מהלך בדיעבד יצא [רמב\"ם פרק רביעי]:‏</p>\n<p><em><strong>It is necessary to sit at the time one is Benching</strong>, whether he was walking in his house while he ate or standing, or leaning. When he reaches the blessings, <strong>he must sit in order that he should have better concentration</strong>. Also, one should not be leaning since it shows haughtiness. Rather, <strong>when saying the blessings one should sit in awe</strong>. Rema: It appears to me that not only the מבורך (should do these things) but the same applies to all the diners; that they should not sit in the way of levity, but with fear. However, if one did not do these things, you are יוצא בדיעבד (by the letter of the law covered) even if you made the blessings while walking.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem that sitting for bensching is definitely the preferred option.</p>\n<h2><strong>2) Bircat Me'ein Shalosh / Al Hamichya</strong></h2>\n<p>In the following se'if, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.183.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">183:10</a> the Shulchan Aruch writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש אומרי' שגם ברכ' מעין שלש צריך לאמרה מיושב</p>\n<p><em>There are those who say that also for saying the bracha of 'al hamichya' (said over the five grains) one needs to sit.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.183.10?lang=bi&with=Mishnah%20Berurah&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah</a> adds by quoting the Biur HaGra that one should specifically sit when saying the bracha achrona.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3335601#v13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch HaRav 183:13</a> confirms the above two points succinctly.</p>\n<h2><strong>3) Borei Nefashos</strong></h2>\n<p>Borei Nefashos' lack of mention in the above source is understood to mean that one does not have to sit down for its recitation. However, in keeping with the concept stated above that one's kavanna (intention) is better when sitting there are poskim who say it is better to sit. Refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kaf_HaChayim_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.183.53.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kaf HaChaim 183:51</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ben_Ish_Hai%2C_Halachot_1st_Year%2C_Chukat.5.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Ish Chai, Chukas 4</a> who both say expressly one should be cautious to sit with every bracha.</p>\n\n\n",

The mishne berura oz v'hodor mevuar brings from kaf hachaim that the avnet was under the garment and aizor on top. The kohanim certainly didnt have it under, and I think that is not the only difference. The avnet was like a piece of string whereas the aizor more like a belt.\nHe brings from a sefer shevet hakhozi (someone younger than me) that a gartel doesnt have to be tight. I dont agree with the whole concept of a gartel today.\nThe idea of an aizur is to be 'mezuraz' like a soldier wears a belt to be ready for action. In the olden times people wore like the kohanim a 'ksones' a loose fitting, dress like garment which needed an avnet (gartel) to become mezuraz. This was normal like a lady today wears a belt on a loose dress. Today when people wear tight fitting buttoned jackets a gartel has no place. No one wears a belt on top of that and looks ridiculous. The idea of preparing for davenning is not just to wear anything even if it looks ridiculous. Perhaps if you wear a kaftan or bekisha, they do come usually with a belt but not a normal jacket or coat today. If a belt is not tight it isnt a belt, and has no purpose so I dont agree with the previous sefer.</p>\n\n\n",

I saw that you are allowed to cook on Yom Tov with an existing flame and enhance an existing flame. The way I see it, the batteries are being used from before Yom Tov are an existing flame and then driving would be enhancing the flame. I know this might be problematic with how it appears for other Jews, so if someone added a sign to the car saying that they were cooking food on the batteries, would it then be allowed? If the previous is allowed, how hot would the batteries have to be to be considered a flame, or is the fact of the electricity considered a flame by itself?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/708510/jewish/Laws-of-Yom-Tov.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yom Tov Laws</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cor.ca/view/169/cooking_on_yom_tov.html#:%7E:text=On%20Yom%20Tov%2C%20it%20is,Yom%20Tov%20purpose%2C%20including%20cooking.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Enhancing a Flame</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Who should perform the abortion\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Everyone agrees that an abortion beyond a certain gestational age is forbidden for a Jew <sup>1</sup>. However, there's no death penalty for it. This is unlike a non-Jew, who is liable to capital punishment for destroying a fetus <sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Sanhedrin.59a.15.1?vhe=Wikisource_Tosafot&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Tosafos</strong> to <strong>Sanhedrin</strong> 59a <em>s.v.</em> ליכא</a>, quoting <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.57b.5?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Sanhedrin</strong> 57b</a>).</p>\n<p>However, there are certain circumstances where an abortion is permissible or mandatory. For example, if the fetus is a lethal threat to the mother (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Oholot.7.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Oholos</strong> 7:6</a>). Sometimes there are other considerations as well, and a person should always ask their competent <em>halachic</em> authority.</p>\n<p>What I'm wondering is, in the situation that a abortion is permissible (or even mandatory), who should perform it? A Jewish doctor, and <em>not</em> a non-Jewish one (since for them it's seemingly a more serious transgression)? Or even a non-Jewish doctor can? Is it better for the mother to do it herself, it at all possible? Does it make a difference? Does it matter if the reason the abortion is permissible is because of a threat to life (in which case the doctor should be allowed), or for other reasons (in which case, why should the doctor be allowed if the mother could)?</p>\n<p>I'm not so familiar with how they do abortions. I would imagine in certain cases there's simply a pill to take (early in the pregnancy), and later in the pregnancy a procedure needs to be performed. I'm more wondering the latter. Where a procedure needs to be performed, who should do it?</p>\n<p><sub><strong>For a potentially related discussion</strong>: See <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/en/book/book.php?book=108282&pagenum=89\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Imrei Moshe</strong> § 12</a>, who discusses the prohibition of cutting off one's <em>peyos</em>. If for medical reasons someone has to have them cut off, he wonders if it's better to have a non-Jew do it, since they aren't prohibited in cutting off someone's <em>peyos</em>, rather than a Jew, who is prohibited from cutting. He then innovates that if the person themself is allowed to have their <em>peyos</em> cut off, someone else wouldn't have the prohibition of cutting it. That may or may not be helpful here.</sub></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> There are different suggestions for what the prohibition is. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/39025/1739\">this</a> answer to a related question.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/15560/1739\">this</a> related question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Here are some relevant sources on the topic. It's a start for an answer. Hopefully I'll find more as time progresses.</p>\n<p><strong>Nishmas Avraham</strong> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51472&pgnum=188\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IV 425:1:30</a> by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%9D_%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rabbi Dr. Avraham Sofer Avraham</strong></a> (1935-) brings a responsum from the <strong>Tzitz Eliezer</strong> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14519&st=&pgnum=12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">XX 2:4</a> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Waldenberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Eliezer Waldenberg</strong></a> (1915-2006) regarding a woman who has quadruplets, and the doctors determine that if they don't terminate one of the fetuses, all of them will be in be danger of not surviving the pregnancy. He says they may terminate the one to save the other three. He adds that <strong>if necessary they may use a non-Jewish doctor</strong>, even though for non-Jews it's a capital crime, since the doctor's intent is to save the other three. He says it's best to ensure that the doctor that determined this threat to the other three be the one to do the procedure on the one.</p>\n<p>It sounds like from this that it would be best to find a Jewish doctor (even though he didn't explicitly say that), since he says \"if necessary\" to use a non-Jewish doctor. This is specifically referring to a case of loss of life.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Nishmas Avraham</strong> <em>ibid</em> § 31 he brings from the <em>sefer</em> <strong>HaRefuah LeOhr HaHalacha</strong> <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/en/book/book.php?book=166403&pagenum=138\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Chapter 12 p. 121</a> that <strong>according to all <em>halachic</em> authorities, a woman who needs an abortion should use a Jewish doctor</strong>, since for them it's not a capital crime. Even though it is nevertheless forbidden to perform an abortion, the prohibition is pushed aside to save a life. She should not use a non-Jewish doctor, as for them it's a capital crime, and it would be <em>lifnei iver</em>, placing a stumbling block, if she would use a non-Jewish doctor. In <strong>Nishmas Avraham</strong> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51473&pgnum=816\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I 656:1:3 fn. 31</a> he writes that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Moshe Feinstein</strong></a> (1895-1986) in <strong>Igros Moshe</strong> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=921&pgnum=291\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Choshen Mishpat</em> 2:69</a> also ruled it's forbidden for a non-Jewish doctor to perform an abortion to save the life of a Jewish mother. Although, looking at his words there, all I see is him explaining <strong>Tosafos</strong> (cited in the OP), not necessarily ruling anything. Unless I missed something.</p>\n<p>Again, this only addresses abortions in the case of saving a life, not for other reasons. <strong>HaRefuah LeOhr HaHalacha</strong> also seems to ignore the opinion of the <strong>Tzitz Eliezer</strong> above, who allows a non-Jewish doctor when necessary, as well as the sources below.</p>\n<p>Something else that's relevant is <strong>Nishmas Avraham</strong> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51472&pgnum=190\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IV 425:1:33</a> brings sources that say a non-Jew isn't punished for performing an abortion on a fetus less than forty days old, as the fetus is negligible in <em>halacha</em> in that time period.</p>\n<p>He continues and brings sources that we can be lenient and allow a non-Jewish doctor to perform the abortion to save the life of the mother, <strong>if it's impossible to use a Jewish doctor</strong>. However, if the abortion is not about saving the mother's life, he brings from <strong>Teshuvos Lev Aryeh</strong> <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/en/book/book.php?book=102739&pagenum=97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:32</a> by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%91_%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%A1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Aryeh Leib Grosnas</strong></a> (1912-1996) that it's forbidden to use a non-Jewish doctor.</p>\n<p>So if I'm understanding correctly it's a dispute between the <strong>Tzitz Eliezer</strong> and the <strong>Lev Aryeh</strong> if you can use a non-Jewish doctor if we're not worried about the life of the mother. However, the <strong>Tzitz Eliezer</strong> is discussing saving the life of the fetuses, and I didn't find someone who allows a non-Jewish doctor if there's no threat to life to anyone.</p>\n<p>See also <strong>Nishmas Avraham</strong> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51474&pgnum=99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II 154:2</a> at the end regarding a dispute if there's <em>lifnei iver</em> on a non-Jewish doctor when there are other non-Jewish doctors around.</p>\n\n\n",

Or gentiles and jewish apostates?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I recommend studying the entire tractate. The majority of it does, in fact, discuss actual idolatry. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MISHNA: And these are the festivals of gentiles: Kalenda, Saturnalia, and Kratesis, and the day of the festival of their kings, and the birthday of the king, and the anniversary of the day of the death of the king. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avodah_Zarah.8a.5?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 8a</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This mishnah speaks about pagan Roman holidays, the most famous being the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Saturnalia</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara asks: From where do we derive the prohibition with regard to an offering itself? It is derived from a verse, as it is written: “They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the offerings to the dead” (Psalms 106:28). This verse teaches that just as deriving benefit from a corpse is prohibited, so too, deriving benefit from an offering of idolatry is prohibited. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avodah_Zarah.29b.11?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 29b</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This section (and before) speaks about various prohibitions that are related to idols.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised another objection to the opinion of Reish Lakish from a baraita: Rabbi Yosei ben Yasian says: If one found an object in the figure of a dragon [derakon] with its head severed, but it is uncertain whether a gentile severed it and it is uncertain whether a Jew severed it, the object is permitted. But if it is certain that a Jew severed it, it is forbidden. Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: According to Reish Lakish, why is it forbidden? Let it be treated like an object of idol worship that broke on its own. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avodah_Zarah.42a.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 42a</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This sections speaks about what to do if you find a specific kind of idol, a dragon idol (for more on dragon cults, see <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&pg=PA417&lpg=PA417&dq=%22drakon%22%20roman%20worship&source=bl&ots=JzOAF_NlWB&sig=ACfU3U10LKeiVJE39lClxgr0cqSLaE0a0w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjLxrbTi4HrAhVxTRUIHduUD-w4ChDoATAIegQIChAB#v=onepage&q=cult&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>These are all just completely random examples, but I think the gist is clear, that Avodah Zara, does, in fact, talk about idolatry (setting aside the halachic disagreement of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/89/15256\">whether or not Christianity constitutes idolatry</a> in itself). Of course, throughout all of the Talmud, there are sections that discuss the minim (various cults) or even the Christians specifically, so there may be such portions in Avodah Zara, but those aren't the main subject.</p>\n\n\n",

The Torah says: Dismantle the house and give the beam back to its owner:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When one has sinned, he realizes his guilt and restores what he got through robbery or fraud. [Lev. 5:23]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bet Shammai said: Follow Torah law.  But Bet Hillel said that the financial loss to the thief is so high it might impede his repentance, which is the purpose of justice, so financial compensation is enough. Bet Hillel’s ruling prevailed.  [Gittin 55a, Tosefta Bava Kamma 10:5]</p>\n<p>Talmud even reports that the King of Nineveh wanted his people to repent so completely that they should tear down their houses to return stolen beams, so as not to own a stolen object! [Taanit 16a]</p>\n<p>The Mishna concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the general rule: all robbers make restitution according to [the value of the stolen object] at the moment of theft. [Mishna, Bava Kamma 9:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now my question.  Does the victim have any say in the matter?  Maybe whatever was stolen from him has special, sentimental value, and he wants <em>it</em> back, not money; and it <em>is</em> possible to give it back to him, even though the cost to the thief is high.  Would this be resolved on a case-by-case basis or is Hillel's ruling automatically applied?  As it stands, Hillel's ruling seems to imply: \"Steal whatever you want and pay back its monetary value\".</p>\n<p><strong>Case added in view of comments</strong>.  You own an old, battered spoon that used to belong to your great-grandfather in the old country and is of great sentimental value to you.  It is stolen from you and the thief makes it the centerpiece of a work of modern art called \"The Old Country\", which becomes very popular and is worth millions.  (Preposterous?  See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.)  You recognize your spoon and demand it back.  Shammai says: Give it back.  Hillel says: Give back the value of the spoon (10 cents).

She screamed, but Rav Naḥman did not pay attention to her. She said to him: A woman whose father, Abraham, our forefather, had three hundred and eighteen slaves screams before you, and you do not pay attention to her? Rav Naḥman said to the Sages: This woman is a screamer, and she has rights only to the monetary value of the wood.

As she got older,\nhe sought a husband for her. Astrologers advised the king that she was\ndestined to marry the poorest man in the kingdom.</p>\n<p>Shlomo HaMelech understood that if this was Hashem’s choice, it would\nbe, but decided to create an opportunity for people to clearly see Yad\nHashem. So, on a small island in the Mediterranean Sea, he built a\ncastle and surrounded it with high walls. Placing his daughter in this\ncastle under the watch of seventy of his most trusted elders, the king\nsealed the door – he had the only key.</p>\n<p>“Now I’ll see how G-d fulfills his mission,” said the wise king.</p>\n<p>Many months passed. One day a young man was wandering alone in a\nforest on his travels to a certain city. He was tired and hungry and,\nas night approached, began looking for shelter. He spied an empty\ncarcass of a cow and crept inside it to keep warm and quickly fell\nasleep.</p>\n<p>Soon a large eagle approached and, seeing the carcass, lifted it up\nwith the man in it and soared away looking for a place where he could\neat in solitude. After a while, he landed on the roof of the\nprincess’s castle on the island.</p>\n<p>When the young man awoke, he did not know where he was. As he looked\naround, the princess looked out and saw him.</p>\n<p>“Who are you and what are you doing her?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“I am a young Jew from the city of Acco and it seems a large bird\ncarried me here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Noticing his tattered clothes, the princess brought him into the\ncastle and found him suitable clothing and food to eat. There was such\na transformation in the young man after he bathed and dressed in the\naristocratic clothes. In conversation it became clear that the young\nman was a talmid chacham who spent his days steeped in learning.</p>\n<p>After a short time, the princess asked him if he would marry her.</p>\n<p>“With all my heart,” was the reply. “But how can we?”</p>\n<p>It is said that the Malach Gavriel acted as an witness and the young\nman pricked his finger and used his own blood to write the kesuva.</p>\n<p>After a few days, the guards discovered what happened and quickly sent\nword to Shlomo HaMelech that despite their vigilance the young\nprincess had married.</p>\n<p>Some days later Shlomo HaMelech arrived at the island and questioned\nhis daughter, “This is my husband whom G-d sent me down from the\nheavens,” she said. “He is a talmid chacham and we have been\nhalachically married.” She then produced their marriage contract which\nwas written in their blood.</p>\n<p>Shlomo HaMelech was overjoyed that she had met her destined mate and\nthat Hashem’s clear hashgacha would be seen by all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does anyone know where in the Medrash this story can be found?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Midrash is called \"Bat Shlomo in the Tower\".

What is the idea behind this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/116770/source-for-eulogizing-for-sheimos\">Source for eulogizing for sheimos?</a> for the 4 sources he brought for this. He finished the hesped with the following quote from the Sefer Mat'amim, p. 190 (couldn’t find the sefer on the Otzar Hachochma, so I am quoting from what I can make out from the recording):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>טעם למנהיג כשגונזים ספרים בלים וקרועים הן מספר תורה הן משאר ספרים,\nהולכים בהמון אל בית הקברות וגונזים שם בקרקע ועושים עליהם אוהל וסימן\nלידע ש(ינהגו?) (ב?)קדושה באותה מקום, והרב דורש, שעל פי רוב עושים זאת\n<strong>בעת המגפה, רחמנא ליצלן</strong>, והיא סגולה כדי לעורר רחמים בזה, כי כמו שאנו\nחסים על שמות ודברים שבקדושה, שלא ילכו לאיבוד, כן ירחם השם יתברך עלינו\nועל בנינו שלא נלכו לאיבוד ולביזון כי גם אני משותפים בשמו הגדול: ישראל\nואורייתא וקודשא בריך הוא חד הוא, ושמו משותף בינינו ואנו גם כן נקראים\nגוי קדוש, ואנו מבקשים מאת השמות הקדושים שירחמו עלינו בזכות שאנו מכבדים\nאותם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The reason for the custom that when they bury seforim (Hebrew\nbooks) which are worn and torn, whether it be a Torah scroll or other\nseforim, they go as a large crowd to the cemetery and bury them there\nin the ground, and make a tent over them and a sign to (so that others\nshould) know that they should (conduct themselves?) (with?) holiness\nat that place. And teacher expounds (obviously referring to someone\nspecific, unclear from this excerpt who), that the majority of the\ntime they do this <em><strong>in the time of a plague, may The Merciful One\nsave us</strong></em>, and it is a segula (supernatural cure) in order to awaken\nDivine Mercy through this. Because, just like we are having compassion\non the sheimos and articles of holiness – that they should go to\ndestruction – so Hashem should have mercy on us and our children that\nwe shouldn’t go to destruction and embarresment, because we too are\npartners with his holy name (just like the sheimos): The Jews and the\nTorah and The Holy One, Blessed Be Her are one, and his name is\npartnered among us, and we see are called a holy nation(i.e. we are\ncalled holy, just like “the articles of <em>holiness</em> and the sheimos are\ncalled holy), and we request from Hashem through these holy sheimos\nthat He should have mercy on us in the merit that we are honoring\nthem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Practical application: Would it be improper for someone to think they know better than everyone else and show off their voice, because really they aren't <em>supposed</em> to sing like that?

(On Shabbos, when those prayers are not said, the singing is omitted.) The Kohanim are trying to mainly stay together and keep a standard pace that will allow the congregation to finish, not put on a show. So if the singing sounds more functional than usual synagogue singing, that is because it is.</p>\n\n\n",

The Angel of Death went and appeared to him. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said to him: Show me my place in paradise. He said to him: Very well. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said to him: Give me your knife that you use to kill mortals, lest you frighten me on the way. He gave it to him. When he arrived there, in paradise, he lifted Rabbi Yehoshua so he could see his place, and he showed it to him. Rabbi Yehoshua jumped and fell into that other side, thereby escaping into paradise.</p>\n<p>The Angel of Death grabbed him by the corner of his cloak. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said to him: I swear that I will not come with you. The Holy One, blessed be He, said: If he ever in his life requested dissolution concerning an oath he had taken, he must return to this world with the Angel of Death, as he can have his oath dissolved this time also. If he did not ever request dissolution of an oath, he need not return. Since Rabbi Yehoshua had in fact never requested dissolution of an oath, he was allowed to stay in paradise. The Angel of Death said to him: At least give me my knife back. However, he did not give it to him, as he did not want any more people to die. A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: Give it to him, as it is necessary to kill the created beings; death is the way of the world. Eliyahu the Prophet announced before him: Make way for the son of Levi, make way for the son of Levi.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now as I heard, when Rabbi Yehoshua held the Angel of Death's knife, he carved his name into his arm.

He was called Cyrus [Koresh] because he was a virtuous [kasher] king; he was called Artaxerxes after his kingdom, i.e., this was his royal title; and what was his real name? Darius was his name.</em> (Sefaria Transaltion & Notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cyrus is largely praised as being a righteous king (as stated above that he was named Cyrus because he was 'kasher' king). Indeed we know that he gave permission for the Temple to be rebuilt (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.6.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezra 6:3</a>) and then we see in Seder Eliyahu Rabbah 19 that he wept over the Temple's destruction.</p>\n<p>The continuation of the above cited Gemarah says that he became corrupt. So something happened that made him turn and it would seem that he went from one extreme to another.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther_Rabbah.1.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther Rabbah 1:3</a> tells us that Artaxerxes was in fact Achashveirosh! and He was called Artaxerxes as he would flit between seething with rage and then relative calm. There are several sources that point to the fact that Achashveirosh was real 'rashah' (wicked man). In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther_Rabbah.7.20?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther Rabbah 7:20</a> we're told that he hated the Jews more than Haman! And the Gemarah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.12a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 12a</a>) tells us that he had no problem wearing the priestly vestments.</p>\n<p>So my question is two-fold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What happened to make him switch from being a friend of the Jews to such a virulent hater?</li>\n<li>And do we know a timeline as to when this all played out?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As a starting point, it’s worth getting the chronology clear.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46769&st=&pgnum=134\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam Rabbah</a> (with which the Rishonim assume the <em>gemara</em> in Rosh Hashanah accords) assumes that the Persian period began 52 years after the destruction of the First Temple. Cyrus reigned for three years, Ahasuerus for 14, and then the Second Temple was built in the second year of Darius, 70 years after the First Temple was destroyed.</p>\n<p>The passage in Rosh Hashanah which you quote is dealing with the king I referred to above as Darius. This is assumed by Rashi (3b s.v. <em>hu koresh</em>), Tosafot (3b s.v. <em>ve-artachshast</em> and 4a s.v. <em>venidbach</em>) and is stated explicitly by Ba’al HaMaor.</p>\n<p>So your questions from Cyrus and Ahasuerus are somewhat tangential here. The <em>gemara</em> is not discussing the Cyrus of Ezra 6:3, the first Persian king who granted permission to build the Second Temple.</p>\n<p>The fact that a Medrash identifies Artaxerxes with Ahasuerus is also not so relevant. After all, the <em>gemara</em> here says that Artaxerxes was a generic name for Persian kings, so it’s not surprising that Ahasuerus could be called Artaxerxes.</p>\n<p>Moving back to your question regarding the character of Darius and when and why it changed, the implication of the <em>gemara</em> is that Darius was righteous in his second year, but had become wicked by his seventh.</p>\n<p>However, it’s worth noting that Tosafot on 4a (s.v. <em>venidbach</em>) suggest that Darius was actually already wicked in his second year, but his true character has not yet become clear.</p>\n<p>This point is amplified by Ritva on 4a (s.v. <em>amar lei</em>): when Darius allowed the temple to be built in his second year, the Jews thought him to be a righteous monarch. However, his later behavior (as detailed in the <em>gemara</em>) showed that he was actually never a righteous king in the first place.</p>\n\n\n",

The issue raised was how could God hold infant Amalekites accountable for sins they did not commit and order for them to be slaughtered with others of the Amalekite nation.</p>\n<p>The given answer stated that due to God's omniscience, God can also foresee a person's future actions. Therefore because time is not a parameter, God can punish a person for something they had not yet committed. We humans, unlike God, do not have the capacity to foresee the future, and therefore this is something only God is capable of doing. And so an example of this would be the famous \"would you kill baby Hitler?\" dilemma.</p>\n<p>Assuming this is the case, this raises an issue. If God demanded that the infants be killed for their future sins, and then those infants are killed before they commit them, then they would never commit those sins, meaning they are punished for something they never committed, rendering their punishment futile and unjust.</p>\n<p>The main question is, are there other instances of God punishing someone for something they have yet to have committed? and how do we explain away this paradox?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Babylonian Talmud in Rosh Hashana 16b states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וא\"ר יצחק אין דנין את האדם אלא לפי מעשיו של אותה שעה שנאמר כי שמע אלהים אל קול הנער באשר הוא שם</p>\n<p>R.

    "content": "# May one bill two clients for the same hour\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If Reuven is paying Levi an amount per hour to do a task and Reuven already began doing it but he needs to wait for a computer to process and it'll take an hour or two to complete. May Levi do work for Shimon and charge Shimon for the same hour(s) while he is waiting for task 1 to complete? In other words, may one get paid for the same time from two different clients as long as the end result isn't adversely affected?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>So the Business Halacha Institute <a href=\"https://businesshalacha.com/en/materials/articles/7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> addresses this idea albeit with a different scenario - namely an attorney that is traveling to a client meeting in which the time and expense of the trip are billed to the client. While traveling, the attorney receives a phone call from another client. An emergent matter is discussed, and he resultantly bills this client for his time as well.</p>\n<p>The answer reads as follows (I have emboldened the main parts of the answer and italicised and placed in brackets a point that is perhaps only relevant to those who work in the field of Law):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, there are few halachic sources that directly address this issue. Such conflicts did not exist until recently; when work involved manual labor, it was not possible to plow two people’s fields at the same time. Nevertheless, there are two gemaras that help shed light on the matter.</p>\n<p><strong>The first is the sugyah in bava metzia that deals with a laborer that began performing a job, but was interrupted by an unavoidable <em>Oness</em></strong>. In certain cases, the employer remains liable to pay the workers for the full day. However, the employers’ liability applies only when the employees cannot find replacement work. If there is other work available, the employee must accept the available job, and the original employer is released from his liability. If the worker fails to accept the available job, he will have no claim against the original employer.</p>\n<p>What this seems to demonstrate is that <strong>an employee that is forced to sit around idly unable to perform his work is responsible to accept other employment, and if he does so, he may not double bill the original employer</strong>. Based on this, it would seem that not only may an attorney not charge both clients for his travel time, he should have a pro-active obligation to fill whatever time he can with other calls or work, so as to minimize the wasted time charged to the first client.</p>\n<p>Arguably, this would be limited to instances where the attorney cannot service the second client at a later time. Such cases are similar to the laborer that loses nothing by accepting the second job, since if he declines to take the job, it will not be available for him the next day. In contrast, an attorney that has two clients to service, and was anticipating finishing with the first client’s task and then dealing with the second client’s needs at a later time, would not be obligated to ‘use up’ the second client in order to minimize the cost to the first client. Obligating him to do so would essentially be forcing him to give over the benefits of the practice that he built up for the benefit of the first client.</p>\n<p>There is a second sugyah that must be examined. The gemara <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.12b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">bava metzia 12b</a></strong> writes that if a servant finds an ownerless item, or avaida, while performing work for his master, it belongs to his master. The gemara qualifies that this applies only when picking up the avaida conflicts with his obligations to his job. However, if the servant is able to pick up the lost object while continuing to perform his job, he may keep the item. The implication is that any service performed while working for another that distracts the employee from his primary job is the property of the employer, while any task that does not contradict his performance is the sole property of the employee.</p>\n<p><strong>What emerges from the above are two critical distinctions. To the extent the task being performed for a second client does not conflict with his responsibilities to the first client, the attorney is entitled to reap the double gains</strong>. Thus, an attorney that makes a phone call to one client while traveling on behalf of a second client should be able to bill each for the time. Phone calls and traveling are not mutually exclusive, and the fact that one client is paying for him to travel at the same time that another is paying for the conversation does pose any halachic conflict. <strong>If however, a conflict exists, the first client has a claim for the benefits. Therefore, if the attorney makes a phone call for one client while reviewing a document for a second client, he would be unable to bill each for the full amount of time.</strong></p>\n<p>These parameters apply during the performance of the job for the first client. In the event an Oness prevents him from performing the first client’s task and he is billing simply because of the lost time, the attorney would only be able to demand compensation when he truly suffered a loss because he was idle. If however, other opportunities were present (that do not come at the expense of future billable hours), the attorney would have a pro-active obligation to service such clients and reduce the expense to the first client. Thus, an attorney that can productively use the time spent sitting around waiting for the judge to arrive may have a pro-active obligation to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>The above reflects the basic halachic parameters of double billing. However, as in many areas of choshen mishpat, we must examine the accepted business norms, or Minhag, before concluding what the halacha is</strong>. In this respect, the picture grows a bit murkier. From an informal survey, it appears double billing is fairly common. Typically, any common practice will create a minhag that overrides the default halacha and is binding upon all parties. However, this is problematic on two levels. The first issue is that <strong>common practice creates a binding minhag to the extent that it is well-known by all participants</strong>. Since the practice reflects standard market behavior, a party is implicitly accepting the terms by entering into an agreement without protest. <strong>Based on this logic, minhag can only play a role when both sides of the deal are aware of the common practice. Double billing however, is a practice that may be widely known by professional attorneys, but not necessarily by their clients. While some may suspect that it occurs, it is probably not well enough known by typical clients to establish a minhag.</strong></p>\n<p>(<em>A second problem with applying minhag to allow such practices is that the American Bar Association, in formal opinion 93-37, specifically prohibits such billing tactics. The ABA argues that professional fees must be reasonable, and creating four billable hours out of two actual hours is inherently unreasonable. While the extent that the formal opinion is legally binding on an attorney is debatable, there is likely an assumption by most clients that his attorney complies with the ABA’s rules. Such assumptions, which the attorney is well aware of, may create an implicit condition to the attorney-client relationship that would therefore be binding on the parties, and would override the default halacha. Therefore, it is likely that the ABA’s rules that prohibit such practices in virtually all circumstances would govern as a matter of halacha as well.</em></p>\n<p><em>It should be noted that neither the ABA’s formal opinion nor common minhag, place any responsibility on the attorney to proactively try to service other clients during breaks so as to minimize the expense to the first client.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>As should be clear to the reader, a number of the assumptions in this article are debatable, and will not hold true in all circumstances</strong>. A cynic may argue that the legal profession is held in such low esteem today that clients’ working assumption is that the ABA ethics rules are not followed in practice. Furthermore, the degree that clients are aware and accept certain billing practices varies among different client groups, which can impact the actual halacha. <strong>These factors make it difficult to render a clear definitive Psak; nevertheless, the discussion demonstrates the nexus between choshen mishpat, minhag, and laws of professional conduct in a distinctly modern dilemma</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This relates to earth/soil being the material source of the power of endless <em>fructification.</em> That the <em>Feminine</em> is in character, <em>Fructuous</em>, full of and producing fruit, so to speak.</p>\n<p>In parshat Bereshit, there are paradigms of Creation established which repeat like fractals across the six days of Creation and throughout the entire universe even to the present. So the first paradigm introducing the distinction between <em>Masculine</em> and <em>Feminine</em> is the appearance of the dry land from the waters in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.9?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:9</a>.</p>\n<p>The waters are initially one and then are separated into two by the <em>Rakia</em>. And then from the <em>Lower Waters</em> comes forth the dry land (יבשה) which will be called <em>Earth</em>. And the Waters will be called <em>Seas</em>.</p>\n<p>The <em>Earth</em> corresponds with the <em>Feminine</em> aspect and the <em>Seas</em> correspond with the <em>Masculine</em>. In this case, the <em>Seas</em> are an allegory to the Semen which flows ultimately to <em>water the Garden</em> which is comprised of the dry land.</p>\n<p>And this same paradigm repeats within Creation in Bereshit <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.27?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:27</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7-15?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:7-15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.21-24?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:21-24</a>. This process of <em>repeating</em> is called <em>Seder Hishtalshelut</em> (סדר השתלשלות) in Kabbalistic literature.</p>\n<p>With that introduction, it is now possible to point to the hint of <em>uncovered hair</em> with females. That growing and showing of their hair is equated with the appearance of the <em>Desheh</em>, (the concept of Malchut like is discussed in <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=76&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Kehillat Yaacov, Erech דשא</a>) over the Earth in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.11-12?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:11-12</a>. That this is their covering and beauty and an outward sign of their being matured, prepared and ready for a mate and reproduction.</p>\n<p>And this same language pertaining to the <em>Desheh</em> is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.23.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 23:2</a>. This is the same chapter of Tehillim that many say at each of the three meals of Shabbat in hinting to the elements which make-up a Jewish marriage. That there are three partners in a Jewish marriage.</p>\n<p>The first 45 words of the chapter, lines 1 through 5, hint to Adam (אדם) which is gematria 45. The next 3 words in posuk 6 (אך טוב וחסד) have the ending letters כב״ד, (which also refers to the liver כבד, the organ that causes the blood to thicken and become more material similar to the womb) which is the gematria of G-d's name (יהוה). This refers to the middle partner, G-d, in a marriage like is referenced in the Talmud. And the final 9 words allude to the <em>Feminine</em>, the wife, who corresponds with the letter Tet (ט) whose form is compared to an empty vessel prepared to receive, like is stated in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaBahir.124?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaBahir, chapter 124</a>.</p>\n<p>This chapter of Tehillim is also recounting the episode from Bereshit when Chava, Adam's mate was walking in the Garden just prior to her encounter with the Nachash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.1-6?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 3:1-6</a>. And at that time, she was rejoicing in the beauty of her hair (בנאות דשא ירביצני) and contemplating her future Motherhood with her betrothed mate.</p>\n<p>This seems to be implied from the understanding brought in connection with Ketubot 72a which connects the mitzvah of the suspected Adulteress and the ritual involving uncovering her hair to actually <em>untying her braids</em> like is brought by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.5.18?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on BeMidbar 5:18</a>. Braided hair is a minhag of modesty for unmarried Jewish women like is discussed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.303.82?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 75:3, Mishnah Berurah 75:12, 303:82</a> and at length in Sefer Oz v'Hadar Levushah (<em>Modesty: An Adornment for Life by Rabbi Pesach Eliyahu Falk, A\"H</em>) Sec. 5H, pp. 262-265. And so this detail of the chapter in Tehillim would actually be indicating that Chava was betrothed to be married but had not yet had relations, conceived and had children. And this also follows the explanation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayyim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chacham Yosef Chaim, the Ben Ish Chai</a> in his commentary to Shas, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ben_Yehoyada_on_Yoma.47a.4?vhe=Senlake_edition_2019_based_on_Ben_Yehoyada,_Jerusalem,_1897&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Yehoyada to Yoma 47a:4</a> who stays:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובזה מובן הטעם מה <strong>שברא הקב\"ה את חוה בקליעת שער</strong> ולא בראה שערה סתור</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second part of your question is more difficult. You asked, <strong>\"Where in the Tanakh is it extrapolated that females are to cover their heads or hair when praying or reciting the name of HaShem?\"</strong></p>\n<p>This is derived from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.5.11-31?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bemidbar 5:11-31</a> discussing the subject of the <em>Suspected Adulteress</em>. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.5.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BeMidbar 5:18</a> it emphasizes that the hair of the <em><strong>wife</strong> suspected of adultery</em> will be uncovered as part of the ritual to be performed.</p>\n<p>What is emphasized here is that the normal state of being for a <strong>married Jewish woman</strong> is for her hair to be covered at all times. And when her hair is uncovered, she is considered to be naked. But prior to a wife having her first physical relations with her husband, merely having her hair in braids is sufficient like was the case with Chava, Adam's wife.</p>\n<p>And it is in the general context that any Jewish individual, meaning male or female, is forbidden to utter Holy words while naked, that the prohibition would be learned out for females too. And this prohibition is learned from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.15?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 23:15</a> which states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ מִתְהַלֵּ֣ךְ ׀ בְּקֶ֣רֶב מַחֲנֶ֗ךָ לְהַצִּֽילְךָ֙ וְלָתֵ֤ת אֹיְבֶ֙יךָ֙ לְפָנֶ֔יךָ <strong>וְהָיָ֥ה מַחֲנֶ֖יךָ קָד֑וֹשׁ וְלֹֽא־יִרְאֶ֤ה בְךָ֙ עֶרְוַ֣ת דָּבָ֔ר</strong> וְשָׁ֖ב מֵאַחֲרֶֽיךָ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That we are prohibited from having any kind of nakedness found in regard to us when G-d's presence is revealed in our domain and proximity.</p>\n\n\n",

But perhaps our commentators have more convincing answers.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Torah_Temimah_on_Torah%2C_Deuteronomy.21.11.3?lang=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Torah Temimah in a footnote</a> asks this exact question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש להעיר בעיקר כלל זה לא דברה תורה אלא כנגד יצה\"ר, הלא לפי\"ז לא שבקית קיום לכל מצוה, דנימא דכיון שאפשר שיעבור באיסור נתיר לו שיעשה בהיתר, וי\"ל דלא נאמר כלל זה אלא במלחמה, דאז צריך שיהי' רוח כל איש נכון בקרבו ולא יצער נפשו כדי שיוכל לעמוד בקשרי מלחמה, וכמבואר בס\"פ שופטים בענין החוזרים ממערכות המלחמה, ויתכן לומר דמטעם זה הותרו קותלי דחזירי במלחמה כמבואר בחולין י\"ז א' ולפנינו לעיל בפ' ואתחנן בפסוק ובתים מלאים כל טוב (ו' י\"א)</p>\n<p>And there is to analyze in the rule of \"the Torah only spoke towards the evil inclination (Yetzer Hara)\", we should say that every single sin should have a permissible way to do it?! No. Rather, this is not a general rule, but a specific rule for wartime. At war, everyone needs to have an ease of spirit, and therefore we relax certain restrictions (as seen in various places in the Talmud) in order to create a more comfortable mindset.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The notion of Yefas Toar is something that is very hard to comprehend. However when taken within the context of war and the resulting environment, Rabbi Frand helps to paint a clearer picture. He writes <a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/ravfrand-5770-kiseitzei/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>War is an environment the likes of which we should never know. It is a dehumanizing experience, which does crazy things to people. One has only to read the paper and listen to the news about abuses that have taken place in recent times, in and around situations of war and conflict. War has a pernicious and corrosive effect, even on people who are spiritually elevated. That is how such a thing can happen, as “you will see her in captivity and lust for her”.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.21b.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 21b</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בביאה ראשונה דכ\"ע לא פליגי דשרי דלא דברה תורה אלא כנגד יצר הרע</p>\n<p><em>With regard to the first act of sexual intercourse (between the soldier priest and the gentile woman), everyone agrees that it is permitted, as the Torah spoke only in response to the evil inclination.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.21b.18?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> over there underlines this fact that it is permitted only as a means to deal with the Yetzer Hara.</p>\n<p>The implication is that in the thick of war, Hashem recognises the urges that soldiers may have, and therefore rather than forbid such an act, it is permitted with the caveat that he has to deal with the circumstances, namely, to take care of her and not completely disregard her after being with her.</p>\n<p>This is further clarified by the Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188353/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-8.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Melachim UMilchamos 8:2</a> where it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכֵן בּוֹעֵל אִשָּׁה בְּגֵיוּתָהּ אִם תְּקָפוֹ יִצְרוֹ. אֲבָל לֹא יִבְעָלֶנָּה וְיֵלֵךְ לוֹ. אֶלָּא מַכְנִיסָהּ לְתוֹךְ בֵּיתוֹ. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים כא, יא) \"וְרָאִיתָ בַּשִּׁבְיָה אֵשֶׁת יְפַת תֹּאַר\". וְאָסוּר לִבְעל אוֹתָהּ בִּיאָה שְׁנִיָּה עַד שֶׁיִּשָּׂאֶנָּה</p>\n<p><em>Similarly, a soldier may engage in sexual relations with a woman while she is still a gentile if his natural inclination overcomes him. However, he may not engage in sexual relations with her and then, go on his way. Rather, he must bring her into his home as Deuteronomy 21:11 states 'If you see a beautiful woman among the prisoners...You shall bring her into the midst of your home...' It is forbidden for him to engage in sexual relations with her a second time until he marries her.</em> (Touger Translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So whilst we give those engaged in the battlefield the means to satisfy their urges, it is clear that the yefas toar is not to be treated like a proverbial piece of meat, as the man must duly take responsibility for his actions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Good question. The truth is that during times of war, a soldier is allowed to eat non-kosher food if kosher food is not available. The way the Rambam sounds, allowing foreign women is a similar concession, but the Torah put a <em>restriction</em> on it that the soldier must marry the woman, and not just leave her. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.8.1?ven=Laws_of_Kings_and_Wars._trans._Reuven_Brauner,_2012&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">See here.</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חֲלוּצֵי צָבָא כְּשֶׁיִּכָּנְסוּ בִּגְבוּל הָעַכּוּ''ם וְיִכְבְּשׁוּם וְיִשְׁבּוּ מֵהֶן. מֻתָּר לָהֶן לֶאֱכל נְבֵלוֹת וּטְרֵפוֹת וּבְשַׂר חֲזִיר וְכַיּוֹצֵא בּוֹ אִם יִרְעַב וְלֹא מָצָא מַה יֹּאכַל אֶלָּא מַאֲכָלוֹת אֵלּוּ הָאֲסוּרִים. וְכֵן שׁוֹתֶה יֵין נֶסֶךְ. מִפִּי הַשְּׁמוּעָה לָמְדוּ וּבָתִּים מְלֵאִים כָּל טוּב עָרְפֵּי חֲזִירִים וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶן:<br />\nThose courageous soldiers (or front-line troops) who cross the borders into non-Jewish lands, capture them and take prisoners are permitted to eat non-Kosher meats, swine and so on, if they are hungry and could not find anything to eat except for these forbidden foods. They may also drink wine offered in the service of idolatry. By Tradition we have learned that “houses filled with all good” (Deut. 6:11) means beheaded boar, and the like.<br />\n2\nוְכֵן בּוֹעֵל אִשָּׁה בְּגֵיוּתָהּ אִם תְּקָפוֹ יִצְרוֹ. אֲבָל לֹא יִבְעָלֶנָּה וְיֵלֵךְ לוֹ. אֶלָּא מַכְנִיסָהּ לְתוֹךְ בֵּיתוֹ. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים כא, יא) \"וְרָאִיתָ בַּשִּׁבְיָה אֵשֶׁת יְפַת תֹּאַר\". וְאָסוּר לִבְעל אוֹתָהּ בִּיאָה שְׁנִיָּה עַד שֶׁיִּשָּׂאֶנָּה:<br />\nSimilarly, one may have sexual intercourse with a non-Jewish woman if his lust gets the better of him. But, he must not just have intercourse with her and go. Rather, he must take her home, as it says, “and when you see a Woman of Beauty among the captives” (Deut. 21:11). He may not have intercourse with her a second time until he marries her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reason is generally understood to be that in times of war, when soldiers are focused on basic matters of survival, it is not possible to expect them to strictly adhere to the laws. Therefore, they can eat non-kosher food if necessary, and if they have a strong desire for a woman, they can fulfill it. So the permission granted for a craving is limited to the background situation of a war, but would not apply otherwise.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it permitted to have zodiac symbols in a synagogue?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many shuls in Eastern Europe have painted zodiac symbols (albeit in a rather symbolic manner) on the walls or ceiling. However, it is stated directly in the Mishneh Torah that one may not draw the constellations, and in Rambam's Commentary on the Mishna, it is stated that this does not refer to simply drawing the stars, but rather drawing the symbolic depictions of these stars and the like (for example, Venus as a young maiden). The sages clearly do consider the constellations to be real heavenly servants of Hashem, just as the cherubim are. So why was this not only permitted, but permitted in a house of worship?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SvVdQ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/SvVdQ.jpg\" alt=\"Shul in Gwoździec\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fkLRf.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fkLRf.png\" alt=\"Shul in Chodorow\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/r121s.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/r121s.jpg\" alt=\"Shul in Krakow\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Mishneh Torah is clear that these depictions may not exist in a synagogue. However, certain things just make it through the fences the Rabbi's put up to block something. Zodiac symbols are found throughout many of the oldest synagogues in Israel and in other parts of the world. These synagogues were sometimes considered extra beautiful and ornate in other ways that would set them apart from what might be called the more \"traditional\" synagogues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/astrology-in-the-ancient-synagogue/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Rabbi's in the Talmud struggled with the Zodiac use in the synagogues, as did the Rabbis after them, and the Rabbis after them...</a>. And yet somehow it persisted throughout the centuries. Another one of these odd outlawed phenomena that withstood the test of time was round tefillin. Not only were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefillin#/media/File:Cairo_Genizah_tefillin_shel_yad.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">round tefillin found in the Cairo Genizah</a>, but <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12125-phylacteries\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an old depiction of tefillin also shows a cylindrical tefillin shape.</a></p>\n<p>So the answer is no. It's not permitted to have zodiac symbols in a synagogue according to the Talmud and Mishneh Torah. It hasn't been permitted for a long time. But the children of Israel did it anyways.</p>\n\n\n",

It is only due to the fact that He also has gifted us with Middas HaRachamim (the attribute of mercy) that we have the ability to correct our past misdeeds, and through Teshuva (repentance) we can erase  previous sins in their entirety.</p>\n<p>Yet the above cited Gemara demonstrates that regret uproots all of one's mitzvos and therefore how can the Ramchal say that the power of teshuva stems from middas harachamim? It would seem that the notion of 'regret' is strong enough on its own merit - i.e. in the same way regret can erase the bad, it can also erase the good? The implication from mesillas yesharim is that Hashem alone has the capacity to erase sin whereas our Gemara says that the power lies with regretting the action.</p>\n<p>He brings two answers from his Rebbi the Chofetz Chaim that; 1 - teshuva mei'yirah (repentance borne out of fear) spurs a person on to repent out of fear of the possible punishment and not through regret. 2 - Conversely if the repentance was borne out of love (teshuva mei'ahava) it helps to reformat the act into a mitzvah, but doesn't erase the sin.</p>\n<p>So it would seem that regret is a different element in its own merit. At this point I started hunting around on the internet to see if anyone builds off Rav Wasserman's point and I found an amazing article <a href=\"http://beisvaad.blogspot.com/2010/09/nitzavim-devarim-teshuva-on-aveiros.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Also, I wonder, what kind of Toheh is the Gemara in Kiddushin talking about?  Is it talking about a Toheh that matches the Teshuva we are told to do?  Is a man called a Toheh only if he deliberately and thoughtfully reexamines the mitzvos he did, is deeply ashamed of them, mournfully regrets doing them, and makes a firm conscious decision to never do mitzvos again?  Does he have to re-create himself, as the Rambam says of the Baal Teshuva?  I doubt it. It means just what it says: that he regrets having done the mitzvos. If that's enough to erase mitzvos, why wouldn't similar regret be enough to completely erase aveiros?  Why does teshuva require the wrenching effort of בְּכָל לְבָבְךָ וּבְכָל נַפְשֶׁךָ?</em></p>\n<p><em>Unfortunately, this all seems to point toward something I've often quoted from a well known and highly respected Mashgiach that I've had business with.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Good Comes and Goes, but Bad is Forever.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>He didn't put it in those exact words, but pretty close, and I think the aphorism sums up his philosophy, that a spiritual fall generates an indelible change that forever increases the risk of relapse. Spiritual advances, on the other hand, are fragile, easily lost, and effortlessly extirpated. They disappear easily, and when they do, they don't leave a trace.</em></p>\n<p><em>Reb Yitzchak Hutner in his Pachad Yitzchok answered Reb Elchonon's question along the same lines (minus the cynicism.)  He said that going from life to death is part of the teva, the natural order of Hashem's universe.  Going from death to life is not.  Order requires constant energy, while disorder is the default state.  Anyone can be meimis a chai.  Not everyone can be mechayeh a meis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, our bad middos take root quicker and are harder to uproot than our good middos. As such, 'toheh' - regret is a more natural, in borne reaction and so would seemingly take effect quicker, whilst the notion of teshuva is something that supersedes the natural world and requires Hashem's input. So regret by mitzvos is effectively a person naturally coming to the conclusion that he harbours remorse at the good actions he completed in his lifetime and is willing to forgo their fulfilment. Alternatively, the desire to do Hashem's will is what drives our mitzvah fulfilment - thus if you do the mitzvah without intending for it to be a mitzvah, you haven't done anything. Whereas, an aveira when done fleetingly, is still considered an aveira. So when the person in the gemara regrets his mitzvos, he is for want of a better word, completely disregarding their performance and therefore it is like he never did them.</p>\n\n\n",

As Ramchal explains in Derech Hashem, G-d is the ultimate source of good, and created the world to bestow goodness on others. Doing bad would be against G-d's purpose. G-d gave humans the choice between good and bad so that they can exercise free will and so-to-speak \"earn\" their reward.</p>\n<p>In other words, the opportunity to do bad is ultimately for their good, because it makes their choice to do good much more meaningful.

God says through the prophet Isaiah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Oseh shalom uvoreh ra’ [I make peace and create evil];\nAni HaShem ‘oseh chol elleh [I am the Lord who does all these things] [Isaiah 45:5,7]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our faith consists of believing that whatever God does that may appear \"evil\" to us ultimately has a \"good\" purpose.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I once heard a rabbi (whose name I will not mention for privacy reasons) say an interesting interpretation of the episode of the golden calf (Exodus 32). During this episode, G-d makes what according to him an \"evil\" decree to destroy all of Israel. However, Moses pleaded with G-d, and like Abraham, questioned the divine decree. Thus, God repented of His \"evil\" (Exodus 32, 14). Now, I do not agree with this interpretation at all. But it does seem to suggest that G-d <em>can do evil.</em>  In other words, G-d has free will, which begs the question, is G-d's \"will\" similar to human will?</p>\n<p>Maimonides writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Humans are given free will. If a person wants to take the good path\nand be righteous, he is free to do so; and if he desires to take the\nevil one and be wicked, he can do so ... The Creator doesn’t preordain\nman to be good or evil” (Mishneh Torah, Teshuvah 5:1–23).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, people have a  yetzer ha’ra, an evil inclination,  and a yetzer ha’tov, a good inclination (BT, Berakhot 61a). People can choose to be good or evil. This begs the question, why does G-d \"allow\" humans to act evil? Rabbi Harold Kushner opines that G-d lacks the power to prevent evil. He seems to say that G-d is not all-powerful. Others insist that G-d can prevent evil, but choose not to; so humans can exercise their free will. Maimonides felt that G-d is good and does not do evil. I agree with Maimonides.</p>\n<p>Since G-d is transcendent, it follows that He is not subjected to the laws of nature (ie no limitations). Since humans have free will, so does G-d, but G-d's “will” is totally unlike human will. G-d cannot suddenly change His mind. Where humans are subjected to the natural forces (ie, a human's will may be changed due to external factors; for example, if a person is hungry and lacks food he will have no desire to study but be aroused by food, in short, a change in will), Divine will, in contrast, is spontaneous and self-creating. This was how Rambam was able to justify the creation of the world in Genesis 1. It was G-d’s will to create the world. G-d “willed” creation into existence. But G-d's \"will\" is not subject to natural laws nor external causes, since it is an independent cause (Guide, 2:18).</p>\n<p>For the “fear of G-d is the hatred of evil” (Proverbs 8, 13).</p>\n\n\n",

The following are but two examples:</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.3.13?lang=bi&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.3.24&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Shulchan Aruch</strong> <em>Orach Chaim</em> 3:13</a> it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא ישתין מעומד מפני ניצוצות הניתזין על רגליו</p>\n<p>One should not urinate from a standing position lest it sprinkle down upon his legs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>Mishnah Berurah</strong> explains from the <em>gemarra</em> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.13a.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Niddah</strong> 13a</a> that if it sprinkles on his legs, people will think he has an injury, making him infertile. They will then conclude that his children aren't his, but rather his wife committed adultery, making the children <em>mamzerim</em>.</p>\n<p>A second example is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.128.5?lang=bi&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.128.15&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Shulchan Aruch</strong> <em>Orach Chaim</em> 128:5</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא יעלו הכהנים לדוכן במנעלים אבל בבתי שוקים שרי:</p>\n<p>Kohanim may not ascend to the platform in shoes, but in socks it is permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>Mishnah Berurah</strong> explains from the <em>gemarra</em> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.40a.15?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Sotah 40a</strong></a> that if we allow them to wear shoes, maybe one of their shoes' laces will come undone, and it will be embarrassing for them to go up. They'll subsequently spend time tying them, missing the opportunity to bless the people. People will notice that he didn't go up, and suspect him of not being a <em>kosher</em> Kohen.</p>\n<p>These are but two examples of concerns that people will make extremely far-fetched negative conclusions. On the other hand, I've encountered the opposite. The <em>gemarra</em> assumes people will make extremely far-fetched <strong>positive</strong> conclusions.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.15a.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Yevamos</strong> 15a</a> is discussing the prohibition of <em>lo sisgodedu</em>, where you can't have splintered groups of Jews together following different rulings. The <em>gemarra</em> brings an example from Shammai, who followed his own opinion, when it would seemingly be an issue of <em>lo sisgodedu</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מתיב מר זוטרא מעשה וילדה כלתו של שמאי הזקן ופיחת את המעזיבה וסיכך על גבי מטה בשביל קטן ש\"מ עשו התם הרואה אומר לאפושי אויר קעביד</p>\n<p>§ Mar Zutra raised an objection to this issue from a different source: There was an incident in which the daughter-in-law of Shammai the Elder gave birth to a son. In Shammai’s opinion this newborn baby is immediately obligated in the mitzva to sit in a sukka, and he therefore removed the mortar [ma’aziva] covering the ceiling and he placed sukka covering over the bed for the minor. Conclude from here that Beit Shammai did act in accordance with their opinions. The Gemara answers: There is no proof from there, as anyone watching would say that he did it merely to increase the air. Since people would not necessarily think that he removed the mortar as a ruling of halakha, this behavior is not considered the formation of a faction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is very far-fetched to assume that in the middle of Sukkos, Shammai removed the mortar and put up <em>schach</em> over a child, when we know his opinion is children that young need to be in the Sukkah, that he did so only to make the room \"more breezy\". We see that we go very far to avoid suspecting people of wrongdoing (<em>lo sisgodedu</em>), yet in the earlier examples people aren't assumed to judge so favorably.</p>\n<p>Does anyone address this seeming contradiction? It doesn't have to be these specific examples. Just a source which addresses far-fetched positive and negative conclusions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would argue that there may be a fundamental difference between the cases you cite. In the first two cases the entire issue is what people will think. We don't want people to think that children are <em>mamzerim</em> or that <em>kohanim</em> are invalid, so all that matters is whether people will think it or not. Thus, even if it seems somewhat farfetched for someone to think this, we still advise against the action, because we want to go to great lengths to avoid these misunderstandings.</p>\n<p><em>Lo Sisgodedu</em>, on the other hand, is a halachic category. The issue itself is not what people will think; rather the issue is whether your action falls into the halachic category. Therefore, what people will think of your action is relevant only insofar as it affects the definition of the halachic category. The definition of the halachic category doesn't have to care about what types of thoughts are more likely; it simply has to define what it means to \"create factions\". Thus, if your actions can be explained in some way other than that you are making factions, that may fit the definition of (not) creating factions, even if the majority of observers (or even all of them) would not interpret your actions that way.</p>\n<p>Compare this to the Gemara's discussion a couple of pages earlier about working on <em>Erev Pesach</em>. There it is not a problem of <em>Lo Sisgodedu</em> to not work, because הרואה אומר מלאכה הוא דלית ליה – observers would say that he's not working merely because he has no work to do. Here, too, one could debate the believability of such a claim. What if I know that the person does have work to do? Again, I would argue that it doesn't matter. The point is not whether an individual or group of people will think that you are deliberately not working or not. The point is that you can't be said to making factions when you can provide an alternate explanation of your actions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It appears to me that the difference between the two cases that you quote are that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא ישתין מעומד מפני ניצוצות הניתזין על רגליו</p>\n<p>One should not urinate from a standing position lest it sprinkle down\nupon his legs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fundamentally relates to a lowly function of the human body, and people will be drawn after that lowliness to draw lowly conclusions.</p>\n<p>Whereas the other source that you quote wherein Shammai opened the roof over his grandson so that he could be in a Succah relates to something beautiful and pleasant - a <em>mitzva</em>.</p>\n<p>Regarding something beautiful and pleasant, people are liable to come to pleasant and positive conclusions.</p>\n<p>A <em>kashye</em> on the above explanation is from Menachos 35a</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.35a.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.35a.11?lang=bi</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר יצחק רצועות שחורות הלכה למשה מסיני מיתיבי תפילין אין קושרין אותן\nאלא במינן בין ירוקות בין שחורות בין לבנות אדומות לא יעשה מפני גנאי\nודבר אחר</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The requirement that the straps of the\nphylacteries be black is a halakha transmitted to Moses from Sinai.\nThe Gemara raises an objection from a baraita: One may tie\nphylacteries only with straps of their same type, i.e., the straps\nmust be made from hide, and it does not matter whether they are green,\nor black, or white. Nevertheless, one should not make red straps,\nbecause this is deprecatory to him, as it looks like he has wounds on\nhis head, and also due to something else, i.e., lest people suspect\nhim of engaging in sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman and\ngetting blood on the straps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in this case, he is doing a <em>mitzva</em> and yet people may suspect him of something most repugnant.</p>\n<p>I think the answer to that would be that since the <em>retzuos</em> hang in that (possibly) \"lowly\" part of the body, you can still have that lowly association.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Perhaps the difference is in the topic.

But I can't quite follow what this defence is. Can anyone help?</p>\n<p>TLDR: Please can someone help me understand Chazon Ish, Machshirin <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14338&st=&pgnum=429&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">2:2</a> and <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14338&st=&pgnum=433\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3:1</a>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish (2:2) is saying that moisture leaving the mouth is an intrinsic part of the act of blowing from the mouth. The fact that you blew intentionally means that the moistening was part of the same intentional action. On the other hand, if you hide or float vegetables in a river, there are two actions, putting it there and moistening it. Even if the act of moistening it is a necessary consequence of the intentional act of putting it there, the act of moistening it was not intentional.</p>\n<p>Of course, this distinction is only according to the Sages: Rabbi Shimon would still hold that blowing on lentils doesn't count as putting water on them.</p>\n<p>In 3:1 he notes again that the fact that something is a necessary consequence doesn't always make it intentional, adducing our Mishna (1:6) as proof.</p>\n\n\n",

It is clearly, deeply kabbalstic, and I can't say I understand it totally, but it does somewhat help to unify all these disparate viewpoints.</p>\n<p>The main points are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Regarding Pinchas’ birth it says, “Elazar the son of Aharon took a daughter of Potiel for a wife and Pinchas was born” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.6.25?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 6:25</a>). On this Chazal say: Potiel-this is Yosef, “sh’patpet” (controlled) his yetzer hara; this is Yisro, “sh’patem” (fattened) calves for idol worship. <strong>This is the sod: when Pinchas was born, he incorporated two soul-sparks</strong>. This is the meaning: “Potiel,” which is similar to “tippin” (drops), for he was from two soul-drops, one spark from the root of Yosef HaTzaddik and the second spark was from the side of Yisro. This level that incorporates these two souls is called “Pinchas.” (Sha’ar HaGilgulim, Chapter 32)</em></p>\n<p><em>Thus, Pinchas was like a spiritual time bomb waiting to go off. <strong>Though he may not have been conscious of it himself, there was something in him waiting to burst forth when the time was right.</strong> All it would take was the proper ignition, and then the two soul-sparks that Pinchas contained would reveal themselves through his act of zealousness......</em></p>\n<p><em>... The soul that comes to a man when he is born is an actual gilgul, even if it is the combination of two sparks, as in the case of Pinchas who had a spark of Yosef and a spark from Yisro. Nothing else is required to coalesce them. (Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p><em>In other words, they automatically join with the body and remain with it until the person dies; the body cannot survive without them, and they cannot leave the body before its time is up. However:</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>In the case of a soul that comes b’sod ibur after birth, like the Nefesh of Nadav and Avihu that came to Pinchas, another spark must accompany it. Furthermore, this spark must be new to the world and not a reincarnation.</strong> Such a spark joined with the Nefesh of Nadav and Avihu that came b’ibur, to unify it with the Nefesh of Pinchas, which was an actual reincarnation. <strong>Therefore, another new soul had to come b’ibur in Pinchas called “Eliyahu HaTishbi” from the inhabitants of Gilad, and from the root of Gad, which was a new soul at that time.</strong> This was in order to combine the Nefesh of Nadav and Avihu with the Nefesh of Pinchas itself, a gilgul from the time of his birth. (Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Thus, reviewing the composition of Pinchas’ soul, we find that he was born with a soul-spark from both Yosef HaTzaddik and Yisro, Moshe’s father-in-law. This was the soul with which he was born, and which made him Pinchas ben Elazar HaKohen, and with which he would have died, had he not metamorphosed into a new being called “Eliyahu HaNavi.”</em></p>\n<p><em>However, when he acted zealously by killing Zimri and Cozbi in last week’s parshah, he inherited two additional souls, that of Nadav and Avihu, which, apparently, had been on a long journey through history in the process of tikun. Since these were not Pinchas’ main souls, they could come and go as was necessary, enhancing Pinchas’ spiritual ability, and therefore required something to “bind” them to him. <strong>That extra soul is called, “Eliyahu HaTishbi” from the root of Gad.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Thus, Eliyahu who never died, but had ascended to Heaven in a fiery chariot to become an angel, had not been born either. He was a soul that entered and attached itself to an existing person, Pinchas ben Elazar.</em></p>\n<p><em>And, as if that wasn’t confusing enough, the Arizal explained further:</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>He also required an additional new soul in order to unite the new soul called “Eliyahu HaTishbi” with the rest of the older souls, that is, the Nefesh of Pinchas and that of Nadav and Avihu. Therefore, he received an additional soul called “Eliyahu” from the root of Binyomin, mentioned in Divrei HaYomim in the posuk, “And Ya’areshyah, Eliyahu, and Zichri were the sons of Yerucham” (I Divrei HaYomim 8:27)</strong>, as Eliyahu himself wrote to the Chachamim, “from the children of the children of Rachel” (Bereishis Rabbah 71:12) . . . Thus we find that four levels were in Pinchas. The first was that of the Nefesh of Pinchas with which he was born, a single soul even though it was the combination of two drops, one from Yosef and one from Yisro. The second level was the Nefesh of Nadav and Avihu, which came b’sod ibur and was also called “one soul,” as is known from the Zohar: Nadav and Avihu were two limbs of one body (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.3.57b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Acharei Mos 57b</a>). <strong>The third was a Nefesh called “Eliyahu HaTishbi” from the root of Gad, and the fourth level was “Eliyahu” from the root of Binyomin.</strong> (Ibid.)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Such a\nwoman is referred to as a kedeshah. When the Torah was given,\n(relations with) a kedeshah became forbidden, as (Devarim 23:18\nstates): \"There shall not be a kedeshah among the children of Israel.\"\nTherefore, a person who has relations with a woman “leshem zenut”,\nwithout kiddushin, receives lashes as prescribed by the Torah, because\nhe had relations with a kedeshah”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The expression \"leshem zenut\" used here by Rambam is usually translated into English as \"for the sake of lust\" or \"for the purpose of fornication\"; however, it is not clear whether the text should be read \"leshem zenut, that is without kiddushin\", or \"leshem zenut and without kiddushin\". The difference between the two hypotheses of interpretation is very large, since in the first case the textual incision \"leshem zenut\" would be a mere explanatory note relating to the absence of kiddushin; in the second hypothesis, however, it should be concluded that,according to Rambam,the commission of such violation requires the coexistence of two different conditions: the absence of kiddushin and the presence of \"leshem zenut\".</p>\n<p>Ramban's interpretation is oriented in this second direction, as explained in</p>\n<p><strong>Teshuvot haRashba Meyuchas LehaRamban No. 284</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“And also in regard to the words of the Rambam (Rabbi Moshe ben\nMaimon), of Blessed Memory, they are not intended to forbid the\nPilegesh relationship to a commoner and permit it to a king. Rather,\nthis is what he said: “a person who has relations with a woman “leshem\nzenut”, without kiddushin, receives lashes as prescribed by the Torah,\nbecause he had relations with a kedeshah”. “Leshem zenut” means he\ncontacted and engaged in sex with her and did not render the\nrelationship exclusive to him for the purpose of establishing a\nPilegesh form of relationship, which thus rendered her a\nkedeshah.Therefore, Rabbi Moshe of Blessed Memory did not say that\nanyone who has sex (simply) without kiddushin is flogged”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How shared is this interpretation of Ramban in the Jewish tradition?</p>\n\n\n",

The earliest printed, full edition of the Talmud (Venice, 1522) did not include these Halachic summaries. Instead, the remainder of the page after the end of chapter four (Daf 57b) and chapter nine (Daf 99a) was left blank, just as the remainder of the last page of every Maseches is left blank. Apparently, at the time of the Venice printing of the Talmud, \"Pesach Rishon\" and \"Pesach Sheni\" were still treated as distinct Masechtos, and it was deemed inappropriate to begin one on the same page that the other ended. At a later time these Halachic summaries were added as page-fillers. <strong>These Halachic summaries are based almost exclusively on the Rambam's rulings, with a small number of rulings culled from other Rishonim added in parentheses (which might be from a later date).

    "content": "# Sterilization permissible?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>After a man and wife had several children, would it be permissible for a man or woman to be sterilized?</p>\n<p>Any scriptural proof to show whether or not it is allowed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rav Hershel Schachter writes at length about it <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/735664/rabbi-hershel-schachter/halachic-aspects-of-family-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>He writes at a basic level:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The common American practices of \"tying the tubes\" of a woman or performing a vasectomy on the man are biblically forbidden (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.110b.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 110b</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then explores doing it through medication:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, the permissibility of sterilizing a woman through medication is explained by the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.111a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 111a</a>) to apply only in such a case where the husband will not be prevented thereby from fulfilling his mitzvah of Piryah V'riuyah. Even in that case, the Acharonim debate the nature of this permissibility. Most feel (See Otzar Haposkim to Even Ho'ezer in note 77.) that non-surgical forms of sterilization are not forbidden for women. Some, however, rule that there still exists a rabbinic prohibition which may only be lifted if the woman is known to suffer unusual pain at childbirth. According to this view, this Heter (lenient ruling) is similar to the law allowing violation of rabbinic prohibitions on Shabbos for the sake of a sick person (Choleh She'ein bo Sakona) even though there is clearly no danger of life or limb. \"In a situation of pain (tza'ar) the Rabbis did not insist upon the observance of their prohibitions.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.60a.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos 60a</a>)</p>\n<p>The Talmud relates (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.65b.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 65b</a>) that the wife of Rabbi Chiya suffered unusual pain during childbirth. She drank a special potion of herbs to make herself sterile, without the previous consent of her husband. The Chasam Sofer (Quoted by Pischei Teshuvah to Even Ho'ezer (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pithei_Teshuva_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pithei_Teshuva_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">11</a>, and 232). See also the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1347&st=&pgnum=159&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avnei Nezer, Choshen Mishpot. no. 127</a>. where the same distinction is made.) points out that such action would only be allowed in Talmudic times, when her husband would have the option of marrying another wife if he desired more children. The wife's causing herself to be sterile did not interfere with his ability to fulfill his mitzvah. Today, however, since we no longer allow polygamy or divorce without the wife's consent, it is understood that when a couple marries, the wife obligates herself to assist her husband in fulfilling both his mitzvot of Piryah V'rivyah and Lo'Erev al larlach yodecha (See Lev Avraham (#99) where this point of the Chasam sofer is explained at length. See also <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1346&st=&pgnum=137&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avnei Nezer, Even Ho'ezer. no. 79</a> where he assumes that even during Talmudic times the same was true). She may therefore not cause herself to become sterile or practice any form of contraception without the consent of her husband (Regarding temporary use of contraceptives by the wife, without the permission of her husband, see Chavazelet Hasharon, Even Ho'ezer pgs. 229-231.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His take on the man taking medication:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Modern medicine has developed an oral medication to be taken by the man which causes temporary sterility. Since causing sterility in the male is forbidden even by \"drinking a potion,\" would causing temporary sterility also be included under this prohibition? Dayan Ehrenberg has written a lengthy responsum, (D'var Yehoshua, vol. III, Even Ho'ezer, no. 7) concluding with a lenient decision. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (Even Ho'Ezer, vol 3, no 15. See Chazon Ish, Nashim 12) assumes that causing sterility is only forbidden when the potion the male drinks affects the reproductive organ directly. But to cause even permanent sterility by affecting other parts of the body would not be prohibited. Other contemporary Poskim question the validity of both of these lenient decisions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the question of whether it considered like self-harm:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It should be borne in mind that the case specifically mentioned in the Talmud allowing non-surgical sterilization of a woman was in a situation where this was medically recommended. Rabbi Chiya's wife suffered great pain during childbirth. However, if the non-surgical sterilization is done for non-medical considerations, some Poskim (See Torat Chesed, Even Ho'ezer, no. 44, section 41.) have pointed out that this would constitute a separate violation of Chavoloh - one is not allowed to mutilate his own body (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.91b.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 91b</a>). Even the slight act of self-mutilization involved in donating blood to the Red Cross is a serious question dealt with by contemporary Poskim (See <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=918&st=&pgnum=166&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igros Moshe, Choshen Mishpot, no. 103</a>; Pischei Teshuvah to Yoreh Deah chap. 151, section 15.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In principle, this is forbidden. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.110b.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 110b</a>, which derives the prohibition from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.22.24?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 22:24</a>.</p>\n<p>Rambam rules as such in Hilchot Issurei Biah 16:10-12, as does R. Yosef Karo in Shulchan Aruch Even HaEzer 5:11-13.</p>\n<p>See there for discussion of distinctions between sterilizing males and females, and between more or less direct forms of sterilization.</p>\n\n\n",

I do not understand why we bless God. Why would God need our blessing? This makes no sense to me. Even calling God blessed doesn't make any sense because it implies that God is blessed by something/someone/some entity else. Here are some examples of things that I don't understand:\nברכו את ה' המבורך,\nברוך ה' המבורך...,\nיתברך וישתבח...,\nברוך אתה ה'...</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Welcome to Mi Yodeya!</p>\n<p>There are many different kinds of brachot, and as there should be, the blessings serve different purposes.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/he-il/toshba/rambam/ahava/brachot/brachot1.htm?printview=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> who explains there are three categories of Brachot.</p>\n<p>(I will arrange this in a different order to make it more simple for the question)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first category of Brachot is Birchot Shevach V'Hodaah. This is a Bracha, as the Rambam explains, to give thanks and gratitude to G-d. I believe this is where you find the biggest problem - why do we need to glorify G-d in this way?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is why we must look at the second part of the sentence where Rambam states this, and he says כדי לזכור את הבורא תמיד, וליראה ממנו, to remember the Creator constantly and fear from Him. When we exalt and praise G-d, it instill within us a sense of the glory of G-d, and it is in action which causes US to become better human beings. Rambam clearly has echoes of the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.43b.15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 43b</a>, which explains this <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.10.12?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pasuk</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עַתָּה֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל מָ֚ה יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ שֹׁאֵ֖ל מֵעִמָּ֑ךְ כִּ֣י אִם־לְ֠יִרְאָה אֶת־יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ לָלֶ֤כֶת בְּכָל־דְּרָכָיו֙ וּלְאַהֲבָ֣ה אֹת֔וֹ וְלַֽעֲבֹד֙ אֶת־יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ בְּכָל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכָל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ׃</p>\n<p>And now, O Israel, what does the LORD your God demand of you? Only this: to revere the LORD your God, to walk only in His paths, to love Him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and soul,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>as saying that we should make 100 Brachot a day (which is actually a commandment).</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p>The Second category is Birchot Hanaah. This is a blessing on receiving pleasure from this world. As the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.35a.19?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brachot 35a</a> explains, this is a transferring of ownership. The whole world belongs to G-d, and we have to make a blessing in order to benefit from it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The final category is a Birchat Hamitzvah, a blessing on a Mitzvah (done right before a Mitzvah).\nThe Gemara in many place (ex., <a href=\"http://sefaria.org/Pesachim.7b.9?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 7b</a>) writes that this is a commandment.\nThe Ritva, a prominent Rishon, on that Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ritva_on_Pesachim.7b.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a> that there are two reasons for a Birchat Hamitzvah:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>a. To reveal our intent that we are doing this Mitzvah for G-d, and not for any other purpose.</p>\n<p>b. To put the worship using the soul before the worship using our bodies.</p>\n<p>In summary, there are three kinds of Brachot:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Praise,</li>\n<li>Pleasure,</li>\n<li>Mitzvah.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I believe you found a problem with the Bracha of praise (1). As I hope we explained well, it is a form of recognizing how lofty G-d is and it is meant to instill within us a sense of fear.</p>\n\n\n",

The <strong>Shulchan Aruch</strong> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המנהג פשוט בכל בני ספרד שאין מזכירין פסוקי קרבן מוסף כלל</p>\n<p>The widespread custom in all the <em>Sefardic</em> countries is not to mention any verses of the Mussaf Offering</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is referring to not saying both the Rosh Hashanah Mussaf offerings <strong>and</strong> the Rosh Chodesh Mussaf offerings.</p>\n<p>Whereas, the <strong>Rema</strong> there rules:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והמנהג הפשוט באשכנז ובגלילות אלו לומר פסוקי מוסף ראש השנה ואין אומרים פסוקי מוסף ראש חודש אלא אומרים מלבד עולת החודש ומנחתה ועולת התמיד ומנחתה וכו' ושני שעירים לכפר ושני תמידים כהלכתם</p>\n<p>And the widespread custom in <em>Ashkenaz</em> and the surrounding areas is to say the verses of Mussaf for Rosh Hashanah, but not to say the verses of Mussar for Rosh Chodesh. Except for \"the Olah offering of the New Month, and its Mincha offering, and the daily Olah offering, and its Mincha offering...and two goats to atone and two daily offerings according to their laws\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, what's the reason for this? (Their dispute is the topic for a different question) The <strong>Rema</strong>'s custom comes from <strong>Rabbeinu Tam</strong>, brought by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.35a.5?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Rosh_Hashanah.35a.5&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Tosafos</strong></a> to <strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> 35a <em>s.v.</em> אילמא who explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מקראות של מוסף צריך להזכיר לעולם שהם במקום הקרבנות אבל מוסף דר\"ח אין צריך להזכיר בר\"ה אלא שדי לו במה שאמר מלבד עולת החדש ומנחתה שבזה נכלל כל מוספי ר\"ח העולות וכדי להזכיר גם השעיר שהוא חטאת יאמר ושני שעירים לכפר ושני תמידים כהלכתן</p>\n<p>The verses of Mussaf always need to be mentioned, as they're in place of bringing the offerings. However, the Mussaf of Rosh Chodesh doesn't need to be mentioned on Rosh Hashanah. Rather, it's sufficient to say \"besides the Olah of Rosh Chodesh and its Mincha offering\", as this includes all the Mussaf offerings of Rosh Chodesh that are an Olah. As well, in order to mention the goats which are a Chatas, say \"and the two goats for atonement, and the two daily offerings according ot their laws\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, he doesn't fully explain why not mention the verses. He just says that the verses of Rosh Hashanah allude to the offerings of Rosh Chodesh, and it's sufficient to say those verses (presumably for brevity).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bach%2C_Orach_Chaim.591.4.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Bach</strong> <em>ad. loc.</em></a> tries to provide a more detailed explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נראה לומר דמה שאינו מזכיר של ר\"ח בפירוש ה\"ט מדאסיקנא זכרון אחד עולה לכאן ולכאן פי' שאינו אומר את יום ר\"ח הזה כו' אלא את יום הזכרון הזה לבד ומשמע דלכל ענייניו קאמר דזכרון דר\"ה עולה לר\"ח לפיכך בהזכירו מקראות דמוסף דראש השנה ואומר בלבד ג\"כ חשיב ליה כאילו הכל נכלל בזכרון אחד...‏</p>\n<p>It appears that the reason why don't explicitly mention [the Mussaf offerings] of Rosh Chodesh is for the following reason: Since we rule that the mentioning of one of the holidays suffices for both. Meaning we don't mention \"this day of Rosh Chodesh\", rather, we say \"this Yom HaZikaron\" alone, which implies all of its aspects.

It is because דמוטב שיבא זכאי ויכפר על החייב, it is better for someone innocent to come and atone for the one who is guilty (instead of the other way around). Rosh Chodesh is called \"guilty\", because <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.60b.4?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hashem (so to speak) needs atonement on Rosh Chodesh for shrinking the Moon</a>, whereas Rosh Hoshanah is called \"innocent\".</p>\n<p>It comes out then that the first two reasons hold it is unnecessary to mention Rosh Chodesh, and the third reason holds its meant to be omitted.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Eruv Chatzeiros for apartment buildings for weeks that the eruv goes down\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone lives in an apartment building with other Jews, do they need to make an <em>eruv chatzeiros</em> (in short: have shared food stored somewhere to make it considered as though they all live there together) to be allowed to carry from their apartment to the hallway or to neighboring apartments when the city's <em>eruv</em> goes down (after a storm or the like)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The short answer is \"Yes\".</p>\n<p>However, a premise in the question is erroneous. An ערוב חצרות is only necessary to carry from the common area into the private area. Therefore, without an ערוב חצרות, it is still permissible to carry within the hallway itself, and one could carry objects that remained in the common from the start of שבת within the common area such as playground toys. See O\"C 366:1 & 372:1 and the משנה ברורה who explicitly permits this. See also באור הלכה on 372:1 about a מחלוקת with regard to items such as a scarf, coat or hat that were worn into the common area, and removed therein. However, one must be careful to then put them back on before entering the apartment.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>\nThis is different than the strings and poles commonly used for encircling neighborhoods, colloquially called \"eruvin\". If the strings went down, then all carrying is prohibited even entirely within the public area, since there are no halachic walls. It is theoretically possible to have poles and strings without the ערוב חצרות, but that would probably be unlikely.</p>\n<p>My grandparents used to live in such a building, where there was one other non-religious family in the entire building, so they never bothered trying to make an ערוב. It was our practice to follow the lenient opinion with regard to clothing worn into the hallway.</p>\n\n\n",

In addition to his kabbalistic texts, Yitsḥak Ayzik also wrote a book of meditative visions, Megilat setarim (1999), modeled after the visionary texts of Ḥayim Vital, revealing what he calls the source of his soul and hinting that he is the Messiah of the House of Joseph.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ma'aseh Oreg is contained in the full set of Mishnayos Komarno as seen <a href=\"https://houses.bidspirit.com/ui/lotPage/source/catalog/auction/9129/lot/17617/Complete-Set-of-Mishnayos-Komarno?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.

Why wouldn't the concept of arvut apply here?  She has opted into a mitzvat aseh shehazman grama, a mitzvah d'oraita. Could a man not say the bracha on netilat lulav or leishev basukkah either if she were performing those mitzvot? Ashkenazi women do say a bracha, so if a woman doesn't know it herself, why couldn't a man with an initial greater obligation say it for her?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Rema explains in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Beit_Yosef%2C_Orach_Chaim.589.5.1?lang=bi&p2=Darchei_Moshe%2C_Orach_Chaim.589.2.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Darchei Moshe</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן מהרי\"ל פסק כדברי ראבי\"ה והרא\"ש. וכתב דאין לתקוע לנשים עד אחר שתקעו בצבור ולא קודם לכן, מיהו אם היא יולדת או חולה ואינה יכולה להמתין יתקע לה מיד. וכתב עוד דהאשה תברך לעצמה ואם לא יכולה לברך יברך התוקע בשבילה. ול\"נ כדברי ב\"י דאם תוקעין לה אחר שיצא לא יברך לה התוקע, דאע\"ג דאין מוחין לנשים המברכות על מצות עשה, מ\"מ מוטב שלא לברך כמ\"ש לעיל סי' י\"ז, אבל לברך אחר בשבילה נראה דאסור, דהרי אמרו כל הברכות כולן אע\"פ שיצא מוציא חוץ מברכת הלחם והיין וה\"ה לכל ברכת הנהנין שאם יצא אינו מוציא הואיל ואינו מחוייב בדבר אסור לברך לחבירו בשבילו, וכ\"ש בברכות אלו שהנשים בעצמן עדיף שלא לברך אלא שאין מוחין בידן שאין לאחר לברך בשבילן. כן נ\"ל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, the Maharil writes that if the woman can not say the beracha herself, the (man) blowing for her should make the beracha for her; but the Rema himself disagrees, since the one saying the beracha is not obligated in that beracha, and even the woman is just allowed to say the beracha even though it is not preferable.</p>\n\n\n",

The heart of all of them is about the same: the person is declaring in advance that if, when near death and not completely sound of mind, he says or thinks anything that amounts to denial of Hashem or His Torah, then he's pre-annulling it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The question reminds me of “Kol Nidrei”.</p>\n<p>In KN, the request is to annul vows.

This explains why even simple Jews, even <em>sinful</em> Jews, throughout history have given up their life rather than renounce their Judaism in any way. The claim, therefore, is that the possibility of a Jew regretting doing a Mitzva is not a realistic possibility, and even if he does, it is just a superficial regret.</p>\n\n\n",

A person who transgresses any of these types of directives transgresses a negative commandment. This is derived from the continuation of the above verse in the following manner: \"According to the laws which they shall instruct you\" - this refers to the edicts, decrees, and customs which they instruct people at large to observe to strengthen the faith and perfect the world. \"According to the judgment which they relate\" - this refers to the matters which they derive through logical analysis employing one of the methods of Biblical exegesis. \"From all things that they will tell you\" - This refers to the tradition which they received one person from another.</p>\n<p>ב</p>\n<p>כָּל מִי שֶׁאֵינוֹ עוֹשֶׂה כְּהוֹרָאָתָן עוֹבֵר בְּלֹא תַּעֲשֶׂה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים יז יא) \"לֹא תָסוּר מִכָּל הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר יַגִּידוּ לְךָ יָמִין וּשְׂמֹאל\". וְאֵין לוֹקִין עַל לָאו זֶה מִפְּנֵי שֶׁנִּתָּן לְאַזְהָרַת מִיתַת בֵּית דִּין. שֶׁכָּל חָכָם שֶׁמּוֹרֶה עַל דִּבְרֵיהֶם מִיתָתוֹ בְּחֶנֶק שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים יז יב) \"וְהָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה בְזָדוֹן\" וְגוֹ'. אֶחָד דְּבָרִים שֶׁלָּמְדוּ אוֹתָן מִפִּי הַשְּׁמוּעָה וְהֵם תּוֹרָה שֶׁבְּעַל פֶּה. וְאֶחָד דְּבָרִים שֶׁלְּמַּדוּם מִפִּי דַּעְתָּם בְּאַחַת מִן הַמִּדּוֹת שֶׁהַתּוֹרָה נִדְרֶשֶׁת בָּהֶן וְנִרְאָה בְּעֵינֵיהֶם שֶׁדָּבָר זֶה כָּךְ הוּא. וְאֶחָד דְּבָרִים שֶׁעֲשָׂאוּם סְיָג לַתּוֹרָה וּלְפִי מַה שֶּׁהַשָּׁעָה צְרִיכָה וְהֵן הַגְּזֵרוֹת וְהַתַּקָּנוֹת וְהַמִּנְהָגוֹת. כָּל אֶחָד וְאֶחָד מֵאֵלּוּ הַשְּׁלֹשָׁה דְּבָרִים מִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה לִשְׁמֹעַ לָהֶן. וְהָעוֹבֵר עַל כָּל אֶחָד מֵהֶן עוֹבֵר בְּלֹא תַּעֲשֶׂה. הֲרֵי הוּא אוֹמֵר (דברים יז יא) \"עַל פִּי הַתּוֹרָה אֲשֶׁר יוֹרוּךָ\" אֵלּוּ הַתַּקָּנוֹת וְהַגְּזֵרוֹת וְהַמִּנְהָגוֹת שֶׁיּוֹרוּ בָּהֶם לָרַבִּים כְּדֵי לְחַזֵּק הַדָּת וּלְתַקֵּן הָעוֹלָם. וְעַל הַמִּשְׁפָּט אֲשֶׁר יֹאמְרוּ אֵלּוּ דְּבָרִים שֶׁיִּלְמְדוּ אוֹתָן מִן הַדִּין בְּאַחַת מִן הַמִּדּוֹת שֶׁהַתּוֹרָה נִדְרֶשֶׁת בָּהֶן. מִכָּל הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר יַגִּידוּ לְךָ זוֹ הַקַּבָּלָה שֶׁקִּבְּלוּ אִישׁ מִפִּי אִישׁ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is the partially generated animal dead?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Chullin.9.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Chulin</em>, chapter 9, <em>mishna</em> 6</a>, is discussing the ritual impurity imparted by a dead <em>sheretz</em> (animal of any of certain types). Note that the impurity is imparted only by a <strong>dead</strong> animal. The <em>mishna</em> says (in my own, loose translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A <em>sheretz</em>'s egg containing a sufficiently formed fetus does not impart impurity; if one punctured it a bit, it does. A <em>sheretz</em> generated from the ground that is still half earth: if one touches the flesh, he's impure; the earth, he's pure. Rabbi <em>Y'huda</em> says: if he touches even the ground that is near the flesh, he's impure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(In the latter case, the commentaries explain, Rabbi <em>Y'huda</em> is referring to the earth that would be expected to turn into the rest of the <em>sheretz</em>. In the case of the egg, the puncture gives access to the embryo and thus to the impurity.)</p>\n<p>The <em>mishna</em> does not say that these animals (the fetus and the earth-generated <em>sheretz</em>) are dead. Normally, though, a <em>sheretz</em> imparts impurity only if dead. So my question is: Is the <em>mishna</em> referring to a dead animal only, and fails to say so because it's obvious, or is it referring even to a live animal, and a live animal imparts impurity in this case because, not being fully formed, it's not yet considered alive and thus considered dead?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to Tiferes Yisroel there working off the relevant sugya, this sheretz is unlike other sheratzim. There is a gizeiras hakasuv declaring it tamei, it is not working with the regular rules of death causing impurity. In other words, in order to clarify, the premise of the question is incorrect.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>טמא:\nואילה\"ק מ\"ש מאזוב מדברי שאינו בכלל סתם אזוב שכתבה תורה.

Any non-Jew, if sincere, may convert.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Following on from my comment - I came across the following online from <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/rabbi-hayyim-angel/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Hayyim Angel</a> who has an interesting piece <a href=\"https://www.jewishideas.org/article/conversion-halakhah-and-public-policy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. He explores two historical issues that were a point of dispute about those wishing to convert. Namely, a non-Jewish partner seeking to get married but not necessarily with religious motivation and then following on from this the concept of conversion outside of eretz yisroel. I won't focus on the latter as I risk making the answer too long.</p>\n<p>Some extracts are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Beginning in the nineteenth century, cataclysmic changes affected Jewish communal life. Secularization, the separation of Church and State, emancipation, and the institution of civil marriage undermined the authority of Jewish communal leadership and led to a shift from a generally traditional society to one where the majority of Jews no longer observed all of halakhah and many chose social assimilation and (increasingly) intermarriage. The latter phenomenon gave rise to the following question: <strong>If a Jew has chosen to marry (or to live with) a non-Jewish partner, and that partner applies to convert, what is the proper rabbinic response?</strong> While there is a wide range of opinions among rabbis responding to this question, they can be divided broadly into a more lenient position and a more restrictive position. This chapter will explore the central arguments of each side.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary, the arguments centre on what the motivation to convert is predicated on. If it is not sincerely for the sake of converting but only to allow for marriage the fallout might cause the perception that intermarriage is allowed. Morevoer,someone seeking a non-Jewish spouse suggests a less observant way of life, in which case can we allow for a convert that will likewise be less committed to the faith. Finally, can we say that a convert of this type will accept the commandments.</p>\n<p>As such, he notes those who hold not to accept such candidates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Several German rabbis, including <strong>Yaakov Ettlinger, Samson Raphael Hirsch, and Azriel Hildesheimer, opposed performing conversions in cases of intermarriage</strong>. They maintained that in the era when Rambam permitted such a conversion (see previous chapter), the Jewish community was generally observant. Back then, conversion to Judaism necessarily meant entry into an observant Jewish community. However, one no longer could presume that a convert would join an observant community, since the majority of born Jews no longer fully observe halakhah. These rabbis maintained that it is contrary to Torah to accept a convert who will be non-observant. <strong>Therefore, Rambam’s ruling is not relevant as a precedent in the modern era</strong>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is worth noting parenthetically, that this view was shared in the nineteenth century when general observance was under threat. One could ask if today in the twenty-first century, we have less of a threat, in which case we can revert to the Rambam's view, or, due to the rising rate of assimilation it is just as relevant. It would obviously require a contemporary rabbinic view to make this all clear.</p>\n<p>He explores what if their partnership was not truly 'for the sake of heaven'. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>One of the central debates between the two positions revolved around the requirement of conversion “for the sake of Heaven” (Gerim 1:3). The permissive side maintained that any choice made by the prospective convert not for personal gain should be considered “for the sake of Heaven.” A civilly married couple, then, could be considered sincere since they did not need to come to a Bet Din in order to be married. Rabbi Yehiel Yaakov Weinberg agreed with Rabbi David Zvi Hoffmann, that if a couple already lives together, a Bet Din may view their voluntarily coming to the Bet Din to mean that the conversion was not for ulterior motives. Others, including Rabbi Shlomo Kluger and Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, maintained this view, as well.</em></p>\n<p><em>Additionally, many who permitted such conversions did so in order to avoid the greater problem of intermarriage. A lenient interpretation of the rules of conversion was the preferable choice. Finally, the permissive side insisted that a Bet Din has a responsibility to work proactively to help people avoid living in sinful relationships.</em></p>\n<p><em>The restrictive side disagreed. True, such a conversion may not be for the sake of marriage, but it also is not a sincere conversion for the sake of heaven. The Jewish partner, for example, may want his or her non-Jewish spouse to convert for social and communal acceptance. The restrictive side also maintained that it is not the responsibility of a Bet Din to proactively bend the rules of conversion to help sinners. Additionally, they argued, of what benefit would it be to convert a non-Jewish spouse if the couple likely will remain non-observant? Similarly, of what benefit would it be to the child of an intermarriage, who was unlikely to grow up observant? Such individuals are better off as non-Jews, since they will not be culpable for violating the Torah. Better remain a Gentile than become a non-observant Jew!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There is a part in vayikra 15 which speak about niddah, but there it says a woman should bring a korban when she is finished being in niddah. What I'm looking for is where the mitzvah of going to the mikvah comes from. Looking at verse 19 and on, I can find a lot of verses teaching that anything or anyone one who comes in contact with a woman being in niddah becomes ‘unclean’, but none of those talk about the woman herself having to bathe in living waters, only about the counting of days after which she is considered to be clean (verse 28).</p>\n<p>The only verse I could think of was 15:13 if we take it as a general rule it could be read as: <em>When one (male or female) with a discharge becomes clean of the discharge, one shall count off seven days for ones cleansing, wash ones clothes, and bathe ones body in fresh water; then one shall be clean.</em></p>\n<p>Any other thoughts or sources derived from the verses mentioned in Leviticus 15 which could show us a reason for taking a mikvah?</p>\n<p>[P.s. would it be allowed to take a normal bath if there isn’t such a command to be found?]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.yoatzot.org/questions-and-answers/6193/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">yoatzot.org</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The requirement for a niddah to immerse is a Torah level, D'oraita, law. However, it is not explicitly stated in any verse in Torah. This is an instance where the Rabbinic tradition is essential for a proper understanding of the Torah text.</p>\n<p>There are a few different Torah sources given for the requirement that a woman in niddah immerse. These include VaYikra 15:18, which is understood by the Rambam as a 'binyan av', or archetype, for anyone who is tamei (ritually impure) needing to immerse. An alternative scriptural basis is VaYikra 15:21, which requires one who touches a niddah's bedding to immerse. Kal vachomer (a fortiori), a niddah herself must immerse. Another source is Bamidbar 31:23, in which a mikveh is referred to as \"the waters of niddah.\" (For further reference, see Bet Yosef, Yoreh Deah 197:1.)</p>\n<p>On another note, a zavah brings a sacrifice when she exits that status (VaYikra 15:25-30), but a niddah does not (VaYikra 15:19-24).

Az Nidbaru 13:32:3 agrees. He says for those who do it can bow either to the right first or left first but what is important is to pay attention to the words. Shivat Tzion Shabbat 7:106 v. 2 p. 117 writes based on the zohar that the angels when praising Hashem turn to the right first and then to their left and in kedusha we're mimicking the angels. He explains that it isn't similar to Yoma 53b where we're leaving Hashem's presence.<a href=\"https://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Turning_to_the_Right_and_Left\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1</a> Rivevot Efraim 5:103:2 writes that one should turn to the right first and the left.

One will note that the opening line of the Kedusha is a declaration of our desire to praise God just like the angels do. We are told that when the angels praise God with the thrice \"Kadosh\", they first call out to each other in order to organize themselves to praise Him in unison. We can suggest therefore that our bowing to the right and left is intended to humble ourselves and request permission from these angels, often depicted as standing on either side of God, to praise Him as they do. [<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.6.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshayahu 6:3</a>]</p>\n<p>Another cited source for the \"V'kara Zeh El Zeh V'amar\" movements is a reference to the piyut \"Amitzei Shechakim\" that is recited on Yom Kippur which makes mention of angels turning to \"every side\" to recite the \"Kadosh\". Again, it would appear that the desire to imitate the angels at this time is seen as a commendable act which likely fueled the \"V'kara Zeh El Zeh V'amar\" customs. There is also a basis for the practice based on the Zohar [Parshat Noach, cited in Minhag Yisrael Torah O.C. 125:2] which relates the bowing to the right and left to the rainbow.

And similarly, in all analogous instances, a person who fails to act transgresses the commandment: \"Do not stand idly by while your brother's blood is at stake.\"</p>\n<p>יד</p>\n<p>כָּל הַיָּכוֹל לְהַצִּיל וְלֹא הִצִּיל עוֹבֵר עַל (ויקרא יט טז) \"לֹא תַעֲמֹד עַל דַּם רֵעֶךָ\". וְכֵן הָרוֹאֶה אֶת חֲבֵרוֹ טוֹבֵעַ בַּיָּם. אוֹ לִסְטִים בָּאִים עָלָיו. אוֹ חַיָּה רָעָה בָּאָה עָלָיו. וְיָכוֹל לְהַצִּילוֹ הוּא בְּעַצְמוֹ. אוֹ שֶׁיִּשְׂכֹּר אֲחֵרִים לְהַצִּילוֹ וְלֹא הִצִּיל. אוֹ שֶׁשָּׁמַע עוֹבְדֵי כּוֹכָבִים אוֹ מוֹסְרִים מְחַשְּׁבִים עָלָיו רָעָה אוֹ טוֹמְנִין לוֹ פַּח וְלֹא גִּלָּה אֹזֶן חֲבֵרוֹ וְהוֹדִיעוֹ. אוֹ שֶׁיָּדַע בְּעַכּוּ''ם אוֹ בְּאוֹנֵס שֶׁהוּא בָּא עַל חֲבֵרוֹ וְיָכוֹל לְפַיְּסוֹ בִּגְלַל חֲבֵרוֹ לְהָסִיר מַה שֶּׁבְּלִבּוֹ וְלֹא פִּיְּסוֹ. וְכָל כַּיּוֹצֵא בִּדְבָרִים אֵלּוּ. הָעוֹשֶׂה אוֹתָם עוֹבֵר עַל לֹא תַעֲמֹד עַל דַּם רֵעֶךָ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When a person sees a rodef pursuing a colleague to kill him, or a woman forbidden as an ervah to rape her, and he has the potential to save the victim and yet fails to do so, he has negated the observance of the positive commandment: \"You must cut off her hand,\" and has transgressed two negative commandments: \"You may not show pity,\" and \"Do not stand idly by while your brother's blood is at stake.\"</p>\n<p>That one has to go to any measures to save the life of another Jew. In some places this means even stealing the property of the other Jew, based on this rambam that anything except the big 3 can be done to save a life if a jew</p>\n<p>Question is if this applies to the spiritual life if the Jew as well, meaning of a jew has idols can we steal then and break thek to prevent the Jew from chas veshalom owning idols?</p>\n<p>If any mitzvah, including stealing, but minus the big 3, are overruled to save a Jewish life, then would idolatry, which is not overruled even to save a life, as it is one of the big 3, certainly be overruled by the lesser mitzvos, including stealing? Is this not a Kal vachomer?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rashi on Genesis 31:19:2\n(2) ותגגב רחל את התרפים AND ROCHEL STOLE THE TERAPHIM — her intention was to wean her father from idol-worship (Genesis Rabbah 74:5).</p>\n<p>Bkitzur:</p>\n<p>If Rochel (pashtus a Jew) took away idols from her Dad so he (Goy) shouldn't worship them - then kal vchomer one should steal idols from (a Jew) so he shouldn't worship them either.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is it wrong to expect rewards for observance?",
    "content": "# Is it wrong to expect rewards for observance?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many commentators have told us to perform the commandments for their own sake, out of love, not for the purpose of receiving rewards.  The Rambam summarized this exhortation as follows :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When I do these commandments ... what is the reward that I will receive for it?\" ... The Sages have warned about this: ... A person should not make [reward] the objective of his service to God... And this is what ... Antigonos, the man of Sokho, said: \"Do not be as servants who are serving the master in order to receive a reward, rather be as servants who are serving the master not in order to receive a reward.\" [Avot 1:3] And indeed ... one should believe in the truth for the sake of the truth; and this is the matter they call, 'one who serves from love.' And they said, \"\"Who greatly desires His commandments\" [Psalms 112:1] Rabbi Eliezer said, 'His commandments; and not the reward of His commandments.\"\" [Avodah Zarah 19a] ...  And even greater than this is what they said in the Sifrei:\n\"[Do not] say, 'Behold, I am learning Torah so that I will be rich; so that I will be called rabbi; so that I will receive reward in the world to come'; for this reason it is written, 'To love the Lord your God'.  All that you do, do it only out of love.\" [Sifrei Devarim 41:23] ...\nAnd this is the level of Avraham ... [Sotah 31a] - He served from love. [Rambam on Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:1; see also Nedarim 62a; Avodah Zarah 19a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But God plainly stated again and again in the Torah that the Covenant is a quid pro quo: If we Jews do our part, God will do his.  This is the very meaning of the word \"covenant\".  It is most clearly stated in Parshat Ki Tavo:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you ... fulfill the commandments ... God will place you supreme above all the nations of the earth... Blessed will be the fruit of your womb, your soil, your livestock, your basket and your kneading bowl. God will cause your enemies ... to be beaten... He will establish you as His holy people ... He will open up for you His good treasury, the heaven, to give your land its rain in its season, and to bless everything that you do... You will lend ... but you will not [need to] borrow. [Deut. 28:1-13]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I understand that it's better, nobler, holier, more wholesome, etc., not to expect rewards for the things we do, not to look forward to them, not to work specifically for them.  But is there really a need to make those who do things for rewards feel bad, small, mercenary, guilty, ashamed, less-worthy, etc.?</p>\n<p>Isn't the \"Covenant\" (contract, deal, two-sided agreement) the very basis of Judaism?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is a <em>mishnah</em> (Pirqei Avos 1:3) on the topic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַנְטִיגְנוֹס אִישׁ סוֹכוֹ קִבֵּל מִשִּׁמְעוֹן הַצַּדִּיק. הוּא הָיָה אוֹמֵר, אַל תִּהְיוּ כַעֲבָדִים הַמְשַׁמְּשִׁין אֶת הָרַב עַל מְנָת לְקַבֵּל פְּרָס, אֶלָּא הֱווּ כַעֲבָדִים הַמְשַׁמְּשִׁין אֶת הָרַב שֶׁלֹּא עַל מְנָת לְקַבֵּל פְּרָס, וִיהִי מוֹרָא שָׁמַיִם עֲלֵיכֶם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Antigonus a man of Socho received [the oral tradition] from Shimon the Righteous. He used to say: do not be like servants who serve the master in the expectation of receiving a reward, but be like servants who serve the master without the expectation of receiving a reward, and let the fear of Heaven be upon you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the gemara goes even farther. Bava Basra 10b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא: אמר להן רבן יוחנן בן זכאי לתלמידיו, \"בני, מהו שאמר הכתוב ...?\" נענה רבי אליעזר, \"'וחסד לאומים חטאת' (משלי יד:לד) -- כל צדקה וחסד שאומות עובדי כוכבים עושין חטא הוא להן. שאינם עושין אלא להתגדל בו. כמו שנאמר (עזרא ו:י) 'די להוון מהקרבין ניחוחין לאלהה שמיא ומצליין לחיי מלכא ובנוהי.'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is taught in a <em>beraisa</em>: Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to his students, \"My sons, what is the meaning of that which the verse (Proverb 14:34)...?\" Rabbi Eliezer answered, “'But the kindness of the peoples is sin,' meaning that all the acts of charity and kindness that the idolatrous nations perform is counted as a sin for them, since they perform them only to elevate themselves. As it says, 'That they may sacrifice offerings of pleasing aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons.'” (Ezra 6:10)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer says that this is a defining feature of idolatry. A pagan offers sacrifices to appease the gods and get what they want out of them. This is why an idolater's kindness is a sin -- because it's not genuine; it's about making sure Olympus / Asgard / whereever give them more.</p>\n<p>About the flipside, punishment, the Ramchal (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Messilat_Yesharim.24.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mesillas Yesharim ch. 24</a>) makes a distinction between <em>yir'as ha'onesh</em> -- fear of punishment, and <em>yir'as hacheit</em> -- fear of the sin itself. Fear of punishment, he says, is for <em>amei ha'aretz</em>, the more ignorant person, who needs a prod to do the right thing. But the true <em>yir'ah</em> is awe of the Grandeur of G-d, an aspect of which is fear of the sin itself. Being afraid one might do the wrong thing simply because it's the wrong thing.</p>\n<p>Like in a good marriage. A husband isn't afraid of doing something that would upset his wife because she will take revenge or not do him a favor. Rather, in a healthy relationship, he doesn't want to do something that would upset her because it would upset her. Not fear of her punishing him, but fear of the offense itself.</p>\n<p>And similarly reward. We shouldn't be doing <em>mitzvos</em> because Hashem will reward us. Instead simply because it is what Hashem wants of us.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There is also a causal connection between <em>mitzvah</em> and positive outcomes. After all, the One Who designed the universe would know what actions would cause it to run smoothly. Following a doctor's orders similarly come with the \"reward\" of good health.</p>\n<p>I believe that's what the Torah is speaking of when it talks about reward and punishment. Not so much a motivator -- although the Ramchal says that some people do require such sticks and carrots. But when viewed this way, the positive outcome is a cause of the mitzvah, a reason why G-d would command such a thing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rambam in Hilchot Teshuvah 9:1 explains that the ‘rewards’ listed in the convenant are not at all ends in and of themselves.</p>\n<p>Rather, if we behave correctly, G-d grants us  a tranquil, comfortable existence in This World, making it easier for us to gain life in the Next World, by allowing us time and opportunity to focus on living a life of service to Him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Of course one should not demean those whose observance is motivated by ulterior motives, especially because most people are a mix of better and not so good intentions on any given day. Saying that one behavior or attitude is greater than another is not meant to put down those who have yet to reach the greater level.</p>\n<p>This is discussed at length in the perakim of Nefesh HaChayim. (In between shaar 3 and 4) Rav Moshe Feinstein z\"l writes many times in Darash Moshe that even one who is motivated by ulterior motives still has a major element of lishmah, and the ulterior motives are just necessary to help him combat his yetzer hara.</p>\n\n\n",

lot</p>\n<p>so tal is detailed in here on Isaiah prophet:\nכִּ֣י טַ֤ל אוֹרֹת֙ טַלֶּ֔ךָ וָאָ֖רֶץ רְפָאִ֥ים תַּפִּֽיל\nso tal means light , that bring up the dead to live,\nit isn't exactly about the physical lives we live,\nbut you can live physically but still be considered as dead,\nbecause you are attaching/connecting  with the side of impurity\nthey are called death ,\nas it says on משלי:\nרַ֭גְלֶיהָ יֹרְד֣וֹת מָ֑וֶת ,\nthe legs of shechina from world atzilut , drop down to where death is,\n(the worlds of separation , are called death , in opposite to atzilut which is devine: and on atzilut and above where there is devinity it says: לֹ֖א יְגֻרְךָ֣ רָֽע\nbut below the devine there is death, because there is a reality of evil in there the more you go down, and the deepest lowest part of it is this physical world)</p>\n<p>so all that related to evil and impurity and ego and separation and darkness, are called death,\nand the opposite of it is called life , the side of holiness , purity and altruism and unity and free love and happiness,</p>\n<p>so when one person lives , he can connect to life or connect to death,\nso the lights of tal , can awaken a living person that is connected to the side of death,\nto reconnect him with the side of life while living</p>\n<p>also these divine lights are related to awakening the resurrection</p>\n<p>so we continue to look into the above sentence meaning:</p>\n<p>and land of Rephaim will fall,</p>\n<p>land means the\nmeasurement of malchut(kingship) / מידת המלכות</p>\n<p>המידה הזאת היא אחת מ10 מאמרות בראשית\nand king david , and shechina are related to this measurement of kingship</p>\n<p>but above land is not about the holy shechina / divine residence, but the opposite of her, related to impurity\nbecause there was:</p>\n<p>נפילים , ענקים, רפאים\nthe nephilim were 2 angels,\nthat went down to this physical world,\nand had babies with women,\nthey made, og king of bashan , and shichon ,\nboth of them were

they were\nנרפו מהקדושה העליונה,\nלשון ריפיון\nוכל דור מאלה , ירד עוד ועוד מהקדושה שלו</p>\n<p>so land is synonim to: measurement of kingship ,(whether if related to side of purity or side of evil , it's a general term), land doesn't mean a physical place in this sentence</p>\n<p>so land of repahim ,\nmeans the land of evil influence , the makes people saggy/slack from working hard toward connecting to life and holiness/purity</p>\n<p>so why this land attachment/influence will fall , when there is resurrection?\nbecause on Isaiah prophet, it says:\nבִּלַּ֤ע הַמָּ֙וֶת֙ לָנֶ֔צַח\non the day of (salvation of evil/revelation of divinity)</p>\n<p>so after this introduction we can continue , to detail what is the meaning of tal lights:\non eliyahu opening to the secrets, he tells that tal is gimetria of the first part of the holy explicit name,\nin this way\nyou take the first 3 letters of the name,\nand convert it from simple letter , to filled letter,\nyou can fill it on couple of ways depending on the nikud you want,\nbut on the holy name that is called tal,\nthe letters filled with the letter aleph א ,</p>\n<p>so י becomes יו\"ד\nwhen it filled\nbecause there is no place for א in there,\nbut the second letter,\nה becomes ה\"א , not ה\"ה  , and not ה\"י....\nso it's filled with א where possible</p>\n<p>so you have the first 3 letters filled:\nequals in gimatria  to tal

It is not an affront to the Rebbi per say, it is something that strikes at the heart of what the Jewish people are all about.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>We are a nation of tradition. “Ask your father and he will tell you; your elders and they will say to you” [Devorim 32:7]. Without that tradition of consulting the elders, the Talmidei Chachomim, the older generation, we will not exist. Therefore when a student teaches the law in front of his teacher, he is stripping the Jewish people of something that is essential to their whole being. For this reason, there is no forgiving on the teacher’s part of this terrible sin.</em></p>\n<p><em>And for this reason the joy at the erection of the Tabernacle had to be dampened with the death of Aharon’s two sons — because this lesson had to be learnt. We are not a nation without our elders.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why aren't the two days of Rosh Hashannah structured as every other Rosh Hodesh?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I don't recall the exact location Rambam's Mishneh Torah, but he discusses that during the time of Sanhedrin, if witnesses came before sundown of the 30th day, then that day was considered Rosh Hodesh, and the previous month was 29 days long. Otherwise, the 30th day was observed as Rosh Hodesh and the next day was considered the 1st day of the new month. Thus, there were 2 days Rosh Hodesh.</p>\n<p>In the current fixed calendar, this is emulated. A month having 29 days has 1 day Rosh Hodesh which is the 1st of the next month. Months having 30 days have Rosh Hodesh on the 30th as well as the 1st day of the next month.</p>\n<p>Rosh Hashannah is also Rosh Hodesh. If I understand the Sanhedrin rules correctly, the same situations occurred on Rosh Hashanna as with every Rosh Hodesh - i.e. the 30th of Elul was the 1st day of Rosh Hashanna, and Tishrei 1 was the 2nd day of Rosh Hashannah.</p>\n<p>On the current fixed calendar, Elul has 29 days, and the 2 days of Rosh Hashannah are 1 and 2 Tishrei. Why are we not emulating how it works for all other months, and make Elul 30 days iwth Rosh Hashannah being on 30 Elul and 1 Tishrei?</p>\n\n\n",

Moses went and sat at the end of the eighth row in Rabbi Akiva’s study hall and did not understand what they were saying. Moses’ strength waned.

This is based on Rabbenu Nissim's (14th century Spain) understanding of Nedarim 40a and Ketuvot 104a, ratified by the Aruch Hashulhan [YD 335:3] and Rabbi Feinstein [Igrot Moshe CM 2:74].</p>\n<p>But I have not seen a responsum about whether someone is allowed to pray for <em>his own</em> death.  Tanhuma implies that it's allowed, because that's what Moses did:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moses said: Master of the universe, up to now I requested life, but now here is my soul given over to You.

David said before the Holy One, blessed be He, 'Sovereign of the Universe! Lord, make me to know mine end.' 'It is a decree before Me,' replied He, 'that the end of a mortal  is not made known.' 'And the measure of my days, what it is'-'it is a decree before Me that a person's span [of life] is not made known.' 'Let me know how frail [hadel] I am.'  <strong>Said He to him. 'Thou wilt die on the Sabbath.'</strong> 'Let me die on the first day of the week!'  'The reign of thy son Solomon shall already have become due, and one reign may not overlap another even by a hairbreadth.' <strong>'Then let me die on the eve of the Sabbath!'</strong> Said He, 'For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand':  better is to Me the one day that thou sittest and engagest in learning than the thousand burnt-offerings which thy son Solomon is destined to sacrifice before Me on the altar.'</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_30.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ever so fitting, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/2548/jewish/The-Book-of-Jonah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jonah (Iyov)</a> prayed for his death two times in the course of his ordeals.</p>\n<p>Chapter 4:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And he prayed to G‑d, and said: \"I pray thee, O G‑d, was not this my\nsaying, when I was still in my own country? Therefore I fled\nbeforehand to Tarshish; for I knew that You are a gracious G‑d, and\nmerciful, slow to anger, and great in love and repentest of the evil.\nTherefore now, O G‑d, take my life from me, I pray thee; for it is\nbetter for me to die than to live.\" And G‑d said: \"Are you so greatly\nvexed?\" Then G‑d appointed a worm when the dawn came up the next day,\nand it attacked the plant, so that it withered. And it came to pass,\nwhen the sun arose, that G‑d prepared a vehement east wind, and the\nsun beat down upon the head of Jonah, so that he fainted; so he asked\nthat he might die, and he said: It is better for me to die than to\nlive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And G‑d said to Jonah: \"Are you so greatly vexed on account of the\nplant?\" And he said: \"I am greatly vexed to death\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I conclude that you are you are clearly allowed to pray for your own death.

The Hebrew is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מליצות ומשלים של שיחת חולין ודברי חשק כגון ספר עמנואל וכן ספרי מלחמות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which they translate as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One may not read on Shabbos, secular books of phrases and parables, books of passion (such as Sefer Emmanuel) and war books.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But a better conceptual translation based upon the context might be:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Metaphorical</strong></em> (both משל and מליצה), <em><strong>humorous</strong></em> (as in ליצן), <em><strong>profane language</strong></em> (like joke books, דברי חול) <em><strong>about joining together and inserting</strong></em> (לחם) <em><strong>and touching or handling</strong></em> (משל) <em><strong>and love novels</strong></em> (דברי חשק), like Sefer Emmanuel and also books of pornography... (again from the verb root לחם which can also mean <em>joining together</em> or <em>inserting</em>)</p>\n<p>So too, from Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, the addition of chronicles of the Monarchies of the nations of the world supports this idea. These chronicles recount in great detail the extreme excess and indulgences of their rulers. Think, for example, of Emperor Caligula. Their lifestyles with harems and debauchery are a mockery and perversion of the concept of G-d's Kingship, which is especially emphasized on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>And a named example of such mockery from Shulchan Aruch is Sefer Emmanuel which is likely one of the books written by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_the_Roman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Immanuel of Rome</a>. The style of his books as recounted under the Wikipedia sub-heading for his works illustrates his highly educated, mockery of Torah teachings.</p>\n<p>But in contrast, when these subjects are found in the Sifrei Kodesh (<em>perhaps only in Hebrew</em> as noted by the Rema), like for example Shir HaShirim from Shlomo HaMelech, they are a true sanctification of G-d's name and His Kingship.</p>\n<p>And so the presumption of the question, that it is dealing with history, is incorrect. That the subject is about indulgence of the Yetzer HaRah by way of coarse, material, bodily excesses.</p>\n<p>And in fact countless examples of history books can be found from our Sages, like for example Seder HaDorot, Igeret of Sherira Gaon, Shem HaGadolim or Sefer Yosiphon, to name only a few. And many of them, like Sefer Yosiphon, recount wars that occurred in great detail. Majoring in history at university is not prohibited.</p>\n\n\n",

Does this prove the Torah is manmade or is there a deeper layer?Rabbi Ishmael said the Torah was written in the language of men etc.\nExample:\nAfter the men are defeated at Hormah, do they turn back into the wilderness OR do they return to Kadesh? (Deut 1:40, 2:1 ; Num 14:25  vs Deut 1:46 ; Num 20:14).</p>\n<p>There is a clear contradiction here. There are many such contradictions in the Torah.</p>\n<p>Why is this so? Have Jewish commentaters dealt with these narrative contradictions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First off, yes, apparent contradictions are dealt extensively by Jewish commentators, but the question is too broad to be answered in a single post.</p>\n<p>Secondly, in many cases, things which may seem to one reader to be a clear contradiction is not a contradiction at all to another reader. To address the one contradiction that you mentioned, here is an answer.</p>\n<p>Secular Biblical scholars have noticed many contradictions and their answer is that different passages were written by different human authors. Thus, you have J (who uses YKVK as God's name), E (who uses Elokim as God's name), P (the Priestly Author), R (a redactor), and D (the Deuteronomist). So the easy thing for them to have answered is that this single passage was authored by different authors.</p>\n<p>You can look at this website, <a href=\"https://tanach.us/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanach.us</a>, to see color coding of purported authorship of Biblical passages according to the Documentary Hypothesis. And you will see that they say that Deut 1:40 and 1:46 are both written by Dtr1, not Dtr2, Dtn, E, or Other. Similarly, they have Numbers 14:25 and Numbers 20:14, which are farther apart, both written by J.</p>\n<p>So it would seem that the secular Biblical scholars do not consider this clear contradiction to be a real contradiction.</p>\n<p>Two possible answers, just off the cuff. First, in both Deuteronomy and Numbers, the command from God, to turn to the wilderness by way of the Reed Sea, rather than fight, comes before the battle. In both cases, the description of where they went, to Kadesh, comes after the unsuccessful battle. Maybe where they were to go changed after their defeat?</p>\n<p>Second, how do you know that Kadesh is not \"in the wilderness\"? I had always assumed that it is indeed part of the wilderness. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0433.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 33</a> lays out the stages of their encampments of the wilderness, and one of those stages is Kadesh:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>36 And they journeyed from Ezion-geber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin--the same is Kadesh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So <strong>Kadesh is a wilderness</strong> - namely, the wilderness of Tzin. So it would only be a \"clear contradiction\" if you know the specifics of wildernesses and the Biblical geography to such an extent that it is somehow certain that the wilderness by way of the Reed Sea (Suph) is a different wilderness than the wilderness of Tzin (that is, Kadesh). Can you show this? Since scholars say that Kadesh is part of the Aravah, and since Deuteronomy 1:1 says \"in the wilderness, in the Arabah, over against Suph,\" aren't these quite possibly the same place?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Sometimes the same event is described <em>from multiple angles</em>, to give us a better picture; hence the Creation is described first from a big-picture perspective (humans come in male and female, like all the other animals), and then in a more human one (a lonely man).</p>\n<p>If a commandment appears different in different places, the Talmud will harmonize those and explain how each apply.

Deuteronomy clearly links back to previous books, so it's very hard to argue that it was two different texts woven together.

The vast majority of Deuteronomy is Moses talking) may have color commentary that differs from the original.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Berman points out that covenants at the time usually started off with a re-telling of relevant history, often \"creatively re-described\" in terms that would best support the agreement at-hand.

The Torah is very vague about what exactly goes on on this day, and only says \"it should be a day of Teruah,\" not even defining what a teruah is. It also says \"a remembrance of Teruah\" which doesn't seem to help us more.\nThe Ramban says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא פירש הכתוב טעם המצווה הזאת  למה התרועה, ולמה נצטרך זיכרון לפני השם\nביום הזה יותר משאר הימים, ולמה יצווה להיותו מקרא קדש כלל. אבל מפני\nשהוא בחדשו של יום הכיפורים בראש החודש נראה שבו יהיה דין לפניו יתברך כי\nבם ידין עמים, בראש השנה ישב לכסא שופט צדק, ואחרי כן בעשרת הימים ישא\nלפשע עבדיו. נרמז בכתוב העניין כאשר נודע בישראל מפי הנביאים ואבות\nקדושים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A summary in English: The Torah never tells us what the point of the day is, why we have a Teruah, or why we need a zikaron, and furthermore, the Torah never even gives any reason at all for the holiday.

Hilkhos Teshuvah opens (ch. 1-2) with a discussion of abandoning one's bad actions. <em>Teshuvah</em> for what we did, breaking bad habits, and taking steps to do better in the future.</p>\n<p>Then there is the <em>teshuvah</em> the Rambam introduces in 7:3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַל תֹּאמַר שֶׁאֵין תְּשׁוּבָה אֶלָּא מַעֲבִירוֹת שֶׁיֵּשׁ בָּהֶן מַעֲשֶׂה כְּגוֹן זְנוּת וְגֵזֶל וּגְנֵבָה. אֶלָּא כְּשֵׁם שֶׁצָּרִיךְ אָדָם לָשׁוּב מֵאֵלּוּ כָּךְ הוּא צָרִיךְ לְחַפֵּשׂ בְּדֵעוֹת רָעוֹת שֶׁיֵּשׁ לוֹ וְלָשׁוּב מִן הַכַּעַס וּמִן הָאֵיבָה וּמִן הַקִּנְאָה וּמִן הַהִתּוּל וּמֵרְדִיפַת הַמָּמוֹן וְהַכָּבוֹד וּמֵרְדִיפַת הַמַּאֲכָלוֹת וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶן מִן הַכּל צָרִיךְ לַחֲזֹר בִּתְשׁוּבָה. וְאֵלּוּ הָעֲוֹנוֹת קָשִׁים מֵאוֹתָן שֶׁיֵּשׁ בָּהֶן מַעֲשֶׂה שֶׁבִּזְמַן שֶׁאָדָם נִשְׁקָע בְּאֵלּוּ קָשֶׁה הוּא לִפְרשׁ מֵהֶם. וְכֵן הוּא אוֹמֵר (ישעיה נה ז) \"יַעֲזֹב רָשָׁע\" וְגוֹ':</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A person should not think that repentance is only necessary for those sins that involve deed such as promiscuity, robbery, or theft. Rather, just as a person is obligated to repent from these, similarly, he must search after the evil character traits he has. He must repent from anger, hatred, envy, frivolity, the pursuit of money and honor, the pursuit of gluttony, and the like. He must repent for all [of the above].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These sins are more difficult than those that involve deed. If a person is attached to these, it is more difficult for him to separate himself. In this context, [Isaiah 55:7] exhorts: \"May the wicked abandon his path and the crooked man, his designs.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Salmononius2 wrote in his answer and robev commented, the Rama (OC 343:1) says one is not obligated to do <em>teshuvah</em> for violating <em>kibud av va'eim</em> (parental respect) as a child. And the Qitzur (165:6) gives the logical generalization of applying this to other sins.</p>\n<p>However, the Rama doesn't stop there. This is what he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וקטן שהכה לאביו או עבר שאר עבירות בקטנותו אע\"פ שא\"צ תשובה כשהגדיל מ\"מ טוב לו שיקבל על עצמו איזה דבר לתשובה ולכפרה אע\"פ שעבר קודם שנעשה בר עונשין (פסקי מהרא\"י סי' ס\"ב):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a child struck his father or transgressed otherwise in his youth, even though he does not need to repent when he matures, it is still good for him to take upon himself some element of <em>teshuvah</em> and atonement, even though his sin was at age when he was not eligible for punishment (Pisqei Mahara\"i #62).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would suggest this is because of the existence of two types of <em>teshuvah</em>. Deeds done as children aren't true sins, and don't require <em>teshuvah</em>. But those deeds did reinforce negative elements of one's character. If one feels those flaws are still around, it would be appropriate to do <em>teshuvah</em> in the sense of repairing one's <em>middos</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>And now let me add a personal note. I changed schools for 5th grade. In the first school I attended, the bullying started in 2nd grade, but by the end of fourth grade... Two kids tripped me on the staircase, and I fell down a flight of concrete steps. So, it was time to go. That was back in 1975.</p>\n<p>On Erev Yom Kippur, in 2008, I got a call from someone I hadn't heard from since then.

However, it seems to say that if life is not in danger, rather property only is in danger, then it is still prohibited to put out fire.</p>\n<p>So there are a couple ways to approach this</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How can one determine whether a life is in danger, when a fire may start small and could lead to deadly destruction of an entire city. If one lives in a dense city, we can assume that putting out a fire would be permitted because even if the inhabitants of the house safely leave, the burning house could threaten the life of others living nearby. But if someone lives in a rural area where lets say they're house is not close to any other houses, this wouldn't apply.</li>\n<li>if one leaves his house wouldn't he be carrying (clothes) outside of a private area? Isn't this the same as putting out fire to save the house and life of those staying in it?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we are threatened with a loss -- for instance, a cask of wine has sprung a leak -- we may call in a non-Jew..., provided we carefully avoid talking to him in a way that sounds like a request to repair it; but we say in his presence: 'Whoever will save me from this loss will not lose anything'. [Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 90:16]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, you may not make this statement directly to him. [Mishnah Berurah 307:70]</p>\n<p>This should not be done unless there is potential for substantial loss.

The risks here are far too high otherwise.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If we have a doubt about the circumstances of a halachic situation, the term used is \"Safek\", meaning \"Doubt\".  If we have a doubt concerning danger to human life, we call that \"Safek Pikuach Nefesh\", which literally means \"Doubt (regarding the) care of a soul\".  In Halacha, whenever there is a Safek Pikuach Nefesh, the ruling is to be lenient, and to allow most anything imaginable to save a life, even if the fact of the danger to it is in doubt, except for the three \"cardinal sins\" of adultery, murder, and apostasy.  Practically, if you foresee a situation, such as taking medicine on Shabbes, having a need to drive on Shabbes, etc, the best approach is to ask your Rav.</p>\n\n\n",

Everyone can come out different. The manuscript versions didn't even have daf numbers and there was definitely no universal dafim. That is why the rishonim never mention dafim.

The Halachic significance of a Targum is that it may, according to some opinions, if it is in the language that you speak, qualify for your weekly reading of \"Twice in the Scripture (typically the Hebrew original) and once in Targum\"  However, some take the word Targum to also mean commentary - not sure why.

Some people know when this happens, others don't.</p>\n<p>Therefore it would appear that it may be possible to rephrase your question as: Is there a formula for determining when Eliyahu appears to me?</p>\n<p>I heard my favourite story on this topic from Rb Fishel Shachter, I am sure it is a common story, said in various different versions.</p>\n<p>The story is about someone who prepared themselves for a month through ta'aneisim and siguphim for giluy Eliyahu. He then sat down to learn, waiting for Eliyahu. At the moment, the local drunk importunely knocked on this door, as he was out of liquor. After shooing him away, the tzadik sat down and waited for Eliyahu, who failed to appear.</p>\n<p>He complained to his rebbe that Eliyahu had not appeared, the response was predictable, the drunk was Eliyahu Ha'navi.</p>\n<p>The lesson of this mashal appears to be as follows:</p>\n<p>If we accept EVERYONE, without exception and without looking askance at them, then we stand a chance of knowing when we see Eliyahu Ha'navi. However, if we only look towards and accept the \"important people,\" then Eliyahu says to us, \"I'm not important either you know. So you'd better pass me by...\"</p>\n<p>(The closest source in Chazal I can think of for this approach is</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.steinsaltz-center.org.il/document/68686,0,3180.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.steinsaltz-center.org.il/document/68686,0,3180.aspx</a></p>\n<p>נזדמן לו אדם אחד שהוא מכוער ביותר - במסכת דרך ארץ מפרש דאותו אדם היינו אליהו ולטוב נתכוין כדי שלא ירגיל בדבר.\n)</p>\n<p><strong>From the perspective of the spiritual growth that one must have in order to see Eliyahu ha'navi:</strong>\nThe passuk says</p>\n<p>וַיְהִי הֵמָּה הֹלְכִים הָלוֹךְ וְדַבֵּר וְהִנֵּה רֶכֶב אֵשׁ וְסוּסֵי אֵשׁ וַיַּפְרִדוּ בֵּין שְׁנֵיהֶם וַיַּעַל אֵלִיָּהוּ בַּסְּעָרָה הַשָּׁמָיִם.</p>\n<p>This means to say as follows:</p>\n<p>Eliyahu was frustrated with the limitations of olam hazeh:</p>\n<p>וְהוּא הָלַךְ בַּמִּדְבָּר דֶּרֶךְ יוֹם וַיָּבֹא וַיֵּשֶׁב תַּחַת רֹתֶם אחת [אֶחָד] וַיִּשְׁאַל אֶת נַפְשׁוֹ לָמוּת וַיֹּאמֶר רַב עַתָּה יְהוָה קַח נַפְשִׁי כִּי לֹא טוֹב אָנֹכִי מֵאֲבֹתָי.</p>\n<p>This frustration, and the desire to break out of these limitations, was the storm in which he left olam hazeh.</p>\n<p>From which we can derive that if one has a stormy and tempestuous desire to break out of the limitations that olam ha'zeh imposes on him, then he may meet Eliyahu, because he is ben gilo.</p>\n<p>I.e. if one wants to \"see\" Eliyahu ha'navi, he must also be עולה בסערה השמימה.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>There is magical formula to have him appear.</p>\n<p>You have Gemaras which say   לא משתעי אליהו בהדיה  about Amorim who were on a very high level.</p>\n<p>For example the Gemora Kesubos 61A says</p>\n<p>אבוה בר איהי ומנימין בר איהי חד ספי מכל מינא ומינא וחד ספי מחד\nמינא מר משתעי אליהו בהדיה ומר לא משתעי אליהו בהדיה</p>\n<p>There were two Amoriam, Avuh bar Ihi and Minyamin bar Ihi, who apparently were equal in other ways.</p>\n<p>Eliyohu spoke to one but not the other because  the first one was careful to  give his waiter the chance to eat from all the types  food before the meal. The other gave him something to eat before so he shouldn't be hungry but made wait until after the meal until he allowed to eat from everything (Rashi)</p>\n<p>So if you aren't living the type of life that first Amora did, don't expect Eliyohu to show up by you. Even if you are on a very high level like the second Amora</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Batei Dinim in an Unrighteous Generation\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah says that all we have are the judges in our days (Rashi Dvarim 17:9). In a generation where the people, including the judges, have succumbed to idolotary, can a person still go to one of these judges? Or would he have nothing except the Shulchan Aruch and halachic literature? If a person wants to convert and can see that the judges are idolotars and are practicing necromancy while he is with them, would he be entitled to convert under one since there is no one else he/she can find, or be forced to continue searching and potentially not convert? This seems reasonable, as throughout the Tanach, the people of Israel were sinning these kinds of sins unless they had one of the righteous kings. Even after 40 years with Moses, he said, \"You people have been sinners against H' for as long as I've known you\"\nThank you</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why didn't Abraham tell Isaac and Sarah about God's commandment to sacrifice Isaac?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why didn't Abraham share with Isaac and Sarah the fact that God had commanded him to sacrifice Isaac?</p>\n<p>The commentators say that Isaac knew of the plan in advance, but, his faith being as total as his father's, he had no hesitation about submitting (see, e.g., Kli Yakar and Rabbenu Bahya on Gen. 22:7-8; and Sefer HaYashar Midrash on Genesis, Vayera 18,20,21).  Even Ishmael and Eliezer knew of the plan (Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer 31:5).</p>\n<p>As for Sarah, she and Abraham were a team in their great devotion to God and together converted a lot of people to monotheism (\"the souls that they made in Haran\" in Gen. 12:5).</p>\n<p>Further, God never told Abraham not to reveal the plan to anybody.</p>\n<p>So why didn't he talk it over with his wife and son?  Did he suspect their faith wasn't as strong as his and would refuse to go along?  Anything about that in the Sources?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The scenario was clearly somewhat of an ethical dilemma that Avraham had to balance. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.98.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni, Parshas Vayera 98</a> notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>באותה שעה הרהר בלבו אברהם אם אני מודיע לשרה נשים דעתן קלה ואם לא אודיעה ואגנבנו כיון שאינה רואה אותו תחנק את עצמה</p>\n<p><em>At that time, Avraham thought to himself, \"If I make known to Sarah (G-d's command to sacrifice Yitzchak) - women are light-headed. But if I don't make it known, and I steal him away, when she sees that he is not there she will kill herself (out of anguish).\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the Yalkut continues that he requested that Sarah prepare food and drink so that they could rejoice. When she asked what exactly this 'rejoicing' was for, Avraham responded that they merited to have a son in their old age. He goes on to say that he first discovered Hashem aged three, now that Yitzchak was an adult he needed to be educated, and as such, he would bring him to a place to be properly trained. On hearing this Sarah gave him her blessing.</p>\n<p>Avraham consequently rose early the next day to ensure there was no chance for Sarah to change her mind and that they would not be seen by others. It was at this juncture that the Satan arrived. Firstly, he appeared in the appearance of an old man and asked Avraham where they were going. Avraham answered they were going to daven, to which the Satan queried, why he then also needed wood and the knife etc. Avraham promptly responds in case they get delayed and need to stop on the way. The Satan then went to Sarah and asked where Avraham was. Sarah answered that he was at his work. He then asked about Yitzchak's whereabouts, which she said that he was with Avraham. The Satan then interjected, 'But didn't you say that you wouldn't let him out of the house?' Sarah replies that he has not gone to work, but rather to pray. The Satan concludes the conversation by saying that you will not see him again, to which Sarah answers 'May Hashem do as He wills with my son.'</p>\n<p>So it would seem that Avraham had to grapple with this moral dilemma. On the one hand he didn't want to say it outright, but by the same token, if he spirited Yitzchak away it would also have ramifications. Therefore, perhaps to a certain degree whilst he didn't tell her completely, he subliminally prepared her. To the point, whereby when the Satan said that she will never see Yitzchak again, she answered with absolute faith and conviction that Hashem will do as He sees fit.</p>\n\n\n",

They see several hints to this in different verses. One is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.27.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 27:9</a>: “Through this (zot) will Jacob’s sin be forgiven” – i.e., on account of the holiness of Zot Chanukah.</em></p>\n<p><em>(The notion appears to be stated slightly differently in different works – such as that the judgment is sealed on Hoshanah Rabbah but not delivered until Chanukah, or that a \"temporary\" one is delivered earlier but the \"final version\" not till Chanukah, or that a Divine Hand is extended till the end of Chanukah awaiting our repentance.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Some explain the reasoning behind this is that once the High Holidays conclude, the “ordinary” year begins. This is a time in which we can put into practice the resolutions we made during the days of judgment. Thus, God gives us additional time to show Him our commitment and devotion – that this year really is better – and if we do so, to earn a better judgment. This initiation period of the year concludes with the end of Chanukah.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also note this post <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/30268/22152\">here</a> by @Menachem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism explain that Zot Hanukkah is a day to repent similar to Yom Kippur celebration. It is the final day in which to do teshuva, following Yom HaKippurim and Hoshana Rabba, the last chance to get a negative decree dissolved…. Zot has gematria 408, which is 3 times 136, 136 standing each for Tzom/fasting, Kol/prayer, and Mamon/charity, the three things to nullify an evil decree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I am guessing that you mean it does not start until after Hoshana Rabba.</p>\n<p>Hoshana Rabba is the last of the days of mercy.

This is a frequent theme in the tefillos of the yamim noraim, for example: Zachreinu le'chayim <strong>le'maanchah</strong> Elokim chayim.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Apparently we should say tamah zechus avos when neither of the above 2 mechanisms can be invoked.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Eliyahu Dessler in Michtav M'Eliyahu (cheilek alef - p.8) has an essay that focuses on understanding G-d's trait of Rachamim - mercy, and in particular, how it manifests itself along with Zechus Avos.</p>\n<p>He focuses on the specific middos that the avos excelled in and notes how it is this that creates a link to future generations. Their devotion and mesirus nefesh to the cause is what creates is our innate, ancestral link. For this reason one should read it not as 'zechus' but rather 'zakus' meaning the purity of the avos.</p>\n<p>He writes on p.15:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הלא הבטיח השי\"ת לאבות הקדושים כי תכלית כל הבריאה כולה תצא מהם וזרעם, וכל העתיד הגדול אשר יתגדל ויתקדש שמו של הקב\"ה לעין כל, הלא יהיה על ידי משיח צדקינו. אבל הלא מאברהם אבינו ע\"ה על דורו של משיח ישנן דורות הרבה, וכולם יוצאים אלו מאלו כמו השלשלת הארוכה, אשר טבעותיה דבוקות זו בזו. ובאופן כזה יש דורות או יחידים, שעל פי משפט מעשיהם אינם ראוים להתקיים, אבל מ\"מ מתקיימים, לא בזכות עצמם אלא בזכות אבותיהם וצאצאיהם. כי הדור הזה, או האנשים הללו, המה כמו טבעת בשלשלת החבור ההיא, ובזה היא סבת קיומם, כי בלעדיהם אין חבור בין אבותיהם לדורות יבואו. אדם אשר כזה יתקיים בעולם הזה, אף שאין לו שום זכות לזה מצד עצמו</p>\n<p><em>Did Hashem not promise to our holy forefathers that the purpose of all creation will come out of them and their seed, and all the great future which will grow and be sanctified in His name Hashem will be for all to see, and will it not be through Moshiach. But aren't there many generations from the point of Avraham avinu? All of them (i.e. the generations) come out of each other like a long chain whose rings are all linked with each other. And in this way there are generations or individuals, which according to the law of their deeds are not worthy of existence, but nevertheless they exist, not due to their own merits but the merits of their forefathers and their descendants. Because this generation, or these people, they are like rings in a chain that are interconnected, and this is the reason for their existence. Because without them, there would be no connection to the generations to come. A person like this will exist in this world, even though he has no right to it on his own part.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So to answer your question it would seem from Rav Dessler that this ancestral merit serves to aid our continued existence even when we are deemed unworthy. They showed us the correct way to act and these traits are something that we as a nation have been gifted throughout the generations.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>The concept of zechut avot, “merits of the fathers\" is problematic because it implies that the individual’s merit can be stored in a bank account and be used at a later date. The idea is linked to the flawed Christian notion called “original sin,” which some attribute to Genesis 1. Both ideas are contrary to the Torah. Thus, zechut avot \"ancestor’s good deeds\" is not a biblical concept at all. It follows that it does not [and cannot] work. How then, could Moses used his merit to save the Israelites?</p>\n\n\n",

The difference was that by Moshe, he was in the desert and thus, just the location of the burning bush was holy, but in the case of Yehoshua, he was already in the land of Israel and thus the entire 'place' was regarded as holy.)</p>\n\n\n",

Once you start with Rabbi Isserles' notes, you're in firm Ashkenazic territory from there. But that's still late 1500s. And there's still a lot of room for interpretation!</p>\n<p>Most of the popular commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch -- such as <em>Shach</em> and <em>Taz</em> on some of its sections -- reflect an Ashkenazic perspective (unless they spell out otherwise).</p>\n<p>By the 1800s and early 1900s, you have works such as Mishnah Brurah, Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, and Chayei Adam, among many, many others. Many of these works (with notable exception the <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em>) only address some subset of the Shulchan Aruch. (For example Mishnah Brurah is on <em>Orach Chaim</em>, which addresses daily practice. If someone says <em>I follow the Mishnah Brurah's opinion of how to spell a given name in a divorce document</em> or <em>who is responsible when a shared business dissolves</em>, they are pulling your leg.

The name of the month is Babylonian. It is a month of 30 days. Tishrei usually occurs in September–October on the Gregorian calendar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Egypt (French), we always called it Tishri.  See <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tishri\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tishri (en hébreu : תשרי, « tishri », « tichri », « tishrei » ou « tisseri ») est le 1er mois de l'année civile et le 7e mois de l’année ecclésiastique du calendrier hébraïque.  C'est un mois automnal de trente jours.  Le nom « tishri », d'origine akkadienne (tašrītu : « commencement », de šurrû : « commencer »), était largement utilisé depuis la captivité à Babylone, apparaissant dans le Talmud et le Targoum d'Onkelos.  Le Baal Hatourim dans son commentaire sur la Torah dans Béréchit 1:1 dit qu'en inversant les lettres de בראשית (Béréchit - Au commencement) on obtient א בתשרי (soit 1er tishri).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But not just in French.

Once we are grateful for what is, we can honestly evaluate whether we have helped creation attain perfection, or hindered it through our misdeeds. </p>\n<p>The High Holidays are not only about our sins - they are about our blessings. We have been given a marvelous world and we celebrate that on Rosh HaShanah. On Yom Kippur we think about how, in the year to come, we can enhance the sanctity of the many gifts we have been given.” </p>\n<p>Another Rabbi explained it this way:</p>\n<p>“Why does forgiveness (Yom Kippur) come before judgment (Rosh HaShanah)?</p>\n<p>You can't really forgive before you judge.\nFirst you need to determine what needs to be forgiven, only then can you consider true forgiveness. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, if we are forgiven in advance, we don't need to be judged. All is already good.\nBut all is not really good, for forgiveness that comes without remorse of the past and resolve for the future doesn't really fix the problem. </p>\n<p>If forgiveness was automatic and simple, we would never improve. Thus first we are judged. And judgment makes us think long and hard about our wrongdoings.And (with the conscience) knowing that we have done something wrong we try to improve ourselves and ask for forgiveness.”</p>\n<p>In my own words: we first look at what G-d has been given us, thats a lot to rejoice about, and at the same time we can see our shortcomings, for how did we pay our gratitude? What have we done in return? And that’s were the second part comes in. We can see what we might be judged for, we start to repent, and ask for forgiveness. </p>\n\n\n",

The answer is inconclusive, in my understanding. While <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/97141/20472\">one answer</a> brings Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan saying that while there may be aliens, they wouldn't have free will and as such could not convert, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/114689/20472\">an answer</a> on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/114683/other-species-in-deep-space-and-the-uniqueness-of-klal-yisrael/114689#114689\">a different question</a> brings a quote from Rabbi Soloveitchik in which he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is possible that Hashem created other life forms on other planets. It is no problem to yahadus. The reason man likes to think he is the only created being in the entire universe is because of his egotistical nature.</p>\n<p>Even the concept of am ha’nivchar may only be relative to our world, our small section of the universe. The Torah is written from the viewpoint of our sun, moon, and stars. It would not detract from our being the am ha’nivchar of this region of space if there were other am ha’nivchar in a distant galaxy. (The Rav Thinking Aloud, pg. 93)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, theoretically there may be another species somewhere in the universe which has its own chosen nation and quite possibly, its own Torah (and there may even be more than one such other species). One of the core concepts in being a chosen people is the \"Na'aseh v'Nishmah\" - besides for Hashem having chosen us, we chose to accept the Torah.<sup>2</sup> Further, Torah requires free will, for if there was no free will, why should one be punished or rewarded for doing something they had no control over? Therefore, it seems that according to Rabbi Soloveitchik, a theoretical alien chosen nation would have free will, too.</p>\n<p>Now the question is, even if we go through the route of Rabbi Soloveitchik, are aliens truly comparable to shedim? I believe not. These aliens have free will. Ramchal in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%9A_%D7%94%27_%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Hashem 1:5:1</a> defines shedim as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ואולם נמצא מין א׳ של נבראים שהוא כמו אמצעי בין רוחני וגשמי, והיינו שבאמת אינו מורגש מחושינו, וגם אינו נגבל בכל גבולי הגשם המורגש וחוקיו, ומצד זה נקראהו שלא בדקדוק רוחני, אבל נבדל בענינו מן הסוג המלאכיי, אעפ״י שיתדמה לו באיזה בחינות, ויש לו חוקים פרטיים וגבולים מיוחדים כפי מציאותו באמת, ונקרא זה המין השידיי, שהוא מין השדים, ואולם גם הוא יתחלק לפרטים אחרים, שישוב המין הכללי סוג לגביהם והם מינים אליו.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"However, there is one species of created beings that is like an intermediate between the spiritual and the physical, meaning that it isn't truly sensed by our senses, and also isn't bounded by all the boundaries of the sensed physicality and its laws, and from this side of the issue we shall call it haphazardly \"spiritual\", but it is in its essence divided from the angelic type, even though it is similar to it in some aspects, and it has unique laws and special boundaries like its nature truly is, and it is called the shed species, which is the species of the shedim, though even it can be divided into different individuals, so that the common species will be a type upon them and they are the individual members of the species to it.\"</p>\n<p>In other words, a shed is neither physical nor spiritual. Yet both are needed in a being to allow for free will. As such, it seems that shedim do not have free will<sup>3</sup>. Anything they do that appears to be them acting of their own free will is simply a semblance of free will. As such, it seems that they couldn't properly convert to Judaism. Per all of this, it seems that a shed could not convert.</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.hyomi.org.il/page.asp?id=458\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shimon Chirari</a> in Esmach BaHashem, siman 22 also mentioned this subject, with regards to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Gittin.68b.15?lang=bi&with=Ben%20Yehoyada&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the agadata</a> that Ashmadai disguised himself as King Shlomo and ruled in his stead for awhile - does his being with Shlomo's wives invalidate them to Shlomo? It's a long tshuvah, so I'll only bring some of it and summarize the rest:</p>\n<p>Rabbi Chirari begins by bringing the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Gittin.68b.18?lang=bi&with=Ben%20Yehoyada&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Yehoyada on Gittin 68b</a> who asks: If the biah of a shed is not allowed, why did Ashmadai do that with Shlomo's wives? After all, the Ari said: \"שהיה יהודי ואם לא ישמור הלכות יהודאין למה נקרא יהודי?\" (If he [Ashmadai] was Jewish, and he didn't keep the halachas of the Jews, why was he called a Jew?) - in other words, if he was Jewish, and his Judaism was on the condition that he keep halacha, why did he do something that was prohibited? From here we see evidence that the biah of a shed with a human woman isn't considered a biah, which is why a Jewish shed such as Ashmadai could do it without technically transgressing halacha.</p>\n<p>On this Rabbi Chirari asks two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"מה שכתב אם לא שומר הלכות יהודאין למה יקרא יהודי וקשה וכי מי שחוטא לא נקרא יהודי חס ושלום והלא איתא במציעא נט אומרים לי דוד הבא על אשת איש מיתתו במה ואני אומר להם מיתתו בחנק ויש לו חלק לעולם הבא וכלל גדול בידינו אף על פי שחטא ישראל\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Translation: \"What he wrote that if he doesn't keep the Jewish halachot why should he be called a Jew, and this is hard, for after all, is a person who sins not called a Jew ch\"v? After all, it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.59a.2?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 59</a> \"they say to me: David, one who engages in intercourse with a married woman, his death is effected with what form of execution? And I say to them: One who engages in intercourse with a married woman before witnesses and with forewarning, his death is by strangulation, but he still has a share in the World-to-Come\" and we have an important rule that a Jew, even if he sinned, is still a Jew.\"</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\"ועוד שאלה אני שואל לדעת הגאון בן יהוידע שהשד היה שומר הלכות יהודאין איך תבע להו בנידותייהו וקשה לומר שגם זה מותר בשד עם הבת אדם\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Translation: \"And another question I ask on the view of the gaon Ben Yehoyada that the shed kept the Jewish halachot, how could he demand of them, i.e., the queens, to engage in intercourse when they are menstruating? And it is difficult to say that this too is allowed with a shed and a female human...\"</p>\n<p>Rabbi Chirari expounds on the first question and explains that this issue means that the Ben Yehoyada's ruling isn't more conclusive than the Chida (also quoted by the Ben Yehoyada). On the second question, he says that most likely the biah of a shed isn't considered a prohibition, however the issue here is that this was a biah of a king (albeit, an imposter usurper in this case)<sup>4</sup>, which may have made the biah prohibited, but בדיעבד there was a leniency for the king's wives because of the threat of them becoming agunot.</p>\n<p>In short, it seems that according to Rabbi Chirari, what makes a shed Jewish isn't exactly clear, for being a Jew goes beyond one's capacity in fulfilling halacha (and similarly, conversions aren't simply overturned because one stops keeping halacha).</p>\n<p>I found <a href=\"https://www.ykr.org.il/question/15125\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this tshuva</a> by Rabbi Refael Mazuz:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"בפשטות יש לומר שהם שני סוגים. יש שדים שנבראו בערב שבת בין השמשות (פרקי אבות פרק ה'), ויש שדים שנבראים מעוונותיו של אדם.\nוראיתי להגאון רבי יוסף חיים בבן יהוידע (גיטין ס\"ח) שהביא מרבני האר\"י שיש כמה מיני שדים: יש שדים תתאין והם רעין מאוד, ויש עליונים, ויש שדין נוכראין ויש שדים יהודאים, וכתב שם שאשמדאי הוא שד יהודי עיין שם. ולפי זה כנראה שגם השד שהיה במעשה דרשב\"י (מעילה י\"ז) הוא שד יהודי.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"In simple terms, we must say that there are two types [of shedim]. There are shedim who were created on erev Shabbat at dusk and there are shedim who are created from the sins of man. And I saw the gaon Rabbi Yosef Chaim in the Ben Yehoyada who brought from the rabbis of the Ari that there are a few types of shedim: There are low shedim and they are very evil, and there are high ones, and there are gentile shedim and Jewish shedim, and he wrote there that Ashmadai is a Jewish shed, see there. And per this, it seems that the shed in the story of Rashbi was a Jewish shed.\"</p>\n<p>From here, it seems we can reconcile the two views: The first view, based on Rabbi Soloveitchik's answer, refers to the question of whether shedim can convert - it seems that they cannot, as they don't have free will. These are what can be termed as gentile shedim - they were created this way. However, there are other shedim who were created as Jewish shedim - from the sound of things, they are, in fact, inherently Jewish, as explain the Ari and Rabbi Chirari.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, Jewish shedim are, apparently, inherently Jewish, though they may transgress halacha sometimes<sup>5</sup> (as do most other people). However, they do not do this of their own free will, as they have none.</p>\n<p>Now the question would be: Can shedim make up a beit din? This question hinges on the question of whether a shed can be a dayan at all? I believe not, as they can't make a proper decision on their own, for not having free will. Their actions are entirely controlled by external factors, including Hashem, which invokes things such as \"we do not listen to a bat-kol\", \"lo bashamayim he\" (the Torah is not in heaven), etc. As such, they cannot make rulings, cannot be dayanim and cannot make up any sort of court.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Yes, this is a lot of speculation and svarot as I was not able to find a direct source on the subject.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Setting aside the כפה עליהם הר כגיגית for a moment, though this can also be rectified with קיימו וקיבלוה in the time of Esther.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> So also wrote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_ben_Solomon_Abraham_ha-Kohen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eliyahu HaKohen</a> in Agadat Eliyahu: \"אלא אפילו רוחות ושדים שאינן בעלי בחירה ורצון וטבע מוטבע בהם להזיק בלי יראה ופחד עם כל זה בראותם התפילין כי שם ה' נקרא עליך כח השם מבטל הטבע המוטבע בהם להזיק שלא יזוקו\" - Even dark spirits and shedim that don't have free choice and will and their nature is to cause harm without awe or fear, with all of this said, when they see the tefillin for the name of Hashem is called upon you, the power of the name cancels the nature embedded in them to cause harm and they do not harm.</p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadok_HaKohen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Tzadok HaKohen Rabinowitz</a> in Machshavot Charutz: \"גבי שדים ...דליכא בהו הילוך מדרגות שיוכלו להתעלות מצד השתדלותם כי אינם בעלי בחירה\" - On shedim...traveling between spiritual levels isn't relevant to them for they do not have free will.</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> Although it may be argued that he really was a king, for two reasons: a. Perhaps the din of a king depends on whether he is acting in a kingly position, even if he reached that position illegally (Ashmadai not being from the House of David) (The same might be argued about Ataliyah who was king's consort and later king's mother but really became queen (although I don't know if she was halachically queen; I don't know if there is such a concept in halacha) when <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.11.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">she killed the rest of the royal family</a>). b.

    "content": "# How to define the meaning of the punishment of the snake?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If I’m correct Sforno in his commentary on Bereshit 3:1 teaches in short that the snake represents ‘the power of imagination’ (imaginative faculty).</p>\n<p>The Or HaChayim teaches that Adam and Chava were able to understand ‘the language’ that the animals ‘spoke’.</p>\n<p>Abarbanel explains this, stating that the serpent did not speak literally, but through its actions and appearance (see also Job 12: 7-8, 28:14, 28:22, Psalm 148: 7 for similar examples) and the thought that man had about this.</p>\n<p>Hence, by the acts of the serpent, it was supposed that the fruits of the tree of knowledge would be delightfully good. Bereshit 3:10, according to Abarbanel, would mean, \"Adam's imagination was more tricky than the imagination of any other beast of the field. Because the human imagination is capable of forming syllogisms and arguments that appear to be true - something that animals are incapable of \". The snake is seen by the Chazal as the symbol of the imagination and the Zohar explains that the snake’s voice was not the voice of a living being, but 'an inner voice' (internal dialogue) which convinced Chava (defended and convincingly) to eat from the tree.</p>\n<p>If there was a real snake (external force) which through the power of our imagination formed an image (inner voice) which Chava and Adam thought of to be the truth, which caused them to sin. Then it was only an trigger which started this thought process.</p>\n<p>In such a case what should we make of the words spoken by HaShem in Bereshit 3:14-15?</p>\n<p>[And for those who would like to share other options/thoughts - if the snake (could be an animal, satan, yetzer hara or one of the malachim) did indeed literally spoke to Chava then why was it cursed? Wasn’t the snake just fulfilling (its mission/task/purpose) what it was made for.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I understand these <em>pessukim</em> as follows.</p>\n<p>The snake is not necessarily a separate entity to man, rather the snake represents the ability of man to act in a snake-like manner. Thus the curse of the snake is a curse on people who are snake-like.</p>\n<p>And the curse means that ultimately their felony will be exposed, and their lowliness will become apparent. As the <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/mesilat/mesilat11-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mesillas Yesharim</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משל לבית מלא תבן, והיה בבית חורין, והיה התבן נכנס בהם, לאחר ימים התחיל\nאותו התבן שהיה בתוך אותם החורין יוצא, ידעו הכל כי היה אותו בית של תבן.\nכן הדבר הזה, שלא יוכלו תמיד להסתיר את עצמם, ומחשבתם הרעה תהיה ניכרת\nמתוך מעשיהם</p>\n<p>It is analogous to a house full of straw, and there were cracks in the\nwalls of the house, and the straw started seeping through the cracks.\nAfter a few days the straw started emerging outside the house and\neveryone realised the house was full of straw. So too is this matter,\nthat arrogant will not be able to constantly hide their true selves,\nand their evil thoughts will become apparent from their deeds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Since you quoted the Arbabanel I would add that he also points out that the greatest \"punishment\" for the serpent should have been removing the serpent's ability to speak! And yet that's not listed as the punishment. But it's also worth noting that the serpent seems to lose its ability to speak before God begins punishing. God calls out Adam, Adam speaks and blames the wife, the wife speaks and blames the snake, and the snake...doesn't speak.</p>\n<p>However, the question is about the punishment and making sense of it. I'm a believer in using the surrounding text to try and make sense of things. So here's what I've noticed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There are 3 beings that are punished</li>\n<li>Adam's punishment is plainly related to his sin of eating a forbidden fruit, so now he will struggle to farm for the rest of his life. From this I'm willing to wager that the other punishments are also related to their sins.</li>\n<li>Let's look at the other two punishments and see if they can shed light on the sins.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On a cursory look, Eve's punishments look fairly detached from her sin. She ate the fruit and so now her childbirth is painful? But perhaps her sin wasn't truly the eating of the fruit, but rather what she hoped to achieve by eating the fruit. The serpent told her that by eating the fruit she would be \"like God.\"</p>\n<p>\"\nה  כִּי, יֹדֵעַ אֱלֹהִים, כִּי בְּיוֹם אֲכָלְכֶם מִמֶּנּוּ, וְנִפְקְחוּ עֵינֵיכֶם; וִהְיִיתֶם, כֵּאלֹהִים, יֹדְעֵי, טוֹב וָרָע.     5 for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.' \"</p>\n<p>It's my opinion that Eve's only experience with God is Him being the creator of all life. Therefore, to her being like God is to be able to create life, and so this was her intent when she ate of the fruit. This not only explains her punishment, but also explains why she and Adam didn't have kids until after being cast out of the garden.</p>\n<p>So if Eve wanted to be able to create life, then what did the snake want? Obviously the snake needs some kind of motive, or else why risk God's wrath? Well, let's look at its/their punishment and see if there's anything that ties his punishment to her punishment.</p>\n<p>\"\n.'\nיד  וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים אֶל-הַנָּחָשׁ, כִּי עָשִׂיתָ זֹּאת, אָרוּר אַתָּה מִכָּל-הַבְּהֵמָה, וּמִכֹּל חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה; עַל-גְּחֹנְךָ תֵלֵךְ, וְעָפָר תֹּאכַל כָּל-יְמֵי חַיֶּיךָ.    14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent: 'Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou from among all cattle, and from among all beasts of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.\nטו  וְאֵיבָה אָשִׁית, בֵּינְךָ וּבֵין הָאִשָּׁה, וּבֵין זַרְעֲךָ, וּבֵין זַרְעָהּ:  הוּא יְשׁוּפְךָ רֹאשׁ, וְאַתָּה תְּשׁוּפֶנּוּ עָקֵב.  {ס}   15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; they shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise their heel.' {S}\n\"</p>\n<p>The first part of the serpent's punishment is interesting. The snake is now more cursed than all cattle and beasts of the field. This makes sense because the serpent caused humans to sin when the other animals are blameless, but how is that punishment connected to: enmity between woman's seed and serpent's seed?</p>\n<p>It's my opinion that the first part of the punishment is echoing back to Adam's failed attempt to mate with the cattle and the beasts of the field (of which the snake would have been a part of).</p>\n<p>Genesis 2:20\nכ  וַיִּקְרָא הָאָדָם שֵׁמוֹת, לְכָל-הַבְּהֵמָה וּלְעוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם, וּלְכֹל, חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה; וּלְאָדָם, לֹא-מָצָא עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ.   20 And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.</p>\n<p>The second part of the punishment ties into Eve's desire to get pregnant, and my theory is that the snake wanted to be the one to impregnate her. Therefore not only did God diminish the serpent, I believe God removed <em>all</em> of the serpent's appendages, and as the final touch God put enmity between the serpent's seed and Eve's seed as a punishment fitting the almost crime. This also provides motive for the snakes actions, because otherwise the snake appears to have nothing to gain for taking Eve down this path.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In Genesis 3:14, after the snake seduced Eve and after she ate of the fruit of the tree of good and evil, G-d declared: “You will eat dust all the days of your life.” We could ask, was this a curse? It has been well-documented that snakes do not eat dust. However, if we refer to the previous verse, we read “you will go upon your belly.” When we put the two verses together, we realize that this is a metaphor that should not be taken literally. The Bible is saying that the snake will crawl on its belly and its face will be in the dust.</p>\n<p>With regards to יצר הרע, an evil inclination, my rabbi feels that the yetzer hara is not real in the sense that it exists sperate from humans, although humans have the ability to exercise their free will. Furthermore, neither humans nor animals were cursed in the Garden of Eden story. Adam and Exe exercised their free will as G-d intended. It is a gift, not a curse, from Adam and Eve. Besides, if this was such a calamity, why did G-d place the snake in the garden in the first place?</p>\n\n\n",

Until the conclusion of the day of Atonement we ‎are full of fear rather than filled with joy, as befits the festival ‎days. The Torah had set aside the last of these ten days as one on ‎which each one of us is to practice self-denials as part of the ‎process of repentance. (Leviticus 23,29) so much so that anyone ‎not following these instructions is warned that he will lose his ‎share in the hereafter for having failed to do so. Anyone ‎exploiting these ten days for repentance, however, has only ‎fulfilled the minimum requirement, i.e. <strong>he has repented out of a ‎fear of punishment</strong>. When the Day of Atonement has passed and ‎we are preoccupied with the various commandments that enable ‎us to celebrate Sukkot joyously, our mood undergoes a ‎drastic change and we are happy to have the opportunity to ‎fulfill the many commandments connected with that festival. <strong>The ‎effect of all this is that our repentance, which previously could be ‎attributed merely to our fear of punishment, has now become ‎repentance from a feeling of love for G-d and His Torah. The effect ‎of this is so powerful that iniquities we were guilty of before the ‎ten day period of repentance, have now become the catalyst of ‎our mitzvah performance so that in retrospect these ‎iniquities also have become something constructive, as without ‎the need to repent them and to take steps to rehabilitate ‎ourselves we would never have done so</strong>.‎</em>\n(Sefaria Translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea being, that it is a crucial secondary step to achieving a full repentance and that is why it has to be in Tishrei.</p>\n\n\n",

These types of mitzvos don't have their place in 'Sefer Zechuyos' as the intention behind them was not for the sake of heaven, but only for our own ulterior motives. However, Hashem in His abundant kindness judges us favourably as the conditions of place, time and the worries of life and livelihood are what caused it, and thus they are included in the Sefer Zechuyos.</p>\n<p>As a result we specifically daven that we be written in the Book of Merits so that we be judged favourably and that the mitzvos that we perform that are driven by ulterior motives or any other defect be nevertheless written in the sefer zechuyos. At the same time we continue to ask that it purify our minds to remove all the impurities that mixed together with these commandments until they join and are purified, and can join the mitzvos we have done for Hashem's sake, and in so doing, will increase our merits and our righteousness will emerge.</p>\n<p>(As brought in the טללי אורות - ראש השנה quoting the חפץ חיים על התורה p.481)</p>\n\n\n",

However, if he were to lie with her by way of harlotry, without the name of betrothal, it is nothing (towards her status as being a married woman). Even if he lies with her with the intent of marriage, mutually agreed between him and her, she is not considered as his wife and even if she dedicated herself only for him, rather the opposite is true and he must be forced (by Beis Din) to send her away from his home.\"</p>\n<p>Rema:\" For certainly she would be considered an embarrassment for immersion in a mikveh and he will lie with her in ritual impurity (niddah); however, if she dedicates herself exclusively for him as his wife and she immerses for him, there are those who would say that this is allowed and she would be a Pilegesh as described in the Torah and there are those who say that this is forbidden and they should both get whiplashes from the Torah as they have transgressed the precept \"don't be a kedesha\"</p>\n<p>The Rema clearly explains that this passage is related to the risk of transgressing the laws on the niddah, while the case of the pilegesh, albeit controversial, does not concern this question since it is assumed that the pilegesh goes to the mikveh, being the her  a public relationship.</p>\n<p>The following passage seems to me to confirm that the passage by Even HaEzer 26: 1 has the meaning that the Rema attributes to it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.15.30?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even HaEzer 15:30</a></p>\n<p>\"One who had a pilegesh (commonly translated as concubine, a woman with whom one lives but does not necessarily have a full contractual, formal marriage lacking kiddushin, acquisition and engagement, or ketuba, contract of marital obligations, which of the two precisely is a dispute in the Talmud and Rishonim. The permissibility of a pilegesh is also a dispute. In this case, the pilegesh is a partner, a woman one is living with and the binding legality of the relationship between the two is in question) and it was not testified that he betrothed her (via formal kiddushin) - she is permitted to his relatives. However, if there were witnesses that the (pilegesh) woman (herself) said: \"he betrothed me before two witnesses,\" she is forbidden to his relatives. However, if she said: \"he betrothed me,\" simply, and she did not say: \"before two witnesses,\" there is nothing (of relevance to court) in her words.\"</p>\n<p>Here Maran points out that the halachic lawfulness of this relationship is controversial,but he recognizes as a concrete hypothesis that a Jewish man  has a pilegesh (\"One who had a pilegesh\"),without stating that this is halachically prohibited.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in my opinion,  Shulchan Aruch cannot be said to prohibit pilegesh,since  Maran  leaves this  question open.</p>\n<p>However, I ask myself :is correct this English translation of Even HaEzer 15.30 present in Sefaria site?

He will remain thus, as He is eternal, the same G-d that existed even prior to the dawn of the universe. In all respects He is אחד, one, i.e. unique, not part of a twosome or threesome. No such self sufficient Being exists in His universe. Neither is there ever going to be a Being comparable to Him. A different interpretation of this verse: all the nations have claimed this Being as their household god. Now that the Jewish people have claimed Him as theirs, it has become known throughout the world that He is our G-d, seeing that He communicates with us directly. If the Torah instead of writing as it did, had only written: ה' אלוקינו אחד, “the Lord our G-d is unique,” this uniqueness would have been perceived as restricted to His nation Israel, just like they each worship their own national deity. They would have said so even more if the Torah had only written: שמע ישראל אלוקינו אחד, “hear Israel our G-d is One.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Excellent question!</p>\n<p>The sentence you are quoting is the first sentence of the Shema, namely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ יְהוָ֥ה ׀ אֶחָֽד׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the essence of your question is, \"I noticed the verse doesn’t state: <em>“HaShem Hu Echad”</em>, but only <em>“HaShem echad”</em> <strong>why is this?</strong>\"</p>\n<p>This really relates more to reading without the cantillation. In the sentence, the <em>Mercha</em>, which is also known as <em>Ma'arich</em>, under the letter Vav in the first appearance of G-d's name (יְהוָ֥ה), extends that word to the word which follows it, namely <em>Our G-d</em>. The meaning here in translation is:</p>\n<p><strong><em><strong><strong>(this particular)</strong></strong> four letter name</em> which we associate with <em>our G-d</em>...</strong></p>\n<p>The letter Heh of the word, <em>Our G-d</em> has <em>Tifcha</em> under it (אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ), which has a connotation of joining to the word which precedes it and also to closing the phrase. It serves sort of like a comma in English.</p>\n<p>So together, the phrase means <em><strong>this four letter name</strong> which we associate to our G-d</em>, (that/the) four letter name of G-d...</p>\n<p>The emphasis here is that there is a distinction between our G-d, meaning G-d at His essence, and His name.</p>\n<p>There are many different concepts discussed in the literature of the Torah explaining the many facets of these concepts. But on the simplest level, G-d at His essence is what we recall from the giving of the Torah at Sinai. We saw no form, etc. G-d at His essence transcends all of creation in every sense.</p>\n<p>And yet, we have been given names that we are to associate with G-d. One of them that is particularly associated to the Jewish people is the four letter name in this sentence like is emphasized in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.3.13-15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 3:13-15</a>.</p>\n<p>And this name is comprised of four letters which have different shapes, values and sounds. This could imply that G-d, at His essence, also has these distinctions in some way because it is <em><strong>His name</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>The sentence then continues (<em>after the comma/pause from the Tifcha mentioned above</em>) by repeating that same four letter name associated with G-d and has a <em>Munach l'Garmeh</em> after it, (which implies another rest/separation point from the word which follows which completes the thought) and states it (meaning this name) is one.</p>\n<p>In terms of understanding the <em>Munach l'Garmeh</em>, consider it similar to a semicolon. It's a pause between two main clauses and is more than a simple comma. In this case, the first clause is HaShem is our G-d. The second is HaShem is one.</p>\n<p>This has multiple meanings. It means that this name itself is one, contrary to what we might think because we see that it is comprised of individual letters. And this is similar to the idea of your body being comprised of many limbs. But the individual limbs of ones body are all a single being. So too here, these four letters are to be understood as a single being/concept.</p>\n<p>But it also means that this name which we have been told to associate with G-d at His essence (and which could be thought of as separate and distinct from G-d), is one with His essence! And that is a true wonder and something impossible to truly comprehend. That we are to accept that this name is one in the same way that we are taught that G-d at His essence is one, transcending all aspects of creation <em>with an <strong>absolute</strong> simplicity</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Yehoshua was summoned to be with Moshe as he has recently been appointed as the new leader subject to Moshe's death.

Therefore when he came to explain it, Yehoshua was a helper in the mission of Moshe in order that he prepare and educate the entire people and that is why it writes Hoshea and not Yehoshua - Because he did not do it because he was Yehoshua the leader of Israel but rather because he was a disciple of Moshe Rabbeinu called Hosea.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem that Yehoshua was there to shadow Moshe and to be present so that the Jewish people saw him clearly as the successor.</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, the Ohr HaChaim writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוא והושע בן נון. פירוש היה עומד עמו אבל הדיבור לא דיבר אלא משה כאומרו וידבר, וכן אמר ה' ולמדה את בני ישראל שימה בפיהם לשון יחיד אל משה, ואומרו והושע ולא אמר ויהושע כמו שקרא לו משה, לפי שתוספת היו''ד היא ליקר וגדולה כרמוז במאמר (במדבר י''ג ט''ז) ויקרא משה להושע וגו' וכשהשוום הכתוב ואמר הוא והושע בן נון הסיר היו''ד, על דרך אומרו (ישעי, י, טו) היתפאר הגרזן וגו'</p>\n<p><em>הוא והושע בן נון, \"he and Joshua son of Nun.\" Although Joshua stood beside Moses, G'd's word came only to Moses, as is plain from the words וידבר ה׳ אל משה in verse 48. Although Moses had added the letter י to Joshua's name in Numbers 13,16, this was in order to lend him prestige vis-a-vis Israel. When G'd mentions Joshua's name, it remained unchanged as it was not appropriate to make him look prestigious vis-a-vis his teacher (Compare Isaiah 10, 15: \"Is the axe going to boast in the presence of the wood cutter?\").</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It seems to be a dispute.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.32.44?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Or_HaChaim_on_Deuteronomy.32.44.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Ohr HaChaim</strong></a> says that it's clear from the grammar of the verse that only Moshe spoke the song.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פירוש היה עומד עמו אבל הדיבור לא דיבר אלא משה כאומרו וידבר, וכן אמר ה' ולמדה את בני ישראל שימה בפיהם לשון יחיד אל משה</p>\n<p>Meaning, [Yehoshua] stood with [Moshe], but only Moshe spoke message.

However, rabbi Arnold Ehrlich disagreed. He felt that clouds are not huts.</p>\n<p>He also felt that Sukkot was originally a harvest festival. When the holiday changed during second temple times, the Israelites, then traveling to the then small Jerusalem by pilgrimage, could not find an inn, used hastily constructing booth (sukkot), going on “strike.” In order to counter this, the Israelite leadership told everyone to live in a sukkah.</p>\n<p>In addition, Ehrlich says that the reason why Jews dwell in sukkahs today is that ancient Israelites dwelt in them upon leaving Egypt (Leviticus 23:43).</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara rejects this argument: This is <strong>no</strong> proof; <strong>perhaps Yosef the demon</strong>, who does not observe Shabbat, <strong>reported</strong> these teachings and brought them from Sura to Pumbedita.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>What I know so far</h1>\n<p>I looked around at a couple of blogs (see <a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/eruvin-43/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://people.ucalgary.ca/%7Eelsegal/Shokel/181109_SpeedDemon.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) but the material does not seem very well sourced.</p>\n<p>Are there any documented sources who explain who he is?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Adding to @Dov's answer, Yosef the Shed was a shed who would assist the sages by giving them info on shedim, as Sforno writes on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sforno_on_Leviticus.17.7.1?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 17:7</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"חקת עולם תהיה זאת שלא יזבחו לשעירים אף על פי שלא היו מקבלים אותם לאלוה בשום פנים אבל היו חפצים בחברתם להיות השדים להם משרתים ומסייעים בעסקיהם או שליחותם אל ארץ רחוקה כמו שהזכירו (חולין פרק כל הבשר) על יוסף שידא ועל שידא דהוה שכיח בי רב אשי...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"This shall be to them a law for all time that they may offer their sacrifices no more to the goat-demons, even if they don't accept them upon them as a god in way whatsoever, but were interested in their company for the demons to be servants to them and assisting them in their businesses or their ventures to far-off lands, as they mentioned (Chulin ch.

A very useful resource is the sefer Torah Temimah which deals with the Talmudic interpretations on a verse by verse basis. Nevertheless, I will try to give a few general rules as to when one might learn two halachos from one passuk.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is that one could only learn the minimum from any specific drasha. So for example, if the Torah says a rule that requires a multiple of something, that means two, which is the minimum of multiple numbers. Similarly, if a word or letter is extra, one can only make one drasha to explain the extra word. Sometimes, however, there are more than one extra words or letters in a passuk, which require multiple drashos. (Many disputes in the Talmud revolve around whether a word or letter is extra or not, see Megillah 2a for example.)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Some halachos are derived from the simple meaning of the verse. In this case there is no limitation as to how many halachos can be learned, as they are not drashos per se but simple translations. If in addition to the simple meaning, there is something requiring a drasha in the verse, that would be explained as teaching a halacha additional to those learned from the simple meaning.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A good example is the case the questioner mentioned in his comments. The first halacha comes from a grammatical reading of the word השב (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Metzia.2.9?lang=he&with=Rambam&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam there</a>), and the second comes from the extra word תשיבם. (h/t <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.22.1?lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Torah_Temimah_on_Torah%2C_Deuteronomy.22.2&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Temimah</a>, which is my go-to sefer for these issues.)</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>If the drasha makes a comparison between two topics, multiple details might be the result of the comparison. This for example is the rule of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Keritot.22b.12?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אין היקש למחצה</a>. Since the Torah compared the two topics, we assume they are similar unless there is a reason otherwise.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>3.Sometimes the Gemara will make an <em>asmachta</em> or attribute a law to a verse even though the law is not actually derived from the verse. In that case, the law might be attributed to a verse that really teaches a different halacha.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.3a.13?lang=he&p2=Shita_Mekubetzet_on_Bava_Kamma.3a&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for the more rare case of two equal drashos being learned from the same passuk and a discussion of the rules.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

The Gemara explains: What\nis the reason for that arrangement? These species constitute three\nmitzvot, and this etrog is only one mitzva. One accords deference to\nthe greater number of mitzvot by taking the three species in the right\nhand. Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zerika: What is the reason that we\nrecite the blessing only with the formula: About taking the lulav,\nwith no mention of the other species? Rabbi Zerika said to him: Since\nit is highest of them all and the most conspicuous, the other species\nare subsumed under it. Rabbi Yirmeya asks: And if that is the only\nreason, let him lift the etrog higher than the lulav and recite the\nblessing mentioning it. Rabbi Zerika said to him that he meant: <strong>Since\nthe tree of its species is the tallest of them all, it is the most\nprominent, and therefore it is appropriate for the formula of the\nblessing to emphasize the lulav.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though previous questions noted height as the reason for our focus on the lulav in the bracha \"Al Netilas Lulav,\" my question is why Chazal say height is the tie-breaker at all (rather than another form of importance like beauty or fragrance)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My Rebbe explained to me that the size requirement for the arba minim (and other things) is a requirement of chashivus. (That is why the lulav of an ir hanidachas is passul: since it must be burned it has no chashivus.) I believe this answers your question. If the lulav must be the largest type, it must also be the most chashuv.</p>\n<p>As for fragrance, it is natural but not required. An esrog that is kosher but has no smell is perfectly kosher.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Looking beyond Tractate Sukkah, the Midrash says that the four species represent four types of people.  The lulav represents those who have scholarly knowledge but do not perform good deeds. The etrog represents those who both have scholarly knowledge and perform good deeds.  [Leviticus Rabbah 30:12]</p>\n<p>So if only one must be chosen for the blessing, shouldn't it be the etrog?  Two thoughts:</p>\n<p>1-The etrog represents a goal that is unattainable in full for most of us.  Also, it is the most expensive of the four species, and because of its shape it must be held separately from the other three (one hands holds the etrog and the other holds the other three), and physically it does not easily mingle with the others.</p>\n<p>2-The blessing points only to the beginning.  And that beginning is to study.  The Sources  tell us: \"Honoring father and mother, practicing deeds of loving-kindness, attending school morning and evening, being hospitable to guests, visiting the sick, dowering the bride, attending the dead to the grave, being devoted in prayer, and making peace between people.  And the study of Torah is equivalent to them all (וְתַלְמוּד תּוֹרָה כְּנֶגֶד כֻּלָּם -- V'Talmud Torah k'neged kullam).\" [Peah 1:1; Shabbat 127a]</p>\n<p>Doing the right thing requires knowledge and planning.  These must come first, and if they are good, good things usually follow.  Scholars ensure continuity by keeping knowledge alive, thereby motivating future generations to be more observant.  Absent scholarship, future generations may not be sure of what is expected of them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Akiva said: ... Study is greater, for it leads to practice. The Sages concluded: ... Study is greater, for it leads to action. [Kidd. 40b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I've had the same question for years. Perhaps one could say that on the \"kabbalistic\" side of things, this would indicate that the way something is in this world physically, its counterpart in the upper realms is similar. Meaning if something is tall physically in this world, there is a mirror \"tallness\" in the upper worlds. This is similar as to why “Rebbie (Rabbi Yehuda the Nasi) honored the wealthy; Rabbi Akiva honored the wealthy.” Eruvin 86a</p>\n\n\n",

Why does it seemingly waste so much time doing this? How is this at all relevant? Perhaps the answer lies in interpretation.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Akiva said that the most important verse of the Torah was Leviticus 19:18, that you shall \"Love your neighbor as you love yourself.\" But Ben Azzai disagreed. He felt that Genesis 5:1 surpassed Leviticus 19:18 (Sifra). Not because loving your neighbor is less important but because by saying that Genesis 5 is more important we are recognizing that we are all descendants of Adam and Eve (Nachmanides, Genesis 5:2). Of course, I think Ben Azzai was speaking figuratively. The point was not really that you could trace your lineage to one ancient genetic Adam, the point was that we all share one Creator. Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5 explains that we all share a common ancestor so that no one could say that \"My ancestor was greater than yours (Jerusalem Talmud, Nedarim 9).\" All humans, Jews, and non-Jews were created in G-d's image. Thus, I think the genealogy of the generations of Adam (Genesis 5) is very helpful here. It now makes perfect sense why the Torah planted its list of genealogy here, at the very beginning of the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

As is the case for most of Rashi's comments, this passage is taken from an earlier midrashic source, in this case Sifrei # 337 (and parallels). Rashi did not leave out any examples; he merely reported the Midrash as he had it.</p>\n<p>Some later commentators attempted to come up with some reason why the case of Abraham's circumcision does not fit into the same category as the others (e.g. Divrei Dovid and Sifsei Chachamim on the verse in Deuteronomy), but such answers tend to not account for the fact that Rashi and the Midrash say that there are three instances of this in the Torah, not that there are three instances of a particular type.</p>\n<p>However, there is a slightly different version of the Midrash preserved in Yalkut Midrashei Teiman:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בשלשה מקומות נאמר בעצם היום הזה נאמר בנוח בעצם היום הזה בא נוח במראות אורו שליום לפי שהיו אנשי דורו אומרים בכך וכך אם אנו מרגישים בו אין אנו מניחים אותו ליכנס בתיבה ולא עוד אלא אנו נופלים כשילים וקרדמות ומבקעים את התיבה אמר הב\"ה הריני מכניסו בחצי היום וכל מי שיש בידו יבא למחות יבא וימחה באברהם נאמר בעצם היום הזה נמול אברהם שהיו אנשי דורו אמרו אלו ראינוהו לא הנחנוהו לימול אמר הב\"ה הו נמול בחצי היום בגבורת היום ביום הכפורים עצמו ומי שיש בידו יכול יבא וימחה במצרים נאמר בעצם היום הזה הוציא ה' לפי שהיו מצרים אומרים בכך וכך אם אנו מרגישין בהם אין אנו מניחים אותן לצאת ולא עוד אלא אנו נוטלים סייפות וכלי זיין והורגים בהם אמר הב\"ה הריני מוציאם בחצי היום לעיניהם וכל מי שיש בו כוח למחות יבא וימחה אף כאן במיתתו שלמשה נאמר בעצם היום הזה לפי שהיו ישראל אומרים בכך וכך אם אנו מרנישים אין מניחין אותו שהוציאנו ממצרים וקרע לנו את הים והוריד לנו את המן והגיז לנו את המליו והעלה לנו את הבאר ונתן לנו את התורה אין אנו מניחין אותו אמר הב\"ה הריני מכניסו בחצי היום</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this version, Abraham's case is mentioned and it falls into precisely the same category wherein the term בעצם היום הזה is taken to be God's challenge to anyone to stop him. However, in this version the Midrash is saying that there are three cases in addition to the one being commented on, i.e. four in total, which is in fact true. It is saying that just like in the other three cases where this term is used it alludes to God's challenge to any naysayers, here too it alludes to God's challenge to naysayers.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The locations that Rashi cites are actions by Hashem and not by human beings. Thus, the commentary by Rashi pointing out that Hashem performed the actives in broad daylight to show that he would prevent anyone from attempting to interfere. The fourth pasuk cited was about the action of Avraham which was done in brouad daylight in order to show that he did not care if anyone objeted. Additionally, Rashi in the locations cited points out that there were people who stated that they would prevent this from being done. In the case of Avraham, there were no people who stated in advance that they would prevent the circumcisions from taking place. Thus that pasuk was not relevant to the explanation.</p>\n\n\n",

There are various scenarios and viewpoints about the events and what we can or cannot expect.</p>\n<p>The two main viewpoints you're referring to are split between the <strong>Rambam</strong> (who believed that the third temple would be built by man) and <strong>Rashi</strong> (who endorsed the idea the third temple would be created by Hashem and would descend from heaven)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/148182/jewish/Who-Will-Build-the-Third-Beit-Hamikdash-Man-or-G-d.htm#footnote3a148182\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad has a short article discussing the beliefs about the third temple and how to reconcile the opinions.</a></strong></p>\n<p>It can be argued that part of the reason for the shift in opinion towards a heavenly temple is the political situation in the modern State of Israel.</p>\n<p><strong>The Third Temple cannot currently be built.</strong> The central issue is the political conflict around the temple mount itself. The temple mount is stuck in a religious tug of war between the Arabs/Muslims and the Jewish people/Israelis. Any change to the status quo of the current location creates a huge conflict with both local Israeli-Arabs, Palestinians, and the surrounding Arab states in the region. <em><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Temple_Mount_crisis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Back in 2017, there was an attempt to put metal detectors at the gates of the mount after a terrorist attack and there were riots for weeks.</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>Israel actually bans Jewish religious use of the location (up top) as a means to appeasing the status quo. You will be arrested for uttering a Jewish prayer up top outside of extremely specific circumstances. Israelis have been fighting this in court for years now.</p>\n<p><strong>Due to the current restrictions Israelis face in modern society regarding the mount, this has likely resulted in a shift toward the Rashi position since there doesn't seem to be a functional way of building the temple without a major conflict.</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>If we can't do it then obviously, Hashem will do it.</strong></em></p>\n<p>The main obstacle with building the temple currently is the golden dome sitting at the top.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2019/03/000_1E26H0.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The golden dome</a></strong> <em>(built in the footprint of the second temple)</em> blocks the location from Jewish use and we couldn't put the temple anywhere else since the focal point of the temple is where the original sacrificial altar originally was. The temple would be built where the dome is as the altar would sit in a specific location directly in front. This isn't an option currently.</p>\n<p>This hasn't stopped organizations from forming which hold the Rambam's opinion. <strong><a href=\"https://templeinstitute.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Temple Institute of Israel is an organization dedicated to the building of the third temple.</a></strong> They have been funding the groundwork for years about how the temple will be built and preparing the necessary materials for temple processes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/A3F30CwkHMA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">They were actually responsible for spearheading the breeding program which brought the Red Heifers back to Israel.</a></p>\n<p>If they were given the green light they would likely start building tomorrow. Their belief is it is a religious duty for the Jewish people to rebuild the temple and to restart temple processes. It doesn't matter if mashiach has yet to arrive as the religious duty is imperative regardless of mashiach's arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>The secondary issue with the rebuilding of the temple is we have no high priest and we have no Sanhedrin.</strong></p>\n<p>The high priest manages the activities of the Beit Hamikdash. We have no one who would be manage temple processes as a high priest doesn't currently exist.</p>\n<p>We also don't have a Sanhedrin and the high priest was the head of the Sanhedrin. Attempts to have revived this body have failed so we don't have two major necessities for the creation of the third temple.</p>\n<p>This is part of the reason why the \"descend from heaven\" opinion gains support. The Mashiach may be the only one who can truly establish the authority of the Sanhedrin once again and he will likely be the one who determines the priesthood and establishes and dedicates the third temple. There are too many unknowns which we would need to work through.</p>\n\n\n",

(For example, they discuss whether the <em>kohen</em> must return the redemption money if the baby died after the redemption before the baby turned a month old.)</p>\n<p>Considering the redemption celebrations that people make on such an occasion nowadays<sup>[2]</sup> in the United States, and considering that sometimes it would doubtless be more convenient to hold such a party on one day than on another for a variety of reasons, I'm surprised that I've never heard of a redemption being held early.  Why not?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>[1] I haven't studied that <em>g'mara</em>.</sup></p>\n<p><sup>[2] Not <em>right</em> now, during the COVID-19 epidemic, but more generally.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is not clear that you can redeem the child before he is a month old. What is clear in the sources is you can give the money to the priest before the child is a month old stipulating that the money is for the redemption which will take effect only later at the correct time. No mitzva is accomplished yet at this early ceremony. It's likely more comparable to building a sukkah before sukkot; you are putting all the right pieces in the right places so later you can perform the mitzva correctly. (This is true at least according to Shemuel there, who we probably rule like, that the money needs to stay in the priest's possession until after the redemption takes effect.)</p>\n<p>Accordingly, when asked about giving the money on a Friday for a child who would be ready for redemption only on Shabbat, the Terumat Hadeshen (1:269) discouraged it because it leads to a doubt about when to say the blessing (there is no mitzva done on Friday and there is no action done on Shabbat) and when to have the meal (there is nothing to celebrate on Friday and on Shabbat a meal would not accomplish any publicizing of the mitzva). Accordingly he thought it better to wait for Sunday when the ceremony can all go smoothly. Pushing off the redemption is not ideal but not nearly as problematic as, say, pushing off a circumcision.</p>\n<p>(Maharshal (#7) argued that it would be better to do it on Friday in the above case, but common practice is apparently not that way.)</p>\n\n\n",

A non-Jew who does a great act will still be rewarded, even if they aren't Jewish, as the Tiferet Yisrael pointed out previously that non-Jews are not animals and therefore, worthy of Hashem's just judgement. And after that he explains that even if they didn't follow the halachot of non-Jews perfectly, because of the great things they did, they would still be deserving of reward:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ואת\"ל דאף אלו החסידים הנ\"ל אע\"ג שקיימו הז' מצות של בני נח, אפ\"ה אין דינם כגרי תושב, מדלא קבלום בפני ג' חבירים. ובל\"ז ג\"כ אין מקבלין גרי תושב רק בזמן שהיובל נוהג. אפ\"ה מדלא עשו מעשה עשו. יש להם חלעה\"ב [כע\"ז ד\"י]\"</p>\n<p>\"And if you wished to say that even these pious men that we mentioned above, though they kept the seven Noachide commandments, even then they aren't considered gerei toshav [Noachides], because they didn't take upon themselves these [commandments] before three Chaverim. And also, we do not accept gerei toshav except only when the Yovel is kept. Nevertheless, since they did not act in the way of Esau, they have a share in the world to come.\"<sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which begs the question, is \"the way of Esav\" a reference to Christianity or does it simply mean not doing immoral things?</p>\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avodah_Zarah.10b.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 10a</a> (which is what the Tiferet Yisrael is basing himself on) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"On another occasion, Antoninus said to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: Will I enter the World-to-Come? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to him: Yes. Antoninus said to him: But isn’t it written: “And there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau” (Obadiah 1:18)? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi answered: The verse is stated with regard to those who perform actions similar to those of the wicked Esau, not to people like you.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here it seems that \"the way of Esav\" means simply doing immoral things. Those non-Jews who do not follow the way of Esav - being immoral - and do great things instead (the flipside) will receive a share in The-World-To-Come (just like Antoninus).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Thank you to @JoelK for assisting with the translation.</p>\n\n\n",

It gets complicated.</p>\n<p>The state of Israel accepts Jewishness from both sides of the family. The Law of Return covers Jews of all types. If your father or grandfather was Jewish, you would be eligible for Aliyah regardless of whether your status is halachally valid.

This addition not only ensured that\nfamilies would not be broken apart, but also promised a safe haven in\nIsrael for non-Jews subject to persecution because of their Jewish\nroots.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The state simply requires evidence that your family is Jewish. This\ncan be evidence of affiliation with a specific Jewish community, a\nbar/bat mitzvah, a death certificate or marriage certificate of\nparents/grandparents which shows Jewishness, even a certified letter\nfrom a Rabbi who has vetted your claim and verified your family\nhistory as valid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbn.org.il/aliyahpedia/aliyah-process/aliyah-processing-flight-logistics/documentation-requirements-aliyah-from-within-israel/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>There are websites which list the required materials you would need.</strong></a></p>\n<p>Conversion is only necessary if you have no family history of Jewishness or if you seek to claim Jewish status once you have arrived in Israel. Israel operates under a \"confessional\" system which means that the state itself does not marry people through secular ceremonies.

When I said that the political situation in Israel is complicated, this is what I mean. Certain conversions are not formally recognized. The Rabbinate actually has a blacklist of Rabbis who they don't recognize conversions from but they do not make this list public. If you contact an organization which works with converts who make Aliyah, they will likely have some names they can pass your way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/reform-masorti-refuse-further-delays-on-high-court-conversion-ruling-635604\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Besides that, there is currently a court ruling coming up which would force the state to decide whether Reform and Conservative conversions performed within the state are as valid.</strong></a> This ruling is actually decades in the making and may have an impact on your plans depending on how you choose to convert.</p>\n<p>You have to make sure that you do your homework when you look for a Jewish community to convert into.

    "title": "Definiton of Selicha in Tanakh vs. Rabbinic Interpretation",
    "content": "# Definiton of Selicha in Tanakh vs. Rabbinic Interpretation\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As is par for the course this time of year I'm thinking a lot about the idea of \"selicha\", coming right off the tails of Yom Kippur and selichot. I'm conflicted about the idea of forgiveness/atonement as it's explained in the Talmud (that it wipes away sins and could even become a <em>mitzvah</em>) as I'm not sure if I even see that as an ideal. But I'm even more curious about the actual definition of the word סלח as it's used in prayer/Talmud vs. in Tanakh. A lot of the text and ideas of \"atonement\" in prayer come from 2 main sources:</p>\n<p>(1) The Golden Calf - this is the source for <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">וַיַּעֲבֹ֨ר יְהוָ֥ה ׀ עַל־פָּנָיו֮ וַיִּקְרָא֒</a>  (including the use of the 13 Attributes of Faith in prayer)</p>\n<p>(2) The spies -- this is the source for <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.14.20?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֔ה סָלַ֖חְתִּי כִּדְבָרֶֽךָ׃</a></p>\n<p>However, if we look at these stories we see that in the Golden Calf, the version of \"forgiveness\" that God gives the Jews who sinned with the Golden Calf is simply that He doesn't wipe out the Jewish people and start anew with Moshe. However, this comes <em>after</em> Moshe had already had 3000 people killed for sinning against God (See: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.26?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 32:26</a>). This isn't some beautiful \"forgiveness\" as we want to think of it. This is after taking retribution, God not killing everybody.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in the story of the spies, God's \"forgiveness\" that he refers to in \"salachti\" is that He doesn't kill every Jew. Rather, He wipes them out slowly but surely in the desert over 40 years and nobody can enter the land of Israel.</p>\n<p>This stands in stark contrast to the vision of \"forgiveness\" that is discussed in the Talmud, and to my mind, that we teach in school: this idea and vision that forgiveness is to literally expunge the \"sin\" from your record.</p>\n<p>I'm wondering if maybe this version of forgiveness maybe comes from a mistranslation of the word סלח. Further, I'm wondering if perhaps (and this is kind of a stretch, but hence why I'm asking the all-knowing Internet) if words in Tanakh maybe had much less \"internal\" meaning than we think of nowadays. That is, maybe the word סלח means \"lessen your punishment\" and similarly, חשב\nmeans \"to act in accordance with\". I'm just spitballing here and I don't actually have evidence for this claim -- but would be curious what people think about this.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\n\n\n",

I put the specific parts in bold, to separate the assertions from the proofs Rabbeinu Yonah provides. Basically, he says that it is not possible to read the verse as questioning whether humans souls ascend to heaven because King Solomon wrote in Koheles that they do. Similarly, King Solomon would know that it is impossible for an animal's soul to ascend to heaven. Therefore the verse must be referring to people's souls, and the souls of the wicked are <em>compared</em> and referred to as animal souls because they follow their carnal desires like animals, and the verse is pointing out that it is often difficult to tell who is really righteous and who isn't.</p>\n<p>So yes, Rabbeinu Yonah is not following the literal interpretation of the verse, because he considers it nonsensical. He explains this after he gives what in his opinion is the true meaning of the verse.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועוד נאמר (קהלת ג׳:כ״א) מי יודע רוח בני האדם העולה היא למעלה ורוח הבהמה היורדת היא למטה לארץ. פירוש מי יכיר הצדיקים והרשעים בעוה\"ז. כי יש רשעים אשר מעשיהם במחשך ולא יכירו בהם בנ\"א [ויש צדיקים] שייראו שמים בסתר. כענין שנאמר (מיכה ו׳:ח׳) והצנע לכת. <strong>ויקרא לנפש הרשע נפש הבהמה מפני שנמשכת אחרי התאוה הגשמית כבהמה וכענין שכתוב (יונה ד׳:י״א) אשר לא ידע בין ימינו לשמאלו ובהמה רבה. ולנפש הצדיקים קרא רוח בני האדם וכענין שנאמר (יחזקאל ל\"ד:ל\"א) אדם אתם. וביאור לשון המקרא כן הוא. מי יודע רוח בני האדם והם הצדיקים. העולה היא למעלה</strong> כי יש הרבה צדיקים שאין אדם יכול לגזור עליהם בעולם הזה שהם צדיקים באמת וכי תעלה נפשם למרום. כענין מה שנאמר (ש\"א ט\"ז:ז') כי האדם יראה לעינים וה' יראה ללבב. וגם כי רבים מן הצדיקים הם יראי שמים בסתר ואין צדקתם מודעת. וכענין שנאמר (מיכה ו׳:ח׳) והצנע לכת עם אלהיך. <strong>ורוח הבהמה וגו' גם יש רשעים רבים שאין אדם מכיר במעשיהם כענין שנאמר (ישעיהו כ״ט:ט״ו) והיה במחשך מעשיהם ויאמרו מי רואנו ומי יודענו. וכן פירשו ז\"ל במדרש קהלת. כי רוח בני האדם אלו הצדיקים ורוח הבהמה אלו הרשעים.\nולא יוכל איש לומר כי היה מסתפק על נשמת האדם אם תעלה למעלה כי הנה כתוב (קהלת י״ב:ז׳) והרוח תשוב אל האלהים אשר נתנה. ועוד איך יסתפק על רוח הבהמה אם יורדת למטה הלא רוח הבהמה מן הארץ ואיך תעלה.</strong> ונתבאר בתורה כי נשמת האדם עליונית. כי כתוב על נפש הבהמה כי היא מן הארץ שנאמר (בראשית א׳:כ״ד) תוצא הארץ נפש חיה למינה. ועל נפש האדם כתוב (שם ב') ויפח באפיו נשמת חיים. על כן תעלה נשמת האדם במות הגוף למעלה כי כל הדברים שבים אל שרשם. כענין שנאמר (קהלת י״ב:ז׳) וישוב העפר על הארץ כשהיה והרוח תשוב אל האלהים אשר נתנה. ונאמר על נשמת הצדיקים (זכריה ג׳:ז׳) ונתתי לך מהלכים בין העומדים האלה פירושו - בין המלאכים שהם עומדים וקיימים. כמו שנאמר (תהילים קמ״ח:ו׳) ויעמידם לעד לעולם ונאמר (דניאל ז׳:ט״ז) קרבת עד חד מן קאמיא. ואמרו ז\"ל נפשותיהן של צדיקים גנוזות תחת כסא הכבוד שנאמר (שמואל א כ״ה:כ״ט) והיתה נפש אדוני צרורה בצרור החיים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rb Elya Lopian explains (Lev Eliyahu) that the passuk means that if someone was attracted to animal-like pleasures in this world, then just as the soul of an animal remains in this world after the animal's death, so too will the soul of that person sink down to this world after his death, and they will be unable to rise.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, someone who was attracted to the elevated, will (i.e. their soul) rise to shamayim after their death (they will naturally levitate to shamayim which is a place of taanug ruchni).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16464/showrashi/true#v21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Koheles 3:21</a> explains that it does not mean as you seem to imply that we do not know if man is superior to animals or not.

For those wondering what potential issues there might be, and angles for leniency, @Alex posted that <strong>Rav Aryeh Lebowitz</strong> <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/885926\" rel=\"noreferrer\">has a lecture</a> on this exact topic. He discussed the issue with <strong>Rav Herschel Schachter</strong>, and provided four potential issues, and why they're okay.</p>\n<p>The following is just a summary of what he said, and not necessarily an implicit agreement to the arguments provided:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong><em>Lifnei Iver</em> - Causing another Jew to stumble</strong>. This isn't an issue as it's only a Torah prohibition if the Jew couldn't commit the transgression without you. It's very likely someone else will deliver the food if you don't. There is however a Rabbinic prohibition anyways. Here it would be fine, as the <strong>Shach</strong> holds there's no Rabbinic prohibition if the Jew doesn't observe any <em>mitzvos</em> whatsoever. We can assume someone ordering non-kosher food isn't a <em>frum</em> Jew with a momentary lapse in observance. Rather, it must be someone, even if Jewish, who isn't observant.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><em>Mar'is Ayin</em> - Doing something that looks prohibited</strong>. Walking into a non-kosher establishment could look  like  you're eating the food there. This isn't a problem nowadays because people would assume you're using the bathroom or getting a drink. Coming out of the store also looks bad, as people see you have their merchandise. However, if you look like a delivery person (you have an uniform/badge/hat that says so, or the establishment clearly displays they use food delivery apps) people won't assume you bought it for yourself.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Business activities with prohibited foods</strong>. There's a prohibition (debated if Biblical or Rabbinic) against conducting business with prohibited foods. <strong>Rav Herschel Schachter</strong> said that delivering food that isn't kosher isn't considered conducting business. The restaurant is; you're just transporting it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Getting <em>any</em> benefit from milk and meat</strong>. This is the biggest issue, as the <em>Mishnah</em> in <em>Avodah Zara</em> explicitly prohibits receiving pay to deliver idolatrous wine, as it's something from which benefit is prohibited. The same should be true here, as milk and meat is also prohibited from benefit. First he suggested maybe it's not Biblically prohibited milk and meat, as the meat wasn't slaughtered properly (<em>neveilah</em>). Rabbinically prohibited milk and meat is permissible to benefit from (<strong>Shulchan Aruch</strong> <em>Yoreh Deah</em> 87:3; <strong>Rema</strong> <em>ad. loc.</em> § 1). However, he said the <em>halacha</em> is that even <em>neveilah</em> cooked with milk is prohibited from benefit. Then he suggested that a cheeseburger isn't milk and meat cooked together, as the meat is cooked separately. However, since the meat is probably hot when they put the cheese on it (and it's a <em>davar gush</em>), it's halachically considered cooked together. Also, steak cooked with butter would obviously be an issue. Nevertheless, <strong>Rav Herschel Schacter</strong> said here it is permitted, as this isn't considered getting paid to deliver milk and meat. You're being paid for delivering the order. No matter what's in the order, you're paid the same amount. Whether it's a $1000 order or a $5 order. So it's not called benefiting from milk and meat.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>He concluded that there really should be other job opportunities out there. This isn't necessarily the best job for a <em>frum</em> Jew to take, but would be permissible if necessary.</p>\n\n\n",

Abdimi from Haifa said: Since the day when the Temple was destroyed, prophecy has been taken from the prophets and given to the wise. Is then a wise man not also a prophet?— What he meant was this: Although it has been taken from the prophets, it has not been taken from the wise. Amemar said: A wise man is even superior to a prophet, as it says, And a prophet has a heart of wisdom. Who is compared with whom? Is not the smaller compared with the greater? Abaye said: The proof [that prophecy has not been taken from the wise] is that a great man makes a statement, and the same is then reported in the name of another great man. Said Raba: What is there strange in this? Perhaps both were born under one star. No, said Raba; the proof is this, that a great man makes a statement and then the same is reported in the name of R. Akiba b. Joseph. Said R. Ashi: What is there strange in this? perhaps in this matter he was born under the same star. No, said R. Ashi; the proof is that a great man makes a statement and then it is found that the same rule was a halachah communicated to Moses at Mount Sinai. But perhaps the wise man was no better than a blind man groping his way through a window? — And does he not give reasons [for his opinions]?</p>\n<p>R. Johanan said: Since the Temple was destroyed, prophecy has been taken from prophets and given to fools and children. How given to fools? — The case of Mar son of R. Ashi will illustrate. He was one day standing in the manor of Mahuza when he heard a certain lunatic exclaim: The man who is to be elected head of the Academy in Matha Mehasia signs his name Tabiumi. He said to himself: Who among the Rabbis signs his name Tabiumi? I do. This seems to show that my lucky time has come. So he quickly went to Matha Mehasia. When he arrived, he found that the Rabbis had voted to appoint R. Aha of Difti as their head. When they heard of his arrival, they sent a couple of Rabbis to him to consult him. He detained them with him, and they sent another couple of Rabbis. He detained these also, [and so it went on] until the number reached ten. When ten were assembled, he began to discourse and expound the Oral Law and the Scriptures, [having waited so long] because a public discourse7   [on them] should not be commenced if the audience is less than ten. R. Aha applied to himself the saying: If a man is in disfavour [with Heaven] he does not readily come into favour, and if a man is in favour he does not readily fall into disfavour.</p>\n<p>How has prophecy been given to children? A case in point is that of the daughter of R. Hisda. She was sitting on her father's lap, and in front of him were sitting Raba and Rami b. Hama. He said to her: Which of them would you like? She replied: Both. Whereupon Raba said: And let me be the second.</p>\n<p>(Bava Batra 12a-12b, Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the original meaning of the Hebrew word שְׁכִינָה?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While שְׁכִינָה doesn't occur in the תנ״ך, the verb of its root שָׁכַן does, as well as שֵׁ֫כֶן … n.m. <em>dwelling</em> [physical structure]; שָׁכֵן … adj. <em>inhabitant, neighbor</em>; מִשְׁכָּן … <em>dwelling-place, ‘tabernacle’</em>.  שְׁכִינָה is ususally associated with כְּבוֹד־יְהוָה֙.  The one instance in the תנ״ך that כְּבוֹד־יְהוָה֙ is the subject of a verb form of שָׁכַן is Exodus 24:16 (וַיִּשְׁכֹּ֤ן כְּבוֹד־יְהוָה֙) in the context of Moses receiving the Law at Sinai.  שָׁכַן is indirectly associated with כְּבוֹד־יְהוָה֙ in Exodus 40:35\n(שָׁכַ֥ן עָלָ֖יו הֶעָנָ֑ן וּכְב֣וֹד יְהוָ֔ה מָלֵ֖א אֶת־הַמִּשְׁכָּֽן) context of the Tabernacle, with parallel clauses.  In 1 Kings 8:11–12 כְּבוֹד־יְהוָה֙ and שָׁכֵן are in adjacent verses, but apparently have no close association (context of the Temple in Jerusalem).</p>\n<p>Thus, the original meaning of שְׁכִינָה appears to relate to Moses and the Law.  While שְׁכִינָה has been interpreted as associated with כְּבוֹד־יְהוָה֙ elsewhere in the תנ״ך, the Glory of the LORD  כְּבוֹד־יְהוָה֙ is usually with verbs meaning <em>filled</em> or <em>appeared</em>.</p>\n<p>Given the context, שְׁכִינָה appears to be feminine because it is an abstract noun meaning <em>dwelling</em>.  In other words the meaning is not a concrete object such as a dwelling place or person dwelling.  It is characteristic of an action of the כְּבוֹד־יְהוָה֙.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract nouns [non-concrete things] are [often] morphologically feminine.

One counterexample that comes to mind is רָצוֹן, meaning \"desire\". And in Hebrew, as in English, it's very common for the same noun to have both abstract and concrete senses. For example, בִּנְיָן, like English <em>building</em>, can mean either \"the act of building\" or \"a building\". (Admittedly, only the latter sense is found in the Bible; but the former sense is found in the Mishna — like שְׁכִינָה — so it's still quite ancient.)</p>\n<p>You're right that שְׁכִינָה is formed as the action noun (≈gerund) of the verb שָׁכַן (meaning \"to dwell\"), so if you're going strictly by its construction, its meaning would be \"the act of dwelling\".</p>\n<p>But I'm not sure it makes sense to try to derive the meaning strictly from its construction; I'm not aware of שְׁכִינָה ever actually being <em>used</em> in reference to anyone's act of dwelling besides G-d's. The 1984 edition of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even-Shoshan_Dictionary\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the <em>Even-Shoshan Dictionary</em></a> lists only the one sense, explaining that it derives from the use of Exodus 25:8\n(וְעָשׂוּ לִי מִקְדָּשׁ וְ<strong>שָׁכַנְתִּי</strong> בְּתוֹכָם, \"And let them make me a sanctuary; that <strong>I may dwell</strong> among them\").</p>\n\n\n",

He went to Berlin, where he studied in the Beit Midrash for rabbis. He learned chemistry in the University of Berlin in order to be able to work in the Dead Sea Works. In 5687 (1927), the Ordang family made aliyah to Eretz Yisrael. <strong>His parents and his brother Tuvia, who studied agronomy, settled in Chadeira.

However, apart from one possible reference in 2 Chron 23:6 (when Joash is made king and a distinction is made between 'the priests and the ministering Levites' who enter the temple - although this could be a reference to the temple courts - v13), there seems to be no references to the Levites serving within the temple building itself.

Ovadia Yosef) took a more lenient approach in practice.</p>\n<p>• Rav Yosef Tzvi Rimon recommends the following halachic guidelines when it comes to wine poured or touched by non-observant Jews:-\n(i) The main thrust of the poskim is to be stringent.\n(ii) One can be lenient with pasteurized wine which is not fully cooked.\n(iii) One can be lenient with the wine that is left in the bottle.\n(iv) One can be lenient if the bottle is simply opened and not poured.\n(v) There are grounds to be strict and not to drink the wine poured by a non-observant Jew, but in cases of need, especially where\noffence could be caused, one can be lenient given the many grounds for leniency with today’s mechalelei Shabbat.</p>\n<p>• Many poskim would urge leniency when it comes to family members who could be deeply offended.</p>\n<p>• Almost all major poskim permit wine poured by non-observant Jews who DO keep Shabbat (at least publicly), but who are non-observant in other areas.</p>\n\n\n",

It's also not even talking about a sukkah that you sit in during Sukkos.</p>\n<p>Let's see the verse which precedes this one (Chabad translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּבָרָ֣א יְהֹוָ֡ה עַל֩ כָּל־מְכ֨וֹן הַר־צִיּ֜וֹן וְעַל־מִקְרָאֶ֗הָ <strong>עָנָ֚ן | יוֹמָם֙</strong> וְעָשָׁ֔ן וְנֹ֛גַהּ אֵ֥שׁ לֶֽהָבָ֖ה לָ֑יְלָה כִּ֥י עַל־כָּל־כָּב֖וֹד חֻפָּֽה:</p>\n<p>And the Lord shall create over every dwelling of Mount Zion and over all those summoned therein, <strong>a cloud by day</strong> and smoke, and splendor of a flaming fire at night, for, in addition to every honor, there will be a shelter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it's discussing that Hashem will create a cloud for shelter.</p>\n<p>Then it immediately starts discussing a sukkah that will protect. A sukkah is literally a covering, and in context the verse would seem to be referring to this cloud as a sukkah. This cloud will protect them from storm and rain. The <strong>Rashash</strong> (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37956&st=&pgnum=786\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">end of Sukkah 2a</a>) says this is the simplest understanding of the verse.</p>\n<p>Even if you disagree that the verse isn't talking about the cloud, it's not perforce that it's telling you anything about a <em>halachic</em> sukkah. While there <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.2a.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">is an opinion</a> in the <em>gemarra</em> that it is, this would seem to be on the level of <em>derash</em>, not <em>peshat</em>. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.2b.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">those that disagree with him there</a> say the verse is talking about a Messianic sukkah (as is clear from the context), not a <em>halachic</em> sukkah. Just because that sukkah will protect from storm and rain, you don't see anything about the sukkos we sit in today.</p>\n<p>The <em>gemarra</em> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.75a.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra</a> even says that in the future Hashem will make a <em>sukkah</em> with <em>sechach</em> from the hide of the <em>Leviasan</em>. I don't have a source but perhaps it's the same <em>sukkah</em> as your verse. It's <a href=\"https://daf-yomi.com/Data/UploadedFiles/DY_Item/26102-sFile.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">not so simple</a> that that <em>sukkah</em> will be kosher for Sukkos...so again we see Messianic sukkos aren't relevant to today.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ritva_on_Sukkah.2a.11?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ritva</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי זירא אמר מהכ׳‎ וסוכ׳‎ תהיה לצל יומם. הקשו בתוספות א״כ נילף מהת׳‎ נמי דבעי סוכ׳‎ ראויה להיות מחסה ומסתור מזרם וממטר ולאו מלתא דהא בקרא נקיט ב׳‎ לישני צל סוכה ומחסה מזרם ומסתור ממטר וכיון דמיחד צל לסוכה שמעי׳‎ אגב אורחיה דלא איקרי סכך אלא בשראוי לצל. ותו דלישנ׳‎ יתירא דייקינן דהול״ל וסוכה תהיה יומם מחורב כלומר שהסוכ׳‎ סוככ׳‎ יום מחורב כדכתיב בעלמא לא ימוש עמוד הענן יומם שפירש ביום ולמה ליה למימר תהיה לצל אלא ודאי אגב אורחיה קמ״ל שאין סוכה אלא הראויה לצל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>on Succah 2a that even according to the opinion that we do compare this to the Succah we use on Succos, the comparison to a Succah like the one we use on Succos is only from the first part of the Passuk.

I saw some paper qoute the rema that one should get new aravos for the 7 days of sukkos because of hiddur. The 7 days are also rabbinic. My question is, if you understand the obligation of mitzvos diraban is because of lo tasur (don't stray from what they tell you) meaning it's a lo taseh, if so what does one gain by doing hidur? Even if you don't do hidur you still didn't go against what the rabbis said.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Sheilah_on_Sheiltot_d%27Rav_Achai_Gaon.26.11.1?lang=he&with=Sheiltot%20d%27Rav%20Achai%20Gaon&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Netziv</a> writes based on the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Blessings.11.3?lang=he&with=Benei%20Binyamin&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> that there is also a positive obligation to obey the Rabbis, from the beginning of the verse אשר יאמרו לך תעשה (that which [the Rabbis] say to you, do.) Otherwise, one would not be able to make a blessing on a Rabbinic mitzvah, as blessings are only said on positive commandments. Therefore, one can do a hiddur in fulfilling the positive commandment to listen to the Rabbis.</p>\n<p>A second approach can be based on a principle of Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (published in the sefer Tehillah l'Yonah to Maseches Megillah) that the commandment of Lo Sasur gives the Rabbis the authority to create commandments, even on people who are not obligated in other Mitzvos (like minors). So once the Rabbis create the mitzvah of lulav on all seven days, it could now also have hiddurim.</p>\n\n\n",

However, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/12817/1739\">this question</a> asks why Reuven was considered culpable, when the verse attests that he tried to save Yosef.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Zohar Chadash</strong> (brought in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12821/1739\">this answer</a>) explains that Reuven was indeed innocent, and was reincarnated into Rabbi Eliezer HaGadol. The latter was only imprisoned by the Romans, but indeed wasn't killed. The answer there implied that there weren't really Ten Martyrs, but Nine, and the Tenth was merely imprisoned.</p>\n<p>However, we have a list of the Ten who were killed.

The Rema (Orach Chayim 234:1) says that it's a good minhag:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש שכתבו שנהגו לומר פרשת קודם אשרי של תפילת המנחה נגד תמיד של בין הערביים ומנהג יפה הוא</p>\n<p>There are those who wrote that it was customary to say the parashat Hatamid before Ashrei of mincha, equivalent to the afternoon Korban Tamid, and this is a good minhag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The language of 'Minhag' is also used by the Shulchan Aruch when he says to say it at shacharis)</p>\n<p>However, the mishna brura does say on this seif:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ט\"ז ומ\"א כתבו לומר אחר אשרי אבל אין המנהג כן\nThe Ta\"z and Magen Avraham write to say it after Ashrei (of mincha), but this is not the minhag</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which seems to show that it wasn't a very widespread minhag, otherwise there would presumably be a consensus on when it should be said. (Though this is definitely debatable.)</p>\n<p>However, a reason why saying Parashat Hatamid in the morning may be more popular, is that the shulchan aruch says to say it (for example O\"Ch 1:9), and not 'just' the Rema. Another possible reason is what the Shulchan aruch says (50:1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קבעו לשנות אחרי פרשת התמיד פרק איזהו מקומן וברייתא דרבי ישמעאל כדי שיזכה כל אדם ללמוד בכל יום מקרא משנה וגמרא...\nThey set the learning of chapter 'Eizehu Mekoman' and the Braisa of Rebbi Yishmael after Parashat Hatamid, so that one may merit learning Pessukim, Mishna and Gemara...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since this reason, at least, is not applicable in the afternoon, it may be why people are less makpid.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is that some shuls say the morning brachos as part of shacharis, maybe to make sure that everyone says the brachos, and once they're already saying brachos, they might as well say 'everything else' between them and the beginning of shacharis, whereas at mincha there is nothing to say beforehand that would lead to also saying Parashat Hatamid.</p>\n\n\n",

The acharonim discusses what is behind Rashi and Tosfot opinion, the Kovetz Shiurim (Baba Batra 54) writes that according to Rashi, when a woman does a time-bonded mitzva is considered a \"maase mitzva\" (mitzva act), and according to Tosfot it is not, so that's why it also does not transgress Bal Tosif.</p>\n<p>Kovetz Shiurim in Pessachim piska 166 discusses if in order to transgress the issue of Bal Tossif when someones does a mitzva after its time, if it needs (besides intention to fulfill the mitzva**) only that the \"maase mitzva\" (act of the mitzva) be OK or if it needs that if one would do this in the proper time, he would fulfill the mitzva.</p>\n<p>So, according to Tosfot is clear that in the case you presented she does not transgress Bal Tosif [there is neither \"kium mitzva\" (fulfillment of the mitzva) nor \"maase mitzva\" (mitzva act)] , but according to Rashi (with Kovetz Shiurim understanding) it depends on discussion the Kovetz Shiurim brings up in Pessachim (last paragraph), since there is a perfect \"maase mitzva\" but if it would be in the proper time the mitzva would not be fulfilled since there is no \"kium mitzva\" (fulfillment of the mitzva).</p>\n<p>** If there is no intention to fulfill the mitzva, is only \"looks like Bal Tosif\", see Massechet Rosh Hashana daf 28 and (more explicitly) Korbal Netanel on the Rosh on Sukkah Perek 4 Siman 7.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is this case of double bal tosif, bal tosif?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are two definitions of Bal Tosif:</p>\n<p>1 - Do the mitzva with a change in its form (for example: getting a 5th species along with the Four Species)</p>\n<p>2 - Do the mitzva with intention when it's not its time (for example: Doing Netilat Lulav after Sukot with intention of fulfilling the mitzva of the Four Species).</p>\n<p><strong>My question is:</strong> If someone does Netilat Lulav with a 5th species AFTER Sukkot (combining the two definitions above), does one transgress the issur of Bal Tosif?</p>\n<p>Please use sources.</p>\n<p>I am posting my initial thoughts on the subject as an answer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berura in 664:22 when discussing adding the Hoshanos to the lulav and shaking them together, says that outside the zman of the mitzvah there is no bal tosif if you don’t have specific kavvanah for the mitzvah. By inference, if you do have that intention, then there is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הטעם דהא קי\"ל דשלא בזמנו של המצוה אינו עובר על בל תוסיף עד שיכוין להוסיף על המצוה והכא כיון שעברה מצותו הוי שלא בזמנו והוא הלא לא כיון להוסיף על מצות לולב כ\"א בשביל לקיחת הערבה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, in the Biur Halacha 651:12 he brings a machlokes about it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל נוטלן לזכר בעלמא - וצריך ליזהר שלא יכוין לשם מצוה דיש בזה משום בל תגרע כמו שכתב הט\"ז בסקי\"ז ובאמת כן הוא מפורש בהדיא בספרי ראה עי\"ש. אכן מה שכתב הט\"ז דבר חדש דאפילו בעת שהוא נוטלו להלולב אחר שכבר קיים המצוה ורק משום חבוב מצוה בעלמא גם אז יזהר ליקח דוקא כל הד' מינים שלא לגרוע ממנו ולא להוסיף עליו כדי שלא יעבור על בל תוסיף ובל תגרע השיגו עליו כל האחרונים [הא\"ר והחמד משה והנהר שלום ומטה יהודא] ודעתם כיון שכבר קיים המצוה אין שייך בזה בל תוסיף ובל תגרע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I though about this for a while based on Kovetz Shiurim on Pessachim Piska 54 and Kovetz Shiurim Chelek 2 Siman 33, where he discussed if in order to transgress Bal Tosif while is not the time for the mitzva, if one needs only to do the act of the mitzva (<em>maase mitzva</em>) or it needs that if it would be in the proper time, the mitzva would be fulfilled, he discussed it about doing Bal Tosif + Mitzvat Haba beAveira.</p>\n<p>At the end I came to this conclusion that it depends whether Bal Tosif is an issur/defect on the <em>cheftza</em> (object) or on the <em>gavra</em> (person). If is in the <em>cheftza</em> (object), so there is not even a <em>maase mitzva</em> (mitzva act) to be considered now that he does it not in the proper time, therefore he does not transgress, if is in the <em>gavra</em> (person), so there is no problem in the <em>maase mitzva</em> (act), so when one does it not in the proper time, there is not much of a difference and the problem is only the Bal Tosif itself, which he transgresses.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Internet Bavli resource\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am hoping (<em>b'li neder</em>) to start, relatively soon, a regular regimen of study of the <em>Talmud Bavli</em>.  My goal is to learn large swaths of the <em>g'mara</em>, gaining broad knowledge, but without taking the time to go deeply into it, so I'll probably stick to <em>Rashi</em> as commentator for the most part.  Unfortunately, I will probably need to do this alone, without a <em>chavrusa</em>, and I'm worried — indeed I'm sure — that I'm going to get stuck at certain points. Having an ArtScroll <em>g'mara</em> at hand would be helpful at such times, but I don't want to buy every volume of the ArtScroll <em>g'mara</em> — I mention this just so you can get an idea, if you're familiar with the ArtScroll <em>g'mara</em>, of the kind of resource I seek. Can anyone recommend a <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free_as_in_beer\" rel=\"noreferrer\">free</a> Internet resource that explains the <em>g'mara</em> clearly and fully, and that allows me to find a section or line of <em>g'mara</em> easily?

For example, if we take the option of Berachos <a href=\"https://dafyomi.co.il/gemara.php?gid=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, it gives you the option to see a full review, explore insights on the daf, view English charts, tosafos, Q&A's etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dafdigest.org/archives.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daf Digest</a> - Provides really good overviews of each daf as well as some deeper thoughts on some select pieces, including a 'halacha highlight' and 'stories from the daf'</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steinsaltz.org/tractate-archive/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Steinsaltz Center</a> - Provide a daf by daf selection with a clear and succinct overview of the prevalent theme on each daf.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dafnotes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daf Notes</a> - Provides clear summaries and more</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alldaf.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">All Daf</a> - Made up of predominantly video and audio which I know you said you wanted to avoid, but there is also an invaluable series of 'reference materials' provided as well including daf review, daf insights, quizzes, halacha outlines etc.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>I recently discovered <a href=\"https://www.shasilluminated.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shas Illuminated</a> which while not having a line-by-line breakdown and daf navigation like some of the other sites I listed, nevertheless provides numerous shiurim on that day's daf as well notes on the daf too which I find brings a great deal of clarity to the given sugya (for example <a href=\"https://www.shasilluminated.org/magidei-shiur/rabbi-ari-keilsons-daf-notes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). There is a tremendous list of <a href=\"https://www.shasilluminated.org/magidei-shiur?type=all-magidei-shiur\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">maggidei shiur</a> available and has several high-profile <a href=\"https://www.shasilluminated.org/haskamos\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">haskomos</a></p>\n<p>Finally, and thanks to @rosends there is also <a href=\"https://themercava.com/app/books/metanav/1695\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mercava</a> which gives you complete control over the daf (including Rashi and Tosafos) with not only translation but also a breakdown of the text detailing if the words are a statement, proof, attack, defence, question and answer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Besides Dov's impressive list, I highly recommend <a href=\"http://dafhachaim.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daf HaChaim</a>.

It's mostly <em>kabbalistic</em>, so it's beyond my comprehension. However, I'll share one piece which is interesting.

However, the Aravos also represents Moshe and Ahron . The Arava also represents the potential in every Jew to grow,unlike the other species which can point to their past accomplishments.  Therefore, Rabbi Breitwoitz explains that the Arvos sits under the Kisei Hakavod because it represents the humble Jew who does not feel entitled and has fear of HaShem. This type of person is considered close to HaShem.</p>\n<p>I would add my own idea that the arava is extremely reliant on water to flourish and not dry up. Metaphorically water represents Torah and the arava represnts a person who is thirsting for Torah ,such a person is closest to the source.</p>\n\n\n",

I cut off one corner of the purple-blue shawl  of one of them; and we could not move away. He said unto me: '[If] you have, peradventure, taken something from them, return it; for we have a tradition that he who takes anything from them cannot move away.' I went and returned it; and then we were able to move away. When I came before the Rabbis they said unto me: Every Abba  is an ass and every Bar Bar Hana is a fool. For what purpose did you do that?

On-site, the altar and other cultish/idolatrous artifacts were found buried under the mortar floor of what was the second level of the Motza site (identified with what is known scientifically as \"Iron Age II 2\"; the temple being from the earlier \"Iron Age II 1\").</p>\n<p>This suggests that all these objects were buried on purpose, most likely by the men of one of the previously mentioned kings, who are described as putting an end to the bamot (this site is essentially a fancy bamah).</p>\n<p>On Chizkiyahu it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He abolished the shrines and smashed the pillars and cut down the sacred post. He also broke into pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until that time the Israelites had been offering sacrifices to it; it was called Nehushtan.

He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and he removed the ashes to Bethel.\nHe suppressed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to make offerings at the shrines in the towns of Judah and in the environs of Jerusalem, and those who made offerings to Baal, to the sun and moon and constellations—all the host of heaven.\nHe brought out the [image of] Asherah from the House of the LORD to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem, and burned it in the Kidron Valley; he beat it to dust and scattered its dust over the burial ground of the common people.\nHe tore down the cubicles of the male prostitutes in the House of the LORD, at the place where the women wove coverings for Asherah.\nHe brought all the priests from the towns of Judah [to Jerusalem] and defiled the shrines where the priests had been making offerings—from Geba to Beer-sheba. He also demolished the shrines of the gates, which were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the city prefect—which were on a person’s left [as he entered] the city gate...And the king tore down the altars made by the kings of Judah on the roof by the upper chamber of Ahaz, and the altars made by Manasseh in the two courts of the House of the LORD. He removed them quickly from there and scattered their rubble in the Kidron Valley.\nThe king also defiled the shrines facing Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of the Destroyer, which King Solomon of Israel had built for Ashtoreth, the abomination of the Sidonians, for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom, the detestable thing of the Ammonites.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.23.4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 2:23:4-13</a>)<sup>2</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Presumably, this temple was included in one of the groups of sites decimated during either one of these periods.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>Other than an explanation for why the idolatrous objects were buried, the rest of this temple also, apparently, fits well with tradition in that its architectural design is very similar to the description of the Bayit Rishon in the Tanach.

It seems that even the observance of Shabbat, months and holidays was acceptable, even though the harsh rebukes show that they weren't always observed properly. So too the strict observance on burial outside of the city and the staying away from the deceased made the Israelite citizens of the land unique. Therefore, it seems that the Jewish foundations of the cultic worship were preserved and even accepted by the different groups of the Judean and Israelite populace, but from the POV of the Bible, the idolatry and the social corruptness that came with the idol worship were what cast the judgement of the Israelite and Judean society.\"</p>\n<p>On a bit of a more drashic interpretation, considering that it seems that even while worshipping idols, the Jews kept some if not most other Torah-based practices, the comparison of Am Yisrael to a cheating wife by the nevi'im makes even more sense now: Am Yisrael were two-timing, just like a cheating wife - worshipping both Hashem, according to halacha, and those other deities, according to the practices of those types of idol worship.</p>\n<p>Note: I just heard a <a href=\"https://www.torahinmotion.org/podcast/tanach-and-archeology-modern-finds-in-an-ancient-land-part-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lecture</a> by Shulie Mishkin, where she talked about, among other things, a Judean temple found in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khirbet_Qeiyafa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Khirbet Kayaafah</a>. The archeologist who discovered it, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Garfinkel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yosef Garfinkel</a>, thought the city may be the Tanachic Sha'arayim, a stronghold city on the Israeli/Plishti border and that the temple was a model for Bayit Rishon! While some of the other archeologists disagree, if Garfinkel's view is correct, then perhaps that is the origin of the Motza temple: a model for Bayit Rishon (and not the other way around, that it was modeled after Bayit Rishon) that eventually became a place of idolatry.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n<p>I went Thursday before last with other archeology students and one of the BIU archeology professors, Prof. Aren Maeir, to Tel Lachish. He mentioned there that the Motza temple is most likely evidence for the religious reform of Chizkiyahu's time and not Yoshiyahu's (this is probably based on the dating of the layers and various finds). Evidence for Chizkiyahu's reform may also be found there in Lachish, where one of the city gates' rooms was excavated and discovered to have held an altar upon which a chamber-pot-stone had been placed. Note: I asked, and this is probably not evidence for a Baal Pe'or cultic site because the chamber-pot-stone was found buried over the cultic objects in the room, not in the same layer.

A small horse statue was found among the Motza temple artifacts. Just a guess on my part, but perhaps this statue was connected to that sun-worship.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/w6HF4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/w6HF4.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>(Picture from the <a href=\"http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_heb.aspx?sec_id=25&subj_id=240&id=1974\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">site</a> of the Israeli Antiquities Authority)</p>\n<p>According to Dr. David Shapira, the temple was built with the entrance facing the east, which is the direction facing the rising sun and brings to my mind the verse in Yechezkel about sun worship: \"Then He brought me into the inner court of the House of the LORD, and there, at the entrance to the Temple of the LORD, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men, their backs to the Temple of the LORD and their faces to the east; they were bowing low to the sun in the east.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.8.16?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:16</a>)</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> While to us it seems like this may have been a central idolatrous site because it was so big (and who knows, may have even been mentioned in one of the books not included in Tanach but mentioned there, such as Divrei Hayamim Lemalchei Yehudah), the fact that the Tanach doesn't refer to it specifically and, at least as far as we know, doesn't single it out among the sites destroyed, shows that in the long run, it wasn't quite as significant as it may appear to us, despite its size. Perhaps no significant events took place there and it was simply just another bamah along with many others.</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> This particular aspect of the discovery is most significant with relation to the old (but still widely popular) Biblical archeology minimalist-maximalist debate. Minimalists tend to view the majority of the Tanach as a combination of exaggerations, myths (often based on other cultures) and spiced with some facts. As such, the Tanach cannot be considered a reliable source of information when trying to understand ancient Israelite culture and various archeological discoveries. Maximalists are the opposite; tending to view the Tanach as written by authoratative figures who knew what they were talking about and were writing based on solid facts (interestingly, apparently both religious and secular people can be found on either side of the debate). With regards to Motza, for a long time minimalists have held that Bayit Rishon couldn't have been built in the time of Shlomo, only later because the Bayit architecture doesn't fit with the supposed architecture of that era. This building, built around the same time as the Bayit, is strong evidence that such a building was possible already at the time of Shlomo.</p>\n\n\n",

If one looks at the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.9?lang=bi&with=Sforno&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a> on the verse, this concept of knowledge is explored in two places.</p>\n<p>The pasuk reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּצְמַ֞ח ה' אֱלֹקים֙ מִן־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה כָּל־עֵ֛ץ נֶחְמָ֥ד לְמַרְאֶ֖ה וְט֣וֹב לְמַאֲכָ֑ל וְעֵ֤ץ הַֽחַיִּים֙ בְּת֣וֹךְ הַגָּ֔ן וְעֵ֕ץ הַדַּ֖עַת ט֥וֹב וָרָֽע׃</p>\n<p><em>And from the ground the LORD G-d caused to grow every tree that was pleasing to the sight and good for food, with the tree of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and bad.</em> (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Firstly, according to the Sforno, just looking at any of these special trees inspired greater knowledge i.e. it wasn't the job of the Eitz Hada'as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נחמד למראה, looking at these trees resulted In the viewer experiencing intellectual stimulation both of his heart and his brain. He would thus be capable of “digesting” the additional intellectual insights granted him by G’d. Compare Kings II 3,15 ותהי עליו יד ה', “Elisha had now been endowed by G-d’s generosity.” [a reference to the additional spiritual insights he had asked from his mentor Elijah prior to the latter ascending to heaven. Ed.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then writes next:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועץ הדעת, <strong>a tree whose fruit results in those who eat from it gaining greater understanding of the relationship of good and evil.</strong> The word דעת, which appears here for the first time, helps us understand Genesis 4,1 והאדם ידע את חוה אשתו. Without this verse we would have been puzzled by the Torah telling us something that was so obvious. Who does not “know” his wife, especially when he had described her as “bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh!” (2,23) <strong>In our verse we are told that the words ידע, דעת do not primarily refer to factual knowledge but to conceptual knowledge</strong>. This also helps us to understand why relatives, as in Ruth 2,1 are referred to as מודע לאישה, “someone whom her late husband had been intimate with, had been related to by blood.” It is normal for blood relations to be concerned with the physical and emotional needs of their kin. (compare Proverbs 17,17.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus the Eitz Hada'as, according to Sforno was to serve as a source of conceptual knowledge and not factual knowledge, namely an awareness to do the right thing and to be cognisant of the difference between good and evil.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm inquiring of the purpose of the actual beating of the aravot on Hoshanna Rabba - i.e., the action, itself. What does the hitting of the aravot represent or do and what is its connection to Hoshanna Rabba specifically?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to Rabbi Mansour, the purpose of beating the aravot against the ground is to beat the lips of the Satan such that he will be unable to testify against us in the coming year. The connection to Hoshanah Rabah is that on that day our final judgement is sealed. As he <a href=\"https://itorah.com/daily-halacha/lecture/the-misva-of-arabot-on-hoshana-rabba/2221\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>   \"The reason for this custom relates to the comment of the Midrash that the leaves of the Araba symbolize the lips. Specifically, the Arabot represent the lips of the Satan, and we bang them on the ground in order to silence the Satan so he does not prosecute against us. Hoshana Rabba is the day when our final judgment is sealed, and we therefore seek to silence the Satan in an effort to guarantee a favorable judgment. Furthermore, the Arizal (Rav Yishak Luria of Safed, 1534-1572) instructed that one should have in mind while banging the Arabot that the five beatings should correspond to the five letters in the Hebrew alphabet that appear only at the end of words (the final Kaf, the final Mem, the final Nun, the final Feh, and the final Sadi). These letters signify the Geburot – the harsh judgments in the world – and we bang the Arabot on the ground to express our desire to eliminate these judgments. The custom of the Arabot also commemorates the practice that was observed in the Bet Hamikdash to walk around the altar with an Araba on each day of Succot, and seven times on Hoshana Rabba. We commemorate this ritual by using Arabot on the day of Hoshana Rabba.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Shimshon Raphael Hirsch writes in Chorev <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22166&st=&pgnum=136&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (second paragraph) that after we have encircled the Bimah seven times we beat the Aravos as a means to remove any sense of Ga'avah (haughtiness / arrogance) from our hearts and the belief that our successes come from us alone. He says that the Aravah is symbolic of the 'chomer' lit. the material i.e. it is something that we receive from nature - it grows from the tree, wild and untreated, much like our natural abilities and talents. And with our human deficiencies, we wrongly assume that these talents are solely due to us. Therefore we specifically beat the Aravos to remind ourselves that everything is G-d given and beat out the natural arrogance that might express itself.</p>\n\n\n",

The Ascetic Woman (Ishah Perushah) p.107 - 141.</p>\n<p>The case is brought in Mishnah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sotah.3.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 3:4</a>, where the \"ascetic woman\" is a sexually abstinent woman. <em>Rabbi Yehoshua says: A woman desires to receive the amount of a kav of food and a sexual relationship [tiflut] rather than to receive nine kav of food and abstinence. He would say: A foolish man of piety, and a conniving wicked person, and <strong>an abstinent woman</strong> [<strong>perusha</strong>], and those who injure themselves out of false abstinence; <em>all these are people who erode the world</em>.</em></p>\n<p>The case is discussed in the baraisa. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.22a.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud Bavli Sotah 22a</a> gives an additional example of a praying virgin: <em>The Sages taught: <strong>A maiden who prays constantly</strong>, and a neighborly [shovavit] widow who constantly visits her neighbors, and a child whose months of gestation were not completed, all these are people who erode the world.</em></p>\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.3.4.13?vhe=The_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud Yerushalmi Sotah 3:4</a>: *They added to these (To the list of the destroyers of the world) <strong>a fasting virgin</strong> (vs. the Babli (22a): A praying virgin), <strong>a neighborly widow</strong>, ... <strong>A fasting virgin; she pretends to have lost her hymen by fasting</strong> (or fasting causes her lose her virginity; another comment: but in reality she slept around)... A neighborly widow, by running around (The Geniza ms. probably has another reading which, however, is not readable. The translation follows Arukh, s. v. חגל. she spreads bad reputations.)</p>\n<p>These descriptions complete the the portrait of an ascetic woman, condemned by tannaim as a destroyer of the world. The mishna wording of <em>isha</em> suggests that the ascetic woman may have been married but separated from her husband. The two baraisos add a virgin and a widow as further examples of the ascetic women. All different types of women are thus included in the tannaic condemnation of the female ascetic - a married woman, an unmarried virgin, and a widow.</p>\n<p>There is a further discussion in the book of various amoraic sources which relate extra piety as a cover for witchcraft, etc. It appears though, the criticism is directed towards women who <em>intentionally choose self-imposed religious stringency</em> because their behavior destroys the world: it leads to sin and destruction of families.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I can't speak for Kabbalah. But otherwise, I don't think there's anything specific about virginity per se.</p>\n<p>Talmud Chagiga 14b says Ben Azai got too close to knowing God for a mortal, and therefore died. The verse remarks about him: <em>when the pious die, it's costly to God.</em> Rashi comments -- that he died as a young man.</p>\n<p>So perhaps \"oh what a shame\", but that's about it.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein was asked about not naming after a relative who suffered from particular poor fate; he wrote that someone who had children and then died of natural causes in their 50s is not, in the overall scheme of things, considered to be \"an ill-fated relative.\" Of course does that mean that someone who lived to 110 and never married or had kids was \"ill-fated?\" I doubt it, but somehow having kids seems to weigh in to some degree.</p>\n\n\n",

With regard to a priest who cannot see due to pale spots on the eye or due to tears streaming from the eye that are constant, from where is it derived that he is disqualified? The same verse states: “A blind man [ish iver].” The superfluous word “ish” serves to include these conditions as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Eli was said to have had failing sight and eventually blindness in his final days:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"One day, Eli was asleep in his usual place; his eyes had begun to fail and he could barely see.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.3.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 1:3:2</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; his eyes were fixed in a blind stare.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.4.15?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 1:4:15</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is there any source that states that he stopped being acting Kohen Gadol at some point due to his blindness, or was he acting-Kohen Gadol<sup>1</sup> until his death?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> As opposed to kohanim who were considered inactive KGs, such as what Rabbi Meir says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.12b.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 12b</a>, or ex-KGs according to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.12b.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yossi</a>; kohanim that served even for a short time as KG, perhaps because the official KG had some kind of temporary blemish that disqualified him until it healed or rectified.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=39788#p=43&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daas Sofrim</a> on the first verse you cited says that indeed Eli wasn't able to serve as Kohen Gadol once he started going blind. So he says that Eli had expected that one of his sons would take over as Kohen Gadol, but then on that very same day (or rather, that night) Shmuel received his first prophecy, that Eli's sons wouldn't be worthy of that position, and indeed would die prematurely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>במשך כל הזמן הזה,‏ לא יכול היה לעבוד בעבודת המקדש,‏ כי כבר היה בעל מום ואף אם טרם נחשב בעל מום לא יכול היה לעבוד מפני שלא ראה היטיב, ואז צריכה היתה העבודה כולה לעבור לידי אחד מבניו,‏ שיהיה כהן גדול במקומו.‏ באותו יום באה הנבואה שאין בניו ראויים לכך והם ימותו לפני זמנם.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(He doesn't address, then, what happened during the years between this event and Eli's death. Possibly one of his sons served as acting Kohen Gadol, as in your footnote. Note that aside from the avodah of Yom Kippur, there's very little else in the Mishkan/Beis Hamikdash that has to be done specifically by the Kohen Gadol and can't be done by a regular kohen.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=39876#p=98&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kli Yakar</a> on this verse suggests that the verse in ch. 3 may not mean that Eli had actually started going blind, just that he had a sudden loss of vision (and indeed that this is what misled Shmuel to think that Eli was calling for him, in pain):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שלהיות שעלי שוכב במקומו ופתאום עיניו החלו כיהות לא יוכל לראות אשר זה היתה סבת טעות שמואל בקול הקורא היותו עלי צועק מכאב לבו ומיחוש עיניו דשורייני דעינא בלבא תלו.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this, then, it could conceivably have been a temporary condition, and once it cleared up, Eli would have been able to serve as Kohen Gadol for much longer (until at some (unrecorded) point he developed chronic vision problems).</p>\n\n\n",

If this was only an exception (not that I know it is an exception), why would this be an exception, as fighting Goliat would be as dangerous, if not the most dangerous thing he ever did?</p>\n<p>To familiarize oneself with the incident in question, the following miyodeya question might serve as a background information.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/50456/understanding-the-incident-with-goliat/\">Understanding the incident with Goliat</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I wrote an essay a couple of years ago that dealt, in part, with these questions.</p>\n<p>The answer to your first question is: Yes and no. David's military uniform depended on which weapon he was using in battle. David's favored weapon at this stage of his life was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_(weapon)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sling</a> (קלע, kelah in Hebrew). Not the rickety little slingshot that some prankster kids may play with, the sling was widely considered an incredibly deadly weapon.<sup>1</sup> Evidence for this comes from the fact that <a href=\"http://www.imperium-romana.org/uploads/5/9/3/3/5933147/scientificamerican1073-34.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ancient armies had units of elite, sharp-shooting \"slingers\"</a>, comparable to today's elite sniper units. Further evidence for this we can find in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.20.16?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 20:16</a>, in the description of the Tribe of Binyamin's army during the Battle at Giv'ah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"of all this force—700 picked men—were left-handed. Every one of them could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>700 men with that level of precision is a very deadly and powerful force.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>As for the sling-stone itself, here's what one looked like:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BlGfd.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BlGfd.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n(picture from this <a href=\"https://lukechandler.wordpress.com/2012/07/13/thats-not-a-sling-stone-this-is-a-sling-stone-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">site</a>)</p>\n<p>And smaller ones:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1W2wz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1W2wz.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>(Picture from this <a href=\"http://www.imperium-romana.org/uploads/5/9/3/3/5933147/scientificamerican1073-34.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">essay</a>)</p>\n<p>The way the Tanach describes David collecting stones leads to a common misconception, that he was just picking up random little pebbles. In fact, he was looking for \"חֲמִשָּׁה חַלֻּקֵי אֲבָנִים מִן הַנַּחַל\" - five smooth stones from the river. Why are they stated to have been smooth? Because, as we can see from the above examples of sling-stones, smoothness was crucial to the kinetic movement of the stone upon being fired.</p>\n<p>As to how the sling was fired, upon loading a stone, the slinger would begin to swivel his arm round and round to build up kinetic momentum before letting go of one side of the sling in order to release the stone, as is illustrated here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nlLCR.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nlLCR.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>(Picture from this <a href=\"http://www.imperium-romana.org/uploads/5/9/3/3/5933147/scientificamerican1073-34.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">essay</a>)</p>\n<p>Having said all of this, now we know why David was unaccustomed - at least at this stage of his life - to wearing armor. Speed and strength were crucial to the success of the slinger. At best they would have worn light-weight armor to protect from basic injuries, but not King Shaul's heavy armor. Not to mention that heavy fist-size sling-stones would already weigh him down enough. He needed to conserve enough strength and to allow for his legs to carry him fast enough as he was charging while swiveling the sling.</p>\n<p>The reason I wrote in the beginning also \"no\", because we know that David didn't always use a sling. Later in his life he used a sword. For example, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.25.13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 1:25:13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And David said to his men, “Gird on your swords.” Each girded on his sword; David too girded on his sword...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Swords or short spears are used for close-combat fighting. In close-combat, personal protection is crucial, so I believe that during such times David did wear armor.</p>\n<p>As for you second question, though this was not entirely an exception, as I've explained, David really knew what he was doing when he chose to attack Goliath with the long-range-combat sling rather than a close-combat sword as was given to him by Shaul:</p>\n<p>First, we know that David was already trained in the sling - as evidenced both from his expertise in choosing proper stones and knowing to lose the armor and also from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.17.36?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his story about killing the bear and the lion</a>. Second, there's evidence in the text of the story that Goliath had a number of weaknesses:</p>\n<p>a. He himself had very heavy armor that weighed <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.17.5?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5000 bronze shekels</a>, and spread across his body. Furthermore, he carried not one but <em>three</em> (!!!) weapons: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.17.45?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A sword</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.17.7?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a spear</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.17.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a javelin</a>, which also weigh a lot. We know that all of this slowed Goliath down because of the description of the beginning of the charge:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וְהָיָה כִּי קָם הַפְּלִשְׁתִּי וַיֵּלֶךְ וַיִּקְרַב לִקְרַאת דָּוִד\" (When the Philistine began to advance toward him again) (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.17.48?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:17:48</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's a lot of words to describe Goliath charging David. It seems it was written like this because Goliath literally had difficulty getting up and beginning the charge. By comparison, David's charge was described like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...וַיְמַהֵר דָּוִד וַיָּרָץ הַמַּעֲרָכָה לִקְרַאת הַפְּלִשְׁתִּי\" (David quickly ran up to the battle line to face the Philistine) (ibid.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now <em>that's</em> how you charge - with speed. Two words for speed - to emphasize that he was sprinting very fast and managed to quickly cover much of the distance of the battlefield.</p>\n<p>b. Goliath was over-confident:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He stopped and called out to the ranks of Israel and he said to them, “Why should you come out to engage in battle? I am the Philistine [champion], and you are Saul’s servants. Choose one of your men and let him come down against me. If he bests me in combat and kills me, we will become your slaves; but if I best him and kill him, you shall be our slaves and serve us.” And the Philistine ended, “I herewith defy the ranks of Israel. Get me a man and let’s fight it out!”...The Philistine stepped forward morning and evening and took his stand for forty days.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.17.8?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:17:8-16</a>)</p>\n<p>\"When the Philistine caught sight of David, he scorned him, for he was but a boy, ruddy and handsome.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.17.42?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:17:42</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>c. When David put his sling-stones in his pouch and took the sling in his hand, Goliath refers to \"sticks\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And the Philistine called out to David, “Am I a dog that you come against me with sticks?”...\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.17.43?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:17:43</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this we can infer that Goliath had bad eyesight<sup>3</sup>, mistaking the sling not just for a different object, but he actually saw double (if not worse)! Worse yet, because of this crucial mistake, Goliath actually thought that he was going to duke it out with David in close-combat, which was the only thing he was properly prepared for.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>It seems plausible that David knew at least some of these things, and so, also for these reasons, chose for this battle in particular, to bring his slinging A-game, which meant losing the armor. It may sound risky, but besides for knowing all or most of the above factors, David was doing it for the Kiddush Hashem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"David replied to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin; but I come against you in the name of the LORD of Hosts, the God of the ranks of Israel, whom you have defied.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.17.45?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:17:45</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I heard from Rabbi Uzi Bienenfeld, head of Midreshet Orot Etzion, who also gives classes in places such as Machon Meir, that his daughter got to know during her national service in Israel a kid who made aliyah from Ethiopia. The kid told her that when he lived there, he would go shepherd in the wilderness the family's livestock by himself. One day, he ran into a leopard. He grabbed his sling, loaded it, fired and killed the leopard. Yes, really.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> I've heard - though I can't remember where - that Ehud ben Gerah was one of the remnants of this elite fighting force, which is why he was left-handed. These slingers exercised their left hands more than their right hand, to the point where they did everything with their left hand.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> I first heard of this idea from this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziGD7vQOwl8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TED talk</a> by Malcolm Gladwell. I was amazed that it fit so well with pshat.</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> While it's true that he did have at least one long-distance weapon (either the javelin or the spear, or both, depending on how you interpret which weapon was which exactly and their intended uses), it's quite clear that he wouldn't have been able to handle it properly, because of his other weaknesses: poor eyesight, over-confidence and heavy armor. I believe it was from Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu, the chief rabbi of Tzefat, that I heard that Goliath was both weighted down by his armor, and his bodily proportions were inhuman (i.e. though he was a giant, he was disproportionate in size to a regular human) which made him even more cumbersome, so much so that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.17.41?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his shield wasn't held by him, but by another soldier</a>. However, as @Joshua has pointed out, this is an incorrect understanding of what a shield-bearer was. Nonetheless, Goliath's physical proportions also apparently encumbered him.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does the Hebrew word \"Torah\" originate from BOTH the words “Hora’ah” (meaning, Teaching) and “Orah” (meaning, Light)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does the Hebrew word \"Torah\" originate from BOTH the words “Hora’ah” (meaning, Teaching) and “Orah” (meaning, Light)?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The accurate meaning of “Torah” is twofold. Firstly it comes from the\nword “hora’ah,” which means teaching .... The second ... is from\nthe word “orah,” which means light.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the teaching from a rabbi <a href=\"https://www.aish.com/atr/What-is-Torah.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.aish.com/atr/What-is-Torah.html</a></p>\n<p>But this rabbi does not reference his \"answer from a reputable source\", which is what I am looking for; that is, any source that is accepted here at miyodeya.</p>\n<p>Here at miyodeya, there are a number of questions in regards to the meaning of the word \"Torah\"; such similar questions were not noted as duplicates, because of the various angles, in which it was asked; my hereby question is seeking an authoritative answer about the derivation of the Word \"Torah\" from BOTH “Hora’ah” (meaning, Teaching) and “Orah” (meaning, Light).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It's unclear what you consider to be a <em>reputable source</em>.</p>\n<p>For the idea that Torah means and is associated with light, the Aish Rabbi cites <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.6.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei (Proverbs) 6:23</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּ֤י נֵ֣ר מִ֭צְוָה <strong>וְת֣וֹרָה א֑וֹר</strong> וְדֶ֥רֶךְ חַ֝יִּ֗ים תּוֹכְח֥וֹת מוּסָֽר׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which is Tanach. How much more reputable can you expect than the author of Mishlei, meaning King Solomon?</p>\n<p>Concerning the second idea, that Torah is an expression of instruction (<em>Hora'ah</em>), there are many early sources for this teaching. Just one example is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah_ben_Manoah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> (one of the Rishonim) to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chizkuni%2C_Genesis.26.5.5?vhe=Chizkuni&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 26:5</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותורתי שאמרתי לו לך לך אל הארץ אשר אראך, וראיה לדבר אשכילך ואורך בדרך זו תלך. וכן יורנו בדרך יבחר <strong>וכן כל תורה לשון הוראה.</strong> ולפי הפשט מצותי חקותי הן שבע מצוות שנצטוו בני נח.\nותורותי, “and My teachings;” this is a reference to the beginning of chapter 12 where G-d instructs Avraham to leave home and to proceed to a land that He will show him. As proof that this interpretation is correct, the author quotes Psalms 32,8: אשכילך ואורך בדרך זו, “Let me enlighten you and show you which way to go.” [The subject speaking in that verse is the Holy Spirit. (Alshich) He quotes a similar verse from Psalms 32,8. <strong>Whenever the word תורה occurs, it refers to teaching</strong> as a prelude to commanding the listener to conduct himself in accordance with it. As a result he claims that our verse taken together refers to the 7 universal laws that apply to all of mankind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Certain Rabbis have a habit of not explicitly differentiating the plain meaning of a word or teaching from its exegetical meaning. The exegetical meaning is definitely not wrong, but it’s good to know the difference.</p>\n<p>The word תורה is an inflection of the Hebrew root ירה (y.r.h), which means “to lead” or “to direct”. The root comes from Proto–West-Semitic “w.r.w”, meaning “guide”. Thus, the plain meaning of תורה is “instruction”, which makes a lot of sense considering its purpose of instructing the Jewish people in every aspect of our individual lives and national purpose.</p>\n<p>Exegetically, תורה (Tōrā) is compared to אורה (‘ōrā), light, by phonetic similarity (they sound similar). The connection is proven meaningful by the following verse in משלי (brought in the answer of @Yaacov Deane:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּ֤י נֵ֣ר מִ֭צְוָה <strong>וְת֣וֹרָה א֑וֹר</strong> וְדֶ֥רֶךְ חַ֝יִּ֗ים תּוֹכְח֥וֹת מוּסָֽר׃</p>\n<p>For the commandment[s] are a lamp and Torah is light….</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clearly, according to scripture, Torah is comparable to light.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, this tribe said: I am not going into the sea first, and that tribe said: I am not going into the sea first. Then, in jumped the prince of Judah, Nahshon ben Amminadab, and descended into the sea first, accompanied by his entire tribe, as it is stated: “Ephraim surrounds Me with lies and the house of Israel with deceit, and Judah is yet wayward toward God [rad im El]” (Hosea 12:1), which is interpreted homiletically as: And Judah descended [rad] with God [im El]. 4And in this regard, the tradition, i.e., the Writings, explicates Nahshon’s prayer at that moment: “Save me, God; for the waters are come in even unto the soul. I am sunk in deep mire, where there is no standing…let not the water flood overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up” (Psalms 69:2–3, 16). 5At that time, Moses was prolonging his prayer. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: My beloved ones are drowning in the sea and you prolong your prayer to me? Moses said before Him: Master of the Universe, but what can I do? God said to him: “Speak to the children of Israel that they go forward. And you, lift up your rod and stretch out your hand” (Exodus 14:15–16). 6For this reason, because Nahshon and the tribe of Judah went into the sea first, the tribe of Judah merited to govern Israel, as it is stated: “Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion. The sea saw it and fled” (Psalms 114:2–3). The baraita interprets the verses in this manner: What is the reason that Judah became His sanctuary and Israel came under His dominion? It is because “the sea saw it and fled.”\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This idea was later brought in several midrashim and commentators such as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.114.2?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.114.2?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

That would be appropriate for our material world, but inappropriate for the immaterial one.</p>\n<p>How should it be understood?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>All these directional terms are meshalim. Above refers to closeness to G-d, and below is more distant. G-d is metaphorically at the top, as all his creations are below him. G-d created a hierarchy of creations, so that the hashpa'ah or emanations that are created by G-d go from one realm to the next until they reach our world. Because we are used to things flowing downward, the realms that are \"first in line\" are referred to as being higher than the realms that are \"downstream\".</p>\n<p>[These realms (אצילות, בריאה, יצירה, עשייה)are described at length in Nefesh Hachaim and other sefarim. The Ramchal in his Ma'amar al haHagados (found in introductions to Ein Yaakov) says that anyone who does not understand this concept cannot understand anything Chazal say, as it is the basic paradigm of their discussions.]</p>\n<p>Right and left refer to Chessed and Din respectively. Because most people are right-handed, Chessed is called the right because it is the main purpose of creation (see Mesillas Yesharim.) The Chessed would be greater if it was earned, so Hashem created the world with a system of judgement, Din. This purpose is secondary, so it is referred to as the left.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Emotionally, presumably.</p>\n<p>I.e. wherein traversing a particular distance is synonymous with making a specific emotional journey.</p>\n<p>For example, I heard from Rb Mordechai Miller than when it says that the distance between each <em>shamayim</em> is 500 years travel, this means it would take 500 years of <em>avodas Hashem</em> to go from the madregah of one <em>shamayim</em> to the next.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>Hilchot Yesodei Torah 1:11-12</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since it has been clarified that He does not have a body or corporeal form, it is also clear that none of the functions of the body are appropriate to Him: neither connection nor separation, neither place nor measure, neither ascent nor descent, neither right nor left, neither front nor back, neither standing nor sitting.</p>\n<p>He is not found within time, so that He would possess a beginning, an end, or age.

Our Sages declared: \"Above, there is no sitting or standing, separation or connection.\"</p>\n<p>Since this is so, all such [descriptions] and the like which are related in the Torah and the words of the Prophets - all these are metaphors and imagery. [For example,] \"He who sits in the heavens shall laugh\" [Psalms 2:4], \"They angered Me with their emptiness\" [Deuteronomy 32:21], and \"As God rejoiced\" [ibid. 28:63]. With regard to all such statements, our Sages said: \"The Torah speaks in the language of man.\"</p>\n<p>This is [borne out by the rhetorical question (Jeremiah 7:19):] \"Are they enraging Me?\" Behold, [Malachi 3:6] states: \"I, God, have not changed.\" Now were He to at times be enraged and at times be happy, He would change.

While Maimonides stressed that G-d has no body and is one,  we cannot attribute anything to G-d because G-d is above human language. At best, all we can say is what God is not.</p>\n<p>Maimonides emphasized the importance to “know” that G-d exists by \"knowing\" about G-d's universe (Exodus 33). Thus, we can only “know” G-d by knowing or having knowledge of the laws of nature that G-d created.</p>\n<p>Maimonides said, “The only path to knowing G-d is through science—and for that reason the Bible opens with a description of the creation.” (See Gerald Schroeder, The Science of G-d, at vi, 17.) Thus, all that we can know is that G-d exists.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rambam sort of addresses this in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 1:59 where he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>THE following question might perhaps be asked: Since there is no\npossibility of obtaining a knowledge of the true essence of God, and\nsince it has also been proved that the only thing that man can\napprehend of Him is the fact that He exists, and that all positive\nattributes are inadmissible, as has been shown, what is the difference\namong those who have obtained a knowledge of God? Must not the\nknowledge obtained by our teacher Moses, and by Solomon, be the same\nas that obtained by any one of the lowest class of philosophers, since\nthere can be no addition to this knowledge? But, on the other hand, it\nis generally accepted among theologians and also among philosophers,\nthat there can be a great difference between two persons as regards\nthe knowledge of God obtained by them. Know that this is really the\ncase, that those who have obtained a knowledge of God differ greatly\nfrom each other; for in the same way as by each additional attribute\nan object is more specified, and is brought nearer to the true\napprehension of the observer, so by each additional negative attribute\nyou advance toward the knowledge of God, and you are nearer to it than\nhe who does not negative, in reference to God, those qualities which\nyou are convinced by proof must be negatived. There may thus be a man\nwho after having earnestly devoted many years to the pursuit of one\nscience, and to the true understanding of its principles, till he is\nfully convinced of its truths, has obtained as the sole result of this\nstudy the conviction that a certain quality must be negatived in\nreference to God, and the capacity of demonstrating that it is\nimpossible to apply it to Him. Superficial thinkers will have no proof\nfor this, will doubtfully ask, Is that thing existing in the Creator,\nor not? And those who are deprived of sight will positively ascribe it\nto God, although it has been clearly shown that He does not possess\nit. E.g., while I show that God is incorporeal, another doubts and is\nnot certain whether He is corporeal or incorporeal: others even\npositively declare that He is corporeal, and appear before the Lord\nwith that belief. Now see how great the difference is between these\nthree men: the first is undoubtedly nearest to the Almighty; the\nsecond is remote, and the third still more distant from Him. If there\nbe a fourth person who holds himself convinced by proof that emotions\nare impossible in God, while the first who rejects the corporeality,\nis not convinced of that impossibility, that fourth person is\nundoubtedly nearer the knowledge of God than the first, and go on, so\nthat a person who, convinced by proof, negatives a number of things in\nreference to God, which according to our belief may possibly be in Him\nor emanate from Him, is undoubtedly a more perfect man than we are,\nand would surpass us still more if we positively believed these things\nto be properties of God. It will now be clear to you, that every time\nyou establish by proof the negation of a thing in reference to God,\nyou become more perfect, while with every additional positive\nassertion you follow your imagination and recede from the true\nknowledge of God. Only by such ways must we approach the knowledge of\nGod, and by such researches and studies as would show us the\ninapplicability of what is inadmissible as regards the Creator, not by\nsuch methods as would prove the necessity of ascribing to Him anything\nextraneous to His essence, or asserting that He has a certain\nperfection, when we find it to be a perfection in relation to us. The\nperfections are all to some extent acquired properties, and a property\nwhich must be acquired does not exist in everything capable of making\nsuch acquisition.</p>\n<p>You must bear in mind, that by affirming anything of God, you are\nremoved from Him in two respects; first, whatever you affirm, is only\na perfection in relation to us; secondly, He does not possess anything\nsuperadded to this essence; His essence includes all His perfections,\nas we have shown. Since it is a well-known fact that even that\nknowledge of God which is accessible to man cannot be attained except\nby negations, and that negations do not convey a true idea of the\nbeing to which they refer, all people, both of past and present\ngenerations, declared that God cannot be the object of human\ncomprehension, that none but Himself comprehends what He is, and that\nour knowledge consists in knowing that we are unable truly to\ncomprehend Him.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp069.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Torah says, “And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lowermost part of the mount” (Exodus 19:17). Rabbi Avdimi bar Ḥama bar Ḥasa said: the Jewish people actually stood beneath the mountain, and the verse teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, overturned the mountain above the Jews like a tub, and said to them: If you accept the Torah, excellent, and if not, there will be your burial.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here we see that, yes, from the start, there was also an aspect of compulsion in keeping the Torah. At the same time, though, we know that it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.30.19?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day: I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse. <strong>Choose</strong> life—if you and your offspring would live.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the aspect of us being given a choice, i.e., were we to want to do good, we should follow the Torah. Anything else is not good, but is equally a choice one can make.</p>\n<p>So yes, it seems both aspects were present in the giving of the Torah and its commandments. As to whether there was done purposely by Hashem to be like certain kings of the era - I don't know. After all, the Israelites just came from centuries of servitude. I doubt the work commands they received were like instructions as though they had any choice in the matter.</p>\n<p>This brings to mind a song by Rabbi Yehudah Halevi, author of the Kuzari:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עַבְדֵי זְמָן עַבְדֵי עֲבָדִים הֵם –</p>\n<p>עֶבֶד ה' הוּא לְבַד חָפְשִׁי:</p>\n<p>עַל כֵּן בְבַקֵּשׁ כָּל-אֱנוֹשׁ חֶלְקוֹ</p>\n<p>\"חֶלְקִי ה'!\" אָמְרָה נַפְשִׁי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rough translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Those enslaved to time are slaves of slaves</p>\n<p><strong>The servant of the Lord he alone is free</strong></p>\n<p>So when every man requests his due</p>\n<p>\"My due is with my Lord!\" says my soul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I am not aware of any parallels in ancient near eastern religions either. I would like to know if any commentaries explain why Nevuchadnezzar chose to consign those who chose not to bow down to his statue ie Chanaya, Mishael and Azarya to death by burning in a furnace specifically (Daniel 3:6, passim and see Yirmiyahu 29:22)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are a few parallels or partial parallels in the Near East and in Tanach & Midrash:</p>\n<p><strong>Near East Judicial Processes:</strong></p>\n<p>In an essay on this exact subject (available for free now on <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25610183?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JSTOR</a> or <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/1581259/The_Babylonian_Background_of_the_Motif_of_the_Fiery_Furnace_in_Daniel_3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Academia.edu</a>) by Professor Paul-Alain Beaulieu, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Execution by burning occurs in Mesopotamia both as a provision of the legal system for certain crimes and as a punishment imposed by the king. It is attested already in the Old Babylonian period. The Code of Hammurabi prescribes death by burning for three offenses: for thefts committed during a fire (the thief is cast into that same fire [CH 25])...The Old Babylonian omen CT 6, 2 (case 14) envisages the following situation...\"the high priestess will steal the taboo offering, but she will be captured and burned...a letter from the archives of Mari, contemporary with the preceding text, rhetorically alludes to death by burning simply for harboring forbidden thoughts...Burning occurs also in later sources from the first millennium...[in a Babylonian judicial chronicle from the Hellenistic period]...three cases of sacrilege are reported...The punishment involved is almost invariably death by fire...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Beaulieu points out that from these texts one cannot tell in which manner these criminals were burned. Later in the essay, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...It is fortunate that we have three instances in Mesopotamia where the manner of execution by burning is specified, and all three cases involve being thrown into an oven or a furnace...The earliest text (BIN 7, 10) is a letter of King Rim-Sin of Larsa...:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Speak to Lu-Ninurta, Balmu-namhe, Ipqu-Erra and Mannum-kima-Sin: Thus says Rim-Sin, your lord. Because he cast a boy into the oven, you, throw the slave into the kiln\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...The two words for \"oven\" and \"kiln\" are tinuru and utunu. The latter derives from the Sumerian Udun, and occurs more rarely as atunu, the form under which it entered the Aramaic language (אתון in Daniel 3). The second occurrence comes from a palace edict of the Assyrian king Assur-resa-isi...:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...she is veiled for her lord. They shall throw them, either the woman or the man, the eye-witness, in the oven.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...The third and final example occurs in a Neo-Babylonian school text from the Sippar temple library...:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"To Enlil-naidn-sumi, governor of the land...son of the loins of princeship, superintendent of all [the cult centers of A]kkad, speak, thus [Samsu-ilun]a, king of the world...Inwardly they profane and desecrate their god...You now, destroy them, burn them, roast the...to the cook's oven...make their smoke billow, bring about their fiery end with the fierce flame of the box-thorn<sup>1</sup>!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashurbanipal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ashurbanipal</a>, king of Assyria and identified by some with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezra.4.10?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ossnapar</a> from Ezra, had a tablet made in which he described his battles against his brother <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamash-shum-ukin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shamash-Shum-ukin</a>, also known as Saulmugina.

There was also an image [there] with the face of a calf and with its hands extended like a human [whose hands are open to receive] something from one's friend. Then they heated it until its hands became like fire. It also had seven latticed gates, with [the image] behind the innermost of them. Each and every one would enter in accordance with his offering. Whoever offered a bird entered the first lattice gate. With a goat he entered the second lattice gate; with a lamb, the third; with a calf, the fourth; with a bullock, the fifth; with a bull, the sixth. To whoever was offering his child the idol priests would say that there is none higher than that. He entered within the seventh lattice gate. Then he went and kissed it, as stated (in Hos. 13:2): THOSE WHO SACRIFICE A HUMAN BEING KISS CALVES. Then the idol priests would take his child from him and put the young child upon the hands of Molech, while they took the drums and beat on them, so that the father would not hear the voice of his child. Then they pressed the young child's entrails upon it, while the young child screamed until [its spirit] left its body in the hands of [the idol].\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this description, the Molech was thought to look something like this:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/58UGV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/58UGV.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n(picture from <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%9A#/media/%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%91%D7%A5:Kircher_oedipus_aegyptiacus_27_moloch.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>The death of Achav ben Koliah and Tzidkiyyah ben Ma'asiyah:</strong></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.29.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 29:21</a><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.29.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">-</a><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.29.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">23</a>, there's a mention of two false prophets being burned to death by Nevuchadnetzar:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Thus said the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who prophesy falsely to you in My name: I am going to deliver them into the hands of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon, and he shall put them to death before your eyes. And the whole community of Judah in Babylonia shall use a curse derived from their fate: “May God make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon consigned to the flames!”— because they did vile things in Israel, committing adultery with the wives of their fellows and speaking in My name false words which I had not commanded them. I am He who knows and bears witness—declares the LORD.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.29.22?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&p2=Sanhedrin.93a&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 93a</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is not stated: Whom the king of Babylonia burned, but “whom the king of Babylonia toasted.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: This teaches that he rendered them like toasted wheat, which is toasted on all sides.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this the Ben Yehoyadah writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"מְלַמֵּד שֶׁעֲשָׂאָם כִּקְלָיוֹת. נראה לי בס\"ד הכונה אם היה זורקם לתוך האש לא היו נעשים כקליות אלא היו נעשים אפר וגחלים ותתאבד צורתן אך הוא הניחם בתוך מחבת של נחשת והעבירם בתוך הכבשן כאדם שתולה בשר בתוך המחבת ומאת ה' היתה שהניח בלבו לעשות כן כדי שיוציאום אחר כך מן הכבשן ויהיו נראין קלויים בעוד צורתן עליהם לעיני הכל ויתבזו ויתפרסם הנס ביותר, מה שאין כן אם היה זורקן לכבשן היו נעשים אפר ואין ניכרים ולא היה אפשר להוציאם קודם שיהיו אפר וגחלים כי מי יוכל להתקרב לכבשן להוציאם אבל במחבת יש ידות ארוכות ושלשלאות ברזל קבועים בה ומשכום והוציאום אחר שנקלו.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: This teaches that he rendered them like toasted wheat. It seems to me BS\"D that the meaning is that if he would have thrown them into the fire they wouldn't have become like toasted wheat, but would have become ashes and coals and their shape would have been lost, but he placed them inside a copper pan and passed them through the furnace like a man who hangs his meat inside a pan and from Hashem was this that he placed inside his heart to do so, so he'll take them out of the furnace afterwards and they would look toasted while their shape shall hold before the eyes of all and they shall be embarrassed and the miracle shall be made famous, which would not have been had he simply thrown them into the furnace they would have become ashes and not noticeable and it would not have been possible to remove them prior to them becoming ashes and coals for who can come close to a furnace, but a pan has handles and iron chains attached to it and they pulled them out once they were toasted.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I think that considering all of the evidence, burning the three by furnace-fire was not such a random, rare event (unfortunately, of course, for the people who did die in that manner).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Interestingly, boxthorn is the אטד plant which is mentioned a few times in Tanach.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Zoroastrianism and its fire motif are in fact alluded to by Rashi in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.21b.8?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Shabbat.21b.8.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 21b</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Gittin.17a.1.2?vhe=Vilna_Edition&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 16b-17a</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Daniel.3.6?lang=bi&p2=Malbim_on_Daniel.3.6.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זה עונש לממרה מצות המלך, וגם לשרוף ולבער את המורד מן העולם שיהיה כלא היה ולא תעשה מרידתו רושם בהענין הרוחני אשר כיון במלכות הנצחי</p>\n<p><em>This punishment is for the embitterment of the King's command (i.e. for failing to bow down to this graven image), and also to burn and destroy anyone who rebels from the world and make it as if it had never been, and to not do any form of rebellion that makes an impression in spiritual matters since (he viewed it as threatening what he thought of as) the eternal kingdom.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, this Malbim would seem to suggest that he wanted to employ burning as a means to completely eradicate and leave no trace of any would-be rebel that threatened his kingship and that is why he specifically chose the punishment of burning.</p>\n<p>Indeed such was his anger that the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.28.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Shocher Tov 28:2</a> relates that he raged, \"If the furnace is usually heated with one bundle, let it now be filled with seven, and if usually lit with seven, let it now be lit with forty-nine!\" - So it is clear that he was incredibly annoyed by these three men who stood in his way and he wanted to completely decimate them!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It is worth noting parenthetically the flip-side that it is clear from a number of sources that they reasoned that they had to specifically go through this furnace for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>Firstly, it is worth noting the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.53b.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 53b</a> where they learnt out a kal vachomer from the Frogs in the second plague who jumped into the ovens:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נשאו קל וחומר בעצמן מצפרדעים ומה צפרדעים שאין מצווין על קדושת השם כתיב בהו ובאו [ועלו] בביתך [וגו׳] ובתנוריך ובמשארותיך אימתי משארות מצויות אצל תנור הוי אומר בשעה שהתנור חם אנו שמצווין על קדושת השם על אחת כמה וכמה</p>\n<p><em>They drew an a fortiori inference on their own from the plague of frogs in Egypt.

When are kneading bowls found near the oven? You must say that it is when the oven is hot.

If everything in this word was created deliberately by G‑d, why is your blood redder than the purposeful existence of a tomato? And he answers that . . . it’s not. One who eats solely for his own selfish desires has swallowed the meaningful life of a vegetable with no excuse. “It’s not fair!” cries the helpless plant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The line \"<strong>Rabbi Isaac Luria questions the right of man to consume any organism for his own self-preservation.</strong>\" is totally unambiguous: No eating plants even to survive!  Did the Arizal really suggest that?  How are we to survive, then? By eating dead fruit falling from trees?  Is there a solid reference to the quote?</p>\n<p>When we have succeeded in manufacturing food from individual molecules of matter, we can consider his proposal.  But until then -- pikuach nefesh!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the article contains no citation to where the Arizal allegedly said this. However, given that the question is asked on the article's portrayal of the Arizal's view, we can answer it using just the article as well.</p>\n<p>In the very paragraph you cite, note this key sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One who eats solely for his own selfish desires has swallowed the meaningful life of a vegetable with no excuse. “It’s not fair!” cries the helpless plant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At face value this seems to indicate that the problem is specifically when you eat the plant for selfish reasons. So he's not saying to not eat plants; he's saying to eat them for the right reasons. This is confirmed by the very next paragraph (not cited in the question):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, when we eat with the intention to use the energy to further our uniquely human service of G‑d, we have lifted the food up. When a person performs a G‑dly deed—a deed which transcends his natural self—the food he eats is elevated along with him, and is reunited with its G‑dly source.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is already enough to answer the question – if you eat plants for selfish reasons then you have \"taken a life\" with no excuse; if, however, you eat for the right reasons, not only is it not problematic but you're actually helping the plants.</p>\n<p>However, the next paragraph in the article seems to retract somewhat. It says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But there’s a difference between animal-based and vegetation-based foods. For starters, you can’t live without bread. If you’d eat bread only when you’re ready to elevate it, you might starve to death and never get a chance to try again. So we can’t restrict bread-eating to the spiritual-minded. Moreover, when eating simple, necessary foods like bread, it is easier to maintain a purposeful perspective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This makes it sound like you can even eat plants for selfish reasons (to prevent yourself from dying) or that staying alive is not considered a selfish reason (perhaps because, as alluded to, staying alive will give you later opportunities to do it right). It is not entirely clear, though, whether this is still what the Arizal said, or whether it is the author's own analysis of the contrast between plants and meat.</p>\n<p>In any case, it seems pretty clear from the article that one is allowed to eat plants and need not starve to death.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is there m'ila until the ashes are removed?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <em>Mishna</em> in chapter 2 of <em>M'ila</em> outlines <em>when</em> the use of a sacrificial offering for one's own purposes, by accident, engenders the requirement to bring a sin-offering.  Most <em>kodshe kadashim</em> (\"most holy\" offerings) can engender such a requirement if the use was before \"they went out to the ash area\", meaning that they were burnt on the altar and (the next morning as every morning) some ash was removed from the altar — or, some explain, that the altar was emptied of ashes, which occurred less often.</p>\n<p>Why until the ash was removed from the altar? The standard is \"until its command is fulfilled\" but (1) taking ashes each morning from the altar is unrelated to, and may not even contain the ashes of, any particular offering, and (2) emptying the altar of ashes is no command at all and was done when convenient.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <em>gemara</em> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Meilah.9a.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Me'ilah 9a</a> records a debate regarding the point after which <em>me'ilah</em> can no longer occur to sacrificial items burnt on the altar.</p>\n<p>Rav holds that the boundary point is <em>termumat hadeshen</em> (the daily removal of some ash from the altar and its placement on the floor near the altar) and Rav Yochanan holds that it is after all the ash has been removed outside of the city.</p>\n<p>To answer your first question (on Rav's position), I believe (although I have no source) that the logic runs as follows:</p>\n<p>The command of an individual sacrifice is \"fulfilled\" once it is burnt, but immediately afterwards there is another command to fulfill with all of the ashes atop the altar, namely the removal of some of them from the altar to the floor. Once that takes place, we can indeed now say that the command (of all of the ashes atop the altar) has been fulfilled, and <em>me'ilah</em> is no longer relevant.</p>\n<p>To answer your second question (on Rav Yochanan's view) the <em>gemara</em> (ibid.) records that Rav Yochanan believes that since the removal of all of the ashes outside of city must be done by a priest wearing the priestly clothes, it indicates that indeed the ashes still retain some sanctity, and, presumably, their command cannot be said to have been fulfilled, until that has been carried out.</p>\n\n\n",

I wonder what the etymology of this word is, since the root קטל means \"kill\".</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=48235#p=85\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Aruch</a> says that \"some\" indeed explain it as related to the Aramaic root קטל, because the woman binds it fairly tightly around her neck so that she looks plump. (In a comment on the OP, Heshy points out that the English \"choker\" is similar.)</p>\n<p>However, Musaf Ha'Aruch there (prefaced with א\"ב, standing for אמר בנימין) and Kohut (אחי\"ה, standing for אמר חנוך יהודה הכהן) trace it to Latin <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/catella#Etymology_2\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>catella</em></a>, a small chain (and thus related to the English word <em>chain</em> itself, as well as <em>catenary</em>, etc.)</p>\n\n\n",

Why do we need to learn a language?\"</a></p>\n<p>In my understanding, in Judaism, a soul is a complete entity having only one degree of freedom, namely the total amount of merits and sins. The soul is unchangeable otherwise in its other qualities. It dwells happily in the Treasure of souls until God decides to bestow it a chance of ascending to a better spot by coming down to this world and participating in the game of human history, getting rewards for observing Mitzvos and getting fouls for overriding it like in a video game, but the character itself stays unchanged through the game.</p>\n<p>I also understood from my Rabbi's Kabbalistic teachings, that studying Torah and keeping Miztvos in this world does not change the soul, but only affects its merits and its sins do not affect the soul but the cleansing it gets. This also explains the reincarnation of the souls of seniors to kids.</p>\n<p>For some comments to my question, I learned that some speculate that the soul might grow just like the body does, and the soul that comes down is a kind of a \"baby-soul\" that develops further into a \"full-grown\" soul.</p>\n<p>What do our sources say about the soul's development over a lifetime?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are many sources that deal with this question. I am currently learning Chesed LeAvraham, so I will quote and translate the relevant passage, which is from Maayan 4, Nahar 4:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>נהר ד - בתועלת ירידת הנשמה לזה העולם:</h3>\n<p>הקשו הקדמונים על ענין הנשמה מה תועלת ברדתה, [אל הגוף] מפני שהיא קרובה\nאל ההפסד בחטא וזהמת החומר המזוהם ופיתויי היצר הרע הטמא, ורחוקה מן השכר\nכי אחרי צאתה מחומר הזה מי ומי אשר תזכה למסור נשמתו לקונו בטהרה כמו\nשנתנה לו, ואם תעלה לא תעלה יותר מהמקום אשר ממנה חוצבה, אם כן מה כוונת\nבריאתה ומה תועלתה?</p>\n<p>והתשובה בזה כי הנשמה בהיותה שם קודם רדתה היא אצורה באוצר ידוע לנשמות\nשעדיין לא באו לעולם, ואין הנשמה נהנת שם מהסתכלותה באור וחיי עליון אלא\nהיא בת מלך צנועה, יש לה מאכל קצוב מאת המלך אביה, אמנם פניו לא יראה עוד\nמיום הולדה מפני שהיא ערומה שלולה [ממצות ומעשים טובים ] שאי אפשר להתלבש\nלהראות את פני המלך אביה אם לא בלבוש מעשה המצות והתורה.</p>\n<p>ויש בין נשמה קודם באה לעולם ואחר שבאה ועלתה כגבוה שמים על הארץ, וזהו\nשאמר בזוהר פקודי עמוד תי\"ב ובהאי לבושא דלביש שהוא לבושא דמצות כנזכר שם\nאתהני וחמי גו אספקלריא וכו', והענין כי על ידי שירדה לעולם הזה הגשמי\nויכלל בה רוח ונפש וגוף ויעשה בו מצות ומעשים טובים, ויסתלק ויתלבש בהם\nלעולם הבא, ונמצאת כלולה בכל העולמות</p>\n<p>ואז נראית היא למעלה את פני המלך אביה, ואלמלא כללותה בכל העולמות כנזכר\nלא היה נראית שם, והיינו אמרו אך צדיקים יודו לשמך בעולם הזה, הם אותם\nשישבו ישרים את פניך בעולם הבא, ואכין מעוטין וממעט אותם צדיקים שלא ירדו\nלעולם הזה שלא ישבו את פניו לעולם הבא כנזכר:</p>\n<p>והטעם העקרי שהנשמה מכסא מבינה, והרוח מת\"ת ממלאך , ונפש ממלכות מאופן,\nואם לא ירד לעולם הזה לא תקשור נפש ברוח ורוח בנשמה, והוא פירוד למעלה\nשאין בינה מאירה בת\"ת ואין ת\"ת מאיר במלכות, כי מעשה הענפים יעשו השרשים,\nאמנם ברדת האדם לעולם תתקשר הנשמה ברוח ותאיר בו ושניהם מאירות בנפש\nושלשתם בגוף, ודומה להם יתקשרו למעלה שלשתם להאיר בעולם הזה, ולזה נהנה\nכעין יחוד זה לעולם הבא, והיינו לחזות בנועם י\"י ולבקר בהיכלו, וזמש\"ל:</p>\n<h3><strong>River 4 - On the Purpose of the Soul's Descent into This World:</strong></h3>\n<p>The Kadmonim questioned the purpose of the soul’s descent [into the\nbody], seeing as, in descending, the soul becomes vulnerable to sin,\nthe impurity of the material world, and the temptations of the evil\ninclination. It is also distanced from its ultimate reward, for who\ncan truly ensure that their soul will be returned to its Creator in\nthe purity in which it was given? And if it does ascend back, it\ncannot rise higher than the place from which it was hewn. If so, what\nis the purpose of its creation and descent?</p>\n<p>The answer to this is that before the soul descends, it is stored in a\ndesignated treasury for souls that have not yet entered the world. In\nthat state, the soul does not derive pleasure from gazing upon the\nLight (of Hashem) and higher life; rather, it is like a modest\nprincess. The soul has a set portion of sustenance from the King, her\nFather, but she does not see His face from the day of her creation\nbecause she is \"naked,\" [lacking the garments of <em>mitzvot</em>\n(commandments) and good deeds]. For it is impossible for her to be\nclothed in a way that would allow her to see the face of the King\nunless she is adorned with the garments of <em>mitzvot</em> and Torah.</p>\n<p>The difference between a soul before it enters this world and after it\nhas come and ascended back is as vast as the distance between heaven\nand earth. This is what the <em>Zohar</em> in <em>Pekudei</em> (amud 412) explains:\n\"In this garment that it wears — which is the garment of <em>mitzvot</em> —\nit derives pleasure and sees through the glass window, etc.\" The idea\nis that by descending into this physical world, the soul becomes\nintegrated with the <em>ruach</em>, the <em>nefesh</em>, and the body. Through the\nperformance of <em>mitzvot</em> and good deeds, it ascends and is clothed in\nthese deeds for Olam Haba, becoming incorporated into all realms.</p>\n<p>Then, the soul can now appear before the King, her Father, above. If\nit were not for its integration into all realms, as mentioned, it\nwould not be able to appear there. This is what was meant by the\nstatement (ibid): \"Only the righteous will give thanks to Your name in\nthis world,\" referring to those who will \"sit upright before You\"\n(Tehillim 140:14) in the World to Come. However, only a few of the\nrighteous who did not descend into this world will not have the merit\nto appear before Him in the World to Come, as previously mentioned.</p>\n<p><sup>[Kabbalistic portion that wouldn't translate well, that explains\nexactly which unifications are completed by the connection of the\n<em>neshama</em> with the <em>ruach</em> and <em>nefesh</em> that occurs due to the descent.]</sup></p>\n<p>However, when man descends into the world, the <em>neshama</em> becomes\nconnected to the <em>ruach</em> and illuminates it, and both the <em>neshama</em>\nand <em>ruach</em> illuminate the <em>nefesh</em>, with all three uniting in the\nbody. Correspondingly, above, the three become interconnected and\nilluminate this world. Because of this, man enjoys a similar\nunification in the World to Come, as it says, \"To behold the beauty of\nthe Lord and to inquire in His Temple\" (Tehillim 27:4). This is the explanation of the previous statement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> The soul in question is unable to face Hashem until she is clothed in Torah and Mitzvot, which can only happen in this lower world. Therefore, we are indeed discussing a soul, who doesn't seem to change in and of herself, but rather gets a chance to \"put on some clothes\", so she can appear before the King.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>In <em>De Anima</em> (<em>On the Soul</em>), Aristotle defined the soul as the life force \"of the living body.” Aristotle explained that what made people “virtuous,” what distinguishes people from animals and fulfilled their telos was the development of the intellect.</p>\n<p>Similarly, and like Aristotle, Maimonides wrote in his <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 1:1 that people should develop their intellect (from the Shlomo Pines translation, Guide, pages 21-23).</p>\n<p>Maimonides writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משנה תורה הלכות דעות א:ד-ה</p>\n<p>[ד-ה] כָּל אָדָם שֶׁדֵּעוֹתָיו כֻּלָּן דֵּעוֹת בֵּינוֹנִיּוֹת\nמְמֻצָּעוֹת, נִקְרָא ‘חָכָם’. וּמִי שְׁהוּא מְדַקְדֵּק עַל עַצְמוֹ\nבְּיוֹתֵר, וְיִתְרַחַק מִדֵּעָה בֵּינוֹנִית מְעַט, לְצַד זֶה אוֹ לְצַד\nזֶה, נִקְרָא ‘חָסִיד’. כֵּיצַד: מִי שֶׁיִּתְרַחַק מִגֹּבַהּ הַלֵּב,\nעַד הַקָּצֶה הָאַחֲרוֹן, וְיִהְיֶה שְׁפַל רוּחַ בְּיוֹתֵר, נִקְרָא\n‘חָסִיד’; וְזוֹ הִיא ‘מִדַּת חֲסִידוּת’. וְאִם נִתְרַחַק עַד הָאֶמְצָע\nבִּלְבָד, וְיִהְיֶה עָנָו, נִקְרָא ‘חָכָם’; וְזוֹ הִיא ‘מִדַּת\nחָכְמָה’. וְעַל דֶּרֶךְ זוֹ, שְׁאָר כָּל הַדֵּעוֹת. וַחֲסִידִים\nהָרִאשׁוֹנִים הָיוּ מַטִּין דֵּעוֹת שֶׁלָּהֶן מִדֶּרֶךְ הָאֶמְצָעִית\nכְּנֶגֶד שְׁתֵּי הַקְּצָווֹת. יֵשׁ דֵּעָה שֶׁמַּטִּין אוֹתָהּ כְּנֶגֶד\nהַקָּצֶה הָאַחֲרוֹן, וְיֵשׁ דֵּעָה שֶׁמַּטִּין אוֹתָהּ כְּנֶגֶד\nהַקָּצֶה הָרִאשׁוֹן; וְזֶה הוּא ‘לִפְנִים מִשּׁוּרַת הַדִּין’.\nוּמְצֻוִּין אָנוּ לָלֶכֶת בִּדְרָכִים אֵלּוּ הַבֵּינוֹנִיִּים, וְהֶם\nהַדְּרָכִים הַטּוֹבִים וְהַיְּשָׁרִים, שֶׁנֶּאֱמָר (דברים כח:ט),\n‘וְהָלַכְתָּ בִּדְרָכָיו’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, Maimonides understood the soul as \"pure intellect,\" therefore, if one wants to use the term “soul,” they should refer to it as the intellect.</p>\n<p>If we accept Maimonides' definition of the soul as \"pure intellect,\" and if we agree with Maimonides that humans have a duty to develop that intellect, then it would seem that the soul develops.</p>\n\n\n",

I am therefore still looking for a Tanakh source on a peshat level.</p>\n<p>So, for information, Rashi seems to suggest that \"yetzer hatov\" is derived from a poetic passage, Kohelet 4:13, where neither the words \"yetzer\" or \"tov\" exist:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Better a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who no\nlonger knows to receive admonition.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Better a poor and wise child:</strong> <em>This is the good inclination, and why is it called a child?

And it only emphasizes this about a single tree. All the other trees were <em>desirable in appearance and comprised of good only, f<strong>or use as food</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 3:5</a> it goes on to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּ֚י יֹדֵ֣עַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים <strong>כִּ֗י בְּיוֹם֙ אֲכָלְכֶ֣ם מִמֶּ֔נּוּ וְנִפְקְח֖וּ עֵֽינֵיכֶ֑ם וִהְיִיתֶם֙ כֵּֽאלֹהִ֔ים יֹדְעֵ֖י ט֥וֹב וָרָֽע</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Nachash reported to Chava, Adam's wife, that when they eat the fruit from this tree which is a mixture of Tov and Rah, they will acquire its quality.

They had not eaten from the Tree of Knowledge of Tov and Rah. Only after consuming the fruit of that tree which contained a mixture of Tov and Rah, did they acquire that dual nature.</p>\n<p>And then further in the Torah, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.20.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 20:19</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּֽי־תָצ֣וּר אֶל־עִיר֩ יָמִ֨ים רַבִּ֜ים לְֽהִלָּחֵ֧ם עָלֶ֣יהָ לְתָפְשָׂ֗הּ לֹֽא־תַשְׁחִ֤ית אֶת־עֵצָהּ֙ לִנְדֹּ֤חַ עָלָיו֙ גַּרְזֶ֔ן כִּ֚י מִמֶּ֣נּוּ תֹאכֵ֔ל וְאֹת֖וֹ לֹ֣א תִכְרֹ֑ת <strong>כִּ֤י הָֽאָדָם֙ עֵ֣ץ הַשָּׂדֶ֔ה</strong> לָבֹ֥א מִפָּנֶ֖יךָ בַּמָּצֽוֹר׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It emphasizes this same concept in the prohibition against cutting down the surrounding  fruit trees when making war against a city because you may come to eat those fruit in the future. And it states plainly that <em><strong>a human being is a tree</strong></em> in the field. You incorporate the qualities of the fruit from those trees which you eat and become <em>like</em> them.</p>\n<p>And in case this idea seems confusing, it is also emphasized in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.1.39?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 1:39</a> when Moshe explains who will be permitted to enter the land of Israel, who will not enter and why.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְטַפְּכֶם֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אֲמַרְתֶּ֜ם לָבַ֣ז יִהְיֶ֗ה וּ֠<strong>בְנֵיכֶם אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹא־יָדְע֤וּ הַיּוֹם֙ ט֣וֹב וָרָ֔ע הֵ֖מָּה יָבֹ֣אוּ שָׁ֑מָּה</strong> וְלָהֶ֣ם אֶתְּנֶ֔נָּה וְהֵ֖ם יִירָשֽׁוּהָּ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That at the Giving of the Torah, the effect from the Tree of Knowledge of Tov and Rah which had been acquired by Adam and Chava was removed from the nation of Israel. And in that <em><strong>40 day time period</strong></em> while Moshe was on Mount Sinai, <em>one of the four time categories for length of pregnancy mentioned in the Oral Torah</em>, children were conceived who did not have the quality of that mixture of Tov and Rah.

    "content": "# Cain feared death, married and had children with a woman because there were already other people in the world?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm new to the site.</p>\n<p>When Cain speaks to God, after killing his brother Hebel, Cain says, \"I will be wandering and nomadic in the land; whoever finds me will kill me!\"  (Bereshit 4:14), this imply that Cain knew that there were other men who could kill him?  Also in Bereshit says that Adam and Hava were the first two humans and generated Cain and Hebel, after Cain killed Abel, then says that Cain went to live in the land of Nod.  shortly afterwards it is reported that Cain met his wife.  From there, Cain started a family, the implication being that there were people in this \"land of Nod\".</p>\n<p>Where did the people from the land of Nod come from?  Cain feared death, married and had children with a woman because there were already other people in the world?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is possible that Adam and Eve had dozens of other humans to populate the world soon after creation. Although there is no proof that there were other humans during the time of Cain and Abel, the Bible often hides and does not reveal its secrets so that the reader can figure them out on their own. For example, we know that when Adam and Eve bore Seth Adam was 130 years old. And we know that the Bible does not always give a complete list of people's names. Adam and eve's genealogy is not complete. In Genesis 5, for example, the list only lists a single person from each generation, spanning from Adam to Noah. Similarly, chapter 10 only lists the male descendants of Noah, but not the females. It is possible that during those long 130 years, Adam had more offspring, male and female. The Bible only lists Seth because he was an ancestor of Abraham. Thus, the Bible not listing other people's names at the time of Adam and Eve is consistent and should not prompt us to think that other people did not exist at the time.</p>\n<p>Genesis 4:14 supports my interpretation. Cain says “whoever finds me will kill me.” If we accept the idea that there were other people besides his parents and Abel’s wife's, it makes sense that Cain would be afraid of these people. Also, Cain goes to 4:16 and “dwelt in the land of Nod.” If there weren't other people, why is there a land of Nod? He then builds a city. If only a small family existed, why build an empty city? This idea is supported by the fact that Cain and Abel had vocations. For example, Abel herded sheep and Cain tilled the soil. If there was only a small family, hunting would have been sufficient. Why herd sheep if not to feed an abundance of people.</p>\n<p>Lastly, in verse 1:26 G-d said “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” and in 2:7, “Then the L-rd G-d formed man of the dust of the ground.” We could understand “man” here as “humans” in the plural. In the Guide (part 1, chapter 7), Maimonides describes animals who resembled the physical features of Adam. In his book, the Science of G-d, Gerald Schroeder described these Homo sapiens (pre-Adam hominids who lacked a neshama) to be “human-looking creatures,” “animals with human shapes but lacking the neshama.” (See The science of G-d, at 123.) When the Mishna mentions the “masters of the field” it is denoting the pre-Adam people (who had the intelligence to perform the skills such as agriculture, 2000 before Adam).</p>\n\n\n",

You may not add to it or diminish from it,\" and [Deuteronomy 29:28] states: \"What is revealed is for us and our children forever, to carry out all the words of this Torah.\" This teaches that we are commanded to fulfill all the Torah's directives forever.\nIt is also said: \"It is an everlasting statute for all your generations,\" and [Deuteronomy 30:12] states: \"It is not in the heavens.\" This teaches that a prophet can no longer add a new precept [to the Torah].</p>\n<p>Therefore, if a person will arise, whether Jew or gentile, and perform a sign or wonder and say that God sent him to:</p>\n<p>a) add a mitzvah,</p>\n<p>b) withdraw a mitzvah</p>\n<p>c) explain a mitzvah in a manner which differs from the tradition received from Moses, or</p>\n<p>d) if he says that the mitzvot commanded to the Jews are not forever, but rather were given for a limited time,\nhe is a false prophet.

Judaism today is not Torah Judaism but Rabbinic Judaism. For example, we no longer practice sacrifices and slavery. Maimonides knew this.</p>\n<p>Menachem Kellner writes that Rambam did not accept all of his thirteen principles. When he wrote them, he wrote them for the masses. Maimonides wrote many essential truths. The eighth and ninth principles are an example.</p>\n<p>For example, when Rambam wrote that Moses's prophecy was above all others, this was written in order to combat the messiahship of Mohammed and Jesus.</p>\n<p>The Babylonian Talmud, Nidah 61b, shares the opinion of Rabbi Joseph: “The mitzvot [commandments] will be abolished in the time to come.” Fourteenth-century Rabbi Joseph Albo  writes that a future prophet could abolish or nullify all of the biblical commands except for the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments). See (Sefer Ha-ikkarim). Also, the fact that Rambam seems to suggests that we will not perform sacrifices in the future, indicates that how we interpret the Torah will change. Indeed, Rambam writes that if a Torah verses run counter to science, then we are to read it allegorically.</p>\n<p>Thus, Maimonides' \"thirteen principles of Judaism\" were mostly for the general population. He <em>only</em> accepted the first five, which deal with G-d. Jews should accept those first five principles literally.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(When I get more sources, I will add them).</p>\n\n\n",

I know of Rabbis who subscribe to Divine Command Theory -- the idea that \"moral\" is defined as \"that which Hashem commanded\". Which is pretty much the same thing as embracing the second horn of the dilemma. But most rishonim say things that imply they disagree. So instead, I will just give you what works for me -- <strong>a</strong> Jewish resolution.</p>\n<p>In the gemara, Rav Nachman bar Yitzchaq says \"גדולה עבירה לשמה ממצוה שלא לשמה -- a sin performed for the sake [of heaven] is greater than a mitzvah not done for its sake.\" ([Horiyos 10b], <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Horayot.10b.15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nazir.23b.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nazir 23b</a>) What this means, and how applicable it is in practice, are topics of much discussion.</p>\n<p>But I do not see how to combine that gemara with Divine Command Theory. It forces us to understand the \"pious only because it is loved by God\" horn of the dilemma to be about what is \"lishmah\" (for the proper sake) and not what is actually commanded.</p>\n<p>So, what answer to the Euthyphro dilemma do I personally like?</p>\n<p>I would argue that HQBH created the world with a tachlis, a purpose, He placed each of us in it with a tachlis, and what is righteous is righteous because it is in accordance with furthering that tachlis. This fits Rav Hirsch’s etymology for “ra“, being related to \\רעע, to shatter. It also explains why the word “tov” means both good in the moral sense (not evil) as well as in the functional sense (not ineffective, as in “a good toothpaste prevents cavities”). To prepare the menorah’s lamps is called “hatavas haneiros — causing the functional usability of the lamps.” Moral tov derives from the functional tov. Hashem chose “Do not steal” over “Take whatever makes you happy” because that’s what makes us better receptacles. We might have remained with two definitions of tov (and of “good”) — functional and moral. According to this line of reasoning, “good at its job” is the underlying meaning of tov in the moral sense of the word as well.</p>\n<p>So yes, HQBH did choose good vs evil without being subject to external constraint, and yet still the choice was not arbitrary. Socrates gave Euthyphro a false dichotomy — there was a third choice. Hashem has a reason, but that reason wasn’t conforming to a preexisting morality. It is consistency with the design choices when making the universe.</p>\n<p>One last issue: Why should I follow the purpose for which I was created? What changes G-d’s motivation into my moral imperative?</p>\n<p>We can prove the two are identical logically. In order for my moral choice to have any meaning, I must assume my actions have value. Otherwise, what difference does it make which actions I choose to perform? If I believe my actions have value, I am assuming my existence has value, since it makes those actions possible. And thus, presumed in the very quest for morality is the notion that the purpose for which I was created imparts value.</p>\n\n\n",

Who is this teacher and where did s/he give their reason? Thanks.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Moreh (or hamoreh, harav hamoreh, etc.) is usually a reference to Rambam, after his book Moreh Nevuchim. R. Yosef Ibn Kaspi frequently cites Rambam in his works. In this case we can indeed see that Rambam provides the reason for this commandment in Moreh Nevuchim 3:40 where he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The beneficial character of the law concerning \"the breaking of the neck of a heifer\" (Deut. xii. 1-8) is evident. For it is the city that is nearest to the slain person that brings the heifer, and in most cases the murderer comes from that place. The elders of the place call upon God as their witness, according to the interpretation of our Sages, that they have always kept the roads in good condition, have protected them, and have directed every one that asked his way; that the person has not been killed because they were careless in these general provisions, and they do not know who has slain him. As a rule the investigation, the procession of the elders, the measuring, and the taking of the heifer, make people talk about it, and by making the event public, the murderer may be found out, and he who knows of him, or has heard of him, or has discovered him by any due, will now name the person that is the murderer, and as soon as a man, or even a woman or handmaid, rises up and names a certain person as having committed the murder, the heifer is not killed. It is well known that it is considered great wickedness and guilt on the part of a person who knows the murderer, and is silent about him whilst the elders call upon God as witness that they know nothing about the murderer. Even a woman will, therefore, communicate whatever knowledge she has of him. When the murderer is discovered, the benefit of the law is apparent. If the court of justice cannot sentence him to death, the king may find him guilty, who has the power to sentence to death on circumstantial evidence; and if the ling does not put him to death, the avenger of blood may scheme and plan his death, and at last kill him. We have thus shown the use of the law concerning the breaking of the neck of the heifer in discovering the murderer. Force is added to the law by the rule that the place in which the neck of the heifer is broken should never be cultivated or sown. The owner of the land will therefore use all means in his power to search and to find the murderer, in order that the heifer be not killed and his land be not made useless to him.</p>\n<p>(Friedlander translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Reconciling Eliezer's beginnings\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am trying to make sense of Eliezer's beginnings / yichus. When I started writing this, a related question popped up <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1495/who-was-eliezers-father\">here</a> but perhaps we can develop it.</p>\n<p>On the one hand we are told in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.60.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 60:7</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹסֵי בֶּן רַבִּי דוֹסָא כְּנַעַן הוּא אֱלִיעֶזֶר, וְעַל יְדֵי שֶׁשֵּׁרַת אוֹתוֹ צַדִּיק בֶּאֱמוּנָה יָצָא מִכְּלַל אָרוּר לִכְלַל בָּרוּךְ.</p>\n<p><em>Rabbi Yose son of Rabbi Dosa said that Canaan (the son of Cham) was Eliezer and through serving the righteous man (Avraham) with faith, he went from being cursed to being blessed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.16.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer 16</a> says quite clearly that upon Avraham surviving being thrown into the furnace Nimrod gifted his own son, Eliezer to Avraham as a servant.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.765.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni 765</a> says expressly that Og (the giant) is Eliezer.</p>\n<p><strong>So the question is - is there a way to reconcile these differing views. Does anywhere provide a chronology of events that helps to frame his development.</strong></p>\n<p>There is the beginnings of a possible mehalach which I will suggest now but there are several potential flaws for it to work completely thus making me more confused.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Targum_Jonathan_on_Genesis.14.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Yonasan, Bereishis 14:13</a> notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>And Og came, who had been spared from the giants that died in the deluge, and had ridden protected upon the top of the ark, and sustained with food by Noah; not being spared through high righteousness, but that the inhabitants of the world might see the power of the Lord, and say, Were there not giants who in the first times rebelled against the Lord of the world, and perished from the earth? But when these kings made war, behold, Og, who was with them, said in his heart, I will go and show Abram concerning Lot, who is led captive, that he may come and deliver him from the hands of the kings into whose hands he has been delivered. And he arose and came, upon the eve of the day of the Pascha, and found him making the unleavened cakes. Then showed he to Abram the Hebrew, who dwelt in the valleys of Mamre Amoraah, brother of Eshkol and brother of Aner, who were men of covenant with Abram.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So stage 1: Og, aka the grandson of Noach (i.e. Canaan), survives the flood and meets Avraham. The flaw with this though, is firstly, do we know if Cham had a child when the mabul started, and if so, wouldn't he have made it on to the teiva. Now admittedly, one could argue that if his child happened to be a giant(!) that would make sense why Noach let him hitch a ride on the Ark and gave him food, but this would mean that he grew up away from Nimrod, so did Nimrod adopt him later? And how do we rectify this interaction with Avraham, the implication is that they haven't met yet which clashes with the Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer which says that Nimrod gave him over to Avraham. Did they have dealings before he was given over into Avraham's service.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile in the following <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Targum_Jonathan_on_Genesis.14.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Yonasan 14:14</a> it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>And when Abram heard that his brother was made captive, he armed his young men who were trained for war, grown up in his house; but they willed not to go with him. And he chose from them Eliezer the son of Nimrod, who was equal in strength to all the three hundred and eighteen; and he pursued unto Dan.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So here, he is clearly identified as the son of Nimrod, and if we say he is equal in strength to so many people that would make sense as he was a giant, but again the implication is that he was not in Avraham's service yet.</p>\n<p>So in short, are we to conclude that he started as grandson of Noach, grabbed a ride on the Ark and was fed by Noach, some how ended up with a relationship of sorts with Nimrod that warranted the classification of 'father' and was then given over into Avraham's service although had had several interactions prior?</p>\n<p>Any sources that help make sense of this would be very much appreciated!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Thank you to @Lanied_Sofey for showing me the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.38?lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Da%27at_Zekenim_on_Genesis.24.39.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Da'as Zekeinim on Bereishis 24:38</a></p>\n<p>It writes there clearly, that they were possibly two different Eliezer's and therefore not such a discrepancy.</p>\n<p>My translation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“אֵלַי לֹא תֵלֵךְ הָאִשָּׁה” – \"Perhaps the woman will not want to come with me\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.39?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.24.39.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> explains that the word \"אֵלַי\" (to me) is written deficiently (without a vav) in order to allow for a derash (interpretation): that Eliezer had a daughter and was hinting that perhaps Avraham would agree to let Yitzchak marry her.</p>\n<p>And it is difficult (i.e., a question arises), because Rabbi Shlomo (Rashi himself) also explains on the verse \"you will be released from my oath\" that Eliezer was hoping Avraham would take a wife for Yitzchak from the daughters of Aner, Eshkol, or Mamre—but they were Canaanites!

And Eliezer swore: “So shall you live and enter Gan Eden — just as you are innocent in this matter.” That blessing was fulfilled, and he entered Gan Eden alive.</p>\n<p><strong>ששני עוג מלך הבשן היו אחד רשע שהרגו משה ואחד שהיה עבד ומלך וכשמלך נקרא שמו עוג כי כל מלכי הבשן נקראים עוג כמו שמצינו בכל מלכי מצרים שנקראין פרעה</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We must say, then, that there were two people named Og, king of Bashan:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>One was the wicked one whom Moshe killed;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The other was Eliezer, who had been a slave and was later made a king.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And when he became king, he was called Og, because all kings of Bashan were called “Og”, just as we find all kings of Egypt were called “Pharaoh.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He explained that the exile of the ten tribes is a divine decree that will not be rescinded until the messianic era. Even knowing their whereabouts would already be a measure of reunification, and G‑d has decreed that there not be reunification until the time of the final redemption. In other words, ultimately it is G‑d’s decree that is holding us back from discovering the ten lost tribes.</p>\n<p>Would anyone be able to provide the actual source of this teaching from the Maharal of Prague with the exact quotes in Hebrew and English?

Therefore, one must say that that which Rabbi Elazar said that the ten tribes are destined to return, the meaning is that they will return in the future along with the rest of the exiles [i.e. they are all already mixed in among the exiled kingdom of Judah].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I have not learned through that whole chapter, but what I have seen in פרק לד is that the Maharal writes (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42854&st=&pgnum=114\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42854&st=&pgnum=114</a>) that some people claim that since there have been travellers all over the world and they have not found the סמבטיון and the people living there, the story can’t be true.

Despite extensive searches over the course of three decades, Dakar's wreckage was not found until 1999, when it was located between the islands of Cyprus and Crete, an area where the submarine was known to be when it went missing and where many efforts had been made to locate her!

These gifts are truly a cause to praise God because <strong>they serve as constant reminders to remain loyal to Him, and are thus the 'angels' which God has assigned to protect those who fear him.</strong> (ibid.; Rambam, Hil. Mezuzah 6:13).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Is a Mezuzah really considered an Angel?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I wouldn't call the Mezuzah an angel as it is not a spiritual being.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Tefillin%2C_Mezuzah_and_the_Torah_Scroll.6.13?lang=bi&with=Kiryat%20Sefer&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiryat Sefer</a> on the above cited Rambam writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל מי שיש לו תפילין בראשו ובזרועו וציצית בבגדו ומזוזה בפתחו מוחזק הוא שלא יחטא שיש לו מזכירים רבים והם המלאכים המצילים אותו מלחטוא שנאמר חונה מלאך ה' סביב ליראיו ויחלצם:</p>\n<p><em>All those who have tefillin on his head and forearm, and Tzitzis on his garment and a mezuzah on his door, strengthens him so that he does not sin, <strong>so that he has many reminders and they are the messengers that save him from sinning</strong> as it says \"The angel of G-d camps around those who fear Him and protects them.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, I think it would perhaps be fair to view these articles as more of a G-d send (messengers and not angels), a heavenly reminder to act in the correct way befitting a Jew.</p>\n<p>One has to be careful not to make the Mezuzah into an object that one views purely as a protective amulet and forget the source of our ultimate protection - G-d. Indeed the Rambam (Maimonides) writes earlier against this sort of belief.</p>\n<p>He writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Tefillin%2C_Mezuzah_and_the_Torah_Scroll.5.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Mezuzah 5:4</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>It is a common custom to write [God's name,] Shad-dai, on the outside of a mezuzah opposite the empty space left between the two passages. There is no difficulty in this, since [the addition is made] outside.</em></p>\n<p><em>Those, however, who write the names of angels, other sacred names, verses, or forms, on the inside [of a mezuzah] are among those who do not have a portion in the world to come. Not only do these fools nullify the mitzvah, but furthermore, they make from a great mitzvah [which reflects] the unity of the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, the love of Him, and the service of Him, a talisman for their own benefit. They, in their foolish conception, think that this will help them regarding the vanities of the world.</em>\n(Touger Translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in conclusion, we view the mezuzah as a clear visual reminder to act in the correct manner, knowing that if we do, Hashem (and no-one else) will protect and help us.</p>\n\n\n",

In other words, that these verses together tell one (a complete) story. But what if they are to be viewed separately? What if Cham sees Noach after he gets drunk and falls asleep, and then asks his brothers for help and puts him to rest elsewhere? When Noah wakes up at a later time, however, (it appears as if) something has happened in the meantime that Noah is aware of . And although the story in such a case does not record what happened, it becomes clear that Canaan has something to do with it, and this could be a good reason why Noach curses Canaan and not Cham.</p>\n<p>Could the story be understood in such a way?</p>\n<p>P.s. If not, does the grammar used to tell the story provide any solution to get out of the Cham who saw the nakedness of Noach, and Canaan ending up being the one cursed by Noach, situation? Is it possible for example to read a verse like 9:22 as: \"And Cham saw his father, Canaan the nakedness of his forefather, and he (Cham or Canaan) went out to tell his brethren outside (or out in the open).\"</p>\n<p>I already looked at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/13276/why-did-noach-curse-canaan-and-not-cham\">another question</a>, but I'm not so much looking for commentaries/interpretations which add to the text, I'm rather looking for options within grammar or punctuation which helps us understand the context in another way; For example the wording 'nakedness of his father' is sometimes taken literally (Noach being naked) but also often in the way it is described elsewhere such as Leviticus 18:8, 20:11 and Deuteronomy 27:20 (refering to some sort of incest, thus the nakedness of the wife of Noach), which makes it possible to read the exact same verse in a totally different way.</p>\n\n\n",

Hence, adding the words \"with a flood\" to what God says to Noah must be significant.

Whenever the Bible repeats or adds a word, it must be there to teach a lesson.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Ishmael disagreed. He felt that “the Torah [which is intended for humans] speaks in human language.” Thus, the Torah repeats itself for emphasis to make a point. It may even do so to make a flowery or poetic point. We should not read anything new into these repetitions (which are many). If G-d intended to teach an additional lesson, it would not be hidden in repetition, it would have been an explicit statement.</p>\n<p>Referring to your question with Rabbi Ishmael's view shows that nothing is being added. Genesis 8:21 and 9:11 says the same thing. G-d will not destroy the world again. There is no difference at all between those two verses.</p>\n\n\n",

Some texts will use modern quotation marks to set off quotations, just like in English.</li>\n<li><strong>Parentheses/Brackets:</strong> In many cases, parentheses are used to indicate text that someone thought was mistaken, and brackets are used to indicate text that the printer thought should be inserted (sometimes instead of the parenthetical words). In other texts, parentheses are used for parenthetical comments, like in English, and in other texts, brackets are used to set off more technical comments, or longer digressions.</li>\n<li><strong>Bold/Italic:</strong> Bold text is common in commentaries to set off quoted text from the text in question from the commentary. I'm not sure about italics.</li>\n<li><strong>Font sizes:</strong> Smaller font size is sometimes used to indicate a citation (often Biblical). This is usually unnecessary, but can be a nice graphical feature. Larger font can be used as the bold text is used, and sometimes in conjunction.</li>\n<li><strong>Hyphens:</strong> Some dashes might be used as they're used in English. Sometimes a hyphen will be used instead of <code>־</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And there are many more uses of each of these tools than I listed above.</p>\n\n\n",

Now this is nothing new, but prayer has often been somewhat a safe haven from this, but now the floodgates have opened and I'm struggling to shut them back up.</p>\n<p>Basically the thoughts are getting so bad that I struggle to even pray sometimes, and doing so has became distressing in itself because of it. In particular (and as I asked please do not judge, as these thoughts are in opposition to myself and character) I keep getting images stuck in my mind of idols, sexual acts and sights, gruesome images and even outright blasphemy against HaShem (may he forgive and have mercy upon me).</p>\n<p>It has gotten to the point where I have even started to worry that my prayer is invalid because of this, worthless even. Perhaps I'm being irrational, but aside from constantly breaking my Kavanah, I feel like my words and actions are ruined and defiled by these thoughts, to the point where I wonder if I should even bother. My joy has become my sorrow.</p>\n<p>Anyway apologies for the lack of any actual question yet, so what I would like to ask is basically what should I do? I understand these thoughts are out of my control and that surely HaShem knows and understands this also, but I still can't shake that feeling of worthlessness, shame and even wrongdoing because of them.</p>\n<p>My intent and thoughts are obviously not one and the same, but how can one maintain Kavanah with such evil plaguing his mind? I can barely even focus on the words at times.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry if this is not the most clear or appropriate question, but I didn't know where else I should ask. My condition is quite embarrassing for me, and I do feel great shame in having it never mind talking about it, especially this.</p>\n<p>Thank you for any help and/or advice, it's greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Firstly, I wish you strength to get through this ordeal. I am certain that Hashem knows your intentions are good and He only gives tests to those who He knows can pass them.</p>\n<p>There is quite a dearth of material online that can help provide an effective approach to dealing with this situation. I have taken a couple of these and tried to weave them into an effective response.</p>\n<p>By way of introduction, it is worth noting that what you are experiencing is not inhuman, it is the Yetzer Hara (the evil inclination) taking an active role. As these thoughts become ever more pervasive, the more you dwell on them, the more the thoughts will take a stronghold in your mind.</p>\n<p>To quote an excerpt from an article on Chabad <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/544790/jewish/How-do-I-rid-myself-of-inappropriate-thoughts.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>When you fight against your own thoughts, you only engrave them deeper in your neurons. It's something like struggling against quicksand, which serves only to dig you in deeper and deeper.</em></p>\n<p><em>So as long as you are chastising yourself for your thoughts, trying to determine where they come from, trying to convince yourself more and more how bad they are for you and even just remarking to yourself \"why is this happening now?\"--all you are doing is burning those thoughts further into the woodwork of your mind.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the question is, how best to combat them?</p>\n<p>The Aish website writes <a href=\"https://www.aish.com/sp/pg/48891282.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>How do we allow negative thoughts to leave our mind?</em></p>\n<p><em>One of the great Jewish leaders in Israel, Rabbi Yaakov Kanievsky, provided an answer in a letter to one of his students.</em></p>\n<p><em>He wrote, \"There is only one solution to this issue: distract yourself. The more you focus on preventing those thoughts, the more frequently they will invade your mind…it is a well known fact that a person can only concentrate on one thought at a time. Therefore, distract yourself with another thought and the dark, provocative thought will disappear…\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So with this in mind (excuse the pun!), if you are struggling during your davening, you might want to work on making tefilla truly meaningful. For example, if you take some time to learn the translation of the words and the inner meanings of what you say, if you concentrate on this when you daven, it will help to focus your thought process as you can only think about one thing at one time. Therefore, if we fill our minds with alternative thoughts there is less room for the destructive ones to enter.</p>\n<p>Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.51.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevuchim 3:51</a> shows us the mechanics of the thought process and Hashem's resulting response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>I have shown you that the intellect which emanates from G-d unto us is the link that joins us to G-d</strong>. You have it in your power to strengthen that bond, if you choose to do so, or to weaken it gradually, till it breaks if you prefer this. It will only become strong when you employ it in the love of G-d, and seek that love: it will be weakened when you direct your thoughts to other things. You must know that even if you were the wisest man in respect to the true knowledge of G-d, you break the bond between you and G-d whenever you turn entirely your thoughts to the necessary food or any necessary business; you are then not with G-d, and He is not with you: for that relation between you and Him is actually interrupted in those moments.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, if you make tefillah something that you can really relate to, such that you can focus on it thoroughly when praying, you can be rest assured that Hashem will be there to help you.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you could try arriving before davening begins and try and relax your mind so that you feel in a state of calm to begin davening in the right frame of mind. This is something that Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.4.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Hilchos Tefillah 4:16</a>) advises:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>What is to be understood by concentration of the mind? The mind should be freed from all extraneous thoughts and the one who prays should realize that he is standing before the Divine Presence. He should therefore sit awhile before beginning his prayers, so as to concentrate his mind, and then pray in gentle tones, beseechingly, and not regard the service as a burden which he is carrying and which he will cast off and proceed on his way. He should, accordingly, also sit awhile, after concluding the prayers, and then leave. The ancient saints were wont to pause and meditate one hour before the service, one hour after the service and take one hour in its recital.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All I can say is that I wish you much hatzlocho and the inner strength to get through it all. You are already half way there by acknowledging that it needs to be helped.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As far as how to maintain kavanah, that is tricky to answer. It would be easy to throw out some cliches and sources as advice but OCD is not an easy thing and to downplay it is not right.</p>\n<p>What might help is to know that there are many sources who say that the reward for a mitzvah is weighed by the amount of effort is needed to do it. <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%94_%D7%9B%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> is one such source. Sorry, it is in Hebrew.</p>\n<p>So for what it is worth, your attempt to pray in the best way you can, given your challenge, is very admirable and there is no doubt that the One who gave your your challenge is much aware of it and takes it heavily into consideration.</p>\n<p>Even if you manage to pray properly for a short moment, it is a great accomplishment and hopefully should only cause joy.</p>\n<p>BTW, it is safe to say that most experience inappropriate thoughts of all kinds during prayer at one time or another, we're all human, how we deal with it is what can make us great.</p>\n<p>Good luck</p>\n\n\n",

So he wasn't unclothed. Some meforshim (on that pasuk) that I am referring to are the Mitzudas David, Perush Rabbeinu Yeshaya and Rashi.</p>\n<p>Two meforshim that seem to agree to the straight translation of Shaul not being clothed, offer the explanation that, due to the prophecy, Shaul was in such a heightened state of mind that he no longer related to the mundane of being clothed or simply couldn't relate to it anymore. He was in an intellectual existence where bodily matters, like being clothed, was a foreign, irrelevant concept. The two meforshim (on that pasuk) are the Radak and Malbim.</p>\n<p>As an aside, your question seems to be based on the halachah that one should not be undressed, even in private, for no reason as one is always in the presence of Hashem.

Thus the letters of \"עין\" (\"eye\") can be rearranged / turned upside down to read \"עני\" (\"poor\"), since she made him in poor in these areas.</em></p>\n<p><em>And it mentions three things (that she weakened him in)- \"<strong>מַ</strong>עֲשָׂיו <strong>כֹּ</strong>חוֹ <strong>לִ</strong>בּוֹ\" - \"his deeds, his strength and his heart\", and the roshei teivos (the first letter of each word) can be arranged to spell \"מלך\" - \"King\", and his role was that of judge which was in place of a king at that time, and she weakened him in three areas where he lost his sense of virtue and dominion.

    "content": "# What is the source for one sixtieth?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The rule of bitul one sixtieth or sleep one sixtieth death or dreams one sixtieth prophecy: How did we arrive at one sixtieth as the measurement?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is not a direct answer to the question, but I think it's important to point out that 1/60 is far from the only \"small fraction\" mentioned in the Sources, so one should not jump to the conclusion that the Sages made it up.  We may not always know their reasons, but they did mention a lot of <em>precise</em> small fractions other than 1/60.  A <em>very</em> quick analysis:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1/40 and 1/50 in connection to Terumah [Bechorot 61a, Terumot 4:3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to Beit Hillel (Terumot 4:3), one showing a “good eye,” i.e. a generous\nperson, gives 1/40 of his produce as terumah to the Kohen and a bad-eyed person, i.e. a stingy person, gives 1/60 of the produce. Thus, the difference between the two people is one-third. Beit Shammai says that a “good eye” gives 1/30, and a “bad eye” gives one-1/50; thus, the difference is 2/5.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much is this little more? 1/20 of an egg. [Eruvin 83a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tzedakah must be between 1/10 and 1/5 of income.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A large step takes away 1/500 of a person’s eyesight. [Berakhot 43b, Shabbat 113b, Taanit 10b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If one carries a perforated flower-pot in a vineyard, if it increased by 1/200, it is forbidden. [Kelayim 7:8]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Three things increase one’s waste, bend his stature, and remove 1/500 of the light of a person’s eyes. [Eruvin 55b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a thief sold a stolen animal in a partial fashion, e.g., except for 1/100 of it, which he kept for himself... [Bava Kamma 78b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a man fails to give him even 1/100 of his portion, let him realize that he is stealing it, not from the priestly tribe, but from Me. [Tanchuma, Terumah 4:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The number of nations are 1/70 of the number of beasts that populate the earth. The number of fourlegged red blooded beasts on earth are 1/70 of the number of species of birds. The species of birds amount to 1/70 of the species of fish, which in turn are 1/70 of the number of different malignant forces, evil spirits, which in turn are 1/70 of the number of angels in heaven. [Chizkuni on Deut. 6:4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He must give the buyer additional amounts [geirumin], an additional 1/10 in the case of liquids sold by weight, and an additional 1/20 in the case of dry goods. [Bava Batra 5:11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1/320 of the pool. [Mikvaot 6:11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>They are not all the same thing. I am bring a source for the 1/60 batul beshishim as you referred to as \"bitul\". The concept is if a taste is diluted sixty times, it won't be detected anymore. The source for that is in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chullin.98a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chulin 98a</a>. The korban shlamim for the nazir was eaten by a non-kohen except for the foreleg that went to the kohen. The concept of \"taste being nullified\" is shown here since a non-kohen may not eat from the fore leg but yet the whole animal was cooked together. So we see that the taste in the rest of the animal was nullified as otherwise the meat of the rest of the animal would be ossur to a non-kohen. The amoraim in that gemora argue whether one does not need to include the bones in calculating the nullifying the taste so really one needs 100x the taste (foreleg meat) or with the bones so it works out to be 60x (the meat and bones of the foreleg against the rest of the meat and bones of the animal). We hold like the latter.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Being a \"son of God\" among \"sons of God\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During the course of Hashem's explanation of his relationship to the Children of Israel, he likens them to his child:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.31.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 31:9</a> \"כִּֽי־הָיִ֤יתִי לְיִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לְאָ֔ב וְאֶפְרַ֖יִם בְּכֹ֥רִי הֽוּא\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.4.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sh'mot 4:22</a> \"בְּנִ֥י בְכֹרִ֖י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.11.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hoshe'a 11:1</a> \"וּמִמִּצְרַ֖יִם קָרָ֥אתִי לִבְנִֽי\"</p>\n<p>But in addition, the text explicitly names Shlomo and David as individual \"sons\" of God (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.22.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1, 22:10</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.7.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmu'el 2, 7:14</a>).</p>\n<p>As they are included among the nation, they would already be thought of as \"sons of God\" (in that metaphorical sense). What is added to the understanding of them, or what is unique in their character that they are singled out as named sons, beyond their status as sons by being of the nation?</p>\n<p>They were prophets, unlike other kings, but not every prophet was named a son of God. They ruled over a united nation, but does this earn them the nickname? What do commentators explain this special designation as meaning, as compared to the similar baseline status which falls on the entire nation?</p>\n<p>(failing on tags...help appreciated)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps a mehalach working off the mefarshim could be as follows: Both Dovid and Shlomo were Kings over the Jewish people and also prophets like you assert. It is precisely this point that meant they had a level of responsibility that went above and beyond the normal leader as they were not only there to rule over the people, but to act as an intermediary between them and Hashem. Thus, unlike the Jewish people whose father-son relationship is one of a merciful father who is always seeking the best for His child, in the case of David and Shlomo, it was to ensure that they acted as correct leaders should as their descendants would follow the example set before them. In the same way that if a son acts out of line, they have to deal with the repercussions, Dovid and Shlomo needed to be aware that their leadership would likewise have a big impact if not conducted in the correct manner.</p>\n<p>So, by Dovid in Shmuel II 7:14, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.7.14?lang=bi&p2=Malbim_on_II_Samuel.7.14.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> writes about the relationship:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אני אהיה לו לאב וכו' אשר בהעותו</strong>, שישגיח עליו בחמלתו כאב על בנו שתיכף שיתחיל להעוות דרכו תיכף יוכיחהו וישיבהו לדרך הטוב בענין שלא יניחהו להתמוטט בשיעור שיסיר אמונתו ממנו, ודייק לאמר שהוא יהיה לו לאב תחלה ועל ידי כן יהיה הוא לי לבן לא בהפך, כי כל עובד את ה' מאהבה נחשב לה' כבן מצד מעשיו, אבל כשישוב צדיק מצדקו לא יקרא עוד בן רק עבד פושע באדוניו, אבל פה אני אהיה לו לאב תחלה, שלא בהשקף על מעשיו רק כאב טבעי, שמה שהוא לאב קודם אל מה שהוא לו לבן, ומצד זה אשגיח שאהיה לו תמיד לאב ושלא יבא לידי חטאים גדולים כי תיכף בהעותו והוכחתיו...</p>\n<p><em><strong>I will be a father to him...when he does wrong etc.</strong></em> - <em>i.e. <strong>that He will administer over him with compassion like a father for his son that immediately if he begins to do wrong his (a father's) way is to immediately rebuke him and bring him back to the good path, so that a (positive opportunity for a) lesson will not collapse and he will (G-d forbid) remove his faith from him</strong>. And it was particular to mention first that \"He will be to him as a father\" since only through this can he then \"be a son to Me\", and not the other way round. Because all those who serve Hashem from love is considered to Hashem to be like a son from the point of his actions, but when a righteous person reverts from his righteous ways, he is no longer called a son, but rather only a servant who was negligent towards his master. But here \"I will be to him as a father\" comes first, not in light of his actions but only as a natural father, as He is to him a father first and foremost before him being a son. And from this perspective, I will watch over and always be for him a father so that he doesn't come to any big sins as straight away when he does wrong I have rebuked him...</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in the same way a father, watches over his son to see that they act in the proper manner this was the expectation of G-d to Dovid. With Hashem always there, Dovid had to earn the respect.</p>\n<p>A similar approach can be adopted when looking at the pasuk in Divrei HaYamim I 22:10 with Shlomo.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.22.10?lang=bi&p2=Chomat_Anakh_on_I_Chronicles.22.10.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chidah</a> on the pasuk writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>והוא יהיה לי לבן ואני אהיה לו לאב.</strong> כי בתחילה צריך התעוררות מלמטה ואח\"כ אמר ה' פתחו לי פתח וכו' ולזה אמר הוא יהיה לי לבן שיכין עצמו להיות לבן ולעבוד עבודה כל מצות האב ואז אני אהיה לו לאב:</p>\n<p><em><strong>And he shall be a son to Me and I to him a father</strong></em> - <em>Because first you need an awakening from below and after that Hashem says \"Open for Me an entrance etc.\" And this is why it says, \"he shall be a son to me\" as he first has to prepare himself to be a son and to engage in the service of all Mitzvos (commands) of the father, and then \"I will be to him as a father\".</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.22.10?lang=bi&p2=Malbim_on_I_Chronicles.22.10.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> here, cross-references the pasuk brought by Dovid to reiterate the point.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>הוא יהיה לי לבן.</strong> הוא מ\"ש לו (ש\"ב ז, יד - טו) אני אהיה לו לאב והוא יהיה לי לבן אשר בהעותו והוכחתיו בשבט אנשים וכו' וחסדי לא אפיר מעמו, שבארתי שם שהבטיח לו שישגיח עליו בל יתמוטט מצדקתו עד שיופסק החסד מעמו, כי יוכיחהו תכף בהעותו וישיבהו אל הטוב, וז\"ש ע\"י שאהיה לו לאב עי\"כ <strong>והכינותי את כסא מלכותו עד עולם</strong>, וגם ר\"ל שע\"י שיבנה הבית עי\"כ אכין מלכותו עד עולם, וכמו שבארתי (תהלות סי' קלב) שע\"י שבחר ה' בציון עי\"כ תתקיים גם מלכות דוד לעולם...</p>\n<p><em><strong>He shall be a son to Me</strong></em> - <em>As it writes (in Shmuel II 4:14-15) \"I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to Me. When he does wrong, I will chastise him with the rod of men etc.\" (meaning) and My kindness is not dimmed from His people. As I explained there, it was a promise to him (Dovid) that He (Hashem) would watch over him so that he wouldn't fall from his righteousness until the mercy of His people stops, because He immediately rebukes him when he does wrong and brings him back to the good, and that is what is meant that \"I will be a father to him\".</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>And I will establish his throne of kingship forever</strong></em> - <em>And similarly it means that through building the Temple, I will establish his kingship forever. Like I explained, that just as Hashem chose Zion, He will establish the kingship of Dovid forever...</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

We're physical beings and we're discussing spiritual rewards and punishments. There's no way we can get our head around it.

In fact, without doing a rigorous count, my impression skimming over the Concordance list is that this sense of the word is much more common in the Torah than the sense of \"seed of a plant.\" \"Semen\" is represented as \"שִׁכְבַת זָרַע,\" but not, that I could find, as plain \"זָרַע,\" which would seem to indicate that the phrase \"שִׁכְבַת זָרַע\" is a conceptual extension of the idea of \"child\" or \"descendant\" - \"flow that creates a child.\" Similarly, it would be reasonable to see the \"seed of a plant\" sense as another physical extension of this concept of \"descendant.\"</p>\n<p>Therefore, in the context you cite (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.60?lang=bi&with=Onkelos%20Genesis&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 24:60</a>), I would recommend that \"progeny\" would be a more fitting translation than \"seed.\" Traditional support for this choice can be found in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkelos\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Onkelos</a> on the spot, which translates \"זַרְעֵךְ\" as \"בְּנַיְכִי\" - \"your children.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your assumption that זרע only means semen isn't correct even in terms of simple biology. A better translation would perhaps be <em>gamete</em> which can be either from the male or the female in terms of <em>offspring</em>. And this is actually how the concept is related in the Oral Torah like <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.31a.23?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah 31a</a> which says in the name of Rabbi Yitzchok quoting Rabbi Immi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי יצחק אמר רבי אמי אשה מזרעת תחילה יולדת זכר איש מזריע תחילה יולדת נקבה שנאמר (ויקרא יג, כט) אשה כי תזריע וילדה זכר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>The posuk you are quoting is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְבָרֲכ֤וּ אֶת־רִבְקָה֙ וַיֹּ֣אמְרוּ לָ֔הּ אֲחֹתֵ֕נוּ אַ֥תְּ הֲיִ֖י לְאַלְפֵ֣י רְבָבָ֑ה <strong>וְיִירַ֣שׁ זַרְעֵ֔ךְ</strong> אֵ֖ת שַׁ֥עַר שֹׂנְאָֽיו׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this case, its plain meaning is descendants, not sperm or seed. See, for example, the explanations of Rashi and Sforno who explain that it is the same way that G-d promised Avraham about his descendents.</p>\n<p>However, if you are looking for additional, deeper insights, consider what Rabbi Yaacov Tzvi Yolles explains in Sefer Kehilat Yaacov where it says:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=102&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">זרע הוא סוד המתקת ק״ך צרופי אלהים על-ידי ס״ג</a></p>\n<p>. This is also relating to the kabbalistic concept of <em>sweetening</em> and <em>converting</em> the harsh and bitter judgements via what are called the <em>feminine brains</em> (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=163\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מוחין דנקבה</a> 63 <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=199\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ס״ג</a>).</p>\n<p>That in general, the source of the gamete is from the brains as it is discussed in the Torah literature. And so in the context of the posuk from the Torah, the <em>Gates of His enemies</em> is referring to those harsh and bitter judgements which will be sweetened via the feminine intellect which is associated here with Rivkah.</p>\n<p>But it is important to note that this is only when Rivkah is joined with her husband, Yitzchok like is emphasized by Rabbi Yolles beginning with the words:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=257&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>רבקה</strong> המלכות נקראת כן אמנם לא תקרא כן אלא מצד תוקף ומתייחדת עם דודה כו׳</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch does indeed translates the word זרעך as <em>descendants</em>. The term זרע is used as the idiom for the offspring or that which causes offspring to to arise. An idiom is not taken literally and in any case this particular idiom does not refer solely to the male source of offspring (sperm).</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Rabbi Simeon Bar Yochai claiming Metatron to be divine?",
    "content": "# Rabbi Simeon Bar Yochai claiming Metatron to be divine?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Today I was confronted with a quotation from Rabbi Simeon Bar Yochai, commenting on the Zohar:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a perfect man, who is an messenger, this messenger is Metatron, the keeper of Israel; he is a man in the image of the Holy One, blessed be He, who is an <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5717\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">emanation</a> from Him; yea, He is HaShem; of him cannot be said, He is created, formed or made; but he is the emanation from G-d. This agrees with what was written in Jeremiah 23:5-6 of the sprout from David, that though he shall be a perfect man, yet he is ‘the Lord our Righteousness’ - Rabbi Simeon Bar Yochai. The Propositions of the Zohar.cap 38, Amsterdam Edition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This sounds like blasphemy to me, but maybe I misunderstood because of the translation.</p>\n<p>What does Rabbi Yochai means when he says ‘man who is an messenger (angel)’, ‘in the image of the Holy One’, ‘an emanation from Him’, ‘not created, formed or made’ and ‘he shall be a perfect man, yet he is the Lord our Righteousness’.</p>\n<p>I’m trying to understand where his words are coming from, how I should understand his words and what he meant to say when he wrote these things.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <em>passuk</em> says at the Akeida</p>\n<p>וַיִּקְרָ֨א אֵלָ֜יו מַלְאַ֤ךְ יְהֹוָה֙ מִן־הַשָּׁמַ֔יִם וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אַבְרָהָ֣ם ׀ אַבְרָהָ֑ם וַיֹּ֖אמֶר הִנֵּֽנִי׃</p>\n<p>And an angel of Hashem called him from the heavens and he said, \"Avraham, Avraham.\" And He said, \"Here I am.\"</p>\n<p>The Zohar says that the reason Avraham's name appears twice is because this represents the two elements of the soul, one element remains in the supernal spheres and one element descends to this world.</p>\n<p>There is a <em>pesik</em> between the two names of Avraham to denote that there was not perfect unity between these two elements, as opposed to what we find with Moshe (at the burning bush) where there isn't, because there was.</p>\n<p>The mekubalim further explain that the reference to the angel of Hashem in the beginning of the passuk is a reference to Avraham himself, i.e. Avraham called to Avraham. I.e. the <em>hisorerus nevuah</em> was experienced by the supernal element of Avraham's neshama and from there was communicated to Avraham's worldly <em>neshama</em>.</p>\n<p>At any rate it is evident according to this explanation, that when the passuk refers to a malach, it can mean the person themselves. (See also Reb Tzadok on the passuk <em>ve'kol adam lo yiheye be'ohel moed</em> who says that this includes the <em>cohen gadol</em>.)</p>\n<p>Subsequently it is possible to understand the references that you quote in light of the saying of the Zohar, *kudsha brich hu ve'yisrael ve'oraysah chad hu' - Hashem, the benei yisrael and the Torah are one.</p>\n<p>I.e. a description of the emanation of a malach is actually a description of the emanation of the neshama. (Which explanation then merges with @Al Berko's first comment.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The quotation you cited is not from Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai. It is rather the words of Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh ben Yakov in his commentary on the Zohar  known as the <em>Chemads Tzvi</em> included in the <em>Shiv'im Tikunei ha-Zohar</em> or the Tikunim, a central text of Kabbalah. The following is the original Hebrew with my own translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואיה אדם ראית אדם דאיהו מלאך ודא מטטרון ואית אדם בדיוקנא דקנ\"ת ראיהו\nאצילותיה ורא יור הא ואו הא ולית ביה בריאה ויצירה ועשיה אלא אצילותא</p>\n<p>Where have you seen the man (vayah adom) who is actually an angel?\nThis [angel]\nis certainly Metatron. He is a man in the image of\nd’knet? His vision is the emanation (azulah) of G-d. Behold the light,\nlook at the awesome light of Havaya [G-d]. In it there is no creation\n(bariah), formation (yetzirah), or action (assiah), only an emanation\n(azulah) of G-d. (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sefer_%C5%A1iv_im_tikunej_ha_Zohar/Sy5fAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%D7%95%D7%90%D7%99%D7%AA%20%D7%90%D7%93%D7%9D%20%D7%93%D7%90%D7%99%D7%AA%20%D7%90%D7%93%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%90%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%20%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%9A%20%D7%95%D7%93%D7%90%20%D7%9E%D7%98%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F&pg=RA12-PA8&printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here we see that Metatron is said to be a man (adom) who is also an angel and experiences the light of G-d. This is in reference to Enoch who was translated into heaven and transformed in Metatron, an idea can be seen in other Jewish mystical texts such as 3 Enoch. Adom could very well also be an allusion to Metatron as the manifestation of the Adam Kadmon, the highest of the five worlds of Kabbalah.</p>\n<p>During Enoch’s translation, he is taken into the atzulah, the world of emanation which is higher than the worlds of creation (bariya), formation (yetzirah), and action (assiah), since all other realms leading up to the azulah are said to be the body of Metatron.</p>\n<p>I am unsure how exactly to translate the word דקנ”ת (d''knet). I am tempted to say that it has something to do with the דתקנתא, the knesset yisrael or the community of Israel, a common theme in Kabbalah. Or perhaps it refers to the image of G-d, which is how your translation reads.</p>\n<p>It’s certainly a fascinating quote, especially when one understands key concepts within the rich theology of Kabbalah.</p>\n\n\n",

The moment we experience this light, we lose our free will. If you've ever seen \"Coming to America\", you'll understand. Hashem wants our hearts, but not because He is so great that we have no choice, similar to a King wanting to know his wife loves him for him, and not because he is the King.</p>\n<p>So, Hashem has to conceal His light, His greatness and <em>chesed</em>, so that we can have free will, and thus come to choose Him on our own volition. The problem is that it takes a lot of darkness to conceal this light.</p>\n<p>Such a bright light, in fact - the light of redemption and Moshiach - that it would instantly remove our free will if we were to see it. It must therefore be hidden under the worst darkness, the tragic destruction of the Beit HaMikdash, the world's \"heart\", and the handing over of the might and power to the Romans, in order that we can continue to have our free will, and be partners in bringing about the redemption.</p>\n<p>So, Rabbi Akiva knew the secret, that when you see the uttermost devastation imaginable, that the redemption is now dead with finality, that must be actually your sign that the process of the final and eternal redemption has started, and indeed, you can learn something from how bad the situation is. However bad it is, kal vechomer, how much more so is the goodness of the redemption going to be!</p>\n<p>I wrote a drasha for this week's parasha on this and I will share it here, as it contains more information relevant to this discussion, as well as many sources for you to look up to back up the points being made.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Vaetchanan 5785                                      בס״ד</strong></p>\n<p>This parasha’s theme is prayer. Famously, Moshe prayed the gematria of\nVaetchanan number of prayers to go into Eretz Yisrael, 515, and Hashem\nsays “Rav Lach”, that’s enough. You can’t pray further or I will grant\nyour request and that’s not the plan. So, this week’s parasha has two\nthemes – the power of prayer, and its connection to the darkness, and\nthe suffering of life. Let’s understand how this is all connected.</p>\n<p>Chacham Hillel illustrates the power of prayer in Faith and Folly. He\nsays it’s a force of nature, similar to rain, wind and the seasons – a\ntotally necessary force of sustenance and growth in the world. Why is\nprayer so important and vital? The truth is, our תפילה service is THE\nepitome of <em>service, עבודה,</em> of Hashem (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.1.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">משנה תורה, הלכות תפילה וברכת\nכהנים\nא׳:א</a>).\nAs we said recently, הקדוש ברוך הוא ליבא בעי (Sanhedrin 106b), and it\nis through our תפילה that we give our hearts to Hashem. Indeed, we\ngive our heart, soul and might to Hashem, and this corresponds to the\n<em>korbanot</em> in the <em>בית המקדש</em>, which is also called עבודה. What is the עבודה?</p>\n<p>This is a great secret of Torah that our Chassidic masters have\nrevealed. The בית המקדש is called the heart of the world. What\nenlivens this heart? Hashem’s Wills that He have a people, Yisrael,\nand this Will is called His Ohr Ein Sof. The entire world is created\nfrom His Ohr Ein Sof, from the highest heavens to the lowest physical\nrocks. These worlds are like vessels, and they are enlivened by the\nlife force of Hashem’s Light, without which they would be inert, and\ndead (see Sha’ar HaYichud for a full treatment).</p>\n<p>It is through our עבודה, our giving our hearts and souls to Hashem,\nthat “ישראל מפרנסין לאביהן שבשמים” (Zohar II 62a), meaning we draw His\nLight into the world. Why? Because like we said, He desires us with a\nרצון הפשוט, and when we give those to Him, we make the world desirable\nfor Him; a dwelling. This is the concept of מ״ן – when our heart beats\nfor Him, His heart beats for us, so to speak. Our love and our awe and\nמסירות, therefore, are likened to blood, because in the human analogy\nit is the blood that contains the vitality that draws the soul into\nthe body, so too our devotion draws Hashem’s Ohr Ein Sof into His\nWorlds (see Likkutei Torah Kedoshim ונטעתם כל עץ מאכל, and on Shir\nHaShirim אני ישנה ולבי ער קול דודי דופק פתחי לי כו׳)</p>\n<p>Now, it’s important to know that His desire is that He has us through\nour own free will, and not by force, like a king who wants his people\nand even his queen to love him for who he is, and not just because he\nis a king. Hashem’s Light – His רצון, His חסד, and His טוב are\nirresistible to our souls. Our love and awe for Hashem must be\nsincere, and not born out of our being dazzled by His greatness and\ngoodness, and thus He hides His face from us, and the world is a very\ndark place. There is a great secret in this, and to understand it we\nmust look at Makkot 24b.</p>\n<p>When Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Elazar Ben Azariah and Rabbi Yehoshua\nencountered the ruins of the בית המקדש, they wept, because the very\nheart of the world had been vacated of its Divine Presence. The world\nhas lost its soul – a world without a heart is a corpse – and this can\nonly mean finality, and death, <em>chas veshalom</em>. They lost hope in the\nredemption. However, Rabbi Akiva, famously, laughed. To understand\nwhat’s going on, let’s go back. This was not the first time the\nChachamim wept. The first time was when they heard the distant\nlaughter of the multitudes of the Romans. Meanwhile, כלל ישראל had\nlost its תפארת, its עוז, its חן, its מלכות. Was the Divine project\nover? Was it all a failure? Had we failed Hashem? At that point Rabbi\nAkiva laughed, bringing a קל וחומר*:* if this is the reward of the\nרשעים, how much more so will the reward of the צדיקים <em><em>be? This\nsomewhat consoled the Chachamim, but they still were not convinced\nthat the world was ever headed to redemption. Yes, the צדיקים would\nget some material reward like the רשעים</em>,</em> but it could not be more\ndue to the principle of דיו: that what is derived from a קל וחומר\ncannot exceed its source (Bava Kamma 25a–b).</p>\n<p>They felt they were further proven right when they saw the חורבן.\nThat’s when the fox emerged, fulfilling the prophecy of Uriah. Rabbi\nAkiva then said, see, I was right. The redemption is coming, and the\nreward for the צדיקים will outweigh the reward of the רשעים 500 to one\nbecause now we know Zacharia’s prophey will come true, based on a\nגזירת הכתוב! **See the Shalah, Vavei HaAmudim 26 for more on this. The\nBeit Aharon, on a talk at the end of Devarim that he said right after\nTisha B’Av, explains further. This is a great secret that only Rabbi\nAkiva was aware of. This is where the darkness and suffering of life\ncome in. Why do we have a phrased “חֲסָדִים טוֹבִים”. Don’t we already\nknow that if they are Chasadim, they are Tovim? The answer he heard\nfrom Rabbi Zusha of Anipoli is that everything Hashem does is a חסד,\neven the darkness and suffering in life, but we don’t always perceive\nit as טוב.</p>\n<p>רבי עקיבא saw the essence. The world was created in חושך. But the רוח\nאלוקים was already מרחפת על פני המים – the אור of משיח was already\npresent before any רשע was born. That’s what the fox represents. Rashi\n(שיר השירים אֶחֱזוּ־לָנוּ שֻׁעָלִים) says the fox always looks\nbackward—to the beginning. And the beginning is Hashem, is light, is\ngoodness. This light is so pure, so intense, that if we saw it fully,\nwe’d lose our free will. Our souls would instantly leave our bodies in\nדבקות. That’s not what Hashem wants. So He hides it in darkness. That\nconcealment is itself the greatest חסד, it enables free will.</p>\n<p>And so, רבי עקיבא understood: if you see <em>total devastation</em> – the\nworst any mortal eyes could see, the heart of the world in ruins -\nthat’s your <em>sign</em> that the brightest light is right underneath. The\ngreater the light, the greater the concealment needed. You can hide a\ncandle behind a sheet, but the sun needs a dungeon. Rabbi Akiva knew\nthat the <em>חורבן</em> was literally the beginning of the end. The true and\nfinal redemption had started, even as the שכינה dwelled among the 70\nnations, it was only there to refine the נצוצות that had fallen to\nthese lowest of places, so they could return back to their source very\nsoon (Lik. Tor. Shir HaShirim ibid, Beit Aharon ibid).</p>\n<p>But how could רבי עקיבא imagine a world without a heart? He knew: \"הדם\nהוא הנפש\" – there’s still life in the blood. ישראל still had blood.\nStill had tears. Still had power to build. To perform בניין המלכות.</p>\n<p>What is בניין המלכות? מלכות ה׳ – His דיבור and פעולה – creates the\nworld anew at every moment. But in גלות, this דיבור is dry. Mundane.\nRoutine. Lacking heart. That’s how Hashem \"speaks\" the world into\nbeing now, so to speak. But the Jewish people, beloved in His Will,\ncan rebuild מלכות - not just as a mechanism, but as a throne of רצון,\nאור אין סוף, and joy. Hashem can speak with לב again, indeed with\nחכמה, with עצמות! How?</p>\n<p>We do this through two things: one is through recognising what Rabbi\nAkiva recognised – that everything that Hashem does is a חסד, even the\ndarkness and the suffering. We do this by refraining from complaining,\nby maintaining joy, trust and אמונה.</p>\n<p>The other is as we said before, through our עבודה – by giving our\nhearts to Hashem, our love, our awe. Even without a בית המקדש, we can\nstill do this through תפילה because תפילות כנגד תמידין. Perhaps this\nis what inspired Rabbi Akiva – he saw his colleagues weeping, a very\nhigh form of תפילה.</p>\n<p>This is בניין המלכות, through the elevation of עליית מ״ן, the תפילה,\nמצוות, ותשובה of Yisrael. See See also Hemshech Samech Vav, ש״פ חקת\nand ש״פ בלק, רס״ו.</p>\n<p>For both of these, we need free will, indeed, we need the darkness.\nThis is why Moshe’s prayer could not be answered. As the Chida\nexplains in his Penei David on this week’s Parasha, Moshe had to\nremain buried with the דור המדבר, because ultimately, he would have to\nlead them in to their great redemption. A redemption we are all headed\nto, that is so filled with light, that it would take away our free\nwill in a heartbeat. So filled with joy that Rabbi Akiva laughed over\nall of the multitudes of Rome, <em>even</em> they mocked us.</p>\n<p>So, let’s give over our hearts to Hashem, and He will give His heart\nto us, and rebuild the בית המקדש through our prayers and the love, and\nawe, we put into them. Let’s focus on bringing back the joy in\ncreating to Hashem, and draw down His infinite light into the world\nonce again. Isn’t it inspiring that it is our very love, our hearts\nand our souls that Hashem seeks? How precious we are to Him will be\none day revealed in a light so bright, it will be our Eden, but for\nnow, let’s not be fooled by the darkness.</p>\n<p>Shabbat Shalom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And the truth is Shach #3 says Beis Yosef really holds like this as seen in his commentary in the Tur.</p>\n<p>But if you look in the Beis Yosef, you'll see he holds the need for hatafas dam bris is not the same as saying he does not actually have a bris mila. Beis Yosef says this person who had mila done from a nonjew is no better than a child who was born without an arla, whom we rule needs hatafas dam bris.</p>\n<p>So then Avraham could have given himself a bris mila, and that is a real bris mila. If he then wanted to take into consideration the opinion that he needs to do hatafas dam bris again, he would then be able to do hatafas dam bris, as he would already be a baal bris.</p>\n<p>This answer is given in accordance with their presumption of the OP that Avraham's mila made him a Jew and these laws would apply.

This is based on the concept of \"Gito v'Yado Ba'im k'Echad\" -- \"his Get and his hand come simultaneously.\" The Gemara in Kidushin (23a) teaches that when a master gives his slave a Get Shichrur, the slave acquires the document only through the mechanism of \"Gito v'Yado Ba'im k'Echad.\" Since a slave is unable to acquire anything (even his Get Shichrur) while he is a slave, the only way he can become free by receiving a Get Shichrur is if \"the Get Shichrur and his freedom (literally 'hand') come simultaneously.\" Similarly, when a Nochri performs Milah to himself with intention to become Jewish, his \"Milah and conversion come simultaneously.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Here's the reid.

Es ist hier der Ort nicht, nachzuweisen, wie ein Teil der etymologischen Operationen in der hebräischen Lexikographie auf Verkennung beruht, und daß die Entfaltung der Bedeutung der Wörter nicht genetisch verfolgt wurde. Hier soll nur die Ableitung und Bedeutung von רפס und ריפזמ entwickelt werden, mit welchen an dem israelitischen Hofe von David an Beamte benannt werden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bei רפס [sofer] wird in den Etymologicis vorausgeschickt, daß der Name רפס im Aramäischen, Neuhebräischen und allenfalls auch im Arabischen abschaben und scheren bedeutet, רפס ein »Scherer« und םירפסמ »Schere«, ferner bedeutet רפס Meeresküste und Grenze. Aber damit ist nichts anzufangen, und es reicht nicht aus, das hebräische Verbum רפס [safar] »zählen« und רפס [siper] »erzählen« zu erklären. Da wird eine unbegründete Urbedeutung »eingraben, einschneiden« aufgestellt und die arabische Analogie herbeigezogen, daß ausnahmsweise רפס auch »ein Buch schreiben« bedeute. Damit ist der etymologische Ausbau fertig. Übersehen wird, daß die Wurzel רפס im Arabischen sehr viele und die allerverschiedensten Bedeutungen involviert, und daß es meistens »eine Reise machen« und »dem Kamel einen Maulkorb anlegen« bedeutet. Da im Arabischen רפס auch ein großes Buch bedeutet, und zwar ganz besonders den Pentateuch, so hätten die Etymologen daran erkennen sollen, daß diese seltenere Bedeutung des Substantivums (und auch des Verbums רפס »ein Buch schreiben«) erst durch judäischen Einfluß in das Arabische eingedrungen sein kann.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Geht man davon aus, daß רפס im Hebräischen ursprünglich »Schreiber« und als Hofamt »Kanzler« bedeute, so wird damit ein kulturhistorisches Moment vorausgesetzt, das erst nachgewiesen werden muß, nämlich, daß an den israelitischen Höfen von David an die Tagesbegebenheiten aufgeschrieben und aufgezeichnet worden seien. Sieht man aber von den schillernden Analogien ab und sucht die Bedeutung auf, welche das Wort im Hebräischen vorherrschend hat, so kommt man zu einem anderen Resultat. Zugegeben wird wohl werden, daß die Partizipialform רפס [sofer] jüngeren Ursprungs ist als die Verbalformen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[418] Nun bedeutet, wie schon gesagt, רפס im Hebräischen nichts anderes als »zählen« und im Piel »er zählen«, d.h. die Vorgänge der Reihe nach »aufzählen«, z.B. םתוא תואצמה לכ תא ול ורפסיו (Josua 2, 23); עשילא השע רשא תולדגה לכ תא יל אנ הרפס (II. Könige 8, 4). Es involviert auch die Bedeutung: »eine wohlgesetzte Erzählung von dem Werte einer Person geben«, gewissermaßen das Epos eines Lebenden auseinandersetzen, daher loben, rühmen, preisen; davon רפס דובכ, ferner תולהת רפס, auch םישעמ und תואלפנ. In רפס [sofer] kann also nur die Bedeutung »Zähler« liegen, einer, welcher zählt. Gezählt wurde die Mannschaft, welche zum Kriege ausgehoben wurde, 1000 aus einem Stamm oder 1000 aus einer größeren und 100 aus einer kleineren Stadt (Amos 5, 3). רפס hat ungefähr die Bedeutung wie das griechische καταλέγειν στρατιώτας, Soldaten ausheben, weil die ausgehobenen Krieger in eine Liste eingetragen wurden. Derjenige, welcher dieses Geschäft verrichtete, hieß רפס [sofer], gleich καταλογεύς, der eine Liste anlegt. So wie der καταλογεύς eine Liste der Gezählten, κατάλογος, anfertigte, ebenso der רפס [sofer] ein רפס [sefer], eine »Liste«. – רפס30 ist also ursprünglich nichts anderes als eine Zählungsliste, eine lange Rolle Papyrus, worin die Ausgehobenen eingezeichnet waren. Der רפס hatte also nur ein militärisches Amt, was auch deutlich hervorgeht aus Jeremia 52, 25; II. Könige 25, 19, םע תא אבצמה אבצה רש רפסה ץראה. Er führte einen Stab zur Züchtigung bei sich רפס טבשב םיכשמ (Richter 5, 14). Der ךלמה רפס oder ךלמל war also nur ein militärischer Beamter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>I'll take this sentence as the -for me- relevant characterization:</strong></em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Erst später wurde רפס der Schreiber überhaupt</strong></em> genannt, weil das Amt desselben es mit sich brachte, zu schreiben, und רפס [sefer] erhielt die Bedeutung »Rolle«. תותירכ רפס und הנקמה רפס vgl. auch Numeri 5, 23.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>This surely is not enough to really understand the expression</em> \"nachexilisch-sopheristisch\" <em>, but it gives a direction for the understanding. Perhaps there will exist more information on this</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Als רפס die Bedeutung eines größeren Volumens erhielt, gebrauchte man für eine kleine Rolle den Ausdruck רפס תלגמ, und erst als רפס noch dazu die Bedeutung »Buch«, und zwar הרותה רפס »Gesetzbuch«, erhalten hat, war der רפס, der Buchkundige, identisch mit ןיבמ. Man muß also namentlich bei der Bedeutung des Wortes רפס die vorexilische und die nachexilische Zeit auseinanderhalten. David war der erste, welcher das Sopheramt eingeführt hat, da er infolge der häufigen Kriege die Übersicht über die Disponibilität der Truppen haben mußte.

Please bear with me, I'm not a native english speaker and it would be really difficult (and likely have many errors) to translate this philosophical/religious/historial text into english. So I'll give you a google-translation, which I think should give at least an idea what Graetz has been thinking about:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"16\">\n<li><p>The importance of the offices of Sopher and Maskhhir.</p>\n<p>[418] The method of combining Hebrew words with the same sounding of fundamentally different meanings, using an Arabic or Aramaic root\nwith the same sounding per fas et nefas for comparison and deriving\nthe basic meaning from this, has led to many errors. It is not the\nplace here to show how some of the etymological operations in Hebrew\nlexicography are based on misunderstanding, and that the development\nof the meaning of the words has not been genetically traced. Here only\nthe derivation and meaning of רפס and רי, are to be developed, with\nwhich officials at the Israelite court of David are named.</p>\n<p>In the case of רפס [sofer], the Etymologicis states that the name רפס means scrape and shear in Aramaic, New Hebrew and possibly also in\nArabic, רפס means “shearers” and םירפסמ means “scissors”, furthermore\nרפס means seashore and border. But there is nothing to be done with\nthat, and it is not enough to explain the Hebrew verb רפס [safar]\n\"count\" and רפס [siper] \"tell\". An unfounded original meaning \"dig in,\ncut in\" is established and the Arabic analogy is used that, as an\nexception, רפס also means \"to write a book\". The etymological\nexpansion is now complete. What is overlooked is that the root רפס in\nArabic has a great many and very different meanings and that it mostly\nmeans \"to go on a journey\" and \"to muzzle the camel\". Since רפס also\nmeans a large book in Arabic, and in particular the Pentateuch, the\netymologists should have recognized that this rarer meaning of the\nnoun (and also of the verb רפס \"to write a book\") only came through\nJudean influence in Arabic may have penetrated.</p>\n<p>Assuming that רפס in Hebrew originally meant \"scribe\" and as court office \"chancellor\", then a cultural-historical element is assumed\nthat must first be proven, namely that the events of the day were\nwritten down and recorded by David at the Israelite courts have been.\nBut if one disregards the dazzling analogies and looks for the meaning\nwhich the word has predominantly in Hebrew, one arrives at a different\nresult. It will probably be admitted that the participle form רפס\n[sofer] is of more recent origin than the verbal forms.</p>\n<p>[418] Now, as already said, רפס in Hebrew means nothing more than \"count\" and in Piel \"he count\", i.e. \"enumerate\" the events one after\nthe other, e.g. םתוא תואצמה לכ תא ול ורפסיו (Joshua 2:23); עשילא השע\nרשא תולדגה לכ תא יל אנ הרפס (II Kings 8: 4). It also involves the\nmeaning: \"to give a well-established narrative of the values ​​of a\nperson\", in a sense to deal with the epic of a living person, hence to\npraise, praise, praise; of which רפס דובכ, also תולהת רפס, also םישעמ\nand תואלפנ. In רפס [sofer] there can only be the meaning \"counter\",\none that counts. The number of crews that was drafted for war was 1000\nfrom a tribe or 1000 from a larger and 100 from a smaller town (Amos\n5, 3). רפס has roughly the same meaning as the Greek καταλέγειν\nστρατιώτας, to raise soldiers because the excavated warriors were\nentered in a list. The one who did this business was called רפס\n[sofer], like καταλογεύς, who made a list. Just as the καταλογεύς made\na list of the counted, κατάλογος, just as the רפס [sofer] a רפס\n[sefer], a \"list\". - So רפס 30 is originally nothing more than a list\nof counts, a long roll of papyrus in which the excavated were marked.\nThe רפס thus only had a military office, which is also clearly evident\nfrom Jeremiah 52:25; II. Kings 25:19, םע תא אבצמה אבצה רש רפסה ץראה.\nHe carried a stick with him for chastisement רפס טבשב םיכשמ (Judges\n5:14). So the ךלמה רפס or ךלמל was just a military official.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Now my selected piece:</strong></em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>*** Only later was רפס the scribe even called ***, because the office of the same involved writing, and רפס [sefer] was given the meaning \"role\". תותירכ רפס and הנקמה רפס cf. also Numbers 5, 23.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When רפס got the meaning of a larger volume, the expression רפס תלגמ was used for a small role, and only when רפס received the meaning \"book\", namely הרותה רפס \"code of law\", was רפס, the literary expert , identical to ןיבמ. One must therefore keep a distinction between the pre-exilic and the post-exilic period when referring to the meaning of the word רפס. David was the first to introduce the Sopher Office, as the frequent wars meant that he had to have an overview of the availability of the troops. The first to hold this office was הירש or אשיש (אוש). His sons inherited this office under Solomon (I Kings 4: 3). Under Jehoiakim there were even two counters (Jeremiah 36, 10-12). The last of this office will probably have been Jonathan under Zedekiah (das. 37, 15 f.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Being united in one goal is a very powerful thing and is a driving force in seeing success in one's endeavours.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.11.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.11.6.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>הן עם אחד BEHOLD, THEY ARE ONE PEOPLE</strong> — They possess all the advantage of being one people and of having one language common to all of them, and this is what they begin to do!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was this power of togetherness that Hashem realised could not be allowed to continue.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.11.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chizkuni%2C_Genesis.11.6.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>ועתה לא יבצר</strong></em>, <em>“<strong>and now that they all know seventy tongues, unless they will be scattered they cannot be prevented from translating their evil design into action</strong>.” [By dispersing them, they will forget the other tongues, and this will make unity harder for them to maintain. [This interpretation is first found in B’chor shor, one of the Tossaphists, Rabbi Yoseph. Ed.]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a similar vein, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.11.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Sforno_on_Genesis.11.6.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>הן עם אחד</strong>, <strong>the only way I can stop them from carrying out their unanimously approved plan is to sow the seeds of discord between them</strong>. The instrument of bringing this about is to confuse their language. Basically, people’s disagreements are either religious, (philosophical) in nature, or they result from misunderstanding what they mean when they speak. <strong>These people had been of one mind in matters of religion</strong>, seeing that they had all agreed with the mistaken idolatrous philosophy shared by mankind at that time. In spite of such apparently good reasons for disagreeing with one another, they did not misunderstand each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, Hashem had nothing to fear as no mortal man can overpower G-d. Rather it was a comment to demonstrate how when a group of people come together, acting as one unit, they will see success. Obviously though, Hashem would never let this happen in this case.</p>\n\n\n",

So here too, the words \"נלבנה לבנים\", though an obvious part of building a city, were repeated merely for emphasis. <strong>The words נשרפה לשרפה, inform us that the valley lacked stones for building houses, but that there was clay which could be kiln burned and produce rain proof bricks, making it possible to build permanent homes</strong>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says that the whole point was to show that they were able to create the building materials themselves. That is, they were showing that <em>everything</em> was under their control. This was the reason that they spoke of וראשו בשמים. It was not that they expected to literally build a physical tower that was taller than the mountains, but that they were building to show that mankind ruled the universe.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They found a plain where all building material was lacking. There they\nwanted to remain, wanted to see if they could not make something by\nthemselves, \"let us make artificial man-made stones\" (this lies in the\nהבא) And just as there was no material for burning to bake such a huge\nquantity of bricks, hence נשרפה לשרפה. Where, as here, the object is\nnot mentioned, it means the most comprehensive generality: \"let us\nburn whatever it is, whatever we can find\". And so bricks served them\nfor stones and what otherwise is only used as a binding material, as\nmortar, they used as a building material. Elsewhere one built with\nstone and cemented with clay. The stone was the חומר the building\nmaterial, clay the mortar, both provided by Nature. But here bothe\nwere artificailly man-made products, and what previously was חֵמָר\nthey used for חוֹמֶר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Or perhaps the primary intent is that even if the people are not praying in a group of ten, there is still merit to praying together with the community. As even if this is not considered communal prayer, it is still considered the prayer of a group of people. The practical difference between the two approaches is in our case, where there is no communal prayer with ten people, but there is still prayer of the public at the same time…</p>\n<p><strong>It would seem that the matter does not depend upon a minyan of people praying together, but rather on many people praying at the same time…</strong></p>\n<p>The bottom line is that even though I have not found a clear proof, it seems that <strong>it is fitting to fix a set time that everyone prays together, even if every person is doing so in his home</strong>. Aside from the value of the time that the community prays, it seems to me that this is also very helpful in terms of human nature, as in this miserable situation in which the shuls are desolate to the anguish of our heart and every person is praying in his home, the concern is great that people will not be careful about praying during the proper time and the same goes for Kerias Shema, and many may not treat the tefilla properly and not pray for an appropriate length of time. But if they pray together and even hear each other, and one serves as a type of shaliach tzibbur, and completes each section aloud, this is very nice, even though it is obvious and clear that they cannot combine together in this manner to recite the repetition of the chazzan or any other davar shebikedusha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Beis Yosef gives the source as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.7b.27?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 7b</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲמַר לֵיהּ רַבִּי יִצְחָק לְרַב נַחְמָן: מַאי טַעְמָא לָא אָתֵי מָר לְבֵי כְּנִישְׁתָּא לְצַלּוֹיֵי? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: לָא יָכֵילְנָא. אֲמַר לֵיהּ: לִכַּנְפִי לְמָר עַשְׂרָה וְלִיצַלֵּי. אֲמַר לֵיהּ: טְרִיחָא לִי מִלְּתָא. וְלֵימָא לֵיהּ מָר לִשְׁלוּחָא דְצִבּוּרָא, בְּעִידָּנָא דִּמְצַלֵּי צִבּוּרָא לֵיתֵי וְלוֹדְעֵיהּ לְמָר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a prelude to another of the statements by Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, the Gemara relates the following incident.

This is true in biblical Hebrew as well - “what is man that you should know him?,” (Psalms 144:3) meaning that you should care about or desire him, or “I have known him by name…” (Shemot 33:12) meaning that I chose him from all other people. <strong>So too the statement of Barzilai haGiladi ‘between good and evil,’ meaning that he had lost his power of discernment and could no longer desire something or be disgusted by it, eating without tasting and hearing without taking pleasure in son. Here in the garden there was no desire for sexual intimacy between the man and his wife, rather at the proper time they joined together and gave birth. Therefore their sexual organs were exposed just as their faces and hands and they were not ashamed of them.</strong> After they ate from the tree, the choice was in their hands and they had the will to do evil or go to themselves or others. This is a divine quality from one perspective, just as it was bad for humanity as they now had lust and desire. It is possible that the verse intended this when it said “…God made men straight, but they have engaged in too much reasoning.” (Kohelet 7:29) ‘Straight’ means that one should seize on a single straight path and ‘engaged in too much reasoning’ means that one seeks various acts among which they can choose. <strong>When G-d commanded the man not to eat from the tree he did not inform him of this quality of da’at which it imparted, rather G-d simply said ‘from the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden,’ meaning the known one in the middle – don’t eat from it</strong>. This is what the woman said to the snake, and only in a later verse does it mention the tree by name “but as for the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat of it.” (Bereshit 2:17) (Sefaria Translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Tree of Knowledge is to <em>know the difference</em> between good and bad.

Rabbah 50:2). You should know that [this is true] because throughout the entire chapter, Scripture mentions them in the plural, e.g., (below verse 8): “and they ate” ; (ibid. verse 9): “and they said to him.” Concerning the announcement, however, it says (ibid. verse 10): “And he said: I will surely return to you.” And concerning the overturning of Sodom, it says (below 19:22): “For I will not be able to do anything”; (ibid. verse 21): “I will not overturn” (Gen. Rabbah 50:11). And Raphael, who healed Abraham, went from there to save Lot. This is what is stated: “And it came to pass when they took them outside, that he [the angel] said, ‘Flee for your life.’” You learn that only one acted as a deliverer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Doesn't that imply that Raphael had two errands - to heal Abraham and to save Lot, which seems to contradict the statement that \"one angel does not perform two errands\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.86b.20?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metziah 86b</a> writes slightly differently and does not state that Raphael went to save Lot, but rather Gavriel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The Gemara continues: Who are these three men? They are the angels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael: Michael, who came to announce to Sarah that she was to give birth to a son; Raphael, who came to heal Abraham after his circumcision; and Gabriel, who went to overturn Sodom. The Gemara asks: But it is written: “And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening” (Genesis 19:1). The Gemara answers that Michael went along with Gabriel to Sodom to save Lot. The Gemara notes: The language is also precise, as it is written: “And he overturned those cities” (Genesis 19:25), and it is not written: They overturned those cities. Conclude from it that only one angel overturned Sodom.</em> (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Either way, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.86b.20?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Bava_Metzia.86b.20.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos</a> over there helps provide an answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ההוא דאתא לשזביה ללוט - ותימה דאמרינן בבראשית רבה (פרשה נ) דאין מלאך אחד עושה שתי שליחות ויש לומר דכאן לא עשה מיכאל בשליחות אחת כי אם מעשה אחד שבישר את שרה וכשהלך משם לסדום אז הותחלה שליחות אחרת ודוקא במקום אחד אין עושה ב' שליחות ובב\"ר (שם) יש שרפאל בא להציל את לוט ורפואת אברהם אינה נזכרת ואפילו בא כמו כן לרפואת אברהם חשיב הכל שליחות אחת דרפואה והצלה ענין אחד הוא הקשה הר\"ר אלחנן הא משמע לישנא דקרא ששניהם הצילוהו כדכתיב (בראשית יט) ויחזיקו האנשים בידו וכתיב ויוציאוהו ויניחוהו מחוץ לעיר וכתיב בתריה שאמר ליה מלאך שבא להפוך את סדום כי לא אוכל לעשות דבר עד באך שמה ויש לומר ששניהם הוציאוהו חוץ לעיר ומיכאל הלך עמו עד צוער וגבריאל היה מצוה אותו למהר</p>\n<p><em><strong>He who went to save Lot</strong></em> - <em>This is wondrous/a question, since it says in Bereishis Rabbah that a single angel does not do two tasks. We must therefore say here, that Michoel performed only one task when he came to bring the news to Sarah. And when he went from there to Sodom, then a new mission began; i.e. it is specifically in one place that an angel does not perform two tasks. <strong>In Bereishis Rabbah it says that Raphael came to save Lot, and the healing of Avraham is not mentioned. And even if Raphael came also to heal Avraham, this would all still be considered a single task, because healing and saving are considered the same matter.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Rabbi Elchanan asks: It is implied from the verses that there were two angels involved in saving him (Lot). As it writes: “And the men held his hand,” and it writes “they took him out and placed him outside the city.” And later it says that the angel that came to overturn Sodom said to him, “I will not be able to do a thing until you get there (to Tzo’ar).” So we have to say that both of them (Michael and Gavriel) took him out of the city; Michael escorted him to Tzo’ar and Gavriel commanded him to hurry.</em> (my translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if we learn like Rashi's p'shat that Raphael both came to heal Avraham and save Lot there are two answers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Either, it is only in one place that an angel performs his set task - and so when he went to save Lot it was a new place and therefore a new task.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Or, both tasks were one of the same, namely an act of saving / salvation. So Raphael first alleviated Avraham's pain and then saved Lot.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Chida answers that the malach just told Avraham to heal himself with the stone he had (Baba Basra 16b) that healed anyone. The malachs mission was to save Lot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I was thinking of another answer one can say, that Raphael had one mission, that was to heal Abraham. Therefore he healed him physically,  his Mila. He also healed him emotionally,  by saving Lot, something that Abraham would've wanted, as can be deduced from the fact he went to save him from the kings. Therefore one can say that Raphael had one shlichus, to alleviate Abrahams pain.</p>\n\n\n",

It says that the Chofetz Chaim,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“wrote the sections to his commentary to the Code of Jewish Law:\nMishna Berura - concise and easy to learn additional laws and customs\nto the Shulhan Aruch as well as explanations usually bringing earlier\nsages such as: Elya Raba, Magen Avraham, and Baer Hetev.</p>\n<p>Biur Halacha - a little more in depth than the Mishna Berura where he\nusually sources his opinions and says why he holds like does.</p>\n<p>Shaar HaTziyun - the sources for his words.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(That question asked, “do the Ashkenazim that follow the M\"B follow the words of the Biur Halacha as well?”).</p>\n<p>My question is similar but different and in two parts.</p>\n<p>It comes about from seeing the Shaar HaTziyun 47 in Simon 253 (see picture below).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why does the Author place his decision (לפענ״ד פשוט דיש לסמוך על המקילין בבעיא זו:)  in the  Shaar HaTziyun and not in the Mishna Berura?</li>\n<li>Is the decision equally accepted for its appearance in the  Shaar HaTziyun as in the Mishna Berura?\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yrM3B.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yrM3B.png\" alt=\"shaar hatziyun\" /></a></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I'm not sure if this fully answers your question, but I saw in an English <em>sefer</em> on <em>pesak</em> (halachic rulings), <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=the+making+of+a+halachic+decision\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The making of a halachic decision</a>, a similar question posed to <strong>Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky</strong>. The author asked why the Mishnah Berurah sometimes puts sources in the text itself in square brackets, and sometimes relegates the source to the Sha'ar HaTziyun.</p>\n<p>Rav Yaakov responded that when a halacha appears in the Mishnah Berurah and the source is in the Sha'ar HaTziyun, that indicates a clear halachic decision. In contrast, when a halachic decision is written in the Mishnah Berurah and its source is given there as well, the author wants the reader to be aware of this opinion, but it does not need to be strictly followed.</p>\n<p>Rav Yaakov proceeds to explain that when the Mishnah Berurah quotes a lenient position with a source inside, and not in the Sha'ar HaTziyun, there is room to be more stringent than the approach offered by the quoted opinion. However, one can rely on the lenient opinion in a situation of necessity. Similarly, when the Mishnah Berurah cites a more stringent halachic opinion inside with its source, it is not quoted as the letter of the law, but rather as a stringency. As such there is room to follow the lenient opinion. Based on this approach, one can also resolve many apparent contradictions found in the Mishnah Berurah.</p>\n<p>When asked how Rav Yaakov knew this, he responded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you learn Mishnah Berurah as much as I do, it becomes obvious.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As such, sources in the Sha'ar HaTziyun are indicative of being a final ruling.</p>\n<p>Thanks to @mbloch for providing a summary of what the <em>sefer</em> says.</p>\n<p>Rav Yaakov wrote this principle himself in a responsum, which is recorded in <strong>Emes L'Yaakov</strong> <em>Orach Chaim</em> 340:6 I'll copy what it says (with my own punctuation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובדרך כלל נוכחתי כי בכל מקום שהמ\"ב מעתיק בשם איזה מחבר בפנים, ולא סתם הדין אלא שהראה מקומו בשער הציון, מוכיח שלא הסכים לגמרי לאותו הפוסק אלא שאמר הדבר בשם אומרו אבל אין דעתו נוטה כן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He writes that whenever the Mishnah Berurah writes a ruling inside, and cites the source inside (and <strong>not</strong> in the Sha'ar HaTziyun), that means he doesn't necessarily agree with that ruling. That means at least that if the source of the ruling appears in Sha'ar HaTziyun, it could indicate his agreement.</p>\n<p>Besides this principle, we see the author sometimes editorializes in the Sha'ar HaTziyun. Even though it's not the norm, if he writes \"my opinion is such and such\", I would think he should be taken at face value. Why he sometimes does this might be indicative of the fact that the later volumes were composed with the assistance of the Chofetz Chaim's son (Kol Kisvei Chofetz Chaim III p. 37). I noticed later volumes contain more editorializing than earlier ones, again probably for the same reason. His son might have had a different style and preferred to put longer comments in the Sha'ar HaTziyun.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In this particular case, his <em>pesak</em> is indeed implicitly found in Mishnah Berurah. Sha’ar HaTziyun is just making it explicit.</p>\n<p>Rema writes that one of the conditions to permit <em>chazara</em> is that the pot remains in his hand. Magen Avraham writes that this means to exclude a case where he puts the pot on a bed or on a bench or pours the contents into another pot.</p>\n<p>Mishnah Berurah quotes Magen Avraham regarding putting the pot on a bed or bench, but omits the case of pouring the contents into another pot, because he does not rule like Magen Avraham in that specific case.</p>\n<p>All he does in Sha’ar HaTziyun is point this out explicitly, and explain why he rules this way.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "When can you disregard a Jewish court's ruling?",
    "content": "# When can you disregard a Jewish court's ruling?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Tractate Horayot discusses cases where rabbis and Jewish courts issue wrong rulings about Jewish observance, and what they must do to remedy.  In particular, it rules:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the principle: One who associates [his action] with himself is liable, but one who associates [his action] with the court is not liable. [Mishna, Horayot 2a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means: A court issues a ruling on Jewish observance. (1) If you are knowledgeable and you know the court was mistaken, do not follow its ruling. (2) If you are not knowledgeable and have not heard the court's ruling, but implicitly follow their ruling, you are liable.</p>\n<p>Commentators found difficulty with this approach because Torah says to always follow what the rabbis tell you:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You shall act in accordance with the instructions given you and the ruling handed down to you [by the court]. You must not deviate from [it] either to the right or to the left. [Deut. 17:11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even if it seems in your eyes [that they are telling you] left is right and right is left, listen to them. [Sifrei Devarim 154:5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ohr Ha-Ḥayyim (18th-century Morocco) reconciles the two as follows: If you are knowledgeable, and you are convinced that the court ruling is wrong, do not follow the ruling privately, but do not disagree publicly with the court. [Ḥefetz HaShem]</p>\n<p>Now, my question.  To what extent is this teaching and the Ohr HaHayyim's interpretation valid and applicable today?  Can you disregard a rabbinical ruling in your own personal observance if you are convinced you know your halacha better?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes, halachikally.</p>\n<p>The Jerusalem Talmud, Horayot 1,1 explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You would think that if they [the rabbis] said to you concerning\nright that it is left and concerning left that it is right you should\nobey them, therefore the Torah tells you to go right and left: if they\ntell you concerning right that it is right and concerning left that it\nis left [then you obey them, but not if they tell you that right is\nleft].”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In paraphrasing the Talmud, Rashi writes, based on Deuteronomy 17:11 and Midrash Sifrei, that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“even if he [the rabbi] tells you regarding the right [hand] that it\nis left, or regarding the left that it is right, and certainly so [you\nmust obey the rabbi] if he tells you regarding the right [that it is]\nright, and regarding the left [that it is] left.”[1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yisachar Eilenberg,[2] wrote that Rashi only meant his writings to refer to someone who heard a rabbinical verdict but is unsure whether the rabbi is correct. Whereas the Talmud refers to a case where the rabbi is wrong and the person should not obey the verdict.[3]</p>\n<p>For example, when the Patriarch Rabban Gamaliel and sage Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah calculated the date of Yom Kippur differently, Rabban Gamaliel ordered Rabbi Joshua to appear on his version of Yom Kippur, in violation of the law, as according to Rabbi Joshua.[4] “I command you to come to me with your staff and money on the day of Yom Kippur according to your calculation.” When  Rabbi Akiva quoted Leviticus 23:4, Rabbi Joshua obeyed him based on Deuteronomy 17. The moral of the story is that you can disagree with the rabbis privately. Rabbi Joshua was convinced that he was correct. But that you must obey the rabbis publicly, as to avoid division in Judaism and to keep the peace. The Talmud relates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He took his staff and money in his hand and went to Yavneh to Rabban\nGamaliel on the day he [Rabban Gamliel] had calculated to be the Day\nof Atonement. Rabban Gamaliel stood up and kissed him on his head and\nsaid to him: “Come in peace, my rabbi and my pupil; my rabbi in\nwisdom, and my pupil, because you accepted my words.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Rabbi Angel, the Sanhedrin “even had the power to overrule a law of the Torah (see, for example, the discussion in the Talmud, Yevamot 90b.” And that it “ruled according to the way it seemed to them that the law should be – their judgment is the law. If a subsequent Great Court found a reason to refute their decision, it should refute it” for the Torah says to “only obligated to follow the Court which is in your generation.”[5] Maimonides writes that ancient law was flexible (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Rebels 2:1). But writes in Hilchot Mamrim 1:2, to accept rabbinical mandates. In Mishneh Torah, Rambam avoids the issue of “right and left” altogether. H writes in the Guide that, “A man should never cast his reason behind him, for the eyes are set in front, not in the back.”</p>\n<p>Lastly, Avot 1:6 recommends \"providing yourself with a teacher.\" \"Make yourself into a great rabbi.\" R. Galanti posits that this means becoming a Torah scholar and a great tzaddik. Thus, one should be well-informed in order to make reasonable halakhah decisions. Hillel agreed. He said, \"he who does not increase his knowledge decreases it (Pirke Avot 1:13).\"</p>\n<p>[1] Similarly, the Ran wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“even if it is crystal clear to you that what the court [or rabbi]\ntells you is wrong, nevertheless obey them, for this is how G-d, may\nHe be blessed, commanded that we should behave towards the Torah and\nits commands: do as they decide for us, whether it is true or false.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[2] Author of Tzedah laderech (seventeenth century).</p>\n<p>[3] Jacob Makelberg, author of Hakhatav v’hakabala (nineteenth century), agreed.</p>\n<p>[4] See Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashanah 25a, and Mishna Rosh Hashanah 2:9.</p>\n<p>[5] See his book The Rhythms of Jewish Living.</p>\n\n\n",

We know this already from the wife of Manoach (Judges 13,2). If that lady realised that she faced an angel, someone of Abraham's stature would certainly be aware of the presence of an angel. After all, Abraham had already encountered angels previously. The word וירא a second time merely confirmed Abraham's original impression seeing that he had been healed and was able to run towards them. An angel has long-distance vision and inasmuch as the cure he performs is of a spiritual nature, he does not need to be physically close to the patient. As soon as Abraham felt cured, he bowed down to the angel in gratitude to G'd.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.18.3.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.18.3.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi</a></p>\n<p>If so, why did he prepare food for them?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He also told them to take פת לחם, a reference to the inner meanings of Torah, something he alluded to when speaking about their לבכם, inner organs. He invited the angels to enjoy the inner aspects of Torah. [This is not so strange-sounding, seeing angels had never been given the Torah. Ed.] The reason he did not merely say פת but פת לחם, was a hint that this bread had inner properties, i.e. its numerical value being 78, or three times the numerical value (26) of the four-lettered Holy Name. This was an allusion to eternal life, i.e. past, present and future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.18.4.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.18.4.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי על כן עברתם על עבדכם, \"for this is why you have come by your servant.\" These words were intended to silence the argument that once Abraham had recognised that his visitors were angels he should not have offered to give them human food. Although we explained that Abraham alluded to the spiritual nourishment the angels were to enjoy, this did not mean that we are to ignore the plain meaning of the verse. Terrestrial food also contains spiritually valuable ingredients as we know from Proverbs 13,25: \"the righteous man eats to satisfy his soul.\" Abraham said to the angels that the reason they appeared in the guise of human beings was in order for them to partake of his food seeing that the spiritual content of that food also assumed the forms of the terrestrial world. The angels responded saying כן, yes, that Abraham was quite correct. They added that he should proceed as he had intended, i.e. to let them enjoy the spiritual content of the food.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.18.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.18.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi</a></p>\n<p>And why would Sarah (on a higher level of spiritual awareness) have laughed when they made their pronouncement of pregnancy?</p>\n<p>That's actually another question altogether...did Sarah know they were angels?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ושרה שומעת, and Sarah was listening. On the one hand the verse indicates that what Sarah heard was a message intended for her by a heavenly messenger, the messenger himself standing behind her. Nonetheless I have seen a Midrash according to which the angel was disciplined for not addressing Sarah directly with the message, preferring to deliver it to Abraham. Angels are punished for inadvertently committed disobedience or minor deviations from the instructions they receive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.18.10.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.18.10.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n<p>It appears Sarah would not be able to decipher they were actually angels since it says she was listening. There isn't an indication that she ever saw these particular angels like Abraham. Perhaps she wouldn't have laughed had the angel properly fulfilled it's mission.

How could she contradict that which God had said to the prophet and also disbelieve the words of the angels of God? And it seems to me [literally, in my my eyes] that these angels who look like people came to Avraham, and <strong>he in his wisdom recognized them [as angels]</strong>. And he [one angel] gave the good news that \"I will [surely] return to you and Sarah will have a son\", and <strong>Sarah heard and she did not know they were angels from on high</strong> as with the wife of Manoach (Judges 13:6), and perhaps she did not see them at all. \"She laughed inside her\" - With derision like \"the sitter in the heavens will laugh, God will mock them\" (Psalms 2:4), because laughter in joy is with the mouth \"then our mouths will be filled with laughter\" (ibid 126:2). But laughter in the heart is not said with reference to joy. And the Holy One Blessed be He, accused her to Avraham, why should the thing [literally \"spoken word\"] be impossible in her eyes, and it would be fitting [literally \"seemly\"] that she believe or say \"Amen, let God do so.\" And behold Avraham said to her, \"Why did you laugh, is anything beyond God?\" and did not explain to her that God had revealed her secret to him. And she for fear of Avraham denied [it] for she thought Avraham recognized it in her face or because she was silent and did not offer praise and thanks about the thing and was not happy. And he said to her \"no, rather you laughed\" at which time she understood that it was said to him so, and so she was silent and did not respond any word to him. And it is fitting that we say further that Avraham did not reveal to her that which was said to him before (see above, 17:19) \"but Sarah your wife is bearing you a son.\" Perhaps he was waiting until until God would send her the good news on the next day, for he knew that the Lord God does nothing without revealing his secret to his servants the prophets (Amos 3:7) or because of his great alacrity in commandments he was preoccupied with his circumcision and that of a vast multidude of those in his house and after that in his weakness he sat by the entrance of the tent and the angels came before he had told her anything\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Ya'akov claiming to be Esav - the Anochi versus Ani\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As Yakov presents the food that he has prepared for Yitzchok in order to receive the blessings, he says: אָנֹכִי עֵשָׂו בְּכֹרֶךָ - Genesis 27:19.</p>\n<p>Rashi comments that what Yakov was really saying was: \"I am the one\" [who is bringing the food to you], [and] Eisav [is] your first born, thus separating the statement of Ya'akov of anochi, I, from Esav bichorecha, Esav is your firstborn (in response to Yitzchak’s query of his identity).</p>\n<p>I liked the interpretation and I found an explanation on the matter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem: From where did Rashi derive this interpretation? What led\nRashi away from the more simpler and obvious interpretation that Yakov\nwas saying \"I am Eisav your first born\" in order to trick Yitzchok so\nhe may receive the brochos.</p>\n<p>The solution : The Taamim (cantillations) are divided into two groups.\nOne that warrants a pause after them and another that lead intos and\nconnects the current word to the following word. The Taam on the word\n\"Anochi\" is a Pashta which is a cantillation or Taam that places a\npause or comma after it. The following two words \"Eisav Bechorecha\"\nEisav your firstborn, is punctuated with the Taam of Zakef Koton a\nTaam that joins the two words together as if there is no pause between\nthem.</p>\n<p>In essence the Taam divides these words into two statements. The words\nfollowing the punctuation of the Taam are saying I am, followed by an\nindependent statement \"Eisav your first born\" with a comma or pause\nafter the word I. The words Eisav your first born are also according\nto the Taam to be read as a statement on it's own. Therefore Rashi,\nfollowing the Taam, understood Yakov to be saying two statements \"\nAnochi\" I am, meaning: I have brought the food, and a second statement\nthat \"Eisav Bechorecha\" Eisav is your first born.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But afterwards - after I read this, and also about the difference between ani and anochi <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/64742/difference-between-%D7%90%D6%B2%D7%A0%D6%B4%D7%99-and-%D7%90%D6%B8%D7%A0%D6%B9%D7%9B%D6%B4%D7%99/65382#65382\">see here</a> - I came across verse 24 in which Ya'akov answers the words  אַתָּה זֶה בְּנִי עֵשָׂו with  אָנִי.</p>\n<p>What I would like to know is, if we follow Rashi's comment, how one should explain this?; whether or not Ya'akov consciously weighs his words in Genesis 27:19 or whether he just twice claims to be Esau.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore it says, \"And he stood over them under the tree and they ate.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem that ordinarily angels do not eat and it was only because of the fact that they were in a tzaddik's presence, that Hashem made them eat.</p>\n<p>This all makes perfect sense....</p>\n<p>However, when we get to the episode with Lot and his hosting of the malachim, the pasuk in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.3?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 19:3</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּפְצַר־בָּ֣ם מְאֹ֔ד וַיָּסֻ֣רוּ אֵלָ֔יו וַיָּבֹ֖אוּ אֶל־בֵּית֑וֹ וַיַּ֤עַשׂ לָהֶם֙ מִשְׁתֶּ֔ה וּמַצּ֥וֹת אָפָ֖ה <strong>וַיֹּאכֵֽלוּ</strong>׃</p>\n<p><em>But he urged them strongly, so they turned his way and entered his house.

Uz in the table of nations is a grandson of Shem via Aram (10:23), yet also the name of Abraham's nephew (22:21) and one of the Horites in our chapter (36:28). Kemuel (Bethuel's brother) is called the \"father of Aram\" (22:21) despite Aram being listed in the table of nations (10:22–23) and Bethuel and his son Laban already being called Arameans (25:20)! [...] Examples of this phenomenon abound, and many explanations come to mind. Certainly, some children may have been deliberately named after these existing polities (as seems to be the case with Hori) and some of the recurrences on this list may be coincidences. Yet in the case of Aram, it appears inescapable that the \"fathers\" of nations needn’t be their literal progenitors. Kemuel is not descended from Aram, but rather from his brother Arpachshad, yet is called the \"father of Aram\"—and this when his brother and nephew are called Aramean. We may suggest that, in the biblical mindset, both men were what we might call \"founding fathers,\" but not the literal progenitors of these peoples. Indeed, Ishmael's twelve sons being \"princes\" (Gen. 25:16) would indicate that the nation they ruled was not solely descended from them.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This doesn't explain why the younger Sheva and Dedan would have been named after the older pair, but does suggest that both pairs may have been considered progenitors of the Shevaim and the Dedanim.</p>\n\n\n",

And it is to teach us something amazing of God's knowledge of things, which was hidden from all [my] predecessors whose words have reached us. And it is that that which God may He be exalted knows of actions in this low world is independent of what man [actually] does. That is that He knows the actions of people that are fitting according to what was prepared for them from the day of their creation, based on the celestial causes that God may He be exalted placed as guidance over the human species. [However,] human choice rules over this arrangement of their actions based on the celestial causes. And it is therefore possible that what people actually do is different from what God may He be exalted knew [they would do] based on the arrangement of their actions. And this is because He knows their actions from the side in which knowledge of them is possible, and that is the side in which they are arranged and quantified. But on the side in which they are contingent there can be no knowledge, for if we suppose that knowledge of them is possible then their contingency cannot be upheld. <strong>And therefore it says metaphorically that God may He be exalted saw whether the people of Sodom and Gomorrah actually did the evil that He knew from them, because it is possible that what they had done was different from what God may He be exalted knew from them.</strong> And we have explained this topic of God's knowledge of things in Book III of Wars of the Lord.

It's not that the King of Sedom was offering Avraham gifts, and the latter refused.</p>\n<p>In reality, these spoils from the war were ownerless. The King of Sedom, as he was losing the battle against the other Kings, lost all hope of ever retrieving his property. As a result, according to halacha, Jewish law, they became ownerless<sup>2</sup>. When Avraham won the war and found the spoils, they became his to keep. However, the halacha states that it is the proper thing to do to act beyond the letter of the law and return the items to their original owner<sup>3</sup>. Even though Avraham would have been justified in keeping the spoils, he wanted to go beyond the letter of the law and returned them.</p>\n<p>Rav Chaim Kanievsky asks a related question. If a person finds an ownerless object and goes beyond the letter of the law and returns it to the original owner, do they have to give ma’aser? Seemingly no, since they didn’t actually end up earning anything. He points out that the story with Avraham possibly could be a proof that yes, one should give. We see this from the fact that Avraham gave ma’aser from the spoils to Malkitzedek. Although, I would argue that perhaps just like he gave back the spoils beyond the letter of the law, he gave ma'aser beyond the letter of the law.</p>\n<p>Either way, we see that he didn't give ma'aser from the King of Sedom's property.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <em>Tur al HaTorah</em> 14:23, <em>Ohr HaChaim</em> 14:21, <em>Pardes Yosef</em> 14:23, and <em>Ta’amah D’Krah</em> by <em>Rav Chaim Kanievsky shlita ad. loc.</em></p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Bava Metzia</em> 22b; <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> Choshen Mishpat 259:7.

Before the appointment of Aaron it was only who had been appointed to a position similar to his that performed this rite.

Likely they both came from the same area in the Mediterranean, but they are two distinct groups (similar to how <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.10.14?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Tanach differentiates</a> between the Kaphtorim and the Plishtim). This might serve to explain the term \"Cheretite Negev\": The Cheretites, in order to distinguish themselves from their countrymen, settled south of Pleshet. It's also possible that the Cheretites actually made up an earlier immigration wave to Canaan, arriving there before the Plishtim. Connecting this view with what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trude_Dothan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Trude Dothan</a> wrote in her book \"The Philistines and their material culture\", pg. 17, that \"The Philistine expansion toward the southwest is probably indicated by the term negeb hakreti\", it's possible that the Cheretites originally settled with the Plishtim, and then perhaps volunteered to assist with the expansion by settling a particular area of the Negev Desert. The Encyclopedia believes that the Peletites are regular Plishtim.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In Olam Hatanach on Shmuel 2, it is suggested that per the reading \"הכרי והפלתי\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.20.23?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 2:20:23</a>) instead of \"כרתי ופלתי\", the Cheretites may have actually originated in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caria\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Caria</a> region in Anatolia, which at the time was known for having many mercenaries-for-hire (though the Tanach never outright states it, it seems that that's what the Cheretites and Peletites were). It's worth noting that, as I first heard from archeologist Dr. Amit Dagan, inscriptions found in Turkey tell about a King Taita ruling the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palistin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kingdom of Palistin</a>\".</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In a lecture given in the Judea and Samaria Research Studies Conference no. 12 (5762/2002), David Inbar noted the difficulty in viewing the two groups as Aegean people brought from overseas, given the fact that all of David's battles were land battles - experienced seafaring warriors would have been a waste of money. Instead he suggested that the Cheretites were the mountainous Kurti people, probable ancestors of the Kurds, who lived more or less in the same region (Iran-Turkey). For the Peletites, Inbar suggested two options: Descendants of Pelet ben Reuven (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.16.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&qh=%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%AA%20%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%95%D7%91%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 16:1</a>), or members of the Aramean tribe called Pilat.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Regarding gentiles who are not obligated in circumcision, there are three opinions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Some authorities rule that one should not circumcise them (outside\nthe framework of conversion). [Beis Yosef YD 266, Rema 263:5, Igros\nMoshe YD 2:7].</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Others rule that it is permitted to circumcise a gentile. [See\nRambam Milah 3:7, Shach 263:8, Yabia Omer YD 2:19].</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Some require the circumcision to be performed differently (Maharam\nShik OC 144), without the <em>priah</em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p>It is worth noting that Rashi (Sanhedrin 59) and Ramban (Yevamos 46) posit that descendants of Yishmael are not obligated in circumcision. The Rambam (Melachim 10:8) rules that they are obligated. Accordingly, the ruling of the Shaagas Arye is in accordance with the view of the Rambam.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Indeed the Rambam holds the Ishmaelite are obligated to give the children circumcision (also at the age of 8 days). It goes therefore that Halacha obligates it (at least the Rambam, I haven't seen other rishonim) it may certainly be done by a mohel. There is no problem in general of a jew circumcising a gentile, although it is also called an \"אות\", unlike shabbos which gentiles are forbidden to keep.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Even if they are descendants of Yishmael, why should they circumcise? Yishmael was sent away by Abraham. Abraham disowned Yishmael. Yishmael is not Jewish and Muslims pray to Allah, not G-d. They have no right to perform a holy act. It's disgusting.</p>\n\n\n",

The Midrash explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When she was 20 she was as beautiful as when she was 7; and at 100 she was as sinless as a woman of 20, which is the age below which Heaven does not punish for sin. [Gen. R. 58:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But, as Ramban notes, the same language was used when Abraham [Gen. 25:7] and Ishmael [Gen. 25:17] died, and nobody interpreted it that way (except for Rashi on Abraham, with no source).</p>\n<p>So why isn't this language interpreted consistently?</p>\n<p>Edit:  I am not asking why Ishmael gets a pass, but why the same expression is not explained consistently.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch actually compares the usage at the death of Avraham with the usage at the death of Sarah He states that the two lived life fully with every day significant ימי שני חיי. On the other hand Yishmael lived his life שני חיי as a group of years. Indeed Rashi does give the same explanation for Avraham as he did Sarah.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8220/jewish/Chapter-25.htm/showrashi/true#v7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chayei Sarah 25:7</a> Rashi</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>one hundred years and seventy years and five years: When he was one\nhundred years old, he was as one who is seventy years old, and when he\nwas seventy years old, he was as one who is five years old, without\nsin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Hirsch says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ימי שני חיי etc., see above Ch. XXIII,1. Abraham too lived days and\nyears, every day full of importance and all together one individual\nwholeand every period of life completely fulfilling its own\nsignificance. And yet all this were only days and years of the real\nlife of Abraham which extended beyond the span of his earthly stay. It\nis peculiar that in Hebrew, large numbers of things areput in the\nsingular, small ones in the plural. With years it is the same as with\nall large numbers. He who has a million pounds does not count single\nones, who has only a little, every penny.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Ramban explains that he is ONLY arguing with Rashi on how to make the Drasha. But he agrees with the Drasha.</p>\n<p>The Ramban states that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שנה שנה ושנים דרך הלשון הוא. ...לא דרשו כן אלא מיתור הלשון, שחזר\nואמר: שני חיי שרא</p>\n<p>Year, year years is normal for language... the Rabbis expounded the fact\nthat the end of the verse repeats \"The years of Sarah\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramban even brings the proof to his reasoning that they don't make this drasha for Avraham, and that is because there it does NOT repeat these last few words.</p>\n<p>How beautiful the Ramban is. It is possible that Rashi agreed and only meant that since it repeats \"shnei chaya sarah\" at the end, why did it ALSO include shana multiple times, it could have read 127 shnei chayei sarah. So Rashi darshans the other part. What beautiful commentators. Like Gold! Similarly by Avraham there is a repition of Chai there but at the beginning so darshans like Sarah but not Yishmael who does not have anything extra. So Rashi darshans similary by Avraham but not Yishmael. Just my 2 cents.</p>\n\n\n",

Why was Ish Boshet referred to as Mefiboshet? Because he would embarrass [mevayesh] David in matters of halakha. According to this approach, Mefiboshet is an abbreviation of boshet panim, embarrassment. Because David was not embarrassed to admit his errors, he merited that Kilav (Chileab), who, according to tradition, was exceedingly wise, would descend from him. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: <strong>His name was not Kilav; rather, his name was Daniel, as it appears in a different list of David’s descendants. Why was he called Kilav?

Sarah did not sin. Rav Hirsch and others explain the situation.  Sarah had arranged for Avraham to take Hagar as a concubine in order to raise her children as her own because she herself could not have children. Once Hagar got pregnant she began to behave improperly to Sarah. Sarah reacted to humble Hagar to bring her to a realization of her position. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8211/showrashi/true#v5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lech Lecha 16:5</a>. Rav Hirsch explains that Hagar could no longer accept this and ran away. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8211/showrashi/true#v6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lech Lecha 16:6</a>. The malach was sent to tell her to return and be part of the household so that the child would be raised as a child of Avraham <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8211/showrashi/true#v9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lech Lecha 16:9</a>. Hagar refused to accept this so she had a miscarriage and the Malach told her to return and her next child would be a פרא אדם (free man or wild donkey of a man) unable to be controlled by anyone else <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8211/showrashi/true#v10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lech Lcha 16 10-12</a>.</p>\n<p>Yishmael was born and was then 13 tears old when Avraham was commanded to become circumcised and to circumcise his entire household <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8212/jewish/Chapter-17.htm/showrashi/true#v25\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeira 17:25</a>. After Yitzchak was weaned and was being raised by Avraham, Sarah saw that Yishmael could not be part of the family because of the way he was behaving. Yishmael was then at least 15 <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8216/showrashi/true#v9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lech Lecha 21:9</a></p>\n<p>When Avraham disinherited Yishmael <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8216/showrashi/true#v11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lech Lecha 21:11-15</a> it was <strong>at the command of Hashem</strong>. Rabbi Isaac Hertz explains that this was a technical method of showing that Yishmael was not a full heir (unlike the children of Bilhah and Zilpah) and was not sending them out without food or water. It was a symbolic method of showing that Yishmael, while a child of Avraham, was not entitled to a full share of the inheritance (like the children of Keturah). Once this was done Hagar and Yishmael were entitled to remain in the household, though of a lesser status than Sarah and Yitzchak. We can see this in the medrash that explains that Yishmael was one of the two who accompanied Avraham and Yitzchak to the akeidah and and the pasuk that says he attended the funeral of Avraham. It was Hagar who got panicky and wandered around until she ran out of water and then abandoned the teen aged Yishmael near the well. Hashem then saved them.</p>\n\n\n",

Even nowadays, according to our author, the Moslems who are trained in theology are able to do this without coming to any harm thereby. <strong>It was difficult for Rabbi Moses to understand how Avraham a great and devout man could possibly have taught the holy Name of the Lord to wicked people. In view of this problem, Rabbi Yaakov, son of Rabbi Nachman, interpreted that line in the Talmud differently by saying that the word טומאה used in the Talmud there refers to the names of certain demons.</strong> The names of these demons are associated with the evil spirits making their homes in certain ruins, or certain cemeteries as described by the Talmud in tractate <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.3b.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah folio 3</a>. This is alluded to by the fact that the spelling of the word “matanot” is spelled as if it were a singular, the letter ו having been omitted. As spelled in the Torah here, the numerical value of the letters in the words נתן אברהם מתנת equals the numerical value of למדם להשביע השדים. [I have not quite figured this out. <strong>At any rate, the idea is that Avraham taught these sons of his how, when they used the names of deities when swearing an oath, they could do it in such a way as not to be guilty of violating the third of the Ten Commandments</strong>. To The reader who is interested in pursuing this further I suggest that he turns to the commentary on Sanhedrin 91 by Rabbi Reuven Margolies, page 136 מרגליות הים.

However he in his wisdom, gave them a name from the holy names that even if it will be mentioned in impurity it would not cause harm, as not all names are equal and need purity, since names have in them holiness, each and every name according to what it is.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> In the Sefaria link to the Chizkuni, the editor's note points to the Torah Sheleimah for further information on <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51484&st=&pgnum=89&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p.996 in the top footnote</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that Avraham attempted to teach them the spirituality in which they should live in the world, but he was unable to prevent them from losing this status.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And in any case this sending away of Ketura's children was also in\naccordance with Hashem's stipulation כי ביצחק יקרא לך זרע. According\nto the way our sages take it the מתנות include spiritual gifts which\nthey took out with them into the world from Abraham's house, but which\nlater became misused and muddled and lost their original purity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your question revolves around understanding two ideas.</p>\n<p>The first is what it means in Bereshit 25:5 that Avraham gave to Yitzchok <em>all that he possessed</em>.</p>\n<p>The second is what these other gifts mentioned in Bereshit 25:6, which he gave to his children from the handmaidens are.</p>\n<p>In this particular context, <em>All</em> is referring to the usage as it is brought in the written Torah to Bereshit 9:3</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל־רֶ֙מֶשׂ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הוּא־חַ֔י לָכֶ֥ם יִהְיֶ֖ה לְאָכְלָ֑ה כְּיֶ֣רֶק עֵ֔שֶׂב <strong>נָתַ֥תִּי לָכֶ֖ם אֶת־כֹּֽל</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following Noach's offering to G-d after the flood, G-d blessed Noach and gave to him <em>All</em> (כל). It's meaning is <em>life</em> which is associated in the posuk with green grass which grows through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">photosynthesis</a>. This is the path of life, meaning the path of Torah and light, like Mishlei 6:23, נר מצוה ותורה אור. This same possession is what Avraham bequeathed to his son from Sarah, meaning Yitzchok. Avraham inherited this possession through his ancestor Shem, the son of Noach.</p>\n<p>Concerning the other gifts, Rabbi Yirmiyahu Bar Abba as quoted in Sanhedrin 91a calls them <em>Shem Tumah</em>. Rashi to this expression says it means <em>working with demons</em>.</p>\n<p>This all sounds very esoteric. But it is really referring to a general principle found within Torah teaching, for example in Sefer Ma'arechet Elokut, that there are two categories of <em>influence</em> within creation. Those of life (חי) and those of destruction and decay (הרס).</p>\n<p>For those descendants of Avraham and Sarah, their path and focus is to be concerned with life and what leads to its increase and diversification.</p>\n<p>The others were given the gifts related to destruction and decay. When understanding these gifts, it is easy to only see the more extreme levels of this which are truly frightening. Those which are referenced, for example in Shemot 7:11</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וַיִּקְרָא֙ גַּם־פַּרְעֹ֔ה לַֽחֲכָמִ֖ים וְלַֽמְכַשְּׁפִ֑ים</strong> וַיַּֽעֲשׂ֨וּ גַם־הֵ֜ם חַרְטֻמֵּ֥י מִצְרַ֛יִם בְּלַהֲטֵיהֶ֖ם כֵּֽן׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and in Shemot 22:17</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>מְכַשֵּׁפָ֖ה</strong> לֹ֥א תְחַיֶּֽה׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We even mention them in the Hagaddah of Passover when discussing the 3,280 Angels of Destruction (מלאכי חבלה,מלאכי המשחית) that came to wipe out Mitzrayim at the time  of the Exodus. They are alluded to in the written Torah by the word <em>fist</em> (אגרף) like in Shemot 21:18. The Hebrew word stands for 3 times 1000 plus 280 for a total of 3280 Angels of Destruction.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכִֽי־יְרִיבֻ֣ן אֲנָשִׁ֔ים וְהִכָּה־אִישׁ֙ אֶת־רֵעֵ֔הוּ בְּאֶ֖בֶן א֣וֹ <strong>בְאֶגְרֹ֑ף</strong> וְלֹ֥א יָמ֖וּת וְנָפַ֥ל לְמִשְׁכָּֽב׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But think of the ideas of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungiculture\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">decomposition</a>, rotting, fermentation and molds (see also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroying_angel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Destroying Angels</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_phalloides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Death Caps</a>). They are all levels of destruction, meaning they are moving away from life, not toward it.</p>\n<p>And even to this day, looking at the special wisdoms of the far East (where Avraham sent these descendants) like in Japan and Korea, this wisdom is found for example with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kimchi</a> (salt smoked vegetables), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_sauce#Japanese\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tamari and Shoyu</a> (fermented soy beans and wheat)  and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuobushi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Katsuobushi</a> (smoked, molded fish) which is used in Dashi.</p>\n<p>So what Avraham was giving to his children from the handmaidens was a means to make a living in the world like all good parents. He knew they were not to have a claim in the inheritance that belonged to Yitzchok (<em>What would ultimately be forbidden to Yitzchok's descendants.</em>) and so gave them what remained. He blessed them.</p>\n\n\n",

So we will hold on to everything that HaShem our God (Elohim) has given us to possess\".</em></p>\n<p>These words have left me very perplexed, because it seems that Jephthah believes in the real existence of Chemosh as a deity, and that he has the power to assign their land to the Ammonites, similarly to what HaShem did with Israel.</p>\n<p>How does the Jewish tradition interpret this passage?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the Ralbag this line is being said in a mocking tone:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמר לו על צד הלעג הלא את אשר יורישך כמוש אלהיך אותו תירש כי לא יכול כמוש אלהיהם להצילם מיד סיחון כאומרו אוי לך מואב אבדת עם כמוש וגו'</p>\n<p>And he said to him, on the side of the mockery: Will your god Kemosh not inherit it? i.e. Kemosh their god was not able to save them from the hands of Sichon like he said \"Woe to you Moav! You lost with Kemosh!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Daat_Zkenim_on_Numbers.21.28.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daas Zekeinim</a> (on Bamidbar 21:28 when recounting the experience of the Bnei Yisroel on their travels) similarly brings this out. He notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'כי אש יצאה וגו, The entire line is a quotation of how the people speaking in parables flattered the powerful King of Cheshbon. The Torah describes all this in order to show the reader what a tremendous victory Moses had scored when he totally vanquished this empire, annihilating him and his people totally. <strong>Yiftach, in the Book of Judges 11,24, refers sarcastically to the claims of the king of Moav in his time, claiming that that the Israelites have to give him back the land that a former king had lost to Sichon.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a more modern piece, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Berkovits\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eliezer Berkovitz</a> raises your issue about Yiftach potentially recognising Chemosh as a deity in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Man_and_God%2C_Chapter_1_the_Knowledge_of_God.78?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Man and God: Studies in Biblical Theology (1969)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even the message of Jephtah to the king of Ammon is consistent with this terminology. <strong>The reference in that message to “the Lord, the God of Israel,” who had “dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel,” as the English translation has it, may easily be misunderstood as being the counterpart to Chemosh, the god of Ammon</strong>. As Chemosh was Ammon’s tribal deity, so was—in Jephtah’s understanding—Y Israel’s. However, if this were so, Jephtah’s plea, also addressed to the king of Ammon, that “Y, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon” would be meaningless. The passage suggests that the concept, Y, the Judge, was intelligible to the Ammonite to whom it was addressed. One could call on him to judge impartially between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon. It is significant that, when Jephtah speaks of what God did for Israel, he calls him, Y the Elohim of Israel; but when he calls upon him to judge between Israel and Ammon, he refers to “Y, the Judge.” <strong>It was meaningful to speak to the Ammonites about Y, the Judge, because they, too, knew of a Supreme God who ruled over all men. Chemosh for them was the Elohim that was mediating between the Supreme God, the El Elyon, and the Ammonites. For Jephtah, however, Y and the Elohim of Israel were identical. The concept that Y, He is Elohim, does not tolerate any tribal deity beside Y, as it rejects categorically the idea of any mediating divinity between God and man.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem from Rav Berkovitz that Yiftach phrased it as he did for the Ammonites to more readily understand it. Knowing that they served a deity that ruled over all men, Yiftach was putting it in terms that they clearly understood.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the Ramban (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ramban_on_Exodus.20.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 20:3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ramban_on_Leviticus.18.25.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 18:25</a>), God appointed ministers over the different lands, apart from Israel, which he attends to himself. It may be that Jephthah was referring to the appointed ministers, who are also called \"gods\" (he identifies these as the \"other gods\" of the second commandment).</p>\n\n\n",

You are correct that for a circumference to be exactly 30 <em>amos</em> (cubits), its radius must be about 4.774648 <em>amah</em>. Relative to the exactly 5 <em>amah</em> radius, the difference is about 0.225351 <em>amah</em>, which is roughly 1/4.4375 as you computed, or 4.4375 <em>tefachim</em> is one <em>amah</em>.</p>\n<p>Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.3b.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 3b</a> defines the length of a <em>tefach</em> relative to <em>amah</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara considers the measure of the cubit (<em>amah</em>) mentioned in the mishna and elsewhere. Abaye said in the name of Rav Naḥman: The cubit (<em>amah</em>) mentioned with regard to the halakhot of sukkah and the cubit (<em>amah</em>) mentioned in connection with the halakhot of an alleyway is a small cubit consisting of <strong>five handbreadths</strong>. In contrast, the cubit of a forbidden mixture of diverse kinds of seeds is a large cubit consisting of <strong>six handbreadths</strong>. Apparently, Rav Naḥman rules stringently in all cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After some discussion, the gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.3b.21?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 3b towards the end of the <em>daf</em></a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The above was based on the ruling of Rav Naḥman according to Abaye. But Rava said in the name of Rav Naḥman: All cubits mentioned in measurements by the Sages consisted of a large cubit of six handbreadths. However, these, the cubits mentioned with regard to diverse kinds of seeds, are measured with <strong>expansive handbreadths</strong> (<em>tefachim sochakos</em>), with the fingers spread apart, whereas those, the cubits mentioned with regard to an alleyway and a sukkah, are measured with <strong>compressed handbreadths</strong> (<em>tefachim atzeivos</em>), with the fingers held together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <em>halachah</em> follows Rava over Abaye except for 6 cases (none of which are applicable here). One can say based on these discussions that <em>tefach sochak</em> is <strong>at least</strong> 6/5-th of the <em>tefach atzeiv</em> (so that 6 <em>atzeivos</em> would make upto or maybe less of the same <em>amah</em> as 5 <em>sochakos</em>). Therefore, if the circumference is measured in <em>amos</em> corresponding to <em>tefachim atzeivos</em>, and assuming that that a portion of a <em>tefach</em> is like a full <em>tefach</em>, we can accept that the rim was given as roughly <em>tefach sochak</em> as 1/4 < 1/4.4375 so 1/4.4375 is taken roughly as 1/5-th.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The approximation of π = 22/7 = 3.142857 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">has been known since the old kingdom in Egypt</a>, and certainly for the Jews who built cities in Egypt during the Middle Kingdom. In fact, Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Oholot.12.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oholos 12:7</a> offers a different approximation of π:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[With regard to] a pillar lying [on its side] in the open air, if its circumference is twenty-four handbreadths, it brings uncleanness to everything under its side (i.e. one can fit under it a cubic box of length tefach - <em>poteach tefach</em>; But if it is not, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/f8vciB6t.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/f8vciB6t.png\" alt=\"pi\" /></a></p>\n<p>Therefore, we have to conclude that 24 tefachim in the mishna is a <em>halachic</em> approximation, not exact one. In this case, the circumference is equal exactly 21.4521 tefachim. In the calculation we neglected the thickness of a <em>poteach tefach</em> box which will certainly improve the accuracy, i.e. the box needs to have 1 tefach inside, so it will be slightly bigger on the outside.</p>\n\n\n",

Reish Lokish said, since the daughters of idol worshippers guard themselves from nakedness and abandonment from another place but this virginity (i.e. that of Rivkah's) was purely from a place of virginity (i.e. and not of any pagan ritual). \"And no man had known\" - i.e. from another a place. Rabbi Yochanan said it is implied from the fact that it says that she is a virgin that we do not know and no man knew, even no man had a 'claim' on her like it says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.125.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 125:3</a>) \"The sceptre of the wicked shall never rest etc.\"...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see three reasons for this calling out of Rivkah's virginity:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>She was the first to be with someone who had received Milah at the correct time.</li>\n<li>Her virginity was due to her absolute pure character and nothing like the pagan practises at the time.</li>\n<li>\"No man had known\" means that no one had even asked for her, as the passuk in Tehillim implies that the righteous are protected from the wicked.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

And if one were to ask, perhaps Milkah was the only one with birthing problems and Nachor had children by another woman, then the answer is that it says in the Torah \"ואת עוץ בכורו\" - Utz, <em>his</em> first-born - Utz was Nachor's true firstborn; he had no prior children.</p>\n<p>Now, more directly to your question, Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Genesis.17.16.2?vhe=Pentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann_--_corrected_vocalization&qh=%D7%90%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%99%20%D7%9E%D7%9F%20%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet 17:16</a> quotes the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.87a.12?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&qh=%D7%90%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%99%20%D7%9E%D7%9F%20%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metziah 87a</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In reference to Sarah having given birth to Isaac, the verse states: “And she said: Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah should nurse children?” (Genesis 21:7). The Gemara asks: How many children did Sarah nurse? Why does the verse use the plural form when she had only one child? Rabbi Levi says: That day when Abraham weaned his son Isaac, he prepared a great celebratory feast. All of the nations of the world were gossiping and saying to each other: See this old man and old woman who brought a foundling from the market and are saying: He is our son, and moreover they are making a great feast to bolster their claim. What did Abraham, our forefather, do? He went and invited all of the great men of that generation, and Sarah, our foremother, invited their wives. Each and every one of the wives brought her child with her but did not bring her wet nurse. And a miracle occurred to Sarah, our foremother, and her breasts were opened like two springs, and she nursed all of these children. And still those people were gossiping and saying to each other: Even if Sarah, at ninety years of age, can give birth, can Abraham, at one hundred years of age, father a child? Immediately, the countenance of Isaac’s face transformed and appeared exactly like that of Abraham. Everyone exclaimed and said: “Abraham fathered Isaac” (Genesis 25:19).\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So perhaps the reason that it was important to emphasize that Betuel was the son of Milkah was that like Yitzchak with Avraham and Sarah, there was room to suspect that he wasn't really the son of Nachor and Milkah, but a foundling - for this, his parentage, particularly from his mother, was emphasized.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One of the children  of his pilegesh reuma was a girl maacha.

[Shabbat 63a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How do we reconcile the two?  By saying that financial compensation <em>is</em> the pshat and that the popular understanding is not an interpretation at all?  Sources?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp177.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Guide for the Perplexed</a> 3:41 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The punishment of him who sins against his neighbour consists in the general rule that there shall be done unto him exactly as he has done: if he injured any one personally, he must suffer personally; if he damaged the property of his neighbour, he shall be punished by loss of property. But the person whose property has been damaged should be ready to resign his claim totally or partly. Only to the murderer we must not be lenient because of the greatness of his crime; and no ransom must be accepted of him. \"And the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it\" (Num. xxxi. 33). Hence even if the murdered person continued to live after the attack for an hour or for days, was able to speak and possessed complete consciousness, and if he himself said, \"Pardon my murderer, I have pardoned and forgiven him,\" he must not be obeyed. We must take life for life, and estimate equally the life of a child and that of a grown-up person, of a slave and of a freeman, of a wise man and of a fool. For there is no greater sin than this. And he who mutilated a limb of his neighbour, must himself lose a limb. \"As he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again\" (Lev. xxiv. 20). <strong>You must not raise an objection from our practice of imposing a fine in such cases. For we have proposed to ourselves to give here the reason for the precepts mentioned in the Law, and not for that which is stated in the Talmud. I have, however, an explanation for the interpretation given in the Talmud, but it will be communicated <em>vivâ voce</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>(Friedlander translation, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this, exact vengeance is certainly an interpretation – even the preferred interpretation. That in practice we don't do it is for reasons that he doesn't disclose (though it is at least somewhat explicated in the Talmudic passage you cite in the question).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I believe the answer is that really the damager deserves to have his limb actually punished, and the money is a כופר, or way of redeeming his limb by replacing it with money. This is why the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.35.31?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְלֹֽא־תִקְח֥וּ כֹ֙פֶר֙ לְנֶ֣פֶשׁ רֹצֵ֔חַ אֲשֶׁר־ה֥וּא רָשָׁ֖ע לָמ֑וּת כִּי־מ֖וֹת יוּמָֽת׃<br />\nYou may not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of a capital crime; he must be put to death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>but for other physical damages, money is accepted <em>in place of</em> the limb of the damager.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_One_Who_Injures_a_Person_or_Property.1.3?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> actually makes this point explicitly in Mishneh Torah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זֶה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר בַּתּוֹרָה (ויקרא כד כ) \"כַּאֲשֶׁר יִתֵּן מוּם בָּאָדָם כֵּן יִנָּתֶן בּוֹ\" אֵינוֹ לַחֲבל בָּזֶה כְּמוֹ שֶׁחָבַל בַּחֲבֵרוֹ אֶלָּא שֶׁהוּא רָאוּי לְחַסְּרוֹ אֵיבָר אוֹ לַחֲבל בּוֹ כַּאֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה וּלְפִיכָךְ מְשַׁלֵּם נִזְקוֹ. וַהֲרֵי הוּא אוֹמֵר (במדבר לה לא) \"וְלֹא תִקְחוּ כֹפֶר לְנֶפֶשׁ רֹצֵחַ\" לְרוֹצֵחַ בִּלְבַד הוּא שֶׁאֵין בּוֹ כֹּפֶר אֲבָל לְחֶסְרוֹן אֵיבָרִים אוֹ לְחַבָּלוֹת יֵשׁ בּוֹ כֹּפֶר:<br />\nWhen the Torah says: \"If a man disfigures a person, as he has done so shall it be done to him\" (Leviticus 24:20), it does not mean to inflict injury on this man as he did on the other, but that the offender fittingly deserves to be deprived of a limb or wounded in the same manner as he did, and must therefore indemnify the damage he caused. Furthermore, the Torah says: \"You shall accept no ransom for the life of a murderer\" (Numbers 35:31), implying that only for a murderer no ransom is accepted, but compensation is taken for the loss of limbs or for injuries sustained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the simple pshat of the passuk actually describes what the damager <em>deserves</em>, but the Torah gave him a way to <em>redeem</em> his limb with money.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>EDIT: The purpose of payments for damages is to make the victim \"whole\", which is why the word for payments \"tashlumim\" comes from the root שלם, meaning complete. The purpose of physical punishments in the Torah seem to be both for atonement and deterrence. This is made clear in the case of murder by the statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.7a.3?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkos</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סנהדרין ההורגת אחד בשבוע נקראת חובלנית רבי אליעזר בן עזריה אומר אחד לשבעים שנה רבי טרפון ורבי עקיבא אומרים אילו היינו בסנהדרין לא נהרג אדם מעולם רשב\"ג אומר אף הן מרבין שופכי דמים בישראל.<br />\nA Sanhedrin that executes a transgressor once in seven years is characterized as a destructive tribunal. Since the Sanhedrin would subject the testimony to exacting scrutiny, it was extremely rare for a defendant to be executed. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: This categorization applies to a Sanhedrin that executes a transgressor once in seventy years. Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva say: If we had been members of the Sanhedrin, we would have conducted trials in a manner whereby no person would have ever been executed. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: In adopting that approach, they too would increase the number of murderers among the Jewish people. The death penalty would lose its deterrent value, as all potential murderers would know that no one is ever executed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the case of a damaged limb, BOTH aspects apply. The victim deserves payment for monetary damages, but the damager also should lose a limb as a deterrent to future damage. The Torah allows him to redeem his limb by making the victim whole financially.</p>\n<p>As to how we can interpret the Torah's punishments this way here but not in other places, the ultimate answer is that we can only interpret verses in line with the tradition from Moses. However, in this case we see that the Torah recognized the concept of \"kofer\", or redeeming the punishment with money by damages to others (such as an ox killing a man) and excluded it by murder, which implies that in other cases of injury it would be permitted. We don't find the concept of \"kofer\" by other types of sin, so it is not as sensible to assume the concept should exist there. But again, ultimately the rules for interpretation are set by tradition.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>Most scholarly consensus agrees that it means literally, “an eye for an eye,” however, the rabbis understand the real meaning to be not explicit, thus meaning monetary compensation. I agree with the latter.</p>\n\n\n",

In a year, the middle man who effected the transfer of charity introduces us and says \"Hey Fred, this is the guy who donated that car to you.\" Does that middle man's statement \"lower\" the level of my donation and the resultant \"reward\" or is this only about my knowledge at the moment of donation?</p>\n<p>What if I know that a person is of a group that will receive from my donation but I don't know if that specific person will receive my specific donation from among a pooled group?

While products like Cochineal, Carmine, Carminic acid (E120) aren’t, because the Torah teaches us not to eat certain insects.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.cor.ca/view/856:2/bones_dry_bones_the_kosher_status_of_gelatin_carmine_and_shellac.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for a comprehensive overview.</p>\n<p>Firstly a bit of background for the uninitiated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Shellac</strong></p>\n<p>Shellac or “confectioner’s glaze”, as it is referred to in the colloquial, is a resin that is secreted by the female lac bug. For commercial use, the resin is collected from trees, processed, and purified so that it does not contain any insect parts which may have stuck to it. The purified resin is dissolved in three to four parts ethanol to make liquid shellac used as a transparent food glaze which works well to maintain a long-lasting shine on a product.21 Shellac is used in jelly beans and rainbow sprinkles amongst other goodies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Carmine</strong></p>\n<p>Carmine is produced by heat-drying cochineal insects until they are completely dehydrated and subsequently crushing them into powder. The powder is then boiled in water which serves to extract carminic acid which is present in the powdered insects. Use of added chemicals causes the colouring and animal matters present in the liquid to precipitate into a red pigment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the reason why Shellac is allowed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can you think of another sticky substance that is secreted from a non-kosher insect that we might consider similar to shellac? You are likely thinking of honey which secretes from a bee. So why is honey kosher? Two possibilities are considered in the Gemara. The first is based on logic that honey does not inherit non-kosher status from the bee, since honey does not extract any nutrients or proteins from its host. The second is based on a drasha, a way of reading the verse in the Torah that prohibits the consumption of a sheretz ha’oaf, a flying insect, while excluding the substance that the sheretz ha’oaf secretes. That substance is identified by the rabbis as bee’s honey. The difference between the two cited possibilities is that the former is more inclusive and allows us to permit all secreted substances that do not extract nutrients or proteins from their respective hosts, while the latter is exclusive as it can only incorporate substances whose characteristics are most similar to those of bee’s honey. <strong>Shellac is obviously quite different from honey as it is secreted from the lac which is not a flying insect at all, rather a sheretz ha’aretz, an insect that lives on the land, and does not fit into the drasha</strong>.</p>\n<p>Many halachic authorities seem to indicate that they are comfortable with the former, more inclusive view which allows shellac. Furthermore, some say that since shellac is, from its inception, as dry as a bone and completely inedible, it should not take on the status of its host even according to the more exclusive view (Refer to <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=919&st=&pgnum=31&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Igros Moshe, cheilek 5, Yoreh Deah II Siman 24</a>). <strong>Unlike carmine which is essentially the dried out insect itself, shellac is an inedible secreted substance which emanates from the insect and therefore should not inherit the kosher status of its host</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As per the footnote (No. 25) the thinking is derived from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.86.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 86:7</a> which reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אפרוח שנולד מביצת נבילה וטריפה מותר</p>\n<p>A chick born from the egg of a <em>Neveila</em> (i.e. a dead carcass of an animal that was not ritually slaughtered) and a <em>Tereifa</em> (i.e. an animal that did have ritual slaughter but was found to have a defect that makes it not Kosher e.g. a hole in the lung) is permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea being, that in the same way an egg that hatches from a kosher animal does not take on the status of what its parent is now deemed, and is judged in isolation as being Kosher, so too, with Shellac we look at the substance in isolation and not from the source it comes from.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shellac (/ʃəˈlæk/)[1] is a resin secreted by the female lac bug on\ntrees in the forests of India and Thailand. It is processed and sold\nas dry flakes (pictured) and dissolved in alcohol to make liquid\nshellac,</p>\n<p>Definition of cochineal 1: a red dye consisting of the dried bodies of\nfemale cochineal insects</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since cochineal is the actual insect itself it is not kosher. That would be like eating pork or drinking the milk of the pig. On the other hand shellac is a secretion of the lac bug in the same way that bee honey is kosher. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/31154/in-light-of-modern-science-why-is-bee-honey-still-kosher\">In light of modern science, why is bee honey still kosher?</a></p>\n\n\n",

Additionally, the Rabbinical law of <em>eruv</em> forbids transferring from houses into an outer courtyard, or from a courtyard to the outer <em>mavoi</em>. But aside from this, is it generally permissible to transfer in between two <em>reshuyot hayachid</em> - e.g. from my courtyard to my neighbours'?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to Torah law that is indeed permissible since it's not one of the two forbidden categories of transferring you mentioned. However, King Solomon enacted that it be forbidden to do so unless the neighbors first enact an Eruv between them, symbolically joining their distinct private domains into one, lest people get confused and come to transfer objects in a biblically forbidden way. (Rambam, Laws of Eruvin, Chapter 1)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Building on what <code>Double AA</code> and <code>Joel K</code> have said: מדאורייתא this is definitely permitted. The decree of King Solomon declared multiple contiguous רשויות היחיד <strong>in which people live in defined, separate areas</strong> as \"separated\" in a sense, and said that they they need to be \"combined\" in order to allow carrying between them.</p>\n<p>However there are some forms of רשות היחיד in which people don't live. For example, a raised platform that is 4x4 <em>amot</em> and 10 <em>tefachim</em> high within a רשות היחיד (e.g. a trampoline in a private garden) is a separate רשות, or an open area enclosed by houses but not set aside for use (קרקף שלא הוקף לדירה) so  - could one carry between these (מדרבנן) without an <em>eruv</em>?</p>\n<p>To my understanding this is a מחלוקת תנאים in the beginning of chapter כל הגגות in עירובין (89a). R' Meir holds it is forbidden, while R' Shimon holds it is permitted, and the <em>halacha</em> is like him. So according to R' Shimon, we can carry around the contiguous רשויות היחיד in a city, going from the courtyards to the flat roofs (which according to him aren't seen as part of the living area) to the surrounded open areas (קרפיפות) and so on. Naturally the objects cannot have begun <em>shabbat</em> in a private living area (in which case they need an <em>eruv</em> to be taken out of that area).</p>\n<p>(Cases that imply that transfer between two courtyards is forbidden without an <em>eruv</em>, such as the window (<em>Eruvin</em> 76a) or the well (86a) between two courtyards, are talking about transfers to/from the private houses, or objects that began <em>shabbat</em> in a private house. See for example <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> 376:1)</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Hunna (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.63.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 63:6</a>) is quoted as having said that it means if Yaakov merits it he will become the senior, if not, Esau will become senior to him. An alternate exegesis: the word רב does not mean: “the senior one,” but simply means “הרבה,” a great deal,” or “for a long time.” The word occurs when Esau first declined Yaakov’s gift by saying: יש לי רב, “I have lots.” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.33.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 33:9</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This understanding is shared by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.25.23?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Daat_Zkenim_on_Genesis.25.23.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Da'as Zekeinim</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.25.23?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Radak_on_Genesis.25.23.7&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> explains that it is not a foregone conclusion that it means that Esav will be subservient to Yaakov as the grammatical structure of the pasuk means it is unclear. In fact, in recent history the descendants of Esav have been the more powerful, it is thus a reference to a future time:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The reason we face the problem of meaning in our verse is that the future of the two peoples is not spelled out clearly, in the prophecy, seeing that history teaches that the Jewish people enjoyed distinct periods in which it was in the ascendancy, whereas over the last 1000 years plus the opposite is the case. The only part of the prophecy which is clear is that during most of history Esau was indeed subservient to Israel, hence Esau is mentioned first in this part of the verse, seeing that it is the principally active subject. Not only this, but <strong>after the arrival of the Messiah this situation will be restored with Edom/Esau serving his junior brother Israel</strong>. The word רב being applied to the older of the twins refers to his seniority at the time of birth, seeing he emerged first from Rivkah’s womb. It follows that the one who emerged last must be referred to as the צעיר, the younger one. We find another examples of the word רב or at least its plural רבים referring to chronological seniority in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.32.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Job 32:9</a> לא רבים יחכמו, “it is not the seniors who are wise.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A different approach is understood as far as the second verse you cite.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.40?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Ramban_on_Genesis.27.40.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> implies that this servitude will be demonstrated on the battlefield. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>And you shall serve your brother</strong> - He would be victorious in all his battles except for those with his brother.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.40?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Daat_Zkenim_on_Genesis.27.40.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daas Zekeinim</a> adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיה כאשר תריד, “it will come to pass when you will break loose; (the most common translation, rejected by our author);” (the root רדה, meaning “to subdue) occurs again in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.24.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 24:19</a>, in Bilam’s blessings, when that prophet predicts that <strong>eventually a time will come when the descendants of Israel will subdue the descendants of Esau, and that at that time Esau’s descendants will accept Yaakov’s yoke willingly</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.40?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.27.40.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr HaChaim</a> who further supports this claim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...even when Esau dominates the rest of the world, his dominion will not extend over Jacob (the Jewish people)...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This p'shat is also employed by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.40?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Tur_HaAroch%2C_Genesis.27.40.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur Ha'Aruch</a></p>\n<p>So according to these views, Esav will 'serve' Yaakov and his descendant by not dominating them and will accept the Jewish people as the senior partner. Either way, the commentaries on both verses point to a future time and that is why you have not seen them being 'served' yet.</p>\n\n\n",

The crackers are 99% wheat (per the ingredients label). While most wheat crackers require the blessing of mezonot, these are specifically labelled as needing the bracha of ha'adama. What is Paskesz doing (or as I suspect is the case, not doing) to these crackers such that they're ha'adama?\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aLbh1m.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aLbh1m.jpg\" alt=\"Paskesz wheat crackers\" /></a> <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MDePYm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MDePYm.jpg\" alt=\"Label showing bracha\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Refer to this communication between <a href=\"https://thejewishweekly.com/dayan-osher-yaakov-westheim-ztl/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dayan Westheim zt\"l</a> and Rabbi Yehoshua Kaganoff <a href=\"https://guardyoureyes.com/GYEFiles/PDFs/Addiction%20in%20Halocho.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> on p.64. The full letter is very enlightening and sheds light on their production/manufacture and the resulting halachic breakdown:</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the argument for them being ha'adamah is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the proper Brocho on the Paskesz product of Wheat Squares: Thank you for describing to me their production processing, i.e., <strong>complete whole wheat kernels including their bran are placed between two metal plates approximately 3/4 inch distant from each other and then they are heated until they pop. Simultaneous to their popping they become fused together to form the \"pattycake\"-like format</strong> as it appears when it is marketed.</p>\n<p>I had posited that this would be equivalent to a cooking process \"bishul\" of whole wheat kernels until they completely disintegrated and adhered to each other of which the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.208.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MB 208:3</a> (end) states that the Brocho is Borei Minei Mezonos. You countered that all of this discussion in the Shulchon Aruch and Acharonim revolved about only a liquid based processing but <strong>a dry process such as the puffing/popping of the grains as described above would not engender any discussion or dispute and would unanimously be Borei Pri Ho'Adomo</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And is there any other reason why there is a connection?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I don't know what the Likkutei Shas of the Arizal says, but as per the second clause of your question asking if there are any other reasons for a connection, there is a famous piece in the fifth chapter of Sefer Yetzira which goes through the alef beis.</p>\n<p>It writes somewhat cryptically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המליך אות ס' בשינה וקשר לו כתר וצרפן זה בזה וצר בהם קשת בעולם וכסלו בשנה וקבה בנפש זכר ונקבה</p>\n<p><em><strong>He produced the letter Samech</strong>,  predominant in sleep, tied on it a crown, combined this one and that one, and formed Sagittarius (the astrological sign / mazal of the month) in the world, <strong>Kislev in the year</strong>, and the stomach of person male and female.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4556275/jewish/12-Facts-About-the-Month-of-Kislev-You-Should-Know.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad</a> it can be understood as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The previous month, Cheshvan, has been associated with the biting scorpion and the letter nun, which stands for nofel, fall. This month, <strong>we are thus uplifted with the letter samech, which means “support.”</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchak_Ginsburgh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh</a> helps develop our understanding of this esoteric statement in the Sefer Yetzira <a href=\"https://www.inner.org/times/kislev/kislev.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and goes through all the clauses of the text. Some of the highlights as they pertain to your question, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The miracle of Chanukah reflects the active trust of the Hasmoneans (the Maccabees) in God that drove them to stand up and fight against the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom (and its culture). <strong>Kislev’s sense is sleep. Sleep too is connected with trust and reflects the passive trust that we all have that God’s Providence always watches over all</strong>...The name of the letter samech implies “support.” <strong>The experience of feeling supported corresponds to the trust and confidence in Divine providence associated with Kislev</strong>, as described above. In the same vein, in Psalms we find the expression, “God supports (סוֹמֵךְ) all the fallen and lifts up all the bent over”(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.145.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 145:14</a>). Also, “Should he fall, he will not be cast aside, for God supports (סוֹמֵךְ) his hand” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.37.24?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 37:24</a>).</p>\n<p>The letter samech is shaped like a circle, representing G-d’s omnipresence and universal providence. The “great circle,” representing God’s Infinite light is explained in Chassidut to reflect His right arm embracing (and supporting, from beneath) with great, infinite love, all of reality, as is said, “And from beneath, the arms of the universe” -(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.33.27?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 33:27</a>).</p>\n<p>The zodiac symbol of Kislev is the bow (קֶשֶׁת), which means both an archer’s bow and a rainbow. The latter relates clearly with the theme of Chanukah as the archer’s bow of the Maccabees. It symbolizes their active trust in God to fight against the Hellenistic culture that ruled the world at the time...The archer’s bow is a projection (or, one might say it is shot, like an arrow out of a bow) of the rainbow—the sign of the covenant made between God and creation never to destroy the world again and a sign of peace—which pervades the end of the previous month, Cheshvan. <strong>Graphically, the two bows—the rainbow and the archer’s bow—are two half circles, that when joined together form the shape of the circular letter samech, the letter of the month of Kislev</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pri_Tzadik%2C_Rosh_Chodesh_Kislev.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pri Tzadik</a>

What is the answer to this contradiction?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See Ran in Nedarim on the Gemara you linked</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הכי הוה ליה למימר דנהי דאמעיטא מצוה מקרבן לא אמעיטא מבל יחל כדחזינן התם בפרק שבועות שתים בתרא (שבועות כה.) דמילתא דליתא בלאו והן אי נמי בלהבא דאמעיטא מקרבן מלהרע או להיטיב ולא אמעיטא ממלקות ולהא לא צריך קרא א״כ מאי קאמר שנאמר נשבעתי ואקיימה ומתרצינן אלא הא קמ״ל דשרי ליה לזרוזי נפשיה כלומר ודאי לא איצטריך האי קרא לומר שהיא חלה לגבי בל יחל אלא ה״ק מנין שדבר הגון הוא להשבע לקיים את המצוה ואפי' כשרים שנמנעין משבועה נשבעין הן בכך שנאמר נשבעתי ואקיימה כלומר שהרי דוד היה עושה כן: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Mushba Veomed...\" means that there is no scriptural prohibition called <strong>Shevuat Sheker</strong>, leading to Korban Ole Veyored for this lie, because it's a Shevua about a duty, because it's regarding a mitsva.</p>\n<p>But regarding an other scriptural prohibition, the <strong>Lav of Lo Yachel</strong>, it still applies on a Mitsva.</p>\n<p>To make an oath to complete a Mitsva because you want motivate yourself to make is different. The Gemara in Nedarim says that, not only the oath applies , and there is no need to address this in the Gemara, but it's a good practice.</p>\n<p>After a survey on the topic in Shevuot 25b and 27a I can summarize that the Mishna in Shevuot addresses sacrifice (Korban) only. An oath to make a positive Mitsva as, e.g. to eat Matsa on Lel Pesach, is an oath, so, if finally he doesn't eat it, he transgresses a Shevua. Regarding scriptural prohibition for an oath, there are several lavim, see 20b (there is discussion about <strong>Shevuat Sheker</strong> and <strong>Lo Yachel</strong>. Regarding the example of the Matsa, the Rambam rules that it's Shevuat Sheker). But regarding the scriptural prohibition called <strong>Shevuat Bituy</strong>, that involves a Korban, there is a controversy, Machloket, between Rabbi Yehuda Ben Betera and Rabanan in Mishna. Rabanan, and we hold that this is the halacha, say there is no Shevuat Bituy and so no Korban. If someone makes a oath to follow rightly a negative commandment, as the prohibition to eat Chamets during Pesach, there is a controversy between Rashi and Riva in Tosfot. The last gives two proofs that Rabbi Yehuda Ben Betera aggrees with Rabanan that there is no Shevuat Bituy and Korban. If someone makes a oath to infringe a mitsva, positive or negative, there is only a Shevuat Shav (Mishna daf 29a, and see Ritba 24a, regarding a Machloket rishonim ) . See Shulchan Aruch YD 236.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's not entirely clear from the gemara in Nedarim that the shevua actually works - the below is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.8a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a> translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מנין שנשבעין לקיים את המצוה שנאמר (תהילים קיט קו) נשבעתי ואקיימה לשמור\nמשפטי צדקך</p>\n<p>From where is it derived that one may take an oath to fulfill a\nmitzva?

An oath cannot take\neffect if one is already bound by a different oath.

If the Torah said a group will do bad like it says  the Egyptians will by enslaving the Jews how can it be is said of them that they had free will? (2) A more specific question. How can you say Pharaoh had free will when the Torah explicitly says Hashem will harden his heart?</p>\n<p>He is first answering the general question (1) by saying that the Torah indicates the Egyptians had free will and made their own decision to enslave the Jews. He then extends it to answer question (2) and says that although as established, in general,  the Egyptians had free will, there reached a point where as a punishment the power of repentance was withheld from them .But  even the Pharaoh who got the makkos initially had the free will  to repent and avoid having his heart hardened.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While the Pharaoh that was punished was not the same one who initiated the policy, he did continue it.

Do not give your daughter to his son, and do not take his daughter for your son.\"</p>\n<p>This prohibition applies equally to [individuals from] the seven [Canaanite] nations and all other gentiles.2 This was explicitly stated in Ezra3 [Nechemiah 10:31]: \"That we will not give our daughters to the gentiles in the land and that we will not take their daughters for our sons.\"</p>\n<p>א\nיִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁבָּעַל עַכּוּ''ם מִשְּׁאָר הָאֻמּוֹת דֶּרֶךְ אִישׁוּת. אוֹ יִשְׂרְאֵלִית שֶׁנִּבְעֲלָה לְעַכּוּ''ם דֶּרֶךְ אִישׁוּת הֲרֵי אֵלּוּ לוֹקִין מִן הַתּוֹרָה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים ז ג) \"לֹא תִתְחַתֵּן בָּם בִּתְּךָ לֹא תִתֵּן לִבְנוֹ וּבִתּוֹ לֹא תִקַּח לִבְנֶךָ\". אֶחָד שִׁבְעָה עֲמָמִין וְאֶחָד כָּל אֻמּוֹת בְּאִסּוּר זֶה. וְכֵן מְפֹרָשׁ עַל יְדֵי עֶזְרָא (נחמיה י לא) \"וַאֲשֶׁר לֹא נִתֵּן בְּנֹתֵינוּ לְעַמֵּי הָאָרֶץ וְאֶת בְּנֹתֵיהֶם לֹא נִקַּח לְבָנֵינוּ\":</p>\n<p>2\nThe Scriptural prohibition applies only to marital relations.4 When, by contrast, one engages in relations with a gentile woman with a licentious intent, he is given \"stripes for rebellious conduct\" according to Rabbinic Law. [This is a] decree, lest this lead to marriage.</p>\n<p>If [a Jew] designates [a gentile woman] for licentious relations, he is liable for relations with a niddah, a maid-servant, a gentile woman, and a licentious woman.5 If he did not designate her for himself, but instead, [engage in relations with her] spontaneously, he is only liable for relations with a gentile woman.

When the man who engaged in relations was an Israelite.

This confession is a positive command.</p>\n<p>How does one confess: He states: \"I implore You, God, I sinned, I transgressed, I committed iniquity before You by doing the following. Behold, I regret and am embarrassed for my deeds. I promise never to repeat this act again.\"</p>\n<p>These are the essential elements of the confessional prayer. Whoever</p>\n<p>confesses profusely and elaborates on these matters is worthy of praise.</p>\n<p>Those who bring sin offerings or guilt offerings must also [confess their sins] when they bring their sacrifices for their inadvertent or willful transgressions. Their sacrifices will not atone for their sins until they repent and make a verbal confession as [Leviticus 5:5] states: \"He shall confess the sin he has committed upon it.\"</p>\n<p>Similarly, those obligated to be executed or lashed by the court do not attain atonement through their death or lashing unless they repent and confess. Similarly, someone who injures a colleague or damages his property, does not attain atonement, even though he pays him what he owes until he confesses and makes a commitment</p>\n<p>never to do such a thing again as implied by the phrase [Numbers, loc. cit..], \"any of the sins of man.\"</p>\n<p>כָּל מִצְוֹת שֶׁבַּתּוֹרָה בֵּין עֲשֵׂה בֵּין לֹא תַּעֲשֶׂה אִם עָבַר אָדָם עַל אַחַת מֵהֶן בֵּין בְּזָדוֹן בֵּין בִּשְׁגָגָה כְּשֶׁיַּעֲשֶׂה תְּשׁוּבָה וְיָשׁוּב מֵחֶטְאוֹ חַיָּב לְהִתְוַדּוֹת לִפְנֵי הָאֵל בָּרוּךְ הוּא שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (במדבר ה ו) \"אִישׁ אוֹ אִשָּׁה כִּי יַעֲשׂוּ\" וְגוֹ' (במדבר ה ז) \"וְהִתְוַדּוּ אֶת חַטָּאתָם אֲשֶׁר עָשׂוּ\" זֶה וִדּוּי דְּבָרִים. וִדּוּי זֶה מִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה. כֵּיצַד מִתְוַדִּין. אוֹמֵר אָנָּא הַשֵּׁם חָטָאתִי עָוִיתִי פָּשַׁעְתִּי לְפָנֶיךָ וְעָשִׂיתִי כָּךְ וְכָךְ וַהֲרֵי נִחַמְתִּי וּבֹשְׁתִּי בְּמַעֲשַׂי וּלְעוֹלָם אֵינִי חוֹזֵר לְדָבָר זֶה. וְזֶהוּ עִקָּרוֹ שֶׁל וִדּוּי. וְכָל הַמַּרְבֶּה לְהִתְוַדּוֹת וּמַאֲרִיךְ בְּעִנְיָן זֶה הֲרֵי זֶה מְשֻׁבָּח. וְכֵן בַּעֲלֵי חַטָּאוֹת וַאֲשָׁמוֹת בְּעֵת שֶׁמְּבִיאִין קָרְבְּנוֹתֵיהֶן עַל שִׁגְגָתָן אוֹ עַל זְדוֹנָן אֵין מִתְכַּפֵּר לָהֶן בְּקָרְבָּנָם עַד שֶׁיַּעֲשׂוּ תְּשׁוּבָה וְיִתְוַדּוּ וִדּוּי דְּבָרִים שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (ויקרא ה ה) \"וְהִתְוַדָּה אֲשֶׁר חָטָא עָלֶיהָ\". וְכֵן כָּל מְחֻיְּבֵי מִיתוֹת בֵּית דִּין וּמְחֻיְּבֵי מַלְקוֹת אֵין מִתְכַּפֵּר לָהֶן בְּמִיתָתָן אוֹ בִּלְקִיָּתָן עַד שֶׁיַּעֲשׂוּ תְּשׁוּבָה וְיִתְוַדּוּ. וְכֵן הַחוֹבֵל בַּחֲבֵרוֹ וְהַמַּזִּיק מָמוֹנוֹ אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁשִּׁלֵּם לוֹ מַה שֶּׁהוּא חַיָּב לוֹ אֵינוֹ מִתְכַּפֵּר עַד שֶׁיִּתְוַדֶּה וְיָשׁוּב מִלַּעֲשׂוֹת כָּזֶה לְעוֹלָם שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (במדבר ה ו) \"מִכָּל חַטֹּאת הָאָדָם\":</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In chapter two the Rambam goes into more details regarding this , specifically the issue mentioned here, and adds the other fundamental detail that one must \"abandon the sin\", which other rishonim generally agree with as well, and adds that confession without abandoning it is nothing:</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[Who has reached] complete Teshuvah? A person who confronts the same situation in which he sinned when he has the potential to commit [the sin again], and, nevertheless, abstains and does not commit it because of his Teshuvah alone and not because of fear or a lack of strength.</p>\n<p>For example, a person engaged in illicit sexual relations with a woman. Afterwards, they met in privacy, in the same country, while his love for her and physical power still persisted, and nevertheless, he abstained and did not transgress. This is a complete Baal-Teshuvah. This was implied by King Solomon in his statement [Ecclesiastes 12:1] \"Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, [before the bad days come and the years draw near when you will say: `I have no desire for them.'\"]</p>\n<p>If he does not repent until his old age, at a time when he is incapable of doing what he did before, even though this is not a high level of repentance, he is a Baal-Teshuvah.</p>\n<p>Even if he transgressed throughout his entire life and repented on the day of his death and died in repentance, all his sins are forgiven as [Ecclesiastes, op. cit.:2] continues: \"Before the sun, the light, the moon, or the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain...\" - This refers to the day of death. Thus, we can infer that if one remembers his Creator and repents before he dies, he is forgiven.</p>\n<p>א\nאֵי זוֹ הִיא תְּשׁוּבָה גְּמוּרָה. זֶה שֶׁבָּא לְיָדוֹ דָּבָר שֶׁעָבַר בּוֹ וְאֶפְשָׁר בְּיָדוֹ לַעֲשׂוֹתוֹ וּפֵרַשׁ וְלֹא עָשָׂה מִפְּנֵי הַתְּשׁוּבָה. לֹא מִיִּרְאָה וְלֹא מִכִּשְׁלוֹן כֹּחַ. כֵּיצַד. הֲרֵי שֶׁבָּא עַל אִשָּׁה בַּעֲבֵרָה וּלְאַחַר זְמַן נִתְיַחֵד עִמָּהּ וְהוּא עוֹמֵד בְּאַהֲבָתוֹ בָּהּ וּבְכֹחַ גּוּפוֹ וּבַמְּדִינָה שֶׁעָבַר בָּהּ וּפָרַשׁ וְלֹא עָבַר זֶהוּ בַּעַל תְּשׁוּבָה גְּמוּרָה. הוּא שֶׁשְּׁלֹמֹה אָמַר (קהלת יב א) \"וּזְכֹר אֶת בּוֹרְאֶיךָ בִּימֵי בְּחוּרֹתֶיךָ\". וְאִם לֹא שָׁב אֶלָּא בִּימֵי זִקְנוּתוֹ וּבְעֵת שֶׁאִי אֶפְשָׁר לוֹ לַעֲשׂוֹת מַה שֶּׁהָיָה עוֹשֶׂה אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁאֵינָהּ תְּשׁוּבָה מְעֻלָּה מוֹעֶלֶת הִיא לוֹ וּבַעַל תְּשׁוּבָה הוּא. אֲפִלּוּ עָבַר כָּל יָמָיו וְעָשָׂה תְּשׁוּבָה בְּיוֹם מִיתָתוֹ וּמֵת בִּתְשׁוּבָתוֹ כָּל עֲוֹנוֹתָיו נִמְחָלִין שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (קהלת יב ב) \"עַד אֲשֶׁר לֹא תֶחְשַׁךְ הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ וְהָאוֹר וְהַיָּרֵחַ וְהַכּוֹכָבִים וְשָׁבוּ הֶעָבִים אַחַר הַגֶּשֶׁם\" שֶׁהוּא יוֹם הַמִּיתָה. מִכְּלָל שֶׁאִם זָכַר בּוֹרְאוֹ וְשָׁב קֹדֶם שֶׁיָּמוּת נִסְלַח לוֹ:</p>\n<p>2\nWhat constitutes Teshuvah?

[Genesis 32:25]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why was he left alone? Because he remained to retrieve some small jugs. From here we derive that the possessions of the righteous are dearer to them than their bodies. And why do they care so much about their possessions?

Without being miserly, they must watch their pennies and take care not to waste or lose possessions.  But \"<em>their possessions are dearer to them than their own bodies</em>\"?  They endanger their lives to retrieve small possessions?  Isn't the Gemara overstating its case?  What about Pikuach Nefesh?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>By means of introduction, I am reminded of the Mishna in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.20?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 4:20</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי אוֹמֵר, אַל תִּסְתַּכֵּל בַּקַּנְקַן, אֶלָּא בְמַה שֶּׁיֶּשׁ בּוֹ</p>\n<p>Rebbi says: Do not look at the jug but rather at what is in it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, I think it is important to draw attention to the fact that we shouldn't concentrate on the fact that he went to retrieve a small, meaningless jug, but should first ascertain what was in it that warranted him risking his life.</p>\n<p>Indeed, a number of commentaries allude to the fact that this was no ordinary jug and Yaakov realised that it need to be retrieved at all costs for use at a later time.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49412&st=&pgnum=94&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Reuveini</a> (see top left of page) notes where Yaakov actually got hold of this jar. He answers that when Yaakov awoke to see the stones (that had previously been fighting for the right to have the tzaddik's head rest on them) had all fused together into one rock. He found that in this rock there was a jar of oil which he then used to pour over and anoint the matzeiva (the monument) that he built. When he saw that the jar refilled itself he realised that he could not leave it there as it would no doubt serve a holy purpose - It writes there in the Yalkut Reuveini:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חזר וכד נתמלאה. אז ידע יעקב שהוא מזומן לגבוה . אמר אין זה ראוי להניחו כאן</p>\n<p>And the jug returned and refilled itself - then Yaakov knew that it was prepared for a higher purpose. He said this is not fitting to leave here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20767&st=&pgnum=97&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifsei Cohen</a> notes <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20767&st=&pgnum=91&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> also how it refilled itself and how it would be repeatedly used throughout history including the anointing of Aharon and his sons, for Kings, for Eliyahu HaNavi and the wife of Ovadia HaNavi.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, this was no ordinary jug.</p>\n<p>Various commentators (e.g. the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.91a.22?lang=bi&p2=Megaleh_Amukot.66.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megale Amukos</a>) point to the fact that this jar of oil would later be the jar of oil used in the Chanukah miracle.</p>\n<p>This theme is developed beautifully by Rabbi Sam Shor <a href=\"https://issuu.com/anglomedia/docs/torah_tidbits_issue_1351/50\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> who quotes the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35578&st=&pgnum=118&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Imrei Noam</a> by <a href=\"https://hevratpinto.org/tzadikim_eng/198_rabbi_meir_horowitz.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Meir Horowitz of Dzhikov</a> who writes that this jar of oil originated from the olive leaf that dove brought back to Noach (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.8.11?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 8:11</a>) which he pressed and turned into oil. This jar was passed on to his son Shem, who then sealed the jar and passed it on to Avraham. The jar made its way on to Yitzchak and then Yaakov. One of the jars that Yaakov went to retrieve was precisely this jar(!) i.e. this was not just a small jar - it was one that would be used as part of the service of the Beis Hamikdash and was therefore worth going back for. Rav Shor concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yaakov Avinu, even as he is about encounter his brother Eisav, with great trepidation, realises through ruach hakodesh, that he has arrived at the sacred space where the future Beit Hamikdash will stand, and he suddenly realises that he must place that small jar of oil that has been handed down to him, and hid it safely away, so that one day, the Chashmonaim, will find this oil, and miraculously restore the light of Torah, through the nes pach shemen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Entrap and deceive his father with his mouth - [Rashi knows this] because it says יודע ציד, implying that it requires wisdom. Otherwise it would mean the same as, “A man of the field.” Furthermore, [Rashi knows this] because איש ציד is the opposite of איש תם, just as איש שדה is the opposite of יושב אוהלים. And if איש ציד meant trapping animals, it would not be the opposite of איש תם. A wholesome man could also trap animals!

Then the second use of איש is to demonstrate what they did with their time. So איש שדה by Esav is used to mirror Yaakov's practise of sitting in tents i.e. whereas Yaakov's occupation was sitting in tents, Esav's sole practise was to be a man of the field.</p>\n\n\n",

Such a way would have numerous benefits - everybody would be happy, he wouldn't have to disrespect his father, he wouldn't need to run away from his brother and hide for two decades putting his parents in misery.</p>\n<p>So why didn't Yaakov choose to explain the truth to his father and let his father deal with Eisov's lies instead of staging a hoax that everybody suffered from for decades?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems from many commentaries that Yitzchak was indeed aware of Esav's negative habits, and that even so Yitzchak was trying to encourage Esav to become righteous. By blessing him he would give him the power to overcome his negative habits.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Nataf brings a very interesting explanation in the <a href=\"https://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/parsha/redeeming-relevance-in-the-bible-francis-nataf/redeeming-relevance-esav-the-off-the-derekh-patriarch/2020/12/01/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JewishPress.com</a> from the Medrash (Shir Hashirim Zuta 1:13) that Esav had the potential to be the <strong>fourth Patriarch!!</strong></p>\n<p>Esav had great potential that Yitzchak was trying to encourage.</p>\n<p>As an online commentator stated: \"According to Midrashim and other sources, Esau possessed great potential. His spiritual and physical powers exceeded even those of his saintly father and brother. Being \"a digger of wells,\" Isaac saw deep into Esau's soul and recognized that it hailed from a loftier place -- and that's why he loved Esau more that Jacob. That's why Isaac tried to steer Esau onto the path of righteousness by giving him the blessing.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is possible, and this is only speculation, that Jacob wanted the blessing instead. Just as a prince might deceive his father in order to steal the title of a king from the rightful heir. True, Rebecca loved Jacob more than Esau, but Isaac erred in preferring Esau over Jacob, prompting Rebecca to tell Jacob to mislead his father and give him the blessing instead. I think this was wrong. The Tanakh recounts this as unfavorable when Jacob was exiled for many years.</p>\n<p>The truth is that there is simply no way of knowing what Jacob was thinking at the time. We can only guess. And anything we guess is subject to speculation. My bet is that Jacob wanted to teach Esau a moral lesson. Esau didn't appreciate the blessings in his life. If Jacob took the blessing meant for Esau, Esau would realize the value of his family and the many blessings that G-d gave him. He would not have sold his birthright for a bowl of lentil soup. He was selfish, only looking after himself, pleasing his own hunger. In contrast, Isaac was selfless, looking after his brother who did not even show up to receive the blessing. Where was Esau anyway?</p>\n<p>And to end this with another question, when Isaac realized it was Jacob, why couldn't he retract the blessing? Aren't blessing allowed to be nullified?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>When Yaakov entered to receive the <em>berachos</em>, it says</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%9B%D7%96_%D7%9B%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%9B%D7%96_%D7%9B%D7%96</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּגַּשׁ וַיִּשַּׁק לוֹ וַיָּרַח אֶת רֵיחַ בְּגָדָיו וַיְבָרֲכֵהוּ\nוַיֹּאמֶר רְאֵה רֵיחַ בְּנִי כְּרֵיחַ שָׂדֶה אֲשֶׁר בֵּרֲכוֹ יְהוָה.</p>\n<p>And he drew close and he kissed him and he smelt the scent of his\nclothes and he said, \"Behold the scent of my son is like the scent of\nthe field that has been blessed by Hashem.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The medrash comments</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בשעה שנכנס אבינו יעקב אצל אביו נכנסה עמו גן עדן הדא הוא דא”ל ראה ריח\nבני כריח השדה</p>\n<p>When Yaakov entered to be close to his father the scent of Gan Eden\nentered with him...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In reference to your question, it would seem that a point that the medrash is making is as follows:</p>\n<p>If you directly address an issue in the sphere of activity in which you are operating, then you will <em>always</em> cause a perturbation within that sphere of activity.

    "content": "# Why didn't God intervene in the story of Itzhak's blessings to Eisav?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We can see God intervening in numerous situations in the Book of Genesis, revealing His divine plans to our forefathers, saving them, and preventing them from falling into different traps. However, in the whole Parasha of Itzhak's blessing, God keeps completely silent for years and doesn't reveal Eisov's true nature.</p>\n<p>Why didn't He reveal to Itzhak that Eisov lies to him? Why didn't He intervene in the story of the blessings and prevent the mess it caused? Why didn't He talk to Yaakov and advise him to choose a different way of handling the situation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Because we as readers of the story always take for granted that what happened in the story was either necessary to happen, or supposed to happen for some reason. Very few people actually ask the question of whether any of it was actually necessary.</p>\n<p>For example, did Isaac even need to bless his Jacob or Esau? Isaac was never blessed by Abraham before Abraham died and everything that was supposed to happen according to God's plan...continued to happen according to God's plan. In fact Scripture even tells us that God is the one to bless Isaac, hinting that the only blessing that truly matters comes from God directly.</p>\n<p>Genesis 25:11</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יא  וַיְהִי, אַחֲרֵי מוֹת אַבְרָהָם, וַיְבָרֶךְ אֱלֹהִים, אֶת-יִצְחָק בְּנוֹ; וַיֵּשֶׁב יִצְחָק, עִם-בְּאֵר לַחַי רֹאִי.  {פ}    11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi. {P}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it's entirely possible that this idea of blessing is something the Patriarchs decided to do culturally, but it might have little religious or divine value. Therefore, Isaac didn't need to bless anyone for God's will to continue to manifest, therefore God didn't see any real need to intervene with the blessings.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Evidence that Yaakov did the right thing in fooling his father to get the brachos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I see a lot of questions on the topic, but maybe not one that is this specific. I'd like to know, when Yaakov Avinu (with Rivka his mother) went to fool Yitzchak and get the brachos, is there evidence from Chazal or Rishonim that he was doing exactly the right thing?<br />\nTo explain the question a little more:<br />\na) I am not ח\"ו suggesting that Yaakov Avinu did a terrible thing, was a bad person at the time, anything like that. I am asking if this is a similar example to what Chazal say about Avraham Avinu when he said, במה אדע (or a couple of other possibilities in Nedarim 32a), and as a result our nation needed to go down into Mitzrayim for hundreds of years as a tikkun. Avraham Avinu was an incredible tzaddik beyond our understanding, and any mistake he made was something that would only be counted against a tzaddik on his level. Still, Chazal do say it there.<br />\nb) There is good reason to say <em>something</em> like that, as Chazal do mention a number of very negative consequences to fooling his father, in Midrashim: his being fooled later by Leah, his being fooled later by his sons about Yosef's death, his being punished for failing to do kibbud av v'eim for many years when he had to flee. These sound like מדה כנגד מדה and indeed that phrase is used on at least one of them. Are these the equivalent of the Chazal about Avraham Avinu?<br />\nHowever, some acharonim go out of their way to push these away, that they are not evidence of any wrong-doing, but simply <em>consequences</em>, some things Yaakov had to suffer through even though he had done exactly right.<br />\nc) Rivka told him to do it? Of course, he was a tzaddik, she was a tzadeikis, so that doesn't seem to do more than move the question over to her. But she seems to be acting out of nevuah (Bereishis 27:13 עלי קללתך - some explain that she knew he would succeed). I don't think we believe that a neviah can't do anything wrong, but - I would accept evidence that she heard from nevuah that he was <em>supposed</em> to do this, exactly this.<br />\nSame with Rashi on Bereishis 27:1, \"Yitzchak's vision became dimmed, because... דבר אחר, כדי שיטול יעקב את הברכות - in order that Yaakov should take the berachos.\" But it might mean, certainly must include, \"in order that Yaakov should be <em>able</em> to take the berachos\".<br />\nd) For this suggestion to make any sense, I guess I'd need to offer an alternative: What else was he supposed to do? It would be a disaster for Esav to get the brachos, and (see Drashos Haran, can't remember where) it seems that Yitzchak indeed had the power to give them to him!<br />\nI would think that the alternative would need to be, like everywhere else in Sefer Bereishis: You are supposed to trust in Hashem and not use force to gain advantage over your brother. Yitzchak Avinu was a navi too - even blind and fooled by his son. Maybe you couldn't really fool him! See here: He needed to be fed mat'amim, or he couldn't bless the unworthy Esav. When Yaakov came in, he smelled Gan Eden. The blessing he actually gave Yaakov was directly based on <em>what he sensed</em>: 'ראה, ריח בני כריח השדה אשר ברכו ה... (\"See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that G-d blessed...\") When Esav finally did come in, Yitzchak sensed gehinnom.<br />\nMaybe Jewish history would have been different if Esav had tried to get the blessings straight, and saw that Yitzchak just couldn't give them to him. Maybe Esav could have found his way home.<br />\nAnyhow - that's the question. Is this incorrect, and who says so?<br />\nAddendum: I discuss a lot of this here <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hdsyqy-8YSk1G3ZWWyee9u4dwkSyxrbO/view?usp=drive_link\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bitachon and Hishtadlus, Yosef, Yaakov and Rivkah</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/27.13#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Onkelos</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַאֲמַרַת לֵיהּ אִמֵּיהּ עֲלַי אִתְאֲמַר בִּנְבוּאָה דְּלָא יֵיתוֹן\nלְוָטַיָּא עֲלָךְ בְּרִי בְּרַם קַבֵּיל מִנִּי וְאִיזֵיל סַב לִי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/27.13#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> connects the <em>curse</em> to the nevuah that Rivkah received from Shem</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עלי קללתך בני – אין לי ולך לירא מן הקללה שהרי בטוחה אני כמה שאמר הקב״ה\nורב יעבד צעיר (בראשית כ״ה:כ״ג).1</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other meforshim coonect to Targum Onkelos as well</p>\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that it was actually Rivkah who determined that this was necessary and commanded Yaakov to do this.

Right from the\nbeginning his mother appealed for his blind obedience to her orders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, Rav Hirsch points out, that Rivkah intended from the very beginning that Yitzchak would realize what she had done. It was the very crudeness of the <em>trick</em> that opened Yitzchak's eyes to the problem of Eisav.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And altogether, how crude was the whole comedy, a couple of goat\nskins, what but the most absolute naivete could be taken in by that! What could\nher intention have been by playing such a comedy? What else but the\ncomedy itself! <em>Only thus, if just the inevitable discovery was what\nwas beforehand reckoned on</em>, only then does the whole story make\nsense, and, from Rebecca's point of view, become understandable, and -\neven if not completeley approved of - in the circumstances, quite\nexcusable.\nThanks to @robev for pointing to the Vilna Gaon as the source of the following.\nAs she says in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8222/showrashi/true#v13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Toldos 77:13</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתֹּ֤אמֶר לוֹ֙ אִמּ֔וֹ עָלַ֥י קִלְלָֽתְךָ֖ בְּנִ֑י אַ֛ךְ שְׁמַ֥ע\nבְּקֹלִ֖י וְלֵ֥ךְ קַח־לִֽי:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>ע - עשו\nל - לבן\nי - יוסף</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.partnersintorah.org/parsha-partner/toldot/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Partners in Torah</a> explains</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Hebrew, the word for “upon me” is “Alai” [Ayin, Lamed, Yud]. These\nletters are an acrostic for the names, Esau, Laban, Yosef (Joseph),\nand represent the three major instances of hardship that Jacob would\nsuffer in his lifetime. His mother reassured him that this decision\nwould indeed bear consequences, but they would be nothing more than\nthe following three examples. – Gaon of Vilna</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a shiur discussing this, I was told that each of these three were already decreed to be the sufferings of Yaakov and would have happened in any case. Also, each of these show the reason why Yaakov needed to get the bracha himself rather than allow Yitzchak to make the mistake of giving the material bracha to Eisav. Thus, Rivka knew that Yitzchak would realize his mistake. Indeed, in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8222/showrashi/true#v33\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Toldos 27:33</a> Yitzchak says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גַּם־בָּר֖וּךְ יִֽהְיֶֽה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Rashi says Yaakov was indeed the one who needed to get the bracha.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He, too, shall be blessed: That you should not say that had Jacob not\ndeceived his father, he would not have received the blessings.\nTherefore, he concurred and blessed him intentionally (Gen. Rabbah\n67:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that Yitzchak wanted the two brothers to maintain the family with Eisav being the material leader and Yaakov being the spiritual leader. He wanted the two brothers to be as united as the 12 shvatim were going to be. He wanted Eisav to be in the position of Yehudah (the kings) and Yaakov to be in the position of Levi (the priests). Unfortunately, Eisav would not have allowed himself to give Yaakov the equivalent of terumah and ma'aser and was not worthy of being the <em>king</em> of the family. As Rav Hirsch says on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8222/showrashi/true#v37\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Toldos 27:37</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For now it had become clear to him, how in the Abrahamic nation,\neverything and everybody, soldiers, merchants, etc. too, have to be\nfilled with the Abrahamic spirit. So that he no longer saw any\nposition in the House of Abraham for Esau.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that Rivkah realized, having grown up with Lavan that Eisav could not be allowed to control the material well-being of the family. Eisav himself realized that he did not deserve the bracha that Yitzchak had reserved for Yaakov.</p>\n\n\n",

This seemed to him tremendously ironic, to protest the country while holding the country's flag, and so he decided a new flag was needed. Just a few days prior he seems to have seen a sign that had a \"beautiful crown\" on it, so he took the sign with him and saved it. After the protest, he went to an advertising agency called א.מ. איקס פרסום (A.M. X Pirsum), whose owner was close to Chabad. Ben Ari worked with the agency's graphic designer, deciding to put the crown he liked in the center and the word Moshiach beneath, so everyone will know which king the flag is referring to. Seemingly on a whim, he chose the colors yellow, blue and red, but really it was because he had seen some time earlier a Chabad-Moshaich event in which Chabad sent vehicles all over Israel with signs in those colors that read \"Baruch Habah Melech Hamashiach\" (Welcome, the King Messiah) (It seems this campaign's color scheme was based off of the flags printed for Simchat Torah, or perhaps they were part of the same campaign).</p>\n<p>As noted both by Chabadpedia and the linked article, in the first version of the flag, the crown was red and the text was blue, as can be seen here (the small flag):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AlPnB.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AlPnB.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>After finishing the design, Ben Ari went to receive the approval of a \"Geulah-expert\" named <a href=\"https://chabadinfo.com/bdh/rabbi-zimroni-thank-you/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Zimroni Zelig Tzik</a>. With the rabbi, the final text, which included only the word \"משיח\" (Moshiach) was approved. From there he went to print the first batch of flags, which were first waved in a Chabad march for the Geulah on the 9th of Av of that year in Tzfat. After that, he decided to change the colors a bit because he was told the flag would look even more beautiful that way.</p>\n<p><strong>The Design:</strong></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.noahideshop.com/house/28-big-moshiach-flag.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this site</a>, the flag attempts to fulfill the verse \"May we shout for joy in your victory, arrayed by <strong>standards</strong> in the name of our God. May the LORD fulfill your every wish.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.20.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalm 20:6</a>) and also represents \"our strong will to receive the true face (panim in hebrew refers to pnimiut - interior or profundity) of Moshiach (the Messiah) [which] is the highest expression of divinity within a human being, and the model for humanity to live to the up most of his ability.\"</p>\n<p>The yellow background alludes to sunlight (Shemesh HaVaya - The Eternal Light). The crown alludes to Mashiach \"or the Messianic Coronation of Humanity (a human being) provided by God when humanity has achieved it's perfection.\"</p>\n<p>According to the article which brought the story of the flag, many years after the flag was first printed, a man came up to Ben Ari and told him:</p>\n<p>\"How did you manage to create a flag that hits the target so well?\"</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean?\" asked Ben Ari.</p>\n<p>\"According to Kabbalah,\" answered the man. \"there's a deep meaning to the color yellow, which symbolizes war, as it says \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.17.9?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">do battle with Amalek</a>\" and \"צהב\" (Tzahov, yellow) is an acronym of that verse (<strong>צ</strong>א <strong>ה</strong>לחם <strong>ב</strong>עמלק)!

He originally thought of creating a small cloth pin, but when he went back to the same advertising agency and while waiting for the owner, noticed a row of flag-shaped pins designed for various IDF units, which were made of metal. He requested the pin be made like the Chabad Moshiach flag (and out of metal). At first, many people were afraid to wear the pin on their lapels, because apparently it wasn't very fashionable. But then 9/11 came and after that, President Bush started wearing a USA flag pin on his lapels and many world leaders followed suit and from there, many Chabadniks started to wear their pins.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I believe this is a reference to the well-known midrash about the first stand-off between Amalek and Israel, famously <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Deuteronomy.25.18.1?vhe=Rashi_Chumash,_Metsudah_Publications,_2009&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brought by Rashi</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אשר קרך בדרך HOW HE MET THEE BY THE WAY — The word קרך is connected in meaning with מקרה “a sudden happening”, i.e., he came against thee by surprise.

Yet another explanation is that it is connected in meaning with the expression קור in the phrase קור וחום “cold and heat” and it means: he made you cold and lukewarm after the boiling heat you had before. For all the nations were afraid to war against you and this one came and began to point out the way to others. A parable! It may be compared to a boiling hot bath into which no living creature could descend. A good-for-nothing came, and sprang down into it; although he scalded himself he made it appear cold to others (Midrash Tanchuma, Ki Teitzei 9).\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It must have left them in a very awkward position.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>First a bit of context...</p>\n<p>In the years following WWII, the world was in a state of recovery. Although Britain and the USA had forged the Grand Alliance, thereby creating the ‘special relationship’, Britain was nevertheless relegated to the status of a junior partner. The financial strain of war, the failure of partition and the accumulation of refugees languishing in displaced-persons camps, caused the United States to take the lead over the Palestine issue. For the Zionists, the new President, Harry Truman, represented a statesman who could finally accomplish the Zionist dream. For this reason, in the final years of the Mandate, the Zionist camp in Britain increasingly looked to the Americans ahead of the new postwar Attlee government. However, whilst the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yishuv#:%7E:text=The%20Yishuv%20(Hebrew%3A%20%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%91%E2%80%8E,later%20Mandatory%20Palestine%201920%E2%80%931948)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yishuv</a> tolerated the British rule, it could not overthrow its grip of power and Jewish contempt became more outspoken and violent. The Jewish Chronicle (the leading British, Jewish pro-Zionist newspaper est. in 1841) recorded that by 1945, membership of the English Zionist Federation had escalated to 27,000 in number(!)<sup>1</sup>. <strong>Even though this was only about one-tenth of Anglo-Jewry it still represented a major increase in Zionist support</strong>.</p>\n<p>What followed were a number of setbacks, namely the failure of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American_Committee_of_Inquiry\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry</a>,<sup>2</sup> the growth of a more militant reactionary force in the Yishuv via the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehi_(militant_group)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Stern Gang</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Irgun</a> which the British tried to quell in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Agatha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Operation Agatha / Black Sabbath</a> (1946) and then the tremendous wave of illegal immigration that were regularly intercepted, most famously the saga of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Exodus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus Ship</a> in 1947.</p>\n<p>So what happened was a relative shift in the mindset of British Jewry. Whereas previously, there were clear divisions between the Zionists and the Orthodox, there was a now an emerging sense of unity. On the one hand, the more outspoken Zionist camp had to adopt a more revisionist stance as they could not be seen to be supportive of the Irgun and Lehi activities, and those who were largely disinterested became more sympathetic to the cause. The overriding view was that the issue of Palestine was a Jewish concern ahead of Zionist aspirations. <strong>Indeed, Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Herzog defiantly asserted, “This act will be interpreted as an attempt to suffocate the historic movement for Zion’s restoration which aims at putting an end once and for all to Israel’s seemingly endless tragedy by removing the root cause – its homelessness.”</strong> <sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>Following the SS Exodus debacle, even the Jewish Orthodox newspaper, the 'Jewish Weekly' wrote, “Seldom have Jews throughout the world been so united in their indignant feelings at the return from Palestine of the unfortunate 4,500 refugees.\"<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>So on the eve of the declaration of the state, British Jewry had become more centralised, much a result of the postwar situation and the British government's inability to successfully control the region.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 Refer to <em>Jewish Chronicle</em>, 2nd February 1945, ‘Zionist Conference’, p.6.</sup></p>\n<p><sup>2 Whilst Winston Churchill (who was no longer in power) called the commission \"a step in the right direction\", <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Bevin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ernest Bevin</a>, the British Foreign Secretary announced to the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">House of Commons</a>, “<strong>There is a great sense of response, except for one small section, among Jewry, and not all the Jews are Zionists</strong>.” - Hansard Cabinet Debates, 13th November 1945, vol. 415 cc1927-35</sup></p>\n<p><sup>3 As reported in the <em>Jewish Chronicle</em> 5th July 1946,‘Chief Rabbi Herzog’s Plea: Call to British Honour’, p.6.</sup></p>\n<p><sup>4 <em>Jewish Weekly</em>, 1st August 1947, ‘Exodus 1947’, p.1.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Temple Institute menorah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently I was zoche to visit Eretz Yisroel, and my family went on the Temple Institute (Mechon Hamikdash) tour, very interesting. They showed their beautiful menorah, which they said had been made according to halachic specifications and could be actually used when the Beis Hamikdash is rebuilt, בב\"א. I was very surprised when they said it weighed half a ton - as I know that the menorah must weigh a kikar (talent) of pure gold. Not clear how much that is, but something around 50 or 100 pounds (see Wikipedia, and Rashi's calculations at the beginning of Parshas Pikudei). Not even close.<br />\nSo I went to their website, and they have an extensive description of the issues involved <a href=\"https://templeinstitute.org/history-holy-temple-menorah/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://templeinstitute.org/history-holy-temple-menorah/</a>. Kol hakavod for their clarity and transparency. What they said astonished me. Short version: It is hard or impossible to make a strong enough structure of pure gold, especially such a small amount as a kikar. Instead, we made <em>a bronze menorah</em> weighing half a ton. Then we took a single sheet of gold (mikshah) - a millimeter thick (!) - weighing a kikar, and wrapped it over the bronze support structure. That gold is the golden menorah; ignore the bronze underneath.<br />\na) This seems like a cool trick, but I didn't see anyone mentioning this pshat in the Torah. It does not sound like the simple understanding of what Moshe Rabbeinu did (the Midrash mentions that he found it difficult to know how to make the menorah!)<br />\nb) The Rambam says (Beis Habechirah 3(4)) that when other metals are used for the menorah, it may be made hollow (חלולה). When made with gold, on the other hand, it sounds like \"mikshah\" excludes its being hollow; it must be made solid. I saw that the Likutei Halachos on Menachos 28b brings the example of the menorah made by the Chashmonaim when they reconquered: an iron structure coated with tin. You would not be allowed to do that with gold, and that is <em>exactly</em> what they did.<br />\nComments?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I looked at the website, and while I am sure the Temple Institute people mean well, they seem really eccentric. The claim that the menorah couldn't be made out of gold, because gold is a soft metal, seems silly. Just because gold is soft <em>relative to other metals</em> does not mean it can't be made into a menorah.</p>\n<p>The Menorah had a lot of gold. <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/life/torah/how-much-would-the-mishkan-cost-today/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">According to the OU website</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The menorah was 1 kikar of gold.\nAt 3,000 shekel per kikar, and 1/5 an ounce per shekel, that’s 1,500 ounces of gold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traditionaloven.com/metal/gold-converter.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Converted</a> to cubic inches, that is 147.65</p>\n<p>Divided by the eighteen tefachim, that is 83 1/3 ounces 8.2 in^3 and per tefach, or over 20 oz. and 2 in^3 per etzbah, or width of a finger. That seems like plenty to me.</p>\n<p>In addition, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.25.31?lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Exodus.25.31.3&lang2=he&w2=Gur%20Aryeh&lang3=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> says the Menorah was made with Hashem's assistance, so the whole discussion of how the Menorah was technically made is moot.</p>\n<p>As to whether the Menorah could be hollow if it is made out of gold, the wording of Rambam is ambiguous. According to the commentary <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Chosen_Temple.3.4?lang=he&with=Maaseh%20Rokeach&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maaseh Rokeach</a>, this is a dispute between Rav Yosef Karo in Kesef Mishneh (who holds no) and the Mabit in Kiryas Sefer (who holds yes).</p>\n<p>But the Menorah cannot be gold-plated, for the simple reason that the Torah clearly says that the Aron and other vessels were wood plated with gold. By implication, if the Menorah was gold plating, the verse would have said so.</p>\n\n\n",

It was written as an introduction to Netziv's commentary on <em>Shir haShirim</em>. He is one of the first writers who thought about antisemitism, because in prior years Jews were despised for their religion, and with secularisation of European countries the hatred towards Jews became presented as antisemitism.</p>\n<p>One can view <em>deception</em> as one of the indicators of general degradation of the society, as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.9.3-5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jeremiah 9:3-5</a>: (Artscroll translation) \"<em>Let each man beware of his fellow; do not trust any kin! For every kinsman acts perversely and every acquantance mongers slander. Each man mocks his fellow and they do not speak truth; they train their tongue to speak falsehood, striving to be iniquituitous. Your dwelling amidst deceit; because of their deceit they refuse to know Me - the word of Hashem.</em>\"</p>\n<p>In the section \"Israel must be true to itself\" when dealing with the term <em>semites</em> Netziv writes:</p>\n<p>\"The nature of this matter further indicates that when Israel violates its unique form - that is, its Judaism - it becomes lowly and despised in the eyes of the world. This is a general principle in nature: that every higher form that suffers the destruction of that higher formbecomes much more lowly than something that does not initially have particular higher form. For example, in the realms of inanimate, vegetable, living, and speaking (that comprise all creatures). If the vegetable loses its power to grow, it becomes withered and more lowly than the inanimate.</p>\n<p>When human beings lose the power of knowing, they become more lowly than any animal, and a person who damages others is worse than the dangerous animal, as I have explained in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.6.5?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Ha'Amek Davar</em> on Bereshis 6:5</a>. Israel too, when it loses its unique quality - which is Judaism, an elevated form - becomes inferior and resembles a monkey, and is considered a creature without human form altogether.</p>\n<p>This is hinted at in the Scripture, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.6.21?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 6:21</a>: \"Sons were also born to Shem, ancestor of all the descendants of Eber and older brother of Japheth.\" Why is the relation to Japheth mentioned? Why is it necessary to liken Shem to Japheth? And why does it appear (from the ambiguous Hebrew phrase) that Japheth is the older brother of Shem - <em>ahi Yepheth hagadol</em>? (i.e. older can be read as greater). We are being taugh by Scripture that Shem was indeed qualitatively greater than Japheth, and, therefore, with regard to his descendants, who had the same elevated qualities, that is Eberites (Hebrews), Shem was higher. Thus is says, \"... Shem, ancestor of all the descendats of Eber\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.10.22?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 10:21</a>), for they were people of great distiction, greater than the Japhethites.</p>\n<p>Concerning the later it was remarked, \"May G-d enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in tents of Shem ...\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.9.27?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 9:27</a>). This means that the Japhethites will be clever people and they will appreciate the wisdom of Shemites as found in their tents of Torah. This wisdom is Divine and infinite, unlike human knowledge and wisdom. (Specialty of Japheth). They, too, will come to dwell in the tents of Shem to learn proper beliefs and good manners. However, all this only applies to Shemites who reach the status of Eberites, not to those Shemites who do not. The latter are lower in form than the Japhethites, and it is in this reagrd to these that Japheth is greater. Thus, it is debasing for us to be called Semites (by anti-semites) for this is to be more lowly than to be identified as descendants of Japheth the Great. However, when we are called Israelites or Abrahamites, we are on a higher level than the Japhethites.</p>\n<p>Once this is so - that in losing the Israelite form, the human form is lost as well in the eyes of the nations - it should be no surprise if we are considered lowly and despised in their eyes, as if humanity had been removed from us. The prophet <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.8.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hosea 8:8</a> says: \"Israel is devoured, they have become among the nations like an unwanted vessel\". This means that whn Judaism is devoured and remains only in their hearts, while in public they are embarassed about the quarry from which they were hewn, when they have reached that low level, then they will be among the nations like an unwanted vessel that remains to be broken, G-d forbid!\"</p>\n<p>There is much more on the subject. But as one can see, Lavan, Terach, and others were not students of 'Eber and as Netziv notes they gained bad qualities, such as deception as you ask about. In fact, descendands of Aram were known not only for deception but also for their cruelty - another destructive trait. As Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.17a.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 17a</a> states that Israel was supposed to be exiled to Aram after destruction of the first Temple (1), but when HKBH saw the cruelty of Aram, he stopped (the original plan) and exiled them to Bavel.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1) the printed text of the Gemara states ארומאי - Arameans, as Netziv translates. However our editions have a note that it should be corrected to רומאי - Romans. I do not know why the Gemara should speak of Romans at the time of the destruction of the 1st Temple, when they were not a viable power in the Mideteranean, and only after destruction of the 2nd Temple many Jews were taken to Italy as slaves. Also, many wars that Jews fought with Aram showed exessive cruelty of Arameans.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Because the ancient world believed everything was cyclical and doomed to repeat. Sinners and liars would always be sinners and liars. Corrupt kingdoms would always be that way.</p>\n<p>And then you get the Torah narrative which shows people as they are, their sins and their good deeds, and the Torah clearly shows you the price for sins. It's not accidental that Jacob gets swindled by Lavan, it's not accidental that Abraham lies to Pharoah lies to Pharoah and there are problems. It's not accidental that Joseph's brothers lie about what happened to him and the issues that happen to them.</p>\n<p>And then it's not accidental that the Torah focuses on Joseph who seems like he could never lie like his family does. Only to discover him lying to his brothers when he sees them again and acts like he doesn't know them in order to save his brother Benjamin. And we see righteous lying, we see someone who's trying to heal the situation and break the cycle. And indeed in his lifetime he set many things right.</p>\n<p>But then his brothers lied to him when Jacob died, and suddenly the book of Genesis ends and when we begin Shemot we have fast become slaves. Then we get Moses, a murderer, who tries to save an entire nation. The Torah shows us how cycles can be broken, how weaknesses can become strengths. One should read the narratives and feel a connection to flawed characters, and find the strength to rise up as they did to change the world for the better, despite or maybe even because of their flaws.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is a baby born on Shabbos Muktza as Nolad?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is a baby born on Shabbos Muktza as Nolad until the end of Shabbos?</p>\n<p>I mean, he is quite literally Nolad - born on Shabbos. I understand that anything that the baby needs would would obviously be Mutar - the baby would be treated as a Choleh Sheyesh Bo Sakana. I'm asking about handling the baby when it doesn't benefit the baby in any way, for example if you want to change the baby into cuter clothing or something like that.</p>\n<p>(Note that I am aware the Minhag is not to treat the baby as Muktza. I am primarily asking <strong>why the baby is not Muktza</strong>.)</p>\n<p>Any sources you could provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There's a halachah that in certain cases, A can hand something to B, who then hands it to C, etc., such that no person carries it more than four amos. When the Mishnah (<a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=95b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 95b</a>) presents this halachah, it mentions וכן בנו (and so too with his child). <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Eruvin.95b.3.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi there</a> (based on the Gemara, ibid. 97b) explains that this means a baby who was born in the field on Shabbos, and who needs to be transported home.</p>\n<p>So obviously the baby isn't muktzeh, then, otherwise that point would be brought up.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The only source that we find in <em>shas</em> of a new-born child being <em>muktzeh</em> is if it will not live.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.20a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.20a</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בן שמנה הרי הוא כאבן ואסור לטלטלו בשבת אבל אמו שוחה עליו ומניקתו מפני\nהסכנה</p>\n<p>The baraita teaches: And a child born after eight months of pregnancy\nwho is placed in the window reduces its dimensions. The Gemara\nchallenges: Perhaps his mother will come and remove him from there.\nThe Gemara answers: This is referring to Shabbat, when it is\nprohibited to move this child, as it is taught in a baraita: A child\nborn after eight months is like a stone with regard to the halakhot of\nset-aside [muktze], and therefore it is prohibited to move him; but\nhis mother may bend over the child and nurse him, due to the danger\nthat failure to nurse will cause her to fall ill.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is therefore evident that there is no other scenario in which a new-born child is <em>muktzeh</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Onscreen is less of an issue; it's more about in written or print form, what do you then do with the piece of paper.</p>\n<p>(So \"G-d\" is pronounced \"God.\")</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Many people use the number <em>0</em> (zero) rather than substituting '-' for the letter 'o' (such as in JewishWorldReview.com for its columnists) in order to prevent the various editors from putting the letters g and d on separate lines.</p>\n<p>When we were writing the soc.culture.jewish FAQ we used the following question.</p>\n<p>Note: The story below about Rav Soloveitchik was confirmed by a person who was in the class at Boston's Rambam high school when it occurred.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/05-Worship/section-52.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Section - Question 11.3.1: Writing: Why do some people write \"G-d\" with a hyphen instead of an `o'?</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Based on the words in Deut. 12:3-4, the Rabbis deduced that it is\nforbidden to erase the name of G-d from a written document. Since any\npaper upon which G-d's name was written might be discarded and thus\n\"erased\", the Rabbis forbade explicitly writing the name of G-d,\nexcept in Holy Books, with provisions for the proper disposal of such\nbooks.</p>\n<p>According to Jewish Folklore, G-d has 70 names. However, only one of\nthese names is the ineffable name, which cannot be erased or\npronounced. Further, of the 70 names, seven may not be erased but they\ncan be pronounced on certain occasions (such as when reading the\nTorah). The other names may be erased and pronounced, but still must\nbe treated with respect. The Talmud (Shevuot 35a-b) makes it clear\nthat this prohibition applies only to seven Biblical names of G-d and\nnot to other names or attributes of G-d, which may be freely written.\nThe prohibition was later codified by Maimonides (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904982/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Six.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah,\nYesodei HaTorah 6:1-2</a>). The practice of writing \"G-d\" is supported in\nShut Achiezer, 3:32, end, where it is endorsed and accepted as the\nprevailing custom. Rambam cites Deut. 12-03:04, which states \"and you\nshall destroy the names of pagan gods from their places. You shall not\ndo similarly to G-d your Lord.\" The intent of this is to create an\natmosphere of respect for G-d's name vs pagan gods' names.</p>\n<p>As a result of this, people acquired the habit of not writing the full\nname down in the first place. Strictly speaking, this only\napplies to Hebrew on a permanent medium, but many people are\ncareful beyond the minimum, and have applied it to non-Hebrew\nlanguages. Hence, \"G-d\". One explanation is that using G-d is a\nreminder that anything which we may say about G-d is necessarily\nmetaphorical. Spelling out the Name (even in a language other than\nHebrew) would imply that one could speak meaningfully (not just\nmetaphorically) about G-d.</p>\n<p>However, the Shach (Yoreh De'a 179:11) ruled that \"God\" spelled in a\nforeign language does NOT have the status of a \"shem\" and thus\nmay be erased, lehatkhila. There is a story about Rav Soloveitchik\n(z\"l) intentionally writing GOD on the board while teaching a class\nand then just as deliberately and intentionally erasing it, so as\nto demonstrate by his own example that this was not a halakhically\na problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

So it makes sense that it follows the usual rule for adjectives -- \"achat\" with the feminine suffix is used for feminine nouns.</p>\n<p>The fact that \"echad\" and \"achat\" are adjectives whereas the other numbers aren't may explain why Bereishis one goes from the cadinal \"yom echad - one day\" to the ordinal \"yom sheini - second day\", \"yom shelishi - third day\", etc... The numbers above 1 are grammatically different in kind than the others.</p>\n<p>Also explains why there is no ordinal \"echadi\", it's \"rishon\" (first).</p>\n<p>Two is also unique, as \"shtayim\" and \"shenayim\" come with their own suffix for a pair \"-ayim\" built in. We don't get that until \"esrim\" (20), which actually is multiple tens. (Although it's weird that 20 isn't \"esrayim -- a pair of 10s\".)</p>\n<p>Because shenayim/shtayim is a noun, we use semichut to make a phrase. \"Shetei yadayim -- two of hands\", following a construction like \"Benei Yisrael -- children of Israel\". But the semichut does require gender to match.</p>\n<p>(Another language oddity with \"shtayim\" is that in proto-Semitic it was \"ashtayim\", with a leading syllable we still see in \"ashtei asar\". So, the word is \"shtayim\" and \"shtei\", with the sheva under the shin a silent sheva nach.)</p>\n<p>Now we get to your question... Numbers above 2.</p>\n<p>Now we get to nouns (unlike echad/achat) that don't have the plurality suffix built in (unlike shenayim/shatyim). And why does the form used with masculine nouns have the usual structure for feminine words, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Well, the first part of the answer I do have is that they're nouns, not adjectives. So there is no rule about the genders having to match. \"Shalosh\" means more like \"a set of three\" than just \"three\". \"Sheloshah avos -- a set of three, all forefathers.\"</p>\n<p>As for the second half, I'll share what's just a guess: How do you pair nouns? Well, human couples (at least as halakhah recognizes them) come in male and female pairs.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why hasn't the coronavirus pandemic had a greater impact on kashrut supervision?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When the pandemic first began I expected dramatic repercussions to kashrut certification. Being a novice in this area I had understood that certifying organizations would need to be physically present to inspect factories, check ingredients etc. When countries were in lock-down and even when those restrictions were lifted I don't imagine physical inspections were common or at times even possible.\nBut I have not heard or read of any massive removal, even temporarily, of kashrut certifications.\n(How) has adequate inspection continued?</p>\n<p>I have heard that inspections were being done virtually at times, but I have a hard time believing that trusting an employee of a factory to walk around with a tablet is the standard of kashrut certification most customers expect.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if such a thing is acceptable could it not then become the new standard which would eliminate the need for travel and staff and perhaps thereby reducing the cost of certification to the producers?\nIn the end I would like to understand how and why the pandemic has not had a perceptible impact on kashrut certification</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Shevuah worded in the negative",
    "content": "# Shevuah worded in the negative\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've been bothered for a long time: Throughout Tanach, shevuos (oaths) and brisos (covenants) are phrased in the negative (where it doesn't just say, I swear __, like בי נשבעתי ___). Generally language indicating acceptance of some major punishment if the oath is violated, such as כה יעשה ה' לי וכה יוסיף, followed by אם and some condition that - if violated - will bring the punishment.<br />\nOne example is in this week's parsha (Bereishis 31:48-50):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּאמֶר לָבָן הַגַּל הַזֶּה עֵד בֵּינִי וּבֵינְךָ הַיּוֹם כו' וְהַמִּצְפָּה אֲשֶׁר אָמַר יִצֶף ה' בֵּינִי וּבֵינֶךָ כִּי נִסָּתֵר אִישׁ מֵרֵעֵהוּ: אִם־תְּעַנֶּה אֶת־בְּנֹתַי וְאִם־תִּקַּח נָשִׁים עַל־בְּנֹתַי אֵין אִישׁ עִמָּנוּ רְאֵה אֱלֹהִים עֵד בֵּינִי וּבֵינֶךָ\n\"Let this pile be a witness between us today... and this lookout, that Hashem should look between us when we are hidden from one another... If you make my daughters suffer, if you take other wives besides my daughters... Hashem will see...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, Yaakov is agreeing <em>not</em> to do those things. And this is the norm in all the many dozens of such shevuos in Tanach.<br />\nSo why is this rule broken, just a couple of lines later (ibid:52):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עֵד הַגַּל הַזֶּה וְעֵדָה הַמַּצֵּבָה אִם־אָנִי לֹא־אֶעֱבֹר אֵלֶיךָ אֶת־הַגַּל הַזֶּה וְאִם־אַתָּה לֹא־תַעֲבֹר אֵלַי אֶת־הַגַּל הַזֶּה וְאֶת־הַמַּצֵּבָה הַזֹּאת לְרָעָה<br />\n\"Let this pile be a witness, this lookout be a witness, if I do <em>not</em> cross this pile to you, if you do <em>not</em> cross this pile and this lookout to me, to do ill.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They ought to be promising that neither should cross over to make war on one another. But the wording sounds like the opposite of the usual rule. Why? And are there other counter-examples?</p>\n<p>Update: truth is that Rashi addresses this question: אם אני. הֲרֵי אִם מְשַׁמֵּשׁ בִּלְשׁוֹן אֲשֶׁר, כְּמוֹ עַד אִם דִּבַּרְתִּי דְּבָרָי: - <em>Here the word אם is used in the sense of אשר “that”, as (Genesis 24:33) “until that (אם) I have spoken my words”.</em>\nI'm still puzzled, though: Doesn't a deal have to be unambiguous? How can they make a deal where the word אם is used in an unusual way which reverses the meaning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>Direction</em> for an answer? B\"h, found a Seforno who backs up my claim, and says something about an exception (Bereishis 14:23):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם מחוט ועד שרוך נעל כל אם שבמקרא כשלא יבא אחריו פועל תנאי יהיה במקום מלת שלא אמר א''כ הרימותי ידי שלא מחוט ועד שרוך נעל אוכל ליתן לך שאין בידי כלום ושלא אקח מכל אשר לך. וכן אם יראו את הארץ שלא יראו. אם אתם תבאו שלא תבאו. חי ה' אם יומת שלא יומת. חי ה' אשר עמדתי לפניו אם אקח שלא אקח וזולתם רבים<br />\nאם מחוט ועד שרוך נעל, every time the word אם occurs in Scripture <em>and is not followed by a verb making it a conditional statement</em> [ital. mine], it is used instead of the word שלא, “so that not.” Avram’s statement here means: “I have sworn an oath not to give you even a shoelace or a length of thread as I do not own any of these things. Conversely, I will also not take (accept) anything that is (was) yours.” G’d said something similar to the Jewish people after the debacle of the spies in Numbers 14,23) when He said אם יראו את הארץ, which is a way of saying that they will most certainly not get to see the land (of Israel). In verse 30 in the same chapter the words אם אתם תבאו also mean “you will certainly not come.” Similarly, Samuel I 15,6 חי ה' אם יומת, means “an oath to G-d that he will not be executed, etc.” Also, in Kings II 5,16 'חי ה' אשר עמדתי לפניו אם אקח וגו, means: “As the Lord lives whom I serve, I will not accept anything.” There are many similar examples. [See also the Seforno on Bamidbar 14:23.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His words, \"and is not followed by a verb making it a conditional statement\", might apply to our case? I am not sure how you tell, though; all these cases have a verb and seemingly could be considered conditional. He didn't give an example of that type.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Yaakov, Lavan, and the sheep deal(s)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Yaakov tells Lavan that \"You changed my wages ten times.\" [Chazal: actually a hundred times.] It's a sad story. If Lavan had just given Yaakov normal wages, מחצית שכר - splitting the outcome - or some other fraction of the outcome, then Yaakov becoming wealthy would have inevitably meant that Lavan became wealthy with him, as partners.<br />\nBut Lavan couldn't turn away from trying to cheat his son-in-law. He could never believe that he couldn't game the setup, couldn't find a way to get everything and leave his beloved son-in-law with nothing. So he kept changing the rules, over and over, and could never accept that he was going to lose as a result of being unwilling to work together. Sad, pathetic.<br />\nMy question is on the details. The first time, it seems to be very clearly explained: Yaakov will get all the striped or speckled etc. sheep and/or goats born. Right now, Lavan will remove all the striped or speckled ones, leaving only ones that Yaakov won't get. Then when new ones are born, if they are striped or speckled (they shouldn't be!) only then would Yaakov get them. As Yaakov says (Bereishis 30:33),</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעָנְתָה־בִּי צִדְקָתִי בְּיוֹם מָחָר כִּי־תָבוֹא עַל־שְֹכָרִי לְפָנֶיךָ כֹּל אֲשֶׁר־אֵינֶנּוּ נָקֹד וְטָלוּא בָּעִזִּים וְחוּם בַּכְּשָֹבִים גָּנוּב הוּא אִתִּי<br />\n\"My righteousness will answer for me in the future, if you come to my wages before you: anything that is not speckled or striped among the goats, or brown among the sheep - it would be stolen by me.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is set up to be easy to tell whose sheep are whose.<br />\nWhat I don't understand is what happens after that. If Lavan <em>changes the wages</em>: From now on, Yaakov gets all the akudim - striped at the ankles, then striped at the midsection, etc. - but not speckled ones. Do you switch them all around at that point, Yaakov trades in all the speckled ones for a lot of white ones, then they do it again? Are the birthings separated enough in time (with special seasons, see first mishnah in Rosh Hashana) so that you could tell that the speckled ones are from birthing 1 and the striped are from birthing 2? Or do they give up on that level of \"my righteousness will answer for me\", accepting that after a while the animals are all mixed up together and Lavan will need to be sure to show up at birthings and retrieve all his new animals?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Not sure what exactly he's saying, but see here (Seforno Bereishis 30:40):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אל עקוד וכל חום בצאן לבן אחר שהחליף משכרתו והשאיר בעדרו עקוד וכל חום:<br />\nאל עקוד וכל חום בצאן לבן,\nthis was after Lavan had already changed the wages of the contract by leaving to Yaakov lambs [with different skin patterns than had been agreed to originally] akud and with any brown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I saw the edition of Seforno by R' Y. Leifer, where he explains that in the original deal, Yaakov would not have had any akud or brown of Lavan's (בצאן לבן) to work with, they were all taken away; so this must be after Lavan changed the rules and did an exchange. I think.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You can't assume that the deals are well thought out when Laban is obsessed with coming out on top.</p>\n<p>Laban may insist on inconveniencing himself by attending all the birthings or he may just arbitrarily accuse Yaakov of cheating when he doesn't attend the birthings and doesn't like the outcome. The point is that Lavan will lie, cheat, invent contrivances, and threaten his worker and Yaakov has no recourse other than the personal protection of the Master of the Universe. It could be that Rachel does the shepherding because no shepherd was willing to put up with his nonsense.</p>\n\n\n",

The standard answer given to almost all questions on the structure of the mishna, is \"for memorization purposes,\" which may be true. Is there another way to explain the need for such a non-obvious structure?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Usually these questions are discussed by the commentators. The only case I remember seeing the reason for a Mishnah being written a certain way being given as for memorization is the first Mishnah in Megillah (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.4b?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Megillah.4b.7&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> to daf 4b.)</p>\n<p>I have heard that חיסורי מחסרא's, or cases of missing lines in the Mishnah were done for memorization purposes, but I don't recall seeing that in an authoritative sefer. I would look in the commentators for a better answer before defaulting to that one.</p>\n<p>For example: The Mishnah in Kesubos is discussed by the M'leches Shlomo, who writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מבואר הוא קשר משנה זו עם שלפניה דברישא קתני פסקה לו אלף דינר שהוא עסקא רבא ובתר הכי קתני פסקה לו כספים סלעא נעשה ששה דינרין דהיינו עסקא זוטא כדכתיבנא וקתני נמי בינייהו שומא רבא ושומא זוטא כדכתיבנא והשתא קתני דעני שבעניים לא יפחות מחמשים זוז אם הוא משיא בתו סתם ובתר הכי קתני גרוע שבכולן דהיינו פסק להכניסה ערומה ובתר הכי קתני דאפי' הנשאית מארנקי של צדקה דינה כעני שבעניים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically, the Mishnayos discuss cases in descending order in terms of possible dowries. The Mishna before discusses someone who says 1000 dinar, then just money in general. Next is the dowry for the poorest of the poor, followed by a case where there is no dowry at all. This concludes the list of possible dowries.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, the Mishnah teaches that an orphan whose dowry is provided from charity gets at least as much as the poorest of the poor. Since it is not actually a category of its own, it is mentioned at the end as being part of an earlier category.</p>\n<p>Another point I would make is that since the next mishnah deals with an orphan, it makes sense to put the case of the orphan at the end so that it will lead into the next Mishna.</p>\n\n\n",

Please provide sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Since I was one of the ones who asked you, I'm just giving my own impressions. I always imagine the Torah has different levels of interpretation. One of the levels is what we call the world of בחירה, where people make choices and the choices lead to different results. That's the world where most of us <i>see</i> ourselves.<br />\nThere is another world, the world of ידיעה, Hashem's knowledge. This world is also 100% true at the same time, even though we don't well understand how that works. In that world, our choices and the results are all designed in advance, known to Hashem, built into his world.  See the Rambam Hilchos Teshuva 5(5) for his discussion of these two pictures of the world.<br />\nIt seems to me that a common difficulty people have in reading Midrashim is that Midrashim frequently live in the second world. This one is destined that __ should happen, this event implies __ in the future as a consequence...<br />\nBut we are used to the world of Bechirah. And the Torah can and should be understood both ways; the people in the stories, their actions, and their attitudes, need to be consistent with their bechirah and free choices.<br />\nAnyhow, what you were describing from the Ari z\"l is a Yediah type of picture, where there's an overall framework and the characters are filling their parts. It does <em>not</em> mean - to me - that Yaakov Avinu knew his part and understood the events that he was going to fulfill; if he knew them consciously that would actually interfere with his free choices, just as it would interfere with ours.<br />\nThe Midrashim <em>do</em> frequently hint at people's connection to their destiny, presenting things as if they know about them. \"Leah didn't want to have a seventh son because she knew there would be exactly twelve and that meant Rachel would get only one...\" but I don't think that should be understood as being in the conscious forefront of their minds, for the reason I gave.<br />\nYaakov may well have been destined to marry both, but the simple reading of the Torah seems to say clearly that he <em>planned</em> to marry only one. And that he was very distressed when he ended up married to Leah instead. His reaction to being fooled - and the Midrash adds that Leah reminded him that this was similar to what he had done to his own father - led directly to his (initial) difficulties in their relationship. All of that is the normal development of events in the world of Bechirah.<br />\nUpdate. I see that I should add: The obvious and correct answer to this question is, Midrash is one thing, and p'shat is another. It is easy to find mefarshim who learn the p'shat differently from the Ari z\"l; as I said in the earlier post, I had never seen anything else!<br />\nWhat I was trying to provide here was an understanding of <em>why</em> the Midrash and p'shat can seem to be saying such different things, without that being a problem - unlike the position of so many people I've seen who struggle with them as \"contradictions\". And, to provide at least one <em>filter</em> that can help a person detect which type of peirush he is looking at.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The obvious reading of the <em>chumash</em> itself is that <em>Yaakov</em> had no interest whatsoever in marrying <em>Lea</em> , and that there was no known destiny to do so (neither his nor <em>Esav</em>'s).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please provide sources.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Any Torah commentary that doesn't mention the <em>midrashim</em> you seem to be taking as gospel.

    "content": "# Why isn't Heavenly judgement final and exhaustive and requires Earthy retribution?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many Biblical and Rabbinic sources speak of the Earthy retribution - a person suffers (is justly punished) in this Earthy world because of the sins of previous generations. For example,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אֵל קַנָּא פֹּקֵד עֲוֺן אָבֹת עַל־בָּנִים עַל־שִׁלֵּשִׁים וְעַל־רִבֵּעִים לְשֹׂנְאָי׃\" - For I the LORD your God am an impassioned God, <strong>visiting the guilt of the parents upon the children</strong>, upon the third and upon the fourth generations of those who reject Me\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.20.5?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus.20.5</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, billions of people (Jews included) through history suffered from starvation, enslavement, wars, diseases, and more, and rabbis often ascribe all that to their \"ancestral sins\".</p>\n<p>But why isn't Heavenly judgment exhaustive to punish a person for all his sins and continue no suffering onto the following generations?</p>\n<p><em>Please refrain from referring to our intellectual inferiority.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Since I do not think that G-d has emotions and since I agree with Maimonides that G-d does not become angry, it does not make sense that G-d would punish innocent people for generations. I take another approach.</p>\n<p>I think Maimonides answered this well. I just read an excellent essay today by Professor Warren Zev Harvey about Jewish views of evil. In the essay, Harvey reveals that Maimonides felt that the Babylonians and Romans destroyed the Temples because Jews focused on bad theology, not military preparations (Art of war).[1] Thus, Rambam writes that all evil is the deprivation of knowledge. Rather than attribute the evils of the world to devils or satans, Rambam points evil to humanity. It is man’s responsibility to repulse evil. And it is man's fault for bringing evil into the world. Not a cosmic force.</p>\n<p>This is also the view of Rabbi Dr. Eliezer Berkovits. He felt that “because of our sins,” was “[no longer] a satisfactory explanation.”[2]</p>\n<p>The verse, “and that by no means clears the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and fourth generation,” means that people should realize that every act, whether good or bad has consequences. People should be responsible because some actions can have long-lasting effects that may last for generations. Before the Native American Indians made any decision or new policy, they would always consult their wise leaders and took into consideration at least seven generations in the future. This wise teaching can be found in the Bible.</p>\n<p>[1] I credit this to Rabbi Natan Slifkin who pointed this out to me in Rambam’s letter to the Jews of Marseilles</p>\n<p>[2] See his book G-d, Man and history, Crisis and Faith. And Major Themes in Modern Jewish Philosophy</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>No one is punished only because  of ancestral sins.</p>\n<p>The Torah very clearly says לא יומתו אבות על בנים   and איש בחטאו יומתו (Devarim 24:15)</p>\n<p>The Gemara (Sanhedrin 27B) asks about \"אֵל קַנָּא פֹּקֵד עֲוֺן אָבֹת עַל־בָּנִים עַל־שִׁלֵּשִׁים וְעַל־רִבֵּעִים לְשֹׂנְאָי and answers that this is speaking about a situation where the children are continuing to do the sins of their ancestors so they are getting punished for what they are doing.And even then it only goes on for four generation. Unlike reward which as the posuk continues goes on for two thousand generations.</p>\n<p><em>In fact, billions of people (Jews included) through history suffered from starvation, enslavement, wars, diseases, and more, and rabbis often ascribe all that to their \"ancestral sins\".</em></p>\n<p>This is too vague of a question to answer but as above \"ancestral sins\" would not be the only factor in why people suffered from starvation, enslavement, wars, diseases, and more</p>\n\n\n",

They got to Marah after 3 days (at which there were bitter waters) and complained as mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.15.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sh'mot 15:23</a>.

They leave Eilim (perek 16) and complain about food so the mon descends. By <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.17.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">17:1</a> they get to Rephidim and there is mention of a lack of water. Moshe is instructed to strike the rock and water comes from it.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.9a.9?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gemara</a> states that the people were accompanied by a well during their wanderings (\"He elaborates: The well was given to the Jewish people in the merit of Miriam;\") and Rashi connects it to the actual rock that Moshe <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/40704/was-the-rock-the-moshe-hit-in-shemos-17-the-beer-miriam\">struck</a>. This means that before the events at Rephidim, there was no water accompanying the people. They had no water unless they happened upon naturally occurring sources.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure why Miriam, specifically, is connected to water (though the description of bitter waters as מרים seems like a natural bridge) nor do I understand why, if it was in the merit of Miriam, Moshe had to strike the rock at all the first time, but my question is if it was in Miriam's merit, why did it start at this particular point and not earlier, when the people also needed it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Midrash explains that until that time, they had lived on water taken from amongst the rocks of the Yam Suf. Rabbeinu Bachaye quotes Rabbeinu Chananel who explains that though the Torah writes that the Jews walked in the desert for three days, they didn't actually go without water for three days, but rather they walked three day's journey in one day. (Similar to food, which they ran out on the 15th of Iyar, and the manna fell the next day.)</p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachaye further explains, (excerpt from Sefaria's translation):</p>\n<p>וילכו שלשת ימים במדבר, “they walked for three days through the desert.” I have already mentioned at the beginning of my commentary on this portion that every occurrence that took place in the desert was in the nature of a trial. There has never been a reported march of a nation numbering three million souls plus through the desert without their being supplied with a drop of water especially at a hot time of year. According to our sages (see our comment on 13,17) when the Israelites arrived at Marah the waters they found there had first been sweet, water fit to drink. These waters turned bitter, bracken, to intensify the trial they were undergoing. This is best reflected in the Torah itself writing “there He subjected them to a test” (verse 25). When Moses prayed and G-d showed him how to sweeten the water by throwing some bitter piece of wood into it, this was all part of the same trial. The very irrationality of bitter wood turning bitter water into sweet water was designed to underline that the whole experience was designed to test the Israelites’ dependence on G-d’s goodwill.</p>\n\n\n",

And of course, the common לעילוי נשמת of doing (or causing) a mitzvah in their merit - benefits them.\nHowever, in what way does *<em>simply stating their name</em> זכירה benefit <strong>the deceased</strong> themselves as it seems from the Rashi below and practice of some form of memorial (attaching their name to shul, sefer, etc)?</p>\n<p><strong>More detail:</strong>\nRashi in Megillah 3:9- explains that when Rus asked Boaz to marry her (it wasn't for the sake of yibum as Rashi holds (1:12) that she converted after Machlon died, and thus wasn't זקוק ליבום)  therefore he explains her request for marriage was as a package with the acquisition of his field so that \"שיזכר שם המת על נחלתו כשאבא אל השדה יאמרו זאת אשת מחלון\" (so that people will remember the name of the deceased (Machlon) - when I (Rus) come to the field they'll say this is the wife of Machlon.) see ציץ אליעזר חלק יז ס' מב</p>\n<p>Thus it seems that there is a <em><strong>benefit to the deceased themselves</strong></em> when their name is mentioned \"down here\" (or at least in connection with their field).\nMy question is how/why should it benefit them?  Being that this world is a \"corridor\" to עולם האמת, once they've gotten there, to what benefit could it be to them to have their name mentioned in עולם השקר?

The issue, though, is from a similar word we have in פרשת תולדות כז:לח. On the words הברכה אחת, which is a question, רש״י comments ה״א זו משמשת לשון תמיה, and brings three examples of words that are questions, but have a הַ rather than a הֲ.

That explains the why there is a דגש in the examples רש״י brings. However, according to that, the בי״ת in הברכה and the כ״ף in הכזונה should both have a דגש! In ספר צחות (also from ראב״ע), he says that there is no דגש in the בי״ת of הברכה so that there is no confusion that it might be a ה״א הידיעה. A similar idea is found in the גר״א's דקדוק ופירוש על התורה (also brought in ספר לשון חיים) that we can use a דגש after a ה״א התימה punctuated as הַ when there is no issue of confusion.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you could apply the same logic here that we don't want to risk confusion.

In that case, not only is there no question about who gets the next aliyah, but there needs to be no notification of it. Does each aliyah have to be announced in any form or can the reader just go from making the \"closing bracha\" for one aliyah right into making the \"opening bracha\" for his next aliyah? Is there some independent purpose or need for announcing the aliyah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.139.3?lang=he&with=Commentary&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 139:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אפילו ראש הכנסת או חזן לא יקרא עד שיאמרו לו קרא ונהגו ששליח צבור כשרוצה מברך וקורא בלי נטילת רשות משום דהוי כאלו משעה שמינוהו לש\"ץ הרשוהו על כך: הגה ובמדינות אלו אין נוהגין כן ואין החזן עולה רק כשהסגן אומר לו לעלות אבל אין קורין לו בשמו כמו שאר העולים שקוראים אותם בשמם פלוני בר פלוני.</p>\n<p>Even the president of the shul, or the chazan, shouldn't read from the Torah until they tell him to read. It is customary that the shliach tzibbur [i.e., baal korei] can say the berachos and read without being given permission, since it's as though he was implicitly given such permission when he was appointed.</p>\n<p>Rema: This is not the practice in these [Ashkenazic] countries: the chazan [baal korei] doesn't get an aliyah unless the segan [gabbai] tells him to. However, he's not called by name like other olim, who are called up by name, \"Ploni son of Ploni.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So yes, an oleh does need to be called up or given permission somehow, at least implicitly.</p>\n\n\n",

Translation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the beginning Alexander the Great reigned, who began his conquest campaign at the age of 19 in the year 3442. During this year, he subdued the Persian Darius, and in the year 3448 (1000 years exactly after the Exodus from Egypt) at the age of 25 he already ruled over 22 countries, and from this date belongs the beginning of the reign of Greece and Alexander. At the end of his life, he ruled over the entire world and at the age of 32 he was poisoned and died and his kingdom was split amongst his four ministers. The rule of Greece in the land of Israel was 180 years prior to the Temple, which means 34 years until the Second Temple.</p>\n<p>The Greeks were the heirs of Alexander, they continued the dominion in Israel and ruled there for a total of 180 years, when at the end, the evil Antiochus Epiphanes ruled that many side with Israel. And during his days there were terrible and the most difficult being the \"Write for yourselves on the horn of an ox\" <strong>that lasted 52 years</strong>. After this, they were driven out by the Chashmonaim/Hasmoneans that were the five sons of Matisyahu the Cohen, and they were: Yehuda, Yonasan, Yochanan, Shimon and Elazar - they were mighty (and all kings except for Elazar who was killed on the battlefield), who inflicted on the Greeks a great defeat with the miraculous help of the Creator may He be blessed. After this, the Chashmonaim took the reins of power in Israel for 103 years.</p>\n<p><strong>The miracle of Chanukah took place in the year 3622</strong>. From this year, until the year 3648, in a period of 26 years no nation ruled Israel, but the Maccabean wars with the Greeks continued. After this time, the Romans began to gradually take over the country, this gradual takeover lasted 180 years, until the destruction of the Temple by them and the conquest of the country.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to this, Antiochus was in power for a period of 52 years in which his decrees against the Jews were in place, and only at the end of this period did the Chashmonaim apparently take action. What's more is that although the Maccabim would eventually take power, the Greeks weren't completely toppled and wars continued to rage between them for many years afterwards.</p>\n\n\n",

In the absence of the Beis Hamikdash what function would they have?

The halacha is that a single extra or missing letter makes tefillin or mezuzah (or Sefer Torah) posul. Why are people assumed to be expert in that?  Is it (a) They used to actually pronounce the words slightly differently depending, so someone from that time would know the exact spelling. Or (b) At least there are a lot fewer things to remember, just a few possible places where there might be an extra vav/yod or not (טוטפות vs טטפת, etc.) and we can rely on memory for those?

It is therefore\nstated (in Eccl. 5:1), “Do not be rash with your mouth…. for God is in\nheaven and you are on earth.” For who would say that God is not in\nheaven and that people are not on earth? [Accordingly], Solomon has\nsaid, “Every time that the weakest of the weak is above, he defeats\nthe warrior below.” Go and learn from Abimelech (in Jud. 9:53), “But a\ncertain woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech's head and\ncracked his skull.”41<em>Since the woman was above the warrior Abimelech\nin the tower of Thebez, her killing him is an example of a relatively\nweak person defeating a warrior from above.</em> And if he was a warrior\namong warriors and there was none like him, and [yet] a woman [was\nable to] kill him from above, how much the more so in the case of the\nHoly One, blessed be He!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Admittedly, I'm not sure why the connection is made between God in heaven and the weaker power's being above -- it seems to be a kal vachomer. If the weak can win from above, all the more so, God wins as he is above. But God is able to win wherever he is, so I don;t see why \"being above\" matters.</p>\n\n\n",

That context is Mi Yodeya, a Judaism Web site, so you must mean biblical researchers within the framework of Judaism, so the answer is No.</p>\n<p>More specifically, in my years of studying biblical research written by Judaism scholars from various countries, cultures, schools of thought, and generations, I've <em>never</em> come across this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are plenty of counterexamples to this theory. The very first place where the root נבא is used in Tanach is when G-d tells the Philistine king Avimelech, \"Now, return this man's wife, for he is a נביא\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.20.7?lang=he&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 20:7</a>). Neither \"philosopher\" nor \"entertainer\" nor \"dramatizer\" fits in that context at all; it means \"prophet.\" (Rashi there makes the point still more forcefully: as a prophet, Avraham knows that in fact you didn't molest her.)</p>\n<p>Another example is the dialogue (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Amos.7.12?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amos 7:12-15</a>) between Amatziah the priest of Bethel, and Amos:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֲמַצְיָה֙ אֶל־עָמ֔וֹס חֹזֶ֕ה לֵ֥ךְ בְּרַח־לְךָ֖ אֶל־אֶ֣רֶץ יְהוּדָ֑ה וֶאֱכָל־שָׁ֣ם לֶ֔חֶם וְשָׁ֖ם תִּנָּבֵֽא׃\nוּבֵֽית־אֵ֔ל לֹֽא־תוֹסִ֥יף ע֖וֹד לְהִנָּבֵ֑א כִּ֤י מִקְדַּשׁ־מֶ֙לֶךְ֙ ה֔וּא וּבֵ֥ית מַמְלָכָ֖ה הֽוּא׃\nוַיַּ֤עַן עָמוֹס֙ וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֶל־אֲמַצְיָ֔ה לֹא־נָבִ֣יא אָנֹ֔כִי וְלֹ֥א בֶן־נָבִ֖יא אָנֹ֑כִי כִּֽי־בוֹקֵ֥ר אָנֹ֖כִי וּבוֹלֵ֥ס שִׁקְמִֽים׃\nוַיִּקָּחֵ֣נִי יְהוָ֔ה מֵאַחֲרֵ֖י הַצֹּ֑אן וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֵלַי֙ יְהוָ֔ה לֵ֥ךְ הִנָּבֵ֖א אֶל־עַמִּ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃</p>\n<p>Amaziah also said to Amos, “Seer, off with you to the land of Judah! Earn your living there, and do your prophesying there. But don’t ever prophesy again at Bethel; for it is a king’s sanctuary and a royal palace.” Amos answered Amaziah: “I am not a prophet, and I am not a prophet’s disciple. I am a cattle breeder and a tender of sycamore figs. But the LORD took me away from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to My people Israel.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, as several of the commentaries there explain, Amatziah claims that Amos is exactly what your \"some scholars\" believe - someone who prophesies in order to earn a living. Whereas Amos counters that he's in no need of that, being independently wealthy (see Targum Yonasan on v. 14, cited in Rashi ad loc) - but is a נביא only because G-d sent him to do so. Not a \"philosopher,\" an \"entertainer\" or a \"dramatizer,\" but someone sent by G-d with a message to the people.</p>\n<p>(To an extent, perhaps, your source is correct on one point: a נביא doesn't necessarily have to be foretelling the future. As the Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.7.7?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hil. Yesodei Hatorah 7:7</a>) writes, a נביא may be given a message meant for him alone, to grant him a greater understanding of G-dliness.)</p>\n\n\n",

In order that all the Israelites might be involved, throughout the year, in giving their contributions. Why did they begin to accumulate their contributions on the first day of Adar,2 though they did not bring it in until the first day of Nisan?

    "title": "Praying to angels",
    "content": "# Praying to angels\n\n## Frage\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara[1] records how a certain sage would address a sick person\nduring the week:</p>\n<p>Rabbah bar bar Chanah said: When we would go with R' Elazar to visit a\nsick person, we noticed that sometimes he said, \"May G-d remember you\nfor peace\" in Hebrew, and sometimes he said, \"May the Merciful One\nremember you for peace\" in Aramaic.[2]</p>\n<p>The Gemara asks: How could he have done this? That is, how could R'\nElazar have prayed in Aramaic? But Rav Yehudah has said: A person\nshould never request his needs in Aramaic, the ministering angels do\nnot pay attention to him, because the ministering angels do not know\nAramaic. The Gemara explains how R' Elazar could pray in Aramaic: A\nsick person is different because the Divine Presence is with him. As\nRav Anan said in the name of Rav: From where is it stated: Hashem will\nsupport him on the sick bed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Yochanan felt that the angels do not understand Aramaic, only Hebrew (Levush, Orach Chaim 101:7, and see Eliyahu Rabbah ibid). Yet other commentators differed. Some felt that angels understood all languages but only pay attention to the ones said in Hebrew (see Tosafos, Eliyahu Rabbah ibid). This issue aside, how do we reconcile this with Rambam?</p>\n<p>In his fifth Principle of Faith (which every Jew must accept literally), Rambam writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is the Blessed One Whom it is proper to worship, to exalt, to\npropagate His greatness, and to fulfill His commandments. But one must\nnot do so for anything of lower existence than G-d Himself], such as\nthe angels, the stars, the spheres, the elements and whatever is\ncomposed of them . . . It is likewise improper to pray that they act\nas intercessors to present [our prayers] to Him. Only to Him shall\none's thoughts be directed; and all besides Him should be ignored . .\n.\" (Commentary of Mishnah, Sanhedrin ch. 10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramban agreed. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Simialry], \"The third form of idolatry is considering the angels\ncapable of serving as intermediaries between G-d and His worshipers .\n. . Realize that even to pray to them for this purpose is forbidden to\nus .. .\" (Toras HaShem Temimah).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These Rishonim explained this Gemara to mean that prayers to them are ineffectual. Meiri explains that this Gemara is not literal. It is the poetic style. Yet others feel that when the sick pray only G-d can answer (Rashi).</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do we reconcile this Gemara with the Rishonim?</p>\n<p>[1] Talmud Bavli 12b 1</p>\n<p>[2] Disregarding, for the moment, the issue of whether it is permitted to pray in any language other than Hebrew</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The non-canonical book of Tobit (Tuvia), which seems to have been written 100 BCE, around 300 years before Rabbi Yochanan, was found in the caves at Qumran, and was included in the Septuagint (so it is of the sefarim chitzonim), may shed light on this in a manner that there is no contradiction. Since it was authored by a Jewish person, it might show us a prevalent Jewish belief about the role of angels as it relates to prayer.</p>\n<p>One of the main characters in Tobit is the angel of healing, Refael. In <a href=\"https://bible.usccb.org/bible/tobit/12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tobit 12:12</a>, the angel says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now when you, Tobit, and Sarah prayed, it was I who presented the record of your prayer before the Glory of the Lord; and likewise whenever you used to bury the dead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These prayers addressed God, not the angel Refael. Thus, in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tobit%208&version=GNT\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tobit 8:4-8</a>, Tobit and his wife pray:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Tobias and Sarah were alone behind closed doors, Tobias got up from the bed and said to his wife, Get up, dear. Let's pray for the Lord to be merciful and to protect us. 5 Sarah got up so that they could pray together and ask God for his protection. Then Tobias prayed: God of our ancestors, you are worthy of praise. May your name be honored forever and ever by all your creatures in heaven and on earth. You created Adam and gave him his wife Eve to be his helper and support. They became the parents of the whole human race.  You said,    It is not good for man to live alone. I will make a suitable helper for him. Lord, I have chosen Sarah because it is right, not because I lusted for her. Please be merciful to us and grant that we may grow old together. Then they both said Amen and went to bed for the night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yochanan, in Shabbat 12b, could similarly view angels as mere postmen, who deliver prayers to God, where those prayers were addressed to God. He is saying that if the prayer is in Aramaic, then the postman angel will not understand and cannot deliver the prayer. This is no contradiction with the Rambam, who says that you can only pray to God.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Everyone,  including the Gemorah referenced, agrees that one may not pray  to Malachim.  Rashi explains the Gemorah as meaning that the Melochim help bring the prayers to Hashem. It is an old question in Halacha about what exactly they help with.</p>\n<p>Some of the Achronim  did not say any of the Selichos  like \"Machnesey Rachmim\" because they imply tefila is being said to Malachim or that they have independent power to help  us with our tefilos. Most of us do say them because of our understanding of the function  Melochim have with our tefilos.</p>\n<p>The Gemora Sanhedrin 44B says in the name of Rav Yochanan  לעולם יבקש אדם רחמים שיהו הכל מאמצין את כחו ואל יהו לו צרים מלמעלה</p>\n<p><em>A person should always pray for mercy that all (heavenly beings) should strengthen his power of prayer, and that he should have no enemies (causing him trouble) in Heaven above.</em></p>\n<p>Rashi explains it as meaning that the Melochim should help him with his prayers and not prosecute against him to Hashem.</p>\n<p>There are  posukim  in Iyov (33:23-24) which talk about malachim advocating to Hashem for people.There are also Midrashim which speak about Melochim helping tefilos get accepted .  The Midrashim themselves are  clear that the Melochim only have to  ability to daven and advocate on your behalf but have no power to make any decisions of their own. Similar to asking any guy off the street to pray for you. Only the melochim are in closer proximity to Hashem.</p>\n<p>Tefilos are not  said in Aramaic so that  the Melochim should  be able understand it and  give their help with it getting accepted. Not because we are davening to them in any way ch'v</p>\n\n\n",

For example the Chasam Sofer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/4422/22152\">here</a> is noted to have been upset at the practise of using the dreidel in this way. Yet, the Chavos Yair 126, as mentioned <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/60644/22152\">here</a> writes that the rabbis in his town enacted a policy to ban playing cards, except on Chanukah.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I saw on <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Minhagim_of_Chanukah#cite_note-16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachapedia</a> (footnote 16) that the Piskei Teshuvos (670:4 n. 25) quotes the Shefa Chaim OC 2:283 who says that there is no issue of gambling because just like a father and son may gamble since they don’t care who wins or loses, on Chanukah everyone is like one family.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Rav Yisrael of Ruzhin is cited as encouraging his followers to play dreidel (in a gambling fashion) on the last day of Chanukah, “for what one gains on Zos Chanukah is not easily lost” (refer to Ner Yisrael 5747, p. 18).</p>\n<p>So my question is, if we don't normally encourage gambling, how then did such a custom emerge on Chanukah?

That is not answered. The reason it's not answered is that even if they are not absolutely obligated in keeping an oath, it's obviously very immoral not to. The Rambam actually implies [Melachim, 10, 10. (That's in Shoftim which is in his Mishneh Torah)] that it is praiseworthy for a gentile to keep as many of the mitzvos as he can. (Besides for a few which he may not - Shabbos, maybe learning most parts of Torah.)</p>\n<p>The Talmud Yerushalmi in Nazir 9;1 brings a dispute if Gentiles can annul vows.

    "content": "# Why weren't Tzaddok and Baytos put to death?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why weren't Tzaddok and Baytos, fathers of the Tz'ddokim and Baytosim, put to death as z'kenim mamrim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>By way of getting a clearer understanding of the parameters of a zakein mamre one should refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/English_Explanation_of_Mishnah_Sanhedrin.11.3.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Sanhedrin 11:3</a> which writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>There is greater stringency in respect to the teachings of the scribes than in respect to the torah: [thus,] if a zakein mamre [rebellious elder] says, there is no commandment of tefillin, so that a biblical law may be transgressed, he is exempt. [But if he rules that the tefillin must contain] five compartments, thus adding to the words of the scribes, he is liable.</strong> This mishnah states that a rebellious elder who teaches against a Rabbinic teaching, one not mentioned explicitly in the Torah, is dealt with more severely than one who teaches against the explicit words of the Torah. An elder who states that there is no commandment of tefillin is not to be executed, since the commandment of tefillin is stated explicitly in the Torah (Exodus 13:9, 16, Deuteronomy 6:8, 11:18). Anyone who hears this elder teach that there is no tefillin will be able to check the Torah and realize that the elder’s teaching is false. However, one who states that the tefillin must be made of five boxes, instead of the four prescribed by the Rabbis, is liable for the death penalty. Since the Torah does not state how many boxes are to be in the tefillin, this is a teaching that if we didn’t know from the Rabbis we would not know at all. Therefore, an elder who teaches against this teaching is more of a threat than the elder who teaches against something stated specifically in the Torah. Note: The tefillin worn on one’s head contain four boxes but the one worn on the arm contains only one box. From the outside each is painted black and therefore looks like one box. (sefaria translation and notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_on_Mishnah_Sanhedrin.11.3.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> on the Mishna explains this as follows and brings the case of Tzadok and Baytos. (Feel free to help with the translation, I'm not sure I did it proper justice):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>There is greater stringency in respect to the teachings of the scribes than in respect to the Torah:</strong> They said one is exempt when he admitted being chayav (i.e. liable), but he would cancel/annul them in its teaching like it says, to transgress the words of Torah until he admitted that it was a transgression. <strong>And therefore he does not have to die in a court of law since he is not put to death for annulling a מצות עשה (positive mitzvah), but if he said there is no tefillin in the way of heresy, he will be killed on the part that he is a heretic not on the side that he is zaken mamre</strong>. And know this matter well, since one who cause doubt amongst the many about the sages - this is what the Talmud classes as a zakein mamre, and they are not chayav until he will say like this, or do like this or make a condition like this. And when they do not complete the condition thereby saving themselves, this is not the case, but can be explained as meaning that <strong>he is not obligated as a zakein mamre but rather he is exempt from the judgement of zakein mamre, however he must die because others will think about his differing views and beliefs.</strong> Alternatively, he is undoubtedly denying that which is written in the Torah; \"Hashem our G-d, Hashem is One\", which mean that such a person is not killed or that he is regarded as a zakein mamre, and is definitely killed because he is an exception to the rule. <strong>This means, from all of Israel, of which there will be sinners, he is one of the sinners, namely a zakein mamre. And accordingly, there is no zakein mamre who destroys the wall of the Torah and does not deny its acceptance in every facet such as Tzaddok and Baytos. Such a man sees his words as being greater than Beis Din and therefore he is worthy of death for not showing (the proper) respect to Beis Din. This draws parallels with the case of a person who curses his father and mother, who (likewise) we put to death for not showing the (proper) respect to his father and mother. Therefore, a zakein mamre according to a court who wanted a court to forgive him may forgive him, but this is not true for the reason that we mentioned i.e. not to increase arguments amongst klal yisroel but Saducess and Baytosim that deny this acceptance in every facet and doubt that which is written in the Torah and their thinking is not from this group but from the group that say there is no Torah from heaven</strong> like we explained in Chapter 10 of this tractate. When they deny the fundamentals/foundations of Torah, <strong>they are put to death due to their heresy like we put to death one who denies G-d, or one who denies (the existence of) Moshe Rabbeinu</strong>. Since all those who destroy the foundation from these foundations that I said to you leaves the category of a 'baal Torah' (i.e. owner of Torah). However, I have already been at length with this matter and all who uproot this belief no-one should be provoked by them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if I have understood this Rambam correctly, Tzaddok and Baytos were not deserving of death due to zekeinim mamrim but rather purely for acting out of kefirah.</p>\n<p>In addition, we see from the Rambam that it only becomes an issue if people 'complete' the act of heresy i.e. translating their warped logic into action.

Instead, he is one of the heretics and he should be put to death by any person.</p>\n<p>Since it has become known that such a person denies the Oral Law, he may be pushed into a pit and may not be helped out. He is like all the rest of the heretics who say that the Torah is not Divine in origin, those who inform on their fellow Jews, and the apostates. All of these are not considered as members of the Jewish people. There is no need for witnesses, a warning, or judges for them to be executed. Instead, whoever kills them performs a great mitzvah and removes an obstacle from people at large.</p>\n<p>To whom does the above apply? To a person who denied the Oral Law consciously, according to his perception of things.

Even if later, he hears that he is Jewish and saw Jews and their faith, he is still considered as one who was compelled against observance, for he was raised according to their mistaken path. This applies to those who we mentioned who follow the erroneous Karaite path of their ancestors. Therefore it is appropriate to motivate them to repent and draw them to the power of the Torah with words of peace.</p>\n<p>The \"rebellious elder\" mentioned in the Torah, by contrast, is one of the sages of Israel who has received the tradition from previous sages and who analyzes and issues ruling with regard to the words of Torah as do all the sages of Israel. His rebellion involves an instance when he has a difference of opinion in one of the Torah's laws with the Supreme Sanhedrin and did not accept their views, but instead issued a ruling to act in a different manner. The Torah decreed that he should be executed. He should confess his sin before being executed so that he will be granted a portion in the world to come.</p>\n<p>Even though he analyzes and they analyze; he received the tradition and they received the tradition, the Torah granted them deference.

Judaism rejects entirely the idea that a human sacrifice should occur at all. Our worst enemies practiced human sacrifice. Our rejection of that is part of what separated us from other nations at the time. Hashem separated himself by rejecting a human sacrifice (Isaac) and requested a ram sacrifice instead. That entire narrative relates to how human blood for sin is not how Hashem operates. When you add Jesus into the equation (a being they claimed was God in flesh) and then state God sacrificed a person (who was himself at the time) for sin forgiveness, it contradicts everything we established in Torah. Why would Hashem break his own standard? That makes no sense.</li>\n<li><strong>Their nature of sin itself is different.</strong> Judaism establishes that we each carry our own sins. We are not responsible for the sins of our families or ancestors unless we carry on their mistakes and continue them. Outside of that, we all have our own moral bank account. Christianity changed that relationship with the concept of <strong>Original Sin</strong>. They state that we all carry the universal burden of the sin Eve made when she disobeyed God <em>(the original sin)</em>. While it's true her actions fundamentally changed the nature of humanity (and made us as we are) the fact is Judaism rejects the idea that Hashem has added a sin debt to every human by default because of her actions. Our sins are our own and her sins were hers. We don't all start off in the negative because of her actions. Hashem is just and such a standard would be the opposite of justice.</li>\n<li><strong>Their fundamental belief in Christianity is that you <em>need</em> Jesus for heaven.</strong> That statement is the \"no, no\" to end all \"no, nos\". Jesus fundamentally changed the system by stating that no one can get to the father except through him. That statement is a gross violation of everything established beforehand and it created a situation where a middle-man positioned himself in a such a way where you needed him piggybacking onto your teshuvah process if you wanted full forgiveness. Nothing about that has anything to do with Judaism. It's a perversion of it to build something new around one man.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How about being a Noahide and rejecting Christianity as a doctrine,\nbut taking part in Christian religious activities such as sermons,\nbaptisms, etc?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What if I cheat on my spouse physically but I promise to never do so emotionally? That's still being faithful, right? <em>(sarcasm)</em></p>\n<p>The relationship between God and his people is described like a marriage. You're faithful to God in the same way you are faithful to your spouse. When you commit to your spouse, you remove yourself from temptations or inappropriate relationships which border on unfaithfulness.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don't have secret friends.</li>\n<li>You don't get physical with other men/women.</li>\n<li>You don't speak flirtatiously with someone as you would your spouse.</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are lines drawn to establish that respect.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a Jew or whether you are a Noahide, if you are still participating in religious activities developed by Christian tradition, you're cheating on Hashem. You're giving an aspect of your divine life to someone else and pretending you're not being unfaithful because your \"heart is in the right place\" while doing it.</p>\n<p>That's not how it works. When you take on foreign worship practices, you are cheating on Hashem.</p>\n<p>There's a reason we no longer pray on our knees <em>(except Karaite Jews)</em> - It's because we actively wanted to separate ourselves from other faith practices we may unintentionally emulate. Risking that means risking cheating on Hashem and breaking our covenant as a nation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Maimonides did not like Christianity because he felt, and I agree with him, that the idea that there are three gods was philosophically impossible. He considered it idolatry.[1] One of the Seven Noahide Commandments prohibits idolatry.[2] Yet others felt that Christianity wasn't necessary avodah zarah, idolatry. I think gentiles can celebrate and enjoy holidays like Christmas.

If Jacob felt that Esau was undeserving of the blessing, he would not have given it to him. Also, a Midrash makes use of the story when Isaac and Ishmael bury Abraham. The Midrash says that Ishmael performed teshuvah, repentance. (Gen. Rabbah 30:4, 38:12, BT Bava Batra 16b).

Not all of the inscription survived, but this is what was discernable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[mishma]r Harevi'i (the Fourth)</li>\n<li>[Malkiyah] Beit Lechem mishmar Hachamishi (the Fifth)</li>\n<li>Miyamin Yodfat mishmar Hashishi (the Sixth)</li>\n<li>Hakotz Ailav'o mishmar Hashvi'i (the Seventh)</li>\n<li>Aviyah Ido K'far Uziel mishmar</li>\n<li>Hashmini (the Eighth) Yeshua Nisrafarbel</li>\n<li>mishmar Hatshi'i (the Ninth)</li>\n<li>Sh'chanyah a[..]rah K'vul mishmar Ha['a'siri] (the Tenth)</li>\n<li>Elyashiv Kohen Kaneh mishmar Achad A[sar] (the Eleventh)</li>\n<li>Yakim Pashchur Tzefat mishmar Shneim A[sar] (the Twelfth)</li>\n<li>[Chu]pah Beit Me'on mishmar Shloshah</li>\n<li>[Asa]r (the Thirteenth, continues from previous line) Yeshv'av Chutzpit Shuchin</li>\n<li>mishmar Arba'ah Asar (the Fourteenth)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It seems that whoever made this list also had some tradition of the list of mishmarot kehunah.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that in the 70's the column featuring the list was found placed upside-down in the local mosque, with the top part having sunk into the floor of the building. The column was used as a decoration and for this reason, researchers were not allowed to pull it out. Aviva Klein-Franke noted in her essay על משמרות הכוהנים, המסורת ויהודי תימן, p. 333 concluded based on the fact that the visible bottom part was not the end of the list, that there was at least one other matching column with the rest of the list.

The manuscript itself is from the 14th century but the list is thought to reflect the reality of the late Byzantine-early Muslim period (circa 6th-7th centuries). One of the shuls is called \"כנסת בלגה במעריה\" (Knesset Bilgah in Ma'ariyah), Bilgah being one of the mishmarot and Ma'ariyah being the Galilean town they had moved to after the destruction.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> A possible explanation for this title is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Seder_Olam_Zutta.9.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam Zutta ch. 9</a> where it is stated that in Giv'at Arbel there was a kohen named Yehoshua ben Saraf or Nisraf and in his estate the Reish Galuta Chizkiyah I was buried (see list of exilarchs <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exilarch#Biblical_exilarchs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). The name Saraf/Nisraf (depending on the manuscript) might have been a family name of a prominent family of the mishmar who came from Arbel, and Yehoshua himself was likely named after the namesake of the mishmar.</p>\n\n\n",

What does a bride have to do with perfection?</p>\n<p><sup>cf. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/118806/12915\">Hebrew words for “sister” & “bride” interchangeable? “sister” can mean “friend”?</a></sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>כּלל also means the group or the all, as in the word כּל - all.</p>\n<p>The bride is the perfect crystalline form of society, she is the paradigm and paragon of the all.</p>\n<p>Hence when Hashem brought Chavah to Adam, he adorned her with the 24 adornments (jewels) of a bride (Zohar 1, 48b). But additionally we learn that (Maseches Sofrim 15.5)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"מה כלה מקושטת בכ\"ד קישוטין, אף תלמיד חכם צריך להיות בקי בכל כ\"ד ספרי\nתנ\"ך.</p>\n<p>Just as a bride is adorned with 24 adornments, so too must a <em>talmid\nchacham</em> be adorned with the 24 books of the scriptures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So that the beauty of the <em>talmid chacham</em> is derived from the example of the perfect beauty of the bride, because the bride is the perfect form.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Building on my comment above the understanding is that prior to the creation of his wife, Adam was judged as being incomplete, both figuratively and physically.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.18?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 2:18</a> the Torah states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The LORD G-d said, “It is not good for man to be alone; I will make a (lit. a helper against him) fitting helper for him.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.18?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Ramban_on_Genesis.2.18.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> (Nachmanadies) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It does not seem that man was created to be the only one in the world and will not give birth to all the creatures male and female, of all flesh were created to establish a seed and also the grass and the tree sowed in them, but it is possible to say that was as the saying goes (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.61a.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 61a</a>) \"two faces [du partzufin]\" were created, they were made to have a nature bringing in the reproductive organs from the male to the female, a strength to give birth....and this second face helps the first in producing children, and G-d saw that it was good as this 'helper' stands before him and he will see and part with him and connect with him as he pleases. And this is what is meant by \"I will make him a helper against him\" and this is the reason why (G-d upon seeing that Adam was alone) said it was \"not good\" (and) not to say about him that it is good to be alone, since <strong>the act of creation had not yet been fulfilled - this \"good\" was the fulfilment</strong> like I explained with my piece on \"And G-d saw that it was good\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Genesis.1.4.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:4</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem through the creation of Chava/Eve, the first wife; this helped to perfect the creation, it finalised the act and now warranted the appellation of being \"good\".</p>\n<p>This idea is reinforced a few verses later in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.24?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:24</a> where the Torah writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hence a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, so that they become one flesh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.24?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.2.24.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> clarifies \"one flesh\" to mean:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The child is formed through both of them, (and their coming together) makes them into one flesh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.24?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Ramban_on_Genesis.2.24.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> brings this Rashi and adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In my view animals do not cleave to their sexual partners; the male approaches any female it finds and then leaves. For this reason the text says since the female of the adam was a bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh, he cleaved to her and she was in his bosom like his own flesh and he desired her to be constantly with him. <strong>As this was so with Adam so was his nature transmitted to his progeny, to make the males, cleaving to their females, leaving their fathers and mothers and regarding their wives as if they were one flesh with them.</strong> Similarly, “you are our brother, our flesh (gen.37:27), “to the meat of ones flesh (Lev.18:6), those close in family are called “meat of flesh” and so will leave the “meat” of his father and his mother and their closeness and see that his wife is closer to him than they are. (sefaria translation - not all the Hebrew is there)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>So to return to your question, how is a bride also tied with perfection? The answer is that through her union with her husband they now represent a complete creation. In the same way it was not good for man to be alone, and G-d provided a wife for Adam, so too for all spouses, the act of marriage allows them to now become one complete entity.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In addition, building on the Gemara Brachos that was cited in the first Ramban, Adam was initially created both male and female in one body. G-d then split this female part from Adam to create Chava. Thus when a husband and wife get married, through their act of intimacy, they reconnect once more to the primordial creation of mankind by becoming one again, and thus, now represents a sense of perfection.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Did the Rabbis err when they stipulated an eight branch menorah for the celebration of Hanukkah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I fully understand the rationale for an eight branched menorah. Considering the Nes, etc. And I am aware that the Talmud states that it is prohibited to use a seven-lamp menorah outside of the Temple. The Hanukkah menorah therefore has eight main branches. I get that.<br />\nBut the seven-branched menorah was one of the most prized and central objects of the Bais HaMikdash. You ask a Jewish kid to draw a menorah and I am fully confident that most will NOT draw one with seven branches. (This may not be the case with Israeli kids being that their State Seal has a seven-branched candelabrum) I feel we lost something significant in that what has commonly passed down to the generations in terms of memory of a central ritual object has become confused.  When I think of this it is troubling. A menorah to them means one with eight branches and a shamas.<br />\nI know it is a bit chutzpah-dic to state that the Mishnaic Rabbis possibly made an error here in stipulating an eight branch menorah for the chag.  I understand that there might have been messianic overtones to the choice of eight - but still!\nBut it does seem to me to be really problematic with regard to the sacredness of the seven-branched menorah.  I am not trying to be disrespectful. I am just shocked. Everything that I have read regarding the bais hamikdash in the oral Torah seems to completely honor and respect the sacredness of the objects used in the Bais HaMikdosh. Can someone please help me with this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It's never chutzpah to ask on a Rabbinic idea, it's only a problem when we disrespect them.</p>\n<p>The menorah of the Temple did not have a Shammas higher in the middle, nor must ours.</p>\n<p>We just need 8 wicks, can have 8 cups or ancient lamps, just 8 fires burning, 1 until 8 to remember the miracle.</p>\n<p>Even if one wants to use the  Candelabra shape from our Temple, there wasn't a worry that Jews would forget Menorah of the Temple.</p>\n<p>In fact, it can be seen almost as an extension:\nmaking the menorah of the Temple +1 the miracle = 8</p>\n<p>What did you mean by Messianic?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Firstly, as Rabbi Y.

Since it's \"<em>mitzvaso bekach</em>\", it's not the same as a regular <em>aseh docheh lo sa'aseh</em>, like <em>bris milah</em> on a <em>tzara'as</em> blemish.

Therefore, <em>aseh docheh lo sa'aseh</em> has no relevance by the Sotah, since in her case there's no prohibition.

She brought the food to them, and Rabbi Yehuda tasted it, without concern for his honor. He said: <strong>This is an a fortiori inference: And what can be seen, that in order to make peace between a man and his wife, the Torah said: My name, that is written in sanctity, shall be blotted out in the waters that curse, as the words written on a scroll, including the name of God, were blotted out during the ceremony of preparing the water that a sota would drink.

It relates the story about a disgruntled husband and his interaction with his wife. This wife went to hear a shiur from Rabbi Meir every erev Shabbos. On one occasion the shiur lasted much longer than normal and she returned home to find that the lamps in her home had burned out. Her husband angrily asked where she had been, and in his rage said he wouldn't allow to enter the house until she spat in Rabbi Meir's eye. Rabbi Meir heard about the situation through ruach hakodesh and pretended to have a medical problem with his eye. He promptly announced that anyone who knew of a special prayer to whisper over the eye should come forth. Her neighbours advised her that this was her opportunity - she should whisper something and then spit in his eye quickly afterwards. When he approached her and he asked if she had a cure, she couldn't bring herself to do it out of kavod for the revered sage. He responded that she should spit in his eye seven times. Upon her doing so, he told her that her husband said she spit in his eye once, but she did so seven times! His students saw this as a real affront to their Rebbi and were horrified. However, the Yerushalmi concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר לון ולא יהא כבוד מאיר ככבוד קונו. ומה אם שם הקודש שנכתב בקדושה אמר הכתוב שיימחה על המים בשביל להטיל שלום בין איש לאשתו. וכבוד מאיר לא כל שכן</p>\n<p>He said to them, should Meir's honour be like the honour of his Creator? If the Holy Name which is written in holiness should be erased in the waters [i.e. in the case of sotah] in order to restore peace between a husband and his wife, how much more Meir’s honour?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, such is Hashem's love for matrimonial harmony, He will seemingly forgo His honour to ensure that this is done.</p>\n<p>As the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Davar_on_Numbers.5.19.2?ven=Yalkut,_Sifsei_Chachomim_Chumash,_Metsudah_Publications,_2009&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netziv</a> perhaps best encapsulates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You shall be absolved. <strong>The Kohein advises her to drink to absolve herself, and not be concerned about the erasing of Hashem’s name, for this is His will and His honor</strong>....(Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There are many minyanim that I've been to that daven at 6:50 or earlier throughout the year, all but guaranteeing that shemoneh esrei is being davened before neitz.</p>\n<p>What are the heterim for this? When the sole reason to do so is because that's the time the minyan happens thoughout the year, what are the reasons why this is muttar and that minyanim do not push off davening to hit neitz (even when it's just a minute or two off)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x457\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch O.C. 89:8</a> we find the following codification:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בשעת הדחק כגון שצריך להשכים לדרך יכול להתפלל משעלה עמוד השחר</p>\n<p>Under pressing circumstances, e.g. that he needs to rise early for the road, one can pray from dawn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Synagogues with early prayer services may be assuming that for for those who need to go to work it is considered a pressing circumstance.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It seems to me that you are asking two different questions.\nFor the first, it is far from clear that davening before neitz is any problem compared to davening later - which I think you're assuming. The Shulchan Aruch uses a language of \"b'diavad\", but Igros Moshe (OH 4:6) and R' Isser Zalman (Even Ha'azel on the Rambam on Krias Shema, if I remember right) suggest that that means, compared to davening <em>exactly</em> at neitz or immediately just after. In their opinion, davening before neitz is no different from davening after neitz. I think the language of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.89.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur (89)</a> is especially clear:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זמן תפלת השחר מתחיל משעלה עמוד השחר והאיר פני המזרח שהיא כנגד תמיד השחר ומאותה שעה ואילך הוא זמנה ומ\"מ עיקר מצותה עם הנץ החמה אלא שאם התפלל משעלה עמוד השחר יצא ונמשך עד סוף ד' שעות<br />\nThe time of Shacharis begins with dawn and the brightening east, as [the prayer] corresponds to the Tamid of the morning. From then onward is its time - but the <em>main</em> mitzvah is [to pray] as the sun rises. But if he prayed from dawn he has fulfilled his obligation, and that continues until the end of the fourth hour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I see that the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.89.1?lang=bi&with=Mishnah%20Berurah&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah (89:1)</a> and others do agree with your assumption.<br />\nSee the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kaf_HaChayim_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.89.3.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kaf Hachaim 89(3)</a> who brings the פר\"ח who learns the Shulchan Aruch the way I was describing, and who also does not seem to see any difference between before neitz and after it.<br />\nLater in that section, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.89.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch (89:8)</a> talks about davening before משיכיר, before one can distinguish. That is a still earlier time and not advised because it interferes with other parts of davening or putting on tefillin.</p>\n<p>For the second question, why not move it a few minutes to neitz? Some minyanim indeed do that. But when they asked R' Feivel Cohen shlit\"a (the בדי השולחן), the Rav of the shul where I used to daven, he brushed off the idea: Some people daven neitz (the special people called vatikin, which Rashi describes as [Berachos 9b] \"humble men who love mitzvos\"), and they do it all year-round. The rest don't.<br />\nI don't know if other rabbanim agree with that idea or have some other reason. It certainly seems to be the minhag. My current synagogue has hundreds of members and only one Shacharis minyan: early, same time every morning.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is forgetting it's Shabbos considered shogeg rather than misasek?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Pretty much just that.</p>\n<p>(If a person is <em>misasek</em> when doing an <em>aveira</em>, he is not liable for anything. If, however, he is shogeg, then he often has to bring a korbon. ‘<em>Misasek</em>’ is not a lack of awareness about the <em>halacha</em>, but rather means when a person makes a mistake about the situational factors surrounding his act, those factors in fact causing the act to be one which is forbidden. Thus, as a result, the person does something forbidden without realising that it was forbidden. <em>Shogeg</em> means when someone forgets or does not know that the action he's doing is in fact forbidden - but he is fully aware of the situational factors; he knows exactly what he is doing, he just isn’t aware it’s wrong.)</p>\n<p>When a person forgets it’s Shabbos, isn’t that a lack of <strong>situational</strong> awareness? We’re not talking about a case where the person knows its Saturday but forgot that on Saturday one cannot do any melocho – that would indeed be a lack of <em><strong>halachic</strong></em> awareness, but it is not (from memory) the standard case of ‘<em>helem shabbos</em>’. Rather, the standard case is that one forgot that the day was Shabbos – he thought it was a weekday. (Friday, Sunday, whatever.) So, this seems to me to be precisely a case of <em>misasek</em>! How can this be considered <em>shogeg</em>? I know at other times in the seventh perek of Shabbos and maybe elsewhere, the terms are used interchangably – but this is not semantics here; this is a question of <em>halacha</em>. How can one have to bring a <em>korbon</em> in this case? Why is this a seeming exception to the rule of <em>misasek</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The distinguishing characteristic of <em>misasek</em> vs <em>shogeg</em> seems to be that the former refers to when your intended action was not actualized, while the latter refers to when you did what you meant to do but without intending to sin thereby. For example, in\n<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=35&daf=20&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Keritot 20a</a> we have the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבא אמר ליקדם איכא בינייהו והתניא היו לפניו שתי נרות דולקות (ארוכות) ונתכוין לכבות את זו וכיבה את זו להדליק את זו והדליק את זו פטור להדליק ולכבות וכיבה והדליק בנשימה אחת חייב [בשתי נשימות פטור] פשיטא מהו דתימא לא איתעבד מחשבתיה דהא להדליק מעיקרא בעי ולבסוף לכבות וכי עבד מעשה כיבה ובסוף הדליק הוא ואימא פטור קא משמע לן נהי דאקדומי  (נמי) לא מקדים אחורי נמי לא מאחר</p>\n<p>Raba said, They differ in the matter of sequence. As it has been taught: If there were before a\nperson [on the Sabbath] two burning [or extinguished] candles and he intended to extinguish the\none but extinguished the other, or to kindle the one but kindled the other, he is exempt; if he\nintended first to kindle the one and then to extinguish the other, and he first extinguished and then\nkindled, if with one breath6 he is liable, if with two breaths he is exempt. But is this not obvious? —\nI might have thought that <strong>since his design was not realized</strong>, seeing that he wanted first to kindle and\nthen to extinguish, but in his act [we might regard it as if] the extinguishing was done first and then\nthe kindling, he should accordingly be exempt; therefore we are told [that this is not so]; for although\n[the kindling] did not precede [the extinguishing], neither did it follow.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Krithoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems here that the factor that would exempt you is that your goal was not actualized, which is different from lack of awareness that your action is sinful. See also Rashi and Tosafot in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=33&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 33a</a> (ד\"ה שאם נתכוון and ד\"ה נתכוון respectively, the latter of which cites the passage in Keritot as proof).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Misasek is when you don't intend to do what you did. Like you tried to pick up an object from the ground but accidently pulled off grass. If you know what you are doing and the results of what you are doing it's not misasek.</p>\n<p>Thus if you forgot it's shabbos, that has no effect on the intent of the action which you did. Therefore it's not misasek.</p>\n\n\n",

Then there's a group of people called \"the Yechidim\" (referred to as \"the Yechidimz\" in 18th-century Hebrew-to-English transliteration) who would assemble from time to time.

On Yom Kippur. For Moses ascended to the mountain three times, and was there for 120 days from the 6th of Sivan when he ascended to there until Yom Kippur which is the 10th of Tishrei. And on that day it was said that God repented on the matter of the [golden] calf, that day He said to him \"I have forgiven by your words, and that day it was said to him \"and build me a sanctuary\", and that day he said to Him \"and You should forgive our iniquities and our sins and make us  an inheritance\" – this day make us an inheritance of forgiveness for generations. And on that day God said to him \"for on this day he shall [bring] forgiveness on you\". And they made the mishkan with joy and happiness. And in how many months was the work of the mishkan completed? R. Samuel Bar Nachman said in three months the work of the mishkan was completed: Tishrei, Merachshevan, [and] Kislev, and it was left and dismantled [during] Teves, Shevat, and Adar, and they put it up on the first of Nissan as it says \"on the first day of the first month yo shall erect the mishkan the tent of meeting. R. Chanina says on the 1st of Adar the work of the mishkan was completed. Why? for work that is done in the summer in one day is done in the winter in two days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this midrash we see that the day of start and the day of being  finally erected were known; the only unknown was how much of the interim time was spent on building it and how much was a delay until Nissan. The basis of the differing opinions seems to simply be an assessment of how long such a project would take, and once we know how long it would take then we can assume that the remaining time was a delay (for reasons explained in the midrash but not relevant to this answer).</p>\n\n\n",

It could be what the Jews re-establishing the sacrifices felt was the right thing to do, but I do not know if it was strictly speaking a \"requirement\". Would it have been equally acceptable to bring a fire that has its original source elsewhere? The story of Aaron's sons and their \"strange fire\" might lead one to be especially careful in this and using the flint could have been seen as a precaution. Does anyone know of places in the Talmud or other sources that speak of this and the relevant concerns?</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara brings the line from Tehillim where Malki-Tzedek is mentioned, as a reference to this exchange:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר לו אברהם וכי מקדימין ברכת עבד לברכת קונו מיד נתנה לאברהם שנאמר נאם ה' לאדני שב לימיני עד אשית אויביך הדום לרגליך (תהלים קי, א) ובתריה כתיב נשבע ה' ולא ינחם אתה כהן לעולם על דברתי מלכי צדק (תהלים קי, ד) על דיבורו של מלכי צדק</p>\n<p>Abraham said to him: And does one place the blessing of the servant before the blessing of his master? You should have blessed God first. Immediately the Holy One, Blessed be He, gave the priesthood to Abraham, as it is stated: “The Lord says to my lord: Sit at My right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool” (Psalms 110:1), <strong>and afterward it is written: “The Lord has sworn, and will not repent: you shall be a priest forever, because you are a king of righteousness [al divrati malki tzedek]” (Psalms 110:4), which is explained homiletically to mean: Due to the improper words [divrati] of Melchizedek, the offspring of Abraham shall be priests of G-d forever.</strong> (Sefaria translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The first is that it is a later addition (see this <a href=\"https://www.oztorah.com/2007/07/the-strange-6th-verse-of-maoz-tzur/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> by R' Apple and also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%27oz_Tzur#Content\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>), which is supported by the fact that it is not included in the מרדכ\"י acrostic and it contains references to later events. The last stanza is also brought in the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34914&st=&pgnum=212\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur</a> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42571&st=&pgnum=182\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shenei</a> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43028&st=&pgnum=208\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Luchot haBerit</a> by R' Yechiel Mikhal Epstein (d. 1706):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מצאתי כתוב מאחר שהשיר של מעוז צור אינו קאי רק על ג' מלכיות, בבל מדי יון, אבל מלכות רביעי, גלות אדום וישמעאל לא נזכר בו כלום. על כן התקינו איזה חרוזות המדברים על גאולת מגלות הזה, שיאמר אחר השיר מעוז בניגון מעוז צור.‏</p>\n<p>I have found written that because the poem <em>Maoz Tzur</em> does only discuss three kingdoms, Babylonia, Persia and Greece, but the fourth kingdom, the exile of Edom and Yishmael is not mentioned at all. Therefore these stanzas were instituted that speak about the redemption of this exile, which is said after the poem <em>Maoz [Tzur]</em> using the melody of <em>Maoz Tzur.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here he lists other <a href=\"https://www.srugim.co.il/132525-%D7%9E%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%A9%D7%A8-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9A-%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%96-%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">later stanzas</a> attributed to R' Moses Isserles and other rabbanim. However, the mentioned article and the Yekke prayer book <em>Tefilat Yeshurun</em> suggest another reason, namely that it was deleted due to censorship (see also <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%96_%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A8#%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%95%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew Wikipedia</a>). The <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ma-x0027-oz-x1e92-ur\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Encyclopedia Judaica</a> (Vol. 13 p. 496) assumes that the initials ח\"זק in the last stanza belong to the מרדכ\"י acrostic, which was a common feature of medieval liturgical poems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.magnespress.co.il/contributor/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%9D_%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avraham Frankl</a> also rejects the former hypothesis and <a href=\"http://shaalvim.co.il/uploads/files/14-B-8%209-21.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brings evidence</a> (pp. 15–16) that the last verse forms an integral part of the poem. Besides the otherwise missing fourth kingdom and reference to redemption, he argues that he is not aware of other poems, where a stanza with an acrostic was appended. The meter and the rhyming structure also match the first verses in contrast with the other ones mentioned in the Kitzur Shelah, further supporting his claim.</p>\n\n\n",

It just means that by doing a mitzvah you won't be worse off than by not doing it – if you were not in danger before you won't be in danger now, but if you were in danger before, the mitzvah won't make the danger go away.</p>\n<p>Such an explanation could account for a large number of the alleged instances of people getting harmed on the way to doing a mitzvah.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere (commentary to Chullin 7b) he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מקשים והא אמרינן שלוחי מצוה אינן ניזוקין לא בהליכתן ולא בחזירתן ונראה לפרש דמה\"ט קאמר דמרצה כדם עולה שהעולה באה לכפרה על הרהורי הלב ואפשר דבהדי דאזיל לדבר מצוה קמהרהר בעבירה הוה ושכיח הזיקא הוה וכה\"ג קאמרינן בסוף מכילתין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This sounds like an easy (and practically unfalsifiable) way to address your question. Just say that anyone who was harmed must have been having a sinful thought at the time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Steipler (I think this is in Birchas Peretz on the plague of frogs) says that the statement שלוחי מצוה אינן נזוקין - messengers who perform a mitzva are not hurt - means that they will not be hurt <em>because</em> of the mitzva that they are doing, it is possible that they could be hurt or killed in the process anyway though, as something which was going to happen to them anyway, in which case the fact that they were hurt or killed in the process of performing a <em>mitzva</em> is a great merit.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Aristotle didn't have a concept of momentum. Instead he writes about impetus. Impetus is something an intellect impacts to an object that causes motion until it runs out. (To bring some Judaism into my <em>mashal</em>, the Rambam presents the idea in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_2.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Guide to the Perplexed, Book 2, ch 4-5</a>.)</p>\n<p>It wasn't until Newton's Laws of Motion that we get a Law of Conservation of Momentum.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>Because on earth, in normal situations, this conservation is not experienced. We have friction, including wind drag, slowing down every object. In daily observed reality, Aristotle seems right. \"The tendency of the object to keep moving in the same direction unless acted on by an outside force\" isn't seen, because everything down here on earth <strong>is</strong> acted on by an outside force. One of the first things done when humanity entered space is demonstrate the Conservation of Momentum in an environment where such outside forces are negligible.</p>\n<p>The fact that we hadn't seen momentum conserved didn't mean the rule was false. It just meant there were always other factors in play.</p>\n<p>Now if that's true for physics, how much more so it must be true for something like <em>Hashgachah Peratis</em> (Divine Providence for individuals)!</p>\n<p>So, we have rules about prayer and <em>bitachon</em> (trust in G-d) and other such -- like our case of \"<em>sheluchei mitzvah</em>\" -- that often seem to be violated. But they aren't, it's that the interplay between these factors are beyond our ability to comprehend.</p>\n<p>I would say, though, the that meta-rule of Providence always holds true, since it's the sole meta-rule, there are no other factors. Each person recieves exactly what they need to maximize their chances of becoming the best person they can, both in terms of doing good and of doing well.</p>\n\n\n",

This plot sounds plausible except for one major intricacy - <strong>God does not fulfill his promise to bring his people to the coveted land</strong>, the pinnacle of the whole grand plan of Exodus was about. A naive reader is left puzzled - will God keep his promise or some unforeseeable conditions will jeopardize it (again).</p>\n<p>But why, actually: the last lines cover the beginning of the post-Mosaic era anyway, Moses already knew the future, entering the Land was not a secret, and a nice closure would definitely contribute to the credibility of the book?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks z\"l addresses this question <a href=\"https://rabbisacks.org/end-without-an-ending/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>He writes as follows (my emphasis) in his typically inimitable style:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judaism is the only civilisation to have set its golden age not in the past but in the future</strong>. We hear this at the beginning of the Moses story, although not until the end do we realise its significance. Moses asks God: What is Your name? God replies: Ehyeh asher Ehyeh, literally, “I will be what I will be” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.3.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ex. 3:14</a>). We assume this means something like “I am what I am – unlimited, indescribable, beyond the reach of a name.” That may be part of the meaning. But the fundamental point is: My name is the future. “I am what will be.” <strong>God is in the call from the future to the present, from the destination to us who are still on the journey. What distinguishes Judaism from Christianity is that in answer to the question “Has the Messiah come?” the Jewish answer is always: Not yet. Moses’ death, his unfinished life, his glimpse of the land of the future, is the supreme symbol of the not-yet.</strong></p>\n<p>“It is not for you to complete the task, but neither are you free to desist from it” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Avot 2:16</a>). <strong>The challenges we face as human beings are never resolved simply, quickly, completely. The task takes many lifetimes. It is beyond the reach of a single individual, even the greatest; it is beyond the scope of a single generation, even the most epic.</strong> Deuteronomy ends by telling us: “Never again has there arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.34.10?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut. 34:10</a>). But even his life was, necessarily, incomplete.</p>\n<p>As we see him, on Mount Nebo, looking across the Jordan to Israel in the distance, we sense the vast, challenging truth that confronts us all. <strong>Each person has a promised land he or she will not reach, a horizon beyond the limits of his or her vision. What makes this bearable is our intense existential bond between the generations – between parent and child, teacher and disciple, leader and follower. The task is bigger than us, but it will live on after us, as something of us will live on in those we have influenced</strong>.</p>\n<p>The greatest mistake we can make is to do nothing because we cannot do everything. Even Moses discovered that it was not for him to complete the task. That would only be achieved by Joshua, and even then the story of the Israelites was only just beginning. Moses’ death tells us something fundamental about mortality. Life is not robbed of meaning because one day it will end. For in truth – even in this world, before we turn our thoughts to eternal life in the World to Come – we become part of eternity when we write our chapter in the book of the story of our people and hand it on to those who will come after us. The task – building a society of justice and compassion, an oasis in a desert of violence and corruption – is greater than any one lifetime. The Jewish people have returned to the land, but the vision is not yet complete. This is still a violent, aggressive world. Peace still eludes us, as does much else. We have not yet reached the destination, though we see it in the distance, as did Moses. <strong>The Torah ends without an ending to tell us that we too are part of the story; we too are still on the journey....</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So to answer your question in brief, the Torah ends in the way it does to demonstrate to us an important lesson - we all have goals in life, some of which we will not accomplish.

The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.249.1?lang=he&p2=Beit_Yosef%2C_Orach_Chaim.249.7.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beis Yosef</a> brings from the Raavid that as soon as one begins (tosefes) Shaabos at sunset he should end his fast, and the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.249.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur</a> brings from the Maharam that one may even end his fast as soon as he davens and accepts Shabbos before sunset (completing the fast meaning until one actually starts Shabbos). As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4732/asara-bteveis-on-a-friday?r=SearchResults\">pointed out</a> by @GershonGold, there may be Poskim who say like this. (As always, CYLOR.)</p>\n<p>As for why the main opinion of the Shulchan Aruch is to fast until tzeis hachochavinm, it would seem that this is based upon the shita of Rabenu Tam, that until tzes it is not considered that the sun has set. We see this in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Taanit.18b.11?lang=he&with=Rosh&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh</a> who writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מתענה ומשלים פי' אם ירצה ולא הוי כמתענה בשבת וכיון שיכול להשלים אם ירצה והוא קיבל עליו תענית סתם וכל תענית שלא שקעה עליו החמה אינו תענית צריך להשלים עד צאת הכוכבים</p>\n<p>[And the halacha is that one] \"fasts and completes\", meaning if one wishes to, this is not considered like fasting on Shabbos. And since one is able to complete [the fast] if he desires, and he accepted upon himself a fast without conditions, and any fast that the sun does not set upon it is not considered a fast, he must complete [his fast] until the stars come out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saying that the end of a fast with sunset is the same as when the stars come out is the opinion of Rabenu Tam, as explained elsewhere in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Taanit.12a.1?lang=he&with=Rosh&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the Rosh, the time between sunset and tzes hachochavim is tosefes Shabbos, the time that we add on to Shabbos. This is not the actual day of Shabbos, so fasting during this time is not like fasting on Shabbos itself. Even during the end of that period when it is bein hashemashos and Shabbos has already started from safek, since it might still be considered part of the day, and completing the fast is allowed, as this is still considered only coming into Shabbos while fasting, and not actually fasting on Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n",

(Surely this has been asked before, but I did not find the question when I searched a few ways.)</p>\n<p>Clarification and update:\nI relied on the English word \"pure\" when asking the question. But I am learning there are various Hebrew words for the word pure (e.g., relating to source of the oil, clarity, tahor), and the pasuk concerning lighting the Temple Menorah uses zach, a word that refers to physical purity rather than spiritual (tahor).  But the quote provided by @DannySchoemann seems to refer to lack of spiritual purity (i.e., tamei), so perhaps the encompassing nature of the English word pure is a useful translation, capturing all aspects of oil that would make it not suitable for use.</p>\n<p>In any case, I found two webpages that discuss the topic of my question:<BR>\n<a href=\"https://www.ohr.edu/this_week/talmud_tips/7148\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ohr.edu/this_week/talmud_tips/7148</a><BR>\n<a href=\"https://www.oxfordchabad.org/templates/blog/post.asp?aid=708481&PostID=96756&p=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.oxfordchabad.org/templates/blog/post.asp?aid=708481&PostID=96756&p=1</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As noted, there are two types of purity required in the oil for the Menorah: clarity of the oil, שמן זית זך, as elaborated upon in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Menachot.8.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mishna in Menachos</a>, and ritual purity, טהרה, that is needed for all offerings in the Temple of any sort. These two concepts together contributed to the dilemma leading to the Chanuka miracle. Since the oil needed is of a very specific grade of clarity, there wasn't very much of it sitting around so that the Maccabees could just go to any old storehouse; it was only in the Temple storage areas. Those stores had been contaminated by the Greeks with ritual impurity, and only the one sealed vessel was still ritually pure. In order to attain oil that was both of the correct type and also ritually pure, they would have to travel eight days round trip, or wait until they could purify themselves through the seven day purification process and then produce new oil (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Beit_Yosef%2C_Orach_Chaim.670.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see B.Y. 680</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The concept \"pure oil\" with regards to lighting the Menora in the Mikdash is explicitly defined in Menachot <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Menachot.8.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 8 Mishnayot 4</a> & 5.</p>\n<p>Basically, <strong>the olives are squeezed but not crushed, producing oil that doesn't need to be filtered.<br/>\nThis fulfills the Biblical command of שמן זית זָך - pure olive oil - in that it was always pure and didn't need filtering to become so</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here's the original, with Sefaria's unedited translation.

This is alluded to in the verses that write Potiphar’s name differently: Initially, it is written “Potiphar” (Genesis 39:1) and in the end it is written “Poti-phera” (Genesis 41:45). The change in his name indicates that a part of himself was mutilated. (Sefaria translation and notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>ADDENDUM</strong></p>\n<p>I heard from my Rebbi the following:\nThe Gemorah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.4b.26?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 4b</a> says that the malach Michoel travels with one wing, whereas Gavriel travels around with two wings (refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.4b.23?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Berakhot.4b.23.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>). The Maharshah explains that Michoel is the malach of Rachamim (mercy) which we want as quickly as possible. However, Gavriel is the malach of Din (judgement) which we want to delay. With this idea we can explain why Gavriel found Yosef looking for his brothers. Targum Yonason Ben Uziel points out that that incident began the enslavement of the Jewish people in Egypt. <strong>Since that was a time of מדת הדין, it had to be Gavriel that led Yosef to his brothers, and to eventually be sold to Egypt</strong>.</p>\n<p>When Yosef first met his brothers after twenty-two years, what would have happened if he would have immediately greeted them and identified himself? <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.50.21?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.50.21.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> in Parshas Vayechi says that after Yaakov’s death, the brothers thought Yosef would kill them. Yosef calmed them down, saying that if he killed them, people would say they weren’t really his brothers. But Yosef needed people to know they were his brothers to prove he comes from a noble family and not from a slave-family.</p>\n<p>With his Rashi, we can explain that if Yosef would have immediately greeted his brothers when seeing them, they would have no need to stay in Egypt. However, by pretending not to know them and only later revealing himself as their brother, Yosef created an air of suspicion around the relationship he had with them. They had to stay in Egypt to let people know and to prove that they really are his brothers.</p>\n<p>According to this we can explain what Gavriel reminded Yosef of. He didn’t remind Yosef that the brothers sold him, rather he reminded Yosef of the מדת הדין and the fact that the שעיבוד מצרים (slavery in Egypt) had to begin. This is what compelled Yosef pretend not to know them and accuse them of espionage. By doing this, he was ensuring that when he eventually identifies himself with them, they would have to remain in Egypt.</p>\n<p>So possibly, on a surface level, Gavriel who represented the side of judgement was tied up with the story of Yosef. It was one that was predicated on din - judgement and led to the eventual enslavement of the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See Medrash Tanchuma</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&perek=46&mefaresh=tanhuma\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&perek=46&mefaresh=tanhuma</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רשב\"י: אמר הקדוש ברוך הוא לישראל: היו מכבדין את המצוות, שהן שלוחי\nושלוחו של אדם כמותו, אם כבדת אותן כאילו לי כבדתני, ואם בזית אותן כאילו\nלכבודי בזית, אין לך אדם שכבד את המצות ועשה את התורה כיעקב, שנאמר: (שם\nכה) ויעקב איש תם יושב אהלים ונתייסר בבנו. א\"ל הקב\"ה: חייך, אבדת אחד\nתמצא ג': יוסף, מנשה ואפרים. כיון שבאו בשרו אותו שיוסף חי, שלח יהודה\nפרוזבטים אצלו, ואת יהודה שלח לפניו, זה שאמר הכתוב: המשל ופחד עמו עושה\nשלום במרומיו (איוב כה). המשל, זה מיכאל. ופחד, זה גבריאל. מיכאל מן המים\nוגבריאל מן האש, והן עומדין לפני השכינה ואינן מזיקין זה את זה, הוי\nאומר: עושה שלום במרומיו.</p>\n<p>אמר ר' שמעון: כל הרקיע של מים והמלאכים של אש, ומשרתיו אש לוהט, ואין\nהמים מכבין את האש ולא האש שורף את המים. יהודה ויוסף, זה ארי וזה שור\nאתמול מתנגחין זה עם זה, ועכשיו הוא משלחו אצלו, שנאמר: ואת יהודה שלח\nלפניו הוי, עושה שלום במרומיו:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Loose translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai said, “Hashem said to the benei yisrael,\n‘Honour the mitzvos, for they are my messengers and the messenger of a\nperson is like himself.

    "content": "# What is the halakha for public displays of contrition / regret for sin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In many places in Tanakh we are told of people wearing sackcloth openly, putting ash on their heads and lamenting publicly on account of their sins and the sins of the community. Hashem  commands this of the priests through the prophet Joel in Joel 1:13.</p>\n<p>I have been wondering what the halakha regarding this practice is. Has anyone outlined the conditions that must be met before a person or a community ventures to do such a thing? What are the upper and lower limits for such displays?</p>\n<p>Many thanks.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It can be called for communally; in fact the Mishna in Taanit describes public fasts because of famine, drought, war, natural disasters, and the like; everyone would gather and the communal leaders would <em>first</em> put ash on their own heads, then everyone would follow. (If the leader insists on <em>others</em> suffering while he's fully comfortable ... the message doesn't stick.) Contemporary Israeli rabbis have debated when exactly to invoke these today. (E.g. severe drought a few years ago, though thank God they're far less fatal due to modern technology and trade.)</p>\n<p>For the individual on his/her own ... I'd tread very, very lightly. Talmud Yoma 86b says if a sin was private and was between the sinner and God, then it's best to <em>not</em> publicize it. (That does not, however, mean actively denying or covering it up.) Maimonides, Laws of Repentance 2:5 codifies this. If someone ate bacon on live television and now wants to repent, Raavad feels he should get back on TV and say \"I ate bacon and now repented\", whereas Kesef Mishnah reads Maimonides as saying there's nothing gained and much lost in rehashing that.</p>\n<p>In the early 1800s, Rabbi Avraham Danzig in his code <em>Chayei Adam</em> on the laws of Yom Kippur notes that he sees people doing amazing acts of asceticism on Yom Kippur -- some never sat down the entire 24-hour period, apparently. He cautioned that the more dramatic the one-day display, very often the quicker such folks rushed right back into their old behaviors.</p>\n<p>Medieval sources talked about self-affliction (e.g. sitting in snow or cold water) as a step to repentance, but most contemporary rabbis advise the typical person against it, other than maybe some occasional extra fasts. (Rabbi Asher Weiss, one of today's leading experts on medical <em>halacha</em>, was asked by someone who could have done better to prevent nursing-home residents from being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and failed to do so, and one of them died of COVID-19. He says the whole medieval self-affliction thing is really not for most people today, and instead suggests the fellow redouble his efforts to help protect people's lives.)</p>\n\n\n",

Worship was conducted by the head of the family and entrusted to the firstborn son...In the house of Isaac, Esau was in charge of sacrifices. The neglect of those responsibilities induced Jacob to buy the birthright from him...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that according to this, at least one of the reasons Yaakov bought the birthright from his brother was because he thought someone had to assume responsibility for the priestly role in the family.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Places of worship, consisting primarily of an altar, were erected on certain occasions...Abraham, as is repeatedly mentioned, built altars that were not intended for sacrifices but were places of prayer where he also propounded his teachings. These altars were close to his tents and were the places of his daily prayer. Pillars were erected by Jacob at sites of divine revelations to commemorate their occurrence. (pg. 49)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And according to this, the Avot erected altars and pillars out of their duty of creating places of worship. Interestingly, Yaakov only began erecting pillars and altars after receiving the birthright. Avraham didn't have to receive the high priesthood from Malki-tzedek to erect altars because, as head of his branch of the Bnei Terach clan, he was already in the role of a high-ranking priest.</p>\n\n\n",

Early Perspectives</a>\". Greeks assumed divine laws perfect, immutable, rational, unwritten, and understood only by divine beings. The human law for them was imperfect, untrue and given by a human ruler. If the ruler was a philosopher - then it could be close to being perfect, but not perfect. Such a paradigm is completely incompatible with the Jewish rabbinic tradition, where the Torah is divine, known, not always rational, with new rabbinic details and halachos emerging, as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.85.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 85:12</a> teaches:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Truth springs up from the earth; justice looks down from heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. understanding of certain notions, such as truth, justice, etc. is an evolving process. Furthermore, the Greek view denied divine providence and divine inspiration, as well as the spiritual power of rabbinic leadership. That's why Greece is compared to darkness for it did not offer any hope for salvation either through law, or through prayer, or through tradition.</p>\n<p>As the Hellenist Jewish writers unsuccessfully tried to adapt the Jewish philosophy into the Greek one, they distorted Jewish philosophy. Philo from Alexandria tried to say that Torah is the eternal perfect divine law, but could not fend criticism about prophetic and rabbinic changes. The second position was advocated by groups which eventually created Christianity that modifiable Jewish law was man-made, not divine, so that they abolished most of it. An alternative opposition to them was the view of Saducees that both Torah and Nach mitzvos are deoraysa, which yields an uncompromisingly strict position as reaction to Hellenism.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How Do Modern Orthodox Women Typically Dress?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am currently studying to convert (as you can tell I still have quite a ways to go but I will get there eventually) and, for awhile I was set on conservative but, recently, I've  been quite interested in MO. If this were any other year I would look into visiting a local MO synagogue but, alas, it seems as though all of my questions are going to be directed to internet strangers for the time being. I cannot seem to find more than a couple of very (and I mean very) vague answers to 'What do MO women wear on a day-to-day basis?' Do they wear trousers often? If so what type? What about Short sleeves? How much hair to married women cover?\nThank you for answering.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>There is a wide variety out there. I'd recommend Googling some synagogues that you might visit post-pandemic, and often there are photos there of its members. That should give you some sense. If you can arrange a socially-distanced outdoors chat with a woman in a prospective community, that could be incredibly helpful.</p>\n<p>As Alex commented, there's a wide variety included in \"Modern Orthodox.\" One dating site actually has categories such as \"Modern Orthodox - liberal\" and \"Modern Orthodox - machmir [stricter].\" Something to think about is what aspects of Judaism are speaking to you, and making Conservative feel like it's not the right fit. Finding a good fit with a community makes all the difference.</p>\n<p>Very roughly speaking, you would <em>at least</em> see this:</p>\n<p><strong>At synagogue:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Skirt or dress covering the knees</li>\n<li>Sleeves at least covering the shoulders</li>\n<li>Some sort of hat or other hair covering, for married women. (There are virtually no mainstream Orthodox communities in the US that expect never-yet-married women to cover their hair, in fact it would seem out of place. Widows and divorcees are a gray zone.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At home or the office, the more liberal side of Modern Orthodox would be comfortable with pants and no hair covering. (I think bare shoulders is still unusual.)</p>\n<p>(Those two right there -- pants and hair covering -- are actually commonly seen as questions in the Orthodox world when dating! There are women who say <em>no way am I going to cover my hair</em> and/or <em>I am perfectly comfortable wearing mom jeans to the grocery store on a Tuesday night, and I don't want my husband complaining that's immodest</em>, and there are guys who will say <em>no way I'm marrying a lady who fails to cover her hair and/or wears pants</em>. Or the reverse! There are also people who are more flexible.)</p>\n<p>Moving towards more traditionalism, you'd see at least some hair covering (at least outside the house), to \"as long as no more than 3 inches of hair are visible\", up to full hair covering [hat, scarf, or wig]; sleeves past the elbow; and always a skirt or dress [not pants, barring a job physically requiring it, e.g. many hospital settings] to nearly the ankles. (At this end of the spectrum, \"modern\" isn't about a lenient reading of modesty guidelines, but about a broader view of engagement with the outside world.)</p>\n<p>For a sense on this more right-wing side of Modern Orthodox (or \"Modern Orthodox <em>machmir</em>\"), the back row in this picture is a graduating class of women who are trained as \"advisors on halacha\" -- not aiming for a title like \"rabbi.\" Hair coverings (all these women are married) seen here are: wigs, wigs-with-hairbands, cover-it-all hats, and hats/scarves with a small stripe of hair visible. (Also seen here and very common -- find a dress that doesn't cover enough of the arms and/or neckline, and add a long-sleeve t-shirt or \"shell\".) All these women attended the same seminary, with a curriculum developed by Rabbi and Rabbanit Henkin -- more on the former below. <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wpbQY.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wpbQY.jpg\" alt=\"Graduating class of yoatzot\" /></a></p>\n<p>All of the above comes down basically to interpreting various statements in the Talmud, surprise surprise. <a href=\"https://traditiononline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Henkin-QX.1.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehuda Herzl Henkin's article in Tradition 37:3 (2003) on <em>Tzniut</em></a> (modesty) (I believe it's also included in one of his books) goes through all of these in depth and is recommended, if you have the patience to go through a whole lot of nitty-gritty source material. (Rabbi Falk's book on <em>Tzniut</em> reflects a very right-wing ultra-Orthodox approach; unless that's what you want, please avoid it. Rabbi Henkin rejects Rabbi Falk's approach, which he feels can lead to <em>we are so afraid of women standing out that we can't let them be outstanding.</em>)</p>\n<p>Good luck with your spiritual journey, especially during these trying times.</p>\n\n\n",

Each provided a reason for his actions: One gave a reason for his actions: The number of lights corresponds to the bulls of the Festival. And one gave a reason for his actions: The number of lights is based on the principle: One elevates to a higher level in matters of sanctity and one does not downgrade. (Davidson Edition translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Tov_Asevilli\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ritva</a> there (d.h. echad) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> אחד עשה כדברי ב\"ש. ואפי' למ\"ד שהעושה כדברי ב\"ש לא עשה כלום או חייב מיתה כדאיתא בפרק קמא דברכות (י\"א א'), שאני הכא שאין מחלוקתם אלא להדור מצוה בעלמא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One acted in accordance with the view of Beit Shammai: And even according to the opinion(s) that one who acts in accordance with the view of Beit Shammai has done nothing, or deserves death, as is brought in the first chapter of Berachot (11a), here is different, since their argument was only about <em>Hiddur Mitzvah</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In case you thought it was just Ritva (or that Ritva was not enough), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yisrael_Meir_Kagan\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan Poupko</a> understood this to be the view of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Alfasi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rif</a>, before the Ritva was published. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.671.2?lang=he&p2=Biur_Halacha.671.2.3&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beur Halacha to Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 671:2 (d.h. veyesh)</a> he writes that since Rif brought this section of the Talmud, he understood that one fulfilled the Mitzvah (presumably even in a Mehadrin Min Hamehadrin fashion). However, as he writes there, since no one else had made this suggestion, he would not rule in this fashion.</p>\n<p>However, since then, we have merited to the Ritva's commentary, which was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat_(Talmud)#Rishonim\" rel=\"noreferrer\">printed in 1967</a> (long after Rabbi Poupko passed away), and explicitly makes this statement. Thus, it is likely that Rabbi Poupko would rule that one has fulfilled the Mitzvah nowadays.</p>\n<p>Note: This view is also explicitly taken by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordecai_Benet\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Mordechai Bannet</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Shalom_Eliashiv\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv</a>, Daf Al Hadaf (all found in commentaries to this section on Shabbat 21b) and Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Minchat Shlomo Tinyana (#58), and is implied by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Joshua_Falk\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Ya'akov Yehoshua Falk</a> in his P'nei Yehoshua commentary there (d.h. sham peligi bah).</p>\n<p>(See also Daf Al Hadaf there, which provides further commentary on the story of the two elders, including some \"chassidishe torah\", but this seems to be the mainstream view.)</p>\n<p>It is hard to know whether an omission of this view by Shulchan Aruch and Rambam is meaningful, as they only discuss the view of Beit Hillel. One could argue that it is,  from a well-known acronym of the word Chanukah. Abudarham (Hilchot Chanukah) writes that the word Chanukah is an acronym for:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ח</strong>' <strong>נ</strong>רות <strong>ו</strong>הלכה <strong>כ</strong>בית <strong>ה</strong>לל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eight candles, and the Halacha follows Beit Hillel</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although we might have the tendency to look at this simply as a cute saying, see Sheyarei Knesset Hagedolah, Orach Chaim 489:3 who writes strongly to defend such statements, and includes this statement in his list.</p>\n<p>This statement is also brought by various Acharonim, such as Knesset Hagedolah, Ateret Zahav and Peri Megadim to various parts of Orach Chaim 670, for some, within the discussion of the view of how many candles to light, and for others, as a nice saying at the end.</p>\n<p>If we take this view literally, it seems that the various views <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.11a.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 11a</a> should apply. It is beyond the scope of a Mi Yodeya answer to now research exactly the Halachic ramifications of acting like Beit Shammai, and to what degree we follow the different views in Berachot 11a, but it is possible that according to that view, one would not fulfill the Mitzvah of Chanukah candles. Perhaps (B'ezrat Hashem) I will have time to write an article on this someday...</p>\n<p>Edit: some further reading can be found <a href=\"http://haoros.com/archive/index.asp?kovetz=831&cat=3&haoro=5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.haoros.com/archive/index.asp?kovetz=831&cat=3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> (at the bottom of the page).</p>\n\n\n",

Similar is (Job 8:11) “Can reed-grass (אחו) grow?”,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>then on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.41.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.41.3.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(41:3)</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודקות בשר. טינב\"ש בְּלַעַז, לְשׁוֹן דַּק: ודקות בשר THIN-FLESHED in\nold French tenuis, meaning thin,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and again twice in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.41.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.41.5.1-2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(41:5)</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>twice בקנה אחת. טוד\"ל בְּלַעַז: בקנה אחד ON ONE STALK— Tuyau in old\nFrench בריאות. שיינ\"ש בְּלַעַז:</p>\n<p>בריאות sains, English HEALTHY.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That pattern continue for many more pesukim. Is there something unique about Mikeitz that Rashi decided using old French to translate so many terms was necessary?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Daniel Glatstein <a href=\"https://www.torahanytime.com/#/lectures?v=134152\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quotes</a> the Ben L'Ashri who explains since Mikeitz normally falls out during or shortly after Chanukah, and the Yom Tov has the ability to infuse the most seemingly mundane areas of life with holiness, Rashi wanted to hint to this profound power of Chanukah through quoting so many translations of the Torah in a foreign language.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, the truth of His [being] does not resemble the truth of any of their [beings].</p>\n<p>ג\nוְאִם יַעֲלֶה עַל הַדַּעַת שֶׁאֵין כָּל הַנִּמְצָאִים מִלְּבַדּוֹ מְצוּיִים הוּא לְבַדּוֹ יִהְיֶה מָצוּי. וְלֹא יִבָּטֵל הוּא לְבִטּוּלָם. שֶׁכָּל הַנִּמְצָאִים צְרִיכִין לוֹ וְהוּא בָּרוּךְ הוּא אֵינוֹ צָרִיךְ לָהֶם וְלֹא לְאֶחָד מֵהֶם. לְפִיכָךְ אֵין אֲמִתָּתוֹ כַּאֲמִתַּת אֶחָד מֵהֶם:</p>\n<p>4\nThis is implied by the prophet's statement [Jeremiah 10:10]: \"And God, your Lord, is true\" - i.e., He alone is true and no other entity possesses truth that compares to His truth. This is what [is meant by] the Torah's statement [Deuteronomy 4:35]: \"There is nothing else aside from Him\" - i.e., aside from Him, there is no true existence like His.</p>\n<p>ד\nהוּא שֶׁהַנָּבִיא אוֹמֵר (ירמיה י י) \"וַה' אֱלֹהִים אֱמֶת\". הוּא לְבַדּוֹ הָאֱמֶת וְאֵין לְאַחֵר אֱמֶת כַּאֲמִתָּתוֹ. וְהוּא שֶׁהַתּוֹרָה אוֹמֶרֶת (דברים ד לה) \"אֵין עוֹד מִלְּבַדּוֹ\". כְּלוֹמַר אֵין שָׁם מָצוּי אֱמֶת מִלְּבַדּוֹ כְּמוֹתוֹ:</p>\n<p>5\nThis entity is the God of the world and the Lord of the entire earth. He controls the sphere with infinite and unbounded power. This power [continues] without interruption, because the sphere is constantly revolving, and it is impossible for it to revolve without someone causing it to revolve. [That one is] He, blessed be He, who causes it to revolve without a hand or any [other] corporeal dimension.</p>\n<p>ה\nהַמָּצוּי הַזֶּה הוּא אֱלֹהֵי הָעוֹלָם אֲדוֹן כָּל הָאָרֶץ. וְהוּא הַמַּנְהִיג הַגַּלְגַּל בְּכֹחַ שֶׁאֵין לוֹ קֵץ וְתַכְלִית. בְּכֹחַ שֶׁאֵין לוֹ הֶפְסֵק. שֶׁהַגַּלְגַּל סוֹבֵב תָּמִיד וְאִי אֶפְשָׁר שֶׁיִּסֹּב בְּלֹא מְסַבֵּב. וְהוּא בָּרוּךְ הוּא הַמְסַבֵּב אוֹתוֹ בְּלֹא יָד וּבְלֹא גּוּף:</p>\n<p>6\nThe knowledge of this concept is a positive commandment, as [implied by Exodus 20:2]: \"I am God, your Lord....\"</p>\n<p>Anyone who presumes that there is another god transgresses a negative commandment, as [Exodus 20:3] states: \"You shall have no other gods before Me\" and denies a fundamental principle [of faith], because this is the great principle [of faith] upon which all depends.</p>\n<p>ו\nוִידִיעַת דָּבָר זֶה מִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמות כ ב) \"אָנֹכִי ה' אֱלֹהֶיךָ\". וְכָל הַמַּעֲלֶה עַל דַּעְתּוֹ שֶׁיֵּשׁ שָׁם אֱלוֹהַּ אַחֵר חוּץ מִזֶּה עוֹבֵר בְּלֹא תַּעֲשֶׂה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמות כ ג) \"לֹא יִהְיֶה לְךָ אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים עַל פָּנָי\". וְכוֹפֵר בָּעִקָּר שֶׁזֶּהוּ הָעִקָּר הַגָּדוֹל שֶׁהַכּל תָּלוּי בּוֹ:</p>\n<p>7\nThis God is one. He is not two or more, but one, unified in a manner which [surpasses] any unity that is found in the world; i.e., He is not one in the manner of a general category which includes many individual entities, nor one in the way that the body is divided into different portions and dimensions. Rather, He is unified, and there exists no unity similar to His in this world.</p>\n<p>If there were many gods, they would have body and form, because like entities are separated from each other only through the circumstances associated with body and form.</p>\n<p>Were the Creator to have body and form, He would have limitation and definition, because it is impossible for a body not to be limited. And any entity which itself is limited and defined [possesses] only limited and defined power. Since our God, blessed be His name, possesses unlimited power, as evidenced by the continuous revolution of the sphere, we see that His power is not the power of a body. Since He is not a body, the circumstances associated with bodies that produce division and separation are not relevant to Him. Therefore, it is impossible for Him to be anything other than one.</p>\n<p>The knowledge of this concept fulfills a positive commandment, as [implied by Deuteronomy 6:4]: \"[Hear, Israel,] God is our Lord, God is one.\"</p>\n<p>ז\nאֱלוֹהַּ זֶה אֶחָד הוּא וְאֵינוֹ שְׁנַיִם וְלֹא יֶתֶר עַל שְׁנַיִם. אֶלָּא אֶחָד. שֶׁאֵין כְּיִחוּדוֹ אֶחָד מִן הָאֲחָדִים הַנִּמְצָאִים בָּעוֹלָם. לֹא אֶחָד כְּמִין שֶׁהוּא כּוֹלֵל אֲחָדִים הַרְבֵּה. וְלֹא אֶחָד כְּגוּף שֶׁהוּא נֶחְלָק לְמַחְלָקוֹת וְלִקְצָווֹת. אֶלָּא יִחוּד שֶׁאֵין יִחוּד אַחֵר כְּמוֹתוֹ בָּעוֹלָם. אִלּוּ הָיוּ אֱלֹהוּת הַרְבֵּה הָיוּ גּוּפִין וּגְוִיּוֹת. מִפְּנֵי שֶׁאֵין הַנִּמְנִים הַשָּׁוִין בִּמְצִיאוּתָן נִפְרָדִין זֶה מִזֶּה אֶלָּא בִּמְאֹרָעִין שֶׁיֶּאֶרְעוּ בַּגּוּפוֹת וְהַגְּוִיּוֹת. וְאִלּוּ הָיָה הַיּוֹצֵר גּוּף וּגְוִיָּה הָיָה לוֹ קֵץ וְתַכְלִית שֶׁאִי אֶפְשָׁר לִהְיוֹת גּוּף שֶׁאֵין לוֹ קֵץ. וְכָל שֶׁיֵּשׁ לְגוּפוֹ קֵץ וְתַכְלִית יֵשׁ לְכֹחוֹ קֵץ וָסוֹף. וֵאלֹהֵינוּ בָּרוּךְ שְׁמוֹ הוֹאִיל וְכֹחוֹ אֵין לוֹ קֵץ וְאֵינוֹ פּוֹסֵק שֶׁהֲרֵי הַגַּלְגַּל סוֹבֵב תָּמִיד. אֵין כֹּחוֹ כֹּחַ גּוּף. וְהוֹאִיל וְאֵינוֹ גּוּף לֹא יֶאֶרְעוּ לוֹ מְאֹרְעוֹת הַגּוּפוֹת כְּדֵי שֶׁיְּהֵא נֶחְלָק וְנִפְרָד מֵאַחֵר. לְפִיכָךְ אִי אֶפְשָׁר שֶׁיִּהְיֶה אֶלָּא אֶחָד. וִידִיעַת דָּבָר זֶה מִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים ו ד) \"ה' אֱלֹהֵינוּ ה' אֶחָד\":</p>\n<p>8\nBehold, it is explicitly stated in the Torah and [the works of] the prophets that the Holy One, blessed be He, is not [confined to] a body or physical form, as [Deuteronomy 4:39, Joshua 2:11] states: \"Because God, your Lord, is the Lord in the heavens above and the earth below,\" and a body cannot exist in two places [simultaneously].</p>\n<p>Also, [Deuteronomy 4:15] states: \"For you did not see any image,\" and [Isaiah 40:25] states: \"To whom can you liken Me, with whom I will be equal.\" Were He [confined to] a body, He would resemble other bodies.</p>\n<p>ח\nהֲרֵי מְפֹרָשׁ בַּתּוֹרָה וּבַנְּבִיאִים שֶׁאֵין הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא גּוּף וּגְוִיָּה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר ( דברים ד לט יהושע ב יא) \"כִּי ה' אֱלֹהֵיכֶם הוּא אֱלֹהִים בַּשָּׁמַיִם מִמַּעַל וְעַל הָאָרֶץ מִתָּחַת\". וְהַגּוּף לֹא יִהְיֶה בִּשְׁנֵי מְקוֹמוֹת. וְנֶאֱמַר (דברים ד טו) \"כִּי לֹא רְאִיתֶם כָּל תְּמוּנָה\". וְנֶאֱמַר (ישעיה מ כה) \"וְאֶל מִי תְדַמְּיוּנִי וְאֶשְׁוֶה\". וְאִלּוּ הָיָה גּוּף הָיָה דּוֹמֶה לִשְׁאָר גּוּפִים:</p>\n<p>9\nIf so, what is the meaning of the expressions employed by the Torah: \"Below His feet\" [Exodus 24:10], \"Written by the finger of God\" [ibid. 31:18], \"God's hand\" [ibid. 9:3], \"God's eyes\" [Genesis 38:7], \"God's ears\" [Numbers 11:1], and the like?</p>\n<p>All these [expressions were used] to relate to human thought processes which know only corporeal imagery, for the Torah speaks in the language of man. They are only descriptive terms, as [apparent from Deuteronomy 32:41]: \"I will whet My lightning sword.\" Does He have a sword? Does He need a sword to kill? Rather, this is metaphoric imagery. [Similarly,] all [such expressions] are metaphoric imagery.</p>\n<p>A proof of this concept: One prophet says that he saw the Holy One, blessed be He, \"clothed in snow white\" [Daniel 7:9], and another envisioned Him [coming] \"with crimson garments from Batzra\" [Isaiah 63:1]. Moses, our teacher, himself envisioned Him at the [Red] Sea as a mighty man, waging war, and, at Mount Sinai, [saw Him] as the leader of a congregation, wrapped [in a tallit].</p>\n<p>This shows that He has no image or form. All these are merely expressions of prophetic vision and imagery and the truth of this concept cannot be grasped or comprehended by human thought. This is what the verse [Job 11:7] states: \"Can you find the comprehension of God? Can you find the ultimate bounds of the Almighty?\"</p>\n<p>ט\nאִם כֵּן מַהוּ זֶה שֶׁכָּתוּב בַּתּוֹרָה \"וְתַחַת רַגְלָיו\".

Thus, this person's [identity] is distinguished within one's mind from [that of] other men. Similarly, Moses, our teacher, asked that the existence of the Holy One, blessed be He, be distinguished in his mind from the existence of other entities, to the extent that he would know the truth of His existence as it is [in its own right].</p>\n<p>He, blessed be He, replied to him that it is not within the potential of a living man, [a creature of] body and soul, to comprehend this matter in its entirety. [Nevertheless,] He, blessed be He, revealed to [Moses] matters which no other man had known before him - nor would ever know afterward - until he was able to comprehend [enough] from the truth of His existence, for the Holy One, blessed be He, to be distinguished in his mind from other entities, as a person is distinguished from other men when one sees his back and knows the structure of his body and [the manner in which] he is clothed.</p>\n<p>This is alluded to by the verse [Exodus 33:23]: \"You shall see My back, but you shall not see My face.\"</p>\n<p>י\nמַהוּ זֶה שֶׁבִּקֵּשׁ משֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ לְהַשִּׂיג כְּשֶׁאָמַר (שמות לג יח) \"הַרְאֵנִי נָא אֶת כְּבֹדֶךָ\". בִּקֵּשׁ לֵידַע אֲמִתַּת הִמָּצְאוֹ שֶׁל הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא עַד שֶׁיִּהְיֶה יָדוּעַ בְּלִבּוֹ כְּמוֹ יְדִיעַת אֶחָד מִן הָאֲנָשִׁים שֶׁרָאָה פָּנָיו וְנֶחְקְקָה צוּרָתוֹ בְּלִבּוֹ שֶׁנִּמְצָא אוֹתוֹ הָאִישׁ נִפְרָד בְּדַעְתּוֹ מִשְּׁאָר הָאֲנָשִׁים. כָּךְ בִּקֵּשׁ משֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ לִהְיוֹת מְצִיאוּת הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא נִפְרֶדֶת בְּלִבּוֹ מִשְּׁאָר הַנִּמְצָאִים עַד שֶׁיֵּדַע אֲמִתַּת הִמָּצְאוֹ כַּאֲשֶׁר הִיא. וֶהֱשִׁיבוֹ בָּרוּךְ הוּא שֶׁאֵין כֹּחַ בְּדַעַת הָאָדָם הַחַי שֶׁהוּא מְחֻבָּר מִגּוּף וְנֶפֶשׁ לְהַשִּׂיג אֲמִתַּת דָּבָר זֶה עַל בֻּרְיוֹ. וְהוֹדִיעוֹ בָּרוּךְ הוּא מַה שֶּׁלֹּא יָדַע אָדָם לְפָנָיו וְלֹא יֵדַע לְאַחֲרָיו. עַד שֶׁהִשִּׂיג מֵאֲמִתַּת הִמָּצְאוֹ דָּבָר שֶׁנִּפְרָד הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא בְּדַעְתּוֹ מִשְּׁאָר הַנִּמְצָאִים. כְּמוֹ שֶׁיִּפָּרֵד אֶחָד מִן הָאֲנָשִׁים שֶׁרָאָה אֲחוֹרָיו וְהִשִּׂיג כָּל גּוּפוֹ וּמַלְבּוּשׁוֹ בְּדַעְתּוֹ מִשְּׁאָר גּוּפֵי הָאֲנָשִׁים. וְעַל דָּבָר זֶה רָמַז הַכָּתוּב וְאָמַר (שמות לג כג) \"וְרָאִיתָ אֶת אֲחֹרָי וּפָנַי לֹא יֵרָאוּ\":</p>\n<p>11\nSince it has been clarified that He does not have a body or corporeal form, it is also clear that none of the functions of the body are appropriate to Him: neither connection nor separation, neither place nor measure, neither ascent nor descent, neither right nor left, neither front nor back, neither standing nor sitting.</p>\n<p>He is not found within time, so that He would possess a beginning, an end, or age.

    "content": "# Why didn't God reveal to Job that He simply bet with Satan?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The book of Job focuses on theological and philosophical explanations of Job's (and other pious individuals') suffering. Eventually, God Himself talks to Job revealing that His thoughts and plans for human misery are far beyond possible human understanding.</p>\n<p>However, the \"prophetic\" beginning of the book speaks of a simple bet between God and Satan to test Job's faith.</p>\n<p>Why, instead of those long theological debates, doesn't God reveal the true reason for Job's suffering?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to Malbim (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_Job.36.2?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">36:2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_Job.36.16?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">16</a>ff), Elihu informs Iyov of this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עתה חוה לו הסבה האמתיית מה שגרם לו כל היסורים האלה, אשר כבר ידענו זה מן הספור הנזכר בתחלת הספר שזה היה ענין נסיון, ובאר דבר הנסיון בפרטיות,...</p>\n<p>Now [Elihu] revealed to him the true cause of all of his sufferings, which we know from the narrative at the beginning of the book: it was a test. He goes on to explain this test in detail...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודבר זה מה שהיה לך רחב בלא צוקה ושלחן מלא דשן זה הסית אותך מפי צר, ר\"ל שעי\"ז היית ירא אלהים וסר מרע, ולא היה פתחון פה להצר והשטן לקטרג עליך על רוע מעשיך, כי לא נמצא עולתה בך:\nודין, אבל באמת דין רשע מלאת כשבאו עמך לעומק הדין, בעת שבאו בני האלהים והשטן להתיצב על ה' אז מלאת דין של הרשע שהוא השטן המקטרג עליך לאמר החנם ירא איוב אלהים, כי טען עליך שיש אפשריות שתתמוטט מדרך הטוב ודין ומשפט יתמוכו, והדין והמשפט שהם מחויבים להשקיף על כל הצדדים וכל אופני המשפט, הם תמכו את דין הרשע,...</p>\n<p>The fact that you had \"broadness\" without \"anxiety,\" and a \"table full of fatness\" - this is what caused \"the enemy's mouth to be able to convince [Hashem] about you.\" Meaning that because of [your physical plenty] you were G-d-fearing and shunning evil, so that there was no opportunity for the Adversary/the Satan to accuse you of evil deeds, since no unrighteousness was found in you. \"But in judgment\": in fact \"you were filled with the judgment of the evil one\" - when they delved deeper into ultimate judgment, when the G-dly retinue and the Satan presented themselves before G-d. Then \"you were filled with the judgment of the evil one\" - the accusing Satan, who argued \"Does Iyov fear G-d without cause?\" He claimed that there is the possibility that you will fall away from goodness. \"And judgment and rectitude supported\": judgment and rectitude, which must look at all angles and all aspects of jurisprudence, supported the judgment of the evil one...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it's possible that Hashem doesn't confirm that to Iyov because it's not necessary, since Elihu had already covered it. But it's also possible that it's because, as the Malbim goes on to explain (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_Job.42.2.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">42:2</a>ff), Iyov in fact <em>did</em> pass the test: he was trying to be a \"devil's advocate\" for purposes of debate. So Elihu, not knowing that, would have thought (and says so, in Malbim's rendition) that in fact Iyov failed the test, whereas Hashem knew the truth.</p>\n\n\n",

Maimonides agreed. He felt that since G-d is good and only does good things, and since Judaism is a monotheistic religion, it is inconceivable that Satan, an evil cosmic force, should exist. Thus, Maimonides rejected the existence of Satan literally. He felt that evil was not a power but a privation. He quotes the rabbinic dictum:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Satan, the evil inclination, and the angel of death are one and the\nsame.”[1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Rambam, Satan is the personiﬁcation of a psychological power called the “evil inclination” (Hebrew: יצר הרע yetzer hara‘).[2] Rambam links the yetzer hara to the imagination, writing that “the imagination ...is the evil inclination.”[3] Since some feel that there is no such thing as the yetzer hara, an evil inclination, a being, then Rambam is correct in his interpretation. According to Rambam, \"Satan\" is a metaphor for the imagination.[4] Satan is the cause of all delusions, hallucinations, and fantasies. The term \"Satan\" is derived from the  root satoh, which means “to stray” or “to deviate.”[5] Thus, Satan is the psychological power that leads us astray from–and is–(the privation of) reason.</p>\n<p>[1] B.T. Baba Batra 16a</p>\n<p>[2] See Guide, part 3, chap. 22, 489</p>\n<p>[3] Ibid., part 2, chap. 12, 280</p>\n<p>[4] Rambam does not say whether \"Satan\" refers to the faculty of imagination or imaginary objects? It is possible that he is referring to the “privation” or “nonexistence,” which would belong to the faculty but not the intellect because it is imagined. Also, note that when the Rambam identifies the imagination with the yetzer hara he does not use the term \"mutakhayyilah,\" denoting the imaginative faculty, but \"khayy_l\" which refers to phantasm, a figment of the imagination.</p>\n<p>[5] Guide, part 3, chap. 22, 489</p>\n\n\n",

In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.61.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 61:4</a> it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עִקַּר שָׁנָיו שֶׁל אִיּוֹב לֹא הָיוּ אֶלָּא שִׁבְעִים שָׁנָה, נִתּוֹסַף לוֹ מֵאָה וְאַרְבָּעִים שָׁנָה, דִּכְתִיב (איוב מב, טז): וַיְחִי אִיּוֹב אַחֲרֵי זֹאת מֵאָה וְאַרְבָּעִים שָׁנָה</p>\n<p>\"Iyov's years was to have lasted on 70 years, 140 additional years were added, as it says (Iyov 42:16) \"And Iyov lived after this, 140 years.\"\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.57.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 57:4</a> it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי לֵוִי בְּשֵׁם רַבִּי יוֹסֵי בַּר חֲלַפְתָּא אָמַר בִּירִידָתָן לְמִצְרַיִם נוֹלַד וּבַעֲלִיָּתָן מֵת, אַתָּה מוֹצֵא עִקַּר שָׁנָיו שֶׁל אִיּוֹב לֹא הָיוּ אֶלָּא מָאתַיִם וְעֶשֶׂר שָׁנִים, וְעָשׂוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּמִצְרַיִם מָאתַיִם וְעֶשֶׂר שָׁנִים וּבָא שָׂטָן לְקַטְרֵג וְגֵרָה אוֹתוֹ בְּאִיּוֹב</p>\n<p>\"Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Yosi son of Chalafta said, he was born when they (the Bnei Yisrael) went down to Egypt, and died when they went up (from Egypt), so you find that the lifetime of Iyov was only 210 years, and the Bnei Yisrael were in Egypt for 210 years, and the Satan came to prosecute and directed it on to Iyov\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This all fits very nicely, and is further corroborated by the fact that he served in the council of Pharoah's court (refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.11a.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 11a</a> & <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.12.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos Rabbah 12:2</a>)</p>\n<p>So it would seem that there is quite a lot of evidence to demonstrate that he lived throughout this period (i.e. during the Bnei Yisrael's time in Egypt, which would include him being around the time of Yaakov and the bros, and thus marrying Dina etc.). So two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why are such a divergent range of opinions suggested?</li>\n<li>How can we account for these other opinions that he lived in a much later period e.g. in the days of Achashveirosh, Sheba and the Chaldeans specifically?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do any sources make sense of this?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.15b.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gemara</a> suggests that he married Dina which would fit this bracket</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.1.15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 1:15</a></p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.1.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 1:17</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the book \"Iyov - As He Is\" (איוב - כמו שהוא), <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%9C_%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rachel Margulies</a> presents an enormous amount of evidence that Iyov is an ancient book from before the Exodus.

The cans are then sent to be cooked in a retort. (A retort is a large pressure cooker filled with water.) This process kills the bacteria that cause food spoilage, allowing for the canned vegetable to be stored for long periods and remain fresh. At the end of the cooking process, the cans are cooled with cold water, dried, and labeled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It appears, then, that the food inside the can never comes in contact with the water in the \"retort.\"</p>\n<p>Later, the article expresses a concern that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, there are very large retorts that can process two products simultaneously and a plain vegetable product can be cooked at the same time as a pork and bean product. Even if they are processed in separate retorts, often the water used for heating or cooling the product is recycled between the lines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But if the cans are sealed, why would that have any impact on the status on the water outside the can? Can water be milchig, fleishig or treif even when it has only been in contact with the outside of a package. Is there some other status (eg. \"water that was used in the preparation of treif cannot be used for something kosher even though the water is not trief\")? [secondarily, if, hypothetically, some actual treif got into the water, could one then not use that water for boiling sealed cans of kosher food?]</p>\n<p>Is there, then, any other limitations on the use of this water for other purposes?</p>\n<p>Is this impact on the water because there is only a single layer between the food and the water and not a double layer (I'm thinking of the \"<a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/32795\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">double</a> wrapping\" that I have heard discussed when cooking kosher food in a non-kosher oven).</p>\n<p>Side note -- I sent this question as a letter to the editor of the magazine and have not received any acknowledgment or response.</p>\n\n\n",

I checked an Eshkol edition, and it had the same difference. The concordance lists multiple occurrences of both versions too. Shouldn't it be the same?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As noted by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.29.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Bereishit 29:6</a>, when the stress is on the penultimate syllable, the word is in the third person feminine singular perfect (past) tense, \"it came\". When the stress is on the final syllable, it is a (present tense) feminine singular participle, \"is coming\".</p>\n<p>So it seems that ArtScroll are translating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בֹּרִית כַּרְשִׁינָה לָמָה הִיא בָֽאָה</p>\n<p>Carshina lye, for what purpose did it come?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַחַת לְשִׁשִּׁים אוֹ לְשִׁבְעִים שָׁנָה הָיְתָה בָאָה שֶׁל שִׁירַֽיִם לַחֲצָאִין</p>\n<p>Once every sixty or seventy years the leftovers would be coming as half [of the required amount].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, it's entirely possible that ArtScroll is mistaken and that the former instance is also supposed to be a feminine singular present participle with the stress on the final syllable. This would then read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Carshina lye, for what purpose does it come?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The parallel sentence יין קפריסים למה הוא בא doesn't help us decide: בא is even more ambiguous than באה with no way to tell apart the third person masculine singular perfect from the masculine singular participle.)</p>\n\n\n",

The process of <em>teshuva</em> only nullifies the sin but does not heal these wounds, which remain open. One requires to lay the pitch so to speak, as Noach pitched the Ark's cracks, slots, crevices, etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>They are similar in that they are different inflections of the same root, כפר.

    "content": "# תתאה גבר in space\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On earth the rule is that תתאה גבר, if kosher and not kosher mix in a hot application, it depends which is “תתאה” bottom. If the hot is bottom it’s all forbidden, if the top is hot than it’s only forbidden through the “peel”. How does the rule of תתאה גבר apply in deep space where there effectively 0 gravity. If I had a hot piece of meat floating stationary in space and shook a pot of cold milk at it. Is the meat considered תתאה and so it’s totally forbidden or is the milk and so you would only have to remove a “peel”? Or is there some third option?\n<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.91.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sefaria link to rule of תתאה גבר </a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From my understanding, תתאה גבר is not necessarily the one that is on the bottom, even though that's what the words literally mean. It is more the vessel that was poured FROM to the vessel it is poured INTO.</p>\n<p>According to Tosfot in Shabbos 145, it says that the whole point of a Kli Sheini (Kli Sheini is relevant because the Rashbam learns that עירוי כלי ראשון is considered Kli Sheini from the Gemara in Pesachim that talks about תתאה גבר.) is that it reaches the walls of the cooler vessel and cools off the liquid. (Only a liquid as opposed to a solid - דבר גוש because a solid does not fill the shape of the Kli Sheini vessel in order to touch the walls and cool down. (ש״ך/ביאור הגר״א quoting the ים של שלמה)</p>\n<p>As for in space, I don't know how it would work. Would the liquid even fill the entire vessel and touch the walls at all? It probably wouldn't even leave the first vessel unless you pushed it somehow into the second vessel. Would heat dissipate the same way in space as it does on earth?</p>\n<p>All valid questions. It's very interesting to think of.</p>\n\n\n",

To emphasize that Joseph was <strong>NOT purchased for the purpose of serving as Potiphar's wife's concubine.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Another classic example is Exodus 20:20.\nלֹ֥א תַעֲשׂ֖וּן אִתִּ֑י אֱלֹ֤הֵי כֶ֙סֶף֙ וֵאלֹהֵ֣י זָהָ֔ב לֹ֥א תַעֲשׂ֖וּ לָכֶֽם׃</p>\n<p>The translation when factoring cantillation is \"Do not do such with Me; a god of silver or a god of gold do not make for yourselves.\" Without cantillation, then the Hebrew itself would suggest by parallelism \"Do not make alongside Me a god of silver; and a god of gold do not make for yourselves.\" But the etnaḥta on אִתִּ֑י makes that reading impossible.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Sorry if this isn't exactly what you were looking for! One which might be a better fit is Genesis 25:23 — וְרַ֖ב יַעֲבֹ֥ד צָעִֽיר׃. Because of the syntactic looseness of Hebrew, the prophecy could be read as \"the older will serve the younger\" or as \"the older the younger will serve.\" The rabbis realized this in their well-known midrash that suggested that at any point in history either Jacob or Esau is dominant.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm not sure what the person who wrote that article had in mind, but the following summarized point he writes in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21620&pgnum=22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Toras Moshe</strong></a> (top right corner). I find to be quite powerful:</p>\n<p>One could ask why it’s even a fast day. Nothing significant seemingly happened on that day. Sure, the Babylonian King began his siege on Jerusalem. But there wasn’t any physical damage. Nothing was destroyed. No walls were breached. Why is it designated as a fast? Especially compared to Tisha B’Av, which was the actual destruction. If that day doesn’t push aside Shabbos, why would Asarah BaTeves? Furthermore, Jerusalem was under siege many times throughout history. What was significant about this siege?</p>\n<p>What made this siege different was its significance to the eventual destruction. The day that the siege took place was the day that the Heavenly Court decreed the destruction of Jerusalem. We are taught that every year that the Temple isn’t rebuilt, it’s as if it was destroyed anew (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/94062/1739\">see here</a>). That means that each year on Asarah BaTeves, there’s another court case in Heaven. If the Temple won’t be rebuilt that year, that decree will be made on Asarah BaTeves.</p>\n<p>Most fasts are in commemoration of some past tragedy. Some people fast on the yartzheit’s of their parents. Tisha B’Av commemorates the destruction of Jerusalem. These types of fasts don’t override Shabbos. However, one fast that is permitted is a <em>Ta’anis Chalom</em>. When a person has a bad dream, sometimes they're concerned it's a sign that something bad will happen to them. <em>Chazal</em> said to fast in such a situation (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.11a.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 11a</a>), even on Shabbos. The reason this is permissible is because fasting that day would give the person pleasure (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A4%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur Orach Chaim § 288</a>). By fasting, their hope and prayer is they will annul any future calamity that may come upon them. The prospect of that occurring gives great pleasure. Therefore, fasting is not considered neglecting the obligation to delight on Shabbos.</p>\n<p>The same is true with Asarah BaTeves<sup>1</sup>. We fast as a hope and prayer that this Asarah BaTeves will create a ruling in Heaven that the Temple will be rebuilt. We hope that there won’t be another destruction. This gives the greatest pleasure. It’s no wonder then that the fast could occur even on Shabbos.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Worth noting is that in <strong>Chiddushei Rav Chaim Al HaShas</strong> <em>Rosh Hashanah</em> § 44, he also justifies the <strong>Abudraham</strong> by comparing this fast to a <em>Ta'anis Chalom</em>. However, he doesn't point out that they both fulfill <em>oneg shabbos</em>, which is most of the justification.</p>\n\n\n",

Many read this word and assume it is G-d’s name, but this is mistaken. The term Y-h-v-h, “the Tetragrammaton,” is a description of how G-d acts (see Exodus 3:14). So why did G-d reveals Himself as El Shaddai but not y-h-v-h? Nachmanides offers a possible solution.</p>\n<p>According to Nachmanides, there exist not only open miracles, like the parting of the Sea of Reeds, which is evident, but also hidden miracles that occur daily. For example, falling leaves, rain, and snow, because G-d is the source for every fall of each leaf, rain drop, or snowflake. He writes that this is the “greatest secret” of the Torah. Nachmanides understood G-d to be saying that He supplied the patriarchs with hidden miracles but He will now save Israel from Egypt with open miracles that disrupt the current establishment of the world so that everyone will know that G-d saved the Israelites from slavery.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.25a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.25a?lang=bi</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא מאי תדירא תדירא בשכינה דאריב\"ל בואו ונחזיק טובה לאבותינו שהודיעו\nמקום תפלה דכתיב (נחמיה ט, ו) וצבא השמים לך משתחוים</p>\n<p>Rather, what is the meaning of frequent?

This indicates that Your messengers are\nnot like the messengers of flesh and blood. The messengers of flesh\nand blood return to the place from where they were sent to report on\ntheir mission. But Your messengers return and report on their mission\nfrom the very same place to which they are sent, as it is stated “Can\nyou send forth lightnings, that they may go out and say to you: Here\nwe are?” (Job 38:35). The verse does not state: They will come and\nsay, i.e., they do not return to their point of departure, but: “They\nmay go out and say,” which teaches that the Divine Presence is found\nin every place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the gemara, the <em>passuk</em> comes to define the \"place\" of the <em>shechinah</em>.</p>\n<p>Therefore the reference to Hashem in the beginning of the <em>passuk</em> seems to be a general statement that is refined by the following references.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אַתָּה־ה֣וּא ה֘ לְבַדֶּךָ֒</strong>, אַתָּ֣ה עָשִׂ֡יתָ אֶֽת־הַשָּׁמַיִם֩ שְׁמֵ֨י הַשָּׁמַ֜יִם וְכָל־צְבָאָ֗ם הָאָ֜רֶץ וְכָל־אֲשֶׁ֤ר עָלֶ֙יהָ֙ הַיַּמִּים֙ וְכָל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר בָּהֶ֔ם וְאַתָּ֖ה מְחַיֶּ֣ה אֶת־כֻּלָּ֑ם וּצְבָ֥א הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם לְךָ֥ מִשְׁתַּחֲוִֽים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Looking at the verse in its entirety I believe there's a figurative element to the language, attributing <em>the [act of] creation to</em> G-d alone, rather than the designation’YHWH’, as is suggested by the English translation.</p>\n<p>I would offer a slightly less literal translation of the verse:</p>\n<p><strong>Thou alone, YHWH</strong>, [Art Who] hast made the heavens, the highest heavens, and all its hosts, etc.</p>\n\n\n",

Tosafos reasons that it must have been that they didn't traverse the sea along its width, as if so, they would have hurried into Eretz Yisroel. Rather they must have followed a strip of the sea travelling along its length until they were facing the desert to one side, since otherwise they couldn't go on either side if the sea did not pass and the Egyptians had them on their right and on their left. As such, they had to travel along one stretch until they were facing the desert from one side.</p>\n<p>Now we can understand why they had a moment of doubt. As they were coming from one side, they thought the Egyptians would inevitably meet them from the other side.</p>\n<p>If one analyses their travels - they journeyed from Marah and then camped by the Yam Suf. If they traversed the width of the sea until they passed to the other side how then could they have been hit by the Egyptians, thus we have to conclude that if they travelled along the length they would come out facing southwards of Egypt as Egypt was South of Israel, and to the west of the River Nile which separated Egypt and Israel. The sea would consequently be on the southern side of Egypt heading from east to west, and they travelled along the shore from the north which was south of Egypt. The trajectory was therefore a semi-circle, as they  went out on their north side which is south of the land of Edom and east of the land of Egypt. They subsequently travelled a few days until Marah after which they were still by the sea meaning that when they needed to enter the land of Israel they no longer need to pass the sea but rather encircle the land of Edom and Moav which was in the south of Israel and east of Egypt.</p>\n<p>The diagram provided on the daf spells out their trajectory clearer (than I probably did!):\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HIwZD.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HIwZD.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

But in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.110.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">posuk 5</a> the text reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲדֹנָ֥י עַל־יְמִֽינְךָ֑ מָחַ֖ץ בְּיוֹם־אַפּ֣וֹ מְלָכִֽים׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The translations I see view this as a statement that Hashem is on the right hand of someone (\"The Lord is at your right hand\" from Sefaria and \"The Lord, on your right hand,\" from Chabad). This brings up 2 questions:</p>\n<p>On whose right hand is Hashem? The opening posuk has Hashem speak to the \"master\" telling him to sit at Hashem's right hand. This would put Hashem at the LEFT hand of that person. The answer I have seen is that this is not talking about the same scene - but is a reference to a separate battle scene when Hashem is at the the right hand (metaphorically) of David (or, I guess, Avraham). Is that the prevailing explanation?</p>\n<p>But then why, in posuk 5, is Hashem referred to by the actual spelling of the word a-d-n-y and not the 4 letter name (which distinguished him from the master in posuk 1) which we would pronounce Ad-o-niy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Artscroll%20tanach%20series%20-%20%20tehillim&sxsrf=ALeKk00U59yfXKIl4w6mhw7OM_8c57hlYQ:1609025870124&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX5rC76OztAhWJTsAKHd5KDh8Q_AUoAnoECAgQBA&biw=1536&bih=775#imgrc=kqSlRN8xXAC10M\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Artscroll Tanach Series on Tehillim</a> Vol. 2 (Mesorah Publications - p.1343) it writes the following commentary on posuk 5:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲדֹנָ֥י עַל־יְמִֽינְךָ֑ - <em>My Lord is at your right</em></p>\n<p>Previously (verse 1), Abraham is described as sitting at G-d's right hand, with G-d therefore, at Abraham's left.

Consequently, a ladder whose foot is in Beer-sheba and whose top is in Beth-el-the middle of its slant is opposite Jerusalem. This accords with what our Sages said, that the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “This righteous man has come to My lodging place [i.e., the Temple Mount]. Shall he leave without lodging?” And furthermore, they said: Jacob called Jerusalem Beth-el. But this place [which he called Beth-el] was Luz, and not Jerusalem. So, from where did they learn to say this? [i.e., that Luz was Jerusalem.] I believe that Mount Moriah was uprooted from its place, and it came here, [to Luz, i.e., at that time, Luz, Jerusalem and Beth-el were all in the same place], and this is the “springing of the earth” mentioned in Tractate Chullin, i.e., that the [site of the] Temple came towards him until Beth-el. This is the meaning of ויפגע במקום “And he met the place.” Now if you ask, “When Jacob passed by the Temple, why did He not detain him there?” [The answer is:] If he did not put his mind to pray in the place where his forefathers had prayed, should they detain him from heaven? He went as far as Haran, as it is stated in the chapter entitled, “Gid HaNasheh” (Hullin 91b), and the text, “and he went to Haran” (verse 10) supports this. When he arrived in Haran, he said, “Is it possible that I have passed the place where my forefathers prayed, and I did not pray there?” He decided to return, and he went back as far as Beth-El, and the earth “sprang toward him.” [This Beth-El is not the one near Ai, but the one near Jerusalem, and because it was the city of God, he called it Beth-El, the house of God, and that is Mount Moriah where Abraham prayed, and that is the field where Isaac prayed, and so did they say in Sotah (sic.) (Pes.88a) [concerning the verse] (Micah 4:2):“Come, let us go up to the Mount of the Lord, to the House of God of Jacob.” [It is] not [called] as did Abraham, who called it a mountain, and not as did Isaac, who called it a field, but as did Jacob, who called it the House of God.

If Yosef and his children were counted why not Osnas?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>A¹ according to the Tur on Torah you can say Asnas was the 70th.\nA² according to chachmei Tzarfas and Chizkuni in parshas Emor by the ger you can say since Asnas father was Shchem therefore she wasn't Jewish or related to Dina.\nA³ according to the Moshav Zikeinim she wouldn't be listed because the count doesn't include the wives of the children of Yakov.\nA⁴ according to the Taima Dikra that Serach bas Asher was really the daughter of Ashers wife and reason she's counted is because since Asher raised her it's as if he gave birth to her. Can say since Potifar raised Asnas she's considered his daughter and not Dinas.\nA⁵ according to the Pirkei Drav Eliezer Asnas went to Egypt just to marry Yosef, so one can say she's not counted since didn't go to Egypt because of the shibud or slavery.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think she is counted, just not expressly for the same reason she is never expressly described as Dinah's daughter--the story of her conception is an embarrassment to her mother.</p>\n<p>We all know the question that if you count the names of Yaakov's family there are only 69 names. There are two primary answers to this question in the Rishonim: 1) Rashi, quoting the Gemara, says that <strong>the 70th is Yocheved</strong>; 2) the Ramban and Ibn Ezra say that <strong>the 70th is Yakov himself</strong>.  Each of this answers has weaknesses.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Yocheved as the 70th</strong></p>\n<p>A) If Yocheved is the 70th, why not say her name expressly? Pesukim elsewhere expressly say she was the daughter of Levi (Bamidbar 26:59; Shemos 6:20).</p>\n<p>B) If Yocheved is the 70th, she gave birth to Miriam when she was 125, Aharon at 127, and Moshe at 130. Why is this incredible miracle not mentioned in the posuk?</p>\n<p><strong>2. Yaakov as the 70th</strong></p>\n<p>A) Yaakov makes sense if one only looks at the end of the parsha because he is not יֹצְאֵ֣י יְרֵכ֔וֹ and therefore not part of the 66 that went down (Bereishis 46:26) but is part of כָּל־הַנֶּ֧פֶשׁ לְבֵֽית־יַעֲקֹ֛ב (Bereishis 46:27). But that count isn't the only issue. By the count of the children of Leah it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵ֣לֶּה ׀ בְּנֵ֣י לֵאָ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָֽלְדָ֤ה לְיַעֲקֹב֙ בְּפַדַּ֣ן\nאֲרָ֔ם וְאֵ֖ת דִּינָ֣ה בִתּ֑וֹ כָּל־נֶ֧פֶשׁ בָּנָ֛יו וּבְנוֹתָ֖יו\nשְׁלֹשִׁ֥ים וְשָׁלֹֽשׁ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are the children of Leah that she bore to Yaakov in Padan Aram\nand with Dinah her daughter all the souls of his sons and daughters,\n33.\n(Bereishis 46:15)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But if you count the names of Leah's children there are only 32, not 33. Yocheved fits as she was a daughter of Levi. But how can Yaakov himself be counted as one of his children from Leah?</p>\n<p>So we need another option that fits with all of the pesukim.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Osnas as the 70th</strong></p>\n<p>Counting Osnas as the 70th member of Yaakov's family explains all of the pesukim. Osnas is not mentioned expressly because of the embarrassing circumstances of her conception and adoption. She is counted among the children of Leah in Bereshis 46:15 because she is daughter of Dina. She is not counted among the 66 that went down in Bereishis 46:26 because she was already in Egypt. But she is counted in Bereishis 46:27 as part of the 70 just like her husband and her husband, Yosef, and her sons.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Not ignoring the previous answers, but just adding a thought <em>al pi drush</em>.</p>\n<p>The sefer Chesed Shmuel (I think it is) says that it was only permissible for Yosef to marry Osnas because he was in <em>chutz la'aretz</em> (using the same logic that it was only permissible for Yaakov to marry sisters because he was in <em>chutz la'aretz</em>.</p>\n<p>Therefore you could not possibly say that Osnas was one of the 70 who came to <em>Mitzrayim</em>, because to the extent she was <em>shayach</em> to <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> she was forbidden to Yosef.</p>\n\n\n",

It also ensured that their loyalty was to Par'o who \"gave\" them their new land and now <em>owned</em> the entire country. They also regarded the land that they were settled on as Pharaoh's unlike the land that that had lest which they would have considered their own and would have resented what was taken for taxes.</p>\n<p>Note also that when the government takes money or possessions as tax, the tax income is regarded as belonging to the government and not the people.

The whole land had become\nstate property, and to make this newly acquired right completely\nactual, every owner had to leave property that had hitherto been his\nown and movedto another district, so that a general evacuation took\nplace. But Joseph's wisdom tempered the edict by arranging that the\nresidents who had always lived together remained together and found\nthemselves still together with their friends but only in a new\nenvironment. So that the old social and communal conditions remained\nthe same, and there was no complete upheaval by the change. Our sages\npoint out that the beneficial result that this transposition of all\nthe inhabitants must have had for the new arrivals, the family of\nJacob, to whom no Egyptian could look down with disdain an newcomers.\nFor no Egyptian was an \"old inhabitant\" on his native hearth. The\nwhole measure, moreover, was no invention of Joseph's. The people\nthemselves had proposed it, v. 19, and indeed, at the same time actual\nbondage.

I don't have one but there is one in shul and I looked it up again for you. I will try my best to remember the sources, but the gist I should remember.</p>\n<p>Firstly, it states there that Joseph's job was to consolidate as much power for Pharoah as possible, i.e. that was his job and his charge (there was a quote mentioned where Joseph is saying something akin to \"I would give this away to you, but I am not given permission [by Pharoah] to do that, you must buy it\". He did a stellar job. He appears to have done so without forcing anyone to do anything. He originally bought all the grain required for the upcoming 7 years, and then sold it back. There's no indication of what we would call, nowadays, \"scalping\", meaning now that he had all the grain he would sell it at crazy prices. He seems to have just bought low (when there was a lot of supply) and sold high (when there was a lot of demand). When people couldn't afford it, he offered to sell it in exchange for other things, and that's how he got all the land.</p>\n<p>The Stone Edition quotes Rabbi Munk as stating that there have been many famines in ancient Egypt, and generally resulting in mass death, with the land being dubbed a \"land of corpses\". Joseph's wisdom saved the country.</p>\n<p>It also states that he did not enslave anyone. He deliberately didn't want to, even though they offered. IIRC the quoted sources for this are HaEmek Davar and Malbim. I can't remember the reasoning, sorry!</p>\n<p>It also states that when it came to the population moving, for ethical reasons, he deliberately moved \"communities\" (the Stone Edition claims this is obvious from the pasuk itself and doesn't quote a source). Unlike the historic population relocation terror tactic used by countless conquerors (iirc started with Assyrian king Tiglaph Pilesar I?), Joseph avoided splitting up families and communities to avoid the \"terror\" aspect. The reason he did move everyone was because they had sold their land, and he didn't want them to retain attachment to it. It didn't explain the significance of this but I will imagine it is to prevent future rebellions. I believe this was sourced in Rashi, and many other commentaries.</p>\n<p>Edit: I just saw this was mentioned in sabbahillel's answer by Rav Hirsch.</p>\n<p>If anyone does have the Stone Edition, feel free to edit my post and sharpen it up.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As noted in the comment by @Meir, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.41.55?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Bereshis 41:55</a> references the midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.91.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 91:5</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another matter: “Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt.” It is written: “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him, but blessing will be on the head of the provider” (Proverbs 11:26). “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him” – this is Pharaoh; “but blessing will be on the head of the provider – this is Joseph. “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him” – this is Pharaoh, who hoarded the grain during the years of famine, and the people were cursing him. But Joseph sustained the world during the years of famine, like a shepherd leading his flock.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The midrash thus tells that accumulation of grain, property, and everything else was the intention of pharaoh. Yosef, on the other hand was looking for ways to sustain and save the people, even though the pharaoh profited from it. Yosef bought grain from people when prices were depressed. The value of grain significantly appreciate during famine compared to years of plenty, and this is why people quickly used all the money. To save the grain Yosef built special storage houses, which withstood rotting and infestation, which addded to the cost of bread. This answers questions 1 and 2.</p>\n<p>Question 3 has been dealt by @RabbiKaii and @SabaHillel, but should be understood in the same way. During famine it was dangerous to keep people in the countryside so he brought them to the cities near storage houses.</p>\n\n\n",

Though he was acting under divine command and in the interest of the nation, he still was not allowed to undertake this task. Solomon was given that responsibility and he ultimately completed it.</p>\n<p><strong>My question relates to the reasoning for David's inability to build the temple.</strong></p>\n<p>In the event that we did decide to build the third temple, would the issue of bloodshed or other impurities come up in the vetting of those who would build the temple?</p>\n<p>My assumption is that some level of ritual purity \"standard\" would need to exist. What that standard is and how we would come to a determination for who does or doesn't qualify is beyond my knowledge.

However, wherever possible, the mitzva is for these tasks to be performed by priests. If no priests are available, Levites enter; if no Levites are available, Israelites enter. In both cases, if they are ritually pure, yes, they may enter, but if they are impure, no, they may not enter the holy place. Rav Huna said: Rav Kahana, who was a priest, supports priests by emphasizing their special sanctity. As Rav Kahana taught in a baraita: Since it is stated with regard to a priest who has a physical blemish, “Only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come near to the altar, because he has a blemish, that he profane not My holy places; for I am the Lord who sanctifies them” (Leviticus 21:23), I might have thought that priests with blemishes may not enter the area between the Entrance Hall and the altar to manufacture beaten plates of gold for the Holy of Holies. Therefore, the verse teaches “only” as an expression of exclusion, which means that there is a distinction here: Although the mitzva should be performed with unblemished priests ab initio, if no unblemished priests are available, blemished ones may enter. Likewise, it is the duty of ritually pure priests; if no pure priests are available, impure ones may enter. In both cases, if they are priests, yes, they may enter, but if they are Israelites, no, they may not enter the holy place. According to Rav Kahana, ritually impure priests take precedence over ritually pure Israelites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize, preferably only ritually pure unblemished cohanim should do the building, but if they are unavailable, leviim or yisraelim, even those who are not ritually pure, may build.</p>\n<p>Codified by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Chosen_Temple.7.23?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<ol>\n<li>While Kind David was prevented from building the first Temple because <em>he had shed much blood</em>, it had nothing to do with impurity (Tum'ah).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How do I know this?</p>\n<p>Firstly, King David wasn't planning on becoming a builder.

He said to the woman, “Did God really say: You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly, the Provencal Rabbi, biblical commentator, grammarian and philosopher, Radak (Rabbi Dovid Kimche) makes the following grammatical analysis <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Genesis.3.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and notes a difference in the two words which is why they have separate meanings:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>היה ערום - clever</strong>: Seeing that the word refers to intelligence, <strong>it is spelled with the vowel shuruk to distinguish it from the adjective arum naked, which is spelled with the vowel cholam</strong>. [in our editions of the Torah both words are spelled with the letter shuruk representing the vowel shuruk. Ed.] Seeing the word occurs in the plural, the letter מ does not have a dagesh, compare מחשבות ערומים in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.5.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Job 5:12</a> where it means :“the designs of the crafty ones.” When the word is used to described nudity, the letter מ is written with a dagesh.

Our sages generally describe the fox as crafty, able to scheme, something other animals are not credited with doing. (Berachot 61) This is not the same as possessing didactic intelligence, something reserved for man. When the Torah adds the words מכל חית השדה, it excludes the domestic animals, בהמות as not possessing even a modicum of such powers of imagination, The serpent at that time was superior to the fox in its ability to scheme. אשר עשה ה' אלוקים, even though all these creatures had been constructed out of the same raw material, G-d had given added an advantage to different ones of these creatures. Some had been granted greater physical prowess, others greater power to scheme.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Sefaria translation)</p>\n\n\n",

In this case, the source <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.100.9?lang=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereishit Rabba 100:9</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְלֹא עוֹד אֶלָּא עַד שֶׁלֹא יְרַדְתֶּם לְכָאן הָיוּ קוֹרְאִים אוֹתִי עֶבֶד וּמֵאַחַר שֶׁיְּרַדְתֶּם לְכָאן הוֹדַעְתִּי הוֹגְנוֹסִים שֶׁלִּי, אִם כֵּן אֲנִי הוֹרֵג אֶתְכֶם, אֶתְמְהָא, אִם הוֹרֵג אֲנִי אֶתְכֶם הֵם אוֹמְרִין אֵין לִשְׁמֹר אֲמָנָה עִם זֶה, עִם אֶחָיו לֹא שָׁמַר אֲמָנָה עִם מִי הוּא מְשַׁמֵּר אֲמָנָה. הֵן אוֹמְרִין לֹא הָיוּ אֶחָיו, אֶלָּא כַּתְּ שֶׁל בַּחוּרִים רָאָה וְקָרָא אוֹתָן אֶחָיו, תֵּדַע לָךְ שֶׁהֲרֵי הוּא בַּסּוֹף הֵבִיא עֲלֵיהֶן עִלָּה וַהֲרָגָן.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There in the midrash, Yosef presents two arguments. First, that the Egyptians would say that one could not trust Yosef, because he was not able to keep faith with his brothers, all the more so with others. And further, the Egyptians would say that these were not truly Yosef's brothers, but a group of fine men whom he called his brothers (to remove the stain of being a slave), and as evidence, see that in the end, he found a provocation with them and slew them.</p>\n<p>In that source, it is not stated that brother doesn't slay brother. Rashi is reinforcing this implicit idea, to say that his killing them would be evidence that they were never truly his brothers.</p>\n<p>The idea is a sort of application of Occam's Razor. Of course brothers sometimes kill one another. But if you didn't fully establish in the first place that these were really brothers, and then he eventually slew them, the more likely possibility (or, at the least, a strong possibility) is that he never was their brother in the first place, because he did not act to them like a typical brother.</p>\n\n\n",

The <em>gemarra</em> suggests throwing the animal limbs on the altar (הקטרה), but rejects that because the <em>gemarra</em> is discussing Rabbi Yossi, who holds that burning a fire on Shabbos (הבערה) isn't a bona fide Shabbos violation that results in <em>kares</em>/an obligation for an offering. Rather, it's simply a prohibition worthy of lashes. The <em>gemarra</em> therefore suggests something else.</p>\n<p>I was very bothered that why isn't הקטרה considered the Shabbos prohibition of cooking? The meat gets cooked in the altar fire.

Rabbi Yehudah says that הקטרה is the prohibition of burning a fire on Shabbos, and Rabbi Yossi holds הקטרה is the prohibition of cooking. They seem to be arguing if something I want to get cooked but not eat is the violation of cooking on Shabbos, but I could be misunderstanding.</p>\n<p>Why didn't the <em>Bavli gemarra</em> say this as well?

M. Grintz</a> in his book פרקים בתולדות בית שני (Chapters in the History of the Second Temple), p. 36. He pointed out that in the first three generations after Shimon Ha'tzaddik, there was always an instance of one sage being from outside of the Land of Yehudah:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Antignos from Socho in the Galilee<sup>1</sup></li>\n<li>Yosei ben Yoezer from Tzredah in the Shomron</li>\n<li>Nitai Ha'arbeli from Arbel in the Galilee</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Grintz noted that there was likely no shortage of great sages in Yehudah, but there was a particular need for a leader from outside of Yehudah: Prior to the mid-Chashmonaim period, Yehudah, the Galilee and Shomron were separate provinces, first during the Persian period and then during the Hellenistic period. It seems, therefore, that to properly govern the Jews of northern Israel there was need in the Sanhedrin for a sage who was intimately familiar with the going-ons of that area.</p>\n<p>I will add that in later sources we find many differences between the halacha of Yehudah and the halacha of the Galilee (and, on occasion, also the halacha of Shomron and the halacha of Ever Hayarden), further necessitating deep familiarity with the conditions and reality of those areas.</p>\n<p>As for why this was only established in the Hellenistic period and not prior, Grintz noted that Ezra was given legal jurisdiction over the entirety of the Ever Ha'nahar province (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezra.7.25?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezra 7:25</a>), so it seems that a centralized legal-halachic administration in Yerushalayim with smaller localized offshoots was enough at the time, even if politically the area was divided into separate sub-provinces (such as Yehud, Shamarin, Pleshet and more). This changed with the Macedonian conquest which took place during the days of Shimon Hatzaddik. No longer having full authority over the various provinces necessitated reshaping the Sanhedrin.</p>\n<p>We don't know enough about later Zugot to know whether this model was continued after the time of Yehoshua ben Perachyah and Nitai Ha'arbeli. The northern/southern unity may have been deemd by then no longer necessary because of the conquests of Yochanan Hyrcanus and Alexander Yannai of most of the rest of Eretz Yisrael, once again allowing for a more centralized halachic government. At this point the Zugot model may have continued simply because it had become traditional, but this is only personal speculation.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>In my opinion, the model became necessary once again during the post-Herodian Roman period, circa the time of Rabban Gamliel I, when Judea, Samaria and the Galilee were separate provinces. However, it doesn't seem that there was a separate Av Beit Din during his time (although Akavyah ben Mahallalel appears to have been a contender according to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Eduyot.5.6?ven=hebrew%7CMishnah_based_on_the_Kaufmann_manuscript,_edited_by_Dan_Be%27eri&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Eduyot 5:6</a>), nor during the time of his father, Shimon ben Hillel. It's possible that Rabban Gamliel was familiar enough with the special circumstances of the north to manage to halachically lead the entire country properly. This might be hinted by his ties with the people of the north (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Shabbat.14.2?vhe=Tosefta_Shabbat&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Shabbat 14:2</a>: Rabbi Chalafta, a Galilean sage, testifies to having met Rabban Gamliel in Yerushalayim). In any case, it seems that the model was essentially resurrected in the time of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel I, whose Av Beit Din was Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai, who had previously lived for 18 years in the Galilee (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Shabbat.16.7?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&qh=%D7%91%D7%9F%20%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%90%D7%99%20%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Shabbat 16:7</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Shabbat.22.3?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&qh=%D7%91%D7%9F%20%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%90%D7%99%20%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Shabbat 22:3</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.16.8.4?vhe=The_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Shabbat 16:8</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.34b.28?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bavli Brachot 34b</a>). However, by this time the model was no longer known by the term \"Zugot\". It's possible that there were some key differences between the two stages of the model, further clarifying why the term \"Zugot\" no longer described the model, but lacking enough information regarding the time of the Zugot, it's difficult to say. The usefulness of Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai's appointment seems most evident in an epistle sent by the two to the people of the Galilee regarding ma'asrot (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33216&pgnum=183\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tannaim Devarim 26:13</a>). Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai being a more familiar figure to the people of the Galilee might have elicited a more positive response from them.</p>\n<p>After the Churban, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai did not appoint a northern Av Beit Din as a partner. In a paper I wrote once for a class in university, I argued, based on many sources (too many to bring here) that Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai believed that in the post-Revolt era there was a necessity for a decentralized halachic authoritative model, as so many different areas of the land needed strong, supportive leaders to help get back up on their feet. So we find that most sages were spread across the land. It was only in the time of Rabban Gamliel II that the model became more centralized once again, and he seems to have appointed the northern sage Rabbi Tzaddok to be his right-hand man (quite literally, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Sanhedrin.8.1?vhe=Tosefta_Sanhedrin_-_Machon_Mamre&qh=%D7%A6%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A7%20%D7%92%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Sanhedrin 8:1</a>; many other sources establish that Rabban Gamliel greatly respected Rabbi Tzaddok). However, by this time there were more batei midrash around the land, and Rabban Gamliel II was also known for travelling around the land and the world, checking up on various Jewish communities, as well as meeting non-Jewish leaders, so the model was apparently no longer necessary.</p>\n<p>In short, essentially, the Zugot model was deemed necessary when there were difficulties in having a centralized halachic administration governing the whole of Eretz Yisrael. The Zugot model fell out of use largely during times it was no longer needed. There are some specific periods where it seems the model was at least partially resurrected, and then it fell out of use once again.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Not officially a member of a Zug according to known Chazalic sources, but <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rambam_Introduction_to_the_Mishnah.23.2?vhe=Vilna_Edition&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">according to the Rambam</a>, a close associate of his was Rabbi Elazar ben Charsom, who was both <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.9a.5?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=he&with=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Kohen Gadol of the time</a> and had a large estate in Har Ha'melech in Yehudah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eikhah_Rabbah.2.4?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eicha Rabbah 2:4</a>) and was deeply involved in the politics of Yehudah (see partial summary <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/120551/the-rabbis-of-the-septuagint/121508#121508\">here</a>, and for more information, see Chaim Chefetz's article referenced there).</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Interestingly, a 14th century version of Toledot Yeshu refers to Shimon ben Shetach as the head of the Beit Midrash Ha'gadol in Teverya, an institution known mainly from late 2nd century CE sources and onwards.

However, most sources attest that RYB\"Z's main period of activity was during the final decades of the Second Temple period and the first decades of the post-Churban period.

Up to that point the Kohen Gadol had been responsible for internal and external governmental affairs, including collecting taxes on behalf of the ruling power. But now that he had abdicated that responsibility to ben Toviah and his cronies, the Sages found it necessary to create a new position, from within the Torah leadership, to assume those functions.</p>\n<p>To quote R' Avigdor Miller zt\"l's paraphrase (<em>Torah Nation</em>, par. 246):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because of the disturbed conditions, the Sanhedrin now took the step of instituting the new office of Nasi. They had seen how the Cohen Gadol had allowed his impious nephew to gain power in the land, and they feared that he could no longer be entrusted with the authority which had hitherto been invested in the high-priesthood. They therefore now decided to transfer to a Nasi those duties which had formerly been discharged by the Cohen Gadol but which were now being neglected because of the deterioration of that office.

Moreover, he neither had a teacher nor one to impart aught to him, for he was sunk in Ur of the Chaldeans among the foolish worshipers of stars, and his father, and his mother, like all the people, worshiped stars, and he, although following them in their worship, busies his heart and reflects until he attains the path of truth, and, by his correct thinking, he understood when he finally saw the line of righteousness. He knew that there is One God; He leads the planet; He created everything; and in all that is there is no god save He. He knew that the whole world was in error, and that the thing which caused them to err was, that their worshiping the stars and the images brought about the loss of the truth from their consciousness. And, when Abraham was forty years old he recognized his Creator. After he came to this comprehension and knowledge he started to confute the sons of Ur of the Chaldeans, and to organize disputations with them, cautioning them, saying: \"This is not the true path that you are following\", and he destroyed the images, and commenced preaching to the people warning them that it is not right to worship any save the God of the universe, and unto Him alone it is right to bow down, to offer sacrifices, and compound offerings, so that the creatures of the future shall recognize Him. Moreover, it is right to destroy and break in pieces all of the images, so that the whole population of the future be not led to an error like unto these who imagine that there is no God save these images. When he had them subdued by his well supported contentions, the king tried to put him to death, but he was saved by a miracle, and went hence to Haran. There he stood up anew and called out in a great voice to the whole world, to let them know that there is One God for the whole universe, and unto Him it is proper to render service. And thus he went onward with his proclamations from city to city, and from government to government, until he attained the land of Canaan amidst his outcry, even as it is said: \"And called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God\" (Gen. 21.33). When the people who congregated about him asked him concerning his preachments, he replied by imparting knowledge to each and every one according to his mentality, to the end that he was able to turn him to the path of truth, until there congregated about him thousands, even tens of thousands, and they became the people of Abraham's household, in whose heart he implanted this great cause, <strong>concerning which he compiled books</strong>, and which he imparted to his son Isaac.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as I know none of those books are extant.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It could be that the book of Genesis would be referred to as the Book of Abraham.

    "content": "# How has our attitude changed toward the relationship of morality to Torah observance?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have often noticed, in my interactions with other Orthodox Jews, that they seem to feel that the correct resolution of every moral question is to ask a prominent rabbi. For example, when I point out to the people at certain schools or synagogues that their lax policies with respect to the Coronavirus have led others to avoid participation, they respond by telling me what some prominent rabbi has recommend with respect to Coronavirus. This is always a strange moment in the conversation, because it seems to convert a fairly simple problem of moral reasoning into a different problem of deference to rabbis and the seeming arrogance of continuing to argue the original substantive point.</p>\n<p>Right now, I’m not asking anything about the Coronavirus. That’s example is just intended as an illustration of a more general question.</p>\n<p>When I consider what my children learn in school, when they tell me about <em>kashas</em> in <em>gemara</em> and how the <em>rishonim</em> address these <em>kashas</em>, it’s pretty plain to me that this sort of education will do very little to resolve moral questions. That expectation seems simply misplaced, like expecting their other courses in algebra or chemistry to resolve moral questions. And I have not personally observed that <em>mussar</em> courses have made participants kinder or more virtuous in any way, or wiser or more sophisticated when discussing morality.</p>\n<p>And this leads me to wonder. Is there a growing expectation, in Jewish thought over the centuries, that moral problems are really just misunderstandings of <em>halachic</em> problems, and that there’s little point in discussing moral problems? Can we discern somehow that in earlier times Orthodox Jews thought that all people have moral duties that cannot be reduced to <em>tefillin</em> and <em>mezuzah</em>, but that this view has somehow been eclipsed by a sort of halachic maximalism, a view that it is more proper for a Jew to see <em>halachic</em> duties as his only duties, or that moral thinking is somehow not our department?</p>\n<p>As the \"votes to close\" come in, clarification has been advised. This seems likely to make the question fuzzier but may, I hope, save it from closure.</p>\n<p>It is not my point that <em>halachic</em> questions are the only questions properly directed to rabbis. I'm not taking any sort of position at all about what should be directed to rabbis. I'm just reflecting on a feeling, a feeling that each of us may or may not recognize, that this way of responding to a moral question has a chilling effect on the discussion. Maybe a chilling effect is desirable. But I'm wondering if this possibility, that a chilling effect is desirable, is gaining traction in our world. Did we formerly suppose that for Orthodox Jews, as for everyone else in the world, moral questions were very important, and that we should be capable of serious discussion and moral passion, while today it is supposed that we should be more passive? Did it formerly seem more admissible than now, that we might have a moral duty to accept personal costs and difficult burdens, even where this moral duty is not <em>halachic</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In order to address your question, an underlying question must be addressed. Who or what defines what is and isn't moral? I believe that G-d, as the Creator of all existence, ultimately defines that. I also believe that He revealed his will in the Torah. So if I have a question as to morality, I will consult an expert in the Torah.</p>\n<p>Some parts of the Torah may seem to bear on morality more than others, but they are all part of G-d's moral system. For example, it is immoral to steal, but the definition of stealing depends on the rules of ownership, which are subjects of discussion. For example, children generally start learning Talmud with the second chapter of Bava Metzia, which discusses which lost objects must be returned. While the technical aspects of it might not seem to affect morality, ultimately they determine when it is moral to keep a lost object and when not.</p>\n<p>Now, not all questions are about morality. Questions about how to deal with coronavirus also have a practical aspect. But to answer the moral aspects of the question, we must consult the Torah and those who know it best.</p>\n<p>As for claiming that mussar courses don't seem to work, it really depends on whether the participants are receptive to the message. Children in school often are not, but the adults I see taking classes usually are. Different people respond better to different books and teaching styles, and as adults they can find the ones that inspire them. The book that inspires me may not be the one for you, and vica versa. But people who want to improve will find the guidance in the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

This is 'she'eila', borrowing. It is also not subject to the laws of usury; as you'll see elsewhere on this site, if you borrow a friend's car, you may return it with a full tank of gas. The main item is the car, which is not a consumable. You could, in fact, charge a movie studio if they want to borrow a wad of $100 bills to use as a prop -- they are expected to gently use that exact wad and return them intact. That's not a \"loan\", but rather a \"rental\", just like if you had a business renting cars or power tools.</p>\n<p>A \"loan\" described in the Torah is understood that the other party will consume what you provided them, then obtain more of it. E.g. they will spend the money on opening a business, then give you back money they make.

By the Herodian period, it is not certain that Judea is following Babylon any more.  Josephus says that 14 Nisan occurs \"when the sun is in Aries\" (<em>Antiquities</em> 3.10.5), that is, on or after the equinox.  In the Talmud, the equinox is given as one of three conditions, two of which must obtain for an intercalation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our Rabbis taught: A year may be intercalated on three grounds:  on account of the premature state of the corn-crops; or that of the fruit trees; or on account of the lateness of the equinox.  Any two of these reasons can justify intercalation, but not one alone. (Tractate <em>Sanhedrin</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tosefta gives a rule for intercalating on account of the equinox:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The year is not to be intercalated unless the spring equinox is still distant the greater part of a month.  How much is the greater part of a month?  Sixteen days.  R. Jehuda says:  Two thirds of a month, twenty days. T. <em>Sanhedrin</em> 2.7.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rabbinic calendar, which dates from the period C.E. 700-950, though a late Jewish tradition gives it a date in the 4th century C.E.,  seems to have been designed always to put the 15th or 16th of Nisan after the equinox.  And due to a slight solar drift in the Rabbinic calendar, the 16th of Nisan is now always after the equinox.  The 15th of Nisan can not now fall before March 26th in the Gregorian calendar, and in the 8th, 11th, and 19th years of the 19 year cycle, the 16th of Nisan can be a month after the equinox. as it was in 2016.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If nobody in this famous community answers I give the answer from scripture as good as I can. The calendar is defined through Moses by watching the sun and the moon.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first day of every month is the day you watch with a naked eye the first visable crescent of the moon. This is one or two days after the New Moon (0% visability).</li>\n<li>The first month is found by watching the sun. The spring festival must be in the first month. This means that the 15th of the first month must be on or after the first day of the spring. The first day of the spring is when you see sunset exactly in the west.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>God says that we have to guard the first month to have 3 festivals in a year (Deuteronomy 16:1,16). To guard this an extra month is inserted if necessary in the old year to prevent the spring festival starts in winter and we have 2 or 4 festivals in a year in stead of the required 3.\nIn the end this seems to me clear and not complicated what I first thought. I think it is strange that there are so many different voices.</p>\n<p>You can see the moon and the sun in the past with the open source program Stellarium. You have to set the atmosphere on to take into account atmospheric correction for the human eye.</p>\n<p>I'd appreciate it if someone respond.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your entry 'What is the relation between the month Nisan and the spring equinox according to scripture?' is rather old but I wish to respond. You stated that 'The first day of every month is the day you watch with a naked eye the first visable crescent of the moon'. However, since you are referring to scripture it needs to be said that there is no edict from G<em>d to use the crescent as a marker. G</em>d said 'THE NEW' ie the NEW MOON, which is when it is NOT visible (it is DARK). Such an observation requires faith and trust. The crescent as a mechanism was only used since Babylon: it was learned from the Babylonians since Babel did not use faith but sight. We picked up a bad habit. You gave a reference to Exodus 12:2: 'This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.'  We <em>KNOW</em> the month was ABIB [Ex 13:4] or AVIV (later called Nisan or Nissan or Nisanu since that is what the Babylonians called it). We <em>know</em> the month started with the NEW phase. But G<em>d did not say how to gauge the first month - he did <em>not</em> say 'Use the NORTHERN HEMISPHERE SUMMER EQUINOX TO DETERMINE THE START OF THE YEAR'. But nearly everybody agrees that is what was intended. I agree. (Some people think it is the month when the Barley (abib) flowers - but that is not so.) So - there is no overt, explicit scriptural reference to using the  Equinox but it makes the most sense. Most of the other mechanisms are man-made: eg the 16th of Nisan/Abib must be after the equinox etc. is invented by wise mathematicians with their bibles open. But there is no command from G</em>d for such. - Z</p>\n\n\n",

And Joseph did not want to tell him because of his good ethics. And it therefore states (Genesis 50:16-17), \"Your father commanded before his death, saying...

Also, the fact that Yocheved weaned him for 2 years then sent him to the palace could have been quite exciting for the Jewish People hoping that he would rise to greatness. Obviously when Moshe returned from Midian he had to provide signs to prove that he was the redeemer, but was there ever any excitement or expectation at any time that Moshe as he was growing up or beyond that he was going to be the redeemer?\nWhat I meant to ask is, when Moshe came back on the scene did the people of Goshen say \"I always knew it!\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.14a.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gemara</a> says that Miriam prophesied to her father Amram that Moshe would save the Jews, but when he was put in the river Amram gave up hope.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מרים דכתיב (שמות טו, כ) ותקח מרים הנביאה אחות אהרן ולא אחות משה אמר ר\"נ אמר רב שהיתה מתנבאה כשהיא אחות אהרן ואומרת עתידה אמי שתלד בן שיושיע את ישראל ובשעה שנולד נתמלא כל הבית כולו אורה עמד אביה ונשקה על ראשה אמר לה בתי נתקיימה נבואתיך<br />\nMiriam was a prophetess, as it is written explicitly: “And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand” (Exodus 15:20). The Gemara asks: Was she the sister only of Aaron, and not the sister of Moses? Why does the verse mention only one of her brothers? Rav Naḥman said that Rav said: For she prophesied when she was the sister of Aaron, i.e., she prophesied since her youth, even before Moses was born, and she would say: My mother is destined to bear a son who will deliver the Jewish people to salvation. And at the time when Moses was born the entire house was filled with light, and her father stood and kissed her on the head, and said to her: My daughter, your prophecy has been fulfilled.<br />\nוכיון שהשליכוהו ליאור עמד אביה וטפחה על ראשה ואמר לה בתי היכן נבואתיך היינו דכתיב (שמות ב, ד) ותתצב אחותו מרחוק לדעה לדעת מה יהא בסוף נבואתה<br />\nBut once Moses was cast into the river, her father arose and rapped her on the head, saying to her: My daughter, where is your prophecy now, as it looked as though the young Moses would soon meet his end. This is the meaning of that which is written with regard to Miriam’s watching Moses in the river: “And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him” (Exodus 2:4), i.e., to know what would be with the end of her prophecy, as she had prophesied that her brother was destined to be the savior of the Jewish people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However according to the fuller account of the story in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta_d%27Rabbi_Yishmael.15.20?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Mekhilta</a> Miriam did not give up hope.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תקח מרים הנביאה, וכי היכן מצינו שנביאה היתה מרים אלא שאמרה לאביה סופך אתה מוליד בן שמושיע את ישראל מיד מצרים מיד וילך איש מבית לוי ויקח וגו' (שמות ב) ותהר ותלד בן וגו' ולא יכלה עוד הצפינו. נזף בה אביה אמ' לה בתי היכן נבואותיך ועודה מחזקת בנבואתה שנ' ותתצב אחותו מרחוק לדעה מה יעשה לו ואין יציבה אלא נבואה שנ' ראיתי את ה' נצב על המזבח (עמוס ט) ואומר ויבא ה' ויתיצב (שמ\"א ג) ואומר קרא את יהושע והתיצבו וגו' וילך משה ויהושע ויתיצבו באהל מועד (דברים לא): מרחוק אין מרחוק בכל מקום אלא רוח הקדש שנאמר מרחוק ה' נראה לי (ירמיה לא): לדעה אין דעה אלא רוח הקדש שנ' כי מלאה הארץ דעה את ה' וגו' (ישעיה יא) [ואומר כי תמלא הארץ לדעת את כבוד ה' כמים יכסו על ים (חבקוק ב)]: מה יעשה לו אין עשייה אלא רוח הקדש שנ' כי לא יעשה ה' אלהים דבר וגו' (עמוס ג):<br />\n(Ibid. 20) \"Then Miriam the prophetess took\": Where do we find that Miriam was a prophetess?

But she stood fast to her prophecy, viz. (4) \"And his sister stood from afar to know what would be done with him,\" \"standing\" (\"yetzivah\") signifying prophecy, viz. (Amos 9:1) \"I saw the L rd standing on the altar\", and (I Samuel 3:10) \"And the L rd came and He stood, etc.\", and (Devarim 31:19) \"Call Joshua and stand, etc.\" (Exodus, Ibid.) \"from afar\": \"from afar\" everywhere signifies the Holy Spirit, viz.

If it is between one of the poor of your city and one of the poor of another city, the one of the poor of your city takes precedence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Midrash: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Mishpatim.15.5?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanchuma Mishpatim 15:5</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֶת הֶעָנִי עִמָּךְ, מִכָּאן אָמְרוּ רַבּוֹתֵינוּ זִכְרוֹנָם לִבְרָכָה: עֲנִיֶּיךָ וַעֲנִיֵּי עִירְךָ, עֲנִיֶּיךָ קוֹדְמִין. עֲנִיֵּי עִירְךָ וַעֲנִיֵּי עִיר אַחֶרֶת, עֲנִיֵּי עִירְךָ קוֹדְמִין לַעֲנִיֵּי עִיר אַחֶרֶת.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The biblical source of the saying \"charity begins at home\" is probably the following <em>passuk</em>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.58?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.58?lang=bi</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הֲלוֹא פָרֹס לָרָעֵב לַחְמֶךָ וַעֲנִיִּים מְרוּדִים תָּבִיא בָיִת כִּי\nתִרְאֶה עָרֹם וְכִסִּיתוֹ וּמִבְּשָׂרְךָ לֹא תִתְעַלָּם.</p>\n<p>It is to share your bread with the hungry, And to take the wretched\npoor into your home; When you see the naked, to clothe him, And not to\nignore your own kin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please refer to the following hebrew Wikipedia article which explains the various <em>halachot</em> that are derived from this principle - <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%9A_%D7%9C%D7%90_%D7%AA%D7%AA%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%9A_%D7%9C%D7%90_%D7%AA%D7%AA%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%9D</a>.</p>\n<p>Probably the most relevant of the article, vis-a-vis the current question, is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>צדקה רבי יצחק בן משה מווינה פסק בספרו אור זרוע (הלכות צדקה), לתת קודם\nכול לקרובי משפחתו, עד מחצית מכספי הצדקה. דין זה נסמך על הפסוק \"ומבשרך\nאל תתעלם\".</p>\n<p>The Ohr Zarua says that one is obliged to give at least 50% of one's\n<em>tzedaka</em> funds first to their own relatives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why is one asked to join the Jewish community if this practice is not mentioned in the Halacha? Or maybe it is but I am not aware of?",
    "content": "# Why is one asked to join the Jewish community if this practice is not mentioned in the Halacha? Or maybe it is but I am not aware of?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is written in the Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Intercourse.14.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Laws of Forbidden Relations chap. 14, 2</a>) that when the potential convert comes to convert \"we notify him regarding a small number of weighty mitzvot and a small number of light mitzvot and we may not prolong this matter\". So we see that we should merely notify them regarding a small number of mitzvot and not to teach them the intricacies and finite details. And this is partly because we find written in the talmud (Sanhedrin 59) and codified in the Rambam (Laws of Kings 10, 9) that a non-Jew is forbidden to learn Torah and if he does so he is liable to death. This is also borne out from the gemara (Shabbat 31a) that we find that the great sage Hillel the elder taught the converts Torah only after he converted them and not before. Thus it is forbidden to teach them the intricacies of Jewish law until they have converted since prior to conversion they are considered completely as non-Jews. Thus, one who teaches them in such a manner is certainly causing them to sin. Also we find that it is forbidden to prolong this process since we do not wish to overly discourage and frighten them.</p>\n<p>Moreover, teaches the Rambam there (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Intercourse.14.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 5</a>) that if he accepts this we must convert him immediately and it is forbidden to delay this. Explains the Bet Yosef (268, 2) the reason for this that we are forbidden to delay a mitzva and must do it promptly. And writes the Rambam there that we should not be exacting on the convert and this clearly signifies that we should not give him a test to see how much he has memorized about Jewish law etc. And off course all the above mentioned is learned from the words of the Talmud (Yevamot 47a) and is brought in the Tur and the Jewish code of law the Shulchan Aruch (268, 2) as the undisputed halacha.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we do not find anywhere in the Torah or talmud or the Rambam or the Shulchan Aruch that a convert must move to a Jewish community prior to conversion and on the contrary the Rambam himself writes (Laws of Kings 5, 7) that a Jew is allowed to live anywhere in the world that he wishes except for Egypt and off course this includes the converts as well since we must treat them as full fledged Jews in every way like it is written many times in the Torah (Lev. 16, 29, ibid. 18, 26, Numbers 15, 14, ibid, 15, 29). It follows that if one rejects a potential convert due to this he is acting contrary to halacha since we may not be overly exacting on them and overly discourage them or delay them as mentioned above since we are thereby delaying a mitzva without any halachic justification. Also we are thereby preventing the potential convert from studying Torah and doing mitzvot and thereby robbing from him his portion in the world to come.</p>\n<p>Thus, in conclusion we find that according to Jewish law it is forbidden to teach potential converts the intricacies of Jewish law and likewise it is forbidden to draw out their conversion process for years. Also, one may not require them to be tested regarding this. And one may not obligate them to move to a Jewish community prior to conversion as a prerequisite. And all this stands in stark contrast to the tradition passed down to us from Mount Sinai as taught in the Talmud and the Rambam and the Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n<p>I could think of few things as to why, but I was wondering, is there any Halachic mention of this practice?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The question boils down to, why does a convert today have to go through a lengthy education process and be required to move into a physical jewish community when the classic halacha clearly does not require this.</p>\n<p>I don't have a source, but I would say that in today's society a greater level of background is needed for one to honestly say that they can accept the rigors of Judaism. In classical times Judaism was much more community supported. One joined the Jewish community and that was his whole life. Jews just didn't live amongst the goyim. So there was no need to make sure that the convert could keep to the many intricacies of halacha; that would come naturally as he lives as part of the community. There was no need to require him to live in the community; if he became a Jew he would have no choice. There was less worry about backing out; this was a terribly unliked move in the eyes of the non-Jews, and the convert must be committed to come and convert in the first place. Today none of that is true, and a Jew might not live so exclusively amongst other Jews, and a convert is not a social outcast for deciding to become a Jew. There is every reason to think that a convert might never learn most parts of practical halacha, and that he might decide afterwards that this is not what he had in mind. And there is no motivation to accept a convert who will later leave Judaism.</p>\n\n\n",

As Maimonides wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The idolaters compiled many books of worship, defining its principle manner of service, its works and its laws; but the Holy One, blessed be He! charged us not to read those books at all, not to think of idolatry generally nor of aught of its details. Moreover, to look at it is forbidden, as it is said: \"Turn ye not unto idols\" (Lev. 19.4.); and of thinking on this subject it is said: \"And that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their god\"? (Ibid.), which is a warning that thou shalt not inquire concerning its manner of practice, though thou art not worshiping it, for this very inquiry causes a turning after it and to imitate their practice, as it is further said: \"Even so will I do likewise\" (Ibid.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a comment you said that you were not given a choice of topic, but it might be worth explaining to whoever assigned the essay that their assignment is not realistic, as the Talmud is completely uninterested in the falsehoods of the Romans, and considered their study a complete waste of time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sages taught in a baraita: With regard to writing that is under a picture or under graven images [deyokenaot], it is prohibited to read it on Shabbat lest one end up reading business documents. And with regard to an idolatrous image itself, even on a weekday it is prohibited to look at it, because it says: “Do not turn toward idols [al tifnu el ha’elilim] or make yourselves molten gods, I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 19:4). The Gemara asks for clarification: What is the biblical derivation? How does this verse indicate that one may not look at an idolatrous image? Rabbi Ḥanin said: Do not push God [al tefannu El] out of your mind by looking at these images.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I was hoping others can provide more information, and sources:<br />\na) How do we know to be תולה above the words (as in the picture) rather than below? Is below allowed (presumably staying closer to the line above than the line below)?<br />\nb) I think someone suggested that we are תולה just above the next word?<br />\nc) Related to the previous question - if one is being תולה more than one word, or even an entire verse or more, how in the world can you tell where it should fit in the surrounding lines?<br />\nIn my youth when I used to add something in English to a line, you'd write above or below and then mark the spot in the original phrase with a V or Λ above or below where the new words should fit it. I'm certain you can't do that in a Sefer Torah.<br />\nd) I found a couple of images online, but not much discussion. Are there a lot of examples of this to see somewhere?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>a) It was probably considered obvious, but you occasionally (eg. YD 273:6, 276:12) find incidental references to \"למעלה above\" which clarify that the intention is to hang the missing text above the line. I haven't seen anyone discuss what happens if you put it only below the line but I'd guess it's only kosher if it is written in such a way that it is clear where the text is supposed to be inserted (perhaps analogous to Tashbetz 1:176).</p>\n<p>b) See Melekhet Shamayim (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36017&st=&pgnum=151\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">25:6</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ושתולה התיבה שחסרה בין השיטין מתחיל כתיבתה מכוון למעלה על התיבה ששייכה אחר התיבה החסרה, ולא יתחיל לכתוב התיבה החסרה מרוחקת לצד ימין יותר מן התיבה שלמטה ממנה  וגם לא ירחיקנה לצד שמאל יותר מהתיבה שלמטה, אלא במקום שהתחיל האות הראשונה של תיבה שלמטה שם יתחיל האות הראשונה של התיבה שלמעלה, ועל כל פנים אם מגיע תחילת התיבה שבין השיטין מכוון עד סוף התיבה שלפניה שתחתיה פסול.‏<br />\nWhen hanging a missing word between the lines, start its writing aligned above the word that belongs after the missing word, and don't start to write the missing word far to the right of the word below it, and also don't distance it far to the left of the word below it, rather in the place that begins the first letter of the word below, there should start the first letter of the word above, and at the very least if the beginning of the word above reaches to the end of the word before it it is invalid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>c) You can't use marks to indicate where the word should go (ibid.). Some allow a very long passage of text to be inserted by continuing onto the next couple interline spaces, arguing it is obvious because of the cramped writing that it all goes together to be inserted at the starting place, while others do not allow that (see Aruch Hashulchan <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%A2%D7%95#%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9F_%D7%A8%D7%A2%D7%95_%D7%A1%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A3_%D7%99%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 276:12</a>-14).</p>\n<p>d) It happened often enough in old Torah scrolls, but nowadays it almost never happens (cf. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44655&st=&pgnum=51\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Benei Yonah 25b</a>). The market is such that for a scribe who erred it's usually worth it to rewrite whole columns or pay for fancy expert erasures to ensure the product isn't \"ugly\". But it's hard to say it's no longer kosher if you did it, and indeed I've seen it happen on rare occasions.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm seeking either a breakdown of the costs and/or general information on what amount of funds a traveling charity collector can expect to receive after expenses - either gleaned from reputable sources or data available from elsewhere.\nThe reason for my inquiry is to better determine the effectiveness of my charity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I am assuming this question is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic\">considered on topic</a>, if not please close</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dom%C3%A1n_Istv%C3%A1n\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">late Hungarian rabbi</a> wrote the following in his <a href=\"https://www.libri.hu/konyv/doman_istvan.menekules-2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">memoir</a> about his stay in the United States of the 1950s (pp. 264–276):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As we entered the flat [...], a man of a small stature sat on a low chair, around the age of 35. [...] He spoke English with a very heavy accent, it was difficult to understand his words. [...] It turned out that he was collecting for a yeshivah in Israel. He passed my father-in-law an English language brochure about the institute, on which a multi-storey building was visible and next to it the name of the institute: Yeshivat Beit Yoseif. According to the brochure, in this yeshivah 100 bocher study the Talmud with its most important commentaries from dawn until late night. We were informed that the American agency of this institute is in this flat, and he, Mr. X. is its sole director. [...]</p>\n<p>After the short \"hearing\" he handed over to my father-in-law about fifty addresses. On these slips of paper the amount was also indicated which the person contributed to the maintenance of the school. The addresses were from the state of Massachusetts. The terms of the employment were very severe. He began by saying that 100 dollars were to be deposited in exchange for the addresses! This would stay with him as long as my father-in-law gets addresses from him. He didn't cover travel costs! The collector had to cover them, as an investment in the business. However, only 30 percent of the collected amount were to be handed over to Mr. X. The rest is the collector's. [...]</p>\n<p>My father-in-law came home for the Shabbat. He was full of experience and hope.</p>\n<p>– Imagine, all my addresses came off! I hand over the receipt, these bring it to the inner room, I can't even look there, and they bring the money. [...] These get such a receipt which makes it possible to deduct the amount of the donation from their tax.</p>\n<p>– How much expenditure did you have? [...]</p>\n<p>– Very little. In most places there is an orech shtibl (guest room for poor travellers) in the temple. One may stay there for one or two nights. There are places where breakfast and dinner can be bought for cheap as well.</p>\n<p>– How much did you collect? [...]</p>\n<p>– Four hundred dollars. In contrast, I had 120 dollars expenditure. 280 dollars remained. Out of it I hand over 84 to the rabbi, thus net 196 dollars remain for me. [...]</p>\n<p>As for me, I felt [...] [that it's better] than collecting for an Israeli yeshivah, out of which quite little could remain for the yeshivah, because out of the 30% that the mysterious person called \"rabbi\" collected, he had to spend a significant amount on his own and his family's sustenance. If so, what is to remain for the yeshivah? It seemed evident that this part of the thing didn't bother those who were collecting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in this example 30% covered the costs of the collector (travelling, lodging, food), 21% gross went to the rabbi and 49% was the collector's income.</p>\n\n\n",

The former is mentioned in the Talmud:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=8&daf=36b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beitza 36b</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא מטפחין ולא מספקין ולא מרקדין: גזרה שמא יתקן כלי שיר</p>\n<p>NOR CLAP THE HANDS, NOR SLAP THE THIGHS, NOR DANCE; it is a preventive measure\nlest he might repair musical instruments.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Beitzah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A principle often mentioned in halachic writings about new situations is that we do not invent our own preventative decrees. If the Sages were concerned about something they issued a decree about it. If they didn't issue a decree about it then we don't have to invent our own. Indeed, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayyim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Joseph Hayyim of Baghdad</a>, in his responsum on bicycles explicitly makes this point:</p>\n<p><strong>Shu\"t Rav Pe'alim O.C. 1:25</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have heard it further said that we should be concerned that there will be in this some break on Shabbat and he will come to fix it. And this too is nonsense, and does not deserve to be said. First, because this object is not prone to breaking, and furthermore we do not invent decrees on our own that were not decreed by the Sages. For according to this there are many things that are permitted to use but are prone to breaking that we would need to forbid because of this decree. And we find many things that the Sages forbade on Shabbat lest one come to write or to fix, and that notwithstanding we don't generate these decrees on our own by other things that they did not delineate these decrees. And therefore there are many things where the decree of \"lest he come to write\" or \"lest he come to fix\" would be applicable but they are nevertheless permitted, because the Sages did not make this decree for them.</p>\n<p>And see what the Birchei Yosef writes in the name of Maharam Provencial that it is permitted to compose a song by mouth with rhythm [?] and we do not decree \"lest he come to write\", because we only have that which is explicit in the words of the Sages, end quote.</p>\n<p>And so wrote Tosafot in Chulin, and these are their words: \"We do not compare the decrees of the Sages to each other except where the Talmud does so\", end quote.</p>\n<p>And see the Shach in Yoreh Deiah where he wrote that we do not compare decrees to each other as Tosafot wrote in Chulin, see there.</p>\n<p>And so wrote  the Magen Avraham, see there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833), born into a\nBrahmin family and the recipient of both Hindu and Muslim education\neventually developed a strong symphony for the Unitarian Christians,\neven writing a work on the messages of Jesus. Roy eventually broke\nwith Christianity and developed his Hindu reform movement.     Roy’s\nmost famous social reform is to campaign against window burning\n(sati). some of his other reforms included a rejection of Hindu\npantheism, to be substituted with a more biblical notion of\nanthropomorphic monotheism; rejection of Hindu mythology, rejection of\nall iconic worship of “graven images,” rejection of sacrifices, and a\nrepudiation of the doctrine of avataras.\nThe Brahmo Samaj movement strove toward monotheism, rejected the worship of forms and idols, and no longer regarded the Vedas or the\nmedieval Hindu classics as the sole religious authority. The Brahmo\nSamaj put forth principles that they widely circulated, of not adoring\nany created thing, no graven images and no animate or inanimate\nobjects. One served God by performing good deeds, by promoting\ncharity, morality, piety, benevolence and virtue, and through\nstrengthening the bonds of union between men of all religions and\ncreeds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is this faith considered Avodah Zarah?

In the section on the Brisker Rov, he describes a time that Rav Shalom Schwadron visited the Rov with his son-in-law, Rav Eliyahu Dovid Reichman, to ask a shayla on the Rambam.</p>\n<p>The Brisker Rov heard the shayla and told his own son, Rav Yoshe Ber, to answer it. Rav Yoshe Ber did so, and then proceeded to relate the circumstances under which his father arrived at this pshat.</p>\n<p>They were fleeing Warsaw in 1939, and heading in the direction of Vilna. The Germans were bombing groups of refugees from the air, so the Rov and his family turned off the road. Under heavy aerial bombardment, they made their way to a copse of trees, where the Brisker Rov suddenly declared: “I have pshat on the Rambam!”</p>\n<p>According to Lorincz, this story is told in Rav Shalom Schwadron’s biography, קול חוצב. I have been shown a copy of the relevant section online, but all that it adds to this story beyond what Lorincz relates is that the chiddush concerned Hilkhos Qorban Pesach. Does anybody know what Rav Schwadron’s shayla actually was? Does anybody know the pshat in the Rambam that Rav Yoshe Ber delivered in the name of his father?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does God love every Jew unconditionally?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If a Jew spent his entire life doing terrible sins, would God still love him? For example, does God love Jesus or Jews who have caused similarly terrible damage?\nPlease provide sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.36a.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kiddushin 36a</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'A baraita: The verse: “You are the sons to the Lord your God,”\nindicates that when you act like sons and cleave to the Holy One,\nBlessed be He, you are called sons, but when you do not act like sons\nyou are not called sons. This is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi\nMeir says: Either way you are still called sons, as it is stated:\n“They are foolish sons” (Jeremiah 4:22). It also states: “Sons in whom\nthere is no faithfulness” (Deuteronomy 32:20). And it states: “A seed\nof evildoers, sons who deal corruptly” (Isaiah 1:4). And it states:\n“And it shall come to pass that, instead of what was said to them: You\nare not My people, it shall be said to them: Sons of the living God”\n(Hosea 2:1). The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to cite these\nadditional proofs? If you would say: Granted, when they are foolish\nthey are still called sons, as the verse states: “Foolish sons,” but\nwhen they do not have faithfulness they are not called sons;\ntherefore, come and hear another verse. And that verse states: “Sons\nin whom there is no faithfulness.” יAnd if you would say: It is when\nthey do not have faithfulness that they are called sons, as stated,\nbut when they worship idols they are not called sons anymore;\ntherefore, come and hear: And the verse states: “A seed of evildoers,\nsons who deal corruptly,” which alludes to the corruption of idol\nworship. And if you would say that although they are called “sons who\ndeal corruptly,” they are no longer called full-fledged sons of God\nonce they have sinned, come and hear: And the verse states: “And it\nshall come to pass that, instead of what was said to them: You are not\nMy people, it shall be said to them: Sons of the living God.”'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are different levels: very very different. But in the end we are all his children כביכול. How do you feel about your son? It depends on what he's done, of course. But in the end he is your son, and that means a lot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Well a word like \"Love\" when applied to Hashem has to be understood only as a metaphor. So, I would recast your question as: Does Hashem act toward sinners in a manner intended for us to experience as loving?</p>\n<p>In the beraisa that is included volumes of Mishnah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.6.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pireqi Avos 6:1</a>, Rabbi Meir lists some of the titles one gains by learning torah lishmah, Torah for its [proper] sake. Among them, three involving love -- \"אָהוּב, אוֹהֵב אֶת הַמָּקוֹם, אוֹהֵב אֶת הַבְּרִיּוֹת -- beloved, loves the Omnipresent, loves human beings\".</p>\n<p>On that third one, \"אוֹהֵב אֶת הַבְּרִיּוֹת -- loves human beings\", the Tif'eres Yisrael writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא לבד לאדם מיוחד, אלא אפילו אותן המקולקלין במדות, או בחטאים שאין לאוהבן רק מדהן בריות של הקב\"ה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not only the distinguished person, but also those who are defective in Middos, or sinners who aren't to be lived except for their being creations of HQBH.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even as we hate the fact that someone is a sinner, we are still supposed to love everyone G-d created, sinner or someone of higher aspirations, Jew or non-Jew.</p>\n<p>Another example. Normally if one is faced with two mitzvos -- helping someone load their animal or helping someone unload their animal, a person must prioritize unloading. It is the more compassionate choice for the animals. But, if the person loading the animal is your enemy, then helping your enemy load the animal comes first. So as to \"conquer your yeitzer hara\".</p>\n<p>Tosafos (Bava Metzia 32b) ask: Enemy? What kind of enemy? Aren't we prohibited to hate other Jews? He points out that we are supposed to feel hatred toward the sinner. So then why would we want to help the hated sinner so as to conquer our hatred of them?</p>\n<p>They answer that not helping the person with their animal will inflame their hatred. And their hatred might inflame your hatred in response. While it is okay to hate a sinner for being a sinner, adding personal hatred on top of that is prohibited.</p>\n<p>Now that's people. In addition, Hashem knows the sinner's background and motive, how the person got to this lowly state. This is what He expects us, with our ignorant about what goes on the minds of others -- to love every person (again, not just Jews) even while simultaneously feeling hatred toward those who sin.</p>\n<p>I would expect so does He. Figuratively speaking.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Hi I completely second MichoelR's answer and nothing further needs to be said, but I will say it anyway because I enjoy this topic, feel I have some small level of mastery on it and would like to attempt a further explanation of what he said, if I may.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of Devarim Hashem enumerates all our upcoming failures and subsequent punishments. However the final conclusion is not \"and I will destroy you and get rid of you\", but rather \"but we are stuck together forever\".</p>\n<p>What is this? Hashem has ultimately wrapped Himself up with His people, Israel. He's never ever going to leave, no matter what. I guess, kveyachol, He is a hopeless romantic.</p>\n<p>So we need to know, what is love? It actually has two meanings in common use (both in Torah* and in English). This confuses us and by understanding it we can understand what DoubleAA (I believe) was getting at in their comment about why can't Hashem both love and hate us?</p>\n<p>The first meaning is of love as an emotion. A strong positive feeling of desiring closeness with another. According to Kabbalah this comes in 5 flavours corresponding to the five fingers of the right hand. If anyone wants to know about this please ask. Feelings are responses, volatile and dynamic. They come and go. Therefore, one would not expect anyone to love someone else unconditionally. In fact, it has been said that claiming to love someone unconditionally is cruel. I'll explain why once I finish discussing the other meaning of love.</p>\n<p>The other meaning of love is in the sense of oneness. Other words come to mind: belonging, home, intimate... This is actually way more powerful and important. In fact, oneness is what Hashem is all about - this is the highest. As we explained above, in this sense, Hashem's love is unconditional. By being one with us unconditionally, as a result of this, He loves us in the other sense, as well as every other emotion, so to speak. We are now so important and connected to Him that He will even get angry at us, hate us, and sometimes lose His loving feelings towards us if we cause Him to respond that way by our behaviour...</p>\n<p>Therefore, in the other sense, if He were to say He loves us unconditionally, it would mean He no longer <em>responds</em> to us at all, a terrible thing that we should not wish upon anyone. It would mean, chas veshalom, we no longer dwell in His House, we are no longer His and He is no longer ours. If a parent tells a child he loves him unconditionally, he is taking a risk in making the child feel that the parent doesn't really care about him. The child doesn't matter to the parent; as the child doesn't produce a response in the parent anymore, nothing the child does matters.</p>\n<p>I hope that makes sense. I am on my phone right now, so I'll bli neder bring a few sources later, although MichoelR's source suffices</p>\n<p>* e.g. see Keter Shem Tov 2:53</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can there be a custom which creates Nosar?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah says not to leave over the meat of the Pesach offering (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0212.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 12:10</a>), known as the prohibition of <em>Nosar</em>. Even though this prohibition doesn't get lashes, either because it doesn't have an associated action or because it's given over for positive rectification (לאו הניתק לעשה) (Makkos 4b), my (hopefully reasonable) premise is it's still prohibited.</p>\n<p>This means that all edible meat has to be eaten. However, this makes the following statement of the <em>gemarra</em> regarding the <em>gid hanashe</em> (sciatic nerve) problematic:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.83b.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 83b</a>, Chullin 91b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שמנו מותר וישראל קדושים הם ונוהגין בו איסור</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How could there be a custom not to eat the fat of the <em>gid hanashe</em>, if it's permitted to eat? If it's permitted to eat, then it should be prohibited <strong>not</strong> to eat it.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the <em>gemarra</em> gives cases where <em>Chazal</em> prohibited certain parts of the animal. If it's actually permissible to eat, they're creating <em>Nosar</em>! Perhaps we have to come on to עקירת דבר מן התורה בשב ואל תעשה, but that won't help for a custom.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Minchat_Chinukh.8.1.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minchat Chinuch 8</a> suggests that maybe the prohibition to leave over from the <em>korban</em> only applies to those parts of it which are fit to be eaten. The fat of the <em>gid hanashe</em> is not fit to be eaten (due to custom) and therefore the prohibition to leave over does not apply to it.</p>\n<p>However, he ultimately moves away from this approach, as it is diffcult to understand why these fats would have to be burned on the sixteenth of Nissan if they are not considered <em>notar</em>.</p>\n<p>Instead he believes (as you mentioned) that Chazal removed the prohibition to leave over in the case of these fats, through the mechanism of <em>yesh koach b'yad chachamim la'akor davar min hatorah b'shev v'al ta'aseh</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In fact, the Chofetz Chaim (Likkutei Halachos, Pesachim) is <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=58595#p=109\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quoted</a> to the effect that the custom can't override the mitzvah, and that the fat should be eaten. (The relevant volume of Likkutei Halachos doesn't seem to be available on Hebrewbooks, unfortunately.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומשמע מהרמב״ם דא״צ רק לשייר הגיד ולא השומן,‏ דמותר לאכול שמנו של גיד בקדשים,‏ דאין מנהג בזה לעבור על בל תותירו,‏ ולבטל מ״ע דאכילה,‏ דהא סתם הרמב״ם ולא פירש כלל,‏ רק כתב שישליך גיה״נ וקרומית ותו לא</p>\n<p>The Rambam seems to imply that we need to leave over only the nerve itself, not the fat, and that it's permissible to eat the fat of the gid hanasheh of sacrifices, since a minhag can't allow us to violate the mitzvah not to leave anything over, or to abrogate the positive mitzvah to eat it. After all, the Rambam speaks in generalities, without specifying anything beyond that one has to dispose of the gid hanasheh and the [forbidden] membranes, nothing else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(This clearly doesn't comport with the statement in Pesachim 83b quoted in the question, that the fat can't be eaten. The above sefer goes on to quote R' Yosef Corcus, that the Rambam may understand Ravina in the Gemara there to be disagreeing with Rav Ashi. As for Rav Ashi, then, he might agree with the Minchas Chinuch quoted in Joel's answer, or with the answer below.)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=51848#p=150\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shiurei Mikdash David (Pesachim, sec. 6)</a> suggests that so long as a person doesn't consider something food (even if, for example, it's just because he's finicky), then halachah considers that dispositive, and he's not required to eat it. (Although, since objectively it is food, it has to be burned with the rest of the nosar.)</p>\n<p>In a comment, DoubleAA suggested that this last point might be implied in the Rambam's phrasing וצריך אדם להשתדל (\"a person has to make an effort\" not to leave anything over, implying something less than a full-fledged obligation). On the other hand, I see where there are various other explanations of what this phrasing implies.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, it returns to the original topic which [originally was mentioned] in the verse, \"And [Jacob] brought all his descendants with him to Egypt\" (Genesis 46:7). Afterwards it says there, \"And these are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt etc.\" <strong>This very verse is what is being repeated here, because even though they are two separate books (Genesis and Exodus), the story is connected with this one after that one....</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So perhaps we name the whole of the second book of the Torah as Shemos-'names' because it is the next link on from Bereishis. We concluded that book by listing by name the exile down to Egypt and these people/names and their ensuing families would experience the שעיבוד מצרים, the slavery and bondage that followed.</p>\n<p>And yet, despite this intensely bitter experience, the Jewish people remained true to who they were. A name is so much more than what a person is called. It represents a window into the soul.<sup>1</sup> Indeed, we know the Midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.32.5?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikrah Rabbah 32:5</a>) relates that one of the things they maintained throughout their slavery was their names (\"שֶׁלֹּא שִׁנּוּ אֶת שְׁמָם\") i.e. they did not change their names or call their children by Egyptian names. They maintained their identity throughout. They became a tzibbur through their own enclave in Goshen and then became a people with the exodus and ensuing Mattan Torah.</p>\n<p>As it writes <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/2116636/jewish/A-Summary-of-the-Book-of-Exodus.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> nicely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Hebrew the book is known as Sefer Shemot (“Book of Names”), because it opens with the verse, “These are the names of the children of Israel . . .” On a deeper level, this reflects the fact that it is the book in which our identity (name) as a nation is forged....The “Book of Names” begins with a nameless group of slaves, and ends with a G‑dly people, proudly bearing His name, honored to serve Him and make Him a home in this world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> The בעל שם טוב writes in פניני החסידות that the נשמה of a person is their central essence and when one looks at the אותיות הפנימיות, the central letters of the word \"נשמה\", you get \"שם\". Also refer to Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.7b.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 7b</a> that names can dictates one's future life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>All Parshiyos and sefarim of Chumash are named after the first significant word in the Parasha. So since it begins ואלה שמות, that is its name. Parshas Toldos also gets its name from its beginning, \"ואלה תולדות\". This name is only used by convention, so although the name is very common in midrashim, nobody feels the need to justify it.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Davar_on_Exodus%2C_Introduction_to_Exodus?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netziv</a> in his commentary on Chumash does mention other names to the book of Exodus: The Book of Redemption, which is pretty self-explanatory, and the more puzzling title of The Second Book, which he explains at length. See there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In his introduction to the book of Exodus, the Netziv relates alternative names which the book is known by. For example, he notes that the appellation ‘shemos’ is indeed employed in midrashic sources, such as Bereishis Rabbah 3.</p>\n<p>He likewise notes the Ramban’s title, ‘geulah’. He then continues to cite Bahag’s listing of the five books of the Torah as follows: Sefer Bereishis; Chumash Sheini; Sefer Kohanim; Chumash Hapikudim; Mishneh Torah. While the other four titles may seem familiar, the title ‘second’ given to the book of Exodus seems rather curious. For he should have either addressed them all in a numerical fashion, or named the book of Exodus based on one of its major events such as the exiting of Egypt or the giving of the Torah.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he explains, it is specifically titled book two because it is the second part of book one. Thus, all of the purpose bound up in the creation discussed in book one is only realized completely after the events subside and come to fruition in this second part of the book.</p>\n<p>[Based on this, it may be understood that the name shemos is equally important to reaching this end. Meaning, the purpose that is met in the climax of this book is only accomplished through the facilitators which bring about that goal. These are the ‘shemos’, names, with which the book begins.]</p>\n\n\n",

Is it permitted to make this crossbreed? One major authority contends that whether one may crossbreed buffalo and cattle depends on whether one is required to perform kisuy hadam, the mitzvah of covering the blood of shechitah, after slaughtering a buffalo. Kisuy hadam is required only on fowl and chayos but not on beheimos, such as cattle. If there is no requirement to perform kisuy hadam on buffalo, this demonstrates that it is considered a beheimah. Since there are only three species of beheimah -- sheep, goats, and cattle, then ruling that a buffalo does not require kisuy hadam means that halachah considers it to be a beheimah, and, if it is a beheimah, the process of elimination proves that it must be considered a variety of cattle, since it is certainly not a sheep or a goat.</p>\n<p><strong>Sefardim, Ashkenazim and buffalos</strong></p>\n<p>Is kisuy hadam required on a buffalo?

On the other hand, since the Rema is concerned that buffalo might be a variety of chayah, one would not be permitted to crossbreed it with cattle.</p>\n<p><strong>Halachic conclusion:</strong> According to the Aruch Hashulchan, a Sefardi would be permitted to crossbreed buffalo with cattle, and an Ashkenazi would not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>To answer question number two. Interestingly, according to one opinion, it is not the kosher status of the bison which makes the beefalo kosher, but the opposite.

See <a href=\"https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/a-meaty-question-is-bison-really-kosher/article_247e8148-3b2f-5627-9d08-160073f71283.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A possible way to circumvent the Chazon Ish's need for a tradition is based on the talmudic assertion that kosher and non-kosher species cannot crossbreed. Thus, if two species can hybridize, and one is known to be kosher, it is proof positive that the other is kosher as well. Since both the zebu and bison pass this \"hybridization test\" and produce live, fertile offspring with other domesticated cattle and both possess biblical indicia, both should be viewed as kosher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(Well I take that back -- <em>he shall stick to his wife</em> is seen as an early injunction against adultery, though framed as a yes-do not a don't-do.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>Yes, however, it is significant to note that during biblical times, there was no special marriage ceremony. The man simply took a woman and made her his wife in the bedroom (see Deuteronomy 24:1). This is why Jews sit under a canopy long enough to have sex, yichud, recalling the ancient practice.</p>\n<p>The command in Genesis 1:28, to “be fruitful and multiply,” could also mean to populate the earth that G-d had created. We see that after the flood, in Genesis 9:1, and 9:7, the command is to “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.”</p>\n\n\n",

At the same time, I have a friend who also sets up his phone in the same way. We place a phone call before the Sabbath on Friday, which is set to speaker phone, so I don't have to lift the phone during the Sabbath. Can we leave the phone running for the duration of the Sabbath, so that we can have a conversation?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>It seems that we are not interrupting the flow of electricity at any point in the process, as long as the phones do not die.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It doesn't seem that we are violating a prohibition against carrying.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It don't <em>think</em> that my cell phone is muktzeh, as it has been discussed in other questions on this site it can be used as a watch, and even so, I can use a simple stand to fix it, so that I do not have to touch it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My goal is to give a good representation of these views, since my peers are almost completely ignorant of Sabbath prohibitions at all.

Passover 2020 left a lot of people in total isolation for their Passover Seder, which is rough. Some Sephardic rabbis in Israel went back to their (grand)parents' position and allowed relatives to Zoom in; the major American (Ashkenazi) decisor, <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/950076/rabbi-hershel-schachter/piskei-corona-2-sick-in-isolation/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Hershel Schachter of Yeshiva University and OU Kosher wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a person were to leave the phone on before before Yom Tov and conduct a Pesach Seder from their\nhome so that others can follow along (like Baalei Teshuvah who may not know how to run a Seder)\nthere may be reason to be lenient under great and pressing circumstances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(In the Hebrew, he fills in more of the theory -- <em>this is because it is not clear precisely what the prohibition entailed would be</em> ...)</p>\n<p>Rabbi Schachter actually drew the line between audio-only (\"allowable in pressing circumstances\") and video (allowable only if there's risk to mental health), as creating images may be more prohibited.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/making-seder-out-of-the-zoom-seder-controversy/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Zuckier's summary of the subject</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>In short -- a lot of popularizers will want to tell you this is black-and-white no-way-no-how, but really when you check the sources it's dark gray.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I've heard the general reasoning that even though you may or may not be violating Shabbat, things should be abstained from in the spirit of Shabbat.

Here's what the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.46a.11-12?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud (Sanhedrin 46a)</a> says about the severity of those:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And an incident occurred involving one who rode a horse on Shabbat during the days of the Greeks, and they brought him to court and stoned him, not because he deserved that punishment, but because the hour required it, [as riding a horse on Shabbat is forbidden only by rabbinic decree, and people had become lax in their observance of Shabbat and therefore it became necessary to impose the severe punishment for a relatively minor offense].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shabbos-related Rabbinic decrees can be divided into two groups:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Distancing from possible Biblical transgressions</strong>, for example playing with or even holding materials that could lead to inflammation.</li>\n<li><strong>Preventing desecration of Shabbos day by performing weekday activities</strong>, like discussing business, reading newspapers, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Naturally, many disregard the latter, but this became the major reason for avoiding electronics on Shabbos in the Orthodox communities. More and more Rabbis agree, that as fine 21st-century electronics replace early 20th-century electricity that was all about making heat or closing circuits, we ran out of #1 reasons, and all that's left is preventing Shabbos from turning into just another day.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are cases of necessities that would override this reason, such as medical emergency but otherwise, this is prohibited.</p>\n\n\n",

According to Rabbi Leiman, by academics there's a general consensus, though, that the Torah portion of the Tanach was already established and canonized by the time of the Jewish/Samaritan schism, because the Samaritan biblical canon consists of only the Pentateuch.

Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai said: I have received a tradition from the seventy-two elders on the day when they appointed Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah head of the academy that the Song of Songs and Kohelet defile the hands. Rabbi Akiba said: Far be it! No man in Israel disputed that the Song of Songs [saying] that it does not defile the hands. For the whole world is not as worthy as the day on which the Song of Songs was given to Israel; for all the writings are holy but the Song of Songs is the holy of holies.

For this reason, <strong>this story is rejected</strong> as a mere fable by many of us <strong>and by almost all of the Hebrews; nor do they read it in their synagogues.</strong> \"For how could it be,\" it is argued, \"that captives had the authority to stone their own leaders and prophets?\" (<a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?redir_esc=y&id=uLRLgT-wXgIC&q=ahab#v=snippet&q=ahab&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clearly, by the time of Jerome (mid 4th to early 5th century CE), Shoshanah had already been rejected by the majority of Jews (although apparently some still clung to it), but it seems that there was a time in which it may have been included within Daniel (see first footnote).</p>\n<p>All of this is to say, that during the time of the DSS cult(s), the <em>Torah</em> was just about canonized (although there were still debates on certain specific phrases, for example, the Torah scrolls with variant phrases found in the Temple in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tractate_Soferim.6.4?vhe=Talmud_Bavli,_Vilna_1883_ed.&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sofrim 6:4</a>) but <em>the rest of the Tanach</em> - the Nevi'im and Ketuvim - were still being debated, and naturally, canonicity shifted between sects. And so, as rightly stated in the comments of your question, Appiah was referring to the Bible in its totality, not just to the Torah.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> As @DrShmuel mentioned, Rabbi Reuven Margaliyot's <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/he/pages/?&restore=1&t=1587320370333&pagenum=1&book=155132\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hamikra Vehamesora</a> (can also be purchased <a href=\"https://www.mosadharavkook.com/shop/%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90-%D7%95%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) is an excellent book that deals, among other things, the development of the Masoretic text.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> If I remember correctly, in the LXX, Shoshanah is included in Daniel and not as a separate book.</p>\n\n\n",

We derive this from the words of\nMoses’ warning “your entire territory,” i.e. not anyone else’s\nterritory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is the lesson of this seemingly irrelevant, albeit related, consequence included in the Torah's explanation of the plague? (If anything, it would seem that making peace with a rival country would be a welcomed element of the plague)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have no source for this idea, it's just a s'vara I had upon reading the midrash:</p>\n<p>Indeed, I think the intent of the midrash is to point to a welcomed element of plague, as you put it. I think the midrash is hinting towards an idea that's similar to multiple midrashim that say that when X did Y, this brought about Z. For example, the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.56b.14?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 56b</a> (and similarly brought in a number of other midrashim) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said: When Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter, the angel Gabriel descended from heaven and implanted a reed into the sea, and a sandbar grew around it, growing larger each year, and upon it the great city of Rome was built, which became God’s instrument to punish Israel.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Except that in the case of this midrash, A and B did something good which resulted in C - the Egyptians and the Cushim made peace among themselves, and what did that result in? The rise of Shishak.</p>\n<p>Let me explain:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thelehrhaus.com/scholarship/ahron-marcus-the-leading-hasidic-zionist-scholar-of-ancient-judaism-you-never-heard-of/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Ahron Marcus</a> wrote in an essay called \"Of The Jewish Chronology\" that Shishak (already then (early 20th century) identified with Pharaoh <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshenq_I\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoshenq</a>), the king of Egypt who had invaded Eretz Yisrael in the time of Rechav'am,  was Ethiopian,\nand that Zerach the Cushi, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.14.8?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">who fought King Asa</a>, was Shishak's son-in-law. Modern scholarship identifies Shishak/Shoshenq as Libyan in origin, but I think that Rabbi Marcus's point still stands: Shishak managed a very successful campaign during his time as king because he led a unified Egypt: Egyptians, Cushim and Libyans (Luvim in Tanach) fighting along one another under one banner. Shishak's army was successful in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshenq_I#Foreign_policy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">annexing territories as far as Syria</a>.</p>\n<p>Why did the Egyptians under Shishak merit such strength? In my opinion, based on the midrash, because at a time of hardship, during the makot, the Egyptians and Cushim decided to set aside their differences and make peace (and that during the time of Asa the reason they lost was because Yehudah's merit at the time was greater).</p>\n<p>The bottom line of the midrash seems to be that making peace, especially during hard times, is a catalyst for good things to come, even if the reward may be far in the future.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>So I saw a very nice idea <a href=\"https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/node/966\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> from Rav Matania Yedid of Bar Ilan</p>\n<p>He asks your exact question and explains that the purpose of mentioning this side point is to demonstrate the overarching Hashgacha (Providence) of Hashem in that the plague was designed to not only punish but also bring peace and therefore show the all-powerful might of G-d.</p>\n<p>The understanding being; that it was to act as a hint to Pharoah about what would be if he followed the direction of Hashem i.e. that whilst the frogs were indeed scattered on all the borders of Egypt, at the same time it could create peace with its neighbours, a hint from above to the possibility of civil war or world peace.</p>\n<p>He notes from Rav Tzadok of Lublin in his sefer <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14375&st=&pgnum=46&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machshavos Charutz</a> (letter ches-8) that Egypt's border was very narrow compared to the sea which is a great expanse. As per its name it is מיצר - narrow and constricted. Hashem was therefore teaching Egypt to discern the right borders, and not to spread beyond their borders. The slavery of the Jewish people was beyond the limit they deserved and therefore in the end the Egyptians were unable to restore them to their harsh servitude and even go as far as pursuing them to the Yam Suf. The result is that Hashem drowns these borders in the sea. Meaning, what began with the plagues of the frogs marking the borders, ends in the Red Sea with the complete blurring of the straits/borders/limits. And this is the message of the Pesach story that everyone can overcome there own personal limits and boundaries.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422614563.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Artscroll Midrash Rabbah</a> series on Shemos Rabbah (10:2) offers an unsourced footnote which addresses this question saying the borders of what belongs to one person and what belongs to another person are often unclear as we believe their good fortune comes at our own expense. However, when they suffer misfortune then the boundaries of life become clear since the Almighty is the one Who gives talent and resources as well as carefully measures suffering within each individual's \"borders.\"</p>\n\n\n",

The aim of this answer is to provide a hopefully comprehensive coverage of ideas discussed and not in any way to pasken Halacha.</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Halachot_Related_to_Coronavirus#Vaccine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachapedia</a> it writes the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some poskim advise saying the bracha of Hatov Vehameitiv when receiving the vaccine because it is good news for everyone. It is made upon the first vaccine.* Additionally, everyone agrees that one should recite the tefillah for doing any medical procedure. The text is: יהי רצון מלפניך ה' אלקי שיהא עסק זה לרפואה כי רופא חנם אתה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>*The footnote there reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rav Schachter</strong> in a shiur (<a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/sidebar/lecture.cfm/981904/rabbi-hershel-schachter/mikeitz-5781/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Miketz 5781, min 63-4</a>) and also an interview after he and Rabbi Willig received the vaccine. <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/sidebar/lecture.cfm/982201/rabbi-aryeh-lebowitz/ten-minute-halacha-should-one-recite-a-beracha-or-say-a-tefilah-on-receiving-the-covid-vaccine-/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Aryeh Lebowitz</a> agreed and explained it further. <strong>Rav Asher Weiss</strong> felt that no bracha is made upon it. <strong>Rav Shlomo Aviner</strong> (Tevet 5 5781, Sheilat Shlomo p. 682) also thought no bracha is recited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Dov Linzer <a href=\"https://library.yctorah.org/lindenbaum/should-i-make-a-brakha-when-receiving-the-covid-19-vaccine/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> when analysing the correct bracha posits as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As these moments are moments of joy, the brakha that one should recite would be the standard one that is recited when a joyous event occurs – either She’hehiyanu, when it is just she who is experiencing the joy, or HaTov Vi’ha’meitiv (hereafter, HaTov), if her joy is shared with others.</p>\n<p>In our case, HaTov would be preferred over She’hehiyanu. When a person receives a vaccine, it is good for other people as well – the fewer people who get sick, the better off we all are. However, the benefit that those others are receiving is of a different sort – they are not being directly protected – and some poskim are generally leery of saying HaTov when the shared nature of the benefit is not so black- and-white. There is also the general consensus among poskim that She’hehiyanu works even in cases which call for HaTov (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Biur_Halacha.223.5.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beur Halakha, OH 223:5</a>). So reciting She’hehiyanu is definitely an acceptable choice, and for some would be the preferred choice (not to mention that, experientially, people are much more emotionally connected to She’hehiyanu than to HaTov).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whilst he sides with saying HaTov V'hameitiv he adds...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So far, we have only been considering She’hehiyanu and HaTov. My esteemed colleague, Rabbi Ysoscher Katz, however, as well as others, have argued that the proper blessing to be recited at this time would be HaGomel, the blessing that we recite when a person recovers from an illness or returns from a dangerous sea journey. There is much to recommend this approach. The blessing of HaGomel is said when a person is saved from a state of danger or fear for one’s safety. It is a blessing of redemption. She’hehiyanu and its counterpart, HaTov, in contrast, are blessings most often said in times of joy which go beyond our normal, acceptable – or generally good – state of being. It is not a blessing that we associate with being saved from a precarious situation. The one exception to this that I know of, is the recitation of She’hehiyanu (or HaTov) at a time when the rains come, which, according to Shulkhan Arukh (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.221.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OH 221:1</a>) refers to a case when it rains after a period of drought.  Receiving rain during a period of drought is truly a case of being saved from desperate conditions. Others posit, however, that the case of reciting She’hehiyanu when the rains come refers to a case of plentiful rain, when there is great joy (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.221.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arukh HaShulkhan 221:2</a>), making this recitation of She’hehiyanu just like all the others. According to this latter framing, She’hehiyanu is only said at moments of joy beyond the norm, and never when one is saved from a bad or dangerous situation. While this position is compelling, as a matter of halakha we embrace Shulkhan Arukh’s position, and recite She’hehiyanu when the rains come after a drought. It for this reason that we focus here on the blessings of She’hehiyanu and HaTov as the ones to be recited, despite the fact that ours is not the standard case regarding these blessings.</p>\n<p>To rule that one should recite HaGomel in our case would require one to adopt the position that HaGomel may or should be recited at any time when one is saved from danger, even if the person was not one of the four types explicitly mentioned by the Rabbis (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.54b.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhot 54b</a>), namely, a person who returns from a dangerous sea journey; returns from crossing the desert; recovers from an illness; and who is released from prison. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.219.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulkhan Arukh (OH 219:9)</a> sides with this more expansive approach and does not limit the brakha to these cases specifically. Although in the end he recommends that when it is not one of the four cases specifically mentioned, one should recite the blessing without using God’s name, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.219.32?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Brurah (OH 219:32)</a> states that the consensus of the later poskim is that we should follow Shulkhan Arukh’s first and primary opinion and recite HaGomel in any case analogous to those four.</p>\n<p>The reason that I do not explore here the possibility of reciting HaGomel, as compelling as that possibility may be, is that I generally adopt the more conservative approach that limits HaGomel to the four cases listed in the Talmud, although there is good reason, both halakhically and religiously, to not adopt such a limiting approach. More to the point, however, is that I also question whether the experiences of those who never had COVID and are now being vaccinated can be compared to a person who was seriously ill (even if not with a life-threatening illness) or who crossed a desert. In those cases, when ill or in the desert, there is an acute awareness at every moment of the dangerous and precarious situation that one is in, and the transition from being in the desert or at sea to having returned home is sudden and clearly demarcated (although admittedly less so in the case of recovering from an illness). In those cases, when one exits the state of danger or illness, he feels as if he has been saved. Our situation, by contrast, is one of an individual or community that has now been vaccinated and will now, over time, be relatively freer from the constraints that the virus has imposed. It does not seem to me that there will be a similar sense of salvation here when one receives a vaccine shot. Relief, yes. Joy, yes, possibly. But not salvation. I do think, however, that we should definitely consider the ha’Gomel blessing when enough people are vaccinated that society can move back to something close to normal. That, I believe, will feel like going from darkness to light. It will feel like salvation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, Rav Rimon <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/46176\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> also gives a thorough overview and repeats some of the ideas already mentioned. His conclusions are that one can choose a number of approaches as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>HaTov V'hameitiv can be said at the time of receiving the vaccine, to welcome the invention of the vaccine and its arrival in the State of Israel, and the rescue of the people of Israel and the world, and the return of the economy and life to their course. This is good news not only on the medical level but especially on returning to routine - a general joy that has a lot of physical pleasure (in principle you can greet right now, but you can attach the greeting to the actual vaccine).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It is better to say \"She'hechiyanu\", and to do like the leading psak that make this blessing even for the joy of the heart (and provided that the person is indeed happy). In this bracha the emphasis is more on the personal good of each vaccinated person, so it is said only when receiving the vaccine.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Another way is to say before the vaccination instead of the brachos the following wording (as written in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.60a.28?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 60a</a> & <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.230.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch OC 230:4</a>, and similarly one who makes the bracha of She'hechiyanu or Hatov V'hameitiv it is better they say this)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יהי רצון מלפניך ה‘ אלקי, שיהא עסק זה לי ולכל בית ישראל ולכל בריותיך לרפואה שלמה ולמיגור המגפה, כי א-ל מלך רופא נאמן ורחמן אתה</p>\n<p>May it be Your will, O Lord my G-d, that this enterprise be for healing and that You should heal me and for all the house of Israel and for all your creatures for complete healing and for the eradication of the plague, for G-d is a King, a faithful and merciful Healer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In all cases, it is appropriate to say <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.100?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 100</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.30?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 30</a>, or Nishmas kol chai.</p>\n\n\n",

What does the name mean?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.49.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 49:10</a> which uses a verb that shares the same root is perhaps a good starting point. It writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹֽא־יָס֥וּר שֵׁ֙בֶט֙ מִֽיהוּדָ֔ה וּמְחֹקֵ֖ק מִבֵּ֣ין רַגְלָ֑יו עַ֚ד כִּֽי־יָבֹ֣א שילה [שִׁיל֔וֹ] וְל֖וֹ <strong>יִקְּהַ֥ת</strong> עַמִּֽים׃</p>\n<p>The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet; So that tribute shall come to him And the homage of peoples be his. (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see it contains the word \"יִקְּהַ֥ת\" which has the same etymology as the name Kehas.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Genesis.49.10.2?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Ramban</strong></a> helps provide a clear definition and brings numerous examples of the same word, and starts be explaining it in the context of the verse above, as <strong>\"אסיפת העמים\" - \"the gathering of the nations\"</strong>. He then questions it though and explores other options. He writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[With regard to the phrase, \"nations will gather (yikehas),\" Rashi explains that it means,] \"<strong>a gathering of nations</strong>, as it is stated (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.11.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshaya 11:10</a>) 'Unto him shall the nations seek.' Of similar meaning is the word in (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.30.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 30:17</a>) 'The eye that mocks the father, and despises the gathering of (yikehas) the mother,' [as it means] the gathering of wrinkles on her face due to her old age. And in the Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.110b.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 110b</a>), [we find a similar meaning of this word]: 'They gathered assemblies (mekahu kehiasa - Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.110b.12?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Yevamot.110b.12.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> there for this variant version) in the streets of Nehardea.” It could have also said an assembly (kehias) of nations [in the verse, instead of yikehas.\" That is] the language of Rashi. And it does not appear that \"the gathering of (yikehas) of the mother\" can be explained as the assembly of the mother. And also the expression, \"mekahu kehiasa\" is only an expression of refutations and challenges, as they would be challenging and refuting it with many questions. Since one who has difficulty with something is called kohehin the language of the sages (Talmudic Aramaic); as they said in Midrash Chazit (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 3:8), \"'All of them brandishing the sword' - that they would all learn the law like a sword: that if a matter came to their hands, the law would not be challenging (koheh) to them.\" And so too are there many [other examples] there. And from [this usage], they said in the gemara (Nazir 65b), \"Rabbi Yehoshua kihet and purified [it],\" as he challenged many things about it and broke all of the [arguments] that were making it impure, until he forcibly purified it. And so [too], we have found in old textual variants of the gemara (Bava Metzia 52a), \"One who kehi for a coin is called an evil soul,\" since he is exacting about it and is challenged to get it from his friend. And the grammarians (Radak and R. Yonah Ibn Jenach) say that the root of yikehas is yakeh, and that its understanding is [that it is] <strong>an expression of discipline and acceptance of command</strong>, [such that] \"the nations yikehas\" is that they will listen to him and do everything that he will command upon them. [And] \"he despises the yikehas of the mother\" is [that he despises] to accept her command. And that which is correct in my eyes is that it is from the usage (based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.31.29?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 31:29</a>), 'One who eats unripe grapes, his teeth will tikahena.' And its root is kehas, and the [first letter,] yod in it is like the yod [at the beginning of] yitshar. And the matter of all [of its usages] is <strong>weakness and breaking</strong>: It is saying [here] that the rod of the taskmaster will not depart from Yehudah until his son, who [brings] the weakness of the nations and their breaking, arrives - as he will weaken all of them with the blade of the sword. And so [too], \"If the iron kehah\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.10.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Koheles 10:10</a>) - that it has become weak and cannot cut, like a knife \"that has sat,\" in the language of the sages (Beitzah 28b), or that has become a little broken and has nicks in it. And so [too] did I also find there in Midrash Chazit (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1:12), \"The Holy One, blessed be He, made appear a good scent from the spices of the Garden of Eden, and their souls were (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 3:8) koheh to eat. They said to him, 'Moshe, our teacher, give us what to eat.' He said to them, 'So did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to me, \"all sons of foreigners may not eat from it.\"' They stood up and separated the foreigners from among them and their souls were koheh to eat, etc.\" And the matter is that their souls were weakened and broken in their bodies from the greatness of their desire to eat from the Pesach sacrifice in which the good smell had cleaved. And so [too], \" the law would not be koheh to them,\" [means that] it be weak and unsure in their hands. And \"mekahu kehiata\" is [that] they would ask challenging questions that would weaken the soul, because of their great effort (pain) and research. Or it is an expression of breaking and refuting, like the expression (Kiddushin 13b), \"Rav Acha refuted.\" And so [too] did they say (Mekhilta, Parshat Bo 18), \"You too should hekaheh his teeth\" - [which means] break them or weaken them with your words. [It must also mean weaken] as unripe grapes weaken, and do not break; but weakening and breaking are the same [general] idea, and kehiah includes both of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So from this the name Kehas could conceivably mean one of three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An expression of <strong>gathering</strong></li>\n<li>An expression of <strong>acceptance</strong></li>\n<li>An expression of <strong>weakness / breaking</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

As a result (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.32.23?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">32(23)</a>), if a letter is missing there is no way to fix it later. But if a letter is extra, it can be erased, leaving the remaining letters in order.<br />\nHowever, if the erased letter is in the middle of a word, removing it divides the word in two. That can only be fixed if the previous letter can be stretched to fill the gap, like with a reish, see the nos'ei keilim there.<br />\nYou can't stretch the <em>following</em> letter on the left, or other letters, because you'd need to erase at least one letter first to make way [or at least enough of it to ruin its tzurah: think of erasing the vertical of a reish in order to move it over and then stretch it back to meet the top], and then when it is rewritten we would be שלא כסדרן again.<br />\nThey do suggest that sometimes you can \"thicken\" the letters before and after slightly, enough to fill in the gap so that the word no longer appears divided.<br />\nOf course, that won't help much if a couple of words were extra; you'll still have a big gap that looks like a פתוחה or סתומה that shouldn't be there.  Again you're going to need some reishes and such (להדר\"ת or whatever you hold may be stretched) in just the right places.<br />\nSo I was wondering: Does anyone suggest the idea of <em>shifting</em> the letters bit by bit: thickening them a little on one side, then shaving them on the other, then repeating, being careful never to destroy their tzurah? It would seem to me that you could move letters or even words over that way, making way for the stretchable letters to fill the remaining gaps, without losing כסדרן.<br />\nIs this a) a known technique, b) works but it's way too much trouble to be worth it, or c) forbidden and if so why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>This is a known technique.

Nusach Chabad also says Malchus HaRisha. How is this \"Malchus\" to be understood? Is it to be understood as a political Malchus (ie. The arrogant/wicked kingdom) or as a more metaphysical power of evil (ie. the kingship/sovereignty of arrogance/wickedness)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The nusach mentioning malchut is also found in the Sfardi text and appears in the ancient nusachot found in the Cairo Geniza.   Therefor it seems to me that on a simple pshat level the Malchut referred to in the original version is a reference to Rome, which makes sense from a historical perspective.\nHowever within a kabbalistic context, Malchut ha Zadon or ha Risha is a reference to the Malcut of the Sitra Achra \"זה כנגד זה ברא אלקים\" And the prayer, in terms of kabbalistic kavanot, is intended to bring the aspect of Keter to the Malchut of Kedusha because that is the only one of the 10 sfirot that the Malchut of the Sitra Achra doesn't have access to. The Ari Z\"L explains that until there was a predominance of heretics within the Jewish world this prayer was not needed. Which is why it was written at the time that Christianity began to become a problem.\nThe original nusach contained the words: \"May the Nazarenes (ha-naẓarim/noṣrim/notzrim)[v][w] and the sectarians (minim) perish as in a moment\".\nThe question is what we today should have in mind on a simple pshat level when referring in our prayers to the \"Malchut ha Zadon\" is a good question and I suppose the answer would depend on who you ask !</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The whole idea of the Keter of Nukva in the Sitra Achra is a very deep idea that requires much explanation.\nIt is beyond the scope of this site to be able to answer it thoroughly.  However in brief my understanding is that there are two aspects of Malchut.  The Malchut of which is active in the Hanhaga now is not the original Malchut.  The original Malchut has been concealed until the final redemption.   I have only found this idea discussed at length in the writings of R.Ashlag however the Vilna Goan also discusses it in his perush of the Sifra d'tzniuta.<br />\nI am not sure I understand the rest of your question because you are translating words into English and that changes the meaning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is unambiguously and unequivocally a reference to Edom which in the days this bracha was formulated was understood to be the Roman Empire.

Per his calculations, we can see that an eight-generation jump from a small group of 5-10 people to a couple million isn't such a wild thought. The miracle of Bnei Yisrael was one, some or all of the following: None of the children died, every mother had at least six children (above-average), they managed to reach 2-3 million within seven generations (meaning, less than eight).</p>\n<p>As to <em>who</em> they were, the answer to that actually fits quite well with the Torah: Egypt was, indeed, divided between different peoples. For many years there were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_and_Lower_Egypt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">two kingdoms</a>, which fits with the Hebrew name of Egypt, Mitzrayim (מצרים) - plural of metzar (מצר) - two metzarim (שני מצרים), because there were two kingdoms at first.<sup>2</sup> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Dynastic_Period_(Egypt)#Cultural_evolution\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">At the time</a>, there was much warring between the different kingdoms and groups within the kingdoms. According to Josephus in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/The_Antiquities_of_the_Jews.1.6.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Antiquities 1:6:2</a>, not much is known about the original families of Mitzrayim because their cities were destroyed in a war with Ethiopia. We see from here that Josephus had information that Egypt was at first divided between the different groups that descended from Mitzrayim. The Patrusim, for example, were probably a group that settled in southern Egypt, as the word Patrosi in Egyptian means \"the southern land\" (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathros\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>).</p>\n<p>Later, Egypt was unified into one kingdom, but echoes of the divided past of the land can still be found here and there in the Tanach. A few examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In Canaan there was a place called \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/search?q=%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%9F%20%D7%9E%D7%99%20%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%97&tab=text&tpathFilters=Tanakh&tvar=1&tsort=relevance&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'ayan Mei Naftoach</a>\" - this was not long after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan#Late_Bronze_Age_(1550%E2%80%931200)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Egyptians had lost control of Canaan</a>, so the place was perhaps named after the Naftuchim<sup>3</sup>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Egypt was sometimes referred to as \"Rahav\", which may be a play on Lahav (being that the Egyptians <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">didn't have an L in their alphabet</a>), for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.87.4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 87:4</a>:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I mention Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge Me; Philistia, and Tyre, and Cush—each was born there.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Egyptian warriors are referred to as Ludim.

It is possible that the Pharaoh at the time of Yosef was so welcoming to Yosef's family because like him, they were Semites and shepherd people (the Hyksos were shepherds originally). Some believe that the sudden change in treatment of Bnei Yisrael by the pharaohs is related to the overthrowing of the Hyksos kings and the return of native Egyptian control of Egypt, and we know from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.43.32?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet 43:32</a> that the Egyptians didn't quite like the Hebrews.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> To access it, go to <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/eng\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this page</a>, right-click on the title of the essay and select Save Link As, which will allow you to download it.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Similarly, Rabbi Yehudah Hachassid said on the verse \"And Mizraim begot the Ludim, the Anamim\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.10.13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet 10:13</a>) (my translation): \"Why were they called in plural form?

One answer to this question can be found in the commentary of the Maharzu (Rabbi Zev Wolf Einhorn; a particularly comical error on his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/person/Zev%20Wolf%20Einhorn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">biographical entry on Sefaria</a> lists him as having lived for close to 400 years, which is ironic, since we are citing his comments about Yocheved, but I digress). Midrash Rabbah Bamidbar 3:6 (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>) states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דָּבָר אַחֵר, אֱלֹהִים מוֹשִׁיב יְחִידִים, מִי הָיָה זֶה עַמְרָם וְיוֹכֶבֶד, בִּזְכוּת לְהוֹצִיא אֲסִירִים בַּכּוֹשָׁרוֹת, אֵלּוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל, שֶׁהָיוּ מְשֻׁעְבָּדִים בְּמִצְרַיִם. מֶה עָשָׂה הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא זִוֵּג יוֹכֶבֶד לְעַמְרָם בִּכְדֵי שֶׁיַּעֲמֹד מֵהֶם גּוֹאֵל וְיִגְאַל יִשְׂרָאֵל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, this Midrash claims that they merited to be paired together with each other because they were \"Yechidim\". Maharzu (in his commentary there; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Perush_Maharzu_on_Bamidbar_Rabbah.3.6.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>) explains that this word implies greatness, and finds traits of Amaram's and Yocheved's to match it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יחידים לשון גדולה כנ\"ל על שעמרם שהיה גדול הדור כמ\"ש שמ\"ר פר\"א סי' כ\"ב ויוכבד יחידה בדורה בת לוי שעל ידי זה מוציא אסירים:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Yechidim\" is language of greatness, as it was mentioned earlier about Amram, that he was the \"Gadol Hador\" (Shemot Rabbah 1:22) and Yocheved was unique in her generation as the daughter of Levi, and through this, they merited to take out the captives...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, the Talmud in Sotah (11b, Davidson Edition translation; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.11b.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>) appears to write explicitly that Yocheved (identified by the Talmud there as one of the midwives) merited Aharon and Moshe for her role in saving Jewish children:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(שמות א, כא) ויהי כי יראו המילדות את האלהים ויעש להם בתים רב ושמואל חד אמר בתי כהונה ולויה וחד אמר בתי מלכות <strong>מ\"ד בתי כהונה ולויה אהרן ומשה</strong> ומ\"ד בתי מלכות דוד נמי ממרים קאתי דכתיב (דברי הימים א ב, יט) ותמת עזובה (אשת כלב) ויקח לו כלב את אפרת ותלד לו את חור וכתיב (שמואל א יז, יב) ודוד בן איש אפרתי וגו'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The verse relates the midwives’ reward: “And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses” (Exodus 1:21). Rav and Shmuel disagree as to the precise interpretation of these houses: One says that God made the houses of the priesthood and the Levites descend from the midwives, and one says that God made the houses of royalty descend from them. <strong>The one who says that it is referring to the houses of the priesthood and the Levites is referring to Aaron and Moses, who were sons of Jochebed.</strong> And the one who says that it is referring to houses of royalty is referring to David, who also comes from Miriam, as it is written: “And Azubah,” the wife of Caleb, “died, and Caleb took to him Ephrath, who bore him Hur” (I Chronicles 2:19) and, as will be explained further, Ephrath is Miriam. And it is written: “David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah” (I Samuel 17:12). Therefore, he was a descendant of Miriam.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Edit: This addition was prompted by Dov's answer - as per the verse that the Talmud cites there, it was Yocheved's fear of G-d that was rewarded by Hashem according to the Talmud, which is not necessarily the same as her saving Jewish children.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.1.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos Rabbah 1:16</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לְפִי שֶׁיָּרְאָה יוֹכֶבֶד מִפְּנֵי הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא, הֶעֱמִיד מִמֶּנָּה משֶׁה</p>\n<p>Because Yocheved feared Hashem, he brought forth Moshe from her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition, the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.55b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 55b</a> tells us that Amram never sinned in his lifetime (he died only due to the counsel of the snake). The Maharal in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14194&st=&pgnum=60&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chiddushei Aggados</a> (2nd paragraph) on this Gemara in Shabbos writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מה שהיה עמרם אבי משה, אשר היה משה שקול נגד כל ישראל, לא יצה למשה לפעל רק על ידי מי שהוא ישר</p>\n<p>How was Amram the father of Moshe who was equal to all of Israel, Moshe would not have come out in actuality unless from someone who was upright...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Maharal says expressly that Amram had to have been incredibly righteous and upright otherwise he would never have never been zoche to have such a child like Moshe. It was is perfect character that gave rise to such a child.</p>\n\n\n",

To compensate them for slavery, as the Torah later says must be done for all freed slaves?  But what use did they have for riches when facing the desert?  All they needed was God's guidance and provision for their material needs.  And we know what they ended up doing with this gold: Build an idol.  Moses even castigates God for that in the Talmud:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Master of the Universe, the gold and silver that you lavished upon Israel ... is what caused Israel to make the Golden Calf. [Berakhot 32a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note God's \"dabber <strong>na</strong>\" -- \"speak, <strong>please</strong>\".  It's an entreaty.  The Israelites were not inclined to ask for these riches.  Also, they were in such a hurry that they didn't have time for the dough to rise, yet they had enough time to ask for silver, gold and jewels from the Egyptians?</p>\n<p>I know God promised these riches to Abraham [Genesis 15:14].

Although I would recommend reading the entire section to really appreciate Ran's idea, here is the section that directly addresses it (Rabbi Silverstein translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולזאת הסבה עצמה צוה וישאלו איש מאת רעהו. שעם היות שממונם היה מותר להם ויכולין לקחתו, צוה שיבאו בעקבה, שאע\"פ שיהיה זה לישראל דבר זר, ולזה אמרו דבר נא באזני העם ואין נא אלא לשון בקשה, והוא כאמרו ידעתי שהם אנשי חיל שלא יחפצו במרמות ותוך, עם כל זה תחלה פניהם בשמי שיעשו ככה ולא ישאלו למה, וכאשר הוגד למלך מצרים ולעמו שישראל בורחים אין ספק שחשדום באנשי דמים ומרמה. שאל\"כ למה יתנכלו אליהם בדברים האלה, וכל זה הגיעם בלי ספק לרדפם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And it is for this reason itself that He directed \"that they ask each man of his neighbor…\" For though the Egyptian money was theirs and they could have taken it by force, He directed that they take it by stealth, even though this would seem exceedingly strange to the Jews. This is the intent of: \"Speak, I pray you [na], in the ears of the people.\" \"Na\" is a term of imploration (Berachoth 9a). It is as if to say: \"I know them to be courageous men, who are averse to deceit and guile. Still, implore them in My name that they do as I ask and not ask the reason.\" And when the king of Egypt and his people were told that the Jews were fleeing, there is no doubt that they suspected them of being \"men of blood and deceit.\" For if this were not the case, why should they have schemed against them in this manner? And all of this was certainly cause for them to pursue the Jews. For if Moses had commanded at the outset that they send the Jews away and not pursue them and give them their wages as well, there is no question that they would not have stirred from their places. And the motive for all of these things was hidden from the Jews — and possibly, even from Moses himself. For this reason there was certainly cause for them to begin to doubt the embassy of Moses, though they had believed in it implicitly in the beginning. And this is intimated in (Ibid 14:31): \"And Israel saw the mighty hand…\" That is, then they recognized that all that had been hidden from them until then and had given them cause for doubt was only a ploy to cause the Egyptians to enter the sea of themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>Berachot 9a-b</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבר נא באזני העם וגו׳ אמרי דבי רבי ינאי אין נא אלא לשון בקשה אמר ליה הקדוש ברוך הוא למשה בבקשה ממך לך ואמור להם לישראל בבקשה מכם שאלו ממצרים כלי כסף וכלי זהב שלא יאמר אותו צדיק ועבדום וענו אתם קיים בהם ואחרי כן יצאו ברכוש גדול לא קיים בהם אמרו לו ולואי שנצא בעצמנו משל לאדם שהיה חבוש בבית האסורים והיו אומרים לו\nבני אדם מוציאין אותך למחר מבית האסורין ונותנין לך ממון הרבה ואומר להם בבקשה מכם הוציאוני היום ואיני מבקש כלום</p>\n<p>Speak now [na] in the ears of the people, etc. In the school of R.

I am of average dimensions, 5'10'', and I measured my arm. Bent, 10 cm from elbow to end of muscle. Half of that is 5 cm = way less than four etzbaos = not nearly enough room for two tefillos. Straight, 15 cm / 2 = 7.5 cm, more-or-less enough room for two tefillos of two etzbaos each, or one big one of four.<br />\nSo I ask you. How is that no one (that I saw) from around the time of the Mishnah Berurah even discussed the fact that for normal people a tefillah shel yad of four etzbaos is way too big to wear? It's certainly too big for me. Chabad has apparently been using them for a long time, and never noticed a problem. We are all strict to put them on the bottom half of the muscle, we all have pretty big tefillin these days, and until twenty years ago no one noticed that they don't fit!<br />\nThe easiest conclusion is that the muscle is measured with the arm extended, in which case I would have enough room for one tefillah of 4 or two of 2, and so would most others.</p>\n<p>There may be other solutions. Since the present situation is a combination of chumros, perhaps all poskim happened to hold in ways, different ways, that avoid the issue. The Gr\"a and most Rishonim may just have put the tefillah in the middle of the muscle. Pretty much everyone else may have used smaller tefillin till recently and held that the hand tefillin isn't two etzbaos. If so, maybe only Chabad need hold that the muscle is measured extended. The rest of us might be stuck, trapped between several chumros with no way to wear our large tefillin.<br />\nIt would still be surprising that no one discussed the issue.

In the name of Rav Heineman that it depends on whether all its nutrients are from the dead animal. The Cordyceps mushroom which in nature is complelty dependent on the catappilar it takes over is not kosher because <em>kol hayotzim meihatami tamei</em>. Though at the time only cordyceps mushroom was described as not kosher so I am not sure if there is any other mushroom it applies to.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Misreading a k'suva",
    "content": "# Misreading a k'suva\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketubah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>k'suva</em></a> text varies slightly depending on whether the bride is a virgin, independent of whether she has been married previously. (For one thing, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/16326\">the amount of money mentioned in it is different</a>; for another, the word \"בתולתא\" is omitted from the <em>k'suva</em> of a non-virgin.) Now, there's a custom to read the <em>k'suva</em> aloud during the wedding ceremony. I have heard that, in the case of a non-virgin bride whose non-virginity may be a source of shame (e.g., she has never been married), the person reading the <em>k'suva</em> aloud reads it wrong deliberately, reciting instead the text of a virgin's <em>k'suva</em>, so that no one else hears that the bride is a non-virgin. I am looking for a source that indicates that that custom (of deliberately misreading the <em>k'suva</em>) is appropriate, inappropriate, practiced, or not practiced, or any source or provenance for it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>For starters: in Ashkenazic custom (which I think the questioner was assuming), the kesubah has already been signed (i.e. executed) before the chupah, so the reading is nothing more than a pause between parts of the ceremony. It's accomplishing nothing of a halachic nature any more than reading the latest stock numbers would be, hence many rabbis have been lenient in exactly what's read.</p>\n<p>This gets a bit trickier in the Sephardic world as the witnesses are signing it <em>on the spot</em>, under the chupah. They're announcing it as it's executed. It could seem weird to proclaim you're executing a document with terms A when you're secretly executing a document with terms B. I don't know what Sephardic rabbis would say about this.</p>\n<p>Just to clarify: if a woman was born Jewish and never previously married, and was never involved with a non-Jewish man, then the appropriate word to both read and write is in fact <em>besulta</em>.</p>\n<p>Igros Moshe OC4:118 -- addressing a religiously-serious young woman trying to repent for what she did in college:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jJFqO.jpg\" alt=\"Excerpt from Igros Moshe OC 4:118\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the writing of the kesubah, there is no need to tell the officiating rabbi (about the bride's past actions) -- once the groom signs on the kesubah he has agreed to the kesuba of a <em>besula</em>, even if she really isn't, so long as she's not misleading him, as he has agreed to obligate himself in the kesuba amount of a <em>besula</em> ... and if she marries the fellow with whom he she had relations, it is more proper to write <em>besula</em>, as explained in EH 101, and the rabbi [discussed in that responsum] acted properly.</p>\n<p>Even if she had relations with a different man than the one she is now marrying, if the relations were with a legitimate Jew than she is still kohen-eligible and hence this affects no laws, only a monetary sum  - if the groom knows this and opts for the kesuba of a <em>besula</em>, they can write it as such -- and therefore [the couple] <em>should not</em> tell the officiating rabbi -- nor anyone else [about the bride's past indiscretions], as I have written above [we don't believe in confessing sins to human beings!].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The questions come up when it's not widely known that the bride was divorced, widowed (very unlikely), converted, or had a non-Jewish boyfriend at some point. (In the latter case ideally <em>it'sa</em> is written if that's actually known, though don't ask me how often rabbis actually ask about this.)</p>\n<p>Rabbi JD Bleich has a yutorah mp3 in which he says if the bride is visibly pregnant, you can still in theory write <em>besulta</em>, but if so the rabbi shouldn't sign as a witness on the kesubah. While technically valid, it makes the rabbi's personal credibility look shaky.</p>\n<p>As to your question, I suspect a lot of this remains oral tradition, not written down, for obvious reasons; I was told of an instance where Rabbi Yaakov Kaminetsky had someone write a dummy kesubah for the purposes of reading, and I spoke with a seasoned moreh hora'ah who had a similar instance where he said \"who says that what's written there is what you have to read?\"</p>\n<p>Afraid I don't have written sources.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is an excellent question that is best asked to your local Orthodox rabbi.</p>\n<h1>1</h1>\n<p>One important aspect of the question, which should not be minimized, is the public humiliation to the bride, who will be mortified that her lack of virginity will be revealed to her friends and family. <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%AA_%D7%A4%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chazal say</a> (Berachot 43b) about embarrassing someone in public that it better to cast oneself into a fiery furnace, that one who embarrasses someone in public has no share in the world to come (Avos 3:11) and that it is comparable to shedding of blood (Bava Metzia 58b). On a day that everyone has an obligation to cause the bride and groom to rejoice, to cause a measure of public humiliation would seem non-ideal, to say the least.</p>\n<h1>2</h1>\n<p>Another important aspect of the question is the halachic importance of reading the Ketuba under the chuppa. Rav Herschel Schachter traced the development of this practice through the Geonim and Rishonim, and concludes that it has a mere status of hefek. <a href=\"http://www.torahweb.org/torah/2004/parsha/rsch_dvorim2.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Thus</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, even if a parrot or a monkey would read the kesuba, the marriage would be one hundred percent valid. Strictly speaking,the reading of the kesuba is <strong>not at all</strong> a part of the marriage ceremony. This minhag was introduced in the days of the rishonim after the geonim had done away with the ancient practice of having a long pause (of several months) between the erusin and the nissuin. When a young girl would be married for the first time, the pause would be \"a yohr un a mitvoch\". The date for the chuppah would be set for the first Wednesday following the entire year after the erusin (see Talmud Kesubos 2a). In the days of the Talmud there would have been no objection if \"borei pri hagoffen\" would have been recited over the cup of wine used for the six brachas of nissuin, despite the fact that that same bracha had already been recited in connection with the cup of wine used for the \"birchas erusin\" <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%AA_%D7%A4%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1</a>, because there was a pause of <strong>months</strong> in between the two occasions. However, once the geonim introduced the practice of having the nissuin follow <strong>immediately</strong> after the erusin, the reciting of the blessing of borei pri hagoffen the second time seems very strange! There was no longer a pause of several <strong>months</strong> between the two brachos, but merely a pause of <strong>a few moments</strong>, and the reciting of the second bracha really seems absolutely unnecessary! This is what prompted the rishonim to institute the slow reading of the kesuba in between the erusin and the nissuin, to establish a hefsek between the two \"brachos al hakos\", so that the second borei pri hagoffen will not seem so superfluous. It is for this reason that many have the practice that if someone is scheduled to speak under the chuppah, or if a chazzan is going to sing something, that these take place right after the reading of the kesuba. The greater the pause, the better. Some rabbis have the practice of reading the kesuba very quickly. I remember that when Rav Eliezer Silver zt\"l would be called upon to read the kesuba at a chasuna, he would do so very slowly. Since the whole purpose of krias hekesuba is to introduce a pause between the brachos over the two cups of wine, the longer the pause - the better! (See Beikvei Hatzohn pg. 268.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>3</h1>\n<p>If it is a mere hefsek, a pause, then it stands to reason that one can (and should!) change what is publicly read into the microphone, so long as the ketuba itself is written properly, and the eidim and husband understand what is really going on. See Shalom's answer for an example of a Gadol, Rav Yaakov Kaminetzsky, who would read a dummy kesuba. The statement of the \"seasoned moreh horaah\" who said, \"who says that what's written there is what you have to read?\" reflects what I have heard as well.</p>\n<p>For a practical example of someone who recommends changing the out-loud reading of a ketuba to avoid embarrassment to the kallah (though the example is to not read a specific name), see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14682&st=&pgnum=146\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Minchas Yitzchak Chelek 5 siman 44</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4b8zN.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></p>\n<h1>4</h1>\n<p>Note that the witnesses and the chassan should know what they are signing and agreeing to. Of course. I don't know that \"Our modern custom of reading the Ketubah comes from two primary halakhot in the Shulhan Arukh\", that Rabbi Michael Tzaddok writes, is correct, and would like to see some concrete support to that speculation, contra the position that it is a mere din in hefsek that sparked the practice.</p>\n<p>Especially since I've <a href=\"http://www.moreshet.co.il/web/shut/shut2.asp?id=77001\" rel=\"noreferrer\">quite often seen</a> the ketuba signed not under the chuppa, but at the chossan's tisch, and yet the ketuba is still read under the chuppa, we see that all it is functioning is a hefsek.</p>\n<p>In those places where the minhag is that they also sign the ketuba under the chuppa, then <strong>perhaps</strong> there is a fear that the groom and witnesses will mistake the contents of the ketuba, such that a deliberate misreading would not be appropriate. I would like to see a written source of e.g. Rav Ovadia Yosef saying this. Which apparently there is, but I would like to see it inside before editing this post to include it. I would also like to see why the groom and witnesses cannot be instructed as to this portion of the ketuba contents off-mike, so that every gossip in the audience is not privy to the sordid past of the kallah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To intentionally read the Ketubah errantly is problematic.  Our modern custom of reading the Ketubah comes from two primary halakhot in the Shulhan Arukh:</p>\n\n<p>Choshen Mishpat 45:2</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>2 If the Head of the Beis Din is familiar generally with the document,\n  and his personal scribe who he trusts and who fears him reads it to\n  him, he may sign the Shtar without reading it personally. However,\n  other individuals (or a Head of Beis Din relying on someone else’s\n  scribe) may not rely on a different person reading the contract and\n  may not sign until the witness reads every word of the document.</strong> <em>Rema:\n  Some are of the opinion that the witnesses may sign if two people read\n  the document to them. If the witnesses are not familiar with the\n  language in which the shtar is written, those reading it may also\n  translate the document. It seems to me that this view is the correct\n  one. There are those who say that they may read the document in public\n  and the witnesses can rely on this to sign without reading it\n  themselves, as a scribe would be reluctant to lie publicly, and in\n  this case they will have a status identical to a Head of Beis Din and\n  his personal secretary.</em>\n  This mandates that the public reading, which is being done for the benefit of the witnesses who will then sign the Ketubah, must be accurate.  If it is not, it has the ability to counteract their Eidut, and thus cancel the Ketubah, which brings about problems of it's own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even HaEzer 66:13</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>13 In a place where the Kesubah is habitually signed only by those who are qualified to act as witnesses, a person who cannot read must\n  not sign [the Kesubah].</strong>\n  <em>Rama: Therefore, an am ha-Aretz (ignoramus) who wants to divorce his wife, and says afterwards that he did not understand what was written\n  either in the Tenayim (conditions) or in her Kesubah, is not to be\n  believed, because [we assume] that the witnesses certainly did not\n  sign the Kesubah without having first testified orally in his presence\n  to what they put their signature. (The Responsa of the Rashba, chapter\n  629).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus we also rely on an accurate reading of the Ketubah to obligate the husband in what is written within it.</p>\n\n<p>Intentionally misreading the Ketubah then would cause very serious problems halakhically.  However that is not to say that we are not concerned about the possible embarassment of the bride.  </p>\n\n<p>Rav Benayahu Shmueli writes in his sefer Kavvanot of the Chuppah in the name of Rav Ovadia Yosef(sourcing Yabia Omer but not giving volume and chapter):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם הכלה בעלת תשובה שאין חזקת בתולה, בכדי שלא לביישה, יש להשתדל שהחתן\n  יסכים להתחייב במאתים זקוקין וימחק רק תיבת \"מדאורייתא\" וכן כל מקום שנא'\n  \"בתולתא דא\" ימחק ולא יכתוב כלום אלא מרת פלונית תחי' או יכתוב \"כלתא דא\"\n  או \"איתתא דא\", ואז אפילו אם נבעלה להעכו\"ם שנעשית זונה ואסורה לכהן לא\n  יצא מכשול אחר שכל אחד יראה שנמחק בתולתא דא.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>If the bride is a Baalat Teshuva that does not the chazakat(assumed\n  status) of a Betulah(virgin), in order that she will not be\n  embarrassed, one should do his best to see that the groom agrees to\n  obligate himself in the 200 Zukim and then erase just the word\n  \"m'd'oraitta\", and also every place that there is written \"This\n  Betulah\" also erase and write nothing, rather just her name or write\n  \"This bride\" or \"this woman\" and thus even if she had relations with a\n  non-Jew that would give her the status of a Zonah and make her\n  forbidden to a Kohen this will not become a stumbling block to another\n  as everyone can see that the \"this virgin\" was erased.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In my experience and from testing in the Israeli Rabbinut this is the general custom of Israel.  </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it a greater mitzvah to return a lost item anonymously?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While of course it is a mitzvah to give tzadekah, I have heard (though I don't have any attribution) that different kinds of giving are of different worth.  Particularly, I have heard that giving anonymously is especially worthy.  It seems fairly straightforward that this is because when someone gives anonymously, he/she does so without expectation of social gain and thus proves the selflessness of the act.  I am curious if this logic applies to other situations.</p>\n\n<p>A week or so ago, a colleague sent out an email that she had lost an earring at work and requesting its return if found.  A few days ago I heard her discussing with someone else the possibility that it had rolled under a cubicle wall or some other piece of furniture.  Being a young and able-bodied guy, I decided today, after work when everyone had left, to crawl around under her cubicle and search for the jewelry.  Alas, I found it!</p>\n\n<p>Of course I am going to return it to her, and it would be simple enough to present it to her at work tomorrow.  However, I am tempted to leave it anonymously somewhere that she will see it (e.g. on her desk wrapped up with a note).  Piqued by the moral conundrum, I thought I'd get the perspective from this site.  So:</p>\n\n<p>Is it a greater mitzvah to return an item anonymously?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Update:  I returned the earring this morning in person. My colleague was very thankful.  Thanks for all your input.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Anonymous tzedakah is valued because needing charity is embarrassing. If they know you're the donor (even if you don't know them), they'll feel weird when you're around; if you know they're the recipient (even if they don't know who gave it), you'll feel snide when seeing them. So anonymous is best.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not aware of any reason to value anonymity when returning a lost item, as there's no shame involved. There are stories of people who tried to hide their piety in various ways, but at the basic level it should be fine to identify yourself. (Or not, if you prefer.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Reasons for divorcing a woman (sourcing a chiddush)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishna in Gittin 9:10 provides a few different interpretations of ערות דבר (Deuteronomy 24:1). While the school of Shammai hold that for a man to divorce his wife he needs to find significant fault with her (דבר ערוה - possibly a crime of licentiousness), it is the opinion of the school of Hillel that he may divorce her if she only burnt his food. Rabbi Akiva's opinion, which is the most permissive of the three, is that he may even divorce her if he found another women whom he prefers. The language of the mishna in question is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בית שמאי אומרים לא יגרש אדם את אשתו אלא אם כן מצא בה דבר ערוה שנאמר כי\n  מצא בה ערות דבר ובית הלל אומרים אפילו הקדיחה תבשילו שנאמר כי מצא בה\n  ערות דבר רבי עקיבא אומר אפילו מצא אחרת נאה הינמה שנאמר והיה אם לא תמצא\n  חן בעיניו</p>\n  \n  <p>The school of Shammai say: A man may not divorce his wife unless he\n  finds in her a matter of lewdness, as it says, \"If he finds in her an\n  unseemly thing\" (Deuteronomy 24:1), but the school of Hillel say: Even\n  if she burnt his food, as it says, \"If he finds in her an unseemly\n  thing\". Rabbi Akiva says: Even if he found one more beautiful than\n  she, as it says, \"If she should not find favour in his eyes\" (<em>ibid</em>.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have heard it said that the reason for the permissiveness of Rabbi Akiva and the school of Hillel is that if we interpret the passage as do the school of Shammai then every woman who is divorced by her husband will be suspected of adultery. By technically allowing divorce to occur for trivial matters, we preserve the dignity of Jewish women who, once divorced, may be suspected of having done nothing more heinous than burn their husbands' food - or of being guilty of nothing more than being married to a womaniser.</p>\n\n<p>I am trying to find the source for that particular <em>chiddush</em>, which I think is very clever. To my mind, it sounds fairly late - maybe 19th/20th century - and I don't know how to go about finding it.

We're also \"before the King\" when we go anywhere, because He Is everywhere. So by that reasoning you couldn't wear shorts ever, and yet we find that there's an obligation to teach one's kids to swim, which obviously requires wearing shorts. If you were to respond by differentiating between a synagogue as being especially holy, that's a good point but I don't think it fully answers the issue.

However, I can guest what the significance may be, particularly for Israeli’s.

The language is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן הבא על אחת מכל העריות שבתורה או פסולות כגון אלמנה לכהן גדול, גרושה\n  וחלוצה לכהן הדיוט, ... בת ישראל לממזר ולנתין - פסל</p>\n  \n  <p>So too, one who has sexual intercourse with any of the <em>'arayot</em> or with invalid women - such as a high priest\n  with a widow, a regular priest with a divorcee or a <em>chalutzah</em>, a\n  mamzer or a <em>netin</em> with an Israelite girl - he invalidates [her].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro interprets the reference to invalidation as relating to her subsequent inability to marry a kohen, but recognises that this only goes for the first part of the mishna and for the final example given in the second part, since a divorcee and a <em>chalutzah</em> are already invalidated from marrying kohanim. His solution is that, in the event that they were the daughters of kohanim, they are now invalidated from consuming <em>terumah</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וגרושה נמי, אי בת כהן היא מפסלה בהך ביאה מתרומה דבי נשא</p>\n  \n  <p>And a divorcee [and <em>chalutzah</em>] likewise, if she is the daughter of a\n  kohen she is invalidated by this sexual intercourse from the <em>terumah</em>\n  of her father's house.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mishna in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%96_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yevamot 7:5</a>, however, is clear that a woman who was raped or seduced by a kohen will be unable to eat <em>terumah</em> (such as would have been permissible had she married him), but that if she was the daughter of a kohen and she was either raped or seduced by an Israelite, <strong>she will be able to continue eating it</strong>. The precise language is האונס והמפתה... לא פוסלים ולא מאכילים.</p>\n\n<p>Unless we posit a contradiction between these two mishnayot (ie: Yevamot 6:2 is according to one <em>tana</em> and Yevamot 7:5 is according to another), we seem to have a problem. The mishna in 6:2 cannot be speaking about rape and it cannot be speaking about seduction, since the mishna in 7:5 presents a contrary halakha. We are forced to suggest that it is speaking of marriage. But the first part of the mishna (in which a man has sexual intercourse with <em>'arayot</em>) cannot concern marriage, since there is no kiddushin when it comes to <em>'arayot</em>, and the final example in the mishna also cannot be speaking about marriage, since there is no kiddushin by mamzerim and <em>netinim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Do these mishnayot contradict one another, or is there a solution?</p>\n\n\n",

There he saw a chasid davening with such fervor and tears that the wealthy man decided not only to continue being a torah Jew but also to donate millions of dollars to charity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That type of story usually ends with \"and when the chasid gets up to Heaven, they will show him the merit he received for giving millions of dollars to tzedaka. But, 'I never did any such thing,' protests the chasid. 'You are receiving this merit for inspiring another person,' is the response.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is this true? If, through no intent of my own, someone sees me or something I have done and is inspired to do good themselves, do I get the credit? If so, why (after all, I haven't actually done the specific action)? And, does this work in the reverse (can someone be punished for causing someone to sin by modeling bad behavior)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9988\">Rashi to Devorim 24 (19) about the forgotten sheaf </a> says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>SO THAT [THE LORD, YOUR GOD,] WILL BLESS YOU: Although [the forgotten\n  sheaf came into his hand without intention [of the owner].

Furthermore, there are multiple rabbinic restrictions throughout various topics in the Torah that were established based on Mar'it ha'ayin (onlookers who may see one do an action and thereby think that the action is permissible to do). Plus you have the whole concept of Kiddush/chilul Hashem which again depends on the thoughts of another and their perception of your action. Thus, we Jews indeed strongly care about what people will think. Therefore one must always be on guard. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are homeopathic remedies kosher?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm not sure what they put in the remedies but I would like to know if they are kosher and would batel beshishim apply in this case if there was a non-kosher ingredient?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Some Halachic sources relating to homeopathy:</p>\n\n<p>1) Hamaor (journal) Sh'vat 1983. Someone asked R' Moshe Feinstein concerning the kashrut of homeopathic 'remedies' on Passover. (Would the prohibition against purposely nullifying a substance apply?) The response came from Rabbi Moshe Tendler who wrote that his father-in-law didn't want to deal with the question because homeopathy is nonsense:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Homeopathy is not considered a <strong>tested and confirmed</strong> remedy that people can use without going against the will of God. \n  A theory of healing that goes against rationalism brings one to nonsense beliefs and endangers the patient to foreign influences, occult beliefs and eventually to deny the order of nature that God has arranged.\n  Since he doesn't want to deal with such ideas, Rav Feinstein is compelled to refuse  to answer your question.\"\n  <em>(My rough translation. Please refer to the original Hebrew for the sake of accuracy.)</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I emphasized the terms <strong>tested and confirmed</strong> (בדוקה ומנוסה) because they refer to the prohibition against superstitions- \"darchei haemori\". The source in Shulchan Aruch is OC:301. Basically, any cure that has no basis in science and has been proven ineffective (or perhaps not proven effective) is forbidden as a superstition. (There are nuances that need further study.) Indeed, homeopathy has been proven ineffective (see wikipedia for references to the meta-studies) and has no rational basis in science. \n  (I can speculate as to the meaning of the rest of the letter. Many people who believe and promote homeopathy tend to have other strange beliefs. There is a definite connection between homeopathy and the occult/superstitions. Major influential homeopaths such J. T. Kent, Edward Bach and George Vithoulkas were/are occultists. More than half of Wikipedia's list of homeopaths have some connection to the occult/spiritualism/new age. In some cases, outright idolatry is involved.)</p>\n\n<p>The article in the HaMaor journal continues with two rather strange responses to Rabbi Tendler/Feinstein's \"non-responsum\". They include halachic non-sequitors, a bizarre claim that homeopathy is respected by doctors/scientists, an accusation that Rabbi Tendler fabricated his father-in-law's response, and even an ad hominem attack against Rabbi Tendler for attending university.</p>\n\n<p>I found three other reponsa that deal with Rabbi Feinstein's negation of homeopathy:</p>\n\n<p>1) Rabbi Chaim Dovid HaLevi in T'chumin, Volume 3. He deals with the Passover issue and the question of non-scientific (segulot) remedies in general. (I would humbly suggest anyone reading the responsum to study all the sources he cites very carefully. Especially problematic is that he disregards the major point that Rabbi Tendler makes- that homeopathy is not בדוקה ומנוסה ; instead he only deals with the issue that homeopathy has no scientific explanation.) </p>\n\n<p>2) R' Menashe Klein, Mishneh Halachos, Vol. 10, 112. (He doesn't understand why homeopathy would be considered nonsense/non-scientific. He doesn't deal with the issue of בדוקה ומנוסה)</p>\n\n<p>3) R Wosner, Shevet HaLevi, Vol. 5, 55. (He seems to conclude that the remedy is permitted if it has been established as effective and accepted by medical experts.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Wikipedia includes this sentence in its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy\" rel=\"nofollow\">article on homeopathy</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The low concentration of homeopathic remedies, <strong>which often lack even a\n  single molecule of the diluted substance,</strong>[13] has been the basis of\n  questions about the effects of the remedies since the 19th century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If there is not a single molecule of a non-kosher ingerdient, what possible problem can there be?</p>\n\n\n",

I think that a more basic question must be asked first:  does a rapist have any parental rights to a child conceived from the rape if the mother refuses to marry him?

The <em>Tanchuma</em> derives from this that the blessing should be transmitted fervently rather than grudgingly or hurriedly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כה תברכו את בני ישראל אמור להם אמור מלא כתיב אמר להם הקב\"ה לכהנים לא מפני שאמרתי לכם שתהיו מברכין אותם באנגריא ובבהלות אלא תהיו מברכין אותם בכונת הלב כדי שתשלים הברכה בהם, לכך נאמר אמור מלא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In fact, the <em>Be'er Sheva</em> (<em>Sotah</em> 39a, s.v. לברך את ישראל באהבה) interprets the <em>Tanchuma</em> as requiring kohanim to bless the people with love. R' Avigdor Nebenzahl <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/rabbinebenzahl/weekly/3269\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> that a kohein must bless with love since he is the conduit for HaShem's blessing upon the people (per <em>B'midbar</em> 6:27, \"ושמו את שמי על בני ישראל ואני אברכם\").</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37960&st=&pgnum=679&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sotah 38:</a> discusses Birchas Kohanim and then goes on to say that we do not give the Kos Shel Bracha only to one with a good eye.</p>\n\n<p>אמר ר' יהושע בן לוי: אין נותנים כוס של ברכה לברך אלא לטוב עין שנאמר: טוב עין הוא יבורך, אל תקרי יבורך אלא יברך</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37960&st=&pgnum=730\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maharsha</a> explains on this how Birchas Kohanim is supposed to be done B'Ahava = good eye.</p>\n\n\n",

The question is, should a person be faulted for disbelieving, if he thinks that believing in God is philosophically unjustified?</p>\n<p>First off, I should mention the Rashash to Shabbos 31a, who writes that a person is only considered a heretic after fully analyzing every side of the issue, which I doubt most people have. Until then, they are merely 'non-believers', which isn't such a problem. I'll quote his words in case I'm misinterpreting them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דכופר לא מיקרי אלא אחר החקירה בכל חלקי הסותר, אבל זה לא חקר ולא נוכח אלא שלא שלא היה מאמין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, I doubt that too many other halakhic authorities would agree to this distinction, and I'm sure most would consider \"disbelief\" just as problematic as \"heresy\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There are two consequences of being a disbeliever/heretic: (1) according to the Rambam (intro to Cheilek and Hilchos Teshuva ch. 4), at least, a heretic had no share in the World to Come, no matter how good of a person he may have been otherwise (2) regarding many (but not all) halachos, a heretic is treated as a non-Jew and other Jews are obligated to hate him and possibly even throw him into a pit to let him die (ibid).</p>\n<p>Regarding (2), most contemporary poskim, most notably the Chazon Ish, have assumed that at least some, if not all, of those halakhos are no longer applicable today to a person who doesn't believe in God, because we'd attribute it to his upbringing or the inability to be properly philosophically convinced due to uniquely contemporary circumstances. See Chazon Ish Y.D. 1:6, 2:16, 2:18, as well as in 2:28 where he writes that this was also the opinion of the Chofetz Chaim. The Chazon Ish is actually not the first to pasken like this - I believe that it is the opinion of R. Yaakov Ettlinger in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1122&st=&pgnum=15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shut Binyan Tzion Hachadashos 23</a> (though I'm not sure what to make of that title). See also R. Moshe Feinstein in Iggros Moshe O.C. 4:91:6, as well as many other later poskim who have accepted this opinion, though <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_47305_89.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there will always be dissenters here and there</a>.</p>\n<p>There is an even earlier body of literature regarding (1). Some understand the Raavad to Hilchos Teshuva 3:7 to be saying that such a person does not automatically lose his share in the afterlife, and this position appears to be agreed upon by the Radvaz 4:187, as well as R. Yosef Albo in Sefer HaIkkarim 1:3 (though he writes that such a person still sinned).</p>\n<p>However, there is considerable debate as to the position of the Rambam himself on this matter and whether the Raavad is correct. Abarbanel (Rosh Amana ch. 12) writes that one who doesn't believe in God would certainly not have access to Olam Haba, even if it's through no fault of his own, just as someone who drinks poison thinking it is wine would still die from the poison. There's an oft-quoted opinion of R. Chaim of Brisk that one who falls to apikores 'by accident' is still an apikores. While this isn't in R. Chaim's own writings, it's quoted by his son <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_33371_42.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Velvel</a>, by <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_48216_385.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

R. Elchonon Wasserman (Kovetz Maamarim pg. 19) interprets this statement very differently: there's no such thing as being a heretic 'by accident', since the truth of God is so obvious that only a wicked person would deny it. (I personally have a lot of trouble accepting this though, especially regarding the other 12 principles besides belief in God).

For the same reason, I wouldn't worry about whether you have the status of a kofer.</p>\n\n<p>However, that does not mean you should stop trying. Have you read books meant to convince you that Judaism is true? Beyond a Reasonable Doubt by R' Shmuel Waldman? Soul Searching by R' Yaakov Astor? Other books, such as the stirring classic R' S.R. Hirsch's Horeb, or contemporary spiritually-oriented works such as Bilvavi Mishkan Evneh (which can be read online in English for free) or the books of R' Shalom Arush or R' Lazer Brody?

I mention quite a few, because perhaps if you study everything, you will find a particular author who arouses your heart and inspires you to believe.</p>\n\n<p>Have you spent a significant amount of time praying in your own words each day, asking Hashem to help you believe? There's nothing wrong with asking Him for a sign that He exists. You may be surprised by the result. \"Everything good can be attained through prayer: Torah, devotion, holiness... everything good in all the worlds!\" Likutey Moharan II, 111.</p>\n\n<p>Have you consulted rabbis known for giving spiritual guidance? Nowadays, many well-known rabbis will respond to emails, even if you're not located near any rabbis.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>\"emunah\" is the term you are looking for. \"Emunah\" is the basic understand of a jew that everything written in our sources is true an g'd is constantly with us. \"emunah\" must be learned specifically (like halacha), it cannot be attained otherwise. Learning chumash with rashi or a masechet in talmud might be intellectual interesting but first your emunah must be strengthened. \"From where do we know that judaism is right\", that everything written is true? A famous answer is the \"iggeret teiman\" (letter to the jemenite jews) written by Maimonides addressing specifically this question raised by the jemenite jews that wanted to convert to islam. \nA modern approach which had enormous impact on my believe (emunah) was \"Letters to a buddhist jew\" by Rav Akiva Tatz. This book answers specific questions raised by a atheist buddhist jew who even did not want to believe - he had to give it a try because of his wife! ;-)\nHe is philosophically experienced and so is the level of this book, but it is fitting for all levels. And there is a whole chapter about \"emunah\".\nA further very good source a shiurim of \"machon meir\" which are specifically addressing this topic: <a href=\"http://www.english.machonmeir.net/torah-lessons-archive?view=jmultimedia&catid=18\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.english.machonmeir.net/torah-lessons-archive?view=jmultimedia&catid=18</a></p>\n\n<p>Or the most famous book of all times when it comes to emunah: the kuzari. No need to comment. Every jew should read that book. (the vilna gaon had always two books with him: \"Messilat jesharim\" and \"the kuzari\". And he read them constantly).</p>\n\n<p>But I fear your question was a technical halacha question and I simply missed the point totally.... ;-) sorry, if that is the case.</p>\n\n\n",

Because\n  even the souls of men does not have the strength to stand up to the\n  klipos, all the more so them.

Indeed, in Joshua 15:14, they are named: \"And Caleb drove out thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.\"  (See also Judges 1:20.) As the Nephilim appear to be only three individuals, it is highly unlikely that their bones will ever be recovered.</p>\n\n<p>In addition,  while \"Nephilim\" is generally translated as \"giants,\" it is unclear whether this translation is correct, especially since the word is so rare. (Granted, in Modern Hebrew, \"anak\" means \"giant,\" but that could simply be because of this verse.)  Other translations have been proposed. As the JPS edition of Deuteronomy states,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The exact meaning of \"Anakites\" is uncertain. Some take it as an epithet meaning \"long-necked ones,\" based on Hebrew 'anak, \"necklace,\" and its Arabic cognate meaning \"neck\". Others relate it to names of people or places in Canaan or across the Mediterranean containing the element 'anak or to Greek anax, \"nobleman\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In such case, they would not be giants, and thus, would not have special bones waiting to be found.</p>\n\n<p>( <strong>#</strong> The Nephilim make one other appearance, in Genesis, where they are described as the offspring of the \"sons of God and the daughters on Man.\"  Who or what this refers to is very unclear, but either way, these Nephilim are clearly not the same as the \"sons of Anak.\")</p>\n\n\n",

See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/12572/472\">this question</a> for more information about why electricity is prohibited.  In addition, writing is forbidden on Shabbat, even if the text is ephemeral.  Since, so far, it is not possible to ask and answer questions on Mi Yodeya without using electricity and writing, the Shabbat-observant participants here do not engage in those activities on Shabbat.  (Or Yom Tov, holidays.) </p>\n\n<p>Shabbat is of course determined by local astronomical events and Mi Yodeya is a worldwide community -- just because it's Shabbat in North America doesn't mean it is in Australia or Israel or Europe, after all.  Further, as noted by Daniel in a comment, this site is also used by non-Jews, who aren't bound by Shabbat restrictions and are welcome to use the site then.  So you will likely see some activity here on Saturday, but less than the rest of the week.</p>\n\n\n",

Say that you see someone depressed, severely depressed and they just need a hug. If they're the same gender, that's all fine and dandy. However, if you're not the same gender then you're obviously doing negiah. Now, I understand there's some wiggle room with rabbinic mitzvot (however, Rambam and other halachic commentators claim that negiah is actually a biblical commandment). Could such a touch (even if sexual desire is derived from it) be excused or is it still an avera?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>RS quoted a fascinating Gemara above, however there are a lot of ways it's interpreted.</p>\n\n<p>Don't get started on trying to psychologically diagnose \"sort of kind of pikuach nefesh\", unless you're a trained professional or it's clear this person is a danger to themselves or others (at which point you need to call in the professionals).</p>\n\n<p>Let's try and break down this very messy question a bit.</p>\n\n<p>When some people say \"I'm shomer negiah\", they mean \"I don't touch the opposite gender [other than spouse] at all.\" To others, it means \"I don't do affectionate touching.\" There's a huge difference between those two.</p>\n\n<p>Non-affectionate touching: The Bait Yosef actually demands the former and prohibits a man from taking his nida wife's pulse even if she's seriously ill. My understanding is that very few people follow this opinion. (Rabbi Yehuda Herzl Henkin observes this was not Rambam's position.)</p>\n\n<p>In a recent yutorah mp3 on nursing, someone asked Rabbi Hershel Schachter about therapeutic touch, e.g. a female nurse who reaches out to hold an elderly man's hand as he's wincing in pain from an injection. Rabbi Schachter is of the opinion that non-affectionate touch is permissible, so this was just a question of whether this touch is \"affectionate\"; he thought it wasn't and therefore this was a reasonable course of action.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as we get to hugs or kisses though, this becomes a lot less clear. Rambam's classic examples of affectionate touching are hugging and kissing! Trying to differentiate hugs is quite complicated.</p>\n\n<p>I know of stories of good observant Jews who hugged a grieving friend, but don't ask me if that was technically within halacha.</p>\n\n<p>As a matter of policy it's a very bad idea. Rabbi Kenneth Brander warned a group of rabbinic students about setting appropriate boundaries; he said it's likely you'll get a woman in your office who is falling apart and having horrible tragedies in her life and you'd think giving her a hug is the right thing to do -- don't. (YU shiur on \"men of tzniut\" or \"gavrei tzniut\" or something like that.)</p>\n\n<p>There's a recording in which Rabbi Aaron Rakeffet Rothkoff similarly addresses this dilemma: \"what if you're a psychologist seeing a teenage girl and you know that putting an arm around her will do a tremendous amount of good...\" - a voice from the back of the room shouts out - <strong>NO!!</strong> -- Rabbi Rakeffet replies to his student that he's most likely correct, but it is a difficult situation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The talmud in Sanhedrin 75a brings a case of a man who had his eyes on a certain woman.

Also, women are not obligated by positive time-bound mitzvot, so they're not obligated to wear tefillin (same sugya in Kiddushin). But can they wear teffilin anyway? Here is the main story of a woman wearing tefillin in the gemara.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Talmud Bavli</strong> -  תלמוד בבלי מסכת עירובין דף צו עמוד א-ב (Eruvin 96a-b)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דתניא: מיכל בת כושי היתה מנחת תפילין ולא מיחו בה חכמים. ואשתו של יונה היתה עולה לרגל ולא מיחו בה חכמים. מדלא מיחו בה חכמים - אלמא קסברי: מצות עשה שלא הזמן גרמא היא. - ודילמא סבר להכרבי יוסי, דאמר: נשים סומכות רשות. דאי לא תימא הכי - אשתו של יונה היתה עולה לרגל ולא מיחו בה. מי איכא למאן דאמר רגל לאו מצות עשה שהזמן גרמא הוא? אלא: קסבר רשות, הכא נמי: רשות. אלא האי תנא היא, דתניא: המוצא תפילין מכניסן זוג זוג, אחד האיש ואחד האשה, אחד חדשות ואחד ישנות, דברי רבי מאיר. רבי יהודה אוסר בחדשות ומתיר בישנות. ע\"כ לא פליגי אלא בחדשות וישנות, אבל באשה - לא פליגי. שמע מינה: מצות עשה שלא הזמן גרמא הוא, וכל מצות עשה שאין הזמן גרמא נשים חייבות. - ודילמא סבר לה כרבי יוסי, דאמר: נשים סומכות רשות? - לא סלקא דעתך, דלא רבי מאיר סבר לה כרבי יוסי, ולא רבי יהודה סבר לה כרבי יוסי. לא רבי מאיר סבר לה כרבי יוסי - דתנן: אין מעכבין את התינוקות מלתקוע. הא נשים - מעכבין. וסתם מתניתין רבי מאיר. ולא רבי יהודה סבר לה כרבי יוסי - דתניא: אדבר אל בני ישראל וסמך - בני ישראל סומכין ואין בנות ישראל סומכות. רבי יוסי ורבי שמעון אומרים: נשים סומכות רשות. וסתם סיפרא מני - רבי יהודה. </p>\n  \n  <p>For it was taught: Michal the daughter of the Kushite wore tefillin and the Sages did not attempt to prevent her, and the wife of Jonah attended the festival pilgrimage and the Sages did not prevent her.

Jose who\n  ruled: It is optional for women to lay their hands upon an offering?\n  For were you not to say so, how is it that Jonah's wife attended the\n  festival pilgrimage and the Sages did not prevent her, seeing that\n  there is no one who contends that the observance of a festival is not\n  a positive precept the performance of which is limited to a particular\n  time?

I'll just add that the Rema is quoting the <em>Kol Bo</em>'s language, which besides noting women's exemption, also mentions problem with cleanliness.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כתב הר\"ם נשים פטורות מתפילין מפני שהוא מצות עשה שהזמן גרמה שהרי אין מניחין אותן בשבת ויום טוב ואם רצו להניח אין שומעין להן מפני שאינן יודעות לשמור עצמן בנקיות ע\"כ</p>\n  \n  <p>The <em>Maharam</em> [whose students, like the Kol Bo, wrote his teachings] wrote that women are exempt from tefillin because they are positive time-bound mitvot since they are not worn on Shabbat or Yom Tov. And if they want to wear tefillin, one does not listen to them because they do not know how to maintain cleanliness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because of the Rema is the foremost Ashkenazic authority of halakha, the great modern Askenazic poskim (R. Moshe Feinstein-Igrot Moshe IV OC #9, Chafetz Chaim-Mishnah Berura OC 38:3, Arukh HaShulchan-OC:38) have similarly ruled against it. Sephardic opinions and other poskim who have explicitly allowed it deserves its own question. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Regarding Tallit</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Like tefillin, there are time-bound and other issues (male clothing, arrogance, etc.) that concern its permissibility. However, there is no story of women wearing it in the gemara, and there is generally a more stringent opinion against women wearing tefillin than tallit (perhaps because there isn't a requirement to buy a tallit and it's not obvious if it's time-bound). The discussion of women and tallit in the gemara is here:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Talmud Bavli</strong> -  מנחות דף מג עמוד א (Menachot 43a)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר: הכל חייבין בציצית, כהנים, לוים וישראלים, גרים, נשים ועבדים; ר\"ש\n  פוטר בנשים, מפני שמצות עשה שהזמן גרמא הוא, וכל מצות עשה שהזמן גרמא\n  נשים פטורות. אמר מר: הכל חייבין בציצית, כהנים, לוים וישראלים. פשיטא,\n  דאי כהנים לוים וישראלים פטירי, מאן ליחייב? כהנים איצטריכא ליה, ס\"ד\n  אמינא, הואיל וכתיב: אלא תלבש שעטנז צמר ופשתים יחדיו גדילים תעשה לך,\n  מאן דלא אישתרי כלאים לגביה בלבישה הוא דמיחייב בציצית, הני כהנים הואיל\n  ואישתרי כלאים לגבייהו לא ליחייבו, קמ\"ל, נהי דאישתרי בעידן עבודה, בלא\n  עידן עבודה לא אישתרי. ר\"ש פוטר בנשים. מאי טעמא דר\"ש? דתניא: בוראיתם\n  אותו - פרט לכסות לילה</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Rabbis taught: All must observe the law of zizith, priests, Levites, and Israelites, proselytes, women and slaves. R. Simeon declares women exempt, since it is a positive precept dependent on a fixed time, and women are exempt from all positive precepts that are dependent on a fixed time.\n  The Master said, ‘All must observe the law of zizith, priests, Levites, and Israelites’. Is not this obvious? For if priests and Levites and Israelites were exempt, then who would observe it? — It was stated particularly on account of priests. For I might have argued, since it is written, Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together, and [it is followed by,] Thou shalt make thee twisted cords, that only those who are forbidden to wear mingled stuff must observe the law of zizith, and as priests are permitted to wear mingled stuff20 they need not observe [the law of zizith]; we are therefore taught [that they, too, are bound], for although while performing the service [in the Temple] they may wear [mingled stuff] they certainly may not wear it when not performing the service.\n  R.

    "title": "Do a mitzva for mashiach?",
    "content": "# Do a mitzva for mashiach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently saw in <em>The Moshiach Times</em>, a popular Chabad-Lubavitch publication for children, an exhortation to \"do a mitzvah for moshiach\": to do a <em>mitzva</em> with the specific purpose of hastening the arrival of the days of <em>mashiach</em>. Is there a source for this: that one should do <em>mitzvos</em> for, at least in part, this purpose, or with, at least in part, this intent? (I know doing <em>mitzvos</em> can hasten the arrival of the days of <em>mashiach</em>, and I also know we pray for their hastened arrival; those are not my question.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I think that the question presupposes that the coming of Moshiach is a <strong>reward</strong> for our work during the era of exile, and in that case that's a fair point, since we're supposed to do mitzvos \"not in order to receive reward\" (Avos 1:3).</p>\n\n<p>However, the Lubavitcher Rebbe zt\"l cites in this connection a statement by R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi (Tanya, ch. 37) that the extent of the revelation of G-dliness that will occur in the time of Moshiach <em>depends on</em> our service of G-d during the era of exile. In other words, as the Rebbe puts it, these bear the same relationship to each other as the planting of a seed does to the growth of the fruit. Isn't it only logical, then, that we do our \"planting\" with the expectation that it will yield that \"fruit\"? (The more so because there are aspects of Torah and mitzvos themselves that await the era of Moshiach to be fully realizable in practice, meaning in effect that the \"fruit\" itself includes the ability to do more mitzvos, much like \"learning in order to teach\" and \"learning in order to perform\" (Avos 4:5).)</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the Rebbe goes on to say that this interdependency is reflected in the names of the two (usually combined) parshiyos of Tazria-Metzora: the \"sowing\" <em>(tazria)</em> has to be imbued with the idea that it leads not just to something in the indefinite future (<em>zos tihyeh</em> - \"this will be\" - an older name for Parshas Metzora) but directly to Moshiach (represented as a metzora, as per Sanhedrin 98b (חיוורא דבי רבי שמו) and as explained in Chabad Chassidus (e.g., Likkutei Torah, Vayikra 22b ff)).</p>\n\n<p>(Adapted from <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15794&st=&pgnum=54\">Shaarei Geulah u-Moshiach pp. 59</a>ff, which in turn is a Hebrew adaptation of the Yiddish original in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15952&st=&pgnum=84\">Likkutei Sichos 22:70</a>ff, mainly sections 8-10)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This idea is brought in the <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%AA%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%91%D7%94_%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Hilchot Tshuvah 3:4</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... לפיכך צריך כל אדם שיראה עצמו כל השנה כולה כאילו חציו זכאי וחציו\n  חייב. וכן כל העולם חציו זכאי וחציו חייב. חטא חטא אחד, הרי הכריע את\n  עצמו ואת כל העולם כולו לכף חובה וגרם לו השחתה. <strong>עשה מצוה אחת, הרי הכריע\n  את עצמו ואת כל העולם כולו לכף זכות וגרם לו ולהם תשועה והצלה</strong>, שנאמר:\n  \"וצדיק יסוד עולם\" (משלי י, כה). זה שצדק הכריע את כל העולם לזכות\n  והצילו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>..Translated <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911896/jewish/Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...Accordingly, throughout the entire year, a person should always look\n  at himself as equally balanced between merit and sin and the world as\n  equally balanced between merit and sin.

Moshe Feinstein-Igrot Moshe IV OC #9, Chafetz Chaim-Mishnah Berura OC 38:3, Arukh HaShulchan-OC:38) have similarly ruled against it. Sephardic opinions and other poskim who have explicitly allowed it deserves its own question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'll bite.  What <em>do</em> Sephardic sources have to say on this?  (A) I'm curious, and (B) it might provide one tiny nugget of information for <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/15079/472\">this question</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In terms of halacha, the foremost Ashkenazic rishonim (Rema, following Maharam and Kol Bo, Maharshal and the Levush) ruled that one should protest a woman wearing tefillin (mainly due to cleanliness concerns). </p>\n\n<p>However, none of the Sephardic rishonim ruled likewise. Tefillin, like any positive time-bound mitzvah, is theoretically optional if they wish to partake in it. See, for example, the Rambam (Hil. Tzitzit 3:9):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונשים ועבדי' שרצו להתעטף בציצית מתעטפים בלא ברכה, וכן שאר מצות עשה שהנשים פטורות מהן אם רצו לעשות אותן בלא מ ברכה אין ממחין בידן, טומטום ואנדרוגינוס חייבין בכולן מספק לפיכך אין מברכין אלא עושין בלא ברכה.</p>\n  \n  <p>Women and servants who wish to wrap themselves in tzitzit may do so without reciting a blessing. Similarly, regarding the other positive commandments which women are not required to fulfill, if they desire to fulfill them without reciting a blessing, they should not be prevented from doing so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here the Rambam states the opposite of the Askenazic rishonim, as one <em>shouldn't</em> protest women performing such mitzvot. Similarly, there is no resistance from the Shulchan Arukh about women wearing tefillin. All that he says (in OC 38:3) is: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נשים ועבדים פטורים מתפילין, מפני שהוא מצות עשה שהזמן גרמא </p>\n  \n  <p>Women and slave are exempt from donning phylacteries for it is a\n  positive time-bound commandment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While one might expect Sephardim to lead the way for women wearing tefillin, there is another twist in the halachic puzzle. Regarding mitzvot that women are not obligated to perform, the Shulchan Arukh states that women should not say a blessing before performing it, while the Rema states that they can (OC 589:6):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אע\"פ שנשים פטורות, יכולות לתקוע; וכן אחר שיצא כבר, יכול לתקוע להוציאן, אבל אין מברכות ולא יברכו להן. הגה: והמנהג שהנשים מברכות על מצות עשה שהזמן גרמא על כן גם כאן תברכנה לעצמן, אבל אחרים לא יברכו להן אם כבר יצאו ואין תוקעין רק לנשים, אבל אם תוקעין לאיש המחוייב, מברכין לו אע\"פ שכבר יצאו, כמו שנתבאר סימן תקפ\"ה סעיף ב' הגהה א' ד\"ע</p>\n  \n  <p>Even though women are exempt, they may blow the Shofar. Similarly,\n  after a man fulfills the mitzvah himself, he can blow to cover the\n  women. However, they (the women) do not make the blessing and he\n  shouldn’t make the blessing for them.  <strong>Rema</strong>: The [Ashkenazic]\n  custom is that women make blessings on a positive time-bound mitzvot,\n  and so in this case they should make the blessing for themselves. But\n  others shouldn’t make the blessing for them if they already fulfilled\n  the commandment. If you are not only blowing the Shofer for women, but\n  you are also blowing it to cover a man, you make a blessing even if\n  you yourself already fulfilled the commandment; as explained in 585:2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many Sephardic poskim (such as R. Ovadia Yosef) have followed this ruling for all such optional mitzvot (i.e., shofar, lulav, etc.) and women performing them. So we have a strange case here, where a Sephardic model might provide room for women wearing tefillin but without a beracha, and an Ashkenazic model which allows for saying brachot for optional mitzvot but doesn't allow tefillin specifically. All acharonim and modern rabbis should be taken into account (especially if one is seeking a practical solution), but it is noteworthy that all Sephardic rishonim permit tefillin wearing, like all positive time-bound mitzvot, for women to perform. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Hacham Yishak Shalit\"A writes (Yalkut Yosef various places) in accordance with that Rama that we should protest women donning Tefilin and Talit.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It's more stringent since according to sefardim women don't (have) to do Mitzvos Ase Shehazman Grama </p>\n\n\n",

The poskim also discuss relying on a Jewish chef in regards to knowing if a certain food might be found in a particular dish (for example someone who made a neder not to have haneh from a certain food, or in the case of Trumah and giving to a cohen to taste, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Are there poskim that discuss if we are accustomed to rely on this in practice (to give to a Jewish chef to taste at a time when one might assume there is a prohibited food in the mixture?) Now a days I understand that the poskim (at least Ashkanazim, Sephardim might be different in this -- perhaps someone could source this) <em>don't</em> rely on the non-Jewish chef, that's why I am asking about relying on a Jewish one.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First Sephardim also do not rely on a non-Jewish taste tester(See Kaf HaChaim 98:2, Ben Ish Hai Year 2 Korach 61).

The Taz(98:2)\nargues and brings a proof from the din of gall bladder that in the case of a safek issur it is mutar to test by only using the tongue. However, in our case tasting with the tongue\ndoes not help us solve the safek (doubt) because in order to properly ascertain the taste\nthe food it must be eaten.  The Mishb'tzos Zahav(98:2) explains that the Taz holds that\ntongue tasting is only an issur d'rabbanan anad is therefore permitted in safek.  However, the Mishb'tzos Zahav and Pischai Tshuva bring that the Shach (42:4) holds that only by a gall bladder is tongue tasting mutar because it has a bitter taste.</p>\n\n<p>The Pischai Tshuva says that the Pri Megadim (Mishb'tzos Zahav 95:15) agrees to the Shach.\nHe then brings the Tzemach Tzedek permits food that is only assur mid’rabbanan may even be tasted in ones mouth and then spat out. The Mishb'tzos Zahav (108:9) argues that it is assur to do so except in the case of borit (a type of soap made with chailev) that has such a bad taste that even a dog would not eat it. He concludes that even by borit the Pri Chadash argues and therefore one who is strict is praiseworthy.  The Pischai Tshuva concludes with the Noda B'Yehudah that tongue tasting is only mutar by an issur pagum.</p>\n\n\n",

All the other days are in adjacent calendrical groups. Why is that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>There are two main Regalim - Pesach and Sukkot. Each one has another one-day mini yom-tov without special mitzvos afterwards. They are each called an \"Atzeret\" since they have no special mitzvot and are a culmination of the previous holiday. 7 weeks after the beginning of Pesach is Shavuot/Atzeret, and the day after Sukkot is Shemini Atzeret. </p>\n\n<p>The connection between Shemini Atzeres and Sukkos is clear, since there isn't even a separation of days between them. The connection between Pesach and Shavuout can clearly be seen in the the Mitzva of Sefira that connects them and in their connected harvests and korbanot. Also, they left Egypt to receive the Torah on Sinai, which happened on Shavuot.</p>\n\n<p>There are two parallel sets of holidays, so one can then ask why is there a seven-week break between Pesach and its Atzeret, but not between Sukkot and its Atzeret? The Midrash (Yalkut Pinchas #782) asks this question and explains that while the weather is great during shavuot, it would be hard to travel back to Jerusalem during the rainy season, so its Atzeret is right afterwards. (Translation from <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0805241132\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer Ha-Aggadah</a>):\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aLHj0.png\" alt=\"Midrash on Shavuot vs. Shemini Atzeret\"></p>\n\n<p>There are some other comparisons that can be made between the Holidays' sets of korbanot and their harvest seasons that may also add to this explanation. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, while shavuot was when the Jews received the Torah, Sukkot is connected to the celebration after receiving forgiveness and the second set of Luchot on Yom Kippur. So it wouldn't make sense to push Atzeret further away into the year. Perhaps the sefirah-parallel period can instead be seen in the Aseret Yemei haTeshuva (and perhaps Elul) which came before.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> explains in Guide for the Perplexed 3:43 that Pesach and Sukkot need to contain 7 days of holidays in order to recognize what we are celebrating. Shavuot only requires one day to recognize what we are celebrating. Thus it makes perfect sense why Shavuot is \"alone\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Feast of Weeks is the anniversary of the Revelation on Mount\n  Sinai. In order to raise the importance of this day, we count the days\n  that pass since the preceding festival, just as one who expects his\n  most intimate friend on a certain day counts the days and even the\n  hours. This is the reason why we count the days that pass since the\n  offering of the Omer, between the anniversary of our departure from\n  Egypt and the anniversary of the Lawgiving. The latter was the aim and\n  object of the exodus from Egypt, and thus God said, \"I brought you\n  unto myself\" (Exod. xix. 4). <strong>As that great revelation took place\n  only on one day, so we keep its anniversary only one day: but if the\n  eating of unleavened bread on Passover were only commanded for one\n  day, we should not have noticed it, and its object would not have been\n  manifest. For it frequently happens that we take the same kind of food\n  for two or three days. But by our continuing for a whole period [of\n  seven days] to eat unleavened bread, its object becomes clear and\n  evident.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>New-Year is likewise kept for one day; for it is a day of repentance,\n  on which we are stirred up from our forgetfulness. For this reason the\n  shofar is blown on this day, as we have shown in Mishneh-torah. The\n  day is, as it were, a preparation for and an introduction to the day\n  of the Fast, as is obvious from the national tradition about the days\n  between New-Year and the Day of Atonement.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The Feast of Tabernacles, which is a feast of rejoicing and gladness, is kept seven days, in order that the idea of the festival\n  may be more noticeable.</strong> The reason why it is kept in the autumn is\n  stated in the Law, \"When thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the\n  field\" (Exod. xxiii. 16); that is to say, when you rest and are free\n  from pressing labours. Aristotle, in the ninth book of his Ethics,\n  mentions this as a general custom among the nations. He says: \"In\n  ancient times the sacrifices and assemblies of the people took place\n  after the ingathering of the corn and the fruit, as if the sacrifices\n  were offered on account of the harvest.\" Another reason is this--in\n  this season it is possible to dwell in tabernacles, as there is\n  neither great heat nor troublesome rain.

He explains that the point of citations is particularly when the source cited is viewed as being an inferior source. When others hear the source cited, and realize that even an apparently inferior source merits mention, they will be inspired to pursue their own studies, so that they too will be quoted, in spite of their relative inferiority.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האומר דבר בשם אומרו, והכונה בזה...לא יתבייש מלומר השמועה בשם מי שאמרה, יהיה מי שיהיה, כי מזה ימשך תועלת גדול לכל השומעים, כאשר יראו התלמידים וכל בני אדם שזה השלם עם כל שלמותו אומר שמועה מפי אחר קטון ממנו, ישתדלו כלם ללמוד וללמד, כדי שיזכו גם הם שיאמרו אחרים שלמים דבר בשמם </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the more inferior the source is perceived to be, the more of a reason to quote it.

What I know some people do is warm up food for the children and then leave the remaining food for themselves for the nighttime. My question is: If one warms up food in a oven and then takes a piece out before Shekiya may they return the rest of the food to the oven for the evening meal?

Since many people are skeptical of a book with no independent sources backing up its claims, why didn't God wait to reveal himself until we had advanced enough to create audio and video recording devices? That way, there would be indisputable evidence of God's revelation.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>the purpose of creation is to give man an opportunity to follow virtue of his own free will (See beginning of Derech Hashem). God does not like to do PUBLIC miracles unless it is absolutely necessary as it interferes with His plan. (source Tov Halevanon commentary to shaar bitachon ch.4 on the part where Shmuel asked G-d \"How shall I go? For, if Saul hears, he will kill me.\")</p>\n\n<p>The Drashas Haran (forget the exact place) wrote that the giving of the torah had to be miraculous because there needed to be no doubt whatsoever that it was indeed from God. This is why it was preceded by the miracles of the ten plagues, and in Egypt which was the world center of witchcraft (so that people would not say Moshe was a sorcerer and if he did the plagues in Egypt, he would have been defeated). Likewise, Moshe was speech impaired so people would not say he was a great orator. And the final plague occured on passover, astrologically, the most powerful day of the egyption god, etc. many other factors.</p>\n\n<p>That said, God was forced to make these miracles to prove the authenticity of the torah. The torah had to be given back then at the inception of the jewish people as this was His plan. If you ask, why did God withhold technology for so long, why didn't He allow it back then so everything could be recorded? I think the answer is that man is too dangerous to be given modern technology. Once you have recording devices, then you have electricity, transistors, and eventually nuclear weapons. Man is much too dangerous to be given these things in the middle of history. Therefore it was withheld until the end of days which we are in now.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Even had God waited until there were cameras and recording devices, there would always be skeptics who would deny it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if we define our terms, we will find that there is no occasion for God to wait for cameras and recording devices.</p>\n<p>If we define revelation simply as \"to reveal something,\" then it is not true that revelation stopped at Sinai - before there were cameras and recording devices.</p>\n<p>Revelation did not cease; it is ongoing. It is not information that was revealed only through prophets. It is information about God contained in studying science and the world. The Psalmist explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork, — Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.” (Psalm 19)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Following the path set by R' Yehuda Halevi, Rambam and more:</p>\n\n<p>Our tradition is completely oral. Very few things were (initially) let to be written (תנ\"ך), the rest kept alive by oral tradition.</p>\n\n<p>As R' Yehuda Halevi writes in Kuzari - the Torah doesn't prove itself. The basis of Torah isn't the Torah. The very fact that is was passed down through the ages by many reliable people is strong evidence - as good as hard proof. That's why we believe it's true, and then we rely on all written. Otherwise you have sort of a paradox, as your question points out.</p>\n\n<p>Besides - how would proof help? Even participating in a miracle doesn't mean you get everything straight from there on (see Ma'amad Har Sinai & golden calf) what would a video clip do better?</p>\n\n<p>In Shmuel I chapter 7 it says: וינהו כל בית ישראל אחרי ה, the whole nation was yearning for G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Real belief comes from hard work of education - והלך מדי שנה בשנה... ושפט את ישראל - he would go round every year and judge (generally \"judging\" also meant teaching Torah) the people (ibid).</p>\n\n<p>Many people close their eyes to simple facts of reality. Even today there are people who have been through miracles (though not as explicit) and do not see the hand guiding these happenings.</p>\n\n<p>Remember Pharaoh after 10 miraculous plagues leaving no doubt of G-d - chasing Israel into the sea.

When the Torah <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">tells us, in a nutshell,</a> \"Build my tabernacle to all its specifications, but make sure nobody violates the sabbath,\" we understand that construction of the Mishkan itself, despite its heavenly goal, is prohibited on Shabbath because of the types of creative labor that are involved.  Essentially we read the command as, \"Build my tabernacle, but not on Shabbath.\" Then our Mesorah tells us specifically which activities were done that are prohibited, outlining for us what we may not do on any given Shabbath.</p>\n\n<p>See more here: <a href=\"http://www.torahweb.org/torah/2008/parsha/rros_vayakhel.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"The Relationship between Shabbat and the Construction of the Mishkan\"</a> by Rabbi Michael Rosensweig (Rosh Yeshiva at Yeshiva University)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I once heard a tape by <a href=\"http://audio.ohr.edu/showperson/id=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Uziel Milvsky</a> of ohr somayach entitle \"the Sabbath\". There he brings down that there is holiness in space (temple) and there is holiness in time (shabbat). The Sabbath is the temple in time. This is why there is so much parallels between the two. He didn't get into it much more than that, because it is probably heavily mystical as to the mechanics of a \"temple in time\". </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I would like to build off of SethJ's answer.  The idea is not that the milachas are based on the construction of the Mishkan.  Rather, the construction of the mishkan is <em>how we know</em> what the milachas are. What is forbidden on Shabbat is constructive labor (independent of anything having to do with the Mishkan).</p>\n\n<p>Now, to answer your question about the golden calf. You are right that we say that the Mishkan has something to do with the egel. If we hadn't done the egel hazahav, perhaps we would not have had a Mishkan. That would not mean that we wouldn't have the milachas of Shabbos, though. It would just mean that we would need a different example to teach us which actions are tantamount to constructive labor.</p>\n\n\n",

Bar Kamtza received an invitation to the party by mistake, but did not know of the mistake, and assumed that the host was ending an old feud.  Bar Kamtza suggested numerous compromises to avoid humiliation, but his host accepted none, and threw him out on his ear. </p>\n\n<p>Bar Kamtza then said to himself:  “Since the Rabbis were sitting there and did not stop him, this shows that they agreed with him. I will go and inform against them to the government.”  He then plotted to put the rabbis into a situation where they would have to choose between violating halacha and upsetting the Romans.  They chose the latter course, and this, the Gemara says, led to the siege of Jerusalem and its eventual destruction by the Romans.</p>\n\n<p>Question:  How do the commentators view the apparent silence of the rabbis during Bar Kamtza's humiliation?  Did they actually witness the event?  If they did, did they have a duty to intervene and stop the host?  Do any commentators take the rabbis to task for their silence?  Sorry to ask multiple questions, but I think they are all related and relevant to us today. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><em>Maharsha</em> writes on that story:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>הואיל והוו יתבי רבנן ולא מיחו בו:</strong> איכא למימר מה שלא מיחו מפני שלא היה בידם למחות אפשר שעשו כן כי החנופה היא שגברה באותו הדור כמ\"ש בסוטה\n  גבי אגריפס המלך</p>\n  \n  <p>One could say that the reason that the rabbis didn't object was\n  because they were not able to object.

However (he continues), even according to their assumption, they still should have gone beyond the letter of the law and objected. </p>\n\n<p>2) Rabbi Avigdor Miller (Torah Nation chapter 7 section 685-687) suggests that the Sages were correct to not defend Bar Kamtza - for historical documentation shows that Bar Kamtza was already aligned with the Roman enemies of the Jews, and as the Gemara notes in Sanhedrin 23a, the Sages of Jerusalem had standards for who was fit to be at a seudah together with them.</p>\n\n\n",

I always understood them to have \"daas Torah.\" But in recent years, I find that many people who have been labled \"Gedolei HaTorah\" (Great leaders of the Torah community) -- leaders of yeshivos and charedi communities here and in Israel -- have been caught making decisions, pronouncements, bans, denouncements, and defenses of the indefensible -- that have neither helped their community nor the Jewish community at large, and, if anything, failed to carry through basic Torah principles more often than not because the rabbis relied on false information.</p>\n\n<p>Based on sources, am I right for assuming that one does not have \"daas Torah\" simply because you head a yeshiva or sit on a council of \"Gedolei HaTorah\"?  Is there a way to identify who does or does not possess this insight?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rabbi Elchanan Wasserman H''yd addressed this question</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Kovetz Maamarim V'Igros - medor davar ldor</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Large numbers of organizations have sprouted amongst the Jewish people of all forms. All of them worry and are concerned on finding solutions as to how to improve our situation. But what is coming out of all these solutions and strategies that came to us from all directions? The problems just increase and intensify. We are dropping both physically and spiritually.</p>\n  \n  <p>Why do all these advices bring exactly the opposite result?</p>\n  \n  <p>In order for one to be reliable to give proper and beneficial advice, a man must contain the following mental conditions.</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>That he is a bar daas (is intelligent and understanding).</p></li>\n  <li><p>That he is not nogea bdavar (has a personal bias) on the matter that he is judging and advising. Because, after there is in his heart a negius (bias), even if he is the greatest bar daas in the world, he is not fit to see straight. This is a law of nature, the ratzon (will/desire) of a person is mashpia (bears influence) on his intellect. And according to the greatness of the ratzon, so too will be the greatness of the hashpa (influence).</p></li>\n  <li><p>We are warned in the torah that a judge must be \"sone betza\" (hate bribes) (Shmos 18.21, Rambam Sanhedrin 2.7). On the surface we could say, who cares if the judge loves bribes? It is forbiden for him to take it. And if it is forbidden then in this matter that he is judging for us, certainly he has not accepted a bribe. If so what does it matter how he conducts his personal life and whether or not he loves a bribe? The answer is that if someone loves a bribe, and likewise he who has other (selfish) desire, behold he is a nogea (bias) in every side and step of his life. Such a man is constantly involved in his desires. And since desire influences the intellect, to tilt it and twist it. Therefore the intellect of such a person is so twisted and full of distortions that even if he comes to judge on a matter in which he had no personal interest he is judging (the matter) with a twisted intellect (megamati meukom). What comes out from this is an additional condition: Not only that there should not be any personal negius (bias) in the matter he is judging now, but also that the judge should be clean of negius in all areas of his life. He needs to be a man liberated and completely free from any interest whatsoever - then perhaps he will merit a straight intellect.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Even if a man has merited a straight intellect. Behold, like the words of Rabeinu Bechaye in \"Duties of the Heart\" (Gate of Service of G-d, ch.2) - \"the intellect of man has limits, until here he can come but no further\". And how far is mortal man capable of seeing? It is thus necessary on the one who gives advice to contain \"daas torah\" (broad understanding of torah perspective), which is infinite and dwells in the heart of every ben torah.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>In simple (torah educated) people it is mixed with all types of influences and ideas from the street, or the like. And according to how great the mixture is, so too will be the diminishing of the percentage of \"daas torah\" . Therefore a man who is fit to be a reliable advisor is obligated to prepare in his heart \"daas torah\", 100% clean, with no trace of mixture of other daas whatsoever.</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>Even if a man already includes all the conditions mentioned above, he still needs to merit a special power which is greater than all of them as in the words of the Sages \"asukei shmasa aliba dhilchasa\" (the ability to extract the true interpretation in torah) - siyata dshmaya (supernatural help from G-d), (see talmud sanhedrin 106b). According to the natural order it is impossible for a man to grasp correctly by himself true daas torah. Behold - a man cannot know the daas on High (of G-d). It is for this that it is necessary siyata d'shmaya, which is a special type of gift, which only rare and special sages reach.

Rabbi Soloveichik reversed course later in life and his sermon \"Joseph and his Brothers\" stated that matters of Jewish thought aren't ruled-upon the same way; in fact, G-d had ruled in accordance with the Mizrachi (i.e. religious Zionist) Jews. Someone asked Rabbi Soloveichik, \"but what about daas torah?\" \"Don't tell me 'daas torah' after the Holocaust\", he replied.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Mordechai Willig: there's no need to say that Soloveichik ever retracted. But there are two major caveats to the concept of 'daas torah' - superiority of Torah scholar's opinions on all contemporary matters - as advanced by Soloveichik in his eulogy for Grozinski. A.] Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grozinski was a general \"posek.\" He ruled on agunah questions, kashrus questions, shabbos questions, and every other field on practical halacha. He was thus also qualified to rule on political questions. Rabbi Willig then cautiously observes that many \"big rabbi\" names today are known for the leadership of a yeshiva or Hassidic group, but many are not known for regularly ruling on matters of technical halacha; they would thus not merit the same \"daas Torah\" attributed to Grozinski by Soloveichik. B.] There can be many different opinions.

The Pharisees said that the Messiah will be the son of David, and Jesus reportedly counted: \"'How then does David in the spirit call him 'Lord,' saying: 'The Lord said to my Lord, \"Sit at My right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool\"? If David then called him Lord, how is he his son?' And no one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.\" This conversation could not have happened! Matthew is referring to Psalm 110:1, and is based on a clear mistranslation. The first \"Lord\" in the sentence is properly capitalized because it uses the four-letter Hebrew name for G-d, the Yud kay vav kay. We would pronounce that in prayer as \"Adonai,\" which means Lord and only applies to G-d. The second \"Lord\" is improperly capitalized because the Hebrew word used at that point is \"adoni\" which means \"my lord\" and only refers to a human. So Psalms 110:1 should read: \"The Lord said unto my lord, sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.\" So who is the second and lower-cased \"lord\"? King David. This psalm begins \"LeDavid Mizmor\" (A song to David as opposed to by David). Accordingly, the song is written for David and makes him the subject of the first sentence. With that knowledge, the rest of the psalm makes perfect sense, G-d is giving much needed comfort to the King of Israel. Alternatively, it can be understood as a psalm written by David to be sung by the Levite choir praising him after his death. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Certainly any Pharisee would have known the meaning of Psalm 110 and would not have been confused by \"Adonai\" versus \"adoni\". It is not so clear that a Greek-educated story teller with little or no Jewish training, and a Christian axe to grind, would have been so knowledgeable. The story in Matthew then must be made up and judged self-serving. </p>\n\n<p>See Levine, Samuel, <I>You Take Jesus, I'll Take God</i>, Hamorah Press 1980, p. 37-38; and the Jews for Judaism article on <a href=\"http://jewsforjudaism.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=154%3adoes-psalms-1101-show-that-the-messiah-will-be-greater-than-david-and-be-a-divine-being-&catid=49%3atrinity&Itemid=501\">Does Psalms 110:1 show that the Messiah will be greater than David and be a divine being?</a> </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As noted in the Yahoo answer linked in the question, we do not understand \"adoni\", \"my lord\", to be a divine reference.

A heretic once challenged a certain thinker with the argument, \"Astronomically speaking, what is man? One infinitesimal speck in the vast cosmos!\" To which the thinker replied, \"Astronomically speaking, man is the astronomer!\"</p>\n<p>In fact, Radak on verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.8.3?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:3</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast laid the foundation of Strength: – The first of the distinguishing marks in man after his coming into the (light and) air of the world is the power to suck. <strong>It is needful that man should confess the Creator and recognise His might and power on account of His works that are visible in heaven and in earth</strong>. And also from the constitution of his body, which is created from a drop of seed which turns to blood, and from that grows little by little until the limbs are perfectly formed and it comes forth into the (light and) air of the world. He has already made mention of this in the Psalm \"O Lord, Thou hast searched vie and known\" (cxxxix. infra). In the present Psalm he says that <strong>the wonders of the Creator and His loving-kindness to man are to be recognised from the moment of his first coming into the (light and) air of the world, and from his early infancy.</strong> It is for this reason that he uses the word יסדת (Thou hast laid the foundation); for, just as יסוד (foundation) is the beginning of the building, so the suckling period is the beginning of the (power to) recognise the loving-kindness of the Creator towards man after his coming into the (light and) air of the world, because the Holy One - Blessed be He ! - has made for him in the breasts an incision like the eye-hole of a fine needle. It is no wider, for if it were wider, the milk would flow forth in a stream without sucking, and too much would come into his mouth, so that he would be choked by it; and if it were smaller than it is, sucking would be difficult to the child and his lips would become painful. Everything, however, is in due proportion and measure. Further, He has distinguished man from the rest of the creatures in that He has put his mother's teats in the place of understanding, as our Rabbis of blessed memory have remarked (Babli, Berakhoth 10 a). It is for this reason that he says: Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast laid the foundation of strength, that man may be able to see that all is within the design of a Designer, and not, as the enemies of the Lord say, that everything happens by nature and chance without the direction of a Director and the design of a Designer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the question that we read in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.8.4-6?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:4-6</a> one should read as an expression of aknowledgement of G-d's greatness, awesomeness, kindness, might, intelligence, etc. It is for the sake of such an aknowledgment and expression of grattitude G-d deems man significant. Hence, the ending <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.8.10?lang=bi&with=Radak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:10</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יְהֹוָ֥ה אֲדֹנֵ֑ינוּ מָה־אַדִּ֥יר שִׁ֝מְךָ֗ בְּכׇל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃</p>\n<p>O Hashem, our Master, how majestic is Your name throughout the earth!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי לֹא מַחְשְׁבוֹתָיו מַחְשְׁבוֹתֵינוּ וְלֹא דְרָכָיו דְּרָכֵינוּ</p>\n<p>for His thoughts are not our thoughts and His ways are not our ways (Yeshayahu 55:8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>An analogy is given of a father playing with his son. The father pretends to enjoy the game, so that he can bond with his son, but it's only pretend - the father can't actually lose sight of the fact that he is an adult who has more sophisticated pleasures.</p>\n<p>So too, they say, with Hashem. Mitzvot are the game, and we are the child. He doesn't really see any significance in this - He is Infinite, so we are less than ants, and the game is less important to Him than playing \"horsey\" is to a flesh-and-blood father with his son.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the emotional arousal from Hashem is not real. It's only from our point of view, only an act, for our sake.</p>\n<p>Is this analogy correct?</p>\n<h4>Are Mitzvot Significant to Him?</h4>\n<p>According to Yom Simchat Torah 5674 <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=60796&st=&pgnum=212&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">כל המצות מתייחסים אל העצמות</a>, the Mitzvot are from Him, Himself. In Kabbalah, there is a term for Hashem: \"Ein Sof\", often translated as \"infinite\", because that's what it literally means; without end. This is a misnomer and it wasn't meant to mean infinite (See Samech Vov- <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58811&st=&pgnum=9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">יו״ט של ראש השנה רס״ו</a>).</p>\n<p>It means \"without limit\", and that means that we cannot put any limit on Hashem Himself at all. Even \"infinite\" is a limit. Even saying \"He hasn't got the power of finitude\" is a limit. Ein Sof refers to Hashem Himself, beyond all limit and definition, beyond all description (even \"negative\" description as per Moreh Nevuchim). See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gevurot_Hashem%2C_Second_Introduction_to_Gevurot_Hashem.2?ven=hebrew%7CGevurot_Hashem,_with_footnotes_and_annotations_by_Rabbi_Yehoshua_D._Hartman,_Machon_Yerushalyim,_2015-2020&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">גבורות השם, הקדמה ב</a>.</p>\n<p>According to this source, this is Who the Mitzvot are relevant to. This is their \"origin\". The Mitzvot are not a \"game\" to Him, nor are they \"contrived\" for our physical existence. They are His ultimate choice - He chooses Mitzvot, and good, and rejects Averot and evil in the most magnificent form of choice and rejection, deriving from nothing other than Himself; Ein Sof. See <a href=\"https://col.org.il/files/uploads/original/2019/03/5ca061c194a16_1554014657.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ד\"ה מנין שקושרין תר\"ל כ\"ק אדמו\"ר מהר\"ש</a></p>\n<p>So, the Mitzvot are not a game, nor are they in any way beneath Him. They are important to Him on His \"highest level\"; His true Self, as \"sophisticated\" as He truly is.</p>\n<h4>Are we significant to Him?</h4>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://he.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4279908\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בשעה שהקדימו תשי״ב</a>, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/3798076/jewish/Mayim-Rabbim-5738.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מים רבים תשל\"ח</a>, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/3798073/jewish/BeYom-Ashtei-Asar-Yom-5731.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ביום עשתי עשר יום תשל\"א</a> and many other places, we are even more significant to Hashem than the Mitzvot. We are His innermost choice and delight, and no words can truly capture how truly <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/108779/does-god-need-us/136415#136415\">essential we are to Him</a>.</p>\n<p>These sources paint a picture about Hashem's \"consulting of the Tzaddikim\" before anything existed, He \"looked\" - not at angelic spirits in heaven, but at the very picture of Jews as they would one day serve Him on earth. Their future Torah, mitzvot and self‑refinement rose in His Thought, giving Him inner delight.</p>\n<p>That delight itself became the blueprint and motivation for creation: \"With whom did He consult? - With the souls of the righteous.\" In other words, the world was brought into being because of the Divine pleasure in the human Avodah that would unfold within it; creation is the stage on which that foreseen service moves from potential to actuality.</p>\n<p>You could say \"He never wanted to get married, until He met us\" as a good mashal. So therefore, we are not like toddlers to Him at all.</p>\n<h4>So how do we resolve the logic of the mashal?</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/149274/what-does-this-midrash-imply-about-how-valuable-our-deeds-are-to-hashem\">\"It's not what you think\"</a>.</p>\n<p>It's true, we are absolutely nothing compared to Him. However, as the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4094760/jewish/Mitzvas-Haamanas-Elokus-Section-8.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzemach Tzeddek puts it</a>, לֹא מַחְשְׁבוֹתָיו מַחְשְׁבוֹתֵינוּ - His thoughts are not our thoughts. My thoughts can not create anything, my desire on its own doesn't produce any results. He does. He doesn't contrive anything, like the father of the mashal; He doesn't have any difficulty finding significance in us, or our Mitzvot; He is Ein Sof and has no limitations, and therefore we cannot and should not draw these analogies.</p>\n<p>In fact, \"nothing to Him\", on the level of Ein Sof, means \"He is so intimately close to us, He doesn't even see us as separate from Him at all\".</p>\n\n\n",

If they wouldn't have the klaf at the proper time and have it now before davening can it be read at that time?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See the following related discussion:\nQuestion: I have questions about the Kri’at Hatorah (Torah reading = laining) of Mincha of Shabbat regarding cases (common in the army) where we will not have access to a sefer Torah at the time we can daven Mincha. Can we read it in the morning after Mussaf? If we davened without Kri’at Hatorah and then we got access to a sefer Torah, can we lain at that point?</p>\n\n<p>Answer: The poskim discuss whether people who missed Kri’at Hatorah at Shacharit during the week can make it up at Mincha. On one hand, the logic of the Kri’at Hatorah (not going three days without public Torah learning- Bava Kama 82a) applies all day. On the other hand, once the Rabbis set a time to do this, perhaps that cannot be changed, as the Rambam (Tefilla 12:1) seems to posit. In practice, most Ashkenazim allow the Mincha make-up (Mishna Berura 135:1; this was Rav Soloveitchik’s weekly practice). Sephardim are less likely to accept this practice (see Yosef Ometz 27; Yabia Omer IV, Orach Chayim 17).\nIt is much more problematic to do the Kri’at Hatorah of Shabbat Mincha earlier. The gemara (Bava Kama 82a) says that this reading was instituted because of yoshvei keranot. Rashi explains that these are people who do not hear Kri’at Hatorah on Monday and Thursday, who get to hear an additional reading on Shabbat. The Shita Mekubetzet says that since people are liable to get drunk during the day, Kri’at Hatorah was instituted to encourage them to go to shul. According to the Shita Mekubetzet, the time of day is an important part of the institution. Even according to Rashi, claims that Tzitz Eliezer (X, 20), it appears that Kri’at Hatorah of Mincha was instituted as a distinct laining in terms of content and timing, and therefore, when the gemara (Bava Kama 82a) says “at Mincha,” it means it. The Tzitz Eliezer also cites Kabbalistic reasons for having the Kri’at Hatorah (and U’va L’tziyon) at the time of Mincha. Based on the above, even if a community will not have the opportunity to lain at Mincha, they may not do so in the morning.\nDoing Kri’at Hatorah in the half hour between chatzot (astronomical/halachic midday) and the time in our calendars for Mincha is far less problematic. There are several indications that, fundamentally, the time for Mincha is chatzot, just that we wait half-an-hour to make sure chatzot has passed (see Tosafot, Nida 63b; Magen Avraham 458:1). We know of no proofs that this precaution applies to Kri’at Hatorah, although the Tzitz Eliezer (ibid.) assumes it follows the same rules as Mincha. Also, the Mishna Berura (233:2) raises the serious possibility that after the fact, if one davened Mincha after chatzot he fulfilled his mitzva. Therefore, if the latest that a group can lain is during this half-hour, they may do so.\nRegarding Kri’at Hatorah after davening Mincha, the Eshel Avraham (Butchatch, 292) is uncertain about the matter. Yaskil Avdi (VIII, OC 38) assumes that people who have already davened may lain afterward. During the week, it is very accepted (see Yalkut Yosef, OC 135:(6)) to do Kri’at Hatorah after davening when it was not possible to do it in its place (e.g., if people daven in a mourner’s home without a sefer Torah). Our case is a little worse in that Kri’at Hatorah should be before Mincha, as opposed to at Shacharit, where Kri’at Hatorah is anyway after Shemoneh Esrei (the main part of tefilla). However, there are strong indications that, fundamentally, Kri’at Hatorah is a separate obligation from tefilla, even though it is preferably attached to it. One such source is the Terumat Hadeshen (15; see Shulchan Aruch, OC 55:2) who says that if there was a minyan to start Chazarat Hashatz and then people left, the remaining group can continue all parts of tefilla that are connected to Shemoneh Esrei (including Kaddish Shalem). However, he says, they can not lain because it is not intrinsically connected to tefilla. Therefore, we conclude that a minyan of people can lain after Mincha if a sefer Torah becomes available then.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://eretzhemdah.org/newsletterArticle.asp?lang=en&pageid=48&cat=7&newsletter=1108&article=4179\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://eretzhemdah.org/newsletterArticle.asp?lang=en&pageid=48&cat=7&newsletter=1108&article=4179</a></p>\n\n\n",

Isru chag is kept outside Israel on Friday meaning basically eating a special meal. If anything Isru chag is more important on shvuous since there is no chol hamoed. Also a yahrzeit does not have to fast.\nIn Israel six days after shvuous they dont say tachnun because in keeping with pesach and succos one could still bring the yom tov offerings.

In order to be sure that we keep Yom Tov on the correct day, we keep two days.</p>\n\n<p>What I don't understand however, is why is this not the minhag in Eretz Yisrael? After all, just because you live in Eretz Yisrael today, it doesn't mean you are not technically in Golus. Also, there is no Sanhedrin in Eretz Yisrael today just as much as there is no Sanhedrin in Chutz L'Aretz today - meaning there is no central body anywhere to establish when Rosh Chodesh is.</p>\n\n<p>According to all these educated assumptions, I can't see why Israelis would hold one day while British Jews, for example, keep two.</p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate very much if someone could clarify.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Ramban gives the date of today's fixed calendar at about 386 CE. Before that point, the Jews in Israel received a messenger informing them of the proper date of yomtov, and thus kept one day. The Jews outside of Israel did not get a messenger in time and thus kept two days to play it safe.</p>\n\n<p>Around 386, when the calendar was fixed, the policy became to keep things more or less the way they had been -- if you were in Israel, keep one day, if you weren't, keep two.</p>\n\n<p>When we say \"galus\", sometimes (e.g. in a Tisha B'Av sense) we mean \"there is no Temple anymore\"; but here we mean very simply \"outside of Israel.\" There were 300 years when the Temple had been destroyed and yet there were Jews in Israel who could still be informed that the new moon had been sanctified (by a Sanhedrin located in the north of Israel, where things were more stable). And in 386, Hillel (great-great-etc. grandson of the famous one) used his Sanhedrin to sanctify the calendar for hundreds of years into the future.)</p>\n\n<p>Rambam's opinion is that those locations that were within messenger distance still keep one day, and those that aren't keep two; unless we know otherwise, we use as a rule of thumb the Mishnaic borders (per <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h36.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gittin 1:2</a>, Ashkelon to the south, Ako the north, Rekem the east, and implicitly the Mediterranean Sea to the west).</p>\n\n<p>Fascinatingly, Ritva opines that when we switched to a fixed calendar, the decree was to change the borders of the practice as well -- from here on out, when they said \"Israel\" they meant the Biblical borders; when they said \"not Israel\" they meant beyond those borders. (Even though this did not match the exact parameters of the older practice, but it made for a simpler policy.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This Halakha comes from Takannah made by Chazal, in other words it is a m'd'rabbanan.

However, this still does not apply to all of modern day Israel.

    "content": "# Sofek in Bircas HaTorah -- why not say all of the brachas?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The M\"B brings in the beginning of Siman 47 from the Shagas Aryeh (Siman 24-25) that if one is in sofek (doubt) if they said Bircas HaTorah then they should go back and say the bracha however only the bracha of \"asher bachar banu\" (And not all three brachas that we say lichatchila.) This goes in accordance with the Rishonim that hold Bircas HaTorah is min haTorah. </p>\n\n<p>However why to say only one? I realize the Shagas Aryeh says because if you say one you have fulfilled your obligation from the Torah and the other 2 brachos are then considered to be only d'rabbanan and then we wouldn't say those because of a doubt. However we see by Bircas HaMazon that if one is in sofek if they said it or not (and ate to the point of being satiated) then they must now say it (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 184:4.) The M\"B there in Note 13 says that one should even say the 4th bracha which is only d'rabbanan in order that one should not be m'zalzel (make light of?) the brachas of Bircas HaMazon.</p>\n\n<p>Why according to the Shagas Aryeh and what he says about Bircas HaTorah would this not apply? Even if with one bracha you are yotzee m'doraisa (making the other 2 then d'rabbanan.) However why doesnt' this idea of not wanting to be m'zalzel not apply in this case of Bircas HaTorah.</p>\n\n<p>(<strong><em>Note:</em></strong> I'm asking this only according to the Shagas Aryeh because I don't know what the Rishonim that hold Bircas HaTorah is d'oraisa would say in this case. Perhaps they would hold that one should say all 3 brachas again, maybe not? If someone has a proof to this either way please edit or comment. As well perhaps this can only be asked on the Shagas Aryeh if the whole idea of saying the 4th bracha as well is a \"later\" idea. THe M\"B brings the makor for not being \"m'zalzel\" from \"Achronim\". However I don't know what the earlier sources say. Perhaps someone could help with this as well.)</p>\n\n\n",

In either case, the point is that it demonstrates that languages do evolve organically, especially when regional divisions are considered.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do we know that homosexual relations is a sin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently heard that the Ibn Ezra brings down a minority opinion that the pasukim talking about \"laying with a man as you would a woman\" are actually talking about androgynous people. The Ibn Ezra disagrees with that, but he cites it nonetheless.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, modern Jewish Orthodoxy rejects this viewpoint, but after hearing it, I can't help but question why that is the case.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I think you are misunderstanding what that opinion held. The text of Ibn Ezra is (to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919#v22\">Lev 18:22</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר רב חננאל ז\"ל, כי יש מי שיחדש בגופו כצורת בשר אשה וזה לא יתכן בתולדה. וי\"א אנדרוגינוס. וכל הצער הזה בעבור היות משכבי אשה לשון רבים. ודברי יחיד שני משכבים. והנכון בעיני, כי המצוה כפשוטה. גם אנשי התושיה חייבו מיתה עליה והכתוב אחז דרך כבוד לאמר כמו לא תקרב, ואחר שהזכר נברא לעשות והנקבה להעשות, הזכיר הכתוב שלא תהפוך דברי השם, ויש משכב להוציא הזרע, על כן מלת משכבי לשון רבים, ואין ראוי להאריך.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The textual problem is that the verse prohibits lying with a man in משכבי אשה \"the ways of lying with a woman\", in the plural. This plural form of \"ways\" is understood in a number of places to refer to both vaginal and anal intercourse (Kiddushin 22b, Yevamot 6:1-2). In the case of male homosexual relations, there is no second \"way\", yet the verse said \"ways\". Rav Channanel is quoted as suggesting that men may sometimes develop female genitalia, but Ibn Ezra rejects this as impossible. He then quotes \"some\" who suggest that vaginal intercourse with an androgynous male is included in the prohibition and constitutes the second \"way\" (one opinion in the Talmud Yevamot 83b indeed learns this rule from this word, though we don't rule accordingly (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5101.htm#15\">Rambam Issurei Biah 1:15</a>)). Ibn Ezra then suggests that the correct read is just that \"ways\" is not an improper word to use in context for various technical reasons, and there is no need to find a second \"way\" for the prohibition to happen.</p>\n\n<p>Thus none of the quoted opinions dispute that regular homosexual intercourse is biblically prohibited.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>[<strong><em>Edit for clarification</strong>: As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/28851\">DoubleAA mentioned</a>, the interpretation is apparently presented incorrectly in the OP. The rejected interpretation mentioned by the Ibn Ezra merely suggests that relations between a male and a hermaphrodite are included in the scriptural prohibition, not to the exclusion of standard משכב זכר</em>].</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This interpretation that the Ibn Ezra mentions and rejects is an interpretation of the simple meaning (<em>p'shat</em>) of the verse (<em>Vayikra</em> 18:22). It is likely that the Ibn Ezra rejects this as the simple meaning of the verse because it's doesn't make sense in the context of <em>Vayikra</em> 20:13, which explicitly refers to two males. </p>\n\n<p>Regardless, for halachic purposes, we are concerned with the exegesis of the verse, not the simple interpretation. Exegetically, the Talmud derives from the phrasing \"ואיש אשר ישכב את-זכר\" (<em>Vayikra</em> 20:13, \"<em>And a man who lies with a male</em>...\") that the violation involves a man engaging in relations with another male of any age (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 54a). The Talmud explains that the term זכר (\"male\") cannot be an exclusive reference to hermaphrodites (<em>Chagiga</em> 4a), even though this particular biblical prohibition applies not only to standard משכב זכר but also inclusively to a man copulating with a hermaphrodite (<em>Y'vamos</em> 82b).</p>\n\n<p>\"משכבי אשה\" (<em>Vayikra</em> 20:13, \"...<em>the manners of lying with a woman</em>...\") is interpreted exegetically as a halachic comparison between ביאה כדרכה and ביאה שלא כדרכה for a woman. As far as simple interpretations of that expression in the context of the verse, see the Ibn Ezra (<em>Vayikra</em> 18:22) and Rashi (ibid., 20:13).</p>\n\n\n",

used 7 \"Sefiros\" to create the world, so it had to be in 7 days, one day for each Sefirah. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On the one hand the Sages tell us that the world was created with ten\n  qualities1 and ten utterances2—which the mystics understand3 to\n  correspond to the ten sefirot.4 This explains why ten is considered a\n  \"complete\" number.5 Examples: a) Every physical object comprises three\n  dimensions. Each dimension is composed of a beginning, end and body.\n  Together with the space it occupies, every entity has ten components.\n  b) A person's life is divided into decades; each decade with a unique\n  theme.6 c) A quorum of ten is needed to constitute a minyan.7</p>\n  \n  <p>On the other hand, we find other sources that speak of G‑d creating\n  the world with only the final seven8 sefirot.9 <strong><em>This is why the world\n  was created in seven days—each day corresponding to one of these\n  spiritual tools, and the creations of each day are a reflection of the\n  divine attribute that dominated on that particular day.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if there are 10 Sefiors in reality, why wasn't it created in 10 days? He explains more in the article, but I've quoted the direct answer:\n.....</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The same is true of the divine sefirot. Directly involved in the\n  creation of the world are only the seven emotional traits. But G‑d's\n  Wisdom, Understanding, and Knowledge are heavily invested in\n  creation,10 albeit in a more concealed and indirect manner.11</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>here are the notes / sources from that article</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Talmud Chagigah 12a.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Ethics 5:1.</p></li>\n  <li><p>See Midrash Shmuel on Ethics ibid.; Zohar II 42b ff.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The fact that the first three sefirot, the intellectual faculties, are also involved in creation is also evident from Sefer Yetzirah\n  (1:1), \"The world was created by three: ...the Book, the Scribe, and\n  the Narrative.\" Chassidic teachings (see e.g. Ushavtem 5634) explains\n  this as referring to Chochmah, Binah, and Da'at.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Since the Torah is the blueprint of all creation (see below, footnote 10), the fact that the world was created with ten tools\n  (which results in ten being a \"perfect\" number) is because the Torah\n  itself is rooted in the Ten Commandments.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Ethics 5:22.</p></li>\n  <li><p>See Likutei Sichot vol. 30 p. 2 ff.</p></li>\n  <li><p>In many of the sources, it speaks only of six Sefirot—i.e. Chesed through Yesod.

The Rambam attested about himself that he read every book composed on religion available in Arabic; his greatness was that he was able to assimilate those ideas which he felt contributed toward understanding Judaism. R. Kook responded sharply to the (frum) historian Zev Yavetz who criticized the Rambam as unduly influenced by Greek philosophy. In the words of R. Kook (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%94_-_%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%97%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%95_%D7%A9%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Ma’amarei ha-ra’ayah</em></a>, vol. 1, p. 105):</p>\n\n<p>חלילה לנו להוציא לעז של חיצוניות וקל וחומר של יוניות וזרות על אלה הדעות אשר קדשתם רוחו הקדוש של רבינו הגדול הרמב\"ם ז\"ל</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the Rambam held a position, according to R. Kook, means that it cannot be considered \"foreign.\" That said, scholars may overstate the influence of Islam on the Rambam. For a book length treatment on the Rambam in his Islamic milieu, see Sarah Stroumsa, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Maimonides_in_His_World.html?id=DhaunpbZYSYC\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Maimonides in His World: Portrait of a Mediterranean Thinker</em></a>. For an encyclopedia article on the topic see <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/maimonides-islamic/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I read this chapter <a href=\"http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/ej.9789004173330.i-358.39\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/ej.9789004173330.i-358.39</a> and I am not so fond of what he says. He states according to Ibn al-Qifti, from which most scholars quote the alleged apostacy, said that RaMbaM read the Quran and participated in the prescribed prayers during the period in which he acted ostensibly as a Muslim. Ibn Abi Usaybi'a reports taht RaMbaM learned the Quran by heart and engaged in the study of Islamic law. Al-Safadi claims that on a ship in which RaMbaM traveled from Morocco to ArasS Yisroel, he participated in the tarawih prayers for the month of Ramadan. However, the chapter goes on to say that these allegations appear to be fallacious, and contemporary scholarly opinion is divided on the question of RaMbaM's forced apostasy while in Morocco. Ibn al-Qifti recounts how an Andalusian Muslim met RaMbaM in Egypt and saw that he reverted to Judaism. The case was brought before RaMbaM's patron, the qadi al-Fadil al-Baysani, who ruled the conversion to Islam under coercion was invalid and acquitted RaMbaM. Skeptics cite this as proof of the spuriousness of Ibn al-Qifti's account, since one who apostatizes from Islam is liable to death penalty. The author then brings that an Andalusian writer Ibn al-Attar states that if a dhimmi was coerced to accept Islam and later reverted to his former religion, he was not to be penalized, and this rule was repeated by RaMbaM's Andalusian contemporary, al-Yaziri. In Egypt, Christians and presumably Jews, who had been forced to convert to Islam under al-Hakim, were subsequently allowed by him and his son to revert to their former religion. In the Cairo genizah, there is evidence that Yamanite Jews who accepted Islam rather than execution in 1199 were permitted to openly espouse Judaism in 1202. The author then goes on to state the Epistle of Consolation by RaMbaM's father and the Epistle to Yaman by RaMbam himself which both talk about forced conversion of Jews to Islam and that these letters both show that both RaMbaM and his father were against Islam. </p>\n\n<p>I am not a Arabic specialist so I don't know what is really said in those books by the Arab writers which were quoted, however I am sure there is hard evidence against them as well. I listened to a lecture about this topic: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-Wt2g7D9ks\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-Wt2g7D9ks</a> and I forgot what they say about this conversion, however I do remember that it is not really proven and is really unlikely.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>Quoted from <a href=\"http://rabbimichaelsamuel.com/2010/02/did-maimonides-convert-to-islam-in-his-youth/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A Controversial Subtext to Maimonides Epistle<br>\n  Maimonides’ liberal\n  attitude toward the Jew who was forcibly<sup>citation needed</sup>\n  converted to Islam may have an interesting subtext. Some Jewish and\n  Muslim scholars (see the Islamic Encyclopedia for the bibliography)\n  think that Maimonides was forced to convert to Islam as a child.\n  However, at the first opportunity to return to his faith, and returned\n  he did.  The source for this claim derives from an accusation a Muslim\n  visitor to Cairo from Fez, who allegedly <strong>remembered Maimonides as a\n  Muslim when he lived in Morocco</strong>. Thirty years later, the Muslim\n  acquaintance was traveling through Egypt and was surprised to discover\n  that Maimonides had become Egypt’s most distinguished rabbi. Outraged,\n  the Muslim denounced him to the authorities as an apostate. </p>\n  \n  <p>However philosopher and historian Allan Nadler observes:  “Maimonides\n  practiced the time-honored medieval Islamic tradition of Taqiyya, or\n  prudent dissimulation, by dressing and behaving like a Muslim\n  publicly, perhaps occasionally presenting himself at a mosque, while\n  remaining an observant Jew during the darkest period of Almohad\n  persecution, which forced Jews to dress in hideous costumes and\n  resulted in thousands of forced apostasies and deaths. There is simply\n  no credible evidence that Maimonides converted, let alone that he was\n  a “practicing Muslim.” The above was quoted from a Jewish\n  interpretation:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above quote is clearly biased to prove that Maimonides was forcibly converted to Islam, most probably he liked becoming a Muslim. None of the primary sources explicitly say that he forcibly converted to Islam, as those who reported him as a Muslim viewed him to be an Islamic scholar(As Allan Nadler points out that he may be actually doing Taqqiya which the Jewish law allows to do)</p>\n\n<p>Also, There is enough proof to make it obvious that most of his works were deeply influenced by Islamic theology and doctrines:</p>\n\n<p>e.g: The 13 principles of Judaism never existed until Rambam got inspired from <a href=\"http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=articles&id=134429\" rel=\"nofollow\">the 6 articles of Muslim faith</a> .

Due to this inability to source his claims in the Misnah Torah,<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishneh_Torah%23Critics_and_criticism\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam was severly opposed by Rabbis of his time for trying to introduce the Islamic methods and androgogy.Moreover he used  Judeo-Arabic instead of the customary Talmudic idiom for his works.</a></p>\n\n\n",

As such, the vav is potentially original. Admittedly this suggestion is not entirely certain and therefore is not a complete answer to your question. However, it gives a theory about why this \"unnatural\" and apparently unique form you note exists here.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Completely off the top of my head, with no source:</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the Torah uses a singular verb for 2 people (e.g. וילך משה ואהרן, Shemot 4:29) to indicate that Moshe was primary and Aharon was going along with him.</p>\n\n<p>When there are 3 people, if two of them are primary and one is going along with them, there's no way to indicate that with just the verb.  Maybe that's what's happening here: וילכו אליפז ובלדד, and the lack of a vav means that Tzofar was going with them, but not important in his own right.</p>\n\n<p>And we see this borne out in the third round of back and forth with Iyov, when Tzofar didn't say anything.  See the Malbim 32:15, where he says that Elihu was making fun of Tzofar for this.</p>\n\n\n",

He says speaking about an unrelated matter would constitute sufficient interruption according to some but not others. He says also that, although walking to the synagogue does not constitute a sufficient interruption, some hold that a new blessing would be said because the original blessing was in a different location. But he does not list any specific activity that would constitute sufficient interruption according to everyone. (<em>Rama</em> there, however, says that removing the first garment before donning the second would necessitate a blessing on the second.)</p>\n\n<p>Note, anyway, that the practice I'm familiar with (cited with approval by <em>MB</em> :24) is that someone planning to say a blessing when donning the <em>talis gadol</em> at <em>shacharis</em> does not say a blessing when donning the <em>talis katan</em> even if there is significant interruption between the two acts of donning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Two halakhos in sefer <em>Shoneh halakhos</em> by R' Chaim Kanievsky address the OP's question.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>8:41</strong>. If one blessed on the <em>talis katan</em> blessing <em>'al mitzvas tzitzis</em> and immediately took the <em>talis gadol</em>, even if the <em>talis gadol</em> is in another room, if the original intent was to fullfil the obligation of <em>tzitzis</em> - there is no need to make a blessing on <em>talis gadol</em>.

If one spoke for the purpose of putting the <em>talis gadol</em>, i.e. one said, \"Bring me <em>talis gadol</em>\" - it is not considered an interruption. However, if one spoke on any other matter, even one word, in this case the <em>poskim</em> argue. Thus, it is proper to be strict and not speak, but if one spoke - one does not need to make another blessing. (MB Si\"8, SK\"28, 35; see later Si'457 din 4 in Shoneh halakhos*)</p>\n<p>Here the reference MB Si\"3, SK\"30, 35 and <em>Biyur Halakhah</em> on words אם הי.</p>\n<p><strong>8:42</strong>. If a person walked <em>in between</em> (i.e. after putting on <em>talis katan</em> but before putting on <em>talis gadol</em>) from his house to the synagogue, or if he came out of his house and immediately returned <strong>some say</strong> that change of the place is a valid interruption. In any event, it is proper to be stringent not to bless if (3 conditions hold simultaneously):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the synagogue is not sufficiently far from his house,</li>\n<li>one did not divert one's attention in between,</li>\n<li>and originally one did not have intent to exempt <em>talis gadol</em> at the time of the blessing on <em>talis katan</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(MB S\"3, SK\"33, 34)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One needs to ask one's local Rav to determine whether the synagogue is sufficiently far from one's house.</p>\n\n\n",

Yehoshua ben Korchah states that the verb שטוח (\"spreading out\") in the next verse also implies שחוט, \"slaughtering,\" indicating that שליו is something that requires shechitah - thus excluding fish (and locusts). Although Rebbi disagrees with that exegesis, he doesn't seem to argue with the basic fact of what שליו is.</p>\n\n<p>(A few lines further down, the Gemara definitively identifies it as an avian species. First of all, it says that one variety of שליו is called פסיוני, which in Bava Kamma 55a is listed in a group of birds that are kilayim; second, it describes the שליו proper as כציפורתא, \"like a small bird.\")</p>\n\n<p>Also, in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=105&format=pdf\">Chullin 105a</a> the verse describing the aftermath, \"While the meat was still between their teeth...\" (11:33), is used as a source for the rule that you can't eat dairy while there is still meat stuck between your teeth.

Say a b'racha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The common and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/11303\">accepted</a> practice among married <em>Ashk'nazim</em>, at least, is that they don a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallit_katan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>talis katan</em></a> in the morning without saying a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berakhah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>b'racha</em></a> for the <em>mitzva</em>, and, later, when donning the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>talis gadol</em></a> for morning prayers, they say a <em>b'racha</em> to cover both <em>talisos</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But someone who borrows a <em>talis gadol</em> does not say a <em>b'racha</em> on it (<a href=\"http://mishnaberura.eu5.org/02_sh.html#HtmpReportNum0013_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Mishna B'rura</em> 14</a>:14, q.v.). So suppose someone arrives in the synagogue without having said a <em>b'racha</em> on his <em>talis katan</em> and realizes that he needs to borrow a <em>talis gadol</em> (where the loan is effected in such a manner as he would not normally be saying a <em>b'racha</em> on it<sup>[1]</sup>). What should he do?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Should he, perhaps, say the <em>b'racha</em> on the <em>talis gadol</em>, having in mind also the <em>talis katan</em> (and touching it or moving its strings as in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%97#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.98.D7.96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 8:16</a>, q.v.)?</p>\n\n<p>This seems reasonable, as the <em>talis katan</em> 'deserves' a <em>b'racha</em>, but the current act of donning is of a <em>talis gadol</em> (which anyway, according to some opinions, requires a <em>b'racha</em>. I'm following the <em>Mishna B'rura</em> that in this hypothetical scenario one would not normally follow those opinions — but perhaps they should be allowed for).</p></li>\n<li><p>Or should he say the standard <em>b'racha</em> for a <em>talis-katan</em> (\"<em>al mitzvas tzitzis</em>\") on the <em>talis katan</em> at that point?</p>\n\n<p>This seems reasonable, as he never said it on donning the <em>talis katan</em> and the usual reason for skipping it — that he'll later say a <em>b'racha</em> on the <em>talis gadol</em> — turns out not to have applied.</p></li>\n<li><p>Or should he say no <em>b'racha</em>?</p>\n\n<p>This seems unreasonable to me, but I consider it somewhat likely because we're generally strict about saying unnecessary <em>b'rachos</em> and because I haven't found a source that says he <em>should</em> say a <em>b'racha</em> in this case (and the case doesn't seem like a very rare one to me).</p></li>\n<li><p>Or what?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Footnotes:<br>\n<sup>[1]</sup> To clarify: Often, when someone 'borrows' a <em>talis gadol</em>, he actually gets it as a gift (to be returned), or is a part-owner, and may therefore say a <em>b'racha</em>.

The Big Question is regular פסיק רישא vs. מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong><br>\nThere is double machlokes that comes up between R.Shimon and R. Yehuda. R.Shimon holds \"דבר שאינו מתכוון is muttar (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%94_%D7%91_%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beitza 2:10</a>), while R.Yehuda holds its assur. R. Shimon holds מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה is assur (rabbinically) while R.Yehuda holds it d'oraysa. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Categories</strong><br>\n<strong>דבר שאינו מתכוון</strong> - when you do one act, and another secondary action also takes place. E.g. if you drag a light bench to bring somewhere, and it might cause a furrow to be dug, (the melahca of plowing). The shulchan aruch et.al. hold this is muttar (like R.Shimon), even if the secondary act is beneficial. </p>\n\n<p>A <strong>פסיק רישא</strong> is a davar sh'eino miskavein where the secondary act is for sure going to happen. E.g. if you drag a heavy bench somewhere, and it will definitely cause a furrow to be dug (which is also beneficial). This is forbidden even according to R. Shimon, and many views hold it is assur d'oraysa.</p>\n\n<p>A   <strong>פסיק רישא דלא ניחא ליה</strong> is simply a <strong>פסיק רישא</strong> where the secondary act is not beneficial (or worse). For example, if you get no benefit from the furrow your bench creates. While there were some who permitted this, most hold it is rabbinically forbidden (see שו\"ע או\"ח סימן שכ:יח).  </p>\n\n<p>The standard case of <strong>מלאכה שא\"צ לגופה</strong> is if you blow out a candle to make the room dark, but not to get ashes (the purpose of the melacha in the mishkan). I.e. you do a melacha but not לגופה, for its \"purpose\".  The Shulchan aruch et.al. again hold like R.Shimon, though some (the Rambam) hold like R.Yehudah. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Complexities</strong><br>\n<strong>מלאכה שא\"צ לגופה</strong>  also comes up when you dig to get dirt, but it results in a hole being built (melacha of boneh). This leads to various complexities and there are many different interpretations on how it differs from פסיק רישא.<br>\nAccording to a standard explanation, when you do an action (digging) for a different purpose (getting dirt) we can show its in a different form than the melacha in the mishkan, but when you do a different action (dragging a bench), you're intent no longer matters, and it may be d'oraysa (of plowing). There are still some difficulties, so there are other explanations and divisions between d'oraysa and derabanan. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbath.1.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Shabbos 1:7</a> of the Mishnah Torah,  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kessef_Mishneh_on_Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbath.1.7.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Kesef Mishna</a> brings HaRav Avraham Hachasid (Rambam's son) and explains <em>psik reisha</em> doesn't need the actual melacha, he brings the case of closing a door on a deer.By <em>melacha shaina tzricha</em> it is the melacha you want but not its purpose, ayin sham.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>I based this off one of the Aharonim I just don't remember right now which Aharon (I think it was the Rashash Ketuvot 6a).</em></p>\n\n<p>By Melacha Sheen Sarich Legufa: the actual action is a Melacha even if you don't want to do the Melacha it is inevidble because the action itself is a Melacha.</p>\n\n<p>By Pesik Reshe Delo Niha Le: The action itself isnt a Melacha but there is an inevidble Melacha that comes along with it.</p>\n\n<p><em>Now this is based off a few other Mefarshim:</em></p>\n\n<p>Pesik Reshe Delo Niha Le- is that he specifically doesn't want the Melacha that is occuring to occur because it's unncessary but it is inevidable</p>\n\n<p>Pesik Reshe Delo Ichpat Le- he doesn't care if it happens but it is inevidable. </p>\n\n\n",

Johanan, is the essential\n  difference between the Sukkah and the ethrog?24 — The other answered\n  him, The Sukkah which is fit to be used at twilight [after the seventh\n  day], for were he perchance to have a meal at that time he would be\n  expected to sit therein and eat there, is set aside for its ritual\n  purpose during the twilight, and since it is set aside during\n  twilight, it is also set aside for the whole of the eighth day; the\n  ethrog, however, which is not suitable during twilight,25 is not set\n  aside for its ritual purpose during twilight, hence it is not set\n  aside for the purpose for the whole of the eighth day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Below Abaye is talking about the Diaspora</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And as for us, who42 keep two days [of the Festival] how are we to\n  proceed?43 — Abaye replied, On the eighth day which may be the\n  seventh,it44 is forbidden;45 on the ninth day which may be the eighth,\n  it is permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By understanding what Abaye is saying, we can make sense of the Tosfos provided by Seth.</p>\n\n<p>The only reason why, in Israel, the Sukkah is forbidden to be used as fuel on the 8th day, is because it is used at twilight which is into the beginning of the 8th day, and gets set aside for the whole of the 8th day. Whereas the Esrog is not being ritually used at the beginning of the 8th day, and therefore is not set aside for the whole of the 8th day.</p>\n\n<p>In the diaspora, the 8th may be the 7th, and so the esrog is ritually used on the 7th and thus set aside for the whole of the 7th. So on the 8th that may be the 7th, you don't want to be eating the esrog.  (One could say, but the Esrog isn't ritually used on the 8th, so why should it be set aside on the 8th. I suppose it's still set aside on the 8th, as one can set it aside without offending/detracting from Shmini Atzeret, and thus one still can't eat it on the 8th - that would offend/detract from the sfak Succot).  </p>\n\n<p>So when Tosfos says \"on account of the succah\" it means sitting in the succah at twilight.</p>\n\n<p>The Tosfos still doesn't entirely make sense, because Abaye explains perfectly well that he decrees that we can eat the esrog on the 8th day in Israel, and we can't eat the esrog on the 8th day in the diaspora, and it's nothing to do with sitting in the succah at twilight.</p>\n\n<p>Abaye only brings up about sitting in the succah at twilight, to show why in Israel on the 8th day it's forbidden to use the succah as fuel, even though it's permitted to eat the esrog. It's strange that Tosfos makes a connection.</p>\n\n<p>The Tosfos is only explaining Abaye's ruling, and somebody commented that the Ritva has a different Girsa that rejected this Tosfos.</p>\n\n<p>One answer suggested that \"on account of sukkah\" meant that if we eat the esrog we may accidentally eat a succah decoration, but that is very speculative, and reading a lot in.</p>\n\n<p>Since this Tosfos is just trying to explain Abaye's position, and Abaye's position is I'd say \"on account of sukkah\" means what Abaye was talking about - sitting in the sukkah at twilight. There are some potentially useful comments on that answer though.</p>\n\n\n",

Not wanting to list three such counts in a row the torah inserts these bracketed verses:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִי בִּנְסֹעַ הָאָרֹן, וַיֹּאמֶר מֹשֶׁה:  קוּמָה ה', וְיָפֻצוּ אֹיְבֶיךָ, וְיָנֻסוּ מְשַׂנְאֶיךָ, מִפָּנֶיךָ.\n  וּבְנֻחֹה, יֹאמַר:  שׁוּבָה ה', רִבְבוֹת אַלְפֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why were these pesukim chosen to be the interrupting verses?

It is stated: “And when the Ark traveled and Moses proclaimed: Rise up, God, and Your enemies will scatter and those who hate You will flee from before You.” And The Holy One, Blessed be He, made signs in the Torah for this portion, above and below, i.e., before and after it, in order to say that this is not its place, as the previous portion does not discuss the nation’s travels. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: It is not for that reason that signs were inserted. Rather, the signs are there because this portion is considered a book unto itself.</p>\n<p>כְּמַאן אָזְלָא הָא דְּאָמַר רַבִּי שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר נַחְמָן אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹנָתָן: ״חָצְבָה עַמּוּדֶיהָ שִׁבְעָה״, אֵלּוּ שִׁבְעָה סִפְרֵי תוֹרָה? — כְּמַאן כְּרַבִּי.</p>\n<p>The Gemara asks: According to whose opinion is that which Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said that Rabbi Yonatan said, that with regard to the verse: “With wisdom she built her house, she carved its seven pillars” (Proverbs 9:1), these are the seven books of the Torah? According to whose opinion? It is according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, as by his count there are seven books of the Torah: Genesis; Exodus; Leviticus; Numbers until: “And when the Ark traveled”; <strong>the portion: “And when the Ark traveled,” which is considered its own book</strong>; the remainder of Numbers; and Deuteronomy.</p>\n<p>מַאן תַּנָּא דִּפְלִיג עֲלֵיהּ דְּרַבִּי — רַבָּן שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן גַּמְלִיאֵל הוּא. דְּתַנְיָא: רַבָּן שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן גַּמְלִיאֵל אוֹמֵר: עֲתִידָה פָּרָשָׁה זוֹ שֶׁתֵּיעָקֵר מִכָּאן וְתִכָּתֵב בִּמְקוֹמָהּ. וְלָמָּה כְּתָבָהּ כָּאן — כְּדֵי לְהַפְסִיק בֵּין פּוּרְעָנוּת רִאשׁוֹנָה לְפוּרְעָנוּת שְׁנִיָּיה. פּוּרְעָנוּת שְׁנִיָּיה מַאי הִיא — ״וַיְהִי הָעָם כְּמִתְאוֹנְנִים״. פּוּרְעָנוּת רִאשׁוֹנָה — ״וַיִּסְעוּ מֵהַר ה׳״, וְאָמַר רַבִּי חָמָא בְּרַבִּי חֲנִינָא: שֶׁסָּרוּ מֵאַחֲרֵי ה׳. וְהֵיכָן מְקוֹמָהּ? אָמַר רַב אָשֵׁי: בַּדְּגָלִים.</p>\n<p>Who is the tanna who disagrees with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi? It is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. As it was taught in a baraita that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: <strong>In the future, this portion will be uprooted from here, where it appears, and will be written in its proper place. And why was it written here, even though it discusses the travels of the children of Israel, and the portion before it does not? It is in order to demarcate between the first punishment and the second punishment.</strong> What is the second punishment that appears immediately afterward? It is the verse: “And the people complained wickedly in God’s ears, and God heard and became angry, and the fire of God burned in them and it consumed the edge of the camp” (Numbers 11:1). What is the first punishment? It is the verse: “And they traveled from the mountain of God [mehar Hashem] for three days” (Numbers 10:33), and Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: That they turned from after God [me’aḥarei Hashem] and hurriedly fled Mount Sinai. The Gemara asks: And if so, where is the proper place for this paragraph? Rav Ashi said: In the portion of the flags, where there is a description of the manner in which the Jewish people traveled through the desert.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, according to Rabbi Yehuda haNasi these two verses were the starting point of the book of the Torah about how Jewish people would travel to Eretz Israel after receiving of the Torah. This indeed happened after the Jewish people departed from mount Sinai. Unfortunately, only two verses got completed due to wicked behavior. Alternatively, according Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, these two verses used to be placed after the parasha of <em>degalim</em> which describes commandments on how to travel. The two verses were moved to separate accounts of wicked behavior as OP noted in the question. R'Sh-b-G says that in the future, they will be returned to their original place.</p>\n<p>Due to opinion of R' Yehuda haNasi, since the verses comprise of 85 letters, we learn several important halakhic implications about any scroll of Tanach that was erased and had 85 letters left on it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One has to rescue it from a fire on Shabbos (Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.115b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 115b</a>)</li>\n<li>Such a scroll conveys <em>tumah</em> to one's hands just as a regular scroll (mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yadayim.3.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yadaim 3:5</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Abaye in the Gemara 149a explains that this is a rabbinic restriction so as not to come to read a <em>Shtar Hedyot</em> on Shabbat. What is a <em>Shtar Hedyot</em> which one may not read on Shabbat? Rashi 116b s.v. Shtar explains it to be financial calculations or letters. Rambam (Peirush Mishnayot Shabbat 23:2) also explains <em>Shtar Hedyot</em> to mean letters and the reason for this is that on Shabbat one may only read Navi and it’s explanations and not even a book of wisdom and science. Bet Yosef 307:17 quotes the Baal HaMoer (43a s.v. VeHa) who agrees.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Rashba (149a s.v. VeLeInyan) explains Shtar Hedyot as a business document. This is also the definition of Ri quoted in Tosfot 116b s.v \"kol sheken\" and Rosh (see there where he writes that reading <em>shtarei hedyotot</em> is a problem of <em>mimtzo cheftzecha</em> from Yishayahu 58:13) Shabbat 23:1. Therefore, Sh”t Rashba 7:288 rules that it’s permitted to read books of wisdom and medicine and quotes Ramban who agreed. [Bet Yosef 307:17 learns this out from another Teshuva of the Rashba 1:772 where he says that one may analyze an astrological tool called the Istrolav.]</p>\n\n<p>Shulcha Aruch 307:17 rules like Rambam who says that on Shabbat one should only learn Torah and not books of other disciplines, however, he mentions that some are lenient. Mishna Brurah 307:65 writes that the minhag is like the Rashba, however, a pious person should be strict. Rav Aviner holds like the Mishna Brurah.</p>\n\n<p>However, Yalkut Yosef (Shabbat vol 2, pg 214, 626) rules like Shulchan Aruch that one should only learn Torah on Shabbat and is only lenient to allow a medical student who has a test after Shabbat and is pressured for time to study medicine (except for the study of surgery) on Shabbat. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Once again, see Rabbi Torczyner's <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/765631/Rabbi_Mordechai_Torczyner/Medical_Halachah-_Attending_Medical_Conferences_on_Shabbos\" rel=\"nofollow\">lecture on attending conferences</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While debated by medieval rabbis, it appears that we conclude it is permissible to study science or medicine on Shabbat. (Assuming it's being done for the right reasons, assuming you're not writing, that it's not \"business talk\", and the like.) There had been a discussion whether an astrolabe (a tool of astronomy from centuries past) could be used on Shabbat, and contemporary authority Rabbi JD Bleich discusses a microscope (again, assuming you're not turning on the light or the like); we tend to rule that this is all permitted.</p>\n\n<p>CAVEAT: Shabbat has two components, the \"don't-do\" and the \"yes do.\" Don't do creative processes like planting, plowing, burning and the like. Easy enough.</p>\n\n<p>But there's also the \"yes-do\" of \"keep the day sacred.\" Otherwise, I could come up with 101 loopholes that aren't technically creative processes, but would wind up spending my Shabbat as pretty much just another workday.  <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1058.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Isaiah 54:18</a> talks about keeping Shabbat as a \"delight\", not trying to do your business or even talk about it.</p>\n\n<p>That's a lot more of the question: is it appropriate and within the spirit to study science? Many believe that as that assists your religious growth, yes. (If you're cramming for an exam the next day, that's a different matter.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As it says clearly in the Shulchan Aruch (in simon shin-zain, i.e. 307),  there are two issues:</p>\n\n<p>(a) reading, even looking at, mundane writings, etc. in Shabbos - a Rabbinic prohibition based on the concern that you might correct them, and,</p>\n\n<p>(b) a prohibition on learning secular subjects in general - which where/if prohibited, is prohibited during the week as well.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, there is a third issue:</p>\n\n<p>(c) muktza  -  the writings, books, documents etc., forbidden in this way, become muktza in Shabbos</p>\n\n<p>And as is often the case, there is a debated exception:</p>\n\n<p>(d) Books of wisdon, knowledge, medicine -  Yesh Omrim, <strong>Some</strong> say you can read them in Shabbos, which implies that you can read them during the week.</p>\n\n<p>These are the essential concepts.

A פרסה is four מיל, so 43,000 פרסה come to about 183,500,000 meters.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, though, the distance is about 384,400,000 meters (as had been known, at least approximately, <a href=\"http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/lectures/gkastr1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">for millenia</a> by his day), which according to the <em>Aruch Hashulchan</em> is 384,400,000÷4267.2 פרסה, or about 90,000 פרסה.</p>\n\n<p>His estimate of 43,000 is off by a scale factor of 2!

The <em>sazhen</em> was fixed at 7 English feet (2.134m) in both systems way back during the 1700s in Peter the Great's rule.</p>\n\n<p>In 397:1, the Aruch HaShulchan says that specifically, he is talking about the Russian <em>verst</em> (and therefore, in order to eliminate confusion and to inform <em>heimisch</em> readers how long the official <em>verst</em> is), he says 500 <em>sazheni</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This perspective makes the end of 397:1 much clearer and less redundant:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואלפים אמה הוא מיל, ולפי <strong>מדת מדינתינו רוסיא</strong> היא <strong>פרסה רוסית</strong> שקורין ווייארסט, <strong>שהם חמשה מאות סאזנעס</strong>. <strong>וכל סאזען</strong> הוא ד' אמות שבגמרא, כמו שבארנו בחושן משפט סימן רי\"ח.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And two thousand <em>amot</em> is a <em>mil</em>, and according to the <strong>laws of our country, Russia</strong>, that is a \"<strong>Russian <em>parasa</em></strong>\" which is called \"<em>verst</em>\", which are 500 <em>sazheni</em>.  And <strong>all <em>sazheni</em></strong> [i.e., Russian, Moscovy, <em>Litovskaia</em>] are 4 <em>amot</em> in the <em>gemara</em>, as we explained in Choshen Mishpat, siman 218.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When he talks about the distance to the moon, he says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מ\"ג אלף פרסה</p>\n  \n  <p>43,000 <em>parasa</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We have an ambiguity there.  He might be talking about the Russian \"<em>parasa</em>\" (2000 <em>amot</em>), the Moscovy \"<em>parasa</em>\" (4000 <em>amot</em>), or the Talmudic <em>parasa</em> (8000 <em>amot</em>).  But all of these definitions are off.

I seek support for there being, or not being, any requirement that a man, in order to pray <em>sh'mone esre</em>, attend a <em>minyan</em> he knows meets regularly.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>'s language, in introducing the idea of prayer with a <em>minyan</em> (<em>OC</em> 90:9), says only \"Someone should try much to pray in the synagogue with the community\".

And the proof of this is from that which is in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=7b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 7[b]</a>: <em>R. Isaac said to R. Nahman: Why does the Master not come to the Synagogue in order to pray?  — He said to him: I cannot.  He asked him: Let the Master gather ten people and pray with them [in his house]? — He answered: It is too much of a trouble for me.</em> [<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_7.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>] And if we say that it is an obligatory <em>mitzvah</em> like all obligatory <em>mitzvot</em>, what claim is this \"it is too much of a trouble for me\"? A man is obligated to expend effort in <em>mitzvot</em> even if the thing is difficult for him! (And perhaps it was on account of disrupting Torah study.) It is thus clear from this that prayer with the congregation in and of itself is not a <em>mitzvah</em> and therefore there is no obligation to pray with the congregation. Rather, since an individual's prayer is not always accepted, unless it's with the congregation, a man therefore has to pray with the congregation so that his prayer will be accepted. And this is the entire matter of prayer with the congregation.</p>\n  \n  <p>And this is also clear from the language of Rambam in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=617\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the beginning of Chapter Eight of Prayer</a>, and this is his wording: <em>Communal prayer is always heard. Even when there are transgressors among [the congregation], the Holy One, blessed be He, does not reject the prayers of the many. Therefore, a person should include himself in the community and should not pray alone whenever he is able to pray with the community.</em> <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/920171/jewish/Tefilah-and-Birkat-Kohanim-Chapter-Eight.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">[Touger translation]</a> Thus ends his words. And this wording  \"should not pray alone whenever he is able to pray with the community\" explicitly shows that it is not an obligation at all, but an effort that his prayer should be accepted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Eliyahu_Henkin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Eliyahu Henkin</a> writes (Shu\"t Gevurot Eliyahu 1:24) that the real obligation is for the congregation to provide daily prayer services, but there is not really a formal obligation for any particular individual to attend if the services can exist without him:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמנם כל יחיד בפני עצמו אף שיש עליו מצוה שישתתף גם הוא עם הצבור עיקר חיובו הוא כשהוא בבית הכנסת שאז אסור לו לפרוש מן הצבור ועל כן \n  נפסק בשו\"ע (סי' צ סעי' י) שכשמוכרח ראוי לו לצאת מבית הכנסת להתפלל יחידי ולא בבית הכנסת קודם לצבור וכן אסרו חז\"ל (ברכות ו:) להתפלל אחורי בית הכנסת משום כדו בר קיימת קמי מארך וגם לא לעבור אחורי בית הכנסת בשעה שהצבור מתפללין (ברכות ח:) אבל כשהוא בתוך ביתו וטריחא לי' מילתא' אין עליו גדר חיוב (ברכות ז:) אף שראוי לו להשתדל בדבר כלשון השו\"ע (סי' צ סעי' ט) וחז\"ל זרזו וחזרו וזרזו (ברכות ו.) שאין תפילתו נשמעת אלא בבית הכנסת ואף ביחידות יותר טוב להתפלל\n   בבית הכנסת [אחר הצבור ולא קודם לו] ונקרא שכן רע כשאינו בא\n   לבית הכנסת (שם ח.) [אולי זהו כשאינו נכנס בשום פעם או אפילו בלא \n  סבה המעכבת] אבל אינו בגדר חיוב גמור ונדחה מפני איזו מצוה או טרדה אפילו פרנסה </p>\n  \n  <p>However, even though each individual on his own has a <em>mitzvah</em> to join the congregation, his primary obligation is when he is in the synagogue for then he is forbidden to separate from the congregation. And it is therefore ruled in Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x459\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">90:10</a>) that when when one is forced he should leave the synagogue to pray alone, and not in the synagogue prior to the congregation. And so the Sages forbade (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=6b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 6b</a>) to pray behind the synagogue because of \"you stand before your master as if there are two powers\", and to pass behind the synagogue when the congregation is praying. But when he is in his house and the matter is burdensome to him, he is not within the realm of obligation (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=7b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 7b</a>) even though it is proper to try in the matter, in accordance with the wording of the Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x458\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">90:9</a>). And the Sages repeatedly admonished him (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=6b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 6b</a>) that his prayer is not heard except in the synagogue, and even alone it is better to pray in the synagogue (after the congregation but not before it), and he is called a bad neighbor when he does not come to the synagogue (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=8&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid 8a</a>) (perhaps this is is when he does not come to the synagogue ever, or [when he does not come] even with no preventing reason).

Esau was not dying, for right after eating he up and walked away, he didn't care so much what would happen to his descendents as he said, \"Behold, I am going to die, so why do I need this birthright?\"</p>\n\n<p>Jacob did not even want to deceive his father even if it was necessary for him to get the blessing he deserved, he only did so because of Rebecca.</p>\n\n<p>Esau on the other hand was willing to kill Jacob over the blessing. Jacob showed by his actions in the following chapters that he was righteous. God had the entire Jewish nation come from him. So he was not a villain. </p>\n\n\n",

And there was the \"shiur iyun\" on the sugyos of the Talmud. The purpose of the shiur iyun was to delved into a sugya, touching all the places where it was discussed in the Talmud and the poskim, to iron out difficulties in the words of the Rishonim and Achronim, and to establish the halachic conlusion. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I dont know if you really mean Satmar or chasidim. Satmar are not really chasidim since they were in Hungary/Rumania and followed the Hungarian chasam sofer derech. \nThe derech of the first Satmar rebbe (and Hungarian yeshivot) was to learn what they termed 'sugya' shiur. That means about 3 topics what they considered in depth a term. They used to print out all the gemoros and meforshim pertaining to them. After they had learnt them the rebbe or RY used to give a shiur on them with his own chiddushim which have since been printed. As you know gemoro is rarely on one 'place' so they had to learn it from all over. Apart from this the Satmar rebbe when he was still in Rumania used to give a 'deep' daily morning shiur which was on the blatt and in the afternoon a quicker one. This was the method in all Hungarian yeshivot. Apart from this they learnt Shulchan Oruch with Magen Avrohom and others Yore Daio. There was a strict exam weekly which was also on the chumash rashi conducted by the rebbe in person. In Hungarian yeshivot they did not have 'classes'. There was mainly only one shiur given by the RY and the older boys used to have to learn with the younger ones (for payment). </p>\n\n<p>This system has almost died out today. Although it is still kept in a minimum kind of way in Satmar. When the rebbe opened his yeshivo in America he still carried on given his 'sugya' shiur which as I say has since been printed but had hardly any listeners to it from his yeshivo since they couldnt keep up with it. But he did keep giving his strict exam weekly. He had a great sense of humor and when a boy said something wrong he usually made a joke out of it. One of his well known quips was that he had boy there whose name was moshe and his fathers name was Sinai. The boy made a mistake. So the rebbe replied, 'is that what moshe was 'mekabel' received from sinai. </p>\n\n\n",

He came to believe that the entire universe was the work of a\n  single Creator, and he began to teach this belief to others.</p>\n  \n  <p>Abram tried to convince his father, Terach, of the folly of idol\n  worship. One day, when Abram was left alone to mind the store, he took\n  a hammer and smashed all of the idols except the largest one. He\n  placed the hammer in the hand of the largest idol. When his father\n  returned and asked what happened, Abram said, \"The idols got into a\n  fight, and the big one smashed all the other ones.\" His father said,\n  \"Don't be ridiculous. These idols have no life or power. They can't do\n  anything.\" Abram replied, \"Then why do you worship them?\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Eventually, the one true Creator that Abram had worshipped called to\n  him, and made him an offer: if Abram would leave his home and his\n  family, then G-d would make him a great nation and bless him.

wise\n  men of that generation gave thoughtless counsel. Enosh himself was one\n  of those who erred.</p>\n  \n  <p>Their mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres\n  with which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated\n  them with honor, making them servants who minister before Him.\n  Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat\n  them with honor. [They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed\n  be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and\n  honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him\n  be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king.</p>\n  \n  <p>After conceiving of this notion, they began to construct temples to\n  the stars and offer sacrifices to them. They would praise and glorify\n  them with words, and prostrate themselves before them, because by\n  doing so, they would - according to their false conception - be\n  fulfilling the will of God.</p>\n  \n  <p>This was the essence of the worship of false gods, and this was the\n  rationale of those who worshiped them. They would not say that there\n  is no other god except for this star.</p>\n  \n  <p>This message was conveyed by Jeremiah, who declared (10:7-8): \"Who\n  will not fear You, King of the nations, for to You it is fitting.\n  Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there\n  is none like You. They have one foolish and senseless [notion. They\n  conceive of their] empty teachings as wood;\" i.e., all know that You\n  alone are God. Their foolish error consists of conceiving of this\n  emptiness as Your will.</p>\n  \n  <p>After many years passed, there arose people - false prophets - who\n  told [their nations] that God had commanded them to say: Serve this\n  star - or all the stars - sacrifice to it, offer libations to it,\n  build a temple for it and make an image of it so that all people -\n  including the women, the children, and the common people - could bow\n  to it.</p>\n  \n  <p>He would inform them of a form that he had conceived, and tell them\n  that this is the image of the particular star, claiming that this was\n  revealed to him in a prophetic vision. In this manner, the people\n  began to make images in temples, under trees, and on the tops of\n  mountains and hills.</p>\n  \n  <p>People would gather together and bow down to them and the [false\n  prophets] would say: This image is the source of benefit or harm. It\n  is appropriate to serve it and fear it. Their priests would tell them:\n  This service will enable you to multiply and be successful. Do this\n  and this, or do not do this or this.</p>\n  \n  <p>Subsequently, other deceivers arose and declared that a specific star,\n  sphere, or angel had spoken to them and commanded them: Serve me in\n  this manner. He would then relate a mode of service [telling them:] Do\n  this, do not do this.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, these practices spread throughout the world. People would serve\n  images with strange practices - one more distorted than the other -\n  offer sacrifices to them, and bow down to them. As the years passed,\n  [God's] glorious and awesome name was forgotten by the entire\n  population. [It was no longer part of] their speech or thought, and\n  they no longer knew Him. Thus, all the common people, the women, and\n  the children would know only the image of wood or stone and the\n  temples of stone to which they were trained from their childhood to\n  bow down and serve, and in whose name they swore.</p>\n  \n  <p>The wise men among them would think that there is no God other than\n  the stars and spheres for whose sake, and in resemblance of which,\n  they had made these images. The Eternal Rock was not recognized or\n  known by anyone in the world, with the exception of a [few]\n  individuals: for example, Chanoch, Metushelach, Noach, Shem, and Ever.\n  The world continued in this fashion until the pillar of the world -\n  the Patriarch Abraham - was born.</p>\n  \n  <p>After this mighty man was weaned, he began to explore and think.\n  Though he was a child, he began to think [incessantly] throughout the\n  day and night, wondering: How is it possible for the sphere to\n  continue to revolve without having anyone controlling it? Who is\n  causing it to revolve? Surely, it does not cause itself to revolve.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>He had no teacher, nor was there anyone to inform him. Rather, he was\n  mired in Ur Kasdim among the foolish idolaters. His father, mother,\n  and all the people [around him] were idol worshipers, and he would\n  worship with them. [However,] his heart was exploring and [gaining]\n  understanding.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Ultimately, he appreciated the way of truth and understood the path of\n  righteousness through his accurate comprehension. He realized that\n  there was one God who controlled the sphere, that He created\n  everything, and that there is no other God among all the other\n  entities. He knew that the entire world was making a mistake. What\n  caused them to err was their service of the stars and images, which\n  made them lose awareness of the truth.</p>\n  \n  <p>Abraham was forty years old when he became aware of his Creator. When\n  he recognized and knew Him, he began to formulate replies to the\n  inhabitants of Ur Kasdim and debate with them, telling them that they\n  were not following a proper path.</p>\n  \n  <p>He broke their idols and began to teach the people that it is fitting\n  to serve only the God of the world. To Him [alone] is it fitting to\n  bow down, sacrifice, and offer libations, so that the people of future\n  [generations] would recognize Him. [Conversely,] it is fitting to\n  destroy and break all the images, lest all the people err concerning\n  them, like those people who thought that there are no other gods\n  besides these [images].</p>\n  \n  <p>When he overcame them through the strength of his arguments, the king\n  desired to kill him. He was [saved through] a miracle and left for\n  Charan. [There,] he began to call in a loud voice to all people and\n  inform them that there is one God in the entire world and it is proper\n  to serve Him. He would go out and call to the people, gathering them\n  in city after city and country after country, until he came to the\n  land of Canaan - proclaiming [God's existence the entire time] - as\n  [Genesis 21:33] states: \"And He called there in the name of the Lord,\n  the eternal God.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>When the people would gather around him and ask him about his\n  statements, he would explain [them] to each one of them according to\n  their understanding, until they turned to the path of truth.\n  Ultimately, thousands and myriads gathered around him. These are the\n  men of the house of Abraham.</p>\n  \n  <p>He planted in their hearts this great fundamental principle, composed\n  texts about it, and taught it to Isaac, his son. Isaac also taught\n  others and turned [their hearts to God].

    "content": "# Can a gentile light a Shabbat candle and do the prayers?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am a gentile, however I am seriously considering to convert.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to do some of the Shabbat traditions just to get a feel of the celebration (can you call it that?) like light the candle and say the prayer afterwards. I don't know yet whether I am \"religious enough\" to convert and am hoping for some guidance in the prayer.</p>\n\n<p>Is it okay for me to do that even if I don't yet fully understand all aspects of it?\nThanks in advance.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Regarding your sidebar about conversion: Decisions about conversion need to be made with the guidance of a competent rabbi who knows you. If you are serious about converting, and you don't already know a rabbi, I implore you to get in touch with a rabbi in your area, or as close to your area as possible. Relationships build over time, but first contact must be made.</p>\n\n<p>As for the question itself, there are a couple of things to consider.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbath</a> (as I spell it on this site), or Shabbos or Shabbat, as most people pronounce it, is a special day set aside by G-d for the Children of Israel (aka today as the Jews) to connect spiritually to Him and to one another.  Once a week we declare our belief that G-d created the world and remember that He took us out of slavery in Egypt. In fact, during this declaration, some have a custom to stand as witnesses stand (in Jewish law) when testifying (as explained in paragraph E<sub>3</sub><sup>a</sup> <a href=\"http://www.star-k.com/kashrus/kk-kiddish.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat_candles\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lighting candles</a> is an important ritual done before the start of Shabbath. One of its <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10964/5\">primary purposes</a> is to create peace in the home. It is true, in many ways, that candlelight emits what many consider a peaceful glow. In addition to that, in the days before electricity, especially in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian_society\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">agrarian societies</a>, one does one's work until shortly before sunset, at which point the only light one has is from a lamp of some sort, so one eats supper and turns in for the night. However, if one is deliberately staying up past nightfall for a festive meal and songs, having candlelight is essential, for preventing injury if nothing else. On top of all of the practical reasons, it is also said that the light of the candles elevates the spiritual level of the home and brings in a spiritual peacefulness.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Taking into account the above, the blessing on the candles, which is \"Blessed are You...who has commanded us regarding the lighting of the candles for Shabbath\" seems to be out of place for someone who is not Jewish and therefore not obligated in observing Shabbath. </p>\n\n<p>However, I'm not a rabbi, nor am I an expert in this area. I can see a reason for a prospective convert to light candles without the blessing, in order to get a flavor of Shabbath (and get used to performing the ritual).</p>\n\n<p>It was pointed out to me by Isaac Moses in the comments below that there is a chance you are asking about the common practice of reciting a personal prayer and a general prayer for health and wellbeing for one's household. I have to repeat my refrain that I am not a rabbi, nor am I an expert in this area. But I don't see anything wrong with thanking G-d for one's blessings or asking for the general welfare of one's family at any time, provided that you do not use the formula \"in the merit of our matriarchs Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah,\" or inclusionary language such as \"for us and all of Israel\", for the simple reason that you are, at this point, not a member of the Jewish People and the Jewish matriarchs are not your matriarchs, though they may serve as wonderful role models of piety for you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You should have a very serious conversation with a rabbi about this subject and about your thoughts on conversion and whether it may or may not be for you.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>For practical advice you need to consult a rabbi, but here is some general information.</p>\n<p>Certain prayers/blessings, including the one said after lighting Shabbat candles, contain the phrase \"who has commanded us\".  Gentiles haven't been commanded, so (a) saying it isn't accurate for you, and (b) you might be taking God's name in vain by saying it.  (What exactly the Noachide prohibition on this is a separate question, but I mention this because at least some gentile religions also have this prohibition.  If you are a member of such a religion and aren't yet sure you're leaving, you might care about that regardless of what Judaism has to say about it.)</p>\n<p>But you aren't looking to practice exactly as an observant Jew does; you're exploring.  There's nothing wrong with lighting candles and having a nice family dinner on Friday night, and if you want to use this time to focus more on your relationship with God, that's great!  Instead of saying the standard candle blessing, you could say something like \"thank you God for this special time\", or even thank God for specific things that have gone well in the past week or that you're anticipating in the coming days.  (Try not to make specific, mundane <em>requests</em>; Shabbat is about stepping out of ordinary time, and anyway, shouldn't God get to rest on Shabbat too?)</p>\n<p>There is a special prayer said by some women after lighting candles that you could adapt.  (You probably don't want to use it exactly as-is.)  The text, from <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/sh/ht/fn/48965051.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aish HaTorah</a> (h/t Isaac Moses):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>May it be Your will, Lord my God and God of my fathers, to be gracious to me (and to my spouse, children, parents) and to all my family; grant us and all Israel good and long life; remember us for good and blessing; consider us for salvation and compassion; bless us with great blessings; make our household complete, crowning our home with the feeling of Your Divine Presence dwelling among us.</p>\n<p>Make me worthy to raise learned children and grandchildren, who are wise and understanding, who love and fear God, people of truth, holy and attached to God, who will dazzle the world with Torah and goodness and service of God. Please hear our prayers, in the merit of our matriarchs Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel and Leah, and ensure that the glow of our lives will never be dimmed. Show us the glow of Your face and we will be saved. Amen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be clear: you aren't \"doing Shabbat\" by doing this, because Shabbat is a gift for the Jews, but you <em>are</em> setting aside some \"God time\" from the rest of your week, which is an important part of Shabbat.  You probably don't want to call it \"Shabbat\" or \"sabbath\", though; it'll just confuse people.</p>\n<p>If you do decide to explore conversion -- and not everybody who starts the process ends up converting; it really is exploration at that point and not commitment -- then the rabbi you work with will guide you in taking on practices.  Most likely he <em>will</em> have you start saying the \"who has commanded us\" blessings before you are officially a Jew.  But that's for your rabbi to decide; every case is different.</p>\n\n\n",

On the one hand it left the reshut of the owner, on the other hand it was further damaged similar to the case of a gazlan who steals from a gazlan and is liable himself for the additional damage.</p>\n\n<p>Answer:</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 354:3) rules: “One who stole an animal or a vessel, or similar items…[if] it was worth two at the moment of theft, but worth four at the moment of [the thief’s] being put on trial – whether he slaughtered, sold, broke the vessel, or lost it – he would pay as if it was at the moment of being put on trial. If the animal died or the vessel was lost from him, he would pay its value at the moment of theft.”\nSimilarly, the Shulchan Aruch rules (Ibid., 362: 10): “One who stole a barrel of wine from his colleague and it was worth a dinar at the moment of theft, but it went up in price while he possessed it and valued at four, and he broke the barrel or drank from it, or sold it, or gave it as a present after it went up in value, he would pay four like at the moment of ‘departure from the world’; whereas had he left it, it [the value] would return by itself. If it was broken by itself or got lost, one would pay a dinar, like the time of theft.”\nThe source of this ruling is in the Talmud, Tractate Baba Kama 65a: “One who stole a barrel of wine from his colleague: if it was originally worth a zuz, and later worth four zuz, if he broke it or drank from it, he would pay four; [however,] if it [the barrel] became broken by its own accord, he would [only] pay a zuz.”\nThe Rishonim debate – along with the Acharonim in their wake – the reason for the difference whether one had broken the item or if it became broken on its own accord.\nThe Nemukei Yosef (Baba Metziah 25a, in the pages of the Rif) and the Ketzot HaChoshen (34: 3) reason that after stealing an object, one is obligated only the value at the time of theft. Therefore, one cannot obligate him in the price rise that had occurred while the item was in his possession. However, if he broke the item, he would be considered a damager (mazik). Therefore, he would be obligated to pay its value at the time of damaging the item.\nOn the other hand, the Ritvah (Baba Metziah 43a, “amar Raba”) and the Netivot HaMishpat (34: 5) argue that any change that a thief makes to the item is considered further theft. Therefore, although he was previously considered a thief, at the moment that he broke the item, he would once again be considered the one who stole the item. Subsequently, he would be obligated at the moment of his breaking the item, as opposed to its becoming broken by itself – in which case, he would be obligated according to its original value.\nThe distinction between the Ketzot and the Netivot is that according to the Ketzot the additional chiyuv to pay is a chiyuv of mazik (damager), while according to the netivot the chiyuv is one of a gazlan. There are possible ramifications to this distinction and later Achronim discussed this issue at length. See also the wording of the gemara in Baba Metziah (43a) which appears more like the Netivot, and this appears to be the majority opinion. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9733&st=&pgnum=364\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat siman 360:1</a> says one has to return the actual item if he cant return the actual item(he changed it) then he pays the value of the item when it was stolen(<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9733&st=&pgnum=365\" rel=\"nofollow\">see halacha 5</a>)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Genesis 2:4 say there was only one day of creation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Right after it says all the different parts of the world and sky being created on six separate days and rest on the seventh, it says, \"These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, on the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven.\" And it goes on to say that there was nothing on the ground, then God formed water, then Man, then Eden, then plants, then animals, seemingly in that order all on one day. So I'm not sure I understand, in which order did these things actually form and on what day(s)? The best I can think of is that the potential for everything was made on the first week and then on the eighth day that's when they were actually made (and in a different order) but that doesn't feel right.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rashi comments on the spot that the \"one day\" refers to the first day. This might refer to something very basic, such as all matter.</p>\n\n<p>Later on commentaries say that the potential was created during 6 days as we read in first chapter, then it was realized with help of man's prayer in the order we read in the second chapter - but only after man arrived.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Genesis 2:4 does not say that there was only one day of creation. It says that once the world was created in the six days (as had already been described), here are the details of the creation of Adam and what happened on that last day.</p>\n\n<p>This is a question of the <em>difference</em> between Genesis 1 and Genesis 2.\nActually, they do not report it \"differently\" in the sense of there being two different stories that contradict each other. As explained by Rabbi Shimshon Rafael Hirsch, or Rabbi Aryeh Levin and others, Genesis one is the description of the creation from the beginning to the end. Genesis 2 starts (paraphrase), When G0d created the universe (as described before), everything was set up. Here are the details of the creation of Adam and what happened immediately after.</p>\n\n<p>It is the same story, but the concentration is on a different set of details. It is like saying \"During the sixth day, Adam was created in this specific manner. The following events involving Adam then occurred.\".</p>\n\n<p>Note that the start of the \"second story\" is Bereishis 2:4. The Xian division into \"chapters\" is mistaken. <strong>As Rabbi Shimshon Rafael Hirsch points out, \"Aileh\" means \"These\" which points back to what is already said and means expanding on what was said, here are the \"products\" of what was created (as we described earlier).</strong> Now once the world had been created, the important part of the Universe and the part that we need to concentrate on is Adam ...</p>\n\n<p>Later we see that the Torah shows what happened to the world until we get to Noah and the flood. We then follow the descendants of Noah until we get to Avraham. We do not give details of the rest of the world, because that is not what the Torah wants to tell us. A book of American history will not say what is going on in China except as it pertains to the particular part of the history that a specific chapter is dealing with. We do not say that the chapter is pretending that China does not exist.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The beginning of Bereishis is connected to what Chazal called M'aseh Bereishis, which are secret esoteric teachings about the nature of the world. Thus the literal meaning of these pesukim is not the primary one, so apparent contradictions on the literal level are not such a problem. The deeper meaning of each part can be referring to two different things, or to a truth which may only come through by comparing the two parts. </p>\n\n<p>Even on the literal level, the apparent contradictions can be explained. The Torah starts off: \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth\" which sounds like they were created on the first day. It then describes further details and developments over the following days. In the second chapter, it mentions how heaven and earth were created in a day, and then it immediately jumps to man, the focus of this part. So there isn't really a contradiction on number of days.<br>\nWith regards to the plant vs. man order, the Garden described in Ch.2 (v.8 and 9) is a specific Garden that was created for man which sounds different than the creation of The Plants on the third day. One can also say the lack of plants mentioned in v.5 is within this garden.    </p>\n\n<p>Many interpretations have been offered to the meaning of these two stories about the creation of man. For example, Rav J.B. Soloveitchik wrote <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lonely_Man_of_Faith\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Lonely Man of Faith</a> as an explanation of these two passages. He says the first passage refers to \"majestic man\" where man is master of nature, while the second passage refers to man in a different role, as \"covenantal man\" who submits to God's will.  </p>\n\n<p>While R.J.B. Soloveitchik is not trying to explain historical events, one can give such an answer also. The first story of creation can be referring to the ancestor of mankind, while the second story can be a later event referring to the ancestor of a specific group of people. An approach like this could also be used to explain why humans have been around for more than 6000 years, as asked in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28441/how-are-pre-creation-4000-bce-human-civilization-and-pre-flood-2300-bce-civili\">this question</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Still the get is kosher.</p>\n\n<p>However I don't understand how this works.</p>\n\n<p>What about if there is another person named \"Yaakov\" in the city that has boys, how do we know that this \"ben Yaakov\" is really the one that signed? And if you'll say there is only one \"Yaakov\" in the whole city, what about if Moshe ben Yaakov has other brothers (Yitzchak ben Yaakov, Yehoshua ben Yaakov, etc, etc.) How do we know who the person that signed is since they are really all technically \"ben Yaakov\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Based on Rabbi J. David Bleich's class <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/776187/Rabbi_Dr_J_David_Bleich/Ishus_1_%285772%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>: If there is known to be more than one \"Yosi ben Shimon\" (Talmud's example) in a given community, they must resort to either an additional generation \"Yosi ben Shimon ben Moshe\" or another descriptor \"Yosi ben Shimon HaRofe\". (My own addition: In the current age, listing a family name would seem to be another good way to disambiguate).  R' Bleich believes a single synagogue nowadays constitutes a community, presumably in spite of the fact that there may be a single shul for many municipalities or many shuls in a single municipality.  He feels it is rare that there be a <strong>chazaka</strong> of two people with the same name in a given synagogue, because rarely do people know that someone else in their shul has the exact same Hebrew name.  If someone knows this to be the case, he should inform the mesader kiddushin.  Here ends my summary of R' Bleich.</p>\n\n<p>If the signer knows his patronym alone won't suffice, he should of course not sign with it.  Though it seems the Mishna is not describing ideal conditions, but whether or not a <em>get</em> is kosher if in fact sub-optimal things were done.  </p>\n\n<p>I'd note the original question of how this can work applies just as well to other statements in that Mishna, where only the first name of the witness is signed, or simply \"Sofer and Witness\".  </p>\n\n\n",

Consider the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_and_the_Idol_Shop\" rel=\"nofollow\">midrash</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Terah was an idol manufacturer who once went away and left Abraham in charge of the store. A man walked in and wished to buy an idol. Abraham asked him how old he was and the man responded “fifty years old.” Abraham then said, “You are fifty years old and would worship a day old statue!” At this point the man left ashamed.</p>\n  \n  <p>Later, a woman walked in to the store and wanted to make an offering to the idols. So Abraham took a stick, smashed the idols and placed the stick in the hand of the largest idol. When Terah returned he asked Abraham what happened to all the idols. Abraham told him that a woman came in to make an offering to the idols. Then the idols argued about which one should eat the offering first. Then the largest idol took the stick and smashed the other idols.</p>\n  \n  <p>Terah responded by saying that they are only statues and have no knowledge. Whereupon Abraham responded by saying that you deny their knowledge, yet you worship them! At which point Terah took Abraham to Nimrod.</p>\n  \n  <p>Nimrod proclaims to Abraham that we should worship fire. Abraham responds that water puts out fire. So Nimrod declares they worship water. Abraham responds that clouds hold water. </p>\n  \n  <p>So Nimrod declares they worship clouds. Abraham responds that wind pushes clouds. So Nimrod declares they worship wind. Abraham responds that people withstand wind.\n  Nimrod becomes angry with Abraham and declares that Abraham shall be cast into the fire, and Abraham is correct that there is a real God, that God will save him. Then Abraham is cast into the fire and is saved by God.</p>\n  \n  <p>Abraham’s brother Haran sees what happened and says that he believes in the God of Abraham, is thrown into the fire, and is not saved by God. Hence the verse in Genesis 11:28 “And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If one is sensitive to nuances in the text, then I think it becomes obvious that the genre is not (necessarily) history but polemics. Avraham, as the first official monotheist, gets to put forth all sorts of arguments against idolatry (which in this case is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetishism\" rel=\"nofollow\">fetishism</a>, that the idol itself has power, rather than the belief that the idol is a representative of the power on high).</p>\n\n<p>Avraham in this story is not sneaky at all. He knows full well what Terach will respond, that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>they are only statues and have no knowledge</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Neither Avraham nor Terach are idiots. Avraham was not trying to destroy the idols while offering a fake excuse. Avraham was trying to prompt this very response from Terach, so that he could say the punch line of the polemic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>you deny their knowledge, yet you worship them! </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This then matches the earlier polemic in the midrash, that the man is older than the idol, yet he would worship it.</p>\n\n<p>It would have been \"sneaky\" had Avraham thought that he would get away with the deed with this excuse. But that would be a misreading of the midrash.</p>\n\n\n",

He must 5) pay her medical bills if she\n  falls ill; and 6) ransom her if she is taken hostage. If the wife\n  passes away before the husband, he must 7) pay her burial expenses,\n  and 8) after he dies, her children inherit their mother's ketubah\n  money before the rest of the estate is divided amongst all the heirs.\n  In the event that the husband dies before the wife, 9) she is entitled\n  to live in his home and live off his estate until she dies or\n  remarries, and 10) her daughters, too, are supported by his estate\n  until they marry.</p>\n  \n  <p>Today, the standard ketubah is a printed form which has blanks for the\n  date and the names of the bride, groom, and witnesses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketubah#References\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia article</a> references a “text of a prenuptial agreement” = ketubah at <a href=\"http://www.rabbis.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.rabbis.org/</a> endorsed by the Rabbinical Council of America.

Therefore, a person collecting charity requires special skills, he needs to be honest and resilient in doing the job. A charity collector may deal sometimes with embarassment  or insults when approaching people.

One maynot accept tzedakah from one who is only giving because he is embarassed not to give, since such an action is considered stealing. One may not even approach someone who normally gives more than he is able to afford, and ask him for tzedakah. Furthermore a charity collector may not embarass one into giving tzedakah. ... A charity collector may not mislead or trick people into giving tzedakah. Therefore one may not tell an individual that he is collecting for a cause that he knows the person would be more willing to support when, in fact, he really is collecting for a different cause. Similarly, a charity collector may not tell an individual that he personally is giving a significant anmount to tedakah in order to get the individual to give., when in truth he is not giving that amount.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He also interestingly mentions paintings/images of \"the Madonna\" are not generally to be considered idols.</p>\n\n<p>The source is Ben Ish Chai Year II, Masei #2, which is based on the Chochmat Adam: בזה\"ז כל הצורות הנמצאים בין בכפרים בין בכרכים אם ניכר הדבר שנעשו לשם ע\"ז אסורים, וכן צורת שתי וערב שמעמידין בבית כנסיה שלהם בפניה דינו כע\"ז ממש, שהרי מכבדין אותם, וכן כל שתי וערב שמניחין בכל מקום אם מכבדין אותם שלוקחין הכובע ומשתחוים להם, דינם כע\"ז ממש, אבל צורת שו\"ע שתולין על הצואר וכיוצא אלו נעשין לזכרון ולא נקראו צלם ואין להם דין ע\"ז, ועיין חכ\"א כלל פ\"ז סעיף א' יע\"ש:</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Judaism has some very specific rules regarding <em>idols</em>, and Jews have been around Christians for a very long time; thus this question has come up before.</p>\n\n<p>Theologically speaking, we say that treating a human being as a deity is considered \"idol worship\", and it's generally assumed that medieval rabbis differed whether a non-Jew who worships both a non-corporeal, omniscient God along with a human being is considered doing \"idol worship.\"</p>\n\n<p>As for the physical cross itself, thank you DoubleAA for pointing to Shulchan Aruch YD141:6, in which Rama rules that a cross to which people bow should be handled like an idol (and therefore, for instance, you couldn't buy it and then use it for anything), whereas one worn is merely a symbol.</p>\n\n<p>My sense is that a plain cross up in a Protestant church is probably not treated as an <em>idol</em>. Jews are prohibited from deriving any benefit from an <em>idol</em>, to the point that a building constructed for the sake of housing/sheltering an idol would be prohibited for Jews to ever use for any other purpose -- therefore (let's assume for the sake of this conversation that Hinduism is \"idol worship\") if a building was built as a Hindu temple and several years later they put the building up for sale, a Jew would be prohibited from buying/using it for any purpose. However, a responsum from almost a hundred years ago allowed Jews to buy an old Welsh-Scottish Methodist church and convert it into a synagogue (or house or school or shop or whatever, by the same logic) because there were no physical <em>idols</em> there.  My understanding (and please correct me if I'm wrong) is that the Methodists have very little imagery in their churches, but they still have a plain cross.</p>\n\n<p>Ask me if the same would hold regarding, say, an Eastern Orthodox church that has lots of icons ... not so simple.</p>\n\n<p>The Holocaust generated (besides <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/8877/21\">the overarching theological question</a>s) a number of dilemmas relating to Jewish ethics and laws; at one point a rabbi was asked (I recall <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/Rabbi_Aaron_Rakeffet-Rothkoff\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this rabbi</a> has an mp3 about it) if a Jew is allowed to  save himself from the Nazis by implying (or outright stating) that he is a Christian, the discussion involved the question of wearing a cross (just the \"t\" shape) vs. a crucifix (which has a picture of someone on it!); the rabbi was lenient in both cases, implying that a worn crucifix is a symbol of belief (Rabbi Rakeffet compares it to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_symbolism_in_the_United_States_military#Christian\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">insignia worn by a chaplain</a>), not an idol.</p>\n\n<p>Again, I can't tell you how every worshipper treats every cross in every church, but we have a few cases here that give us some starting points.</p>\n\n<p>Note that all of this discussion is limited to \"am I prohibited from receiving any benefit from such-and-such an item\" or \"what may I make use of in a life-or-death situation?\" In today's liberal society it is prohibited (not to mention foolish and counterproductive) to actively damage someone else's property or body because of their beliefs, no matter how theologically wrong we feel they are. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Archaeological evidence  suggests that the cross is actually not an invention of Christianity in the first place as It has been used since a long time to represent pagan idols as well as used as  an accoutrement  to idolatry. Specifically The cross represented the religious trinity of heathen pagan deities like Semiramis, Tammuz and Nimrod</p>\n\n<p>Author Sam Wickramasinghe writes in his book Babylonia, the Cross and Crucifiction:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In pictorial history of bygone civilizations, the cross was found...\n  as a symbol of life and regeneration (reproduction), and to its\n  connection with religion... in Babylonia, Phoenicia, Assyria</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article which specifically deals with this issue, <a href=\"http://forgottenreality.xanga.com/706953810/item/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"<strong>The Cross was used as an Idol in Ancient Babylon</strong>\"</a> elaborates on the matter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The archaeological findings of Ancient Babylon reveal that the \"cross\"\n  was used on necklaces and earrings, in much the same way that people\n  use them on jewelry, in imitation of their religious devotions.</p>\n  \n  <p>These findings - show that the cross was used as a religious symbol\n  long before Christ was born. The cross represented the religious\n  trinity of Babylon with Semiramis, Tammuz and Nimrod as the\n  originators of this doctrine. As an emblem of the union between the\n  male and the female So it is clear from above on the aspect that the\n  prayer is not directed to God alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason to introduce cross in this new religion of Christianity was done to pollute it with pagan ideas. This was done to make the transition from paganism to the new religion easy for the pagan followers.</p>\n\n<p>The earlier Christianity themselves never practiced cross worship, and specially condemned it as wooden Idols:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The representation of Christ's redemptive death  on Golgotha  does\n  not occur in the symbolic art of the first Christian centuries.  The\n  early Christians, influenced by the Old Testament prohibition  of\n  graven images, were reluctant to depict even the instrument  of the\n  Lord's Passion.\"\n  -New Catholic Encyclopedia (1967), Vol. IV, p. 486</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Crosses, moreover,  we neither worship nor wish for.  You, indeed,\n  who consecrate gods  of wood, adore wooden crosses  perhaps as parts\n  of your gods. . .\"\n  -(The Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 4, p. 191) \n       Minucius Felix - 3rd Century</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence for all practical purposes <a href=\"http://www.eternalcog.org/ecgbooklets/the_truth_cross.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">crosses are to be considered as Idols as they are considered so even by some Christian sects</a>. The worshipers of cross don't realize it due to the ignorance on their part and this should not be a reason for us to remain ignorant about them.</p>\n\n<p>The Christian sects which believe the cross to be an Idol are actually an extremely small minority overlooked by the majority <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcedonian_Christianity\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chalcedonian Christianity</a> , The protestants , catholics and its sub sects belong to the Chalcedonian  creed both of which consider it to be lawful, rather encouraged to use the cross to worship facing it.</p>\n\n\n",

The first stage Qiddushin - it is often translated as \"betrothal\" however it is of greater significance than the English word connotes. Once Qiddushin has taken place, the couple are fully married - they simply have not yet been intimate with one another (this takes place after Nissuin). The case under consideration is where it is suspected that the wife has had an adulterous relationship once Qiddushin has already taken place and prior to the Nissuin. In order to be liable for capital punishment there would need to be witnesses testifying that they witnessed her commit the adulterous act. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is private crossdressing authorized?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is it permissible to wear women clothes in total privacy without anyone watching it. Not for sexual purpose but to release pressure?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>The Chinuch says in Mitzvah #443 in reference to the prohibition of men wearing women's clothing: \"ונוהג איסור זה בכל מקום ובכל זמן-This prohibition applies in all places, and at all times.\" </p>\n\n<p>So, it seems pretty clear that it's not allowed in any sort of setting.</p>\n\n<p>In general, you should know, that the <em>mitzvot</em> apply equally in public and private. For example, no one would suggest that pig is permitted to be eaten when in private. This can be seen from what are Rabbis stated countless times: That a decree (\"גזרה\") that was put into force by the Sages is also prohibited \"בחדרי חדרים-In the innermost rooms,\" even though it may seem that the decree was only enacted to ensure that people watching wouldn't become confused. This would apply all the more so for Torah prohibitions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I read the question with a great sense of concern for the questioner. I was reminded of statements by Rabbi Kalman Topp who reminds us that “the Torah is both a Torat emet — a Torah of truth conveyed through laws and values, as well as a Torat chesed — a Torah filled with compassion. A religious Jew is compelled to grapple with this dialectic and integrate both components,” Topp says also say” we adhere fully to our tradition of Jewish law without denying the commandments inherent in it. At the same time, we recognize that a core element of that tradition is to appreciate — with compassion and respect — the humanity of every single individual and act accordingly.” I offer a summary of some of the thinking around cross-dressing. I wonder if the more lenient view would not be supportive of private-cross dressing as it does not seem to amount to the “violations” that the halacha seems to seek to avoid.  </p>\n\n<p>The biblical prohibition against cross-dressing occurs in in Deuteronomy 22:5 \nA man's attire shall not be on a woman, nor may a man wear a woman's garment because whoever does these [things] is an abomination to the Lord, your God.</p>\n\n<p>The question on cross-dressing arise in the Talmud Bavli Nazir 59a as a point of disagreement between Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov and the Tanna Kamma. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov forbids any situation in which a man dresses like a woman or a woman dresses like a man, whilst the Tanna Kamma objects that the Torah only forbids this in a situation of to’eva (a repugnant act), which would only occur if the purpose was to allow a man to sit among women or a woman to sit among men.\nRashi (c. 1040-1105 C.E.) commenting on Deuteronomy 22:5 and drawing on the Talmud Nazir, 59a says that the prohibition is limited to concealing identity for the purpose of adultery. With respect to a man wearing women’s clothing Rashi says: “Simlat Isha, a man shall not wear a women’s garment: So, he can go and be among the women.” If a man dresses as a woman, he can sneak among women for sin. A married woman walking to a secluded place with a man will fall under suspicion. If she walks with what looks like another woman, no one will ask questions. Likewise, for a woman wearing man’s clothing “Kli gever, a man’s item should not be on a woman: That she should not appear as a man so she can go out among men, for this is only for the purpose of adultery.” Rashi explains the moral force of this: “To<code>eva, abhorrence: The Torah forbids only garments that may lead to to</code>eva, abhorrence.”  Rashi seems to limit the prohibition to this case. Thus, men and women cross-dressing in other circumstances might not be prohibited, at least if it can be assured that the “abhorrence” will not result. Essentially according to Rashi, cross-dressing is forbidden because it facilitates the breaking of miztvot.\nHowever, Rambam explains it differently. The Rambam, Hilchot Avodah Zara 12:10 follows Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov’s opinion that wearing women’s clothing of any kind is completely prohibited. In Sefer Ha-Mitzvot, prohibition 40 he states that the prohibition has two reasons. First, cross-dressing was an ancient idolatrous practice; it was part of certain rituals. In order to distance us from idolatry, the Torah prohibits a number of pagan ritualistic practices. Additionally, crossdressing is a form of impropriety, and leads to, sexual impropriety.\nUnlike Rashi he says that people sometimes cross-dress in order to arouse their desires, which then leads to improprieties. According to Rambam, cross-dressing leads to arousal which itself leads to the breaking of mitzvot.</p>\n\n<p>I know there are further opinions but perhaps these are helpful. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>this forum is probably not the place to get into detailed halakhik dicussions, and I am certainly not qualified to engage in such discussion, but the tur in yoreh deah on the siman about crossdressing cites the gemara in nazir and both tanaic opinions are brought down by the tur and bet yosef.  I do not have access to the sefarim right now, but it is easy to locate.  one of the tanaim in masekhet nazir clearly says that crossdressing per se is not what the pasuk intended to prohibit because crossdressing itself is not a toavah, and rashi on chumash in ki tezeh brings this lenient opinion to explain the posuk and accordingly the prohibition is only if it is in a situation that can lead to a toevah which is a prohibited sexual intercourse.  while the other tanna disagrees and prohibits a broader range of cross gender acts even if apparently there is no intent to commit any prohibited sexual act, in dire circumstances one can rely on a single tanna especially since it is 2 individual tannaim as opposed to a yachid and rabim.  I discussed this with a major posek that agreed but only in dire circumstances.  I am not, however, saying that anyone should rely on this, rather, look for an intelligent posek who knows about the realities of what crossdressers are really about.  the classic poskim on this siman do not discuss the situation of shaat hadkhak - or psychological anxiety which can be significant for a crossdresser.    </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Killing somebody with the keys to the synagogue\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Yoreh Deah 339:1, the <em>mechaber</em> brings a variety of things that one is not permitted to do to a <em>goses</em> (a person on the brink of death), since each of these things causes the <em>goses</em> to die sooner. Since a <em>goses</em> is considered a living person in every respect (הגוסס הרי הוא כחי לכל דבריו) even one who closes their eyes as they are dying is a murderer (וכל המעמץ עם יציאת הנפש ה\"ז שופך דמים).</p>\n\n<p>Some of the examples that are given, concerning what may not be done, are of a curious nature, but the strangest (to my mind) is one brought by the Rema:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן אסור לגרום למת שימות מהרה כגון מי שהוא גוסס זמן ארוך ולא יוכל\n  להפרד... אסור לשום מפתחות ב\"ה תחת ראשו כדי שיפרד</p>\n  \n  <p>Likewise, it is forbidden to cause the deceased to die quickly - for\n  example, if he has been a <em>goses</em> for a long time and is unable to\n  depart... It is forbidden to place the synagogue keys [or the keys of\n  the <em>bet hamidrash</em>] underneath his head [the head of the <em>goses</em>] in\n  order that he may depart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seeing as none of the <em>nos'ei keilim</em> appear to comment on this, and since I have never heard of such a thing anywhere else, I wonder if anybody here can shed light on it? For what reason was it believed in the 16th century that placing the keys of the synagogue (or <em>bet hamidrash</em>) underneath a sick person's head might cause them to expire? Does this have a basis in any older examples of rabbinic literature?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 27)\n\n<p>Based on the Sefer ha-Hassidim there was a belief that the souls of the dead would pray in the synagogue at night when no one was around... based on that it appears that the belief arose in Eastern Europe that placing the key to the synagogue beneath the pillow of the <em>goses</em> would help his soul escape the body as it would be stirred to join up with the other souls praying in the synagogue.

But I will simply point out that one can theologically violate \"worshipping something other than God\" without necessary rendering a specific object an \"idol.\" (E.g. if someone walks onto my yard and bows down to my apple tree and tries to worship it, he is committing idolatry, but he had no ownership of my tree and therefore didn't render it an \"idol.\" I can still use that tree. Versus a tree that was planted for the purposes of worship is prohibited from use.)</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud's tractate of \"Avoda Zarah\" (foreign worship) devotes its third chapter to this, what's called an idol and what's more likely a decoration. E.g. a rule of thumb had been that a Greek/Roman statue of a person holding a globe, staff, or bird was likely actually idolized, whereas a statue of a person holding something else (e.g. a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_liberty\" rel=\"nofollow\">torch</a>?) was probably just symbolic. Similarly there's the story of a Greek bathhouse with an image of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aphrodite</a> on it; a rabbi still used the bathhouse. Asked how he could do so,\nhe explained (after exiting the bathhouse, as we don't discuss Torah in a bathhouse): \"you Greeks didn't say, let's build a bathhouse to glorify Aphrodite. You said, let's build a bathhouse because we want one, and we'll put an Aphrodite on it to glorify the bathhouse!\"</p>\n\n<p>Later works such as Shulchan Aruch discuss many more cases (e.g. the Hispanic-products aisle in many supermarkets contains candles with pictures of saints on the glass jar -- while I strongly recommend buying regular candles instead, if this was the only candle available, a rabbi should ask -- was that truly made for the purpose of worship, or was that made by Acme Candle Co. who would just as happily put SpongeBob Squarepants on the jar if it sells better?)</p>\n\n\n",

Some rishonim say that a man can share the merits of his learning with the person who supports him, but this has to be agreed on beforehand. That way the supporter can get merit for helping someone to learn Torah. But after the learning has been done, there is no way to \"sell\" the merit, and attempts to do so are deserving of \"scorn\" (בוז יבוזו לו). The article paraphrases R' Yerucham: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if the chacham actually writes a contract to sell the already learned \n  Torah, he loses the merit he had gained for this Torah  learning \n  although the purchaser does not acquire it</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you can't sell merit for one deed, you obviously cannot sell an entire \"portion\" in olam haba.

Meaning they were written (compiled?) by the sages in roughly the Talmudic era. Examples would be Bereshis Rabba, Midrash Tanchuma, Pirkei d'Rebbi Eliezer. </p>\n\n<p>Then there are midrashim that seem to be apocryphal.

Even <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/14013\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רב פעלים</a> by R.

The origins and authorship of non-canonic midrashic works are often unknown and were not transmitted with the same authority as that of the Talmud. That does not mean non-canonic midrashim ought not be studied, but their stature ought be considered. When considering non-canonic midrashim, I would look at whether the Geonim/Rishonim cite it authoritatively (e.g. Midrash Rabbah), on the one end, or whether they are dismissive/questioning of it, on the other (e.g. Shiur Qomah).</p>\n<p>With these principles in mind, I think one can determine how much weight to put into a given midrashic work. It ought be evident, the conclusion is not always a simply binary of acceptable/unacceptable.

One can also discern that a Midrash is authentic if it is repeated multiple different times in different compilations or areas in certain texts. The source of all Midrashim can be located by looking at compiled chains of transmission for their appropriate narrations and comparing it to works such as the Tosefta. Determining whether a Midrash is read in the Pshat or not is a different question.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Midrash is very subversive. The midrashim now known as \"classic\" today, and taught by every 3rd grade rebbe, weren't necessarily learned or accepted by all Jews throughout history. Different communities had their own work, whether it was Midrash Hagadol by Yemenite Jews in the Middle Ages, to Midrash Rabbah around the 400-500s C.E, to the Tosedta, written much earlier and in Israel. </p>\n\n<p>Point is, at various times and locations,there were many different \"authentic\" midrashic collections floating around and getting redacted and assembled. Nowadays, certain midrashim are very popular, either because they are quoted by Rashi, or have other appeal, but there are certainly midrashim that aren't learned today that were once revered. </p>\n\n\n",

Tosfos distinguishes this from carrying other items in the mouth as in the Mishna in Shabbos, since walking while eating is a normal way to carry food. I have likewise been taught not to exit the eruv while eating.</p>\n<p>Also, although for carrying there is no distinction between the right and the left, for other melachos this is not always the case. In the melachah of writing there clearly is a distinction; carrying is normal in either hand, but writing is not. A lefty is not halachically in the minority in this regard either, or else he would have an automatic shinui. In fact, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.103a.9?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 103a</a>, it says regarding a lefty writing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְתֶהֱוֵי שְׂמֹאל דִּידֵיהּ כְּיָמִין דְּכוּלֵּי עָלְמָא</p>\n<p>Let his left have the status of the whole world's right!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This statement, as it applies to lefties, is accepted as a valid point and is never rebutted.

Since a lefty's left has the status of the whole world's right, he is part of the majority who write with their dominant hand (whichever that is), and so writing with his left does not constitute a shinui for him.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the status of the psak of a Maharat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If an orthodox male Rabbi bestows semicha on a woman (dubbed Maharat), what is the status of her halachic decisions? This question is irrespective of whether or not the male Rabbi should confer semicha and whether or not the woman should publicly render halachic decisions. I am asking if, after the fact, Person X got a psak from a Maharat is that psak binding on Person X?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>The issue we have to ask is why is a psak (legal ruling) ever binding in the first place? Why can't you just ask the next person?</p>\n\n<p>There are two main possibilities (see Shach YD 242:31):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>שויה אנפשיה חתיכה דאיסורא The asker accepted upon themselves when they asked the first authority to follow their answer. Let's assume for now this principle works similar to a <em>neder</em> (see, though, Ketzos 34).</p></li>\n<li><p>כבוד הרב The asker mustn't ask a second authority lest it impugn the honor of the first authority.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There a couple possible ways of testing this difference.</p>\n\n<p>The Bavli (Avoda Zara 7a) tells that one may not ask a second authority (חכם) for a lenient ruling after receiving a stringent ruling from a first authority. The Yerushalmi (Shabbat 19:1 as understood by Rosh AZ 1:3) seems to say that one may not even ask a second authority for a stringent ruling after the first authority rules leniently. (Note: the Bavli doesn't explicitly reject the Yerushalmi's case; it just doesn't discuss it.) The Shach (at least) presents this argument in light of the two sides discussed above. Rama rules like Rosh's understanding of the Yerushalmi, while Shach disputes this, marshaling many, many authorities who ruled like the straightforward understanding of the Bavli.</p>\n\n<p>If we take the first possibility, שויה אנפשיה חתיכה דאיסורא, then it seems there is little room to distinguish between who gives the psak, as the asker has accepted the answer upon themselves (provided of course there is no clear mistake made). If we take the second possibility, then we can distinguish between different authorities, depending on how much respect is due to a Maharat or other non-standard rabbinic authority. CYLO...A.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>While I'm here it is worth noting that a women is certainly capable of issuing a \"psak\" if she is learned enough as is evident from the prohibition on issuing a psak after drinking wine. Sefer Hachinuch writes (#152):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונוהג איסור ביאת מקדש בשכרות בזמן הבית בזכרים ונקבות, ומניעת ההוראה בכל מקום ובכל זמן בזכרים, וכן באשה חכמה הראויה להורות. וכל מי שהוא חכם גדול שבני אדם סומכין על הוראתו, אסור לו לשנות לתלמידיו והוא שתוי, שהלימוד שלו כמו הוראה הוא. כמו שאמרנו.‏<br>\n  And the prohibition of entering the Temple while drunk is in effect in the days of the Temple for males and females, and [the prohibition] or ruling [while drunk] [which Sefer Hachinuch counts in the same Mitzva - AA] is in effect in all places and at all times for males, and similarly for a woman who is wise and eligible to rule. And anyone who is very wise that people rely on his rulings cannot teach his students while drunk, for his teachings are like rulings, as we discussed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When and to whom she should issue such rulings is, as you mentioned, not a part of this question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is an issue of serarah brought by rambam in hilchot melachim 1:5 that women cannot serve in positions where they would have authority or direct command over others. L'chorah, issuing a psak Halacha is a form of serarah, so even if a woman is learned and became a Maharat, she couldn't, according to this De'ah. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I didn't realize this was such a charged subject- or was my halachic analysis really that distorted? There is an idea called serarah, it is brought down in the rambam, it would preclude a woman from issuing a psak, and it would imply that if she did so then the psak would not be binding, which is what the questioner asked. Of course, there are those that disagree with rambam. I do find myself more sympathetic to the idea of a Maharat than not, but issuing psakim is a complicated idea, when serarah is involved. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Basically we have a rule, once <em>chacham</em> (\"wise person\") #1 has ruled specifically on your question, you're not supposed to ask <em>chacham</em> #2 unless you tell them your complete story. (\"I asked chacham #1 and was told this, now how do you feel?\")</p>\n<p>My understanding is that this concerns actual ruling which requires making judgment calls on the case. If I call the Star-K and ask them \"what bracha do you make on hearts of palm?\" and they immediately reply \"<a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/589/insights-from-the-institute-fall-2011/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">our policy is ha'etz</a>\", that wasn't a tailored ruling; if you really want to call the cRc and ask them, it's a bit silly but I don't think it's disrespectful.</p>\n<p>As DoubleAA pointed out based on Sefer HaChinuch (and many great contemporary rabbis have ruled similarly), in theory a learned woman can render <em>psak</em> the same way a man can.</p>\n<p>There are two remaining questions, really. Competence to render tailored psak, and communal structure.</p>\n<p>The competence to render tailored psak simply depends on the knowledge and judgment of the person rendering it. You can't make a blanket rule about men or women with any given piece of paper. But please be aware that those who have spent much more time starting with the Talmudic theory and developing all the way through the sources can give a much better tailored psak than someone who was given some guidelines as a halachic digest. I don't know to what extent a Maharat is trained/authorized/expected to render tailored psak, and I suspect they'd be honest if you asked them this. Most yoatzot halacha, for example (including all those outside of Israel, as last I hear it), make no claims to issue binding <em>psak</em>, though they can consult a <em>posek</em> if needed. For instance, she could look at a <em>bedika</em> cloth and either say \"this is obviously fine\" or \"this needs a judgment call, you need to speak to someone who can render psak.\" (A small handful in Israel have actually been given the advanced training to do so.)</p>\n<p>Communal structure is a different issue; if my neighbor calls me up with a question that requires a judgment call, if there is a town rabbi who is available and competent to pasken then it's a good idea to direct the question to them. Ask me what happens to \"communal structure\" in a world where everyone just checks their own website instead, though; I don't know.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Keeping up with \"local\" standards of modesty and dress - of religious Jews, or of society at large\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In dealing with issues relating to Tzeni'uth (modesty) and clothing, a lot depends on \"local\" standards of dress. For example, the RaMBa\"M (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=4&hilchos=22&perek=13&halocha=11&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) explains that in places where women do not normally go out with just their hair covered, but with veils as well, they should be sure to wear veils as a matter of Halachah.  However, since any deviation in the local standard would be a violation of this principle, it would stand to reason that we ought never to have changed our standard of dress from the time of Sinai. Since that is observably not the case, does this mean that, both in practice <em>and in Halachah</em>, we recognize societal standards in determining how we ought to dress in terms of modesty?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Perisha (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x4989\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YD 182:5</a>) gives two suggestions for how a place could change the associated gender of a particular clothing or action: either we follow the custom of the local non-Jews or a whole community of Jews could decide to change together.</p>\n\n<p>Modesty norms, which are all about not attracting attention and hence based on the current facts on the ground, would seem to be no worse.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Broyde has a yutorah mp3 regarding hair covering where he says it appears that the general standard of <em>erva</em> is probably subjectively tied to what's considered appropriate by <em>modest</em> non-Jewish women in general society.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Societal standards definitely affect how we ought to dress. Rabbi Yehudah Henkin quotes his grandfather, who said, “there is no prohibition against women wearing loose pants.\" If the purpose of tsnius is to act in a way that does not draw unnecessary attention to oneself, the way other people dress certainly makes a difference. What was necessary to achieve this level at one time is different from what is necessary now.</p>\n\n\n",

It is possible that someone could have \"sinned\" more but in the bigger picture have accomplished this \"purification\" to a higher degree by greater refraining from engaging in physicality.  It is also possible that they did teshuva for any sins they did, and on top of that achieved this \"purification\" to a higher degree.</p>\n\n\n",

And the greatest of the righteous die with a loving \"death kiss.\" And the Talmud writes concerning \"For this let every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found\" This refers to death, for in death a man corrects all that which he sought to rectify all the days of his life.

The idea taught by this law is this: Those who have defiled themselves would never be allowed to enter the Sanctuary, or to partake of holy things, were it not for the sacrifice of the red heifer, by which this sin is removed; in the same manner as the plate [which the high-priest wears on his forehead] atones for uncleanness, and as a similar object is attained by the goats that are burnt. For this reason those were unclean who were engaged in the sacrifice of the heifer or the goats which were burnt, and even their garments were unclean.

Our answer hereunto is that it is by no means extraordinary that one and the same thing should roduce two opposite effects, depending on the nature of the body that encounters it. For we note that fire liquefies lead while it solidifies milk, and that water moistens the wood of the pine while it dries that of the sycamore. We find, furthermore, that good food is beneficial to the person who is hungry but harmful to him that is sated, and that choice medicine might be of benefit to the sick and yet do harm to the person who is in good health. Hence it is not strange that the same thing should have the effect of purifying the impure and defiling the pure.</p>\n<p>(Rosenblatt translation p. 178)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Though the purpose of the pasuk (and midrash) stressing his Egyptian identity is indeed a complex one.

They were identified and known as a separate nation, apart from the Egyptians.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on this midrash, clothing was important as identifying mark of Israelites as a separate nation.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding borrowing Egyptian clothing on leaving Egypt, indeed <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9873/showrashi/true#v35\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi (Shemot 12:35)</a> says this, citing <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%90_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%99%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mechilta</a>.

As is written in Malachi 3:6,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּי אֲנִי יְהוָה לֹא שָׁנִיתִי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, from our apparent perspective, \"looking up at Him\" from within our world of time and space, our ability to grasp HaShem is limited by how He reveals himself, via limited and quantized channels known in Kabalah as Sfirot.  From this perspective, it appears to us that He (Chas VeShalom) \"changes\", as sometimes -- for example -- the attribute of Chesed might be more dominant, while at other times the attribute of Gvura might be more dominant.</p>\n\n<p>In our relationship with HaShem, our actions down here can effect a change in the way He reveals himself to us.  As is written in Proverbs 27:19,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כַּמַּיִם הַפָּנִים לַפָּנִים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is within this basic framework that Torah and Mitzvot in general, and Tfilah and Tshuvah in particular, can effect apparent \"changes\" in what we see relative to our perspective \"from down here.\"  But this is not at all a contradiction from HaShem's absolute perspective.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Here is a <a href=\"http://www.torahcafe.com/rabbi-dr-j-immanuel-schochet/can-prayer-change-g-d-e2-80-99s-will-video_db396894b.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">short 5 minute answer</a> to the question by Rabbi Immanuel Schochet.

And even prayer itself, the\n  understanding does not dictate that we should pray to G-d, because the\n  understanding obligates that G-d gives to each creature and each thing\n  in the world the portion fitting for it. And if it is not fitting for\n  it, prayer should not help in this. Furthermore, according to the\n  divine wisdom (Kabala), and the Moray Nevuchim wrote on this (Part 1\n  ch.5), that G-d does not \"change\". Hence, the whole matter of prayer\n  seems to the understanding as if there is \"change\" in G-d, similar to\n  a request which a man begs before a flesh and blood king, to arouse\n  favor and pity in the heart of the king. All this does not apply by\n  G-d. Therefore, he wrote that if the torah did not command this, and\n  that we did not see from the torah that prayer does help, regarding\n  the prayer of Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov, Moshe, and others, and that\n  our Sages did not institute its order, we would not know at all\n  through the understanding neither its order not its matter. <strong>The\n  reason we have been commanded in it is hidden, it is among the hidden\n  precepts of the torah. It has great benefits to arouse a person to\n  awareness of G-d's existence, and His almighty power, and that it is\n  proper to serve Him, and many other fundamentals and good traits which\n  are aroused through prayer.

    "content": "# Can a woman make an eiruv for her minor children?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The g'mara on Eiruvin 82b explains that a man can make an eiruv for his minor children and Canaanite slaves without their consent, but for adult children, his wife, and Hebrew slaves they must consent.  A wife can \"not consent\", it says, by making her own eiruv.  (This makes me wonder what could be going on in the household to lead to that, but that's not my question.)</p>\n\n<p>So a woman can make an eiruv for herself at least, and a man can make one for his household, including his minor children.  Can a woman who has no husband make an eiruv for her minor children, or does she need to find a man to do this for her?  I'm asking about her ability to make the eiruv, not about consent.</p>\n\n<p>Is the answer different depending on why she has no husband (widow versus divorced versus unmarried mother)?  If she can't make an eiruv for her children, who can?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>We're discussing making an <em>eruv techum</em>. That type says \"my home vis-a-vis where I can walk on shabbos isn't here, it's some place east of here where I dropped off some matza.\" That gives you plenty of walking space to the east, but then limits your walking distance to the west more so than had you made no eruv. As making such an eruv limits you in some ways, you can only make an eruv for someone with their consent (unless they're a minor and thus incapable of granting consent). We assume a wife consents unless we hear otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam Eruvin 6:21 points that children under the age of 6 are automatically assumed to be stuck to mom (the same rule of thumb comes up in custody cases).</p>\n\n<p>The case where husband makes one eruv and wife makes another could be quite simple: he makes one to the east as he'd like to visit some friends who live that way, and she makes one to the west to visit some friends of hers. They don't have to be joined at the hip, you know!</p>\n\n<p>Back to your original question, I'd strongly assume (though I don't have a source off-hand) that the rule of thumb here is basically guardianship. If you're responsible for the minor kids, we assume they travel with you. That would mean if the kids trade off between parents each weekend, whoever's watching them that shabbos would cover them with their eruv. The same would apply for any sort of single mom, or for that matter adopted (minor) children.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Chain of tradition for stories/parables told by Rashi\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/16674/5\">I've already asked</a> one question about where Rashi got a particularly troubling interpretation of an obscure reference in the Gemara, telling a very detailed and gruesome story about R' Meir and his wife Beruriah.</p>\n\n<p>In another instance (<a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=sanhedrin&daf=39a&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bab. Sanhedrin 39a</a>) Rashi expands in great detail upon a vague reference in the Gemara in which R' Yohanan says he knows of only three of the 300 parables about foxes taught by R' Meir to expound on Pesukim. R\"Y gives a very short list, referring to the lessons by key phrases in their associated verses, and then Rashi tells us the story R\"Y is referring to.  But he doesn't just tell us a name for the story (\"The Fox, the Wolf, and the Well\") or give a watered down version of it (\"A fox tricks a wolf into a well by showing him the moon's reflection down there and telling him it's cheese\"). No. Rashi, who usually writes very curtly about simple concepts to aid the reader in understanding the basic meaning of a passage in the Gemara, goes into full-on story-teller mode, for 4 long lines and 10+ short lines, using almost 1/4 of the real estate on the \"Rashi side\" of the printed Vilna edition of the Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>Where do these amazing stories come from in Rashi?  Does he have a source?  Were they taught orally by his teacher's teacher's teacher's teacher's teacher (however many times), dating all the way back to R' Meir?  Are they (usually, generally, occasionally??) recorded elsewhere in works that are traceable/accountable?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps he is quoting material that is not from the Bavli where one version appeared, but rather extra-Talmud Bavli material like the Yerushalmi, Tosefta, The Pesiqtas, or other random midrashim, where stories can vary sometimes from their Bavli counterpart. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I found a fascinating reference to this part of Rashi in an academic article on general medieval literature. Apparently Rashi is the first known instance of this story (about a fox tricking a wolf into think the moon is a wheel of cheese), but it ended up in many other works: a Latin book of Christian morals called the <em>Disciplina Clericalis</em> by Petrus Alfonsus, the Old French mock epic <em>Roman de Renart</em>, and the Middle English <em>The Fox and the Wolf</em>. The author of the article I'm reading guesses it's a variation through oral tradition of one of Aesop's fables, \"The Fox and the Goat.\" Given the timeline (the Talmud was written closer to Rashi's time than Aesop's), it doesn't seem like that much of a stretch to me that they could be inheritors of related oral legends. It's so interesting that it was part of the surrounding non-Jewish tradition as well!</p>\n\n<p>Source: Honegger, Thomas. “A Fox Is a Fox Is a Fox...

The Halachic rulers need to think of the many dangers on one hand, and of all of the advantages on the other.\nIn this answer there has been an attempt to combine old and new and to try and find the sources in Chazal and in the words of the Rishonim and Achronim for the new reality.\nIn leaving a Jewish-owned Internet site open on Shabbat and Yom Tov the questions that arise deal with several prohibitions:\na.  \"Lifney Iver\" ('putting a stumbling block before the blind' – causing failure to someone else) and \"Mesaye'ah Le'overy Aveira\" (assisting a transgressor);\nb.  Sales on Shabbat (in commercial sites);\nc.  Shabbat salary (in sites which collect fees for using them, in virtual stores and markets);\nd.  Enjoying \"chillul Shabbat\" (in commercial sites);\ne.  \"Mar'it Ayin\" and \"Chashad\" (suspicion);\nf.  \"Ziluta DeShabbat\" – disrespect for Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>We shall discuss each one separately and we'll check in each one if the owners transgress the above prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p>A. \"Lifney Iver\" ('putting a stumbling block before the blind') and \"Mesaye'ah Le'overy Aveira\"\n The Torah warned, \"Before a blind man you shall not put a stumbling block\". This prohibition includes causing a Jew to fail by transgressing a prohibition. Since the Internet user who surfs the web is definitely transgressing prohibitions from the Sages (Miderabanan) and maybe even from the Torah (Mide'oraita), one needs to discuss if when the owner of a site leaves it working on Shabbat, he is thereby transgressing the prohibition of \"Lifney Iver\" or of assisting a transgressor.\nThe Gemara says that one does not transgress the prohibition of \"Lifney Iver\" unless the person being caused to fail could not have transgressed the prohibition without the help of the person causing to fail. Therefore, when there are other similar sites, one can say that there is no prohibition from the Torah of \"Lifney Iver\". However, this does not apply when regarding a unique site, which does not have other similar sites, or regarding the kind of sites, which are operated mainly by Jews. However, there is a disagreement in the Rishonim, regarding a case where the transgressor could have transgressed the prohibition even without the help of the person causing him to fail, whether or not assisting him is prohibited from the Sages – the Rema cites two opinions and concludes that one who cares about his soul should be stringent. However, when regarding the prohibition of assisting a transgressor, which is from the Sages, there are opinions of Achronim that the prohibition does not apply in the following situations: assisting someone who converted from Judaism, assisting someone who transgresses purposely, assistance which isn't close in time to the transgression, and assistance when the transgression isn't done with the item given by the collaborator – the person failing the other – to the transgressor, and these cases are connected to our issue.\nAnother reason to support the opinion that keeping the site running does not transgress the prohibitions of \"Lifney Iver\" and assisting a transgressor is that one is given permission to assume that the users of the site are non-Jews or that no one will use the site.\nIt may also be that there is no prohibition of \"Lifney Iver\" and assisting if at the time of the transgressions the collaborator is totally passive.\nWhen closing the site on Shabbat involves money loss, such as losing non-Jewish customers or where the technical solution is problematic, one can add to the permit the opinion of those who say that there is no need to spend money in order to refrain from transgressing the prohibition of \"Lifney Iver\".</p>\n\n<p>B. \"Mimtzo Cheftzecha\" – the prohibition of sales on Shabbat.\nIn sites which provide financial and commercial information, etc., it is clear that the consumer entering the site and reading the information is transgressing the prohibition from the Prophets: \"Mimtzo Cheftzecha VeDaber Davar\", a verse from which the Sages learn that one may not study his assets on Shabbat.\nIn sites which collect money for information or any service or that a payment is given for ordering a certain item, the buyer is also transgressing a prohibition from the Sages of commerce on Shabbat, and he is certainly transgressing the prohibition of \"Mimtzo Cheftzecha\".\nOn the other hand, the provider of the service or the seller, who is totally passive on Shabbat, is apparently not transgressing these prohibitions. However, in order to be in accordance with all opinions, one should make sure that the buyers' credit cards will be charged only after Shabbat, and that this information is publicized in the site in a place where everyone can see.</p>\n\n<p>C. Shabbat Salary\nThe Sages prohibited accepting the salary of working on Shabbat, even for doing a permitted action, and there are Halachic rulers who wrote that this prohibition applies also to renting out one's belongings on Shabbat, and such was ruled in the Shulchan Aruch.\nOne needs to discuss if there is a problem of 'Shabbat Salary' (\"Sachar Shabbat\") when collecting payment for services provided on the Internet, also on Shabbat, or for buying an item, which was ordered on Shabbat from an operating commercial site.\nIt seems that if the payment for using the site is monthly or yearly, there is certainly no problem, since it is considered a salary, which is covered up or intermingled in the rest of the salary, which is permitted. Also payment for an item ordered on the Internet is certainly not Shabbat Salary.\nHowever, receiving a one-time payment for information, watching a movie, downloading music, etc. is indeed prohibited, since it is similar to receiving payment for renting out one's belongings on Shabbat, etc., and this is the law also in the case of a site which has a virtual market, where the owner of the site receives a percentage of each transaction which takes place there. Therefore, such a site could be operated only in partnership with a non-Jew where each person profits from a certain day. Only in the case of great need and great loss of money may one rely on the lenient opinion that one can receive the percentages without a partnership with a non-Jew.</p>\n\n<p>D. Enjoying \"Chillul Shabbat\"\nThe prohibition to receive enjoyment for the desecration of the Shabbat is only regarding enjoying the thing itself through which the Shabbat was desecrated, but not regarding the salary given for the \"chillul Shabbat\". Therefore, in the cases being discussed there is no problem of enjoying the desecration of Shabbat, especially since other people may receive enjoyment from the desecration of the Shabbat right after Shabbat. All this is under the condition that the owner of the site did not transgress any prohibition by leaving the site open on Shabbat (as elaborated in A), since if the site was operated in a prohibited manner, it appears that the owner may not receive the salary for this work.</p>\n\n<p>E. \"Mar'it Ayin\" and \"Chashad\" (suspicion)\nThe Sages prohibited doing on Shabbat a number of things for fear of \"Chashad\" (suspicion) of \"Marit Ayin\" (the appearance of things) – where the observers might suspect that the person doing these things is transgressing a prohibition, even though the actions themselves are not prohibited. For this reason the Sages prohibited renting out a bath-house to a non-Jew for Shabbat even if it is rented out by share of profits – since the bath-house is known under the name of the Jew, and the non-Jew does in it prohibited work on Shabbat. The fear is that people who don't know that the non-Jew has share of profits (and therefore operates the bath-house for his own good) and might think that the non-Jew is the owner's worker, and they will suspect that the owner is transgressing the prohibition of telling the non-Jew to do a prohibited work on Shabbat. Indeed, there are Halachic rulers who wrote that one may not permit placing an automatic vending machine in public, if it is known to be a Jew's, and there are those who wrote the same also about an automatic teller machine.\nHowever, it seems that in this case there is not fear of \"chashad\" and \"marit ayin\" since everyone knows that these machines work automatically, without the assistance of man, and if so, what \"marit ayin\" might there be here? Therefore, it seems that also in leaving a regular or commercial internet site open on Shabbat there is no problem of \"chashad\" and \"marit ayin\", even if it is known to be a Jew's (for example, through the ending .il, etc.), since everyone knows that the site works automatically, without human intervention. Additionally, one may say that there is no law of \"chashad\" and \"marit ayin\" in a place where there are no observant Jews and cannot be observant Jews, since the whole fear of \"chashad\" and \"marit ayin\" is when an observant Jew might suspect another observant Jew that he is transgressing a prohibition. Additionally, we may say that since there is no source for the decree of \"marit ayin\" in new cases such as these, we may not add such decrees.\nMaybe, ideally (lechatchila) one should add a specific note that any order made on Shabbat will not be handled until after Shabbat, and then there is no fear at all.</p>\n\n<p>F. \"Ziluta DeShabbat\" – disrespect for Shabbat.\nIn the Responsa Igrot Moshe, he was asked about the possibility of a Shabbos-Clock turning on an oven so that it begins cooking or baking the food about an hour before eating. In his answer he wrote, among other things, that \"there is a good reason to prohibit for another reason, which is 'ziluta deShabbat' and even 'ziluta de yom tov' which prohibits a number of things. Since it is clear that there is disrespect for Shabbat in this prohibition, even if it was not specifically prohibited, since the prohibition is itself the idea of disrespect. And it is simple, in my opinion, that a person who does something which is disrespectful to Shabbat is transgressing the obligation to honor Shabbat which is an obligation from the Torah which was explained in the Prophets…\"\nIn the Responsa Chelkat Mechokek, the author was asked about leaving an electronic answering machine open on Shabbat so it could accept business orders, and the orders will be dealt with after Shabbat, and he answered that \"…and besides that, this is what the Sages were talking about when they said 'sages be careful with what you say'. When the technique steps a few steps forward, and one day a person might be able to set up a big shop automatically and one can set the store to open at the right hour, and the buyers will come even with no one there, because the merchandise will given out in exchange for the money which they put there, and if we disrespect Shabbat with technical matters, where everything is done on its own, a great desecration of the Shabbat will be born, where a person, while sitting in the Beit Midrash or dining his Shabbat meal and singing songs for Shabbat, and his office or business will be operating normally like on a weekday. I doubt if this isn't like the case the Ramban talks about in Parshat Emor about regularly done commerce, even concerning things which aren't actions prohibited from the Torah… and even if there is a big difference, since the Ramban talks about a case where a person works hard with him on the Shabbat and with effort, and this isn't the same when a person is not doing anything at all, and all is done by the machine before the Shabbat. In any case, the fact that a person's commercial business is operating publicly on Shabbat, means that this is not a day of rest, and in any case it doesn't disclude \"uvdin de'chol\" (weekday type actions) or \"marit ayin\" before the public who don't know the laws of the Torah, and of course \"zachor et yom hashabbat lekadsho\", where one's actions on Shabbat should not be like during the week, is not fulfilled. And this is not like the permit concerning an automatic vending machine, which stands in the public with no name and ownership, where people do not know to whom it belongs. It is different when a person does such a thing in his house and property… and when one allows commerce and acquisitions to take place also on Shabbat, even with the permit of the Torah, this can cause the holiness of the Shabbat to be desecrated and disrespected very much. My son, refrain from such a thing\".\nRegarding these words of the Chelkat Mechokek, the author of the Responsa Be'er Moshe writes: \"I saw in the Responsa of the Chelkat Mechokek that at first he wrote as I did that according to the Halacha there is no reason to prohibit. However, afterwards he made himself the Dayan of decrees, and decreed a new decree, when there is no doubt that no Rabbi, whomever he may be, can decree new decrees. Certainly, if the greatest of the Rabbis of our time will decree a decree, and will agree upon it, we shall accept it upon ourselves, however a single Rabbi may certainly not decree, and we will certainly not accept it upon ourselves\".\nHowever, we may note that the Igrot Moshe spoke of a case where a person does an active action on Friday which will cause disrespect of the Shabbat (he sets the timer to turn on on Shabbat), as opposed to the case of the internet, where a person only refrains from shutting down the site. The Chelkat Mechokek wrote about a person who leaves in his house an electronic answering machine, and this is considered in the public, etc. One may doubt, however, if the operation of an Internet site is considered public (it is certainly not in a person's home). Maybe, one should distinguish between a site that specifically belongs to a Jew (or has the .il ending – which is mostly Jewish-owned) and a site, which is not, considered a Jew's.\nAlso for the definition of public (\"farhesia\") one may distinguish between sites, which serve the general public, and sites, which serve mainly Jews.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Eruv t'chumin for dependants\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One can 'force' a dependant to make an eruv t'chumin. Since they are only made for a dvar mitsva this is considered like forcing him to do a mitsva which one who has the power, has to do. Normally when one makes an eruv for someone else he provides the food and the other person or someone else lifts it up for him. This is called being 'mzakeh' him. In other words this food now belongs to the other person, since one cannot make an eruv t'chumin using someone else's food only his own. Now my question is when someone makes an eruv for a dependant must he also be m'zakeh him. He has to provide the extra food for him, even if it is a very young child and he cant just be 'added' to his own food. But must he also be m'zake that the food now belongs to the child or can it still belong to him.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You should give the food to child through other person, also when you force him to do the eruv. Only for really small child there is maybe okay that father food is enough for him.\nThe most safe way is so: Always do Zikui, even for small childs - it is easy thing (somebody lifts the food for the child), and you do all opinions this way.</p>\n<p>Even if the father can \"compel\" the child to have an eruv, the eruv must still establish the individual Shevita of the child – and for this, the food should belong to the child.</p>\n<p>The reason why it is okay for very small childs is because they dont have yet own halachic Shevita - their Shevita is same like the father. In this situation, the father food is automatically also working for their Shevita.\nThis is similar to other parts in halacha where very small childs are like part of the parents and not independent halachic things.</p>\n\n\n",

Indeed, the very reason that Hashem allowed Sichon and Og to conquer those territories from their former owners (the nations of Moab and Ammon) was to \"purify\" them and make them available for the Jews to take them without violating the commandments to leave Moab and Ammon alone (Num. 21:26 and Rashi; Judg. 11:16ff; Gittin 38a).</p>\n\n<p>So even without the Gadites and Reuvenites making their claim, it still was going to be Jewish territory.

They can also find answers that wouldn't cross a man's mind simply because the territory is more familiar. The only halachic decisions they give are ones where the questioner's community has a well established consensus ruling. If a decision requires discretion, ie \"pesaq\" or \"hora'ah\", they will consult with a poseiq, a rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>(For all of the above, see <a href=\"http://www.yoatzot.org/questions-and-answers/answer.asp?id=1157\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.yoatzot.org/questions-and-answers/answer.asp?id=1157</a> , from the the website of Nishmat, Rebbetzin Chana Henkin's seminary for producing yo'atzot.)</p>\n\n<p>According to Rav Uzziel, the term \"yo'etzet\" comes from the Amidah. \"Hashiva shofeteinu kevarishonah, veyo'atzeinu kevatchilah -- restore our judges like at first, and our advisors like in the beginning.\" The rabbinate continues the work of the shofeit, these women continue the work of the yo'etz. And is decidedly not that of rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast...</p>\n\n<p>A Maharat's diploma is considered ordination and calls itself by the same term -- semichah <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/2013/06/17/default/what-does-an-orthodox-ordination-certificate-look-like\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.jta.org/2013/06/17/default/what-does-an-orthodox-ordination-certificate-look-like</a> . While it doesn't say \"Toreh Toreh\" the female conjugation of \"Yoreh Yoreh\" (Can he decide halakhah? He can decide!) found on a standard rabbinic ordination, it does say \"heter hora'ah lerabbim -- permission to give rulings to the masses.\" It is \"rabbi\" in all but name and in fact some are calling themselves \"rabbah\", such as the dean of Yeshivat Maharat -- Rabba Sara Hurwitz <a href=\"http://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/faculty-and-staff/2014/5/21/rabba-sara-hurwitz-dean\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/faculty-and-staff/2014/5/21/rabba-sara-hurwitz-dean</a></p>\n\n<p>This is why there is broader acceptance of Yo'atzot than Maharatot: The motivation for creating Yo'atzot is to increase observance of Taharas haMishpachah. Traditional gender roles are preserved, and practical interpretation of halakhah is kept in the hands of people capable of qualifying to become judges. The Maharat is an acknowledgement of feminist ideals, the dignity and authority of today's woman, the level of Jewish education available to them, and consequently a belief that the rabbinate should be open to women.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yoatzot halacha as I understand it are taught about the halachot of niddah in depth and often know a good deal about female reproductive biology (I am unclear how much of this is part of the training program and how much is learned elsewhere by women drawn to the program, such as physicians).  They often serve an entire town rather than a single shul.  They claim not to answer original questions, but only questions that have already been answered by rabbis.  Sometimes they serve as a conduit for a question so that the woman who asks the yoetzet is anonymous to the rabbi (Yoetzet gets the question, asks the rabbi, and gives the rabbi's answer to the questioner.  The rabbi need not know who the woman is, which can reduce the embarrassment some see as inherent in the system.)  Yoatzot also sometimes serve to introduce the questioner to the rabbi or be a support as she asks her question.  Yoatzot are accepted in many Modern Orthodox circles, but I would not say all.</p>\n\n<p>Maharats are a more recent invention and I believe their curriculum is intended to cover all of the things typically included in a semikha program.  Because they receive this training, I suspect that they see themselves having greater freedom to pasken independently, and they certainly fill positions in synagogues that would otherwise go to assistant rabbis or rabbinic interns/students.  This strikes many in the Modern Orthodox community as problematic in that women are being ordained as rabbis by another name.  As such, it is not accepted in most Modern Orthodox circles, but is accepted within Open Orthodox circles.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yoatzot Halacha only learn for the most part how to pasken she'eilot about niddah from women, as well as maybe other \"women's issues.\" </p>\n\n<p>Maharats focus on all of Halacha.

God tested Avraham by commanding him to take his son as a human sacrifice to see if he would obey even this (Genesis 22). However, I am confused by this. Isn't it considered objectively very bad to kill one's son, no matter how much they believe that God wants them to do that? It seems one should expect that objective morals always overrule what someone believes to be commands from God since it could be that they are wrong or mistaken, and in Avraham's case, shouldn't he have been tipped off the the possibility that God wouldn't want him to do that by virtue of the fact that it was a human sacrifice?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a really important question.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It seems one should expect that objective morals always overrule what someone believes to be commands from God since it could be that they are wrong or mistaken...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your question is based on two premises. The first is that an ethic independent of God's will exists. As can be seen in the comments section, this is not a simple issue. The way you've phrased it also indicates that it's something you're not so sure of. Regardless of whether such a thing exists however, there is no question that the Torah itself sees murder as morally reprehensible so the question of how could Avraham attempt to carry out such an action is a valid one.</p>\n\n<p>Your second premise is that Avraham could have been mistaken regarding what God commanded him. This is the the premise which fails. The Rambam writes in his Guide to the Perplexed (3:24) that the story of the Akeidah is a source which proves that when a prophet receives a message from God, he receives its content with absolute certainty. Had Avraham had any doubt whatsoever regarding whether this was God's intention, he would never have attempted to carry it out. Accordingly, Avraham was left between a hard place and a rock. On the one hand, he knew that murder was absolutely morally reprehensible. On the other hand, God had unequivocally told him to kill his son. In such a case it is God's direct command which must prevail and this is exactly the point. Man cannot understand God. He is supposed to try his hardest to do so but it is inevitable that the finite will fall short of the infinite. As such, Avraham didn't know why he was supposed to kill his son but he did know that God wouldn't have commanded it if it wasn't the right thing to do.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps this is best demonstrated with an example. Suppose you found yourself stuck as the only physically fit individual on an island. A surgeon tells you that you need to carry out an amputation on someone else. On the one hand, you know that hacking off people's limbs is wrong. On the other hand, someone moral and more knowledgable than you is telling you that you have to do so. You might not know why but you do know that following the command is the right thing to do. This was essentially Avraham's situation.</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of other questions regarding the Akeidah which still need to be dealt with but I think the above provides a coherent answer to the one you asked. Note also that this is just <em>one</em> approach to begin understanding the Akeidah and there are many others. A whole series of Shiurim going through different approaches can be found <a href=\"http://kmtt.libsyn.com/webpage/category/Akeidat%20Yitzchak\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>you started by making the assumption that the only reason for the akeda was to test if Abraham would follow G-d's command but there is another underlying motive here which is a powerful way of conveying to us that children belong to G-d and not their parents.

In other words, he says, adults might end up with more than an omer apiece (since one omer wouldn't be enough for them), while the children would get less - but in aggregate, there were as many omerim as members of the family.</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14126&st=&pgnum=237\">to Ex. 16:15</a>) says that \"it is reasonable to say the figure of one omer per person is only for adults, while children would receive according to what they could eat.\"</p>\n\n<p>Chasam Sofer (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=794&st=&pgnum=141\">Orach Chaim 181</a>) also argues that indeed the size was proportional to the person, so that an infant would get a smaller omer than an adult, and indeed that the size of it would grow along with him from day to day.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Noda Biyehudah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1497&st=&pgnum=49\">Kamma, Orach Chaim 38</a>) states that indeed it was the same for everyone. Presumably, according to him the babies and others who couldn't eat a full omer would have had some left over. (They weren't allowed to leave any over with the intention of eating it the next day - Ex. 16:19 - but that doesn't mean that there couldn't be some that didn't get eaten and had to be discarded.)</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14949&st=&pgnum=114\">Likkutei Sichos 26:103</a>ff) explains that the <em>man</em> in fact had two different qualities in it. One one hand, it related to the essence of the soul, which is the same for all Jews, and therefore from that point of view it was the same amount (an omer) for everyone. On the other hand, the omer is \"one-tenth of an ephah\" (Ex. 16:36), implying that it's not an absolute measurement but a relative one (just as the omer varies with the size of the ephah), and in that sense it therefore varied with the abilities of the person eating it. (He notes, also, that this is why the Torah leaves that definition of the omer until the end of the passage, after describing how they ate the <em>man</em> at the borders of Eretz Yisrael: because it's only then that this second, individualized aspect of it became the primary one - when they were preparing for their individualized service of Hashem each in their own homestead.)</p>\n\n\n",

This demonstrated his ultimate self-sacrifice for God, publicly.

He lived his whole life to spread G-dliness, and here is the ultimate way to show how much you believe in G-d - That you are willing to give up your life for it. </p>\n\n<p>The Akeida, on the other hand, had no \"side\" purpose. No one saw it, and moreover, it would have resulted in there not being a continuation of Avraham's mission in the next generation. Yitzchak's death would result in the death of monotheism. Moreover, Avraham didn't \"have to\" bring up Yitzchak, Hashem only requested it, Avraham had a promise that Yitzchak would be his offspring, etc. He had lots of answers.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, he chose to do what Hashem told him <em>specifically because Hashem told him to do so</em>. This level wasn't there in the previous tests.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The fiery furnace was sacrificing himself, which does not go against Avraham's nature of being kind to others.  The Akeida is sacrificing someone else, his own son no less (nature of father is to have mercy on his son), which was a direct challenge to his attribute of kindness, in which he excelled.</p>\n\n<p>It is in this vein that it can be understood the gemara in Sanhedrin which says that the Avos were tested and David Hamelech was not tested - did King David have an easy life free of challenges?  The meaning of the gemara is that the Avos underwent tests that went diametrically against their natures.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Based on your name, it seems that you are Muslim. Placing both these stories on equal veracity / historicity in Islam, but not <strong>necessarily</strong> in Judaism. It depends who you ask.</p>\n\n<p>Avraham's binding of Yitzchak is in the Biblical text itself. The facing off with Nimrod and being cast into the fiery furnace is midrash.</p>\n\n<p>And the details within that midrash parallel the details described in the Biblical book of Daniel (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadrach,_Meshach,_and_Abednego\" rel=\"nofollow\">perek 3</a>), where the protagonists are Chanania, Mishael, and Azarya, who are cast into a fiery furnace rather than bow to an idol. This midrash is perhaps retrojecting the story of the descendants onto the ancestor, the first monotheist, and is an example of a midrash which was not intended literally, making some theological point. </p>\n\n<p>Though the idea that he would be willing to commit himself to the fire in such manner might well be pulled from his behavior in the Binding of Yitzchak where he was willing to give up his son, his very soul ('yechidcha'), whom he indeed loved ('asher ahavta'). To turn around and ask why the Biblical narrative is required after we have the midrash would be to have things backwards.</p>\n\n<p>But besides this, if we are to grant the premises of the question, then there are all sorts of possible answers. I would say: from a psychological perspective, and despite the opposite by Iyov, people are often willing to be a martyr themselves but not put up those they love.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is the midrash about the moon and sun being the same size intended literally?",
    "content": "# Is the midrash about the moon and sun being the same size intended literally?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam in his introduction to perek Chelek discusses midrashic literalist, and classifies different approaches of different groups to midrash. He <a href=\"http://yediah.blogspot.com/2008/01/foolishness-of-literalists-rambam-on.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You should know that as to [understanding] the words of the sages [Rambam is referring to Aggadeta] people are divided into three groups. The first group consists of the majority of the people I met, those that I read their books or that I heard about. They understand them literally without explaining them at all, accepting impossibilities as fact [literally: impossibilities as necessary existents]. They did this because of their ignorance [literally: foolishness] and their distance from the sciences, not having enough perfection to take notice themselves or because no one brought this to their attention [that these things are impossible. In other words, the lack of learning and information does not even trigger in their mind the possibility that this is absurd.] They therefore think that all the intelligent sayings of the sages are to be understood literally, as they understand them, although there are some sayings that are strange. Some things they say would stump even the masses and how much more the unique [learned] ones among them. This pathetic [literally: poor] group [literalists], a pity on their foolishness, think that they are elevating [as in bringing respect to] the sages, while they are utterly debasing them without even taking notice. I swear in God’s name [literally: By the life of God], that this group destroy the beauty of the Torah and darken its luster presenting it in a way that is the opposite of what was its intent. God stated about the wisdom of His Torah that “when they hear all these statutes”… while this group understands the words of the sages in a way that if the nations will hear this they will say “this small nation is foolish!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The midrash about the Sun and Moon being the same size is probably one such midrash which is not intended literally. As msh210 writes in this <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14641/how-did-the-moon-shrink\">parallel question</a>, correctly I think,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Presumably this midrash is not meant literally. (Moons don't talk, for one thing.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The midrash in question appears in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=60b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chulin 60b</a> and in Bereishit Rabba:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said: Two verses contradict one another: “And God created the two great luminaries” [Gen 1:16], and it is written, “the great light... and the small light” [ibid.]. The moon said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the Universe, can two kings wear one crown? He said to her: Go and diminish yourself. She said before Him: Master of the Universe, because I said a proper thing before You, must I diminish myself?! He said to her: Go and rule over the day and the night. She said to Him: Of what benefit is a candle in bright daylight? Of what benefit can I be? He said: Let Israel count days and years by you. She said to Him: the day is also impossible, nor are tekufot counted according to me. As is written: “and they [i.e., both the sun and the moon] shall be for seasons and appointed times, for days and years” [ibid. 1:15]. [He said:] Go and let the righteous be called by your name—Jacob the Small [<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16179/showrashi/true#v5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amos 7:5</a>], Samuel the Small [1 Sam 2:19], David the Small [<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15845/showrashi/true#v11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Sam 16:11</a>, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15846/showrashi/true#v14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">17:14</a>].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On a peshat level, the pesukim pose no contradiction. The two great luminaries, Sun and Moon, refer to the fact that they are both large. And the large luminary and small luminary refer to their comparative size. But the midrash makes a derasha.</p>\n\n<p>This midrash has certainly been interpreted allegorically. <a href=\"http://hitzeiyehonatan.blogspot.com/2006/05/bamidbar-rosh-hodesh-midrash.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Thus</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I can only touch very briefly upon another line of interpretation, appearing both in Maharsh”a (R. Shmuel Idels of Ostraha, the most important commentator on the aggadah in the Talmud), and in the previously-mentioned midrash in Genesis Rabbah 6.3: viz. that the moon here symbolizes the Jewish people, whose historical destiny was to assume a “diminished,” politically subjugated role through much of their history. God’s counsel to the moon is also His advice to the Jews: to accept their difficult, “smaller” situation, of having only “reflected“ light in this world (which is compared to night), with a kind of philosophical resignation; and to comfort themselves, (a) with occasional periods of ascent, and (b) with the promise of messianic redemption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the early texts of Kiddush Levana, there was no prayer to resize the moon. Thus, the <a href=\"http://ravtzair.blogspot.com/2009/05/blog-post_6174.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">two early sources</a> are <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_42.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 42a</a> which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Aha b. Hanina also said in the name of R. Assi in R. Johanan's name: Whoever pronounces the benediction over the new moon in its due time welcomes, as it were, the presence of the Shechinah: for one passage states, This month;12  whilst elsewhere it is said, This is my God, and I will giorify Him.13\n  In the school of Rabbi Ishmael it was taught: Had Israel inherited no other privilege14  than to greet the presence of their Heavenly Father once a month,15  it were sufficient. Abaye said: Therefore16  we must recite it standing. But Meremar and Mar Zutra allowed themselves to be carried on the shoulders17  when they pronounced the blessing.\n  R. Aha said to R. Ashi: In 'the West,' they pronounce the following benediction: 'Blessed be He who reneweth the moons.' Whereupon he retorted: Such a blessing even our women folk pronounce!18  But [one should rather use the following], in accordance with Rab Judah, who gives it thus: Praised etc.19  who created the Heavens with His word, and all their hosts with the breath of His mouth. He appointed unto them fixed laws and times, that they should not change their ordinance. They rejoice and are glad to do the will of their Creator. They work20  truthfully, for their action is truth. The moon He ordered that she should renew herself as a crown of beauty for those whom He sustains from the womb,21  and who will, like it, be renewed in the future, and magnify their Maker in the name of the glory of His kingdom. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who renewest the moons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And later, in the post-Talmudic minor tractate Soferim, we find:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין מברכין על הירח אלא במוצאי שבת, כשהוא מבושם, ובכלים נאים, ותולה עיניו כנגדה, ומיישר את רגליו, ומברך, אשר במאמרו ברא שחקים, וברוח פיו כל צבאם, חוק וזמן נתן להם שלא ישנו את תפקידם, פועלי אמת שפעולתם אמת, וללבנה אמר שתתחדש באור יקר ועטרת תפארת לעמוסי בטן, שהם עתידים להתחדש כמותה, ולפאר ליוצרם על כבוד מלכותו, ברוך אתה י\"י מקדש ישראל וראשי חדשים. ואומר שלש פעמים, סימן טוב, סימן טוב, סימן טוב, תיהוי לכל ישראל, ברוך בוראך, ברוך יוצרך, ברוך מקדשך, ורוקד שלש רקידות כנגדה, ואומר שלש פעמים, כשם שאני רוקד כנגדך ואיני נוגע בך, כך אם ירקדו בני אדם כנגדי לא יגעו בי, תפול עליהם אימתה ופחד, ולמפרע, אמן אמן אמן, סלה הללויה. ואומר לחבירו שלש פעמים שלום עליך, וילך לביתו בלב טוב. והדה היא מפסיקין לראשי חדשים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Neither of these texts mentions such a prayer for restoration of the moon to match the sun or the sun to its even greater light. Nor it is in the Rambam, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2510n.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hilchos Berachos, perek 10</a>. The Arizal added various mizmorim at the end of Kiddush Levana. As Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiddush_levana\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is customary to say additional passages that were added to this blessing in the 16th century by Rabbi Yitzhak Luria. These are Kabbalistic verses and it is difficult to understand their deeper meaning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My guess (but I have not researched this nearly enough) is that this passage praying for restoration of the moon and sun is one such added passage. This reads as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וִיהִי רָצוֹן מִלְּפָנֶיךָ ה` אֱלֹהַי וֵאלֹהֵי אֲבוֹתַי לְמַלֹּאת פְּגִימַת הַלְּבָנָה וְלֹא יִהְיֶה בָּהּ שׁוּם מִעוּט. וִיהִי אוֹר הַלְּבָנָה כְּאוֹר הַשמש וּכְאוֹר שִׁבְעַת יְמֵי בְרֵאשִׁית כְּמוֹ שֶׁהָיְתָה קוֹדֶם מִעוּטָהּ. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר אֶת שְׁנֵי הַמְּאֹרוֹת הַגְּדוֹלִים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to have kabbalistic significance, about the primordial light (such that the Or was created before the Sun, and was hidden away for the righteous messianic days) and if so would not (necessarily) be intended literally either. </p>\n\n<p>Yet the idea appears much earlier, as we can note in the direct parallel to both moon and sun in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1030.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshaya 30</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהָיָה אוֹר-הַלְּבָנָה, כְּאוֹר הַחַמָּה, וְאוֹר הַחַמָּה יִהְיֶה שִׁבְעָתַיִם, כְּאוֹר שִׁבְעַת הַיָּמִים--בְּיוֹם, חֲבֹשׁ יְהוָה אֶת-שֶׁבֶר עַמּוֹ, וּמַחַץ מַכָּתוֹ, יִרְפָּא. \n  Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of the seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the bruise of His people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the basis of all of this, is there any evidence that this was intended / should be taken literally? Are there any Rishonim or Acharonim who take a stand about the pasuk, about kiddush levana, or about the midrash in Chulin/Bereishit Rabba and say that it is literal?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Inspired by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/29152/what-will-the-size-of-the-sun-be-when-moshiach-comes-and-what-will-be-its-purpos\">this question</a>, and giving much more in the way of sources, but phrased in a way that would not make it a duplicate.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bechaya (Bamidbar 28:15), mentioned <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16864/603\">in this answer</a> (<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/rabenobehayey/rabenobehayey13.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>'s a more clear printing of the text), does say the the moon was literally diminished.

    "content": "# Halachic Relevancy of 'Proving God'\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The first halacha in the Mishnah Torah states that you must know for certain that God exists (Yesodei Hatorah 1:1). Does this mean that according to Rambam, God can be proven to exist through philosophical and logical arguments? </p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, many of the classic philosophical arguments for God's existence (argument from design, ontological, cosmological) have either been disproven, or simply found not to be very convincing. That being said, is it still a value to discover and know God through science or philosophy? Or now that we live in a scientific age where most scientists and philosophers are flaming atheists, should we be relying on faith alone?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In my opinion, the arguments have not been disproven only that we do not understand the arguments. see the <a href=\"http://www.dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=398\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shaar yichud with commentaries</a> </p>\n\n<p>(i.e. we don't study the arguments in enough depth to understand them, therefore we mistakenly think they have been disproven. hence study with the commentaries, and even then if something doesn't make sense, ask wise Rabanim.)</p>\n\n<p>Rabeynu Bachya and the Rambam, etc. are writing to a generation steeped in philosophy therefore, they could present their proofs with minimal introductions. As this does not apply to us, commentaries are necessary.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in the answer by chanoch here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/5459/why-is-shaar-hayichud-of-chovos-halevavos-so-controversial\">Why is Sha'ar Ha'Yichud of Chovos Ha'Levavos so \"controversial\"?</a>\nit assumes Hawking disproved a premise of the shaar yichud, but if you read the commentaries in the shaar yichud, you will see his disproof was from a mathematical model, whereas the shaar yichud was talking about an \"actual infinity\", an infinity in the here and now physical world, not a mathematical model.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore (as a side point), remember science does not have a good track record of being reliable. it is constantly evolving slashing old premises when new ones are discovered but the words of our sages endure forever and ever. (Sefer Habris Maamar 5 ch.3) </p>\n\n<p>As spiritual phenomena is discovered, the entire paradigm of science will eventually collapse and be seen to be merely like a blind men grasping the tail of the elephant as the below quote explains</p>\n\n<p><em>Ramchal (Mevo L'Sefer Haklalim):</em></p>\n\n<p>The philosophers and scientists can grasp only the external surface of the world, namely, the physical world, according to what appears to their physical eyes. However, this is merely the outermost garment of the spiritual roots, namely, the sefiros who govern the world and are the innermost spirituality inside the physical... Just like the form of man alludes to the entire system of Divine governance, so too it is alluded from all the parts of nature, and every creation is an expression of one detail of His governance...</p>\n\n<p>And on this are based most of the sayings of the Sages which refer to the Creation and to all matters of the world, whether in heaven or on earth and all of their derivatives, this is also a broad and important subject.</p>\n\n<p>When our sages instruct us on matters of nature and of this world, they are referring to its inner aspect - not on its external garment. <strong>Therefore, sometimes in their words we find things which appear strange, and which appear to be clearly false from what we perceive with our senses. But the truth is that they are speaking according to the true governance which is hidden from human eyes, which they received from the prophets and from the holy torah...</strong></p>\n\n<p>(also keep in mind that G-d intentionally created the world in such a way that free will is possible, so there will always be loopholes to interpret the world according to the atheists, otherwise free will is over) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>God's mind IS the universe. Because we are IN Gods mind the only way to prove God is to CHOOSE to align our thoughts,speech and actions with HIS  by reading the human beings  manual (specifically ancient kabbalistic  interpretation of TORAH)  and doing mitzvot. In this way all our limbs, arteries, skin and flesh become Godly.You will never KNOW anything let alone God's existence until you become that thing or at the very least recognize that you have the CHOICE to do so.</p>\n\n\n",

However, other than Korach himself being from Levi, the rest of the co-conspiritors seemed to be mainly from Reuvain (see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9944/showrashi/true\" rel=\"nofollow\">16:1 and Rashi</a>). </p>\n\n<p>My question is why does Moshe refer to this group of people, of which there only seems to be one Levi, as  <strong>בְּנֵי</strong> לֵוִי?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Abarbanel on this pasuk learns that Moshe's statement of רַב לָכֶם בְּנֵי לֵוִי was in fact aimed at the minority of Levites who had assembled as part of Korach's congregation. Moshe was  hoping at the very least to have those Levites abandon the cause. He adduces further proof from the following pasuk where the plural term is used even though Moshe is ostensibly speaking to an individual</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּאמֶר מֹשֶׁה, אֶל-קֹרַח:  שִׁמְעוּ-נָא, בְּנֵי לֵוִי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moshe then continues to speak in the plural indicating that though he may have been talking to Korach his message was meant to be heard by others. From the context of the pesukim which follow it is clear he is speaking specifically to Levites.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are appears to be two separate rebellions, that of Korach and that of Datan and Aviram, which co-occurred. That congregation of Korach took the censers to challenge Aharon's status as kohen. The congregation of Datan and Aviram rebelled differently. And each congregation died differently. Further, it is feasible to separate out these two threads of conflict.</p>\n\n<p>It seems quite possible even according to Rashi on 16:1, there were many from <strong>both</strong> Reuven and Levi. And if so, the Levites followed Korach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The essence of their complaint is that they are bnei Levi, but don't have the privileges and duties of the kohanim. Moshe is chastising them based on their complaint. </p>\n\n\n",

If the rennet is derived from a non-Kosher animal, it is non-Kosher (making the cheese non-Kosher as well). From my understanding, the reason for this is the rule \"כל היוצא מטמא טמא\" - all that is derived from an unclean (animal) is also unclean. But, even rennet from a Kosher animal is not considered meat because of the process involved in extracting it. So, why the difference? Why does the rennet lose its \"meat properties\" but not its \"unclean properties\"?</li>\n<li>Suppose we understand the differences between the meat & unclean properties, what is the difference between rennet and gelatin made from non-Kosher animal bones? I read that the opinion of the Shulchan Aruch (99) is that (completely) dry bones of non-Kosher animals are considered Kosher, and so gelatin from those bones would also be considered Kosher. Why does the rule of \"כל היוצא מטמא טמא\" not apply here?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Your first question is a strong question which I have not found answered elsewhere on MY. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/29214/11501\">This other answer</a> to your question answers the second question but doesn't address the core issue of \"how can rennet be forbidden if coming from a non-kosher animal but permitted if coming from a kosher one - why does it lose its \"meat properties\" but not its \"unclean properties\"?\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary, the rennet from a non-kosher animal is prohibited because it is a <em>davar maamid</em> which is critical to the formation of the cheese and therefore never annuled. The rennet from a kosher animal is permitted because it doesn't give meat taste to the animal and is used in very small quantities.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>R Chaim Jachter explains (<a href=\"http://Chaim%20Jachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> under Stomach Lining of a Kosher Animal) that</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The rennet from a non-kosher animal is prohibited because it is a <em>davar maamid</em>, it gives texture to the cheese and is indispensable to create the cheese. Such ingredients are never annulled in larger quantities. This is seen in the Rambam <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/968259/jewish/Maachalot-Assurot-Chapter-3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MT Maachlot Assurot 3:13</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The stomach skin is a very small entity when compared to the milk that\n  it is used to solidify. Why is it not nullified because of its\n  insignificant size? Because it is used as the catalyst to cause the\n  cheese to curdle. Since the catalyst which causes it to curdle is\n  forbidden, everything is forbidden, as will be explained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The rennet from a kosher animal is permitted to be used if it doesn't give (meat) taste to the cheese (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/968265/jewish/Maachalot-Assurot-Chapter-9.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MT Maachlot Assurot 9:16</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is forbidden to place the skin of a kosher animal's stomach [in\n  milk] to serve as a catalyst for it to harden into cheese. If one used\n  it as a catalyst, [a gentile] should taste the cheese. If it has a\n  taste of meat, it is forbidden. If not, it is permitted. [The\n  rationale is that] the catalyst is itself a permitted entity, for it\n  comes from the stomach of a kosher animal. [The only question] is\n  [whether] the prohibition against meat and milk [was violated] and\n  that is dependent on whether the flavor was imparted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the logical question at this stage is why do we not say that it is forbidden to annul a substance voluntarily (<em>ein mevatlin issur lechatchilah</em>). R Jachter offers two solutions to this</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Akiva Eiger (Teshuvot number 207, cited in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.87.10?lang=bi&p2=Pithei_Teshuva_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.87.19&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pitchei Teshuva\n  87:19</a>) explains that the prohibition of Ein M’vatlin Issur\n  L’chatchilah does not apply if two lenient factors are in effect - the\n  use of completely desiccated stomach linings and the fact that the\n  stomach linings are nullified because they are less than sixty times\n  the milk that it is placed in</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Aruch Hashulchan (Y.D. 87:43) records the common practice to\n  produce cheese with completely desiccated stomach linings mixed\n  together with other items.  When the stomach lining is mixed together\n  with other items to effect the curdling process, we may be lenient\n  because this is a situation of “Zeh Vizeh Goreim,” an item that was\n  created by two factors, one permissible and one forbidden, where we\n  may disregard the permitted item if the permitted item could have\n  accomplished the task even without aid of the forbidden item (see Rama\n  Y.D. 87:11 and Shach Y.D. 87:35)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the Shulhan 'Aruch (Y\"D 87:9-11) and the RaM\"A (ibid), liquid milk found in the stomach of a Kosher animal (Kosher for this purpose means <em>all</em> of the following: \"clean\" species <em>and</em> properly slaughtered <em>and</em> without invalidating blemishes which would make it a Treifah), that is either salted with the stomach or left standing in the stomach for 24 hours, is prohibited to be used for making cheese, as it has absorbed taste from the meat of the stomach and is therefore considered Basar BeHalav (forbidden combination of meat and milk). According to the RaM\"A (as explained by the Sha\"Ch, ad loc. note 31), if the milk in the stomach has dried out it is not prohibited.  The RaM\"A writes further that if the stomach itself has been salted and totally dried to the point that it is like wood, it is considered to have lost its properties of meat and can be used to store milk.</p>\n\n<p>With respect to rennet, which has properties of meat, since it is a catalyst for the cheesemaking process, it is not like other foods, and if it is from a non-Kosher animal, it is never nullified in the milk  even in proportions of 1 part in 1,000 (note that if it is made with rennet from a Kosher animal, it still needs to become nullified to the milk; if the resultant cheese has some taste of meat, it is prohibited as meat and milk).</p>\n\n<p>Permitting of dried bones, on the other hand, relies on a different principle altogether, which is that once they are dried out they no longer are considered to be food (this is possibly related to what was said above about the dried stomach, but the law is codified elsewhere: Y\"D 99:1). (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/16762/5\">this question</a> as associated answers for more on this issue).  Note, however, that there is a dispute about permitting dried bones that have been reconstituted into something edible.</p>\n\n\n",

Eliezer Landau’s Damesek Eliezer (Vilna, 1868) on the Biur ha-Gra on Orach Chayyim, the author explains that the purpose of his work is to increase the study of the Biur ha-Gra, which “until now is like a sealed book, which almost no one seeks”: אך חפצי כי יתרבו הלומדים ביאורי הגר\"א אשר עד כה הוא כספר החתום, כמעט אין דורש אותו. R. Abraham Isaac Kook, who saw the Gra as a model for his project of unifying the halakhah with its sources, also recognized that the Biur ha-Gra was hardly used because of its terseness: \"כבר אמרתי שהשימוש בביאורי הגר״א בחוג הלומדים הוא כ״כ ממועט מפני קיצורו הגדול\"  (Hartza’at ha-Rav, Jerusalem, 1920, p. 14). His own commentary, Be’er Eliyahu (first published in Sefer ha-Gra, Jerusalem 1954), covers only the Biur ha-Gra on the first section of Choshen Mishpat. The commentary Birkat Eliyahu, which R. Barukh Rakover began publishing in 1968 under R. Kook’s inspiration, now contains twenty seven volumes, but is still missing the entire Yoreh De’ah section of Shulchan Arukh.\nThe four-volume work שלמת אליהו is a commentary on parts of Yoreh De'ah, but also remains incomplete. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>--Birkas Eliyahu (ברכת אליהו) is a multi-volume work on Biur HaGra which is available for free on hebrewbooks.org</p>\n\n<p>--there is also damesek eliezer דמשק אליעזר which is a commentary to the biur hagra.</p>\n\n<p>-- there is also a commentary to biur hagra written by a Rosh Kollel in Landers College, but I don't remember his name or the name of his sefer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Yes.

    "content": "# Elisha, the children, and the bears: what is really going on here?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>After Eliyahu goes up to heaven, Elisha solves a water problem in Jericho and then heads to Bethel.  On the way, some young children accost him, he curses them in the name of God, and two she-bears eat 42 of them (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15908&showrashi=true#v23\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Melachim 2 2:23-24</a>):</p>\n\n<p>Rashi's comment on this is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>and some little boys: Heb. וּנְעָרִים, people empty [of any observance of commandments]. </p>\n  \n  <p>Go away, baldy: Go away from here, for you have made the place bald for us, for until now we would hire ourselves out to bring sweet water from a distance, and we would earn our livelihood thereby. And when the water became sweet, they lost their livelihood. Thus it is explained in Sotah (46b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even if Rashi's interpretation is correct, do people empty of observance (particularly children), whose proximate transgression is being mad about an economic matter, warrant being cursed and eaten by bears?  I feel like there must be more going on here that I just don't understand.</p>\n\n<p>What did the children do wrong?  (Were they really children)?  Did Elisha act properly in cursing them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Bavli <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=46b&format=text\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sotah 46b</a>-47a describes this incident in more detail.  R. Yochanan said in the name of Meir that whoever does not escort others or allow himself to be escorted, it as if he shed blood, for if the men of Jericho had escorted Elisha, he would not have stirred up the bears.  The g'mara then goes on to explain the incident.</p>\n\n<p>First, who are the \"little children\"?  The g'mara notes that \"little\" is redundant with <em>na'arim</em> and offers several possibilities: they were bare of precepts; they were little of faith; they were youths but they behaved like little children; perhaps they were from a place call Na'arah.</p>\n\n<p>The g'mara also offers several opinions about what Elisha saw when he looked at them (a sage's gaze has special powers): that they were conceived on Yom Kippur; that they imitated Amorite customs/manners; that there was no sap of the commandments in them or in their future descendants.</p>\n\n<p>All of that seems to suggest that, while the incident is regretable (if he'd been accompanied it wouldn't have happened), they in some sense had it coming.  But then R. Hanina says that, on account of the 42 sacrifices Balak offered, 42 children were cut off from Israel, which makes it sound like they shouldn't have been killed (it was only because of Balak that they were).  Further, Chazal taught that Elisha was afflicted with three illnesses, one of which was because he stirred up the bears, which also seems to be a condemnation of the event.</p>\n\n<p>So my reading of this source, at least, is that the \"children\", who were probably some flavor of miscreants, taunted Elisha as Rashi described, and Elisha, with no one to help stay his hand and with the benefit of some special vision, over-reacted (and was later afflicted in punishment).  They weren't exactly innocent, but their deeds didn't merit this death either.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to @gt6989b for pointing me in this direction.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Steipler Gaon z.ts.l. has a lengthy explanation in his Krayne De'igrese on this episode. It is in Volume I Chapter 47. I will try and translate it and post it later</p>\n<p>My sincere apologies that I didn't do it. I totally forgot about it. Thank you for reminding me. I haven't got the time to sit down and make a literal translation, but I'll post what I wrote some years ago.</p>\n<p>The שטייפלר גאון זצ\"ל (קריינא דאגרתא ח\"א סימן מז) explains that first of all אלישע of course never killed them out of revenge. However, in his task as a נביא he was to be the מחנך, the שליח of הקב\"ה, who had to teach the generation the right השקפה. These people, who had lost their פרנסה, thought that פרנסה depends on their abilities, thinking כֹּחִי וְעֹצֶם יָדִי עָשָׂה לִי אֶת-הַחַיִל הַזֶּה, that their income only depended on their supply of fresh water, which had now disappeared. And that is why they were called people of little אמונה, or even more \"small children\", because just as a little child thinks that all his food etc. comes from his mother, he thinks his very life depends on her alone and she, only she, can supply him with his needs, so did they think that their previous job was the only way how they could have an income, not realising that ד' has many ways how to provide for a person, if only he trusts in ד'. When these people mocked the נביא, which is equal to mocking ד' himself ח\"ו, אלישע saw a great danger that this idea of לית דין ולית דיין would take root if he didn't take a firm stand. (Don't forget that this was a period of ע\"ז worship). That is why he cursed them, leaving the way of their punishment over to ד'. Nevertheless, we find that אלישע was punished for this by becoming ill soon after that, perhaps because he should not have been such a קנאי [after all even by אליהו we saw that ד' wasn't pleased with his קנאות and according to some explanations, the chariot of fire which seperated אליהו and אלישע was just for this purpose, to tell אלישע not to take on that דרך] and he should rather have spoken with them and teach them the right attitude.</p>\n<p>In order to teach that although פרנסה seems like טבע it really is a נס like any other טבע is really a נס, the punishment was meted out in a way that it was clearly a נס and nevertheless it was\"dressed up\" like טבע. The death-sentence, which could have been meted out in so many ordinary ways, happened by two bears who had never been there before (נס) but they came out of a forest (טבע); and even if you say that that forest was in itself a נס, but it was put there, so as to give a natural (טבע) appearance to the נס, which is basically the very essence of פרנסה.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Thanks for your time in translating and posting the Steipler zlls insights.

Do we also count from Tuesday? I don't have any particular reason to think this should be any different than the bris, though I don't know so I'm asking.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See Yoreh Deah 305:11. The Shach says to make a pidyon haben only after a lunar month has passed (average lunar month is 29.5 days + 44 minutes).  The Magen Avraham in contrast says to make a pidyon haben on the 31st day.  The Aruch Hashulchan explains that the Magen Avraham's opinion is a leniency, allowing the pidyon haben to be done even at a time before the full lunar month of 29.5 days + 44 minutes has passed, not a stringency requiring we wait even beyond the passing of a full lunar month.  Thus, the time to do the pidyon haben would be on the suffik 30/31st day, but it must be late enough in the day so that at least 29.5 days and 44 minutes have passed since the time of the birth.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When we have a doubt regarding a biblical command, we take a stringent approach. This is known as ספק דאורייתא לחומרה.</p>\n\n<p>When we are obligated to do something at a set time, and especially when that time is dependent on another phenomenon or event, it is imperative that we know when the appropriate time is. This is why two days of Yom Tov were established outside of the range to which the court in Jerusalem could send messengers notifying the public of the new moon each month.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of these particular commandments, Millah and Pidyon HaBen, there is an added dimension, which is the tension between the urgency of the Mitzvah, which would incline one towards early action, and the potential problem of acting <em>too</em> early and thus not fulfilling it at all, since the set time hasn't arrived yet.  Thus there is a question of <em>how</em> to be stringent - do you lean \"early\" so you don't miss a day to perform the Mitzvah (Millah carries <a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2010/04/what-is-kares.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kareth</a> if left unfulfilled; Pidyon HaBen does not, but it is mandated at a set time, and by pushing it off a day you miss that time), or do you lean \"late\" out of a fear that doing it too early is not valid at all? Which option is considered לחומרה?</p>\n\n<p>In short, we do not allow premature Berith Millah, as it may be invalid. (I believe there is some debate about this, but this is how we hold.)  The same concern exists for Pidyon HaBen.  What is <em>not</em> a shared concern between Millah and Pidyon HaBen is the severity of delaying the Mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/5179/5\">Apparently</a>, in some limited circumstances, unlike Millah, Pidyon <em>could</em>, in theory, be done on one day without a Berachah (possibly 'Al Tenai), and then again on a different day (possibly with a Berachah if the first had been 'Al Tenai).  Physically, it would be impossible for Berith Millah to be done twice, obviously.  However, this is mentioned as a possible solution where there is no proper Kohen available, not where timing is an issue.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there is a debate among Posekim as to how we calculate the timing, and the practice of performing the Mitzvah on the 31st day is a way to ensure that it is not done prematurely according to any opinion.  In essence, we are already in a situation of ספק דאורייתא, due to this dispute, and we hold that חומרה, in this case, means delaying it by a day to be sure.</p>\n\n<p>I have not seen a direct answer in a Teshuvah about this, but all the Halachic calculus leads me to the conclusion that we would delay the Pidyon HaBen until the Safek Day 31/32.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Did God destroy Amalek in King David's time, like Rashi seems to say?",
    "content": "# Did God destroy Amalek in King David's time, like Rashi seems to say?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've always understood that the war with Amalek is an ongoing concern (and that the mitzvah to blot out Amalek's memory is ongoing), but I saw some puzzling Rashi today that seems to contradict that.  This probably means I'm misunderstanding Rashi, so I'm looking for help.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16230\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tehillim 9</a> says in part:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>4 When my enemies draw backward, they stumble and are destroyed from before You.<br>\n  5 For You have performed my judgment and my cause; You sat on the throne, O Judge of righteousness.<br>\n  6 You rebuked nations, You destroyed a wicked man; <strong>You erased their name forever and ever</strong>.<br>\n  7 The enemy has been destroyed; swords exist forever, and You have uprooted the cities-their remembrance is lost.<br>\n  8 But the Lord shall sit forever; He has established His throne for judgment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16230&showrashi=true#v6\" rel=\"nofollow\">says</a>, on 6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>You rebuked nations:</strong> [This alludes to Amalek, described in Num. 24:20 as] “Amalek is the first of the nations.”<br>\n  <strong>You destroyed a wicked man:</strong> Esau.<br>\n  <strong>You erased their name:</strong> “For I will surely erase the remembrance of Amalek” (Exod. 17:14).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it sounds like Rashi is saying that God \"erased\" Amalek at this time (after rebuking them), which is not what I would have thought.  (All these verbs are in the past tense.)  To further reinforce this, consider Sh'mot 17:16:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>16 And he said, For there is a hand on the throne of the Eternal, [that there shall be] a war for the Lord against Amalek from generation to generation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi says nothing at all here about the war \"from generation to generation\", which to my perhaps-naive eye sounds an awful lot like \"forever\".  But he does <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9878&showrashi=true#v16\" rel=\"nofollow\">comment there</a>, tying this throne image to the destruction of Amalek in Tehillim 9:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>For there is a hand on the throne of the Eternal:</strong> Heb. כִּי-יָד עַל כֵּס יָ-הּ. The hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, was raised to swear by His throne, to have a war and [bear] hatred against Amalek for eternity. Now what is the meaning of כֵּס [as opposed to כִּסֵא and also [why is] the Divine Name divided in half? [I.e., why is the Name יָ-הּ used instead of י-ה-ו-ה ?] [The answer is that] <strong>the Holy One, blessed be He, swore that His Name will not be complete and His throne will not be complete until the name of Amalek is completely obliterated</strong>. And when his name is obliterated, the Divine Name will be complete, and the throne will be complete, as it is said: “The enemy has been destroyed; swords exist forever (לָנֶצַח)” (Ps. 9:7); this [who they are referring to] is Amalek, about whom it is written: “and kept their fury forever (נֶצַח)” (Amos 1:11). \"And You have uprooted the cities-their remembrance is lost\" (Ps. 9:7) [i.e., Amalek’s obliteration]. What does it say afterwards? “And the Lord (וַיהוה) shall sit forever” (Ps. 9:8); <strong>thus [after Amalek is obliterated] the Name is complete</strong>. \"He has established His throne (כִּסְאוֹ) for judgment\" (Ps. 9:8). <strong>Thus the throne is complete</strong> [i.e., thus the throne, here spelled with an “aleph,” is now complete]. — [from Midrash Tanchuma, end of Ki Theitzei] </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So my question is:</strong> what's Rashi really saying here?  Is he really saying that God obliterated Amalek at the time of the psalm?  If so, how does he reconcile that with (a) the mitzvah for us to wipe out Amalek's memory and (b) the common understanding that Haman, centuries later, was an Amalekite (to say nothing of others for whom similar claims have been made throughout the centuries)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em> notes to verse 1 that he interprets this psalm as about <em>Amalek</em> <strong>in the future</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And I say: \"למנצח עלמות לבן\", this song is about the future, when the youth and earliness of Israel will be brightened, their righteousness revealed, and their redemption brought, when <em>Esav</em> and his progeny are erased, as per our Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is not uncommon to find, in Psalms, past-tense sentences that the commentaries say refer to the future.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While I haven't seen it spelled out per say, presumably because the mitzvah still has a very real relevance, it seems clear from the sources that while it wasn't preformed in the \"lechatchila\"/optimal manner the mitzvah in its primary manifestation was fulfilled by Shaul (or more correctly Shmuel):  </p>\n\n<p>From the Gemara in Sanhedrin(20b, see also Rashi) we see the mitzvah of cutting off Amelek was a prerequisite for the building of the Temple:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סנהדרין כ:ב תניא רבי יוסי אומר שלש מצות נצטוו ישראל בכניסתן לארץ\n  להעמיד להם מלך ולהכרית זרעו של עמלק ולבנות להם בית הבחירה ואיני יודע\n  איזה מהן תחילה כשהוא אומר כי יד על כס יה מלחמה לה' בעמלק הוי אומר\n  להעמיד להם מלך תחילה ואין כסא אלא מלך שנאמר וישב שלמה על כסא ה' למלך\n  ועדיין איני יודע אם לבנות להם בית הבחירה תחלה או להכרית זרעו של עמלק\n  תחילה כשהוא אומר והניח לכם מכל אויביכם וגו' והיה המקום אשר יבחר ה'\n  וגו' הוי אומר להכרית זרעו של עמלק תחילה וכן בדוד הוא אומר ויהי כי ישב\n  המלך דוד בביתו וה' הניח לו מסביב  וכתיב ויאמר המלך אל נתן הנביא ראה נא\n  אנכי יושב בבית ארזים וגו'</p>\n  \n  <p>“It has been taught: R. Jose said: Three commandments were given to\n  Israel when they entered the land; [i] to appoint a king; [ii] to cut\n  off the seed of Amalek; [iii] and to build themselves the chosen house\n  and I do not know which of them has priority.  But, when it is said:\n  The hand upon the throne of the Lord, the Lord will have war with\n  Amalek from generation to generation ,(Exodus 17:16) we must infer\n  that they had first to set up a king, for ‘throne’ implies a king, as\n  it is written, Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king (1\n  Chron. 29:23). Yet I still do not know which [of the other two] comes\n  first, the building of the chosen Temple or the cutting off of the\n  seed of Amalek. Hence when it is written, And when He giveth you rest\n  from all your enemies round about etc., and then, Then it shall come\n  to pass that the place which the Lord your God shall choose, (Deut.\n  12:10) it is to be inferred that the extermination of Amalek is first.\n  And so it is written of David, And  it came to pass when the king\n  dwelt in his house, and the Lord had given him rest from his enemies\n  round about,  and the passage continues; that the king said unto\n  Nathan the Prophet: See now, I dwell in a house of cedars etc.\n  [Soncino]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which is brought down as halachah in the Mishneh Torah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משנה תורה: הלכות מלכים ומלחמותיהם א:ב מנוי מלך קדם למלחמת עמלק, שנאמר:\n  \"אתי שלח ה' למשחך למלך עתה לך והכיתה את עמלק\". והכרתת זרע עמלק קודמת\n  לבנין הבית, שנאמר: \"ויהי כי ישב המלך בביתו וה' הניח לו מסביב מכל\n  איביו. ויאמר אל נתן הנביא, אנכי יושב בבית ארזים וגו'\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The appointment of a king should precede the war against Amalek. [This\n  is evident from Samuel’s charge to King Saul] (I Samuel 15:1-3): “God\n  sent me to anoint you as king . . . Now, go and smite Amalek.”\n  Amalek’s seed should be annihilated before the construction of the\n  Temple, as [II Samuel 7:1-2] states: “And it came to pass, when the\n  king dwelled in his palace, and God gave him peace from all enemies\n  who surrounded him, the king said to Nathan, the prophet: Look! I am\n  dwelling in a house of cedar, . . . [but the ark of God dwells within\n  curtains]. [Moznaim]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems consistent with the <em>peshuto shel mikra</em> (plain meaning) of 1 Samuel 15 where it is related that King Saul destroyed the nation of Amalek, only sparing King Agag and animals (although he was not supposed to spare either). King Agag, however, was executed by Shmuel after he rebuked Saul for his disobedience. That this commandment found its historical fulfillment doesn't detract from its status as a commandment. Yet it seems to me that although Amalek was destroyed in a literal sense, a prerequisite for building the Temple as we have seen, by failing to do so as commanded Saul allowed the [\"disembodied\"] spirit of Amalek to live on.  It is in this sense that we find the primary significance of Haman's descent from Amalek regardless of how literal we should take the midrashim about Agag siring offspring during his brief period in custody.  Haman is called Agagi, not Amalaki, he carries on the \"spirit\" and \"mission\" of Amalek not as Amalek strictly defined but because the Bnei Yisrael failed to preform the mitzvah as commanded even though the end result was equivalent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Towards the end of Shmuel Aleph, פרק ל, the Navi describes a battle that took place between Dovid, who was not yet King, and Amalek. Amalek raids Dovid's camp and takes their women and children. Dovid chases after them and ends up killing them all, except 400 young Amalekite men who escape:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּכֵּם דָּוִד מֵהַנֶּשֶׁף וְעַד־הָעֶרֶב לְמָחֳרָתָם וְלֹא־נִמְלַט מֵהֶם אִישׁ כִּי אִם־אַרְבַּע מֵאוֹת אִישׁ־נַעַר אֲשֶׁר־רָכְבוּ עַל־הַגְּמַלִּים וַיָּנֻסוּ\n\"And Dovid struck them from dawn until the evening of the next day. No man survived except 400 young men who rode away on camels and escaped.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was nearly the end of Amalek. And they were finally wiped out as a nation in the days of Chizkiyahu. As it states in Divrei Hayamim Aleph 4:42-43, 500 men from Shimon travelled to Har Seir and destroyed the last remaining Amalekites.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויכו את־שארית הפלטה לעמלק וישבו שם עד היום הזה\n\"And they struck the remaining surving Amalekites and they (the bnei Shimon) dwelled there until this day.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think it is likely that Tehilim 9 (according to Rashi) is referring to Dovid's defeat of Amalek. From that point onward Amalek was finished as a nation and that is what Dovid is celebrating, the destruction of the ראשית גוים.</p>\n<p>Then in the days of Chizkiyahu, Amalek ceased to even be a recognizable group. But this doesn't mean that there weren't individual Amalekites that escaped before their destruction.  Haman was a descendant of one of those Amalekites.</p>\n\n\n",

Two answers are given:</p>\n\n<p>1) Rav Yoshiya: Since it is unspecified, it must be the easiest (קל) of deaths. (The Bavli explains this means the easiest of the four deaths known through tradition, following the opinion of the Sages (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%96_%D7%90\">Mishna Sanhedrin 7:1</a>) that strangulation is the easiest of the court imposed death penalties.)</p>\n\n<p>2a) Rav Yonatan (Yerushalmi): Though we can't give him one of the stricter death penalties, because it is unspecified, we will still give him the stricter of the easier death penalties. (Rav Yonatan must hold like the opinion of Rav Shimon (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%96_%D7%90\">Mishna Sanhedrin 7:1</a>) that strangulation is more strict than beheading.) (This version of Rav Yonatan is possibly based on a scribal error; see Mareh haPanim and compare to the version in the Bavli below.)</p>\n\n<p>2b) Rav Yonatan (Bavli): Any unspecified death must be strangulation. Rebbi Yehuda haNassi elaborates: unspecified death is used for heaven-imposed punishments (ex. <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0138.htm#7\">Gen 38</a>) and for court-imposed punishments. Just as heaven-imposed punishments do not leave a mark on the body, so too the court-imposed punishment must be imposed in such a way as to not leave a mark on the body. This is strangulation.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e114.htm#1\">Hilchot Sanhedrin etc. 14:1</a>) lists the identity of strangulation as \"learned from the mouth of Moses\", ie. a tradition.</p>\n\n\n",

There it found water and stopped to drink. When Moshe approached the lamb, he said: \"I did not know that you ran away because you were thirsty. Now you must be tired.\" So he put the lamb on his shoulder and walked back with it. The Holy One then said: because you showed such compassion tending the flock of another person, as you live, you shall become the shepherd of Israel, the flock that is Mine. Thus it is written: \"Now Moshe was tending the flock. . . \" (Midrash Shmot Rabbah, 2:2; adapted from Braude translation.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, even from birth it was recognized the Moshe was special, see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9863/jewish/Chapter-2.htm/showrashi/true#v2\">Rashi on Shemot 2:2</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>that he was good: When he was born, the entire house was filled with light.

She notes that, leading up to Moshe's prophecy at the bush, there are three progressive stories recorded about him. </p>\n\n<p>The first is the story of him seeing an Egyptian oppressing a Hebrew, in which he kills the Egyptian. This demonstrates how strongly he felt about saving the oppressed, but one might think that he only got involved because he was defending a member of his own people against the enemy. Next, however, we see him getting involved in a fight between two Hebrew men, showing that Moshe was a man who wanted to stop fights even within his people. Finally, we find that after he runs away, he defends the daughters if Yisro from the shepherds. Despite the fact that these women were perfect strangers, Moshe's sense of injustice was so strong that he was ready to assist anyone who needed help, no matter who they were. </p>\n\n<p>The midrash (Shemos Rabbah 2:2) picks up on this trend, by developing it a step further: Moshe was tending to Yisro's sheep, and was willing to help even a single lamb get to the sustenance that it needed. The point that the midrash is bringing out relates to this portrayal of Moshe as a defender of the weak and righter of injustices, a man who deserves to lead a people. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I heard a drashaonce from Rav Elya Brudny regarding what Moshe did special that he was chosen to lead the nation. He said Moshe's ability to notice the fact that the bush was burning but was not consumed is what got him appointed. Anyone else would have seen a bush burning, glanced only momentarily, and assumed it was being consumed. Moshe was the type of person who would pay attention and see what was actually happening. This was a person worthy of leading and caring for the nation. Someone who would take note if something looked different than previously and deserved a closer inspection, instead of just relying on their own presuppositions. </p>\n\n<p>From your closing paragraph it seems that you believe his being predestined is in contradistinction to having earned it. I would like to address that point.\nMoshe Rabbeinu wore many hats. Savior and redeemer. The one who accepted and presented the Torah. King and leader of the people for forty years in the desert. He was also a Kohein and Levy. Its possible he was predestined for any one or more of those while his appointment to any one or more was earned. We do find he lost the kehuna as Rashi brings in Shmos 4 14.</p>\n\n\n",

But as we will say <strong>the halacha doesn't necessarily consider all body piercings forbidden</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As context, plastic surgery (a more extreme form of bodily injury for beauty) is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/67373/plastic-surgery/67390#67390\">generally forbidden except</a> when it serves to reduce pain or suffering coming from a bodily deformation. The reason is that the Torah prohibits wounding another person (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.25.3?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 25:3</a>) and the Gemara (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.91a?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">end of Bava Kama 91a</a>) states that this prohibition applies even to wounding oneself. The broader background is that the Torah doesn't consider a person's body to be his to do what he wants with it. It is an instrument in the service of God.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam writes that this prohibition applies when it is performed in a painful and degrading manner. <strong>R Moshe Feinstein</strong> (Choshen Mishpat 2:66) infers from the Rambam that if the wounding is done in a beneficial manner the prohibition of chavalah (to others or oneself) does not apply. An individual may wound himself if it is done for his benefit and with his consent. As such RMF allows plastic surgery for beautification to find a husband.</p>\n\n<p>Addressing the same question of a girl performing cosmetic surgery to facilitate finding a husband, <strong><a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=27595\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R Breisch</a></strong> allows it for another reason based on Tosfot (Shabbat 50b, sv <em>Bishvil</em>) allowing removing scabs from a body because of psychological pain (“If the only pain that he suffers is that he is embarrassed to walk among people then it is permissible, because there is no greater pain than this.”)</p>\n\n<p><strong>R Yitzchok Yaakov Weiss</strong> (an important posek in matters of medical halacha) agrees that the prohibition against wounding oneself is only relevant if it is done in a destructive or disrespectful manner (Minchat Yitzchak 6:105).  <strong>Since body piercings do not involve physical dangers nor are they destructive or disrespectful, it would appear that this interdiction also doesn't apply.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The above provide the halachic justification for earrings.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the poskim who rule against cosmetic surgery (e.g., <strong>R Eliezer Waldenberg</strong>, the <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em>), do it on the basis of the danger involved and the interdiction to place oneself in danger. But perhaps even he would allow pierced ears as there are several opinions that say the prohibition of self wounding does not apply when there is no bleeding.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Body piercings are somewhat more complicated than earrings and depend on the reasons motivating the piercing.</strong> Doing it for beauty is allowed. Imitating the non-Jewish world is not because of the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/535/what-makes-something-chukat-goyim\">prohibition of hukot hagoyim</a> (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.178?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SA YD 178</a>), and, depending of the piercing's erotic appeal, the commandment to be holy (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.2?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayikra 19:2</a>) and the notion of <em>Tzelem Elokim</em> (man being in the image of God).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>PS. The fact that Rivka was possibly wearing a nose ring doesn't necessarily mean this is allowed or disallowed. The topic of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4078/avot-keeping-mitzvot\">our patriarchs observing all of Torah</a> is not taken literally by many commentators and cannot be used to decide halacha.</p>\n\n<p>PPS. The above is limited to women (as per the original question). The issue of men piercings is different since we men are forbidden to act in the way of women (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.182.1?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SA YD 182:1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.182.1-5?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">182:5</a>), so it would be forbidden in a society where only women typically wear piercings,  although <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=21\" rel=\"noreferrer\">there might be possible allowances if the wound is not permanent</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See R Jachter <a href=\"http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/14-17%20Cosmetic%20Surgery%20-%20A%20Review%20of%20Four%20Classic%20Teshuvot%201.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for the sources on plastic surgery used above and more <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/67373/plastic-surgery/67390#67390\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.webyeshiva.org/body-piercing-in-judaism-by-rabbi-joshua-ross/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Commentary/piercing.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">there</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Read Igros Moshe Choshen Mishpat 2:65 and 66 who discusses elective surgery and difference between destructive wounds and unharmful wounds.The tshuvah is very lengthy and goes through the gemara,Tosfos and Rambam.

Surely, it cannot mean that the water has to be so hot that one gets burned because of it.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Eshel Avraham from Buchach (OC 260:1) makes almost exactly the points that you do in Q1.  Here are 2 separate quotes from him that although unrelated, both apply:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נראה שאין גם מצוה מן המובחר לרחוץ כל גופו בחמין דוקא כל שרוחץ כל גופו... ...בצונן, וכן הוא מנהג כל עם בני ישראל</p>\n  \n  <p>...כי עיקר הרחיצה היא משום תענוג, ולא כשהוא ענוי לו...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding Q2, see Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa (old version 14:1:fn3) where this is discussed regarding what is considered hot water for washing on Shabbos itself, but certainly applies to our case (See the Biur Halacha inside, he brings a proof from this case).  As usual, it is a Machlokes Haposkim, but the תהל\"ד (תהליה לדוד) סימן שכו makes the point that obviously it is not referring to Yad Soledes Bo water, and suggests that if you can feel any heat it would qualify, although others disagree. Shemiras Shabbos concludes that according to Acharonim it is less than Yad Soledes, but does not give a precise definition. (See also Aruch Hashulchan, Dirshu Mishna Berura, and Piskei Teshuvos to the beginning of OC 326, where they bring a large number of sources that discuss the definition of \"hot water\" for Rechitza Beshabbos.)</p>\n\n<p>Note that in both cases, I cannot prove that the Biur Halacha agrees, but I can provide other approaches within the corpus of accepted Poskim.</p>\n\n\n",

Those who assume that he has existed, and that the book is historical, are unable to determine when and where Job lived. Some of our Sages say that he lived in the days of the Patriarchs; others hold that he was a contemporary of Moses; others place him in the days of David, and again others believe that he was one of those who returned from the Babylonian exile. This difference of opinion supports the assumption that he has never existed in reality.

In speaking about how important 'toil' in learning is (rather than rote learning) he brings a Radak on Hosea (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1313.htm#8\" rel=\"nofollow\">13:8</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.אֶפְגְּשֵׁם כְּדֹב שַׁכּוּל, וְאֶקְרַע סְגוֹר לִבָּם; וְאֹכְלֵם שָׁם כְּלָבִיא, חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה תְּבַקְּעֵם‏<br>\n  <strong>I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps</strong>, and will rend the enclosure of their heart; and there will I devour them like a lioness; the wild beast shall tear them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Radak asks why Hashem's anger is compared to a bear rather than a lion, the 'king of beasts'. He says that a bear's offspring is born with a very thick amniotic sack and it takes much care, toil and difficulty to bring it in to this world; more so than any other animal. So much so, that when a bear loses a cub it experiences greater anguish and loss. He finishes off by linking this to Torah in a parallel way: that only things that require hard/devoted labour reaps reward.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn't link naming a person Dov/Ber but is a relevant insight into the virtue of a bear, at least according to the Radak.

Beider's theory is that it is a hypocorism for Bernhard.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>German Jews borrowed both the non-compound form Ber(o) and the version Berman (<em>bear</em> + <em>man</em>).  This borrowing is likely due to (1) the attractive meaning of this name (bear implies force, endurance, virility); (2) the popular use of these names by Gentiles.... [The great popularity of the name Ber] is explained by its attractive meaning... cf. Leyb, Hirsh, and Volf, other male names connected to animals. The popularity of Ber also contributed to the creation of the new Hebrew appellation, Dov, the Hebrew calque of Ber.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

While that's probably true of many other statements or conversations in the Torah that the words in the Torah are actually a translation (such as when Yosef speaks to his brothers before revealing himself, which the Torah attests was done through a translator), perhaps Parshas Bilaam was singled out because it was an entire parsha written in such a way. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Parashath Bilaam is written with stories that Mosha Rabbeinu never experienced, for example the story with the donkey, no one was there but the donkey bilaam and the maloch. Also the sacrifices and such is from the perspective of bilaam and not Mosha Rabbeinu.

Therefore, Chazal wanted to refute this and said that Moshe Rabbeinu wrote this as well and it is indeed part of the Torah. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is the Shulchan Aruch definitive?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why do we (almost all Jews) consider the <em>Shulchan Arukh</em>, not written until the 16th century, to be the final word on halakha?</p>\n\n<p>Our halakha is derived from Torah Shebikhtav and She'be'al Peh. SA attempts to summarize those, and others summarize SA, interacting with it in the same way that it interacts with Torah, assuming that halakha from SA is correct interpretation. What is special about the SA compared to other compilations of Law?</p>\n\n<p>Will we always follow the SA, or will some other volume eventually replace it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch came about, because its author, Rav Yosef Karo, declared that the era of the Rishonim has ended, and one can no longer make halachic decisions based on one's interpretations of the Gemara, but rather on the basis of the interpretations and rulings of the Rishonim (the Halachic authorities of the several hundred years before his time). \nThus, Rav Yosef Karo developed a system of compiling the different opinions of the Rishonim, and of how to rule in cases of disputes between them. While his specific guidelines of how to rule in cases of disagreements amongst the Rishonim, as well as many of his rulings, were highly disputed by the Remma and later commentaries of the Shulchan Aruch, the basic idea that we should analyze the different opinions in the Rishonim and strive to reach an halachic ruling on that basis, was accepted. \nThus when we say the Shulchan Aruch was accepted, we mean the Shulchan Aruch with all of its commentaries was accepted. This is because it is the basic premise of the Shulchan Aruch that was accepted and the many Halachic works surrounding it, and not necessarily all the specific rulings in the Shulchan Aruch. \nThus, even though Halachic works continue to be published, even as separate books and not as commentaries to the Shulchan Aruch, they are all based on the Shulchan Aruch and its commentaries, which in turn are based on the Rishonim, which in turn are based on Chazal. </p>\n\n\n",

This is because God does not arrange for him to see or hear of any badness. And therefore if you perceive that some individual is doing bad, or if you are told of some person doing bad, you need to know clearly that you have in you some speck of that particular badness itself. And even if you are a saint, even so, you have in you some fraction of a fraction of that thing, and God has summoned this perception or tale so that you notice that blemish in yourself and restore yourself and fix it. (Through doing that, the other person you first perceived is also fixed, because he is dependent on you.) And therefore you should not speak negatively about your fellow even if you saw him committing a transgression, or heard from a trustworthy source that he committed a transgression, because the fact of your perceiving or hearing this indicates the probability that you have in you something of that transgression and it is your duty to fix that thing within you (and through that to fix the other person too).</p>\n<p>In Heikhal HaBrakhah, parshat Shlah, chapter 15 verse 32, (link to <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22167&st=&pgnum=212\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">page</a> in hebrewbooks), quoted in footnote 108 to the passage above in Ba'al Shem Tov al HaTorah:</p>\n<p>כידוע שפעם אחד ראה אחד מהמוני עם שחילל שבת, והיה מתאנח מאוד על זה באיזה ענין חילל הוא שבת שיראה זה מחלל שבת, והראהו מן השמים ששימש עצמו עם תלמיד חכם שנקרא שבת, ובזה נחשב לאיש כמותו חילול שבת</p>\n<p>As is know, once he [the Ba'al Shem Tov] saw one of the common people desecrating the Sabbath and he sighed profoundly about this, thinking in what aspect he himself had desecrated the Sabbath that would lead to his seeing this person desecrating the SAbbath.

    "content": "# Why do some korbanos and not others require n'sachim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Some <em>korbanos</em> require <em>n'sachim</em> (accompanying flour, oil, and wine) and some do not: specifically, all <em>korbanos</em> require <em>n'sachim</em> except the <em>b'chor</em>, the <em>maasar b'hema</em>, the <em>pesach</em>, and most <em>chataos</em> and <em>ashamos</em>. (Source, <em>mishna</em>, <em>M'nachos daf</em> 90.) Why do the members of the one class of <em>korbanos</em> require <em>n'sachim</em> while the members of the other do not? (I'm not asking how we know the difference: there are <em>p'sukim</em> from which each case is derived. I'm asking why the difference exists.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The following is based on the commentary of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Samson Raphael Hirsch</a> on the the paragraph about the nesachim in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlach\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Parashat Shelach</em></a> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9943#v1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Num 15:1-16</a>). (Quotations below are from the <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0910818126\" rel=\"nofollow\">1966 Levy translation</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>According to R' Hirsch, each element of the <em>korbanot</em> is meant to express a particular emotion or intention on the bringer's behalf. Pertinent to this issue:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>'Ola</em> - Dedicating one's whole self to God out of a feeling of duty</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Shelamim</em> - Dedicating one's actions to God out of a feeling of a happy and harmonious life</p></li>\n<li><p>Flour - Possessions that God grants us to enable our existence</p></li>\n<li><p>Oil - Possessions that God grants us to enable health and well-being</p></li>\n<li><p>Wine - Possessions that God grants us to enable joy in life</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>R' Hirsch says that the obligation to append nesachim of these last three elements to <em>korbanot 'ola</em> and <em>shelamim</em> is a lesson to the bringer: \"it is not only the <em>nefesh</em>, the thinking, feeling, striving, active life of a person which ... belongs to God and His Torah, but ... also all ... the elements which are necessary for his existence, his well-being, and his joy in life are no less belonging to God and His holy Torah, come from Him, are dependent on nothing else but Him, and can only be gained by us by fulfilling His Will by \"keeping godliness alive on earth\".</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>With this foundation, R' Hirsch explains why this obligation of <em>nesachim</em> applies to some <em>korbanot</em> and not others.</p>\n\n<p>They don't apply to <em>korbenot chatat</em> and <em>asham</em> because \"sin and consciousness of guilt which are expressed in <em>chatat</em> and <em>asham</em> are not compatible with the happy bliss that finds its expression in <em>nesech</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition (see commentary on v. 3), since the point of this extra obligation is specifically to teach an essential lesson to someone who is voluntarily dedicating himself or his happiness, it applies only to categories of <em>korbanot</em> that can be brought as voluntary offerings, which excludes <em>bechor</em>, <em>ma'aser</em>, <em>pesach</em>, <em>chatat</em>, and <em>asham</em>. (The nation is required to dedicate itself regularly to God in a similar manner through the <em>'olot tamid and musaf</em>, and this dedication of the national self similarly includes a dedication of all the nation's possessions. See commentary on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9890#v38\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ex. 29:38-40</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>The sole exception to these rules is the set of <em>korbanot</em>, including a <em>chatat</em> and an <em>asham</em>, brought by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzaraath\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>metzora'</em></a>, which do require accompanying <em>nesachim</em>. R' Hirsch explains in his commentary to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9915#v10\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lev. 14:10</a>, which prescribes these <em>korbanot</em> for the <em>metzora'</em>, that the point of these <em>korbanot</em> is to express his stripping himself entirely of the traits of self-centeredness that caused his <em>tzara'at</em> and exile from the community. Therefore, \"more than with anybody else, just with him, at his now complete re-entry into the Jewish Community, is the fact to be impressed that his future 'flour, oil and wine', his future existence, well-being and joy in life are solely dependetn hin his ordering his life on faithfulness to duty.\"</p>\n\n\n",

I know we make a Siyum when we complete a large section of Torah learning, and of course Shemini 'Atzereth is also celebrated as Simhath Torah, when we complete (and renew) the cycle of public Torah reading.</p>\n\n<p>But is there a tradition of a \"graduation\" ceremony to mark the completion of studies at an intuition of Jewish education, or is this adopted from our surrounding culture?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Basically, we tend to celebrate events where something is happening. (Or a specific event has just happened.) The Talmud described celebrations when <em>semicha</em> was conferred on someone, which has loosely translated into contemporary <em>semicha</em>-granting parties. (Though our semicha today is much more like a graduation.)</p>\n\n<p>So I'm not aware of a graduation tradition per se. We celebrate an accomplishment like completing a book; but what does \"I'm done with school\" mean for a faith that stresses ongoing study for life?</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Rabbi Mordechai Willig has fascinatingly suggested that a father's prayer at his son's bar mitzvah of \"thank you G-d for exempting me\" means that a father has now fulfilled his bare-bones obligations of educating his son, if the son is now able to read the Torah on his own. </p>\n\n<p>The Sforno observes that the Torah uses passive language for people who are merely acted-upon -- the entire code describing the <em>metzora</em> is all \"his place to sit is out here. He shall be brought... this shall be done to him.\" The exception is the Nazir who has finished the terms of his oath: \"<strong>he shall bring himself</strong> to the Temple.\" While his completion of the term is passive, it will surely lead to active contemplation of his life moving forward -- which is a great message for graduates.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, a teacher of mine told me of his father's high school graduation from Mesivta Tifereth Jerusalem in New York. He said the yearbook featured a letter from Rabbi Moshe Feinstein to the effect of: \"I hear there's this thing called a graduation going on, I asked what it was all about ... it was explained to me that they now have a break from their formal studies and can spend more time learning Torah -- so I join in the rejoicing!\" (I haven't seen the letter, that's how I heard the gist of it described.)</p>\n\n\n",

The only way to clean the knife would be by scouring it with an abrasive substance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therefore, he suggests the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p>If a friend offers you a slice of the watermelon that was just cut with a knife, politely decline. You should assume that the knife was previously used to cut a non-kosher bologna sandwich or a wedge of non-kosher cheese. If you feel compelled to eat the slice of apple, scrub it first.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If it is a fruit platter from a supermarket, you may partake of the fruit since you can assume the supermarket has a dedicated knife for fruit platters. Additionally, due to the sheer volume of fruit cut at one time in such a scenario, we regard the knives and surfaces as clean. The same applies to pre-cut watermelon sold in supermarkets; there is no need to trim the edges.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If the fruit platter came from a non-kosher restaurant or caterer, it is questionable whether you may partake of the fruit, since a single order might be prepared with a non-dedicated knife or on a dirty surface or with the chef’s greasy hands. In this case, the fruit will require washing.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(<em>Credit: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/603/menachem\">Menachem</a></em>)</p>\n\n\n",

Is this a violation of Shabbat? How does one deal with such situations?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The best thing to do, by far, is to work with your boss to rearrange your schedule so you're not cutting it anywhere near that tight.</p>\n\n<p>But for theory's sake, if you somehow find yourself stuck: the most-common practice in North America is to publish candle-lighting times that are 18 minutes prior to sunset. (Among other things, this is to accommodate one minority medieval opinion that Shabbat starts then.) So you have a small window here: if the published candle-lighting time is 7pm, you could technically still drive home and light candles until 7:18pm. </p>\n\n<p>(In some communities the standard published time can be as much as 40 minutes before sunset, by the way.)</p>\n\n<p>Speak to a rabbi (in advance) about what to do if you're still in your car at sunset. (There are a lot of varying details here. For instance, you may be in a sketchy neighborhood where ditching your car and walking could mean risking your life -- or if a joyrider got your car with the keys inside, risking the lives of others.)</p>\n\n<p>Someone angrily wrote to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein -- \"Rabbi, I saw you riding in a car to synagogue Friday evening after Shabbat started!\" Rabbi Feinstein explained that it was, in fact, during this 18-minute window. However, he wrote, as it seems to be bothering people, he'd rework his schedule and ask his driver to pick him up earlier, to arrive at synagogue at least 18 minutes before sunset. (Note: I think it was actually a yeshiva that had prayers, not a synagogue, but you get the point.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Strictly speaking, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/29366/5\">Shalom wrote</a>, you can probably* rely on the 18 minute \"window\".  Many people do.</p>\n\n<p>I have, whenever necessary, arranged with my employers and/or clients to allow me to leave work at a time deemed (by me) adequate to allow me to commute home and prepare for Shabbath and (deemed by them) adequate to allow me to complete my work.  This has typically been 2 hours prior to candle-lighting, give or take a few minutes; to make it easy to keep track, I usually leave at a time ending in multiples of 5 (eg., 2:45pm when candle-lighting is at 4:43pm).</p>\n\n<p>To make things even simpler, some people I know leave at a set time every Friday in the winter months, say 2:30pm, regardless of whether candle-lighting is at 4:30pm or 5:30pm.</p>\n\n<p>Some people I know work a 10-hour schedule Monday through Thursday and take off on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>Many countries have laws requiring employers give reasonable religious accommodation.

Other sources say that chet means \"lack\" and may refer to the lack of fulfilling a positive commandment. An earlier answer essentially summarized these points.\nAll of these words differ from the term \"aveira\" in that they all appear in Tanakh, while the word aveira and its cognates first appear in rabbinic sources. \"Aveira\" is related to the root עבר \"pass\" which refers to somebody \"passing\" or \"crossing\" over a certain red line without specifying that he had sinned, per se.</p>\n\n<p>SOURCE: <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/this_week/whats_in_a_word/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>What's in a word?</em></a>, \"Degrees of Sin\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><em>Avera</em>-intentional sin</p>\n\n<p><em>Pesha</em>-intentional sin to make Hashem angry (kivyachol)</p>\n\n<p><em>Chet</em>-unintentional sin </p>\n\n<p>Source: HaRav Yosef Mizrahi Shalit\"a, and Siddur Kawanat HaLev.</p>\n\n\n",

Also if you put a fence around the Bima (if it is smaller than 2X2 meters). \nThis is to allow raising the shaliach tzibur so that the congregation can hear him better - this was accepted in many Kehilot in preference to the original minhag is to put the Chazan <strong>lower</strong> than the people as in \"Mimamakim Keraticha\"</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!\n<a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/02-03-04/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Source\">Source</a></p>\n\n\n",

'Shmekha' with the segol under the mem is the pausal form of this word; 'Shimkha' is the regular, non-pausal form. Whether a word occurs at a point of pause or flows on to the next word is indicated by the accents, the ta'amei ha-mikra. Every word has an accent and all accents are either conjunctive or disjunctive. There are different intensities of pause indicated by different disjunctive ta'amim. The most intense disjunctive accents, sof pasuk and etnahta, always lead to the pausal form of a word being used. For the less intense pauses, the choice of whether the pausal or non-pausal forms is used seems harder to predict but is determined by the tradition of how to read the Bible as handed down by the Ba'aley Ha-Massorah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why aren't we Mahmir (stringent) with just Mikvah when ruling leniently on a technicality in Niddah cases?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know from experience and some introductory study of the laws of Niddah that rabbis typically try to find leniencies wherever possible in issues of family purity. In many instances, a Posek will rely on a technicality to permit a husband and wife to be together even though common sense might dictate that the likelihood is extremely low that a particular stain, or even series of stains, came from any source other than uteran blood.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate the delicate nature of these questions, as well as the importance of finding ways to be lenient in these matters. I also understand that in many communities, women must trek far distances, even today, to get to a Mikvah, and that even when a Mikvah is easily accessible and clean some women find it difficult to go.</p>\n\n<p>But in instances when the rabbi knows that a woman can easily access a clean, warm, Mikvah with friendly attendants, and the particular woman asking the question enjoys the experience and has no emotional or personal difficulty getting ready or accessing the Mikvah, why isn't she encouraged to be stringent and go \"just in case\", when the leniency being applied is based on a technicality and the woman wouldn't need to separate from her husband for any extra time (she could go that night)?</p>\n\n<p>I understand that we <em>don't</em>. But why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Aside from the previous answers, the concept שלא יהא לבו נוקפו may apply here - see Niddah 12a that discourages doing a bedika/examination directly after/before intimate relations - as a matter of course - because it may scare off the husband. If we suggest going to Mikva even when she is 'legally' tahor, they may be uneasy in a similar situation if Mikva is not available.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><em>IN GENERAL</em></p>\n\n<p>A woman who has been to mikve has a <strong>chazaka</strong> of being \"clean\" therefore whenever a question comes up (excluding days where she must check herself i.e days 30,31) the Rabbi needs concrete evidence to break that chazaka so any reason to say the stain came from some place else is enough to keep the chazaka in place and it's not considered being lenient. However once a woman sees <em>nidah blood</em> then her chazaka is one of a \"unclean\" woman and in that case you need a strong case to make her \"clean\" so the same blood she sees during her clean days maybe declared clean while if she saw the same type of blood during a \"hefesk tahara\" it would be declared unclean.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of Chazaka is one of the main pillers of halacha. However you can look at the following to get an idea how it is used in the laws of Nida</p>\n\n<p>Nida 15a  <code>כל הנשים בחזקת טהרה לבעליהן</code> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://torahlearning.org/nidah/184-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch Siman 184, Seif 9</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Chassam Sofer, cited in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5515\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pischei Teshuvos 190:10</a>, says that the entire concept of <em>kesamim</em> (impurity through stains) to which the rules of \"technicalities\" are applied was really only instituted for the purposes of the laws of ritual purity and impurity, and only for purposes of consistency was it applied to the prohibition of a woman to her husband.  Therefore, nowadays when we do not have practical applications of ritual purity in this regard, the entire concept of <em>kesamim</em> is only an artifact, the whole idea only exists in the context in which it was rabbinically instituted, and there is no prohibition to discuss beyond that.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in all of these leniencies due to technicalities, it is not being lenient in the face of a prohibition, but rather there is no prohibition of which to speak except for in the context in which the original rabbinic prohibition was created.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Verbs or Nouns in the Amidah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the second brakhah of the amidah, מחיה is vocalized with a segol under the yud in some siddurim--making it a present-tense verb (1); and with a tzere in other siddurim--making it a noun in construct state (2). The choice between noun and verb is also relevant to the the other predicates applied to God in the paragraph (and in the other brakhot of the amidah, and in most brakhot in general), even if they happen to be words for which the two forms are identical.  What are the reasons for choosing to take these words as verbs and what are the reasons for choosing to take them as nouns and what sources have discussed the issue?</p>\n\n<p>(1) See the <a href=\"http://he.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%97%3a%D7%92%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%AA_%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%99_%D7%9C%D7%99%22%D7%94\">table</a> of גִּזְרַת נָחֵי ל\"ה verbs, specifically בניין פִּעֵל in the tense הווה, showing that the second root letter is vocalized segol. </p>\n\n<p>(2) See <a href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar/89\">Gesenius ¶89 2</a> (c): \"Nouns in ־ֶה‎ from verbs ל״ה‎ form their constr. st. in ־ֵה‎....\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>     The word מחיה is the male singular present participle of the piel form of the verb חיה.  In the context of the second blessing of the Amidah, it means \"he who gives life,\" or \"he who causes to live.\"  The normal vocalization of piel participles uses the tzere vowel, e.g. מְגַדֵּל, \"he who makes great.\"  However, the verb חיה ends with the letter he, and so the vowel should be segol instead, i.e. מְחיֶּה.  Your observation of both vowels is not surprising since they are very similar phonetically.</p>\n\n<p>     Besides differences in vocalizations of words in the Amidah, there are actually differences in the wording of the 19 blessings themselves.  For example, the Ashkenazi and Sephardic versions of the Amidah differ for 15 of the 19 blessings.  It should then come as no surprise that there are other differences in vocalizations.  In the sixth blessing, the Ashkenazi version vocalizes \"forgive\" as מְחַל, while the Sephardic version uses מְחוֹל.  These are two different ways of vocalizing the same imperative.</p>\n\n<p>    There is a noun מִחְיָה which appears as an entry in Jastrow's dictionary.  However, it means \"provision.\"  In addition, the vowel pointing is different from the word we see in the Amidah, so it does not appear that our word is a noun (although a participle is a sort of verbal noun).</p>\n\n\n",

It seems to me that they should be in reverse order. For example, the first verse says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִלּוּ הוֹצִיאָנוּ מִמִּצְרָיִם וְלֹא עָשָׂה בָּהֶם שְׁפָטִים דַּיֵּנוּ</p>\n<p>If he had taken us out from Egypt, and had not carried out judgements against them, it would have been enough.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then the second verse says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִלּוּ עָשָׂה בָּהֶם שְׁפָטִים וְלֹא עָשָׂה בֵּאלֹהֵיהֶם דַּיֵּנוּ</p>\n<p>If he had carried out judgements against them, and not against their idols, it would have been enough.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That order does not make any sense to me.

    "content": "# Is instigating a crime through careless choices of words a violation of Lifnei 'Iver?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I would like to look at the scope of <i>Lifnei 'Iver</i> -- the commandment to not put a stumbling block before the blind (Lev. 19:14). Specifically, I would like to know how one is punished for the sin -- does someone who causes another person to sin liable for that sin as if he did it himself?  Must the violator of <i>Lifnei 'Iver</i> have intended that a person sinned as a result of his suggestions?  And would a person be in violation of <i>Lifnei 'Iver</i> if he was causing somone to sin without being warned that his actions constituted the sin of <i>Lifnei 'Iver</i> for which he could be punished under Jewish law (e.g. restitution, fines, lashes, etc.)?  Is that answer different if the person is an expert in Jewish law?  If the words that sent the events in motion constituted loshon hara (gossip) or motzei shem ra (slanderous lies), does the speaker have any liability for the damage caused to the ones whom he influenced with his words?</p>\n\n<p>To give these questions context, lets use a very possible hypothetical.  Rabbi tells his students that smart phones are a sin and no one should have one, and that it would be best for the world if all were destroyed.  Student 1 sees that his roommate owns a smart phone and destroys it on his own, thinking that this is what his rabbi would want.  Did the rabbi unintentionally violate <i>Lifnei 'Iver</i>? To what extent is the rabbi liable for his student's theft and destruction of his roommate's property?</p>\n\n<p>Second hypothetical:  Rabbi tells congregation that Ploni-al-moni is an \"evil man\" and should be \"taught a lesson.\"  Congregant hearing this takes it upon himself to beat up Ploni-al-moni and put him in the hospital.  Might the rabbi be liable for <i>Lifnei 'Iver</i> because he didn't also tell his congregants that he meant G-d should punish the sinner, and not them?</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why do men or boys have to cover their hair, but not unmarried women?",
    "content": "# Why do men or boys have to cover their hair, but not unmarried women?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Whatever the reasons for covering hair (e.g. fear of heaven), they seem to equally apply to men and women. So why don't unmarried women have to cover their hair?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Let me break this question down.  First, there is a minhag (custom) that men should cover their head as a sign of reverence to G-d.  The custom was codified as halacha for men (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.91.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 91:3</a>) which stated that it is forbidden to say G-d's name or to even walk into a Synagogue with your head uncovered.  For me the practical aspects are (a) that the kippah serves as reminder that I stand before G-d, and (b) that covering my head stands as a signal that I am a Torah Jew and that should I stray from the Torah my behavior will be seen and noted by others and reflect poorly on the Jewish people.  </p>\n\n<p>Married women cover their hair, and not just their heads, for a different purpose.  Their hair covering serves as a shield to hide one of their most attractive features to men other than their husbands, and also states clearly that the woman is married and not available.</p>\n\n<p>So to your question:  Why don't woman cover their heads as a reminder that they stand before G-d?  The Tzitz Eliezer (12:13), citing numerous sources, says that there is no logical legal basis for unmarried girls to not cover their head when saying Hashem's name or going into Shul.  He even brings from the Ish Matzliach who says that in Tunisia they enforced this Halacha and all girls covered their head when men would also be required to do so by Halacha.  So why is that not true anywhere else? </p>\n\n<p>You, in your answer, hit on one reason.  The Chasam Sofer, commenting on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.30b.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nedarim 30b</a>, and the Taz (OC 8:3) stated that in Talmudic times men often didn't cover their heads, but we adopted the custom because non-Jews prayed with their heads uncovered, but required their women to cover their heads, and we want to make sure that we do not follow their customs.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason follows the reasoning as to why men are required to daven with a minyan or wear tzitzit and women are not.  Men start life at a much lower spiritual level than women (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.11b.4-7?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 11b</a>, Niddah 31).  Similarly, the Maharal explains that men require more help to overcome their inherent aggressiveness in contrast to women (Hidushei Aggadot I, Kol Kitvei Maharal).  </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in his commentary on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.17.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 17:14</a>, summed it up beautifully: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The pure feminine sex, if it descends from Sarah, does not require the external sign of the covenant with Sha-dai, the God who \"sets the measure.\" It itself bears this warning of \"Dai\" [\"enough\"] within itself, in the pure feeling of the limits set by its tzniyus with which the true Jewish women are filled. She has the tendency by itself to submit herself to all the laws of purity and godliness, and demands such submission from all that come into contact with her.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, women don't need to cover their heads to remind themselves they stand before G-d, but men need all the help they can get.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Qitzur Shulhhan 'Arukh - Yalqut Yosef (<a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01355_part_82.html#%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9FB%D7%9B%D7%90B-B%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%A7B%D7%9E%D7%9FB%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even HaEzer 21:9</a>) writes (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פשט המנהג שבנות רווקות הולכות בגילוי ראש ברשות הרבים, שמעיקר ההלכה אשה שאינה נשואה אינה חייבת בכיסוי ראש. ורק בעת שמתפללות או מברכות ומזכירות שם שמים, תכסנה ראשן</p>\n<p>The general custom is for single women to go in public with uncovered hair; because, per <em>'Iqar HaHalakhah</em>, an unmarried woman is not obligated to cover her hair. Nevertheless, <strong>when praying, reciting blessings or reciting the name of HaShem, they should cover their hair</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While on this topic, there is a tradition of unmarried women and girls covering the head or covering the hair, but it is not the Ashkenazi custom.</p>\n\n<p>There is a ruling in the Shulchan Aruch that all women, married and unmarried, should cover the head / hair, but \"unmarried\" was interpreted differently by different commentators.  Some said that it does refer to all women and girls, others to both married women and women who were once married.</p>\n\n<p>If you consider that Karo and Maimonides lived in Muslim societies, where all girls take up hijab at puberty, Jewish girls would be living in a society where basic dress meant covering the head and the body with a long veil whenever she went out.  </p>\n\n<p>Shortly after puberty, a girl would be married or engaged.  So perhaps Karo did not feel that the statement \"married or unmarried\" required much explanation.  </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, Ashkenazi commentators lived in Christian societies, where men would bare their heads in church while women covered theirs, in accordance with the NT.  There may have been a desire to differentiate Jewish practice from this.</p>\n\n<p>If you go to a traditional Yeminite family, you will see women and girls cover their heads when saying brachot even if they do not cover the rest of the time.  (They will even use a kippah if one is handy.)  </p>\n\n<p>Yeminite customs are some of the most ancient and unchanged from Biblical times and I think this hints at a tradition of all women (like men) covering the head when pronouncing the name of G-d.  </p>\n\n<p>However, since women also cover the head for modesty, there is a lot going on here.  And that is why you can get 10 different but still legitimate answers to this question.</p>\n\n\n",

They had to do hishtadlut (efforts) every day to get their manna in varying degrees, but they knew all along that the amount they would get was preordained.</p>\n\n<p>Sha'ar HaBitahhon does <strong>not</strong> say, however, that the amount of hishtadlut depends on one's level of trust.

Rav Dessler says there (pp. 53-54, emphasis my own):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] Every human being has free choice <strong>in whatever situation</strong> he may be. His free choice extends to the one point at which the forces of truth and falsehood are balanced in <strong>his</strong> mind. It is here that free will comes into play.

For example, it is above our free-will point at this moment to fast and plead with Hashem to forgive us for the minutes we have spent without learning Torah (as the Gaon of Vilna did before his death). On the other hand the Yetzer HaRa is not likely to tempt us, in normal circumstances, to light a cigarette on Shabbat; this is below our behira-point.</p>\n<p>But the situation is never static. [...] <strong>Our free-will point [can] rise</strong>. Things will come within our moral range which had previously been outside it. <strong>And vice versa: our behira-point can fall</strong>, and then matters can come within the range of temptation which previously held no attraction for us at all.</p>\n<p>Parents cannot affect the actual behira of their children. The act of free is something which every human being must do by and for himself. But parents and educators can decide <em>at what level</em> the children's behira shall begin to operate. They can establish the starting-point of person's behira, though only the person himself can decide where it will end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Are the apples still forbidden?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>We have a concept that if he merely indicates a Neder, and it is Not clear because it is lacking both verbal expression, and visual indication, is not a Neder.</p>\n\n<p>Source Nedarim 6a; where the Ran says on that Gemoro.קיימא לן כרבא: ידיים שאין מוכיחות לא הוויין ידיים we hold like Rovo that an indication of a Neder which has no clear meaning to other people is not a neder. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemoro in Kiddushin 5b says (with explanation of the Ran): (קידושין ה ב) אמר שמואל האומר לאשה, \"הרי את מקודשת\", \"הרי את מאורסת\", הרי זו מקודשת. וכן בגרושין, \"הרי את מגורשת\", \"הרי את מותרת לכל אדם\", הרי זו מגורשת.\nומקשינן התם: \"למימרא דסבר שמואל ידיים שאין מוכיחות הויין ידיים\"? כלומר: מדקאמר הרי זו מקודשת אף על גב דלא אמר \"לי\".Says Shmuel: Someone who says to a woman \"You are betrothed\"(with money) she is betrothed to him, and when he divorces and says to his wife \"you are divorced,\" she is divorced from him (with a get). The Gemora asks: Surely Shmuel Holds that a Yad Sheeino Mochiach (indication which is unclear), is not a Yad? i.e He never mentioned that the woman was betrothed or divorced \"to/from me.\" This is a lack of indication.<br>\nומשני, הכא במאי עסקינן, דאמר לה \"לי\". אלמא שמואל גופיה סבירא ליה דידיים שאין מוכיחות לא הויין ידיים.  The Gemora answers that Shmuel meant that when he is betrothing/divorcing his wife, he says: \"you are betrothed divorced To/from me\" which is a clear Kiddushin/geirushin. Therefore a Yad Sheeino Mochiach (indication which is unclear) is not valid(for a Kiddushin/get) or binding (for a neder) </p>\n\n<p>We see that its considered a \"Yad Sheeino Mochiach\" (indication which is unclear) even with the mention of \"Kiddushin\" or \"Geirushin,\" and She is not married/divorced to/from him, because He never said \"You are Betrothed/divorced to/from me\" </p>\n\n<p>So too in our case where he says Konam alai and merely thinks about what he wants to prohibit on himself, even though he Mentioned \"Konam,\" since he didn't indicate at all what he is referring to, it is called a Yad Sheeino Mochiach (indication which is unclear), and the Neder would not be binding.</p>\n\n<p>However lets say apples were in front of him (I'm not sure if the questioner is talking about this situation), and he said \"Konam alai\", if the people around see that he is clearly referring to the apples e.g there is no other fruit in front of him, even though his words have no clear indication by themselves, the fact that an exterior factor (i.e the apples in front of him) indicates clearly what he means, this would be considered a Yad  Mochiach (clear indication) and the Neder will be binding.</p>\n\n<p>This is clear from the continuation of the Gemoro kiddushin 5b:\nוהתנן: האומר \"אהא\", הרי זה נזיר. והוינן בה: ודילמא אהא בתענית קאמר? ואמר שמואל: כשהיה נזיר עובר לפניו; דמשמע דהא לאו הכי, הוו להו ידיים שאין מוכיחות ולא הויין ידיים. We have a Mishna That say :A person who says \"I will be\" He becomes a Nazir , But surely this is a Yad Sheeino Mochiach (indication which is unclear), since \"i will be\" could be referring to \"I will be fasting.\" Therefore Shmuel explains in this case, he is saying \"I will be,\" whilst a Nazir is walking in front of him. Therefore it is clear to everyone he wants to be a Nazir (and he doesn't want to fast).</p>\n\n\n",

There's nothing that Rav quotes.  There's a story just before it about Remi bar Yehezkel asking R' 'Amram to tell him a fascinating thing in the name of R' Asi, which, when R' 'Amram responds, sounds somewhat similar.  But is that it?

The Rambam was much astounded at this question, and he said, 'I don't understand how this is so, that a question like this could arise in the mind of a Jew... for questions such as this do not arise in the Jewish mind until his soul is an impure soul. And the Rambam refrained from answering him regarding his question.</p>\n<p>After some length of time, this fellow continued sending many letters, until the Rambam felt that he had to answer him. And his answer to the gaon was: Go and check the slaughterers and the inspectors in your community.</p>\n<p>Upon receipt of the letter, the gaon followed the instructions of the Rambam.

The Smak says we can rely on their word if they happen to tell us without realizing that they are giving us the information we want to hear, and that we can rely on them if there had been someone entering and exiting, which itself is broken down into two reasons: fear that they might be caught not washing it, and a general assumption that non-Jews are careful about cleanliness.  The Riva says we don't rely on their word at all because we can just have a non-Jewish chef taste it and tell us if there's a salty taste.</p>\n\n<p>Later sources discuss further stringencies and leniencies, including a fear that if they know our customs they may be more apt to lie to reassure us.  My understanding is that the general rule of thumb we follow is that, for Ashkenazim, if they casually tell us we can rely on them, whereas for Sepharadim, only if there is someone going in and out may they be trusted.</p>\n\n<p>These issues are mentioned with regard to washing salted meat because that was a common issue that people dealt with - having partially prepared meat in the kitchen with non-Jewish servants around.  But the bottom-line issues are relevant across the board.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, <strong>with regard to bugs in produce</strong>, are we allowed to trust non-Jews in places like restaurants, where there is a minimum requirement of cleanliness required by the government, who spot-checks food establishments (similar to entering and exiting), as well as a reputation they want to uphold that their food is clean?  Many people eat salads at business lunches that are held in non-Kosher restaurants.  <strong>Can they rely on the salad being bug-free for these reasons?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think the answer here lies in the fact that, while we can trust a non-Jew trained in bug removal to do his job, we can't rely on a regular restaurant to fully remove bugs to the point that would satisfy the halachic needs of bug removal. At best, if you have a really strict vegan restaurant, they might theoretically remove bugs to a satisfactory degree if you know they do so. Also theoretically, you could check the salad yourself, but that would likely not go over well during your business luncheon, depending what the salad is made from.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ou.org/shabbat/5766/kosher/vayechi66.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">From the OU</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The FDA tolerance levels of insect infestation in produce are far more permissive than proper halachic standards. For example, the US government allows averages of up to 60 insects per 100 grams in frozen broccoli, and up to 50 insects per 100 grams of frozen spinach (See Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act 402 (a)(3)). (There are no FDA action levels written specifically for fresh salad mixes, and typically the standard required throughout the industry for leafy vegetables is the frozen spinach FDA tolerance level).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My understanding is that from a food-safety perspective, the occasional bug in a salad is not a big concern. Hence the restaurant's interest or government inspections alone aren't enough to guarantee the level of certainty that's needed to call it kosher.

    "content": "# Per my beliefs, to which should I convert: Modern Orthodox or Conservative Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was born to a Jewish father and Christian mother, following all Jewish holidays, and have always identified as a Jew and nothing else. I was frequently reminded by my friends (most of whom were Jewish) that, technically, I am not a Jew. Nevertheless, my research has shown that I am considered a Jew per Reform Judaism, which adheres to patrilineal descent if a child is brought up Jewishly.</p>\n\n<p>I have always wanted to convert to make it more \"official\" in the community in which I live,  and because I do not wish for anyone to doubt my faith. I wish it was enough for me to believe I'm Jewish based on my actions and beliefs; but, that isn't the case. And, as I accept Judaism, it must accept me.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, my dilemma: I don't know according to which stream of Judaism to convert. I am of Ashkenazi descent and was raised upholding all high holidays, Shabbos, attending shul at least once yearly and separating dairy and meat. I believe the Torah was given to Moses and that everything was as intended without human interference and interpretations (i.e. Modern Orthodox). I feel that, by converting via Modern Orthodoxy, I would feel more accepted by everyone. Nevertheless, I am not sure I am ready to commit to modest dress and other key elements that Modern Orthodoxy requires. I am speaking to a Modern Orthodox Rabbi on Friday, but I am still undecided. I feel as though Conservative Judaism doesn't adhere enough, that Orthodoxy adheres too much, and that I'm somewhere in the middle. Please advise.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>To paraphrase <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/26730/5\">myself</a>, If a person converts by any standard that is not universally recognized, then that person will not be regarded as Jewish by those with stricter standards.</p>\n\n<p>As you've observed, Orthodox Judaism is stricter than Conservative Judaism, and Orthodox conversion requires more than Conservative or Reform conversion.  As such, Conservative conversions are not recognized by Orthodox Jews, and anyone who has undergone a Conservative conversion would need to later undergo an Orthodox conversion if they want to join an Orthodox synagogue and be recognized by the Orthodox community as being Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, <strong>for a woman in particular</strong>, since Orthodox Judaism recognizes matrilineal descent, and not patrilineal descent, if her conversion is not recognized by the community, her children will not be regarded as Jewish, either. If there is any desire to enroll the children in a Jewish day school or any inkling that the convert may want her children (or a recognition that her children may one day decide) to join an Orthodox community, having a mother who underwent a Conservative conversion will pose a problem for them.</p>\n\n<p>Having said all of that, you must also recognize that Orthodox standards of conversion require a commitment, and it's a lifetime commitment - you don't get to decide later that it's too much for you.  I can't speak with any authority about the ideas that other streams of Judaism may have.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Speaking as an Orthodox Jew, I would advise that you are not ready to convert to Judaism.

    "title": "What is the most successful way to do conversion for a Gentile girl in a relationship with a Jew?",
    "content": "# What is the most successful way to do conversion for a Gentile girl in a relationship with a Jew?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Suppose the following situation, which commonly arises. A Jewish guy starts dating a non-Jewish girl, and they both fall in love. She respects his religion and wants to convert in order to be able to marry him under a chuppah. We are talking here about Orthodox Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Now, she may start out wanting to convert in order to be with someone. But as she goes through the process of learning about Judaism she may genuinely come to accept the Jewish Covenant and decide to follow all the commandments. If she immerses in a Mikveh and a court of three observant Orthodox Jews finds her Giur to be successful, then she is a Jew, right? From that point on, if she keeps all the commandments to the same level as a relatively lax Jew, she is still considered fully Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>I realize there are some Kabbalistic opinions that souls of converts were really Jewish from the moment they were born. </p>\n\n<p>My question is this: rabbis traditionally ignore the first few requests for conversion. But are they expected to totally turn someone away if they begin conversion as a result of being in a relationship, because it is \"for the wrong reasons\"? What is the most successful way to actually get such a Gentile girl to convert? I am concerned about the following issues:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Rabbis refusing to start the process because the girl is in a romantic relationship with a Jew</p></li>\n<li><p>The effect on soul of the convert of not following all the commandments post-conversion vs remaining a relatively righteous Noahide</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If I were to date gentile girls, and casually tell them about Judaism, and only marry one who becomes genuinely interested of her own volition (placing me in the company of e.g. Steven Spielberg, Jared Kushner and Sasha Baron Cohen) what are the consequences of this in the afterlife, etc. according to rabbinical Judaism?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>\"If she immerses in a Mikveh and a court of three observant Orthodox Jews finds her Giur to be successful, then she is a Jew, right?\"</p>\n\n<p>Right, though you'd want to make sure the beis din is widely accepted. See the list of RCA batei din (<a href=\"http://www.judaismconversion.org/batei.din.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.judaismconversion.org/batei.din.html</a>), or the list of batei din accepted by the Israeli Rabbanut (<a href=\"http://sephardicjewishguide.weebly.com/conversion.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sephardicjewishguide.weebly.com/conversion.html</a>).</p>\n\n<p>\"But are they expected to totally turn someone away if they begin conversion as a result of being in a relationship, because it is 'for the wrong reasons'?\"</p>\n\n<p>No. If the person genuinely wants to convert, is willing to become completely observant for life (even if the couple splits up, for example), and the spouse is willing to become observant enough to avoid getting in the way of the spouse's conversion, then most Orthodox batei din will allow conversion. It is a fairly common situation that a Jew and non-Jew are dating and the non-Jew converts Orthodox before marrying. See the book Becoming a Jew by R' Lamm, which notes how common this is.</p>\n\n<p>See the following policy statement by the RCA, which manages a network of widely-accepted batei din:</p>\n\n<p>\"Where marriage to a particular Jewish partner is a major incentive to a prospective conversion, there is an increased possibility that the geirus may come with less than the complete commitment necessary for a conversion that would be in keeping with the standards we are trying to set for the regional Batei Din. Nonetheless, experience also shows that such a motivation can result in converts of the highest caliber. Conversion for the sake of marriage therefore requires the Beit Din to constantly reevaluate if the candidate and future partner are likely to subscribe to the requisite beliefs and practices. The Beit Din must be convinced that <em>if the potential spouse were to disappear from the candidate’s life, his or her commitment to the Jewish faith and people would not waver.</em> These factors inevitably prolong the process and make examination of the prospective convert more intense. Indeed, should the couple mention a proposed wedding date as a deadline or goal, the Beit Din should respond that the process will take significantly longer than that.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.judaismconversion.org/GPS_Policies_and_Procedures.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.judaismconversion.org/GPS_Policies_and_Procedures.html</a></p>\n\n<p>\"What is the most successful way to actually get such a Gentile girl to convert?\"</p>\n\n<p>I don't understand what you're asking with this question. Do you meant if that a Jew is dating a non-Jewish woman, what is a successful strategy for persuading her to convert? If so, this is a problematic question. Most sincere converts convert out of a strong personal desire to convert, not because someone wanted them to. However, there may be situations in which a non-Jewish woman exposed to Orthodox Judaism in a non-forceful and gradual way may come to decide she wants to convert. As noted below, however, this is unlikely to succeed and one should not expect it to take place.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps by the question you mean the following: if the non-Jewish woman wants to convert, what is the most successful strategy for completing the conversion? In this case, the answer would simply be to attempt to start the gerus process and <em>don't take no for an answer</em> (that is, persist in your interest even if rabbis try to discourage you or don't answer your calls, etc.). How to go about starting and progressing in the conversion process is explained at length and very practically in <em>The Gerus Guide</em> by R' Aryeh Moshen.</p>\n\n<p>\"If I were to date gentile girls, and casually tell them about Judaism, and only marry one who becomes genuinely interested of her own volition (placing me in the company of e.g. Steven Spielberg, Jared Kushner and Sasha Baron Cohen) what are the consequences of this in the afterlife, etc. according to rabbinical Judaism?\"</p>\n\n<p>It is wrong for a Jewish man to date non-Jewish women. So as far as the afterlife is concerned, I would think you would be punished for that (if you do not do adequate teshuvah in your lifetime, at least). It is important to note that the <em>vast majority of non-Jewish women you date will not be drawn strongly enough to Orthodox Judaism to be able to successfully convert</em>. It is an extremely risky and dangerous strategy to date non-Jewish girls with the hope that you can nudge the one you end up falling in love with and wanting to marry into converting. In short, it is extremely unlikely to succeed.</p>\n\n<p>\"The effect on soul of the convert of not following all the commandments post-conversion vs remaining a relatively righteous Noahide\"</p>\n\n<p>If the convert did not truly accept all the mitzvos, then the conversion was not valid. But <em>if the conversion is valid and the person is not completely observant afterward, the person would be punished for their aveiros as would any born Jew</em>. Note that when a convert is unobservant after a conversion, the conversion is sometimes considered to have been invalid.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You mention 2 concerns. Let's take each one separately:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Rabbis refusing to start the process because the girl is in a romantic relationship with a Jew</strong></p>\n\n<p>Classicaly, as a general rule, Rabbis would not agree to deal with a non-Jew who has ulterior motives for converting.</p>\n\n<p>Historically this meant that the relationship would end, as few Jews would marry out of their faith. If they were an exception to the rule, then everybody would shun them as <em>the one who doesn't belong</em> or other nasty appellations.</p>\n\n<p>However, nowadays, people have no qualms marrying out of the faith. Some Rabbis may consider conversion of  the non-Jew as the <em>lesser of the 2 evils</em> and decide it's better for all involved for the conversion to take place.</p>\n\n<p>So back to your concern, you could solve this by \"shopping around\" for a Rabbi who can be convinced that conversion would be the best choice is this particular case. Note, however, that many conversions are not universally accepted. These can cause very serious problems later on. If you have children from a spouse converted this way, schools, other people, and the State of Israel may reject their Jewishness and consider them Gentiles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. The effect on soul of the convert of not following all the commandments post-conversion vs remaining a relatively righteous Noahide</strong></p>\n\n<p>This concern has no easy way around it. There is no obligation for a gentile to convert - and they are routinely discouraged from doing so, during the conversion process.</p>\n\n<p>A gentile has the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_Noah\" rel=\"nofollow\">7 Naochide laws</a> they must follow - and that earns them their place in the world to come.</p>\n\n<p>Once they decide that they must join the Jewish people, they are in a more precarious situation that a Jew-from-birth.</p>\n\n<p>The latter can claim that he was forced (by an accident of birth, so to speak) to be Jewish. He can claim that he wasn't ever taught the law in a compelling way. How his claims affects his punishment, is up to the Heavenly Court to decide.</p>\n\n<p>A convert, on the other hand, has no such excuses. They will have been warned multiple times that they have to keep Jewish Law in its entirety, as well as the consequences of not doing so. They will have been taught the basic laws - and usually even be tested on the material.</p>\n\n<p>By insisting on nevertheless converting, they will be punished much more severely - for the same sins - as their Jewish-from-birth counterpart, who was not given the choice.</p>\n\n<p>The end result is that a convert who ends up not following all the commandments post-conversion is in worse shape spiritually, than a relatively righteous Noahide.</p>\n\n\n",

Whoever possesses the following three traits is of the disciples of our father Abraham; and whoever possesses the opposite three traits is of the disciples of the wicked Balaam</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The three traits are: a good/evil eye, a meek/haughty soul, and a humble/gross spirit.</p>\n<p>There must be a tens of people the Mishna could have picked to represent these traits, on either side, and some of them would seem to be better pairs than Avraham/Bilaam. Just coming to mind is Avraham/Nimrod, Yaakov/Eisav, Moshe/Pharoah, or even Moshe/Bilaam. So I'm wondering, why Avraham and Bilaam? Are they considered the epitome of these traits, and is that the only reason that they are paired?</p>\n<p>More importantly, do any of the classical commentaries discuss this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>A few points. </p>\n\n<p>1 - <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2746&st=&pgnum=98&hilite=\">Yabia Omer authored by Rabbi Yehuda Leib Grobart</a> questions why does it say the disciples of Avraham and Bilaam and not Avraham and Bilaam themselves. He answers that Bilaam looked to an outsider like a complete Tzadik however he was a fraud. The only way to tell the difference was by their students and that is why it says the disciples of Avraham and Bilaam.</p>\n\n<p>2 - <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34466&st=&pgnum=308&hilite=\">Eitz haDaas Tov authored by Rabbi Chaim Vital</a> says that Bilaam was a grandson of Lavan who was a grandson of Nachor, Avraham's brother. </p>\n\n<p>3 - <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40197&st=&pgnum=306&hilite=\">Neim Zemiros Yisrael authored by Rabbi Yitzchak Gershtenkorn</a> mentions a similarity between Avraham and Bilaam based on a Mechilta in Beshalach. Both Avraham and Bilaam woke up early and saddled their donkeys. </p>\n\n<p>Based on the above I would propose that the Mishna is showing a difference between family members, which would explain why Avraham/Nimrod, Moshe/Pharoah, and Moshe/Bilaam were not chosen for this comparison. Regarding Yaakov/Eisav - although when Eisav was younger it was unclear that he was evil, as he got older it was clear that he was evil. That leaves us with Avraham/Bilaam who to the world they seemed alike, Bilaam even imitated Avraham by getting up early and saddling his donkey, and they came from the same Mispacha and look how far apart they were, - therefore the comparison.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37946&pgnum=398\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Rambam, in his Commentary on the Mishna</a>, says that both Avraham and Bilaam's characteristics are explicit in the Torah.

The late Rabbi Aaron Soloveichik of Chicago went so far as to write \"the egg is treated as nothing more than some synthetic device made in Japan.\"</p>\n\n<p>In Israel, many rabbis are of the opinion that it is determined by the <em>egg</em> mother. (This is also the opinion of two very significant rabbis in Baltimore, of one whom heads the kosher organization and the other of whom its council of rabbis.)</p>\n\n<p>At this point in America, many rabbis are shifting their views (for various reasons, including influence of Israel, and the possibility in the future of an artificial womb, or gestating a human embryo in some other species) and calling it a toss-up.</p>\n\n<p>Hence -- <em>as always, ask a local rabbi</em> -- most likely it would be recommended that the child undergo a conversion ritual, just in case. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Even if it's already two weeks since your question, I'd still like to answer. As Shalom already pointed out, there is as of yet, no unified opinion in Halacha (orthodox Jewish religious law) regarding embryo donations and also egg donations. In Halacha, the religious status of a child (if it is considered Jewish or non-Jewish) depends only on the mother. In the case of embryo- and egg donations there are, so to speak, two mothers involved: the egg or embryo donor and the woman who carries out the pregnancy and gives birth. </p>\n\n<p>The three basic opinions in the halachic discussion are therefore 1) The woman who donated the embryo or egg is the mother 2) the woman who gave birth to the child is the mother 3) both are mothers to the child. Which position is given preference depends on which Rabbi you ask. However, there seems to be a trend shifting from the older position (No. 2) to positions No. 1 and No. 3. As you can see, it will be difficult to get a clear answer regarding whether the child is Jewish or not - different Rabbis in different places will view this differently. </p>\n\n<p>For the child, this uncertainty could make finding his or her identity rather complicated. There is another issue as well: Assuming that the child <em>is</em> halachically Jewish, he or she would be obligated by Jewish Law to follow Jewish religious customs, such as keeping kosher and Shabbat and many more. In a non-Jewish household that is extremely difficult. (I'm speaking from experience - was born non-Jewish but in my teenage years got interested in Judaism and started trying to live as a religious Jew while still with my parents - it led to quite some trouble. I've converted to Judaism since and live now in Israel.) </p>\n\n<p>Aside from practical considerations, Judaism in general discourages Jewish children growing up in non-Jewish families, because the child might very well identify with the religion of his or her adoptive parents and then, from the strictly Jewish standpoint, be lost to Judaism and a \"sinner\" (though it is of course not the child's fault as he or she couldn't choose how and where to be raised). Therefore it seems to be the better option to choose an embryo from a non-Jewish woman in order to avoid all of these issues. (By the way, the child still could convert to Judaism later in life, without all these complications, if he or she is interested ;-) </p>\n\n<p>I would like to recommend visiting the website of <a href=\"http://www.puahonline.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Machon Puah</a>.  They are a well-known institution in the United States and in Israel and research all kinds of questions involving fertility treatments and Jewish law.If you contact them, they might be able to give you more information. </p>\n\n\n",

The Arukh la-Ner (Sanhedrin 82a) says that Pinchas knew that he wouldn't become tamei, since Moshe told him to perform this action. The Panim Yafot (by the author of the Hafla'ah, Bamidbar 25:7) says that the reason Moshe did not perform the action himself is because he had the status of a kohen gadol, and therefore it wouldn't be permitted for him to become tamei, but Pinchas wasn't yet a kohen. The Kli Chemdah says that Pinchas was allowed to kill Zimri even though he was a kohen because he was saving all of klal yisrael. The Rogachover (Tzofnat Pane'ach Issurei Biah 12:4) says that the reason the chachamim objected to Pinchas's actions (according to the Yerushalmi) was because Pinchas was a kohen, and others could have done it. According to these approaches, in general it would be assur for a kohen to become tamei in such a case. </p>\n\n<p>However, Chavatzelet ha-Sharon (Bamidbar, p. 805) cites the Rogachover (Teshuvot Tzofnat Pane'ach, no. 235) who states that if the halachah of <em>bo'el aramit kanna'im pog'in bo</em> is a chiddush (i.e., something which should be assur but is nevertheless allowed), then it would be allowed for a kohen as well, and the Radak (Shmuel 2:23:20) who writes that Pinchas did become tamei, even though he was a kohen, but that it was mutar because of the mitzvah. According to these (minority) sources, it may be mutar for a kohen as well. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Um ... the Gemara makes it clear that a zealot acting in such a fashion does so at his own risk; had the fornicator turned around and killed the zealot in self-defense, the fornicator would not be charged with murder.</p>\n\n<p>Pinchas was risking getting killed, so I assume he would be willing to risk becoming Tamei.

How does that work?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Yes, a Reform Jew can absolutely transgress a mitzvah.

Reform (as taught today; I can't speak to early history) isn't about rejecting mitzvot.</p>\n\n<p>A Reform Jew reaches an understanding of halacha through a different path than others, and some may never reach it at all, but one who does is <em>exactly as liable for it</em> as any other Jew.  If I drive on Shabbat I am guilty of violating Shabbat; I don't get to say \"I'm Reform so I don't have to do that\".</p>\n\n<p>The difference is that for any random Reform Jew, we don't know what his understanding of Shabbat is.  So \"is it possible to violate Shabbat?\"  Yes.  \"Is that guy over there driving his car violating Shabbat?\" Yes, per halacha.  \"Does that guy over there driving his car believe he is violating Shabbat?\"  That depends on what he has accepted.  If \"that guy\" is Orthodox, on the other hand (and not uneducated etc), then we can presume that he agrees he is transgressing.

From the perspective of traditional Judaism, it doesn't matter whether they believe in the laws.  If they don't follow them, they are transgressing.</p>\n\n<p>From a Reform perspective, your description of Reform Judaism is inaccurate. The fact that hilchot Shabbos exist is indisputable. They're written in the Torah, therefore they exist. Reform Jews might deny their authenticity or their obligatory nature, but they cannot deny that they exist. As such, whenever a Reform Jew does something in violation of Shabbos, he is breaking Shabbos, even according to himself. He might not think that it matters though. </p>\n\n<p>The position of the Reform movement is not that halachot like those of Shabbos do not exist.

    "content": "# Halachah: What's the difference between this site and looking up a question in a book?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Per our oft-cited FAQ, and our frequent use of the disclaimer to consult one's own rabbi in matters of practical Halachah, we do not, <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1734/5\">as a matter of policy</a>, accept questions, or provide answers, relating to personal Halachic matters.</p>\n\n<p>But, while I agree with this policy generally, and a lay person could not confidently/competently, and therefore should not, consult a printed work of Halachah for a serious question about a complicated problem, much less ask strangers for an answer to such a question, what is so wrong about looking on <a href=\"http://mi.yodeya.com\">the internet</a> for matters of day-to-day Halachah and issues that are covered in plain terms in accessible, printed works (eg., Mishnah Berurah for common issues relating to Tefillah, such as arriving late; <em>Shemirath Shabbath</em>, aka <em>Shmiras Shabbos Kehilchasa</em>, for quick answers to common, practical questions on Shabbath)?  If someone would normally look in those books for the answer, but doesn't have it handy, is there something wrong or lacking in asking a community, and by extension an online community?  I've even seen questions posted on Facebook asking for Halachic advice.  If someone posts an answer with a link to an <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/10330/5\">authoritative text</a> for reference, is that not sufficient?  Note also that there are many, many websites geared <em>specifically</em> towards providing such answers.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Unless the rabbi you ask your questions to is one of the higher-tier rabbis, you are likely not receiving any original information. When you ask him if something is permissible or prohibited he is merely summarizing the books for you. Were you to follow up and ask him to elaborate he would probably cite a chapter and paragraph in the Shulchan Aruch, or other such authoritative works of Jewish law.</p>\n\n<p>To that end it is the same as Mi Yodeya. Here too when you ask a question you get a summary of the books. In fact, in that regard Mi Yodeya is better than an average rabbi because you will almost always receive the precise citation, often with a link to the page, where you can immediately look up the source. Additionally, when you ask the rabbi he might be answering you from memory, or might not have the precise source. As Mi Yodeya is \"peer-reviewed\" it is more likely that any mistakes will be caught than that your rabbi's mistake will be caught. Most importantly, when you ask your rabbi you are limited to one person's store of knowledge. Even if he is a great Torah scholar he is a human being with a limit to how much he can know. There are thousands of works of halacha and it is impossible for one person to even read all of them, let alone master them and remember them. And of course, an average rabbi knows much less than that. Most semicha programs cover parts of the 4 sections of Shulchan Aruch, with the Shulchan Aruch and the on-page commentaries being the main texts studied. There are so many other books of halakha, not to mention the thousands upon thousands of responsa that an average rabbi may have never studied. When you ask a question on Mi Yodeya, however, you can tap into the combined stores of knowledge of 1,000 users (or the hundred or so that actively participate). It is very likely that one of the users here will know a halachic source that your rabbi does not; it is very possible that you will get a more comprehensive answer here.</p>\n\n<p>In short, if you have a very weak learning background, or you need an immediate answer, you may be better off asking your rabbi and trust him and hope that he gives you the correct answer.  However, if you have a decent background in Jewish learning (i.e. you can comfortably navigate Jewish texts such as a Talmudic page or a responsum) and don't need an immediate answer I think you might be better off asking your question here. The answers you receive will direct you to relevant sources that you can then learn for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, I think the main reason that someone who learned in yeshivah for a number of years asks questions to a rabbi (aside from very serious questions) is that they don't have the time to learn through every sugya themselves, and/or they don't know offhand the specific sources to learn for a specific question. However, precisely these areas are where Mi Yodeya can have the advantage over an average rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>Of course this does not take into account methodological issues. For instance if you ask a question here and you find that the Mishnah Berurah says one thing while the Aruch Hashulchan says the opposite, how will you decide which one to follow? If you ask a rabbi he will probably tell you which way to act. However, I don't think the average rabbi is especially well-trained in this either, and anyway if you are stuck with a methodological question after learning the sources you can ask that on Mi Yodeya too!</p>\n\n<p>Of course if you don't feel comfortable relying on Mi Yodeya you can always ask your question here and then consult your rabbi afterwards.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a reason that פרקי אבות says עשה לך רב.</p>\n<p>Firstly, you don't know who is answering here.  If you ask your Rov, who you know personally, you know that you can trust his response.  Typically you will get a response with sources cited here, but I suspect that few people are going to actually go off and verify that these are a) matching the answer that has been posted and b) an authoritative source for halacha that is appropriate to be used.  There is peer review here, but you can't assume that every incorrect post will be caught by that.</p>\n<p>Secondly, your Rov will know you better and be able to put your question in context.  eg. I recently asked a Rov who knows me well whether I should make shehechiyanu on a new suit and he told me \"no\".  This answer is surprising, because typically people should do, but he knows that I absolutely hate wearing suits and I was just buying it because I felt I had to for my son's barmitzvah!  That might seem like a bit of a silly example, but personal knowledge can be very important in a lot of cases.  There can be factors where the normal halacha in a general case does not apply to someone due to their specific circumstances but they may not think to mention it or even be conscious of that.  Mental health issues are probably some very good examples, such as: -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A person who suffers from OCD asking about things like repeating davening if they aren't sure they remembered to say something, or hand washing etc.</li>\n<li>A person who suffers from social anxiety asking about whether they should lead the davening when they are in aveilus.</li>\n<li>A person who suffers from depression who asks about listening to music during the omer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Physical health issues can also affect the psak (eg. fasting) as can a number of other factors, and even if people are conscious of having a specific reason why the normal halacha may not apply to them, they may need reassurance that they shouldn't be following the general advice as they may feel guilty and/or need to overcome peer pressure.  Conversely, some people may exaggerate their situation and a Rov who knows them may be conscious of that - eg. a person who suffers from hypochondria.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I completely agree with @IsaacMoses's <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/29560/halachah-whats-the-difference-between-this-site-and-looking-up-a-question-in-a#comment73589_29560\">comment</a> above. In a situation where a person would normally just look up the answer in a book or online (e.g. what is the <em>bracha</em> for xyz) rather than ask a complicated personal question, I don't think there's any problem with following the advice found on this site. But it's difficult to have an official policy that makes such distinctions because it is hard to find a general rule that includes all of those exceptions. Therefore, it makes sense for the official policy to be that we don't give any practical advice.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I don't think there really is any difference between our site and a collection of <em>seforim</em>. But just like you wouldn't consult a <em>sefer</em> for a difficult question with many complicating factors, you shouldn't use this site for that question either. In that situation, consult a Rav.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Miswa of Lifne Iwer isn't what the words mean literally?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My fellow Jew (let's call him Bob) and I were discussing the Miswa of \"You shall not place a stumbling block in front of a blind person (Wayikra 19)\". Bob was saying that that verse was referring to the literal translation of the Miswa, meaning that it is Asur to place a stumbling block before a blind man <strong>because</strong> of this Pasuk. I responded that it means what Rashi quotes from the Mefarshim before him and it has nothing to do with literally placing a stumbling block before a blind person. Then Bob tells me to look at Onkelus which translates the Pasuk into Aramaic literally. I responded that that's not a proof. </p>\n\n<p>Summary:1) Does the Isur of \"Lifne Iwer\" also mean that you can't place a stumbling block before a blind person (I'm not asking if you're allowed to place a stumbling block, rather I'm asking if you did were you in violation of this Isur)? \n2)If I'm right then is there is any source for not placing a stumbling block in front of a blind man?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Note that the <em>Minchas Chinuch</em> says that literally placing a stumbling block before a blind person is not a (Biblical, at least) violation of this <em>avera</em> (according to what I've read in the \"Torah Lodaas\" weekly sheet by Rabbi Matis Blum; I didn't look up the <em>Minchas Chinuch</em> myself). However, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14061&pgnum=198\" rel=\"nofollow\">the <em>Meshech Chochma</em></a> disagrees, holding that placing a stumbling block <em>is</em> included in the Biblical prohibition.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=14092#p=20&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minchas Chinuch 232:4</a> discusses this, and raises the possibility that maybe he would be violating this lav by doing so. On the other hand, he also comments (quoting Korban Aharon) that if the verse meant this, it would have used the verb תשים rather than תתן, suggesting that in fact it has only the figurative meaning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe explains (Sichos Kodesh 5744 Parshas Kedoshim - although I think it was edited and printed in Lukutei Sichos somewhere) the reason that Rashi doesn't interpret the verse literally is that the literal understanding is already forbidden by the issur of <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9882/jewish/Chapter-21.htm#showrashi=true&v=33\" rel=\"nofollow\">וכי יפתח איש בור</a> which shows that it is ossur to be a mazik, so here it would be superfluous (and Rashi prefers to learn a new issur rather than say it is to make it one issur with two lavim).</p>\n\n<p>So from this, we could answer question #2, that it is included in the general issur of being a mazik. However, it should be pointed out that the Rebbe's approach to Rashi is that he is not halacha, and will learn a verse according to Pshat different than the halachic interpretation. We actually see this quite clearly with this question, as the halachic interpretation is well established, but still the Rebbe (and Sifsei Chachamim gives a different answer, but asks the same question) asking on Rashi why he doesn't interpret it literally - even though this is the established halachic understanding of the posuk.</p>\n\n<p>So it doesn't totally answer #2, but perhaps points to the direction to look for the issur in halacha.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sources for allowing/forbidding lifting and replacing the lid of a pot on a Blech or of a Crock-pot on Shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What are the sources that discuss whether or not one is allowed to lift and replace the lid of a pot on a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blech\">Blech</a>, or of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_cooker\">Crock-pot<sup>®</sup></a>, on Shabbos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I'm surprised by this question because there is extensive halachic decisions instructing us as to how we may add water to a pot of cholent, whether on a blech or in a crock pot.  Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, zt'l, for example, wrote a decision permitting the adding of water that was kept hot, but not as  hot as the contents of the cholent pot, to prevent a cholent from drying out.  Iggros Moshe O.C. IV:74:Bishul #1. Orchos Shabbos 1:1:17 cites others who are machmir about this.  The method there, I believe, involved taking water directly from the kli rishon to the cholent pot.  However, Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, zt'l, even allowed dispensing hot water into a clean and dry cup (kli sheini) to pour into the cholent.  Shemiras Shabbos 1:16.  These sources and others are cited on <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-CholentAGuidetoProperEnjoyment.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Star-K's website</a>.  Based on these sources, it would seem to me that you can't add water without removing the lid, so removing the lid on Shabbos must be permitted.  Consistent with that conclusion, I remember learning a shiur by Rabbi Gedaliah Anemer, zt'l, who was partial to a thicker cholent, where he said it was permitted to lift the lid of the pot to allow some steam to escape.  In all of the above cases, the lid is not removed until the cholent is fully cooked.</p>\n\n<p>However, apparently there are sources who would consider the simple act of lifting the pot cover (while the pot was still on the flame) to be <i>maygis</i> (stirring). See Bartenura (Shabbos Ch. 7, Mishna 2, s.v. haofeh), Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 254, 4 & 257, 4), Mishna Berura (254, 23 7 Biur Halacha 257 s.v. gorem), Mekor Chaim (118, 18), Shvisas HaShabbos (Mevashel 26, 81), Ketzos Hashulchan (124), Shu”t Igros Moshe (O.C. vol. 4, 74, Bishul 10), Chut Shani (Shabbos vol. 2, pg. 197), Shu”t Titz Eliezer, (vol. 7, 15), Shu”t Teshuvos V’Hanhagos (vol. 1, 207, 3), and Shmiras Shabbos K’Hilchaso (new print Ch. 1, 41).  These sources are cited in an on-line article by Rabbi Yehuda Spitz at <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/5294#_edn5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yeshivat Ohr Sameach's webpage</a>.  It is not clear to me whether these poskim are speaking only about before the cholent is fully-cooked, or whether they would still forbid taking the lid off after the cholent was fully cooked but before excess liquid had evaporated.</p>\n\n<p>These opinions to me seem to be contradictory.  Consult with your local Orthodox rabbi for guidance.</p>\n\n\n",

He writes that since God lasts infinitely, it is appropriate that one who sins against him be punished infinitely as well. And he notes that the passage in Rosh Hashana is consistent with this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אחר שהיתה כונתו לזלזל בכבודו של מלך ראוי שיהיה נענש כפי כונתו לא כפי הפעל המגיע ממנו בלבד, ולזה ראוי שיהיה העונש המגיע לרשע נצחי כמו שהשם יתברך נצחי ובלתי בעל תכלית</p>\n  \n  <p>וכן יראה שהוא דעת רבותינו ז\"ל שיש עונש נצחי מגיע לרשעים על פעל זמניי,\n  אמרו במסכת ראש השנה (י\"ז ע\"א) על קצת הרשעים שיורדים לגיהנם ונדונים בה\n  לדורי דורות, שיראה מזה שיש עונש נצחי </p>\n  \n  <p>Given that his intent was to degrade the honour of the king, it is appropriate that he be punished according to his intent, and not according to the result of his deed alone, and therefore it is appropriate that the punishment coming to man be eternal just as God is eternal and without limit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this appears to be the opinion of our rabbis OBM; that there is eternal punishment for the wicked based on their temporally finite actions. They said in Tracteate Rosh Hashana (17a) regarding a portion of the wicked who descend to hell and are punished there for generation after generation, that it appears that there is eternal punishment.</p>\n\n<p>This is also clearly the understanding of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Abulafia\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Meir Abulafia</a> who writes (Iggerot Ramah #46) that one shouldn't think that those who will be resurected at the resurection of the dead, will die again, since then their reward wouldnt be eternal. Indeed, the punishment of the wicked is eternal, as we see in the passage in Rosh HaShana, so a fortiori the reward of the righteous must be as well.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואין לומר שאחרי חיות הגופות לעוה\"ב ימותו שנית... שהרי אמרו חכמים לענין פרעון שלהרשעים שהוא לעוה\"ב בגוף וגויה שאין לו הפסק, כמאמרם (ר\"ה שם) יורדים לגיהנם ונדונים בה לדורי דורות...והדבר ידוע (סנ' ק' רע\"ב וש\"נ) שמדת הטובה מרובה ממדת הפורענות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Evidently, he understands that the punishment is literally eternal.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, a very similar passage in Genesis Rabba (ed. Albeck Parashat Vayechi: 97) is even more clearly talking about actual eternity than the passage in Rosh Hashana:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>באותה שעה יפרע הקדוש ברוך הוא מאומות העולם פורענות גדולה <strong>שאין לה הפסק ואין לה קץ ומורידן לגיהינם ונידונין בה לדורי דורות</strong> שנ' ויצאו וראו בפגרי )האנשים (שם /ישעיהו/ סו כד </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yonasan Hirtz, rabbi of Utopia Jewish Center, in Queens, lectured once that the rabbis' explanations of what happens after death is pure speculation.  \"No one knows what happens after death because anyone who knows is dead,\" he said. The purpose of the speculation, like many midrashim, is to help us prioritize our values.  One might believe that the rabbis' views were traditional teachings that Moses received at Mount Sinai and passed on as part of the oral tradition.  But I think not.  The Gemara at Rosh Hashana 17a (and the discussion before and after that page) do not specifically cite to such a tradition (although they do not always say), but rather use references to the words of the prophets to support their points.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, the Gemara at Rosh Hashana 16a makes reference to a prophecy in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16221/jewish/Chapter-3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malachai 3:21</a> (\"And you shall crush the wicked, for they will be as ash under the soles of your feet on the day that I will prepare, says the Lord of Hosts\") to support the position that the souls of the wicked are sent to Gehinom (Hell) for 12 months after death and then reduced to ashes in the flames, scattered in the wind, then becoming the dust that the righteous walk upon. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Rambam (<em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Repentance.3.6?lang=bi&with=Talmud&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Teshuva</em> 3:6</a>) seems pretty unequivocal that this is indeed an eternal punishment. Other <em>rishonim</em> such as the Ritva appear to distinguish between some of the members listed in this passage and indicate that heretics and apostates will remain in Gehinnom until Moshiach comes, at which point they will be brought about to witness the fulfillment of the things that they sought to deny.</p>\n\n\n",

If he was not going to answer our prayers, why would he answer this one?</p>\n\n<p>What does this blessing accomplish?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Here's one possible answer, from the commentary Maggid Tzedek on the siddur (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42811&st=&pgnum=134\" rel=\"nofollow\">link to page</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כדאיתא במסכת תענית (דף כה:): שמואל הקטן גזר תעניתא וירדו להם גשמים\n  קודם הנץ החמה. כסבורין העם לומר שבחו של צבור הוא. אמר להם: אמשול לכם\n  משל למה הדבר דומה, לעבד שמבקש פרס מרבו, אמר להם: תנו לא ואל אשמע קולו </p>\n  \n  <p>As is related in Masekhet Ta'anit (page 25b): Shmuel HaKatan decreed a\n  fast day [because of drought] and rain fell [in the early morning of the decreed\n  fast day] before sunrise [and therefore before the public had even\n  started offering their fast day prayers].

He [the master] said: Give him what he wants but just don't\n  make me have to hear his voice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So too here, we express the desire that, outside of any actual granting of our requests, the voice of our asking itself be privileged to be desired and not obnoxious.... The commentator goes on to offer several other answers, all different and all interesting.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Assuming we are referring to the requests we've made previously, there are still <em>ways</em> in which a request can be granted. Indeed we do not implore God \"accept our prayers\", but \"pity us and accept our prayers mercifully and amiably\". We could at very least be asking that our requests be granted in a nice way rather than a scornful one.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This question is based on the assumption that the reason a prayer wouldn't be accepted is because it isn't heard. However, Hashem hears it all. While you may not be Zoche for that request to be answered, you might be Zoche for this request to be answered. The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=44b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gemara in Sanhedrin 44b</a> specifically says that a person should always Daven that there be no obstacles in acceptance of his Teffila. The Maharal in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14202&st=&pgnum=118\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nesiv Hoavodah 12</a> explains this a bit.</p>\n\n<p>The ערבי נחל (I think) and other Chassidishe Sefarim explain that when we Daven we are clearing a clogged pipe, so to speak, because of some Kitrug. When we pray, we are opening up these channels, by means of our realization of how we are completely dependent on Hashem. See <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%9D_%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">מהר\"ל נתיב העבודה</a></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, even if a Tefilla won't do the job in its specific area, we ask a separate request to accept our Tefilla. If this one does its job it will help for the other in retrospect. Think of how you can run a debugging program that will fix the computer it is running on.</p>\n\n<p>We find this in the Pasuk in Shemos where it says Hashem heard their cries, remembered the Avos, saw their plight and knew. Later there is a different order because of the context. But we see that there are certain Zechusim needed for the acceptance of a prayer. We can pray for that, too.</p>\n\n\n",

The goal is \"tov\" (good), when your life has meaning, when your goal is something special then as a side product, you will find happiness. but happiness is not the goal of itself.

There is debate whether R Soloveitchik's opposition was matter of strict <em>halakha</em>, of <em>halakhic values</em> or of public policy but it came from multiple directions: deviation from customs, beginning of larger-scale reform, improper motivation, inauthentic practice, distortion of Torah, <em>non-halakhic</em> agendas, heterodox practices and community divisiveness.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar survey of R <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershel_Schachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Herschel Schachter</a>'s position (<a href=\"https://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2004/03/womens-prayer-groups-r-hershel_30.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), R Gil Student lists another set of drivers for his opposition to what he calls a \"improper and even dangerous innovation\", e.g., incomplete <em>mitzvot</em> (i.e., missing minyan and kaddish, <em>kedushah</em>, <em>barekhu</em>, repetition of the <em>amidah</em> and an official reading of the Torah), breaking from normative <em>halakhah</em>, impure motivations, lack of established custom, improper synagogue customs, imitating non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Goren\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Shlomo Goren</a> did write a responsa permitting women prayer groups (see <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/tfila/frimmer1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a summary which contradicts his arguments) but retracted it at the end of his life.</p>\n\n<p>As noted in the introduction, there are more restricted settings where women prayer groups might be appropriate and <em>halakhically</em> permitted (e.g., Rs Frimer <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/tfila/frimmer1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mention</a> R Moshe Feinstein permitting a <em>Megilla</em> reading (see also here from <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2012/10/womens-only-torah-reading/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Michael Broyde</a>), or the London <em>Beit Din</em> permitting <em>Kabalat Shabbat</em>, <em>Hallel</em> or a Torah reading without blessings, as long as this is done for pure motives).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do we explain the criticism of Rashi by his grandsons?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaki, better known today as Rashi, was easily the most prolific commentator on the Tanach and Talmud in history in the sense that he commentated on most of the Talmud and, I believe, all or most of Tanach (although his comments are typically short and sweet).  His interpretations of Biblical verses and the discussions of Talmud are so important to Jewish thought that they are still taught, nearly 1,000 years later, to students as young as 3rd or 4th grade and older students will typically look to Rashi's interpretations before other commentators.  </p>\n\n<p>What is fascinating though is that the Tosafists -- later Biblical and Talmudic commentators who saw their comments as supplemental to Rashi's -- and who include Rashi's own grandchildren, Rabbeinu Tam and Rashbam, often openly disagreed with Rashi.  Haim Perlmuter, in <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=ekh1FxWm39AC&pg=PA85&dq=Rashi%27s%20critics&hl=en&sa=X&ei=e0fLUaKYFZa-4APp1oGoAg&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Rashi%27s%20critics&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tools for Tosafos</a>, writes at p 14 that \"with all the honor they had for Rashi, they did not hesitate to disagree with him.\"  While as academics, I applaud their critical independence, but given the tradition of passing on the tradition from teacher to student, the general rule against contradicting one's teacher, and the fact that Rashi was the grandfather of Rebbeinu Tam and Rashbam, I would think that they would be more deferential to their grandfather.  How did they come to have such different views from their grandfather on so many topics?  Was he not their teacher or their teachers' teacher?</p>\n\n<p>Is it OK to poke holes in one's rebbe's books after he has passed away and cannot defend his work?  Perlmutter's book, at page 84, offers some possible answers, but I'd like to see more.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><em>A brief answer, which I'll update with sources, b'ezras Hashem, another time:</em></p>\n\n<p>A large part of it is a question of methodology. Rashi generally takes each piece of Gemara on its own terms and explains it in a way that fits in context; he generally doesn't attempt to compare/contrast it with other places in the Gemara. (In this he is similar to Rambam, who also takes the view in several of his responsa that if we have two statements in the Gemara that are contradictory, there's not necessarily a need to harmonize them; we simply accept one - whether based on the context in which it appears, or on other traditions as to how to decide the halachah - in preference to the other.)</p>\n\n<p>Tosafos, by contrast, is not satisfied with this approach, and so to them an explanation is valid only if it also fits with other places where the same or similar discussions take place. Very often, then, that is the nub of their argument with what Rashi says: they'll point out that a different Gemara makes a certain underlying assumption that implies the point of the question (or answer, or whatever) here to be something other than the way Rashi explained it.</p>\n\n\n",

Is there a clear, brief way to explain how long to expect to stay, perhaps taking into account what parts of the wedding the asker is [likely] most interested in being there for?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I don't recall having received such a query personally, but I believe that it's not an uncommon one. Our treatment of a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/287/how-long-is-a-jewish-funeral\">similar question</a> about funerals that I <em>was</em> asked become one of our few <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/help/badges/47/notable-question\">\"Notable\"</a> questions recently, indicating that it's something that people search for on the Internet. If you go to <a href=\"http://google.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Google</a> and start typing <code>How long is a Jewish</code>, Google suggests completions of first <code>wedding</code> and then <code>funeral</code>, indicating that people tend to search even more for answers to this question about weddings. It therefore seems worthwhile to be prepared to answer this question as well.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><sub>(I'm sure that different communities vary wildly, so I'll answer for the one I'm most familiar with, the Chabad community. Even in narrowing it to this, there will still be quite a bit of variation depending on locale, time of year, etc. If it's just the rabbi that's Chabad, and not the family, these rules will likely not apply.)</sub></p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br>\nA Chabad wedding can last between 3 and 6 hours, and occasionally more. You are not required to stay all the way.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There are four main parts to the wedding. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/477332/jewish/Kabbalat-Panim-Pre-Chupah-Reception.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kabbalas Panim</a>, Chupa, dinner, and dancing. Some people stay for all four, others, for just the second or third, and still others come for just the fourth. From start to finish, a wedding can run from 3 to 6 hours. Generally, family and close friends stick it all the way out, while others (especially those with children) often leave earlier. There are exceptions to both, and you're unlikely to offend anyone either way. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Kabbalas Panim</strong> is the reception. Usually held in two separate rooms, one each for men and women. Light refreshments are often served, the groom will repeat a <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/531523/jewish/Lecha-Dodi-Chassidic-Discourses.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">maamar</a> and the tenaim are read.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chupa!</strong> is the actual wedding ceremony. Very solemn until breaking the glass, then very happy. Usually takes place outside, and lasts anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes, depending on a number of factors (location, singing, weather, etc.) You <strong>won't</strong> get a chance to speak to the groom or bride, so if you want to wish them \"Mazel Tov!\" you'll have to stick around for the next part.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dinner!</strong> !רצה לבנינו, על כן התחתנו, בוא נאכל<br>\nWhile the bride and groom head to the yichud room to break their fast, you'll head to the dining hall. May be just inside the building, down the block, or across town. Usually one of the first two. Dinner feels like it must be between 45 and 75 minutes (I've never checked); the groom and bride will come out near the beginning. This may be your chance to wish them \"Mazel Tov!\" Often, the groom will go around the men's side with a bottle, offering people a L'chaim.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dancing!</strong> The part we've all been waiting for. As the band kicks up, everyone will head to the middle of the room for some serious hora. Ok, fine, it's not the hora. This part can get a little crazy, and by now you've probably lost your chance to speak to either of the couple, unless you're willing to stick it out till benching at the end. Dancing can run anywhere from 2 hours to 4+ (people will drop out of the circle throughout to rest and refresh). Since Chabad weddings usually start mid to late afternoon, the dancing often ends between 11 and 1 o'clock. There is no obligation to stick it out, and often by the end of it, many of the people remaining are relatives and close friends. Often there are bochurim, and others, still around, waiting to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkat_Hamazon\" rel=\"nofollow\">bentch</a> and say <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheva_Brachot\" rel=\"nofollow\">sheva brachos</a> at the end.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>Note: This is my experience, garnered from the weddings to which I've been. Feel free to correct anything I've gotten wrong or missed, or to broaden it to include your experience (for example, I have little knowledge of the kabbolas panim and what's going on on the women's side). If you feel this is similar enough to other customs and want include those, go ahead; just make sure to edit in which groups it applies to.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Matrilineal descent & Zera Israel\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Would someone with Jewish heritage from a distant foremother on their maternal grandfather's side be considered Zera Yisrael?</p>\n\n<p>In other words, does the person fit the definition of Zera Yisrael since their status as a Jewish person is in doubt, but it is acknowledged that they have Jewish ancestors?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50709&st=&pgnum=335&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">intro to chapter 5 in זרע ישראל by Rav Amsalem</a>, he describes Zera Yisrael as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש להם לרוב צד\n   יהדות ברור, שאביהם <strong>או סבם או סבתם</strong> וכדומה היו יהודים שנשאו נכריות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So he does include a Jewish grandparent in his definition. In almost every example after that, the book seems to uses the case of a Jewish father, but it seems that Rav Amsalem views it more broadly, with \"צד יהדות ברור\" (clearly somewhat subjective) as being the key deciding factor.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As I understand it, Zera Yisrael(Seed of Israel) IS a halachic concept, applicable to non-jews who are patrilineal descendants of Jews. That is, some forefather along their direct paternal lineage was halachically Jewish, whether it was one generation ago or a descendant of the Bnei Anusim of the inquisition period or anything in between. This can mean they are either direct paternal descendants or it can mean a distant forefather's mother was Jewish. However if the father is not a halakhic jew or paternal Zera Yisrael, the children are not Zera Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>So if the only Jewish heritage is on your <em>maternal</em> grandfather's side.. Even assuming so far that your maternal grandfather is a halachic Jew... it would at most make your mother a Zera Yisrael, but not you.</p>\n\n<p>I understand there is a lot of debate today, especially in the area of conversion of descendants of Bnei Anusim and other 'Crypto-Jewish' populations, and ESPECIALLY among paternal \"half-jews\".. whether Zera Yisrael should have a special status for an expedited conversion or even just be fully accepted as Jews. I am not informed enough to speak further on that.</p>\n\n<p>Still, if you are a potential convert with <em>any</em> Jewish heritage, or none at all for that matter, and you seriously want to become an official member of the tribe, you will be more than welcome.</p>\n\n\n",

This is from my memory of what he said verbally back then, so contemporary reality in various locations may vary. However, I think this information is sufficient to indicate that you can't just assume that all DD are kosher without reliable inside information.</p>\n\n<p>No, DD in outlets that are not under kosher supervision are not OK to eat. One issue is the provenance of the shortening. All of the branches use the same recipe to make the donuts, with all the same ingredients. However, you can have the same ingredient come in kosher and non-kosher versions.</p>\n\n<p>In the region that Rabbi Segal works in, all DD branches get their shortening, in packages produced specifically for DD, from a certain factory. That factory produces shortening on two different production lines, one of which is dedicated to shortening, and the other of which is shared between shortening and lard. Shortening produced on the former line is certified kosher, while shortening produced on the latter line is halachically considered to contain pork residue and is therefore not kosher. The factory thus produces two versions of its shortening packages, with the only difference being that one bears a notice of kosher supervision, while the other doesn't. One of the things that kosher-certified DD outlets do differently from non-certified outlets is that they [certifiably] only use the kosher shortening. So, there is a real chance that the donuts in the other branches are actually not kosher, even though they are made with the same recipe.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Why would you assume it's acceptable?

He takes a strong position against the validity of modern Kohanim's claim to the priesthood. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בעו\"ה אין לנו היחוס, כמו שהיה בזמן הבית. או אפילו אחר החורבן, בימי התנאים והאמוראים. שהיו עדיין נזהרים בתרומות ובטהרות, והיה קרוב מימי הבית. ועדיין היה יחוסיהם בידיהם. ובעונותינו מרוב אריכות הגלות וגזירות וגירושים נתבלבלו. והלואי שלא יהא נתבלבל זרע קדש בחול. אבל זרע כהנים ולוים קרוב לודאי שנתבלבלו. ואם לא כולו, הרוב נתבלבל, כמעשה דאליהו ז\"ל עם הלוים, הידוע בדברי רז\"ל. ואם לא הרוב, בודאי קרוב למחצה נתבלבלו. וא\"כ ניתי לידי תקלה, שמא יתן לכהן שאינו כהן. ויהיה עדיין כהקדש ממש<br>\n  Because of our many sins, we don't have proper lineage like they had in the times of the Temple or even after in the days of the Tannaim and Amoraim, for they were still careful with tithes and laws of purity and they were closer [temporally] to the Temple and still had their documents of lineage. And in our sins through the long time of the exile, decrees and expulsions we have become mixed up. [All we can hope for is that] we have not mixed up Jewish and not Jewish lineage, but the lineage of priests and Levites are almost certainly mixed up; if not all of them, at least most of them are mixed up...and if not most than close to half are mixed up. If so, we might have a problem if someone gives [<em>cherem</em> property] to a Kohein who isn't a Kohein, and the property will remain sanctified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Despite this extreme position, he concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובודאי בדיעבד...נותן לכהנים אפילו בזמן הזה, כמו שפסק הרמב\"ם. כי מכח האי חומרא לית לן רשות להפסיד ממון של כהנים. רק שלכתחילה יזהר.‏<br>\n  Certainly, after the fact [if one already declared something <em>cherem</em>], one should give the property to a Kohein even nowadays...because by virtue of this stringency [quoted above] we do not have the right to deprive Kohanim of their money. But from the outset, one should be careful [to not declare things <em>cherem</em>].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, if not for his issue with the lineage of modern Kohanim, he would be ok declaring things <em>cherem</em> for them even <em><a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/702/759\">lechatchilah</a></em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40933&st=&pgnum=137\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yam Shel Shelomo Chullin 8:4</a> he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין אנו נוהגין ליתנה אפילו לכהן קטן, וכ\"ש לגדול שטבל לקריו, דאין לנו היחס, ואין אנו יודעים אם הוא כהן אמיתי...‏<br>\n  We do not give [Challah from the Diaspora] to Kohein children and certainly not to an adult Kohein who has dipped in a Mikva [who are permitted to eat Challah of the Diaspora even if they have contracted other impurities per Shulchan Aruch YD 322:5] because we don't have [proper] lineage and we don't know if he is a real Kohein...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He goes on to say that we don't give Challah of the Diaspora to such a Kohein even on Pesach, where by not giving it to him to cook, we are forced to allow it to sit and become Chametz (cf OC 457)!</p>\n\n<p>What I don't understand if why he is so stringent regarding Challah of the Diaspora, where the prohibition of a non-Kohein eating it is rabbinic (and a weak rabbinic one at that), but he is willing to allow a Kohein to take <em>cherem</em> property, where the prohibition of a non-Kohein benefiting from it is a full-blown biblical prohibition. Am I misreading the sources? Don't both cases involve potentially depriving the Kohanim of their rightful property? Why is R Luria lenient by <em>cherem</em> but not by Challah of the Diaspora?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My own suggestion:</p>\n\n<p><em>Challah</em> of the Diaspora is rabbinic (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_First_Fruits_and_other_Gifts_to_Priests_Outside_the_Sanctuary.5.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchot Bikkurim 5:7</a>). <em>Charamim</em> (except for of land in Israel) applies nowadays (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Appraisals_and_Devoted_Property.8.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchot Arachim 8:11</a>) presumably biblically (otherwise I believe that Rambam would have noted its rabbinic status).</p>\n\n<p>Thus it makes sense that Maharshal is willing to deprive doubtful <em>kohanim</em> of rabbinically-mandated <em>challah</em>, as opposed to biblically-mandated <em>charamim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I note that Maharshal writes immediately before the piece you quoted from Yam Shel Shelomo Bava Kamma 5:35:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד נראה שראוי להחמיר ולאסור חרמים בזמן הזה אפי' פי' לכהן <strong>והכהן כבר קיבל</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>And it further seems that it is fitting to be stringent and forbid <em>charamim</em> nowadays, even if he specified that it is for the Kohein <strong>and the Kohein had already accepted it</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Putting that together with what he says later on, it sounds like he would advocate giving <em>cherem</em> property to a Kohein (to avoid causing a loss to the Kohanim) but that the Kohein who receives it should not actually benefit from it, due to the concern that he is not actually a Kohein.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Gentile coming to fix a fridge in a store on Shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Consider the following theoretical case.</p>\n\n<p>A Jew owns a number of supermarkets where he pays a set monthly fee to a service company that has non-Jewish workers come by and make regular check-ups on the refrigerators used in the store. The workers will come of course if something is broken and are called for it; however, they also come from time to time to check how things are working, whether anything is broken, etc. They can even come by when the store is closed: they have the key to the store. Their instructions are that, if they discover something broken on one of these inspection visits, they should fix it on the spot. The fridges obviously run all the time, including on Shabbos when the store is closed, and if they stopped working then the food stored within would go bad, resulting in a big hefsed (loss).</p>\n\n<p>Is it okay to have the non-Jewish workers lichatchila come by on Shabbos, even if they might have to fix something if they discover a broken fridge? Could a reason be since they are paid a set amount on a monthly basis? Or perhaps the fact that if they don't come inspect and fix the fridge it would lead to a big loss?</p>\n\n<p>(I'm asking only with respect to laws of Shabbos. Ignore laws of, for example, kashrus.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This case is similar to the idea of sending mail on <em>erev shabbos</em> when we know that it will be picked up by the mail carrier on <em>Shabbos</em>.  This question is addressed by the <em>Shulchan Arukh</em>.  From the article <a href=\"http://www.bknw.org/uploads/5/9/9/5/5995719/sending_mail_before_shabbos.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sending Mail before Shabbos</a> by Aryeh Lebowitz:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A. Regular mail. The Shulchan Aruch 247:1 explicitly rules that when there are\n  predetermined postal fees one may drop a letter in a mailbox on Friday. This is true even\n  if the letter is placed in the mailbox immediately prior to the onset of Shabbat. The\n  Mishna Berura (ibid.:3) explains that this is even permissible of the postman guarantees\n  next day delivery because the decision to deliver it on Shabbat is purely in the hands of\n  the non-Jew.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our situation is analogous.  As long as we do not tell the repair-man that he <em>must</em> come on Shabbos, there is no problem if he elects to do his job on Saturday. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In Shulchan Orach, Orach Chayim 244, there is a discussion of work done on premises of a Jew over Shabbat.  If it is publicly observeable, the Jew may not hire the non-Jew to do the work on Shabbat and must instruct him not to do it on Shabbat.  The fridge  may well be connected to the ground, and then definitely prohibited to fix on Shabbat (see seif 2 there), but even if not, it is large and may be comparable to the boat mentioned in seif 4.  In both of those cases, the discussion is about doing the work on the Gentile's premises, where it is known that the item being worked on belongs to a Jew.  Doing the work on the Jew's premises is more strict, as evident in seif 1.  </p>\n\n<p>If this supermarket is known in the community to be under Jewish ownership, it seems it is prohibited to let the fridge repair man come on Shabbat.  </p>\n\n\n",

According to the 5th century BCE Greek historian Herodotus, the Achaemenid Empire was divided into 20 districts or provinces called satrapies ruled by Medo-Persian satraps based on the various kings and governors of the conquered lands, and that different provinces would have different taxes imposed on them (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satrap#Medo-Persian_satraps\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>, <a href=\"http://www.livius.org/da-dd/darius/darius_i_t08.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">list of provinces as per Herodotus</a>, <a href=\"http://sitemaker.umich.edu/mladjov/files/persia500nbc.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">map</a>). </p>\n\n<p>Now, 20 provinces and 127 provinces are very different.

For example,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Do Teimanim use electricity on Shabbos?</li>\n<li>What do they do regarding date-lines?</li>\n<li>What do they do when they are in the far north where there is no sunset?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Do they follow other poskim in such cases? Do they have their own responsa where they try to deduce the Rambam's opinion?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><em><strong>(In order of your original question)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>First of all, I would like to correct an apparent misconception regarding the halakhic positions of traditional Temanim. While it is true that they they generally follow the Rambam as opposed to later authorities, at no time in their history did the Jews of Yemen follow the Mishneh Torah <strong><em>exclusively</em></strong>. Instead, the previous <em>Mara De-Athra</em> of Yemen - i.e. before the time of the Rambam - was the Rasag (Rav Sa`adia Gaon) and even then they followed other Gaonic opinions in many areas of halakhah. While there were strains of \"Rambamists\" in Teman who attempted to exclusively follow the Rambam in all matters, the sentiment never truly caught on, even among the <em>Dar Daim</em> of early 20th Century. </p>\n\n<p>(NOTE: When we speak of \"traditional Temanim\" in this regard, we are really talking about the <em>Baladhim</em> and not the later <em>Shami'im</em> who abandoned many of their ancestral traditions in favor of adopting Sefaradi practices based largely on the Qabbalah and the Shulhan Arukh of Rav Yosef Karo.)</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the problems of modernity, the problem for the Mishneh Torah is not so different from the Shulhan Arukh. In actual fact, Rav Karo merely quotes the language of the Rambam in about 85% of his code. So, what is difficult for one is difficult for the other. However, from my experience, Temanim who still follow the Rambam attempt to derive - using logic and the Gemara - the shitah of the Rambam for more modern halakhic issues. Rav Ratzon Arusi shlit\"a will often learn through the traditional sources, such as the Tur and the Shulhan Arukh, as well as modern <em>poseqim</em> like Rabbi Mosheh Feinshtein z\"l in order to determine the correct halakhic position in his estimation. </p>\n\n<p>In many instances, things which are \"issues\" for later codifiers of <em>halakhah</em> are simply non-issues in the halakhic formulation of the Rambam. So, they will simply disregard it and teach their communities that for the Rambam it was not an issue and that one is not required to worry about it.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>While there are groups of traditional Temanim who <strong><em>do</em></strong> use electricity on <em>Yomim Tovim</em>, there are none who use electricity on <em>Shabboth</em>. Those who use electricity of <em>Shabboth</em> are not Temanim at all, but only \"Rambamists\" who generally take a simplistic and almost \"Karaite-style\" approach to the text of the Mishneh Torah. An approach which has led to a multitude or errors - some of which are rather severe - among non-Temani [would-be] devotees of the Rambam.</p></li>\n<li><p>They handle the question in similar manner to other authorities. However, the premise(s) for determining any one position regarding date lines are taken from the Rambam as opposed to other authorities.</p></li>\n<li><p>The answer to this question is essentially the same as above.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As for modern halakhic commentaries and responsa, you can find thousands of such questions and answers on the following websites (which are in Hebrew ONLY):</p>\n\n<p>A. <a href=\"http://net-sah.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.net-sah.org</a></p>\n\n<p>B. <a href=\"http://moreshet.co.il\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.moreshet.co.il</a> - there are many <em>rabbanim</em> who contribute to this site, so click on the \"Ask The Rav\" tab, and then select \"Rav Ratzon Arusi\" to see his <em>pisqei teshuvah</em> according to the Rambam.</p>\n\n\n",

Please bring sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>There is a midrash in Bereshit Rabbah 39 where Avraham deduces the existence of God who created the world, and only then did God call out to Avraham <em>lech l'cha</em>.  A summary of the midrash from <a href=\"http://cellio.livejournal.com/584351.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">my notes after a class</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mashal: One day a man was traveling and he saw a tower (birah) \"on fire\" (doleket). He said, this tower has no owner? A man peeked out and said \"I am the owner\". Nimshal: The traveler is Avraham Avinu, who said: this world has no owner? And Ha-Kadosh Baruch Hu peeked out at him, saying: I am the ruler of this world.</p>\n<p>(My notes from the class:) According to this midrash, God didn't reveal himself to Avraham until Avraham reasoned that the world must have a creator/ruler and went looking. Avraham was a seeker; God didn't just speak to him out of the blue and say \"lech l'cha\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to this midrash, Avraham was inquisitive enough to deduce the existence of, and then seek out, the Master of the Universe.</p>\n<p>Another midrash (B'reishit Rabbah 42) offers a <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/800868/jewish/Who-Are-the-Hebrews.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">few different explanations</a> for the name <em>Ivri</em> (h/t Menachem).  One of these, attributed to R. Nechemiah,\nis that it comes from Eber, from whom Avraham learned the monotheistic tradition (passed down from Shem).  That interpretation contradicts the midrash above.  The other two explanations there are not related to this.  R.

Enosh himself was one of those who erred.\nTheir mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres with which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated them with honor, making them servants who minister before Him. Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat them with honor. [They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king.\nAfter conceiving of this notion, they began to construct temples to the stars and offer sacrifices to them. They would praise and glorify them with words, and prostrate themselves before them, because by doing so, they would - according to their false conception - be fulfilling the will of God.\nThis was the essence of the worship of false gods, and this was the rationale of those who worshiped them. They would not say that there is no other god except for this star.\nThis message was conveyed by Jeremiah, who declared (10:7-8): \"Who will not fear You, King of the nations, for to You it is fitting. Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. They have one foolish and senseless [notion. They conceive of their] empty teachings as wood;\" i.e., all know that You alone are God. Their foolish error consists of conceiving of this emptiness as Your will.</p>\n<p>Halacha 2</p>\n<p>After many years passed, there arose people - false prophets - who told [their nations] that God had commanded them to say: Serve this star - or all the stars - sacrifice to it, offer libations to it, build a temple for it and make an image of it so that all people - including the women, the children, and the common people - could bow to it.\nHe would inform them of a form that he had conceived, and tell them that this is the image of the particular star, claiming that this was revealed to him in a prophetic vision. In this manner, the people began to make images in temples, under trees, and on the tops of mountains and hills.\nPeople would gather together and bow down to them and the [false prophets] would say: This image is the source of benefit or harm. It is appropriate to serve it and fear it. Their priests would tell them: This service will enable you to multiply and be successful. Do this and this, or do not do this or this.\nSubsequently, other deceivers arose and declared that a specific star, sphere, or angel had spoken to them and commanded them: Serve me in this manner. He would then relate a mode of service [telling them:] Do this, do not do this.\nThus, these practices spread throughout the world. People would serve images with strange practices - one more distorted than the other - offer sacrifices to them, and bow down to them. As the years passed, [God's] glorious and awesome name was forgotten by the entire population. [It was no longer part of] their speech or thought, and they no longer knew Him. Thus, all the common people, the women, and the children would know only the image of wood or stone and the temples of stone to which they were trained from their childhood to bow down and serve, and in whose name they swore.\nThe wise men among them would think that there is no God other than the stars and spheres for whose sake, and in resemblance of which, they had made these images. The Eternal Rock was not recognized or known by anyone in the world, with the exception of a [few] individuals: for example, Chanoch, Metushelach, Noach, Shem, and Ever. The world continued in this fashion until the pillar of the world - <strong>the Patriarch Abraham - was born.</strong></p>\n<p>Halacha 3</p>\n<p><strong>After this mighty man was weaned, he began to explore and think. Though he was a child, he began to think [incessantly] throughout the day and night, wondering: How is it possible for the sphere to continue to revolve without having anyone controlling it? Who is causing it to revolve? Surely, it does not cause itself to revolve.\nHe had no teacher, nor was there anyone to inform him. Rather, he was mired in Ur Kasdim among the foolish idolaters. His father, mother, and all the people [around him] were idol worshipers, and he would worship with them. [However,] his heart was exploring and [gaining] understanding.\nUltimately, he appreciated the way of truth and understood the path of righteousness through his accurate comprehension. He realized that there was one God who controlled the sphere, that He created everything, and that there is no other God among all the other entities. He knew that the entire world was making a mistake. What caused them to err was their service of the stars and images, which made them lose awareness of the truth.\nAbraham was forty years old when he became aware of his Creator. When he recognized and knew Him, he began to formulate replies to the inhabitants of Ur Kasdim and debate with them, telling them that they were not following a proper path.]<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/912359/jewish/Avodat-Kochavim-Chapter-One.htm#footnote36a912359\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a></strong>**</p>\n<p>He broke their idols and began to teach the people that it is fitting to serve only the God of the world. To Him [alone] is it fitting to bow down, sacrifice, and offer libations, so that the people of future [generations] would recognize Him. [Conversely,] it is fitting to destroy and break all the images, lest all the people err concerning them, like those people who thought that there are no other gods besides these [images].\nWhen he overcame them through the strength of his arguments, the king desired to kill him. He was [saved through] a miracle and left for Charan. [There,] he began to call in a loud voice to all people and inform them that there is one God in the entire world and it is proper to serve Him. He would go out and call to the people, gathering them in city after city and country after country, until he came to the land of Canaan - proclaiming [God's existence the entire time] - as [Genesis 21:33] states: \"And He called there in the name of the Lord, the eternal God.\"\nWhen the people would gather around him and ask him about his statements, he would explain [them] to each one of them according to their understanding, until they turned to the path of truth. Ultimately, thousands and myriads gathered around him. These are the men of the house of Abraham.\nHe planted in their hearts this great fundamental principle, composed texts about it, and taught it to Isaac, his son. Isaac also taught others and turned [their hearts to God]. He also taught Jacob and appointed him as a teacher.\n[Jacob] taught others and turned [the hearts] of all those who gathered around him [to God]. He also taught all of his children. He selected Levi and appointed him as the leader. He established him [as the head of] the academy to teach them the way of God and observe the mitzvot of Abraham.\n[Jacob] commanded his sons that the leadership should not depart from the descendants of Levi, so that the teachings would not be forgotten. This concept proceeded and gathered strength among the descendants of Jacob and those who collected around them, until there became a nation within the world which knew God.\nWhen the Jews extended their stay in Egypt, however, they learned from the [Egyptians'] deeds and began worshiping the stars as they did, with the exception of the tribe of Levi, who clung to the mitzvot of the patriarchs - the tribe of Levi never served false gods.\nWithin a short time, the fundamental principle that Abraham had planted would have been uprooted, and the descendants of Jacob would have returned to the errors of the world and their crookedness. Because of God's love for us, and to uphold the oath He made to Abraham, our patriarch, He brought forth Moses, our teacher, the master of all prophets, and sent him [to redeem the Jews]. After Moses, our teacher, prophesied, and God chose Israel as His inheritance, He crowned them with mitzvot and informed them of the path to serve Him, [teaching them] the judgement prescribed for idol worshiper and all those who stray after it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>No doubt, tradition played an important part of Abram's first obedient response to God's command to get up and move from Haran, where he and his father's family had moved after leaving polytheistic Ur of the Chaldeans (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0111.htm#31\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereshit 11:31</a>).  Abram was not born into a \"religious\" vacuum, even though his father may not have been a believer in YHWH, the one true God.  </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Abram was an intelligent man, capable of rational thought and logic.  On more than one occasion he asked God intelligent and penetrating questions (see, e.g., <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0115.htm#2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereshit 15:2</a>-3 and ff.).  Then too he was a prosperous, blameless man (though not a sinless man) with a spotless reputation who lived in the midst of a culture of polytheism for much of his life.  He had \"smarts\" enough to go against the four kings of Genesis 14 and defeat them, after which he refused to receive a gift from the king of Sodom, saying </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Abram said to the king of Sodom: 'I have lifted up my hand unto the LORD, God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say: I have made Abram rich. (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0114.htm#22\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereshit 14:22</a>-23).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God would not have appeared to Abram had he not been both a believer in God and a sensible believer at that!  When YHWH made the promise to Abram to make his descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven, the Tanakh said, \"And [Abram] believed in the LORD; and He counted it to him for righteousness.\" (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0115.htm#6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereshit 15:6</a>).   </p>\n\n<p>I'd like to think that Abram had heard, through the lineage of Shem (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0111.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereshit 11:10</a> ff.), the story of the one true God who had by His word brought the created universe into existence <em>ex nihilo</em>, and that the story had been passed down from generation to generation, sometimes being met with faith and at other times not. </p>\n\n<p>Even if Abram had not heard of the one true God, and there is no particular reason to believe he had not, there is such a thing as \"the witness of God in nature,\" or \"natural revelation,\" as some theologians call it.  </p>\n\n<p>In the Tanakh, the Psalmist David put it this way,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork; Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night revealeth knowledge; There is no speech, there are no words, neither is their voice heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2619.htm#2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tehillim 19:2</a>-5).  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, unbelieving men and women are without excuse.  What is known of God is clearly evident to them; they choose, however, to suppress the truth and do what they consider natural by following their own lusts.  The prophet Isaiah called such people \"sheep,\" each of whom has \"gone astray\" and \"turned to his own way\" (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1053.htm#6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yeshayahu 53:6</a>).  If we all are honest with ourselves, we all (believers in the one true God and unbelievers alike) tend to stray from what we know to be right and choose to do what God commands us not to do.  (See <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2653.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tehillim 53:1</a>-3.)  </p>\n\n<p>One of the \"arguments\" agnostics and atheists use as a smokescreen (from my perspective, anyway) is the old </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"But what about the heathen?  If they have never heard of the one true God, how can God hold them accountable for something they have never heard of?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To that question, I suggest they at least consider what King David said in numerous Psalms (not only <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2619.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tehillim 19</a>, but also <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2608.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tehillim 8</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2633.htm#6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tehillim 33:6</a>-9 ff.).</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, then, Abraham, the great patriarch of faith, knew in his heart that there was one true God, the Creator and the Sustainer of all the earth.  He knew, moreover, that God is a just God.  That is why in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm#25\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereshit 18:25</a>, he asked  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Shall not the Judge of all the earth do justly?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All I can say to that is, Amen!</p>\n\n\n",

The practical difference between these two reasons is a blind person. If the reason is to cerebrate the new moon than the blind person should say the bracha. If the reason is benefit the blind person derives no direct benefit (although he does benefit from other people who benefit from the light of the moon so he should say a blessing according to some Achronim)</p>\n\n<p>Now in your case if you for what ever reason don't want to look at the moon - according to the Mishne Beruah who goes with reason #1 you still have to make the Brachah since you are no different than a blind person in this case. If with modern city lighting you still benefit from the moons light than even according to reason #2 you would have to make the Bracha but my experience is that the city lights drown out the effect of the moon.

Elazar taught that harm will not befall a Shali'ach (someone on the way to do a) Mitzvah!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is a short excerpt from a discussion about being protected when doing a mitzvah in the context of searching for chametz before Pesach where there might be a danger. It seems to say that if someone is going to do a mitzvah, unless there is something especially dangerous, one is protected from harm.</p>\n\n<p>Of what degree of protection does it speak? Protection from death? Major injury that wouldn't heal (loss of limb)? Major injury that doesn't have a major long term effect (hip fracture that is set but has residual minor long-term effects)? Temporary injury (broken toe that gets set and fully healed)? Even temporary minor injury (paper cut)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From the ברייתא cited further in the Gemara, it would appear that any and all damages, even of the slightest and likeliest nature and occurring anywhere on one's property are included in this discussion (at least according to the opinion voiced there, although there is no contradictory sentiment earlier in the discussion that I've detected) [text of Rashi follows that of the Gemara]:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא: <strong>איסי בן יהודה אומר: כלפי שאמרה תורה \"ולא יחמד איש את ארצך\",\n  מלמד שתהא פרתך רועה באפר ואין חיה מזיקתה, תרנגולתך מנקרת באשפה ואין\n  חולדה מזיקתה; והלא דברים קל וחומר, ומה אלו שדרכן לזוק אינן ניזוקין,\n  בני אדם שאין דרכן לזוק על אחת כמה וכמה; אין לי אלא בהליכה, בחזרה מנין,\n  תלמוד לומר: \"ופנית בבקר והלכת לאהליך\", מלמד שתלך ותמצא אהלך בשלום.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>כלפי שאמרה תורה</strong>: מתוך <strong>שאמרה תורה</strong> כך, אנו למדים שהבטיחו הכתוב שלא יוזק ממונו, וכל שכן גופו ד*<em>אין דרכ</em>*ו <strong>לזוק</strong>, דאדם אית ליה מזלא\n  ואינו מהיר להיות ניזק בגופו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To quote the outline on the page you provided in your question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Beraisa - Isi ben Yehudah): \"V'Lo Yachmod Ish Es Artzecha\" teaches\n  that one [who goes to Yerushalayim for the festival] may leave his cow\n  grazing in the dirt and his chicken pecking in the wasteheap, and\n  Chayos and weasels will not attack them;</p>\n  \n  <p>It is normal for animals to be damaged, yet the Torah promises that\n  they will not be [due to the Mitzvah].

Practically, as soon as we hear \"flavored beer\" we get worried what might be in there. Without any further information I wouldn't buy a non-hechshered \"coffee-flavored beer\" at the store for that reason. However if you're certain the only ingredients are wheat, barley, coffee beans, hops, yeast, and water, <em>and the equipment isn't used for anything else</em> (are you brewing your own?), I can't see the issue. </p>\n\n<p>(With regards to both coffee and beer, the question is raised  [Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 38:12] why they're not prohibited under the ban on gourmet-food-cooked-by-non-Jews. The answer given to both is that the main ingredient is water, which doesn't need cooking! I thus can't see how coffee-with-beer would be any different.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have asked both the OU and the CRC about this. It would make sense that since unflavored beer doesn't require a hechsher and certain ingredients themselves don't require one that beer with them shouldn't require a hechsher. The example I asked about was coffee. The answer from both was that beer companies need to make it known when they flavor their beer and once it is flavored then it is possible there was also flavoring that was non kosher added as well. Here are the email conversations I had with them...</p>\n\n<h2>The OU</h2>\n\n<p>My email: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The standard for beer has always been than unflavored beer requires no certification but flavored beer does. Understandably from the understanding some flavors are created by non kosher sources. However, I have not come across a good answer as to why all flavored beer requires certification as many of those ingredients added on their own wouldn't need certification such as coffee, coriander seeds, or orange peels. Thank you for your help, it is greatly appreciated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The OU's response:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thank you for contacting the OU.</p>\n  \n  <p>The flavors come as industrial flavors. All flavors require certification. Please do not hesitate to contact us again should you have any further questions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>To the CRC</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So the standard for beer i have heard repeated many times is that unflavored beer does not require a hechsher but flavored beer does. This makes sense in many cases but I have to ask why for coffee beer? Coffee beans don't require a hechsher and so why would a beer that has coffee beans put in it require one?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The CRC's response...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hi Kyle,</p>\n  \n  <p>Thank you for contacting the cRc with your beer question.</p>\n  \n  <p>All flavored beer requires hashgacha due to kashrus concerns. Once a company adds even a simple flavoring, we don’t know what else they are adding. \n  Hatzlacha,</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Akiva Niehaus</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My follow up question to the CRC...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By that logic theres no way to tell if any beer without a hechsher added something extra in. My question is about when they have added ingridients which don't require a hechsher such as coffee? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The CRC's response...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Beer which has added flavorings must declare so on the label. Once they declare that they have flavorings, there are two issues – perhaps the stated flavoring isn’t kosher and perhaps they are adding additional flavorings which may also not be kosher. \n  Rabbi Akiva Niehaus</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Coming at the answer from a different angle, I once asked a brewery about a coffee stout and what other ingredients might be in it. I received this response:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don't think the Coffee Stout would fit the Kosher diet as there are food grade dairy sweeteners that we purchase. The coffee is not made by us but is on dedicated equipment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This confirms the concern other answers have expressed that once a beer is flavored, it opens the possibilities for many other unknown and possibly non-kosher ingredients.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What does it mean that God will blot out sinners from his book?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parshat Ki Tisa, after the golden calf, Moshe pleads for God to forgive them, saying if not, blot me out of your book.  The text then <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0232.htm#33\" rel=\"nofollow\">says</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>33 And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Whosoever hath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My book.<br>\n  34 [...] nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.' </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9893/showrashi/true#v32\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemot 32:32</a> says that the book in question is the whole torah.  He is silent on v33 and blotting out.  He explains the latter passage <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9893/showrashi/true#v34\" rel=\"nofollow\">thus</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>But on the day I make an accounting, etc.:</strong> Now I have listened to you not to destroy them all at once, but always, always, when I take an accounting of their sins, I will also account a little of this sin with the other sins. [This means that] no punishment befalls Israel in which there is not part of the punishment for the sin of the [golden] calf. -[from Sanh. 102a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So clearly God <em>punishes</em>, but this doesn't sound much like \"blotting out\".  After all, we have the torah text, including the names of some of the participants and the descriptions of their sins:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Aharon is named specifically as making the calf.  Clearly he was not blotted out of the torah.</p></li>\n<li><p>It seems by inference that Levi was the only tribe that didn't participate, but the torah names the heads of the other tribes (and other individuals, like the spies) later, so none of them were \"blotted out\".</p></li>\n<li><p>A weaker point: sefer Bamidbar in particular names other sinners (like Korach et al) and tells us about their sins.  Perhaps \"whosoever hath sinned against me, him I will blot out\" only applies to the past (the calf)?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What does it mean when it says God will <em>blot out</em> sinners from his book?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><strong>Notice the verse's wording</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>'Whosoever hath sinned <strong>against Me</strong>...'</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>See also <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/babakamma/babakamma_79.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bava Kama 79b</a></strong> in which the Sages explain that a burgular pays twofold as opposed to a robber, because at least the robber shows a uniform disdain for authority, stealing before Gd and men unabashedly. The burgular on the other hand fears men only, stealing with subterfuge, but has no fear of Gd, from which no one can hide.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9893#v=20&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Rashi says</strong> in his commentary on Exodus 32:20</a> there were different punishments for different levels of sin. People who were warned before witnesses were killed by the sword, as was done by an idolatrous city, (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9977#v=16\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deut. 13:16</a>). Others who acted before witnesses without warning were killed in a plague, (Ex. 32:35). Others who acted without witness or warning were given the water with the calf's ashes to drink, and had their stomachs burst if they were guilty, like the sotah, (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9933#v=27\" rel=\"nofollow\">Num. 5:27</a>).</p>\n\n<p>In <strong>verse 28</strong>, the body count of those slain by the sword is given, at 3000. In <strong>verse 35</strong>, the plague is described, but we are not told how many perished. Those killed by the calf's water <strong>aren't mentioned in the verses of Gd's book at all.</strong> We need Chazal to to inform us that such sinners even existed!</p>\n\n<p><strong>I would argue that the erasure of sinners from the Torah occured in varying degrees, dependent upon how delinquent they were in their fear of Gd, specifically as opposed to their fear of man.</strong> So I am understanding the concept of 'sinning against Gd' in the verse as sinning only before Gd but not before man, disregarding the Former, yet fearing the latter.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Those who were warned before witnesses and still sinned</strong> were essentially proven 'robbers'. They did not fear Gd, but they showed\nthat did not fear people either. Thus their deaths are mentioned and\nconsidered in the verses.</li>\n<li><strong>Those who were not warned, but who acted before witnesses</strong> were not tried and true. They sinned publicly, but in a way that they\nwould be acquited of capital punishment. So while they didn't care \nwho <em>saw</em> them sin (Gd or man), they feared human punishment over\nDivine Retribution. So their deaths by plague are mentioned in broad strokes,\nbut they are not ennumerated as individuals; a partial erasure, as\nthey did 'sin against Gd', albeit not completely.</li>\n<li><strong>Those who sinned with neither witness nor warning</strong> were the burgulars. They feared human punishment, and even feared being seen by\ntheir fellows sinning, yet they had no regard for Gd at all. Having\ncompletely fulfilled 'sinning against Gd', they were completely\nerased from the Torah.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since everyone who sinned in any way was killed, it would stand to reason that anyone who was not punished in this way was not considered to have sinned, at least not in the capacity that their names be erased, so Aaron, the Princes, the Spies, and other named personalities are safe...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Or maybe not!</strong> <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9973#v=20&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi on Deuteronomy 9:20</a>, where Gd's anger with Aaron is detailed, says that Gd intended to kill Aaron's 4 sons, but that Moses was able to save Elazar and Ithamar with prayer. Perhaps you could interpret blotting out of a name more figuratively as blotting out of a bloodline and legacy. So Aaron's (and perhaps others'), legacies were blotted out, albeit only to an extent in Aaron's case, thanks to Moses' selfless prayer. <a href=\"http://www.tsel.org/torah/midrashraba/tsav.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Leviticus Rabbah 7:1</strong></a> corroborates this idea.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The above midrash</strong> also says that Aaron's named <em>is</em> erased! Throughout the first 5 chapters of Leviticus, Aaron is not mentioned directly by name, only \"<em>the sons</em> of Aaron\". Moses loving prayer for his brother nullifies this decree at the beginning of <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0306.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviticus 6</a>, where at last Aaron is mentioned directly.</p>\n\n\n",

For various reasons, Uzziyahu thought that because his grandfather Yoash had lived among kohanim as a child while in hiding from Ataliyah, this tied him into the kehunah and the reason he wasn't a Kohen Gadol was because Yehoyadah wed him two wives (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.13a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">and a KG cannot be married to two women at the same time</a>) and because he cut part of his ties to the kehunah by killing Zecharyah. Yet for all of his various calculations, King Uzziyahu was wrong, and for this he was punished.</p>\n<p>But because he was loved by Judea, his punishment of tzara'at - seemingly at the hands of the kohanim - angered the people, and this is what brought upon \"however, the people still acted corruptly\" in the time of Yotam (as R' Marcus points out, it doesn't say that the people were corrupt in the time of Uzziyahu. From here we see that it was a reaction to what happened when Uzziyahu came to the Mikdash and got tzara'at).</p>\n<p>But even if only taken at basic pshat value (that is, that the people were corrupt in the usual sense of the term, and not out of loyalty to the beloved former king), there was still a lot of turmoil going on in those days.</p>\n<p>Amotz may have even foreseen what went on in the time of King Achaz, who was an evil king<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.28.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DH 2:28:1-4</a>) but also suffered greatly at the hands of Aram and Yisrael (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.28.5?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DH 2:28:5-8</a>), Edom and Plishtim (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.28.17?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DH 2:28:17-19</a>) and Ashur (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.28.20?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DH 2:28:20</a>) or what happened in the days of King Chizkiyahu, who, though being a good king, was nevertheless attacked by Ashur (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.32.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DH 2:32:1-22</a>).</p>\n<p>Perhaps Amotz even saw <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.49b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yesha'ayahu's demise at the hand of Menashe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.20.1?lang=he&p2=Berakhot.10a.30&lang2=he&w2=all&lang3=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amotz's great-grandson and Yesha'ayhu's grandson</a>.</p>\n<p>To summarize, there were certainly a lot of dark clouds and geo-socio-political and religious struggles and turmoil in those days and a prayer for extra protection from Hashem for their son is very fitting, especially considering that he, like them, was a member of the family who was most in the center of all of these events: the royal family, and especially considering that he, too, became a prophet, which, depending on the era, was, at times, a controversial position to have.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> It says in the gemara that out of Tamar kings and prophets will come forth; and miut rabim shnayim (the smallest plurality is two)- Yesha'ayhu is one and Amotz is two.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Rabbi Marcus even makes him out to be the \"Apostmos who burned the Torah\", explaining that Apostmos is a scribal mistake and was originally apostatus, apostate, and goes on from there.</p>\n\n\n",

This is also brought by Rabbi Nachman Goldschmidt of Techerin in Parparot l'Chochmah, section 111.</p>\n<p>In midrash and other places, the Jewish people are compared to a single individual, like in the concept of כל ישראל ערבים זה לזה. This same concept is why for example we say Viduy in the plural instead of the singular and confess to things that we may not be individually guilty of committing. Rabbi Moshe Cordevero explains that confessing to something you have no connection to is a false confession and is prohibited. But because the Jewish people are all one, spiritually and physically, we can make the entire Viduy truthfully.</p>\n<p>Each individual corresponds to a particular limb or part of a limb. This idea can also be seen in parshat Shoftim (Shemot 18:21,25) where the judges are also referred to as 'head' and are compared to the eyes of the community (עיני העדה). In the commentaries to this citation, it explains that these \"judges\" are referring to the establishment of the Sanhedrin which is headed by the Nasi.</p>\n<p>In the specific case of the individual called Rebbe, it is the idea of the complete head, from which life flows out to all the other limbs. This follows the explanation of Rabbi Yosef Caro in Maggid Mesharim on parshat Ki Tisa and also Yalkut Shimoni on Tetzaveh 376.</p>\n<p>And this concept is also associated with the idea of the term 'Nasi', which is referred to in Aramaic in the case of the tribes as 'אמרכל' which translates as 'speaking for the whole'.</p>\n<p>Nasi, like Rebbe, is another Roshei Teivot meaning 'Nitzutz shel Yaacov Avinu', a spark of Yaacov avinu. The Lubavitcher Rebbe brings this from Sefer Kehilat Yaakov in his talk from the 10th of Shevat, 5722, which can also be found in Likkutei Sichot, volume 4, page 1051, note 18.</p>\n<p>Sefer Kehilat Yaakov by Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi Yolles of Dinov explains the origin of the word \"Rebbe\" and clarifies why they referred to Rebbe, meaning Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi as Nasi. He associates the title of Rebbe to that of Nasi and explains that the source of this title (Nasi) is because he is a spark of Yaakov Avinu (נצוץ של יעקב אבינו).</p>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe goes on to explain that the Kehilat Yaakov is basing this upon what is found in Bava Batra 58a which compares the beauty of Yaakov Avinu to that of Adam HaRishon. Just as all mankind came from Adam HaRishon, so too all the tribes of Israel came from and were connected to Yaacov, and so too all the Jewish people are connected to the Nasi of their generation.</p>\n\n\n",

I've come across two sources that shed some light on both issues: one from Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, and one from Alexander Poltorak, a Jewish theoretical physicist.</p>\n<p>In Rabbi Kaplan's <em>The Age of the Universe</em>, he proposes that according to the Sefer HaTemunah, as it is interpreted in the Sefer Livnas HaSapir (according to Rabbi Kaplan, the \"most authoritative interpretation\"), we are in the 7th sh'mitah cycle of 1000 years. Under this interpretation, the world was 42,000 years old when Adam was created. Naturally there are many different interpretations of the Sefer HaTemunah, so this answer is only meant as an introduction of Rabbi Kaplan's article, in which he examines many such interpretations. However, Rabbi Yitzchok deMin Acco argues that the years in the Sefer HaTemunah are G-d's years, since they preceded man. This view Rabbi Kaplan combines with the Sefer HaSapira to argue that therefore the Sefer HaTemunah is speaking of 42,000*365,250 years, or about 15 billion years. Meaning the universe existed for 15 billion years before Adam, whatever the nature of these \"years.\"</p>\n<p>The second article I would point you towards is <a href=\"https://quantumtorah.com/towards-reconciliation-of-biblical-and-cosmological-ages-of-the-universe/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. The premise is quite simple. Quantum Mechanics says the collapse of the wavefunction is caused by observation. Poltorak posits here that it's not the physical observation, per say, but consciousness deriving from the G-dly soul within man (and here he departs from other QM consciousness interpretations that theorize animal consciousness is enough to cause collapse). It's important to note that wave collapse by consciousness is just as valid an explanation empirically as any other interpretation of QM. Under this interpretation, until the first observer with a G-dly soul, Adam, the universe existed in a probabilistic superposition of all possible universes. Therefore, there were an infinite number of potential universes, one for each theoretically possible universe, that were \"created [by G-d] and destroyed\" when Adam's consciousness limited reality to just one single, tangible universe.</p>\n<p>Putting the two together, one possible interpretation of the 974 generations before Adam is that they existed and didn't exist simultaneously. Being animal man, and lacking the Image of G-d and/or the Breath of G-d, they could play no role in the collapse of the universal wavefunction, and therefore where \"stuck\" in that immaterial state described by the probabilistic wavefunction. Not until Adam was there a conscious observer, and therefore, the age of Creation is counted from Adam, meaning the number of years since he collapsed the universal wavefunction. But since that collapse materialized ~13 billion years of history, the universe has two ages, each representing a different perspective. Naturally, the \"truest\" one is the number of years since Adam. Under this interpretation, the 974 generations of \"wicked\" men are the conscious-less homo-sapiens that \"existed\" before Adam, but were only materialized when Adam first observed the world.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that any of this must be correct. That's a task for brighter and more scientifically and Kabbalistically educated minds than me. But seeing your question, and having come across these two Jewish sources from in my own searchings, it would be wrong not to share them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My rabbi, who is now passed put it as follows:\n(he was also a physicist back in the day)</p>\n\n<p>this reply was given when he was asked about the nature of teshuva, and whether it is akin to having ones bad deeds simply erased from ones book of history?\nNo, said he, \"teshuva is Gd recreating your individual world anew from day one of creation, which includes that individual life story, minus the sin event\"</p>\n\n<p>which sparked a debate about how Gd can do such a thing-recreate the universe.\nand among other topics this came up as well:</p>\n\n<p>the 974 destroyed and recreated worlds is not only an event which happened back in time, but an ongoing immense  fission reaction of unimaginably massive proportions, which occurs constantly, to buffer the infiniteness of Gd and allow the finite universe to exist at all.</p>\n\n<p>This mind bending concept is variously described in human terms in many ways, but all attempts to describe a physical action are too large to fathom, except by pure meditation on how Gd did and does create the universe, and sustain it.</p>\n\n<p>The kabala talks of the tsimtsum-constriction, and various commentators describe this visually, but in order to fully appreciate the gravity of such a concept one must first attempt to attempt to appreciate how large Gd is, if at all possible.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes, there are many Jewish legends that say other worlds ended and were followed.

As the Shulkhan Aruch states (OC 85:2):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א אפי' להרהר בד\"ת, אסור בבית הכסא ובבית המרחץ ובמקום הטנופת, והוא\n  המקום שיש בו צואה ומי רגלים. <strong>הגה:</strong> ואפי' הלכות המרחץ אסור ללמוד במרחץ\n  (ר\"ן פ' כירה וב\"י בשם א\"ח). דברים של חול, מותר לאמרם שם בלשון הקדש.\n  וכן הכנויים, כגון רחום, נאמן וכיוצא בהם, מותר לאמרם שם; אבל השמות\n  שאינם נמחקין, אסור להזכירם שם. ואם נזדמן לו שם להפריש מדבר האסור,\n  מפריש, ואפילו בלשון הקודש ובענייני קודש. <strong>הגה:</strong> ובמקום שמותר להרהר בד\"ת,\n  מותר לפסוק   דין ובלבד שלא יאמר טעמו של דבר (ר\"ן פ\"ק דשבת ובפרק כל\n  הצלמים.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is even forbidden to think of Torah matters when in the bathroom or in a bathhouse or in some place of filth, which is a place where there is feces and urine. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Rama:</strong> And it is even forbidden to learn Torah in a bath (cf. Ran). </p>\n  \n  <p>It is permissible to refer to Hashem matters in the holy language\n  [Hebrew]. And those names, like Rachum, Neeman, and their derivates are allowed\n  to be said. But for names that can't be erased, it is forbidden to\n  bring them up. If it happens that he needs to separate himself from\n  something forbidden, he should separate from it even if that includes\n  the holy language and holy matters. [<strong>Mishnah Berurah</strong>: if a sinful\n  thought entered his heart, you're allowed to think of Torah matters\n  because that is like setting aside a prohibition; the Torah saves you\n  from the evil thought] </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Rama</strong>: And in a place where it is permissible to think of Torah matters it is permissible to render judgments as long as no reason is provided\n  (cf. Ran). [<strong>Mishnah Berurah</strong>: For example, in the adjoining room to the bath or if he himself is not completely clean because, for example, his hands touched a covered part of his body. But if his hands or other places on his body are <em>mamash</em> disgusting, even thinking is prohibited.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if you are not allowed to say God's name, you can't say a blessing. And not only can you not study Torah aloud, you're not even allowed to <em>think</em> about Torah matters.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, there are many provisions to these halakhot. For example, the sugya in Brachot 25 (which is where the halakhot of odors are brought down) mentions certain animals as being under the same category as human feces, while others may not necessarily be included. Additionally, some odors which are not natural decomposing wastes might not be included in these prohibitions. So, you have to define what you mean by a \"bad smell.\" If you mean feces and urine, then all five activities are prohibited.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Mordechai Willig cites it for theory's sake in <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/792756/Rabbi_Mordechai_I_Willig/Tzeniut,_Haircovering,_&_Kol_Isha_in_Modern_times#\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an mp3 on tzniut</a>, exclaiming his surprise.)</p>\n\n<p>Well, the prohibition is based on avoiding people who are <em>erva</em> (prohibited relations). Your cousin is not a prohibited relation per se, however once she (or any other unrelated woman) reaches menarche that changes. So around 11 seems quite reasonable.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein elsewhere wrote that with regards to extended families that do lots of hugs, we view it as gross, but not risque, for a grown brother and sister to hug and kiss. We still prohibit it, but there's some more room for leniency in cases of non-observant family who will be offended, or how much the rabbi should protest such behavior.</p>\n\n<p>As Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveitchik famously said, halacha is a floor not a ceiling; all halacha aside, there will be dictates of good judgment and taste regarding what forms of touch are appropriate, in what contexts, with what age of cousin under the age of 11. It appears that Torah.org says \"find a good publication that goes into all sorts of detail on that\"; it doesn't surprise me that various contemporary rabbis have tried to record guidelines for every situation, but at some point we hope the answer is simply \"use good judgment.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>R' Doniel Neustadt <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5758/bhaloscha.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">writes</a> that the negiah prohibition begins when my cousin turns three.

You see, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negiah#Contemporary_formulations\" rel=\"nofollow\">further on</a>, the Wikipedia article continues:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Feinstein elaborates the two prohibitions underlying the laws of negiah. The first law is derived from a Biblical prohibition against close contact (קרב qarab) with arayot, as described above. Because all women above the age of 11 are presumed to fall into the category of illicit relationships due to menstruation <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=916&pgnum=68\" rel=\"nofollow\">(<em>Igros Moshe</em> O.C. 1:26)</a> it follows that the negiah prohibition extends to all women above that age, not only to the other illicit relationships prohibited by the biblical text.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(This post is community wiki.

    "content": "# Why do korbanot require/allow exceptions from Shabbat restrictions?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Someone recently asked me why we keep Shabbat restrictions now if violation of those restrictions was clearly necessary to burn korbanot in the Beit Hamikdash.</p>\n\n<p>My knee-jerk response is: God said so. He said that we have to keep these restrictions, and He said that we have to bring these korbanot, including on Shabbat. This is, of course, the first-order reason why our practices include this <em>apparent</em> contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>However, I think it would be much more edifying - to the asker and also to me, now that my curiosity is piqued - if I could also explain <em>why</em>, to the best of our traditional knowledge, God made the rules that way. (To my surprise, I was unable to find anything directly addressing this point in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Hirsch</a>'s commentary in some parts of the Torah where Shabbat is juxtaposed with the Mishkan and its service, such as <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9896#v=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 35:1-2</a> or <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/showrashi/false/aid/9956#v=9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Numbers 28:9-10</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are traditional conceptual understandings of why we take actions that are normally forbidden on Shabbat in order to bring korbanot?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In his book <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1608997766\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"The Temple\"</a> Joshua Berman deals with this question around page 13-17. </p>\n\n<p>Shabbat and the Temple/Mishkan are directly interconnected with each other.  While we do things which are not allowed on Shabbat outside of  the Temple, the construction of the Temple itself can not be done on Shabbat.  One of the purposes of Shabbat is the Temple, and one of the purposes of the Temple is Shabbat. (One name for the Temple is the Beit Menucha)</p>\n\n<p>By violating Shabbat for the activities of the Mikdash , and by defining Shabbat by the activities of the Mikdash, this connection and purpose can be felt directly.</p>\n\n<p>And what is the connection between Shabbat and the Temple that is so important? Both are the pinnacle of the world's creation, and the defining thing which teaches us about the concept of Kodesh.</p>\n\n<p>Shabbat is the first thing that is called Kodesh in the Torah.  The Temple is the only thing called Kodesh Kodeshim.  It is argued, that the completion of the creation of the world was not completed until the Mishkan was built.    This is reflected in the psukim:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Bereshit 1-2                                                            Shemot 39-40\n 1:31 And Gd saw all that he had made and it was very good              39:43 Moses saw all of the skilled work\n 2:1 The Heavens and the Earth and all of their array was completed     39:32 All the work of the Mishkan and the Ohel moed was completed\n 2:2 And Gd completed all of the work                                   40:33 And Moshe completed the work. \n 2:3 And Gd blessed                                                     40:33 And Moshe Blessed\n 2:3 And sanctified it.                                                 40:9 and you shall sanctify it.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is continued in the book of Kings, where the number 7 is used for the construction of the Temple. It took 7 years to complete, It was dedicated on Sukkoth the 7 day holiday on the 7th month of the year, and the dedication is composed of 7 petitions.</p>\n\n<p>The idea that the Temple is the completion of the creation of the world, is also explicit in a Midrash on the Book of Kings: Pesiktah Rabbatai 6.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"All the work the Sholomo did was complete.  The Midrash says that it\n  does not say All work, but rather all THE work, just as it says in\n  Bereshit regarding Shabbat and the creation of the world.  When Shlomo\n  finished the construction of the Temple, Gd said, \"Now the work of the\n  heavens and earth are complete (shlema), and this is why Shlomo, was\n  tasked with it's construction.  (Shlomo comes from the same root word.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another contrast.  While Gd alone created the world, only man can build the Temple. When a perfect and just society is built, with the Temple at its center, then the work of the world is complete.</p>\n\n<p>R. Ovadiah Seforno, says that the word Menucha does not just mean stopping vigorous activity, but also means that you feel a sense of completion.  It is for this reason that when King David moved the Ark to Jerusalem, he called out in Psalms, 132:8, that he has brought Gd to his resting place (li-mnuchatekha)  In Chronicles 2 6:41, Shlomo says the same thing, \"Advance, O Lord Gd, to your resting place\", Shabbat is also called a day of Menucha.  Since they serve the same purpose, you must violate Shabbat to bring a Korbon, in the place of rest, and to bring Menucha to your soul.</p>\n\n<p>And lastly, When Betzalel builds the Mishkan, it talks about his Melakhah, and so too on Shabbat, we are told to stop doing Melakhah.   No Melkhah can be done to create the Temple on Shabbat, but on Shabbat you may do Melkah in the Temple.  As a reminder of the Brit between Gd and the Jewish people, towards the creation of the world and a perfect society.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I generally understood holiness in the following descending order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Holiness of person</li>\n<li>Holiness of time</li>\n<li>Holiness of space</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The holiest is \"person\", which is why we can violate Shabbos to save a life.</p>\n\n<p>Next comes \"time\", then \"space.\" Note that the Jews were not allowed to break Shabbos (time) to construct the Mishkan (space). Also, the punishment for a korban processed with intent for the wrong <em>time</em> (kares) is worse than that for the wrong <em>place</em> (regular lav).</p>\n\n<p>A daily/weekly/yearly routine of sacrifices, however, is considered a holiness of time as well, so Shabbos doesn't override it.</p>\n\n<p>It's a start, hopefully.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The answer that I am about to bring may or may not answer the question brought at the end (the main question), but either way, the first question which prompted the second must be addressed, because it presupposes that the mitzvah of bringing certain offerings on Shabbos <strong>pushes off</strong> the mitzvah of keeping Shabbos. But this is not true according to the Geonim.</p>\n\n<p>Because the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1168&st=&pgnum=271\" rel=\"nofollow\">שו\"ת מהר\"ם אל אשקר סימן ק\"ב</a> writes that Chazal teach that there are several pairs of words/phrases which were spoken by Hashem simultaneously (the best known example is זכור and שמור), and one of these pairs is the posuk in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0231.htm#14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemos 32,14</a> - מְחַלְלֶיהָ מוֹת יוּמָת (one who profanes Shabbos will surely die) and the posuk in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0428.htm#9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bamidbar 28,9</a> - וּבְיוֹם הַשַּׁבָּת (and on the day of Shabbos certain offerings must be brought). And Rav Sherira Gaon and Rav Hai Gaon explain that the reason for this is to teach us that at the same time that Hashem said that doing work on Shabbos is forbidden, He also said that bringing certain offerings was permitted, to teach that bringing these offerings is not a profanation of Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Thus it is clear that the command not to do work on Shabbos never included the bringing of these offerings, and thus the first question was based on a fallacy, and hence the second, main question - since it is based on the first question - also falls away. </p>\n\n\n",

Does anyone know of a source for adding this word, or a reason for doing so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As mentioned in comments Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.117a.21?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 117a</a> and discussion that follows as well as manuscript evidence shows that there does not exist word of הללוי\"ה at the end of Psalm 112.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.10a.1?lang=bi&with=Tosafot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos Brachos 10a</a> ending with the same good word as the Psalm started is a sign of special love that king David had for some Tehilim. As Psalm 112 starts with הללוי\"ה, perhaps the word is added liturgically at the end, just like we add an extra line when reciting Psalms 91 or 150 to finish with a good word.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, there are minhagim to add a portion of the next psalm if it may fit in the context to the recited psalm. For example, when reciting the Psalm 136 in <em>Pesukei D'Zimra</em>, which ends with כי לעולם חסדו - <em>his kindness endures forever</em>, some hazanim add רננו צדיקים בי\"ה - <em>sing joyfully O righteous because of Hashem</em> - beginning of the Psalm 33 which is recited next.</p>\n<p>In this case, Psalm 112 ends with the תאות רשעים תאבד - <em>ambition of the wicked shall persish</em> and Psalm 113 starts with הללוי\"ה. Adding extra הללוי\"ה is in spirit with gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.9b.29?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 9b</a>:  As Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, said: David said one hundred and three chapters, and he did not say Halleluya in any of them until he saw the downfall of the wicked.

    "title": "What problems are faced by children born out of wedlock?",
    "content": "# What problems are faced by children born out of wedlock?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was previously under the impression that, since a man may acquire a woman with sexual intercourse (cf: Mishna, Qiddushin 1:1), if a couple have a son but no ketubah, the child still inherits his father's property. See, for example, the mishna in Ketubot 4:9, which stipulates that sons inherit whether that detail is included in the ketubah or not. Recently, however, I learnt a mishna that appears to imply the opposite: that sons born out of wedlock face some manner of \"damage\", even though the identity of their father is known.</p>\n\n<p>My question concerns whether or not I am learning this material properly: does the term that I have translated as \"damage\" (פגם) refer to their inability to collect on their father's inheritance? If not, might it be referring to the notion that it is somehow socially damaging to suggest that somebody was born outside wedlock? Why would it be an insult if their parents were living together at the time of their conception?</p>\n\n<p>The mishna in question, together with the relevant peirushim, is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בית שמאי אומרים: פוטר אדם את אשתו בגט ישן ובית הלל אוסרין. איזהו גט\n  ישן? כל שנתיחד עמה אחר שכתבו לה</p>\n  \n  <p>The school of Shammai says that a man may divorce his wife with an old\n  document, but the school of Hillel forbids it. What is an old\n  document? Any [situation] in which he was secluded with her after\n  writing it.</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Gittin 8:4</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As R' Menachem Meiri points out, the mishna is speaking of a document (a <em>get</em>, as it is colloquially known) that was both written and signed on the day in question, but which was not given to her until a period of time had elapsed. The reasoning for prohibiting such a document is explained by Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro (based on the gemara in Gittin 79b) as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גזירה שמא יאמרו גטה קודם לבנה שמא ישהה את הגט שנה או שנתים בין כתיבה\n  לנתינה ויהיו לה בנים ממנו בתוך זמן ואח\"כ יגרשנה בו וכשיראו זמן הגט\n  קודם ללידת הבן יהיו סבורים שנתן לה גט משעת כתיבה והוי פגם שיאמרו מן\n  הפנויה נולד</p>\n  \n  <p>[This is an] enactment, lest people suspect that the document precedes\n  [the birth of] her son. Should there be a period of one or two years\n  between the writing [and signing - Meiri] of the document and its\n  being given, and should she have children to him within that time, and\n  should he divorce her with that document afterwards, then when people\n  see that the document predates the birth of her son they will think\n  that he gave her the document at the time of its composition, and\n  there will be damage - for they will say that he [her son]\n  was born of an unmarried woman.</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Bartinura, <em>ibid</em>.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The full quote from Rav Ovadia includes the words \"ב\"ש סברי לא אמרינן\" at the beginning, noting that the school of Shammai permit an old document because they <em>don't</em> hold by this enactment.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>No halachic bearing whatsoever. A born-out-of-wedlock child inherits from his father just the same, and if firstborn male, would get a double portion.</p>\n\n<p>\"Pegam\" means that people will say mean things about such a child. We try to avoid social problems too, even if they aren't halachic ones per se.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did people date divorce documents according to the Greeks?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5827-era#1154\">this article</a> on Jewish Encyclopedia, the conventional Jewish system of dating documents in the Middle Ages (a system called \"מנין שטרות\") was related to the accession of Seleucus I, the first king of the Seleucid dynasty. <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA\">This Hebrew article</a> on Wikipedia explains how it came to be that Jews associated this dating system with the arrival of Alexander and the cessation of prophecy. From that same article, it appears that this was a common system for the dating of ketubot, gittin, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_%28publishing%29\">colophons</a> and financial documents until the 9th century, although it persisted for Egyptian Jews until the 16th century, and for Yemenite Jews until the 20th.</p>\n\n<p>[For a beautiful example of a colophon that employs this system, see <a href=\"http://www.seforimonline.org/seforimdb/pdf/preview/264.jpg\">this image</a> from the Leningrad Codex, completed c.1008. It utilises a number of different dates, but the relevant one is at the end of the third line: והיא שנת אלף ושלש מאות ותשע עשרה שנה למלכות יונים שהיא למנין {שטרות} ולפסיקת הנבואה.]</p>\n\n<p>My question, based on the foregoing, is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna, in Gittin 8:5, specifically forbids dating a divorce document in accordance with the Greek empire (לשום מלכות יון), and the gemara (Gittin 80a-b) does not appear to qualify this in any respect. What is more, neither Rashi nor the Tosafot raise any objections to this, despite it having been the custom to do so until only a couple of centuries earlier!</p>\n\n<p>Why was dating divorce documents in accordance with the Seleucid Empire not problematic for Jews? Alternatively, how do I learn this mishna (and the corresponding gemara) in such a way that it is not suggesting that this practice should be forbidden? (Or, thirdly, is the author of the Wikipedia article mistaken, and this system was never used for שטרות גירושין?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In the Bavli to that Mishna (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=19&daf=80&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gittin 80a</a>), 'Ula explains that the reason there was an enactment made to write the date according to the local government was \"משום שלום מלכות\" \"to maintain peace with the government\". Rashi explains that the governments would see we use their dating system and assume that we value their leadership. Accordingly, Rambam rules (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/4201.htm#24\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchot Geirushin 1:27</a> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/957706\" rel=\"nofollow\">English</a>)):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן תיקנו שיהיו מונין בגיטין למלכות אותו הזמן, משום שלום מלכות.  כתב למלכות שאינה מלכות אותה המדינה, או לבניין הבית, או לחורבן הבית--אם דרך אנשי אותו מקום למנות בו, הרי זה כשר; ואם אין דרכן למנות בו, הרי זה פסול.  וכבר נהגו כל ישראל למנות בגיטין, או ליצירה או למלכות אלכסנדרוס מקרון שהוא מניין שטרות.  ואם כתב לשם מלכות אותו זמן במדינה שיש בה רשות אותה מלכות, הרי זה כשר.‏<br>\n  Similarly, [our Sages] ordained that the year of the ruling kingdom of that time should be mentioned in a get to gain the favor of the ruling authorities.</p>\n  \n  <p>[The following rules apply if] a person writes a get and dated it according to the years of a kingdom other [than that of his locale] or according to the years beginning from the Temple's construction or destruction. If it is customary for people in that locale to date [their documents] in this manner, it is acceptable. If this is not the local custom, it is unacceptable.</p>\n  \n  <p>It has already become the universal Jewish custom to date gittin from the time of creation, or from the crowning of Alexander the Great, which is [the accepted means of dating] for legal documents. If one dates [a get] according to the years of a contemporary kingdom, it is acceptable only in the country over which that kingdom rules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that now that governments don't care how we date the documents, it is acceptable to use a local customary system.</p>\n\n\n",

In fact, respective families had already said Kaddish for them.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of struggling to survive over the years, the two eventually fall in love.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any way they can declare themselves married in God's eyes alone?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>\"Married in G-d's eyes\" is an awfully hazy phrase. We believe that G-d gave us laws that tell us what marriage is (and isn't).</p>\n\n<p>What effects marriage between a Jewish man and woman, in theory, could be relations, but that would require intent and witnesses (well witnessing seclusion).  <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/4103.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maimonides, Laws of Husbandry Ch. 3</a></p>\n\n<p>And the Talmud says this is a theoretical, and imposed lashes on anyone who tries this crazy stunt. Giving a ring (or anything else intrinsically worth a dollar, for that matter) before two adult, Jewish male witnesses is the way to go.</p>\n\n<p>And no, \"everyone knows they're shipwrecked\" doesn't mean there are witnesses to seclusion, that means people assume they're dead. (If everyone on the street sees Joe & Jane living as a family unit for a year, that's a very different story.)</p>\n\n<p>But without witnesses, no there is no \"lifeboat option.\" There's a famous story of a Jewish man and woman who are taken as slaves by the Romans and put in a room together to reproduce; as there was no possibility of marriage, he didn't touch her.</p>\n\n<p>We have a system of laws, and they are what they are. Trying to to somehow creatively squeeze the law into legitimizing our actions really smells of hubris. Recall how King Saul kept insisting, through all sorts of contortions and rationalizations, that he followed the law when he hadn't (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a15.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">I Samuel 15:20</a>), and this caused him to lose the throne. King David, on the other hand, (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08b12.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">II Samuel 12:13</a>), has the courage to admit \"yes I messed up.\" -- and he's able to survive his failure.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the shipwreck case or whatever, I can theoretically point out that premarital relations are less-seriously prohibited than most other prohibited relations (e.g. adultery bears a theoretical death penalty, whereas premarital relations are at most lashes), and I have no idea how G-d would judge particular people in particular situations. But don't try to play games saying that this is within the boundaries of the law.</p>\n\n<p>(As for \"what about the commandment of procreation?\"  The occasional situation can come up in which well, you can't always fulfil every \"yes-do\" commandment. If there's a mean guy who bought every Etrog in a thousand mile radius just before Sukkot and won't share them, no you are not allowed to steal one of his -- you just turn to G-d and say \"I tried my best but couldn't hold an Etrog this year\", and if it was <em>truly and legitimately</em> beyond our control, we're not held to task for it -- just as the Torah makes clear that we never blame a rape victim.)</p>\n\n\n",

Similarly those who've been through first aid or CPR classes have likely heard of \"good Samaritan\" laws that legally protect people trying to help. Some people probably know where that phrase comes from, and a lot probably shrug it off without even thinking about it. (Personally I'm fine discussing the good Samaritan laws as such, but when the Talmud talks about conflicts between traditional Jews and another sect trying to mess up their calendar, I like to smile and say \"the good-for-nothing Samaritans.\")</p>\n\n<p>So I'd say that Jews who have literary exposure will occasionally use such phrases, occasionally with a wink. As long as it's clear we're not endorsing the New Testament as divine. Just as we might use a phrase that originated in Greek mythology or Shakespeare. (The Talmud says Rabbi Meir taught lessons from the book of Proverbs using all sorts of fables involving foxes; that sounds an awful lot like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop\">someone else</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Those who believe in very sharp boundaries against reading anything \"from the outside\" will probably try to avoid such phrases, though they may unwittingly wind up with some of them anyhow.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do English-speaking Jews read the Bible in English, or is that too Christian for them? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, English is not a Christian language.  If anything, it's a pagan language, but really it's just a language.  There are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_Bible_translations\">many translations of the Bible into English</a>.  Most are explicitly Christian.  A handful are scholarly works (e.g., <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0805211195\">Everett Fox's translation</a>).  Some are explicitly Jewish.  The Jewish ones tend to use older Jewish translations and traditional Jewish commentators, like Rashi, Ramban, and Metzudot, to understand difficult verses or words.</p>\n\n<p>If a Jew were to read a translation of the Tanakh into English, they'd likely turn to one of the Jewish translations.  Some examples are \"Old\" JPS, New JPS, Hertz, Stone, and Aryeh Kaplan's translation.  Wikipedia has <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_English_Bible_translations\">a non-exhaustive list of Jewish translations</a>.  As you can see from the number of translations into English, many Jews do sometimes read the Bible in translation.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is serious contention in some parts of the Jewish world if this is a valid practice.  Translation of the Pentateuch has been an especially contentious issue in Judaism throughout its history because we are loathe to give up our relationship with the exact words of the Torah.  The Septuagint was allegedly written by seventy knowledgeable rabbis under duress.  There are several early translations into Aramaic (each called a Targum - Aramaic for translation) which are considered authoritative by modern Jews, and some of our interpretations of difficult verses come from these targums.  But as I said, we're loathe to give up our relationship with the original Hebrew, so there are folks who oppose any translation aside from the targums.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Maybe they like to get the gist of the Torah or Tanakh by reading in the vernacular English and then they may read prayerfully in modern Hebrew?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the vast majority of synagogues of any Jewish denomination, we chant the week's readings aloud in Hebrew.  We don't use modern Hebrew, as that would still be translation (and all translations are interpretations), and because that is not necessarily a language we understand.  We read the Bible ritually in the language it was written in - ancient Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>Some have a practice of reading the weekly Torah portion <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shnayim_mikra_ve-echad_targum\">twice in the original and once in Aramaic translation</a>.  This is, in fact, a recommended practice, even (especially?) among those who don't believe in vernacular translations.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, those who read English translations of the Torah might read the English to themselves as the Hebrew is chanted in synagogue.  They might use the English first when trying to understand the text or might only use English when trying to skim it.  They might use the Hebrew first and fall back to English when they don't recognize a word (though this can be problematic).  They might read the Hebrew text but the English commentaries.  Individual practices, as usual, vary widely based on ideology, language ability, experience, and preference.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So to answer your question, some Jews read English translations of the Bible.  Some don't.  Most congregations read it ritually in ancient Hebrew.  But as a general rule, Jews do not read Christian translations of the Bible for non-scholarly purposes.</p>\n\n\n",

However it is prohibited to sit at a Shiur which is being given by a woman.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I cannot tell from your question if you're concern is focused on Kol Isha. I am assuming that is the focus. <a href=\"http://www.jewishideas.org/articles/new-hearing-kol-ishah\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article</a> discusses Kol Isha and when and how it applies, citing various viewpoints. I am citing one of the permissible views. Read the remaining sections of the article, as there are varying opinions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Yehiel Yaakov Weinberg (Seridei Esh 2:8) defended the\n  German-Jewish custom of mixed-sex zemirot, as well mixed sex Jewish\n  youth groups (similar to Benei Akiva and NCSY).[3] He interpreted the\n  Rambam that the prohibited form of \"gazing\" and listening is only that\n  which entails sexual pleasure. Rabbi Weinberg also relied on the Sedei\n  Hemed (section Kuf, kelal 42), who ruled that a man's listening to a\n  woman sing funeral dirges does not violate kol ishah, as no sexual\n  pleasure is entailed in such songs. The Sedei Hemed was relying on the\n  Divrei Heifetz (113b), who \"stated that as long as a woman is not\n  singing sensual love songs, and as long as a man does not intend to\n  derive pleasure from her voice, there is no prohibition, such as if\n  she is singing praises to God for a miracle, or is singing a lullaby\n  to a baby, or is wailing at a funeral.\" [4] Rabbi Weinberg also cited\n  the Sefer ha-Eshkol (Hilkhot Tefillah sec. 4 or 7), that listening to\n  a woman sing is prohibited only where there is sexual pleasure. Rabbi\n  Weinberg reasoned that if the Sedei Hemed could permit funeral dirges\n  due to their lacking sexual pleasure, then he could permit Shabbat\n  zemirot on the same grounds. It is obvious that we today can likewise\n  permit by the same logic any song which does not lead to sexual\n  thoughts. Thus, this interpretation that kol ishah is like etzba\n  ketana, i.e. permitted where sexual pleasure is absent, is not only\n  apparent from the simple meaning of Rambam's words, but is also\n  endorsed by Rabbi Yehiel Weinberg.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Weinberg also relied on the opinion of the Ritva and Rema, \"that\n  all is for the sake of heaven\" (to be discussed later in this essay).\n  In general, if one knows that he himself is capable of a certain act\n  without incurring sexual thoughts, then this act becomes permitted for\n  him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am inferring from above as well as the rest of the article, that the main concerns are related to singing. As you can see, there are leniencies, there. I think that hearing a woman speak is less of a concern of Kol Isha.</p>\n\n<p>If your concern is regarding mixed seating, I can say from my personal experience, that I have attended numerous services where there was a mechitza for davening. A woman gave the D'var Torah before Musaph on Shabbat, and she went to the front of the shul, and the mechitzah curtain was drawn so that the women could see her. It was a given, then, that the men could see her as well as the other women.</p>\n\n\n",

And all of the days the First Temple stood, and the Second {Temple}, the only one called Edom were the actual descendants of Esav. However, after the destruction of the {second} Temple, the Jews began to call the kingdom of Rome by the name Edom. And this was because in general, the Edomites tormented Israel, and therefore the name Edom was hated and detested by us. And specifically, after the Herod reigned, who was an Edomite who was very bad to Israel. And when the Temple was destroyed at the hands of the Romans, the hatred of the Jews passed from Edom to Rome. Therefore (and also because of fear), they nicknamed Rome with the name Edom. And the intent is not at all to the people of the new faith {=Christians}, but rather to the Roman empire which destroyed our Temple, and to all the places that their rule and language extended.</p>\n  \n  <p>And do not listen to the words of Ibn Ezra who said that the people of the new faith are called Edom because the first ones who believed in the Nazarene were from the people of Edom. For this is falsehood and lies, for the first one who believed in the Nazarene were Jews, Greeks, and Romans, not Edomites.

And so let us say we are willing to grant that an Edomi, elsewhere referred to as ach, would be encompassed in this prohibition of usury. Even so, the Edomites were obliterated by Nevuchadnezzar, as we see in sefer Yeshaya. And while the hamon am and others like them make this mistake in thinking that people of that country (?France, Spain?) were of Edom, this is indeed an error. There may be a few around Har Seir. And while the Egyptians returned to Egypt, the Edomite nation did not return. Furthermore, this country of Ibn Caspi was settled in the days of Nevuchadnezzar, with a different populace, that of the sons of Yefes, as Josephus notes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra and Ramban are cited <a href=\"http://text.rcarabbis.org/italians-romans-germans-and-edomites/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> as agreeing.

The write up is too long to give the entire set of citations or details, but some of the statements are shown below.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch stated that the more the community pressured everyone to think alike, the more the people resisted and tried to follow their own way of thinking. Hashem made the miracle of forcing the actual change in language to follow these ways of thought in order to have it happen so rapidly.  Rav Hirsch does not deal with archeology or anything else other than the meaning in his commentary.</p>\n\n<p>Note that I.L. means that the translator (the grandson of Rav Hirsch Rabbi Isaac Levi) added an explanation to the translation of Rav Hirsch's commentary.      </p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says that the pasuk means</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Safa Achas\" means the phonetic sameness of speech ( the sound of the\n  language I.L) which is fundamentally based on organic causes. \"Deverim\n  Achadim\" is the sameness of the formation of words and sentences which\n  is brought about by spiritual mental agreement in the way that things\n  and their relations are looked at.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out in Noach 2:7, that the words used for matters like \"justice\", \"virtue\", or \"charity\" in different languages can have completely different connotations. It would appear that even though everyone <strong>thought</strong> that they were speaking the original language (from the time of Adam), Hashem changed what they were saying to have the connotation that they really wanted and made them into the differing languages.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For example, think for a minute that the word to \"have\" was missing\n  from our vocabulary. In Hebrew it does not exist. \"To have\" has the\n  conception of corporal holding fast, \"habere\", \"avere\" to desire\n  something, and when one has seized it, then one \"has it\". Let us\n  imagine that this conception was not there, a man could only consider\n  that to be his which really appertains to him, is לו in Hebrew. ...\n  Then the first person who introduced the idea of \"have\" (I have it,\n  whether or not it pertains to me or not <em>I.L.</em>) would indeed have\n  brought about the greatest revolution; he would have changed the idea\n  of right to the idea of \"grab\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The attempt by the community by this building to do away with the\n  individuality of the individual was broken by the awakening\n  consciousness of the independent value of the individual, apart from\n  his value as a unit of the community.</p>\n  \n  <p>So that the disunion did not arise out of a number of languages but\n  the other way round. It was the discord which first begot the\n  disruption of the language, so that at the beginning, the <em>Safa Achas</em>\n  could still have remained ... without the climatic change, even before\n  the scattering which ensued in the <em>safa achas</em> there was no longer\n  <em>devarim achadim</em>. This variance in opinions drove people completely away from one\n  another, where then the climactic differences of the\n  regions had the influence of making them and their languages\n  completely and organically different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that normally these developments would take place over a long period of time. However, Hashem caused them to occur almost instantaneously so that the entire development of the \"Migdal Bavel\" would collapse and cause the immediate dispersion of the various peoples.</p>\n\n\n",

It seems from the listing that Rashi's ordering is in order of intensity or severity, from least to most severe.</p>\n\n<p>To answer point 2. The 'rebuke' is achieved through a subtle reminder. To list every wrong committed is to fail in the objective.  Moshe Rabbeinu didn't want Am Yisrael to feel dispondent, hopeless and depressed.  He wanted them to be reminded about the lessons that he was imparting.  To list every wrong would defeat the purpose, even if all were subtley mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>To answer point 3. While you're correct in stating that the generation was not directly involved in the sins listed, but since they are in a similar position, have every opportunity to fail as it were in their mission.  Moshe is subtley rebuking them to remind them about these points in our history as a reminder not to fall to these temptations again.  We are still trying to fix these mistakes today, and I guarantee you I did not worship a golden calf, or listen to the spies.  The point is that each generation has its own 'golden calf' and its own 'listening to the spies' that need to be corrected.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Or HaHayim has a fascinating interpretation of this pasuq (<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=5&perek=1&mefaresh=orah_haim\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>), in which he draws out hints at 9 middot that Moshe Rabbeinu was conveying to the generation. </p>\n\n<p>IMHO, Or HaHayim's interpretation addresses #2 and #3; but, at face value, doesn't address #1. My own addition to his interpretation is that, perhaps, the 9 middot are in order of importance (e.g. to be an \"'Ivri\" is most important and to be \"Sameahh BeHelqo\" is least important among these suggestions).</p>\n\n<p>B\"N, I will expand this answer to include a translation/summary of Or HaHayim's interpretation.</p>\n\n\n",

There is some indication that the Hebrew word nechosheth used here indicates pure unalloyed copper (Deuteronomy 8:9; Radak on 1 Kings 7:45). Others, however, state that the Temple vessels were made of brass, which has the same color as gold (Ezra 8:27, Ibn Ezra ad loc.; Radak, s.v. Tzahav; Rambam on Middoth 2:3), and the Talmud clearly states that the vessels made by Moses consisted of this material (Arkhin 10b). Josephus writes that the brass altar looked like gold (Antiquities 3:6:8, see Exodus 27:2). Perhaps it was an alloy of copper and silver or gold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Copper is a pure element (Cu). Like gold it is very soft when pure and is really only fit for jewelry and small trinkets. Copper only became useable in the ancient world for weapons and other large solid things when it was turned into a sturdier alloy. An alloy of copper and other elements is called bronze. (Hence the Bronze Age) Brass is a specific alloy of copper and zinc. Biblical Hebrew (unlike some other ancient languages) does not distinguish between pure copper and copper alloys and calls them both נחשת. Therefore determining whether nechoshet in the bible is bronze, brass, or copper is a matter of interpretation from context. In Teruma since the nechoshet is being used to build solid things it is likely referring to an alloy although perhaps purer copper could be used to plate things. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How many stars did Rashi think there were?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the Chabad translation, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9965#showrashi=true&v=10\">Rashi on Deut. 1:10</a> implies that there are more than 600,000 stars:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The Lord, your God, has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of the heavens in abundance.</strong> (Deut 1:10)</p>\n  \n  <p>And, behold, you are today as the stars of the heavens: But were they [the Israelites] on that day as [many as] the stars of the heavens? Were they not only six hundred thousand?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Rashi's question is resolved by saying that they are as eternal as the stars, but it still raises the question.)</p>\n\n<p>Of course today we know this to be true (in fact, current estimates are on the order of hundreds of sextillions of stars in the observable universe), but Rashi said this before the advent of the telescope, during a time when there were perhaps a couple thousand stars cataloged.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there any indications elsewhere of how many stars Rashi thought there were, or perhaps if other Torah sources said something similar to Rashi?</strong> (Is it even a proper understanding of the Rashi? I'm going off an English translation.) Perhaps there were philosophers or astronomers at the time who said there must be many more stars than could be individually counted, I don't know.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Around 1.06434e+18.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=32b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brachos</a> says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>י\"ב מזלות בראתי ברקיע ועל כל מזל ומזל בראתי לו שלשים חיל ועל כל חיל וחיל בראתי לו שלשים לגיון ועל כל לגיון ולגיון בראתי לו שלשים רהטון ועל כל רהטון ורהטון בראתי לו שלשים קרטון ועל כל קרטון וקרטון בראתי לו שלשים גסטרא ועל כל גסטרא וגסטרא תליתי בו שלש מאות וששים וחמשה אלפי רבוא כוכבים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hashem created 12 constellations. </p>\n\n<p>To each constellation He assigned 30 <em>Chail</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For each <em>Chail</em>, He created 30 <em>legions</em>. </p>\n\n<p>For each <em>legion</em>, He created 30 <em>rehatons</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For each <em>rehatons</em>, He created 30 <em>kartons</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For each <em>karton</em>, He created 30 <em>Gistera</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For each <em>gistera</em>, He created 365*1000*10000 stars.</p>\n\n<p>The result comes up to 12*30*30*30*30*30*365*1000*10000</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I might venture a couple sheer guesses of what it might possibly mean.

These are statements made at a time when there were no human beings were aware of concepts such as galaxies. There are about <a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/102630/how-many-stars-are-there-in-the-universe\" rel=\"nofollow\">9,000 stars visible on a clear, moonless night</a>, yet 2,000+ years ago the Talmud quotes a tradition that there are 10^18 stars.</p>\n\n<p>Science is proud of its accuracy, yet when counting stars there is a great deal of guess work. Stars are counted in a small area and then extrapolated to be evenly distributed. Science estimates about 10^11 or 10^12. The key here is defining what is counted as a star. Next, galaxies are counted in a small area and extrapolated to be evenly distributed. Right now, that is also estimated to be about 10^11 to 10^12. The resulting estimate for the total number of stars is therefore 10^22 to 10^24.\n(Just as an aside, if religious tradition made the claim that the average number of stars in a galaxy is almost exactly the number of galaxies in the universe I think science would have a problem with the coincidence.)</p>\n\n<p>My feeling is that statements from religious tradition are like the answers in the back of a text book. If you work a problem and come up with a different answer then the first response should be to make sure that the problem was understood correctly, not that the answer given was a mistake. It is possible that the question is not the same. Here, perhaps the definition of a star is different or the definition of the size of the universe is different.</p>\n\n<p>For the question of the size of the universe, the size of the \"observable universe\" changes as science progresses. Does that mean that the number from tradition is only valid for a specific level of scientific ability? Perhaps the number of stars will continue to increase and the traditional value will become progressively more wrong. That would not seem to be the universal result expected from religion. As a possible response, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"future visibility limit\"</a> may mean that the largest the number of observable stars can only ever be 2.36 times the current number of observable stars, which locks us in to about the current order of magnitude. \nThe number of grains of sand is often compared to the number of stars in the sky. I find one estimate of 10^18 and another of 10^24 (Sorry, but I am limited to 2 links, so you have to do the search yourself if you are interested).  The 10^18 is based on grains of sand on the beach. This is not unreasonable, just a matter of definition. Perhaps the equivalent number for stars is based on a similar restrictive definition. In any case, religious traditional values do not seem to be out of line.</p>\n\n<p>In the US (in 2009) there were 193 million \"light duty vehicles, short wheel base,\" 40 million \"light duty vehicles, long wheel base,\" 10 million trucks, and 9 million motorcycles. Using 10 million as the unit of measure, if asked the number of cars, either 19 (defined as cars) or 25 (defined as vehicles) would both be reasonable answers. </p>\n\n<p>So, 2,000+ years ago nobody ever saw more than 10^4 stars, but the Talmud says that tradition puts the count as about 10^18. With all of our advances in science, without a clear definition of what is being counted, say that the number is more like 10^22 to 20^24. </p>\n\n<p>This is supposed to discredit Rabbinic Torah?</p>\n\n\n",

One such <em>vesses</em> is the <em>vesses hachodesh</em>, which relies on the day of the (Jewish) month. So for instance, if a woman menstruates beginning on the fifth day of the month every month (or for at least three consecutive months), then she has what is known as a <em>vesses hachodesh</em> and must expect her period to begin on the fifth of every month, which entails remaining abstinent on that day and checking herself to confirm the onset of her period.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this all works well with our fixed calendar, with which we know in advance which months contain 29 days and which contain 30. However, in the times when the <em>Sanhedrin</em> was (or will be) active, the months are established by their announcement. I think you know where I'm going with this...</p>\n\n<p>If a woman has a <em>vesses hachodesh</em> which occurs on the first of every month, then she must act as if she will begin her period that day starting already at sunrise of that day. But the Sanhedrin quite often will not announce the new month until later during the day. Or they will not announce it at all, in which case the month begins the following day.</p>\n\n<p>What should she do? Should she treat today (the maybe-Rosh-Chodesh-maybe-thirtieth-day) as her <em>vesses</em>, and if it turns out to be the thirtieth day of the waning month, treat the next day as her <em>vesses</em> as well? Or should she treat today as a normal day until the <em>Sanhdrin</em> declares it as <em>Rosh Chodesh</em>?</p>\n\n<p>[In this case, I would prefer sources over well-reasoned unsourced answers.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Not a full answer - but too long to format nicely in a comment:</p>\n\n<p>See Tosafot איתמר in Nida 64a </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דחזאי ריש ירחא וריש ירחא כו' ואפילו שאחד מלא ואחד חסר ואין הימים שבין ראייה לראייה שוין מ''מ <strong>קביעות החדש גורם</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It would seem that if one had a Veset as you describe, one would be <em>in doubt</em> until finding out when  Rosh Chodesh was declared.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See Shach 189:13 who brings the opinion of the Re'ah that one would count (even nowadays) a Veset from the Molad and it would have no significance if the month was 29 or 30 days.</p>\n<p>כתב הרא\"ה בספר ב\"ה שם לא לקידוש החודש ולתקיעת שופר שלנו אלא למולד הלבנה לשעה שנראה שראוי לקבוע חודש על פי הראיה</p>\n<p>Afterwards he brings the Rashba who argues and holds that it goes after the day of the month, not days after the molad.</p>\n<p>אבל הרשב\"א במ\"ה כתב דודאי שיפורא גרים והכל לימות החודש מלא וחסר לחדשים ולשנים מעוברות לפי תיקוני ב\"ד שכל מה שב\"ד שלמטה עושים ב\"ד שלמעלה מסכימי' עמהם דכתיב אשר תקראו אותם אשר תקראו אתם במועדם ואף בחידושי הגוף כן וכמו שדרשו ז\"ל בלאל גומר עלי קטנה בת ג' שנים ויום א' שנבעלה אין בתוליה חוזרים נמנו ב\"ד ועברו השנה בתולי' חוזרים הוי לאל גומר עלי עכ\"ל והוא בירושלמי פרק הנודר מן המבושל הלכה י\"ג בשם ר' אבין וכ\"כ הרא\"ש פרק האשה דבשפורא תליא מילתא והכי אמרינן בס\"פ בנות כותים (נדה דף ל\"ח ע\"א) דשיפורא גרים וכן הוא באגודה שם וכ\"כ בתשובת ר\"י מינץ סימן ט' ע\"ש שהאריך וכן משמע פשט דברי הט\"ו והפוסקים ועיין בספר עשרה מאמרות מאמר אם כל חי ח\"ב סימן י\"ז</p>\n<p>So according to the Re'ah this question doesn't start and maybe that was the accepted halacha in those days in order to avoid these confusions.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason for this is, as the Rambam says (Hil. Melakhim, 10:1), היה לו ללמוד ולא למד--he should have learnt the law and he did not learn it: </p>\n\n<p>אבל אם ידע שהוא אשת חבירו ולא ידע שהיא אסורה עליו. אלא עלה על לבו שדבר זה מותר לו. וכן אם הרג והוא לא ידע שאסור להרוג. הרי זה קרוב למזיד ונהרג. ולא תחשב זו להם שגגה מפני שהיה לו ללמוד ולא למד</p>\n\n<p>See also: R. Chaim Hirschensohn, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1892&st=&pgnum=22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malki ba-Kodesh, vol. 1 p. 21</a>; <a href=\"http://press.tau.ac.il/perplexed/chapters/chap_1_36.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevukhim, 1:36</a> (end); R. Nissim Gaon, introduction to the Talmud; R. J.D. Bleich, \"Judaism and Natural Law.\" </p>\n\n<p>However, R. Moshe Weiner in his <em>Sheva Mitzvot Hashem</em> (vol. 1, pp. 52-54) argues that the rule of היה לו ללמוד only applies in a society which observes <em>sheva mitzvot</em>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונראה לי דכל זה דוקא אם היה יכול ללמוד, כגון שהצבור בכללותו יודע אזהרת\n  שבע מצוות בני נח, אבל בזמנים או מקומות שאין הצבור יודע כלל מהציווי,\n  אין שייך לומר שהיה לו ללמוד, כי מנין ידע שעליו ללמוד כלל...במה דברים\n  אמורים במצות ע\"ז, גלוי עריות, ואבר מן החי [שאם לא למד לא ידע כלל שיש\n  איסור בדבר], אבל איסור רציחה וגזל ומצוות דינים שגם אילולא נצטוו עליהם\n  בני אדם מחוייבים בהם ע\"פ המושכל לבד, אין לב\"נ התנצלות שלא ידע שאסור\n  לרצוח או לגזול.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Weiner distinguishes between murder, theft, <em>birkat Hashem</em> and <em>dinim</em>, in which one never has an excuse of ignorance, and the other laws. He bases this on the Avnei Nezer's comments in Orach Chaim 345. The <em>Hit'orerut Teshuvah</em> (4:186) similarly writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונראה לי מה שכתב הרמב\"ם בהל' מלכים (פ\"י ה\"א) דגוי שעובר על שבע מצות\n  בחשבו שמותר הוא חייב, כי קרוב למזיד הוא שהיה לו ללמוד ולא למד...לענ\"ד\n  זה דווקא כשאנו שרוין בארצינו וידינו תקיפה...ובזה יש לומר שהי' לו ללמוד\n  יען שרואה בכל יום כולם גירי תושבים ויש להם דת שבע מצות ויודע מכל זה\n  ממעשים בכל יום ששומע ורואה, והיה לו ללמוד, אבל עתה בגלות שלא שמע ולא\n  ראה ולא ידע מכל זה מאין יעלה על דעתו שיש לו ללמוד שבע מצות ולקיימם אשר\n  לא שמע מעולם מכל זה, הגם שאין אנו רשאים להכשילו בהם משום לפני עור, אבל\n  הוא שוגג גמור הוא יותר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The question seems to be a little bit open ended but I see two somewhat related issues.</p>\n\n<p>The first is the mental/emotional burden of abandoning beliefs one has been raised with.  This can certainly be difficult but isn't necessarily unique to \"religious\" beliefs. People have many ideologies that they cling too tightly despite their being inappropriate or even hurtful to themselves or others. It is hard to suggest that they need not revisit such beliefs out of these concerns.</p>\n\n<p>The second is whether they have a fair opportunity being ignorant of the Noachide laws and often accustomed to forbidden beliefs from their youth.  In this regard, it seems to me, that we can simply trust that Hashem's judgement is just. Perhaps they were presented with an opportunity to learn which they failed to give its proper respect.  Perhaps they have merits which Hashem may feel outweigh the transgressions brought about by their environment and they receive a portion in the world to come. In the Jewish sources we do not find the belief of others that one will be sentenced to eternal punishment in the event that they have not repented/atoned of each sin, but instead they may go through a period of purging such transgressions. Perhaps they were simply mediocre and received their reward in this world, receiving neither life in the world to come nor punishment.   </p>\n\n<p>We know that there is reward and there is punishment but the precise determination of such issues are left up to the Judge.</p>\n\n\n",

He's there to referee that they're following the rules (e.g. make sure he's actually giving her a ring that's his, and not borrowing one from a friend); and as it's a societal mess for 14-year-olds to go running off with their high school crushes, to enforce some sort of social norms.</p>\n\n<p>Please don't use the term \"shiksa\" by the way, it's offensive.

In Wyoming I think you can officiate your own wedding.) Thus if a Hindu man and Jewish woman meet and they don't care about intermarriage, if they get a Reform rabbi (the Reform movement allows intermarriage), Hindu pandit, Universalist Unitarian minister, or any other flavor of clergy they want to sign their certificate, the state will take it.

Obviously, the Rambam was highly criticized for this, but never the less it is still a legitimate view.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to Halacha, it seems that the rule is that astrology is real, and that יש מזל לישראל. for an example to this, the Halacha is that a woman that two of her husbands died (even if not from a natural cause) cannot remarry since we say that her Mazal caused her husband's to die. <a href=\"http://www.cwj.org.il/sites/default/files/%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%A7%20960945-1%E2%80%8F%20-%20%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%94%20%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%AA.doc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is the Pask of a Biet Deen in Israel.</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/52930/does-the-zodiac-really-have-influence-on-our-lives/53765#53765\">Does the Zodiac really have influence on our lives?</a> where the view of the Rambam in his letter on astrology is discussed.

    "title": "Why does Rashi cite the Midrash of Pharaoh's daughter stretching out her arm?",
    "content": "# Why does Rashi cite the Midrash of Pharaoh's daughter stretching out her arm?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a famous Midrash cited by Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9863#showrashi=true&v=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemoth 2:5</a>), that says Pharaoh's daughter stretched out her arm and that it extended beyond its natural length to pull in the basket containing the baby from the Nile river (whom she would name Moshe). This is based on the words of the Pasuk, \"וַתִּשְׁלַח אֶת-אֲמָתָהּ\", which are <em>usually</em> translated as, \"And she sent her arm,\" suggesting that the <em>sending</em> is somehow awkward for a limb.  But that's not really the meaning of the words, and Rashi himself first says that אֲמָתָהּ actually means \"her handmaid\". (See also, \"וְיוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי שַׁבָּת לַה אֱ-לֹקֶיךָ:  לֹא-תַעֲשֶׂה כָל-מְלָאכָה אַתָּה וּבִנְךָ וּבִתֶּךָ, עַבְדְּךָ <strong>וַאֲמָתְךָ</strong> וּבְהֶמְתֶּךָ, וְגֵרְךָ, אֲשֶׁר בִּשְׁעָרֶיךָ.‏ \" -- \"But the seventh day is a sabbath to HaShem your G-d: do not do any creative labor, you, your son and your daughter, your (male) slave <strong>and your handmaid</strong> and your animal, and the stranger that is within your gates.\")  Even after citing the Midrash, Rashi further explains that the Midrash doesn't even work grammatically, because the word אֲמָה needs a Dagesh in the Mem to mean \"arm\".</p>\n\n<p>So the Midrash is using the visual of Pharaoh's daughter miraculously extending her arm beyond its natural length to explain why the word \"(and she) sent\" is used in the Pasuk - even though, if we just translate it the more natural way (ie., her handmaid), it would make sense without any obvious miracles or any unusual linguistic tricks. Not only that, but the forced translation also creates a new awkward phrasing (at least in my opinion). The very next word says, \"וַתִּקָּחֶהָ\" - \"and she took it\". Once the Midrash has defined the meaning of the Pasuk that she herself extended her hand, it makes <em>this</em> word awkward, because it could have just said, \"<em>to</em> take it,\" or something equally generic and passive. It's not really fixing any awkwardness. It's only the assumption that she did it herself that created the awkwardness it then seeks to fix, and then it accidentally creates another (admittedly slightly less) awkward phrasing.</p>\n\n<p>So why should Rashi go to such great lengths (the pun wasn't originally intended, but it's a good one, isn't it) to cite this Midrash? <s>Isn't his whole modus operandi to bring Peshat unless Peshat isn't adequate and the Pasuk calls for Derash?</s></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rashi's quote from the text is \"את-אמתה\" so his question must arise from within the quote or from the quote's relationship with the context.  He may have been dissatisfied with understanding the quote as 'her handmaiden' because that would raised the following questions:</p>\n\n<p>1) Why does the text specify who was sent?  (It was 'only' a maidservant, after all.  Shemoth 9:7 is one example of not specifying who was sent)  </p>\n\n<p>2) Why does the text use את before אמתה?  (Not all objects of verbs have את in front, so this seems to raise the status of the אמה in the action.  Rashi might even understand it to mean 'with', leading to 'with something additional', namely a miraculously extended arm.)</p>\n\n<p>3) Handmaidens have already been introduced in this verse, as נערתיה - her youths (female).  Why now switch to the term אמה?  There must be something special about that word - cue similar words with different meanings.  (Unclear why Rashi included את in the quote.  Perhaps because it's joined by Maqqef)</p>\n\n<p>4) If the next word 'and she took it' is meant in the physical sense, then the phrase becomes odd - how (and why) did she take it herself if she had sent her handmaiden to it? (Unclear why Rashi did not include ותקחה in the quote)</p>\n\n<p>5) Assuming Pharaoh's daughter acted through a handmaiden, for what purpose does the text tell us that detail?  Surely it doesn't state explicitly whenever royalty act through their staff?  (Unclear why Rashi did not include ותשלח in the quote)</p>\n\n<p>6) Why did Pharaoh act through an אמה? The subsequent actions, in this and the next verse, are all done by Pharaoh's daughter herself.  The story shows us Pharaoh's daughter personally saving an unknown abandoned child; she appears less concerned with status roles and more with compassion and action.  Physically, too, she may have been closer to the baby's location in the reeds (she had come to wash) than her handmaidens were; they were 'walking next to the Nile' just before Rashi's quoted phrase. (Unclear why Rashi did not include ותשלח in the quote)</p>\n\n<p>Rashi could have answered these questions in various ways but the derash does deal with them convincingly - and it has Chaza\"l behind it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rashi's modus operandi is NOT just to bring peshat. The quote is to bring peshat, and to bring aggadah which works well and explains aspects of the text. Rashi to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8167#showrashi=true&v=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit 3:8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואני לא באתי אלא לפשוטו של מקרא ולאגדה המיישבת דברי המקרא דבר דבור על אופניו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would estimate that about 80% of Rashi is citations of midrashim.</p>\n<p>In this instance, Rashi's concern is indeed the peshat and the dikduk, rather than the miracle:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>את אמתה: את שפחתה. ורבותינו דרשו לשון יד. אבל לפי דקדוק לשון הקודש היה לו להנקד אמתה מ\"ם דגושה. והם דרשו את אמתה את ידה, שנשתרבבה אמתה אמות הרבה:</p>\n<p><strong>her maidservant</strong>: Heb. אֲמָתָהּ, her maidservant. Our Sages (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=12b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 12b</a>), however, interpreted it as an expression meaning a hand. Following [the rules of] Hebrew grammar, however, it should have been vowelized אַמָּתָהּ, with a dagesh in the mem. They, however, interpreted אֶתאֲמָתָהּ to mean her hand, and her arm grew many cubits (אַמוֹת).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, the word אמה could be interpreted in three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>hand</li>\n<li>maidservant</li>\n<li>cubit</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of these three, a pashtan could think that #1 was peshat. Therefore, Rashi points out that:\nA) it really means maidservant\nB) Chazal said hand;\nC) this was midrash, rather than peshat\nD) and it must be midrash because the dikduk does not work out on peshat level\nE) very slight elaboration of Chazal's derasha, to show their engagement in wordplay, that they incorporate definition #3.</p>\n<p>Look to see how much space Rashi devotes to each of these tasks.</p>\n<p>Rejecting the midrash and explaining why (or even accepting it, had he done so) is well within Rashi's agenda.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Based on the the Sefer Zikaron (I didn't look it up) and the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39117&pgnum=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefer HaShoreshim LeHaRadak (entry אֲמָה)</a>, the Chumash Shai LeMorah says that there are some who say the correct version is with a dagesh in the mem. (He says that R' Sadeya Gaon says so, and R' Hai Gaon brings both versions.)</p>\n\n<p>If that is the case, it seems that Rashi brings the Midrash in order to refute that version.</p>\n\n<p>(See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42843&pgnum=36\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gur Aryeh on the verse</a> for something similar)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Alternately (and I'm not sure if this is correct), the previous Rashi quotes our Rabbis as saying that the handmaidens died because they tried to protest Pharaoh's daughter's action of saving the child. Rashi then says that the words of the verse support this explanation. </p>\n\n<p>[The Talmud that Rashi is quoting does say one handmaiden was left alive, but Rashi here does not bring that point]. </p>\n\n<p>If so, Rashi is left with a problem. If the maidservants died, which maidservant did she send to take the basket. To resolve this, Rashi brings the Midrash, even if he finds it problematic.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Understanding Yevamot 4:13's proof of who, exactly, is a mamzer\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When it comes to the question of who is a mamzer, numerous conflicting theories abound in the early rabbinic literature. The opinion presented anonymously in Qiddushin 3:12, which appears to be halakhically authoritative (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5115.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam, Hilkhot Issurei Biah 15:1</a>) follows the opinion given in the name of Shimon haTeimani in Yevamot 4:13, which is concluded with the parenthetical aside: והלכה כדבריו. This is the opinion that a mamzer is one born of a union that merits <em>karet</em> (in the words of Yevamot 4:13; in Qiddushin 3:12 - זה הבא על אחת מכל העריות שבתורה).</p>\n\n<p>It appears that these mishnayot are referring to every sexual union prohibited in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviticus 18</a>, with the exception of sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman (as per the Bartenura on Yevamot 4:13). Opinions to the contrary include those of Rabbi Akiva (who defines a mamzer as the offspring of <em>any</em> prohibited union) and Rabbi Yehoshua (who defines a mamzer as the offspring of any union that merits death at the hands of a <em>bet din</em>).</p>\n\n<p>In Yevamot 4:13, R' Shimon ben Azzai provides a proof for the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי שמעון בן עזאי: מצאתי מגלת יֹחסין בירושלים וכתוב בה: איש פלוני\n  ממזר מאשת איש לקים דברי רבי יהושע</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai says, \"I found a genealogical scroll in\n  Jerusalem, in which was written: So-and-so is a mamzer born of\n  adultery - which substantiates the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua [who says\n  that a mamzer is one born of any union that merits death at the hands\n  of a <em>bet din</em>]!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An adulterous union does indeed merit the death penalty (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9921#showrashi=true&v=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviticus 20:8</a>, Sanhedrin 11:1), but it <em>also</em> merits <em>karet</em> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919#showrashi=true&v=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviticus 18:20</a>, Keritot 1:1)! I appreciate how the Tur and the Shulchan Arukh have combined the two opinions (<em>Even haEzer</em> 4:13), but I'm specifically interested in understanding this mishna in Yevamot. How did Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai think that his example was a support for the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua over the opinion of Shimon haTeimani?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Tosfos quoted by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/29928/understanding-yevamot-413s-proof-of-who-exactly-is-a-mamzer?rq=1#comment75383_29928\">Double AA</a> answers (as far as I understand it):</p>\n\n<p>The point of אשת איש is not to specify the specific case involved, but rather to say it was from a capital case and emphasize that this Mamzer is a Mamzer according to the requirement that the relationship be a capital one (so don't think that we are being overly strict, we think it takes a capital-case to make a Mamzer). So Tosfos asks - why didn't it say that outright and more generally, why specify a married woman?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is that this was just the actual story (this person was the result of adultery), then [as you are asking] how does that support Rabbi Yehoshua's opinion at all? It is just an historical artifact.</p>\n\n<p>Tosfos answers that indeed the point is to emphasize the halacha, not the specific events, and the emphasis of a married woman is that it shows the extent to which a capital-crime relationship still creates a Mamzer, thus emphasizing that all capital-crime relationships are forbidden, even a married woman. This is because there are two more lenient aspects about a married woman over other capital-crime relationships.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The punishment is Chenek, the most lenient of the four capital punishments in the Torah.</li>\n<li>A married woman can become permitted during the lifetime of the one who forbids her (in other words, unlike a woman to her brother-in-law where her sister has to die in order to permit the relationship, no one needs to die in order to permit the relationship - she could have just gotten divorced).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>[Thus we see from here the answer to your underlying question of why not focus on the Kares aspect - as far as issues of Kares go, this is far from the most lenient, in fact, it is one of the most strict (as it also has a capital-crime aspect). Thus referencing a married woman over the general principle has no place if the general principle is one of Kares and not death by Beis Din, it is a case where it is questionable if the point would be Kares at all, so it would be much better to specify the general principle.]</p>\n\n<p>I heard from Rabbi Zalman Labkowski, in the name of his father, that there are three languages that Tosfos uses when it asks a question: קשה, ואם תאמר and תימה.</p>\n\n<p>קשה means the question isn't a strong question in Tosfos view, and if there is an answer, it completely removes the question and with the new understanding, you can learn the suggia without having the question.</p>\n\n<p>ואם תאמר is a strong question, but with an answer it is answered. So learning the suggia raises the question, which is properly answered (whereas in the first instance, once you know the answer, you can just learn it without raising the question).</p>\n\n<p>תימה means that the question is a very strong question, and the answer (if there is one) doesn't fully satisfy it.</p>\n\n<p>In this case it is a תימה, and as Double AA said, it doesn't fully satisfy.</p>\n\n\n",

World ORT is as much a 'movement' as an organisation. Yes, we were founded in St Petersburg in 1880 and, since then, we have become the world's largest Jewish education and vocational training NGO. The acronym ‘ORT’ comes from its original Russian name; ‘Organization for Rehabilitation and Training’ is a later innovation.<br>\nBut if we’re so big how come so little is known about us?! One reason may be the federal structure of the organisation: each country runs schools and programmes autonomously and over the years many people have grown up not realising that 'ORT' exists globally as well as locally.<br>\nAnother reason may be that, generally speaking, World ORT and its constituent national organisations have traditionally been more interested in ‘walking the walk’ than ‘talking the talk’. We are proud of the fact that only 6% of our income goes on administration because that means when people entrust their money to us they know that it will be used to give children (and adults) the opportunity to forge a better future for themselves. But it also means that precious little is left over for marketing and public relations budgets.

Details of all these – and MUCH more! – can be found at our website and you can keep updated via Facebook. \nWe are partners with the Jewish Federations of North America alongside the JDC and JAFI and count Jewish philanthropists and philanthropic funds among our supporters.

Also, one should not go on a pleasure trip on the day before the ninth of <em>Av</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<em>Mishna B'rura</em> comments that others condemn the practice of avoiding Torah study on the eighth, but my question is about the practice to forbid it.) Many practices are forbidden or frowned upon on the ninth: five main abstentions (eating, washing oneself, anointing oneself, marital relations, and wearing leather shoes), sitting on a chair, Torah study, greeting people with a blessing, conducting business, going on a pleasure trip. Why are Torah study and trips singled out as the two things extended to the eighth? I understand that a ban on eating is not extended: that's too difficult, even dangerous. But sitting on a chair? marital relations? greeting people? Why not? What's special about Torah study and trips?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>These two activities continue to bring pleasure to the person even after they are done. If a person learned properly, he would continue thinking about what he had learned. So too with a trip, a person would think about his joyful experience and derive pleasure from it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You are not the only one who was perplexed by this halacha as the MB brings several opinions (GR\"A, RaSHaL) that did not accept the Rama's ruling and the Biur Halacha (BH) seems to concur with them.</p>\n\n<p>The MB gives a reason that Torah study gladdens the heart, While the Magen Avraham says that since it is possible to learn those topics that are permitted on Tisha B'Av therefore the Rama did not ban torah study in a time when it's permitted. (erev TB)</p>\n\n<p>Interesting enough Tiyul is not mentioned in the MB/BH or in the original tshuva from the MaHaril (Shu\"T 44). I don't know how it got in there other to say as the BH says that people should not think once learning is forbidden they can take advantage of the time to take a pleasurable stroll.(BH)</p>\n\n<p>With all that said allow me to try a \"baala batesha pshat\"</p>\n\n<p>Just like Bedikat Chametz where we are concerned a person will become so engrossed in their learning that they will forget to start the bediaka on time, and there are even opinions that 30 minutes before the zman bedika it is forbidden to learn perhaps here too we were concerned that since torah learning is such an enjoyable experience that a person will become so engrossed in it and not stop when Tisha B'Av starts. Same thing with a pleasure trip.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly this don't pass the MY logic test but as I mentioned since the Maharil himself offered no reason for the issur AND many achronim actually rejected this minhag then we can take some freedoms and consider possible reasons. Also since the only source of the minhag of the Maharil himself then there is no reason to be more machmer than what the MaHaril wrote.</p>\n\n<p>sources </p>\n\n<p>The Rama, Orach Chayim 553, MB and Sh\"uT MaHaril 44</p>\n\n\n",

(See <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15829#showrashi=true&v=20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 21:20</a> and on)</p>\n\n<p>There are several parallels between the two reasons for the holiday. For example, In both cases (the unmarried girls dancing in the vineyards every 15th of Av, and the Binyaminites taking dancing girls in the vineyards):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The girls are dancing</li>\n<li>They are in vineyards</li>\n<li>Both stories happened where G-d's Temple was located. The Mishnah talks about the daughters of Yerushalaim (Where the Holy Temple was), and the story with the Binyaminites talks about the daughters of Shiloh dancing (Shiloh was where the Mishkan was at the time of the story)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both of these stories seem very similar. Are there any sources that discuss the connection between the two? Was the story with the Binyaminites the start of the yearly custom? Did the custom predate the story with the Binyaminites?</p>\n\n<p>I'm looking for sources that discuss this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I had always understood the Gemara as saying that the former was a result of the latter; after Binyamin survived as a result of women dancing in the vineyards, the minhag continued for the daughters to continue doing that. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/ant-5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Josephus (<em>An.</em> 5:2)</a> writes that the Benyaminite story happened on one of the three pilgrimage festivals. In his rendition, young women, like everyone else in the family, accompanied their fathers making the pilgrimage. They were commonly found <em>playing</em> in the fields, passing the time, but there was no matchmaking institution established then: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But when the senate were affrighted at the very name of perjury, a certain person told them that he could show them a way whereby they might procure the Benjamites wives enough, and yet keep their oath. They asked him what his proposal was. He said, \"That three times in a year, when we meet in Shiloh, our wives and our daughters accompany us: let then the Benjamites be allowed to steal away, and marry such women as they can catch, while we will neither incite them nor forbid them; and when their parents take it ill, and desire us to inflict punishment upon them, we will tell them, that they were themselves the cause of what had happened, by neglecting to guard their daughters, and that they ought not to be over angry at the Benjamites, since that anger was permitted to rise too high already.\" </p>\n  \n  <p>So when the festival was coming on, these two hundred Benjamites lay in ambush before the city, by two and three together, and waited for the coming of the virgins, in the vineyards and other places where they could lie concealed. Accordingly the virgins came along playing, and suspected nothing of what was coming upon them, and walked after an unguarded manner, so those that laid scattered in the road, rose up, and caught hold of them: by this means these Benjamites got them wives, and fell to agriculture, and took good care to recover their former happy state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even if <em>playing</em> implies dancing, there is no hint here that this was an established custom. But if the story took place on Tu B'Av, as Hazal write, it is noteworthy that this date marked the beginning of the grape harvest, and thus would be a time of rejoicing (and perhaps the start of gathering the grapes from the vineyards that night). But I'm unfamiliar with other sources that discuss this history. It <em>was</em> a common custom in other cultures, as Herodotus writes, to kidnap women specifically during holidays. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, there is evidence that some kind of women-dancing festival took place <em>before</em> the Benyaminite story. The Tanakh details women dancing in a number of places (such as when leaving Egypt, Ex. 15:19-21, and in celebrating the death of the Philistines, 1 Sam. 18:6-7). Eariler, in Shoftim 7:22, there is mention of a town called <em>Avel Meholah</em>, the <em>meadow of dancing</em>. This is where Elisha would be born. The curious name might suggest an area where the women of Shiloh danced during their harvest rejoicing. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Tu Ba'Av was the DATE they decided to engage in that particular form of dance-based matchmaking. It wasn't at random - that would be ineffectual in solving the, <em>ahem</em>, shidduch crisis plaguing the tribe of Binyamin. This was specifically arranged by Beis Din in order to circumvent the existing national neder against voluntarily marrying daughters off to the shevet of Binyamin.</p>\n\n<p>The continuation of that practice after the situation had been resolved was in commemoration of their reunion within Klal Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>I thought you were asking the weirder question - that this dancing seems to ALSO have been an annual custom on Yom Kippur - the gemara states \"sheba<strong>hen</strong>\" and not \"she<em>bah</em>,\" which implies that both were celebrated the same way. The gemara on 30b seems to be stating that this celebration was a natural result of the joyousness of the day making it prime time to engage in creating zivugim - \"Bishlama yom hakippurim de'is bay slichah umechilah <strong>yom shenitnah bo luchos achronos...</strong>\" The giving of the Aseres HaDibros and, consequently, the actual reception luchos at Har Sinai is specifically analogized to a wedding canopy (and a wedding is considered a mini-yom kippur for the participants, and they wear white, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Which is why the gemara considers it entirely obvious that women would go dancing to find a husband on yom kippur. Times have changed, I suppose...</p>\n\n\n",

Terms such as \"the hand of God\" or the like do not need to be taken as theological statements about God's anatomy, and those who make such an inference run afoul of one of the Rambam's 13 principles of faith (see also Mishneh Torah Yesodei HaTorah 1:8 and Hilchos Teshuvah 3:7). </p>\n\n<p>Generally, however, we have the concept from Chazal that “אֵין מִקְרָא יוֹצֵא מִידֵי פְּשׁוּטוֹ” Scripture doesn't depart from its plain meaning. (Yevamos 24a and elsewhere).   While this is a full discussion on its own, with its own limitations, this is a general principle that guided the Gedolei HaRishonim. Along these lines Rav Saadia Gaon wrote, “it is a well known fact that every statement found in the Bible is to be understood in its literal sense.” (Book of Belief and Opinions/Emunos v'Deos 7:2, Rosenblatt, page 265). And the Rambam explained that, “a mere argument in favour of a certain theory is not sufficient reason for rejecting the literal meaning of a Biblical text.” (Guide for the Perplexed II:25, Friedlander). There is precedent for taking interpretive liberties but one must beware of the limitations of both the Rishonim who speak on the matter as well as basic intellectual honesty.</p>\n\n\n",

In a sense I think you could make the case that the Rambam did not reject the plain meaning but what he viewed as an over simplistic reading.</p>\n\n<p>Along these lines the Rambam defends the plain meaning against Aristotelian philosophy (2:17) prior to giving his own interpretation. And <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/30000/899\">remember</a> the Rambam explained that, “a mere argument in favour of a certain theory is not sufficient reason for rejecting the literal meaning of a Biblical text.” (Guide for the Perplexed II:25, Friedlander).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam, in various places throughout his Mishneh Torah book, which is a book of <strong>Halacha's</strong>, clearly takes the creation account literally.

It is also called a “Moed,” a special time, as are the joyous holidays Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot.  This can be, and historically indeed was, a “special time” of punishment but ultimately, it will be a “special time” of Redemption and Rebuilding and Restoration – for the destroyed City of Jerusalem and Holy Temple and the diminished People of Israel, whose spiritual center they’d comprised.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/13540#.VbUGMflVhBc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/13540#.VbUGMflVhBc</a></p>\n\n<p>I found this answer.

It was also pointed out that Pi Eliyahu identifies the retzifi as the tinshames of Scripture, which is sometimes identified as a bat; however, Pi Eliyahu itself was explaining tinshames as a type of owl. The retzifi is clearly not the bat, which has its own name in Hebrew – atalef.\n  It turns out that it is possible to identify the retzifi, at least broadly. Tuv Ta’am, cited by Yashir Moshe, and Perek B’Shir, state that retzifi is a type of dove. This identification is supported by early manuscripts of Perek Shirah, which state yutzfi or dayutzfi in place of retzifi. Since the letters resh and dales are often interchanged, we can understand how this name became corrupted to become retzifi. The datzifi is mentioned in the Talmud (Chullin 62a) as being similar to a turtledove. Furthermore, Rabbeinu Chananel to Shabbos 81a states that the tziltzela, a bird mentioned in Shabbos 80b, is a type of small dove also called ritzifi (although Otzar HaGeonim states that the tziltzela is a bird the size of a dove with small eggs). It is not possible to conclusively determine which species of dove it is, but we are tentatively identifying it as the laughing dove, which is similar to the turtledove but smaller, and to which we can match an interpretation of the verse that is attached to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shoutout to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/3/waf\">WAF</a></p>\n\n\n",

According to this approach, when the Gemara rules that an item which both destroys and shaves is prohibited, and defined this item as being a razor, it did not merely mention a razor as an example of an item that achieves both of these requirements, but mentioned it in order to define which instrument is forbidden by the Torah to use. The Gemara explains that when the Torah forbade destroying and shaving one's beard, the Torah was referring to a razor which achieves both of these functions, and not to other instruments which are categorically permissible. It follows that even if one manipulates scissors to enable it to achieve השחתה, it is still permitted, since the Torah did not forbid the end result, but forbade the use of a specific instrument to achieve this result. What categorizes an item as scissors, which is permitted, or as a razor, which is forbidden, is the fact that a razor cuts using one blade, whereas scissors use two blades to cut.</p>\n<p>Based on this thesis, Rav Moshe permitted the use of shavers since they function as scissors, utilizing two blades to cut. The inner blade does not cut by itself, and must be assisted by the outer screen of the shaver. The screen traps a hair within it, and as the inner blade approaches it, the hair rubs along the side of the screen and they both cut the hair simultaneously.<sup>28</sup></p>\n<p>Although this was Rav Moshe’s primary heter to permit the use of shavers, he had an additional approach that followed a similar line of reasoning. He maintained that the only type of instrument that is prohibited, is one that most people use when they wish to achieve a close shave; all other instruments are permitted. Since most non-Jews use razors when they desire a close shave, all other instruments are therefore permitted. However, if for arguments sake, the general custom would change and people would only use shavers even if they desired a very close cut, razors would be permitted and shavers would be forbidden.<sup>29</sup></p>\n<p>Footnote 28: Thus I heard in the form of \"reliable testimony\" (עדות נאמנה) from Rav Belsky, Rav Dovid Feinstein and Rav Reuven Feinstein</p>\n<p>Footnote 29: Thus I head from Rav Reuven Feinstein</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think it would follow, then, that any straight blade that cuts on its own as a razor is prohibited for shaving purposes, whether or not it does a good job.</p>\n\n\n",

One should bear in mind that the widespread heter to use electric shavers is primarily because Rav Moshe, being the posek hador of the past generation, permitted their use. Most poskim in Eretz Yisroel on the other hand, forbade their use. Consequently, it is questionable how a person who relies on Rav Moshe’s shitah with regard to shaving, can go ahead and use a lift and cut shaver which Rav Moshe himself was skeptical about.31</p>\n<p>Footnote 31: This is what I heard from Rav Belsky, Rav Dovid Feinstein and Rav Reuven Feinstein. See Halichot Shelomo page 11 who gives another rationale to permit shaving...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why was Rav Moshe Feinstein skeptical about lift and cut shavers? What makes their halachic status different from other electric shavers, which he permitted based on the idea that they act like scissors rather than like a razor? Doesn't the lift and cut shaver do the same thing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In theory, the \"lift-and-cut\" is lifting the hair from under the skin's surface and therefore cutting <em>below</em> the surface of the skin. This is what a razor does (based on the motion of how it drags the skin), whereas a scissor never goes below the surface.</p>\n\n<p>I must observe that Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's grandson-in-law and student, Rabbi Shabtai Rappoport shlit'a, has looked at the patent applications for these \"lift-and-cut\" shavers, which he considers more truthful than their marketing materials. The patents don't sound like it's really cutting as close as a razor.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>there are two aspects to the prohibition of shaving which are cutting and destroying. in theory one could only do one of those and not be breaking the halachah. for this reason scissors or hair removal creams/powders have been used without problem. the electric razor has been compared to the cutting of scissors. the introduction of the lift technology might be introducing an aspect of destroying comparable to using tweezers. thus a shaver with a lift mechanism may be both destroying and cutting the hair at the same time. If one is concerned the lift device is removable from most shavers who have this. the other view is that since the shaver has a screen which separates the blade from the face there is no concern of both destroying and cutting and the electric shaver is just like scissors.  There are many views on the discussion of shaving and it is best to talk to your rav about what decision you should follow</p>\n\n\n",

The Torah could simply write \"and he did so\" after each ויאמר ה׳ אל משה (and Hashem said to Moshe) occurrence. Why repeat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Firstly, not \"everything\" is repeated exactly the same, in many of the cases details are added and/or not repeated.  This is noted by Netziv to 8:13, where it states Vayaasu Chein, and then repeats the details. Netziv notes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויעשו כן, ויט אהרן את ידו וגו׳ – כפל הוא לפי הנראה, דאחר שכתוב ״ויעשו כן״ ידענו מה שעשה אהרן. או להיפך, לכתוב ׳ויט אהרן׳ וגו׳, כמו בצפרדעים לעיל פסוק ב׳.\n  אלא משום שלפי הנראה שינה אהרן ממשמעות לשון הציווי...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>RDZ Hoffman asks this question in a slightly different form (Shemos 7:20), namely, that it does say Vayaasu Chein Kaasher Tzivah Hashem in that Passuk, in addition to the repetition.  He answers that the details repeated are just what Pharaoh saw:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וירם במטה – בתיאור ביצוע ציוויו של ה׳ אין הכתוב מזכיר פרטים, <strong>ואמנם אין צורך בכך, שהרי נאמר במפורש ״ויעשו כן משה ואהרן״. מודגש רק המעשה שנעשה לעיני פרעה</strong>, אשר לא ראה מה שנעשה באותה שעה בכל ארצו. לעיני פרעה ולעיני עבדיו נראה הנס שמשה בישרו בפסוקים יז-יח – ״וירם ידו״, אהרן הרים את ידו שבה המטה, ״ויהפכו כל המים״, במכה אחת זו הפכו כל מימי מצרים לדם; ״והדגה אשר ביאור״ וגו׳ גם זה התרחש לעיני פרעה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also Or Hachaim to 7:10, 7:20, and 7:21 who explains the double wording of Vayaasu Chein and Kaasher Tzvivah Hashem in a number of ways, and I believe that some of his answers may apply to why the additional details would be repeated, but he does not discuss this directly.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a couple of my own thoughts, which I have not found anywhere:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They may be repeated detail by detail in order to show that Mosheh/Aharon performed these miracles <strong>detail by detail</strong> in front of the Chartumim, and the Chartumim still could not perform them.</li>\n<li>To show that Mosheh and Aharon performed every detail that they had promised, <strong>in contrast</strong> to Pharaoh, who constantly retracts and does not follow through on his own promises/deals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> notes (at the end of his commentary on Parshas Pekudei) that there is a troubling problem that the Torah is often repetitive, though being perfect it should not contain needless repetition. He writes that \"until today\" he has not found a satisfactory explanation for this tendency. However, he does offer two suggestions to explain the general tendency (apart from any reasons that can explain a specific instance of repetition).</p>\n\n<p>1) That was the way people talked then, so the Torah spoke this way as well.</p>\n\n<p>2) The Torah is often very brief on very deep matters. The reader might think this is because the Torah is generally very brief and it is not because there is something very deep that needs to be extracted from the text. Therefore, the Torah is very lengthy in other places to show the reader that any brevity is not simply because the Torah is always brief; rather, it is because of the depth of the specific discussion, and the reader should know that he must delve into it to properly understand it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וראוי שנעיין בהתרת ספק עמוק יקרה בזה הסיפור וברבים מסיפורי התורה וזה\n  שהוא ראוי בתורה מצד שלמותה שלא יהיה בדבריה כפל ומוֹתר ואנחנו רואים בזה\n  המקום הכפל ידמה שיהיה לבלתי צורך כי היה די בשיאמר ויעש בצלאל בן אורי\n  בן חור את כל מלאכת המשכן כאשר צוה ה' את משה ואתו אהליאב בן אחיסמך וגו'\n  וכבר מצאנו כמו זה ההכפל במקומות רבים מן התורה ולא מצאנו עד היום בזה\n  סיבה כוללת מספקת  ואפשר שנאמר שכבר היה מנהג האנשים ההם בזמן מתן תורה\n  שיהיו סיפוריהם בזה האופן והנביא ידבר לפי מנהגו או נאמר כי מפני שקיצרה\n  התורה במקומות העמוקים האריכה זה האריכות במקומות האחרים אשר האריכות בהם\n  בלתי מזיק כדי שלא נחשוב כי הקיצור היה במקומות ההם לפי שמנהג התורה הוא\n  לדבר בקיצור וזה שכבר נראה ממנהגה לדבר באריכות וזה ממה שיביאנו לבקש\n  הסיבה מפני מה קיצרה התורה במקומות ההם ונעמוד מפני זה על טבע הנושא אשר\n  בו הדברים ההם כי הוא הסיבה בקיצור ההוא ונעמוד מפני זה על כונת התורה\n  באותם הדברים הקצרים כשנעיין בהם בכל הצדדין שאפשר לעמוד מהם על כונותיהם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the biblical criticism approach, the book of Exodus originally contained a story about Moses alone. Then the authors of Leviticus (\"The Priestly Source\") added in the part about Aharon.</p>\n\n<p>In this view, the duplicity arises from merging the original source that contained only the version in which Moses threatens and then carries out the plague, with a second version involving Moses telling Aharon to carry out the plague.</p>\n\n<p>Some additional context and references can be found in this blog post:\n<a href=\"https://isthatinthebible.wordpress.com/2014/11/20/exodus-and-the-plagues-of-egypt/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://isthatinthebible.wordpress.com/2014/11/20/exodus-and-the-plagues-of-egypt/</a></p>\n\n\n",

True freedom means doing what you really want to do! What a person really wants to do, is to be good - to become more G-dly. However, the yetzer hara (inclination towards evil) fights to prevent a person from doing this. By G-d's commanding a person to be good, he has a fighting chance to reach his goal. So the yoke of torah and mitzvos, athough it may seem restricting is actually the path towards true freedom, since it forces one to do what he deep down really wants to do. </p>\n\n<p>from: <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=305\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=305</a></p>\n\n<p>Hence, the slavery was for the Jews' benefit.

She does not have the strength to tell the manager that she is unable to do so, or to offer to work any other days. These actions also lead her to many other things that jeopardize her emunah (faith). This job is for non-Jews (religious Christian) that are unable to understand her religious faith, and she gets harassed often for it. If I have the ability to get her fired from this job, is it permissible according to Halacha to go through with this, in order to teach her not to work on Shabbos?

However, I see some issues with the approach you're proposing here.</p>\n\n<p>How do you think she will react when she finds out what happened? \"Is this the reward of torah, that I should lose my livelihood for it?\"  Yes working on Shabbat is a serious violation of halacha, but you will not increase her respect for Shabbat by interfering with her job.  You could even, chas v'shalom, end up pushing her away -- that <em>chillul Hashem</em> you worry about in the question.  Unless you are very close to her and are very sure of her reaction, I wouldn't try that.</p>\n\n<p>If she's on a path to becoming frum there are probably lots of things she needs to change.  If you help her to work on some of the others, guiding her in things <em>she</em> can do rather than doing it for her, then you (a) increase her observance and (b) establish a better relationship with her, enabling you to help her more in the future.  Letting <em>her</em> alter her employment situation (when she's ready) seems the wiser path.</p>\n\n<p>You can best help her by helping her to accept mitzvot for herself, rather than trying to force the issue.

However a reading of the Mishna Berura 10 seems to say that a minor can work on producing the parchment. Recently I saw a sign posted in a store in Yerushalayim that was saying that the recent trend to allow boys who are becoming Bar Mitzva to place their own Parshios into the Batim is against Halacha as all parts of the Tefilin making must be done by a adult. Well Mishna Berura allows a child to produce parchment and does not mention this prohibition of a minor installing the Parshios. It mentions not allowing a minor to make the Batim, the Shin, the sewing, and the knots.

Does <em>Rashi</em>'s commentary on the <em>Bavli</em>'s quotation of the <em>mishna</em> reflect his interpretation of the <em>mishna</em> per se, or does it reflect only his interpretation of the <em>mishna</em> as used in the <em>Bavli</em>? In other words, where there is ambiguity in a <em>mishna</em>, multiple ways to read it, does what <em>Rashi</em> writes when the <em>mishna</em> is quoted somewhere reflect only his belief as to how the <em>Bavli</em> reads it (and so any inconsistency is only a problem if it carries through to the <em>Bavli</em>'s conclusion), or does it reflect his belief as to what the <em>mishna</em> itself means (and so should be consistent every time the <em>mishna</em> is quoted)?</p>\n\n<p>I strongly suspect the former is true: in particular, I seem to recall having seen instances where a <em>mishna</em> is interpreted by <em>Rashi</em> in a way that satisfies only the initial theory (\"<em>hava amina</em>\") of a passage in the <em>Bavli</em>.

As such, you will find that his interpretation of any given mishna will vary depending on the context in which the gemara is quoting it. To give you an example, consider Shevi'it 4:10. There, the mishna asks and answers a question as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מאימתי אין קוצצין האילן בשביעית? בית שמאי אומרים: כל האילן משיוציא</p>\n  \n  <p>At what point is one not allowed to chop down trees in the seventh\n  year? According to the school of Shammai, as soon as it produces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Produces what? It is the Rambam's opinion (and that of the Bartenura) that this is a reference to the production of foliage - which occurs, the Bartenura states, during Nissan. By way of contrast, Prof. Hanoch Albeck understands the mishna to be referring to the time when trees begin to produce <em>fruit</em>. What does Rashi say? As is noted by R' Shlomo Adeni (Melekhet Shlomo), Rashi is contradictory.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=36b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berakhot 36b</a>, this mishna is quoted in the context of delineating which parts of fruits are <em>shomrim</em> to the rest (ie: that which might not normally be considered an actual part of the fruit, but which combines with the rest for the purpose of rendering it <em>tamei</em>). Rashi explicates the mishna as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>משיוציא</strong>. את הפרי</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>As soon as it produces</strong>: its fruit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Compare that to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=52b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pesachim 52b</a>, where the context more directly relates to the point at which trees in the seventh year are forbidden from being cut down. There, Rashi says the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>משיוציאו</strong>: תחילת העלין בימי ניסן</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>As soon as they produce</strong>: the first of their foliage during Nissan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Besides for the Tosafos Yom Tov cited by @Menachem there are a couple of other sources:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechezkel_Landau\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Said Rav Yehuda said Sh'muel: It is a place where rainwater gathers [sholelin]. <em>I.e. fall down, and get directed (to gather), from the language \"for your olives shall drop off (<strong>יִשַּׁ֖ל</strong>)\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.28.40?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%99%D6%B4%D7%A9%D7%81%D6%BC%D6%B7%D6%96%D7%9C&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 28:40</a>) and also it is written \"But you must also pull (<strong>שֹׁל־תָּשֹׁ֥לּוּ</strong>) some [sheaves] out of the heaps for her...\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ruth.2.16?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ruth 2:16</a>).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi comments both cases suggested by Sefer haArukh. His comment on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.28.40?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%99%D6%B4%D7%A9%D7%81%D6%BC%D6%B7%D6%96%D7%9C&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 28:40</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ישל means, it (the olive tree) shall drop its fruits. It is similar in meaning to the verb in (Deuteronomy 19:5), \"And the iron falleth off (ונשל).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His comment on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ruth.2.16?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ruth 2:16</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And let [some sheaves] fall for her. שֹׁל תָּשֹׁלּוּ =] you should forget; pretend as though you are forgetting. The Targum for שְׁגָגָה [=oversight], is שְׁלוּתָא, (Bamidbar 15:25).  And similarly, “because of this error.” (II Shmuel 6:7).  <em>Another explanation [of שֹׁל תָּשֹׁלּוּ is “let fall”], an expression [as in,] “your olive tree will cast off [= יִשַּׁל [its fruit].” (Devarim 28:40)</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both of the last two comments of Rashi point a related meaning of \"dropping\" and \"getting directed\" which is close to \"gathering\" that Rashi uses for <em>shelulis</em>. The roots that have meaning distribute, divide do not have representation with letters של. Therefore, one can say that Rashi's comment of the root שלל is dictated by the etymological rule about the כפולים roots, which was later coined by R' Sh.-R. Hirsch. Others authorities do not subscribe to such a rule in this case.</p>\n\n\n",

However in a footnote he writes \"All what I have written is only a discussion and not to be relied on, for all of Israel refrained all these years from moving an electric light on Shabbos and it appears as <a href=\"http://www.dinonline.org/2012/08/14/definition-of-uvdin-de-chol/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">uvdin dchol</a>  (the work of the weekday) and also we must worry that people may think it is permitted to move for Halacha does not consider it  a fire (and may come to use electricity on Shabbos).

In sefer \"Halacha Shleima\" (54:2) writes how he heard from the author of Tiltulei Shabbbos that Rabbi Feinstein held it was permitted  and told him to write in english it is assur because it is similar to a fire and people might get confused and come to carry a fire.</p>\n\n<p>There is a specific type of Muktzeh prohibition for a lit fire (See Shabbos 45a).

From his description it is clear that the attire protected the Tzniut of the rider (who was not riding sidesaddle) by covering her from considerably above the waist and downward. Women would not ride camels sidesaddle as the height made this dangerous (Pesachim 3b) but it was the custom for women to ride donkeys sidesaddle except when the terrain was mountainous (in which case this too was dangerous). From the above one learns that it is permitted for a woman to ride a horse- which is both faster and higher than a donkey- in the normal way as long as she is careful to dress so that Tzniut is not sacrificed. There are books and pamphlets describing what clothing is required for Tzniut.

Is this permissible? If so, should they look for a Jewish doctor only?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>In short, you need a Jewish person to do the circumcision לכתחילה. The basis for this is Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah Siman 264:\n\"Every Jew is eligible to perform circumcision, including someone who is himself uncircumcised because his brothers had dies as a result of circumcision. If an adult Jewish male is present who knows how to circumcise he takes precedence. However a non-Jew, even if circumcised, may not perform the circumcision under any instances. If, however, he did perform a circumcision there is no need to repeat it.\" </p>\n\n<p>In Sefer Nishmat Avraham- Yoreh Deah Siman 264 this question is asked. The <em>Shach</em>, quoting the <em>Beit Yosef</em>, writes that both opinions(quoted by him) agree that if the circumcision is not done for the purpose of fulfilling the Mitzvah, or if it is done by a non-Jewish surgeon, then <em>hatafat dam brit</em> will be needed. However the <em>Sha'agat Aryeh</em> rules like those poskim who do not requite <em>hatafat dam brit</em>. The Meiri's(a rishon) ruling supports that of the <em>Sha'agat Aryeh</em>. The <em>Meiri</em> writes that if a non-Jew circumcised a baby there is no need (for a Jew) to circumcise him again since in any case he is no longer uncircumcised. Moreover, there is no need for <em>hatafat dam brit</em> either, for there is no longer a possibility that there is foreskin hidden within the atarah.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Auerbach zt\"l told the author of Nishmat Avraham that for a baby who had surgery, it would be best to do <em>hatafat dam brit</em> in order to fulfill all opinions. </p>\n\n<p>If this has actually significance, please CYLOR</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I think the question confuses two different things</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the nature of the brit mila itself vs. a medical circumcision</li>\n<li>the nature of the mohel vs. a doctor and the location of a brit mila (hospital vs. home/synagogue)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So for the long-term record:</p>\n\n<p>A brit mila is not the same as a medical circumcision as routinely practiced in hospitals (e.g., <a href=\"https://secure02.kidshealth.org/parent/system/surgical/circumcision.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this source</a> says approximately 55%-65% of all newborn boys are circumcised in the United States each year). The process of the brit mila involved a number of steps which would not be required in a medical circumcision and which are performed because of halakha - not because of any medical reasons.</p>\n\n<p>The question of a doctor vs. mohel is separate. A mohel is trained in the halakhot of brit mila. Some mohelim are doctors, most are not. Most mohelim have done thousands of brit mila before, most doctors have done much fewer.</p>\n\n<p>A brit mila can theoretically be performed in a hospital although most are not since the risk of complications is very low (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4474068,00.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">less than one complication per 2,000 circumcisions in Israel in 2013</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a medical circumcision performed by a doctor (even Jewish) who is not a mohel doesn't meet the criteria of halacha - even if it might be acceptable <em>bdi'eved</em> (<em>a posteriori</em>) - <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10103/how-do-you-cylor-after-posting-on-judaism-stackexchange-com\">CYLOR</a> for ways to address this </li>\n<li>a brit mila can be performed by any trained mohel; some mohelim are also doctors and it can be done either in a hospital, a home or a synagogue</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

I'd like to know which is authoritative. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>This is a question into which I have done a little bit of research.  </p>\n\n<p>There are two independent issues:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Saying ה שפתי תפתח before the עמידה</li>\n<li>Taking three steps forward or back or both, which is an issue in itself</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Saying ה שפתי תפתח is attributed to R. Yohanan in Brakhot 4b</p>\n\n<p>והא אמר רבי יוחנן בתחלה אומר ה' שפתי תפתח ולבסוף הוא אומר יהיו לרצון אמרי פי</p>\n\n<p>and the statement is a little clearer in the Yerushalmi Berakhot 8a:</p>\n\n<p>רבי יוסי ציידניא בשם רבי יוחנן לפני תפילתו הוא או' ה' שפתי תפתח ופי יגיד תהילתך לאחר תפילתו הוא אומר יהיו לרצון אמרי פי והגיון לבי לפניך ה' צורי וגואלי</p>\n\n<p>Taking three steps is more complicated:\nYoma 53b has the following statement:</p>\n\n<p>אמר רבי אלכסנדרי אמר רבי יהושע בן לוי: המתפלל צריך שיפסיע שלש פסיעות לאחוריו, ואחר כך יתן שלום</p>\n\n<p>There is no indication of when these steps are taken, or what exactly ואחר כך יתן שלום means.  But it seems clear from the context that this is referring to the end of the Amidah.  So we have a source in the Talmud for taking three steps backwards at the end of the Amidah, but nothing about three steps forward, nor anything about the beginning of the Amidah.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi in his siddur mentions that we take three steps forward before the Amidah, and three steps backwards.  These three steps forward at the beginning of the Amidah appear to have developed as a \"mirror image\" of the three steps backwards at the conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>Mishnah Berurah OH 95:3 writes:</p>\n\n<p>ילך לפניו - ואין צריך לחזור לאחוריו כדי לילך לפניו כ\"כ הא\"ר אבל מנהג העולם לילך לאחוריו</p>\n\n<p>which seems to imply that the reason we take three steps backwards is essentially to have space to take the three steps forward, but it's the three steps forward that actually \"count\" - those are the steps with which we symbolically step into the presence of the רבונו של עולם</p>\n\n<p>Finally, regarding the steps at the END of the Amidah, the Magen Avraham writes (OH 123:2):</p>\n\n<p>ואחר שפסע - לא כאותן שאומרים עושה שלום בעוד שפוסעין דאין נכון לעשות כן </p>\n\n<p>The Magen Avraham disagrees with those who take their three steps backwards at the conclusion of the Amidah WHILE saying the words עושה שלום במרומיו.  Although he does not state so explicitly, one could assume that he would also disagree with the practice of taking three steps backwards and forwards - one word per step - when saying ה שפתי תפתח at the beginning of the Amidah.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to finally try to answer your question; you asked which opinion is \"authoritative\":</p>\n\n<p>I don't believe that there is an authoritative answer to this question because it is a matter of custom.  Though some may disagree with me on that, as my example in a moment will show.</p>\n\n<p>I started out writing that I have done some research on this topic, which has included polling several hundred people about their own personal practice.  Because this is a practice that people do silently and on their own, we don't usually notice what other people do.  Furthermore, I think it is the sort of custom that we are unlikely to change from the way that we learn to do it when we first learn to say the Amidah, because in the absence of seeing others do it differently, we have no reason to change our practice.  Consequently, I think that my polling method accurately reflects what people learned about taking steps when they first learn (usually as children) to say the Amidah.</p>\n\n<p>My polling has shown that slightly over half of the people I've polled practice (B) of your choices above, that is, they take their three steps backwards and three steps forward while saying the six words of ה שפתי תפתח ופי יגיד תהלתיך - one word per step.</p>\n\n<p>What is really interesting though is the other half.

Does the Mitzvah to publicize it still apply, assuming that after the long duration the owner is probably yeush (has abandoned hope)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In short, yes.</p>\n\n<p>You seem to be talking of a case where someone found a lost object that had identifying marks and some degree of value, and there was no reason to believe that the owner gave up hope of finding it before you picked it up. That would give the finder the requirement to guard it which, at that point, can't be nullified by the owner giving up hope. The finder must still publicize it and return it.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5764/kiseitzei.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article by Rabbi Neustadt</a> who reviews the relevant halachos (he cites the original sources there). The relevant section is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the owner despaired of recovering his loss, the finder may keep the item. The halachah considers it as if the item has now become his, since the owner forsook ownership once he despaired of ever recovering his loss.</p>\n  \n  <p>But this applies <strong>only if the owner despaired of recovering his loss before the item was found</strong>. If, however, the item was found before the owner realized he had lost it [and before he had a chance to give up hope of finding it], then the finder must return the item to its owner - even though the owner had subsequently despaired of recovering it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if someone found the item before the owner gave up hope, they are still obligated to return it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do we celebrate the 15th of Av?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=26b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bab. Ta'anith 26b</a>) tells us that the 15 of Av was a fantastically happy time celebrated with joyous festivals.  Why?</p>\n\n<p>One reason given is that the traveling Israelites who left Egypt stopped dying. Since we have a tradition that none of those who left, except for Kalev and Yehoshua', were permitted to enter the land, presumably this is because the last person from that generation finally died.  Also, since there were certainly children who left, and since they wandered the wilderness for 40 years, this also tells us that youngest person of that generation died at younger than 40 years (if the person was a newborn when they left, and the 40 years of wandering hadn't ended yet).  This does not sound like a great thing to celebrate.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason given is that the tribes were given permission to intermarry.  This had to do with land ownership and tribal autonomy.  Presumably, then, the land had been fully settled at this point, which allowed the tribes to intermarry without worrying that any land disputes would arise.  However, we know that parts of the land never did get properly settled (eg., Eretz HaPelishtim), and even if they had been, this shows that the new immigrants couldn't trust each other.  This also does not seem like grounds for celebration.</p>\n\n<p>A third reason given is that the tribe of Binyamin was re-integrated after a bitter civil war.  OK, that's good.  But their numbers were decimated, and this was really just a concession that they had gone out of bounds and were accepting the terms of their surrender and shame.</p>\n\n<p>Removing roadblocks to Yerushalayim and burying the dead of Beitar, two other reasons given, seem to also be examples of the end of a tragedy, and the final reason given, the conclusion of preparation of the wood (on an annual basis) for the firewood for the Altar, seems like the only event that might warrant an institutional celebration, but it's one that might be done in the city and the confines of the Beith HaMikdash, not necessarily throughout the land.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what's the real* reason this day is celebrated so joyously?</strong></p>\n\n<p><sub>*Perhaps \"underlying\" is a better word to use here.  Several different versions of this question are floating around in my head; one version wonders if there is some historical or cultural significance to this date that might be explained Aggadically.</sub></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Bnei Yissaschar says that the famous Gemara that says that 40 days prior to the creation of a child a Bas Kol goes out and says Bas Ploni L'ploni. Yom Rishon that the world was created was on 25 Elul. 40 days prior is 15 Av. Since the world was created Bshvil Yisroel and we are the bride of Hashem, therefore 40 days prior to the creation, which is 15 Av a Bas Kol went out and said that Bnei Yisroel will be betrothed to Hashem. That is the reason 15 Av was the day that Bnos Yisroel would look for Shiduchim and that is the reason other marriage related items have happened on this day. The celebration is the Simcha of being singled out for Hakodosh Boruch Hu.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is an essay on Chabad.org, based on a teaching of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, titled <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/53683/jewish/The-Day-of-the-Breaking-of-the-Ax.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Day of the Breaking of the Ax</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The moon continually waxes and wanes. Every time the moon disappears (new moon) it is only a prelude to the full moon.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each month possesses a character and quality uniquely its own, which undergoes a cycle of diminution and growth, concealment and expression, reaching its climax on the 15th of the month.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>(although it is not mentioned in this essay, a similar idea is brought by R' Bechaya that Shlomo Hamelech was 15 generations from Avraham, just like the moon is full 15 days after the new moon. -- see <a href=\"http://www.closetotorah.com/2012/01/introduction-2-like-father-like-son-tehillim-themes/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</em>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therein lies the specialty of the 15th of Av.</p>\n<p>The greater an object’s plunge down a mountainside, the greater the momentum that carries it up the next mountain; the further an arrow is pulled back on the bow, the greater the force that will carry it forward when it is let fly. This basic law of physical nature also governs the flow of lunar time and the spiritual qualities it enfolds: the lower the descent, the loftier the ascent to follow.</p>\n<p>Hence, the month of Av must indeed possess the greatest 15th of them all. For what darker eclipse is there than the one preceding the full moon of Av?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The essay then goes on to explain how each of the events occurring on the 15th of Av mentioned in the Talmud represent an ascent from a previous descent, which is what makes the day so special. <em>(more so than the 15th of Nissan or Tishre, which the Talmud says does not compare to the 15th of Av)</em></p>\n<p>I'm not doing the essay justice at all, please read it inside.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I also read something that I'd have to find a source for, but can perhaps be connected to this thought. The 15th of Av was not the day the decree that the Jews would die in the desert ended. The decree actually ended a year before, the 9th of Av when the last person died.</p>\n<p>After that day, the decree was over, they just didn't know it until the following year on the 15th of Av. so the 15th of Av celebrates not the end of the decree, but the revelation of the end of the decree. The knowledge that the decree is over is the happy occasion (the Jews spent the whole year thinking they would die on the following 9th of Av).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The day was known as the last day to gather wood for the altars, the atzei ha'maaracha. Anyone familiar with Israel before the UJA knows that wood in the Mideast is a rarity, so there presumably was a large group of men dedicated to gathering the needed wood. The last day was Tu b'Av, because wood needs to age (season) before it will burn well, and after Tu there wasn't enough time before the rainy season. \nNet result, many men were free of work starting on Tu b'Av. Obviously, these were the least-educated men, and had they not been busy with finding a mate could be a source of problems, their counterpart to our OTD issue today.\nThe girls dancing would logically be also the least desirable, in terms of shidduch material, so likewise there's simcha in getting themn married off.\nMost logical, only with this understanding of who this was for does the Mishna make sense, because \"good\" men know not to look for riches or just beauty!\nEverything fits, but I have absolutely no source for this at all. Still, Occam's razor works.</p>\n\n\n",

The lines between serve as explaining what is happening - they give the context to who says those lines and how they say it.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the congregation saying them out loud</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Kedushas Yotzer: the Rama in O.C. 59:3 says the congregation should say the lines of Kedusha out loud.</p></li>\n<li><p>Kedushas Uva Letzion: Rama in O.C. 132:1 says that the Aramaic should be said silently, but the implication is that the verses have the same rules as by Kedushas Yotzer.  The Avudarham implies that the final verse, Hashem yimloch, should be said quietly.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In terms of skipping ahead to say it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>the Mishna Berura in 132:3 says regarding Kedushas Uva Letzion that if you have not yet said Ashrei, you should skip ahead to respond with the congregation.  In Shaar Hatziun he cites Magen Avraham that even before you have davened you should skip ahead, but he concludes that this is not the minhag. </p></li>\n<li><p>Regarding Kedushas Yotzer, it is not explicit, but it would seem to me that it depends on whether or not you will say it by your self when you get there - the Mechaber O.C. 59:3 brings two opinions as to whether an individual says Kedushas Yotzer on his own, and the Rama concludes that he does.  The Vilna Gaon says that he shouldn't.  The Gemara in Berachos 21b has a dispute if one comes into the synagogue and finds the congregation already davening, whether he should start davening if he will not be finished in time to say Kedusha with the congregation:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב הונא הנכנס לבית הכנסת ומצא צבור שמתפללין אם יכול להתחיל ולגמור עד שלא יגיע ש\"ץ למודים יתפלל ואם לאו אל יתפלל ריב\"ל אמר אם יכול להתחיל ולגמור עד שלא יגיע ש\"צ לקדושה יתפלל ואם לאו אל יתפלל במאי קא מפלגי מר סבר יחיד אומר קדושה ומר סבר אין יחיד אומר קדושה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Huna holds he should start, and doesn't have to worry about missing Kedusha with the congregation because he will say it on his own.  R' Yehoshua ben Levi holds that you should not start if you won't be able to say Kedusha with the congregation, because he holds you will not say it on your own.  But both agree that would you be saying it on your own, you wouldn't need to go out of your way to ensure saying it with the congregations.  So it seems that if you will say it on your own, you need not worry about saying it with the congregation.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I would have assumed the Rama would tell you not to jump ahead, and the Vilna Gaon would tell you to jump ahead.</p>\n\n<p>However, the same logic could have applied by Kedushas Uva Letzion, and yet it is brought there without qualification that you should skip ahead.</p>\n\n\n",

From Far Rockaway to West Hempstead you have to pass over at least three major highways (I878, Sunrise Highway, and The Southern State Parkway). All are significantly wider that 70 cubits. Water features (lakes and rivers) also complicate matters.</p>\n\n<p>There is an additional halacha that when 6 houses are within 70 of each other, to join with another group of 6 houses, the distance between them can be up to 140 amos (roughly between 210 to 280 feet). This can get us over the 878 and possibly the Southern State, but Sunrise Highway with the LIRR tracks is even wider that this.</p>\n\n<p>A Techum is established by a) figureing out what the halachic dimentions of the city is (which houses are close enough together) B) in most cases \"squareing the city\" drawing a north-south line at the eastmost and westmost points in the city and a east-west line at the northern and southern ends of the city. The Techum is 2000 amos from the lines drawn. It is possible that the squaring of the city could bring west hempstead in to the techum, I dont have the time or expertise to even try to do somthing like this, even from google maps.

Rav Hirsch called it Torah im Derekh Eretz and others call it Torah Umaddah. Within these two approaches the ongoing debate is whether Torah and secular studies (or just 'Wisdom') are both useful but mutually exclusive or whether they should be approached in 'synthesis' and whether maddah is a means or and ends.</p>\n\n<p>Your specific examples, I believe, could include many other things such as (e.g.) botany; which can help you understand certain gemaras (sometimes I wonder how one could understand some gemaras without it), or provide you with peace and tranquility in tending your garden, learning to nuture nature, or as tool to educate children.</p>\n\n<p>Norman Lamm in \"Torah Umadda\" delineates a number of approaches to the topic and also tackles whether Wisdom (in and of itself) can ever be considered talmud Torah. The sections below correspond to chapters from Norman Lamm's Torah Umaddah:</p>\n\n<p>1) Rambam. Being a master of secular wisdom he (according to Lamm) speaks of secular studies and the \"obligation to pursue them as an act of mitzvah\". Rabbi Kapah (ha-yahas le'limmudei hol be'yahadut, p.68) \"if one studies all these disciplines and sciences which for some reason are called 'secular', in order thereby to attain greater understanding and knowledge of G-d - which is the foundation of all wisdom and without which, according to Maimonides, it is impossible to reach such a state of knowledge - such studies are the holy of holies\". \"Maimonides... holds that Wisdom has talmud Torah value\" (p.139 Torah Umaddah)</p>\n\n<p>2) R S.R. Hirsch - Torah im Derekh Eretz. Torah and Wisdom are not at loggerheads. Torah is the everpresent rock whereas Wisdom is changing and developing. Lamm writes interpreting Hirsch: \"they can cooperate, even as the limbs of the body cooperate and coordinate but they cannot interact substantively, even as a sane and balanced person does not interact with or talk to himself... the secular studies help us to understand Torah more deeply...\". So it appears from this approach that Wisdom may not directly be considered talmud Torah.</p>\n\n<p>3) Rav Kook approach: \"the sacred is not antagonistic to science, but first he reminds us that it vitalises all; it is that which gives life to the secular disciplines. <em>Kodesh</em> and <em>hol</em> are functionally and indissolubly related to each other \"The sacred must be established on the foundation of the profane... the stronger the secular, the more significant the sacred\". So secular knowledge should be of superior quality if the sacred is to benefit.\"</p>\n\n<p>4) Hechsher Mitzvah. Wisdom is a means not an end. Hence not talmud Torah.</p>\n\n<p>5) Chassidic Approach. One avodah in chassidut is to sanctify the profane. Lamm argues that it could be extrapolated that secular studies, when undertaken properly can be elevated to the level of kodesh. Perhaps not 'talmud Torah' but of great merit.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While this is largely related to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/30108/899\">bondonk's answer</a> I would like to narrow the focus a little more closely on the question as asked and expand on relevant points.</p>\n\n<p>The study of mathematics to help in understand the Gemara is an excellent example of what Rabbi Norman Lamm <em>shlita</em> refers to as <em>heksher mitzvah</em>, an act of preparation for a mitzvah, discussed in chapter 8 of his work <em>Torah Umadda</em>.  As noted there (somewhat tangentially) this is in compliance with the <em>halachah</em> in Orach Chaim 231 that even an act which is \"permitted\" to be preformed must be done \"for the sake of heaven\", i.e. to facilitate serving G-d through preforming <em>mitzvos</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The corpus of \"other [branches of] Wisdom\" or Madda thus helps one better to understand the depths of Torah. It is a <em>heksher mitzvah</em>... (ibid page 156)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nevertheless Rabbi Lamm does present a model which he suggests would subsume such [otherwise] secular studies under the category of <em>Limud Torah</em>.  The model Rabbi Lamm calls \"the Rationalist Model\" is discussed in chapter 4 and is said to represent the view of the Rambam. The Rambam understands <em>Pardes</em> as including \"Physics and Metaphysics\" and <em>Pardes</em> is included in the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910973/jewish/Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mitzvah of Talmud Torah (1:12)</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For Maimonies, however, these are not mystical or kabbalistic passages. Rather, they represent, respectively, physics and metaphysics. Natural sciences and philosophy are thus the contents of <em>Pardes</em> (page 80-81)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This novel approach is not without its difficulties.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, even though the topics the Rambam identifies with <em>Pardes</em> are included in the category of \"secular studies\" or \"maddah\" or \"chochmah\", not <em>all secular studies are Pardes</em>. Some of the most relevant secular studies are in fact excluded from the category of <em>Pardes</em> as prerequisites. We see for example, that Math is not included in <em>Pardes</em> and therefore not \"Talmud Torah\": \"first study Logic, next the various branches of Mathematics in their proper order\" (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp044.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Guide for the Perplexed 1:34, Friedlander</a>). Likewise the moral preparation for the study of <em>Pardes</em> would probably make any musser from self-help books included in the pre-requisites for learning <em>Pardes</em> (ibid).  All the more so does this notion fail when it comes topics which aren't even preparation for learning <em>Pardes</em>!</p>\n\n<p>As such all of these subjects must be done with the intent to enable one to preform the mitzvah of Talmud Torah (or other mitzvah) bringing us back to the notion of \"heksher mitzvah\".</p>\n\n<p>To further illustrate the difficulty of this idea that learning secular studies can be \"Talmud Torah\" is that the  in his commentary on the Mishnah in Shabbos (chapter 13) Rambam prohibits one to study secular wisdom on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>In this way we see the dichotomy with the Rambam's position in <em>Teshuvot HaRambam vol. 3 page 57</em> disappear because most \"chochmah\" is not and cannot be Talmud Torah even according to the Rambam. And those topics which he <em>did</em> understand as physics and metaphysics are no longer viable scientifically and it is not at all clear that the reasons which the Rambam understood them to constitute <em>Pardes</em> are transferable to contemporary physics etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mishnah in Avos (last Mishnah in perek gimmel) says (translation follows Tosfos Yom Tov):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R' Elazar Chisma said: [The laws of] bird offerings and openings of Niddahs are [among] the bodies of law; astronomy and geometry are appetizers for wisdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus we see that math, important as it might be, is not quite on par with actual halachah.</p>\n\n<p>However, this Mishnah is referring to math in and of itself. Certainly if you're learning math in order to learn Gemara it's considered a part of learning the Gemara. Take, for instance, the Sefer HaChinuch (Mitzvah 258, my own translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Amongst the laws of the Mitzvah [of not cheating anyone in business] ... And also there are many topics that are clarified in the books of Algebra and Geometry that split between right angles, obtuse angles, and acute angles, and between equilateral triangles, isosceles triangles, and scalene triangles, and between squares, rectangles, parallelograms, and rhombi. There are so many laws of math that even the largest parchment would not be enough to write down all of these laws... And therefore one must be careful when dividing up land.<br>\n  And remember with all of this the various measurements that Chazal brought down in the areas of mathematics, such as that which they said that for every amah on the side of a square there are 1.4 amos along the diagonal, or that any circle with three tefachim in its circumference has a diameter of one tefach, or that any square is a quarter bigger than a circle [of the same diameter], and other rules similar to these. They were not exact when they made these rules, and thus one should not rely on them when dividing things between people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One could bring a proof from this Sefer HaChinuch that one who learns these math principles in order to avoid cheating anyone when selling fields is considered to have fulfilled the Mitzvah; likewise, one who learns math in order to learn Gemara should be considered as if he learned Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>Another proof that secular studies can be used to perform mitzvos can be found in the Gemara in Shabbos (75a, still my own translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Says R' Shmuel bar Nachmani in the name of R' Yochanan: How do we know that it is a <strong>Mitzvah</strong> to calculate astronomy? As it says in the passuk (Devarim 4:6): \"And you should guard them and do them, for they are your wisdom and knowledge in the eyes of the nations.\" What wisdom and knowledge do you have that is in the eyes of the nations (that they, too, can understand - Rashi)? It must be that it's discussing astronomy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wait a second. Didn't we just say in the Mitzvah in Avos that astronomy is only an appetizer for wisdom?</p>\n\n<p>It must be, then, says the Tosfos Yom Tov, that the Mishnah is discussing learning astronomy for astronomy's sake, and the Gemara in Shabbos is discussing learning astronomy for Mitzvos' sake.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the Gemara proved astronomy is a Mitzvah because it's a wisdom/knowledge that the nations can understand. This is true of any secular study.</p>\n\n\n",

There may be exceptions, but this is the general practice.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/bkama/points/bk-ps-080.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A relevant Gemara at Bava Kama 80a/b</a> goes into the permissibility of owning animals (there is some back and forth permitting and forbidding, and there is an implication that it's dependent on whether they're useful for keeping pests away) as well as some back-and-forth discussion about whether one may own a cat (seemingly depending on if it's the type that may injure children). I however am not in a position to make a judgement about what the Gemara's final conclusion and implications are.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/976496/jewish/May-a-Jew-Raise-Swine.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article by Rabbi Yehuda Shurpin</a> (he brings original sources there) explicitly says that one may own non-Kosher animals as pets (he mentions a horse), but one may not make a business out of owning non-Kosher animals if they are normally consumed for food. However, in <strong>the case of swine, one may not own them at all</strong> (there are various instances in Tanach and the Talmud where swine are singled out in unfavorable ways, see the article for details of the ruling and sources). Also <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/bkama/points/bk-ps-079.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kama 79b</a> explicitly states one may not raise pigs anywhere.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Mishnah): We may not raise small animals (i.e. that do not work) in (settled parts of) Eretz Yisrael, but we may raise them in Surya or wildernesses of Eretz Yisrael. We may not raise chickens in Yerushalayim lest they cause Tum'ah to Kodshim. Kohanim (who eat Terumah) may not raise chickens anywhere in Eretz Yisrael; <strong>One may not raise pigs anywhere.</strong> One may raise dogs only if they are tied on a leash. We may not set traps for doves within four Mil of a settled area.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another exception is the case of an \"evil dog.\" <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/halacha/jachter_1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article by Rabbi Howard Jachter</a> goes into detail with sources defining what is an \"evil dog\" and the prohibitions and conditions surrounding owning one. In fact there are many varying opinions on whether one may own any dog at all, but it appears that the majority of modern poskim permit (outright or with reservation) owning dogs that don't bite or cause damage.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Shulchan Aruch and most authorities limit the talmudic prohibition to ownership of \"evil dogs\". The clear implication is that one may own a dog for any reason, provided it is not an evil dog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a side note, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/30119/1947\">as explained with sources in this other answer</a>, simply touching non-Kosher animals doesn't impart impurity. It has to be dead (and then there may be differences depending on the kind of animal, but that is another issue).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Jews may raise dogs and the Tanach allows them to raise swine, but not eat them or any by product. So yes, the Tanach never says that it is forbidden to raise swine as pets. So yes, Jews may touch swine but not use them to eat.</p>\n\n<p>A source from Yeshiva.com, Ask the Rabbi and reply from Rabbi Ro'i Margalit</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=611\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=611</a></p>\n\n\n",

See for example <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=110&format=pdf\">Menachos 110A</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=27b&format=pdf\">Taanis 27b</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Why is there no obligation for the convert to read/learn the Torah portion that talks about the Korban he must bring? Even if reading/learning that portion is only partially as effective as actually bringing the sacrifice (as the Beit Yosef (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14265&st=&pgnum=10\">Orach Chaim 1, d\"h <em>VeAchar Parshat</em></a>) says regarding a Sin Offering - see an examination of this <a href=\"http://www.neimushatorah.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Parshas-Tzav.pdf\">here</a>), it still seems to me that it is still better than nothing, at least until the actual sacrifice can be brought.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14366&st=&pgnum=370\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna Torah Isurei Biah 13:5</a> indicates that the Korban a convert brings is a Korban Olah. This is already included in the Korbanos that is said on a daily basis. Perhaps the Rambam felt there was no need for a special repetition when it is said as part of the Tefila. In addition although saying the Korbanos is as if one brought a Korban it is still not the same. (See story of Rabbi Yishmael in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14314&st=&pgnum=25\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meshectas Shabbos 12b</a> where he was Mechalel Shabbos in error and wrote down that he will bring a Korban when the Bais HaMikdash is rebuilt, indicating that saying the Korbanos is not on the same level as bringing it.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Potential non-muchrach answer:</p>\n\n<p>The ger was not Jewish and now he's changing his status. In order to do so he needs to perform actions to purify himself so to speak, to become a servant of God. As such, we require Tevilah, to purify his soul, Milah, to purify his body, and Korban to uproot his idolatrous nature and replace it with complete devotion to god. Hence the Burnt offering which is entirely burned and signifies complete devotion to god, and elevates the bringer. Hence the name Olah.</p>\n\n<p>In order to demonstrate this, reading the verse is not good enough, however. An action is required. Just like actions are required in Milah and Tevilah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'm changing my answer after discussing this with Rabbi Dr. Barry Fruendel.  Rabbi Fruendel, the Rav of Kesher Israel Congregation in Washington, D.C., is coordinating the standardization of conversion practices in the U.S. for the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) in cooperation with the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.  I posed the question to him exactly as presented.  He stated that the question places too much emphasis on the words \"as if\" when stating that \"when one learns about a sacrifice or reads the Torah portion that talks about a sacrifice, G-d considers it as if one has offered that sacrifice.\"  \"As if\" does not create a requirement and does not mean that learning about the sacrifice is a substitute for the sacrifice itself.  He said most poskim hold that the convert's obligations to bring the sacrifice are put off until the arrival of the Messiah, although \"a few\" poskim have the convert set aside a coin worth about 25 cents exclusively for the purpose of buying an offering after the Temple is reestablished.   </p>\n\n\n",

In fact, this is the easier aspect of holiness. But there is another aspect of holiness, one that's harder to attain and maintain, the aspect which involves human interaction: being generous, helpful, offering honest advice; paying employees on time; not lying, cheating or stealing; giving others the benefit of the doubt; no gossiping, taking revenge or bearing grudges.</p>\n<p>In other words, being an honest, decent human being, even when you have to deal with people are annoying, wearying, dishonest or disingenuous. However, for the holiness to kick in, you've got to follow these common-sense rules for getting along with others for the right reason. The right reason is not because it's the ethical way to behave or the ethical thing to do. The right reason is because God said so. They are mitzvot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Nachman (or what is based off of Rabbi Nachman) is not alone in his third requirement, to accept these easy \"common-sense rules for getting along with others for the right reason.\" Rambam also reflects this too in Laws of Kings and their Wars 8:11:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But if he [a Ben Noach] does them [fulfill the Noachide laws] because of an intellectual decision, then he is not a Ger Toshav [resident alien], and is not of the Chasidei Umos HaOlam [pious ones of the nations], he is [only] one of their wise men (of the nations of the world).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam here distinguishes between a pious one among the nations and a wiseman by how one comes about accepting the Noachide laws. If one comes about accepting them through compelling common-sense reason and logic, then he is only a wiseman as opposed to a pious man. This same line of reasoning is used in Rabbi Nachman's last requirement to achieve holiness.</p>\n<p>I hope this helps. If you want, just search for other dvar torahs on Parshah Kedoshim with a keyword, \"holiness,\" and you should get plenty of results.</p>\n\n\n",

Mechon Mamre’s JPS translation renders this as “the angel of the LORD”, but is the definite article implicit in this form of the word מלאך, or should it be translated as “<em>an</em> angel of the LORD”?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_constructus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Semitic languages, nouns are placed in the construct state when they are semantically definite and modified by another noun in a genitive construction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>… which is not the way I think of it, and I'm not sure it's a <em>good</em> way of thinking of it, but maybe. Anyway, let me explain:</p>\n\n<p>A noun phrase in Hebrew sometimes consists of a construct noun and another noun following. The construct noun is something like \"מַלְאַךְ\" and the noun following it can be \"ה׳\". In that case, the first, construct noun is definite, i.e. it means \"the [something] of\", here \"the messenger of\" or \"the angel of\". (There are <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar/130\" rel=\"nofollow\">exceptions</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Note, though, that the definiteness can mean various things. In particular, it need not mean that the messenger/angel under consideration is God's only messenger/angel. (This is like in English, where we say \"give him the green folder\": there's certainly more than one green folder, but only one under consideration at the moment.) In Genesis 22, the first \"מַלְאַךְ ה׳\" can't easily be read as referring to a specific messenger/angel mentioned earlier in the text, so the definiteness must be weaker, perhaps something like \"the specific messenger/angel that God sent this time\". Perhaps some of the commentators there discuss this, but that wasn't your question.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar/128\" rel=\"nofollow\">More information from Gesenius.</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Jouon-Muraoka's <em>A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew</em> (section 139) write:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A genetive group is determinate or indeterminate according to whether the <em>nomen rectus</em> is determinate or indeterminate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, the definite/indefinite quality of the construct state depends entirely on the following word (the one in absolute state). This is also how I learned it in a biblical Hebrew grammar class at Hebrew U.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>סוּס הַמֶּלֶךְ - <strong>the</strong> horse of <strong>the</strong> king</p>\n<p>סוּס מֶלֶךְ - <strong>a</strong> horse of <strong>a</strong> king -- <strong>a</strong> king's horse (where no particular horse is intended)</p>\n<p>For example, Isaiah 34:8 has \"שְׁנַת שָׁלוֹם\", where JPS translates \"a year of recompense\".</p>\n<p>There are several exceptions, see Jouon-Muraoka. For example, whether the second noun is semantically determined or not (even though it's grammatically determined) is sometimes complicated. For example: חלקת השדה (Sam 2:23:11) = \"a portion of the countryside\" = \"a field\" (השדה meaning the fields); עם נקודות הכסף (Song 1:11) = \"with dots of silver\" (הכסף meaning general silver); איש בנימין (Sam 1:4:12) = \"a man of Binyamin\". However, the general rule is for determination to follow the determination of the second word.</p>\n<p>In particular, since ה׳ is definite, מַלְאַךְ ה׳ would (normally) be \"the angel of Hashem\". However, Jouon-Muraoka count this case (Gen 22) as a probable exception (presumably from context), meaning \"an angel of Hashem\". They note that the Septuagint translates this as \"an angel of the Lord\". They also note that in Judges 6, although for the <em>narrator</em> מלאך ה׳ surely means \"the angel of Hashem\", \"for Gideon, who only later discovered the identity of his interlocutor, he must have been perceived as 'an angel of the Lord'\".</p>\n<p>Evidence for these kinds of exceptions are רוח אלהים רעה (Sam 1:16:16) and איש אלהים קדוש (Kings 2:4:9), where the undetermined adjective modifies the necessarily undetermined noun</p>\n<p>A Google search gives more sources (<a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/bibheb/files/Construct.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> and <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fe1iAAAAMAAJ&lpg=PA58&ots=lKAeZvtO6L&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>) that support the basic rule.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I can't account for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_constructus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia's account</a> of the construct being always semantically definite, but for <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar/128\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gesenius</a>, as quoted <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/30148/4940\">another answer</a>, I think many of the examples where I would say indefinite and Gesenius writes \"the\" are more a function of how we write things in English.  For example, he writes \"the terror of a king\", where I would understand that as meaning \"any terror of a king\", hence indefinite.</p>\n<p>See also his point 2(e), where he writes כְּסִיל אָדָם (a fool of a man), or in 2(a) (the second one -- on the page marking on the left, it's right before page 418), where we have אִישׁ דְּבָרִים (a man of words) and אִישׁ לָשׁוֹן (a slanderer).  There's also the very common example of תַּלְמִיד חָכָם (lit. a student of a wise man).</p>\n\n\n",

May Shimon drink without a bracha and rely on the bracha he had originally made for Reuvan in order to be motzei him in Kiddush (assuming he hasn't interrupted with speaking, etc.)?

Even if the person was thirsty from before the seudah (and didn't drink water then since it might hurt him (see there Shulchan Aruch and Mishnah Brurah Sif-Katan 31)) and drinks now in the middle of the seudah, still a bracha is not made. The reason he is drinking now is because of the pas (bread) and that exempts the bracha on the water.</p>\n\n<p>In general if a person would drink before the seudah and wouldn't be concerned for what it says in Shulchan Aruch, and was in fact thirsty but for whatever reason didn't drink, do they make a bracha then in the middle of the seudah (since they are drinking in order to quench their thirst)?</p>\n\n<p>What about in a situation where a person was in fact thirsty but was unable to drink (like Friday night before Kiddush.) In such a case they would have drunk and weren't worried about what it says in Shulchan Aruch. However they weren't able to drink yet since they didn't make kiddush. Does a bracha have to be made now on the water (or whatever drink it might be) that they are drinking in the middle of the seudah in order to quench their thirst (assuming they didn't drink any wine from the kiddush of course)?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there any precedent to read the first 11 chapters of Genesis as metaphorical?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I believe this will be related to a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/29997/1947\">similar question</a> about a statement by Rabbi Sacks. Rabbi Jeremy Wieder said in a lecture titled <em><a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/716561/Rabbi_Jeremy_Wieder/Non_Literal_Interpretation_of_Scripture_in_Jewish_Tradition\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Non Literal Interpretation of Scripture in Jewish Tradition</a></em> (and elsewhere as I understand it) that based on principles mentioned by the Rambam and Rav Saadia Gaon that, in simple terms, you generally understand the plain meaning of the text except when reason doesn't allow such a literal understanding, provided doing so doesn't violate core principals of Judaism. One example he gives is that while the verse speaks of God creating a rainbow, upon being shown that a rainbow is a natural property of optics and refraction, Rambam reinterpreted it to mean that God simply used a rainbow as a sign.</p>\n\n<p>However, he goes on to say that the whole of the first 11 chapters could be understood to be like a parable, not something that actually happened. (Perhaps for details like halachos based on this portion he would take a modified approach, not sure.) (Also he says it wouldn't be heresy to say the Avos never existed but he would personally be very uneasy about taking it that far. Basically he said the only thing that you <em>must</em> understand as literal was the revelation at Mt. Sinai.)</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, <strong>is there any precedent for that position on such a large scale?</strong> It's much more than understanding the nature of a rainbow. It seems to go against all of Chazal's commentaries and Jewish tradition from Mt. Sinai to say that the events didn't happen. To be sure, if correct, his approach would <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/28441/1947\">basically answer my other question</a> that asks for a reconciliation between science that seems to say human history goes well beyond 6,000 years ago and that it proceeded uninterrupted straight through the Mabul (as well as another detail I didn't ask about that the history of languages shows they developed with no dispersion at a tower 4,000 years ago). But the halachic basis for such a liberal approach seems questionable to me, hence the question.</p>\n\n<p><em>EDIT: I added a bounty to try to draw more eyes to the answers and get some other people's feedback on them or improved answers so I can get help choosing one for the accepted answer.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Briefly, such an interpretation is inconsistent with the text and trend of Rav Saadia Gaon's discussion of this topic in Emunos v'Deos. The entire context of his discussions on when one may interpret Scripture contrary to the plain meaning is one of restricting the practice.  Regarding allegorical interpretation Rav Saadia warns:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The result of the application of such a method of interpretation would be that there would not be an item left in the entire <em>story of the creation</em> [of the world] that would not have been divest of its literal meaning, which is the creation and origination of things. (Ibn Tibbon treatise 7:5, Rosenblatt, page 425).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam also has language limiting the non-literal interpretation of scripture (“a mere argument in favour of a certain theory is not sufficient reason for rejecting the literal meaning of a Biblical text.” (Guide for the Perplexed II:25, trans. Friedlander)).  While it might be argued that he is more open to exception he still does not provide any precedent for doing so beyond the creation account and his  reasoning for doing so, and his method of doing so would not apply (\"not interpreting literally\" is not the same as offering a coherent non-literal interpretations).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Rambam, and even the Kuzari, say that it is not forbidden to re-intepret the six days.  And if you consider the fact that the Moreh Nevuchim and the Kuzari are opposites on many other issues, and that they are two of the greatest works of Jewish thought, then it follows that one can understand the six days as non-literal without feeling like one is relying on an obscure view.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As mentioned in the question, its based on the principles of the Rambam and Rav Saadia Gaon. When there's (a) reason to understand the text non-literally you may do so. In the past, these rishonim (and others) applied this principle of interpretation to certain cases based on philosophical reasons, and nowadays it may apply to other areas for archeological reasons, but it follows the same basic principles. </p>\n\n<p>Also, one does not need to understand everything as a parable, just that the literal meaning of the pesukim may not be giving a detailed scientific account. For example, the beginning of Berishis says that the world was created by God, but the specific account can be understood symbolically in various ways. One can say something similar for the Flood story, but you can't keep on insisting everything's a metaphor, since revelation at Sinai <em>is</em> a fundamental belief.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>:<br>\nThe comments raise the issue of what is a fundamental belief and therefore must be interpreted literally and the question already mentioned R. Wieder's view on this. The Rambam enumerates 13 principle of belief that he holds cannot be re-interpreted, but that means <em>other things can be re-interpreted</em>. The Rambam followed this in practice in many instances, e.g. he reinterprets every single appearance of an angel in Tanach as a vision. The Rambam did not have a <em>mesorah</em> about angels, but he re-interpreted them based on his philosophical views. Similarly nowadays one can re-interpret things based on science. </p>\n\n<p>Commentators who did not have such philosophical or scientific issues may have interpreted these stories completely literally; there are many ways to interpret the Torah.  While one can interpret almost everything literally nowadays too, there's no reason to insist that it's an <em>ikkar</em> to do so. As chazal say, כל המוסיף גורע. </p>\n\n\n",

I'd just like an idea about what other issues might be relevant to ask about or think about. Obviously this question is practically relevant to me, but I'm only asking so I have a better idea about the topic. No doubt she will ask for the relevant information herself, and there are rabbis I can ask my own questions from. But do any of you have personal experience in this area? Or do you have any thoughts? I guess that some of the considerations will also be around holidays, like Pesach.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I go to college and lived with a gentile roommate last semester, and I wish I had someone as considerate; but, let's get started. Obviously make sure to be considerate on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_prohibited_on_Shabbat\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbat</a> by leaving the bathroom light on and avoiding any sort of problem that must be solved by breaking one of the Shabbat rules. For example, don't leave something of importance that she might need on Shabbat outside the house if there is no eruv, because for her to bring something from outside back in would violate the prohibition of <a href=\"http://www.ou.org/chagim/shabbat/thirtynine.htm#1b\" rel=\"noreferrer\">transferring in between domains</a>. Another foreseeable scenario is if you lock the front door on Shabbat when she might leave it unlocked during Shabbat so that she doesn't need to carry a key. I'm not very creative with these sorts of scenarios, so make sure to ask your Jewish friend if you ever have a concern. </p>\n\n<p>I'm assuming your friend is also <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/the-laws-of-yichud/05.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">shomer negiah and follows the rules of yichud</a> so avoid bringing in male friends or at least ask for the house to yourself if you really need a male buddy to come on over; and, make sure your male friend (if the situation ever comes about) knows not to hug/touch your Jewish friend. I'm not saying you have to obey yichud or be shomer negiah, but having male guests can create a problem for your female friend. It's very awkward watching my roommate cop a feel from his girlfriend when I'm davening only a few feet from him. This isn't as much of a problem if your friend has a husband or male relative living in the house as well, but better safe than sorry. </p>\n\n<p>As for pesach, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1742/jewish/What-is-Chametz.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">avoid bringing in any leavened breads into the home</a>, and if your friend abstains from <a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/Passover/Kitniyot/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">kitniyot</a>, then avoid bringing in those foods as well. <a href=\"http://www.betemunah.org/chametz.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chametz must be removed from the home before Pesach and cannot be introduced into the room until after the holiday is over.</a> As for kitniyot, there is no prohibition, as far as I understand it, of having it within the home; but, I don't know what your Jewish friend's preferences. It's better to ask or just play it safe.</p>\n\n<p>Cooking is also a very complicated question. I'm not sure if she <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9297/whats-the-halachic-advantage-of-double-or-triple-wrapping-food\">double-wraps</a> or if her home has separate ovens for meat and dairy, so ask her about cooking. Maybe she wants you to use your own kitchenware, maybe she wants you to use a specific sink to wash your kitchenware, maybe she wants you to use her kitchenware and be aware of which is for meat and which is for dairy. Either way, this is a very complicated question and all I can recommend is that you ask her about that. As for your question about your kitchenware un-koshering other kitchenware, I'll explain the problem (or lack thereof) and the solution. In halacha for kosher, at least for meat and dairy, taste is principle (Yoma 73b; Yoma 80a). You transfer the taste by washing and cooking the kitchenware to cook meat and dairy, <a href=\"http://www.adultyeshivala.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Introduction-to-Issur-Vheter.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">but this can be more technically explained here</a>. You can (according to law, not according to the rules of the household) use kosher kitchenware that the family uses as long as you do not <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-issues-bishul.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">prepare anything fit for a king's table</a> (or anything else not kosher, of course). The reasoning for this is that if you prepare food that is bishul akum, <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=1650\" rel=\"noreferrer\">then the utensils are now not kosher</a>. That's why there's an advantage to you having your own kitchenware, but then there's a load of questions with whether or not you're using her oven, if you're cleaning in her sink, et cetera. I don't feel comfortable enough in this area to discuss it in detail, so ask her or a rabbi for more information on this subject.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid playing music in the house during the <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/h/o/lac/48971726.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Counting of the Omer</a> and during certain holidays and periods of times (like the <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/1098\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Three Weeks and the 9 Days</a>). She might not even consider it a prohibition to listen to recorded music, but it's better to ask than assume. If you really need to listen to music, get a pair of headphones.</p>\n\n<p>Besides that, you should be okay. Maybe there are some female oriented concerns for Jewish life that I'm not looking at, but I'm not very well versed in any of that. Be considerate, be nice, have a good relationship with your friend and reach an understanding between the two of you. I wish you the best of luck.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I happened to have been reading the part of the Talmud (Tractate Pesachim) just yesterday where it discusses the issue of chametz (leaven) owned by a non-Jew who rents a residence (even a room) in the home of a Jew.</p>\n<p>There are three source mitzvot in the Torah that are of concern here (I'm eliding them): \"…yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses…\" (Exodus 12:15), \"Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses…\" (Exodus 12:19), and \"…and no leavened bread shall be seen with you…\" (Exodus 13:7). The penalty for transgressing these is getting \"cut off from the Congregation of Israel\". I've heard a Rabbi say that this is basically the only thing that can get you excommunicated from Judaism, so it's a very serious set of mitzvot.</p>\n<p>I'm working from the Steinsaltz English translation, PI 5B-6A (pgs ~23 - 28). The Talmud being the Talmud there's a lot of back and forth. The gist of it is that there is a strong prohibition against having leaven in your home, under your control, in your responsibility, or appearing to belong to you. So the discussion revolves around the edges of what does \"your home\" mean? What are the boundaries of taking ownership of or responsibility for (even if you don't own it, you're liable for it) a piece of property?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sages taught in a baraita: With regard to a gentile who enters the courtyard of a Jew with his dough in his hand, the Jew need not remove the leaven by evicting the gentile from his property. However, if the gentile deposited the leaven with him, and the Jew accepted responsibility, he must remove it. If he designated a room in his house for the gentile* to place his leavened food, he need not remove it… (h) (Steinsaltz Pesahim I, v6 p27)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are a couple of footnotes on this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(*) See Rashi and Tosafot, who disagree over the significance of this issue. The Rambam explains that according to Rashi, the assumption is that generally one who deposits an object with no stipulations expects the bailee to take responsibility for it. However if he designates a particular room for the deposit, that indicates that the bailee did not accept responsibility for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(h) …If the Jew designated a space for the gentile to leave his leaven, but the Jew did not take responsibility for it, the Jew is likewise not obligated to remove it. The halakha is in accordance with the opinions of Rashi, the Rif, and the Rambam, who maintain that the designation of a place exempts the Jew from the obligation to remove the leaven only if he did not acept responsibility for it… (footnote)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Ashi said: …If [the Jew] designated a room in his house for the gentile to place the leavened dough, he need not remove it, as it is stated: \"It shall not be found in your houses,\" and that house is not his; since when the gentile brings the dough into the house, he brings it into his own house, as the space was designated for his use. (Steinsaltz Pesahim I, v6 p27)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(They then rule that other related rulings regarding renting to a gentile who might bring in idols to a space s/he rents from a Jew do not apply here.)</p>\n<p>And finally a recommendation that in the case of a gentile who brings leaven into a rented room in a Jew's household, the leaven should be very clearly segregated and marked so it's not accidentally consumed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: If leavened bread belonging to a gentile is in a Jew's house, [the Jew] should erect a barrier ten handbreadths high around it on the fourteenth of Nisan, as a conspicuous marker, so that he will not mistakenly eat it. (Steinsaltz Pesahim I, v6 p28)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Taking responsibility\" would mean that if something happened, e.g. the house got broken into and the leaven was stolen, the Jew would be obligated to reimburse the gentile for the value of the leaven. I don't think this would be the understanding in a modern roommate situation (if your house gets broken into you wouldn't expect the landlord to make good on your losses and anyway that's not legally allowed perhaps except in a case of gross negligence i.e. the locks stop working and the landlord dallies in fixing them).</p>\n<p>Anyway, the net net is that of course all this depends on which particular thread of Judaism your roommate practices. The most courteous would be for you to refrain from bringing leaven into the house during Passover (so she doesn't accidentally eat it, or have others think she is eating leaven). However, it does seem like it would not put your roommate in violation of halakha if you were to bring leaven into your own personal bedroom and keep it there during Passover.</p>\n<p>Oh and by the way, you could help her out here — you can offer to buy all her leaven (for $1 or something) so it is not under her control or ownership during Pesach. Box it up, stick it in your room for the week, and perhaps you're willing to sell it back to her at the end of the week. It is a bit of a legal construct that she has to truly sell it to you for it to have been a true relinquishing of chametz, so technically you don't have to sell it back. Which might be great if she is a dedicated Scotch drinker like me. ;) But then it would probably really annoy her if you didn't.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>People have already said this above, but the complications with kashrus are already enough to know it’s a bad idea. Moreover, Passover would be a huge problem. Even though in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tractate Pesachim</a> we learned a baraisah that told us that as long as you don’t accept responsibility of chametz it can be in your house, but earlier Tosafos said that a Jew can be tempted to eat it. To me I see it like this: You can have it in your house (under certain conditions), but you really should stay away from it.</p>\n<p>The conclusion: I'm in no way a halachic authority, and you should talk to an Orthodox rabbi about this. Either way, I see this as a bad idea, and a lot of arguments.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does kidush bimkom s'uda need to be before the s'uda?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Anyone fulfilling his obligation of hearing <em>kidush</em> must eat a meal (or a nominal meal) at the same time and in the same place. There are details ‐ see <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Orach Chayim</em> 273 — but that's the general rule. My question is whether the meal must follow the <em>kidush</em> or whether, on the contrary, even a meal concluded with <em>kidush</em> is sufficient for the requirement of eating a meal with <em>kidush</em>.</p>\n\n<p>A hypothetical to which my question applies is that of someone who did not hear <em>kidush</em>, ate a meal (or a nominal meal), then realized his error (one may not eat before <em>kidush</em>) and made or heard <em>kidush</em> immediately on concluding his meal (before the meal's after-<em>b'racha</em>, or perhaps after). Would he then need to eat after <em>kidush</em> also?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=102&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pesachim 102a</a>) says that if a group was eating and finished after Shabbat started, they take one cup of wine and recite bentiching on it, and take a second and say Kiddush on it. Ran (20b in the Rif, s.v. Kos Rishon) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואע\"פ שאינו אוכל כלל לאחר קידוש היום כיון שגמרו שם סעודתם מקום סעודה מיקרי:‏<br>\n  Even though they are not consuming anything at all after Kiddush, since they finished their meal there, it is still called the place of the meal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rama, when quoting this in OC 271:6, notes a dissenting opinion who requires one to consume food after Kiddush in the above circumstance. This opinion, that of Rosh (Pesachim 10:7), does not allow the prior food to count because in this case it was a meal eaten on a weekday, not one eaten for the honor of Shabbat. Thus it is reasonable that even Rosh agrees that it is possible for a meal preceding Kiddush to establish the Kiddush as being in the place of a meal.</p>\n\n\n",

What about other congregations'? Do they use Orthodox-written scrolls, or do they have their own systems of <em>sofer</em> education, or can anyone decide to write a scroll, or do they not use scrolls at all, or what? I'm trying to get a general understanding of the writing of Torah scrolls for non-Orthodox congregations, divided up, as necessary, by 'denomination'.

Though there are ideological/halakhic reasons for this in some cases, the main reason is simple market share.  Most of the people who have dedicated their lives to writing Torah scrolls are Orthodox.  This is the same reason that most kosher meat is slaughtered by Orthodox shochtim and most tefillin is checked by Orthodox sofrim.</p>\n\n<p>There are several scribal present-day courses of study that produce scribes that some Orthodox Jews would feel uncomfortable with.  Notably, <a href=\"http://hasoferet.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jen Taylor Friedman</a> trains female scribes, and I believe JTS has a post-ordination program in safrut.

When the Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians, the 10 tribes that inhabited the kingdom were dispersed and lost from the Jewish world. They were exiled and they never came back. There was some hope that they'd come back after the ending of the <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Ancient_and_Medieval_History/2500_BCE-539_BCE/Jerusalem_Destruction_and_Restoration.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Babylonian</a> exile of the Kingdom of Judah, but they still did not come back. Centuries later, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1701071/jewish/Are-the-Ten-Lost-Tribes-Ever-Coming-Back.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Akiva made a statement on the status of the lost 10 tribes of Israel</a>:</p>\n\n<p>\"The ten tribes will not return, as the verse says (Deuteronomy 29:27), 'And the L‑rd uprooted them from upon their land, with fury, anger and great wrath, and He cast them to another land, as it is this day.' Just as a day passes and it will never return, so too, they will be exiled never to return.\"</p>\n\n<p>Further more, Rav Shimon ben Yehudah says:\n\"If their deeds are as this day’s, they will not return; otherwise they shall.\"</p>\n\n<p>Essentially it depends on whether or not they repent according to him. Now why do I mention this? Because it plays a key roll into your question. Let's consider the descendants of \"many Hispanics who moved from Spain and having their family line coming from Jewish blood\" as a lost people. Let's put them on the status of a lost tribe because they have not been involved in the Jewish community for years and have assimilated into their surrounding culture. Even if you can show DNA tests proving that they have Hebrew blood, it does not make them Jewish. There needs to be a clear distinction between being Hebrew and being Jewish. As <a href=\"http://megillatesther.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/esther-25-question-2-why-does-the-verse-call-mordechai-a-yehudi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Yochanan</a> in the Talmud puts it, when Esther refers to Mordechai as a Yehudi, it means he actually fought against idol worship. He wasn't Yehudi because his father or mother was a Hebrew, <a href=\"http://www.jewsofindia.org/PDFs/newsletters/Indian%20Jewish%20Congregation%20Newsletter%20Feb-2013.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">but because he stood up for his beliefs, and that's commonly how we use the word today to describe a Jew or Jewishness.</a></p>\n\n<p>So to conclude, it doesn't matter. Blood does not play a significant, major role on whether or not you're Jewish, especially if the last practicing Jew in your ancestry was many generations ago. They aren't Jews who don't know it, contrary to what many might say.</p>\n\n\n",

However in real life this doesn't seem to be the case. I personally have two examples of this off the top of my head:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>My grandmother, while walking home from Shul in a relatively safe area, was mugged. She only lost property.</li>\n<li>A couple years ago I was biking on campus, trying to rush to meet someone after class so we could go to Mincha on time and so he wouldn't have to wait. Normally a young guy like me biking on campus, even if hurrying, isn't considered something particularly dangerous. But when crossing grass, some other biker came up on the path ahead perpendicular, I tried to stop quickly to avoid hitting them, but I braked and I lost traction and fractured my hip. I was in plenty of pain, had setbacks in school, there were of course monetary costs involved, and while mostly healed I still am not completely back to normal.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So why do events such as these happen if the Gemara seems to promise protection? Are they not \"covered\"? Does the protection not apply?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I was at a Shiva where Rabbi Avigdor Miller Zatzal attended. The one sitting Shiva asked Rabbi Miller regarding the Nifteres - who was his wife. She was on the way to go do a Mitzva and was hit by a bus. How could this have happened? Do we not say that a Shliacha Mitzva does not get harmed. Rabbi Miller responded that in a place where it is (\"Shechiach Hezaika\") common to get damaged, this promise does not work.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Here are my thoughts: it would appear that there are 3 possible degrees of protection we can understand the Gemara to be promising: 1) Any and all damage occurring concurrently with the performance of a mitzva (eg. stock value falling while davening mincha), 2) Any and all damage occurring on the scene of performing a mitzva (eg. being hit by a car on the way to mincha), or 3) (and this is what I'm suggesting) Any and all damage that would occur solely due to unique circumstances created exclusively by performing the mitzva (eg. driving to another state to help complete a minyan for mincha). The first 2 are exceptionally broad and, I suspect, are constantly upended by reality. I'd argue that it is in fact the 3rd, narrow definition which is the correct application of the Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this is borne out by all the examples in Shas: a) sticking one's hand into a scorpion nest; b) creepily scoping a shared wall in the middle of the night by candlelight; c) anointing a new king during his rival's lifetime; d) trekking across a dark, deserted mountainous route; e) completely abandoning one's possessions for a week or more (Pesachim); f) illegally attaching/replacing a mysterious scroll to/on the gate of a city (Yoma); and g) scaling a tower (Kiddushin).</p>\n\n<p>None of these are things that would ever otherwise happen if not for someone attempting to perform a mitzva.

The question becomes, did Achashverosh indeed rule over the \"whole (old) world\"?</p>\n\n<p>Or were there any peoples, like maybe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Greeks</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Chinese</a> that escaped his rule? For example, in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Greco-Persian Wars</a>, Persia did invade Greece, although they weren't exactly successful. And in China, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Dynasty#Eastern_Zhou\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eastern Zhou Dynasty of the time</a> seemed to be isolated from the Persians. Did he rule over them? Are these locations not what the Gemara is talking about (just like it's not talking about the Americas)??</p>\n\n<p>It may also worth considering that the Gemara describes Achashverosh's reign as starting with 7 provinces, expanding to 20 (perhaps the 20 listed in the map below), and finally to 100 provinces (perhaps much more expanded but very temporarily?). However that theory seems to weaken later when the Gemrara says, \"Daryavesh established his reign over 120 provinces\" (in that he ruled over 7 less than Achashverosh).</p>\n\n<p>Map of Achaemenid Empire at fullest extent:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hsMmm.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Achaemenid Empire at fullest extent\"></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara you quoted says that Shlomo Hamelech also ruled the whole world, but he was not listed because he did not finish his reign.

It means his influence did. (Kind of like the American president being called \"leader of the free world\".)</p>\n<p>This is also apparent from the Gemara's description of Achav. He was not the actual king of those countries, he just had enough power to force them to listen to him.</p>\n<p>I also think that the Gemara only meant he had influence over the known world of the day, whatever that was.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eH9EH.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eH9EH.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The meddrash ( ester rabbi 1:5 ) says …….that Koresh ruled the whole world and achahverosh inherited it from him .\nBut then he lost half ,due to vashti convincing\nhim stopping binyan bais hamikdash</p>\n\n\n",

The argument grew very heated until a <em>bat kol</em> intervened and stated the famous line <em>elu v'elu divrei elohim chayim</em> (\"These and also those are the words of the living God\"). But then the <em>bat kol</em> concluded <em>v'hahalacha k'veit Hillel</em> (\"And the halacha is according to Beit Hillel\").</p>\n\n<p>The <em>bat kol</em> seems to settle the dispute; however, we learned in the story of the Oven of Akhnai (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=59b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 59b</a>) that we don't listen to a <em>bat kol</em> to settle halachic disputes because the Torah is <em>lo bashamayim hi</em> (\"The Torah is not in heaven\"). </p>\n\n<p>So why was the <em>bat kol</em> able to settle this dispute?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The Encyclopedia Talmudit entry on “Bas Qol”, the paragraph about its impact on halachah focuses on the apparent conflict between the conclusion one would get from the Tanur Akhnai story and from the one about following Beis Hillel. A summary of resolutions:</p>\n\n<p>1- <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rav_Nissim_Gaon_on_Berakhot.19b.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Nissim Gaon (Berachos 19b)</a>, opinion I: The bas qol said “halachah k’moso b’chol makom”. As a general rule, the halachah is like R’ Eliezer, but not here. The halachic conclusion does not contradict the bas qol, and it’s even possible that the bas qol caused them to reach their decision.</p>\n\n<p>2- Ibid, opinion II: The bas qol was only a test for the sages. Again, normally bas qol would indeed have halachic say.</p>\n\n<p>3- <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Eruvin.6b.15.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos (Eiruvin 6b) I</a>: The bas qol was only for the kavod of R’ Eliezer, who called down the opinion of Shamayim. bas qol does NOT have halachic authority.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me #3 is only possible (assuming that G-d doesn’t lie) by saying that R’ Eliezer and R’ Yehoshua were in an eilu va’eilu situation — both were right. Therefore, to show R’ Eliezer respect, G-d asserts that R Eliezer isn’t wrong even though the halachah is like R’ Yehoshua. In short, exactly the same point made by the Beis Hillel vs Beis Shammai story.</p>\n\n<p>4- Tosfos II: There is a difference between whether the bas qol runs counter to metahalachah (normal halachic process), or in accordance with it. Bas qol can confirm a ruling, but not run counter to normal halachic process.</p>\n\n<p>Metahalachically (i.e. in terms of the halakhos about how to make halakhah), we follow Beis Hillel because they are the majority. The bas qol only confirms that fact.</p>\n\n<p>(Why did it need confirmation? I would conjecture that this is because this is the first generation that the Sanhedrin was in exile from the Temple, and because Beis Shammai were generally considered the sharper group. Therefore there was a crisis in confidence in rejecting Beis Shammai’s opinion without the conclusion coming from the Chamber of Hewn Wood.)</p>\n\n<p>5- <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=7963&rid=82\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or Samei’ach (Yesodei HaTorah 9:4)</a>: There is a distinction between whether the bas qol is clarifying a particular halachah and whether it speaks of a person’s ruling. In the first case, bas qol is certainly not followed — metahalachah is the G-d-given means of creating new halachah. (cf <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Temurah.16a.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Temurah 16a</a>, where the prophet Yehoshua refuses to retrieve lost halachos via prophecy.) In the second, we do follow Beis Hillel, as per the bas qol. (Although R’ Yehoshua disagreed about this use of bas qol as well.)</p>\n\n<p>No. 5 appears to be nearly identical to #4, but with the added statement that given two true answers (speaking of one of two extant rulings), i.e. metahalachah allows one to follow either, a bas qol can be followed. His conclusion is that even had Beis Hillel and Beis Shammai been of equal number, the halakhah would still be like Beis Hillel.</p>\n\n<p>In short, Rav Nissim Gaon gives authority to bas qol to override halachic process, and the Achnai story’s bas qol is a special case for two different reasons. Tosafos and the Or Sameiach agree that bas qol has less authority than metahalachah, and possibly even no halachic say at all. And it is their opinion that one finds again and again in later sources.</p>\n\n<p>(In general, the geonim had an understanding of halachic truth and of machloqes that none of the rishonim continued with. This may be a consequence. See R' Moshe Halbtertal's \"<a href=\"http://rambam.merkaz.com/Class%204%20-%20Halbertal.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The History of Halakhah, Views from Within: Three Medieval Approaches to Tradition and Controversy</a>\")</p>\n\n<p>In either case it’s a question of whether one follows pre-existing rules for making halachic decisions despite supernatural evidence. It’s support for the notion of meta-halakhah, not for arbitrary leeway in making decisions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I heard an answer to this when I was learning Yevamos, which went as follows:</p>\n<p>The rule of lo bashamayim applies to deciding matters of halacha.  However, it does not apply to clarifying facts.  Thus the Gemara in Shabbos 108a (with Rashi):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בעא מיניה מר בריה דרבינא מרב נחמן בר יצחק מהו לכתוב תפילין על גבי עור של דג טהור א\"ל אם יבא אליהו ויאמר מאי אם יבא אליהו ויאמר אילימא אי דאית ליה עור אי דלית ליה עור הא חזינן דאית ליה עור ועוד התנן עצמות הדג ועורו מצילין באהל המת אלא אם יבא אליהו ויאמר אי פסקא זוהמא מיניה אי לא פסקא זוהמא מיניה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מאי אם יבא אליהו ויאמר - היתר ואיסור אין תלוי בו דלא בשמים היא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(My paraphrasing):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mar Son of Ravina: Can we write tefillin on fish skin?</p>\n<p>R' Nachman: When Eliyahu comes, he will tell us.</p>\n<p>Gemara (or perhaps Mar): What does it mean Eliyahu will tell us?</p>\n<p>Rashi: He can't tell us prohibitions or allowances! Lo Bashamayim!</p>\n<p>Gemara (or perhaps R' Nachman): He will tell us if its filthiness dissipates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So after just asking \"How can he tell us halacha!\" the gemara seems to answer how he will tell us the halacha.  The resolution is, as stated, that he cannot give a halachic decision, but he could clarify the facts that lead to a halachic decision.</p>\n<p>So, too, in the dispute between Beis Hillel and Beis Shammai, they knew that acharei rabim lehatos, and they understood that to mean to follow the weight of opinion, which is most likely to yield the correct answer.  But they were unsure if sharper minds would more likely yield correct answers, or a greater convention of minds, which would provide more variety of viewpoints and discussion.  Therefore, the Heavenly voice was, in actuality, only clarifying their doubt of a fact-based dispute, which automatically led to the conclusion that the halacha followed Beis Hillel.</p>\n<p>(There is an acharon who says all this, but I don't remember who it was)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=14&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tosafot</a> in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=14&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yevamot 14a</a> (d\"h R. Yehoshua) asks precisely this question. Tosafot answers we don't generally follow the ruling of R. Yehoshua that holds we don't listen to a bat kol. Tosafot goes on to explain that by the Oven of Achnoi everyone agreed not to listen to the bat kol since it was only for the honor of R. Elazar who stated \"From the heavens it shall be prooven I am right\". Tosafot also says that by the oven the bat kol was also against the majority and the halakha always follows the majority. However by Bait Shammai the bat kol said to follow the majority (however without the bat kol we would be unsure, since Bait shammai were sharper).</p>\n\n\n",

I will mention some, the rest see inside. He brings the Biur Halacha 125 seif 1 at the end of elah,he writes that if the chazzan starts after the congregation it could be that it would be considered saying kedusha b'yichidus.He brings the Pininim v Igros Zev who brings from the Griz M'brisk that was m'dayik from the Ramabam's loshon in seder tefillah that when things are said   together with the congregation \"he should say it with them.\" He adds that a minyan which is exactly 10 and the chazzan doesn't answer with them even for the congregation it is like they said it b'yichidus.</p>\n\n<p>On the other side,there are shittos who hold that the chazzan says it after the congregation. The bais Yehuda(shu\"t)chelek 2 siman 3 writes that it is ok for the chazzan to answer after since his intention is to be motzei the congregation just like the rest of chazaras hashatz which he says alone. See also the Igros Moshe OC 3:4 that he starts after the congragation.</p>\n\n<p>There are alot of sources so see it inside if your able to.  </p>\n\n\n",

I should point out though, that as an ashkenazi, I have not really utilized it for researching ashkenazi neginah (with which I'm already familiar) but rather sefardi neginah (with which I'm culturally unfamiliar), so I'm not in the position to objectively evaluate its accuracy and thoroughness. Still, it clearly is fantastic.</p>\n\n<p>2) For some reason, a lot of people I know don't figure this out on their own: Hebrew works in Google and Youtube. Seriously. No obscure third party plug-in is necessarily; just pull up google/youtube, hit alt-shift, and prepare for all your Jewish needs to be met. In our instance, this is what you'd get on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%AA+%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9C\">youtube</a>; the <a href=\"http://www.piyut.org.il/textual/193.html\">piyut.org.il page</a> is the third result in the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%AA+%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9C\">google search results</a>. If you don't know Hebrew yet, this might a good reason to learn it!</p>\n\n<p>3) Spotify has recently made its entire catalog accessible inside the browser, no longer necessitating that anyone download their software. At the price of listening to a few short commercials every now and then, you can enjoy all their music for free. If you have an account, you'd find <a href=\"https://play.spotify.com/search/chayil\">70 relevant tracks using their search</a>.</p>\n\n<p>4) 2 other possibly valuable resources when researching Jewish music are <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%93_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99\">Wikisource</a> and <a href=\"http://shironet.mako.co.il/\">Shironet</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now to go compose a zemer thanking God for the internet...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>For yekkishe (German etc.) nigunim of prayers, go to <a href=\"http://www.kayj.net/en/nusach\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kayj.net/en/nusach</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://offtonic.com/nusach/nusach.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Offtonic</a> happens to have a whole lot of them.

Not always - there are plenty of other quills that are acceptable (and reeds, plastic, and most say metal, among other options).</p>\n\n<p>There are those who think that a Torah must be written with a feather from a kosher (species of?) bird (according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ktav_Stam#Kulmus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> and more reliably, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8308&st=&pgnum=18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Keset ha-Sofer (Tinyana) 3:6</a> (<a href=\"http://www.hasoferet.com/ritual/keset/chapter3.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">English</a>)).  There are those who <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/22315/kashrus-status-of-turkeys\">dispute the kashrut status of turkey</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Are there those who overlap in both of these sets such that they would dispute the kashrut of a Torah written with a turkey feather?  If so, how is that handled practically?  I assume if you buy a new Torah, you can commission the sofer to not use turkey feathers, but how does someone in this set ensure that his pre-existing Torah is kosher according to that set of opinions?</p>\n\n<p>(This is not l'maaseh)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Divrei Chaim (Sanz) writes very emphatically about using only a feather from a Kosher bird, though this is an almost-universal practice even among contemporary sefardim (relatively few of whom still use reeds). However the halacha of \"min hamuttar l'picha\" only applies to the ink and parchment (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 32:5-8) so even those who dispute the kashrus of Turkey are within the realm of halacha using a Torah written with a Turkey quill. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, being within the realm of halacha never stopped anyone from pursuing hiddurim and I'm sure someone, somewhere, may have ordered a scroll specially for that reason but as far as I know (having studied and practiced safrus under a very experienced mentor) it is not the accepted practice of any community.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In the original קסת הסופר written by the author of the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch - Rav Shlomo Ganzfreid - there is no mention of not using a quill from a non-Kosher animal.</p>\n\n<p>All he says (in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49253&st=&pgnum=13\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ch 2:16</a>) is: <strong>Some say that it's better to use a reed than a feather - but this is not the custom.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer in his notes (ibid at the bottom of the page) says that <strong>feathers qualify - and may be preferable - as they are permitted to be eaten - i.e. kosher.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It seems that he took it for granted that one wouldn't use a feather from a non-Kosher bird.</p>\n\n<p>They do not discuss what would be the Din if you wrote a Sefer Torah with a feather from a non-Kosher bird.</p>\n\n\n",

Wouldn't he find it annoying if one of his servants praised him daily, three times a day: for one hour in the morning, 30 minutes in the afternoon and another 30 minutes in the evening. Wouldn't the king prefer for his servants to continue carrying out his commandments to continue the success of the country?</p>\n\n<p>We do exactly that: Shacharit, Minhah and Arvit. Also halalchically speaking--aside from reading the Shema twice a day--is it a commandment derabanim to pray shemonah esray and the rest? A source would be appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The image of a king is not the only one that is used for Hashem. He is also called a father, a husband, etc.; it is really a relationship, not just a job. It may be different from relating to a human being, because we rely on Him in a different way, we have a different kind of way in which to bless Him, and our 'conversation' with Him isn't verbal in the sense that you can hear an answer from Him in a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Even so, it's the devotion of the heart and the devotion of our actions together that are considered loving Him.</p>\n\n<p>That makes sense of private and spontaneous prayer, but how about praying as an obligation from a liturgy? One thought is that there is also something important in the prayers of the community as a whole, something that is bigger than you but which you are a part of. That is a way of blessing people that He has given in the community, and it's also something that He has given you to bless Him with, according to a clear understanding within Judaism... which is a big thought in itself.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>1) Ultimately we pray because the king commanded us in this specific service.</p>\n\n<p>2) To say that Hashem would find something annoying is ascribing human emotion and limitation to Him. The Torah can describe Hashem in those terms; we cannot.</p>\n\n<p>3) \"Much better for the king\" -- Hashem is not lacking in any way, and thus does not need our tefillos or our mitzvos; He has commanded us to pray for our own benefit entirely.  See Sefer HaChinuch 433 for some ideas on the topic.</p>\n\n<p>4) \"I don't see a reason to pray\" -- and in true Western spirit I am the ultimate arbiter of what is right and wrong.</p>\n\n<p>5) \"we could spend the extra time\" -- Time that has been given to you by Hashem to pray can hardly be considered \"extra\".</p>\n\n<p>5) \"Instead of praying we could spend the extra time doing things like Kivod Av Veam and Vehovta Lericha Kimocha.\" -- This statement seems to imply that the mitzvos which are bein adam l'chaveiro are somehow more important than the mitzvos which are ben adam lamakom. Hashem commanded us in all these mitzvos, and they are therefore all equally valuable to us. (I agree that He also gave us rules of preference -- e.g. if it is a choice between desecrating Shabbos and speaking loshon hora, we should speak loshon hora -- but we cannot conclude that loshon hora is somehow less important than Shabbos and we can therefore treat it lightly.)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>\"Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you; but I will teach you the good and the right way.\" 1 Sam 12:23</p>\n\n<p>As Samuel considered it a sin to cease praying for the Children of Israel, should we likewise consider it a privilege to pray to G-d for each other?  We should not cease to pray.  Prayer should not be only 3 times a day, but instead a lifestyle where we constantly talk to Abba.  When my daughter was 3 she talked constantly and it was both fun and annoying to listen to her.  I don't think Abba is ever annoyed with us... maybe amused but not annoyed.  He wants to hear from us.  Prayer is a conversation... talking is great, but to have a relationship requires us to be quiet sometimes and wait for Him to speak.  Without quiet time there is no prayer... just a bunch of one way talking.  Prayer shows we NEED Him in our lives and that we believe in Him.  And by listening (and obeying) we show Him our respect.  If you are merely reciting a bunch of canned speeches... it's not prayer, it's tradition.  Tradition has its place to maintain the continuity of the faith to provide a benchmark and an example for others to follow.  It's like feeding Vegimite to your children.  It's good for them, but when they are older they need steak.  We continue what tradition calls prayer for the sake of the community and for others to learn from and follow (because if you truly listen to those canned speeches there's a lot of heart in them), but true prayer is continually talking to G-d and taking those quiet times to hear from Him.</p>\n\n\n",

The ruling given was that he'd had a circumcision done \"for the sake of Judaism\" (unlike someone born without a foreskin, for instance), and that sufficed for conversion purposes as well.

Elijah is supposed to come resolve unanswered questions (a common phrase in monetary law when in doubt is, \"Leave it until Elijah comes\" - see Bava Metzia 1:8, and many other places). When the Gemara cannot answer a doubt, it ends the discussion with תיקו, literally \"let it stand\" but often explained as an acronym for תשבי יתרץ קושיות ובעיות, \"the Tishbi will answer difficulties and questions,\" (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2590&pgnum=270\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2590&pgnum=270</a>). Therefore the fifth cup is referred to as \"Elijah's Cup,\" not because Elijah will drink it, but because he will tell us whether to drink it. (the Maharal says to drink the fifth cup; the Chabad minhag is to pour the cup back into the bottle and specifically use it for kiddush the next morning)</p>\n\n<p>There is another aspect of the seder which appears connected to Elijah: immediately after birkat hamazon, the door is opened, and the verse שפוך חמתך על הגוים (\"Pour Your wrath upon the nations,\" Psalms 69:6) is said aloud. I have always heard this referred to as \"opening the door for Elijah,\" however the Hagadah of the Baal HaTanya does not refer to it in that way, and the straightforward explanation is that we are showing we are not afraid of gentiles on the night of Pesach, which is called ליל שמורים (\"Guarded night\", see Rema OC 481:2).</p>\n\n\n",

I think one has to be smart as to what he can handle and decide whether he is able to teach women or not. it's not for everyone.

Perhaps this question could be phrased a different way: Assuming that the market for male-specific shaving products that are designed for body hair is an indication that it is currently normal for (non-Jewish) men to shave their body hair, would this in turn permit a Jew to shave his body hair since it has become a norm?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch in the beginning of YD 182 says: </p>\n\n<p>א.המעביר שער בית השחי ובית הערוה אפילו במספרים כעין תער היו מכין אותו מכת מרדות בד\"א במקום שאין מעבירין אותו אלא נשים כדי שלא יתקן עצמו תיקון נשים אבל במקום שמעבירין אותו גם האנשים אם העביר אין מכין אותו: {הגה: ואפילו לכתחילה שרי (ר\"ן פ\"ב דעבודת כוכבים) רק החברים נמנעים בכ\"מ (שם ובב\"י בשם נ\"י) </p>\n\n<p>My rough translation:\nOne who shaves his armpits or pubic area, even using scissors in a similar manner to a razor (i.e. Cutting the hair short); they would lash him \"rabbinic lashes\".

I suppose I could identify poskim, but I will not. Hopefully, I have waited until the bounty on this question has expired.</p>\n\n<p>I would assume (correctly) the many, many Ashkenazic poskim who indeed maintain that a redid is not required. I believe that the redid is an Arabic clothing, and reflects Rambam's specific (culturally based) interpretation of the gemara which speaks of a kalta (a sort of basket-hat, according to Rashi) as an insufficient level of head covering. Maybe they are holding like the Shiltei Giborim who permits wigs as a sufficient level of covering to the reshut harabim.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe they are holding like the Rambam, in the following diyuk. He says, in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/4124n.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ishus 24</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאֵיזוֹ הִיא דָּת יְהוּדִית, הוּא מִנְהַג הַצְּנִיעוּת שֶׁנָּהֲגוּ בְּנוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל; וְאֵלּוּ הֶן הַדְּבָרִים שְׁאִם עָשָׂת אֶחָד מֵהֶן, עָבְרָה עַל דָּת יְהוּדִית:  יוֹצְאָה לַשּׁוּק אוֹ לְמָבוֹי מְפֻלָּשׁ, וְרֹאשָׁהּ פָּרוּעַ וְאֵין עָלֶיהָ רָדִיד כִּשְׁאָר הַנָּשִׁים, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁשְּׂעָרָהּ מְכֻסֶּה בְּמִטְפַּחַת; אוֹ שֶׁהָיְתָה טוֹוָה בַּשּׁוּק, וּוֶרֶד וְכַיּוֹצֶא בּוֹ כְּנֶגֶד פָּנֶיהָ עַל פַּדַּחְתָּהּ אוֹ עַל לְחָיֶיהָ, כְּדֶרֶךְ שֶׁעוֹשׂוֹת הַגּוֹיוֹת הַפְּרוּצוֹת; אוֹ שֶׁטּוֹוָה בַּשּׁוּק, וּמַרְאָה זְרוֹעוֹתֶיהָ לִבְנֵי אָדָם; אוֹ שֶׁהָיְתָה מְשַׂחֶקֶת עִם הַבַּחוּרִים; אוֹ שֶׁהָיְתָה תּוֹבַעַת הַתַּשְׁמִישׁ מִבַּעְלָהּ בְּקוֹל רָם, עַד שֶׁשְּׁכֵנוֹתֶיהָ שׁוֹמְעוֹת אוֹתָהּ מְדַבֶּרֶת עַל עִסְקֵי תַּשְׁמִישׁ; אוֹ שֶׁהָיְתָה מְקַלֶּלֶת אֲבִי בַּעְלָהּ בִּפְנֵי בַּעְלָהּ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note he says מִנְהַג הַצְּנִיעוּת שֶׁנָּהֲגוּ בְּנוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל, so we can <strong>perhaps</strong> make a diyuk that some group of women cannot suddenly redefine it in their generation and are thus free to do whatever they want. But once it has been redefined (through the fluid development of minhag) as a thing women do in order to be tznius in public, then people in the present can look to the practice of women in the past. (I don't know that we should make the diyuk at all. Must we cast all instances of מקום שנהגו as specifically past rather than present tense.)</p>\n\n<p>Note we can make another diyuk, that Rambam also says וְאֵין עָלֶיהָ רָדִיד כִּשְׁאָר הַנָּשִׁים, and there is not on it a redid <strong>like the other women</strong>, meaning that he is operating in a framework where other women are wearing redids, that not having it is a violation.</p>\n\n\n",

Its usage in the context of repentance is drawn from here, such as \"lest the people have a change of heart\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.13.17?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 13:17</a>); and for disposition and thoughts, such as: \"...(Your brother Eisav) is consoling himself by planning to kill you.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.42?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&lookup=our%20bro&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 27:42</a>); and so on. And wherever this change of thought or disposition comes from G-d, who regrets the action that He has done, it is the complete cancellation of the action - just as the existence of everything depends on God's desire and will, when He has a regret about it, it is as if it did not exist; such as prior to flood He says: \"for I regret that I made them (people).\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.6.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 6:7</a>).

The verse Shmuel A <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.15.29?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">15:29</a> explains the theology of the idea why it is that once G-d issues a decree in a form of regret, there is no remedy to fix it.</p>\n<p>That's precisely how Malbim comments on this idea inside his peirush. For the verse Shmuel A <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.15.11?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">15:11</a> :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>נחמתי</strong> כ\"מ שבא התנחמות אצל ה' שמתנחם על פעולה שעשה, הוא ביטול הפעולה לגמרי, כי קיום כל דבר תלוי בחפץ ה' ורצונו, וכשמתנחם על הדבר הרי הוא כאילו לא היה כמ\"ש כי נחמתי כי עשיתים, וזה יבא בגזר דין שאינו מקוה עוד על התשובה, ובאר הטעם כי <strong>שב מאחרי</strong>,  הוא מה שחטא במחשבה שהיה מיעוט אמונה בדברי ה' על ידי נביאו, שחטא הכפירה גרוע מחטא הבא על ידי תאוה או תכונה נפשיית, וגם בפועל <strong>ואת דברי לא הקים כו'</strong>:</p>\n<p>In every place that regret comes from Hashem, who regrets His action, that is a complete nullification of the action. Since existence of everything depends on Hashem's desire and will, once He has a regret about  it - it is as if did not exist. For example, in the case of Flood: \"for I regret that I made them (people).\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.6.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 6:7</a>). This will come with a verdict that (Shaul) no longer can hope for repentance (and forgiveness). He explains the reason why <strong>Shaul turned back from Hashem</strong> is that he sinned with thought, which is a lack of faith in the words of G-d given through His prophet, for the sin of rejecting G-d's words is worse than a sin that comes through lust or a mental disposition, and also in practice, and <strong>he did not fulfill my words</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the verse Shmuel A <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.15.29?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">15:29</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וגם נצח</strong>,  אומר אל תדמה כי היעוד האלהי דומה כיעוד בני אדם, שלפעמים הוא שקר תיכף שמגזם בפיו להרע ובלבבו לא כן ידמה, ופעמים הגם שחושב כן לעשות יתנחם אחר כך ולא יעשה כי ה' הנצחי שמתנאי נצחיותו שלא ימצא בו שום שינוי לא בהוה ולא בעתיד, <strong>נצח ישראל לא ישקר</strong>,  באופן שתחשב כי הרע שגזר עליך וקרע מלכותך היום הוא רק גוזמא לא אמת, וכן <strong>ולא ינחם</strong> בעתיד על הטוב שיעד לדוד, כי כל זה מורה שינוי, אם בין במחשבתו לדבורו, אם בין הזמן העתה והעתיד שלא יצוייר אצל הנצחי הבלתי משתנה, ועל זה אמר <strong>כי לא אדם הוא להנחם</strong>,  שההתנחמות לא תצוייר רק אצל האדם המשתנה לא אצל השם יתברך:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Moreover the Glory (of Israel).</strong> Do not compare the G-d's destiny with those of humans, who sometimes lie, exaggerate with their words, have evil in their hearts, do not perseive so, if they plan to do something, they may change their mind and do not do it. However Hashem, <strong>the Glory of Israel does not lie</strong>, He is eternal and regarding Him <strong>one cannot find any change</strong> neither in the present nor in future, He will not lie. Thus, you (Shaul) should not think that Hashem made a bad decree for you to tear the kingship away from you today is only an exaggeration and not truth. Similarly, G-d will not regret in the future regarding the good that He decreed upon David. For otherwise it teaches a change, between His thinking or saying, present and future - it is only formed before His Glory without any change. And regarding it the verse says <strong>for [God] is not human to have a change of heart.</strong> for changing of one's heart is possible for men, but not for G-d Blessed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>\"Hashem is not a man, that he should repent.\"  Should G-d repent?  Is He a man?</p>\n\n<p>If Hashem is not able to repent then why do we pray for mercy, why pray at all?  If He is not able to repent then is He able to forgive or to have mercy or can He accept our repentance?</p>\n\n<p>Jer 18:4-6   And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make [it].

The L-rd is able to repent, but he is not obliged to us to repent.  We are His workmanship and can not demand that He repent to us as we may demand to a man to repent.  There are times where He has repented (to be sorry, be moved to pity, have compassion, suffer grief, repent) and times where He has not.</p>\n\n<p>Consider these verses as well:</p>\n\n<p>Gen 6:6 And it <strong>repented the LORD</strong> that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. </p>\n\n<p>Exd 32:14 And the <strong>LORD repented</strong> of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. </p>\n\n<p>2Sa 24:16 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, <strong>the LORD repented</strong> him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand.

While that is obviously not the case anymore, we do wear a <em>talis katan</em> (small talis) to keep the mitzva of tzitzis with us the whole day. (It is a <em>shmira</em> - reminder or spiritual protection against forbidden relations.)</p>\n\n<p>However, it is highly questionable if a regular talis katan<sup>1</sup> fulfils the Torah's requirement of a real garment - one that can cover the body properly -  and it therefore became practice to wrap (<em>ituf</em>) one-self in a proper talis (called <em>talis gadol</em> - large talis) once a day. The time chosen for this was set to be that of shacharis, which is the most elaborate and foundational prayer of the day.</p>\n\n<p>Our days' talis therefore has a special elevated status, being both the full-scale performance of a Torah mitzva, and also a garment set aside for the holiest time, i.e. prayer. (That is why we do not wear it for Tisha B'Av shacharis - as a sign of mourning.) The talis is used as a sign of higher status: To carry a Sefer Torah. By the one leading mincha. Yom Kippur by night, and the whole day too. To enhance this mitzva, many decorate their taleisim elaborately with silver plates or woven bands. </p>\n\n<p>When wearing a talis, it is customary to hold on to the talis even beyond shacharis: On Yom Tov, mincha is sometimes prayed right after shacharis (before the meal) in which case many keep the talis on for mincha too. Some keep it on until after Shabbos day kiddush. If shacharis is followed by a bris mila, many will keep their tallis on for this too.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, some may find that their concentration is enhanced by using the talis to shield off the world during prayer.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1.

It would seem that if not for that concern, one would take off their yarmulke when wearing a tallis, and there is no need for a double head covering.  There are poskim who require atifas harosh (surrounding the head, not just having something on top of it) for Shemoneh Esrei, and particularly for Kedusha, because it is a davar sheb'kedusha (this is also accomplished by a hat of any color).  However, the Bach cited by Mishna Berura brings that one should wear the tallis for the whole davening, which would require a reasoning beyond that which applies to shemoneh esrei.</p>\n\n\n",

Drawing from Jewish law\n  sources, he pointed out to the man that one reason that we cover the\n  challot is to shield the challot from the “embarrassment” of not\n  receiving the first brocha of the meal. Accordingly, asked the Chafetz\n  Chaim, how could Kiddush be recited when the man's own wife had been\n  embarrassed?

(And what's the downside, really?)</p>\n\n<p>As for what text you yourself use, as long as you're not too loud, generally people aren't bothered by what words you're whispering. (It gets trickier with regards to the parts recited out-loud by the congregation, e.g. <em>kadosh kadosh</em> and the like; with Rabbi Feinstein of the opinion that you should follow the congregation's text for the entire <em>kedusha</em>.) If you want to use their text instead that's generally your option too. Rabbi Feinstein davened <em>nusach ashkenaz</em> but, as a boy, there was a point when his father took him to the local Hassidic synagogue, and instructed him to follow their text completely, with the exception of reciting the Mishnaic <em>BaMeh Madlikin</em> rather than the Kabbalistic <em>KeGavna</em> on Friday nights. (This is clearly a later addition, not even a prayer per se.)</p>\n\n<p>The <em>hazan</em>'s job description is <em>shliach tzibur</em>, he is the proxy of the congregation. As such he is expected to abide by their customs and standards. Now in your average American OU synagogue today it's not uncommon that several forms of Hebrew pronunciation are all acceptable. However if you were to go to say, a German or Yemenite synagogue that has very clear, homogeneous standards of pronunciation, then to not use those would be disruptive. Leaving pronunciation aside, if you are <em>hazan</em> and your personal text differs from the community's, obviously you'd use the community's for the out-loud repetition of the <em>amida.</em> Rabbi Feinstein's opinion is that you should even use their text for your own personal, silent <em>amida</em> if you are <em>hazan</em>, as the enactment was that the <em>hazan</em> should use this time to prepare for his out-loud recitation. On this last point I'm told that Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef shlit\"a differs, allowing the hazan to use his personal text for the silent amida.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Feinstein discusses the debate regarding <em>Selichot</em> prayers which seem to be addressing angels, rather than G-d; he writes that the Chasam Sofer (OC166) would skip the quietly-recited <em>machnisei rachamim</em> prayer, as this disrupted no one; but would recite the out-loud ones with the rest of congregation. (Even when not the chazzan.)</p>\n\n\n",

If so, that\n contradicts the Rambam; if not, how does it effect the creation of\n light?</p>\n\n<p>I'm not asking that physical effects imply a physical\n being. I'm asking how, assuming He has no physical being, He effects\n things. Not that He can't: yes, that'd limit Him. But how does He?\n Familiar physical events require a physical thing to effect them: by\n what medium does a non-physical God effect physical things?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are some ideas in Kabbalah that can answer your question. Generally, G-d expresses His immaterial nature through a series of filters (the spheres on the <a href=\"http://www.astradome.com/tree_of_life.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tree of Life diagram</a>) which allows His influence to work through physical objects. </p>\n\n<p>To be more specific, G-d's nature as <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0006_0_05655.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ein Sof</a> is such that it is too pure to be directly expressed in physical form, and He chose to use a series of vessels (<a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sefirot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the sephirot</a>) to filter Himself so that Creation could occur. It was through G-d's action and using G-d's filtered <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0006_0_05915.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">emanations</a> as building material that <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Shekhinah.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the physical world</a> was Created, and through His continued action that it continues to exist.</p>\n\n<p>So the question, \"If He has no corporeality at all, then how does He effect a physical event\" is flawed, to some degree. Corporeality exists and is sustained by Him; G-d can act in the physical world because it comes from Him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The physical universe would not exist if it weren't for its Creator. I think that everything physical is also bound in time; time also comes from a starting point, a 'will' (you could say) that started the chain of cause and effect.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is that He didn't just create things. He also creates, constantly, the stage of time itself and He upholds the existence, and all the physical properties, of created things (both tangible and intangible to us). Judaism believes that He has given us an element of genuine choice, responsibility, and agency that is an inexplicable miracle just like creation itself. Still, not a moment goes by that isn't held by Him in existence. Not a thing exists that exists of its own right.</p>\n\n<p>If He creates everything, even while not being Himself a 'thing' in that universe, then how can there even be a question about how He affects it?</p>\n\n<p>When the Bible speaks of our Creator, of course it uses descriptions that are meaningful to us in creation, but in no way does it assume that Hashem is the same as anything created. He made it. He made the mouth to be able to speak. So when it says that He said 'let there be light', that doesn't mean that He used a mouth or even sounds that are carried in substance and time... all of which He made :) I think it is just pointing to the concept of His intention, His choice, which is the best we can do of understanding His creating of the world.</p>\n\n<p>Doesn't this make Him seem distant? Far from it. He isn't limited to anything small; Judaism believes that He cares for us, knows us, communicates with us, and blesses us in many details of life. Every breath, every bit of food or water, every friendship we have, everything we learn, is in His hands. And how about the things that happen and seem horrible? That's another question, about the kindness of His wisdom. It doesn't mean He isn't near to those who seek Him. Think about it... everything we <em>are</em> is derived from His creating, we are nothing without this, but in existing and in being blessed... we are more intimately near to our Source than we are to anything nearby us in the world.

There should be no kasha on how that which is more real than physicality can affect the physicality (at least not from the direction you are coming from, a better question might be how can something so unreal come from Him who IS real?).

R’ Yisroel Meir protested and said that the\n  rabbi of whom he speaks is not so special. Enraged by the\n  disrespect shown by his fellow traveler, whose identity he\n  did not know, the traveler smacked the Chofetz Chaim.</p>\n  \n  <p>Later, the Chofetz Chaim set the man’s mind at ease. “I\n  deserved to be beaten,” he said, “because, as I have learned,\n  one may not speak lashon hara - even about oneself!”</p>\n  \n  <p>Notwithstanding this story, one may wonder as to why this\n  should be the case. Seemingly, one’s feelings are his own.\n  Just as one is permitted - although not encouraged - to\n  embarrass oneself if he so desires, presumably he should\n  reserve the right to speak of his own shortcomings as well.</p>\n  \n  <p>Indeed, R’ Yosef Sholom Elyashiv ZT”L is cited as\n  remarking that no prohibition exists whatsoever against\n  verbal self-denigration. One may, in fact, speak lashon hara\n  about oneself. R’ Elyashiv commented that to the contrary,\n  the above story proves this position, for we see that even the\n  Chofetz Chayim permitted himself to speak about himself.\n  He would not have done so if it was strictly forbidden by\n  halacha. Only in an attempt to alleviate his assailant’s\n  humiliation did he make the comment that he was wrong for\n  talking about himself. In truth, however, it is permissible.</p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, R’ Elyashiv insisted that this does not grant\n  other people permission to speak about him. This is\n  compared to a situation where one lets another steal his\n  possessions. Undoubtedly, though, the thief who comes\n  along and seizes his property has violated the prohibition\n  against stealing.

    "content": "# If the label says OU-D, but the warning label for allergy sufferers says \"no dairy\", do we consider the product dairy or not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I attended a fantastic lecture on kashrus and dairy products by Rabbi Zushe Yosef Blech, shlita, who was asked an interesting question: Can you eat Oreo cookies after a fleishig meal? It was pointed out that although the kashrus symbol indicates that the product is kosher but dairy, another part of the label that must list whether there are any ingredients for which many people suffer dangerous allergies (e.g. nuts or milk), as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act, does not list dairy items at all. Rabbi Blech made the amusing comment that \"Not only can you eat Oreos after a fleishig meal, it is a mitzvah to do so.\"  He explained that the manufacturer is more concerned about getting sued by consumers who have unwittingly eaten an allergen than the rabbis certifying their product.  He says that the OU these days puts a \"d\" on any product where the line has been used for dairy products (and not kashered).  Is this an opinion by most poskim, or is Rabbi Blech out on a limb?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Rabbi Bleich is very well-respected in the kashrus industry, and he has a tremendous amount of practical industry know-how. I'm not sure how anything he said here would be \"out on a limb.\"</p>\n\n<p>An \"OU-D\" can mean any of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Product is halachically dairy.</li>\n<li>Product was made on dairy equipment. (I.e. don't eat it <em>with</em> meat, but you could eat it afterwards.) </li>\n<li>Product is halachically pareve, but the \"D\" is there to warn those with allergies that there may be traces of dairy.</li>\n<li>Product is halachically pareve, but the company figured to just put the \"D\" on there in case they felt like reformulating to dairy ingredients in the future, or switching the equipment to dairy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can call the OU and ask them about a given OU-D product, \"is this halachically dairy or made on dairy equipment?\"</p>\n\n<p>Personally I wouldn't trust the allergen label alone as proof of pareveness, but it would probably mean it's worth trying to call the OU. (Please don't bother the OU by calling to ask whether Smith's Country Vanilla Yogurt is <em>really</em> dairy.) If Rabbi Bleich commented about Oreos, that's because he knows exactly what goes on in their factory.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I sent an email to the OU (kosherq@ou.org) about this issue and received the following response:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>No, one cannot assume that these products are DE, as some companies are not concerned about allergen and will not write a dairy warning. They may still contain actual dairy.</strong> [emphasis mine]</p>\n  \n  <p>If a product lists dairy ingredients on the ingredient panel, it is obviously dairy. Some common dairy ingredients are Milk, Yogurt, Cheese, Cream, Butter, Whey, Lactose, Casein, and Caseinate.  However, a product may contain a dairy ingredient that is not listed on the ingredient panel such as those present in the product’s unspecified ingredient ‘flavors’. Due to these concerns it is not entirely possible to determine the dairy status of a product based solely on the listed ingredients.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I also asked about Oreos specifically, and was told that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At the present time [late 2012], most varieties of Oreo Cookies contain dairy ingredients, with two notable exceptions. Original Oreo Sandwich Cookie and Oreo Double Stuf Sandwich Cookie do not contain dairy ingredients, though they are manufactured on dairy equipment.</p>\n  \n  <p>Please note that it is possible that the manufacturer will reformulate this product and add a true dairy ingredient. You will not be able to know this, since the OUD kosher symbol will remain the same. We recommend that you call our office every 3 months to reconfirm the DE status of this product.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I highly doubt very many people contact the OU every 3 months to ask about Oreos!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Just received this week :</p>\n\n<p>Kashrus Alert: Some Pringles are Now Dairy</p>\n\n<p>‎Today, ‎April ‎29, ‎2018 | </p>\n\n<p>Pringles has changed many of its OU pareve potato crisps to OU dairy.

Others are signing off that they indeed already performed a Bedika (typically via Chazaka) and that one is free to use immediately without performing an additional Bedika. (The Hashagachot appearing on Bodeik and Golden Flo brand frozen broccoli - as indicated by their packaging).  These same Hashgachot will also certify frozen vegetables which do not require a Bedika (ex: frozen peas, carrots, corn). For these types of vegetables there really isn't any difference between the role of the various Hashgachot.

(See, for example, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0220.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 20:19</a>, <em>eh-LO-hei CHE-sef vei-lo-HEI za-HAV</em>.

Throughout this answer, I'm using the word \"syllable\" to refer to the Hebrew grammar concept of <em>tenua</em>, which is a little different from what \"syllable\" generally means. A <em>tenua</em> always contains a non-<em>shva</em> vowel and may also include adjacent letters with <em>shva</em>s under them. A <em>shva</em> never forms a <em>tenua</em> on its own; it's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shva#Traditional_classification\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">always assigned</a> to the <em>tenua</em> formed by an adjacent letter.<sup></p>\n<p>2. \"להוציא\" - \"to extract\"</sup></p>\n<p>3. \"המוציא\" - \"The One Who extracts\"</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><s>To answer the <em>pasuk</em> in <em>Devarim</em>, <em>nasog achor</em> does not apply following a <em>mafsik</em> - a break/pause, if I remember correctly, and <em>lecha</em> has a <em>pashta</em> on it, which is a <em>mafsik</em>. Since, <em>klalei dikduk</em> have you pausing anyway after a <em>mafsik</em>, there is no need fto use <em>nasog achor</em> for <em>tiferes Ha'kriah</em>. On <em>L'Hotzi</em> in <em>Tehilim</em>, the <em>trop</em> is a <em>maircha</em>, which is a <em>mechaber</em> - a connector, so <em>nasog achor</em> applies.</s></p>\n\n<p>The above is correct but irrelevant. More correctly, <em>nasog achor</em> is called when there is not enough space between the accented syllables. Since <em>lecha</em> is <em>milra</em>, there is a tenuah between the stress on <em>-tzee</em> and the stress on <em>-cha</em> so המוציא can stay <em>milra</em>. In <em>Tehilim</em>, <em>lechem</em> being <em>milail</em> would leave no space between <em>-cha</em> and <em>Le-</em>, and there is no natural pause because it is a <em>maircha</em>, so <em>nasog achor</em> activates.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is \"קוצר לשחת\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <em>mishna</em>, <em>M'nachos</em> 71 <em>amud</em> 1, says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קוצר לשחת ומאכיל לבהמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, under the circumstances described there (not important for this question), one is allowed to cut his grain לשחת and feed the produce to his animal. What does \"קוצר לשחת\" mean exactly?</p>\n\n<p><em>Pin'chas K'hasi</em> translates \"שחת\" IIRC as מספוא, which modern-Hebrew dictionaries say means animal feed. That'd mean \"קוצר לשחת\" means \"he may cut [grain] for animal feed\" — but that's clearly incorrect in light of the <em>g'mara</em> (<em>amud</em> 2) that discusses קוצר לשחת and feeding humans (\"לאדם מי שמעת ליה\").</p>\n\n<p>Nor can it be referring to cutting the grain at an early stage of development, as the <em>mishna</em> itself discusses קוצר לשחת when the grain is developed (\"משהביא שליש\").</p>\n\n<p>So I suppose it must be referring to a certain method of cutting the grain. What method? Or, if not that, then what does it refer to?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The word שחת means produce of wheat or barley cut from stalks of grain which have not yet grown fully - see Rashi in <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=avoda_zara&daf=20b&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avodah Zora 20b</a>. However, at the top of Daf 71a it says that there are several stages of growth of the grain:</p>\n\n<p>1) חשרשה (when the planted grain takes root).</p>\n\n<p>2) אגם (when the grain has grown enough so that the top of the stalk can be bent down to touch its base).</p>\n\n<p>3) שחת (when the grain is suitable for cutting for שחת).</p>\n\n<p>4) הבאת שליש (when it has reached a third of its growth).</p>\n\n<p>5) אביב (when the grain is fully grown).</p>\n\n<p>Thus grain which is cut from the stage of שחת (which is before a third of its growth) until it is fully grown is called שחת. This can be used either as animal fodder or for human consumption (by roasting the grains as Rashi says on 71b). (But since the most common usage of שחת was apparently for animal fodder, it is commonly translated this way, albeit imprecisely).</p>\n\n<p>Hence the Mishnah on 71a says that before the Omer one is allowed to cut the grain for שחת if the purpose is for animal fodder (because it is not considered harvesting), but not if the purpose is for human consumption (because then it is considered harvesting). There then follows a dispute whether this is permitted only if one started cutting before the grain had reached a third of its growth - from the time when the grain was first suitable for this, or even when one began cutting later.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Bartenura on Peiah 2:1 says it means it was cut before a third of its growth. In Menachos the Bartenura says it means before the LAST third of its growth R. Yehudah explains that even if he started cutting before the last third it is still okay; whereas R. Shimon holds that even if he began cutting after the begining of the last third its okay. </p>\n\n<p>But after the last third (=100% ripe) everyone agrees we must wait for the Omer.</p>\n\n\n",

It was an expression, therefore, that was used when congratulating pregnant women, and not said after the child's birth.</p>\n\n<p>In time, the phrase came to be associated with events that had already transpired, making its pronouncement inappropriate when the event had not yet occurred. In the words of David Curwin, whose article on Balashon I link to above:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And because it [the phrase, <em>mazal tov</em>] became associated with happy\n  events like marriages and <em>britot</em>, it eventually transformed into a\n  general phrase of congratulations.

If someone\n  won a contest – you could say to them “<em>mazal tov</em>”, even though there\n  was no wish for the future. On the other hand, to say to someone who\n  is about to take a difficult test or have a job interview “<em>mazal\n  tov</em>” would be considered strange (even though you would say to them\n  “good luck” in English.)...</p>\n  \n  <p>After <em>mazal tov</em> made the transformation from wish to\n  congratulations, a linguistic vacuum was created. That gap was\n  eventually filled by the phrase “<em>be’shaa tova</em>” בשעה טובה, which\n  really has the same meaning as <em>mazal tov</em> (literally \"at a good\n  hour\"), and is used for something up and coming (like a pregnancy or\n  engagement), but doesn't have the “evil eye” aspect of congratulating\n  on something that’s already happened (which isn't an issue after a\n  birth or marriage).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Curwin notes in that article that he has not found a pre-20th century source for the phrase <em>besha'ah tovah</em> being used in relation to an event that has not yet occurred. Saying it to a pregnant women would appear to be a very recent development in Jewish tradition.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>At a good time or at the right time.

    "content": "# May a ben-Noach ask a non-Jew for psak?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/30404/1713\">This question</a> asks who b'nei Noach turn to for psak. The answer to that question was that there are a few rabbis who are involved in the b'nei Noach movement who rule on the law for non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Now I am asking whether it would be considered permissible for a non-Jew to rule on the halacha according to the sheva mitzvot b'nei Noach for non-Jews. My inclination tells me that it would be permissible (since one of the 7 mitzvot is to set up a system of courts), but I am not sure.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>According to R. Yitzchak Ze'ev Soloveitchik, only a Jewish court can rule on doubts in Noahide law. However, he seems to be referring to determining as yet unestablished areas of Noahide law (i.e., new questions that weren't previously ruled on), but he might not apply this to ruling on existing areas of Noahide law. Likewise, he appears to be talking about a ruling of a legitimate Jewish court (i.e., beis din ha-gadol) which has authority to determine the law, not a local orthodox rabbi. </p>\n\n<p>See חידושי מרן רי\"ז הלוי עה\"ת, פ' ואתחנן: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם יש ספק בדין מן הדינים של מצות ב\"נ הרי הם צריכין לבוא לפני ב\"ד של\n  ישראל לדרוש ולדון במדות שהתורה נדרשת בהן, אבל לא להם לדרוש ולדון\n  ולהוציא דבר מתוך דבר... דגם בשבע מצות שלהן בין הקבלה ובין הדיון במדות\n  שהתורה נדרשת בהן להבין דבר מתוך דבר, הכל נמסר רק לישראל לבד ולא להם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(See also: R. Naftali Tzvi Yehuda Bar-Ilan, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=53344&st=&pgnum=214&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishtar u-Medinah be-Yisrael al pi ha-Torah, vol. 4, p. 1574</a>. A similar issue is whether non-Jewish civil law is supposed to follow the rules of Jewish civil law; the Rema maintains that this is subject to a debate in the Talmud, while others, including Netziv, state that non-Jewish civil law is entirely independent.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>They'd need to get their answer from people who are learned in Jewish law, not from people who aren't. So it would be better to ask a rabbi than a Noachide leader, unless there comes a time when (perhaps??... I don't have sources that it could happen) the Jewish community supports and teaches Gentile leaders to answer halachic questions of that nature. This would always be under Jewish authority, though; it's not a totally separate movement from the faith system carried by the Jewish nation.</p>\n\n<p>There are also halachic concerns specifically related to the time a non-Jew spends with the Jewish community, in which case the community itself would need to decide how a Gentile can can best respect the things that they are guarding before God while with them. Some things will differ from place to place.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, how should Gentiles choose rabbis to learn from and follow? They can find people who are generally respected by the observant Jewish community as a whole and whom they personally respect as loving God, holding close both to the spirit and letter of Torah, and learning it so they can live it themselves in love for Him and both kindness and justice towards others.</p>\n\n\n",

For instance, since parnassah is determined on Rosh Hashonah it does not help to work more, you will always receive the amount alloted. \nThe gemara says \"השלך על ה\" יהבך והוא יכלכלך\"   roughly translated as, place on hashem your burdens and he will support you. The gemara asks, what is the meaning of the word יהבך/burdens?\nThe gemara says, a rabbi saw an arab go by with his donkey, and the rabbi was carrying a large burden, he said to the arab, can you take my stuff, the arab said \"you can place your יהבך\" \nFrom here the gemara learns that יהבך means burdens. \nThe vilna Gaon says, it cant be the gemara needed to find out the meaning of a word from an arab. Rather the rabbis were unsure if יהבך meant your extra burdens or even the basics that everyone would assume we should work for. \nBut the story with the arab illustrates that יהבך means even the basics we should place on hashem and he will provide. Because according to derech hateva there is no way an arab donkey owner would take all these goods, especially not for free. But this rabbi because of his exceptional trust had even the unnatural occur. \nHe also brings a story of (i think the chida) who after giving a shiur on bitachon one day, a simple worker who had attended the shiur, went home quit his job and after weeks of no food or money all of a sudden found money and became wealthy. \nThe students of the chida were upset, after all they had been learning about Bitachon for many years. The chida told them, this man had simple trust, he heard that g-d controls money and therefore work is pointless and he saw that as truth. You all look at it as a sugya, there is a tzad to say we need hishtadlus and a tzad to say we do not, and therefore you do not receive without hishtadlus. </p>\n\n<p>He brings yaakov placing the stick before lavans animals, not as a proof of hishtadlus, rather that because it was his job to take care of lavans animals, he was required to act to the full amount. \nOne of the great mussar seforim writes about the presents and preparation for war, and prayer that yaakov did before going to esav. And he asks, where was his Bitachon?\nHe makes a distinction in the requirement of Hishtadlus, that by ones own middos having Bitachon is not enough, and since yaakov felt a little fear he had to do hishtadlus. </p>\n\n<p>According to the Saba, even the chovos halevavos would agree that for the one who exceedingly trusts no histadlus is required, but for other Hihtadlus is. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Aside from the days set aside for impurity, what exactly is a man allowed to do with his wife in regards to intimacy?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A man cannot touch, stare, kiss or have relations with a woman he is not married with.</p>\n\n<p>On the days when the laws of impurity do not apply, what exactly can a man do with his wife?</p>\n\n<p>Assuming extra precaution is taken to avoid wasting the seed of the man, is everything else allowed? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Seven days of impurity.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Actually it's more like 12-ish. The Torah states that if a woman experiences an unusual flow, she needs to wait for it to end, and then count seven clean days. For the last ~1600 years, we operate with the rule of thumb that we don't know what's called \"usual\" or \"unusual\", and thus it's duration of bleeding, or 5 days, whichever is more; followed by 7 clean days. AND then an IMMERSION IN A MIKVAH (ritual bath). Without the immersion she's still impure.</p>\n\n<p>But to answer your question. The Talmud quotes a Rabbi Yochanan ben Dahavai -- \"as holy as G-d's ministering angels\" -- that if you look <em>there</em>, you'll die; if you kiss <em>that</em>, your children will be crippled, all sorts of awful stuff. The Talmud acknowledges this ascetic opinion, and then simply states: \"but the majority of rabbis opine otherwise, and the law does not follow Rabbi Yochanan ben Dahavai.\"</p>\n\n<p>At first glance, thus, everything would be permitted. Some later rabbis, however, read the conclusion as \"everything -- means everything except for one or two things.\" Meanwhile, an ascetic tradition -- whose influences may have been Kabbalistic and/or Christian -- certainly influenced several major later codifiers of Jewish law. The Karo/Issreles code from the 1500s doesn't seem too thrilled with intimacy as anything other than a necessity, and proscribes several acts accordingly. (Though fascinatingly, their code addresses the subject twice -- once in the section relating to an individual and his personal ritual obligations, using very stern language; the other in the section on laws of marriage, and suddenly as there are now two people in the room, the language isn't nearly as harsh.)</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Talmud speaks of a prohibition called \"don't do gross things\", for instance, while <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=11#C2231\">certain kinds of locusts</a> are kosher (at least in theory) and they don't require ritual slaughter, you shouldn't swallow a live one as it's wiggling -- \"don't do gross things.\" Certain rabbis applied this language to certain intimate acts, which raises the question of subjectivity and whose definition of \"gross\" if it wasn't already described by the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>Today, there are contemporary rabbis with opinions running the gamut from a very ascetic view to a very permissive one -- with similar discussion whether the more ascetic language of some texts was intended as law, custom, suggestion, or an appropriate act of piety for those on the right spiritual level.</p>\n\n<p>Contemporary authority Rabbi Yehuda Herzl Henkin sets out his opinion in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20023&pgnum=55\">Bnei Banim 4:16</a> (and the next few essays), for those who read rabbinic Hebrew. He has declined to publish his stance in English, however if you email someone at www.yoatzot.org, they will privately describe his ruling. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can one provide collateral to one's own debtors?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Picture the following scenario: Reuben needs to borrow money, and Shimon is happy to lend it to him. Unfortunately, Shimon won't lend Reuben the sum that he is after without something in the way of collateral, and Reuben owns absolutely nothing. Not to worry: Shimon strikes upon a brilliant solution. He gives to Reuben, free of charge, a brand new car. Then he lends Reuben the money, using the car as collateral.</p>\n\n<p>Absurd, yes? So explain to me how this is any different to the procedure of the <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prozbul\" rel=\"nofollow\">prozbul</a></em>, which we learn about in the Mishna, Shevi'it 10:6.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין כותבין פרוזבול אלא על הקרקע. אם אין לו, מזכה הוא בתוך שדהו כל שהוא</p>\n  \n  <p>We do not write a <em>prozbul</em> unless it be on land. If he [the borrower]\n  has none, he [the lender] grants him some from his own field, of any\n  size.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, the implication appears to be that without some form of land as collateral, the <em>bet din</em> won't take responsibility for the loan. But, as with the example that I gave above, in the event that the debtor defaults on the loan, the compensation is now coming from property that was previously owned by the lender!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See Gittin 37a where the Gemara states that in order to write a prusbul the borrower does not need to own land of equal value to the loan, but even a miniscule amount of land is sufficient. Therefore, it is certainly worthwhile for the lender to give him a miniscule piece of land, which is worth much less than the debt, to enable him to write a prusbul and not loose out the entire debt by the laws of shmitta. \nAs to why land is required at all see the following two explanations:</p>\n\n<p>רש\"י מסכת גיטין דף לז עמוד א </p>\n\n<p>אלא על הקרקע - אם יש קרקע ללוה דלא תקנו אלא בזמן שהחוב כשאר רוב שטרות שהן נגבין מן הקרקע דהוי מלתא דשכיחא כדאמרינן בכמה דוכתי דבמילתא דלא שכיחא לא עבוד רבנן תקנתא ואף על פי שאינו שוה כל החוב כדקתני לקמיה קרקע כל שהוא האמרן אפילו מלא מחט גובה מלא קרדום כמעשה דקטינא דאביי (כתובות דף לא:).</p>\n\n<p>ר\"ש מסכת שביעית פרק י משנה ו </p>\n\n<p>אא\"כ יש לו קרקע ללוה דאז חשוב החוב כגבוי ביד ב\"ד ולא קרינא ליה לא יגוש וכמלוה שיש עליה משכון והאי דעדיפא קרקע ממטלטלין [לאו] משום דכלין דהרי עציץ נקוב המונח על גבי יתדות דיכול לכלותו ואמר בהשולח (דף לז א) דכותבין עליו פרוזבול אלא כך הוא דין דקרקע חשיבא כגבוי טפי:</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Can one use terumah to light a stove?",
    "content": "# Can one use terumah to light a stove?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=23&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 23a</a>, the gemara (in the name of Rav Papa) derives from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.18.27?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 18:27</a> that the prohibition of terumah to non-priests only applies to eating and drinking, but not to other forms of enjoyment. The example given in the gemara pertains to the mishna in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Eruvin.3.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 3:1</a>, to the effect that a yisrael can use terumah for his eruv.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.etzion.org.il/vbm/archive/yomyom/h/h30.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> at Virtual Beit Midrash, this statement in the gemara has been understood to mean that terumah is only forbidden for consumption by yisraelim, but not for regular enjoyment (מותרת בהנאה לזרים). As the author of the article (ר' מתן גלידאי) makes clear, this ruling created problems for the rishonim, concerning how to align it with the mishna in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Terumot.11.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Terumot 11:9</a>. There, the mishna makes clear that kohanim may feed their animals terumah, but that yisraelim cannot. If there is no prohibition of deriving enjoyment from terumah, why would a yisrael be prevented from feeding it to his livestock?</p>\n<p>The resolution acc. to that same article, which was proposed by Rabbeinu Tam, is to the effect that the Torah permits yisraelim to enjoy terumah, but forbids them from any form of enjoyment that results in the eradication of that terumah (הנאה של כילוי). This explains why a yisrael would be forbidden from feeding his livestock with terumah, as well as why the mishna in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Terumot.11.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Terumot 11:10</a> would permit his burning terumah for the public good - as long as it was with the permission of a kohen.</p>\n<p>But how does it align with the mishna in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Terumot.10.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Terumot 10:4</a>? There, the mishna speaks of somebody lighting his stove with cumin of terumah (תנור שהסיקו בכמון של תרומה). The discussion as to whether or not bread cooked upon this stove is permissible for consumption is one that pertains to the separate issue of whether or not aroma is a tangible substance (ריחא מילתא היא), but so far as the actual burning of the cumin is concerned, the following is what the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Terumot.10.4?lang=bi&p2=Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Terumot.10.4.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bartenura</a> has to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואי משום דהוסק התנור בתרומה, אין איסורה איסור הנאה</p>\n<p>And concerning the fact that <strike>he lit the stove</strike> the stove was lit with terumah, its\nprohibition is not a prohibition of enjoyment [but only of\nconsumption].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How does this align with the prohibition of הנאה של כילוי, as expressed by Rabbeinu Tam?</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>To compound this problem, both opinions are brought (contradictorily) in Kehati's peirush on the Mishna. In his commentary on Terumot 10:4, he quotes the Bartenura as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומה שהוסק התנור בתרומה אין בזה איסור, שאין התרומה אסורה לזרים בהנאה\nאלא באכילה בלבד</p>\n<p>And concerning the fact that <strike>he lit the stove</strike> the stove was lit with terumah, this is\nnot prohibited, since terumah is not prohibited to non-priests when it\ncomes to enjoyment but only when it comes to eating [and drinking].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later, however, in his introduction to Terumot 11:10, he explicitly declares the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואף על פי שתרומה אינה מאיסורי הנאה, ומותרת היא בהנאה לזרים, מכל מקום\nהנאה של כילוי, כגון בענייננו שההנאה באה משריפת התרומה, אסור היא לזרים</p>\n<p>Even though terumah is not of those things that are forbidden from\nenjoyment, and is permitted for the enjoyment of non-priests, the\nenjoyment that comes from eradication (הנאה של כילוי) - such as is\nfound in this instance, in which the enjoyment comes from the burning\nof terumah - is forbidden to non-priests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>In summary, the two ways of putting this question are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>If yisraelim are allowed to enjoy terumah so long as they do not destroy it, why does the Bartenura suggest that burning it (in Terumot 10:4) is okay?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How can Kehati explicitly say that burning terumah (in Terumot 10:4) is okay, but then say no less explicitly (in Terumot 11:10) that burning terumah is impermissible?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The mishna in 10:4 is referring to lighting an oven where the benefit is the heat that is derived after the teruma is already burned, therefore it is only a question of \"shvach eitzim\" which is only prohibited by things that are issurei hannah. However, teruma is not issur haana and therefore benefit of the heat that is given off is mutar. (See Kehati after that Mishna as well as Mishna Achrona there).</p>\n<p>The mishna in 11:10 is referring to benefit of light which is a direct benefit of burning and is assur as it is considered benefiting from the eradication of teruma.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are two status of Teruma. Teruma Tehora and Teruma Temea. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sheviit.8.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sheviit 8.2</a>.</p>\n<p>For an Israel who used against the law Teruma, he needs to pay his consommation of Teruma to the Kohen equally for Tehora and Temea. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Terumot.1.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Terumot 1.6</a>. If he eats teruma temea, he pays keren and chomesh despite that the Kohen cannot eat it. But for the Kohen they are different. E.g. oil of T. Tehora is prohibited for lighting but T. Temea is permitted.</p>\n<p>The Mishna Terumot 11.10 addresses the laws of Teruma Temea. It's permitted for a Kohen to profit from it's burning, light and heat. If he profits, there is no loss for him if and Israel also profits. But an Israel is prohibited to use it for himself.</p>\n<p>The Mishna Terumot 10.4 deals with two issues, is the bread allowed despite it's a result of a profit from burning teruma tehora? Is the bread permitted for a non kohen despite that it contains \"odor\" of Teruma. The Bartenura explains that teruma is not prohibited from hanaa. He doesn't say that it's prohibited only from achila. Indeed the Teruma has permission for the Kohen, even if it is Tame. So an Israel who profits from the Teruma needs to pay and this he has a debt, no consequences for the results of his profit. <strong>Burning is not ok, it's prohibited, and if he is Israel he needs to pay keren and chomesh. But he has not to destroy the bread or the oven.</strong></p>\n<p>There is a problem of homonimy. <strong>The classic concept of Isur Hanaa is prohibited for everyone</strong>,  the direct result of some action made with it is also prohibited, as for a meal that was cooked by the burning of Orla which is prohibited from Hanaa. Because the benefit of the \"wood\" is directly effective on the meal.  Every profit is absolutely prohibited for everyone. This is not the case of Shemen Serefa or Karshine Teruma.</p>\n<p>In 11.10 they say that an Israel has a prohibition to use Teruma Temea as he has for Tehora. But a Kohen, has permission to eat Tehora and not to burn, see Sheviit 8.2. But he  has a permission to burn Temea and to profit from this burning. <strong>The oil of Teruma Temea is therefore generally called in Mishna \"Shemen Serefa\".</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Terumot 10:4 is speaking of a case of דיעבד. You shouldn't do it - but if you did you can eat the bread.</p>\n\n<p>Burning Teruma is actually <em>not</em> permissible, as long as the Teruma is tahor. If it becomes tame - that's a whole different story. </p>\n\n\n",

The Mishna Brurah brings the Marah Sasson who forbids it because there is no <em>chachma</em>. It is also mentioned in the Rama that it makes noise, and as far as I know chess does not involve noise? Also, the Aruch Hashulchan says the pieces hit each other, he also gives another name for the game (מייליסקע\"ס, seems similar to kugalach) not sure if it translates as chess. The Magen Avraham gives yet another name for the game.

The Kaf HaHayyim saw both of these seforim and quotes them both. Citations to the Mishnah Berurah can be easily found in Hilchot Purim, and citations to the Aruch HaShulchan can be found in Yoreh Deah 74, 75, and 76 (at least), but there are interesting opinions brought in the Aruch HaShulchan that would seem appropriate to cite in Yoreh Deah 69 and 70, yet Kaf HaHayyim does not cite them.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't learned the Kaf HaHayyim from cover to cover yet, but maybe someone who has can answer this: where in Kaf HaHayyim does he first cite each of these works?</p>\n\n<p>The Kaf HaHayyim cites ער’’ה often, but I think always refers to the Erech HaShulchan (ערך השלחן), by the Tunisian posek R’ Yitzhak Taieb, as that's the only work given for that acronym in the luach rahsei teviot.

This sefer is cited by acronym, but the Misat Binyamin is also cited using the <code>מ\"ב</code> acronym, so I disambiguated by taking advantage of the different ways of referrring to parts of each text.</p>\n\n<p>I identified the Aruch HaShulchan by the text <code>ערוך השלחן</code>, because this sefer is never cited by acronym.

One reference is <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41570&st=&pgnum=16&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. The Kli Yakar (published 1602) also has several mentions of it, one is <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%99_%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%90_%D7%9C%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 1:31</a> and another is <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%99_%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%98_%D7%9B\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 9:20</a>.</p>\n<p>As far as I know the first appearance of the famous addition of the word \"mamash\" that is known from Tanya at the beginning of chapter two is in a sefer called <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11647&st=&pgnum=5&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שפע טל</a>, by Rabbi <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabtai_Sheftel_Horowitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabtai Shefel Horowitz</a> published in 1612. In the first paragraph of the introduction he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ידוע שהנשמות של אומה ישראלית הם חלק אלוה ממעל על זה רמז הפסוק כי חלק ה' עמו ר\"ל חלק ממש כחלק שנחלק מאיזה דבר הוא שוה ודומה בעינו לאותו דבר שנחלק ממנו</p>\n<p>It is known that the souls of the Jewish nation are a \"portion of G-d above.\" On this the Posuk hints \"A portion of G-d is with him\" meaning an actual part [as opposed to an  idiomatic statement] that was taken from something - it is equal and similar in its type to the thing it was taken from.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is certainly understood from the language \"it is known\" that the concept is not new even at that point, even if the association with this particular wording is. (See, for example, the Ramban on Bereishis 2:7 where it says that the soul is רוח שם הגדול - which is in line with how Tanya explains it).</p>\n<p>The author of the שפע טל is the nephew of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Horowitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yishaya Horowitz</a>, better known as the Shaloh HaKadosh. In his Sefer (Part 1, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9736&st=&pgnum=28&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bais Chachma towards the end</a>) he says \"You already know the Neshama is a Chelek Elokah Mimal\". This was printed later than the שפע טל (well after the Shaloh HaKadosh had passed away).</p>\n<p>In terms of what it means, this is explained at some length in Tanya <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7881/jewish/Chapter-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Part 1 Chapter 2</a> as well as <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7937/jewish/Chapter-4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Part 3 Chapter 4</a>. That latter explanation is more direct and to the point: The soul is G-dly, a part of G-d's Name. It is a metaphor that expresses the idea that there is a qualitative difference between the soul and other spiritual creations like angels. Lessons in Tanya succinctly sums it up:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This, then, is the difference between souls and angels: Souls derive from the innermost aspect of G‑dliness, the Tetragrammaton, while angels are rooted in the external aspect of G‑dliness, the Divine Name Elokim</p>\n<p>What characteristics of the soul also characterize Havayah, the Four-Letter Name of G‑d, and thus indicate that the soul is indeed a part of that Name? In answer to this question, the Alter Rebbe now explains that just as the Ten Sefirot are included within the Tetragrammaton, so, too, there are ten corresponding faculties that are intrinsic to the soul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So to sum it up in a sentence, although all creation comes from G-d, creation in general feels itself to have an independent existence, whereas the soul spoken about here does not - it recognizes its inseparability from G-d.</p>\n<p>In Tanya the Alter Rebbe notes an observable expression of this phenomena - many Jews throughout history who were emphatically not observant to any serious degree, and simply didn't do much about their Judaism in their day to day lives still gave up their lives rather than undergo forced conversion. This is an expression of the soul's refusal to be separate from G-d above its own existence. [This is sometimes misunderstood to mean that martyrdom is uniquely Jewish. It is not at all, but the point being a martyr is someone you would expect to have a high dedication to their cause prior to the circumstance where they chose martyrdom, rather than it coming seemingly out of nowhere].</p>\n<p>Basically, as I heard <a href=\"http://www.torahcafe.com/scholar/rabbi-elimelech-zweibel_0000000583.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Elimelech Zweibel</a> explain it, the problem with the metaphor of the שפע טל above is that when it comes to something physical, you can say that part is taken, and moved to another place. Take a cup of water out of the ocean, and bring it to your house. You now have a piece of the ocean in your house.</p>\n<p>However, in these spiritual concepts of higher angels, lower angels, etc. they are not physical. You cannot \"move\" them to a different place. When something is of a lower spiritual stature, it <em>is</em> in the lower world by definition. If you take something spiritually higher and lower its spiritual status, it is inherently lower. So how can anything spiritual retain that higher world aspect and still come down into lower worlds.</p>\n<p>For this the Alter Rebbe gives two metaphors. One is speech vs. blowing, the other is fathering a child. The point of both is to illustrate something descending into a lower state while maintaining qualities of its higher source, different from other things that come from the same source but do not maintain that quality.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>its a quotation from Scripture (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16433#v=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iyov 31:2</a>) </p>\n\n<p>and see tanya, (by rabbi shneur zalman boruchovitch - first lubavitch rebbe ) those are the first words of <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7881/jewish/Chapter-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">chapter two:</a> (with the addition of the word \"mamesh\" ) it is explained there a length. </p>\n\n<p>here is a quote</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>to describe G-d’s implanting the Jew’s soul in his body signifies that this soul originates in the “innermost” aspect of G-dliness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>see there at length</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramchal in Da'at Tevunot refers to the soul as a chelek eloah mima'al.

If yes, then the man is fined. If not, then the girl is executed publicly.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.22.20?lang=bi&aliyot=1&p2=Rashi_on_Deuteronomy.22.20.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">22:20</a> brings down the oral law which explains that it refers to the case where there were witnesses that she committed adultery. The plain reading of the verses however offers no such clue. It appears that only if the bedsheet did not have blood, then the girl is stoned to death by all the inhabitants of the city.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone unfamiliar with the oral law will read this and consider the Torah to be barbaric and bizarre. Question is why did God write the Torah in such a way that it appears so misleading without the oral law.</p>\n\n<p>There are many many other examples, take for example in Parshas Vayera (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.6-7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 21:6-7</a>) \"Upon seeing the son of Hagar engaged in 'laughter' Sarah demands that Hagar and her \"son\" be sent away\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">21:10</a>). Without the oral law which explains \"laughter\" to be attempted murder it seems really, really bizarre. What just because the kid laughed, you want to send away him and his mother to die in the desert??? </p>\n\n<p>Is the Torah trying to repel those without access to the oral law??</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>What could be contained in this question, and manner in which we answer it, is going to depend on several things. First of all, we should clarify what we're asking about: your specific question mentioned only phrases that needed 'reinterpretation', but there are many more cases that deserve inquiry, such as gezairah shavas (see the Rambam's introduction to the Mishna, where he breaks it up into 5 components, and we should really ask about the requirement for all 5). Another matter to take into account is the question of how we view the roles of/relationship between 'pshat' and 'derash' - which, in turn, might differ between narrative passages (parts of the Torah that tell a story) and instructive (as in, commandments) sections. The examples in your question contained a sample of each. Additionally, this question can be asked in two forms: 'why is there a clear need for an Oral Law (meaning, why did the Written Law have to be written with contradictions and ambiguities)', or, 'why does the halakha follow something other than the plain meaning', which is asked <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/38763/why-does-halacha-not-follow-the-simple-reading-of-the-biblical-text\">here</a>, which is a distinct question and not directly meant to be answered here (though I think it is indirectly).</p>\n<h2>1. Idiomatic Expressions</h2>\n<p>Some differences between the Written Law and its explanation can be simply explained by saying that the expression in the text of the Torah literally means what the Oral Law says, and that's how it would have been interpreted by any reader of the Torah around the time and place where it was written - <em>even without the Oral tradition</em>. In other words, these are idioms or expressions whose meaning would have been clear to the original recipients of the Torah and we only needed to preserve these <em>peirushim hamekubalim misinai</em> because these expressions might fall out of use and need to be understood thousands of years later. For example, the Torah commands that <em>[these things/words should be] 'totafos' between your eyes</em> (Devarim 6:4). Disregarding the meaning of totafos, why would the Torah say 'between your eyes' when it means 'above your hairline' (Shulchan Aruch 27:9)? The answer, as evidenced by Ugaritic texts, is this is what the phrase actually means, as it is an idiom for the front of the head, not the nose-bridge between the eyes. [footnote 1] Similarly, Rashi's explanation of your example in Devarim 22 indicates that, in fact, a reader of the text without an Oral tradition would actually get it right - if they were a reader in Israel, c. 1200 BCE. (I admit that in this particular case, such an explanation may be unsatisfying). I am fairly certain that the question of Yishmael's 'playing' should be understood in the same way, namely, that an ancient reader would not have been puzzled by this use of the word 'metzchek'. [footnote 2]</p>\n<h2>2. Levels of Meaning</h2>\n<p>Let us grant, however, that there are many more cases where <em>peirushim hamekubalim misinai</em> are not idiomatic expressions, but deviations or reinterpretations of the text. The most striking and oft-discussed example is the requirement for an injurer to pay 'an eye for an eye' (Shemos 21:23), which the Sages interpret to mean monetary payment (Bava Kamma 83b). While one may argue that this runs against the plain meaning of the Written Law, it isn't so clear, because the Torah also says (assuming that the Torah is one unified whole, written by One divine Author) \"you cannot accept money as reimbursement for a murder\" (Bamidbar 35:31), clearly implying that money can be accepted as payment for injury. (However, the Ibn Ezra seems to think that this too is an an idiom, as in the example above).</p>\n<p>The first approach is that the somewhat misleading message that is gleaned from seeing only one fragment of the Torah's larger picture is that the Torah intends to convey multiple levels of meaning, which are true on varying level, even if only one of them can be acted upon in terms of halakhic implementation. This seems to be brought out often in the commentary of the Ramban, who often gives explanations of the verses according to Chazal, and then a different explanation 'al pi peshat', and a third 'al derech ha'emes', and the Ramban sees no contradiction; all these meanings are intended by the verse even if only one of them can be used in halakha. In the example discussed, there may be levels in which the strict 'eye for an eye' is indeed true. The Rikanti on the pasuk in Shemos 21:23 asks, why couldn't the Torah just say 'pay money'? He shows that the manner in which the pasuk is written does teach certain kabbalistic truths. The Rambam too, may not think that there are mystical lessons taught by the 'peshat', but the moral lessons to be gained from the mitzvos are better gained from reading the peshat (Moreh Nevuchim 3:41 and in Hil. Chovel U'Mazik 1:1). Thus, the 'partial picture' of reading one pasuk in Shemos actually teaches us Torah messages, if not the halakha. [footnote 3]</p>\n<h2>3. Emphasizes the Importance of an Oral Tradition</h2>\n<p>R. Chasdai Crescas in the beginning of Ohr Hashem explains that the reason why we have 'two Torahs' and that the Written Torah is so unclear is so that it be obvious that we shouldn't rely solely on the Written Law. As Hillel told a convert, we need to rely on the Sages and the tradition in order to understand what any word may mean (Shabbos 31a), and besides, there are simply too many details to be fully contained in a book. Therefore, to make sure that we would never make the mistake of attempting to interpret the Torah without the Oral Tradition, Hashem made sure that there would be contradictions, ambiguities, etc. This explanation, in different forms, has been repeated by many others over the generations, including R. Crescas' student, R. Yosef Albo (Sefer HaIkkarim 2:23)</p>\n<p>In what may be deemed a variation of this explanation, R. Yaakov Zvi Mecklenberg, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14121&st=&pgnum=6&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in the intro to Hakesav Vehakabalah</a>, says that the Oral Torah is like the 'soul' of a physical body, and is therefore too sublime and extensive to be contained in a physical manner, but rather is left to be recognized as infinite and unending. In other words, the Torah contains so-to-speak 'imprecise' language to indicate that its true meaning is more exalted than anything that can be contained in language.</p>\n<h2>4. Flexibility of Interpretation</h2>\n<p>Thus far, we have only discussed explanations of phrases where the halakha may be different that the phrase's plain meaning, but there are other parts to the Oral Law. In the Rambam's division of the Oral Torah into five parts, he names the third part 'hekeshos', things learned from derashot such as 'gezairah shava' and the like. In these areas, it's unclear whether or not they can go against the plain meaning of the text. In Bava Kama 7b it appears that a gezaira shava cannot override the plain meaning of the text, though to what extent may be subject to an argument between R. Akiva and R. Yishmael.</p>\n<p>In this area of the Oral Law, which involves the usage of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmudical_hermeneutics\" rel=\"noreferrer\">hermeneutical principles</a>, there is considerable amount of flexibility of interpretation, which is why the Talmud is so full of arguments and different opinions. In fact, while many are aware of the concept that one court cannot annul the decrees of an earlier court unless it is greater בחכמה ובמנין (in wisdom and number), the Rambam (Hil. Mamrim 1:1-2) believes that this is only true regarding Rabbinic enactments, but with regards to interpreting the Torah - any Beis Din Hagadol can undo the interpretations of that of an earlier generation. Regarding this specific form of \"Oral Law\" therefore, some have suggested that the reason for its not being set in writing was in order to allow for flexibility. R. Moshe Shmuel Glasner, in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37184&st=&pgnum=5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">introduction to Dor Revii</a>, says that the Torah allowed for this flexibility in order to 'match with the times' so to speak, and such an idea seems to exist in the writings of Rav Kook as well.

The commentator Narboni <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31594&st=&pgnum=130\" rel=\"nofollow\">explains</a> that the written law of \"an eye for an eye\" is the ideal, which can never be practically implemented--because, as the Gemara says, one might end up killing the person which wouldn't be equitable. This means that the written Torah expresses a level of law which cannot be implemented in practice, and the oral law tells us the law as it is carried out. </p>\n\n<p>This is similar to the approach of the Vilna Gaon, who says that the oral and written law are like clay and a seal--the written law is compared to a seal which leaves its imprint backwards in the clay (Aderet Eliyahu, Parshat Mishpatim). According to the Gra, the written law by itself does not represent the law as it is actualized in this world. The \"applied law\" may appear as the opposite of the law as it is written. For the Gra, this is connected to the kabbalistic level of the written law. </p>\n\n<p>R. Moshe Shmuel Glasner, in the <a href=\"http://dor4.net16.net/elman.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">introduction to his Dor Revi'i</a>, says that the reason the oral law was not given in writing was to provide necessary flexibility (this is also the explanation given by Mordecai Gumpel Schnaber Levisohn in his Ma'amar ha-Torah veha-Chochmah <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43445&st=&pgnum=5&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>). However, the flexibility of the oral Torah doesn't extend to all cases. As the Rambam explains in the introduction to his commentary on the Mishnah, there are \"received explanations\" (peirushim mekkubalim) from Moshe, which cannot change. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your question is an important one, which can be directed towards many laws found in the Torah, as you seem to suggest.</p>\n\n<p>The principle which would answer it is this: the Torah was given along with the Oral Law (see <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/0000n.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishne Torah intro</a>). Moshe Rabbeinu was the one who explained the Torah for the Israelites throughout their wanderings in the wilderness. It was thus expected that all questions be answered by Moshe and his court. So the people were not misled by the simple meaning of the text, since everything was explained to them by Moses.</p>\n\n<p>The primary purpose of the Torah was to gain the acceptance of the first Jews receiving it. They had to believe with all their hearts that they were entering an eternal, binding treaty with God. The way other people in other times and places would understand it was irrelevant for these purposes. </p>\n\n<p>Instead, the Torah was meant to be understand in different ways at different times. Flexibility and reliance on the Oral Law was of utmost importance. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/e302n.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">MT Mamrim 2:1</a> states that a Bet Din (court) is not bound by the rulings of previous generations in regard to how to understand the text.

I realize that any kind of description of Hashem in human terms is allegorical as Hashem is not a human bounded by time and space.</p>\n\n<p>The schedule in the Gemara is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>First three hours: Hashem is engaged in Torah study</li>\n<li>Second three hours: Hashem judges his creatures</li>\n<li>Third three hours: Hashem feeds his creatures</li>\n<li>Fourth three hours: Hashem sports with Leviathan</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I can understand the idea of Hashem judging or feeding his creatures, and for some reason even sporting with Leviathan doesn't strike me as that odd. </p>\n\n<p>But what does it really mean that Hashem studies his own Torah? Why would he do this, and what does he gain from it? What are we to learn from this statement that Hashem studies the Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p><strong>First, some background information</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>In both the <em>Torah She-Bi-Kethav</em> and the <em>Torah She-B`Al Peh</em>, there is a concept of the Creator setting an example of proper ethical and moral conduct for mankind in general and for the Jewish Nation in particular. This concept of the imitation of God was developed further through the midrashic fervor of the <em>Tanna'im</em> and <em>Amora'im</em> in the <em>Mishnah</em>, <em>Talmudhim</em>, <em>Agadoth</em>, and other texts of Haza\"l.</p>\n\n<p>However, since logic tells us that the Creator does not possess positive attributes and is not subject to \"accidents\" (cf. <em>Ramba\"m Hilkhoth Yesodhei HaTorah</em> 1:1ff; <em>Pirush HaMishnayoth</em>, <em>Sanhedrin</em> 10, and <em>Moreh HaNevukhim</em> I), ALL of these attributions must be seen as metaphorical and for our benefit as He, <em>yith'aleh wa-yithborakh</em>, is a <em>Bilti Ba`al Zequq</em> (One Who needs nothing).</p>\n\n<p>The \"examples\" which have been [metaphorically] set for us by HaShem are in two categories: [1] how we must act one to another (<em>ben adham le-havero</em>), and [2] how we must act toward Him (<em>ben adham le-Maqom</em>). </p>\n\n<p>The former are shown in the well-known examples of HaShem \"performing\" various <em>misswoth</em>, such as: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Biqur Holim</em></strong> - Visiting The Sick - when He \"visited\" <em>Avraham Avinu</em> on the third day after his <em>berith milah</em> (cf. <em>Rash\"i</em>, <em>Parashath Wayera</em>; <em>b.Sotah</em> 14a)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Qevura</em></strong> - Burying The Dead - when He buried <em>Mosheh Rabbenu</em> (cf. <em>b.Sotah</em> 14a)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Hatarath Nedarim</em></strong> - Annulment Of Vows - when He removed the <em>gezerah</em> from <em>Yekhonyah HaMelekh</em> after he did <em>teshuvah</em> in <em>Bavel</em>, which resulted in the conception of <em>Shealti'el</em> the father of <em>Zerubavel</em> (cf. <em>b.Sanhedrin</em> 38a)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The later, however, are not shown to us by how HaShem serves the Creator (<em>has wa-shalom</em>), as if such a thing were even possible (<em>halilah wa-has</em>), but rather - ironically - how HaShem serves - as it were - the Jewish Nation. That is, since all of His dealings with His creations are based on the concept of <em>berith</em> (an agreement between 2 or more parties), through seeing how HaShem treats His portion of the <em>berith</em> with <em>`Am Yisrael</em> we gain insight into how we should approach our duties as spelled out in our portion of the <em>berith</em>. In this vein, we find the following examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Tefillin</em></strong> - In <em>b.Berakhoth</em> 6a, <em>Haza\"l</em> discuss the concept of HaShem's \"<em>tefillin</em>\" and what passages they might contain. The conclusion is that the passages of His \"<em>tefillin</em>\" metaphorically correspond and are reciprocal to ours. Whereas ours contain (among others) the passage <em>Shema` Yisra'el</em> (<em>Devarim</em> 6:4) - expressing our unique relationship to HaShem - His contain the passage <em>Mi KeAmekha Yisra'el</em> (<em>Divrei HaYamim</em> 17:21)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Limudh Torah</em></strong> - In various places (<em>b.Avodah Zarah</em> 3b; <em>Yalqut Shim`oni</em>, <em>Parashath KiTisa</em> \"<em>Wayeshev HaAm</em>\"; <em>Tanna DeBe Eliyahu Rabbah</em>, <em>Pereq</em> 13) the idea of HaShem studying Torah is mentioned to illustrate His steadfast devotion to His portion of the <em>berith</em>, i.e. His duties (as defined by the Torah) toward the Jewish Nation. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And it is this final example which leads to answering your question.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, to answer your question</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>I would like to suggest, based on the above explanation and the simple wording of the <em>Gemara</em> in <em>b.Avodah Zarah</em> 3b, that the proper understanding of the passage is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Gemara</em> list four activities:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Studying Torah</li>\n<li>Judging The World</li>\n<li>Providing Sustenance To All Creatures</li>\n<li>Playing with the <em>Lewiyathan</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The common thread between the later three (i.e. judging the world, providing sustenance for the world, and playing with the <em>Lewiyathan</em>) is that He is focused on tending to His creations. So then, it seems to stand to reason that HaShem's Torah study is intended to have a similar thrust. Thus, it would seem that the message for Jews in HaShem's studying of the Torah is \"Just as the Creator is careful to constantly keep His duties toward the Jewish Nation in His heart and mind - as it were - so also we should dedicate a significant portion of our time (e.g. a quarter of the day) studying the Torah so that we can dutifully fulfill our portion of the <em>berith</em> with HaShem.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to the <em>Shulhan `Arukh</em> (OH 1:1), it was a practice of the <em>Ssadiqim</em> to constantly think of HaShem and His greatness in accordance with the <em>pasuq</em> (<em>Tehillim</em> 16:8), <em>Shiwithi HaShem leneghdi thamidh</em> - \"I have set HaShem before me always.\" I suspect that this was due - at least in part - to their understanding of the above concept.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this was adequate.</p>\n\n<p><em>Kol tuv</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>A thought:</p>\n\n<p>The verse says (Eichah 3:23)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חדשים לבקרים רבה אמונתך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which is understood to mean that Hashem renews creation each morning, along the lines of מחדש בטובו בכל יום תמיד.</p>\n\n<p>The Zohar teaches that הסתכל באורייתא וברא עלמא - Hashem looked into the Torah and created the world.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in order to \"recreate anew\" each morning, Hashem again looks into the Torah to renew His creation.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Berachos (2a) says that the first 3 hours of the day are the time when it is still in the normal range of time to get up, and our souls are renewed when we awaken.  Therefore, the first 3 hours would still be the time of \"recreating\" creation according to the blueprint of the Torah.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I subsequently found this in the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14197&st=&pgnum=64\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maharal Be'er HaGolah Be'er Revi'i</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דע כי יש דעות פלוםופים שאמרו עזב\n   ה׳ את הארץ והוא מסולק מן חתחתונים.</p>\n  \n  <p>וזה שאמר ג׳ שעות ראשונות יושב\n   ועוסק בתורה. כי התורה הוא סדר הנמצאים\n   איך יתנהגו הנמצאים, וכל סדר המציאות בכלל\n   נכלל בתורה. ודבר זה ידוע מאוד מדברי חכמים,\n   במדרש (ב״ר פ״א) אמרו הקב״ה היה מביט\n   בתורה וברא את העולם</p>\n  \n  <p>כלל הדבר כי התורה שהשם יתברך\n   עוסק בה הוא סדר הנמצאים, והוא יתברך יודע\n   סדר הנמצאים, ואינו עוזב סדר שלהם עד שיהיו\n   מסולקים ממנו לגמרי וזהו שעוסק בתורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basic summary: There are some philosophers who believe that Hashem abandoned creation.  This statement of Chazal responds to that: The first 3 hours Hashem is involved in the Torah, as the Torah lays out the order of reality, as we know that Hashem looked into the world and [based on it] created the world.  The Torah that Hashem is involved in is the order of the world, and He is involved in it and has not abandoned the world.</p>\n\n<p>See the whole piece inside for a clearer idea.</p>\n\n<p>This is similar, although not the same, to what I explained.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51880&st=&pgnum=78\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tana Devai Eliyahu Raba 13</a> says that Hashem questions us when we arrive at the next world and says \"Why did you not learn from your father in heaven who sits on his Kisai Hakovod and learns a third of the day\"?</p>\n\n\n",

(Hence also the \"husband of her youth\" bit.) A woman is closer, he explains, to such a husband than to a second husband.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The word here is \"betulah\", which specifically means \"virgin.\" (\"alma\" is simply \"young woman.\") Many translators prefer \"maiden\" as it implies virginity but it's less explicit.</p>\n\n<p>Your assumption is basically correct. The Torah has laws about what happens if a \"betrothed\" (i.e. married, but unconsummated) virgin cheats on her husband, or is raped. (<a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=22#C4230\">Deuteronomy 22:23--27</a>, see also <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?action=displayanchor&pentid=P2127#P2127\">Exodus 22:15</a>.) I haven't checked the commentaries but that's most likely the simplest reading of the verse in Joel, they were \"betrothed\" and then she lost him. </p>\n\n<p>Long ago, a couple would be \"betrothed\" for a complete year before actually moving in together and consummating their marriage. This was a much stronger arrangement than today's \"engagement\", and it required a full-blown divorce to terminate. In today's Jewish weddings, \"betrothal\" happens when he hands her the ring under the <em>chupa</em>, and they go home together that night. Much shorter wait. (In Ashkenazic ceremonies, they even get ten minutes of privacy in the middle of the wedding.)</p>\n\n\n",

In your case, I don't know if there is intent not to fulfill the mitzvah, or just not much interest in doing it.

    "content": "# Niagara Falls does it require a Bracha if so which one?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Do you make a bracha when seeing Niagara falls, and, if a bracha is made, which bracha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Some believe that an \"Oseh Ma'aseh V'reishis\" should be made on the Niagara Falls because undoubtedly it is one of the most impressive natural wonders. However, after doing some research I have found that it may not be so simple because of three reasons. </p>\n\n<p>1) Rav Chaim Kanievsky is quoted (V'zos HaBrachah pg. 155) saying that waterfalls do not receive a brachah since they are not in the list that the shulchan aruch gives (mountains, seas, very large rivers etc.). The sefer V'zos Habrachah comments that even so, if the waterfall is part of a somewhat large river then it may combine with the river to become a very impressive river and then deserving of a brachah. The discussion is continued in the sequel which I unfortunately do not have access to. </p>\n\n<p>2) The Shulchan Aruch says that a river which has been diverted by people can no longer receive a brachah that praises Hashem for his work, because it is no longer only the work of Hashem. Niagara Falls has undergone changes for the purpose of hydro-power and tourist-attracting aesthetics. But, it is unclear how much change must occur for a river to lose a brachah and this might not count as change. </p>\n\n<p>3) Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach said not to make a brachah on the Dead Sea because of the medrash that it was only formed after the destruction of S'dom and the brachah \"oseh ma'aseh v'reishis\" should only be said on what was part of B'reishis- Creation. It is known that the falls erodes upstream a couple feet every year. 800 years ago there may have been only one waterfall.

    "title": "Rabbinic speculations on history",
    "content": "# Rabbinic speculations on history\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sometimes in the Rabbinic literature traditions are related about what happened in history, with multiple different opinions. For example, there was a historical development in the script used by Israelites, from something like Phoenician, to the script that has been used by Jews for at least a couple of thousand years now. The issue for the Rabbis is whether the script in which the Torah is now written is the same as the one in which it was originally written, even though the current script seems to have evolved through a natural process that can be seen in inscriptions from the Temple periods.</p>\n\n<p>The Rabbis had varying opinions about this. One view was that the Tablets and the five books were originally written in Paleo-Hebrew, and that sacred texts only began being written in the new Jewish script after the Babylonian exile (this seems close to the view of secular historians, which would be expected since it doesn't seem so miraculous). Another view is that they were originally written in the modern Jewish script, but that it fell out of use and then, in the time of Ezra, was reinstated for the copying of the scriptures. And a third view is that they were originally written in the new script and that even though the Israelite 'common' writing changed over time, the sacred texts have always been written in the same script.</p>\n\n<p>Since these can't all be true, it seems that some of the traditions at least are speculations on what might, or must, have happened historically. So the questions I want to ask here are <strong>why historical speculations were allowed into the authoritative tradition</strong>, and <strong>how literally we should accept rabbinic traditions of historical details like this</strong> (even if there <em>is</em> a consensus view). I'd really value any insights into it because I have little experience with rabbinic texts and learning.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Much more than just historical speculation is contained in the Talmud and tradition.  The Rabbis talk about science, medicine, astrology, various things we'd now consider superstition, and many many odd stories.</p>\n\n<p><em>Why were speculations like this allowed into the authoritative tradition?</em>  Well, for starters, this was just \"tradition\" before it became authoritative.  The process in which the Talmud was accepted as authoritative took centuries, and once it was accepted, it was accepted as it was, with all the stories and speculation mixed in.  In addition, when it was accepted as authoritative all those centuries ago, the historical and scientific speculation may have been viewed as correct.  Finally, the important part of the phrase \"authoritative tradition\" is the word \"tradition.\"  This material, since it was stated by the rabbis and duly recorded, became part of the tradition, whether it dealt with religion, philosophy, or more sundry matters.</p>\n\n<p><em>How literally we should accept rabbinic traditions of historical details like this, or other things which have since been proven incorrect?</em>  In general, if the issue under discussion has Halachic ramifications (which incidentally happens to include our spontaneously generating lice), we take it literally.  To a degree.  Later rabbis analyze, dissect, and if necessary, interpret it. Otherwise, we may study it, and in fact consider it to be \"learning torah\" when we do so, but we don't take any practical action based on it, and as such, whether we believe it literally is simply a matter of personal preference and outlook.</p>\n\n<p>(Speaking of which, some Jews believe that everything the rabbis said is correct.  In fact, there are those who think that all science can be learned from the Torah and Talmud.  (Every few years there's another article about how some recent scientific discovery was \"predicted\" or \"known\" by the rabbis centuries ago.)  Other Jews hold that the rabbis may have correct based on the knowledge of their time, but we, with modern science and archaeology, now know better.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Annelise, This question has remained unanswered because in a way it's unanswerable. Here's why:</p>\n\n<p>It is in the nature of both the Hebrew Language, and of Jewish learning, to force the student to make the connections by him/herself. This was for a number of reasons, including a) to force the student to think, b) to require a teacher and network of contemporaries at all times, c) for brevity, and d) to hint to secondary and tertiary connotations. </p>\n\n<p>You don't need go past the very first Torah verse: \"In the beginning, G-d created heaven & earth.\" Except that's may not be what it says - it may be a reasonable way to \"connect the dots\", but it’s a way Rashi rejects. Rashi reasons that the word \"Bereishis\" means \"In the beginning OF ...\", not just \"In the beginning\", for which the word <em>BaRishonah</em> would be more appropriate. The translator is choosing the simplest meaning by adding the simplest word: In the beginning OF [the entire process of Creation]. G-d [first] created the Heaven & the Earth. Now the translator must explain why the verse didn't use the simpler <em>BaRishonah</em> or <em>BeTechilah</em>, and why Heaven seems to be created again in verses 6-8. Did we use Bereishis because it connects to other places where the concept of <em>Reishis</em> is found? Because we can assume that we'll begin our book at Creation, so we can reasonably assume your mind will append \"...Creation\" to \"beginning of...\"? Perhaps the creation of Heaven in verse 6 is an elaboration of the creation of Heaven in verse 1, or perhaps one is the creation of \"Heaven\", while the other refers to \"sky\" using the borrowed term \"<em>shamayim</em>\" to describe what we actually see when we look heavenward. Rashi (also bothered by how Heaven could be created before a primary ingredient, water, is mentioned) connects the dots by translating it as \"In the beginning OF G-d's creation of Heaven & Earth, the Earth began as emptiness & confusion, so G-d said, \"There should be Light!\"</p>\n\n<p>That’s just the first word. The Rabbis discuss why it was “created” rather than “formed”, why the name <em>Elokim</em> was used rather than Hashem, why the redundant words “et” (which leaves the literal translation as “the the heaven & the the earth”), why the word for Heaven is a pluralized form, why the G-dly name <em>Elokim</em> is pluralized in the first verse of the primary text of monotheism, etc.  (Imagine coming to an editor with a book with a confusing first sentence. “You want me to print this book?! I can’t even get past the first sentence! Either re-write it or throw it in the garbage.” Now imagine that book becoming the first book ever printed, and the best-selling book of all time!)</p>\n\n<p>The fact that this would cause disagreements was not considered a big deal. They'll either work it out, or they'll go to a higher authority for clarification, or the next generation will work it out. It's not uncommon for a question to be asked in the Talmud, a series of unsatisfactory answers given and rejected over hundreds of years, then a satisfactory answer given perhaps 300 years after the question was asked - and it is codified into law! We then consider it part of our unbroken tradition. </p>\n\n<p>\"But nobody had this tradition for all that time. Isn't that by definition 'broken'?,\" asks Annelise.  The Rabbis look at her uncomprehendingly. \"Of course not! It fits the verse perfectly, it fits the pattern of established law, and it answers the question fully. If the glove is fitted, you have acquitted!\"</p>\n\n<p>Put into the context of your question, our students have the following difficulties:</p>\n\n<p>A.  The Rabbis say on “G-d shall give beauty to Japheth, and he (alternatively, it) shall dwell in the tents of Shem” (Gen. 9:27) that in the tents of Shem, the Torah books will be written with the beautiful script of Japheth (Tal. Megillah 9b), and that this refers to “<em>Ktav Ashurit</em>” (lit., Assyrian script. Secondary connotation: Rich script) which may be used to write Torah scrolls (Meg. 18a).</p>\n\n<p>B.  Old Hebrew is very fast and easy to write, <em>Ktav Ashurit</em> slow and painstaking. Both may be used to write Torah scrolls. For fast transcription so that every student has a copy, Hebrew characters fit the bill better. For a beautiful community scroll, <em>Ashurit</em> is preferred.</p>\n\n<p>C.  In describing the <em>Luchot</em>, the Tablets of the Law, there is a clear and immediate redundancy. Exodus 32:15 says they were “written on both sides; on the one side & on the other were they written.” That violates our No Redundancy rule of the Torah. The Talmud therefore understands it as “the writing was on both sides, and the writing went through & through”. Rav Chisda then comments that this means that the center fills of the letters <em>Samech</em> & <em>Mem Sofit</em> were suspended miraculously in the <em>Luchot</em> (Shab. 104a). However, in Old Hebrew script, other letters (like <em>Daleth</em> & <em>Ayin</em>) have center fills, but <em>Samech</em> & <em>Mem Sofit</em> don’t. This statement of <em>Rav Chisda</em> would lead us to conclude that the <em>Luchot</em> were written in <em>Ashurit</em>.</p>\n\n<p>D.  Ezra clearly established that all Torah scrolls should henceforth be written in <em>Ashurit</em> (Sanhedrin 22). This connotes that previously they were written in other scripts.</p>\n\n<p>The answers mentioned by Annelise are roughly the ones the Talmud proffers in San. 22a. They are theories meant to draw clean lines through most of the sources, and push the remaining sources back into line. After discussion by the Rabbis, we seem to conclude that one fits the sources most accurately & elegantly, and that is now viewed as the accurate tradition.</p>\n\n<p>One helpful way to view this was advanced by Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch. He views the Oral tradition as being handed over complete, taught over 40-day-and-40-night marathon sessions to Moshe.  The Written Torah then has missing or extra letters, nuances of language, grammar and syntax, etc., to provide a “Map” of the Oral Law in case it needs to be reconstructed. Hence, we have the first judge, <em>Othniel ben Kenaz</em>, using <em>pilpul</em> to re-establish thousands of <em>Halachot</em> (Temurah 16a) and the measures (Yoma 80a), the prophets re-establishing the Final Letters of the Alef Bet (Shabbat 104a), or Ezra, Hillel &  Rabbi Chiya restoring “forgotten” Torah (Sukkah 20a).\nAdditionally, any major “sealing” of the Law was done by international consensus: The <em>Mishna</em> through Rabbi Judah the Prince, the <em>Talmud</em> through <em>Ravina & Rav Ashi</em>, even the <em>Tosafists</em> through <em>Rabbi Shimshon</em>, the Count of Coucy. These men of wealth and influence communicated with communities throughout the world, accepted their input, and after the issues were hashed out put an authoritative “seal” on a body of law that was then accepted by all Jewish communities around the world.</p>\n\n\n",

Philo (\"De Vita Mosis,\" iii. 6) and Josephus (\"Ant.\" iii. 7, § 7) attempted to explain the ritual symbolism of colors, but without convincing force (see, also, Baehr, \"Symbolik des Mosaischen Kultus,\" Heidelberg, 1874). The apocalyptic symbolism is admitted more generally; yet it fails when tested in detail. <strong>Literary symbolism, however, based on a psychological connection between the various color-sensations and moods of feeling, is found among most nations.

Scarlet or red is symbolical of bloodshed, of sin in general (Isa. i. 15, 18; lxiii. 1), and, in the opinion of some commentators, of vigorous life (Lev. xiv.; Num. xix.). Purple-red denotes royalty and royal splendor (Judges viii. 26; Esth. viii. 15; Dan. v. 7). Purple-blue, used for fringes in the garment of every Israelite (Num. xv. 38), is thought, on the one hand, to symbolize the high dignity of every member of the people of the covenant (compare Ex. xix. 6); and, on the other, to suggest the God of heaven (Gen. xxiv. 7; Ps. xi. 4), because of the same color as the sky.</p>\n<p>(b) Color-symbolism plays a great part in the Cabala, where to each Sefirah are attributed one or more colors; and one who wishes to energize the influence of a certain Sefirah has to contemplate, or clothe himself in, the particular color attributed to that Sefirah.

    "content": "# Why do almost all Chabad shuls always use the same tunes for certain parts of davening?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have noticed that at pretty much every Chabad shul I have ever attended, the same tunes were always used for certain parts of davening on Shabbos. For example, they all use the same tune for <em>ha-aderet v'ha-emunah</em> during <em>psukei d'zimra</em> as well as for the line in the <em>kedusha</em> for <em>musaf</em> that begins <em>hu Elokeinu, hu avinu</em>. They also all use the same tune for <em>ata bechartanu</em> during <em>yamim tovim</em>. Every Chabad shul also seems to sing <em>al tira...</em> at the end of davening, although I have noticed variations in the tune used.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the tunes<br>\n- <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/140731/jewish/Hu-Elokeinu.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hu Elokeinu</a><br>\n- <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/140688/jewish/Atoh-Bechartonu.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ata Bechartanu</a></p>\n\n<p>Is there a reason why almost every Chabad shul seems to use these tunes for these parts of davening? What is the origin of the tunes? Were they favorite <em>niggunim</em> of one of the rebbes? How long have Chabad shuls used these uniform tunes?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Hu Elokeinu and Ato Vechartonu were introduced by the Rebbe and was always song in the Rebbe's presence. \nHoaderes Vehoemuna -French National Anthem- was also introduced by the Rebbe but the other tune (the one that many Shuls use by Hakofos on Simchas Torah) was more common even during the Rebbe's presence.</p>\n\n<p>Keily Attah (end of Hallel) was composed by the Alter Rebbe (first Chabad Rebbe).</p>\n\n<p>Birkas Kohanim was composed by the Miteler Rebbe (second Chabad Rebbe)'s choir.</p>\n\n<p>There are also Rosh Hashanah & Yom Kippur songs that they will sing in all Chabad Shuls like Hayom Teamtzeinu (which the Rebbe introduced as his father's Simchas Torah Niggun), Ovinu Malkeinu (composed by the Alter Rebbe), Mar'ei Kohen (Avodah YK) is not a \"Rebbe song\" but it was the song/tune used in the Rebbe's presence, Napolean March (sung at the very end of YK) was introduced by the Alter Rebbe.\nWhat it boilsdown to is either a Niggun introduced/composed by a Rebbe or was always the exclusive tune used the Rebbe's presence.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Generally, Chabad houses try to balance two different systems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>On one hand, you want people to be able to sing along. So they try to sing \"famous\" melodies, such as \"Bei Ana Rachitz\", \"Lecha Dodi\" or \"Lechu Neranena\". </li>\n<li>Chabad houses try to follow 770's system (that's where most Shluchim spend time before/during Shlichus). They tend to sing official niggunim for certain parts of Davening. So that's the source of \"ha-aderet v'ha-emunah\", \"hu Elokeinu, hu avinu\", \"Ata Vechartanu\" etc.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Some tunes come from camps/schools, such as \"Al Tirah\"/\"Ach Tzadikim\".</p>\n\n\n",

How much?  R' Ami and R' Assi tasted up to a Revi'is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a dispute among the Rishonim of how to understand this.

Even if you put a revi'is-worth into your mouth, only the opinion which allows swallowing a small amount holds that there is a cut-off point of revi'is.</p>\n\n\n",

Not because of eiver min hachai but because of Kosher slaughter. To be considered kosher for consumption, birds must be slaughtered in the kosher manner.

When that pot is then used to cook something else, the taste that was previously absorbed in the pot is now released from the pot into the food. See <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/04-10-01/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for more background information.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is this idea exclusive to halachic circles? For example, are there chefs who will never cook one type of food in a pot that was used to cook another type of food, because the taste mixture will ruin the cooking food?  Alternatively, are there chefs who specifically choose to cook with certain pots because the flavors that have been previously absorbed in those pots enhance the food being cooked?  (I remember a TV comedy that had a similar idea.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I'm asking because I'm looking for a good analogy/example I can use to explain to non-jewish people why we need to do Hagala (purge flavor by boiling) on a non-Kosher pot before we can use it.</p>\n\n<p>As a parallel, after I read <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080719120923/http://lifestyles.cmt.com/2008-01-07/trace-adkins-heartbroken-by-daughter%E2%80%99s-food-allergy/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a>, I started using allergies as an example of why just cleaning something is not enough.

However, the story in Parshas Chukas was after 40 years of the Jews being in the desert, and had by then reached the level of a סלע. Thus, Moshe erred by treating them in a manner that was appropriate for a צור.</p>\n\n<p>See the original discourse at length, or <a href=\"http://theyeshiva.net/Article/View/159/Why-Was-Moses-Denied-The-Promised-Land\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> adapted in English by Rabbi YY Jacobson (thanks @Menachem).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39751&st=&pgnum=317\">Malbim</a> explains this as follows:</p>\n\n<p>A צור refers to a hard rock that most certainly does not contain any water within. There was no problem hitting such a rock to cause water to come out, as this was undeniably a miracle. However a סלע is a type of rock that naturally has water inside. Moshe was therefore commanded not to strike such a rock, as Hashem wanted to prove that the water came out miraculously. Hitting such a rock to produce water may not have been looked at as a miracle, and therefore Moshe was told to bring the water out through speaking to it, thereby making it clear to all that this was a miracle.</p>\n\n<p>[It's noted (see footnote 3 <a href=\"http://theyeshiva.net/Article/View/159/Why-Was-Moses-Denied-The-Promised-Land\">here</a>) that this is hinted to in the spelling of the word סלע - <em>samach</em>, <em>lamed</em> and <em>ayin</em>. When you spell out the letter <em>samach</em> fully, the middle letter will be <em>mem</em>. When you spell out the letter <em>lamed</em>, the middle letter is <em>mem</em>. Finally, when you spell out <em>ayin</em>, the middle letter is <em>yud</em>. Together they make up the word mayim - water, alluding to the fact that within a סלע is מים].</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The targum Onkelos has \"tinnara\" for \"tzur\" and \"keifa\" for \"selah\"</p>\n<p>NT Simon Peter was called so after Greek \"petra\" , but his Aramaic name was rendered in Greek as Κηφᾶς (Cephas) -- so clearly after \"selah\"</p>\n<p>You might think that this was to hint at the rock Moses should have spoken to to bring forth water, etc.</p>\n\n\n",

The synagogue had to choose between two individuals to be their cantor for high holidays.</p>\n\n<p>Mister A was a relatively traditional Jew, but he drove to synagogue on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Mister B was a Kohen who kept shabbos, kosher, you name it. Only one problem -- he fell in love with a woman who wasn't Jewish. She'd convert, but as he's a kohen he couldn't marry her any how. So he was married to a non-Jewish woman.</p>\n\n<p>If I recall correctly, Rabbi Shternbuch ruled that Mister B was preferable, with many others opining it should be Mister A. But yes, rabbis have had to deal with such questions.</p>\n\n<p>It's reasonable for a community to have standards, and if someone's public behavior makes him clearly <em>not</em> this community's \"emissary\" (which is a cantor's real job), well then so be it. But assuming your congregations doesn't particularly care, then to the best of my understanding, so long as <em>he'</em> obligated to pray, then he can pray for you too. (If I recall it's the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch who lists a whole long line of qualifications for the High Holiday cantor job. Then says -- but the only thing that's absolutely required is \"adult Jewish male.\") We can discuss what to do with a Jew who knowingly walked away from all of observance, of publicly defies its theology, or intentionally and publicly flouts the observance of shabbos (shabbos is the exception that proves the rule where public violation could put someone in a very different halachic category). But other than that? I'm not aware of a source that says he can't lead prayers.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein discusses a kosher slaughterer who, if I recall correctly, had applied for employment (or was employed?) at a heterodox synagogue that employed a microphone on shabbos.  Rabbi Feinstein ruled that the degree of public Shabbos violation was not enough to render his slaughter totally not-kosher; however we would not trust such a person's say-so that his food is kosher. Hence his actions are ritually valid, but they practically needed more oversight. Presumably the same would apply here, if the meat he slaughters (assuming we saw him do it right) is kosher, then he could pray and others could listen to fulfil their obligations.</p>\n\n\n",

If you plug that interpretation/translation back into the quotation it makes much more philosophical sense.

That which is good wants to bestow good (Ramchal). by doing His will, you are allowing Him to bestow good to you thereby fulfilling His purpose for creation.

He sees, thinks, has free will. it is just beyond us to understand Him at His level.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Although we obviously can't give Hashem anything and nothing can be added to Him, He formed a situation were we offer up to Him and serve Him. As mentioned by @ray, Rashi explains that the Nachas Ruach mentioned by the Korbanos is about the fact that He said and we listen.</p>\n\n<p>Hashem did create a universe that we can add to. This is His system and adding to it is seen and accepted as if you were giving Hashem something.</p>\n\n<p>Think of how when you feed an infant and he tries to put food in your mouth. This is a gesture that, although you don't need his (sticky) present, you accept and take pleasure in. Hashem doesn't personally change and is not personally affected by anyone. However, as with any emotion attributed to Him this can be understood as Hashem knowing, agreeing, and acting on the goodness of the deed.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, by a human as well, an emotion is a recognition of a situation. The difference is that while a human is completely taken over and changed by the situation, Hashem is not changed. But the recognition and reaction is there. This is not a Mashal. It is inherently the same thing minus being affected by it.</p>\n\n\n",

The terms <em>qadesh</em>/*qedesha* may refer to 'sacred' cultic or temple prostitution, while <em>zonah</em> and <em>kelev</em> would refer to 'secular' or everyday sex work.

He says that the problem is people committing sins and thinking that they can bribe God by bringing korbanot with their profits. Thus a prostitute would use her earnings to pay off God, and people who hunted with dangerous dogs which killed people would use their profits as an \"atonement.\" According to the Ramban, even in his day, hunters would place an image of a dog before their avodah zarah to ensure their success.

When the first fruits were about to ripen, he put two keepers in the orchard to keep out birds and thieves. One of the keepers was blind, the other was lame. After a time, the lame man said to the blind man, \"I see some juicy figs just ripe for eating.\" Said the blind man, \"Lead me to them, and we will eat.\" The lame man said, \"I cannot walk.\" The blind man said, \"I cannot see.\" Then the lame man got on the shoulders of the blind man, and they went and ate the figs, and returned to their places. Later the king came to the orchard, and asked, \"Where are my figs?\" The blind man said, \"Can I see?\" and the lame man said, \"Can I walk?\" But the king was clever. He placed the lame man on the shoulders of the blind man and made them walk. \"This is how you did it,\" the king said.</p>\n<p>So, in the World to Come, G-d says to the soul, \"Why have you sinned?\" The soul replies, \"How could I have sinned? The body sinned. Since I left the body, I have flown about like an innocent bird in the air. What is my sin?\" Then G-d says to the body, \"Why have you sinned?\" and the body replies, \"I have not sinned; it is the soul which has sinned. Since the soul left me, I lie still, like a stone on the ground. How could I have sinned?\" So what does G-d do?

I personally asked such a question when it was extremely uncomfortable for my wife to go. The Rav told me <strong>that if I have a boy and a girl already and I agree</strong> then she may delay.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are four nested questions.  I do not addressed here the issue of  the mitsva to fruitful and multiply:<br>\n1. Is there a mitsva for a woman to go to the mikveh when she is prohibited to her husband because of uncleanness or to get out of the problem of conjugal prohibition?<br>\n2. If the answer is yes,  is there  a mitsva to go to the mikveh immediately after the shiv'a nekiim,  even independently of the presence of the husband,  or independent of the opportunity to make the mitsva?<br>\n3. Is there a mitsva of marital relatioship at the night of the mikveh?<br>\n4. If the answer is yes  We know a mitsva called mitsvat ona,  a duty of the husband towards his wife,  to ensure periodic marital relationships. Is the leil tevila, a greater mitsva? E. g. is leil tevila a duty even when mitsvst ona is skipped e. g. avelut or tish'a beav, to make the mitsva at the night of mikveh remains a duty? In other words is this mitsva greater than mitsvat ona?</p>\n\n<p>a.  For the first question Rashi in Betsa 18b understood from the Gemara that there is a mitsva,  and not all prohibitions can postpone the mitsva. Chatam Sofer argued that nowadays the Tevila is already postponed because of the stringencies linked to Safek Zava and we cannot avoid to postpone the Tevila even because of rabbinical prohibitions. Bet Yosef follows the rule of the Gemara for several cases even nowadays.  See further explanation of the Bet Yosef. </p>\n\n<p>b. For the second question which is addressed in Gemara Nidda 31a, the conclusion of the Gemara according to Rishonim is that there's a such mitsva when we know exactly the right time of Tevila. But some Rishonim, e. g.  argued that nowadays the right time is an uncertainty. So, according to them,  no mitsva of \"Tevila at right time\".  But the Bet Yosef (YD 197) argued that even nowadays we have a right time following the last halachic rules,  the time is clearly after 7 clean fays,  even when the woman did seen only a little drop of blood. Magen Avraham (OC 574, sk 5),  Sidre Tahara (YD 184 sk 14) and Chatam Sofer (Shut  YD 170 and 194) disagreed to the Bet Yosef view. </p>\n\n<p>c.  For the third question Rashi Berachot 24a learned from the Gemara that yes. Leil tevila is leil tashmish. </p>\n\n<p>d.  For the fourth question,  Rashi understood from the Gemara in Berachot 24b that there is a special mitsva of relationship at Tevila night.  Acharonim discussed if this duty is stronger than the mitsva of Ona.  Sidre Tahara and Chatam Sofer said that it's not stronger and Bet Yosef did seen it as stronger than ona, as night before travel is.  Chatam Sofer and ST argued even against the status of night before travel. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion LeHalacha velo Lemaasse. Following  CS (reported in pitche teshuva YD 197) and SD,  the Tevila can be  delayed and according to the Bet Yosef no Tevila and no mitsva can be delayed. </p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://stackedit.io/viewer#!provider=gist&gistId=862f3a1b185e1d26fabc20e788f7fb82&filename=delaying_mikveh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">THE COMPREHENSIVE VERSION OF THE ANSWER</a>  for details </p>\n\n\n",

You can still see a remnant of this in the \"Krovetz L'Purim\" which is said in Shmoneh Esreh on Purim. The \"Krovetz\" is divided into 18 sections to correspond to both 18 words in a certain verse in Esther, and the 18 blessing in Shmoneh Esreh. In order to keep the number of sections to 18, one section corresponds to both \"Tzemach David\" and \"L'Yerushalayim\". See Yaakov Emden's siddur for more information.</p>\n\n<p>Both the Talmud and the midrash Shocher Tov show a correspondence of the 18 blessings with the 18 occurences of God's name in Psalm 29.

    "title": "Appointing women as representatives of the congregation",
    "content": "# Appointing women as representatives of the congregation\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a principle recorded in the Mishna, Rosh haShana 3:8, to the effect that a person can only vicariously exempt others from their responsibilities if he shares the same responsibilities that they do. The mishna's language is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זה הכלל: כל שאינו מחֻיּב בדבר אינו מוציא את הרבים ידי חובתן</p>\n  \n  <p>This is the principle: one who is not obligated in a matter may not\n  exempt others from their obligations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a result of this principle, a deaf person cannot read the megillah (Megillah 2:4) and a woman, a slave and a minor may not recite Hallel on behalf of a man (Sukkah 3:10). In later halakhic literature, it is this principle that prevents a woman from leading certain parts of the tefillah¹.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>¹ For examples, see Barry Freundel, \"<em>Kabbalat Shabbat</em>: Recited by\n  the Community; But is It Communal?\". Pages 35-51 of <em>Tradition</em> 44:2\n  (Summer 2011), 45-46.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, however, there is a principle recorded in the Mishna, Berakhot 5:5, to the effect that a person's emissary is an extension of himself (שלוחו של אדם כמותו). It is this principle that enables a man to have another give his wife a <em>get</em> on his behalf (Gittin 1:6, 6:7, etc), that enables a woman to be represented by another at her own wedding (Qiddushin 2:1), and that enables somebody to hire another person to separate his tithes for him (Terumot 4:4).</p>\n\n<p>Who can be one's emissary? The Rambam (Hilkhot Ishut 3:17) has the following to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הכל כשרין לשליחות חוץ מחרש שוטה וקטן לפי שאינן בני דעת והגוי לפי שאינו\n  בן ברית... אבל העבד אע\"פ שהוא נעשה שליח לדבר שבממון הרי הוא פסול\n  לשליחות הקידושין והגיטין לפי שאינו בתורת גיטין וקידושין</p>\n  \n  <p>All are able to serve as representatives except the deaf-mute, the\n  fool and the minor, since they have no sense, and the gentile, since\n  he is not part of the covenant... but the slave, although he may serve\n  as a representative in monetary matters, is exempt from serving as a\n  representative in marriage and divorce since he is not within the\n  scope of marriage and divorce legislation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, so long as one's representative is a full Jew (one for whom God's covenant with Israel and the relevant area of legislation both apply), it appears not to matter whether or not they share the same specific <em>level</em> of obligation. As such, it would seem that a woman may send a married woman to represent her at her wedding, a man may send a woman to deliver his <em>get</em>, and a landowner need not choose somebody who is him/herself liable to give tithes in order to separate his own on his behalf.</p>\n\n<p>Given the above, why is it not possible for a man to say to a woman, \"You are my representative; read Hallel on my behalf\"? Unlike what was thought at the time of the deaf-mute, and contrary to the case of the minor, women are most certainly possessed of intelligence. If the only thing preventing men from having them serve as representatives in tefillah is the fact that they lack an equal maximum obligation, why does that not prevent us in other circumstances where we choose a representative?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>By your logic, then, I could say \"please pray as my proxy\", then I can go home and sleep.</p>\n\n<p>Someone can't be your \"proxy\" -- <em>shliach</em> -- to pray for the same reason you can't be my proxy to wear tefilin or eat matza. It's a mitzvah that applies to your own body.</p>\n\n<p>I can have someone circumcise my son, slaughter my Passover sacrifice, build a protective fence around my roof, or the like, but those are all mitzvot extrinsic to my body. In all these cases, I just appoint them, then I go home and wait around, I don't need to be present.</p>\n\n<p>Prayer is \"service of the heart\", you have to do it yourself. The only alternative is to listen while someone else fulfills their obligation, at which point it's like you said it yourself.</p>\n\n<p>This distinction with regards to prayer -- having a proxy do it versus listening along -- is discussed, for instance, in responsa of the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1494&pgnum=30\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maharam Schick OC38</a>, where he attributes the discussion that proxies don't work for mitzvos pertaining to your own body to the Tosfos Rid at the beginning of Ha'Ish Mekadesh. (Which I don't have off-hand to look up.) It's common knowledge in yeshiva circles.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Re-reciting morning Berachoth\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone recites the morning Berachoth, are they also situational Berachoth that might require one to re-recite them in a certain situation?  Some are definitely regarded as situational, and some have certain properties of being situational, although they are recited even if the situation doesn't actually apply.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I've heard that it is customary on Tish'ah BeAv not to recite \"שעשה לי כל צרכי\".  Also, when a man wearing Tefilin recites \"עוטר ישראל בתפארה\", it is customary to touch the one on his head, indicating that it is regarded as our \"crown\". </p>\n\n<p>Let's say that someone is ill with a common and treatable illness, such as strep throat, and is taking the medication (in this case antibiotics).  I've never heard that someone with a treatable illness, or any other illness for that matter, should omit \"הנותן ליעף כח\".  So, assuming it's correct to recite this Berachah even when ill, this person does so in the morning as part of morning prayers.  But let's also say that this is the person's second or third day on the medication, and some time after reciting the Berachah in the morning, he really begins to recover and is starting to feel much better.  (Let's say he was feeling lousy at 7am, but he Davened, and he recited this Berachah, but then later he ate whatever small amount of food he could, he had a nap, and he ate a bit more, and began to get some real energy.  By 7pm, he's really feeling almost back to normal.)  Could he (or even should he) recite \"הנותן ליעף כח\" again?</p>\n\n<p>What about a person who wears glasses but cannot find them, or someone else steps on them before he wakes up in the morning?  Later in the day he either finds them or gets them repaired.  Surely he should not refrain from saying \"פוקח עורים\" just because he temporarily can't see.  So should he re-recite it once he can see again?</p>\n\n<p>Take the glasses example a step further.  Let's say someone has a minor eye injury or a <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/ocular-migraine-basics#1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">migraine headache that can cause sensations similar to blindness</a>, but later can see again.  Should he then re-recite the Berachah?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there is an opinion that, along with שהחיינו, a person should recite \"מלביש ערומים\" when wearing new clothes.  If there is such a requirement, does that follow even if someone has already recited this Berachah in the morning as part of the standard Davening?</p>\n\n<p>I know that one can always recite these without \"Shem UMalchuth\".  What I want to know is, is there a standard, accepted rule (even if not universally held) that one repeats the Berachah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.60b.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 60b</a>) mentions 12 such blessings to be said as part of waking up following certain actions. It repeatedly uses the phrase \"When you [Action X], say [Corresponding Blessing]\". The simplest read is that these are all situational blessings. When you open your eyes, say פוקח עורים. When you gird yourself with a belt, say אוזר ישראל בגבורה.</p>\n\n<p>The custom to recite these blessings all together after finishing the whole process is post-Talmudic, but still quite old. <strong>Rambam</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/920169/jewish/Tefilah-and-Birkat-Kohanim-Chapter-Seven.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tefilla 7:9</a>, see the preceding parts too) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נהגו העם ברוב ערינו, לברך ברכות אלו כולן זו אחר זו בבית הכנסת, בין נתחייבו בהן, בין לא נתחייבו בהן. וטעות היא בידם, ואין ראוי לעשות כן. ולא יברך אדם ברכה, אלא אם כן נתחייב בה<br>\n  The people in most of our cities are accustomed to make all these blessings one after another in the synagogue whether they are obligated in them or not. And this is a mistake and it should not be done. One should not say any of the blessings unless he is obligated in it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Tosfot</strong> (sv \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.60b.5?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Berakhot.60b.5&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ki Paris</a>\") on the relevant gemara says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודוקא כשנהנה אבל אם אינו נהנה כגון שהוא שוכב על מטתו לא יברך לא זו ולא מלביש ערומים ולא ברכות כיוצא בהן כיון שלא נהנה<br>\n  Specifically one who received the benefit [may bless], but if he didn't receive the benefit, such as one who still lies in bed, he should not bless neither [עוטר ישראל בתפארה] nor מלביש ערומים nor the others since he didn't receive the benefit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, others such as the <strong>Ran</strong> (Pesachim 4a quoting Ramban) and <strong>Kol Bo</strong> (Siman 1 in the name of multiple Geonim) claim that the blessings are on the \"way of the world\" and not just the personal benefit of the one saying the blessing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Shulchan Aruch</strong> comes out split about this (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=148\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 46:8</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל הברכות האלו אם לא נתחייב באחת מהן, כגון שלא שמע קול תרנגול או שלא הלך או לא לבש או לא חגר, אומר אותה ברכה בלא הזכרת השם. הגה: וי\"א דאפילו  לא נתחייב בהן מברך אותן, דאין הברכה דוקא על עצמו אלא מברכין שהקב\"ה ברא צרכי העולם. וכן המנהג, ואין לשנות.‏<br>\n  All these blessings, if you did not become obligated in them, such as you didn't hear the voice of a rooster or you didn't walk or don [clothing] or gird [a belt], you say that blessing without mentioning God's name. GLOSS: And some say that even if you didn't become obligated in that blessing you say the blessing because the blessing is not on himself, rather we bless that God created the needs of the world. And such is the custom and it should not be changed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus in most of your cases, if he held like the Rama he should have said it in the morning and not repeat it later. If he held like the Shulchan Aruch he should only say the blessing when he gets the requisite benefit.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The issue with Tisha bAv and Yom Kippur is that on those days, no one wears leather shoes or washes, so perhaps it is not considered the \"way of the world\" on those days (see Tur OC 613 to start).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the Tefillin, connecting the Tefillah shel Rosh to the blessing of 'Oteir Yisrael is a personal custom of the Rosh noted by his son in Tur OC 25. I don't get the sense anyone thought it was more than just a nice idea.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, saying Malbish Arumim on new clothing is a separate obligation based in Yerushalmi Brachot 9:3 and recorded in Shulchan Aruch OC 224:4. The Mishna Berura there notes that if you put on the new clothing in the morning you can use your morning blessing to exempt the blessing on the new clothing. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (59:8) reports that \"some say\" (I don't know who) that just like a new piece of clothing gets a new Malbish Arumim, so too a new belt and a new hat get new Ozer Yisrael and 'Oter Yisrael respectively; however, he says that since some argue on this, one should wear new belts and hats in the morning to use the morning blessing on them.</p>\n\n\n",

He derives this from Bamidbar 6:3, which says both \"wine\" and \"strong drink,\" which he finds repetitious (as wine <em>is</em> a strong drink). He therefore learns that the repetition is \"to make wine for a Mitzvah like optional wine.\" So, no, a Nazir would not be able to have four cups of wine. He would be able to have four cups of a <em>chamar medinah</em>, though, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/8149/9682\">as Alex noted in this question that asks specifically about Arba Kosos.</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>the Nazir may not drink wine, because he is observing the commandments of the Torah, De Orayata.

What are the sources for this Pesak and why is this so?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/displayRead.asp?readID=932&txtSearch=soap%20bar\" rel=\"nofollow\">My LOR</a> says Yesh Al Mi Lismoch but I would like to see a nice treatment of the Sugya.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cckollel.org/parsha_encounters/5770/noach_70.pdf\">Chicago Community Kollel Parsha Encounters Oct 23, 2009</a> discusses the issues with bar soap. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rama (326:10) writes that it is forbidden to wash one's hands with\n  soap on Shabbos. Three reasons are given for this prohibition. The\n  Rama explains that using soap on Shabbos causes it to turn into\n  liquid, which is a violation of Nolad (creating a new entity).</p>\n  \n  <p>This reason is not accepted by the Magen Avraham (brought in Mishna\n  Berura 326:30). He argues that the main purpose of soap is not to\n  serve as a liquid, and therefore, the prohibition of Nolad is not\n  relevant to soap.</p>\n  \n  <p>A second reason for the prohibition, mentioned by the Mishna Berura\n  ibid., is that using soap is in violation of Mimarayach (smearing).\n  Many Poskim argue that this reason only applies to soap used in\n  previous generations, which was rough and needed to be smoothed. This\n  would not apply to bar soap used in modern times, which is quiet\n  smooth. (Some brands of bar soap have pointy edges; perhaps smoothing\n  those edges is in violation of Mimarayach. Additionally, if a bar of\n  soap remains in water for some time, it can become pasty and soft. If\n  one wipes off the soft part in order to smooth out the bar, he may\n  have violated the prohibition of Mimarayach.)</p>\n  \n  <p>A third reason quoted by the Mishna Berura, is that soap may be so\n  abrasive that it will pull out hair on Shabbos. This reason, too, does\n  not apply to modern soap.</p>\n  \n  <p>In conclusion, there is a universal custom to avoid using bar soap on\n  Shabbos. Although the rationale behind this custom may be unclear, we\n  dare not tamper with this custom (Mishna Berura 326:30, Aruch Hashulchan 326:11,\n  Shmiras Shabbos Khilchasa 14:16, Ben Ish Chai II Yisro 15, Kitzur\n  Hilchos Shabbos 32:4). However in extenuating circumstances one may\n  wash his hands using bar soap. It is preferable, however, to use the\n  soap under running water (Shmiras Shabbos Khilchasa 40:11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I'm not sure what he's referring to, but my guess is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.21.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabbah 21:4</a>, which says similar to the Sifrei we started with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן אוֹמֵר מִנַּיִן שֶׁהַמַּחְטִיא אֶת הָאָדָם יוֹתֵר מִן הַהוֹרְגוֹ, שֶׁהַהוֹרֵג הוֹרֵג בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה, וְיֵשׁ לוֹ חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא, וְהַמַּחְטִיא הוֹרְגוֹ בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה וּבָעוֹלָם הַבָּא. שְׁתֵּי אֻמּוֹת קִדְמוּ אֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּחֶרֶב, וּשְׁתַּיִם בַּעֲבֵרָה, הַמִּצְרִים וַאֲדוֹמִים קִדְּמוּ בְּחֶרֶב...וּשְׁתַּיִם בַּעֲבֵרָה, מוֹאָבִים וְעַמּוֹנִים, עַל אֵלֶּה שֶׁקִּדְּמוּ בְּחֶרֶב, כְּתִיב (דברים כג, ח): לֹא תְתַעֵב אֲדֹמִי, לֹא תְתַעֵב מִצְרִי, אֲבָל אֵלּוּ שֶׁקִּדְּמוּ בַּעֲבֵרָה לְהַחְטִיא אֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל (דברים כג, ד): לֹא יָבֹא עַמּוֹנִי וּמוֹאָבִי, גַּם דּוֹר עֲשִׂירִי, עַד עוֹלָם.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the words ושתים בעברה מואבים ועמונים, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.21.4?lang=bi&p2=Etz_Yosef_on_Bamidbar_Rabbah.21.4.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Eitz Yosef</strong></a> cites the Sifrei in <em>parshas Pinchas</em> that the Netziv brought, and points out that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.106a.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 106a</a>, which describes Bilam's plan, involved Ammonite wine.

Basically what the Netziv wrote.</p>\n<p>Radal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ראיתי כתוב שהוא כמ\"ש בספרי בלק שעמונים ומואבים יחד היו בעצת בלעם (ואפשר רמיזא בקרא (שופטים י) שאמר יפתח למלך בני עמון הטוב כו' מבלק בן צפור מלך מואב הרב רב את כו'. לומר שעמון היה אז ג\"כ בעצה אחת עם בלק ובלעם) ובסנהדרין (קו.) אמרו וצרצור יין העמוני מונח כו'. ומפני שמואב ועמון נולדו ע\"י זנות ויין לכן הכשילו לישראל ע\"י שניהם. ומואב שהיתה פרוצה ביותר שהתחילה בעבירה ונראה בלשון מגונה לכן היו מעשיהם בעיקר העברה בזנות. ועמון רק ביין.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Besides citing the Sifrei in <em>parshas Balak</em>, he says that perhaps this idea is alluded to in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.11.25?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 11:25</a>. Yiftach sent a message to the King of Ammon, and says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעַתָּ֗ה הֲט֥וֹב טוֹב֙ אַתָּ֔ה מִבָּלָ֥ק בֶּן־צִפּ֖וֹר מֶ֣לֶךְ מוֹאָ֑ב הֲר֥וֹב רָב֙ עִם־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אִם־נִלְחֹ֥ם נִלְחַ֖ם בָּֽם׃</p>\n<p>“Besides, are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he start a quarrel with Israel or go to war with them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then cites the <em>gemarra</em> in Sanhedrin. He finishes by saying that since the ancestors of the nations of Ammon and Moav were conceived through immoral relations and wine, therefore they chose to cause the Jews to stumble in these two things. Since Moav was the more immoral of the two, as evident by their name, they focused on the immoral relations. Ammon therefore focused on the wine.</p>\n\n\n",

Rama (as understood by Aruch haShulchan :21) there writes that the reason a Kohein can get Maftir generally is due to the previous reader's being a Yisrael. In the case of Maftir Yonah, the previous reader can't be a Yisrael (again, assuming the minyan is populated with a variety of lineages) so the Maftir cannot be a Kohein, even according to those who permit later Aliyot to be received by Kohanim when preceded by Yisraelim.

Even if the person genuinely has a desire to learn about Judaism and worship Hashem? What are the rights (if any) of a gentile/Noahide or prospective convert with regards to shul access?

Since prayer is, at least in part, a substitution for the korbans, why would a non-Jew not be allowed to pray in a synagogue. Of course there are many practical reasons why they should not be allowed into a synagogue for prayer but the question above assumes a non-Jew who is sincere about learning about Judaism for positive reasons such as converting.</p>\n\n<p>Full disclosure: I am a volunteer member of my very well known Modern Orthodox synagogues Shabbat/Yom Tov security team. A person who is \"obviously\" not Jewish would not likely gain entry into the building but would certainly be encouraged to contact the office via phone during the work week and ask to speak with the rabbi. My previous synagogue actually allowed a technically non-Jewish man pray. He wanted to honor his Jewish father by reciting Kaddish. The man was in attendance seven days a week saying Kaddish and davening. Our Hasidish rabbi allowed him to prayer. The man was not however counted as part of the minyan. </p>\n\n\n",

There are many divrei Chazal that tackle how to attain spiritual greatness let alone whole sefarim on the issue (Chovot Halevavot, Mesilat Yesharim, etc.). The Rambam in Hilchot De'ot brings down dietary laws pertaining to health and goes as far as recommending and discouraging different foods.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from over indulgence in physicality ('Achilat Gasa') are there any sources which speak about how to positively approach something like exercise as a means to improve physical well being and health?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I see that <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/1028\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ohr Somayach</a> was asked the question and replied quoting the Rambam.\nIn particular it says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Regarding what type and how much exercise one needs, the Torah\n  approach is to rely on the advice of the experts. The Rambam defined\n  exercise as \"vigorous or gentle movement, or a combination of the two,\n  which increases one’s breathing rate.\" Interestingly, this is exactly\n  the type of cardiovascular exercise advised by modern medicine like\n  walking, jogging, dancing, biking, or swimming for 30 minutes at least\n  three times a week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An \"even more important way of guarding our health\" is: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Keeping the mitzvot (which) brings the body in healthy balance with the\n  spiritual energy of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mesora.org/exercise.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mesora.org</a> has a similar approach but says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Maintaining one’s body is clearly a most important means towards\n  spiritual perfection; therefore, one must never be too focused on the\n  means, and lose sight of his true goals. The lion’s share of one’s\n  activities must certainly be in the spiritual arena – Talmud Torah,\n  Chessed, characteristic refinement, etc. – while the Guf is maintained\n  as a Kli, a vessel, which is essential for his pursuit of\n  spirituality. Obviously, one with this goal would spend much more time\n  and energy on the latter. Even when spending time on the Guf, one may\n  try to be involved in the spiritual, such as exercising while\n  listening to a Shiur, riding a stationary bike while reading a Saifer,\n  etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'm not sure of any sources, but here is my view of it: positively approaching exercise means undertaking physical activity such as muscle toning and building strength in order to improve your life. You are required to take care of yourself and your body. You're required to take care of your life, <em>period</em>. For example, if you have a medical emergency, you are required to break Shabbat in order to save your life.  </p>\n\n<p>If you notice a difference in how you feel, i.e, you're more energetic after exercise, your posture has improved, or perhaps back pain has decreased from the new muscle strength you've acquired, then that is positive. For example, your back pain has decreased and posture has improved because you started exercising, and now you have better posture and can sit studying Torah longer, why would that be a bad thing? In this sense exercise is good.  </p>\n\n<p>Not everyone is given perfect health, and achieving benefits from exercise that would help you focus on other more important things (such as Torah), is definitely positive, and is just one of the many challenges in life.</p>\n\n\n",

My source for that is <em>HaMeor HaGadol</em> (המאור הגדול: הגאון החסיד מווילנא זללה\"ה), published in two volumes by יששכר דוב קרויזר (Makhon Moreshet haGra: Jerusalem, 2004).</p>\n\n<p>In volume 1, the second comment appended to Deuteronomy 25:15 reads as follows (this is a direct quote from R' Shmuel ben Avraham's sefer):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושמעתי מפי הרה\"ג הישיש וכו' מו\"ה יצחק מרגליות, אב\"ד בשצוצין במדינת\n  פולין, ששמע מפי מאור הגולה מהר\"ח מוואלזין ז\"ל, כי הגר\"א ז\"ל אמר, כי\n  בספר 'משנה תורה' מרומז בכל סדרה מה שיארע במאה שנים מאלף השישי, כסדר\n  יו\"ד פרשיות נגד יו\"ד מאות, כי \"נצבים וילך\" נחשבים לאחד כידוע</p>\n  \n  <p>ושאל לו מהר\"ח: איה איפה אנו מרומזים בפרשת 'כי תצא', שהוא נגד המאה\n  הששית שאנחנו עומדים כעת. והשיב לו, כי שמו מרומז בתיבת \"אבן שלמה\" כנ\"ל,\n  ושם מהר\"ח נעלם ממנו. (לא פורש אם הגר\"א העלים ממהר\"ח, או מהר\"ח העלים\n  מהשומעים מפני רוב ענותנותו. ולפי זה דעה לנבון נקל, כי הרעות רבות וצרות\n  אשר השיגונו בעו\"ה במאה השביעית הזאת, מרומזים בקללות שבפרשת 'כי תבא'\n  ודו\"ק), ועתה נצפה לגאולה העתידה במהרה בימימנו אמן</p>\n  \n  <p>I heard from R' Yitzhak Margoliot, the av beit din of Szczecin, who\n  heard it from R' Hayyim of Volozhin, that the Gra said that the book\n  of Deuteronomy alludes in each parsha to what will occur in each\n  century of the sixth millennium, for the ten parshas correspond to the\n  ten centuries (Nitzavim and Vayyelekh being considered as one, as is\n  known).</p>\n  \n  <p>R' Hayyim asked him where, therefore, the two of them were alluded to\n  in Parshat Ki Teitze, which corresponds to the sixth century, in which\n  they were currently situated. [<em>The Gra was born about 5480. This conversation took place during the sixth century of the sixth millennium - ie: after 5500</em>]. He answered him that his own name was\n  alluded to in the words \"אבן שלמה\" [ie: אליהו בן שלמה זלמן],\n  but the name of R' Hayyim was hidden from him. (He did not clarify\n  whether the Gra hid it from R' Hayyim or R' Hayyim hid it from those\n  listening, due to his tremendous humility. But because of this, wisdom\n  comes easily to the discerning, that the great and vexatious evils\n  that overtook us in this world, in this seventh century, were alluded\n  to in the curses of Parshat Ki Tavo), and now we anticipate the future\n  redemption, speedily and in our days. Amen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I do not know to which events R' Shmuel ben Avraham is alluding, since for them to take place within the seventh century and to precede the publication of his text they would need to transpire between 1840 and 1864. It may have been the second of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_pogroms\" rel=\"nofollow\">Odessa pogroms</a> in 1859 that he had in mind. In any case, if we were to utilise the same schema, only the first six years of the Shoah (1933-1939, or 5693-5699) would correspond to Ki Tavo. The events of 1940-1945 (5670-5675) would correspond to Parshat Nitzavim/Vayyelekh instead.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking for myself, I have not heard this particular idea before anyway, and I wonder if it might be possible that you are confusing Parshat Ki Tavo with Parshat Bechukotai? If so, the source for your idea may be what R' Meir Simcha of Dvinsk says in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Meshech_Hochma,_Bekhukotai.11/he/Riga,_1927?qh=%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9F%2B%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D&lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meshekh Chokhma, on Leviticus 26:44</a>. It's too lengthy to quote in full, but he speaks of the nature of the exile as being one in which people become accustomed to where they are, as a result of which God causes a great storm to come and violently uproot them, reminding them all that they are Jews.</p>\n\n<p>A little way into this discussion, he relates these warnings specifically to those Jews who desist from learning their laws, who learn languages not their own, who engage in ways of destruction and not in ways of reparation, and who consider Berlin to be Jerusalem (יחשוב כי ברלין היא ירושלים). He then promises another storm of terrible proportions, which you can read inside for yourself.</p>\n\n\n",

The same is those from Chutz L'Aretz that are in Eretz Yisrael (they also keep Friday as 2nd day yom tov.) Such a person needs to make an Eiruv Tavshilin in order to cook on Yom Tov for Shabbos. In a normal case if one was not made, the Rov of the city usually makes one that people can rely on in particular situations. In this case however there is no \"rov\" making one since it's in Eretz Yisrael. But let's say a rov did make an \"eiruv tavshilin\" would this help in order for the person to cook? What about if the rov made it before yom tov? What about if the rov made it on Friday and had in mind that it should work for this person?

    "content": "# Why does the Mishna misquote the Tanakh?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a number of instances, the Mishna provides quotes from Tanakh that differ from the versions of Tanakh that we have today. So, for example, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=31b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sotah 6:4 (31b)</a>. There, the mishna quotes <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9983#v=15\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 19:15</a> as saying \"על פי שנים עדים\", but the Masoretic Text reads \"שני\" instead of \"שנים\". Similarly, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=32&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sotah 7:5 (32a)</a> quotes <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15792#v=23\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Joshua 8:23</a> as saying \"וכל ישראל וזקיניו ושטריו\", while the Masoretic Text renders the fourth word as ושוטרים (without the suffix). I have seen other examples of this phenomenon elsewhere and, while they're not significant differences, I wonder why the text of the Mishna was never updated to reflect the precise phraseology of scripture?</p>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>[With many thanks to @DoubleAA, if you consult <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=55b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbat 55b</a> you can see where Tosafot also comment upon this phenomenon (s.v. מעבירים כתיב) and, in Gilyon haShas, R' Akiva Eger brings an impressively exhaustive list of other instances in which this phenomenon also occurs: passages in the Bavli, the Yerushalmi, midrashim and mefarshim on Chumash. He also refers to another Tosafot (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=37&daf=33&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Niddah 33a</a>, s.v. והנושא) that makes reference to this issue, though without offering an explanation for it.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I would offer three answers, which I believe may be true simultaneously.</p>\n<h1>1</h1>\n<p>While scribes were extremely careful for pesukim in Tanach, so as not to invalidate the kosher status of the sefer, they were not so careful when quoting pesukim when they occurred within the Gemara.</p>\n<p>Add to that that sometimes earlier manuscripts will shorten words or phrases with apostrophes -- e.g., they might write ושוטר or ושוטרי followed by an apostrophe, and a later scribe could expand it into what he believed was the full quote, working from memory because he did not have the quote before him.</p>\n<p>In the two cases given in the question, this sort of accidental expansion seems likely. שני could be expanded accidentally into שנים. And in Yehoshua the words are וכל ישראל וזקיניו ושטרים ושפטיו, when shortened and then expanded, would have ושטרים naturally expanded to the יו ending, based on context. Lectio difficilior and all that.</p>\n<h1>2</h1>\n<p>I heard in Rav Schachter's shiur, I forget citing whom, that Chazal deliberately messed up the quotations. After all, one should not be citing a pasuk, from the Written Law, orally. Therefore, they changed the pesukim in ways that would not damage the derasha.</p>\n<h1>3</h1>\n<p>This however does not work for the many instances in which the derasha is made based on a feature of the changed text. For example, Chazal darshen the chaser / malei status of Totafot against what is our current masoretic spelling.</p>\n<p>This seems to indicate that, at least in those instances, and possibly in others, they are working from a different, parallel masorah.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/books/djvu/2093934-1/index.djvu?djvuopts&thumbnails=yes&zoom=page&page=219\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vetus Testamentum</a> for the two examples in the question, has the same as our own Masoretic text, but cites other Hebrew texts, meaning from Jews rather than Samaritans, that in fact have these variants.)</p>\n<p>I have myself investigated many of these instances of changed wording and discovered that Chazal's derasha accords with an ancient text we can actually find, namely in the Samaritan Pentateuch. That means that whoever made the derasha had a different text in his sefer Torah, from which he darshened.</p>\n<p>For example, I posted about <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.co.il/2010/03/did-they-donate-four-or-five-types-of.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a Midrash Rabba</a> that assumes the Samaritan text, and causes confusion among the commentators of Midrash Rabba. And in another, I show that <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.co.il/2010/04/do-chazal-darshen-samaritan-version-of.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">rather than following the Gra's emendation of a quote of a pasuk in a gemara</a>, we can see that they are actually darshening the Samaritan text. And in another, I show how the <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.co.il/2010/04/some-thoughts-on-chacham.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">famous question on the Haggadah</a> about how the Chacham can say אתכם and not be wicked is based on our Masoretic text, but in old Haggadahs and in the Mechilta, the Chacham repeats the pasuk but says Otanu, in line with e.g. the Septuagint:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PBjgH.jpg\" alt=\"(picture of what appears to be an excerpt of an old haggadah, with \"Otanu\" instead of \"Etchem\" in the Chacham's words)\" /></p>\n\n\n",

A person agreed to harvest standing grain for two Selaim. He harvested half of the grain, but left half unharvested. Similarly, a person agreed to weave a garment for two Selaim. He wove half of the garment, but left half unwoven. If the remainder would cost six Dinarim to complete, the original contractor is paid a shekel or he is given the option of completing his work. If the remainder was worth only two Dinarim, the owner need not pay the contractor more than a Sela, because he did not perform more than half the work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יא  במה דברים אמורים, בדבר שאינו אבוד.  אבל בדבר האבוד--כגון פשתנו לעלות מן המשרה, או ששכר חמור להביא חלילין למת או לכלה וכל כיוצא בהן--אחד פועל ואחד קבלן, אינו יכול לחזור בו אלא אם כן נאנס, כגון שחלה, או שמע שמת לו מת.  ואם לא נאנס, וחזר בו--שוכר עליהן או מטען.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When does the above apply? With regard to work that does not involve an immediate loss.</p>\n\n<p>If, however, the work involves an immediate loss - e.g., he hired the workers to remove flax from the vat, or he hired a donkey to bring flutes for a funeral or for a wedding or the like - neither a worker nor a contractor may retract unless he is held back by forces beyond his control -e.g., he became ill or a close relative died. </p>\n\n<p>If the worker is not held back by forces beyond his control, and he retracts, the owner may hire others on their account or deceive them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יב  כיצד מטען:  אומר להם סלע קצצתי לכם, בואו וטלו שתיים, עד שיגמרו מלאכתן; ולא ייתן להם אלא מה שפסק תחילה.  ואפילו נתן להם השתיים, מחזיר מהן התוספת.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is meant by deceiving them? He tells them: \"I agreed to pay you a Sela; take two so that you will complete your work.\" Afterwards, he is not required to give them anything more than he originally agreed. Moreover, even if he gave them two, he can compel them to return the additional amount.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יג  כיצד שוכר עליהן:  שוכר פועלים אחרים, וגומרים מלאכתן שלא תאבד; וכל שיוסיף לאלו הפועלין האחרים על מה שפסק לראשונים, נוטל מן הראשונים.  ועד כמה, עד כדי שכרן של ראשונים.  ואם היה להם ממון תחת ידו--שוכר להשלים המלאכה עד ארבעים חמישים זוז בכל יום לכל פועל, אף על פי ששכר הפועל שלוש או ארבע.  במה דברים אמורים, בזמן שאין שם פועלים לשכור בשכרן להשלים המלאכה.  אבל אם יש שם פועלים לשכור בשכרן, ואמרו לו צא ושכור מאלו והשלם מלאכתך ולא תאבד--בין שוכר בין קבלן--אין לו עליהן אלא תרעומת; ושמין לשוכר מה שעשה, ולקבלן מה שעתיד לעשות.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is meant by hiring others on their account? He hires other workers who complete their task so that he will not suffer a loss. Whatever he must add to pay these later workers beyond the amount the first workers agreed upon, he may take from the first workers.</p>\n\n<p>To what extent are the first workers responsible? For their entire wage.

Yet immediately after Yom Kippur is over we pray Maariv which starts with \"Vehu Rachum Yechaper Avon\". Then by Shemona Esrei we say Selach Lanu. Who had a chance to do a sin that we are saying this? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I heard this from the rabbi of my shul in the name of a Chassidic rebbe (I don't remember which one). The <em>pasuk</em> in <em>Tehillim</em> before <em>vehu rachum</em> (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2678.htm#37\" rel=\"noreferrer\">78:37</a>) says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְלִבָּם, לֹא-נָכוֹן עִמּוֹ;    וְלֹא נֶאֶמְנוּ, בִּבְרִיתוֹ</p>\n<p>For their heart was not stedfast with Him, neither were they faithful in His covenant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the reason that we say <em>vehu rachum</em> is to ask Hashem for forgiveness if we said anything during Yom Kippur davening while asking for forgiveness which we did not really believe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I also have my own idea about why we say <em>vehu rachum</em> after Yom Kippur. Sure we have just completed a day of intense prayer and fasting. We feel like we're on top of the world because we know that we have been forgiven. All through the day, we have committed ourselves to improving ourselves.  Now that the day is over, though, we're going down to break our fast and indulge in our regular, every-day <em>gashmius</em>.</p>\n<p>We return to regular life. We'd be fooling ourselves if we thought that we had reached the point where we will never sin again. We cannot remain on the level of Yom Kippur for ever. It is simply not possible for humans. We are imperfect, and as Yom Kippur ends, we acknowledge our imprefection by admitting that, although we will try as hard as we can not to, we will continue to sin. And so we ask God for forgiveness for the sins that will inevitably come.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>1 - By the Slonimer Chasidim they actually do not say Vehu Rachum on Motzei Yom Kippur, they go directly to Barchu.</p>\n\n<p>2- Sins that are between man and his friends are not forgiven unless we have asked for forgiveness from the one wronged even on Yom Kippur. </p>\n\n<p>3 - I have heard in the name of Harav Shach Zatzal that when asked this question once Motzei Yom Kippur he responded (\"Of Dem Vos Men Tracht Farvus Iz Du Aveiras Motzei Yom Kippur, Oif Dus Alain Darf Men Nuch Ah Kapara\") Just for thinkink why there is sins after Yom Kippur, for this alone you need forgiveness. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Selach Lanu that our Teshuva wasnt sincere and now that Yom Kipur is over, we plan to go back yo our old ways.</p>\n\n\n",

But it seems to me – please let me know if I am mistaken – that at least Rosh Hashana is relevant to the whole world and perhaps I should mark it in some way. And finally, I would like to know if there are particular prayers from the Siddur that are permissible for the Noahide to pray.</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Israel Chait:</strong></p>\n<p>The Noachide should know that he too is judged on Rosh Hashanna by God just as the Jew and the rest of mankind. He therefore should pray all the prayers that the Jew prays, as he too is loved by God and through his repentance and prayer will be received by God and inscribed for a good year. Of course he must make some minor adjustments so that the prayer makes sense. For instance, instead of saying \"our God and the God of our fathers\", he can say \"our God and the God of our Patriarchs\" since he is not a direct descendant of the Patriarchs. But such obvious points are minor although they do require some awareness of what one is saying. But other than that technical point, all of the prayers, even the piyut (additional prayers) are applicable and beneficial to the Noachide as it is to the Jew. Indeed, the whole theme of Rosh Hashanna is that there is one Creator of the universe and all God's creatures should recognize Him. What then can be more correct before God than to have the Ben Noach recognize Him and pray to Him on this day? Indeed the Ben Noach is in a very special position to do an act that has a special value, a dimension which his unique position allows him to accomplish, which the Jew cannot. As it says in the prayers, \"Let all those who dwell on the Earth recognize and know that [only] to You shall every knee bow down...and all shall accept the yoke of Thy kingdom..and God shall be the king of the entire Earth and He and His name shall be one.\" The Ben Noach prayer has a very special place before God as part of the fulfillment of His words. May the one who asked the question be blessed with all of God's blessings for a wonderful and a spiritually fulfilling year. There is one last point. In order not to violate making a holiday for himself since he is not commanded, the Ben Noach should not treat the day as a holiday by making it festive or imposing any prohibitions on himself. ■</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Nature of rabbinic and biblical prohibitions and their subcategories\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While learning Mishna, I frequently come across distinctions between different levels of prohibitions, as well as allusions to sub-categories within those prohibitions. So, for example, there are prohibitions that require the transgressor to bring a sin offering (those that are חייב), prohibitions that do not require a sin offering (those that are פטור), as well as prohibitions that may even constitute further sub-divisions of an even gentler nature (such as the איסור שבות on Shabbat).</p>\n\n<p>What is more, the Mishna in some instances alludes to a body of theory that it does not appear to remark upon: at what stage might we decide that transgressions are heaped upon transgressions? Yevamot 3:10 speaks of a situation in which more than one sin offering might be required in a single instance, which is remarked upon by the Bartenura but which is not explicated in the mishna itself.</p>\n\n<p>Having only learnt about 50% of the Mishna, I do not yet know if there are masekhtot in the final three sedarim that are relevant to this particular issue. What I would like is a break-down of the different types of transgressions and the theory that pertains to them. When does a transgression require an offering? What type of offering is required and when? When do transgressions combine with other transgressions? What happens when transgressions of differing levels combine? And so forth...</p>\n\n<p>Are there specific masekhtot that touch upon this in such a fashion that their respective gemara and mefarshim might be of particular use to me? Or can anybody recommend a sefer in the Rambam's MT that deals with this, or even an acharon who treats of the matter in a comprehensive way? It would assist my learning of the Mishna immeasurably if there were a body of theory that I could consult here.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If you are looking for a <em>sefer</em> where one has classification of transgressions, then probably Gate 3 of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sha%27arei_Teshuvah.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaarei Teshuvah</a> by Rabbeinu Yonah would be a good entrance point. According to Rabbeinu Yonah, all transgressions need to be counted separately, as one has to make teshuvah for each and every one. When it comes to capital punishments though, the court can only convict a person for the harshest crime. Rabbeinu Yonah enumerates the following classes of transgressions based on violated prohibitions according to strictness, from lightest to severe:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Transgressions of the Rabbinic Decrees. Example: a person making a tefilin with 5 totafos</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Failue to perform Positive commandements. Examples: tzedaka, visiting sick</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transgressions of Prohibitions connected to a positive commadment does not incur flogging (Chulin 14a). Example, the prohibition to take a mother bird with her young is connected with an imperative to surely let mother go (Devarim 22:6-7).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transgression of prohibitions involving no action, also no flogging (Makkos 16A). These come in four categories:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p>prohibitions touching one's heart. Example: \"Do not test G-d your Lord\" (Devarim 6:16), \"Do not be afraid of enemy when you go out to war\" (Devarim 7: 17-18)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>prohibitions involving speech, some of which incur flogging. Examples: not to utter words of Torah in filthy places as derived from Bamidbar 15:31 in Brakhos 24B; prohibitions of <em>lashon hara</em></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>prohibitions involving sense of hearing and seeing. Example: not to stray after one's heart (Bamidbar 15:39)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>prohibitions involving withdrawal of one's hand and refraining from doing something. Example: do not withdraw your hand from your poor brother (Devarim 15:7-9)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><p>Transgressions of prohibitions involving an action. These incur flogging. Examples: do not ingest animal blood;  do not strike someone (derived from Shemos 2:13)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transgressions incurring Death through the Hands of Heaven. Examples are given in Sanhedrin 3:1, Challa 1:9 include someone stealing from poor, ruining someone's reputation, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Transgressions incurring excision (kares). If performed carelessly require korban for atonement. There are two types:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p>excision only from this world. Example: cohabit with one's sister</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>exision from both this and next world. Example: idol worship.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Four court-imposed death sentences (going down in significance)</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><p>stoning.

Both psalms include the header \"לדוד\", which many believe points to authorship by David. However, merely the header by itself is no proof that David actually wrote the psalm. First, \"לדוד\" could mean anything: \"<em>by</em> David\", \"<em>for</em> David\", \"<em>about</em> David\", or even \"<em>in the style of</em> David\". Second, we do not know who appended the headers onto the psalms and whether or not they knew or had a tradition regarding the authorship of the individual psalms.

Now the game becomes to figure out which is more \"original\".</li>\n<li>The psalms almost identical, but not quite. Why would the same author write practically the same psalm twice? More likely that a later composer used the earlier psalm and changed it a bit to fit his own meaning and whatever he was referring to in the psalm. Thus, they are two separate psalms written by two separate authors at two separate times. Now the game becomes to figure out what each psalm is about and what the differences mean.</li>\n<li>Same as number 2, but instead of saying that a later author changed the text of an earlier author, why not say that the same author changed his earlier composition to have it refer to different circumstances? So now we have one author of both psalms.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Options 2 and 3, although differing in the textual history of the psalm, both answer your question: \"Why is the same psalm repeated\"? Answer: It was intentionally \"re-written\" to address a different topic. Although there are only minor differences, these differences are important enough to make it a separate psalm. The compiler of the Book of Psalms then included both of them as they are two psalm about two different things.</p>\n\n<p>Option 1, on the other hand, leaves us with your question. Why is the psalm repeated if it is indeed the same psalm with only textual variants?</p>\n\n<p>A more critical scholar, like Rabbi Zvi Perez Chajes (in the Psalms volume of Avraham Kahane's <em>\"Tanach im Perush Mada'i\"</em>), would answer that the five books of the Psalms were compiled separately by different editors, then later combined together. Both book one and book two of Psalms included slightly different variants of this same psalm, and now we have two versions of it in the same book.</p>\n\n<p>A more traditional scholar, like Professor Feivel Meltzer (in <em>\"P'nei Sefer Tehillim\"</em>), takes a different approach as follows: Although the two psalms are one and the same, and the textual variants evolved as normal textual variants, psalms are prayers of the people, and in the minds of the people, the differences mean different things regardless of the original author's intention. So the compiler included both because the differences between them are meaningful as they were understood by the people as prayers.</p>\n\n<p>Prof. Meltzer's theory now leads us back to the game of option 2 and 3. How do we understand the difference between the two psalms? [Just now, instead of asking \"What did the author mean?\", we ask, \"How did the people understand this as a prayer?\"] As @Ephraim pointed out, Rashi understands them as referring to the first and second temples. Others understand that one is about evildoers and corrupt persons in general, while the other refers to a more specific evil personality, such as Sennacherib. Or one is about Jewish sinners and the other is about gentile oppressors. Whatever it may be, there is a reason why both psalms are included as separate psalms.</p>\n\n\n",

Reading about it, I am fascinated about what seems to be endless meanings and interpretations of the word <em>hevel</em>. Wikipedia states, for example that the word can mean:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"vain\", \"futile\", \"empty\", \"meaningless\", \"temporary\", \"transitory\", \"fleeting,\" or \"mere breath,\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://files.nyu.edu/air1/public/An%20Innovative%20view%20of%20the%20Biblical%20Book%20of%20Ecclesiastes%20%28Kohelet%29.html\">Other sources</a> agree with \"vanity\" and \"emptiness\", but also add \"randomness\" to the pile.\nWhat really starts to confuse me though is when I see it being <a href=\"http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/Hevel\">used as a name</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hevel as a boy's name is of Hebrew origin, and the meaning of Hevel is \"breath, vapor\". Also possibly (Assyrian) \"meadow\". Source form of Abel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question is, which of these \"meanings\" of the word are <em>inherited</em> or rather interpretations of the true meaning of the word? For example, if we assume \"breath, vapor\" is the original meaning of the word, one can see how the related meanings can arise from that, as a breath of air is very much temporary and fleeting, so is that the case or is there a more fundamental meaning of the word?</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this question makes sense and is ok within the frames of this site.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>From Rabbi S.

Now Hevel (breath, vapor, vanity etc.) is a deep matter, being that Breath is the Neshama (breathing, living, etc.) so there are many, many aspects related. For example, here is one. Bringing it to the practical level, when a person makes a sigh for holy aspirations and good things, he draws Life and Goodness toward that thing etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Likutei_Moharan.109.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Likutei_Moharan.109.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n<p>יֵשׁ הֶבֶל אֲשֶׁר נַעֲשָׂה עַל הָאָרֶץ, אֲשֶׁר יֵשׁ צַדִּיקִים שֶׁמַּגִּיעַ אֲלֵיהֶם כְּמַעֲשֵׂה וְכוּ' (קהלת ח׳:י״ד): “Yesh Hevel (There is a vanity) done upon the earth: there are tzaddikim to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the tzaddikim.” (Ecclesiastes 8:14) [See also the essential question of Moshe to H\"Y, \"Show me Your way\" - Why do the righteous suffer yet the wicked prosper?? - Berakhot 7a on Ex. 33:13 https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.7a.25?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi]</p>\n<p>פֵּרוּשׁ: הֶבֶל, הַיְנוּ הֶבֶל פֶּה הַיּוֹצֵא מֵהַגָּרוֹן, מִגְּנוּחֵי דְּקָגָנַח, כָּל אֶחָד לְפִי עֶרְכּוֹ, צַדִּיקִים יֵלְכוּ וּפוֹשְׁעִים יִכָּשְׁלוּ. The explanation is as follows: Hevel is the hevel -breath of the mouth that comes from the throat, from the sighs that one sighs; each person commensurate with his level, [as in,] “tzaddikim will go,” and “sinners will stumble” (Hoshea 14:10).</p>\n<p>יֵשׁ רָשָׁע כָּל יָמָיו, וּמִתְאַנֵּחַ וְנָהּ עַל הֶעָבָר; וְיֵשׁ, חַס וְשָׁלוֹם, צַדִּיק מֵעִקָּרוֹ, וְתוֹהֵא עַל הָרִאשׁוֹנוֹת, וְנָהּ וּמִתְאַנֵּחַ גַּם כֵּן. There is one who was wicked all his days, but sighs and groans over the past. And there is, God forbid, one who was originally righteous, but regrets the former [deeds] and also groans and sighs.</p>\n<p>וְהִנֵּה יֵשׁ שְׁנֵי חֲבָלִים: חֶבֶל דִּקְדֻשָּׁה, וּכְנֶגְדּוֹ – דְּטֻמְאָה. וְהַבְּחִירָה חָפְשִׁית, מִי שֶׁמְּקַדֵּשׁ עַצְמוֹ מְקַשֵּׁר עַצְמוֹ בְּחֶבֶל דִּקְדֻשָּׁה, וּלְהֵפֶךְ, חַס וְשָׁלוֹם, מִי שֶׁמְּטַמֵּא עַצְמוֹ מְקַשֵּׁר עַצְמוֹ בְּחֶבֶל דְּטֻמְאָה. Now behold, there are two ropes: the rope of holiness, and counter to it, of impurity. Yet the choice is free. A person who sanctifies himself, binds himself with the rope of holiness. Conversely, God forbid, a person who defiles himself, binds himself with the rope of impurity.</p>\n<p>וְהִנֵּה, הַנֹּהַּ וְהָאֲנָחָה הוּא בְּחִינַת מִיתָה בְּגוּף וָנֶפֶשׁ. בְּגוּף – כְּמוֹ שֶׁאָמְרוּ רַבּוֹתֵינוּ זִכְרוֹנָם לִבְרָכָה (ברכות נח:): אֲנָחָה שׁוֹבֶרֶת גּוּפוֹ שֶׁל אָדָם. וּבְנֶפֶשׁ גַּם־כֵּן – כִּי יָדוּעַ מַה שֶּׁכָּתוּב (תהילים ק״ד:כ״ט): תּוֹסֵף רוּחָם יִגְוָעוּן; כִּי קֹדֶם הַמִּיתָה נִתּוֹסֵף רוּחָם, וַאֲזַי יִגְוָעוּן. And behold, groaning and sighing are an aspect of death in body and soul. In body, as our Sages teach: Sighing breaks a man’s body (Berakhot 58b). And also in soul, for known is that which is written (Psalms 104:29), “When You increase their ruach -breath, they perish.” This is because prior to death, “their ruach -breath” increases and then “they perish.”</p>\n<p>כְּמוֹ כֵן הַנֹּהַּ וְהָאֲנָחָה, אִם תְּדַקְדֵּק וּתְעַיֵּן בָּהּ, אֵיךְ הִיא נִמְשֶׁכֶת אֶל הַגָּרוֹן, הִיא בִּבְחִינַת תּוֹסֵף רוּחָם, כִּי לְפִי שָׁעָה קַלָּה נִתּוֹסֵף רוּחוֹ, וְכִמְעַט רֶגַע תִּגְוַע וְתֵאָסֵף. The same applies to groaning and sighing. If you investigate and observe how it is drawn to the throat, [you will see that] it is an aspect of “toSeiPh (You increase) their ruach -breath.” For a short while his ruach -breath increases, and but a minute later he [might] perish and be tei’aSeiPh (gathered up).</p>\n<p>וְהִנֵּה מִי שֶׁמִּתְאַנֵּחַ וְנָהּ עַל עֲבֵרוֹת שֶׁבְּיָדוֹ, וְרוֹצֶה לָשׁוּב בִּתְשׁוּבָה. אֲזַי בַּאֲנָחָה זוֹ הוּא נִגְוָע וְנֶאֱסָף מִן הָרָע שֶׁהָיָה בְּיָדוֹ, בִּבְחִינַת: תּוֹסֶף רוּחָם יִגְוָעוּן, וְנִדְבָּק אֶל הַקְּדֻשָּׁה. Therefore, when one groans and sighs over the sins he has committed, and wants to return in repentance, then with this sigh he perishes and is gathered up from the evil that was in his hands, as in, “When You increase their ruach -breath, they perish.” And he becomes attached to  holiness.</p>\n<p>וְכֵן לְהֵפֶךְ, חַס וְשָׁלוֹם, מִי שֶׁנָּהּ וּמִתְאַנֵּחַ עַל הַטּוֹב שֶׁבְּיָדוֹ, וְרוֹצֶה לְדַבֵּק עַצְמוֹ בְּטֻמְאָה, אֲזַי נִגְוָע וְנֶאֱסָף רוּחוֹ דִּקְדֻשָּׁה, וְנִדְבָּק אֶל הַטֻּמְאָה. The reverse is also true, God forbid. When one groans and sighs over the good which he has performed, and wants to attach himself to impurity, then his holy ruach -breath perishes and is gathered up. And he becomes attached to  impurity.</p>\n<p>וְזֶהוּ: יֵשׁ הֶבֶל – הַיְנוּ הַהֶבֶל פֶּה מֵהַנֹּהַּ וְהָאֲנָחָה שֶׁהוּא נָהּ וּמִתְאַנֵּחַ. This is the meaning of [the opening verse]: There is hevel—That is, the hevel -breath of the mouth from the groan and the sigh which he groans and sighs.</p>\n<p>יֵשׁ צַדִּיקִים – שֶׁתּוֹהִין עַל הָרִאשׁוֹנוֹת, וְיוֹצֵא הֶבֶל מִפִּיהֶם מֵהָאֲנָחָה, there are tzaddikim—They regret the former [deeds], and hevel -breath emerges from their mouths from the sighing.</p>\n<p>וּמַגִּיעַ אֲלֵיהֶם כְּמַעֲשֵׂה הָרְשָׁעִים – כִּי נִדְבָּקִין אֶל הַסִּטְרָא אָחֳרָא וְהַטֻּמְאָה. to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked—This is because they become attached to the Other Side and the impure.</p>\n<p>וְיֵשׁ רְשָׁעִים – שֶׁנּוֹהִים וּמְאַנְּחִים, וּמֵהַהֶבֶל שֶׁיּוֹצֵא מִפִּיהֶם and there are wicked men—They groan and sigh, and from the hevel -breath that emerges from their mouth:</p>\n<p>מַגִּיעַ אֲלֵיהֶם כְּמַעֲשֵׂה הַצַּדִּיקִים – כִּי נִפְסָקִין מֵהַטֻּמְאָה, וְנִדְבָּקִין אֶל הַקְּדֻשָּׁה. to whom it happens according to the deeds of the tzaddikim—This is because they separate from the impure and become attached to holiness.</p>\n<p>וְהַכְּלָל – כִּי אֶת זֶה לְעֻמַּת זֶה, וְצָרִיךְ לִהְיוֹת לוֹ חִיּוּת מֵחֶבֶל מֵאֶחָד שֶׁבִּשְׁנֵיהֶם, וְתֵכֶף שֶׁהוּא נִפְסָק מֵחֶבֶל זֶה, הוּא נִדְבָּק בַּחֶבֶל שֶׁכְּנֶגְדּוֹ. The general principle is this: “[God made] one to contrast the other” (Ecclesiastes 7:14), and a person must get vitality from one or the other of the two ropes. And, no sooner is he separated from one rope, than he becomes attached to the rope which contrasts it.</p>\n<p>עַל כֵּן טוֹב לְהַרְגִּיל אֶת עַצְמוֹ לְהִתְאַנֵּחַ עַל מַעֲשָׂיו שֶׁאֵינָם טוֹבִים, וְלִכְסֹף וּלְהִשְׁתּוֹקֵק בְּתֹקֶף אַנְחָתוֹ לָשׁוּב לְהַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ, כִּי עַל־יְדֵי אֲנָחָה זֹאת, נִפְסָק מֵחֶבֶל דְּטֻמְאָה, וְנִתְקַשֵּׁר בְּחֶבֶל דִּקְדֻשָּׁה כַּנַּ\"ל: It is therefore good to become accustomed to sigh over one’s bad deeds, and to yearn and long, in the midst of one’s sighing, to return to God. For through this sighing, one separates from the rope of impurity and becomes attached to the rope of holiness, as mentioned above.</p>\n<p>עוֹד מָצָאתִי מִכְּתַב יַד הַחֲבֵרִים מֵעִנְיַן זֶה, וּמְבֹאָר שָׁם בְּבֵאוּר יוֹתֵר מִגֹּדֶל מַעֲלַת יִקְרַת הָאֲנָחָה דִּקְדֻשָּׁה. כִּי מְבֹאָר שָׁם, שֶׁהָאֲנָחָה שֶׁמְּאַנֵּחַ הָאָדָם עַל עֲווֹנוֹתָיו אוֹ עַל מִעוּט הַשָּׂגָתוֹ, הוּא יוֹתֵר טוֹב מִכַּמָּה סִגּוּפִים וְתַעֲנִיּוֹת. כִּי בְּתַעֲנִית אֵינוֹ מְשַׁבֵּר רַק הַגּוּף לְבַד, אֲבָל בַּאֲנָחָה מְשַׁבֵּר כָּל הַגּוּף, וְגַם מַחֲלִיף אֶת הַנֶּפֶשׁ וְהַחִיּוּת שֶׁלּוֹ מֵרַע לְטוֹב. In addition, I found a manuscript from [Rebbe Nachman’s] students on this topic, in which the tremendous value of the sigh of holiness is explained in greater detail. It is explained there that the sigh which a person sighs over his sins or over his lack of spiritual perception, is more beneficial than many acts of mortification and fasts. This is because a fast breaks only the body, but with a sigh one breaks the whole body and also transforms his soul and life-force from evil to good.</p>\n<p>כִּי הַהֶבֶל שֶׁל הָאָדָם, הוּא חֶבֶל הַמְקַשֵּׁר הַנְּשָׁמָה לִמְקוֹם שָׁרְשָׁהּ, לְטוֹב אוֹ לְהֵפֶךְ, חַס וְשָׁלוֹם. וּכְשֶׁמִּתְאַנֵּחַ הוּא בִּבְחִינַת: תּוֹסֵף רוּחָם יִגְוָעוּן, וַאֲזַי נִפְסָק מֵהַחֶבֶל שֶׁהָיָה מְקֻשָּׁר מִתְּחִלָּה וְנִתְקַשֵּׁר לְחֶבֶל אַחֵר כְּפִי הָאֲנָחָה וְכוּ', וְכַנַּ\"ל: For a person’s hevel -breath is a chevel (rope) that binds the upper soul to the place of its root—to good, or God forbid, the opposite. And when he sighs, he is in the aspect of “When You increase their ruach -breath, they perish.” At that point, he separates from the rope to which he was originally bound and becomes bound to another rope, commensurate with the sigh [etc. as mentioned. End of Torah 109.]</p>\n\n\n",

The idolatrous carved\n  images must be cut down, and the Israelites shall obliterate their\n  names from that place. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if any form of idolatry is involved, it will be obviously forbidden.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jihadiyehudi.blogspot.co.uk/2011_07_01_archive.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">This blog</a> tries to explain “Chukas Hagoy”. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah warns us to avoid “chukkat ha goyim” the “statutes of the\n  nations.” As a holy nation, separated by the unique discipline of the\n  Torah we are sternly warned to avoid gentile practices. The law is\n  complicated and this is just meant to be a quick review to expose my\n  thinking. </p>\n  \n  <p>the prohibition, says Rashi, applies particularly to Non-Jewish\n  practices that reflect corruption, idolatrous superstitions or such\n  things as attending “theaters or stadiums.” We are told elsewhere that\n  the prohibition is on attending theaters and stadiums is one of the\n  first and few laws that a potential convert must be taught. This\n  refers to the Roman stadiums which were the site of violent gladiator\n  games. Jews were and are forbidden to enjoy entertainments which focus\n  on degrading human beings and torturing animals. </p>\n  \n  <p>In general, these prohibitions distance Jews from things that are not\n  in keeping with Jewish values.</p>\n  \n  <p>By contrast, the Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De’ah), the most authoritative\n  code of Jewish law concludes that if the custom does not promote\n  idolatrous behavior and/or is viewed as a \"dignified act\", then no\n  such prohibition of \"chukat HaGoy\" exists. While there may yet be\n  other halachic prohibitions that would restrain a Jew from taking up\n  such a practice for themselves, there is surely no reason why we\n  should discourage others from following it. On the contrary, I believe\n  the obligations of Jewish spiritual citizenship may demand that we\n  encourage it. That is where my thoughts begin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Being a Dervish does seem to have its origin in “ gentile practices”, (Sufi Muslim) and I suggest that there is not a tradition (for others than special individuals) of asceticism in Judaism; therefore it seems that these would be “things that are not in keeping with Jewish values”.</p>\n\n\n",

Do you think that the word מיום כיפורים זה and הבא עלינו לטובה or שבועות are Aramaic?</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, as long as we have the correct intent and are saying what has been established as a nusach, I cannot really see myself bothered one way or the other.</p>\n\n<p>An additional point. In Daniel, which contains Biblical Aramaic, we see kol. Thus, in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3404.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Daniel 4:3</a>:\nוּמִנִּי, שִׂים טְעֵם, לְהַנְעָלָה קָדָמַי, <strong>לְכֹל</strong> חַכִּימֵי בָבֶל:  דִּי-פְשַׁר חֶלְמָא, יְהוֹדְעֻנַּנִי.</p>\n\n<p>However, two pesukim later, with a makef introduced, we have kal:\nבֵּלְטְשַׁאצַּר, רַב חַרְטֻמַּיָּא--דִּי אֲנָה יִדְעֵת דִּי רוּחַ אֱלָהִין קַדִּישִׁין בָּךְ, <strong>וְכָל-רָז</strong> לָא-אָנֵס לָךְ; חֶזְוֵי חֶלְמִי דִי-חֲזֵית וּפִשְׁרֵהּ, אֱמַר.</p>\n\n<p>If we trust the Masoretes for their vocalization of Aramaic, then this would should that there is indeed Kol in Aramaic.

In which case, there would not really be much a difference. Would this extend to Aramaic? Maybe not. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are a few Sephardic communities which have a tradition to pronounce every qames in Aramaic as qames gadhol: e.g., kal nidre.  (Even fewer retain this only in certain common phrases, like kal nidre, but there is probably no basis for this.)  This may have developed as an over-correction: people had to be careful to say \"ʿalam\" and not \"ʿolam\" so they also said kal and not kol.\nIn all other communities Aramaic has the same rules for qames-qatan as Hebrew does.\nBeware! that many siddurim spell kol and similar words with a qames but neglect to include the maqqeph.  This causes people to err because they think the word has independent stress and therefore the qames must be gadhol.  In such places, one should use kol with qames qatan despite the lack of maqqeph.\nIn Ps. 35:10, most traditions consider the qames to be qames gadhol because the word has an accent.  In Isaiah 40:12 wekhal with qames gadhol is a verb, and does not mean \"all\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Every qamatz at the last syllable with maqaf and  another word must be qamats qatan, otherwise the baale hamassora  would place a taam miqra in the word \"kol\". </p>\n\n\n",

I will cite <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.co.il/2010/09/is-rain-negative-omen-on-succot.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">my blogpost</a> about this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Succot, in the time of the Mishna, was right before the rainy season. It was possible for rain to come then, but not as likely. But then, the Hebrew calendar was fixed, and there is seasonal drift of this lunar calendar compared with the solar calendar. To cite <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> on this:</p>\n<p>The seriousness of the spring equinox drift is widely discounted on the grounds that Passover will remain in the spring season for many millennia, and the text of the Torah is generally not interpreted as having specified tight calendrical limits. On the other hand, the mean southward equinoctial year length is considerably shorter, so the Hebrew calendar has been drifting faster with respect to the autumn equinox, and at least part of the harvest festival of Sukkot is already more than a month after the equinox in years 1, 9, and 12 of each 19-year cycle; beginning in Hebrew year 5818 (2057 CE), this will also be the case in year 4. (These are the same year numbers as were mentioned for the spring season in the previous paragraph, except that they get incremented at Rosh Hashanah.) This progressively increases the probability that Sukkot will be cold and wet, making it uncomfortable or impractical to dwell in the traditional succah during Sukkot. The first winter seasonal prayer for rain is not recited until Shemini Atzeret, after the end of Sukkot, yet it is becoming increasingly likely that the rainy season in Israel will start before the end of Sukkot.</p>\n<p>End quote from Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>Once mashiach comes and we reestablish the calendar according to moon sighting, bet din could simply make one leap year NOT a leap year, and we would be more or less back on track. But as it stands, as the years progress, it becomes more and more likely that it rains on succot. Nishtaneh hateva. This is derech hateva, and not necessarily a sign of Divine displeasure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>No one seems to have answered the question. Perhaps because the answer is so well known. It is an example of a king asking his servant to prepare wine (by mixing with water) and then spilling the water (over him). This tells the servant that he doesnt want his 'services'. Hashem is also telling us by bringing rain that he doesnt want our mitsvot and would rather do without them. Meaning we are not on the madrega to be able to do them and please him. </p>\n\n<p>This goes against the lubavich (and other kiruv) principles to get people to do mitvot. Hashem doesnt want 'everyone's' mitvot only from 'certain' people who are on  the madrega.</p>\n\n<p>This question was only put here because of its supplementary which cannot be answered elsewhere at the moment. This has so far not produced any answers and seems to have eluded everyone here. It is quite a long answer having to explain a difficult gemoro with many shittos, some totally against the gemoro and I will do so slowly. </p>\n\n<p>I will first add a chiddush of my own which will go someway to explaining the 'rain'.</p>\n\n<p>The moshol or parable is of a king and his servant. He most likely only had one servant (at a time) who mixed his drinks. Providing a 'downpour' seems like collective 'punishment' or displeasure. It doesnt usually rain just on one succah and not on the next. And also in the other examples of this kind of thing, of hashem expressing his displeasure it is not in a  'collective' way but a private one. </p>\n\n<p>I therefore think although highly unusual and  improbable but still possible, that it really refers to when it rained on one succah and not on the next. There are such chasidic tales. That is clear proof that hashem is not interested in your mitsvot. </p>\n\n<p>Although the example I gave on another thread was regarding a person who is not yet ready to learn kabala and does so, the gemoro refers to another example and the poskim like the chayai odom say it refers to that as well.</p>\n\n<p>In the gemoro's example where the early poskim give the same moshol of the king and servant, matters are more serious. There it is a 'private' and 'deadly' sign not a collective one like with rain and although the mishne berura and others tells you what to do about it, basically to learn, daven certain tfillos daily, and good deeds, there is still some arguement if it will save you from death or just make your passage to the next world 'easier'.</p>\n\n<p>To be continued if found to be of interest or if someone at last can find out what I am talking about. I have almost said it.</p>\n\n\n",

See also Sanhedrin 98a in the Babylonian talmud, which -- in the midst of a discussion of signs that the messiah has come -- calls the messiah the \"son of David\" several times.  \"Son of David\" -- that is, a Jewish man descended from King David.  A man, not a supernatural being.  From the Soncino translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Johanan also said: The son of David will come only in a generation that is either altogether righteous or altogether wicked. ‘in a generation that is altogether righteous,’ — as it is written, Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever. ‘Or altogether wicked,’ — as it is written, And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; and it is [elsewhere] written, For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And also this (ibid, 98b):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rab Judah said in Rab's name: The Holy One, blessed be He, will raise up another David for us, as it is written, But they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them: not ‘I raised up’, but ‘I will raise up’ is said. R. Papa said to Abaye: But it is written, And my servant David shall be their prince [nasi] for ever? — E.g., an emperor and a viceroy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But, you might say, maybe angels are also human so Michael could still qualify?  But angels are not humans and cannot be.  One proof of this is in the g'mara on Shabbat 88b-89a, which relates how when Moshe ascended Mount Sinai to receive torah, the angels in the heavenly court challenged God.  \"How can you give Your holy torah to mere <em>humans</em>?\" they asked.  God told Moshe \"answer them\", and Moshe proceeded through several of the commandments, asking the court if they were capable of fulfilling them.  Do you work, that you need to refrain on Shabbat?  Are you capable of forming the intent to murder?  Do you have relations that you could commit adultery?  Do you even <em>have</em> fathers and mothers that you could honor them?

    "content": "# What damages are owed if you break something that had some damage already, but partial repair isn't possible?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This morning as I was driving to work I contemplated the aggressive tailgater behind me.  My car's rear bumper has some paint dings from anonymous parking-lot damage that I never repaired (I deemed it not worth the cost for a cosmetic, not functional, problem).  </p>\n\n<p>I'm pretty sure that if the guy behind me had smashed my car his insurance company would have paid the full cost of the repair, restoring it to new condition.<sup>1</sup>  But what does halacha say, given that it wasn't in new condition in the first place?  I have the impression (from vaguely-remembered articles and/or lectures, nothing particularly deep) that he is only responsible for the differential cost, but what happens when the only possible repair from the new damage (e.g. replacing the part) effects a complete repair?  Would I owe him something to account for the prior damage, even though I wasn't previously willing to spend that money to get that repair?  (That is, if the repair somehow restored the car to its prior state instead of a better one, that would have been ok with me.)</p>\n\n<p>Does it matter if the pre-existing damage was minor or major?  (Are paint scuffs the same as a pre-existing dent?)  Does it matter if ignoring certain types of damage is common (everyone I know ignores parking-lot scuffs) versus unusual (almost nobody I know ignores major dents)?</p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> Less my deductible, maybe.  I don't know if that's relevant.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I seem to recall that you're paid for the difference between the market value of the car before it was damaged and its value damaged: that the payment has nothing to do with repairs. (This differs from assault on a person, where one pays for the difference in value (as above, <em>nezek</em>), repairs (<em>ripuy</em>), lost wages (<em>sheves</em>), and pain and suffering (<em>boshes</em> and <em>tzaar</em>).) That would, if true, imply (a) that the tailgater would not, as the question assumes, need to pay to fix the car; (b) that the tailgater would pay only the difference between the value of a well-dented car and that of a slightly dented car, which would mean the owner is not getting paid for the slight dents at all if not from whoever inflicted them; and (c) that whoever inflicted the slight dents would need to pay the difference between the value of an undented car and that of a slightly dented car.

Would this be considered taking interest, as the borrower will lose two weeks of using their money (say investing the cash), while the store could themselves place the early payment into an investment that earns them money? The consumer loses two weeks' worth of investment, while the store gains the same. Is this considered a prohibited form of interest?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>When a loan is given and a time is set for the return of the loan, the lender may not demand the return of the loan before the set time has arrived (Choshen Mishpat 73, 2). However, if the borrower wishes to repay the loan before the time has arrived he may do so (Choshen Mishpat 74, 2). This is the general rule (albeit there are certain special circumstances where the halacha is different - see in the previous sources and the commentaries for the details).\nEither way, early payment of the loan is not considered interest, as interest only applies where the lender gains more than the repayment of the loan. Early repayment is not considered a gain, as if he wouldn't have given the loan he would have had the money the whole time. Thus he has not gained anything from the loan. \nThe only issue is whether the lender is entitled to the money before the time has arrived, and the basic rule (barring special circumstances) is that he is not, but if the borrower agrees to pay then he may do so.  </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How to vowelize \"כתובה\" (\"marriage document\")?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The promissory note a husband gives his wife when they wed is called a כתובה.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, people usually pronounce/vowelize this word \"כְּתֻבָּה / <em>k'suba</em>\". Such a form (<em>mishkal</em>) exists in Hebrew: for example, \"<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%90_%D7%9B%D7%98_%D7%99%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">גְּדֻלָּה</a> / <em>g'dula</em>\". And don't let the presence of a ו (<em>vav</em>) in the usual spelling (\"כתובה\") throw you: such additions are common. (Consider, again, \"<a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=113\" rel=\"noreferrer\">גדולה</a> / <em>g'dula</em>\".)</p>\n\n<p>But I've long suspected that the correct pronunciation/vowelization of \"כתובה\" is \"כְּתוּבָה / <em>k'suva</em>\". This is with very little basis — specifically, the form of \"גְּדֻלָּה\" seems to me rather rare, so positing it doesn't show up here seems somewhat sensible, and the meaning of \"כְּתוּבָה\" is \"written\", which also makes some sense. I wonder, though, whether it's true.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, <strong>is there any evidence</strong> (besides \"everyone says it thus\") <strong>for any pronunciation/vowelization of \"כתובה\"?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The form 'כְּתוּבָה' certainly exists, as you state; it is the passive participle of the root כתב, and means \"written\", as in: \"נבואתו כתובה על הקיר\" = \"his prophecy is written on the wall\".</p>\n\n<p>However, this is not the same as the noun which designates a \"marriage contract\". Although there are exceptions, for the most part nouns with specific meanings are not derived via the appropriation of participles, but rather they are derived by setting a root to one of the nominal mishqalim. In this case, the relevant mishqal used is the קְטֻלָּה mishqal; hence כְּתֻבָּה. </p>\n\n<p>The original poster suggests that this mishqal is rather rare; however, that is not the case. Many nouns in Biblical, Mishnaic, and Modern Hebrew are formed from this mishqal. Here is a sampling:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֲגֻדָּה, אֲחֻזָּה, אֲלֻמָּה, אֲסֻפָּה, אֲפֻדָּה, אֲצֻלָּה, אֲרֻבָּה,\n  גְּאֻלָּה, גְּדֻלָּה, הֲמֻלָּה, חֲלֻקָּה, חֲנֻכָּה, חֲנֻפָּה,\n  חֲתֻנָּה, יְרֻשָּׁה, כְּבֻדָּה, כְּהֻנָּה, כְּתֻבָּה, נְקֻדָּה,\n  סְגֻלָּה, עֲבֻדָּה, עֲרֻבָּה, פְּלֻגָּה, פְּעֻלָּה, פְּקֻדָּה,\n  קְדֻשָּׁה, קְוֻצָּה, קְצֻבָּה, קְצֻנָּה, שְׁדֻלָּה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, in order to demonstrate that our earliest sources do indeed reflect a pronunciation of the marriage contract as 'כְּתֻבָּה', it is sufficient to look at <a href=\"http://jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/talmud/mishna/showmi.asp?mnusriptnum=1723_0&library=1_0&mishnanum=8&pereknum=003&masecet=2&p=2&libindex=1&manuscriptindex=1&masecetindex=2&perekindex=3\">Ms. Kaufmann 50</a>, the authoritative vocalized manuscript of the mishnah, to see to that the word is consistently written with a dagesh in the bet (the word appears there in the left column, third line).</p>\n\n<p>So, to summarize: just as it does with so many other roots, so too the Hebrew language conveniently distinguishes within the root כתב between the past participle and the specific noun by the use of two separate forms, כְּתוּבָה and  כְּתֻבָּה: the first is the past participle, while the second is the noun meaning \"marriage contract\".</p>\n\n\n",

For the biblical commandment is specifically incumbent upon the groom to please his wife [and not vice-versa]. And even here there are opinions that [her] forgoing this right would be effective [in freeing the groom from his responsibilities] (trans. my own).</p>\n\n<p>To summarize, the Maharsham combines two elements to reach the point of \"no problem whatsoever\": agreement of husband, and lack of obligation in the first place (for brides).</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/12/2008/whats_the_truth_about_sheva_berachot/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/12/2008/whats_the_truth_about_sheva_berachot/</a> (first paragraph under Background) and <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5770/yisro.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5770/yisro.html</a> (footnote 17)</p>\n\n\n",

This includes using animals for research.</p></li>\n<li><p>Pests can be killed even using quite painful traps and pesticides.</p></li>\n<li><p>It says <a href=\"http://m.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/968261/jewish/Chapter-5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> that a calf found in the womb, as long as it was removed after the mother died, and that mother was properly slaughtered, can be eaten without slaughter and that, potentially, even eating its limbs while it is alive is permitted (because, technically, it is considered part of its mother's body, not a living creature in its own right).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm not asking about the difference between killing an animal and killing a human, or using an animal for labour or pets in a caring way (perhaps akin to the license the Torah gives to own slaves - but requires us to treat them with compassion).</p>\n\n<p><strong>But purely in terms of causing or allowing pain, fear, and grief to animals I am trying to understand the discrepancy between my perception of reality (that the animal is a living thing that feels pain) and the technical approach allowed by the Torah.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As explained by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides</a> in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 3:48, the Torah does recognize animals' physical and emotional feelings, and several commandments reflect this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The commandment concerning the killing of animals is necessary, because the natural food of man consists of vegetables and of the flesh of animals: the best meat is that of animals permitted to be used as food. No doctor has any doubts about this. <strong>Since, therefore, the desire of procuring good food necessitates the slaying of animals, the Law enjoins that the death of the animal should be the easiest.</strong> It is not allowed to torment the animal by cutting the throat in a clumsy manner, by poleaxing, or by cutting off a limb whilst the animal is alive.</p>\n<p>It is also prohibited to kill an animal with its young on the same day (Lev. xxii. 28), in order that people should be restrained and prevented from killing the two together in such a manner that the young is slain in the sight of the mother; <strong>for the pain of the animals under such circumstances is very great. There is no difference in this case between the pain of man and the pain of other living beings, since the love and tenderness of the mother for her young ones is not produced by reasoning, but by imagination, and this faculty exists not only in man but in most living beings.</strong> This law applies only to ox and lamb, because of the domestic animals used as food these alone are permitted to us, and in these cases the mother recognises her young.</p>\n<p>The same reason applies to the law which enjoins that we should let the mother fly away when we take the young. The eggs over which the bird sits, and the young that are in need of their mother, are generally unfit for food, and when the mother is sent away she does not see the taking of her young ones, and does not feel any pain. In most cases, however, this commandment will cause man to leave the whole nest untouched, because [the young or the eggs], which he is allowed to take, are, as a rule, unfit for food. <strong>If the Law provides that such grief should not be caused to cattle or birds,</strong> how much more careful must we be that we should not cause grief to our fellowmen. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp184.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Accordingly, animals' needs <em>are</em> taken into account; however, in some cases there may be other factors that override the animals' needs (e.g. the need to consume meat mentioned by Maimonides here).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0101.htm#28\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gensis 1:28</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְבָרֶךְ אֹתָם, אֱלֹהִים, וַיֹּאמֶר לָהֶם אֱלֹהִים פְּרוּ וּרְבוּ וּמִלְאוּ אֶת-הָאָרֶץ, <strong>וְכִבְשֻׁהָ; וּרְדוּ בִּדְגַת הַיָּם, וּבְעוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם, וּבְכָל-חַיָּה, הָרֹמֶשֶׂת עַל-הָאָרֶץ.</strong>‏</p>\n  \n  <p>And God blessed them; and God said unto them: 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, <strong>and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth.</strong>'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The world was given over to humans, not to animals.

    "content": "# Does 'not in heaven' apply to kabbalah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a famous dictum: 'lo ba'shomayim he', meaning that after the torah was given at Sinai its rules, mandates and precepts are determined by man and not dictated by heaven. An example is when there was an argument about the halachic status of an oven the ruling followed the majority in spite of a clear proclamation from heaven which supported the minority view (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=86b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bava Metzia 86b</a>).</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know if this applies to mystical or kabbalistic matters as well. For example if a majority of kabbalists view a phenomenon in a certain way, and Rabbi Yitzchak Luria disagrees. Would we follow the majority or would we say that since Rabbi Luria was divinely inspired (perhaps by Eliyahu or through some other divine assistance) we would follow his minority interpretation instead.</p>\n\n<p>In short, do we apply the principle of 'lo ba'shomayim he' to kabbalah?</p>\n\n<p>Note: Please answer in general, and not just for the above example.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>We find in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.104b.53-55/he/Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 104b</a> how the Chachamim were about to count someone in to the list of those not set to have a part in Olam Habbah. Then his father's figure appeared and begged for his sake, but was ignored. A fire sprung up on the edges of their benches and they ignored it. They likewise ignored heavenly voices calling out his merits. However, what stopped them was when the <a href=\"http://www.come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_104.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">heavenly voice said</a>,  'Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, 'or whether thou choose; and not I etc.'</p>\n\n<p>This is the attitude Mekubalim have when faced with the words of the Arizal. He knew and you assume, so you'll put aside your ideas and accept his. Actually, even in Halacha we put off our own judgement in favor of earlier traditions.</p>\n\n<p>Although in Kabbalah, and non-Halachah in general, there is no Psak and Rov in the conventional sense (since it doesn't reach a Beis Din), there always exists the universal concept of consensus. When something is roundly rejected or accepted, that is taken as <em>the</em> true view. We find <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/mekorot/igeret-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">mentions of 'Daas Yachid'</a> in topics not directly Halachah related.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Maharal explains that the halachah is always the central point of all opinions that can be brought to bear on a subject.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore Torah lo bashamayim hi because the reasoning of shamayim is not relevant to determining the centrality of halachic opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Kaballah is the way things work, not the ratzon Hashem that acts upon those things. Things can work concurrently in contradictory ways, so there is no reason to look for the centrality of approach regarding kaballah.</p>\n\n\n",

But rather for a different reason, because in these cases there is no monetary value, but only sentimental value which cannot be repaid, and in accordance with monetary laws he can only receive the value of a piece of paper.

    "content": "# Why isn't steeping tea a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The definition of the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/tags/melacha-creative-work/info\"><em>m'lacha</em></a> of cooking/baking on <em>Shabas</em> is \"effecting a change in an object through (fire-based) heat\".  This is alluded to in the very first paragraph of <em>Sh'miras Shabas K'hilchasah</em> —</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל המכשיר דבר לאכילה על ידי חום האש או תולדותיה, הרי זה עובר על איסור בישול.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>— and is my understanding from elsewhere, too, though I don't recall where. (<em>SSK</em> cites no source for this.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, when you steep tea leaves in hot water, you are effecting a change in them: they go from raw to cooked. However, the steeping is done not to effect a change in the leaves at all: you will discard the leaves, and don't care whether they are raw or cooked. It's done, rather, to effect a change in the hot water — specifically, to flavor it. If the hot water is hot permissibly, then the act of steeping the tea leaves in it should be considered a <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=98421&rid=1161\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>m'lacha sheenah tz'richa l'gufah</em></a>, an act of <em>m'lacha</em> that is not needed for the definitional purpose of the <em>m'lacha</em>, much like the standard, classic example of extinguishing a flame for other than collecting the ashes. It should thus be forbidden only <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/623\"><em>mid'rabanan</em></a> and not <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/623\"><em>mid'oray'sa</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems to me.</p>\n\n<p>Yet <em>Mishna B'rura</em> 318:39 and <em>Aruch Hashulchan</em> :28 say steeping tea leaves is forbidden <em>mid'oraysa</em>. (More precisely, they say one who does so is liable to be stoned or to bring a <em>korban</em>, both of which are only for transgressors of <em>d'oray'sa</em> prohibitions.) Why don't they consider it <em>enah tz'richa l'gufah</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I could not find anyone addressing this. I guess the issues are obvious? I am not satisfied with my understanding of the sugya, but here is what I understand:</p>\n\n<p>The basic example of bishul for the mishkan is boiling the dyes, so the basic definition of cooking would include cooking something in order to extract its properties.</p>\n\n<p>Shabbos 106a: \"All destructive actions are exempt, except for injuries and fires\". Rashi explains that according R' Shimon, who requires a maleches machsheves, and says mlacha sh'ein tzricha lgufa is patur, injuries and lighting fires would never meet this standard, and therefore in these two cases there is no standard of tzricha lgufa. (see also Rashba).</p>\n\n<p>If I understand correctly, R' Yehuda argues based on the dye preparations that melachos only need to be constructive, but they do not need to be ltzorech gufom. \"ma li bishul psila, ma li bishul samimanim\". Boiling dye is by its nature not tzricha lgufa, which means that melachos do not have to have this requirement. The gemara does not give R' Shimon's counter-argument, and I did not see any Rishonim discussing it, but he must hold that preparing the dyes was ltzorech gufo. It is possible that that R' Shimon has a somewhat wider definition of mlacha shetzricha lgufa, and that it includes any mlacha whose direct result is constructive and desired. (See Ramban for a similar discussion). Basically, R' Yehuda would have a very strict definition of tzricha lgufa, and then prove from bioling dyes that tzricha lgufa is not necessary, while R' Shimon has a looser definition of tzricha lgufa, which includes boiling dyes. (It does not however include destructive actions except in cases of injury and fire-related activity. Again, see the Ramban.)</p>\n\n<p>If this is correct, then making tea would be a mlacha shetzricha lgufa according to R' Shimon, because any cooking with a constructive intent is tzricha lgufa, and the definition of the melacha as \"effecting a change in an object through (fire-based) heat\" is technically incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>This mostly relies on the Ramban's assertion that tzricha lgufa means only a direct constructive effect, but the other Rishonim to not seem to agree, and they define tzricha lgufa as when the person desires the direct effect of the mlacha, in accordance with its primary definition. If cooking is defined as \n\"effecting a change in an object through (fire-based) heat\", then we are back to the question why R' Shimon does not conclude from the case of dye preparation that we do not need tzricha lgufa. Possibly, (no source for this) R' Shimon would say that affecting the water is no different than affecting the material you are boiling, and that cooking would be defined as using heat to effect a change in an elemtns properties, without refering specifically to the properties of the material which is being boiled. Again, tea would be a mlacha shetzricha lgufa with this definition, exactly like boiling dyes.</p>\n\n<p>Another possibility is that tea is included in the rule of \"kol hamekalkilin peturin chutz mchovel umaavir.\" If we ignore the question of dyes and the definition of cooking, and accept our initial understanding that tea is a melacha she'in tzricha lgufa, the questio is if cooking requires a mlacha shetzricha lgufa. The gemara says that R' Yehuda holds the case of maavir is not mikalkel, because there is no difference between boiling dyes and melting lead. In other words, maavir is referring to boiling, not only to burning wood. I am not sure about this, but from what I can tell most of the Rishonim understand maavir like this, that it is referring to all usages of fire. </p>\n\n<p>To conclude, tea is not mlcacha sheintzricha lgufa either because tzricha lgufa means a direct, constructive outcome, or because the definition of cooking includes improving the water by extracting the properties of the tea, or because cooking does not require tzricha lgufa.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why allowed on Yom Tov?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the Torah, melacha isn't permitted on Yom Tov days except for what is needed for food. I read that certain laws, like carrying, don't apply on these days because they are loosened for food preparation... and if for food, then also for anything else that is needed for the holiday.</p>\n\n<p>How is this leap derived, from 'food' to 'things needed for celebrating the day'?</p>\n\n<p>What makes the question more interesting is that I think one couldn't take a different perspective of the halachic process for him or herself as an individual (and treat the day like Shabbos, except for preparing food) because it would interfere with lighting candles as the community is obliged to.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The principle here is termed by the Gemara (Beitzah 12a, Kesubos 7a) as מתוך שהותרה לצורץ הותרה נמי שלא לצורך - <em>since it was permitted for the purpose [of food preparation] it is also permitted without [food] purpose</em>. You are right that it is not entirely clear how the Sages learned this rule from the verse (Exodus 12:16) which appears to only permit food-related activity: וּבַיּוֹם הָרִאשׁוֹן מִקְרָא קֹדֶשׁ וּבַיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי מִקְרָא קֹדֶשׁ יִהְיֶה לָכֶם כָּל מְלָאכָה לֹא יֵעָשֶׂה בָהֶם <strong>אַךְ אֲשֶׁר יֵאָכֵל לְכָל נֶפֶשׁ הוּא לְבַדּוֹ יֵעָשֶׂה לָכֶם</strong></p>\n\n<p>Several possible explanations can be given for how to understand this principle:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>R. Isaac \"Ohr Zarua\" (Responsa, no. 754) asks your question, and quotes from Rabbeinu Yeshayah (one of the Tosafists) that the Sages learned this rule from the extra word \"לכם\" at the end of the verse above. Rebbi Yehudah (Beitzah 28b) believes that this word expands the work that the Torah permits to work that is only indirectly related to food preparation, and while the majority of the Sages do not agree with his view, it is likely that they (and us) still use this same word to at least expand the permission to  מתוך שהותרה לצורך etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>A more theoretical solution is provided by the Shittah Mekubetzes (to Kesubos 7a). He understands that when the Torah allows food-preparing activity, it does not mean to say \"Yom Tov is exactly like Shabbat, but you can do <em>melacha</em> to prepare food,\" but rather that \"most of the <em>melachot</em> which are prohibited on Shabbat are also prohibited on Yom Tov, but not those that are related to food preparation.\" In other words, the Torah means to say that those activities which are food-preparation-related are simply not prohibited at all on Yom Tov. Ramban (in his commentary to Lev. 23:7) seems to express a similar view, saying that the Torah never prohibited <strong>all</strong> <em>melacha</em> on Yom Tov-only those activities which are <em>melechet avodah,</em> but not food preparation <em>melacha</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>R. Eliezer of Metz in his Sefer Yere'im (no. 104) explains that the Sages understood אוכל נפש as not being literally limited to food, but to any <em>hana'ah,</em> personal benefit. In many cases (e.g. Pesachim 21b) the Sages say explicitly that when the Torah refers to \"food\" or \"eating\", that is merely a way to refer to physical benefit in a general sense. </p></li>\n<li><p>Several later commentators (such as the Turei Even to Megillah 18 in the Avnei Miluim and Sefer Meleches Yom Tov no. 5) understand this concept to be related to another Talmudic idea, מתוך דאשתרי אשתרי, <em>once something has been permitted, it is permitted</em>. This is used by the Sages to explain, for example, why a kohen is permitted to a \"beautiful captive woman\" (see Deut. 21:10-14) even though he is normally prohibited from marrying a women who converted after the age of three. (Kiddushin 21b) The idea here is that once the Torah permits something that should otherwise be prohibited, that permission is absolute. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It should be noted that carrying, which you mention in your question, might be a special case. Rashba (Beitza 12a) explains that carrying is not one of the classic thirty-nine <em>melachot</em> of Shabbat, but is learned from its own special source that it is prohibited on Shabbat--but it was never a true <em>melacha,</em> and therefore is not applicable to Yom Tov at all. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is one way of explaining why melachos that are performed which are associated to food, but not actually for the sake food (- called שלא לצורך -) are permitted, when for the common need of mankind.</p>\n\n<p>The Beis Yosef in Orach Chaim 495* explains according to the Rosh and Tur (amongst other rishonim):<br>\nReally all Melachos related to food for that day which are explicitly permitted in Shemos (12,16), are Muttar min Hatorah in all cases as long as for the sake of that day of Yom Tov. We know this from the Passuk \"Do not light a fire on the day of Shabbos\" (shemos 35,3) only on Shabbos its prohibited. This implies on Yom tov it is permitted since fire is generally for the sake of cooking food so it does not contradict the possuk about Ochel Nefesh (Shemos 12,16) rather it broadens the allowance of lighting fire for anything that is needed for that day on Yomtov e.g heating (miderabanan light a fire from an existing flame because of Nolad). Likewise we would say the same of carrying which is needed for food that it is permitted for everything needed that day. Since there was only a Heter in the Torah for Melachos related to food. However unrelated Melachos to food e.g writing,building, demolishing,weaving, are completely forbidden min HaTorah on Yomtov as they are not similar to lighting a fire which is related to food. But Melachos like Ritual slaughter,baking among others which are related to preparation of food even when done not for the sake of food  are not Prohibited from the Torah rather only Rabbinically, as only melachos which EVERYONE needs for that day and are related to food preparation are permitted Miderabanan.<br>\nHowever There are some Melachos which are entirely forbidden miderabbanan even though they are related to food and everyone needs for that day: like harvesting, grinding and threshing/squezing. This is because if these were permitted, then someone would harvest his entire field or thresh his entire granary for personal gain (not only for the sake of Yomtov meals)through the principal of  marbeh beshiurim (source:beitza 17a: A woman may fill the whole pot with meat to cook, even though she only needs one portion)and miss out on the Essence of Yom tov to gladden With Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>*ונראה טעם לשנים אלו ההוצאה לפי שאף היא באוכל ומשקה ואע\"פ שהיא בדברים אחרים אמרינן מתוך והבערה אע\"פ שאינה באוכלין ומשקין כתיב לא תבערו אש בכל מושבותיכם ביום השבת בשבת הוא דאסור הא בי\"ט שרי ודרשו כן לפי שביום השבת מיותר הוא דהא בשבת מיירי קרא לעיל מיניה וביום השביעי וגו' אבל שאר מלאכות שאינן לצורך אכילה כגון כתיבה והריסה ואריגה ובניין אפילו עשאן לאכילה לוקה ושאר מלאכות שהן באכילה כגון שחיטה ואפייה אפי' עשאן שלא לאכילה אינו לוקה כמו שיתבאר בפ' זה שאם בישל לעו\"ג או לצורך חולה אינו לוקה עכ\"ל:...<br>\nקצירה וטחינה ובצירה וסחיטה אע\"פ שהן אוכל נפש אסרום חכמים ופר\"י הטעם לפי שאדם רגיל לקצור שדהו ולבצור כרמו כאחד ולדרוך כל ענביו ולטחון הרבה ביחד וחשו חכמים שאם היו מתירין בי\"ט היה קוצר כל שדהו ובוצר כל כרמו ודורך כל ענביו וימנע משמחת י\"ט. וכן צידה אסרו שפעמים שתעלה במצודתו דגים הרבה. ובירושלמי מסמיך להו כולהו אקראי </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>Beis Shammai says: \"We do not carry a child, a lulav, or a sefer Torah, to the public domain (on Yom Tov) ; but Beis Hillel allows this.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Gemara explains that Beis Hillel holds of the idea: <strong>\"mitoch\" which means that \"since it (carrying) was permitted for food needs, it was also permitted for any non-food need as well.\"</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Beis Shammai would reject the \"mitoch\" principle (at least as far as Beis Hillel applies it here).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>See Talmud Beitzah 12a. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong> in his comments on Beitzah 3a and Eiruvin 39b, (and this is how  the Rosh and Ramban understand Rashi as well) shows that he would hold the following rule:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any melachah that could have been performed before Yom Tov to the same quality effect, may not be done on Yom Tov itself. This is an issur d'Oraisa</strong> (a Torah prohibition and not merely Rabbinic.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, the continuing subject in Beitzah 12a eventually explains that <strong>we only say Beis Hillel's application of \"Mitoch\" in 3 additional cases besides the melachah of baking/cooking</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>Shechitah</strong> - slaughtering an animal</p>\n\n<p>2) <strong>Havarah</strong> - lighting a fire (from a pre-existing flame)</p>\n\n<p>3) <strong>Hotza'ah</strong> - carrying </p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, we do not apply the rule of \"mitoch\".</p>\n\n<p>The simple reasoning is :</p>\n\n<p>Cooking is the one melachah that (almost) never requires one to have done it before Yom tov. This is because freshly cooked food is always considered tastier than yesterday's reheated fare. So, the Torah would not ask a person to avoid cooking on Yom Tov and make the food before the holiday, because such a thing would not taste as good. (True on shabbos we must prepare the food beforehand, but that's why Yom Tov is special. :) )</p>\n\n<p>Slaughter too is always allowed on Yom Tov (certain Rabbinical restrictions apply) and for the same reason. Fresh meat is better. Freshly slaughtered and cooked right away is just awesome compared to defrosted burgers reheated from two days ago!</p>\n\n<p>Lighting your cooking fire is obviously done on Yom Tov because its the thing that makes the fresh cooking happen! If you did it all beforehand (besides your pilot light), there would be times you will need to raise the flame anyway once you get down to cooking.</p>\n\n<p>Carrying for food also happens on Yom Tov and could not be done beforehand. If you need to make fresh cakes to bring to your friend's house for the party, you can only bake them right before the meal, and so you must carry on Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>All of the other 39 melachos usually could be done before Yom Tov with the same quality effect. (Sure you can dream up some what if's, but the overall idea of any other melachah is that it can technically be done beforehand.)</p>\n\n<p>(BTW, even if you \"could have done it before\" there are ways of still doing it sometimes and in many cases on Yom Tov , but that is only through special (allowance) heter and is not applicable to all works, and is not the subject of the OP.)</p>\n\n<p>An example of what could be done before Yom tov would be Trapping a deer. The meat is just as good if you trapped the deer last week or on Yom Tov. <strong>So, Trapping on Yom Tov is forbidden, even if you are trapping it for the need of food on yom Tov!</strong> However, the slaughter must be done on Yom Tov for fresh meat.</p>\n\n<p>So, in conclusion:</p>\n\n<p><strong>35 of the 39 melachas</strong> may be done <strong>ONLY for direct food purposes</strong> on Yom Tov (if they couldn't be done beforehand). They therefore <strong>do not qualify for \"mitoch\"</strong> of Beis Hillel and absolutely may not be done for non-food needs of Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>example: Grinding may be done on Yom Tov if the food will lose some of its quality by doing it before Yom Tov (otherwise you should have done it before.) --- grating apples --- chopping onions into fine little pieces. </p>\n\n<p>So, one may not apply \"Mitoch\" to grinding. Ex.: crushing metal into shavings for an arts and crafts project would be forbidden on Yom Tov because it has nothing to do with food preperation (or enjoyment of the body) and therefore cannot be allowed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4 of the 39</strong> melachas may be done on Yom Tov in just about all cases as long as it is for a Yom Tov need of some kind, (is for a Jewish person, and is something most people need) even if not for food preparation. The reason is Beis Hillel's <strong>\"Mitoch\". Once they were permitted for food needs on Yom Tov, they were permitted for any Yom Tov need.</strong> Example: carrying a book.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The reasoning behind this, is that since these 4 were so needed for food prep. on Yom Tov, Hashem granted them complete heter.</strong> That is how to explain the statement of Beis Hillel. Since they were permitted for direct and constant food needs, they were permitted for non-food needs of Yom Tov as well.</p>\n\n<p>The Beis Yosef however, says that Mitoch allows you to do these melachas for no reason at all. (not just for a bona fide Yom Tov need). (see details S.A. O.C. 518)</p>\n\n<p>The way to explain this is that since these four works are so key to enjoying food directly, Hashem simply cancelled them outright, as opposed to the other 35. </p>\n\n<p>One more point: <strong>Since the three melachas of baking/cooking, slaughter, and lighting, have very little use other than for food or physical benefit, the only melachah we tend to hear about under the \"mitoch\" principle is only carrying (even though the other 3 are granted \"mitoch\").</strong> That's why it seems carrying is always the one given the leap of food to non-food activities. Carrying is the one melachah exclusively that a \"mitoch\" grant will allow a colorful and large amount of non-food needs to be done on Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the OP's assumption that a stricter view of lighting candles couldn't work; ... this is not an issue. The questions of melachah here are Biblical. Lighting candles for Shabbos or Yom Tov (especially on second day Yom Tov) is a Rabbinical obligation, so it would move aside. You could even have your lights burning with more fuel from before Shabbos or Yom Tov for all 2-3 days in advance. But we don't have to because of \"Mitoch\" -- Beis Hillel. Lighting from a pre existing flame is always permitted on the 6 Yom Tovs.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the easiest and cheapest way to build a kosher sukkah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm looking to build an 8ft x 10ft x8ft(height) sukkah. How can I do that in the easiest (requiring little to no handiman skills) and cheapest way possible? I have 1 wall of my home which I can use as part of the sukkah. I would consider anything under $250 (not including schach) cheap.</p>\n\n<p>Answers may include product recommendations, blueprints and materials list or other suggestions which you have <strong>first hand experience with</strong>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I bought the frame for my current sukkah from <a href=\"http://www.sukkot.com/tubular.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sukkah Project</a>.  Their 8x8 (expansions available) currently lists for $345, <em>but</em> that includes the walls.  When I bought mine I ordered without walls (I already had material I could use) and that dropped the price noticeably, but I don't now remember by how much.  You could email them and ask.</p>\n\n<p>This sukkah goes together in less than an hour using no tools at all -- just slide poles into sockets and hand-tighten.  The (wooden) roof slats have velcro loops on the ends to attach to the frame.  I spend more time putting up walls and lights than I do on the frame and <em>schach</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I've owned mine for about ten years and my roof-support slats are now noticeably bowed.  (That one year with an early snow is probably relevant.)  They still hold the <em>schach</em> up, but I'll probably replace them soon.  They're just 1x2s, so the hardest parts will be (a) transporting 8' boards from the store and (b) getting hold of a staple-gun to apply the velcro.</p>\n\n<p>I've upgraded my original cloth walls to lattice sheets like those sometimes used for fences.  These come in 4x8 sheets and are lightweight enough that one person can carry two or three of them at a time.  I store all this in the garage next to the patio where I set it up; if I had to carry things up and down basement stairs I wouldn't use the lattice.</p>\n\n<p>These same people sell a <a href=\"http://www.sukkot.com/sukkah_kits.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">kit</a> for $75 for a wooden 8x12 sukkah, for which you have to buy the lumber (2x4s, 2x2s, and 1x2s).  Since they don't say on their site what lumber you need I don't know what you should expect to pay to complete the project, but I'd be surprised if it exceeded your limit.</p>\n\n<p>This was my second sukkah.  My first one was a home-made concoction requiring no tools at all, definitely cheap but kind of rickety.  It involved 2x2s, cinder blocks to hold the vertical poles, and rope to lash the corners together.  (Screws would have been better, but I didn't have a drill at the time.)  The walls were bedsheets in pretty designs that I bought for a dollar each at Goodwill.  At the time I made it I had a wooden shed in the yard that I could use for one wall, and I attached a couple of eye-bolts to the side of it to help anchor things in place.  That wasn't strictly necessary (I moved this sukkah to a new location and still used it), but it helped.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would strongly recommend finding the used market for sukkas in your area. Your shul or community may have an active email list for stuff like this, or your community may have an active branch of <a href=\"http://luach.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">luach.com</a>. In the run-up to Sukkot as well as other times (such as the Summer, when many people relocate), you will frequently find used sukkas offered for sale, by people who are moving or upgrading to a different sukka. Or, you could post a request for a used one and see what that turns up.</p>\n\n<p>The specifications you listed are pretty typical of a relatively small (but not tiny) sukka, and are therefore pretty likely to be met by a decent proportion of used sukkas for sale. Like with most goods, there tends to be a significant markdown from the new price on used sukkas. Also, there could be added convenience in the previous owner selling you schach as part of the bundle and/or giving you tips for setting it up.</p>\n\n<p>I do have first-hand experience with this tactic. My wife and I purchased our first sukka, an easy-to-assemble prefab a bit smaller than the size you describe, a few years ago from a family who was switching to a larger model and posted the old one for sale on a community list. We've been using it ever since, including modding it slightly to encompass more area by resting against the wall of our current house.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My current Sukkah (a 20'x10') is made from Ruff Cut Ceder Wood 10' long 2x4s held together by galvanized bolts with nuts and washers (Two at each joint set at a diagonal).

Total cost was about $230 (Not counting Schach), but I had a 30% off total purchase coupon for Home Depot as part of my \"New Homeowner Welcome Kit\".</p>\n\n\n",

This formulation is founded on the verse in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2725.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Iyov</em> (25:2)</a>: המשל ופחד עמו עושה שלום במרומיו (\"He who makes harmony in His lofty heavens\").<sup>*</sup> </p>\n\n<p>The <em>Oseh Shalom</em> prayer is separate prayer recited after the aforementioned prayers.

    "content": "# Why are we forbidden to wear leather shoes on Yom Kippur\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why are we forbidden to wear leather shoes on Yom Kippur?  Is it because leather shoes are a sign of wealth, or comfort; or does it have some thing to do with cruelty to animals?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=6&daf=73b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoma 73b</a>) lists the five obligatory \"afflictions\" (i.e. forbidden pleasures) of Yom Kippur:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Eating and drinking</li>\n<li>Bathing</li>\n<li>Anointing</li>\n<li>Wearing shoes</li>\n<li>Marital relations</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Maimonides, in his commentary on the Mishna, summarizes the Talmudic discussion saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah does not explicitly state the requirement to abstain from these things on the fast of Yom Kippur, but it uses the language of affliction (עינוי) five times... and tradition tells us that this is to prohibit these five forms of physical pleasure... for in Scripture we find that [refraining from] each of these five things is described as affliction....</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With regard to the specific prohibition against wearing shoes, while there is some debate on the topic (see <em>Minchas Chinuch</em> 313:14), the dominant opinion is that \"shoes\" means specifically leather shoes (כל מנעל שאינו של עור לא מיקרי מנעל, see Beis Yosef OC 614), and therefore the prohibition applies only to leather shoes. </p>\n\n<p>For the most part, in virtually all older sources, the discussion ends here, as there was apparently no perceived need to provide a special explanation for the the inclusion of wearing shoes (leather or not) among the required afflictions of Yom Kippur.</p>\n\n<p>Among later sources, however, we do find some additional insights on this topic. Perhaps the most basic explanation is that given by Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in <em>Horeb</em> (in his discussion of the laws of mourning (314:2), which he refers us to in his discussion of the laws of Yom Kippur (158)):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the view of our Sages, the wearing of shoes on our feet betokens equipment for self-supporting activity. Thus, taking off one's shoes on holy ground is ordered several times in the <em>Tenach</em> as a sign of surrendering all one's self and of a complete submission to what is holy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, R' Hirsch does not provide a source for this insight. However, the basic idea, i.e. that shoes symbolize the human capacity for self-sufficient action, can be found in several earlier sources (such as the Abudarham's commentary on the blessing, \"שעשה לי כל צרכי\").</p>\n\n<p>Like R' Hirsch, a number of other commentaries associate the prohibition against wearing shoes on Yom Kippur with the prohibition against wearing shoes in the Temple, arguing that on Yom Kippur the entire earth is sanctified akin to the Temple and we are therefore required to walk barefoot. (R' Moshe Chagiz, cited in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14556&st=&pgnum=344\" rel=\"noreferrer\">many sources</a>, and R' Menachem Mendel of Rimanov, cited in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41176&st=&pgnum=274\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Agnon's <em>Yomim Noraim</em></a> and in Artscroll's <em>Yom Kippur</em>)</p>\n\n<p>The Arizal (in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=3663&st=&pgnum=82\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Shulchan Aruch HaAri</em></a>, cited in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14556&st=&pgnum=344\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Taamei Haminhagim</em></a>) gives an esoteric kabbalistic explanation for why specifically leather shoes are forbidden. The basic point he makes is that leather shoes are associated with the \"garments of skin\" that God gave Adam and Eve after they sinned (Genesis 3:21) (which, according to medrash, were made from the shed skin of the serpent). Leather shoes therefore symbolize sin and impurity, which have no power on Yom Kippur. Thus, we are required to remove these shoes.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in a work titled <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6079&st=&pgnum=308\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Siddur HaMinhagim</em></a> written by Rabbi Shlomo Tzvi Shik in the late 1800's, Rabbi Shik gives two original explanations for the prohibition against leather shoes. </p>\n\n<p>The first, based upon a concept found in the commentary of the Shelah Hakadosh on the blessing \"שעשה לי כל צרכי\", is that leather shoes symbolize man's dominion over all of creation. However, R' Shik argues, a sinner has no such claim of dominion. Thus, on Yom Kippur, when we engage in repentance and confess our sins, we remove our leather shoes to demonstrate our recognition of our sinfulness.</p>\n\n<p>R' Shik's second explanation is based on a custom that when a person would wear a new garment, people would bless him that, \"You should wear it out and get a new one.\" However, some write that one should not say this with regard to a leather garment, as this would require killing an animal and Scripture (Psalms 145:9) states, \"His mercy is upon all His creations.\" Similarly, when slaughtering an animal for the first time, while one does recite the blessings of <em>Shehecheyanu</em> on the <em>mitzva</em> of <em>kisui hadam</em> (covering the blood, assuming it is required, as with a bird), one does not recite <em>Shehecheyanu</em> over the actual slaughtering because, according to some, it involves harming a living creature. Similarly, R' Shik argues, being that Yom Kippur is a day of Divine mercy, it is improper to wear leather shoes.</p>\n\n<p>This latter explanation (which, despite its rather obscure origin, has gained remarkable popularity, mainly because of its inclusion in Agnon's <em>Yomim Noraim</em> (and in the very popular, and heavily abridged, translation, <em>Days of Awe</em>), and, in turn, in many other such collections (including Artscroll's <em>Yom Kippur</em>)) is actually rather difficult in that it would imply that <em>all</em> leather garments should be avoided on Yom Kippur, and there is no such practice (although Agnon does cite <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49438&st=&pgnum=139\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a source</a> that the Terumas HaDeshen, R' Yisrael Isserlein, preferred to avoid wearing any leather garments on Yom Kippur).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>wearing leather footwear is associated with being able to work and provide for one's needs. For this reason we also admit the bracha in the morning, \"...who has provided me with my every need.\" while it isn't done today at one point each of the brachos were said in a certain order and we related to certain articles of clothing with dressing in the morning. Yom kipur is a day in which we don't focus on the gashmyus of life and so we don't do 5 specific things of which wearing leather shoes which are connected to working for a livelihood. </p>\n\n<p>no connection to cruelty to animals. although separately from yom kipur there is a commandment against tzaar baalei chayim and therefore one would not be aloud to produce leather shoes using such a manner. </p>\n\n\n",

A few quotes from the <em>teshuva</em> state:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We acknowledged in our responsum that same-sex intimate relationships are comprehensively <em>banned</em> by classical rabbinic law</p>\n<p><sup> <em>(emphasis theirs)</em></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We concluded that for observant gay and lesbian Jews who would otherwise be condemned to a life of celibacy or secrecy, their human dignity requires suspension of the <em>rabbinic</em> level prohibitions so that they may experience intimacy and create families recognized by the Jewish community.</p>\n<p><sup> <em>(emphasis theirs)</em></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How do these rabbis arrive at the conclusion that homosexual relations are forbidden only on a <em>rabbinic</em> level? How do they explain the verse in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0318.htm#22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 18:22</a>?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאֶת זָכָר לֹא תִשְׁכַּב מִשְׁכְּבֵי אִשָּׁה תּוֹעֵבָה הִוא:‏</p>\n<p>Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind; it is abomination.

(How they deal with the issue of השחתת זרע לבטלה is less clear, which is likely why it was relegated to an extended footnote, #47.)</p>\n\n\n",

He suggested that it was considered an oral work until Rasag decided it was necessary to set the nusach and physically write it down. So it's possible that such was also the case of Megillat Taanit: Though mentioned in various sources, it may have never been a physical text until perhaps the Talmudic or post-Talmudic period (when we find it mentioned in the gemara and other sources, and eventually have standalone manuscripts of it).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Though given that there weren't any codices (=books as we have them today with covers and pages) at the time and all books were actually scrolls, papyri, and, more rarely, inscriptions, I'm not sure what he meant exactly by this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>American Jewish historian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Zeitlin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Solomon Zeitlin</a> has written a book on Megillas Ta'anis titled <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/megillattaanitas00zeituoft/page/6/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Megillat Taanit as a source for Jewish chronology and history in the Hellenistic and Roman periods</em></a>. Encyclopedia Judaica article <em>Megillat Ta'anit</em> on p.769 gives the following short summary of the book conclusions relevant to the the OP's question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MEGILLAT TA’ANIT (Heb. lit. “scroll of fasting” but see below), a list of 36 days on which there were significant victories and happy events in the history of the Jews during the Second Temple, as a result of which the rabbis forbade fasting on them, as well as, in some cases, the delivery of memorial addresses for the dead (<em>hespedim</em>). The title should therefore be taken as meaning “the scroll of (the days of <em>prohibited</em>) fasting.” The work received its present form close to the time of the destruction of the Second Temple or at the latest during the Bar Kokhba era. It is written in Aramaic and with extreme brevity. According to a tannaitic source (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.13b.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 13b</a>), it was compiled by “Chananiah b. Chezekiah (b. Garon) and his company,” but the appendix to the megillah gives the author as Eliezer, the son of this Hananiah, one of the leading rebels against the Romans (Josephus, Wars, 2:409).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megillat_Taanit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wikipedia article</a> further notes that Eliezer b. Chananiah did not, however, complete the work. Several non-fast days were subsequently added to the list, which was definitively closed in Usha at the time of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_ben_Gamaliel_II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</a> (second), who was the <em>nassi</em> in Usha, so no further memorial days might be added.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Solomon Zeitlin regards it as a literary remnant of the rebel party. If this is accepted, <strong>the purpose of the list of victories was to strengthen the spirit of heroism and faith in the success of the revolt</strong>. The value of the megillah for historical research lies in the parallels it provides to the facts and dates mentioned in Josephus. In the period following the conclusion of the Talmud a scholium was appended to the megillah, written in mishnaic Hebrew and based upon the Hebrew original of I Maccabees, the talmudic literature, and various oral traditions unknown from any other source. The historical value of this appendix is limited. In the course of time copyists and editors added notes and explanations, taken in particular from the Babylonian Talmud, so that two versions evolved, a Sephardi and an Italian.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The text of the Megillas Ta'anis was finalized in Usha, when Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel was a nassi. Rabban Shimon was also a one of the teachers of his son Rabbeinu haKadosh who arranged the mishnah. As we know, other teachers of Rabbeinu haKadosh <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/146272/36610\">were sages of the Rabban Shimon's generation</a>. Regarding that generation, the Iggeres  of Rav Sherira Gaon, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Epistle_of_Rav_Sherira_Gaon.1.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 2 The Oral Law before Rebbe</a> notes  (transation of R' N. D. Rabinowich):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During all these years [the sages] clarified all the laws which had left unresolved in the academies due to the great loss that took place because of the Temple's destruction and the unresolved halakhic questions that had arisen during those troubled and confused times. All the halakhic disputes that had come to the existence during the three (preceeding) generations were decided. The individual and majority opinions were made known after our sages had diligently and completely analyzed and invertigated them. They thoroughly examined the traditions and mishnayos in order to establish the correct version. They did not add to the earlier teachings of the Men of the Great Assembly. But they toied mightily and examined the material until they understood  what the earlier masters had said and practiced. Thus they finally resolved all their doubts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, it is fitting to say that <em>Megillas Ta'anis</em> as a source documenting miracles was finalized during this time. Such a dating is also based on the latest date mentioned in the megillah, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillat_Ta%27anit%2C_Adar.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">28th of Adar</a>, when the harsh Hadrianic decrees were anulled (according to Zeitlin, originally it referred to the day when Antiochus V made peace with the Jews). The actual text might have been produced much later.</p>\n<p>Additionally, since Rabbeinu haKadosh edited the Mishnah based on the work of the teachers from the generation of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, we ought to conclude, that the decision to codify the Oral Law was made already during Rabban Shimon's time, as each of the 13 teachers developed their own all-encompassing approach to the Oral Law. In this respect, Megillas Taanis presents a document recording of miracles and halakhic decision regarding non-fasting that all sages could have agreed upon already during Rabban Shimon's time.</p>\n\n\n",

We do have older books containing the text of the Torah, or even the TaNaKh, and of course the Dead Sea Scrolls represent a very ancient tradition for almost the entire TaNaKh. The article itself explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The find isn't the oldest Torah text in the world. The Leningrad and the Aleppo bibles - both of them Hebrew codexes, or books - pre-date the Bologna scroll by more than 200 years. But this is the oldest Torah scroll [according to the professor].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are many reasons why Torah scrolls haven't survived... Many were no doubt destroyed in the various times when Jewish communities were being persecuted. And in any case parchment texts will decay and wear out with age and regular use. Since it is common practice to bury a ripped or worn out Torah scroll, it is rare for scrolls to be preserved for more than a few hundred years. This one is certainly a marvelous find!</p>\n\n\n",

In  Shmuel which we read on Rosh HaShanah, Channah,cannot have a child cries also a second Parsha read on rosh Hashanah in Breishes Hagar (also bad but not as bad) a mother cant watch Yishmael die from lack of water, walks away and cries.So why is it we use this Evil women who was calmed by the other women when told dont worry he is just busy raping and hence has not returned ? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>1) I've heard in the name of Rabbi Naftali Peterburger that the crying of Sisera's mother was motivated by, and therefore symbolizes, a feeling which is especially apt for Rosh Hashanah: She was fairly confident that her son was victorious, and yet at the same time there was also a growing, gnawing doubt - maybe he had been defeated? So too on Rosh Hashanah, though we outwardly show confidence that we will be judged favorably, we are reminded by the number of blasts that a successful outcome is not assured.</p>\n\n<p>2) Yad Aharon (692) quotes Rav Shmuel Abuhav that the word '<em>Sisera</em>' in Tosfos (R.H. 33b, which is the source for the Sisera connection) is a mistake, and was originally '<em>yenukah</em>'. It is based on the Midrash in Emor that a woman giving birth cries 100 times. This answers another problem with Tosfos as well: there is no source anywhere that Sisera's mother cried 100 times.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Pruzanzky <a href=\"https://rabbipruzansky.com/2015/09/11/the-sobbing-mother-of-sisera/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quotes</a> Rav Soloveitchik (who I just heard today was referencing Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Soloveitchik explained\n  that Sisera’s mother had a routine. She knew he would win, even knew\n  when to expect him back from the battlefield. She knew that he would\n  return triumphant, with the spoils of war, with the laurels of his\n  admirers, with the dread of the vanquished. She was certain – that was\n  her life.</p>\n  \n  <p>“The mother of Sisera sat by the window, gazing through the lattices…”\n  As she sat there, she started to sob, then to wail, then to mourn. Her\n  certainty – about herself, about her son, about his and her destiny –\n  was an illusion. It wasn’t real. As she uttered the words – “Why does\n  his chariot tarry in coming? Why is he late today?” – she already knew\n  the bitter truth: her world had suddenly changed. There is nothing in\n  life set in stone. Not my life, not my choices, not my fate...</p>\n  \n  <p>The shofar draws its inspiration not from the anguish of Sisera’s\n  mother, and not because we feel sorry for her, but because we want the\n  shofar to awaken us, to shake us, like it did Sisera’s mother, to grab\n  hold of us and say “life is precious, life is short, there is much to\n  do.” Take nothing for granted, not the least of which one’s religious\n  level in life and one’s aspirations.

Ramban says mentioning the olah suffices so we know all the Rosh Chodesh musafim were offered. Chizkuni says the chatat of Rosh Chodesh atones for different types of sin than the chatat of Rosh Hashana so would be inappropriate to mention in the same breath.</p>\n\n<p>But the interesting opinion is that of Rabbeinu Meshulam (a student and contemporary of Rabbeinu Tam) who claims the Torah purposely omitted the chatat of Rosh Chodesh, because the Talmud states that it is brought to atone for Hashem for him making the moon smaller than the sun, and we do not want to mention this on Rosh Hashana. Rabbeinu Tam strongly opposed his opinion and added the mentioning of the chatat in the davening, which as you noted is our custom to this day.

Rather, David said: When the righteous die [in this case Shaul and Yonasan], the enemies of Israel come and harass Israel. [David indeed had to prepare his  bow and practice with it, and he was lamenting the deaths of Shaul and Yonasan that led to this].</p>\n<p>\"Behold it is written in the Sefer HaYashar (the Virtuous Book, i.e. the Torah).\" There are two opinions on what this is. One says it is the Book of B'reishis [which details the lives of our virtuous forefathers -Rashi], and the other says it is the Chomesh Pikudim (i.e. the Book of B'midbar).</p>\n<p>QUESTION: The opinion that it refers to B'reishis makes sense [since Yehuda is described there as having his hand on the neck of his enemies, which is a mandate for David to prepare for war -Korban HaEdah commentary]. But what war is found in the Book of B'midbar [that serves as a precedent for David needing to prepare for war under those circumstances]?</p>\n<p>ANSWER: \"And the Children of Israel travelled from Be'eros B'nei Ya'akan to Moserah. There Aharon died\" (D'varim 10). <b>But did Aharon really die in Moseros? He actually died at Hor HaHar</b>, as is written, \"And they ascended to Hor HaHar… and Aharon died there\" (B'midbar 20). Rather, when Aharon died, the clouds of Glory [that had henceforth protected Israel in Aharon's merit] departed, and the Canaanites sought to attack Israel, as is written [immediately after Aharon's death], \"And the Canaanite King of Arad dwelling in the Negev heard that Israel came by way of Asarim [and he waged war against Israel]\" (ibid. 21).</p>\n<p>What is \"by way of Asarim\"? [The King of Arad] heard that Aharon, who was their great guide for them on the way, died (Asarim could be read to mean \"guidings\". \"Let us come and attack them,\" [the King of Arad said]. <b>And Israel sought to return to Egypt, and they travelled backwards through eight locations</b> [including their present location and their destination location], and the tribe of Levi pursued them and killed eight families of them, and they killed four families of Levi, as is written (Chronicles I 26), \"Of the Amramites, of Yitzhar, of the Chevronites, of the Uzielites.\" When did they return? In the days of David, as is written (Psalms 72) \"The righteous shall flower in his days.\" They said, \"What caused us all this bloodshed?\" They answered, \"Because we did not perform chesed for that tzadik [Aharon].\" And they went and eulogized him and they performed chesed for that tzadik. <b>And the verse treated it for them as if he died there and was buried there, where they did chesed for that tzadik.</b></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>See Rashi, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9974#showrashi=true&v=6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 10:6</a>, who explains pretty much the same thing the Yerushalmi in @Fred's answer says, but adds that this was part of the rebuke that Moshe gave the Jews:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>And the children of Israel journeyed from the wells of B’nei Ya’akan to Moserah</strong>: What is the relevance of this here? Furthermore, did they really journey from the wells of B’nei Ya’akan to Moserah? Was it not from Moserah that they came to the wells of B’nei Ya’akan, as it is said, “And they journeyed from Moseroth [and encamped in B’nei Ya’akan]” (Num. 33:31) ? Moreover, [why does it say:] “there Aaron died”? Did he not die at Mount Hor? If you calculate it, you will find eight stations from Moseroth to Mount Hor!</p>\n<p>However, [the answer is that] this is also part of the reproof [introduced in Deut. 1:1 and continued through here]: [In effect Moses said,] This, also, you did. When Aaron died on Mount Hor at the end of the forty years and [consequently] the clouds of the Divine Glory departed, you were afraid of the [impending] war with the king of Arad. So you appointed a leader to return to Egypt, and you went back eight stations until B’nei Ya’akan, and from there to Moserah. There, the sons of Levi battled with you. They slew some of you, and you some of them, until they forced you to return by the way you had retreated. From there, you returned to Gudgodah, which is Hor Hagidgad (Num. 33:32).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I have seen some prayer leaders, seemingly on purpose, wait until the <em>aron</em> was closed before beginning <em>kadish</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, during <em>s'lichos</em>, immediately after \"<em>Sh'ma kolenu</em>\" (for which the <em>aron</em> is open) comes <em>viduy</em>, and I have seen some people, seemingly on purpose, wait until the <em>aron</em> was closed before beginning it.</p>\n\n<p>Why wait?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>\"Wait until the Aron is closed\" - I suspect it's for practical reasons; at some points in the services, people will sit down (e.g. Tachanun) at the next prayer, and they ideally should remain standing while the Aron is open, so we wait. Another practicality is you can offend the poor confused fellow who's been honored with closing the Aron by starting the next piece and making him feel like he missed the boat.</p>\n\n<p>Overall it's just a decorum/choreography thing. Prayer A, ark is open. Okay people see the ark close, time for Prayer B.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Shulchon Aruch Orach Chaim Siman 268 S'eef 2,when discussing the Tefilos on Shabbos, says \"אם טעה והתחיל תפלת חול גומר אותה ברכה\",meaning that if someone started saying one of the weekday Brochos in Shemona Esrai he should already finish it. Why? Since in truth we should said the weekday Berochos on Shabbos (on Shabbos we also need Daas \"אם אין דעת הבדלה הבדלה מנין\").</p>\n\n<p>The Chachomim,however,in order not to strain us too much on Shabbos chose to skip them .However if you started one of them already then finish it and with Kovono.    </p>\n\n<p>Now let us turn to the issue at hand,but not without first citing the' Levush'in OC siman 133 who lets us in on the secret of what transpires upon the opening of the Aron.\"שהוא לנו במקום ביאת מקדש לפני ולפנים\" WOW! WE ARE IN THE KODSHAI HAKODOSHIM!</p>\n\n<p>Now, returning to the point,if someone were to start saying Ashrei when the Aron is still open then it would be correct to finish the entire Ashrei with the Aron open, as Ashrei in the Bais Hamikdash לפני ולפנים is 'What An Opportunity',and so much more powerful and ideal,and the only reason we keep the Aron closed  the entire  Davening is simply because we are not ready to behave the entire time in the manner that would be due in such a lofty place.But if you started then finish it in the ideal place it should be said.Therefor people had a Minhag not to start Ashrai in the first place cto avoid running into the issue of needing to finish it with the Aron open.  </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion we don't want to start another section with the Aron open, so as not to dilute the feeling of the Kodesh Kodoshim(that one can say anything without paying attention)and so that one would not have to finish the next section with it open.</p>\n\n<p>let us from now on realize where we are standing when the Aron is open and act accordingly. </p>\n\n\n",

Yet we find no mention in <em>halacha</em> of <em>hataras n'darim</em> or finding a <em>pesach</em> or specifying \"<em>b'li neder</em>\" about <em>pas palter</em> in the ten days of return.

    "content": "# Shofar from an extinct animal\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>After paying a trip to the Natural History Museum in London I found myself wondering... would it be allowed (to any extent) to use a shofar of an animal that has kosher simanim but is extinct? There were a number of horned ram/antelope-like species that appeared to have split hooves and, given their closeness to kosher shofar animals in terms of how they were classified and appeared, would it be allowed to use their horns as a shofar? Is it too great of an assumption that they chewed the cud?</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, if timescales for fossilisation allows, would it be muttar to use a fossilised horn that is intact?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The mitzvah of blowing shofar is m'Doraita, meaning from the written Torah. (VaYikra 23:24 and VaYikra 25:9) This has the implication that in questions regarding it's fulfillment, one should be stringent. In other words, one should be stringent, for example, that what you are blowing is in fact a kosher shofar. </p>\n\n<p>There are requirements on the horn itself and the animal which it comes from. See the following sources for details: Rosh Hashanah 26a and in Shulchan Aruch (and Shulchan Aruch Harav) Orach Chaim chapter 586. The following is a link providing a brief discussion of this subject:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/618,457071/Is-any-horn-fit-to-be-kosher-Shofar.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/618,457071/Is-any-horn-fit-to-be-kosher-Shofar.html</a></p>\n\n<p>In regard to the animal, it must be from a kosher animal, either behemah or chayah. But that presents an interesting question in terms of contemporary practice. In regard to the written Torah, it defines a kosher animal (mammal) as any animal with fully split hooves and that chews its cud (Is a ruminant.). (See VaYikra 11:1-3)</p>\n\n<p>The practical side of this in regard to your question is that although you may be able to determine that the hooves are clearly split. It would not be possible to determine from an extinct animal with certainty that it was a ruminant. The Torah gives examples of animals that look like they are ruminants, but that are not. Since in the case of shofar you would be required to be stringent in your decision, on this alone, the extinct animal horn would likely be disqualified. For interesting details about the potential problems with these simanim, see the following link:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daatemet.org/articles/article.cfm?article_id=13\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.daatemet.org/articles/article.cfm?article_id=13</a></p>\n\n<p>But for some, there is even another consideration.</p>\n\n<p>Behemot are that class of animal that may be used as an offering in the Temple. Generally these are the herded animals mentioned in Torah, cows, sheep and goats. The horns of cows are specifically not allowed for use as a shofar.</p>\n\n<p>Chayot on the other hand are definitely kosher animals. But according to some minhagim, like those who follow the Chazon Ish and possibly the Siftei Kohen, the simanim cannot be relied upon in this generation. Only chayot about which we have a definite mesorah are considered kosher for actual use and consumption. For people required to follow those minhagim, only the horns of chayot that have a definite mesorah as being kosher would be permissible for use.</p>\n\n<p>Again, in the case of the extinct animal, this would exclude their usage.</p>\n\n<p>For a very good discussion of the details surrounding this subject, see the following link:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=8475\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=8475</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Chaza\"l ensured us that if an animal has split hooves and are not pigs (who don't have horns) then they chew cud.</p>\n\n<p>So, if the horn is a <em>shofar</em> (not a <em>keren</em>, e.g from a cow), and it is still in kosher condition, it would be permitted.</p>\n\n<p><sup>(Assuming that only the animal was technically fossilized, but the horn is still made of the original material.)</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>If the horn comes from one of the animals the Torah lists as Kosher, and the type of horn is halachikly defined as a Shofar, then it would be good. If not, it won't be good. </p>\n\n<p>See Devarim 14:4... And see Rashi, who learns the Torah to be saying that they are the only Kosher animals. </p>\n\n\n",

As Rashi (<em>B'reishis</em> 33:18-20) points out, when Yaakov encamped in this new locale, he also enhanced it (the Hebrew words for \"encamp\" and \"beautify\" share the same root); when he purchased land, he also improved it (\"purchase\" and \"improve\" share the same root in Hebrew). </p>\n\n<p>So it appears that we should maintain our environment and certainly not destroy it.

I would like to know if there are any authorities who cite this definition l'halacha and what the implications might be. For example if a person has a relative who converts to Christianity (חס ושלום) upon the death of that relative must that person not  mourn, but assume festive garments and rejoice (Yoreh De'ah, 345)?</p>\n\n<p>Please note I realize that the term מין can and perhaps does apply to other categories of people as well.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Several academic surveys study the term <em>min</em> (1),(2),(3). In general, the term means <em>heretic</em>. When trying to identify the groups espousing the term <em>minim</em>, many possible representatives have been suggested: Gnostics, Christians (primarily of Jewish origin), members of Greco-Roman religions, Samaritans, Saducees, or supporters of Roman rule. Most scholars now agree that the term <em>min</em> or <em>minim</em> in rabbinic literature cannot be easily applied to a specific non-rabbinic group. As stated by by the scholar Marcel Simon in the book <em><a href=\"https://www.magnespress.co.il/en/book/Verus_Israel-2662\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Verus Israel: Study of the Relations Between Christians and Jews in the Roman Empire, AD 135-425</a></em>, p.181-182,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(The words) <em>min</em> and <em>minim</em> never meant any particular sect. <em>Minim</em> designated simply any dissident body, whatever its particular characteristics, which rejected in any respect the thought or practice of Jewish orthodoxy ... A designation as elastic as the term <em>minim</em> could well cover, at different times and in different places, very different things, and it is likely  that the precise meaning will never be beyond the dispute.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to determine whether a particular group of stories represents a certain dissident group, one needs to fully understand the religious views of the groups. Such studies have been undertaken in the Academic world. For example, the book by Michal Bar-Asher Segal (3) identified a small group of minim stories as representing rabbinic discussions of internal arguments and readings that simultaneously occured among the Christian sects. The identification was made possible after analysis of the Christian texts from late antiquity. Her conclusion is that while the stories present the inter-faith dialogs and interactions, in reality these dialogs were unlikely to take place. Rather, due to close proximity that Jews and Christians lived in Bavel, people in the market expressed their views, which served as a basis for the rabbis to expound the fundamentals of the Jewish faith.</p>\n<p>The stories in the Talmud reflect the religious picture, which existed in late antiquity and are not precise representatives of modern monotheistic religions, such as Christianity.

Therefore, recitation or omission of this blessing by the prayer leader seems to no longer serve as a signal for whether he is a heretic (or does it? If so, please explain).</p>\n<p>Further, it seems likely that a large class of modern heretics would even be willing to recite variants of the blessing that explicitly refer to heretics.</p>\n<p>So why do modern <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1428/1442\"><em>poskim</em></a> still rule that a prayer leader must be removed for omitting the blessing of <em>V'lamalshinim</em> in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>amida</em></a>?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(<em>Note: Answers that can sufficiently rebut any assumptions made in this post are welcome</em>).</p>\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=29&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>B'rachos</em> 29a</a>) teaches:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Y'huda said in the name of Rav: If [a prayer leader] erred in any of the blessings [of the <em>amida</em>], we do not remove him.

We remove him because we suspect he may be a heretic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%9B%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 126:1</a>) codifies as <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/597\"><em>halacha</em></a> that we remove a prayer leader who entirely omitted the blessing of <em>V'lamalshinim</em>. The <em>L'vush</em> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14586&st=&pgnum=75\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">126</a>) explains that we are concerned that the reason he omitted <em>V'lamalshinim</em> is that he is actually a heretic and \"he does not want to curse himself.\" This is based on the commentary of <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em> on the <em>Rif</em> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37952&st=&pgnum=361\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>B'rachos</em> 19b in <em>dapei haRif</em></a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>טעה בברכת המינין מעלין אותו דחיישי' שמא מין הוא ומה שלא אמרו שאם טעה ולא הזכיר תחיית המתים שמעלין אותו ג\"כ מפני שברכת המינין יש בה קללה למינין וכשאינו אומר אותה אנו חוששין <strong>שמפני שהוא מין אינו רוצה לקלל את עצמו</strong> אבל בברכת תחיית המתים כיון שאין בה קללה אין בזה היכר אם הוא מין או לא שאפשר שאפי' שלא יאמין הוא בתחיית המתים עכ\"ז יאמר הברכה דמאי איכפת ליה אם יאמר מחיה המתים כיון שאינו מקלל עצמו הלכך כיון שאיפשר שיאמר אותה ויהיה מין ולא נוכל להכיר אותו אפי' כשלא אמר אותה אין מעלין אותו</p>\n<p>עוד נוכל לומר שבתחיית המתים כשטעה אין מעלין אותו מפני שאפשר שהוא מין ומאמין בתחיית המתים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above commentary suggests that a heretic does not want to curse himself, but he is willing to recite other blessings that are at odds with his beliefs.</p>\n<p>Questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>According to <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D#.D7.A0.D7.95.D7.A1.D7.97_.D7.94.D7.91.D7.A8.D7.9B.D7.94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>nusach Ashkenaz</em></a>, which doesn't mention heretics explicitly in the blessing, why would a heretic avoid reciting this blessing?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Even the other variants of the prayer that mention <em>minim</em> (heretics) do not specify particular beliefs or groups (e.g. Sadducees, Boethusians, or Therapeutae).

Why, then, would he balk at using the generic term for heretic in the prayer?

The <em>Magein Avraham</em> (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x490\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">126:1</a>) is likewise unsure whether a prayer leader must be removed if he mentions <em>malshinim</em> but excludes mention of heretics, though the <em>Magein Avraham</em> mentions that the <em>nusach</em> of Romania includes only <em>v'lamalshinim</em>.</p>\n<p>The <em>Magein Giborim</em> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9312&st=&pgnum=111\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">126:1</a>) expresses surprise that the <em>Magein Avraham</em> didn't mention that this is our <em>nusach</em>, too. The <em>Magein Giborim</em> seems to conclude (if I'm understanding it right) that it is forbidden to deviate from our <em>nusach</em> of <em>v'lamalshinim</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומהתימא שלא כתב שמנהגנו הוא לומר ולמלשינים כבני רומניא ועכ\"פ לשנות הנוסח' בברכה זו ודאי אסור</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Aderet, however, comments that this is a mistaken <em>nusach</em>, and advises that people switch back to another version in their silent <em>amida</em> that includes reference to either <em>lam'shumadim</em> or <em>lakofrim</em> (<em>T'fillas David</em> §13, cited <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49197&st=&pgnum=831\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). Even the Aderet, though, says that a prayer leader should adhere to the accepted <em>nusach</em> in public to avoid leading to a radical fragmentation in community practice based on what each individual thinks is appropriate (\"שלא לתת שתהיה תורה ביד כל אחד\").</p>\n<p>The <em>Mishna B'rura</em> (ibid.) says that a prayer leader is not removed for using the <em>nusach</em> of <em>v'lamalshinim</em> that excludes mention of heretics, because there are places where this is an established <em>nusach</em>.</p>\n<p>In any case, by the standard described in the above commentary of the <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em>, who reject the notion quoted by the <em>Tur</em> (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x271\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">126</a>) in the name of the <em>Y'rushalmi</em> (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/r/r1105.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>B'rachos</em> 5:3</a>, \"לכל אין מחזירין אותו חוץ ממי שלא אמר מחיה המתים ומכניע זדים ובונה ירושלים אני אומר מין הוא\") that someone omitting תחיית המתים should also be removed, it would seem that modern Ashkenazim should no longer remove prayer leaders who skip the entire blessing of <em>V'lamalshinim</em>. This is because its recitation would not indicate that the prayer leader is a believer (per the rationale of \"אין בזה היכר אם הוא מין או לא\" that the <em>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah</em> commentary gives to explain the implicit ruling in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud#Talmud_Bavli_.28Babylonian_Talmud.29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Bavli</em></a> that omission of the <em>T'chiyas HaMeisim</em> blessing would not be cause to remove a prayer leader).</p>\n<p>Additionally, per <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/31023\">Dave's answer</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/30988/does-the-ashkenazi-nusach-of-vlamalshinim-imply-a-curse-against-heretics?rq=1#comment79462_30994\">Shmuel Brin's comment</a>, it's possible that this problem would apply nowadays even to <em>nuscha'os</em> that explicitly mention heretics (unless offense rather than fear would still motivate modern heretics to omit this blessing).</p>\n<p>So why is the <em>halacha</em> to remove a prayer leader who omits the blessing of <em>V'lamalshinim</em> still applicable?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The question is based on an anachronistic assumption about the nature of heresy, specifically that heresy makes you less likely to consider curses potent and harmful. </p>\n\n<p>That's probably true of a cross-section of today's heretics, who tend toward atheism. And if you exclude religion, modern rationalism allows no other means by which curses could work. </p>\n\n<p>In the past, however, heretics (and certainly the minim addressed by the beracha) were religious, just not in a way we approve of. And even if a heretic was irreligious, he'd still be subject to garden-variety superstition. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>1) Even though nusach Ashkenaz does not mention heretics explicitly, this is because of modification due to censors. At the time of the gemara, certainly the bracha had laminim as part of it.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFwIXdJzUIzguwlqEBTANFfutNrAe1_4ozawiN9gxNw/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>”Velamalshinim”= We should have in mind the historical significance of the prayer. Originally the word “velamalshinim” read “velaminim,” but the Christain censors, who were originally “targeted” by the Bracha, actually changed. It’s important to realize that our prayer has historical significance. (Artscroll Mesorah)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>2) Your question has the answer as part of it. Yes, since the audience would know what minim were, and the text of the blessing was composed with Sadducees in mind, a Sadducee (or an early Jewish Christian, e.g.) would understand this as the meaning of the prayer, and would balk at reciting this blessing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The slander which we are referring to when praying for the downfall of 'the slanderers' is specifically the slander said against the Torah being God given.</p>\n\n<p>We are not praying for the downfall of the co-worker who slandered you to your boss, or people who slandered Jews to the Romans or anything like that. No matter what the censors were hoping to imply with their new word. It is referring to the slander against the Torah, which means these slanderers are minim, and the bracha means the same thing as if it said minim, no matter how you look at it. At least according to the popular minhag to keep the nusach as is.</p>\n\n<p>Now you will ask, but maybe the shliach tzibur thought it meant a regular slanderer, like you're co-worker, and by skipping it he not shown any signs of heresy. To this the answer is, could be, we don't know, and we don't need to know with any degree of certainty that he is in fact a heretic. We remove him as being a suspect heretic, as we see all the language used is he is suspect. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do we honor Gedalia, who was condemned for murder, with a fast day?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedaliah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gedaliah</a> was informed that Yishmael ben Nesania was going to try to kill him. He ignored this, thinking it a lie (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16037#v=16\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 40:16</a>). Because of this mistake, the Torah (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16038#v=9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 41:9</a>) attributes Yishmael's murders to Gedalia (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=37&daf=61&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nidah 61a</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Yet we fast on the day of his death, and not just because of the massacre that took place, or the loss of what little self-governance was left. We call the fast day \"The Fast of Gedaliah,\" not \"The Third of Tishrei.\" Furthermore, Gedaliah's death is equated to the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=18b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 18b</a>). </p>\n\n<p>Why is Gedaliah given such great honor and recognition? Seemingly, G-d (and the Rabbis) didn't think too highly of him at all. We honor him with a fast day named for him; the only person in fact, besides Esther, to have this honor, which not even the greatest of the Neviim and Nesiim have.</p>\n\n<p>Any insight?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21527&st=&pgnum=32\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Maharsha</em> (<em>Rosh HaShana</em> 18b, s.v. <em>U'mee harago</em>)</a><sup>1</sup>, on the premise that Gedalya was in fact righteous, addresses the remaining question of why, if HaShem considers the death of a righteous person to be as calamitous as the burning of the Temple, we only have a fast day to commemorate Gedalya's death and not the death of other righteous people. </p>\n\n<p>The <em>Maharsha</em> answers that the day that Gedalya was killed is exceptional since he was murdered by Yishma'el, a fellow Jew, during the Ten Days of Repentance (when Jews should especially repent and certainly not commit grievous sins as did Yishma'el). More significantly, as a result of Gedalya's death, the Jewish people remaining in Judea fled from the Land of Israel to Egypt, transgressing Yirmiyahu's warning that they would be annihilated if they did so (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1142.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Yimiyahu</em> 42:7-22</a>). </p>\n\n<p>To quote R' Eliyahu Kitov: \"With Gedalyah's death, the last ember of Jewish autonomy in the aftermath of the destruction of the first Beis ha-Mikdash was extinguished. Thousands were killed, and those who remained alive were driven into exile.... Thus, the remnant that had been left in the land was dispersed and the land was left desolate\" (<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=gISl55geRaAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Book of Our Heritage</em>, vol. 1, pp. 47-48</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, although we fast over the tragedy caused by the death of Gedalya, the fast is named after him to illustrate the point made by the Talmud in the passage to which you refer (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=18b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Rosh HaShana</em> 18b</a>), that HaShem considers the death of the righteous to be as serious as the burning of the Temple. As the <em>Maharsha</em> notes, it is impractical to fast over the death of every righteous person, since that would require a daily fast. However, since we fast anyway, the fast is named such as to show us that it is theoretically fitting to fast over the death of the righteous just as we actually fast over the destruction of the Temple.</p>\n\n<p>I'll leave it to another poster to address the question of Gedalya's personal righteousness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1: About midway down the first block of text, towards the end of the line.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

Bath. <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=bava_basra&daf=16b&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow\">16b</a>). Pirkei D'Rebbi Eliezer, ch. 30 relates the following, which could suggest that his repentance happened in the desert:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"In the merit of Abraham, the water skin did not lack water. And when she, (Hagar), reached the desert, she began to stray after the idols of her father's house, and immediately the water was missing from the water skin, therefore she cast the lad. And 24 Years was Ishmael when he left the house of Abraham and Isaac was 10... And the soul of Ishmael became tired from thirst, <strong>he went and cast him self beneath the thorns of the desert and said Master of the world, if there is before you a will to give me to drink water, give me to drink so that my spirit will not leave me in thirst</strong>, for strange is death from thirst, and it is more difficult than all deaths. And Gd heard his prayer...\"</em> </p>\n\n<p>Further in the chapter, Ishmael is said to divorce his first wife for not offering an anonymous Abraham food and water when he comes to visit his son, which suggests that in the very least he was hospitable after this repentance and its acceptance by Gd.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Ishmael was wicked or guilty, but was not of punishable age. Above, he is listed as 24, but in the Zohar part 1, 118b:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"See, they preserved him/established it,</em> (aramaic word אוקמוה‏), <em>that he was not of punishable age by the Upper Court, because the Lower Court punishes from thirteen years and up, <strong>and the Upper Court from twenty years and onward</strong>, and even though he was wicked/guilty,</em> (aramaic word חייבא‏), <strong><em>he was not of punishable age</strong>, and see they preserved him/established it, and that is what is written 'as he is there', (Gen <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0121.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">21:17</a>)\".</em></p>\n\n<p>So in the Upper Court, where Ishmael was being judged, his wicked deeds did not lead to his guilt or punishment, because he was <em>less</em> than twenty years old, which was not old enough to be held responsible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Also</strong>, the Targum [pseudo] Jonathan on Gen 21:17 says that Gd spared Ishmael because of the merit of Abraham.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, he was \"righteous\" for one of three reasons:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>He repented.</li>\n<li>He was not of punishable age so his sins were not counted against him.</li>\n<li>His father's merit was invoked on his behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I read once from a reliable source (forgot where) \"he was righteous\" means in a relative sense, i.e. regarding this particular judgment that he was being judged in of whether he should die or not - but not that he was righteous in a general sense.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To answer as to how yishmael was judged favorably with God's strick justice, simply look at the Yonah reading. At first it is the merciful Name used to warn Nineveh to repent, but after they repent, it is God's strick justice Name used. Thus even Elohim accepts repentance.</p>\n\n\n",

(See, for example, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/11733/1659\">this answer</a>.) My question is specifically about the Mishna, Yoma 8:7.</p>\n\n<p>The mishna in question reads as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מי שנפלה עליו מפלת, ספק הוא שם ספק אינו שם, ספק חי ספק מת, ספק נכרי\n  ספק ישראל - מפקחין עליו את הגל. מצאוהו חי - מפקחין עליו, ואם מת -\n  יניחוהו</p>\n  \n  <p>If a wall falls on somebody [on Shabbat] and it is uncertain whether\n  or not he is there, whether he is alive or dead, or whether or not he\n  is Jewish, we remove the rubble from him. If he is found to be alive,\n  we continue removing it from him, but if he is dead we leave him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the removal of rubble constitutes an activity that may be prohibited on Shabbat (perhaps the possibility of carrying four cubits in a public place), we don't do it if the only purpose it serves is to honour the dead. But in the event that it might enable us to save somebody's life (even if only for the briefest moment - Bartenura), we set aside Shabbat for the purpose of excavation.</p>\n\n<p>It seems fairly obvious to me that the mishna's threefold formulation (there or not, alive or dead, Jew or gentile) is one in which the latter provisos would each render the search unnecessary if all doubt concerning them was removed. So, for example, if it is known <em>for certain</em> that the person is dead, we do not search through the rubble. If it is known <em>for certain</em> that the person is not there, we do not search through the rubble. If it is known <em>for certain</em> that the person is not Jewish, is not the implication likewise that we do not search through the rubble?</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>Note</strong>: I reiterate that I am not asking a question about the halakha. The halakha mandates of us that we save a non-Jew's life on Shabbat. I am asking only about the correct historical interpretation of this mishna.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The question is based on contemporary belief but in truth according to the strict letter of Halacha saving a non-Jews life on Shabbos by doing a Melacha (forbidden acts) is not permitted; I'll simply quote the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 92:1 who says \"Shabbos is pushed aside for Sakonas Nefoshos (life & death situations).. therefore it is a Mitzvah to desecrate Shaboss for a <strong>Kosher</strong> person (even if he sometimes does sins) who is in mortal danger\" (See also the uncensored Shulchan Aruch Yore Dei'ah 158:1).</p>\n\n<p>The link (in the question) that tries to portray a resounding 'yes', misrepresented R. M. Feinstein's words by saying \"To quote R' Moshe Feinsten, \"A refusal to treat a non-Jew on the Sabbath would be totally unacceptable...\", the impression is that is is <strong>Halachikly</strong> unacceptable when in reality he's saying that it is socially unacceptable. In the Teshuvah itself RMF says to try to avoid the situation and he's only talking about a doctor who by law has the obligation to heal the sick or otherwise face repercussions. in the end he concludes with the words \"one can rule that it (inaction by a doctor) is like a Sakanah (danger) and therefore one may permit it\". - This is a far cry from \"halakha mandates of us that we save a non-Jew's life on Shabbat\".</p>\n\n<p>For a short synopsis of some of that link's \"sources\" see Shearim Metzuyanim Bahalacha 92:1, 1) He brings an argument between the Pri Megadim who says we do not desecrate Shabbos for one who doesn't keep Shabbos Litai'ovon (for convenience reasons) and the Maharam Shik who is not sure about it. 2) He quotes the Pri Megadim who says that we do not desecrate Shabbos for a non-Jew and for one who doesn't keep Shabbos Lihach'is ('to anger G-d'). 3) He quotes the Chassam Sofer who says it is <strong>probably</strong> Halachakly permissible nowadays to ride in a wagon driven by a non-Jew to heal a non-Jew since inaction will cause the non-Jews to hate us for it and it may lead to danger for Jews. 4) He quotes the Divrei Chaim who says that a doctor is only allowed to desecrate Shabbos by doing actions prohibited by the sages but not by doing actions forbidden by Torah law. 5) He quotes the Yad Sholom who says that if by government law the doctor must desecrate Shabbos even by doing actions forbidden by Torah law, it may be permitted.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Historically, it was not clear if you were allowed to violate the Sabbath even to save the life of a Jew, and it was not until fairly recently that the halacha has been formally reinterpreted to allow saving the life of a non-Jew if it requires violating the Sabbath.</p>\n\n<p>For example, there is a story regarding how ( iirc ) in the time of either the Maccabi's or the Jewish revolt there were many Jews who were massacred because they refused to carry / use weapons on the Sabbath.  I'd love if someone familiar with this could provide the source.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the historical prohibition on violating the Sabbath to save a non-Jew, there might be a difference made between an idolator and a bnai noach.  For example, Rambam forbids providing medical care to an idolator at all times and even forbids saving their life if you see they fell in a hole or are drowning.  However, if not helping the idolator could have repercussions for the Jewish community, he allows it, but only for payment.</p>\n\n<p>This is the basic reasoning behind the modern interpretation, basically the non-Jews are strong and might attack us if we refused to provide them medical treatment on Shabbat, and so we treat them in order to indirectly save Jewish lives by preventing hate and violence.</p>\n\n<p>So basically, the mishna you're looking at means exactly what it seems to mean in it's historical context.</p>\n\n\n",

Non-Jews aren't humans. Keritot 6b.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are a handful of specific technical laws in the Bible that pertain to \"an adam\" which the Talmud interprets as \"Jews only\"; for a non-Jew we are more lenient. The idea simply is that most of the Torah's laws were intended for a Jewish audience, so sometimes \"an adam\" was taken for granted to mean \"a Jew.\" <strong>NOWHERE</strong> do we ever find \"you can kill/rob/rape/disgrace etc. a non-Jew because they're not human.\" Instead, some technical laws were intended on a focus within the Jewish population. For instance:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you use the special formula for Temple oil and apply it to a commoner, not a high priest, you get in really big trouble with G-d. But you only get in really big trouble if you apply it to a Jewish commoner. If you apply the oil to a non-Jew, you don't get in big trouble. That's the instance in Keritot 6b. (As for why the distinction: the concern is that you'd try to make everyone \"ritually special\", which would make no one ritually special, and would ruin the centralization. This became a problem in Jewish history as seen in the books of Judges and Kings -- people would set up their own idolatrous pseudo-Temples wherever they wanted, and find whatever pseudo-priests they could.) The Torah really wasn't concerned about what non-Jews do with it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Suppose a Jewish woman cheats on her husband and has a child from that union. If the \"boyfriend\" was Jewish, we call the child a <em>mamzer</em> and they're prohibited from marrying into the mainstream. If the boyfriend wasn't Jewish, the child is a regular Jew and can marry normally. Again, presumably the Torah was more concerned with what people were more likely to do, which is mess up within their community, and therefore bothered to add a penalty in that case.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>B. Something from Medrish Talpiot</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A non-authoritative work that was done long after the Talmud. I don't know what it says and frankly I don't care. You also have to realize that many medieval works were done around the time of the Crusades with massive Christian persecution, so the message many Jews needed to hear to stay alive was an \"us good, them bad\" one.

Relations with non-Jews. Ketubot 3b.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Close, but no cigar. It's not in the Talmud there, but something similar to it appears in one of the commentaries (Tosafot, a family of rabbis in France in the 1100s) there. Again it's a technical discussion about which penalties apply if someone has relations with someone they shouldn't (see A above); the Torah was more concerned about applying penalties in the common case, which was people messing up with their neighbors, not a far-away foreigner. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>D. Avoid non-Jews. Orach Chaim \"57,6a\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Orach Chaim is a section of Shulchan Aruch, a work that was done a thousand years after the Talmud.  Chapter 57 is a rather cut-and-dry piece about the morning prayers, and it has only two subsections; nothing at all to do with non-Jews here. So I have no idea what this one is about.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>E. Birthrate -- Zohar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have no idea. The Zohar was \"discovered\" in the 1200s.

Replacement -- \"Lore Dea.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think you mean \"Yoreh Deah\" (and if you're making mistakes like that, you really don't know what you're talking about, do you?)

Do women also have this minhag.\nDid they also bow down in the temple when it was standing on hearing the kohen godol say the shem.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1085&st=&pgnum=255\">Rivivos Efraim 3:421</a> brings reasonings that woman should bow down on Yom Kippur and reasonings that woman should not bow down on Yom Kippur. He discusses whether woman bowed down in the temple and says that they did not as they were not there, however had a lady been in the courtyard of the temple and heard the Kohain Gadol say Hashem's name they would be required to bow down too. He concludes that everyone should do according to their Minhag.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Bowing on the High Holidays is a relatively modern practice that wasn't specifically endorsed or described by the Talmud or early halakhists. The idea is to mimic the Yom Kippur service of the Second Temple, when (m. Yoma 6) \"the priests and the people who were standing in the courtyard, when they heard the explicit name, which came out of the mouth of the High Priest, would kneel and bow and fall upon their faces.\" One way of approaching this question, then, is by asking \"would women have bowed in the Second Temple?\" To which the answer is possibly no -- women didn't stand \"in the courtyard,\" but instead in the \"women's courtyard.\" However, David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra (T'shuvos RDBZ 810) says that everyone who could hear the name would bow, and those who couldn't hear the name, even if they were within the courtyard, would not bow. That would seem to imply, by removing the distinction of the courtyard's walls, that women who were close enough would also bow.</p>\n<p>Joseph b. Soloveitchik gives significant evidence about early modern practice in Nefesh haRav (pg. 214): \"Our teacher recalled that when he was in Lithuania he did not see women bowing on Yom Kippur, until he came to Berlin where he saw it for the first time, and then he began to think on why the women did not do so in Lithuania. It occurred to him that the Tosafists quote the Yerushalmi saying that only the 'near' would bow and not the 'far,' and he said that the 'near' are those within the courtyard and the 'far' are those without.\" However a note in the book says that Soloveitchik elsewhere endorsed the contradictory interpretation of RDBZ.</p>\n<p>Analytically, I would connect this to women's practice in other prayer rituals. It's extremely rare for women's sections to uniformly avert/cover their eyes from Birkas Kohanim, for example. In many synagogues, women are used to standing and watching while men perform the rituals and rarely receive official informed guidance. I think Soloveitchik's argument is admirable -- he says elsewhere that RDBZ is correct but here he uses a contradictory logic, presumably to defend the practice of Lithuanian women. The female mimetic tradition is valuable and its oddities are worthy of limmud zechut. But I don't think he meant to criticize the women of Berlin, who did bow and whose tradition is just as valuable.</p>\n\n\n",

[Maharil only discusses immersion prior to Yom Kippur.  Perhaps he does not require immersion prior to Rosh HaShanah because repentance is not a main theme of Rosh HaShanah.]  Second, Maharil notes that if the purpose of the immersion is to merely remove tumat keri, it would only apply to those who are actually impure.  Those who are not impure would not require immersion.  However, if the purpose is for repentance, everyone, including women and young children, should immerse.  [See Sha'agat Aryeh no. 66, regarding a woman's obligation to purify herself prior to a festival.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess the answer to your question is that they are following either the S'dei Chemed or Mateh Moshe.</p>\n\n\n",

But it seems to me – please let me \nknow if I am mistaken – that at least Rosh Hashana is relevant to the whole \nworld and perhaps I should mark it in some way. \nAnd finally, I would like to know if there are particular prayers from the Siddur \nthat are permissible for the Noahide to pray. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Rabbi Israel Chait</strong>: </p>\n\n<p>The Noachide should know that he too is judged on Rosh \nHashanna by God just as the Jew and the rest of mankind. He therefore should \npray all the prayers that the Jew prays, as he too is loved by God and through \nhis repentance and prayer will be received by God and inscribed for a good \nyear. Of course he must make some minor adjustments so that the prayer \nmakes sense. For instance, instead of saying \"our God and the God of our \nfathers\", he can say \"our God and the God of our Patriarchs\" since he is not a \ndirect descendant of the Patriarchs. But such obvious points are minor \nalthough they do require some awareness of what one is saying. But other than \nthat technical point, all of the prayers, even the piyut (additional prayers) are \napplicable and beneficial to the Noachide as it is to the Jew. Indeed, the whole \ntheme of Rosh Hashanna is that there is one Creator of the universe and all \nGod's creatures should recognize Him. What then can be more correct before \nGod than to have the Ben Noach recognize Him and pray to Him on this day? \nIndeed the Ben Noach is in a very special position to do an act that has a \nspecial value, a dimension which his unique position allows him to accomplish, \nwhich the Jew cannot. As it says in the prayers, \"Let all those who dwell on the \nEarth recognize and know that [only] to You shall every knee bow down...and all \nshall accept the yoke of Thy kingdom..and God shall be the king of the entire \nEarth and He and His name shall be one.\"\nThe Ben Noach prayer has a very special place before God as part of the \nfulfillment of His words. May the one who asked the question be blessed with all \nof God's blessings for a wonderful and a spiritually fulfilling year.\nThere is one last point. In order not to violate making a holiday for himself \nsince he is not commanded, the Ben Noach should not treat the day as a \nholiday by making it festive or imposing any prohibitions on himself. ■</p>\n\n\n",

They define themselves as the descendants of tribes of\n  Ephraim and Manasseh (two tribes from the Tribe of Joseph) living in\n  the Kingdom of Israel before its destruction in 722 BC. For them, the\n  Jews are the descendants of the Israelites from ancient southern\n  kingdom of Judah (and Jerusalem).</p>\n  \n  <p>A 2004 study by Shen et al. compared the Y-DNA and DNA-mt Samaritans\n  of 12 men with those of 158 men who were not Samaritans, divided\n  between 6 Jewish populations (Ashkenazi origin, Moroccan, Libyan,\n  Ethiopian, Iraqi and Yemeni) and 2 non-Jewish populations from Israel\n  (Druze and Arab). The study concludes that significant similarities\n  exist between paternal lines of Jews and Samaritans, but the maternal\n  lines differ between the two populations. The pair-wise genetic\n  distances (Fst) between 11 populations from AMOVA applied to the\n  Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial data. For the Y-chromosome, all Jewish\n  groups, except for the Ethiopians, are closely related to each other.\n  They do not differ significantly from Samaritans (0.041) and Druze\n  (0.033), but are different from Palestinians (0.163), Africans\n  (0.219), and Europeans (0.111). Nevertheless, the data in this study\n  indicated that the Samaritan and Jewish Y-chromosomes have a greater\n  affinity than do those of the Samaritans and their geographical\n  neighbors, the Palestinians.[37]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So what went wrong?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ezra got wrong info from God?  <em>(obviously wrong. pardon, just stating all options)</em></li>\n<li>Ezra got the history wrong? <em>(quite likely. he's not a prophet. he got wrong info. but that means the scripture is wrong and we put opinion of a slightly racist wrong guy into bible)</em></li>\n<li>Ezra made this things up to justify kicking people he may have problem with?  <em>(again, pardon)</em></li>\n<li>Ezra is right.

The records of Sargon II of Assyria indicate\n  that he deported 27,290 inhabitants of the former kingdom.</p>\n  \n  <p>Jewish tradition maintains a different origin for the Samaritans. The\n  Talmud accounts for a people called \"Cuthim\" on a number of occasions,\n  mentioning their arrival by the hands of the Assyrians. According to 2\n  Kings[21] and Josephus[22] the people of Israel were removed by the\n  king of the Assyrians (Sargon II)[23] to Halah, to Gozan on the Khabur\n  River and to the towns of the Medes. The king of the Assyrians then\n  brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avah, Emath, and Sepharvaim to\n  place in Samaria. Because God sent lions among them to kill them, the\n  king of the Assyrians sent one of the priests from Bethel to teach the\n  new settlers about God's ordinances. The eventual result was that the\n  new settlers worshipped both the God of the land and their own gods\n  from the countries from which they came.</p>\n  \n  <p>This account is contradicted by the version in Chronicles,[24] where,\n  following Samaria's destruction, King Hezekiah is depicted as\n  endeavouring to draw the Ephraimites and Manassites closer to Judah.\n  Temple repairs at the time of Josiah were financed by moneys from all\n  \"the remnant of Israel\" in Samaria, including from Manasseh, Ephraim\n  and Benjamin.[25] Jeremiah likewise speaks of people from Shechem,\n  Shiloh and Samaria who brought offerings of frankincense and grain to\n  the house of the Lord.[26] Chronicles makes no mention of an Assyrian\n  resettlement.[27] Yitzakh Magen argues that the version of Chronicles\n  is perhaps closer to the historical truth, and that the Assyrian\n  settlement was unsuccessful, a notable population remained in Samaria,\n  part of which, following the conquest of Judah, fled south and settled\n  there as refugees.[28]</p>\n  \n  <p>A Midrash (Genesis Rabbah Sect. 94) relates about an encounter between\n  Rabbi Meir and a Samaritan.

So while empires came and went and conquered the region, intermixed with the locals to a certain extent, expelled, and resettled different people and themselves, the Samaritans remained in their \"habitat\" and continued practicing endogamy with their own kin. Therefore in contrast to the various surrounding peoples that currently inhabit the Middle East, the Samaritans would constitute a fairly reliable proxy for what the ancient Middle Eastern genome would have most likely resembled. </p>\n\n<p>With that said, Jews hold ancient Near Eastern DNA with a fair amount of Italian ancestry maternally (at least as far as Ashkenazi Jews are concerned), so it is of no surprise as to why there is a lot of genetic proximity between the two.</p>\n\n<p>\"I want to know whether they are descendants of Israelites genetically as genetic testing shows\"</p>\n\n<p>Genetics in fact <strong>do not</strong> show that they are descendants of Israelites, genetics show that Samaritans have a <strong>close affinity</strong> with modern Jewry, but it may or may not vindicate their claimed ancestry. Immediately conceding that they are simply outcasted yet legitimate Israelites is simply false. If we ought to solely rely on the biblical narrative, then this issue is even made easier, because according to the biblical narrative Abraham was supposedly born in the ancient Mesopotamian city of Ur, similarly to the Samaritans who also would've originated in Mesopotamia. If we were to apply any sort of logic, the Samaritans would've most likely also absorbed the remnant population of the remaining Israelites, and even other locals with their settlement in Samaria.</p>\n\n<p>Historically the Levant and Mesopotamia were very closely interwined (first Eblaite Kingdom, the Amorite Kingdoms, the Akkadian Empire, the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the Neo-Babylonian Empire etc etc) geographically and economically, so genetic overlap is to be expected.

What would have made a downtrodden group of rabbis in post diaspora Judaism make an outlandish claim like the fact they are related to their worst oppressors if not for their knowledge of an undeniable truth. And yet the timeline is so off. So now what? Hope for this soft science to be perfected and not make any claims against the ultimate truth based on a fledgling theory. </p>\n\n\n",

What about if someone is sitting in their house, may they make the bracha then walk into the sukkah?

They divided it\n  between themselves. Neither of them possessed anything else. One of\n  them was sensible and industrious; the other was the opposite.</p>\n  \n  <p>The sensible brother realized that if he occupied himself solely with\n  his plot of land, this would prevent him from earning his livelihood\n  and attaining his immediate needs. So he hired himself out as a\n  day-laborer in a field belonging to another person and was thus able\n  to subsist on the wages he received. After he had finished his daily\n  task he worked an hour every evening in his own field industriously\n  and zealously. When he had saved enough out of his wages to keep him\n  for one or more days, he stopped working for others and labored on his\n  property with the utmost energy and zeal. In this course he persevered\n  until his plot was in a proper state of cultivation. When the harvest\n  time came he gathered the products of his field and orchard, stored\n  them and had sufficient produce to support himself for the next year.\n  Then he cultivated his land as he desired and planted more trees until\n  it not only produced enough for his maintenance, but yielded a surplus\n  with which he bought additional land.</p>\n  \n  <p>The foolish brother, recognizing that working on his land alone would\n  prevent him from earning a living, neglected his property completely,\n  hired himself out to others as a field-laborer, spent the whole of the\n  wages he received and saved nothing. Whenever he had enough left of\n  his earnings to provide him with food for a single day, he turned it\n  into a day of rest, idleness and amusement, never giving a thought to\n  his property. The hours during which he was free on the days when he\n  worked, he spent in the bath. His land remained waste and yielded\n  nothing. It was all covered with thorns and thistles. Its fences were\n  broken. Its trees were swept away by a flood. It was in the condition\n  described by the wise man in the text (Mishlei 24:30-31) \"I passed by\n  the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of\n  understanding and behold, it was all overgrown with thorns; nettles\n  had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken\n  down.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The intelligent reader who reflects intently upon this parable will\n  draw from it the lesson as to his final end, which is his true home,\n  and he will work on it with all his might. While for his earthly\n  needs, <strong>he will work as one does for others, in moderation and only\n  to the extent absolutely necessary</strong>. The fool, however, acts\n  oppositely in two ways. His interests here on earth he pursues with\n  zeal and diligence while for his welfare in the hereafter he utterly\n  ignores; even as the wise man said, when he observed the fool (Mishlei\n  24.32), \"Then I saw and considered it well. I looked upon it and drew lessons\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tov Halevanon commentary there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"will draw from it the lesson as to his final end\" - For his land\n  refers to his neshama (soul), which G-d gave to him \"to work it and to\n  guard it\" (Bereishis 2:15) in purity, to succeed in planting and\n  bearing fruit in the vineyard of G-d, until the time it is called\n  back. The intelligent man sees that if he spends all of his time\n  working only for his soul, he will not be able to earn a living to\n  provide for his body, and like our sages said: \"all torah study\n  without working for a livelihood will in the end be neglected\" (Avot\n  2:3). Therefore, he sees proper to hire himself out to some work, or\n  some business dealing with faith, in order to sustain himself. <strong>But\n  when he is free from this work, he returns diligently to torah study\n  and service of G-d until he reaches the level of Tzadik (righteous).\n  Then G-d will direct special attention on him to give him abundance\n  and to bless his handiwork</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a person convert if they are living with non-Jewish relative/s?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Can someone living with a non-Jewish friend/house mate convert to Judaism? Obviously, there is a concern over issues such as Shabbat and Kashrut - however if the non-Jewish person complies or makes compromises would the Beth Din allow the person to convert? The flatmate is vegetarian so that's one less thing to worry about. We will however have separate dishes - my sets for meat, dairy and pareve, and theirs.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is something to discuss with your rabbi, but I'm not aware of any halacha that would forbid this and I've never heard a convert (I know several and we've talked about the process) mention this issue.  That's weak evidence, but consider: your rabbi (and ultimately the beit din you stand before) is concerned that <em>you</em> will be able to transition into and maintain a proper Jewish life.  If you can do that in your current living situation, then there is less need to ask you to make changes.  </p>\n\n<p>However, you will need to have detailed conversations with your friend/housemate to make sure the implications are really understood, and then try it for a while and see if it's working.  It's one thing to agree in principle and another to be confronted with the details all the time, like separate dish-washing sponges, lights being left on that one instinctively wants to turn off, and so on.  Everything that <em>you</em> are working to re-wire in your brain as you make the transition will be ten times harder for someone else, who is not motivated like you are, to do.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is for a housemate who is the same gender as you and not a romantic partner.  For those cases there are other issues that you definitely need to discuss with your rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>A note on one detail you mentioned: if your housemate is vegetarian but not vegan, there may still be kashrut issues with the shared kitchen appliances (vegetarian includes dairy).  Are you prepared to re-kasher the oven every time you want to cook meat, for instance?  You will find it far easier, if the housemate is agreeable, to just maintain a kosher kitchen at home.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/31148/21\">Monica beat me to it by a few seconds here</a>, but I'll finish what I started writing.</p>\n\n<p>I'm assuming the housemate is not a \"boyfriend/girlfriend\" type person. Just someone who happens to live in the same house. Otherwise, that's a horse of a completely different color!</p>\n\n<p>(You may want to rephrase the top question line, as sadly I think many people today would read \"living with a non-Jew\" as \"having a non-Jewish significant other.\")</p>\n\n<p>Basically, a panel overseeing a conversion is asking a few questions: \"Is this person sincerely trying to keep all of Jewish law? And is s/he on a trajectory where s/he remains most likely to do so?\" The particulars of how to determine that will vary from beit din to beit din.</p>\n\n<p>It would not surprise me if some rabbis felt that having a non-Jewish housemate makes keeping Judaism difficult enough that they wouldn't endorse it. (Notice how many observant Jews seek out other observant Jews as housemates.) Otherwise, in a theoretical sense it's doable, but there are a lot of questions to ask (this comes up with observant students looking into college dorm options as well), such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is the housemate respectful of your religious choice, or will they give you a hard time about it?</li>\n<li>If your housemate practices a religion that has physical images (e.g. Eastern Orthodox, Hinduism), you will have all sorts of halachic problems to deal with. I'd advise not going there.</li>\n<li>Is the house within walking distance of a synagogue, and ideally with an eruv?</li>\n<li>How complicated is it to keep kosher in such a setup? Separate dishes are a great start, but ovens and sinks can be non-kosher too. This is something that really depends on the details. Furthermore, in some cases, <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-issues-bishul.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">food cooked by a non-Jew without any Jewish involvement becomes automatically non-kosher</a>.</li>\n<li>How complicated is keeping Shabbat in such a setup? If you walk in Friday night and your housemate has the stereo/TV on, you just ignore it. But what about lights in shared spaces that you need on/off? Toilet paper that needs tearing? Lots of little things.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I don't think it's inherently a \"red line\", there are enough little things that can go wrong if you don't really know your stuff. Some rabbis may say \"okay we'll work it out\"; some might recommend trying to find a Jewish housemate if possible (which will probably create its own bunch of questions as your learning mistakes will make it difficult for your housemate); and others may say \"it's just too much of a mess.\"</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# In light of modern science, why is bee honey still kosher?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My understanding of why bee honey is kosher is because the talmud says that the honey is not a by-product of the bees. They simply store the nectar in their body to transfer it and then expel it, turning it into honey. Since it's not a by-product of a bug, it is kosher.</p>\n\n<p>However, modern science has revealed that when the nectar is in the bees body, an enzyme (?) is released, causing the honey making process to begin. Since this enzyme is integral to the creation of honey, and the bee is mixing its \"juices\" so to speak with the nectar, shouldn't we now declare bee honey non-kosher? Why are there no pushes for this? Is it because the enzyme is invisible to the naked eye? Don't get me wrong, I love honey and want it to remain kosher, I just want an explanation in light of modern science.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>According to Halacha we follow Rav Sheishes's view (bechoros 7b) who holds like Rabbe Yaakov (the Tannah) that the reason honey is kosher (even if the bee extracts part of its flesh into the honey as part of the process - Rabeinu Gershom) is a Gzeiras Hakosuv (by Hashem's command) and not like the opinion who says that the reason for its permissiblity is 'because the bees store it in their bodies but do not drain it <strong>from</strong> their bodies'. (See Beis Yosef Yoreh Day'ah end of Siman 81, and in Baeir Heitev #1 that we follow Rav Sheishes.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>My last answer wasn't clear, so although I am loath to rewrite answers that have been voted on already, I'll try to make this a bit clearer.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud has two opinions as to why bee honey is Kosher. Only one of them relies on the way in which bees make honey. The other says it is a \"gezeras hakasuv\" - an arbitrary distinction made in the Torah - which would mean it would be permitted even if it was an excretion from the bee like milk is from a cow.</p>\n\n<p>The identification of the bee enzymes involved in honey production does not fundamentally alter the understanding of how honey was made. It obviously wasn't the pure nectar, even 2000 years ago, as only bees made it into honey. In fact, according to the opinion that bee honey is kosher because of the way bees produce it, shellac would also be Kosher (according to Rav Moshe Feinstein, at least).</p>\n\n<p>The principle that excretions from a non-Kosher animal are themselves non-Kosher is limited by two concepts: \"Pirsha Balma\" - that what is excreted is not food, essentially. Bees wax may fall into that category, but the classic example is urine, I believe.</p>\n\n<p>A more extensive treatment of the subject can be found <a href=\"http://www.kosherveyosher.com/identity-change-2008.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, which specifically discusses the enzymes of the cow stomach used for Rennet being different than the actual flesh. So even according to the opinion that it is the way the bee processes honey that renders it kosher, the fact that an enzyme from the bee is involved in the process does not change the conclusion. In fact, it is unlikely that it even changes the understanding from the Talmud, it just gives it more specificity and detail to identify and name specific enzymes and their function.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>\"Enzymes are protein molecules in cells which work as catalysts. Enzymes speed up chemical reactions in the body, but do not get used up in the process. Almost all biochemical reactions in living things need enzymes. With an enzyme, chemical reactions go much faster than they would without the enzyme.\" - Definition</p>\n\n<p>Thus the bee is not changing the nectar into honey - apparently it is just speeding up the process. It's enzymes do not become part of the honey. Using this reasoning it should be kosher.</p>\n\n\n",

You must take 7 steps right and 9 steps down, making 16 steps total. Therefore, the total number of such sequences is <sub>16</sub>C<sub>7</sub> = 11,440, where <sub>n</sub>C<sub>k</sub> is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient\">Binomial coefficient</a> equal to n! / (k! * (n-k)!), using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial\">factorial</a> notation.</p>\n\n<p>Since, as mentioned before, we can follow the procedure above for all four possible pairs of directions, the total number of times the phrase occurs is 11,440 * 4 = 45,760.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a more manual way to go about it.</p>\n<p>You start with a grid 15 x 19.

For example, the square 1 to the right and 1 down from the central square will have a 1 above it and a 1 to the left of it. Added together is 2.</p>\n<p>When you get to one corner of the whole grid, the square there will end up having inside it the number 11,440. Adding all 4 corners together is 45,760, which is the total number of unique paths.</p>\n<p>This is easy to do in a spreadsheet. Let's say the central cell is H10. After filling in the \"1\"s, type in cell I11 the following formula: =SUM(I10, H11)</p>\n<p>Then click and drag the black triangle (or whatever symbol your spreadsheet uses as a \"fill handle\") in the corner of the cell down to the corner of the grid to fill up the bottom right of the grid with the same formula. (The spreadsheet will automatically adjust the squares being added to always be the adjecent squares.)

Are there opinions either way?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is pretty much open-and-shut.</p>\n<p>Mishna, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h37.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kiddushin 3:13</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל מקום שיש קידושין ואין עבירה, הוולד הולך אחר הזכר; ואיזו זו--זו כוהנת לוייה וישראלית, שנישאו לכוהן וללוי ולישראל.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>וכל מי שאין לה לא עליו ולא על אחרים קידושין, הוולד כמוה; ואיזה זה, זה ולד שפחה ונוכרית.</p>\n<p>Any union which is valid marriage and no prohibition, the child follows the father, namely: a female Cohen/Levite/Israelite marries a male Cohen/Levite/Israelite ...</p>\n<p>Any union in which there would be no valid marriage between her or any Jewish man, the child follows her [the mother], namely: the child of a slave woman or non-Jewish woman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the mishna is spelling out that if mom is non-Jewish, the child is not Jewish. It's implying the converse fairly strongly, that if mom's Jewish so is the child; but the Gemara does quote some different opinions about it. (Rabbi Akiva, fascinatingly, is of the opinion that if dad's not Jewish but mom is, the child is a mamzer. We don't follow his opinion.)</p>\n<p>Rambam rules (Prohibited Relations 15:4):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זה הכלל בן הבא מן העבד או מן העכו\"ם או מן השפחה או מן בת עכו\"ם הרי הוא כאמו ואין משגיחין על האב</p>\n<p>This is the rule: When one parent is a slave or not Jewish, whether male or female -- the child follows the mother, and we pay no attention to [the halachic status] of the father.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in the case of your question, it's actually precisely <em>because</em> no marriage is valid that we ignore the non-Jewish father completely -- leaving the child Jewish.</p>\n<p>For theory's sake, long ago there had been an opinion that both parents must be Jewish for the child to be Jewish -- we don't follow that opinion. But Rabbi Aharon Rakeffet-Rothkoff tells the story of a female student of his whose dad was not Jewish who was constantly upset about the possibility of this minority opinion. Telling her \"we don't follow that opinion\" wasn't calming her fears. So he suggested that when she gets married, she'll be going to the mikvah anyhow, so she could ask a panel of three rabbis to witness the dunking and call it a conversion, just in case. Halachically it's completely not necessary, but it made this woman feel a lot better by getting rid of her doubts.</p>\n\n\n",

Subsequent generations of my family were Catholic. I understand that if the evidence presented to the Rabbis is doubted, I may have to undergo a giyur l'chumra. Is the same level of study, etc. of a regular conversion expected when one undergoes giyur l'chumra?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>A <em>giyur lechumra</em> is usually intended for someone who's already fully observing Judaism. The execution is the same -- circumcision or drawing blood for men; declaration of mitzva acceptance and immersion in a mikva witnessed by three rabbis. If someone's already keeping everything but for instance oops, found out they were adopted, then the rabbis assume the person is knowledgeable and committed, so there's no delay period for education and proof of commitment. And in some circumstances (such as populations with questionable status, such as the Ethiopian Beta Israel), some rabbis may allow a woman who had a <em>giyur lechumra</em> to marry a Cohen, like a born Jew, as she probably was born Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>If someone was not raised observing Judaism, my impression is that most rabbis will expect a similar process of study and commitment to that undergone by someone applying who has no prior Jewish blood. Such a woman would probably be advised against marrying a Cohen. But regardless, you should contact a local rabbi -- or a national-scale body such as the Beth Din of America -- and ask.</p>\n\n<p>I forgot to mention -- welcome!

Big bang describes the development of the universe AFTER the creation of yesh me'ayin and is NOT in conflict with Torah.\nSimilarly non religious individuals like to argue that the universe is 15 billion years old and not 5781 years. It may be an eye opener to point out that the age of the universe is NOT dogma. Neither the Talmud nor the Rishonim (to my limited knowledge) make this point central to Jewish belief. There is an amazing essay by Rabbi Shimon Schwab Z\"L in a publication called \"Challenges\" that addresses this issue.\nOnce your friend realizes that he/she may have misconceptions about Torah beliefs, the door may be open for further dialogue.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I don't think anyone \"believes\" in the Big Bang and evolution etc. I think they believe in the lifestyle that takes these elements as a given and which is based on the weltanschauung that follows these ideas (see Michtav Me'Eliyahu - <em>me'olam lo haya apikorus amiti</em> et al.)

    "content": "# Is toothpaste an issue on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard that squeezing the toothpaste tube might be considered wringing. Does this have any basis?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Some say yes, some say no. </p>\n\n<p>The issue is not only wringing, but also whether the paste turning into froth is considered <em>nolad</em>, something new that came to be on Shabbat. For a comprehensive overview of the issues involved and which poskim have ruled what, see <strong><em>Yabia Omer</em> Vol. IV O\"H #30</strong>, where Rav Ovadia rules that it is permissible to brush your teeth using regular toothpaste on Shabbat. </p>\n\n<p>For a summary of that responsum, here is the Yalkut Yosef 326:14:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some <em>Poskim</em> ruled that even someone who brushes teeth with toothpaste every day may not do so on Shabbat for various reasons. One reason given for this is that when one brushes, the toothpaste becomes frothy with suds, and therefore this is an act of <em>molid</em>. Another reason given is that vigorous brushing might cause the gums to bleed. </p>\n  \n  <p>Other <em>Poskim</em> ruled that it is permitted as long as one places the toothpaste directly into one's teeth and not on the toothbrush. Yet other <em>Poskim</em> ruled that even more leniently, permitting one to brush one's teeth on Shabbat just as one does on the weekdays and with regular toothpaste. They explained that it is not necessary to use special, liquid toothpaste, since brushing teeth is not an act of the <em>melakha</em> of <em>memare'ah</em>, nor is it an act of <em>molid</em>. Furthermore, this is not forbidden as an example of using medical treatments on Shabbat.</p>\n  \n  <p>In practice, anyone who would feel uncomfortable if he does not brush his teeth on Shabbat because of bad breath or some other reason may brush them. This applies, however, only to someone who regularly brushes his teeth so that he will not necessarily cause his gums to bleed on Shabbat. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

What was the extent of the original practice and what were the specific reasons behind it ( beyond the simple explanation given above )?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>I ran across the following from Rav Mordichai Eliyahu's book דרכי טהרה:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בנות ישראל החמירו על עצמן שעל כל טיפת דם קטנה כחרדל יושבות הן ז' נקיים\n  כמו זבה גדולה. וסיבות רבות לחומרה זאת, והחשובה בהן היא כדי שתהיה לכל\n  הנשים ספירה אחידה, ולא תצטרך כל אחת ואחת לחשב לעצמה חשבונות מסובכים\n  שלא כולן בקיאות בהם.  דין זה, אע\"פ שהוא חומרה, נקבה בהלכה שאין עליה\n  עוררין וכשהגמ' מדגימה \"הלכה פסוקה\", לגבי הנאמר במשנה \"אין עומדין\n  להתפלל אלא מתוך הלכה פסוקה\", מביאה הגמ' הלכה זאת.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above gives the following sources:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>רמב\"ם ה' <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5111.htm#4\" rel=\"noreferrer\">אסורי ביאה</a> פי\"א ה\"ג וה\"ד</li>\n  <li>נדה סו. רמב\"ם הל' אסורי ביאה פי\"א ה\"ד</li>\n  <li>ב\"י ס' קפ\"ג</li>\n  <li>ברכות לא ע\"א</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I found the following in Rambam's Mishne Torah, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5111.htm#4\" rel=\"noreferrer\">הלכות אסורי ביאה יא\"ד</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ד  ועוד החמירו בנות ישראל על עצמן חומרה יתרה על זו, ונהגו כולם בכל\n  מקום שיש ישראל:  שכל בת ישראל שתראה דם--אפילו לא ראת אלא טיפה כחרדל\n  בלבד ופסק הדם--סופרת לה שבעת ימי נקיים, ואפילו ראת בעת נידתה.  בין\n  שראת יום אחד, או שניים, או השבעה כולן, או יתר--משיפסוק הדם, סופרת שבעת\n  ימי נקיים כזבה גדולה.  וטובלת בליל שמיני, אף על פי שהיא ספק זבה, או\n  ביום שמיני אם היה שם דוחק, כמו שאמרנו--ואחר כך תהיה מותרת לבעלה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My original question still stands.  How and why did this go from being a <strong>widespread</strong> personal chumra to being codified halacha?</p>\n\n<p>This question is separate from the issue of the Rabbinic decree ( Gezirah ) during Talmudic times to treat all flows of blood as suspected Zav emissions ( ספק דם זיבות ).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5111.htm#3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">הלכות אסורי ביאה יא\"ג</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>There are two basic schools of thought about this principle cited by Rebbi Zeira.</p>\n<p>The Talmud in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.66a.46-49?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Niddah 66a</a> is the most primary source for the discussion of this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב התקין רבי בשדות ראתה יום אחד תשב ששה והוא שנים תשב ששה והן שלשה תשב שבעה נקיים אמר ר' זירא בנות ישראל החמירו על עצמן שאפילו רואות טפת דם כחרדל יושבות עליה שבעה נקיים</p>\n<p>Rav said: Rebbi established in the fields<sup>1</sup> that a woman who sees once sits that day plus the following six, if she sees twice she sits that day plus the following six.  If she sees thrice, she sits for seven [full] clean days.  Rebbi Zeira said: The daughters of Israel were stringent upon themselves that even if they see a drop of blood like a mustard seed, they sit for seven [full] clean days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was intentionally vague in my translation to avoid matters of dispute.</p>\n<p>Later in the Gemara, Rava says about this statement of Rebbi Zeira:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היכא דאחמור אחמור היכא דלא אחמור לא אחמור</p>\n<p>Where they were stringent, they were stringent, and where they weren't, they weren't</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.31a.6-7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachos 31a</a>, the practice of Rebbi Zeira is cited by Abaye as a \"codified halacha\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיכי דמי הלכה פסוקה אמר אביי כי הא דר' זירא דאמר ר' זירא בנות ישראל החמירו על עצמן שאפילו רואות טיפת דם כחרדל יושבת עליה שבעה נקיים</p>\n<p>What is an example of a \"codified halacha\"? Like what Rebbi Zeira said, that the daughters of Israel...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In terms of why this practice came into being, the Ramban in Hilchos Niddah ch.1 writes that the stringency of Rebbi really addressed all concerns, but Jewish women wanted to make it simpler for themselves and just treat all blood-spotting the same, so they adopted the practice cited by Rebbi Zeira.  The Ran, among others, points out that this stringency is not as extensive as it sounds, because the enactment of Rebbi already demanded 6 <em>clean</em> days for even one spotting.  They only added one more day, the purpose of which was to make things simpler.</p>\n<p>As to when it developed, note that Rava in Nidda 66a referred to the practice as being accepted in some places but not in others<sup>2</sup>.  Abaye, a contemporary of Rava, cites it as an example of a \"codified halacha\" in Berachos 31a, the implication of which being that it is universally accepted and bears no further discussion.  Therefore it seems that its transformation must have taken place during Rava's time (ca 270 - 350 according to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raba_(Talmud)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a> Wikipedia article stub), before Abaye passed away (339 according to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmudic_Academies_in_Babylonia\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a> Wikipedia article).  So approximately around the year 300.  The Piskei HaRosh implies this understanding, as in HaTinokes Siman 4 he writes that based on Niddah 66a the practice was not widespread, but in Hilchos Mikvaos Siman 36 he writes that in the times of Rava it was widespread (Divrei Chamudos on Mikvaos note 6 makes this point).</p>\n<p>As to how it developed, there are two basic schools of thought, as I mentioned.</p>\n<p>The Ritva writes that the practice was initiated as a grassroots stringency which Jewish women accepted upon themselves.  However, the Rabbis saw that it was fitting, and they adopted the practice as their own enactment.  They basically co-opted the practice as their own formalized Rabbinic decree.  Tosefos to <a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Megillah 28b</a> s.v. שאפילו רואות implies such an understanding, as he writes the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היאך מצינו טפה כחרדל הגורמת שבעה נקיים בדאורייתא דודאי לא <strong>תקנו חכמים</strong> דבר דלית דכוותיה דאורייתא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Roughly translated:</p>\n<p>Where do we find a drop the size of a mustard seed that causes a Biblical requirement for seven clean days?  Because certainly <strong>the rabbis would not have established</strong> something to which there isn't a Biblical parallel!</p>\n<p>Tosefos seems to view this halacha as a formal Rabbinic enactment.  Otherwise you cannot challenge the concept based on the Rabbinic methodology of its implementation.  His words, \"תקנו חכמים,\" further imply as much.</p>\n<p>Others, however, have a much more passive approach.  The Rosh writes in Tinokes Siman 6</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עבדו רבנן הרחקה יתירה ונהיגו בנות ישראל כר' זירא</p>\n<p>The Rabbis made a further removal and <strong>guided Jewish women</strong> to act in accordance with R' Zeira</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and later he writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>החמירו על בנות ישראל</p>\n<p>[They] were stringent on Jewish women...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Maadanei Yom Tov note צ there writes that the Rosh was justified in calling it the stringency of the Rabbis, even though it was self-imposed, because once the Rabbis allowed them to do it, and set it as a \"codified Halacha\" it can be quoted as such.</p>\n<p>The Ramban, Hilchos Niddah Ch. 1 halacha 19, writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חומרא זו שנהגו בנות ישראל הוכשרה בעיני החכמים ועשו אותה כהלכה פסוקה בכל מקום, ולפיכך אסור לאדם להקל בה ראשו לעולם</p>\n<p>This stringency which Jewish women followed was appropriate in the eyes of the Rabbis, and they made it <strong>like</strong> a codified halacha in all places, and therefore it is forbidden to be lenient with it, ever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Intercourse.11.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchos Issurei Bi'ah 11:10</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חומרה יתרה שנהגו בה בנות ישראל מימי חכמי תלמוד; ואין לסור ממנה, לעולם.</p>\n<p>[This] is an additional stringency which Jewish women practiced over the times of the Rabbis of the Talmud, and one may not depart from it, ever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam makes no mention of it ever evolving to more than an accepted practice.</p>\n<p>Following the first train of thought, there is very little room to view the practice any differently than any other Rabbinic enactment.  However, the second approach allows the room for such discussion, and indeed the Galya Masechta writes that since it is a matter of custom, there is room to be lenient with Rebbi Zeira's halacha under pressing circumstances.  R' Shlomo Zalman in Minchas Shlomo Tinyana 72 argues with the Galya Masechta and says that despite its origins, it has the full weight of a Rabbinical law.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Rashi explains that \"in the fields\" means a place where there weren't Bnei Torah, and therefore the women did not know how to count their cycles properly. The Ramban (in Chiddushim to Niddah 66a) explains similarly, adding that they didn't know how to identify pure vs. impure blood.  The text of the Rif had בסוודות, and the Me'iri had בשוריית, which refer to specific places, although the Ran in Sh'vuos has the same explanation as Rashi on the text of the Rif.  It would be possible to discuss limiting the enactment of Rebbi to places without Bnei Torah based on this.  However, the Rambam, the Ramban, and the Tur all make no mention of any limitation to Rebbe's enactment, and indeed the Ramban and Tur both provide justification for the enactment which is all-encompassing.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Although some understand this to be referring to the application of the stringency to birth, as per the context of the Gemara there, and not to the universal nature of its acceptance.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://download.swdaf.com/DafDocs/berachot/berachot031_Bnot_Yisrael.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for a collection of sources on this question.</p>\n\n<p>A highlighted summary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Rif says that Chachamim subsequent to Reb Zeira established it as a requirement עבדו רבנן הרחקה יתירה והנהגו בנות ישראל למעבד כרבי זירא דהא אמרינן דהא דרבי זירא הלכה פסוקה היא כדאמרינן התם [ברכות ל\"א ע\"א].</p></li>\n<li><p>The Ramban seems to say the same thing חומרא זו שנהגו בנות ישראל הוכשרה בעיני החכמים ועשו אותה כהלכה פסוקה בכל מקום, לפיכך אסור לאדם להקל בה ראשו לעולם.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If I understand it correctly, they are saying that when the Talmud in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=31&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brachos 31a</a> says that this is a clear Halacha, it is showing that this was rabbinically established (at least by the time of Abaya), and not just a custom.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5111.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Rambam</a> has a different approach to this. He says that the Amoraim of the Talmud specifically enacted waiting 7 clean days for any regular bleeding because the ability to distinguish between Niddah and Zahava was becoming problematic. The famous halacha of Rav Zeira only referes to seeing a drop of blood, which as he describes at length earlier has different laws depending on the circumstances, and with it became a universal custom. It still has the force of that custom today.</p>\n\n<p>He writes that all of the customs that were instituted by the women from the days of the Talmud (this one and others listed there) -  ואין לסור ממנה, לעולם - should never be deviated from.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>Here is the second part of the answer:</strong>  The <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/47814/2205\">first part with background information is here</a></p>\n\n<p>Finally we get to the main question.  In <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/niddah/niddah_66.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah 66a</a> ( <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=37&daf=66&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">נידה פרק י דף סו,א</a> ) we have:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב יוסף אמר רב יהודה אמר רב התקין רבי בשדות ראתה יום אחד תשב ששה והוא שנים תשב ששה והן שלשה תשב שבעה נקיים אמר ר' זירא בנות ישראל החמירו על עצמן שאפילו רואות טפת דם כחרדל יושבות עליה שבעה נקיים אדבריה רבא לרב שמואל ודרש קשתה שני ימים ולשלישי הפילה תשב שבעה נקיים קסבר אין קשוי לנפלים ואי אפשר לפתיחת הקבר בלא דם א\"ל רב פפא לרבא מאי אריא קשתה שני ימים אפילו משהו בעלמא דהא א\"ר זירא בנות ישראל החמירו על עצמן שאפילו רואות טפת דם כחרדל יושבות עליה שבעה נקיים א\"ל אמינא לך איסורא ואת אמרת מנהגא היכא דאחמור אחמור היכא דלא אחמור לא אחמור</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Joseph citing Rab Judah who had it from Rab stated: Rabbi ordained at Sadoth [lit. in the fields],  If a woman observed a discharge on one day she must wait  six days in addition to it.  If she observed discharges on two days she must wait six days in addition to these. If she observed a discharge on three days she must wait seven clean days. R. Zera stated: The daughters of Israel have imposed upon themselves the restriction that even if they observe a drop of blood of the size of a mustard seed they wait on account of it seven clean days.\n      <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rava_%28amora%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Raba</a> took R. Samuel out for a walk when he discoursed as follows: If a woman was in protracted labour for two days and on the third she miscarried she must wait seven clean days; he being of the opinion that the law relating to protracted labour does not apply to miscarriages and that it is impossible for the uterus to open without bleeding. Said R. Papa to Raba: What is the point in speaking of one who was in protracted labour for two days seeing that the same applies even where there was the minutest discharge, since R. Zera stated, The daughters of Israel have imposed upon themselves the restriction that even where they observe only a drop of blood of the size of a mustard seed they wait on account of it seven clean days? — The other replied: I am speaking to you of a prohibition, and you talk of a custom which applies only where the restriction has been adopted. [lit. where they are stringent they are stringent where they aren’t stringent they aren’t stringent.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are two separate issues here; one is the enactment of Rabbi ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_the_Prince\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehuda HaNassi</a> ) and the other is our subject here, what is variously called the Stringency of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rav_Zeira\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Zera</a>, or the Stringency of the Daughters of Israel.  <strong><em>None of the reasons behind either one are discussed in the Talmud, however later authorities provide various reasons why they might have came about.</em></strong> It’s not clear if these later explanations are part of an oral tradition or are simply educated guesses.</p>\n\n<p>The enactment of Rabbi ( mentioned only this one time in the Talmud Bavli ), while not the subject here, deserves a little attention, if only for completeness’ sake.  First off, the Soncino translation of the word בשדות may be a bit confusing, as they transliterate it as “at Sadoth”.  בשדות literally means, “in the fields” and figuratively can be understood as rural areas or areas far from the centers of learning.  In fact, the Soncino edition does bring this understanding in a footnote where it gives Rashi’s understanding of this enactment in his commentary to the above:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בשדות - מקום שאין בו בני תורה ואינן יודעות למנות פתח נידות מתי הן ימי נדה מתי הן ימי זוב</p>\n  \n  <p>A place that was inhabited by unlettered people who were incapable of calculating the dates of the menstrual, and the zibah periods.  ( Soncino above, footnote 32 )</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When Rambam talks in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5111n.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הלכות אסורי ביאה יא,ג</a> of a Rabbinic enactment to treat all of a woman’s days as Zivah days and all bleeding as suspected Zavah blood, it seems to me that he is almost certainly talking about this enactment.  ( I would love to hear if someone has a better source. ) His seeming treatment of this as a general prohibition only makes sense when considered in light of his unique view that the seven niddah days and eleven zivah days strictly alternate and that the nature of women’s menstrual cycles had fundamentally changed ( וְנִתְקַלְקְלוּ הַוְּסָתוֹת ).  In such a case virtually no one would be capable of keeping track of a womans niddah / zavah days, not even a learned individual, and the prohibition would <strong><em>in practice</em></strong> apply everywhere.  However, if you accept the understanding of all the other Rishonim as put forward by the Sefer HaChinuch then the above enactment would seem to apply only to places populated by illiterate people and lacking Torah scholars to instruct the women in how to count.</p>\n\n<p>Returning to our subject, the Stringency of R. Zera is mentioned three more times, once in the Bavli in <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 28b pg. 111</a> ( <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=28b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מגילה פרק ד דף כח,ב</a> ), and another time in both the Bavli and <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/r/r1105.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi</a> in parallel discussions in Berachoth.  An interesting side note is that while the Bavli brings the stringency in the name of R. Zera, who was born in Babylon, emigrated to Israel and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/43376/2205\">fasted 100 days to forget what he had learned in Babylon</a>, the Yerushalmi mentions it only once in the name of R. Huna, R. Zera’s original teacher from Babylon. The reference from Megilla doesn’t seem directly relevant to this discussion. </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/pdf/zeraim/Berachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachoth 31a pg. 114</a> ( <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=31&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ברכות פרק ה דף לא,א</a> ) it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר אין עומדין להתפלל לא מתוך דין ולא מתוך דבר הלכה אלא מתוך הלכה פסוקה והיכי דמי הלכה פסוקה אמר אביי כי הא דר' זירא דאמר ר' זירא בנות ישראל החמירו על עצמן שאפילו רואות טיפת דם כחרדל יושבת עליה שבעה נקיים רבא אמר כי הא דרב הושעיא דאמר רב הושעיא מערים אדם על תבואתו ומכניסה במוץ שלה כדי שתהא בהמתו אוכלת ופטורה מן המעשר</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Rabbis taught: A man should not stand up to say Tefillah either immediately after trying a case or immediately after a [discussion on a point of] halachah; but he may do so after a halachic decision which admits of no discussion. What is an example of a halachic decision which admits of no discussion? — Abaye said: Such a one as the following of R. Zera; for R. Zera said: The daughters of Israel have undertaken to be so strict with themselves that if they see a drop of blood no bigger than a mustard seed they wait seven [clean] days after it. Raba said: A man may resort to a device with his produce and bring it into the house while still in its chaff so that his animal may eat of it without its being liable to tithe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What we have here in Niddah and Berachoth is two occurrences of Raba giving his opinion that said stringency does not qualify as a formal legal prohibition, but is only a local custom held in some places and not in others.  In the first case he disputes with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rav_Papa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Papa</a>, who was a student of his and of Abaye.  In the second case he disputes with Abaye himself by giving a counterexample. </p>\n\n<p>There is a principle that in any dispute between Raba and Abaye <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/43364/when-is-the-halacha-like-raba-and-when-like-abaye\">the halacha follows Raba except in six specific instances</a>.  The case under discussion is not one of those instances.</p>\n\n<p>There is also an issue regarding the meaning of the phrase הלכה פסוקה.  The phrase can also refer to the clarity of the matter, not necessarily it’s legal status.  For example <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=31&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi says</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הלכה פסוקה. שאינה צריכה עיון שלא יהא מהרהר בה בתפלתו</p>\n  \n  <p>[ A matter ] that requires no discussion [ deep study ] that will not disturb him during his prayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In fact halacha is a very generic word and can simply mean that something is a part of Jewish tradition, for example even aggadot ( matters of Jewish folklore in the Talmud ) are called halacha in the Talmud, but they are clearly not formal rabbinic legislation.  In addition, late post Talmudic customs such as Kitniyot are called halacha, although they are clearly distinct from Talmudic rabbinic legislation.</p>\n\n<p>However, as mentioned at the beginning there are many authorities on both sides of this issue.   Looking at some Rishonim on the side of seeing the Stringency as formally codified law:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>HaMeiri ( <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31518&pgnum=116\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ברכות דף לא</a> ) - The sages received it from them [ the women ], and practiced what they said, and made it into an obligatory practice.  ( קבלוה חכמים מהם וקיימו את דבריהם ועשאוה הלכה פסוקה )</p></li>\n<li><p>Ramban ( הלכות נידה לרמב”ן פרק א ) - This stringency which was a custom among the daughters of Israel was ratified in the eyes of our sages and they made it into an obligatory practice in every place. ( חומרא זו שנהגו בנות ישראל הוכשרה בעיני החכמים ועשו אותה כהלכה פסוקה בכל מקום )</p></li>\n<li><p>Rif ( שבועות דף ג עמוד ב ) - He calls it הלכה פסוקה and quotes from the above Berachot and it seems clear that he intends the phrase to mean obligatory practice.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the middle we have the Ra’avad, who on the one hand clearly refers to it as a custom ( <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/44068/2205\">מנהגא מילתא היא</a> ), but immediately afterwards calls it הלכה פסוקה.  It seems from the context that his intention is not to say that the custom was formally ratified, but that in the issue he discusses the law is indeterminate and thus follows the custom.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi seems to see it as only a custom - והן החמירו על עצמן - and they made a stringency upon themselves.  This seems to be the case considering the above and his opinion of the meaning of the phrase הלכה פסוקה and the fact that he doesn’t seem to indicate otherwise anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam is fairly straight forward, he calls it <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5111n.htm#9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חומרה יתרה</a> an excessive stringency and quotes החמירו על עצמן - they made a stringency upon themselves, without making any indication anywhere that it was formally codified.  He says ואין לסור ממנה לעולם - and one shouldn’t deviate from this ever, however this just seems to be reminding people of the binding nature of custom, not indicating any formal codification.</p>\n\n<p>Among later authorities who consider it to be a custom are <a href=\"http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/novogrudok/nov025.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Dovid Ben Moshe from Novhardok</a>, who says ( <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=670&pgnum=183\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שו”ת גליא מסכת, עמ’ 180</a>  ):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דעיקר מימרא דרבי זירא האמורה דאף טיפות דם כחרדל צריכה ז’ נקיים לא הוה מתקנות חכמים אלא בנות ישראל המה החמירו על עצמן חומרא זו מעצמן</p>\n  \n  <p>From the essence of what Rabbi Zera said that even a drop like a mustard seed needs seven clean days, it is not a Rabbinic law, instead they the daughters of Israel made this stringency upon themselves by themselves…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Isaac_Kook\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Kook</a> says ( <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20315&pgnum=196\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שו”ת דעת כהן סימן פד</a> ):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואולי עוד קלוש משאר איסורי דרבנן, שהרי הוא באמת רק מנהג שנהגו בנות ישראל, וידוע שמנהג הוא לא חמור כדרבנן ממש.</p>\n  \n  <p>And maybe it is even weaker than other Rabbinic prohibitions, since really it is only a custom that the daughters of Israel practiced, and it is known that a custom is not as strict as a real Rabbinic prohibition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://matzav.com/rav-yisroel-zev-gustman-ztl-on-his-19th-yahrtzeit-today-28-sivan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yisroel Zev Gustman</a> says in ( קונטרסי שיעורים, מסכת קידושין עמ’ 306 - 310 ):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומעתה אסורה נא לעיין בענין חומרא דר’ זירא אשר מבואר דלא נעשה בתקנות חכמים אלא שבנות ישראל החמירו מעצמן בזה ולא נעשה זאת מתקנות ועד חז”ל</p>\n  \n  <p>And now I will deviate if I may to address this issue of Rabbi Zera’s stringency as it was expounded it was not made into a Rabbinic enactment instead the daughters of Israel made this stringency by themselves in this matter and it was not made a formal enactment by the Council of our Sages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The list could go on, but it is clear that there are respected opinions on both sides of this issue.</p>\n\n<p>The last thing to address is why this stringency came about.  As I mentioned before, there is no direct explanation in the Talmud of how or why this stringency came about.  It is not clear if the reasons given by later authorities are based on some oral tradition or if they are just educated guesses.</p>\n\n<p>These explanations fall into a few main categories more or less:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The inability to distinguish between pure and impure bleeding</li>\n<li>inability to keep track of niddah days vs. zavah days</li>\n<li>that all women should have the same count of days</li>\n<li>that the physical reality relating to women’s periods had changed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I mentioned earlier that it seems Chaza”l had a method for distinguishing between pure blood that originated outside the uterus, and impure blood that originated from within the uterus, but that method became lost ( <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=37&daf=20b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">נידה כ</a> ):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי זירא: טבעא דבבל גרמא לי דלא חזאי דמא</p>\n  \n  <p>The nature of Babylon caused me to be unable to distinguish between the bloods</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It may be that the stringency started in Babylon due to a loss of their ability to distinguish between uterine blood and other blood, but that the land of Israel, where they apparently still had this ability, did not accept this stringency during R. Zera’s lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>There are many more references to this loss of ability in the Talmud.  As a result of this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_ben_Asher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yaakov ben HaRo”sh</a> posits the following problem and explanation ( <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/42478\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ארבעה טורים</a>, יורה דעה, קפג ):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משרבו הגלויות ותכפו הצרות ונתמעטו הלבבות, חשו שמא יבואו לטעות באיסור כרת, שמא תראה אישה בימי נידתה ששה ימים ויהיה הכל דם טוהר וביום השביעי שמא תראה דם טמא וסבורה לטבול בליל שמיני וצריכה עוד שבעה ימים - החמירו לטמא כל מראה דם אדום, וכדי שלא יבואו לידי טעות בין ימי נידה לימי זיבה הוסיפו חומרה אחר חומרה, עד שאמרו שאפילו אם לא תראה אלא טיפת דם כחרדל תשב עליה שבעה נקיים כזבה גדולה.</p>\n  \n  <p>Due to the many expulsions, and frequent sorrows, and the shrinking of their hearts, they feared they would violate a prohibition of karet, that a woman would see during her Niddah days six days and it would be all pure blood, and on the seventh day would see impure blood and would think to immerse on the eighth night, when she really needs seven more days - due to this they declared all red blood impure, and in order that they should not make a mistake between NIddah days and Zavah days they added stringency after stringency, until they said that even if they saw a drop of blood the size of a mustard seed they will sit seven clean days like a major Zavah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a good summary of the first two points above.  In addition, Rav Mordchai Eliyahu mentions in his book, “The Ways of Purity”, that an additional reason was so that all women would count in the same manner:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וסיבות רבות לחומרה זאת, והחשובות בהן היא כדי שתהיה לכל הנשים ספירה אחידה, ולא תצטרך כל אחת ואחת לחשב לעצמה חשבונות מסובכים שלא כולן בקיאות בהם.</p>\n  \n  <p>And there are many reasons given for this stringency, and the most important among them is in order that all women will have a unified way of counting, and each woman and woman won’t need to calculate for herself all kinds of complicated calculations that not everyone is versed in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another type of reason is given by Rambam ( <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5111n.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הלכות אסורי ביאה יא,ג</a> ): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְנִתְקַלְקְלוּ הַוְּסָתוֹת - and their menstrual cycles became irregular</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would make sense in certain contexts, as it’s known that extreme mental and physical stresses, including things like malnutrition and starvation can cause women’s cycles to become extremely irregular. It may also indicate some kind of hishtane hateva argument - according to his method, how could women have ever tracked their niddah vs. zavah days unless prior to Talmudic times they had perfect 19 day menstrual cycles?</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, there is <a href=\"http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/talmud-ii\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an interesting hypothesis</a> as to the origins of the Stringency attributed to <a href=\"http://www.yu.edu/faculty/pages/Elman-Yaakov\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yaakov Elman</a> chair of Talmudic studies at Yeshiva University and his former student <a href=\"http://blogs.yu.edu/revel/2013/07/03/meet-dr-shai-secunda-revel-alumnus/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dr. Shai Secunda</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As to the non-elitist Babylonian Jews, we have a report regarding the ordinary Babylonian Jewish women. Rabbi Zera reports that the “daughters of Israel had undertaken to be so strict with themselves as to wait for seven [clean] days [after the appearance] of a drop of blood the size of a mustard seed [although biblically they are required only to separate for seven days from the onset of menstruation]” (Berakhot, fol. 31a; Megillah, fol. 28b; Niddah, fol. 66a). It is clear from Niddah (fol. 66a) that this stringency was a popular practice and not a rabbinic prohibition, probably in response to a “holier than thou” attitude perceived by the populace as emanating from their Persian neighbors. It seems that Babylonian Jewish women had internalized their Zoroastrian neighbors’ critique of Rabbinic Judaism’s relatively “easy-going” ways in this regard; Jewish women did not have to remain isolated on spare rations in a windowless hut for up to nine days, as was prescribed in Pahlavi Vendidād (Elman, 2004a, p. 34; but see Secunda, 2007a, pp. 144-89).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, the Jewish women didn’t want to be “outfrummed” by their Zoroastrian neighbors, <a href=\"http://search-for-emes.blogspot.co.il/2008/04/seven-clean-days.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">as one blogger put it</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, it seems clear from the vast majority of the sources that the stringency started as a personal stringency that women took upon themselves, then evolved into a widespread custom practiced in some communities and not in others, and then at some point after that, and it’s not at all clear when that point was, became a universal custom.  The Talmud itself seems to give no real indication as to when this occurred.  Much later post-Talmudic sources debate whether this custom was formally ratified or not by the Sages, and there are respected authorities on both sides of the issue.  There are no reasons given for this practice in the Talmud itself, and it is not clear if the reasons given by much later Post-Talmudic sources are part of an oral tradition or are educated guesses.</p>\n\n\n",

And they protect you in case any period is at all funny, you could wind up in a zava situation -- or nida-still-within-the-seven -- without knowing it (in which case mikva and everything accomplishes nothing, it would still be liable to <em>Karet.</em>) It's not just about being \"careful.\" If you're not <em>incredibly</em> knowledgeable, a lot of problems can easily happen.</p>\n\n<p>In theory if a person was lucky and in their situation turned out to be a simple nida start-to-finish, ending correctly at 7 days, then they would have violated the rabbinic prohibition to always wait seven clean days. The Torah commands us to follow the rabbinic enactments, though it's debated by the commentaries whether every rabbinic prohibition therefore carries this Biblical command as well, or whether it simply applies to the general framework.</p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, intentionally violating a rabbinic prohibition could have been punishable by lashes. (The Talmud talks about lashes for rabbinic prohibitions, but the <a href=\"http://steinsaltz.org/learning.php?pg=Daf_Yomi&articleId=787\" rel=\"nofollow\">commentaries have different understandings</a> about how many lashes and in what circumstances; a lot may have been up to the rabbis judging each case. No rabbinic court today uses corporeal punishment, so the takeaway is simply: \"don't mess with these rules!\") Today we would simply recommend the standard course of repentance -- avoid the sin, regret it, confess it to G-d, commit to avoiding it again.</p>\n\n<p>An unintentional violation should be fixed by educating yourself and ensuring it doesn't happen again, but doesn't bear any other punishment or guilt. (This came up in the context of a woman who discovered she'd been mistakenly counting 6 clean days instead of 7.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Talmud in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=13b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shabbos 13a-b</a> (translated <a href=\"http://dafnotes.com/english_dafyomi/shabbos/Shabbos_13.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) brings the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The following breita was taught in the academy of Eliyahu: It happened\n  that there was one student who learned much Mishnah and learned much\n  scripture and spent much time serving Torah scholars, but he died at\n  half his years. His wife would take his tefillin, bring them around\n  the houses of prayer and houses of study and say to [the people\n  there]: “It is written in the Torah: For this is your life and the\n  length of your days. Therefore, my husband who learned much Mishnah,\n  and learned much scripture, and spent much time serving Torah\n  scholars, why did he die at half his years?” And no one would answer\n  her anything. I once visited her and she told me the whole story. I\n  asked her: “My daughter, during the days of your niddah, what did he\n  do with you?” She answered me: “God forbid! He did not touch me, even\n  on my little finger!”</p>\n  \n  <p>I asked her: “During the days of your white [clothing] what did he do\n  with you?” She answered: “He ate with me, drank with me and slept with\n  me without clothing, but he did not even think about the other thing\n  [sexual relations].” I said to her: “Blessed is God who killed him,\n  because [your husband] did not show respect towards the Torah, for the\n  Torah says: You shall not approach a woman in her time of ritually\n  impure nidah.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first Tosfos on 13b quotes Rabbeinu Tam as saying that she went to the Mikva after 7 days to be Tahor biblically, and then again after 7 clean days for the Rabbinic prohibition. This is why the student thought it was permitted. Either way, everything listed there is a Rabbinic prohibition, and his result was \"he died at half his years.\"</p>\n\n<p>(As a side point, one reason for why she went to the Mikva twice I have seen suggested that the first time was so that she could deal with Taharos - she could make food that was a Tahor, and the second time was to satisfy the Rabbinic requirement for marital relations).</p>\n\n\n",

Do I need to ensure that I eat in a Sukka?\n  Answer:  The Gemara in Sukka (26a) teaches us that one is exempt from eating and sleeping in a Sukka while travelling because teishvu kaein taduru, one doesn’t alter one’s normal living habits in order to live in a Sukka. Rashi explains that just as during the rest of the year living at home does not prevent one for travelling on a business trip, so too one may make a business trip (over Chol Hamoed).\n  The Shulchan Aruch (OC 640:8) paskens like the Gemara, though the Rema adds that debt collectors travelling to villages which don’t have a Sukka will be blessed if they are particular to return home each night. The Mishna Berura (260: 40-45 and Biur Halacha) explains that one should look for a Sukka. If there isn’t one around one doesn’t need to go to the bother of building one just for a night, though should for a longer stay.\n  R’ Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe OC 3:93) qualifies the Gemara’s exemption like Rashi: While may one travel for business purposes of for a mitzvah, one going on a trip for pleasure is still required to eat (and sleep) in a Sukka. One doesn’t need to travel for pleasure, and one should go out of one’s way, and forgo a little extra pleasure in order to fulfil a mitzvah. Elsewhere (EH 4:32:8), R’ Moshe writes that tourists who visit another country and particularly want to see the sites may travel without a Sukka if they can’t delay visiting until after Yom Tov. R’ Ovadia Yosef (Yechave Daas 3:47) also holds that one can not eat outside of a Sukka when on an outing.\n  R’ Elyashiv (Hearos Lemasesches Sukkah p114) challenges R’ Moshe’s arguments. As it is common to travel for pleasure, it should be no different to traveling for business, and such travel should be included in teishvu kaein taduru. Rashi, he writes, used business as an example, and other Rishonim don’t stress any type of travelling. Additionally, one who has a Sukka and leaves it for a short trip is not considered avoiding the Mitzva.\n  While one has what to rely on under emergency, ideally, one should be particular to prepare food that doesn’t necessitate a Sukka when travelling (See Shulchan Aruch OC 639:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Some (but not all) Poskim permit spray deodorant. Roll-on deodorant would be no problem.</p>\n\n<p>Yet there are some who are strict and use only odorless deodorant because of creating an aroma (Mo'lid) unless there is at least some remnants of the odor from before Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n",

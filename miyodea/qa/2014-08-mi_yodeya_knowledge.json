    "content": "# Correct procedure for davening in Synagogue after sof zman tefila\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In America, it is very common for shuls to start quite davening <em>shacharit</em> quite late on Shabbat.  Suppose someone is going to be attending a synagogue that will not reach <em>shmoneh esrei</em> before <em>sof zman tefila</em>. What would be the halachicly preferable course of action?</p>\n\n<p>1) Daven with the minyan late</p>\n\n<p>2) Daven <em>shmoneh esrei</em> at home before coming to shul and then again with the minyan (How would one do this?  Would he have to say all of <em>pesukei d'zimra</em> and <em>kriat shema</em> at home?)</p>\n\n<p>3) Daven <em>shmoneh esrei</em> at home and then not join the minyan in it's silent recitation</p>\n\n<p>4) Some other procedure</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It depends on whether you follow the letter of the law as codified in Shulchan Aruch (89:1) and daven before the <em>zman tefillah</em>, or follow a Chasidic practice that is not particular about following the set times for <em>Shma</em> and <em>Tefillah</em>. This point of contention has been in existence since the beginnings of the Chasidic movement and here is just <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=3624&hilite=b4bcea4c-4bf0-41aa-acab-f8edf849760d&st=%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%D7%AA%20%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2&pgnum=128\" rel=\"noreferrer\">one source for this practice</a>. (For a more thorough treatment see <a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2008/09/chassidic-zemanim-davening-late.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><em>Mishne Berurah</em> (46:32) writes that one should daven without a minyan rather than davening with the minyan after the <em>zman tefillah</em>. When joining the minyan later, one should answer Amen and recite Kedusah. etc., but should not daven again since he already davened. He should also stand when the <em>tzibbur</em> say <em>Shmone Esrai</em> (102:1)</p>\n\n<p>However, common practice <em>lechatchila</em>  among many Chassidic groups is to daven with the minyan.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I heard the following story from Rabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen of Lakewood, who accompanied Rav Moshe for years, and my father Rabbi Yizchok Frankel of Cedarhurst, who was a תלמיד מובהק of Rav Moshe and Rav Dovid Feinstein:</p>\n<p>On the Lower East Side there was a 9:00am Shabbos morning minyin in the main MTJ Bais Medrash (Mesivta Tiferes Jerusalem). What's important to the story is that this 9:00am minyin was in effect <em>many years</em> before Rav Moshe came to America.</p>\n<p>When Rav Moshe became Rosh Yeshiva in MTJ he never suggested to change the 9:00 start time in order to accommodate זמן קריאת שמע. Instead he started an additional 8:00am Shabbos minyin \"for the bochrim\" upstairs in a classroom. Rav Dovid Feinstein זצ\"ל davened \"with the bochrim\" at 8:00 while Rav Moshe attended the main 9:00 minyin downstairs in the main Bais Medrash.</p>\n<p><strong>However</strong>... Rav Moshe didn't actually daven shachris with them at 9am. He only made believe he was davening with them. Actually, before coming on time to the 9:00 minyin, Rav Moshe had already davened the entire shachris alone, ביחידות, at home on Shabbos morning \"עם ותיקין\"  (I'm using language of עם ותיקין from shulchan Aruch 58:1 מצוה מן המובחר להתפלל שיגמור תפלתו עם הנץ החמה, כדי שיתפלל *עם ותיקין). Not only was saying shema on time more important to him than minyin, saying shema with shmona esrei before zman krias shema was more important than minyin.</p>\n<p>But Rav Moshe was careful that the regular attendees of 9:00 Shachris never knew that when he came to Shul Shabbos morning he had already davened at home. Therefore, at 9:00am he would \"pray\" the whole shachris again, he turned the pages in his siddur and mouthed the entire davening from the beginning to end, with the tzibbur. Wherever one may say Hashem's name, such as in P'sukei D'zimra, he would say it audibly. Wherever you cannot, such as birchas krias shema, he faked it. He said Shema again each word out loud with his tzitzis in his hand, and at shmoneh esrei he stood as if in תפילה, even taking 3 steps back when he \"was done\" at which point the chazzan, who was waiting for him to finish, started חזרת הש\"ץ.</p>\n<p>I was shocked when I first heard this from Rabbi Cohen, so I did my research and this is in fact accurate. To those closest to him, Rav Moshe explained his unusual behavior. He believed that because the 9:00am minyin was already an established local minyin before he became the rosh yeshiva, he had no right to change it when he got here. He also worried that suggesting they change would be offensive to the minyin attendees and perceived as a criticism of them. Therefore, he said nothing. He was however able to start an 8:00am minyin \"for the bochrim\" as that would not be looked at as a condemnation of the main 9:00 minyin. It's very normal for a Yeshiva to have an earlier minyin for the bochrim. But this minyin would not take place in the main bais medrash. It would take place upstairs in a classroom. Rav Moshe himself however, never davened at the 8:00 bochrim minyin, which would have allowed תפילה בציבור before zman krias shema. Again, the reason because that would be perceived by \"the baal-habatim\" as a statement of condemnation towards them and their 9:00am minyin. Rav Moshe considered attending the main 9:00 minyin his obligation and part of his contract and as the Rosh Yeshiva of MTJ, he was hired by \"the baal-habatim\" and he included davening with the main minyin part of that.</p>\n<p>But (here's where we come back to the original topic) he believed davening and completing shmoneh esrei (amida) with birchas shema, before the zman for krias shema more important than davening with a minyin. So he davened at home. He also believed embarrassing people to be worse than skipping minyin, therefore he didn't daven at 8:00am where his son Rav Dovid davened.</p>\n<p>(And lastly, parenthetically, do not ever mistakenly think that the reason Rav Moshe willingly missed minyin was because he prayed עם ותיקין. Rav Moshe famously and notoriously did not agree with those who say it is ok to skip minyin to daven עם ותיקין. See Igros Moshe O\"ch 1:28  ומ\"מ כיון דתפילה בציבור הוא חיוב יותר גדול מאשר ענין ותיקין — שפשוט הוא דאף אם יכול להתפלל ותיקין ביחידות, או להתפלל שלא כותיקין בציבור, יתפלל בציבור ולא ותיקין Rav Moshe is very clear as you can see. To Rav Moshe very few things can override minyin. But in this case where he was davening at home for a different reason, עם ותיקין was the next best option)</p>\n\n\n",

Besides those mentioned in the Gemara, later authorities brought many more hints from the text of the Torah that the pesukim refer to monetary payment. It would be too lengthy of a discussion to quote them all here.<br> Importantly, the Rambam in his introduction to his explanation of the Mishna deals with this subject. There he writes that there was always a known and undisputed direct tradition that the verses were non-literal. The purpose of the exegesis of the Gemara is not to learn the otherwise-unknown meaning of the pesukim. Rather, it is to demonstrate that all the details of the Oral Torah are hinted to in the text of the Written Torah. <br>\nThe Rambam compares this to the Gemara in Succah (daf?), which seems to be unsure about what fruit the Torah refers to in the commandment of the Four Species taken on Sukkos. Like in Bava Kama, different Sages offer drashos and pesukim to show that the Pasuk refers to the esrog. Now, says the Rambam, it was undoubtably known throughout Jewish history that the fruit taken on Sukkos is the esrog. Did the Sages not see there parents and communities taking esrogim every year? Thus, writes the Rambam, these pesukim must not be seen as the <em>source</em> for the law, but as the hint to the law that can be found in the Written Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

A kamatz in a closed unstressed syllable, is kamatz katan.  Primary or secondary stress counts. So a meteg (secondary stress) when with a kamatz, denotes secondary stress that makes it not unstressed, so, whether open or closed, it's then not closed unstressed, so it's then a kamatz gadol.  I don't think there are any exceptions to this. msh210 tried to suggest one but it's not an exception(as I commented to him).</p>\n<p>Ashkenazi hebrew doesn't have two kamatz sounds for the one kamatz mark.</p>\n<p>The rule in modern israeli hebrew I don't know the details of, it may take into account the binyan and tense/aspect of the verb when the word is a verb.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another Ba'al Kri'ah explained that a kamatz katan occurs when a\nkamatz is used in a word (usually a verb) when the root of the verb\nusually has a cholam.

For example  Gen 9:21 Aleph Heh Lamed Heh . The Aleph has a kamatz but there's a difference between sephardi and modern israeli hebrew as to whether it's kamatz gadol or kamatz katan.  Sephardi hebrew would say Ahola.  Modern Israeli Hebrew would say kamatz katan Ohhola and for modern israeli hebrew it's to do with the fact that the word it comes from Ohel has a cholam to make the Oh.</p>\n<p>Feldheim use the sephardi rule, whereas I have heard that Koren use the modern israeli rule.</p>\n<p>The sephardi rule for kamatz katan is very simple, all over the place online and easily verified on any word in e.g. the Feldheim tanach simanim that marks them.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# I thought Gezeirah Shavah requires Mesorah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Masecheth Rosh Hashanah (9b), the Gemara uses a Gezeirah Shavah from Tishrei, with the word שנה, to support the Mishnah's ruling that 'Orlah is counted from Tishrei. In response, however, the Gemara challenges that Nisan has the same word and, therefore, the Gezeirah Shavah could be applied to Nisan, a point which is subsequently rejected based on a logical argument.</p>\n\n<p>Wait a second! I thought that a Gezeirah Shavah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.66a.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">can</a> only be established by a tradition from one's teacher! While I understand the logical argument on both sides of this particular debate, of what relevance is either argument? Either there's a tradition, or there isn't. So what's going on here?!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>There are two different types of gzeirah shava</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>specific words were part of the mesorah but the pesukim used and / or the actual item that was derived from the gzeirah shava may not have been part of the mesorah. </li>\n<li>The content of the limud was part of the mesorah but not the words used in the gzeirah shava.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Halichos Olam Shaar 4. See also Ramban sefer hamitzvos 2</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.daat.co.il/encyclopedia/value.asp?id1=1130\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> where they explain that Rashi and Ramban maintain that one may <strong><em>associate</em></strong> a halacha from a gezeirah shavah only if he <strong>received the halacha that is \"being derived\" from his teacher</strong>. The actual words of the gezeirah shava may not have been transmitted by his rebbi.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"אין אדם דן גזרה שווה מעצמו\" (פסחים סו.). רש\"י: \"אלא אם  כן למדו\n  מרבו\". רק אם החכם קיבל את ההלכה מרבו, רשאי הוא לדרוש לה \"גזרה שווה\",\n  ולעשות את הפסוק אסמכתא להלכה שבידו. אך אין לחדש הלכה באמצעות גזרה\n  שווה. בלשון הירושלמי: \"אדם דן גזרה שווה לקיים תלמודו\" (ירושלמי, פסחים\n  ו:א). טעם לכך, כתב רמב\"ן בספר המצוות, כי ישנן מלים רבות הכפולות בתורה,\n  ואם ידרוש אדם מעצמו, פעמים ידין רוחו, ויהרוס כמה דינים, ויסתור כמה\n  עניינים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, this seems to be an oversimplification in the definition of a gzeirah shava. None of the Rishonim cited nor the Yerushalmi is a proof for this: the Yerushalmi is simply saying that for a known halacha one may find a hint for his halacha using a gzeirah shava...i.e. using a memory device similar to an actual gzeirah shava but by no means is this an actual drasha from a gzeirah shava.</p>\n\n<p>See Encyclopedia Talmudit גזירה שוה entry where this and more detail can be found.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I once asked a rebbi of mine this very question, in a different context. The Gemara in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=14b&format=pdf\">Kiddushin 14b</a> discusses a Gezerah Shavah using the word שכיר, a word that is found a number of times in the sections of the Torah that deal with slaves/servants. Tosofos there, s. v. מוכר, takes the liberty of applying this Gezerah Shavah to other instances of the word in the Torah. <br> I asked my rebbi, how can Tosofos create a Gezerah Shavah without a direct tradition. He answered that a direct tradition is only required to identify which words are used in a Gezerah Shavah. However, once it is known that a certain word, such as שכיר, is meant to be used, the rules of Gezerah Shavah can and should be applied to any instance in the Torah where the word is mentioned. Of course, only someone of great Torah stature can know how to apply each GSh, and we would not attempt to do so nowadays. But Amoraim and even Rishonim can do so. <br> As an interesting addition, the assumption the one cannot make a GSh without a tradition is one stated by Rashi and others in many places across Shas. Interestingly enough, the sefer Kin'as Sofrim, a commentary on the Sefer Hamitzvos of the Rambam (in Shoresh 2), maintains at length that the Rambam disagrees with Rashi on this account, and holds that later Sages of the Sanhedrin could develop a Gezerah Shavah on their own, using some unknown principles. Even if his thesis is correct, it nevertheless seems to be a lone opinion.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# To what extent would a 17th-century observant Jew purposefully violate Halacha to save lives?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I’m writing an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1632_series\" rel=\"nofollow\">alternate-history story set in the 1630s</a> and this topic touches on one of the plot points. My character is attempting to avert the various massacres of the 17th–20th centuries by engaging more strongly with the Christian community. I am receiving a great deal of resistance from Jewish readers who tell me that the character is violating <em>halacha</em> the way I’ve written the story, and that he would <strong>not</strong> realistically do what I am suggesting he might.</p>\n\n<p>To what extent is it permitted to violate <em>halacha</em> to save lives? What are the limits on this, whether in the immediacy of the threat (my character is particularly trying to avert the Holocaust, four centuries in his future) or in what actions are permitted (for example, attending, but not participating in, non-Jewish religious services)?</p>\n\n<p>Would any of this be affected by the appearance of a society (in this story-universe, a town of 21st-century Americans) that values religious freedom and is appalled by any form of religious pogrom or sanctioned massacre? (I.e., would the 17th century Jewish community be more likely to adapt their practices, or double down on status quo?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><em>Answer to the question in the title:</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Yes.</strong> To directly save a life, a Jew is allowed to violate Halacha.  In fact, according to some opinions, a Jew is <em>supposed</em> to violate Halacha to directly save a life, even if a non-violating method is available, in order to emphasize the sanctity of life and the extent to which saving a life should be expedited.</p>\n\n<p>Violating Halacha for indirect saving of lives, such as preventative action to avoid loss of life, would be permitted, but it would be greatly preferred that one employ a method which does not involve violating Halacha.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2><em>Edit due to modified question:</em></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>attending, but not participating in, non-Jewish religious services</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>is generally <strong>prohibited.</strong>  Only if your character could demonstrate that there is a clear and present danger which could be only be neutralized by attending a Church service would he be permitted to attend.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>trying to avert the Holocaust, four centuries in his future</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>is not a clear & present danger, and all the laws regarding Saving a Life would <strong>not</strong> apply.  In other words, a Jew cannot violate Halacha to possibly save lives hundreds of years in the future.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>appearance of a society that values religious freedom ... to adapt their practices, or double down on status quo</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A society that values religious freedom - ie, people can worship whatever and however they like - would not be accepted by a traditional Jewish community in the 17th century.  (Or the 18th, or the 19th, and even the 20th in certain communities.)  At best, it would be treated as any other Gentile society, and the whole concept of religious freedom would be ignored, and life in the Jewish community would continue as usual.  If the idea of religious freedom started being accepted by the youth, and they started deviating from Tradition, the community would \"double down on the status quo\" and attempt to limit the influence of these \"corrupting concepts.\"</p>\n\n<p>Similar scenarios actually occurred in history, and historical Jews actually reacted to them.  For more information, I suggest you research Jews in the Napoleonic era (and their reaction to the Jewish emancipation), and Jews in early America.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Source for Immersion after Biblical Niddah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Unlike other ritual impurities, which explicitly list various immersion or washing requirements, biblical niddah has no such explicit requirement in the written Torah ( to the best of my knowledge ) so from where do we learn that a biblical niddah is required to immerse on the eighth night after getting her period ( assuming of course that she's no longer bleeding )?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There truly is no clear source for this. There are several different opinions in Rishonim, each one has its limitations.</p>\n\n<p>The simplest source is a Kal Vechomer, whoever touches what she lies or sits on has to immerse to be pure, how much more so herself. The <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5104n.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam (Issurei Biah 4:3)</a>, quoting the Sifra [according to the Maggid Mishna, in a quick look I couldn't find it saying that about the Posuk, only that it means that she and he have the same Mikvah requirements], says it is a Binyan Av. Tosfos gives some other opinions (see the Hagaos Maymonis on the Rambam there).</p>\n\n<p>Also I would note that there is no such thing as a ritual impurity that goes away due to the passage of time alone. Some require Mikvah, some require other things instead of or in addition to the Mikvah. But there isn't one that just \"expires.\" There is no reason to think that this is an exception.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding Talmudic level sources, you can look at Avodah Zarah <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=75b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">75b</a> where it says that מי נדה means that the water that Keilim are immersed in has to be the same shiur as the water used for a Niddah - 40 Soah. Also <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=64b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shabbos 64b</a> where it learns that <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9916/jewish/Chapter-15.htm#v=33&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">והדוה בנדתה</a> means that she has to go to the Mikvah to be permitted to her husband (see Rashi there). These sources are brought in Tosfos on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=47b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yevamos 47b</a> (as well as the Kal Vechomer above) where it discusses explicitly that a Ger and a freed Eved immerse in the same type of Mikvah as a Niddah and have the same requirement regarding any separation from the Mikvah water, where Rashi discusses that the similarity for all three is that the purpose of the Tevilah is not for the ability to handle Taharos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I found another source in Ramban's commentary to the Torah ( <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=3&perek=15&mefaresh=ramban\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ויקרא פרק טו</a> ) for why this is done:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא הזכיר הכתוב טבילה באשה, כי הזכיר זוב האיש וטומאתו, ואמר בסוף (פסוק\n  יג): ורחץ בשרו במים חיים וטהר, וחזר ואמר באשה (פסוק יט): ואשה כי תהיה\n  זבה, כאיש הזב, דם יהיה הזוב שלה לא לובן כאיש, והזכיר הטומאה בנדה\n  ובזבה, ואחרי כן הזכיר בזבה (פסוק כח): ואם טהרה מזובה, כאשר יטהר הזב\n  מזובו, וספרה לה שבעת ימים, כאשר יספור הזב, ואחר תטהר, כטהרת הזב. ועל\n  דרך הפשט, שתהיה צריכה רחיצה במים חיים כזב.</p>\n  \n  <p>And the Torah did not mention immersion for a woman, because it\n  already mentioned a male Zov and his impurity, and it said in the end:\n  and he washed his flesh in living water and was purified, and then it\n  returned and said in regards to the woman:  and a woman if she has a\n  [Niddah] issue, like a male Zov, blood will be flowing for her and not white\n  like a man, and it mentioned the transmission of impurity in Niddah and in Zavah, and\n  afterwards mentioned Zavah: and if she be purified from her Zovah, in\n  the way a male Zav is purified from his Zov, and she counted seven\n  days, just like the male Zov counts, and after is purified, like the\n  purification of the male Zov. And the simple meaning is that  she\n  needs to immerse in living waters like a male Zov.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, the female illness of a Zavah is parallel to the male illness of a Zov ( he says this elsewhere ), and since it already mentions immersion for the man it should be clear that it's needed for the woman also.  And since the laws regarding transmission of ritual impurity are the same for a Zavah as for a Niddah, then if the Zavah requires immersion then Niddah must also require immersion. It's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a transitive relationship</a> in regards to immersion between the three, Zov, Zavah and Niddah.</p>\n\n\n",

There needs to be a holy, good purpose/reason for taking it out or for travelling.  To take a sefer Torah to the moon when there is no place for it to reside and no Minyan in which it would be read, it seems unlikely that this would be permitted.  Furthermore, the journey to the moon is not necessarily kavodik - how would it be transported etc. are all questions that would require halachic discussion and supervision. As a practical example it would be forbidden to sleep or lie next to the Sefer Torah.  In space is this even possible not to do?</p>\n\n<p>Sifrei Torah that remain untouched tend to wear out much faster than those read on a regular (weekly) basis.  The reason is that the ink is constantly expanding and contracting as it is rolled, and thus bonds to the parchment more readily.  Leaving a sefer Torah in an environment where the elements could actually damage it, would defeat any objective. Solar winds, low gravity, low atmosphere, low oxygen could have a deleterious affect on the parchment and ink.  It could not, but one would have to test this in a real life example - perhaps a sofer would write some text on parchment, send it up to the moon for a year, and then get it back to see the effects.  This would be an expensive undertaking for any mission.</p>\n\n<p>There are also Hashkafic issues.  Is there legitimate reason to send a Sefer Torah to the moon?  If it is an act of preservation, the Jewish people have survived more than 2000 years of tumultuous history, Their sifrei Kodesh have survived as well, Hashem has provided the means for two miracles, there is no need to worry about that.  </p>\n\n<p>If these places are colonized, would there be any reason for a Jew to go? It would seem that it would be forbidden to go to Mars if there is no Minyan etc. If necessity required it, then the appropriate questions will be posed to the leading halachic authorities about the most appropriate action in such a scenario should be.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422619254.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>What If... on Yamim Tovim</em></a> (page 242-244), Rav Zilberstein addresses whether a Sofer may write a Sefer Torah specifically for the purpose of sending it to the moon. </p>\n\n<p>He begins by citing the Yerushalmi (Peah 1:1), where Rebbe sent the non-Jew Artvon a Mezuzah. The Netziv (Emek She’eilah 145) questions this: a Mezuzah written without specification must be hung on a Jewish doorpost; a Mezuzah may not be hung on a non-Jew’s doorway, as he has no obligation of Mezuzah, and that would be degrading to the scroll written for the Mitzvah. The Netziv answers that it must be, then, that Rebbe specifically had that Mezuzah written for Artvon. He quotes a precedent for this from the Yerushalmi (Sanhedrin 3:9) which says that Sifrei Torah written in Eretz Yisrael may not be removed from Eretz Yisrael unless they were specifically written to be brought to the Diaspora. </p>\n\n<p>Based on this, Rav Zilberstein at first suggested that it should be permissible to write such a Sefer Torah with the intent to take it to the moon. However, he differentiates between the two cases, saying that it’s a disgrace to the Sefer Torah to be brought to a barren place where it will never be used, and “the fundamental disgrace of the Sefer Torah never being used cannot be mitigated by writing it with that intent.”</p>\n\n<p>If Rav Zilberstein ruled that sending a Sefer Torah specifically written to be sent to the moon is <em>still</em> forbidden, all the more so to send one which was written to be used should be forbidden!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: This same logic is brought in Feldheim’s <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/veha-rev-na-vol-2-english-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Veha’arev Na, volume 2</a>, pages 509-511. </p>\n\n\n",

The literal reading of the Rambam would say that after the days are finished (and nothing else) she is Tahor, but has to go to the Mikvah to eat Kodshim, and that this Mikvah is his own idea, not previously mentioned in the Talmud, etc. No mention of the Korbanos requirement.</p>\n\n<p>The Ra'avad argues, citing the Mishna, and wonders what on earth the Rambam is talking about. The Kesef Mishna points to where the Rambam in Avos HaTumos Chapter 12 says that until someone lacking a Korban brings it, they are not allowed to touch Kodshim, and interprets the Rambam as meaning that when the time passes and she is Tahor from everything <em>by bringing the Korbanos</em> she still has to go to the Mikvah in order to touch Kodshim.</p>\n\n<p>So to sum up, she can eat Maaser after 7/14 days and Mikvah, and eat Teruma after Korbanos, and eat Kodshim after a second time in the Mikva after that.</p>\n\n\n",

Besides, speculative studies were not open to all men, as we have already stated (Introd. p. 2, and I. chap. xxxi.), only the subjects taught in the Scriptures were accessible to all... Care having been taken, for the sake of obviating injurious influences, that the Oral Law should not be recorded in a form accessible to all, it was but natural that no portion of \"the secrets of the Law\" (i.e., metaphysical problems) would be permitted to be written down or divulged for the use of all men. These secrets, as has been explained, were orally communicated by a few able men to others who were equally distinguished. Hence the principle applied by our teachers, \"The secrets of the Law can only be entrusted to him who is a councillor, a cunning artificer, etc.\" The natural effect of this practice was that our nation lost the knowledge of those important disciplines. Nothing but a few remarks and allusions are to be found in the Talmud and the Midrashim, like a few kernels enveloped in such a quantity of husk, that the reader is generally occupied with the husk, and forgets that it encloses a kernel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Basically, knowledge was lost because of the hardships of exile as well as the desire of the Sages to keep these 'sciences' secret). </p>\n\n<p>Of course, not everybody agrees with the Rambam. Academics today mostly assume that these philosophical issues just weren't seen as being as important to the Sages and earlier Jews. The Ria\"z (Rav Yishayah of Tarani), who, like the Ravad and others, argues on the Rambam that a person who makes a theological mistake loses his share in the afterlife, proves this by saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן הדבר ידוע לכל חכמי לב, אבל מי שיטעה בכך ולא ירד לעמקו של דבר ומבין המקראות כפשוטן וסבור שהקדוש ברוך הוא בעל תמונה לא נקרא מין, שאם כן הוא הדבר, איך לא פרסמה תורה על דבר זה ולא גילו חכמי התלמוד להודיע דבר זה כגלות ולהזהיר נשים ועמי הארץ שלא יהוא אבודין עולמן. הלא כמה איסורים קלים כגון איסור מוקצה וכיוצא בה חיברו חכמים כמה הלכות והרבו כמה דקדוקין להעמיד כל דבר על מכונו, ועל דבר זה שכל האמונה תלויה בו ויש בו כרת בעולם הזה ובעולם הבא - איך לא הורו חכמים על דבר זה בגלוי! אלא ודאי לא הקפידו לכך אלא יאמין אדם הייחוד כפי שכלו ואפילו הנשים כפי מעוט שכלם שאמר משה ע\"ה שמע ישראל ה' אלדינו ה' אחד, ומשמע לשון שמועה ולשון קבלה שעל פי שמועה ועל פי קבלה יאמין דבר זה, ולא נתן משה תורה לישראל אלא בדרך אמונה ובדרך קבלה. וכן חכמי המשנה וחכמי התלמוד לא נתעסקו אלא בדרך קבלה ובדרך אמונה ולא הורו לדרוש ולחקור על ענין האלות ועל ענין שאר החכמות כלל ואם היו יחידים שהיו בקיאין בהם לא היו מורין בהם לרבים שלא צותה תורה להורות על אלה הדברים </p>\n  \n  <p>Is it not the fact that concerning even light prohibitions, such as Muktzah and the like, the Sages have composed many books and details to establish the matter correctly, and so how could it be that something like this that would be the cornerstone of belief [according to the Rambam], and contains with it the punishment of being cut off in this world and the next, that they shouldn't speak of it explicitly. Rather they clearly didn't care about it, and a person can believe in the unity [of God] according to his ability... similarly the Sages of the Mishna and Talmud believed in this in simplicity, and didn't delve in to these matters, into questions of God and these (similar) form of wisdom, and even if a few of them who were experts in them, they didn't teach them to the public because the Torah never commanded these things to be taught. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Source: Sefer Rayos Le'Riaz on Sanhedrin 91a, published in Sanhedrei Gedolah vol. 5)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>On Vayikra 9:6 the Tiferes Shmuel comments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every commandment has countless deeper implications and meanings, and even people capable of discerning some of them must realize that whatever they know is still only a drop in the bucket compared to the wealth of meaning inherent in any one of God's commands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe the same applies to your question.

Sheraira Gaon discussing textual variants in the Talmud says that multiple texts should be upheld and reconciled - each represents a valid tradition. (It could be argued, though, that newly found texts carry no such tradition)</p></li>\n<li><p>It is well known that the Rishonim spent much effort to determine the most accurate text of the Gemara. One poignant example is where the Rambam spends some time in his Mishna Torah (Hil. Malveh VeLoveh 15:2) detailing how he procured a very old manuscript of the Talmud and, based on it's version, overturned a previously accepted ruling of the Geonim. </p></li>\n<li><p>In the Urim Vetumim of R. Yonasan Eibschutz (Klalei Tokafo Cohen 123-124), he states that a litigant/defendant in beis din cannot say 'kim li' like an opinion that was newly discovered from a manuscript, if this opinion runs contrary to that of the Shulchan Aruch. R. Moshe Shternbach (4:274) extends this to any well accepted book of halakha, not just the Shulchan Aruch, meaning that manuscripts are effectively meaningless except in rare cases where there was not yet a generally accepted ruling. </p></li>\n<li><p>On the other hand, Mishkenos Yaakov (O.C. 120), in discussing a certain ruling of the Rama, lists several Rishonim to whom the Rama did not have access to their works, and states that had the Rama been privy to these manuscripts, he would have reversed his ruling. Therefore, the Mishkenos Yaakov argues on the Rama based on recently 'found' opinions. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Opinions</h2>\n\n<p>While the position of the Mishkenos Yaakov is followed by the <strong>Aruch Hashulchan</strong> (O.C. 345:17), the <strong>Teshuvos Beis Efraim</strong> (O.C. 26-27) argues based on the aforementioned Urim VeTumim. <strong>Shulchan Aruch Harav</strong>, in his siddur, says that one should be strict regarding the sale of chametz because of new manuscripts of the Rishonim that have come to light that wouldn't have been considered by the earlier Achronim. Also on the side of using manuscripts we have <strong>R. Yaakov Ettlinger</strong>, (Shu\"t Binyan Zion 69), who bases a ruling upon a newly discovered version of a Geonic teshuva. This also appears to be the opinion of the <strong>Mishna Berurah</strong>, as he approvingly cites the newly published Rabbeinu Chananel on Shabbos and uses it to argue upon the version cited by the Ran (Siman 340, Biur Halacha 'bein beyad'). It should be noted, however, that in almost all of the above cases, manuscript evidence was used to rule <em>strictly</em>, not leniently. </p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Chazon Ish</strong> (Letters vol. III no. 48) says that because the Shulchan Aruch was not actually based solely on the majority rule between the Rambam, Rif, and Rosh (despite its author's introduction), we can't use manuscripts to argue on the Shulchan Aruch, which was accepted anyway. Furthermore, he implies (Eiruvin 67:12) that we shouldn't rely on the newly published Rabbeinu Chananel because, as it hasn't been in use for centuries could therefore contain serious typographical errors. (This observation is also noted by the Seridei Eish in several places as well). In Letters of the Chazon Ish (vol. I no. 32) he also seems angry that someone should try to answer a question in the Gemara based on textual variations, and in vol. 3. letter 2, he clarifies that this is because the accepted version of the Gemara is due to divine providence. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <strong>R. Moshe Feinstein</strong> would dismiss newly discovered writings that ran contrary to his opinion (see Iggeros Moshe E.H. vol. 1 63:6, Y.D. II:7 and Y.D. III:14, plus more).</p>\n\n<p>A further issue is where a manuscript was discovered from an author who isn't known to us as a talmid chacham. <strong>R. Ben Zion Uziel</strong> writes (Choshen Mishpat, Tinyana 6:2) that we follow Rishonim because of their personal greatness, not the era in which they happened to have lived, and so just because a work is old doesn't make it reliable. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Aside from one or two extra sources, all of this came from the article linked above: Moshe Bliech, \"<a href=\"http://traditionarchive.org/news/article.cfm?id=104579\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Role of Manuscripts in Halakhic Decision Making: Hazon Ish, his Predecessors and Contemporaries</a>\", Tradition 27:2 (Winter 1993)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There is a similar question relating to the writings of Rabbi Menachem Meiri and would seem to be equally applicable to the question of the Cairo Geniza: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Meiri\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Quoting wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>His commentary was largely unknown for centuries until being\nrepublished in modern times.

A nickname is a name, which is nothing more than a 'copy' of the original like Salamon or a shortened version of it. So why today are even rabbis called up to the Torah by a name including their nickname? Like the example given of  Shlomo Zalman.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I think you might be mistaken in the premise of your question. If you were named something at your bris, it DOES become your name, even if it was originally a 'nickname' style of name. It's quite common nowadays that a person's 'Hebrew' name is based off another language (generally Yiddish, but not limited to it).</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe has a Teshuva where someone asked if he could name their daughter after a relative who only had an 'English' name. He responded that yes, it was permitted, and the name becomes a 'Hebrew' name. He proved it from the Rambam's name: Rambam stands for Rabbi Moshe Ben Maimon. Maimon was definitely not an originally 'Hebrew' name, yet that was the name he was called. While originally it might not have been entirely appropriate (but certainly not forbidden) to give a child a not-classically-Jewish name, once the name is adopted into Judaism, there is no reason not to use it. (See Igros Moshe O.C. 4 Siman 66. Igros Moshe O.C. 5 Siman 10 also has a long discussion on names, which I haven't read through yet.)</p>\n\n<p>I believe that the Aruch Hashulchan you brought in Siman 129 Sif 116 near the end where he mentions not to call people up to the Torah by nicknames is referring to nicknames that weren't given at the Bris. The Mevoh Hashe'arim you brought in the comment below seems to be the only place that mentions a Kinui given at birth, and while I'll concede his language seems to imply that Kinuyim are often given at birth, I still feel that most other places refer to Kinuyim that aren't given at birth.</p>\n\n\n",

He, being in the range of 2-4, doesn't recognize the value of having something on his head that falls off when he turns upside down.

And every day he wears it he is wearing <em>his</em> yarmulke that <em>he</em> picked out.</p>\n\n<p>I have found that it is always best to give children choices when the choices are limited to approved behaviors. Children thus feel empowered and no longer feel that they are simply taking orders from a parent but are making the decision themselves.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I don't think this is as big of a problem as you would think.

For example, see Sukkah 52b that says the Satan will testify against man in the next world, according to Rabbi Yonatan.</p>\n<p>However, rabbinic thought sees the Yetzer Hara and Satan as the same (at the very least some see it that way), such as found in Bava Batra 16a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ר\"ל הוא שטן הוא יצר הרע הוא מלאך המות הוא שטן דכתיב ויצא השטן מאת פני ה' הוא יצר הרע כתיב התם רק רע כל היום וכתיב הכא (רק את נפשו שמור) [רק אליו אל תשלח ידך] הוא מלאך המות דכתיב (רק) [אך] את נפשו שמור אלמא בדידיה קיימא א]</p>\n<p>Resh Lakish said: Satan, the evil prompter, and the Angel of Death are all one.

He is called the evil prompter:  [we know this because] it is written in another place, [Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart] was only evil continually,  and it is written here [in connection with Satan] 'Only upon himself put not forth thine hand.  The same is also the Angel of Death, since it says, Only spare his life,  which shows that Job's life belonged to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps the language of an actual being (indicated by the definite article) remained in the Hebrew, as a relic of a time in rabbinic history when it was an external character. However, the Yetzer Tov was never really an actual being, and never had to keep the definite article.</p>\n<p>Also, I don't have a source for this, but it makes sense that it's simply hard to pronounce two reshes in a row, so the definite article gets put before it to separate them.

This is described in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0230.htm#12\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shemot 30:12-14</a> and it's not clear to me who it includes.  It says \"<strong>when</strong> you take a census\" and the censuses that are described are of soldiers; on the other hand, it also says \"that there be no plague among them\", and that seems like it would apply to everybody.  Rashi does not clarify this.</p>\n<p>Did women over 20 and/or Levi'im get to go into Eretz Yisrael 40 years later (those who hadn't died for other reasons by then)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Rashi means to say that the Leviim were <em>not</em> killed over the forty years. It often happens that Rashi will quote the 'wrong' pasuk to simplify his point; what he is really referring to is the count at the beginning of Sefer Bamidbar, where indeed the count is described as a census of soldiers (or יוצא צבא \"those who go out with the army\"). This is evident from his comments on Bamidbar 1:49, where Rashi states (quoting from the Gemara in Bava Basra 121):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Holy One Blessed Be He, foresaw that a decree would be made on all those who are counted from twenty years and upward that they will die in the desert, [so Hashem] said, \"Let these [Leviim] not be included\". </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding the women as well, Rashi writes (Parshas Pinchas, Bamidbar 26:64) that the women were not included in the decree to have to die in the desert. He happens to give a different reason, namely, \"because they loved the land [of Canaan], the decree was not made upon them\", but this might be an explanation as to why there was no <em>second</em> decree against them once there was a decree against the men. </p>\n\n\n",

Milk and meat</strong>: it is forbidden to cook meat from a kosher animal with milk (see MT <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Foods.9.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Maacholot Asurot 9:1</a> and further sources <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2017/11/02/basar-bchalav-question/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>There might be ways to circumvent these prohibitions, e.g., cook only poultry or meat from non-kosher animals, or cook in non-kosher milk (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.87.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA YD 87:3</a>). Alternatively <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/112/Q1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ohr.edu</a> suggests a non-Jew could light the fire while a Jew cooks.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, Rav Moshe Soloveitchik ruled that one may cook meat and milk together for a scientific experiment in which there is clearly no intention to eat the mixture (see Rabbi Hershel Schachter's \"Peninei Ha-Rav,\" p. 152, quoted <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjEjsS03tHXAhXKD8AKHbGJDDsQFggtMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fetzion.org.il%2Fen%2Fdownload%2Ffile%2Ffid%2F4096&usg=AOvVaw0HgmyFJ8M9RXEpiIsRtpoZ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). A rav would have to be consulted to see if one can extend it to cooking in a school since there is a benefit as well (learning to cook) if there was no intention to eat it either.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><em>2. Marit ayin</em></strong> prevents a Jew from doing anything that gives the appearance of transgressing the law, even if he technically doesn't. A relevant example here is eating meat in almond milk.</p>\n\n<p>R David Brofsky <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjEjsS03tHXAhXKD8AKHbGJDDsQFggtMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fetzion.org.il%2Fen%2Fdownload%2Ffile%2Ffid%2F4096&usg=AOvVaw0HgmyFJ8M9RXEpiIsRtpoZ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> there is a <em>machloket poskim</em> (rabbinical dispute) whether marit ayin applies in such a case. The Rashba (Teshuvot 3:257), and later the Rema (YD 87:4) rule that a priori one should not cook a non-kosher animal in milk because of mar'it ayin.  The Shakh and Taz both challenge this ruling.</p>\n\n<p>For a Jew to cook in a cooking school, he would have to explain all the precautions he is taking not to transgress halacha, incl. the fact he wouldn't eat the food or serve it to Jews.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As always, <a href=\"http://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9146\">speak to your rav</a> before attempting anything you have read about on the Internet.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In addition to the problems mentioned in @mbloch's answer, I think the major issue a kosher keeper attending a non-kosher culinary school will run into is the expectation that they taste things.  Those teaching cooking in any context assert that you need to taste your food all the way along, to see how it is seasoned, if anything is needed, etc.  Also, it is helpful to taste what others cook to detect subtle flavors.  </p>\n\n<p>In terms of tasting the food one cooks, and the foods others cook, one needs to confront absorbed flavors in the utensils used.  Even if the kosher culinary student himself only cooks kosher ingredients, the pots, pans, ovens etc will have absorbed non-kosher flavors from other students cooking non-kosher foods.  </p>\n\n<p>You could try asking over on <a href=\"https://cooking.stackexchange.com/\">Seasoned Advice</a> about culinary school without tasting anything, but I doubt it would be well received most places.  I am sure people with various food allergies have attended culinary school, so I imagine especially now schools will have dealt with it on some level before, but seemingly the kosher culinary student can taste almost nothing that he is cooking as opposed to the allergic chef who needs accommodation for a unit or two (depending on of course the allergy).  </p>\n\n<p>I recall some years ago hearing about a course through <a href=\"https://www.escoffieronline.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Escoffier Online</a> where one attends culinary school through distance learning.  Since the cooking is done in one's own home, it occurred to me that this seemed a good option for getting culinary education without dealing with non-kosher pans in culinary school. I don't know if this degree achieves the same goals as going to culinary school, such as if it is likely to get you a job.  As I was looking at it as a hobby & not a career, I thought the price was too high, but for a career it may well be reasonably priced.  It does include units on non-kosher ingredients, like pork & shellfish, which the kosher student needs to either negotiate not studying or acquire a few non-kosher utensils and study without tasting.  </p>\n\n\n",

Displaying detailed kashrus information like waiting time after cheese might stand out too starkly.</p>\n<p>Also, Kosher consumers may get confused by too much kashrus information. The OU stopped specifying whether a product was only dairy equipment and opted for the simpler OU-D for both true diary and dairy equipment for this very reason. Some other agencies still display DE for dairy equipment.

Rav Ovadia Yosef holds that your wife must count 4 days starting from the last day she had martial relations before making hefsek tahara. Most women bleed for 5 days anyway, so this is unlikely to make a practical difference in your life (though you may be able to take advantage of this leniency occasionally).</p>\n\n<p>This generally applies regardless of the type of stain or bleeding that caused your wife to become tamei. Rav Ovadia has some leniencies that follow from the way he says to count, but you're also unlikely to be in a position to take advantage of those leniencies. (And if you are in such a position, your wife may nevertheless not want the pressure of doing bedikot right away.)</p>\n\n<p>Some other examples of differences in their psak are in harchakot (the rules of separating husband and wife when she's not tahor):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rav Ovadia permits you to listen to your wife's singing. Rav Mordechai Eliyahu does not.</li>\n<li>Rav Ovadia permits you to go on pleasure trips with your wife. Rav Mordechai Eliyahu does not.</li>\n<li>Rav Ovadia permits you to sit on a bench, couch, or swing with your wife. Rav Mordechai Eliyahu does not.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are plenty of other differences in other aspects of niddah as well, but I don't know those so well, and don't want to list the ones I do know in detail. Rav Mordechai Eliyahu tends to rule more similarly to Ashkenazi poskim (following the Rema in many more places) than Rav Ovadia does.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you're learning to prepare for your wedding, you need to ask your rav whom you should be holding by.</strong> I personally follow Rav Ovadia in everything (niddah, and other stuff, l'chumra and l'kula), because my Rav in Chicago is a talmid of Rav Ovadia.</p>\n\n<p>If you're learning according to Rav Mordechai Eliyahu, the sefer to learn is Darchei Tahara (as Robert explained in his answer).</p>\n\n<p>If you're learning according to Rav Ovadia Yosef, the sefer to learn is Torat HaTahara by his son, Rav David Yosef (it's in Hebrew, get the edition with the red cover). There's an English book according to Rav Ovadia's psak by another son, Rav Avraham Yosef named \"Taharat Yosef,\" but I don't recommend learning from it. R' Avraham's coverage of the number of days your wife needs to count is so unclear as to be misleading.</p>\n\n<p>If you're learning according to Rav Ovadia, you should also read Rav Mordechai Eliyahu's book, because Torat HaTahara doesn't have very good coverage of the calculations that you uses to know when to separate from your wife in anticipation of her period (vestot). Torat HaTahara also doesn't discuss conduct in the bedroom with your wife (nor have I found this in any of Rav Ovadia's other writings), while Rav Mordechai Eliyahu's book does. Both of these are things you'll want to know.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the former omission, my rav told me that Rav Ovadia wrote about vestot for his sefer Taharat HaBayit (on which R' David's book is based), but the chapters were lost before they could be published, and Rav Ovadia never rewrote them.</p>\n\n<p>If you have the time, and are interested in a deeper understanding of all of the concepts and issues in hilchot niddah, I strongly recommend <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1592643256\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Laws and Concepts of Niddah by Rabbi Zvi Sobolofsky</a>, a Rosh Yeshiva at Yeshiva University. I've only skimmed that sefer myself, but <a href=\"http://torahmusings.com/2011/06/book-review-the-laws-and-concepts-of-niddah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here is a review</a>. (But don't read that as a substitute for the Sephardic rav who you'll be holding by. It's more important to know the halacha l'ma'aseh than it is to know the concepts.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Eliyahu requires waiting a minimum of 5 days before hefsek taharah, while Rav Ovadia Yosef follows the Shulchan Aruch's opinion and allows waiting a minimum of four days.</p>\n\n<p>SO: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/31373/2205\">Minimum Number of Days before Hefsek Tahara: Sephardi vs. Ashkenazi</a></p>\n\n<p>Rav Eliyahu has a book available both in English and Hebrew on the subject, it's name in Hebrew is דרכי טהרה.

And when the nine guys come to Barchu and see that one is missing - they call the person to sit in the room, where they pray, so they would have Minyan. Of course the person in question can learn better without guys praying around him. And the question is, can he deny the request or not.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One source that is relevant to this issue is Rabbeinu Yonah haGerondi (13th c.) on the Rif, Berakhot 4a. There, he brings the opinion of the rabbonim of France that one need not leave one's place of learning in order to pray in a minyan:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פירשו רבני צרפת ז״ל שאפ׳ בלא עשרה היו עושין כן מפני שיותר נכון להתפלל\n  יחידי במקום ששם קביעות התורה יומם ולילה מלהתפלל בבהכ״נ בצבור כדאמרינן\n  אוהב הקב״ה שערים המצוינין בהלכה יותר מבתי כנסיות... אין צריך עשרה אלא\n  למי שדרכו ללכת מביתו ללמד למקום אחר... אבל מי שלומד בביתו כל היום\n  במקום קבוע ותורתו אמנותו אין לו ללכת לבית הכנסת אם לא ימצא עשרה מפני\n  שנמצא מתבטל מלמודו בשעת הליכה</p>\n  \n  <p>The rabbonim of France explained that even without ten men they\n  [prayed in the beit midrash], since it is better to pray alone in a\n  place designated for the study of Torah day and night than to pray in\n  a synagogue in a congregation, as it says: \"The Holy One, blessed is\n  he, loves the gates of halakha more than the synagogues\"... One only\n  requires a minyan if it is one's custom to leave one's house [to pray]\n  elsewhere... but one who learns in his home all day in a set place,\n  whose learning is his occupation, needs not go to the synagogue if he\n  is without a minyan, since he will waste time by walking there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note, however, that these rabbonim are speaking of one who is learning farther from the synagogue than you have described in your question, and that they focus on the obligation that the scholar has to <em>himself</em>, and not to a group of nine people who might require his participation. As such, I am aware that this is only a partial answer to your question, and I intend to update it, <em>bli neder</em>, as I find more information.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Rambam in Hilchos Tefillah 9:1 seems to understand praying with a minyan as not so much of an obligation, but a good strategy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תפילת הציבור, נשמעת תמיד; ואפילו היו בהן חטאים, אין הקדוש ברוך הוא מואס תפילתן של רבים.  לפיכך צריך אדם לשתף עצמו עם הציבור, ולא יתפלל יחידי, כל זמן שיכול להתפלל בציבור.  ולעולם ישכים אדם ויעריב לבית הכנסת, שאין תפילתו של אדם נשמעת בכל עת, אלא בבית הכנסת.  וכל מי שיש לו בית הכנסת בעירו, ואינו נכנס לתוכה להתפלל--נקרא שכן רע</p>\n<p>(paraphrased) The prayer of the community is always heard [by Hashem].  Therefore, a person needs* to join the congregation whenever he can.  Prayer is not always heard unless you are praying with the congregation.  Anyone who doesn't join the community to pray is a bad neighbor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam does not describe it as an obligation or even a mitzvah. He couches it in terms of its beneficial effect.</p>\n<p>I would conclude that according to the Rambam, one could not apply the principle of stopping learning to perform a mitzvah, as he will not be performing, or even facilitating, a mitzvah.  You may be doing them a favor, but not a mitzvah.</p>\n<p>This is not meant to be practical halacha, just a presentation of what I believe to be the opinion of the Rambam.</p>\n<p>*That which the Rambam says you \"need\" to join the community for prayer is clear that it does not mean to imply an obligation, as the source of that line is actually a reference to that which one should say the Wayfarer's Prayer in plural, which is not even codified by the Rambam.</p>\n\n\n",

That is thirty times more people than would fill Madison Square Garden.</p>\n\n<p>And just a follow up question: if Moses actually spoke to the leaders, which passed things down to their respective tribes and groups, then doesn't Judaism actually become a religion handed down by a small group of people?

    "content": "# What is a megillah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>5 of the books of Kesuvim are called Megillas (Maseches Sofrim 14:3 identifies 4 of them, Rus, Shir Hashirim, Eicha, and Ester.  Rishonim cite versions that add in Koheles - e.g. Mordechai Megilla 783).  What classifies something as a Megillah? Is it anything more than the fact that it is publicly read?  Are there any practical applications of it's being a Megillah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'll give it a go. </p>\n\n<p>The tanakh uses the word megillah in various places. These often appear in works of prophesy, from Jeremiah's burnt scroll (Jer. 36:27) to Zechariah's flying scroll (Zec. 1:1), which imply that they were meant to be addressed to the larger community (interestingly, the events around Esther were inscribed (Es. 9:30) in <em>sefarim</em>). There were also other documents referred to as <em>megillot</em> throughout Jewish history, such as <em>Megillat Ta'anit</em>, that recorded information for practical application in Jewish communities. The function of a <em>megillah</em> is understood from its etymology, the root <em>g-l-h</em>, to mean that which is disclosed or revealed (to the public). </p>\n\n<p>What makes these five books <em>megillot</em>, as opposed to other books in <em>Ketuvot</em>, besides being generally short (they are shorter than the rest in <em>Ketuvot</em>), is that they have a long tradition of being read publicly. In practical terms, <em>megillot</em> are written on parchment scrolls and follow much of the same laws of lettering and sewing required of a Torah scroll. </p>\n\n<p>Although the Gemara (B. Batra 14b) orders all of <em>Ketuvot</em> chronologically, ancient manuscripts of the Tanakh (like the Leningrad Codex) orders the <em>megillot</em> as their own unit. This is probably because of the long history they have of being read publicly, particularly around Jewish holidays and particularly in Ashkenazic communities (most Sephardim do not read <em>Kohelet</em> on Sukkot or <em>Rut</em> on Shavuot). As a consequence to having a history of being read, there is a more established tradition of musical cantillations for the <em>megillot</em> than for the rest of <em>Ketuvot</em> (although certain communities have or once had traditions for other books we well).</p>\n\n<p>But there's more. In rabbinic literature, the <em>megillot</em> do share discussion space, in terms of their holy status in the Tanakh, derivation from Divine inspiration, and ability to confer impurity (cf. Yadayim 3, Shabbat 30b, Eduyot 5:6, Megillah 7a). AFAIK, aside from being read on festivals, there is no practical distinction between the <em>megillot</em> and other books in <em>Ketuvot</em>, except for the fact that Esther and (possibly) Shir Hashirim do not contain Hashem's name (so they are often the first texts written by scribes-in-training). And, of course, because they are read in festivals, scribes write them generally much more often than other books from <em>Na'Kh</em>. There are, however, synagogues that read the <em>haftarot</em> from a scribal writing and there is the popular <a href=\"http://www.ha-zohar.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94-%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%93_Page_4-712x1024.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Lamnatzeach Menorah</em></a> from <em>Tehillim</em> that some read from during their prayers. The other practical application of a Torah text being a <em>megillah</em>, first mentioned in <em>Soferim</em> 14, is whether to recite a blessing before reading it in public (cf. Beit Yosef Orach Chaim 559).</p>\n\n<p>Because <em>Esther</em> is the only megillah whose reading is a rabbinical mitzvah, as opposed to the developed customs of reading the others (which can be read from non-scribal texts), there are halakhot on its production that are required in order to fulfill the mitzvah of reading it. These include writing it with kosher ink, on parchment, scoring it, and having an end pole attached to it (cf. O''C 691). These halakhot are what <em>make</em> something a produced <em>megillah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it should be noted that the history of when these books were first used as <em>megillot</em> to be read for the festivals is not so clear. <em>Esther</em> is obviously the earliest (during the last beit hamikdash). Then comes <em>Eicha</em>, discussed as a reading for Tisha B'Av in <em>Ta'anit</em> 30a. Then, at some point with unclear reasons, <em>Shir HaShirim</em> and <em>Rut</em>. That <em>Kohelet</em> is not included in the list in <em>Soferim</em> likely indicates that it only became a custom to read it after the gaonic era, and the reason that it was introduced is likewise speculative. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is there so much focus on Women's Modesty among Orthodox Jews?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Based on the amount of attention given to women's modesty, one could argue that being modest is their primary role in Judaism. (I think I've even seen that said explicitly.) Women are obligated in many other mitzvot (and it's unclear if modesty is even an <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/35151/is-there-an-actual-mitzvah-for-women-to-dress-tzanua-in-and-of-itself\">actual mitzva</a>), yet this is the one that gets focused on.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, there are dozens of books addressing women's modesty, yet I have never seen a single one dedicated to men. On this site alone there are nearly a dozen questions about women's modesty: What clothes women should wear, how women should act, etc, and only a couple of questions regarding men's modesty.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why is there so much focus on Women's Modesty among Orthodox Jews?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Follow-up: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/38747/what-are-the-halachot-of-tznius-as-they-relate-to-men\">What are the Halachot of Tznius as they relate to men?</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Rav Yaakov Weinberg was once asked this question at a convention in Richmond, VA. The following is a summary of his response.</p>\n\n<p>Man was created with a Divine purpose, to be a spiritual being interacting with a physical world.  This required that he go out into the world.  But he is not meant to be a businessman - he is meant to be a man who is involved in business.  He faces the challenge of becoming overly involved in the outside world and seeing that as his primary sphere of existence, and the danger of losing his focus.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, there has to be a Jewish home which is unaffected by the outside world.  This is the crucial role that the Jewish woman, the עקרת הבית, serves.  She is to remain unaffected by the outside world, and maintain a pure atmosphere which can serve as a base from which to venture into the outside world.  Therefore כל כבודה דבת מלך פנימה, all the honor of the princess is internal.  And therefore women have the burden of modesty, as the role of modesty is to remain internally focused and to not draw attention to yourself. The woman is the anchor which keeps the Jewish unit focused on its mission.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There is a general trend toward strictness in charedi communities, which manifests itself in many areas of law, including tznius. (Among Modern Orthodox communities, people tend to follow the basic rules (headcoverings, usually; shirts past elbows; skirts past knees; no low-cut tops) without a lot of discussion and controversy.) There are some reasons why tznius is one of these areas in which charedi Judaism has become increasingly strict.</p>\n\n<p>Sexual transgressions are not seen as very important in today's Western society (except in the case of rape and adultery). But in the Torah, the Gemara, and later rabbinical literature, these sins are considered to be of utmost gravity. </p>\n\n<p>For example, the Shulchan Aruch (Even HaEzer 23:1) says that masturbation is the worst sin in the Torah (though this may have been intended as an exaggeration -- see here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16052/if-masturbation-is-so-bad-why-is-it-not-in-list-of-613-mitzvos\">If masturbation is so bad, why is it not in list of 613 Mitzvos?</a>). The Gemara says that one may not derive pleasure from even looking at the pinky finger of a woman other than one's wife (Sanhedrin 75, Berachos 24a). Even improper sexual thoughts (such as thinking about having relations with a woman other than one's wife) are considered serious sins. See this index of references to modesty in the Gemara: <a href=\"http://www.webshas.org/ishus/tznius.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.webshas.org/ishus/tznius.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>In addition, kabbalistic and chassidic thought has tended to put great emphasis on the importance of sexual purity (keeping one's behavior and mind free from sexual sin). According to some literature in this area, sexual sins are the root of all sin, and conquering the desire for illicit sex is understood to be the key to advancing spiritually and fulfilling the spiritual mission of one's soul on earth. (As an example, see this chapter in Likutei Eitzos: <a href=\"http://www.azamra.org/Advice/covenant.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.azamra.org/Advice/covenant.html</a>). Although many Modern Orthodox Jews have an interest in kabbalah, chassidus or other forms of mysticism, charedim tend to be more heavily influenced by mysticism. This is an additional reason for the charedi interest in tznius.</p>\n\n<p>If women dress in an alluring way, it will be harder for men to resist staring at them, which can lead to numerous serious transgressions, including lewd thoughts, masturbation, and adultery. </p>\n\n<p>One common response from outsiders is that \"well the men just need to control themselves.\" Yet every society imposes norms on its members, in terms of the minimum areas of the body that must be covered by women. Such norms are necessary, given the explosive power of sexuality (consider the association between adultery and murder, for example)) and the impulsiveness of many men (and some women) in this area. Even contemporary American society has its limits. Jewish law and tradition has its own specific requirements, which, since they have a divine origin, must be better geared toward human nature than the rules of other societies (at least for Jews). </p>\n\n<p>Under the basic halacha, there are certain minimum rules (\"dat moshe\"), and according to communal norms in each area, there are additional rules (\"dat yehudit,\" custom derived from the practice of Jewish women). Observance of these additional rules ensures that certain women do not stand out and attract the attention of men. For example, what in one community may seem normal may seem alluring in another. Charedi communities, insulated from wider cultural trends in Western society, tend to develop their own stricter dress norms, which seem to have become stricter over time. This may be the result of the evolution of dat yehudit (as some women adopt stricter practices, others follow) or as a result of rabbinic rulings.</p>\n\n<p>An additional reason for the increasing charedi attention to and strictness in the laws of tznius for women has to do with the structure of these communities. Most chassidic communities are governed by a living rebbe whose advice or rulings are taken extremely seriously. Since the Lubavitcher Rebbe said that sheitels were preferable to other headcoverings, nearly all Chabad women have worn sheitels. Non-chassidic charedi communities also closely follow the rulings of their own local rabbis and community-wide gedolim. Modern Orthodox Judaism, by contrast, is less centralized and more individualistic. Even so, Modern Orthodox Jews have become somewhat more strict about tznius over the last generations as well.</p>\n\n<p>The greater attention to the tznius of women (as opposed to men) can be explained as follows. First, traditionally, Jewish men have tended to dress in modest ways, with long sleeve shirts and coats and pants that are not form fitting. There was not a tradition of men walking around shirtless or with skin-tight muscle shirts. In charedi communities, men actually dress more modestly than the women -- since it is very hard to see the shape of a man's body when he is wearing a coat, and a long beard covers up one's facial features (such as one's mouth, chin and jaw). For this reason, there is not a specific need for clarifying the rules of men's dress. Second, men are more \"visual\" in their sexuality than women, and often tend to stare at women and have lewd thoughts about them. While women may do this as well, their yetzer hara is not as strong in this area.</p>\n\n<p>A final thought: it may seem that all the effort put into modesty in women's dress is solely for the benefit of men's spirituality and avoidance of sin. Yet the correct observance of the laws of tznius are also of great spiritual and practical importance to women, and helps elevate them spirituality. First, their observance helps reduce the sins of others. Second, it reinforces the cultivation of modesty and humility more generally in one's conduct. Third, when men are not tempted by looking at other women they are more satisfied with their wives, and will be less likely to mistreat, neglect or leave them, and will instead appreciate and honor them. Finally, when women do need to interact with men other than their husbands, as in the workplace or marketplace, the laws of modesty promote a healthy distance between men and women and prevent everyday interactions from becoming sexualized. Even in the home between spouses, the laws of modesty prevent sexuality from being in the forefront of one's consciousness, so that couples may develop their relationship in other ways.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It likely stems from the same thing that causes people in general to be judgmental. By our very nature we focus on the external and categorize people, sometimes without realizing it. Degree of modesty by way of dress, being a visual characteristic, (and the first thing one notices when encountering others), provides an immediate label which people can pin on others. Is it right? Absolutely not, in fact it contradicts a very clear law in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0319.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviticus 19:15</a>. Do some people not struggle with it at all? Absolutely, everyone has unique strengths and weaknesses. Things others struggle with may be easy for you, and vice versa. No one is perfect.</p>\n\n<p>The best thing one can do is lead by example by shelving the preconceived notions that our hearts send our way, loving our fellow Jews, and judging them favorably as best as we can.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Being meticulous regarding the laws pesach vs eating cheilev\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why are people so meticulous regarding what they eat on Pesach? For example some people won't eat fish and/or fruit that don't have peels. However, what about meat? You don't see people saying, \"Don't eat meat because it might be cheilev.\" And they are both kares-prohibitions (chometz and cheilev).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The basis of the custom is from the Arizal, who says that one who is careful from even a Mashehu (any amount) of Chametz on Pesach will not sin (accidentally) the whole year. Therefore as many stringencies as possible should be kept.</p>\n\n<p>This is brought in halachic Achronim, most notably the Ba'er Hetev on Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim (which is where it was most popularized).</p>\n\n<p>So it is in pursuit of this promise/in recognition of the importance of it as personified by this promise that you see such stringency as compared to other Kares prohibitions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Chametz on Pesach happens to be one of the only prohibitions even when it gets mixed with some other substance, doesn't become nullified (Batel Beshishim). The only other prohibition I could think of off the top of my head that has similar restrictions is Yayin Nesech (and other Avodah-Zarah related issurim).</p>\n\n<p>Another difference would be the fact that Chametz is not always noticeably different than non-Chametz. Of course, There is an obvious difference between bread and Matzah, but some of the more nuanced forms of Chametz aren't as distinguishable (i.e. the difference between dough that rose for 18 minutes and dough that rose for 20). There is even a whole chapter in the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (107) dealing with how to handle the flour in ways that won't become Chometz, and while I don't claim to be an expert about baking, I'm assuming the 'Chametz' that it's referring to is something slightly less noticeable than a bagel. A butcher, on the other hand, knows which piece of meat is Cheilev and which isn't, since it's easily possible to physically discern where it is. Even though I personally couldn't tell the difference between one piece of meat and another, I don't have to be concerned that it might be Cheilev, since I know that someone who DOES know what he's doing took care of it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A relative of mine (no further source available) suggested that on Pesach, we became a new nation. Just as one is extremely careful with a newborn infant, for whom an injury or illness can be much more severe than for an adult, one is extremely careful with the laws of Pesach - the holiday of the nation's birth.</p>\n\n\n",

After all, the <em>m'kosheish</em> gathered the wood with an intent unrelated to the wood itself.

Yosef Albo in Sefer HaIkarim 3:23 (which is why I'm unsure as to why it still has a negative score). Since I don't have a better way of doing this, I'm going to just paste here what I wrote to this similar question, with a couple of variations.</p>\n<h2>1. Idiomatic Expressions</h2>\n<p>Some differences between the Written Law and its explanation can be simply explained by saying that the expression in the text of the Torah literally means what the Oral Law says, and that's how it would have been interpreted by any reader of the Torah around the time and place where it was written - <em>even without the Oral tradition</em>. In other words, these are idioms or expressions whose meaning would have been clear to the original recipients of the Torah and we only needed to preserve these <em>peirushim hamekubalim misinai</em> because these expressions might fall out of use and need to be understood thousands of years later. For example, the Torah commands that <em>[these things/words should be] 'totafos' between your eyes</em> (Devarim 6:4). Disregarding the meaning of totafos, why would the Torah say 'between your eyes' when it means 'above your hairline' (Shulchan Aruch 27:9)? The answer, as evidenced by Ugaritic texts, is this is what the phrase actually means, as it is an idiom for the front of the head, not the nose-bridge between the eyes. [footnote 1]</p>\n<p>Thus, the <strong>Ibn Ezra</strong> would probably tell you (see his intro to commentary on Chumash as well as throughout his commentary), the halakha does indeed follow peshat - the peshat just might not be what you, an English-speaking reader in the 21st century might think it is; peshat is how the reader in c. 2000 BCE Judea would be reading it. See <a href=\"http://www.biu.ac.il/js/JSIJ/10-2012/Cohen.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a> which argues that the <strong>Rambam</strong> felt this way as well (though I personally am not convinced that this is the case).</p>\n<h2>2. Levels of Meaning</h2>\n<p>Let us grant, however, that there are many more cases where <em>peirushim hamekubalim misinai</em> are not idiomatic expressions, but deviations or reinterpretations of the text. This is certainly the position taken by the <strong>Rashbam</strong>, as well as, I would guess, the majority of commentators. The most striking and oft-discussed example is the requirement for an injurer to pay 'an eye for an eye' (Shemos 21:23), which the Sages interpret to mean monetary payment (Bava Kamma 83b). While one may argue that this runs against the plain meaning of the Written Law, it isn't so clear, because the Torah also says (assuming that the Torah is one unified whole, written by One divine Author) \"you cannot accept money as reimbursement for a murder\" (Bamidbar 35:31), clearly implying that money can be accepted as payment for injury. (However, the Ibn Ezra seems to think that this too is an an idiom, as in the example above).</p>\n<p>The first approach is that the somewhat misleading message that is gleaned from seeing only one fragment of the Torah's larger picture is that the Torah intends to convey multiple levels of meaning, which are true on varying level, even if only one of them can be acted upon in terms of halakhic implementation. This seems to be brought out often in the commentary of the Ramban, who often gives explanations of the verses according to Chazal, and then a different explanation 'al pi peshat', and a third 'al derech ha'emes', and the Ramban sees no contradiction; all these meanings are intended by the verse even if only one of them can be used in halakha. In the example discussed, there may be levels in which the strict 'eye for an eye' is indeed true. The Rikanti on the pasuk in Shemos 21:23 asks, why couldn't the Torah just say 'pay money'? He shows that the manner in which the pasuk is written does teach certain kabbalistic truths. The Rambam too, may not think that there are mystical lessons taught by the 'peshat', but the moral lessons to be gained from the mitzvos are better gained from reading the peshat (Moreh Nevuchim 3:41 and in Hil. Chovel U'Mazik 1:1). Thus, the 'partial picture' of reading one pasuk in Shemos actually teaches us Torah messages, if not the halakha. [footnote 3]</p>\n<h2>3. Emphasizes the Importance of an Oral Tradition</h2>\n<p>R. Chasdai Crescas in the beginning of Ohr Hashem explains that the reason why we have 'two Torahs' and that the Written Torah is so unclear is so that it be obvious that we shouldn't rely solely on the Written Law. As Hillel told a convert, we need to rely on the Sages and the tradition in order to understand what any word may mean (Shabbos 31a), and besides, there are simply too many details to be fully contained in a book. Therefore, to make sure that we would never make the mistake of attempting to interpret the Torah without the Oral Tradition, Hashem made sure that there would be contradictions, ambiguities, etc. This explanation, in different forms, has been repeated by many others over the generations, including R. Crescas' student, R. Yosef Albo (Sefer HaIkkarim 2:23)</p>\n<p>In what may be deemed a variation of this explanation, R. Yaakov Zvi Mecklenberg, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14121&st=&pgnum=6&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in the intro to Hakesav Vehakabalah</a>, says that the Oral Torah is like the 'soul' of a physical body, and is therefore too sublime and extensive to be contained in a physical manner, but rather is left to be recognized as infinite and unending. In other words, the Torah contains so-to-speak 'imprecise' language to indicate that its true meaning is more exalted than anything that can be contained in language.</p>\n<h2>4. Flexibility of Interpretation</h2>\n<p>Thus far, we have only discussed explanations of phrases where the halakha may be different that the phrase's plain meaning, but there are other parts to the Oral Law. In the Rambam's division of the Oral Torah into five parts, he names the third part 'hekeshos', things learned from derashot such as 'gezairah shava' and the like. In these areas, it's unclear whether or not they can go against the plain meaning of the text. In Bava Kama 7b it appears that a gezaira shava cannot override the plain meaning of the text, though to what extent may be subject to an argument between R. Akiva and R. Yishmael.</p>\n<p>In this area of the Oral Law, which involves the usage of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmudical_hermeneutics\" rel=\"noreferrer\">hermeneutical principles</a>, there is considerable amount of flexibility of interpretation, which is why the Talmud is so full of arguments and different opinions. In fact, while many are aware of the concept that one court cannot annul the decrees of an earlier court unless it is greater בחכמה ובמנין (in wisdom and number), the Rambam (Hil. Mamrim 1:1-2) believes that this is only true regarding Rabbinic enactments, but with regards to interpreting the Torah - any Beis Din Hagadol can undo the interpretations of that of an earlier generation. Regarding this specific form of \"Oral Law\" therefore, some have suggested that the reason for its not being set in writing was in order to allow for flexibility. R. Moshe Shmuel Glasner, in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37184&st=&pgnum=5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">introduction to Dor Revii</a>, says that the Torah allowed for this flexibility in order to 'match with the times' so to speak, and such an idea seems to exist in the writings of Rav Kook as well.

''Halacha L'Moshe miSinai'' is, as he explains, a technical term for the kind of פירוש מקובל מסיני that has no Scriptural indication. The Sinaitic oral explanation that ''an eye for an eye'' means monetary compensation does have Scriptural indication.</p>\n<p>ו  אף על פי שדברים אלו נראים מעניין תורה שבכתב, כולן מפורשין הן מפי משה מהר סיניי, וכולן הלכה למעשה הן בידינו</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This was basically asked to Hillel by the convert who was only willing to accept the written law. Hillel showed him, that anyone reading the Torah needs to rely on a teacher to tell them that a certain word means what it means, and so clearly there must have been a tradition of interpretation. (Shabbos 31a) That very self-same tradition, it so happens to be, not only includes translations/interpretation, but additions (halakha lemoshe misinai) as well. Once we are forced to accept one aspect of that tradition, we need to accept the rest as well. </p>\n\n<p>When it comes to <em>specific</em> laws - it wouldn't be possible to have a written record, because these matters were prohibited to be written (Temurah 14b), and therefore we're going to have to take them on faith. There's no other way for there to be any evidence. (For example, even if you dug up tefillin from every generation since Moshe, and they were all black, I could tell you that that was merely because it was the easiest color ink to make, or traditional, but not because it was told to Moshe by God at Sinai- we have no audio recordings from that particular event). </p>\n\n\n",

But that it was instead written down over the years, and perhaps compiled finally sometime when Shmuel was alive.</p>\n\n<p>How do we refute these claims? How would we go about advancing the argument that the Torah is Divine from Sinai? And that Moshe existed, etc.?</p>\n\n<p>I have a few ideas and theories of my own, but I was wondering what you all can come up with...</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I see that the current version of this idiocy (which has been around since Wellhausen the antisemite invented it) tries to pretend that the Torah was invented by Shmuel Hanavi, at the end of the period of the Judges. This was only a few centuries after the Exodus since Shlomo finished building the first temple 480 years after the Exodus and the mishkan at Shilo had existed long before that (including artifacts from the original mishkan in the desert). Thus, the Torah and halachos were well known long before Shmuel was born and \"new\" laws could not have been invented then.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I use the term anti-semite for Wellhausen based on all the comments that I have seen over the past 40 years as well as the notes in the Hertz Chumash. As an example <a href=\"http://www.ajcongress.org/site/DocServer/Assimilationofjudaism.pdf?docID=2124\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.ajcongress.org/site/DocServer/Assimilationofjudaism.pdf?docID=2124</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Despite Kant’s call for the “euthanasia of Judaism” and despite\n  Wellhausen’s blatant anti-Semitic tendencies, early liberal Judaism,\n  as it emerged in Germany and later in America, adapted many of the\n  views of Kant and Wellhausen, and incorporated them into its\n  understanding of the nature of Judaism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I should also point out that the \"argument\" here is <strong>not</strong> that Shmuel wrote Shoftim from \"stories\" that had existed since the time of the conquest and the completion of Sefer Yehoshua, but that he (or later neviim, or kohanim in the time of Josiah or Anshei Knesses Hagedolah or whatever the \"critics\" decide to pretend) made up the <strong>Torah</strong> and the halachos out of whole cloth and assigned to it whatever traditions and stories had accreted throughout the centuries. According to that, there was no revelation, no Yetzias Mitzrayim, no halacha, etc. It is calling all the neviim, liars and neviei sheker, since it implies that they never received prophesy from Hashem (which assumes that all previous neviim and the Torah were telling the truth to begin with). Any claim that the mesorah began at some point other than the revelation at Sinai is making this claim, whether or not it admits it.</p>\n\n<p>For Shmuel to make things up, he would also have to make up Sefer Yehoshua and Shoftim. Of course he did write Sefer Shoftim, but the point I am making is that he brought the \"stories\" up to his current time. If he made things up as claimed, this actually winds up having him make up things that had occurred well within the memory of people then living as well as the records that had been kept by the various tribes since the Exodus and the settling of Israel. Also (as I say above) the mishkan of Shilo had existed for centuries and had records of the kohanim who served there as well as the people who went there. There was no time that he could have invented things and \"merged\" earlier stories into what was still known and remembered.</p>\n\n<p>Another point is that he wrote Sefer Shoftim using nevua. As a result, he could not have lied about what he wrote without being a navi sheker. Those who claim that he \"created\" the Torah, and sefer Yehoshua (as well as inventing stories that never happened in Shoftim) are saying that the prophets were liars who did not receive any messages from Hashem. They are claiming that they were false prophets who were subject to the death penalty.</p>\n\n<p>Most of these claims try to say that everything was made up during the later part of the monarchy or by the Anshei Knesses Hagedolah. In any case, they ignore the actual facts of the matter.</p>\n\n<p>One of the main problems with the conspiracy theory is that we state that the entire Jewish people heard the revelation at Sinai. The \"Fred theory\" states that someone (call him Fred) decided to invent the entire thing and convinced everyone to pretend to believe it. This was done in spite of the entire previous generations were still alive and would never have heard of such a thing. \"Fred\" also invented a complete system of laws and convinced everyone to start following them, even though noone had done so up till then.</p>\n\n<p>The main problem is that there is really no point in our history in which enough people could have \"forgotten\" the Torah so that a \"Fred\" is plausible.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/proof-torah-true/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A Rational Approach to the Torah’s Divine Origin</a> as quoted in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/36879/potential-issue-with-theory-on-divine-origins-of-judaism\">Potential issue with Theory on Divine Origins of Judaism?</a></p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3007/jewish/How-Do-We-Know-that-We-Heard-G-d-at-Sinai.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">How Do We Know That We Heard G‑d at Sinai?</a></p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/reayot/tohen-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ראיות מכריעות נגד ולהויזן</a> thanks to @WAF</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Hertz in his Chumash (written in the 1930's) deals with (the antisemite) Wellhausen's \"Documentory Theory\" invented in the late 19th century and shows how it falls apart through its own internal logic. He brings many details that were known even then and more has been discovered since then showing that such theories do not hold up.</p>\n\n<p>He also shows that every time new facts show the falsity of their claims, they simply change the claims and pretend that they had said that all along. See the end notes in the Hertz Chumash for details.</p>\n\n<p>For example when discussing the claims that everything was made up by King Josiah we have </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Excavations in Jerusalem in 1979–80 by Gabriel Barkay turned up two\n  amulets dating from the late seventh century BC(E)</p>\n  \n  <p>The silver scrolls date to the 7th century BCE and contain the\n  priestly blessing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course this is still well after Shmuel Hanavi but the point is that they keep trying to make these claims and keep failing.</p>\n\n<p>As far as Moshe existing, <strong>someone</strong> led the Jewish people and was the leader at the revelation.

Thus, it is more likely that the Torah is accurate in reporting what is known about him.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the claims get around this by pretending that there was no Yetzias Mitzrayim, no revelation at Sinai, no sojourn in the desert, and no conquest of Israel.

Additionally, Rabbi Hertz pointed out that there was no point in history <strong>except the Exodus</strong> in which everything in the Torah made sense. Placing the \"compilation of the Torah\" at any later date just caused conflicts and misunderstandings as well as contradicting the social and political milieu of whatever time was being claimed.</p>\n\n<p>Also since the Torah was sacred, it could not have been modified \"gradually\". Even if modifications were made, the Israelites of the time of the Shoftim were sufficiently scattered that they would not have accepted it. Note that they went to war with each other over the Sanhedrin of Binyamin insisting on taking care of the ruling of Pilegesh Begiv'ah independently, while the other tribes declared war to have the tribes as a whole judge the situation. Attempting to declare a previously unknown document \"sacred\" would have caused another civil war and prevented them from accepting Shmuel as Shofet and Shaul as Melech.</p>\n\n<p>Also note that part of Shmuel's \"claim\" would have been that the Torah written by Moshe had been kept as a sacred artifact in the mishkan and all of the tribes (and was still available to consult). If this was not true all of the tribes would have known that. Additionally, the Torah <strong>assumes</strong> that everyone lived within easy reach of the central mishkan and was able to go there regularly. This was no longer true in the time of Shmuel as we see from the story of his birth. A number of halachos in the Torah (such as the story of the daughters of Tzelaphchad) would have made no sense in the time of Shmuel.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>An answer to your general question can be found here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/27381/880\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/27381/880</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bible Scholars suggesting... not recorded as it was actually happening.

He starts bringing all kinds of gematrias about the <em>korbanot</em> that the <em>nesiim</em> bring. But the gematrias don't seem to have anything to do with the topic at hand in the Torah. Rashi normally doesn't depart much from the level of <em>p'shat</em>, so it is surprising to see him start making <em>drashot</em>--especially when they do not seem to be related at all.

Besides the failure of this reason to answer why Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan's explanation is chosen, it further raises the problem of why Rashi would say it on the second set of Korbanos, and not the first.</p>\n\n<p>He also asks a general question on both explanations that in Peshat, you understand that there are deeper levels, you just don't need to explain them. If so, why does this particular choice of Korbanos need a specific detail drush to explain them, whereas other things are just left as is to be explained at deeper levels not brought by Rashi.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore he explains that Rashi is looking to explain the following:</p>\n\n<p>The student asks himself a question: why is it that the Torah repeats the Korbanos 12 times in a row without change? And he answers to himself that each tribe had different intentions so it can't be said that they brought the same thing. However, that raises some problems:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How is it that 12 different intentions create the exact same sacrifices?</li>\n<li>How does the idea that they had different intentions fit with the idea that Bnei Yissachar gave the idea - if it was their idea, how does each one have different intentions?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is answered by the specific Drashos of Rabbi Moshe HaDarshan which show how one general intention can itself be divided into different specific intentions. Rashi is explaining the general intention. The Rebbe goes at length through each one comparing it to the alternatives in the Medrash and explaining how each choice best represents that idea.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15975&st=&pgnum=92&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Likkuet Sichos 18 page 83</a> the Rebbe revisits this question and further explains how all of these Drashos are interrelated.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Lubavitcher Rebbe on the Shoah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a controversial analogy attributed to the Lubavitcher Rebbe, in which the Shoah is looked upon as a surgical procedure, with God being likened to a surgeon who removes a limb in the best interests of his patient. I refer to it as \"controversial\" only because it has inspired argument and debate, and not as a value judgment. I would like to see it, however, in print.</p>\n\n<p>My research into this question has so far yielded the following results:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The initial publication, either by the Rebbe or quoting the Rebbe, was in an issue of <em>Mada' veEmunah</em> (Kfar Chabad: Makhon Lubavitch, 1980).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haika_Grossman\">MK Haika Grossman</a> (who took part in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bialystok_ghetto\">Białystok Ghetto</a> Uprising of 1943) was offended by the Rebbe's analogy and published a response on August 22nd the same year in a left-wing paper called <em>Al haMishmar</em>.</li>\n<li>The Rebbe saw Mrs Grossman's response to him and replied, both defending his analogy and attempting to explain it, on August 28th (16th Elul). His response has been published in Liqqutei Sikhot XXI (פרשת יתרו - הוספות), <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14944&st=&pgnum=404&hilite=\">pp397-400</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My sources for the foregoing include a very strongly-worded article by Prof. Yehuda Bauer (<a href=\"http://www.hiloni.org.il/maamarim/89-secular-awareness/180-wherewasgod\">here</a>), Prof. Bauer's subsequent <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.co.il/opinions/1.1414184\">article in Haaretz</a> (translated <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/god-as-surgeon-1.221983\">here</a>), and two responses to that article: one by <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.co.il/opinions/1.1416388\">R' Eliezer Shemtov</a> (translated <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/how-the-rebbe-understood-the-holocaust-1.222645\">here</a>) and the other published at <a href=\"http://www.chabad.info/php/articleold.php?set=29205&lang=he\">chabad.info</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Let me be very clear what I am asking for and what I am <strong>not</strong> asking for.</p>\n\n<p>I want to see the <em>original</em> article, which was published in <em>Mada' veEmunah</em>, to which Mrs Grossman responded in August of that year and to which the Rebbe subsequently made reference one week later.</p>\n\n<p>I am <strong>not</strong> asking for people's opinions on the validity or the cogency of this analogy, on the Lubavitcher Rebbe or on Prof. Yehuda Bauer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>B\"H, the photos of the original follow. It was published at Kfar Chabad in 1977 based upon two talks of the Rebbe. One from Simchat Torah 1970 and the other from 11 Nisan, 1973.</p>\n\n<p>This is the link to the Rebbe's sicha in Yiddish from the 11th of Nisan 1973. The relevant section begins in the 3rd paragraph on page folio 22 and goes to page 25.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HwBfo.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sichot Kodesh 5733 Vol 1</a></p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that the original talks by the Rebbe do not have the language about a surgeon removing limbs. And it begs the question where this idea came from in the edited booklet printed in Kefar Chabad in 1977.</p>\n\n<p>A little further investigation gives some insight into who may have written the booklet and how this idea got inserted into the discussion.</p>\n\n<p>The exact language appears in a private letter from the winter of 1954 (5714) that the Rebbe wrote to Rabbi Bentzion Shemtov, the father of Rabbi Avraham Shemtov. Rabbi Bentzion Shemtov was a Shaliach to England for many years and the letter was in answer to specific questions that Rabbi Shemtov had concerning the subject of Divine Providence and how to relate this to the Holocaust. This letter was reprinted in Igrot Kodesh, Vol. 8, pp. 180-182. It appears that the question from Rabbi Shemtov related somehow to people who had walked away from observance after the Holocaust.</p>\n\n<p>It is of interest to note that Rabbi Bentzion Shemtov went to Kefar Chabad to establish a printing and bookbinding cooperative for Russian-Jewish immigrants to Israel following Shavuot of 5735 (1975), which he spent with the Rebbe in Crown Heights in New York. On the 5th of Tammuz, only 28 days later, he was struck by a car and killed. He was buried in Jerusalem. The booklet, Emunah v'Mada, may have been something he was working on himself or was printed by the cooperative he established as a tribute for his second yartzeit.</p>\n\n<p>Copies of those pages appear below after those from the booklet 'Emunah v'Mada' for comparison.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting and relevant link giving some background on Rabbi Shemtov is found here.<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2593583/jewish/A-Tribute-to-Rabbi-Bentzion-Shemtov.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Bentzion Shemtov bio</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HwBfo.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HwBfo.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lhKrc.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lhKrc.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UHnR3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UHnR3.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/20ufU.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/20ufU.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6YTgO.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6YTgO.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Grstc.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Grstc.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yXiMZ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yXiMZ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jixoW.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jixoW.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bAGtF.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bAGtF.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KgrqJ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KgrqJ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1dWJu.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1dWJu.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This is the letter from Igrot Kodesh, Volume 8</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aEema.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/aEema.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z0oVt.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z0oVt.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hbT6m.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hbT6m.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

However Rav Moshe Shternbuch Shlit\"a in Teshuvos v' Hanhagos; basing himself upon other sources, doubts the assumption of the Ridvaz(which is actually based upon what others said).This is also the reason why going onto Har Habayis is considered an Issur Chamur which has been proclaimed assur by all great rabbonim of the previous generation. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This may not be completely unfounded:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14139&st=&pg=70\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talmud Yerushalmi Masechet Brachot daf 35.</a></p>\n\n<p>There, it says that anyone praying inside Jerusalem should face Har HaBayit.

Although Avot de-Rabbi Nathan is the first and longest of the \"minor tractates\", it probably does not belong in that collection chronologically, having more the character of a late midrash. In the form now extant it contains a mixture of Mishnah and Midrash, and may be technically designated as a homiletical exposition of the Mishnaic tractate Pirkei Avoth, having for its foundation an older recension (version) of that tractate. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If so, it is quite probable that much of the material there which also appears in the gemara was actually <strong>drawn</strong> from the gemara.

    "content": "# When a Bar Mitzvah boy says \"Y'chalelu et Shem Hashem\" instead of \"Y'Halelu\", should someone correct him?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Perhaps, the title of my question sounds amusing, but I see this happen in my shul a bit too often for me to laugh at it any more. Many of the Bar Mitzvah boys in my shul can barely read Hebrew. but, to make the boy and the family feel good, they ask him to return the Torah to the ark. The boy says, \"Yechalelu et shem Hashem\", meaning, \"Let us PROFANE G-d's name\" instead of the real word which is \"Yehalelu et shem Hashem\" - \"LET US PRAISE G-d's name.\"</p>\n\n<p>Seems to me that the mispronunciation is serious as it is not just incorrect, but makes a real mockery (even unintentional) of what the phrase should be. But, no one says anything because no one wants to embarass the boy or the family by correcting him. Should we let it go, or correct him?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><strong>Consult the shul's rabbi for practical advice.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The rabbi in my synagogue is very particular that the reading of the Torah is done precisely, because we must ensure that the mesorah gets passed down perfectly. The implicaion <em>may</em> be that mistakes in other parts of the service (like returning the scroll to the ark) need not be corrected if this would embarrass the boy, perhaps violating a Biblical prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>It says in Shir Hashirim (2:4) ודגלו עלי אהבה. The Shir Hashirim Rabbah says that this means that even omission or mistakes are treated by God with love. For example, if someone reads ואהבת את ה' אלקיך (you shall love God) as ואיבת (you shall enstrange), God still accepts this serious error with love.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, this is midrash, not halachah, so you should still CYLOR. But there may be room to be lenient and leave the boy alone.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The halacha is clear: When the reading changes the meaning of the verse you must go back and read it again. If not, then the kehilla is not yotzei Krias haTorah. However this is seemingly only in regards to Krias haTorah and other readings of a oblgitory nature ie. Krias Shema.</p>\n\n<p>I understand from your question that this occurred while taking the Torah out of the Aron, thus I wouldn't be so strict about it, especially if its coming from ignorance. However, we generally are strict not to read things in a way which would sound like profaning G-d's name. For example, the minhag during Birchas Krias Shema is to pause during \"umakdishim umamlichim <em>pause</em> es shem ha-el hamelech...\". This is in order to keep the \"mem\" at the end of \"umamlichim\" from getting shmushed into the \"es\" of \"es shem\", thus saying \"mes\".</p>\n\n\n",

In fact, the Pasuk (Shoftim 5:1) records that Devora the prophetess sang a song of praise to Hashem together with Barak the son of Avinoam.</p>\n<p>The Gemara (Megila 23a) states that women are forbidden to receive an Aliyah to the Torah because of Kavod Hatzibbur (and in the days of Chazal the one who got an aliya would <em>lein</em> the Parsha). Since it does not mention Kol Isha as the reason to forbid women’s Aliyot</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>it is possible to argue that the Kol Isha restriction does not apply when a woman recites sacred texts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Mosheh Lichtenstein argues that the ruling of the Divrei Cheifetz and Seridei Eish permits listening to a woman singing at official Tzahal events that are formal and serious. He first bolsters the opinion of the Divrei Cheifetz and the Seridei Eish by demonstrating that Rambam, Rashba and Ra’avyah agree that the Kol Ishah prohibition is not absolute but rather emerges from concern lest it lead to sin. Thus, in a context that concern for sin is not relevant, the Kol Ishah does not apply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It may be possible to extend R' Lichtenstein's reasoning to other formal and serious events, such as the one in the question, especially given that recitations of Tanach should not lead to concern for sin.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to Rashi women may read the megillah for men.  (Source TBA)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This appears to be a clear parallel.  Apparently other Rishonim in Masechet Megillah also say that <em>leining</em> isn't <em>kol isha,</em> but I haven't checked.</p>\n<p><strong>3)</strong> Kavod haTzibbur is complicated. Some say it's subjective, and the Tzibbur can be mochel \\ If they don't mind it's not an issue; Others say it's objective, and it is what the seforim\\poskim say it is, so if the poksim say this is bad, then it is, even if the Tzibbur doesn't care.</p>\n<p><strong>4)</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Teshuvot Igrot Moshe O.C.1:26) and Rav Ovadia Yosef (Taharat Habayit 2:270) rule (based on the Mishna Berura 75:17) that in case of need, one may rely on the ruling that the prohibition of Kol Isha does not apply to girls who are not Niddot. Rav Moshe writes (in 1947) that one may assume that there is no question with girls below the age of eleven.

Thus, when spoken as a single phrase, the translation is similar to the English original \"Holy Day\" which we now use as \"holiday\". The Yiddish \"Yumtuf\" or \"Yuntif\" shows that it is used a a single meaning. Thus \"Good Yuntif\" would not be considered a redundancy.

I am especially looking for such commentaries from Rishonim to Acharonim (So far I know there is <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=14&perek=37&mefaresh=radak\" rel=\"nofollow\">Radak on Yechezkiel 37:24</a>)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>First of all, the Gemara (Sanhedrin 98b) has an extensive discussion about this; I don't know if you'll call that midrash:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דבי רבי שילא אמרי שילה שמו שנאמר עד כי יבא שילה דבי רבי ינאי אמרי ינון שמו שנאמר יהי שמו לעולם לפני שמש ינון שמו דבי רבי חנינה אמר חנינה שמו שנאמר אשר לא אתן לכם חנינה ויש אומרים מנחם בן חזקיה שמו שנאמר כי רחק ממני מנחם משיב נפשי ורבנן אמרי חיוורא דבי רבי שמו שנאמר אכן חליינו הוא נשא ומכאובינו סבלם ואנחנו חשבנוהו נגוע מוכה אלהים ומעונה</p>\n  \n  <p>What is his [the Messiah's] name? — The School of R. Shila said: His name is Shiloh, for it is written, until Shiloh come. The School of R. Yannai said: His name is Yinnon, for it is written, His name shall endure for ever: e'er the sun was, his name is Yinnon. The School of R. Haninah maintained: His name is Haninah, as it is written, Where I will\n  not give you Haninah. Others say: His name is Menahem the son of Hezekiah,for it is written, Because Menahem [‘the comforter’], that would relieve my soul, is far. The Rabbis said: His name is ‘the leper scholar,’ as it is written, Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him a leper, smitten of God, and afflicted. (<a href=\"http://halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Sanhedrin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are a few more opinions in the Midrash Eicha (1:81)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' אבא בר כהנא אומר ה' שמו שנאמר (ירמיה כג, ו) 'וזה שמו אשר יקראו ה' צדקינו', ר' אבא זכי נהורא אמר נהורא שמו שנאמר (דניאל ב, כב) 'ונהורא עמו שרא', ריב\"ל אמר צמח שמו שנאמר (זכריה ו, יב) 'הנה איש צמח שמו ומתחתיו יצמח</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Abba bar Kahana says, 'HASHEM shemo', as it says, \"and this is his name by which he will be called, Hashem, our just\". R. Abba Zaki Zehora says that 'Nehora' (light) will be his name, as it says \"Nehora will free his nation\". R. Yehoshua ben Levi says \"tzemach\" (sprouting) will be his name, as is says, \"behold, a man named Tzemach - from beneath him it will sprout\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Abarbanel wrote a book on matters pertaining to Mashiach, called Yeshuas Meshicho. He discusses the question of Mashiach's name (2:1). He explains there that these Sages aren't actually arguing as to what will be Mashiach's proper name, but are all giving expression to what they believe will be essential to his character and role as the Mashiach - he will bring peace (Shiloh), be exalted (Yinonn), etc. The Maharal (Netzach Yisrael ch. 41) explains this discussion in the same manner. </p>\n\n\n",

But, I think, though I'm no Posek, if a Rav were pushed, he'd rule that if the bee really does pose a threat, one can kill it.

Being the \"son of Hagar the Egyptian\", Ishmael was a servant making fun of his master, being thus punishable by death or lashing.

I do not think Rabbi Akiba is claiming that Ishmael <em>actually</em> did those grievous sins at his half-brother's weaning celebration. Rather, he is articulating aspects of Ishmael's personality. He was מְצַחֵק, laughing. A person laughs at something that they find silly or aren't taking seriously. Rabbi Akiba is explaining that Ishmael made light of the God of Abraham, or that he made light of the severity of sexual deviance, or that he made light of human life. Those three attitudes are, after all the root cause of the three severe sins that are mentioned. Rabbi Simeon son of Elazar/Yohai objects to this, claiming that Abraham would not have made such an error in parenting that would leave his child ingrained with any of these ideals, and provides his alternative understanding.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>@Matt in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/30481/why-is-the-torah-so-misleading-without-the-oral-law/38868#38868\">Why is the torah so misleading without the oral law</a> points to </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>See Joseph Roth-Rotem, \"The Exposition of the Banishment of Ishma'el Story\" (Genesis 21:9-21), Beit Mikra: Journal for the Study of the Bible and Its World vol. 43 (1998), pp. 113-125 and M Moreshet, \"צחק — שחק; יצחק — ישחק\", Beit Mikra: Journal for the Study of the Bible and Its World vol. 13 (1978), pp. 127-130</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We also see the the term means \"sexual play\" in Toldos 27:8 \nוהנה יצחק מצחק \nRashi says משמש מטתו</p>\n\n<p>Also note that Hashem had already commanded that <strong>only</strong> Yitzchak was to be considered an heir. This required Avraham to \"banish\" Yishmael legally using the formal methods of the time. Note that he gave them a certain amount of food and water and they were expected to go to a location well within their reach. It was only because Hagar became \"lost\" that the trouble arose. See <a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/parsha.60/04vayera.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Birth of Yitzchak and the Banishment of Hagar and Yishmael (Bereishit 21:1-21) By Rav Elchanan Samet</a> as an example. We see from the medrashim and other sources, that Avraham actually kept in touch with Yishmael. Indeed, that is why we see the medrash state that Yishmael was one of the two \"youths\" who accompanied Avraham and Yitzchak to the Akeidah.</p>\n\n<p>We also see from the way Bnei Keturah are treated that he had to formally \"disinherit\" them in a way similar to the way he \"banished\" Yishmael. Otherwise they would have been considered heirs like Yitzchak. Besides the reference to the Hertz chumash, the link to the Torah on the Web site also references the laws of inheritence at that time. These laws would also have applied to the children of Keturah. This would seem to apply whether Keturah was Hagar or some other woman. In either case, his action in taking her would have made their children heirs, unless he explicitly \"disinherited\" them before his death.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thus, both from the legal considerations and in order to prevent the teenage Yishmael from having an influence on his younger brother he had to be sent away.</strong></p>\n\n<p>An example for a source for this can be seen in the Hertz Chumash</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Sarah demanded that Avraham banish (geresh) Hagar and Ishmael, while Avraham sent (shalach) them away because Sarah saw Ishmael making sport of Isaac (laughing at the idea that Isaac would inherit Avraham) for he claimed a double portion as Avraham's first born son. </p>\n\n<p>The Midrash relates that they would go out into the field, argue over the inheritance and Ishmael would take his bow and arrows and shoot them at Isaac claiming to be <em>pretending</em> to shoot at him but actually intending on slaying Isaac!</p>\n\n<p>(Here, it seems as if Ishmael is amusing himself at the expense of Isaac!)</p>\n\n<p>Another Midrash relates that Ishmael slandered Sarah [as having committed adultry with Abimelech] saying Isaac was conceived through Abimelech and not Avraham. This slander he heard from the scoffers of the generation.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Hirsch comments on 21.6 Va-tomer Sara, tsehok asa li Elokim…” (21:6).</p>\n\n<p>This verse is translated by Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as follows:</p>\n\n<p>“And Sarah said: God hath made me into a laughing-stock, all that hear will laugh at me.”</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud Sanhedrin 89b relates:</p>\n\n<p>R. Levi said [in explanation of 'after these words' B'rashith - Genesis 22.1]; After Ishmael's words to Isaac. Ishmael said to Isaac: 'I am more virtuous than thee in good deeds, for thou wast circumcised at eight days, [and so couldst not prevent it], but I at thirteen years'. 'On account of one limb wouldst thou incense me!' he replied: 'Were the Holy One, blessed be He, to say unto me, Sacrifice thyself before Me, I would obey', Straightway, G-d did tempt Abraham.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that a strong argument can be made for Ishmael mocking the halacha of circumcision on the eighth day from birth; that is, he mocked the covenant of circumcision (Rashi's illicitness) from which he was ultimately destined to be excluded from, by the prophetic words of Sarah!</p>\n\n<p>This mockery of the covenant of circumcision seems to me a likely scenario given that HaShem's sense of justice is <em>middah keneged middah</em> (measure for measure), as Sarah spoke prophetically, \"cast out this bondwoman, for the son of this bondwoman shall not inherit with my son, with Isaac [with laughter]!\"</p>\n\n\n",

If you have reached the level of one who is ראוי להוראה then you can pasken. If not, you can't. This is not a black and white issue. You may be qualified to pasken shailos of berachos but not Shabbos or Niddah.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen people who received semicha who are less qualified than those who did not and seen many people who think they can pasken for themselves who are woefully inadequate both in scholarship and יראת שמים. </p>\n\n<p>In my opinion the only way to know if you have reached the level of ראוי להוראה is by getting experience and שימוש by a competent halachic authority to the point that the authority has the appropriate confidence in you. Indeed, that is what <em>semicha</em> is supposed to connote - that the rabbinical authority issuing the semicha recognizes and gives permission for the receiver of the semicha to issue rulings. (<em>Yoreh Deah 242,14 Rema)</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>According to the Alter Rebbe of Lubavitch, this the Machlokes between the Rambam and others (primarily the Rosh). He explains this in <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/ka5/13/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kuntres Achron</a> to Hichlchos Talmud Torah.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Rambam, learning a Halacha from sefer for yourself, even if the sefer doesn't bring the reasoning for the din, is OK. This is why the Rambam wrote the Mishna Torah that way. Others, who were very opposed to the Rambam's failure to include sources and warn people to not pasken from their understanding of it held that this is not at all appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>It depends on the two/three ways that Rashi brings to understand המורין הלכה מתוך משנתם הם מבלי עולם in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=22&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sota 22a</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, according to the Rambam the answer would be unambiguously yes - if you know enough of the Sugiya to exclude clearly rejected opinions (as in opinions that were negated by the Talmud) and the matter is addressed directly in what you learned. As for the Rosh, you have to understand the underlying reasons for the Halacha first, and of course the matter has to be directly addressed.</p>\n\n<p>The question asked for sources, which are in the footnotes at the link.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>from hearos blog: <a href=\"http://hearos.blogspot.co.il/2011/12/bechoros-31a-paskening-for-yourself.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hearos.blogspot.co.il/2011/12/bechoros-31a-paskening-for-yourself.html</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bechoros 31a - Paskening For Yourself The Braisa says that one is not\n  allowed to pasken on their own Bechor that it has a mum to allow\n  himself to eat it. The gemara explains that we are speaking about a\n  kohein who was given a bechor and qualifies as a יחיד מומחה who can\n  normally pasken by himself, but we don't allow him to pasken on his\n  own animal because we are afraid that he will be mo'reh heter for\n  personal benefit. Tosafos asks that based on this we should never\n  permit anyone to pasken for themselves on any question of issur\n  v'heter. Furthermore, the gemara in eiruvin says in that a talmid\n  chacham can pasken for himself - how does this fit with our gemara?\n  The Rash in Negaim (cited by Gilyon HaShas) asks Tosafos question and\n  says that it is dependent on whether it is אתחזק איסורא. When the item\n  has a status of being forbidden and relies on the p'sak of the chacham\n  to permit it, one cannot permit their own. But, when there is no\n  default status of issur, one may pasken on their own. The Binas Adam\n  (sha'ar issur v'heter 2) elaborates about this Rash and explains that\n  when a question of issur v'heter would arise on the kashrus of an\n  animal in the shechita process, that would qualify as a chezkas issur\n  where one cannot pasken on their own. But, when it comes to checking\n  the shechita knife on which there is no chezkas issur, one can check\n  their own. It should follow from this that if the shechita knife would\n  get a p'gam in it causing it to be invalid for shechita, the shochet\n  shouldn't be able to check his own knife. However, the Lechem Chamudos\n  (cited by binas adam) explains that anything which is one's control to\n  fix, he is believed on even if it is אתחזק איסורא. Since the schochet\n  can fix his knife by sharpening and removing the nicks, he is believed\n  to say that it has been fixed. The Binas Adam adds that we learn from\n  our gemara that in a case which is אתחזק איסורא and not in one's own\n  control to fix, even a talmid chacham isn't believed. This is clear\n  from the case of Bechor where a יחיד מומחה isn't believed to pasken on\n  his own. Following this approach, the Chochmas Adam (109:6) paskens\n  that although a husband may pasken on the bedika cloth of his wife\n  (and she may pasken on her own), if a question develops about\n  chatzitza while immersing in a mikva, the husband cannot pasken. The\n  rationale for the distinction is that he can only pasken when it is\n  not אתחזק איסורא. Once she is established as a Nida and the question\n  is about her becoming tahora, it is אתחזק איסורא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

His plan was to give it to his son. He saw that he had servants who might be jealous and want what's in the container.After realizing that the son will get it they might plan to kill him so they would be next in line.</p>\n\n<p>The doctor decided to place poison on the opening of the container .He then called his servants and asked them to be loyal and accept the container.The servants asked to examine the container(to taste it),before they even attempted to taste it they felt near death pains from the contents.They thought to themselves let the son inherit this and he would die and they ,the servants will inherit the doctors wealth.

The simplest, though, not always most \"satisfactory\" answer is that midrashim are not always to be taken literally as a discription of events that actually occurred, but rather for the moral lessons they teach us.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, even though there is a midrash that indicates that God \"forced\" us to accept the Torah, it is actually the other midrash that provides support to this midrash. That is. obviously, God knows everyone's intentions in advance. So in asking the other nations, God knew that they would refuse and only Israel would accept it lovingly. Thus. God had chosen Israel even prior to asking the other nations. The other nations refusal is merely further proof that Israel on its own had no qualms about entering the agreement.</p>\n\n<p>What about the 2nd midrash that Israel was \"forced\" to accept it? I think this is natural human behavior. Either at the last minute, B'nai Israel had doubts, or they were lax in making a final commitment - my interpretation of possibilities. Or, even when you know that what you should do is the right thing, you simply don't act on it until someoen in charge says, \"Do it now\". Similar to how kids react. They may not want a messy room, themselves, but util Mommy says, \"You better do it, or else,\" they won't do it.</p>\n\n\n",

These are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>He must be Jewish -- Deut. 17:15 prohibits us setting a non-Jew as a king over us.  See also Gen. 49:10 (\"The scepter shall not depart from Judah....\").</li>\n<li>He must be descended from David and Solomon -- I Chron. 17:11-12, 22:9-10; Ps. 89:29-38; Jer. 33.17; 2 Sam. 7:12-16.</li>\n<li>That line will be through the father since the Torah teaches that families registered their ancestry by their \"fathers' household.\" Num. 1:18.</li>\n<li>Rambam (Maimonedes) adds that the Messiah will resolve the numerous rabbinic disputes on Jewish law that came up over the past 2000 years or so after the Roman exile.  Mishna Torah, Hilchos Melachim 11:4.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But more important is the fact that the Messiah must bring about the Messianic Era which would include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>World-wide belief in the G-d of Abraham -- Isa. 11:9, 40:5; Zeph. 3:9.</li>\n<li>World-wide peace -- Isa. 2:4, 11:6; Micah 4:3.</li>\n<li>Relocation of all Jews to Israel, gathered from the four corners of the earth -- Deut. 30:3-4; Isa. 11:12, 27:12-13.</li>\n<li>The Temple will be rebuilt -- Micah 4:1.  And</li>\n<li>Resurrection of the Dead (and resettlement into Israel) -- Isa. 26:19.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Rambam points out that some of these events, and other events must happen within the Messiah's lifetime.  According to Rambam the Messiah in his lifetime must a) cause all Jews to become observant; b) repair issues that divide us on halachic questions; c) fight the wars of Israel, d) rebuild the Temple, and e) gather in the exiles.  Hilchos Melachim 11:4.  If the Messiah fulfilled some miracles but not all, before dying, we cannot regard him to be the Messiah, and instead view him as a test or our own will.  Hilchos Melachim 11:5 (ואם לא  הצליח עד כה או נהרג, בידוע שאינו זה שהבטיחה עליו תודה \n… ולא העמידו הקדוש\nברוך הוא אלא לנסות בו רבים) (\"But if he did not succeed in all\nthis or was killed, he is\ndefinitely not the Moshiach\npromised in the Torah... and\nG-d only appointed him in\norder to test the masses....\")\nThere are certainly other attributes and signs that might indicate that one is or is not the Messiah, but without bringing about the Messianic Age, it doesn't matter if he performed miracles, rode a Donkey into the Old City, or suffered in any kind of manner for any length of time.  The righteous among us produce miracles daily, and many of them suffer daily for the sins of other Jews who deserve puninshment in this world for certain sins, but who might lose faith if he was punished as he deserved.  See Talmud Bavli, Brachos 5a. And, lets be honest, for the right fee, anyone can ride a donkey into the Old City.  The bottom line we expect from the Messiah is that he deliver the Messianic Era; anything less won't work.</p>\n\n\n",

The gemara Eruvin 53b brings a question of Rebbe, whether the word \"extend\" in Hebrew <em>mabrin</em> should be spelled מאברין or מעברין? In other words, Rebbe was doubtful about the correct version. The Gemara concludes that some teachers recited the mishna one way for Rebbe and some teachers recited the other way.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 3</strong>. The Mishnah was divided into tractates before the time of Rebbe. Gemara Horayos 13b says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Meir said to Rabbi Natan: Let us ask [R' Shimon ben Gamliel] to expound [tractate]  Uktzin, with which he is unfamiliar...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Sherira says that Rebbe added his commentary in some places, and in some exceptional cases a few Mishnayos were formulated in the days of Rebbe,although the bulk of them have been already formulated by the Men of Great Assembly. The tractate Eduyos was established on the day R' Elazar ben Azaria was inaugurated. Few mishnayos came down to Rebbe in a less finished form, which he rearranged and changed the wording. Actually, some mishnayos, such as Makkos 3:15, Avos 2:2, and Avoda Zara 2:6 incorporate decisions by Rebbe'ssons and a grandson.</p>\n<p>Based on these ideas let us review the OP's example. The Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.1.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 1:3</a> speaks about the 6 months on which messengers were sent by Sanhedrin to diaspora regarding declaration of the new month. These are: Nissan, Av, Elul, Tishrei, Kislev, Adar and when there was Temple also Iyar (due to festivals that fall in these months). The mishnah does not include the opinion of Rebbe quoted in the gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.19b.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 19b</a>, which futher specifies that in the leap year the messangers also go out in the 2nd Adar. The reason, why this opinion was not included in the mishnah, is that Rebbe received the mishna from his teachers in this form and considered its formulation complete, according to R' Sherira. Rebbe's question was an additional specification, which was clarified in his days. It was included in gemara, but it was too specific to be included in the text of the mishnah.</p>\n\n\n",

Sinai. \"said to them\" can't mean the words of the 10 commandments, because the commandments are introduced by \"G-d said all these things..\".

All Moshe says is a fact; He didn't say, \"I told them not to do it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Another possibile explanation is when Moshe says in verse 15, Moshe says, \"prepare yourself for the 3rd day.\" Although he does not state HOW to prepare, it's possible that within this preparation Moshe may have explained the \"border\" rules, even though the Torah does not explicitly say so.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, at the end, the border did not matter, because everyone was so scared that they backed away from Mt.

If the deceased were not required to undergo such judgment (e.g. he was a complete tzadik) Kaddish would not be necessary, but is nevertheless said even for a child once he reached the age of understanding what a sin is. (<em>Mourning in Halacha</em> 39:29-30) based on <em>Sdei Chemed</em> (Aveilus 151), <em>Pischei Teshuvah</em> (376:3),.</p>\n\n<p>For an unborn child, the child is a pure tzaddik who never experienced any sin and Kaddish is not said.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Kaddish is part of the laws of mourning, which weren't instituted for the loss of an unborn child. (In fact, if a baby was born with severe medical problems and left this world soon after entering it, most rabbis would advise against <em>shiva</em>, <em>kaddish</em>, and the remaining mourning rituals.)</p>\n\n<p>It's a sad and difficult situation, especially without the usual routines and recognitions of mourning. I suspect that when these laws were instituted, the state of women's health was such that they couldn't afford to go through full mourning for a lost pregnancy. (The Talmud has stories of people discussing plans for their newborns, with the caveat \"assuming this one makes it.\") Hopefully you find a good support network, a competent rabbi included, to be there for you. May God give you strength.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Kaddish is usually said for someone for whom there is an obligation to sit shiva. We see this in the original source for saying Kaddish for the dead, The Ohr Zarua (II:50), who quotes the Medrash: \"Rabbi Akiva saw a strange and afflicted man who told him that he has been dead for many years and because he was particularly sinful in his lifetime he was judged harshly. When Rabbi Akiva taught the man's son to say Kaddish the man was spared the punishments”.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, we see that origin of the practice to recite Kaddish was said within the context of the chiyuv aveilus. (But being that it is not obligatory law within the laws of mourning, it can be recited by others as well)</p>\n\n<p>For an unborn child or a child that died within 30 days old, there is no requirement to sit shiva, they under the halachic classification of a \"nephel\" ie. a non viable baby, meaning the baby was not considered alive in the utmost halachic sense (although its death does require a full jewish burial, see Avoda Zara 42a,REMA (OC 526:10, HAGAHOS MAIMONIYOS (Hilchos Milah 1:10) and the BI'UR HA'GRA (OC 526, and MAGEN AVRAHAM (ibid) and CHAZON ISH (OC 133:2) as well for a fuller discussion of the requirment to bury a nefel).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore Kaddish is not said for them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/assia/pagim-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yitzchak Zilberstein</a> of Ramat Elchanan says that one may recite Kaddish and other aspects of mourning for a baby of 30 days and beyond. But not less. Perhaps one could extrapolate from that, that a baby less than 30 days, no Kaddish is recited:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צדוק הדין וקדיש נוהגים לומר אפילו בתינוק בן שלושים יום ומעלה ולא\n  בפחות. (גשר החיים י\"ב י\"א) ומנהג ירושלים שאם יש מנין על יד הקבר אומרים\n  שם קדיש על תינוק בן שלושים ומעלה, וגם בבית האבל אומרים קדיש ומתפללים\n  (ויש נוהגים אפילו בלמוד משניות) הגם שקטן ודאי נקי מחטא, ומה מקום\n  להתפלל עליו? אפשר לומר, מי יודע איזה בעל נשמה היה הקטן (ואולי חטא\n  בגלגול קודם). גם עושים מנין בבית האבל בשביל האבל שיוכל להתפלל בציבור.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However what if the person did it in an abnormal manner (Shinui) or better yet if it's yom tov sheini. So in those two cases it's a shvus dshvus, and it's for tza'ar because lack of nicotine in a smoker causes many unpleasant side affects such as light headedness and nausea. Would the manner of using the electronic as listed above be permitted under those circumstances?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette\" rel=\"nofollow\">Electronic cigarette</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An electronic cigarette (e-cig or e-cigarette), personal vaporizer (PV) or electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) is a battery-powered device which simulates tobacco smoking by producing a vapor that resembles smoke. It generally uses a heating element known as an atomizer, that vaporizes a liquid solution. Solutions usually contain a mixture of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, nicotine, and flavorings,[1] while others release a flavored vapor without nicotine.[2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a matter of logic, the heating element can be considered to be like a fire that is \"lit\". This is not only a matter of completing a circuit, but of causing something to heat up. While you might say that \"cooking\" the nicotine out of is sufficiently \"like\" ochel nefesh to be mutar, you are still creating a new \"fire\". Since you are producing heat, this is not like the other types of electricity uses that some people say are mutar on Yom Tov (or Shabbos) because they do not turn on a light or produce heat.</p>\n\n<p>This would be analogous to turning on the stove from a completely off position and not just raising or lowering the flame.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Shalom u'vracha!

Although their psak was specific to electric switches, the same can be applied to battery-powered electronic devices because the battery \"contains\" the power and merely transfers it to the parts of the device. Another reason for nolad to be applicable, is that it must be visible to the eye; like an egg coming out of a chicken or sparks coming out between two rocks when bringing them together(microscopic vision doesn't count in Talmudic law). </p>\n\n<p>However, only ochel nefesh was permitted on yom tov and the rule is that for a non-ochel nefesh melacha to be done on yom tov is that it must be enjoyable to the general population on a similar level, which doesn't apply to smoking(cigarettes or e-cigs); rendering smoking a forbidden act on yom tov. So too, was the psak of Rav Elyashiv ztz\"l. </p>\n\n<p>It is my opinion that electricity is permitted on yom tov when used for ochel nefesh(like the poskim listed above and my personal reasoning), even though this is not my practice. Even though the tzibbur is machmir, it is due to the doubt of the nature of electricity and not a gezera; rendering it permitted due to it being accepted as a matter of doubt and minhag ta'ut. </p>\n\n<p><em>For detailed sources, please comment.

Two ideas - 1) On Shabbat God rested from all work, so we \"imitate\" God. There is a concept of COMPLETE rest on Shabbat, no such concept (at least as mentioned in the Torah) of resting is stated for Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>2) Yom Tov has a concept of \"simcha\" - joy, which Shabbat doesn't. An integral part of \"simcha\" as defined in the Talmud and other sources is food and drink. Yes, it is a mitzvah to eat on Shabbat as well, but there's a different derivation for that. In either case, to accomplish the simcha with food, it has to be prepared. The Talmud in various locations, discusses the concern from fresh food specifically on Yom Tov, and allows leniencies on preparing food on Yom Tov itself in certain cases even if, technically, the food could have been prepared before Yom Tov. That's how important \"simcha\" and food are considered on Yom Tov. You don't see these leniencies for Shabbat.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why isn't Shavuot celebrated on a Sunday as the Torah says?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why is Shavuot celebrated today [Wednesday] instead of on the \"day after the sabbath\" as the Torah says (Lev. 23:15,16)? </p>\n\n<p>Passover is a movable holiday, but according to Leviticus 23, both the Feast of First Fruits [Lev. 23:10,11] and Shavuot move with it. The Feast of First Fruits (Wave of Sheaf Offering) takes place on the first 'morrow after the Sabbath' after the Passover. And then, from that very day, seven Sabbaths are counted and \"even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall ye number fifty days.\" That is when Shavuot is to be celebrated. And we all know that the 'morrow after the Sabbath' is always a Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>So, why isn't Shavuot celebrated on a Sunday?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Good question!</p>\n<p>This was discussed ~2,000 years ago in the Talmud in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l5206.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tractate Menachot folios 65b–66a</a>.</p>\n<p>Multiple reasons are given—with proofs from the Bible—as to why the \"morrow after the Sabbath\" refers to the 2nd day of Pesach and not to [the following] Sunday.</p>\n<p>Here's the original (you can read it in English <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/menachos/points/mn-ps-065.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>איתותב חגא דשבועיא דלא למספד שהיו בייתוסין אומרים עצרת אחר השבת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The opening line—Do we start counting from Sunday, or from the 2nd day of Pesach—followed by a discussion with some (self-identified) Beitusim.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ניטפל להם רבן יוחנן בן זכאי ואמר להם שוטים מנין לכם ולא היה אדם אחד שהיה משיבו חוץ מזקן אחד שהיה מפטפט כנגדו ואמר משה רבינו אוהב ישראל היה ויודע שעצרת יום אחד הוא עמד ותקנה אחר שבת כדי שיהו ישראל מתענגין שני ימים קרא עליו מקרא זה (דברים א) אחד עשר יום מחורב דרך הר שעיר (דף סה,ב)  ואם משה רבינו אוהב ישראל היה למה איחרן במדבר ארבעים שנה אמר לו רבי בכך אתה פוטרני?‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yochanan then refutes them, and brings the first proof that we start counting from the 2nd day of Pesach:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר לו שוטה ולא תהא תורה שלמה שלנו כשיחה בטילה שלכם כתוב אחד אומר (ויקרא כג) תספרו חמשים יום וכתוב אחד אומר (ויקרא כג) שבע שבתות תמימות תהיינה הא כיצד כאן ביום טוב שחל להיות בשבת כאן ביו\"ט שחל להיות באמצע שבת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer brings a different proof:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי אליעזר אומר אינו צריך הרי הוא אומר (דברים טז) תספר לך ספירה תלויה בבית דין שהם יודעים לחדש ממחרת השבת מחרת י\"ט יצאת שבת בראשית שספירתה בכל אדם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua brings another proof:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי יהושע אומר אמרה תורה מנה ימים וקדש חדש מנה ימים וקדש עצרת מה חדש סמוך לביאתו ניכר אף עצרת סמוך לביאתו ניכרת וא\"ת עצרת לעולם אחר השבת היאך תהא ניכרת משלפניה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yishmael brings another proof:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי ישמעאל אומר אמרה תורה הבא עומר בפסח ושתי הלחם בעצרת מה להלן רגל ותחלת רגל אף כאן רגל ותחלת רגל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira also brings a proof:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי יהודה בן בתירא אומר נאמר שבת למעלה ונאמר שבת למטה מה להלן רגל ותחלת רגל סמוך לה אף כאן רגל ותחלת רגל סמוך לה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yosi bar Yehuda brings a proof based on a Beraita:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ת\"ר (ויקרא כג) וספרתם לכם שתהא ספירה לכל אחד ואחד (ויקרא כג) ממחרת השבת ממחרת יו\"ט או אינו אלא למחרת שבת בראשית רבי יוסי בר יהודה אומר הרי הוא אומר (ויקרא כג) תספרו חמשים יום כל ספירות שאתה סופר לא יהו אלא חמשים יום ואם תאמר ממחרת שבת בראשית פעמים שאתה מוצא חמשים ואחד ופעמים שאתה מוצא חמשים ושנים חמשים ושלשה חמשים וארבעה חמשים וחמשה חמשים וששה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira continues with yet another proof:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר\"י בן בתירא אומר אינו צריך (דף סו,א)  הרי הוא אומר תספור לך ספירה תלויה בבית דין יצתה שבת בראשית שספירתה בכל אדם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yosi has another proof:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי יוסי אומר ממחרת השבת ממחרת יום טוב אתה אומר ממחרת יו\"ט או אינו אלא ממחרת שבת בראשית אמרת וכי נאמר ממחרת השבת שבתוך הפסח והלא לא נאמר אלא ממחרת השבת דכל השנה כולה מלאה שבתות צא ובדוק איזו שבת ועוד נאמרה שבת למטה ונאמרה שבת למעלה מה להלן רגל ותחילת רגל אף כאן רגל ותחילת רגל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar brings a longer proof:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי שמעון בן אלעזר אומר כתוב אחד אומר (דברים טז) ששת ימים תאכל מצות וכתוב אחד אומר (שמות יב) שבעת ימים מצות תאכלו הא כיצד מצה שאי אתה יכול לאוכלה שבעה מן החדש אתה יכול לאוכלה ששה מן החדש (ויקרא כג) מיום הביאכם תספרו יכול יקצור ויביא ואימתי שירצה יספור תלמוד לומר (דברים יז) מהחל חרמש בקמה תחל לספור אי מהחל חרמש תחל לספור יכול יקצור ויספור ואימתי שירצה יביא ת\"ל מיום

הא כיצד קצירה וספירה בלילה והבאה ביום</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rava summarizes that some of the above proofs could be refuted, while the others can’t be refuted, and he explains why.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבא כולהו אית להו פירכא בר מתרתי תנאי בתראי בין במתניתא קמייתא בין במתניתא בתרייתא דלית להו פירכא אי מדרבן יוחנן בן זכאי דלמא כדאביי דאמר אביי מצוה למימני יומי ומצוה

יהודה בן בתירא ממאי דביו\"ט ראשון קאי דלמא ביו\"ט אחרון קאי ר' יוסי נמי חזי ליה פירכא והיינו דקאמר ועוד.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you see, this is discussed at length with each proof being analyzed to see if it can be refuted. The Talmud concludes that we start counting on from the second day of Pesach, and that is how it is codified by all Poskim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This was the opinion of the Boethusians in the time of the second temple. This reading of the verse was rejected as it is not the interpretation of the Sages of the Mishna. The basis of the dispute is the word sabbbath - does this mean the sabbath ie. the 7th day of the week, or does it mean \"week\", the Boethusian interpretation would make no sense in this case here, because the verse does nor specify which of the 52 Sabbaths is meant (Rashi-Sifra). The Pharisees argued that Shavuot is to be counted from the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which they designated a “Sabbath.” According to the Pharisees, “morrow of the Sabbath” means the “morrow of the 1st day of Unleavened Bread.” The ancient Pharisees and their modern day successor the Orthodox rabbis begin the 50-day count to Shavuot on the second day of Unleavened Bread, which is always the 16th day of the First Hebrew Month. As a result, the Pharisee Shavuot always fell out in ancient times from the 5th to the 7th day of the Third Hebrew Month (Sivan).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>R. Yehudah Halevi posits in his Kuzari (<a href=\"https://library.alhatorah.org/?r1=Kuzari_3:41\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:41</a>) that the karaim were right in their understanding of ׳מִמָּחֳרָת הַשַּׁבָּת׳, but that the day is arbitrary from a biblical standpoint, with Sunday spoken of to easily demonstrate the countdown, as the  trigger for counting is solely the harvest event of ׳מֵהָחֵל חֶרְמֵשׁ בַּקָּמָה׳, with Shavuot 50 days later, which can be on any day, with the pharisaic tradition fixing it on the 16th of Nissan.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וֶאֱמֹר, שֶׁלֹּא נַחֲלֹק עִם הַקָּרָאִים בְּמַה שֶּׁהֵם טוֹעֲנִים עָלֵינוּ מִן הַמּוּבָן מִמִּלַּת 'מִמָּחֳרָת הַשַּׁבָּת' וְ'עַד מִמָּחֳרָת הַשַּׁבָּת' שֶׁהוּא מִיּוֹם רִאשׁוֹן, וְאַחַר כֵּן נֹאמַר שֶׁאֶחָד מִן הַכֹּהֲנִים אוֹ הַשּׁוֹפְטִים אוֹ הַמְּלָכִים, הָרְצוּיִים עִם דַּעַת הַסַּנְהֶדְרִין וְכָל הַחֲכָמִים, רָאָה כִּי הַכַּוָּנָה מִן הַמִּסְפָּר הַהוּא לָשׂוּם חֲמִשִּׁים יוֹם בֵּין בִּכּוּרֵי קְצִיר שְׂעוֹרִים וּבִכּוּרֵי קְצִיר חִטִּים, וּשְׁמִירַת שִׁבְעָה שָׁבוּעוֹת שֶׁהֵם שֶׁבַע שַׁבָּתוֹת תְּמִימוֹת, וְנָתַן לָנוּ דִמְיוֹן בִּתְחִלַּת יוֹם מֵהַשָּׁבוּעַ, לוֹמַר: אִם תִּהְיֶה הַהַתְחָלָה 'מֵהָחֵל חֶרְמֵשׁ בַּקָּמָה' מִיּוֹם רִאשׁוֹן – תַּגִּיעוּ עַד יוֹם הָרִאשׁוֹן, לְהַקִּישׁ מִמֶּנּוּ, שֶׁאִם תִּהְיֶה הַהַתְחָלָה מִיּוֹם שֵׁנִי – נַגִּיעַ עַד יוֹם שֵׁנִי. וְ'הָחֵל חֶרְמֵשׁ' מֻנָּח אֵלֵינוּ, בְּכָל עֵת שֶׁנִּרְאֶה שֶׁהוּא רָאוּי – נַתְחִיל בּוֹ וְנִסְפֹּר מִמֶּנּוּ. וְקָבְעוּ אוֹתוֹ שֶׁיִּהְיֶה יוֹם שֵׁנִי שֶׁל פֶּסַח וְלֹא יִהְיֶה בָזֶה סְתִירָה לַתּוֹרָה, וְהִתְחַיַּבְנוּ לְקַבְּלוֹ לְ'תוֹרָה', מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהוּא מִן 'הַמָּקוֹם אֲשֶׁר יִבְחַר ה' ' עִם הַתְּנָאִים הַנִּזְכָּרִים. וְשֶׁמָּא הָיָה זֶה בִנְבוּאָה מֵאֵת הַבּוֹרֵא, וְיָכוֹל לִהְיוֹת, וְנִהְיֶה נְקִיִּים מִבִּלְבּוּל הַמְבַלְבְּלִים.</p>\n<p>And let us state that we do not dispute with the Karaites regarding what they claim against us from the plain meaning of the phrase “from the morrow of the Sabbath” and “until the morrow of the Sabbath”—that it refers to Sunday. And then let us say that one of the priests or judges or kings—approved by the opinion of the Sanhedrin and all the sages—understood that the purpose of that number was to place fifty days between the offering of the first fruits of the barley harvest and the offering of the first fruits of the wheat harvest, and to ensure the counting of seven weeks which are seven complete Sabbaths. And He presented us with a model beginning from the start of a day of the week, saying: if the beginning of “from the time the sickle is first put to the standing grain” is on a Sunday, you will reach the following Sunday—thus providing a comparison: if the beginning is on a Monday, you will reach the following Monday. And the phrase “the putting of the sickle” is entrusted to us—to begin whenever we deem it appropriate—and we will count from that point. And they established it to be the second day of Passover, and this will not be a contradiction to the Torah, and we are obligated to accept it as “Torah” because it comes from “the place which the Lord will choose” in accordance with the specified conditions. And perhaps this was by prophecy from the Creator—and it could be—and thus we will be free from the confusion of those who sow confusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(See <a href=\"https://musingsonthetorah.blogspot.com/2023/05/is-sefiras-haomer-zman-gerama.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more elaboration of this thesis as well as a possible halachic implication)</p>\n\n\n",

Most Hasidic groups wore hats or shtreimels, etc. People who were strictly religious but not \"Hassidic\" and didn't wear shtreimels, wore black hats / fedoras - they still do. B\"H, they're keeping Borsalino still in business (LOL)! A step below that for those not wearing hats, they wear black kippot.</p>\n\n<p>On the \"opposite\" end, I recall that silk \"big dome\" yarmulkes were the only type you got at a Bar Mitzvah and wedding. I guess making crochetted or leather ones weren't yet in style or the cost was prohibitive. Parents who wanted to get their toddlers interested in wearing kippot encouraged them by getting one withe their name engraved and having some design or colors (other than black) so they would find wearing a kippah more exciting. Teenagers and some older people picked up on the idea, and that spread.</p>\n\n<p>Commercialism picked up, somewhat on the idea as well. Maybe they saw the kippah as a form of \"advertising\". I've seen kippot with store names and sports teams (Mets / Yankees) on them. I'm not saying that the sports teams, themselves are promoting the kippot, but whoever is creating them is somehow influenced (and, perhaps, getting a \"kickback\") from a sports tema or some connection to it?</p>\n\n\n",

So it would seem there is some \"wiggle\" room for those deemed wicked, especially if it is \"known\" that they are of an unsavoury nature.</p>\n<p>At first glance, the term \"rasha\" is quite harsh and when issued without thought or reason carries a strong reaction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.28a.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 28a</a> brings three labels that a person is not allowed to call someone, one of which is \"rasha\" (the other two are \"eved\" and \"mamzer\"), to the point that the injured party is permitted to hate him, and even to reduce his livelihood and harass him in his business (as per the explanation of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.28a.5?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Kiddushin.28a.5.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>). However, it is not so clearcut. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.28a.5?lang=bi&p2=Meiri_on_Kiddushin.28a.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meiri</a> there says the term \"rasha\" is used in this context to mean one who engages in immoral behaviour. So, there are layers to this \"hatred\" - the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.28a.5?lang=bi&p2=Piskei_Tosafot_on_Kiddushin.52.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pischei Tosafos</a> adds that whilst he is indeed allowed to hate him, he is not permitted to descend to his profession. In other words, while one may have disdain or hatred for someone who is considered wicked, it is not permissible to \"sink\" to the level of engaging with that person in their profession (e.g., working together, learning from them, or collaborating in ways that could be seen as morally compromising).</p>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.7b.9?ven=english%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis 7b</a> writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבָּה בַּר רַב הוּנָא: כׇּל אָדָם שֶׁיֵּשׁ לוֹ עַזּוּת פָּנִים — <strong>מוּתָּר לִקְרוֹתוֹ רָשָׁע</strong>, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״הֵעֵז אִישׁ רָשָׁע בְּפָנָיו״. רַב נַחְמָן בַּר יִצְחָק אָמַר: מוּתָּר לִשְׂנאוֹתוֹ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וְעֹז פָּנָיו יְשֻׁנֶּא״. אַל תִּקְרֵי ״יְשֻׁנֶּא״, אֶלָּא ״יִשָּׂנֵא״.</p>\n<p>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: With regard to any man who is insolent, <strong>it is permitted to call him wicked</strong> to his face, as it is stated: “A wicked man makes his face insolent” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.21.29?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 21:29</a>). Rav Nacḥman bar Yitzcḥak said: It is permitted to hate him, as it is stated: “And the insolence of his face is changed” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.8.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ecclesiastes 8:1</a>). Do not read it as: “Is changed [yeshunne]”; rather, read it as: Is hated [yissane], as the two words are spelled the same way in Hebrew, albeit with different vocalization and pronunciation.

But if you have probed his ways and seen that the fear of G–d is not before his eyes and that he always persists in a way that is not good — such as one who divests himself of the yoke of Heaven or is unheedful of a transgression which every one of his people knows to be a transgression — that is, whether the sin you wish to reveal has been committed deliberately many times by the sinner or he often transgresses deliberately a different sin which is known by all to be a sin — then it is apparent that it is not because his evil inclination overpowered him that he transgressed the word of the L–rd, but that he does as his heart sees fit and the fear of G–d is not before his eyes. <strong>Therefore, it is permitted to shame him and to speak demeaningly of him, both before him and in his absence.</strong> And if he does something or says something which can be judged either in the scales of merit or in the scales of guilt, he must be judged in the scales of guilt, since he has shown himself to be an absolute evildoer in his other affairs. And thus have our Rabbis said (Bava Metzia 59a): \"'And you shall not wrong, one man, his fellow [amito]' (Vayikra 25:17) — 'a people who is with you' [am ito] in Torah and mitzvoth — do not wrong him with words!\" And if one does not direct his heart to the word of the L–rd, it is permitted to shame him for his deeds, to make known his abominations, and to spill scorn upon him. And they said further (Yoma 86b): \"Flatterers are exposed because of the desecration of the Name [that they engender].\" And much more so if one reproved him for [his sin] and he did not desist from it, is it permitted to expose him and to reveal his sin in \"the public gate\" and to spill scorn upon him, until he returns to the good, as the Rambam has written in the end of Hilchoth Deoth 5. But it is important not to forget certain considerations that this entails, which I have written of in Be'er Mayim Chayim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is also worth noting the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.201.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 201:4</a> which, whilst doesn't out right say you can refer to someone who has thrown off the yoke of yiddushkeit as a \"rasha\" - it nevertheless does carry an impact al pi halacha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל הַפּוֹרְשְׁים מִדַּרְכֵי הַצִּבּוּר, וְהֵם הָאֲנָשִׁים שֶׁפָּרְקוּ עֹל הַמִצְוֹת מֵעַל צַוָּארָם, וְאֵין נִכְלָלִים בִּכְלַל יִשְֹרָאֵל בַּעֲשִׂיָתָם, אֶלָּא הֲרֵי הֵם כִּבְנֵי חוֹרִין לְעַצְמָן, וְכֵן הַמּוּמָרִים וְהַמּוֹסְרִים וְהָאֶפִּיקוֹרְסִים, כָּל אֵלּוּ, אֵין אוֹנְנִים וְאֵין מִתְאַבְּלִים עֲלֵיהֶם, אֶלָּא אֲחֵיהֶם ושְׁאָר קְרוֹבֵיהֶם לוֹבְשִׁים לְבָנִים וּמִתְעַטְּפִים לְבָנִים, וְאוֹכְלִים וְשוֹתִים וּשְׂמֵחִים עַל שֶׁאִבְּדוּ שׂוֹנְאוֹ שֶׁל מָקוֹם. וַעֲלֵיהֶם הַכָּתוּב אוֹמֵר, הֲלֹּא מְשַׂנְאֶיךָ ה', אֶשְׂנָא. וְאוֹמֵר, וּבַאֲבֹד רְשָׁעִים רִנָּה.

Their brothers and other relatives dress in white and adorn themselves in white, eat, drink, and rejoice that the enemies of the Almighty have perished. Concerning such people, the Scripture says, \"Behold those who hate you Ado-noy, I hate\" also it is said, \"When the wicked perish there is joy.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.11.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 11:10</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The pninei Halacha says (in regards to hating a Rasha) in <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/08-01-05/#note_8_1_1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">likkutim bet 1:5</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דיונים רחבים ישנם על הגדרת הרשע כיום, אולם אפשר לומר ככלל, שבמצוות שבין אדם למקום, הרשע הוא זה שעובר עבירות כדי להכעיס. כלומר הוא אינו מחלל שבת מפני שאינו מבין את משמעות השבת ונוח לו לעשות מלאכות, אלא הוא מחלל שבת כדי להתריס ולהראות שאינו מאמין בה’ ובתורתו, ואינו מתחשב במנהגי ישראל. ואילו במצוות שבין אדם לחבירו, הרשע הוא זה שבאופן עקרוני ושיטתי פוגע באנשים, וגם לאחר שהעירו לו על כך, לא קיבל אלא ממשיך במנהגיו הרעים. אבל מי שנכשל מפעם לפעם בחטאים שבין אדם לחבירו, אינו נחשב רשע שמותר לשונאו.</p>\n<p>There are wide discussions regarding the definition of a Rasha nowadays, but we can say in general, when it comes to Being Adam L'makom, a Rasha is someone who sins in order to anger (Hashem). Meaning, he doesn't break shabbos because he doesn't understand the importance of shabbos and he prefers to do melacha, rather he breaks breaks shabbos in order to anger and show that he didn't believe in Hashem or the Torah, and doesn't care about the Jewish customs. And when it comes to Bein Adam L'chaveiro, a Rasha is someone who fundamentally and habitually hurts people, and even when he was told not to, he didn't accept the remark and kept doing his bad deeds. But someone who sins from time to time in regards to Bein Adam L'chaveiro, is not considered a Rasha who may be hated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

All opinions agree that one is permitted - perhaps even obligated - to abort if the mother's life is in direct danger due to the pregnancy - perhaps even up to actual birthing. If the mother is not in direct danger, but will have negatively impacted health, most opinions hold that abortion is prohibited, but there are opinions which find ways in which to permit it.</p>\n<h2>Abortion</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Oholot.7.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אוהלות ז:ו</a> – If a woman is having trouble giving birth and her life is in danger you can cut up the foetus and remove it limb by limb because her life comes first.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This seems to imply that abortion is אסור since only if the woman's life is in danger\ncan you abort the foetus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>אוהלות continued – Once the child has started coming out you can't kill it since you can't trade a life for another life.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What changes between these two stages?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>:<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Niddah.5.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">נדה ה:ג</a> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.44b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מד</a> – The חיוב מיתה for killing a baby is only if its alive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.42a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">.ב\"ק מב</a> – if people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and cause her to miscarriage the person who hit her has to pay (and doesn't go the עיר מקלט).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arakhin.7a.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">.ערכין ז</a> – A woman who is חייב מיתת ב\"ד is killed immediately, and we don't wait for her to give birth first if she's pregnant.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From these three גמראs it seems clear that abortion is not murder, however from אוהלות we see that its אסור.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a מחלוקת תנאים about when the foetus gets a נשמה;</p>\n<p>:סנהדרין צא – According to ר' יהודה הנשיא it occurs immediately upon conception.</p>\n<p>:מנחות צט – According to both ר' יוחנן and ר' אליעזר it occurs on the 40th day after conception.</p>\n<p>רש\"י מנחות – This is because before this point the foetus has no form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly we see that there is a נשמה before birth, why then is it not murder to abort?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>:יד רמ\"ה סנהדרין עב:, צא – Having a נשמה is different than having a נפש, you only have a נפש when you are born (this works well with the משנה in אוהלות).\nויקרא כד:יז –i\"כל נפש אדם\".</p>\n<p>:רש\"י, יד רמ\"ה, מאירי סנהדרין עב – This פסוק excludes someone who isn't yet born.\nרש\"י שם – Explains the משנה in אוהלות like this (that it doesn't have a נפש and thats why its not murder).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Another reason why abortion isn't considered murder is because a baby isn't considered a בר קיימא unless its born to term (after a full pregnancy);</li>\n</ul>\n<p>:סנהדרין פד – Brings down an apparent סתירה between פסוקים: in שמות כא:יב it says \"מכה איש ומת\" while in במדבר לה:ל it says \"כל מכה נפש\" (is it נפש or איש). The גמרא answers that this teaches that you are only חייב if you kill an איש who is a נפש, meaning a בר קיימא.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Another reason why abortion isn't considered murder is because עובר ירך אמו, that a foetus is considered a limb of the mother (see .ב\"ק עח., תוספות ב\"ק מז., תוספות סנהדרין ס).

This is helped by the fact that the רמב\"ם seems to refer to the foetus as a נפש the entire time, even before it emerges, possibly meaning that there is some type of murder when killing the foetus.</p>\n<p>R' Unterman quoted in נועם Volume 6 Pgs 1-11, אגרות משה חו\"מ חלק ב סימנים סט-עא – Are מחמר based on this, and we need to be חושש that the foetus is a human being at the outset. However, they agreed its not classic רציחה, its a different אסור מדאורייתא which is an אבזרייהו (branch) of רציחה</p>\n<p>חוות יאיר סימן לא and others – Disagree and understand that really the רמב\"ם holds that a foetus is not a נפש and the reason he uses it here is only because its a good model for the rule of רודף, however רודף is only one reason why you can abort a foetus.</p>\n<p><em>What is wrong with abortion, what is the אסור?</em></p>\n<p>משך חכמה פרשת דברים כב:יט – One who causes abortion without a good reason is חייב מיתה בידי שמים.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It seems like the משך חכמה holds like R' Unterman and R' Feinstein that abortion is a type of רציחה.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>:סנהדרין נז – Brings down a מחלוקת תנאים about whether בני נח is killed for killing foetuses (performing an abortion), according to the תנא קמא he isn't, while according to רבי ישמעאל he is based on the פסוק in בראשית ט:ו which states \"שפך דם האדם באדם דמו ישפך\", since an אדם inside an אדם is a foetus.</p>\n<p>רמב\"ם מלכים ט:ד – Holds like רבי ישמעאל.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we hold that בן נח is חייב מיתת ב\"ד for performing an abortion, shouldn't it also be אסור for a Jew?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.תוספות חולין לג – Brings down the principal of ליכא מידי דלישראל שרי ולעובד כוכבים אסור</p>\n<p>(I thought this תוספות applies this directly to the גמרא in סנהדרין, but I don't see it in the תוספות itself...).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>You could understand that this means its אסור מדאורייתא, however it could only be מדרבנן.</p>\n<p>:תוספות נידה מד.-מד – Disagrees, seems to say its מותר for a Jew to perform abortion.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>זוהר שמות ג – Has harsh words for actions which could be fatal for the foetus: says its a תועבה, it removes the שכינה, etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It could be that abortion is an אסור of הוצאת זרע לבטלה, since .נדה יג says its like שפיכות דמים (brought down in the חות יאיר שם as a possibility).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>R' Aharon Lichtenstein – If you don't say abortion is in the family of רציחה but its אסור מדאורייתא it could be any of the following;</p>\n<p>צפנת פעניח חלק א סימן נט – Its an אסור of חבלה.</p>\n<p>R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (מפי שמועה) – Its either גזלה,iלא תעמוד על דם רעך, or a ביטול עשה of הצלה.</p>\n<p>R' Ben-Zion Uzziel in משפטי עוזיאל חלק ג חו\"מ מו – Its השבת אבדה.</p>\n<p>R' Aharon Lichtenstein – Its \"וחי בהם\".</p>\n<p>זוהר שם – You are diminishing the צלם אלוקים.</p>\n<p><em>If abortion is דרבנן, what is the אסור?</em></p>\n<p>R' Lichtenstein – All the reasons we said above could be the basis for the דרבנן (eg, if you kill a foetus you will get used to killing and kill a person). Alternatively, it could be the תורה is against this, however its only vague ethic without a particular אסור, and the רבנן crystallized it and gave it a definite אסור.</p>\n<p><strong>הלכה למעשה</strong></p>\n<p>If she is pregnant because of rape or adultery, if the pregnancy will exacerbate internal diseases which will her cause her to be unhealthy (however won't kill her) or will cause her to die early (ie, it will take years off her life), if the pregnancy will cause her psychiatric/mental problems, or if there are serious social or economic factors, the ציץ אליעזר is generally מקל while R' Moshe Feinstein and R' Unterman are generally מחמר, while R' Aharon Lichtenstein says it depends at what stage of development the foetus is in: if it could be taken out of the womb and survive he is מחמר, while if it won't he is מקל.</p>\n<p>Stages of Development</p>\n<p>Obviously development begins at conception.</p>\n<p>Embryonic Period – The point in time when the major structures begin to form, generally starting 40 days after conception.</p>\n<p>Fetal Period – The point in time when there is maturation of tissues and organs, generally starting 9 weeks after conception.</p>\n<p>Viabilitiy – The point in time when the foetus would be able to survive outside the womb. In the time of the גמרא (about 500CE) a foetus sometimes wasn't even viable at 8 months, while nowadays due to technology the foetus is viable in 22 weeks or 5 and ½ months (and this time is due to shorten with further medical advancements).</p>\n<p>:יבמות סט – Refers to the first 40 days of development as מי בעלמא (just water).</p>\n<p>שרידי אש חלק ג סימן קכז – Therefore abortion is permitted during this time.</p>\n<p>R' Unterman – Is מחמר even during the first 40 days since the גמרא and many ראשונים say that if she is found pregnant during the first 40 days and the embryo's health is threatened we can be מחלל שבת to help it.</p>\n<p>R' Yosef Dov Soloveitchik – The reason why we are מחלל שבת is because it can keep other שבתות, and thats why we can מחלל שבת here (since there is the potential), however this doesn't mean that its אסור to perform abortion.</p>\n<p>From after 40 days until the first trimester;</p>\n<p>:משנה בכורות מז – Recognizes the first trimester.</p>\n<p>יביע אומר חלק ד אה\"ע סימן ח – Because of this in the first three months there is no אסור of abortion, even for a non-Jew.</p>\n<p>Between 3 months and viability most פסוקים are much more מחמר about abortion.</p>\n<p>ציץ אליעזר – Is מקל, possibly even up to 6-7 months. One example of this;\nחלק ז סימן מח (?) – Its מותר to perform an abortion in a מקום צער מרובה and צריך גדול (this seems to include social and economic problems).</p>\n<p>If the mother has a heart condition;</p>\n<p>R' Chaim Ozer Grodzinsky – The foetus is a רודף.</p>\n<p>If the mother will become sick;</p>\n<p>ציץ אליעזר חלק ו סימן מח (?no such סימן?) – Its מותר to do an abortion.</p>\n<p>If the child will have tay sachs, aids, down syndrome etc;</p>\n<p>?אגרות משה חו\"מ חלק א סימן – Is מחמר.</p>\n<p>ציץ אליעזר חלק ט סימן ג אות ג ס\"ק ט, חלק ט סימן נא, חלק ג סימן קב – Is מקל.</p>\n<p>If her pregnancy is as a result of rape;</p>\n<p>שאילת יעבץ חלק א סימן מג (R' Yaakov Emden) – Is מקל</p>\n<ul>\n<li>However, others are מחמר.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the pregnancy is as a result of adultery;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>פוסקים are מחמר since its her responsibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Typically the protocol of פסק regarding abortion is if the woman feels there is great economic difficulty, etc, we try to abort during the first 40 days, however in a great need we abort even during the first trimester. Also, the best means of abortion is to use a drug if possible.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What about the רמב\"ם, how do we explain him according to those who are מקל?</p>\n<p>R' Chaim Soloveitchik on this רמב\"ם;</p>\n<p>שו\"ע חו\"מ תכה:ב – If you are in a boat and there is a donkey in a boat zipping by your boat and the donkey jumps into your boat and you are going to capsize if you don't get rid of the donkey, מדין רודף you can kill it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why is a donkey a רודף, it doesn't know what its doing? Since its not a full being you can use the דין of רודף to kill it. Therefore, a foetus isn't fully formed, so its like the donkey and you can apply the דין of רודף, however once it emerges its considered a fully formed being, so since its not its fault that its killing the mother you can no longer use רודף to kill it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I know that my answer is horribly unsourced, but it might help somebody out there anyway. If it is 100% certain that the pregnancy will kill the mother, then an abortion would be permitted, because the mother's life takes precedence over the baby's life. (This remains true until the baby's head and/or most of its body is born, at which point it and the mother have equal rights.)</p>\n\n<p>Cases where a pregnancy is dangerous for the mother but not clearly fatal must be determined by a competent Rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that the Tzitz Eliezer permitted early abortions in some limited circumstances, although some other poskim disagreed with this psak.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an anecdotal bit of information, for those of you familiar with the frumteens site. A young girl (13-14) posted that she was pregnant after her friend's brother basically raped her. (I don't know whether this has any bearing, but the girl's mother wanted her to abort.) Rabbi Shapiro (the head moderator of the site, who is also a Rabbi in Bayswater) posted the names and numbers of a bunch of poskim and told her to call them ASAP - if the first didn't answer she should call the next, etc. My impression is that he wanted to get her a psak that an abortion would be muttar before she passed a certain point in her pregnancy. I believe that after the girl called a posek (and presumably got a psak that it was muttar), he then told the girl that it was her decision - she could abort if she wanted to, but she didn't have to.</p>\n\n<p>But please, nobody should pasken for themselves from what I say that I think that somebody else said, in a different case. For anybody who is tempted to do so, I'll point out that Rabbi Shapiro had the girl herself call a posek, and didn't just tell her himself that it was muttar.</p>\n\n<p>It is especially important to consult with a competent Rabbi when it comes to these types of cases before taking any action (or inaction). An error in either direction could have devastating consequences.</p>\n\n<p>-Rebbetzin HaQoton</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The basic halacha would seem to turn on whether or not the infant is a rodef or not (after the 40 day mayim bealma limit mentioned by Rashi). <a href=\"http://www.hamakor.org/ishus/abort.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mordechai Torczyner</a> gives a list of sources as follows\nNote that the site I point to actually has links to the seforim quoted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abortion</p>\n<p><em>Verses in Tanach</em> Vayikra 24:17</p>\n<p><em>Talmud / Midrash and Commentaries</em>\nArachin 7a<br />\nNiddah 44b<br />\nOholot 7:6<br />\nSanhedrin 57b, 59<br />\nShitah Mekubetzet Arachin 7a:5<br />\nTosafot   Niddah 44b<br />\nTosafot Sanhedrin 59</p>\n<p><em>Post Talmud / Midrash, Pre-Rishonim</em><br />\n<em>Mishneh Torah and commentaries</em><br />\nHilchot Rotzeiach 1:9</p>\n<p><em>Rishonim [Pre-\"Code of Jewish Law\"]</em><br />\nRambam's Commentary to Mishnah\nOholot 7:6</p>\n<p><em>Tur, Shulchan Aruch [\"Code of Jewish Law\"] and Commentaries</em><br />\nShulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat 425:2</p>\n<p><em>Acharonim [Post-\"Code of Jewish Law\"]</em><br />\nChavot Yair 31<br />\nLevushei Mordechai Yoreh Deah 87<br />\nMaharam Schick Yoreh Deah 155<br />\nMaharit 1:97, 99<br />\nSedei Chemed Pe'at haSadeh 1:52\nShe'eilot Yaavetz 1:43<br />\nTiferet Tzvi Orach Chaim 14<br />\nTorah Lishmah 504</p>\n<p><em>Recent Authorities</em><br />\nAchiezer 3:65<br />\nIgrot Moshe Even haEzer 4:71, Yoreh Deah 2:60<br />\nMishpitei Uziel Even haEzer 79<br />\nSeridei Eish 3:127<br />\nTzitz Eliezer 7:48, 9:51:3, 13:102<br />\nYabia Omer 4: Even haEzer 1</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Berel Wein contrasts the reactions of Aharon HaKohen and Iyov in dealing with personal tragedies</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Aharon’s reaction to this is silent acceptance of the realities that now face him. He does not rail against perceived injustice, as does Iyov. Nor does he withdraw from the fray of life and go into seclusion, as did many others when faced with similar tragic situations. Aharon becomes the paradigm for how humans are to deal with the “eighth day” – with life and its ups and downs.</p>\n<p>Resilience and silent inner strength engendered by faith and acceptance of God’s will are the weapons of living on in spite of all that the “eighth day” imposes upon one’s life. These words are much easier to write and to read than to actually implement. Yet the Torah expects no less from us than it did from Aharon. Life and our contributions and meaningful behavior towards making it better and stronger are always played out on the background of the “eighth day.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://vbm-torah.org/archive/intparsha65/26-65shemini.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Fire of Nadav and Avihu</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for Aharon's silence, it is most fitting of all. Who realized more\nthan the aged priest the great dangers inherent in unbridled religious\nenthusiasm? Who understood more than he did, as he stood powerless to\nstem the crowd excitedly clamoring for a golden calf, that the best\nintentioned acts of worship can so easily degrade into coarse and\ncorrosive idolatry? His beloved children, whom he hoped would one day\nsucceed him in the service of God, now lay dead at his feet, but how\ncould he blame the Deity for their demise? Nadav and Avihu were\nconsumed by an inner fire that could not but be matched by an outer\nfire from above. Did the poet king perhaps have them in mind when he\nbid his beloved to</p>\n<p>Place me as a signet upon your heart and as a seal upon your hand, for\nlove is as powerful as death and yearning as cruel as the grave, its\nflames are the flames of God's consuming fire! (Shir ha-Shirim 8:6).</p>\n<p>And did God Himself perhaps have them in mind as well when He twice\nwarned Moshe at the revelation at Sinai to distance the people and the\npriests from the mount, lest \"they break forth to ascend towards God,\nand He then break forth upon them\" (Shemot 19:24)?</p>\n<p>All religions speak of Divine mercy and love, inviting us to lovingly\nembrace God in turn. And who is there that does not want to experience\nthat connectedness and concern of God in their own life? Who is there\nthat does not want to serve God sincerely with enthusiasm and passion?\nOne of the most unique contributions of the Torah to religious\ndiscourse, however, is that worship of God, if it is to be genuine,\nmust also be predicated upon reverence and fear, for reverence\nprovides the restraints that love refuses to recognize. Nadav and\nAvihu tragically perished at the very moment that God's presence was\nmost intensely felt. But through their death, the two brothers\ncommunicated a fundamental lesson that was to inform the service of\nthe Mishkan and Temple (and for that matter the synagogue) for all\ntime. \"Moshe said to Aharon: this is in accordance with what God\nspoke, for He said that 'I will be sanctified by those that are close\nto Me, and I will be glorified in the sight of all of the people'.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://koltorah.org/volume9/shemini2000.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Too Close for Comfort by Hillel Liss</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now we can see why the Torah must comment on the fact that Aharon is silent. Aharon has learned the lessons which Hashem had just taught and accepted Hashem's will. The Torah develops this idea of maintaining a distance from Hashem in the rest of Parshat Shemini by contrasting purity and impurity in the later Pesukim. This is also why Hashem says \"And separate between Kodesh and Chol, and between impure and pure.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ramban: Aharon had been weeping, but on hearing Moshe's consolation (Shmini 10:3) he stopped.</p>\n<p>Seforno: He found comfort in the knowledge that Hashem's Name had been sanctified by his sons.</p>\n<p>Rashi: As a reward for his silent acceptance of Hashem's decree, Aharon was honored by having the following mitzvos (10:8-11) addressed to him.</p>\n<p>Rav Shimshon Refael hirsch points out that this is an indication that the greater the people, the more strict Hashem is with them. As a result, Aharon could not respond because he realized that Hashem must answer the slightest deviation of his great ones. Rav Hirsch also points out that this is one of the many things told to Moshe that were not written down and, if not for this incident, would have remained in Torah Sheb'al Peh.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R' Mordechai Greenberg (Rosh Yeshiva of KBY) once explained that the idea of a Kohen is to be the shaliach (proxy) of the nation in their relationship to Hashem.  They bring the offerings of the people, and are meant to be faithful representatives of those whom they represent.  Thus, everything that the Kohanim did was emphasized as being \"כאשר צוה ה\" - exactly as Hashem commanded.  A Kohen who is putting his own feelings and emotions into the Avoda is warping his sender's own service.  Therefore, Nadav and Avihu had perilously endangered the entire institution of Priesthood and its functionality by exuberantly bringing a fire \"אשר לא צוה ה\", that Hashem had not commanded.</p>\n\n<p>Aharon was actually saving the entire institution of Priesthood with his silence - he was showing that one is capable of being unmoved by his own emotions and dutifully doing exactly what is expected of him.</p>\n\n\n",

If you teach by rote, if Torah isn't an integral part of your being but an appendage, children (and teens and adult students as well) will feel it. Study pnimiyus HaTorah to stoke that nitzutz within you. (Sefer HaTanya is a great place to start. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Get to know your students and what excites them and what they are good at. If one student is great with general Jewish knowledge, call on him to answer those kinds of questions. If another loves to read and translate, give him many chances to do so. (not to the exclusion of other students of course). When you call on them for things they are good at, they feel successful and people like to do things that make them feel successful. Make sure to Compliment all their accomplishments, however minor. Then they will see Torah learning as something they love and look forward to. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, making a personal connection with the students is always helpful if it is possible. This does not mean being \"buddies\" with your students - they should always respect you, there should be a certain distance. But sometimes when you share a piece of personal info (like a personal story about your family) or when you go over to them after class with a personal compliment, it makes you more real to them. When they see their Torah-teacher as a REAL person, they can relate their interest in your subject to an interest in YOU. That then gives YOU a responsibility to behave in the way you'd like to see them behave. Once they relate well to you, you can be such a positive example of living a Torah lifestyle and growing in mitzvah observance.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a great question and there are a number of angles that one can approach it.</p>\n<h2><strong>(I) Make Torah Sweet!</strong></h2>\n<p>Every day in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Ashkenaz%2C_Weekday%2C_Shacharit%2C_Preparatory_Prayers%2C_Torah_Blessings_(**All_3_blessings).2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ברכת התורה</a> we recite;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"והערב נא ה' אלקינו את דברי תורתך בפינו ובפי עמך בית ישראל\"</p>\n<p><em>“Please, Hashem, our G-d sweeten the words of Your Torah in our mouth and in the mouth of Your people”</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the very first approach to תלמוד תורה (Torah study) is to ensure that right from the outset children enjoy the concept even if they have not yet begun to learn it. This comes principally from the environment they have been raised in. If children have grown up in a home where תורה is prioritised, they will have an inbred appreciation of its importance. <strong>The Gerrer Rebbe, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchak_Meir_Alter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HaRav Yitzchak Meir Alter</a></strong> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21531&st=&pgnum=244&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> in his חידושי הרי״ם that this idea is based on the famous פסוק in שמע. We are instructed there that the first מצוה of the שמע is to love Hashem. This manifests itself in three ways; \"בכל לבבך ובכל נפשך ובכל מאדך\" – “With all your heart, with all your soul and with all your possessions”. Commenting on the first area of “בכל לבבך”, the חידושי הרי״ם explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וזוהי הבטחה אם יהיו על לבבך אז יכנסו אל הלב\"</p>\n<p><em>“This is the promise; if it shall be on your heart, then it will enter into the heart”</em>.\n(See <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21531&st=&pgnum=244&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חידושי הרי\"ם - פרשת ואתחנן ו:ה</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When a person makes the words of תורה meaningful to the extent that they are lying on the surface of the heart, when the heart opens up, the תורה on it will be absorbed. This is the mission of parents and educators – to inspire and thereby allow the words of תורה to descend into the receptive hearts of their children and students.</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Noach Berezovsky, the Slonimer Rebbe זצ\"ל</strong> highlights a beautiful אור החיים in פרשת כי תבוא which helps to further convey this idea (See נתיבי חינוך, פתיחה, עמוד ח). The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Deuteronomy.26.5.28?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אור החיים</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ואין טוב אלא תורה שאם היו בני אדם מרגישין במתיקות וערבות טוב התורה היו משתגעים ומתלהטים אחריה\"</p>\n<p><em>“There is nothing better than Torah, that if a person were to feel the sweetness and pleasantness inherent in Torah, they would become crazy in their passionate pursuit of it”.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Explains the Slonimer Rebbe, it is the job of an educator to capture this zest for תורה and to implant it within his students. A teacher must resultantly present his lessons in such a way that it both enlightens and excites his pupils. The subject material must serve to stimulate the children to the point that any other of life’s pleasures pale in comparison to the transcendent bliss of תלמוד תורה. In short, we must make the notion of תורה special in the eyes of children to the point that they always engage with it joyfully.</p>\n<p>There are a few ways in which this can be done. The first such example is an old custom that used to be practised amongst European Jewry, and is still done by many people today specifically for children who are just beginning תורה study. <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar_of_Worms\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Elozor of Worms</a> זצ״ל</strong> relates in the רוקח that young children would be brought to Shul on the morning of שבועות for their first encounter with the אלף-בית. Boards containing the Hebrew alphabet along with various פסוקים from the תורה were carried in and honey was placed on the letters. The Rebbi with great love, would then devotedly read the letters and פסוקים to the children after which, he would permit the children to lick the honey (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21522&st=&pgnum=193&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רוקח סימן רצו</a>). This is exactly the type of practise that creates a sense of love for תורה from an early stage. In a similar vein, the גמרא suggests on the eve of פסח to give children dried grain candies and nuts in order to prevent them from sleeping, and to stimulate them to ask questions. As the גמרא relates in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.109a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מסכת פסחים קט</a> that this was in fact the custom of רבי עקיבא. Therefore, it is clear that by making תורה both fun and easily accessible, children will naturally look forward to the next time they can enjoy a תורה education.</p>\n<h2><strong>(II) Should go at the right pace:</strong></h2>\n<p>Inspiration can only come if the style of teaching is done in a way that children will be able to gain from it. This means that educators require an awareness that each child has individual abilities and needs. When one masters this mindset, they will ensure that the pace in which one learns with their child or student follows the correct momentum (for a brief overview, refer to <strong>Rav Shlomo Wolbe</strong>’s זריעה ובנין בחינוך –  'חשיבות העיתוי', עמ' יב - יג). Should a parent or educator go at a speed that is too quick for a child, the result can be incredibly damaging. Not only will it obviously stifle any sense of progress, but it can sour the experience for the child. Rabbi Wolbe זצ״ל speaks at length of the need to go at the right pace. In the same way we do not push a child to use things that are not appropriate for his physical age, such as a knife that we fear he might cut himself with, so too, we should not pressure children to learn before they are ready. The reason for this is because when the correct time comes, the child will be too nervous to act, as the first encounter was too scarring an experience. Rushing a child’s spiritual growth can resultantly have untold effects on a student’s physical and emotional wellbeing (עלי שור, חלק ראשון, מאמר שני: חינוך, פרק שלישי, עמוד רסג).</p>\n<p>The ספר החינוך wisely asserts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וראוי לכל בן דעת שיתן לבו שלא להכביד על הילד בלמוד בעודנו רך האברים\nורך הלבב, עד שיגדל ויתחזק כח לבו ותקף אבריו, ועצמותיו ימלאו מח, ויוכל\nלסבל יגיעת הלמוד\"</p>\n<p><em>“It is fitting for an intelligent person to take care not to overload a child with studies while he is still soft of limbs and soft of heart, until he has grown and his heart has strengthened and his limbs reinforced, and his bones filled with intelligence, and he is able to withstand the exertion of learning”</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.419.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ספר החינוך, מצוה תיט: ללמד תורה וללמדה</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>(III) Don’t Pressurise</strong></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Iggeret_HaGra.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Vilna Gaon זצ\"ל</strong> in his famous letter to his wife</a>, mentions the need to prevent pressure when educating. Any pedagogic processes should be conveyed with affectionate and joyful transmission. As he asserts;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"כי אם בנחת כי הלימוד אינו נקבע באדם כי אם בישוב ובנחת\"</p>\n<p><em>“The learning must be done without undue pressure, rather gently, because it is best absorbed when one is relaxed.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means to say that any תורה study must be taught in a balanced manner. Whilst a person is obligated to teach their children, it is more important, if one wants it to be effective, that it be infused in a pleasant and placid manner. For this reason, the גר\"א goes on to suggest that rewarding children by giving them money serves to actively encourage them. No doubt, prizes within measure can go a long way to acting as an effective incentive.</p>\n<p>It is related about <strong>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein זצ\"ל</strong>, that when one of his sons was young, he went to learn with him one morning. However, this was soon cut short due to the audible cries of children playing from the nearby window. Hearing these shouts of enjoyment Rav Moshe told his son to close his ספר and to go out and play with his friends. Rav Moshe in his infinite wisdom realised that to continue in such conditions would only make his son feel shackled. Hearing all his friends playing whilst he was inside learning would serve to make him resent learning תורה, a far worse end result. Thus, we see from this beautiful anecdote how to effectively avoid instilling pressure amongst our children, and to remember that they have youthful urges that if stifled, can be more detrimental than positive.</p>\n<h2><strong>(IV) Fuelling Success through Happiness</strong></h2>\n<p>Perhaps the final approach is to seek success in תורה study. This can be achieved through a state of happiness. While educating, remaining both positive and optimistic is crucial, as תורה is by no means an easy thing to master. However, if one convinces the child from the outset that that they will be triumphant, success is sure to follow. <strong>The Sokatchover Rebbe</strong> in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19930&st=&pgnum=3&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הקדמה to אגלי טל</a> writes that the main מצוה of תורה study is to be happy. When a person enjoys his learning, the תורה is absorbed into his blood, which in turn, triggers an increased level of דביקות to Hashem. (As related by <strong>Rav Avraham Pam</strong> – עטרת למלך, 'הצלחה בתורה', עמוד קסה. It is also worth noting that we're told in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.19.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">תהלים יט:ט</a> that תורה study \"משמחי לב\" – i.e. literally gladdens the heart. It is for this reason that one is forbidden to learn תשעה באב, since on this day we assume the role of mourners, and learning תורה would detract from this sombre mood. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.384.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שלחן ערוך, יורה דעה סימן שפד</a>.).  In fact, parenthetically, the זוהר adds that the יצר הטוב – the good inclination, expands through a happiness of תורה.</p>\n<p>With this as a basis, a chain reaction naturally ensues. The happiness leads to contentment in learning which resultantly engenders increased effort on the part of the student. After gaining such an enjoyment in his learning the first time round, the תלמיד seeks to further this sensation by learning more. Eventually this leads to him not only looking forward to learning but positively encouraging him to want to learn as much as possible as he seeks to expand his knowledge. Indeed, אביי was aware of this phenomenon and harnessed this nascent motivation by making a huge banquet for the entire ישיבה every time a bochur finished a מסכת (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.118b.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שבת קיח</a> - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.119a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">קיט</a>). Thus, שמחה, the resulting happiness that stems from success, paves the way for עמילות בתורה – toil, an attribute that is vital in spiritual development. With solid perseverance, even those who are initially not skilled in תורה study can attain great heights.</p>\n<p>Through love, gentle assistance and personal example a child will grow to love תלמוד תורה. The trick is to maintain the שמחה. When the experience becomes bitter, the struggle begins, and it is the aim of a teacher to try and avert such a scenario. Often all it takes is a friendly and warm reception to fuel a student’s growth. <strong>Rabbi Chaim Shmulevitz זצ\"ל</strong> notes how the גמרא compares a teacher to a drop of rain (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.101a.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מסכת סנהדרין קא</a>). Just as rain provides the impetus to help plants grow, so too, a teacher has the ability to unlock the vast amount of unique potential within a student. It is therefore in the hands of a Rebbi to point out their students’ strengths in order for them to best utilise their potential. ((שיחות מוסר, מאמר מ: רב ותלמיד (א. He writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וזקוקה היא להשפעת הרב כדי לקבל כח צמיחה ולהתעלות למעלות עליונות\"</p>\n<p><em>“It is necessary for the Rav to use his influence in order to gain (from his students) the strength of growth and to raise them to higher levels”</em>.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In line with this idea, a great lesson can be learnt from the following vignette concerning the great <strong>Rabbi Elchonon Bunim Wasserman הי\"ד</strong>. There was once a תלמיד who was failing to make any progress with his learning. Coupled with this, was the fact that he suffered from a terrible speech impediment thereby further hampering his development. Completely demoralised, he made up his mind to leave the yeshiva and slowly made his way to the Rosh Yeshiva’s office. As he entered, R’ Elchonon immediately explained that משה רבינו also stuttered yet he became one of the greatest prophets of all time and was responsible for the exodus of Egypt and the giving of the עשרת הדברות. R’ Elchonon continued by telling him that people who speak constantly achieve little, whilst men of action speak few words. As a result his task must be to start anew; to enter the בית המדרש and begin like a child, to study continuously and to then review many times, until the מסכת would be stripped down to its most basic פשט. Such a task is not easy. In fact the depths of Torah are vast but he urged the boy to walk the narrow path that lay before him. One can fall in the dark, but as long as he picks himself up the path will eventually become visible, as the person becomes more acclimatised to his surroundings and uncovers the path of Torah. Sooner or later the Torah becomes part of every fibre of his being. R’ Elchonon turned to the bochur and told him that he is currently standing on a twisted path and must navigate his way through it. With perseverance the crooked path will become straight, and success in תורה is bound to follow (As related in <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422600238.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shimon Finkelman, 5 Great Leaders, (Mesorah Publications Ltd – 2005)</a>, pp. 288-289). No doubt these thoughts spurred the bochur into action as such words have the ability to rouse even the most unenthusiastic person! The key is positivity, and it is essential that even if a student is finding something hard, one make sure that they help them through it. Once one overcomes such a hurdle, the happiness will be rekindled and the appreciation for תורה will continue. This will in turn ignite a passion for תורה, thereby initiating a natural עמילות within the student. This toil translates into success serving to further motivate the תלמיד to even greater heights.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam in the laws of Yibum points out that if a brother with multiple wives dies childless, then any one of the wives (and any one brother) can perform yibum or chalitzah. In this case, since Boaz is not a brother, then the \"goail\" is an analogy only and not the actual yibum of the Torah. In this case, it would appear that Boaz could have married both or either (if they were not sisters but only sisters-in-law). In actual fact, Rus could have married anyone (technically) Naomi would have gotten some Elimelech's estate for her kesuvah, the remainder would have been divided to become the brothers' estates. Rus would have gotten some of Machlon's estate for her kesuvah (assuming the psak was that she was originally a valid convert)  and the remainder would have been inherited by Elimelech's brother. That is one of the reasons why Boaz and Rus have the term \"chesed\" applied to them.</p>\n\n<p>If Orpah had accompanied Naomi, the same reasoning would have applied. Since she did not, it showed that she was not a valid convert and she was not entitled to any of her \"husband's\" estate.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the psak of \"moav velo moaviah\" (only a female Moabite is accepted as a ger) had been forgotten and needed to be re-established. That is also why Shmuel had to write Megillas Rus and Ploni Almoni was afraid to marry Rus. Only Boaz, the gadol hador, was in a position to enforce this ruling.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Secret Ops, The President, and The Blessing On a King\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the conditions to make the brocha on kings is that they have the power to kill you (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_HaRadbaz_Volume_1.296?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radvaz 1:296</a> as well as the Orchot Chaim Brachos 49 that say that this brocha is recited on any monarch with enough power to execute or pardon from execution). Although the President could kill someone through different channels (Military, NSA, Secret Service), seemingly that ability could only come clandestily, for if it were ever to come out to light that the President had someone killed he would be subject to impeachment. My question though, is the fact that he  can execute someone only come through secret ways enough of a reason to make the Brocha? Is the sheer ability to have someone killed the main criteria according to the Radvaz? Or is it the unquestioned wanton ability to have you murdered the true litmus test to make the brocha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The Radbaz's language (responsum #296) is that he can kill \"keMishpat\", lawfully. A mob boss, for instance, has the ability to kill, but not lawfully. So I presume if the use of power was totally unlawful for the position, halacha wouldn't consider it. (It doesn't say \"he can kill anyone he feels like\", or \"he can kill you.\" Just that he can lawfully find people guilty and execute them.)</p>\n\n<p>This is actually a moot point with regards to the US President. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef (Yechave Daat 2:28) and the Piskei Teshuvos on Orach Chaim 224 both feel that the president's power to pardon someone from the death penalty is considered \"the power of life and death.\" (I've read that the framers of the Constitution intentionally gave the US President this power to echo the classical monarchs.)</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli newspapers reported that an ailing Rav Ovadia paskened, on President Obama's last visit to Israel, that the US President's role as commander-in-chief of the army (no secrets there) is also considered \"the power of life and death.\"</p>\n\n<p>(The Tzitz Eliezer, 22:14, disagrees, by the way.)</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the US President has an additional power of life-and-death: <a href=\"http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/210240-court-releases-justice-department-memo-justifying-drone-strike\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Justice Department released a memo</a> (again, no secrets here) that if a US citizen joins Al Qaeda and runs off someplace where it's not feasible to capture him, the president can have him killed with a drone strike. </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, Rav Ovadia and others feel that the President has enough power to warrant the blessing, but not the fancy robes and crown and other trappings. But that's a different question.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion: Unlawful power would not qualify, but many rabbis feel that the US President has sufficient non-secret power to warrant the blessing. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Since not everyone agrees with <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/55967/11501\">this other answer</a> here's a different view, from R <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Aviner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shlomo Aviner</a>'s book <a href=\"https://www.ateret.org.il/uploads/files/radio%20-%20ch%201-277.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">On the air</a> p. 45</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>The king must have the ability to administer capital punishment (Shut Chatam Sofer ibid.).

    "content": "# How does one \"add a year\" in the Hebrew calendar?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm trying to support the Hebrew calendar in my <a href=\"http://nodatime.org\">Noda Time</a> project, and need to support an operation of \"add a year\" - or more generally, answer the question of \"Given an original date and a target year number, what's the resulting date?\"</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I'd like to check that I'm correct in saying that Microsoft gets the answer wrong in .NET. For example, consider the date of this post: 8th of Sivan, 5774. Sivan is month 10 in the civil month numbering system in a leap year, and 5774 is a leap year. If we add one year to today's date, .NET keeps the month number (10) leaving us with 8th of Tamuz, 5775 - because 5775 is not a leap year. (Supporting code is at the bottom of this question<sup>1</sup>.) To me, this feels incorrect - it's the month itself that should be preserved, not the month <em>number</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming that my approach is correct (and that we should more reasonably end up with a month number of 9, which is Sivan in a non-leap year), that still leaves some edge cases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What should we do if we add a year to the 30th of Heshvan, and Heshvan only has 29 days in the resulting year?</li>\n<li>Similarly, what should we do if we add a year to the 30th of Kislev, and Kislev only has 29 days in the resulting year?</li>\n<li>What should we do if we add a year to a date in Adar I, resulting in a non-leap year?\n<ul>\n<li>Special case: what should we do if we add a year to the 30th of Adar I?</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>What should we do if we add a year to a date in Adar II, resulting in a non-leap year?</li>\n<li>What should we do if we add a year to a date in Adar, resulting in a leap year?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have a proposal:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you start with a date in Adar I or Adar II and the target year is not a leap year, the result should be in Adar</li>\n<li>If you start with a date in Adar and the target year is a leap year, the result should be in Adar II</li>\n<li>If the result would be longer than the month length in the target yet, truncate to the last day of the month (so 30th of Adar I would map to 29th of Adar, and the Heshvan/Kislev examples would both truncate to the 29th of the same month)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I believe this is close to but not <em>quite</em> the same as the birthday rule specified in Calendrical Calculations (<a href=\"http://www.hebcal.com/home/54/anniversaries-adar-cheshvan-kislev\">documented for Hebcal</a>), where 30th of (Adar I/Kislev/Heshvan) would be mapped to 1st of the next month... but so long as the above proposal is <em>reasonable</em> under Jewish tradition, it would be more consistent with other aspects of my code. (I'm happy to throw consistency out of the window if there's good cause, but I'd prefer to keep it otherwise.)</p>\n\n<p>One problematic aspect of all of this is that it <em>has</em> to be context-free. I'm aware that there may very well be different rules for different contexts, but I need to have a \"general purpose\" rule, unfortunately.</p>\n\n<p>So, is this a reasonable proposal, or do I still have a lot to learn about how to answer even simple questions about the Hebrew calendar?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> Reference .NET code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Globalization;\n\nclass Test\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        var calendar = new HebrewCalendar();\n        DateTime start = new DateTime(5774, 10, 8, calendar);\n        // Prints 5774-10-08\n        Console.WriteLine(FormatYearMonthDay(start, calendar));\n        DateTime end = calendar.AddYears(start, 1);\n        // Prints 5775-10-08\n        Console.WriteLine(FormatYearMonthDay(end, calendar));\n    }\n\n    static string FormatYearMonthDay(DateTime date, Calendar calendar)\n    {\n        return string.Format(\"{0}-{1}-{2}\",\n                             calendar.GetYear(date),\n                             calendar.GetMonth(date),\n                             calendar.GetDayOfMonth(date));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>You are correct that the .NET implementation is apparently not consistent with <em>Halacha</em> (i.e. Jewish law) (<em>Orach Chaim</em> 55:10 and <em>Mishne Berurah</em> ibid) and your first 2 rules are correct and consistent with <em>Halacha</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Jewish law (ibid, <em>MB</em> 45) calculations are correctly implemented in HebCal contrary to your third rule. Specifically, if a boy is born on 30 Cheshvan, 5700, his Bar Mitzvah, celebrated 13 years hence, will fall on 1 Kislev, 5713.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, if a boy is born on 1 Kislev, 5700 when Cheshvan had only 29 days, he will celebrate his Bar Mitzvah on 30 Cheshvan, 5713. Speculatively, perhaps HebCal omits this rule since it may be context-dependent on Bar Mitzvah, is a subject of debate (see <em>Shaarei Teshuva</em>, ibid), and also seems anomalous. See <a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/2013/1053/Purim_To_Go_-_5771_Rabbi_Willig.pdf\">here for the rationale of this ruling</a>  (page 11, top) .</p>\n\n<p>My guess is that users of Hebrew calendar calculations (like me !) will expect consistency with Jewish law  because that is likely why they are using the calendar in the first place.

    "content": "# Hallel and Pseukei DZimra\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the Talmud one who recites Hallel every day is a heretic. Then, why\nis OK to recite similar tehillim (146-150) as part of pseukei d'zimra? How are these\ndifferent from Hallel?</p>\n\n<p>Is the Talmud saying that the Tehillim which make up Hallel should not be said every day or is the Talmud saying that the blessing beracha kriah hallel should not be said every day? I could understand the latter but it would be difficult to understand why the particular tehillim in Hallel cannot be said every day while the tehillim in Pseukei Dzimra in contrast can be said every day.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The whole statement in the Talmud in context, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=118b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maseches Shabbos 118b</a>,  is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר יוסי יהא חלקי מגומרי הלל בכל יום איני והאמר מר הקורא הלל בכל יום הרי זה מחרף ומגדף כי קאמרינן בפסוקי דזמרא</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yosi says \"Let my portion be among those who complete Hallel every single day.\" This can't be, doesn't Master say \"One who reads Hallel every day - this is a [heretic]\" When we said [the first statement] it was referring to Pseukei d'Zimra.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi says the issue is that Hallel was specifically enacted at a specific time, and by saying it all the time one is turning it into a song, not a prayer. Contrasting that with Pesukei DeZimra which was established to be said every day, it doesn't have this issue.</p>\n<p>The Shiloh (towards the end of עניני תפילה וקריאה בספר תורה) brings Rashi, and also quotes Rabbeinu Yona who brings an opinion that the issue is saying the Bracha on Hallel, but Rabbeinu Yona rejects this by saying that the statement in the Talmud includes when a Bracha is not said and instead explains that Hallel is said so that no harm should befall the congregation by invoking the miracles of the Exodus. We say Hallel at times that remember when such events occurred. By saying it every day one is implying that Hashem does not perform daily miracles and one needs to invoke the miracles of the Exodus instead. Whereas Ashrei invokes the daily miracles and should be said every day - one who does is guaranteed a place in the world to come.</p>\n<p>The Shiloh then quotes the Yerushalmi which says that Hallel references idols of silver and gold. By saying it every day it is like mocking Hashem that He cannot get rid of them.</p>\n<p>The Shiloh then gives his own answer - Hallel is said at times when we remember the Exodus, and thus is appropriate when associated with the Exodus to commemorate the miracle (it is said on Rosh Chodesh because Rosh Chodesh establishes the day of the holidays). However, by saying it every day it would imply that there is something essential and defining about G-d in the miracles that he did with the Exodus, which violates the idea that G-d is פשוט תכלית הפשיטות - completely without form or definition.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Added to expand the point originally made by @Yishai</p>\n\n<p>Note the discussion in Maseches Eruchin 10b of Hallel on Rosh Chodesh (leaving out part of the Tehillim that make up the full Hallel) also brings up this issue. The Talmud (Ta'anit 28b) records that Rav was visiting Bavel and he saw the people reciting Hallel on Rosh Chodesh. Rav wanted to stop the congregation from reciting Hallel, but when he saw that they skipped verses (the so called \"half\" Hallel), he said it was ok because he realized that they were only reciting Hallel as a custom.</p>\n\n<p>We have similar questions brought up about saying Hallel (with or without a bracha (in tzibur or privately) on Yom Ha'atzmaut. However, the point is that Hallel is restricted to specific special occasions and should not be said at other times.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the gemoro about Rosh Chodesh, we see that it is about saying that entire set of tehillim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>the set up of hallel is very specifc. there is a bracha before and a brcha after which are specific to Hallel. Furthermore within hallel the tehillim are broken up in a way that is different from how they are in tehillim both in separation of some parts and repeating certain pasukim. if one were to say hallel on a day in which it isn't reuired then there would be a problem. Hoever, other ways in which tehillim are said such as pesuke dezimra in davening or just saying tehillim does not follow any of the specific formalities of hallel.</p>\n\n<p>that was the practical difference in what we are doing.however there is a deeper meaning behind what the gemera is trying to say. On the one hand everything that happens in essence is a miracle. however, we don't see it that way. We see the world as it happens according to the laws of nature which are not miraculus. The gemra is saying if we have an attitude of saying that the ordinary is out of the ordinary (when in fact we aren't able to see it this way) then we loose our appreciation for the miraculous and we start to devalue miracles and even G-d forbid come to say everything is equally miraculous as equal to everything being explained by another reason that isn't Hashem, Gd forbid.</p>\n\n\n",

The delay caused inconvenience to all the other waiting guests and really infuriated the hosts who had to pay overtime to the caterer and the musicians. This doesn't sound right to me.

(Morning weddings in the summer, night weddings in the winter, etc.) Now it's obviously nice to have a minyan because there will be a bunch of people in the same place who haven't davened. Also it is traditional for the groom to add the vidui to his shemoneh esreh.</p>\n\n<p>Your situation sounds more like a case of bad planning - my guess is whoever was planning the timing didn't consider davening, and the people who wanted to daven didn't consider the timing of the wedding.</p>\n\n\n",

Other times the masculine voice is used as in Shmot (Ex.) <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9896#v=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">35:2</a> \"...Anyone that does work on it\" (Heb. _ \"Bo\", which is masculine).<br>\nWhy does the Torah refer to Shabbat in both forms?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I had asked this question to a professor of Hebrew many years ago and he told me that the word שבת is female. The confusion arises because the Torah often refers to the <em>day</em> of שבת, which is male. Thus, 35:2 refers to the seventh day</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שֵׁשֶׁת יָמִים תֵּעָשֶׂה מְלָאכָה <strong>וּבַיּוֹם</strong> הַשְּׁבִיעִי יִהְיֶה לָכֶם\n  קֹדֶשׁ שַׁבַּת שַׁבָּתוֹן לַיהֹוָה כָּל הָעֹשֶׂה <strong>בוֹ</strong> מְלָאכָה יוּמָת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sometimes it isn't so clear though, as in כל שומר שבת מחללו (Yeshayahu 56:2), which he had claimed was also a reference to the day, to יום השבת. An online search has revealed that in two separate Hebrew forums, <a href=\"http://simania.co.il/forum.php?showNoteId=115089\">simania</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tapuz.co.il/forums2008/viewmsg.aspx?forumid=1072&messageid=118165840#118179457\">tapuz</a>, this is the explanation given. </p>\n\n<p>However, the Even-Shoshan Dictionary lists the noun as androgynous. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Much of the time in Tanakh, the masculine form is used in the context of Shabbat. This may be because the intent is to יום; (day).</p>\n\n<p>However, there is another possibility for the verse in question (Exodus 31:13)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאַתָּ֞ה דַּבֵּ֨ר אֶל־בְּנֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר אַ֥ךְ אֶת־שַׁבְּתֹתַ֖י תִּשְׁמֹ֑רוּ כִּי֩ א֨וֹת הִ֜וא בֵּינִ֤י וּבֵֽינֵיכֶם֙ לְדֹרֹ֣תֵיכֶ֔ם לָדַ֕עַת כִּ֛י אֲנִ֥י יְקֹוָ֖ק מְקַדִּשְׁכֶֽם </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that we are told to observe God's Sabbath's (plural) because <em>it</em> (singular) is a sign. (This anomaly is noted by the Alshikh and others).</p>\n\n<p>One possible explanation is that observance (שמירה) of the Sabbath is the sign. שמירה is feminine.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are similar verses which indicate that Shabbat itself is the sign:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְשָׁמְר֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל אֶת־הַשַּׁבָּ֑ת לַעֲשׂ֧וֹת אֶת־הַשַּׁבָּ֛ת לְדֹרֹתָ֖ם בְּרִ֥ית עוֹלָֽם:\n  (יז) בֵּינִ֗י וּבֵין֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל א֥וֹת הִ֖וא לְעֹלָ֑ם </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In which it is pretty clear that הוא (feminine given the niqqud) refers to the Sabbath, not its observance.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, there are other cases in which it is treated as feminine e.g. Exodus 31:14, and Leviticus 23:3.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, one could either say that שנת is always feminine, and is only treated as masculine when the reference is to יום, or one could say that the noun is androgynous.</p>\n\n<p>One argument in favor of the latter explanation is that Leviticus 23:3 mentions the word יום, net nevertheless retains the feminine usage.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פרשת אמור \n  שֵׁ֣שֶׁת יָמִים֘ תֵּעָשֶׂ֣ה מְלָאכָה֒ וּבַיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֗י שַׁבַּ֤ת שַׁבָּתוֹן֙ מִקְרָא־קֹ֔דֶשׁ כָּל־מְלָאכָ֖ה לֹ֣א תַעֲשׂ֑וּ שַׁבָּ֥ת הִוא֙ לַֽיקֹוָ֔ק בְּכֹ֖ל מֽוֹשְׁבֹתֵיכֶֽם </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Once the guest has been told which aliyah he is getting, why is he called up by name? He knows he is getting the aliyah.</p>\n\n<p>At first, I thought it might have developed from situations where the person getting the aliyah doesn't know he will be called up -- the Shulchan Aruch speaks of a situation where a person is called up but cannot take the aliyah because he is still catching up in his davening or isn't there (Orach Chaim 135:11, Be'er Heitev 19) and he wouldn't walk out or start davening if he knew he was to be called up.</p>\n\n<p>But this can't be the case because the Shulchan Aruch speaks of situations where the person called up is doing the laining himself and is required to have practiced it before hand, so he must know he is to be called up and the name is unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p>Then I read about situations where the person called up is not called up by name (141:6) so there must be something significant about the mentioning of a name. As far as I could find, the only mention of the practice is in the Ramo who says on Orach Chaim (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.139.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">139:3</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אפילו ראש הכנסת או חזן לא יקרא עד שיאמרו לו קרא ונהגו ששליח ציבור\n  כשרוצה מברך וקורא בלי נטילת רשות משום דהוי כאילו משעה שמינוהו לשליח\n  ציבור הרשוהו על כך.</p>\n  \n  <p>הגה: ובמדינות אלו אין נוהגין כן ואין החזן עולה רק כשהסגן אומר לו לעלות\n  אבל אין קורין לו בשמו <strong>כמו שאר העולים שקוראים אותם בשמם פלוני בר\n  פלוני</strong> ומי שאביו מומר לעבודת כוכבים קורין אותו בשם אבי אביו אבל לא\n  בשמו לבד שלא לביישו ברבים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to take for granted that we usually call someone up by name but I don't know what the source is for that idea or the rationale behind it.

    "content": "# Learning Kabbalah & Yeshiva World\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What are the principles for learning kabbalah in Ashkenaz Yeshiva world (Litvish/Yeshivish, non-hasidim)?</p>\n\n<p>I understand that Yeshiva bochurim do not learn kabbalah: in Yeshiva they concentrate solely on Gemara, Halacha and Musar. </p>\n\n<p>Do Kollel students learn Zohar or other kabbalah texts? </p>\n\n<p>Who is seen as a person fit to learn kabbalah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Yeshivish world definitely learns kabbalah — it just depends on how you define kabbalah. Zohar? Perhaps not. But the idea that \"Zohar=kabbalah\" is quite misconceived. Indeed, I know that quite a lot of the Yeshivish world learns the Nefesh HaChaim, which is quite a kabbalistic sefer. While they may not go too deep into the more esoteric ideas — and certainly do use it as a mussar platform — even just reading the basic text is quite kabbalistic and mystical. There are other books that are rather kabbalistic in nature that are widely read by the Yeshivish world like Derech Hashem, some of the Kuzari, as well as much of the Ramban's peirush on the Chumash, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>As to why many people tend to stay away from the Zohar? There are a number of reasons, not all of which is this the proper place for. But in short, it is deeply esoteric, very difficult to learn, hard to understand (properly, or even at all), and is known to have some sections that are forgeries. Thus, if you're going to learn the Zohar at all, it is much wiser, unless you are a true scholar (and I mean that in the greatest sense of those words) to do it through, say, the Vilna Gaon, or the Arizal (who both wrote commentaries on the Zohar).</p>\n\n\n",

One does, however, upon seeing the Temple ruins.</p>\n<p>While R’ Moshe Sternbuch writes (Teshuvos Vehanhagos 1:331) that one tears upon seeing the Dome of the Rock, others (Baer Heitev 561:5) write that it is ideal to view the Har Habayis itself.

This is a mistake. It is actually \"the accuser\" or the \"yeitzer harah\". Thus, it can be considered that a person is confronted by all the various situations and problems in the world is confronted by the \"Satan\". It is the commonly accepted view that \"satan\" is no more than any other mal'ach assigned to a role in the world. It can be a natural event, a person, a set of desires in a human being, or a supernatural entity created to perform a task. The idea of \"rebellion\" is impossible as only humans have free will and can choose to go against Hashem. The idea of an \"evil\" independent entity is Zoroastrian (dual \"gods\" good and evil) or Christian (an \"angel\" that rebelled and acts on its own) not Jewish or Muslim (the Jinn are created bings [like angels?] who rebelled]. The same concept may exist in other religions, but I do not know about them. \"Satanism\" appears to be Christianity with the worshipers choosing to follow the \"bad guy\".</p>\n\n<p>Consider Avraham and Yitzchak on the way to the Akeidah in which he is confronted by \"satan\" to give all the arguments that might lead him to turn back. This can be a metaphor for all the thoughts that a human being confronted with this trial could use to rationalize not doing it. At the end he appears as a river. This is a metaphor for a human being saying \"I tried, but it was impossible to reach the mountain\".</p>\n\n<p>Since Human beings have free will, Hashem can confront us with a situation at times that requires us to make a choice. Rabbi Dessler points out that everyone has a \"nekudas bechirah\" (a point of choice). That is certain events will never challenge us since we will not think of doing them. Some mitzvos do not reward us since we will never think of not doing them. Only those cases where we actually have to think about it and make a conscious decision are actually elements of our \"Bechiras Chofshis\" (free choice).</p>\n\n<p>A person who has kept kosher all of his life, would not be tempted to go eat in a McDonalds. A mugger may pass the \"test\" of not killing his victim. At each test, the pivot point changes as a result of the actions of the person. Eventually those points which are tests for a person will either be done or avoided automatically and a new set of tests confronted.</p>\n\n<p>One rationalization that people often use is \"It's not my fault, I was prevented from doing the right thing by an outside force\".</p>\n\n<p>I do not have sources here to quote, so I am just putting in what I have learned over the years.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Judaism does not view the word “Satan” with the same connotation as other religions. Satan in Judaism is not a physical being, ruling the underworld or hell. Rather, in the Torah, the word Satan indicates “accuser,” “hinderer,” or “tempter.” Satan is more an obstacle in one’s way, such as temptation and evil doings, keeping them from completing the responsibilities of tikkun olam (fixing the world). Satan is our evil inclination to veer off the path of righteousness and faithfulness in G-d.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Satan is not a seperate entity outside of G-d. From Wikipedia:</p>\n\n<p>In Judaism, Satan is a term used since its earliest biblical contexts, to refer to a human opponent.[22] Occasionally, the term has been used to suggest evil influence opposing human beings as in the Jewish exegesis of the Yetzer hara (\"evil inclination\" Genesis 6:5). Micaiah's \"lying spirit\" in 1 Kings 22:22 is sometimes related. Thus, Satan is personified as a character in three different places of the Tenakh, serving as an accuser (Zechariah 3:1-2), a seducer (1 Chronicles 21:1), or as a heavenly persecutor who is \"among the sons of God\" (Job 2:1). In any case, Satan is always subordinate to the power of God, having a role in the divine plan. Satan is rarely mentioned in Tannaitic literature, but is found in Babylonian aggadah.[16]\nIn Medieval Judaism, the Rabbis rejected these Enochic literary works into the Biblical canon, making every attempt to root them out.[15] Traditionalists and philosophers in medieval Judaism, adhered to rational theology, rejecting any belief in rebel or fallen angels, and viewing evil as abstract.[23] The Yetzer hara (\"evil inclination\" Genesis 6:5) is a more common motif for evil in rabbinical texts. Rabbinical scholarship on the Book of Job generally follows the Talmud and Maimonides as identifying the \"Adversary\" in the prologue of Job as a metaphor.[24]</p>\n\n\n",

The 'sea' refers to the ocean that\n  encompasses the entire earth\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see here that Chazal (as well as the Romans, as they were discussing Roman idols) had the knowledge that the world was round.  </p>\n\n<p>Without getting into claims of the veracity of the Zohar’s claimed authorship. The accepted traditional understanding is that it was authored by Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, who lived during the Tannaic period. Supposedly the Zohar makes the statement that the world is round (Though i have attempted to look for this source and have not been successful in locating it)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The fact that the earth was a sphere was well known to the Greeks (~2200 years ago), and therefore it would not be surprising that the authors of the Talmud (~1500 years ago) knew about this as well.</p>\n\n<p>However, it seems that the rabbis in the Talmud did not ascribe to this view. They claimed that the earth is flat, covered by a dome, and that the sun went above the dome at night as mentioned some times in the Talmud, in Baba Batra 25b for instance:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבי יהושע אומר עולם לקובה הוא דומה ורוח צפונית מסובבת וכיון שחמה מגעת לקרן מערבית צפונית מקפת וחוזרת אחורי כיפה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This dome was perceived as having a window in which the sun goes through at dusk / dawn, as the targum on Kohelet states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אזיל כל סטר דרומא ביממא ומחזר לסטר ציפונא בליליא אורח תהומא מחזר מחזר ואזיל לרוח עיבר דרומא בתקופת ניסן ותמוז ועל סחרנוהי תיב לרוח עיבר ציפונא בתקופת תשרי וטבת נפיק מחרכי מדינחא בצפרא ואעיל לחרכי מערבא בשמשא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This idea even made it's way into the modern day prayer book:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הפותח בכל יום דלתות שערי מזרח ובוקע חלוני רקיע מוציא חמה ממקומה ולבנה ממכון שבתה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, the proof you are looking for does not really exist, since the rabbis of the talmud explicitly dismissed the Greek model. The fact that subsequent generations of rabbis interpreted the Talmud to refer to a spherical earth as in the answer above, does not actually say anything about the view of the rabbis themselves, which as shown, did not support a spherical earth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Just found that Natan Slifkin has written quite a long piece on the subject, bringing many additional sources to support the claim made in this answer: <a href=\"http://www.zootorah.com/RationalistJudaism/TheSunsPathAtNight.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Sun's Path At Night</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

The other tribes insisted that because this was <strong>similar</strong> to what happened in S'dom, it had to be handled by the unified batei din of all the tribes (or a national Sanhedrin). Note that the incident itself was <strong>not</strong> the same as the incident of S'dom since only a few evil people acted in this way. The tribes were also punished for overreacting in this way by losing the first battles.</p>\n\n<p>IIRC the actual problem was the disunity among the tribes and that \"each man acted as seemed best in his eyes\" (paraphrase). It was this disunity, which was like what led to the sale of Yosef, which led to the punishment. </p>\n\n<p>As @AKayser points out, Binyomin had not been involved in the sale of Yosef, but we see that the same flaw that existed then existed now. Perhaps it is like Yosef bringing \"dibasam ra\" to his father.</p>\n\n<p>We should also note, that the flaw may have been one that we do not fully notice and would not have been accounted a fault in Binyamin himself. From the way I read the story, it was the flaw in Bnei Yisrael that led to the end of the era of the Shoftim and the necessity for a melech. As a result, the particular case was the final straw in exhibiting that fault. Consider that right after getting the Torah, Bnei Yisrael were besieging Moshe with court cases. This tendency eventually led to the civil war.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Benjamin was the youngest of Jacob's sons.  The baby of the family either gets spoiled as a darling or a show-off, or has a lot to prove and measure up to, being the last of the children. He also lost his mother at childbirth (a blow). I don't have the numbers in front of me, but wasn't Benjamin the smallest or smaller of the tribes in numbers as well as they had a smaller plot of land?\nPerhaps sometimes the tribe of Benjaminites had to fight for what they wanted.  So here came the big problem when a few men within the boundaries of Benjamin, gang-raped a man's concubine.  The people of Benjamin didn't want to bring the perpetrator to justice when all the other tribes were breathing down their throat, they'd rather fight their way out to prove a point of demanding some respect for their own affairs (-?-).  Most of the men were decimated by that national fiasco, but 600 of the Benjaminite men got to marry young women from the other tribes.</p>\n<p>To their credit, in the last days I do believe that Benjamin is a bridge between the  tribes of Judah (and his brethren), and Ephraim (and his brethren)...just as their geography was:  Sandwiched between Judah and Ephraim in the tribal lands.  The Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs indicated that Benjamin's descendants will have developed charity (charitable acts and compassion) for others.  Perhaps that was borne out of suffering (Ben-Oni, his first name given by his dying mother).</p>\n\n\n",

The truth is it a disaster to the world. It gives a false sense of \"freedom\" which while in fact it is just anarchy, nothing more. . . Democracy is something non-kosher, and their whole intention is to uproot to the path of the people of Israel and destroy it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On p. 127 he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואנו תפילה להרבונו של עולם, אנא פטור אותנו מקללת הדמוקרטיה החדשה שנשלחה לעולם, שהיא ממש כמו מחלת הסרטן שנשלחה לעולם. כי רק התורה הקדושה היא הדמוקרטיה האמיתית.</p>\n<p>And we pray to the Creator of the world, please rid us of the curse of the new democracy that was sent into the world, which is just like cancer which has been sent to the world.

However, Marx expressed this as the state determining what is \"ability\" and what is \"need\" as well as forcing everyone to follow that determination. The Torah would use this as everyone recognizing that he has a responsibility to Hashem to share what Hashem has given him. However, one is forbidden to to waste it. There are stories of people who are castigated for giving away too much. In each case, one must look at the individual case and the level of kedusha that a person is on.</p>\n\n<p>A regular person would not be expected to give away as much as Mitt Romney.

It just gives guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam says</p>\n\n<p>5% is a rasha <br/>\n10% is a bainoni (or regular person).<br/>\n20% is a tzadik</p>\n\n<p>More than that is a fool.</p>\n\n<p>I do not have the quote, but that is how I remember it and there are cases where the over twenty per cent part does not apply. For example, the Talmud speaks of King Munbaz who gave away much of his treasury. A very rich person who will not cause himself or his family hardship can give more. (Rambam, Matanos Aniyim 7:5; Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 250:4; Ahavas Chesed 2:19)</p>\n\n<p>In any case, the point is that one follows the guidelines of the Torah and not the ideas of Communism which would make everyone \"equal\" by making them all poverty stricken.</p>\n\n\n",

R. Avraham Danzig (1748-1820), Chayei Adam\n  25:9, discusses a case of someone who realizes that he has a halachic\n  question regarding a mistake he made in his recitation of the Amidah. \n  He rules that one may certainly walk to another place in the middle of\n  his Amidah in order to find the answer to his question in a book.  He\n  suggests that one may also ask a rabbi a question in the middle of his\n  Amidah.  Mishna Berurah 104:2, codifies the opinion of Chayei Adam.</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Moshe Feinstein (1896-1985), Igrot Moshe, Orach Chaim 4:16,\n  discusses the case of someone who hears his neighbor make a mistake in\n  the Amidah.  He writes that if one is between berachot, one may tell\n  the neighbor that he erred in his prayer, even if the mistake would\n  not invalidate the Amidah.  However, one should not speak in the\n  middle of an individual beracha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://gt.torah.org/advanced/mishna-berura/S104.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siman 104 .

This is what is written in Tefillah Kehilchatah 12:86, in the\n  name of Rav Elyashiv. He adds that even if there is a knock at the\n  door which is distracting him so much that he cannot continue praying\n  with kavanah, he is permitted to open the door and hint to the person\n  that he cannot talk right now. As for the matter of perusing through a\n  book to determine the halachah, Yalkut Yosef 104:5 writes that\n  although there are poskim who forbid walking to look something up, he\n  himself agrees that it is permissible, but that asking a rabbi is\n  forbidden. Nevertheless, it seems that if this law will determine\n  whether or not he fulfills his obligation, it is best that he ask, as\n  the Mishnah Berurah states. If possible, it is best that he writes his\n  question down on a piece of paper, instead of interrupting with words.\n  If, in the meantime, enough time passed in which he could have recited\n  the entire Amidah, according to the Shulchan Aruch 104:5, he must\n  start it from the beginning. However, the Rama maintains that he only\n  goes back to the beginning when the interruption is due to\n  circumstances beyond his control.</p>\n  \n  <p>If one arrives at Al HaNisim during Chanukah or Purim and he does not\n  remember the words, he is permitted to walk to get a siddur in order\n  to recite it, despite the fact that failing to recite it does not\n  prevent him from fulfilling his obligation of reciting the Amidah. If\n  possible, it is better that he hints to someone to bring him a siddur.\n  It seems that it is forbidden to walk in order to verify a law that\n  for certain does not prevent someone from fulfilling his obligation,\n  since the study of the halachah distracts one’s thoughts from his\n  prayer, and that constitutes more of an interruption. Therefore, as\n  long as it is clear that it is not a matter that prevents him from\n  fulfilling his obligation, he may not look it up. So writes the Beit\n  Baruch 25:22.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But if it is ok to have a non-Jew make one for you, or today have the heating pre-programmed, it seems that the observance of the law is more important than the spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Is the intention of the law in Judaism fundamentally different from the other two religions? Or is it just a tradition that has grown up over the generations?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>The \"Letter of the Law\" is binding.  However, we do generally try to go beyond and satisfy a \"Spirit of the Law\" which is above the Letter of the Law. Therefore, loopholes which contravene the Spirit of the Law are not generally encouraged, and the topic of what is called הערמה, tricking your way around the law, is somewhat complex but generally discouraged.</p>\n\n<p>However, this necessitates understanding <em>what</em> the \"Spirit of the Law\" is in a given situation.  In your example, were the \"Spirit\" of Shabbos to make Shabbos a day of asceticism or suffering, you would be correct that we are circumventing the intention of the laws.  However, the point of Shabbos is to not be an active participant in creative activity (as explained by R' S.R. Hirsch in Horeb).  Therefore, riding a Shabbos elevator, which does not involve doing any creative activity on Shabbos, as it is pre-programmed, is completely removed from the spirit of the day.</p>\n\n<p>Eruv was already discussed in other answers, but it is a built-in exception to a Rabbinically decreed prohibition, and therefore is hard to call a \"loophole\" - it is an exception to a stringency, not a loophole to the essential law. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>What you are discussing are not <code>loopholes</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If a person uses a wheelchair to get around, you don't say he's using a <code>loophole</code>.

This is not a <code>loophole</code> but is defined by the same Torah that forbids carrying in a Public Domain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shabbat Elevators</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Torah forbids closing/opening electrical circuits on Shabbat. This makes it impossible to use an elevator: Thus, you cannot press the buttons, you cannot cause the door to stay open and you cannot cause any other electric circuit to kick-in, like weight sensors.</p>\n\n<p>A Shabbat elevator operates without having any of the above issues - so why should it be prohibited? It's not all that different from using a time clock to turn lights on and off; a very common thing to find in Shabbat-observant houses.</p>\n\n<p>(And yes, I am aware of those who forbid using Shabbat elevators, time clocks and even the Eruv. But not because they argue with the above concept.)</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: We're not declaring a beaver to be a fish; we're discovering fish that taste like beavers.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Regarding Shabbat observance specifically, the idea is not to be a sacrifice, rather there is a specific concept of <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%92_%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Oneg Shabbat</a>, doing things which are pleasurable on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the general point, in traditional Judaism, the law is the point.

The human community depicted in Genesis 1 is a utilitarian one, where man and woman join together, like the male and female of other animals, to further the ends of their species.</p>\n<p>In chapter two of Genesis, Adam II, on the other hand represents the lonely man of faith – bringing a \"redemptive interpretation to the meaning of existence\". Adam II does not subdue the garden, but rather tills it and preserves it. This type of human being is introduced by the words, \"It is not good for man to be alone\" – and through his sacrifice (of a metaphoric rib) he gains companionship and the relief of his existential loneliness – this covenantal community requires the participation of the Divine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Whatever specific explanation is given for the duality (this is only one among many) the point is that the two accounts give two different perspectives, whether general vs. specific (Rashi) or otherwise, on the whole idea of creation and the Human place and role within it.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Actually, they do not report it \"differently\" in the sense of there being two different stories that contradict each other. As explained by Rabbi Shimshon Rafael Hirsch, or Rabbi Aryeh Levin and others, Genesis one is the description of the creation from the beginning to the end. Genesis 2 starts (paraphrase), When G0d created the universe (as described before), everything was set up. Here are the details of the creation of Adam and what happened immediately after.</p>\n\n<p>It is the same story, but the concentration is on a different set of details. It is like saying \"During the sixth day, Adam was created in this specific manner. The following events involving Adam then occurred.\".</p>\n\n<p>Note that the start of the \"second story\" is Bereishis 2:4. The Xian division into \"chapters\" is mistaken. As Rabbi Shimshon Rafael Hirsch points out, \"Aileh\" means \"These\" which points back to what is already said and means expanding on what was said, here are the \"products\" of what was created (as we described earlier). Now once the world had been created, the important part of the Universe and the part that we need to concentrate on is Adam ...</p>\n\n<p>Later we see that the Torah shows what happened to the world until we get to Noah and the flood. We then follow the descendants of Noah until we get to Avraham. We do not give details of the rest of the world, because that is not what the Torah wants to tell us. A book of American history will not say what is going on in China except as it pertains to the particular part of the history that a specific chapter is dealing with. We do not say that the chapter is pretending that China does not exist.</p>\n\n\n",

Since the year was being counted with Nisan as month 1, then month 1 of year 2 was the first Pesach that was being held in the desert. That is, \"in the second year\" is the quote.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Lord spoke to Moses in the Sinai Desert, in the second year of their exodus from the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying: </p>\n\n<pre><code>א. וַיְדַבֵּר יְהֹוָה אֶל משֶׁה בְמִדְבַּר סִינַי בַּשָּׁנָה הַשֵּׁנִית לְצֵאתָם מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם בַּחֹדֶשׁ הָרִאשׁוֹן לֵאמֹר:\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>The children of Israel shall make the Passover sacrifice in its appointed time. </p>\n\n<pre><code>ב. וְיַעֲשׂוּ בְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶת הַפָּסַח בְּמוֹעֲדוֹ:\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/470865/jewish/Pesach-Sheni.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pesach Sheni</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A year after the Exodus, G‑d instructed the people of Israel to bring the Passover offering on the afternoon of the fourteenth of Nissan, and to eat it that evening, roasted over the fire, together with matzah and bitter herbs, as they had done the previous year just before they left Egypt. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the mishkan had just been set up (Shmini had just occured on rosh chodesh Nisan), Aharon had to set up the Para Aduma first. Thus, people who were tamei mais would not have had the chance to <strong>complete</strong> becoming tahor. Since Aharon had not yet been installed as kohen gadol until then, he could not have prepared the parah adumah earlier, even if the commandments of parah adumah had been given as early as Mara (or at least at Har Sinai).</p>\n\n<p>The meforshim say that they were people who had completed the course of becoming tahor, and were just waiting until the sun set. The question involved if they could join a chaburah that had fully tahor people in it. The tahor people would bring the korbon and they (having become fully tahor after the sun set) would join the (pre-arranged) group after sun set to eat. </p>\n\n<p>The ruling was that they could not do this and had to wait for Pesach Sheni. It all depended on their status as of the time of the shechitah.</p>\n\n<p>This is also why some say that the people were those who carried out Nadav and Avihu. They had become Tamei on Rosh Chodesh Nisan, and would have required 7 days to become tahor. However, they had to wait until the parah adumah became available for the sprinkling.</p>\n\n<p>As far as everyone bringing the korban Pesach in the first year, the meforshim said that no one died from the makos (aside from those buried during the plague of darkness). As a result, even had the laws of tumah been established (which they had not been), everyone would have become tahor already (since the parah adumah had not yet been commanded). Since the blood of the korbon Pesach was what saved the Bnei Yisrael from the final plague, everyone had to be eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Either the laws of tum'as meis did not yet apply or they had some method from the avos for becoming tahor. The torah does not specify since we do not need to know the details.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do multiple hechsherim (kosher symbols) on a product make its kashrut less reliable?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A former rebbe whom I highly respect advised me not to eat any food product that has more than one kosher certification on it. His thinking was that in principle, the concepts of kashrut and <em>achdut</em> - unity or community - must go together. In other words, certifying a product as being kosher is a form of allowing a community, i.e., the consumer, the halachic \"permission\" to eat the product.</p>\n<p>His claim is that if there is more than one mashgiach (supervision) on a product, either the 1st mashgiach wasn't competent enough or \"certain\" of the kashrut, so he had to ask a second person (or 3rd), or that even if the 1st mashgiach completed the kashrut job and said something was kosher, some other mashgiach didn't sufficiently trust the 1st person, for whatever reason, and had to supervise it himself.</p>\n<p>He also claims, that in terms of the consumer, the multiple certifications would make a \"novice\" consumer (by \"novice\" I mean someone who is just looking for a kosher product and doesn't understand the politics or other reasons involved behind the kashrut process) question what's going on. Additionally, the rebbe claims that it may be a form of Chillul Hashem, esp. to non-Jews who may conclude the same thing - that Jews can't agree.</p>\n<p>Now, I'm confused, myself, here. I attend weddings where the almost all of the desserts come from Chantilly, who make delicious pastries (so many people tell me that, and they look gorgeous), but because Chantilly's products have 4 or 5 kosher symbols, I can't enjoy the Viennese table.</p>\n<p>Is there any validity to my rebbe's claims? Does having multiple symbols weaken the reliability of the kashrut of that item?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>As one who has a brother in the bakery business who has 4 certifications on his products I dispute this claim. My brother has 4 different certifications in order to appeal to different communities. There are those that only eat specific certifications and will not eat your product unless it is certified by a Rabbi that they feel comfortable with. (Correct: it is a folly, as all certifications rely on others in many instances.) Every one of the certifications my brother has, all come by to check, and all have specific criteria. It is not a lack of trust between the Kashrus organizations, it is a lack of similar criteria that requires them all to make sure that the bakery is Kosher according to their standards. This enhances the Kashrus as it requires the bakery to keep all the stringencies of all the certifications. </p>\n\n<p>Having said what I said, it is a shame that this is necessary. It would be nice if each area had 1 certification standard. However unfortunately there are many different groups in Klal Yisrael and in an area where there live many different types it is quiet impossible to have only 1 certification. How many towns have only 1 Shul? How many towns have only 1 school? And yes those perhaps have only 1 Kashrus organization. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Hallachicly there is nothing that makes an issue out of eating the food when the item has multiple certifications, whatever the motivation or propriety of doing so (and I think Gershon Gold is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/40227/440\">spot on</a> about the manufacturer's motivation in having them).</p>\n\n<p>That being said, in terms of the application of the general hashkafic point, almost any meat you are buying in an area that Chantilly services has two certifications - the OU plus something else. Your Rebbe may say that you are buying from a specific meat store that has only one certification. By that same reasoning, the Viennese table is under the single certification that the entire event is under.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I would point out that it is highly unlikely that all of the ingredients used by the caterer have single certifications only. You just aren't aware of it.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, if your rebbe told you this, you should really go back and ask him, rather than seek permission from other sources.</p>\n\n\n",

One of the reasons is that even an ani who gets tzedaka is required to give ma'aser from that tzedakah. I keep a virtual quicken account to keep track of ma'aser and add 10% of income to this virtual ledger. Whenever I give tzedakah, I subtract the amount of the tzedakah from the virtual ledger. Since it is a \"dummy\" account for bookkeeping only, I do not have to worry about going negative or only giving tzedakah from a particular check book. I zero out the ledger at the end of each year (if the balance is below zero).  As a result, I would add 10% whenever I received credit from the scholarship fund. I do not have a source for doing this, but it feels as if it would be the correct thing to do. </p>\n\n<p>I also found this</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pidyon.com/all-about-maaser/maaser-and-unemployment-insurance.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maaser and Unemployment Insurance</a></p>\n\n<p>Thursday, 11 May 2006 Rabbi Dovid Bendory</p>\n\n<p>Ask the Rabbi...<br>\nI am currently out of work and receiving unemployment insurance.\nIs this income maaser-free or do I need to pay maaser on it?</p>\n\n<p>There is no such thing as \"maaser-free income\" — we owe maaser on ordinary income, interest, and gifts — even on tax-free interest. Even a poor person who survives on donated tzedaka — in other words, all of whose income comes from money that itself has been given as maaser — is required to give maaser on the tzedaka he receives.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to your unemployment insurance, there are different kinds, some of which are taxable and some of which are not. I am very much inclined to say dina d'malchuta dina — we follow the law of the land — and thus if your unemployment insurance is taxable income then it is subject to maaser.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, there are several potential leniencies available to you.</p>\n\n<p>What is your \"normal\" maaser period for maaser calculation? I advocate an annual calculation because it is easy to do with one's tax return, but not everyone would agree to this. A much stronger argument can be made to calculate maaser annually on Rosh HaShannah rather than based on the tax year. Even better, some calculate monthly, weekly, or even daily — never letting the day pass without giving away maaser on the money earned that day.</p>\n\n<p>Now, since I normally calculate annually, if chas v'shalom I am unemployed do I immediately need to tithe my unemployment insurance on receipt? No — I can wait until the year end with the hope that before then I will have a job with greater income again. Thus I accumulate a maaser defecit that I owe and will make up before my calculation period closes.</p>\n\n<p>But if I normally calculate monthly, weekly, or daily, then it would much more of a leniency to move to an annual calculation just for the purpose of delaying my maaser obligation. I would be stricter with regard to such a change of my established practice.</p>\n\n<p>Note that if you truly cannot afford to give away your maaser, you can give maaser to yourself. That is, you can fall into the category of a person who is eligible to receive maaser and discharge your maaser obligation by supporting yourself. The best way to do this is to find another person in a similar situation and give your maaser to him or her and that other person can give his or her maas er to you. Note that you should not do this as an exchange but rather as a gift one to the other, and also note that the gift received is income subject to maaser.</p>\n\n<p>I would actually advocate a combination of these approaches. Set up a separate account — either an actual bank account or a piggy bank at home — and deposit your maaser obligation there. When you deposit it, have the following intention in mind:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I hereby separate this money for maaser. Should I — G-d forbid! —\n  become impoverished such that I need this money, I will be eligible to\n  receive this maaser as a loan to myself which I will repay when Hashem\n  provides me with the means to do so. After repaying the loan, the\n  money repaid will either be kept in a loan fund for others I encounter\n  in such a situation or will be given away to an appropriate charity.\n  Should I — please G-d! — return to work without ever needing this\n  money, I will then give this money to an appropriate charity. May it\n  be Your Will, Hashem, that by the merit of my separating this maaser,\n  I soon find an appropriate means of supporting myself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no need to actually verbally declare this, though doing so will both make it a firm commitment that you will have to keep according to Torah Law and make it a personal prayer. You may want to add a Psalm or two if you decide to go that route.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this is helpful. It is clear from your correspondance with me that you take maaser seriously, and that itself is of tremendous spiritual merit for you. May Hashem soon reestablish your means of supporting yourself.</p>\n\n<p>See also:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.maasser.com/en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maaser Calculator</a> — to compute your maaser obligation!<br>\n<a href=\"http://ccs.infospace.com/ClickHandler.ashx?encp=ld%3d20180412%26app%3d1%26c%3dpchportalpcv2%26s%3dpchportalpcv2%26rc%3dpchportalpcv2%26dc%3d%26euip%3d71.179.212.30%26pvaid%3d57339793f0aa42b7a9a0c0e71443f715%26dt%3dDesktop%26fct.uid%3d99a958fdb2764ac79972d6173fd2f809%26en%3dQVexxxLd%252fLl4W6un1n3B0pWw8%252fAhJokTRFIvOvvS25PVuSM6WWaTNd2m3T9iHgE%252bEyE2X97%252fwT66fX8qO%252f8BxA%253d%253d%26coi%3d1494%26npp%3d1%26p%3d0%26pp%3d0%26mid%3d9%26ep%3d1%26ru%3dhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.donpickneyministries.org%252fimages%252fThe_Tithe-Computing_Maaser.doc%26du%3dwww.donpickneyministries.org%252fimages%252fThe_Tithe-Computing_Maaser.doc%26pct%3dhttp%253a%252f%252fsct.pch.com%252fimages%252f__kl.gif%253fun%253db02f3ac1-a606-4926-9349-6cab7c6338a3%2526uid%253d%2526mobility%253ddesktop%2526searchID%253d1523491700824%26hash%3d14B498002ECE43BF24E93498FCC5A2AC&ap=2&cop=main-title&om_userid=ujUnkZqvtigXYucN8UeX&om_sessionid=AXOd5T3yRV47hjIIfOFS&om_pageid=dCsprj2Z30UceohwYlBL\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Computing Maaser - How much tzedakah (charity) do I owe</a> - How much charity should I give?</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Giving a lulav on condition to return, but in a chain where the last person keeps it",
    "content": "# Giving a lulav on condition to return, but in a chain where the last person keeps it\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gemara in Sukkah on daf :מא</a> relates a story of Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria, and Rabbi Akiva riding on a boat. The time came to shake lulav, but only Rabban Gamliel had a lulav.  Since it is required to shake one's own lulav on the first day of Sukkot, Rabban Gamilel gave his lulav as a gift to Rabbi Yehoshua. After being yotzei, Rabbi Yehoshua gave the lulav as a gift to Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria who gave it as a gift to Rabbi Akiva who subsequently returned it as a gift back to Rabban Gamliel.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara explains that the reason it was required to say in the story that Rabbi Akiva returned the lulav to Rabban Gamliel was to teach that a gift given on the condition that it will be re-gifted back to the original owner is considered a gift.</p>\n\n<p>Further down on the page, we also learn that if someone gives a lulav as a gift on the condition that it will be returned, and the person does not return it, the receiver is not yotzei the mitzvah of lulav because he used a stolen lulav.</p>\n\n<p>Tosfot explains that Rabban Gamliel actually gave the lulav on condition that it would be returned after <em>all</em> of the others on the boat had been yotzei.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is as follows: What if Rabbi Akiva had decided to keep the lulav at the end and not return it to Rabban Gamliel? Would Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria be yotzei lulav? They did not personally steal the lulav, so I could definitely believe that if a person steals a gifted lulav, then the retroactiveness of the theft only goes back to when the person acquired the lulav. If others had it before him, since they didn't steal it, they could be yotzei. However, the gift was only given on the condition that it would be returned, which it was not, so perhaps the gift is considered to never have taken effect.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01043.html#%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9FB%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%A0%D7%97B-B%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99B%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%91B%D7%91%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9DB%D7%98%D7%95%D7%91B%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9F.B%D7%95%D7%91%D7%95B%D7%98%27B%D7%A1%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%9D%3a-%D7%94.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 658:5)</a> rules explicitly that only if the last person returns the esrog is the first one (and all others) yotzei.</p>\n\n<p>Interesting sidebar: The Biur Halacha is in doubt whether they were yotzei only if the last user returned the esrog on his own volition to the original owner or even if the original owner had to demand it back from the last user because it wasn't returned on its own.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The condition would not have been fulfilled, so the gift would have been retroactively invalid, so no one (other than Rabban Gamliel) would have been allowed to use the lulav, so no one would have been <em>yotzei</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

In <em>Sefer haZekhus</em>, a reply to Ravad III's questions on Rif, Ramban speaks of Ravad III with awe.</p>\n<p>When Razah published <em>Sefer haMaor</em> with its refutation of Rif's decisions, Ravad III attacked him in very sharp terms. While making clear that he bore Razah no personal malice, Ravad III claimed that much of the better material in haMaor was misappropriated from what Razah had heard directly from Ravad III (<em>Divrei Rivos</em>)</p>\n<p>... Ravad III harshly criticized <em>Mishneh Torah</em> mainly because Rambam did not follow the practice of previous codifiers, who listed their sources in order to show clearly how they derived their halakhic decisions. Despite its harsh tone, Rambam revered Ravad III greatly and accepted much of his criticism. For his part, Ravad III testified that <em>Mishneh Torah</em> was a monumental accomplishment, gathering and classifying all halakhic material found in Talmudic literature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The problem with naming after someone who is alive is that since it became a custom to name after those who are deceased, it may appear as though you are waiting for that person to die (Brit Avot 8:20, in name of Noheg KeTzon Yosef). Also for Ashkenazim out of respect to living parents we dont refer to them by their given names at all, so naming a child after a parent may be problematic. </p>\n\n<p>Whereas some Sefardim specifically name after living parents, as a sign of honour to the parent. </p>\n\n<p>IIRC some poskim rule that there are certain situations where parents can name children after living relatives - such as if the person in question has two or more names, they can choose one of those names, if it relates to a deceased person. </p>\n\n<p>Also, Igrot Moshe (Orach Chaim IV 66) says if a child is being named in honour of a righteous individual or a Talmid Chacham, the namesake can be alive</p>\n\n\n",

He could have ordered Uriah killed on whatever pretext and\n  then taken Bat-Sheva. He had that authority. Instead, what he did was\n  rely on the fact that Jewish soldiers going into battle are required\n  to give their wives conditional retroactive divorce papers which in\n  effect say: \"I divorce you effective today if I do not return from war\n  by next month.\" Babyl. Talmud, Shab. 56a. As king, David could order\n  any of his soldiers on a suicide mission without apology. And because\n  of the retroactive divorce given to Bat-Sheva, David technically did\n  not commit adultery with her as she was divorced. But, as Nathan\n  pointed out, whether or not he was legally permitted to do all that he\n  did, G-d had warned him to be better than that. Accordingly, he owed\n  no apology to anyone (and could not apologize to the deceased Uriah)\n  but G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now what about if Batsheba is indeed Uriah's wife? Why God demand such a light punishment against Dave? Shouldn't they both be stoned to death?</p>\n\n<p>We probably have issue whether the sex is consensual or rape.

As to why this is, either Uriah was actually divorced or conditionally divorced (which took effect retroactiy when he didn't come back). \nUriah was mored bamolchus (either because he called yoav a \"master\" in front of dovid or because he didn't listen to dovid to go home) and so dovid had the right to have him killed.\nAt the time that dovid and batsheva had relations Uriah was technically divorced. \nThe question is SHOULD he have done what he did. Just for his being mored bamolchus he wouldn't have had Uriah killed it's only because he wanted his wife. While they were technically divorced, everyone understood that they weren't getting divorced because they wanted to seperated but as to not cause agunos. So when dovid and batsheva had relations was when Uriah was still alive and so dovid was in a ethical sense stealing his wife. Or according to the understanding that it was a retroactive divorce then batsheva was at that point in time still married to Uriah as only once Uriah was kille was it \"revealed\" that they had been divorced however long ago. \nSo while dovid didn't technically sin according to the letter of the law he did commit some ethical crime. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The issue that is being ignored by supposing that David did not commit the sins of adultery and murder is three-fold.

Thus, the most important role parents have is to actively show how mitzvot are performed and, more importantly, to never demonstrate to your children that the performance of any commandment is \"burdensome\", even if you, personally feel that way. Ideally, you shouldn't. But, for purposes of mentoring your children, I think you should, temporarily, \"fake\" the joy, or at least hide the burden. Your kids should always sense that every thing you perform is for the sake of God, and you perform it because you love to obey God's commands. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Eisemann in his book Of Parents and Penguins classifies the role of parents based on a Talmudic story in which Bruriah (wife of Rebbi Meir) tells him of the passing of their children with an analogy that a depositer came to take back his deposit.  Based on this, Rabbi Eisemann develops the idea that the role of parents in Judaism is stewardship, that we are given responsibility to watch over the souls that were entrusted to us and ensure that they are returned \"intact.\" </p>\n\n<p>R' S.R. Hirsch (quoted in the book The Joy of Raising Children) explains that the role of parents is to be role models - we serve as the model for our children of how to live, and our relationship to them models their perception of the relationship we have with Hashem.  Therefore, the role of parents is to perfect themselves in order to be the perfect models for their children.</p>\n\n\n",

The footnote (28) states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A custom whose observance is very widespread is to keep a copy of the book Raziel haMalakh in the house. This book was reputedly given by the angel Raziel to Adam. [However, the view of Rav Tzadok haKohen of Lublin in his Memoirs (V'sefer) is that (R' Elazar of Worms) the Roke'ach, a disciple of R' Yehudah heChasid wrote it.] It is explained in its title page that if the book is kept in the same place with the person's money, it is a great segula to have wise and intelligent children, success and blessing, and to avoid fire and other damages in his house. Even if one is not able to study the book, just keeping it in his house with his gold and silver will definitely save him from fires, robbery and other trials. (Sefer haMalbush, p.4) [However, some express doubts about this, and Chayei Moharan (478) claims that the book was not passed down from Adam, nor was it transfered to Adam by the angel. Moreover, it is powerless to save one from conflagrations, and it is recorded that the book itself fell victim to fires!

At least one section was available to Ibn Ezra before 1153, when he finished his commentary to Exodus (see his comment on Exodus 14:19). The likely compiler of the medieval version is Eleazar of Worms, as Sefer Galei Razia, which developed into what we have now as Sefer Raziel, including more writings written by people of various theological opinions.

Just like a public or hotel elevator it is not owned by a Jew, so that does not seem to matter. So, does it matter whether one intentionally is opening/closing electrical circuits? Or does it being unintentional make it a passive activity (despite walking intentionally somewhere, thus actively being part of the creation of new videos/pictures)? Or did I never notice and do Jews actually go out of their way to not walk in areas covered by CCTV's, satellites and motion detectors? And additionally if I understand it correctly R. Auerbach had a differing opinion regarding the use of electricity on Shabbath, but I understand that one even less.</p>\n\n<p>Reading <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/148/Q1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article concerning walking through motion sensors triggering lights</a> there is the statement made:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a permitted action might or might not cause a prohibited result, the action is nonetheless permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which would answer my question regarding satellites and motion detectors (not the CCTV's though (Especially so as you directly benefit from the presence of the CCTV's making your neighbourhood/city safer)), if it would also explain why that's the case.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> I am asking this out of a genuine interest as, I will be honest here, I have an extremely extremely hard time comprehending the notions outlined in the aforementioned question.

(SOURCE TBA)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Yehuda claims that violations of Shabbat performed without direct intent are still <em>forbidden</em> (even Biblically, according to most <em>Rishonim</em>). For example if someone drags a bench across a field, thereby unintentionally digging furrows, he is in violation of the melakha of charisha, or plowing. Even though he only intended to relocate a bench, he is culpable for his action, since ultimately he did plow a field.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Shimon disagrees and claims that the absence of direct intent to violate Shabbat renders this act Biblically <em>permissible</em>.  (<a href=\"http://vbm-torah.org/archive/metho65/08metho.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a> for quote)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later rabbis extended this argument into four categories:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><p><em>Melacha she'einah tzricha legufah</em> (an action not needed for its result). This occurs when one does a prohibited action on Shabbat not intending to commit the action prohibited by halacha. For example, pouring water on a field to dispose of the water, rather than to irrigate the field, is a <em>melacha she'eina tzericha legufah.</em> This is normally a rabbinic violation.</p></li>\n  <li><p><em>Pesik resha</em> (undesired act). This occurs when a permitted act will inevitably and directly lead to a prohibited act. As an example, the Talmud stated that if one cuts off the head of a chicken on Shabbat to play with the head, even though one does not care if the chicken lives or dies, a biblical violation has occurred since the action will inevitably lead to killing an animal (a biblical prohibition on Shabbat).</p></li>\n  <li><p><em>Davar she'eino mitkaven</em> (unintended act). This is identical to a pesik resha except that the second act <em>might not occur</em>, and is thus permitted.</p></li>\n  <li><p><em>Pesik resha delo nichah lei</em> (undesired act with no benefit). This is a <em>pesik resha</em> where the second act, even though it must occur, will provide no benefit to the person causing it. Most authorities maintain this is a rabbinic violation; some maintain it is permitted.

(Since all Jews <em>accepted</em> not to use it on Shabbat, with exceptions for devices that use timers set before Shabbat, it remains prohibited even if it's technically permitted.  <sub> \"All Jews\" means traditional Jews in the late 1800's-early 1900's, when electricity first came into widespread use. </sub>)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Sidepoints:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah forbids closing/opening electrical circuits on Shabbat. - Danny Schoemann</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"The Torah\" says no such thing.

A Jew is not allowed to write on Shabbat; it doesn't matter if s\\he borrows the pen from a non-Jew.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Passive vs Active</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm guessing you mean \"indirect\" when you say passive - you cause something to happen, without actually doing it.  This is known as <em>grama</em> and is a really complicated topic.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Directly benefit from CCTV</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>CCTV's act as a deterrent to crime, which is an <em>indirect</em> method.

Indeed it is hard to imagine anyone disagreeing with this claim as the Talmud (Ketubot 72) is clear that a <em>kalta</em> (some sort of basket) fulfills said obligation, and according to many, many Rishonim (see lists and analysis in Benei Vanim 3:21 and 3:25:5) a <em>kalta</em> did not cover all the hair (either because it had holes or because it wasn't big enough).

I would like to know the source for giving charity of the numeric value of the Hebrew word chai (18) and its multiples. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>When charity is given as a form of merit, as opposed to a general tithing obligation, it is seen as an intercessor before G-d. This is termed a <em>sanegor.</em></p>\n<p>Angels also play a part in this role, especially the angel, Michoel. To attest to this symbolically or perhaps to request that this angel intercede and serve as a sanegor on our behalf there is a custom to give charity with the numerical equivalent of Michoel - 101.</p>\n<p>This follows the allegory told by Hillel to Bar Hei Hei of the wagon driver who charges his fare a specified fee for driving 10 parasangs, but doubles the fee for driving 11. Because 1 parasang beyond his habit goes completely beyond his nature, it has double the value of acting only according to ones habitual nature.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that this concept is also associated to 101 as found in regard to the difference in reviewing what one has learned in Torah 100 times versus 101 times like is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.9b.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 9b</a>. Hillel explains that the individual who goes beyond their natural habit (for example, their natural habit of giving, like the required tithe) is <em>one who serves G-d.</em></p>\n<p>So the idea of 101 is connected to the doubling of payment or blessing. This custom is still prevalent among Sefardic Jews.</p>\n<p>Since giving 101 of a particular currency may not be feasible because of excessive cost to the individual, other numeric equivalents which were connected to angels were found.</p>\n<p>18 stems from a kabbalistic understanding of a story in Chagigah 15b: Rebbi Mayer found a pomegranate (רמון) he ate the inside and cast away the husk.</p>\n<p>The kabbalists understood this to be a veiled reference to the angel מטטרון שר הפנים [<em>MaTat, the leader of the entire Angelic court as alluded to by the leading letters to his full title which spell Moshe, משה, who is the leader of the Jewish people</em>]. Just as the Shechinah (G-d's revealed presence in the lowers worlds) spoke from the midst of Moshe's throat, so to the inner aspect of Metatron is equated with the Shechinah in his realm.</p>\n<p>The idea alluded to with the story of Rabbi Mayer is that the letters of the word רמון are the outer letters of the name מטטרון. When those are removed you are left with ט-ט, the inner substance or פנימיות, which is what Rebbi Mayer \"consumed\". In other words, the inner essence of the Angel Metatron is the Shechinah. This is alluded to by the gematria value of ט-ט which is 18 or life.</p>\n<p>Hence, the giving of charity in multiples of 18 (doubling 18 for example like with the Angel, Michoel). And this is derived from the the posuk from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.14.28?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bemidbar 14:28</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֱמֹ֣ר אֲלֵהֶ֗ם <strong>חַי־אָ֙נִי֙ נְאֻם־יְהֹוָ֔ה</strong> אִם־לֹ֕א כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבַּרְתֶּ֖ם בְּאׇזְנָ֑י כֵּ֖ן אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֥ה לָכֶֽם׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>I am life, says G-d</strong>...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While not directly answering this question, there is an incident recorded in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Yosef_David_Azulai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Once you have that premise, it is not a huge leap to specifically the value of <em>chai</em>, as I think most people would readily acknowledge \"life\" to be the the most fundamental blessing. Multiples of <em>chai</em> is surely just a way of amplifying the message of \"life\", (as opposed to an entirely separate rationale). Here is the text of the diary entry for November 21st, 1753:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'And the reply came back' from the eldest among them that they had reached agreement, 'and a spirit of goodwill supported them' for the sum of two hundred and seventy five Corinthian <em>ducats</em> [= <em>escudos</em>].

Rabbeinu Yonah (ibid.) mentions two ways through which silence begets wisdom. Firstly, it trains a person to avoid interrupting his fellow or feeling like he has to speak up even if he does not know the answer to a question, and these qualities are conducive to wisdom. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, as mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/40300/how-does-silence-lead-to-wisdom#comment106444_40300\">Shokhet's comment</a>, it allows a person to listen carefully and in full to the words of his teacher or other wise people. A person who does not habitually restrain himself from speaking will likely speak immediately after he thinks he understands his teacher's meaning, and may thus lose out on the full explication of the teacher's point and intent.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>More generally, silence is an attribute that is suitable for and characteristic of wise people. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel remarked (<em>Avos</em> 1:17): \"All my days, I grew up among the Sages, and I have found no better attribute than silence.\" The distinguished families in Bavel were known to exercise this trait (<em>Kidushin</em> 71b).</p>\n\n<p>One avenue to understanding these sayings is that indicated by the verse in <em>Mishlei</em> (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2810.htm#19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">10:19</a>): \"In many words, sin does not cease, but one who restrains his lips is wise.\" The Rambam (<em>Peirush Hamishnayos</em>,  <em>Avos</em> 1:17) explains that someone who speaks excessively will inevitably say something inappropriate. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Yonah (ibid.) supports the Rambam's approach by quoting the remark of Reish Lakish (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/r/r1101.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Y'rushalmi B'rachos</em> 1:2</a>, our version indicates that the remark was made by R' Shimon bar Yochai) that it would have been appropriate for man to have been created with two mouths so that one of them could be devoted uninterruptedly to Torah, except for the fact that people can't seem to avoid deleterious speech (דילטוריא) even with one mouth - how much worse would it be with two!</p>\n\n<p>Another approach is suggested by a verse in <em>Koheles</em> (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3105.htm#2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5:2</a>), which describes the characteristic behavior of fools by saying that \"a fool's voice [comes] through a multitude of words.\" Rashi (<em>Avos</em> ibid.) remarks that people who are quick to speak up and comment on every matter are widely viewed as fools, even if they are wise, whereas even fools who keep silent are considered wise.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><em>(May this answer also be in the merit of a speedy rescue to the three kidnapped boys - גיל-עד מיכאל בן בת גלים, אייל בן איריס תשורה ויעקב נפתלי בן רחל דבורה)</em></p>\n<p>The answer can be found in Chapter 2 of \"Sha'ar HaTevunah\" in sefer \"Shmiras HaLashon\" - <a href=\"http://shmirashalashon.blogspot.com/2006/12/shmiras-halashon-kislev-20-eightieth.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://shmirashalashon.blogspot.com/2006/12/shmiras-halashon-kislev-20-eightieth.html</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The [attribute of] silence is appropriate for the Torah scholars, how much so, [it is appropriate] for the fools.”[1] (Pisachim, 99a) “[The] fence for wisdom [is] silence.”[2] (Pirkei Avos: Chapter 3; Mishna 13) “The [choicest] of all spices [is] silence.” (Megillah, 18a) [Also], be careful to guard your tongue like the pupil of [your] eye, for “The mouth of the fool is destruction for him, he opens his lips wide, [it is] a snare for his soul.”[3] (Mishlei: 18; 7), and it is written, “He who guards his mouth and his tongue, guards from troubles of his soul.” (Mishlei: 21; 23)</p>\n<p>If you are sitting among a group of people, it is better that [those people] say to you, “Speak!

So too, this is the case with the opening of the mouth, there is a time to open them [to speak] words of Torah and [of] other necessary things, and there is a time to close them, [to refrain from speaking of] the other [types of speech].</p>\n<p>A person [must also] be aware that the [ability of] speech is the most loved of all of the loved [abilities], for through this [ability], the form of the person is completed.</p>\n<p>Therefore, just as a person who possesses gold, silver, and pearls, makes an enclosure for an enclosure to guard them and he conceals these [treasures] in his inner-chamber, inside a box designated for this, similarly, to a greater degree than this, a person must make an enclosure for an enclosure for his mouth, that being in [the enclosure of the attribute of] silence, as mentioned earlier.</p>\n<p>[1] The passage in the gemara states as follows, “The [attribute of] silence is appropriate for the Torah scholars, how much so, [it is appropriate] for the fools, as it says, “Also a fool who is silent will be considered [to be] a wise man, [if he seals his lips, [he will be considered to be] a person of understanding.]” (Mishlei: 17; 28)”</p>\n<p>The preceding pasuk states, “One who prevents himself from making [vain] statements, is knowledgeable, one [who treats his words as carrying] value, is a man of understanding.” (Mishlei: 17; 27)</p>\n<p>The above translation is based on Metzudas David. Onkelos translates the pasuk as “…one who is humble is a man of understanding.”</p>\n<p>Metzudas David has a varying understanding on the pasuk quoted in the gemara, where he explains that the individual who silences the fool is considered to be wise, while one who prevents the fool from saying that which he wishes, is considered to be an individual of understanding.</p>\n<p>On these pisukim, the RaLBa”G explains that the person who is knowledgeable prevents himself from speaking unless he has to say something of necessity. The individual who is understanding treats himself with value, not joining up with individuals of “stature” and he will [try to] avoid excessive speech. Of course, none of the above is done through a sense of haughtiness. By acting in such a manner, the individual will benefit, as, by preventing himself from speaking excessively, his foolishness will leave him, and he will also be considered to be an understanding individual if he seals his lips and does not speak at all.</p>\n<p>[2] Bartenura explains that this Mishna is teaching that one should avoid speaking that which is unnecessary and should limit his speech as much as possible.</p>\n<p>[3] The RaLBa”G explains that the words of the fool present himself with a self-inflicted danger, for, by opening his mouth, he may come to incite a quarrel and he may open his mouth to try to defend his fellow, and, in the process, reveal information that was meant to have been kept secret, leading to discontent.</p>\n<p>The MaLBI”M explains that the fool, with his lips, will ensnare his soul and through the words of his mouth, he will bring destruction upon himself. By opening his lips [to speak that which is forbidden, he could] ensnare his soul in the pit of destruction, and through that which he speaks with his mouth, he also brings destruction to his body, for, [through this forbidden speech], HaShem [may] bring bodily punishment upon the individual.</p>\n<p>[4] The teachings, beginning with the words, “He who is accustomed in [the attribute] of silence” – beginning of the 19th of Kislev, up to this point – are copied from sefer “Orchos Tzaddikim”, “The Gate of Silence”, see over there [for more on the importance of the attribute of silence].</p>\n<p>[5] The translation of \"פתחי\" – “pischei” is “openings” or doorways”.</p>\n<p>The entire pasuk reads as follows:</p>\n<p>“Do not [put your] belief in your fellow, do not trust in the leader. From the one that dwells in your chest, guard the openings of your mouth.” (Mishlei: 7; 5)</p>\n<p>RaSh”I comments that the one who “dwells in your chest” refers to your soul, which will testify against you [regarding your actions and words before the Heavenly tribunal]. Metzudas David and RaDa”K explain that the one who “dwells in your chest” refers to your wife. Do not [even] reveal to your wife information that is meant to be kept secret, for the information is bound to be revealed. RaDa”K explains that one should not speak negatively about his fellow to his wife.</p>\n<p>Clearly, if one is to not reveal such forbidden speech to one’s wife, to whom he confides, how much more so should he similarly be careful to not speak these forbidden words to other people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why do we recite 'Borei Pri Ha'etz ' on grapes?",
    "content": "# Why do we recite 'Borei Pri Ha'etz ' on grapes?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One thing I have always wondered is why we recite Ha'etz over grapes. </p>\n\n<p>First, grapes grow on a vine, so why do we say 'borei pri hagafen' only <em>after</em> the fruit has been processed. Second, grapes generally grow close to the ground so I would then think the bracha would be ha'adama. One might then argue that since it is a vine, it can grow high on a trellis or that it is a perennial. However we make ha'adama on strawberries which are also perennial vines. </p>\n\n<p>Is the reason somehow related to the fact that ha'etz is higher on the bracha hierarchy, and that since grapes (in wine form) serve ritual purpose we would like to give them a 'higher' bracha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>In regards to your \"first\" question, the reason that we do not say hagafen before they are processed should really be asked the other way around, which is why <em>do</em> we make hagafen after it is processed, as opposed to any other fruit which does not get a more specialized blessing?  The answer is given in Berachos 35b that since wine is סעיד ומשמח, typically translated as sating and gladdening, it gets a special blessing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויין ישמח לבב אנוש ולחם לבב אנוש יסעד וגו' נהמא הוא דסעיד חמרא לא סעיד אלא חמרא אית ביה תרתי סעיד ומשמח</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So grapes, which have not reached that stage at which they are סעיד ומשמח remain in the same camp as all other fruit which gets a more general blessing of borei pri ha'etz.</p>\n\n<p>Which brings us to your second question, why is it a borei pri ha'etz?  The basic requirement of borei pri ha'etz is being perennial, as you mentioned, based on Berachos 40a.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היכא מברכינן בורא פרי העץ היכא דכי שקלת ליה לפירי איתיה לגווזא והדר מפיק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosefos there actually suggests that all berries should be borei pri ha'etz based on that standard, however he brings from the Yerushalmi that fruit of brambles/thorn bushes are pri ha'adama. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>איתיה לגווזא והדר אתי. מהכא נראה דתותים ופריזיי\"ש ובונטונ\"ש וכיוצא בהן צריכין לברך עליהם בורא פרי העץ שהרי דרך העץ להתקיים ימים רבים וכי שקיל הפרי בשנה זו הדר אתי פרי באותו העץ עצמו מיהו הרב רבי מנחם הביא ראיה מירושלמי דמסכת כלאים דמברכין על כל מיני דאטד בורא פרי האדמה דקאמר התם ההגין ואטדין מין אילן הם ואינן כלאים בכרם ופריך והתניא אלו הן מיני דשאים הקונדס והאטד ומשני תמן לברכה והכא לכלאים אלמא לענין ברכה מיני דשאין ומיהו לדברי הכל פריזיי\"ש צריך לברך עליהם בפה\"ע דאינו גדל על אטדין ועצו מתקיים משנה לשנה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A grape vine is very different than (your example of) a strawberry vine, as the grape vine is long, and when latticed actually looks much like a tree.  See a picture <a href=\"http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/senior/fruits/images/large/grapeleaf2.jpg\">here</a>. Strawberries grow on small stumpy bushes (like <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Whole_wild_strawberry_plant_UK_2006.JPG\">this</a>), what Tosefos is calling an אטד, and are pri ha'adama.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why were the Jews punished for 40 years if the spies were the ones who were there for 40 days?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9941#v=25&showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bemidbar 13:25</a>) implies that the Jews were in the Sinai Desert for 40 years in response to the spies being in the Land of Israel for 40 days.</p>\n\n<p>While the spies had 40 days worth of planning to sin, and thus were punished, why were the Jews punished for merely accepting the spies’ report?  What do they have to do with the 40 days?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Kli Yakar on יום לשנה says that the punishment actually took place one day a year on Tish'a B'Av. Thus they were punished for \"forty days\" but the forty days were spread over 40 years. The punishment was that all those who should have been in the army and insisted on not listening to the spies (ages 20 to 60) were allowed to live out their \"service life\" and were punished by dying at age 60. Rabbi Munk says that since those who had turned 60 the previous year died on each Tish'a B'Av, it took forty years for the punishment to complete. This allowed the children (under 20) to grow up and replace them so that there was a fully trained and complete community ready to go into Canaan.</p>\n\n<p>This was actually the manifestation of Hashem's Rachamim (mercy). Note that the medrash says that hashem shortened the time of the meraglim in the land so that the trip would take forty days. Rav Shimshon Rafael Hirsch says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>by fitting this time of the duration of the punishment in proportion to the sin, the sin is kept in the minds of the penitents during the whole course of the duration of the punishment. THis method, by which, simply by using some external similarity of numbers, something is brought to, and kept in, the mind, is frequently used by our sages in their institutions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bnei Yisrael had free will and could have resisted the temptation. However, Hashem knew of the possibility of the sin and the necessity of the punishment. As a result, he shortened the trip so that the punishment could be carried out in such a way as to ensure that the lesson had been learned.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Jews were the ones who requested sending out the spies in the first place (Devarim 1:22). By accepting the spies' report when they returned they were endorsing the direction which the 40 day mission they advocated took.</p>\n\n<p>They also attempted to murder Caleb and Joshua, negating 40 days of fruitful work.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>According to tosafos yom tov in sota, chapter one mishna nine, d.h. vichein li'inyan hatova, the forty years was an act of kindness, not retribution. In reality the nation deserved instant death but in order that noone die under the age of sixty, Hashem stretched it out for forty years.</p>\n\n\n",

That goes without saying. Since part of the definition of Mashiach is that he will take the throne and his children will continue to hold it, the mashiach cannot be a woman. However, I address other logic as well below.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Mashiach will be a king and will have children who will be of the lineage of King David, then he cannot be a woman. The children of any women are of the lineage of the husband.  Thus, since the next king must be a child of a king, then a queen's children would not be able to be of that lineage. The rules for a king are similar to those of a kohen.</p>\n\n<p>I explained in another answer, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/31776/which-kings-must-moshiach-descend-from/37097#37097\">which kings must Moshiach descend from?</a>, how the Mashiach needs to be a descendant of Zerubavel because once each king takes the throne, then the lineage continues through him. The circumstance in which Tzidkiyahu became the king was very unusual and the Tanach does not even consider that the lineage could have continued with him. We also see with Athaliah that she was never considered legitimate when she killed all of her grandchildren (except for Yoash) even when it was not known that he was alive.</p>\n\n<p>Since the lineage must be father to son from Zerubavel, then the queen and the king could not both be of the same lineage. Only one particular line from Zerubavel would have led to the mashiach. Once the mashiach is revealed, any one else (from a different line of fathers) would have been shown to be ineligible. For the king and queen to be of the correct lineage would make them brother and sister (even if from different mothers).</p>\n\n<p>Note that the promise that the line would continue means that the mashiach would have children and the kingship would continue in his descendants.</p>\n\n<p>Leadership (as with Devorah) is not inherited as opposed to kingship and kehuna..</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>No, Moshiach is a King, and woman cannot halachically be a king</p>\n\n\n",

Rabba says: This means that he persuaded them [hesitan] with his words. וַיַּהַס and הִסִּיתָן share the same root in Hebrew.</p>\n<p>How did he do so? Yehoshua began to address the people, and as he was speaking they said to him: Should this person, who has a severed head, as he has no children, speak to the people about entering Eretz Yisrael?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.13.30?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netziv adds</a> that Yehoshua already had a prophecy that he was going to lead Jewish people into Eretz Israel instead of Moshe. I.e. under the influence of 10 other meraglim, people took his words as personal desire to become the leader of generation.</p>\n<p>The Gemara continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Caleb said to himself: If I speak they will also say something about me and stop me from speaking. He began to speak and said to them: And is this the only thing that the son of Amram, Moses, has done to us? They thought that he wanted to relate something to the discredit of Moses, and they were silent. He then said to them: He took us out of Egypt, and split the sea for us, and fed us the manna. If he says to us: Build ladders and climb to the heavens, should we not listen to him? “We should go up at once,” even to the heavens, “and possess it” (Numbers 13:30).</p>\n<p>The verses continue: “But the men that went up with him said: We are not able to go up against the people; as they are stronger than us” (Numbers 13:31). Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: The spies said a serious statement at that moment. When they said: “They are stronger,” do not read the phrase as: Stronger than us [mimmennu], but rather read it as: Stronger than Him [mimmennu], meaning that even the Homeowner, God, is unable to remove His belongings from there, as it were. The spies were speaking heresy and claiming that the Canaanites were stronger than God Himself.</p>\n<p>The spies said: “It is a land that consumes its inhabitants” (Numbers 13:32). Rava taught: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I intended the land (to appear to consume its inhabitants) for their own good, but they considered this proof that the land was bad. I intended it for their good by causing many people to die there so that anywhere that the spies arrived, the most important of them died, so that the Canaanites would be preoccupied with mourning and would not inquire about them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, because 10 other spies, considered as great men, publicly discredited both Calev's and Yehoshua's words, their own <em>sh'vatim</em> also did not want to accept their testimony. To fully see this point, one can use the idea of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Chaim_Sonnenfeld\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld</a> commentary on the parsha, that the fruit of Eretz Yisroel reflects the spiritual status of the land inhabitants. Therefore, originally the Jewish people could accept from the 10 spies a lie that the \"giants\" of the land were people of great spiritual level and that the Jewish people would have difficulty fighting them. (This was not true because the fruit was a gift that G-d prepared for the Jews). After Calev's and Yehoshua's words that everything had been reflecting Hashem's will, the 10 spies doubled up on their lie that <em>the Canaanites were stronger than G-d Himself</em>, which their own <em>shvatim</em> did not want to accept.</p>\n\n\n",

But, I assume that there is a difference in meaning of these two words, that hints at why Moshe was unsuccessful, and Yehoshu'a was successful. (I'm aware that the obvious reason is that Yehoshu'a learned from Moshe and didn't make the same mistakes, and that we were dealing with a different group of people and mindset.

But as will be explained, Moses did <strong>not</strong> send out the 12 leaders for ויחפרו:</p>\n\n<p>In the next verse, 1:23, see Rashi, he says Moses agreed to send out spies only in order for them to feel more comfortable about conquering the land, and he hoped they would change their mind when they saw that Moses was confident about conquering the land. But really he himself felt is was unnecessary because he was confident since God said they would get the land. But that's not what happened. They still wanted to spy.</p>\n\n<p>At that point, he decided to consult with God, but he had something else in mind. He felt it would benefit the nation in another way. It would excite the Israelites to see the wonderful produce of the land \"so they would ascend to it with great eagerness.\" (the quote is from Ramban beginning of Shelach). And by the by it may placate the nation, because it will seem to them that people are being sent to the land for the purpose they requested.</p>\n\n<p>And this is what he was advised to do by God. This is why in Shelach God says send אנשים - \"men\" not מרגלים \"spies\", and why it says ויתורו - which can be translated as and they shall scan out or scour as opposed to the more intensive ויחפרו, to dig and excavate, that which should have remained hidden. This is also why the 12 leaders were sent out, because they knew the wants and interests of their specific tribe, and why all 12 of them went through the entire length of the land and they didn't split up, because no one knew yet where his personal tribe's portion laid, because the lottery was not yet performed. So they made sure to scout the entire land, including their own future portion. And everyone knew about this task, which is uncharacteristic of a spy mission.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, by Joshua, who \"sent out two men to spy secretly\"- שנים אנשים מרגלים חרש. It was two regular men, not leaders of the nation. And only two- the more under the radar the better. And they were to be spies. They only ended up going to Jericho, because as soon as they heard from Rahab that their terror was upon the hearts of everyone in the land, and there was no more \"courage in any man, because of you\", 2:9-11,there was no more need to spy further.</p>\n\n<p>From a talk of Rabbi Menachem Schneerson, Shelach 1991.</p>\n\n\n",

For some people a particular application of halacha is considered a חומרה and to others a קולה. This ideology seems to only apply on an individual basis. I can understand, in absolute terms (all things being equal) we can define things as being a חומרה and קולה. However, is there (perhaps 'poetic') license to use these two terms differently in individual cases. </p>\n\n<p>Let me give some examples:</p>\n\n<p>Some would be 'מחמיר' to only eat a certain of the 'best' hechsherim whereas others would be meikel to use less preferable hechsherim. Could one say that, due to financial difficulties of purchasing expensive good hechsherim, he is being 'מחמיר' to specifically not forgo the financial obligations he has towards supporting his family.</p>\n\n<p>Another example. Some are machmir not to hold by eruvim, due to them potentially being invalid (whether this is a valid stance or not, I have lived in communities that don't hold by eruvim for exactly this reason). Could one say that he is being machmir <strong>to use</strong> the eiruv in order to improve oneg shabbat, facilitating his family going to shul, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Although this may be merely poetic license I feel it highlights misconceptions that 'doing more' or 'being more restricting' falls under the category of חומרה and is more desirable. I would love to promulgate a more inclusive Judaism that doesn't castigate those for positively applying the law לחומרה (!) in the opposite sense.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Shlomo Aviner has a number of responses in his sefarim in this sense e.g. he says that we should be מחמיר not to doubt the words of the Rabbanut HaRashit i.e. eat their kashrut, rather than be מחמיר to only eat mehadrin. He also brings heater mechira in the same way, that we should eat it and be מחמיר to support farmers and the settling of Israel rather than be מחמיר to doubt the authority of the Rabbanut HaRashit, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Do any others speak about the use of חומרה and קולה in this way?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Chaim Brisker is famously quoted regarding his allowing people to eat on fast days when they were not feeling well (for which he had a lower standard of \"not feeling well\") that he was not meikel on fasting, he was machmir on Pikuach Nefesh.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is actually very common.

This isn't really a puzzle, but rather a <em>mashal</em> for an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality#Role_of_the_observer_in_quantum_mechanics\" rel=\"noreferrer\">idea</a> in quantum physics.  </p>\n\n<p>The basic idea of Schrödinger's cat is that you put a cat in a box, along with a Geiger counter connected to a source of radiation, with a machine that will release poison that will kill the cat should the device detect radioactivity. What they claim is that until you open the box and see what happened, the cat is <strong>both alive and dead</strong> until observed (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/45/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://explainxkcd.com/45/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>). [and this threw my friends for a <em>real</em> loop ;)]  </p>\n\n<p><hr>\nThis got me thinking: what would happen if someone's son (only child) found their way into a Schrödinger's cat box, and his father died while he was in there? Would his wife have to do <em>yibbum</em>/<em>chalitza</em>?<br>\nWhat if the father was the one in the box, and the son died while he was in there, and after that the box was opened and the father is found dead in the box -- is there <em>yibbum</em>?<br>\n<hr>\n<em>Please note: unless you can tell me otherwise (with a source!) that this is a regular safek, for argument's sake let's assume that it's not; and that there is such a thing as</em> <code>alive and dead until observed</code>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I would say that this is a question of the definition of testimony. We have the halachos in a number of places, including the talmud and Rambam hilchos Yibum, hilchos gittin, and hilchos nashim, about the circumstances as to who is believed if they come before bais din and testify that a person is dead. The implication of all of these is that the witness is testifying that they have seen that the person is dead or they are certifying that a recognized bais din has declared the person dead. Thus, it would be impossible to declare a person dead in the Schrodinger's cat case, <strong>because you could not have aidim.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Consider the case of murder (which is discussed in the Talmud) in which witnesses see two people (one of whom is holding a knife) go into a cave (with no known exit) and one of them is stabbed with that knife. The witnesses cannot be used to condemn the survivor of murder, even if he exits the cave holding the bloody knife. Similarly, witnesses can only say that the \"cat\" is in the box but cannot <strong>testify</strong> that it is dead until the box is opened and they see it. This is true even if we do not say that the cat is \"both alive or dead\".</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the witnesses seeing that the person is in the box cannot be used to establish anything. The box must be opened and the witnesses testify as to what was found in the box before the halacha can be established.</p>\n\n<p>Note: that I have no <strong>specific</strong> sources, but the logic seems to follow from the known halacha of aidus.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Believe it or not, the gemara discusses cases where an individual can have 2 polar opposite statuses at the same time (for example see <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/415\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of cases brought in the gemara (Gittin 41b, Mishna Pesachim 8:1, etc.) of a person that is 'half slave, half free'. Of course, if you are a slave then by definition you are not free and vice versa. There are however, rulings for these individual cases. The commentaries discuss how the 'slave' and 'free' aspect of the person impinge on the outcome of the halacha l'maaseh.</p>\n\n<p>In the case that you bring about a person being both dead and alive could be viewed in a similar light. On the one hand, the child is dead and chalitzah would be required. On the other hand he is alive so it wouldn't be done.</p>\n\n<p>What you should really do is open the box and have a look inside. The real question is, that if you open the box and find that the boy is dead, are you now punished for killing the boy?! By making the observation you force one of the realities to exist singly. However, you could argue that the boy was already fully dead. What you have done though, is taken away the chance of him living. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think that there's one principle that we're forgetting here, and that's the concept of Chazakah. If a person (or cat) enters a box, that person is assumed alive until otherwise identified.</p>\n<p>I would say that we can use Chazakah to resolve Schrödinger's paradox Al Pi Halachah.

Although the cameras operate for security purposes, the passerby does not benefit from being photographed. One only benefits from the system when there’s an unwelcome intruder. Thus, one may walk in front of a camera on Shabbos as this is a case of <em>pesik reisha delo nicha lei</em> (see Shulchan Aruch OC 320:18) which is permitted in a rabbinic prohibition. Likewise, one may operate a surveillance camera.  R’ Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (quoted in Ateres Shlomo 6, p57) concurs. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He further notes that the Jewish people were blessed that each one of them had the power of a thousand people based upon the pasuk in Haazinu (Devarim 32, 30) (he seems to follow the Ibn Ezra's second peshat). As there were 12 spies, together they represented the force of 600,000 men (12 x 50 x 1000) who were to fight to enter Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Yosef Bechor Shor (a talmid of Rabbeinu Tam) took a different view. He wrote that they were actually 'sarei alafim' - leaders of thousands.</p>\n\n<p>I haven’t seen much discussion of the Baal Haturim’s opinion that they were ‘sarei chamishim’. However, I don’t think that had they been higher ranked judges that they would necessarily be better spies.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to humbly suggest a few reasons why Moshe might not have sent more senior people. (As a side point, I should probably mention that the Emes LeYaakov held that the spies were chosen through the Urim VeTumim, and if so the question is not on Moshe personally.)</p>\n\n<p>Usually, an army does not send the most senior people on high risk missions. Of course there is a need to send capable people, but not the ‘top brass’. If really the top people should have been sent, why not include Moshe and Aharon themselves?</p>\n\n<p>Outstanding people also attract a greater level of Ayin Hara. This is why we see in the Gemara (Berachot 31b) that when Chana prayed for a son, she asked that he should not be too tall nor too short, neither too thin nor too corpulent, neither too pale nor too red, neither overly clever nor stupid. Therefore it might not be best to send people at the very top.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, we see from various commentaries (e.g. Kli Yakar and the Netziv) that the entire reason for sending the spies was that the Jewish people did not want, or did not feel worthy of a direct connection with Hashem. The level was too high for them. (The Netziv points out that they now knew that Yehoshua would lead them into Israel, and as they had seen in the war with Amalek, the war he fought was on a more physical level.) They wanted to conquer Eretz Yisrael in a more ‘natural’ way. Therefore, the slightly lower spiritual level of the spies would be more in line with the Jews’ request.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rosh hashana: is it really two days?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Regarding the chagim (festivals), we know that a chag is really one day (not including the rabbinic chag a/k/a yom tov sheini). However, for Rosh hashana, Israelis observe a two day festival. So is the reason Israelis observe two days of Rosh hashana because they believe both are a biblical chag? It makes a difference whether the second day of Rosh hashana is biblical or rabbinic. It would make a difference in burying a dead body, because כבד המת takes precedence over yom tov sheini. So can a person be buried on second day Rosh hashana?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The reason that we keep 2 days on all festivals outside of Israel is because originally it was a doubt whether the new month had been declared, and word did not reach far enough for them to know by the middle of the month.  Even once the calendar was set, they maintained the minhag of their predecessors (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=8&daf=4b&format=pdf\">Beitza 4b</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The Ba'al HaMe'or to Beitza 5a explains that regarding Rosh Hashana, everywhere outside the immediate Temple vicinity is like \"Bavel\" i.e. outside of Eretz Yisroel, because only in the Temple vicinity did they not have the doubt of if today was Yom Tov or not.  So they have the \"Minhag avoseihem\" that we have outside of Israel by all other holidays even in Israel regarding Rosh Hashana.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding burying a dead body, Rosh Hashana is actually more strict than other festivals according to some opinions in the Talmud, but nothing to do with being biblical or rabbinic - it is because of the nature of the doubt.  However, the gemara is explicit that even on Rosh Hashana they allowed burying someone on the second day (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=8&daf=6&format=pdf\">Beitza 6a</a>).</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, it was a major machlokes Rishonim if Rosh Hashana should be 2 days in Israel.</p>\n\n\n",

Are they considered authentic representations of Judaism? If there are textual variants between our current Tanach texts and the scrolls are the scrolls seen as more accurate? Do any contemporary poskim discuss the place of the scrolls, how they should be viewed, etc?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>During the Second Temple Period, there were different sects with different interpretations of Judaism. The descendants of the Pharisees wrote the Talmud, which defined Orthodox Judaism as we know today.</p>\n\n<p>(What follows is from Rabbi Shneur Leiman's lecture on yutorah.org)</p>\n\n<p>The Dead Sea Scrolls belonged to a sect that was clearly not the Pharisees; it includes a letter to the Pharisee priest describing their differences. For instance, the Talmud says that the barley for the Omer sacrifice was harvested immediately after the first day of Passover, and this was stressed \"because the Boethusians said it was not harvested right after the festival.\" The Dead Sea Scrolls contain a work, Book of the Jubilees, that sets up their calendar as always harvesting the Omer barley several days later. (I think Passover would always start on a Wednesday, and the Omer-harvesting would be the next Saturday night.) So the Dead-Sea sect may have been the Boethusians that the Talmud described; or some say the Sadduces; the point is, they were a different sect with a different interpretation which is not the one we follow. Differences in their text of the Bible vs. the mainstream text we use today are also explained as \"this was a different sect with different practices.\"</p>\n\n<p>It's a bit like when they do excavations in Israel and find all these First-Temple Era idols. Yes, we know from the Bible that the Jews kept worshipping idols when they weren't supposed to! Okay fine, maybe now you can show me exactly what the idol looked like, woohoo if that floats your boat, great. Just because it's buried there doesn't mean it's right. Same thing here. The Talmud says there were variant sects and we don't follow them, so now we found a treasure trove all about one of these sects. Occasionally it can shed light on the Talmud's brief descriptions of the non-mainstream practices it's rejecting (such as the above), but it really doesn't change what we're supposed to do or follow.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The perspective of Orthodox Jews vis-a-vis the Dead sea scrolls varies from non recognition, ambivalence, to outright excitement. </p>\n\n<p>For those who do not view it as a life altering find see them as 1. Either a validation of what was already known to them ie. Small variance in textual differences due to a very solid mesorah. 2. the other non canonical scrolls found among them only showed that this sect was a fringe element with tzduki tendencies, and thus of no relevance to modern day rabbinical Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Those who are ambivalent share similar views with those above, yet they will also use it as a \"kiruv tool\" to show the trustworthiness of the transmission of the biblical canon, thus Rav Yosef Reinman (<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=offFN-Bhl6EC&dq=ammiel%20hirsch&hl=en&ei=_oWXTe7VJ9rR4waOyezUAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">One people, two worlds</a>), Rav Mordechai Becher, and Aish Discovery seminars will cite them to show small of variation from the text of our Sifrei Tanach.</p>\n\n<p>And there are those who have an enthusiastic reception of the scrolls. This includes, Professor Shnayer (Sid) Leiman and most notably <a href=\"http://hebrewjudaic.as.nyu.edu/object/lawrenceschiffman.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proff. Lawrence Schiffman</a> an Orthodox Jew who has lectured in NYU and Yeshiva University. He is widely considered the worlds foremost expert on the dead sea scrolls.</p>\n\n<p>Professor Schiffman posits, that although the scrolls were clearly written by a fringe extremist group during the Hasmonean period, they can be used to create a clearer backdrop to more fully understand second temple Pharasaic Judaism and the milieu in which it was couched.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was Bar Kochba a King?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e511.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Melachim 11:8</a>) says the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם יעמוד מלך מבית דויד הוגה בתורה ועוסק במצוות כדויד אביו, כפי תורה שבכתב ושבעל פה, ויכוף כל ישראל לילך בה ולחזק בדקה, ויילחם מלחמות ה'--הרי זה בחזקת שהוא משיח:  אם עשה והצליח, וניצח כל האומות שסביביו, ובנה מקדש במקומו, וקיבץ נדחי ישראל--הרי זה משיח בוודאי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This passage suggests that the Mashiach will be a King.</p>\n\n<p>Famously, Rabbi Akiva (and others in his generation) believed Bar Kochba to be the Mashiach. The next Rambam seems to suggest that Bar Kochba was a king (ibid.):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהרי רבי עקיבה חכם גדול מחכמי משנה היה, והוא היה נושא כליו של בן כוזבא\n  המלך, והוא היה אומר עליו, שהוא המלך המשיח.  ודימה הוא וכל חכמי דורו\n  שהוא המלך המשיח, עד שנהרג בעוונות;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Following this can we assume that Rabbi Akiva believed him to be a king? If yes, was he ever anointed as such? Is 'fighting the wars of Hashem' a sufficient criterion for being labelled a king?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In short, NO.</p>\n\n<p>On his coins and lead reference weights, he is identified as \"Shimon, Nasi Yisrael\" - Simon, Prince of Israel. <a href=\"http://www.amuseum.org/book/page19.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ngccoin.com/news/viewarticle.aspx?IDArticle=2494\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> are some pages with coin pictures.  Some have just \"Shimon\" on them, others have \"Shimon, Nasi Yisrael\" in pre-Exilic script plainly legible.</p>\n\n<p>If he WAS a King he would have no doubt identified himself as one.\nAs some of his letters <a href=\"http://www.livius.org/ja-jn/jewish_wars/bk07.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://cojs.org/the_bar_kokhba_letters-_day-to-day_conduct_of_the_revolt/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> show, he wasn't exactly a meek and humble guy, threatening punishment, and in one letter, foot fetters, for not following his orders.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe writes in Likkutei Sichos 8 <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15949&st=&pgnum=372&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">page 361</a> (at the bottom) that since there was no Navi, and the Rambam (Hilchos Malachim 1:3) requires a Navi (and a Sanhedrin of 71) to appoint a king, Moshiach is not a formal king, rather called one like the Rambam calls Ben Kuzba.</p>\n\n<p>In Likkutei Sichos 23 <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16034&st=&pgnum=212&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">page 197</a> footnote 59 he writes that the intention is that he will not initially have the Halachos of a king.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding anointing, the Minchas Chinuch <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14093&st=&pgnum=233&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mitzvah 107</a> at the end makes a Chakira if the son of a king doesn't need anointing (Rambam Hilchos Malachim Chapter 1 at the end) it is because of an inheritance or because the anointing of the father continues to the son. According to the view that it is an inheritance, Moshiach won't need to be anointed at all. However, according to the view that it comes through a continuation, and since there was a rebellion against the last king of the Davidic line, the anointing doesn't hold just like previous kings who had to be anointed to settle a previously disputed continuation. He concludes that Moshiach will pasken which way to decide this question.</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe, however, points out that the very name Moshiach means anointed (and not a possible alternative meaning of greatness), and therefore suggests that there may be two stages where he is initially Moshiach without being anointed, and will then subsequently be anointed.</p>\n\n<p>The upshot is (if I understand correctly - the subject is a bit cryptic and only in footnotes) that Moshiach will initially function as a King, but not have the Halachos of one, and will only subsequently be installed as a proper Halachic king.</p>\n\n<p>See the Rambam at the end of Chapter 5 of <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/b305.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gezeila V'Aveida</a> for how such a \"king in function\" may work - הסכימו עליו בני אותה הארץ, וסמכה דעתן שהוא אדוניהם והם לו עבדים - The people accept that he is the king, and understand that he is their master and they his servants.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%9B%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%94%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Mordechai Hakohen</a> in his book \"אישים ותקופות\" (People and Eras), pg. 105-108, discusses this issue and concludes, based on various midrashim and aggadatot on Bar Kochva, together with the coins bearing his name, that (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...as he, Shimon, despite Rabbi Akiva having announced before him always that \"he is the King Mashiach\", and all of the nation would reply: \"Long live the king\", Bar Kochva was not willing to be officially crowned with the title of \"king\" - though he believed in his mission and messianic potential, he asked for patience, to wait until the final victory over the Romans...And from here, though all the sages of the era and all of Yisrael recognized him as the acting king, he himself, out of his greatness and humility, only saw himself as a Nasi [prince] and not a king, and so minted on his coins that were minted on his command. Also, in the same time that everyone called him, based on the announcement of Rabbi Akiva and his party by the name \"Bar Kochva\", as though saying \"A star rises from Yaakov\", he himself signed his letters and commands by the name \"ben Kosba\" - ben Koziva...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Per this, it seems that he was recognized as king for all intents and purposes by just about everyone, but since he wished to wait for the final victory over the Romans, he refused to be anointed as a 100% official king. For this reason, he isn't called king in his letters or his coins.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_Zini\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dr. Eliyahu Zini</a> wrote in his essay on Bar Kochva (Etz Erez, pg. 321), with regards to various midrashim, aggadatot and in particular, this Rambam on Bar Kochva (my translation and emphasis):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...all that remains is to figure out in what way our sages saw that he [Bar Kochva] was to be considered a 'king'? Well, the answer is simple: He stood in the head of the leadership of the people, and held weapons in order to free the people of our nation from the burden of the Romans. These acts alone are enough for his leadership to be considered a monarchy! After all, freeing Am Yisrael from the burden of the nations is one of the tasks of the monarchy! And this freeing in the time of Bar Kochva lasted only two and a half years, which is why our sages number his reign as lasting two and a half years (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.93b.8?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 93b</a>). <strong>And for all this there is no need for anointing oil or a Sanhedrin!</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Although it should be noted that Bar Kochva did mint coins, which according to Chazal denotes someone as a king (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.14b.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 14b</a>). So at the very least he was de facto a king from a halachic perspective.</p>\n\n\n",

If having one day a year to focus on recognizing your father is meaningful for your father (especially if he's expecting some recognition), then by all means do it. If neither he nor you really cares about it, then there's no need.</p>\n\n<p>Look, today we like to turn values into simple actions that can be ceremonialized and commercialized. You bought dad a plasma TV on Father's Day? <em>Yotzei</em>. The true meaning of honoring your parents is complex; the medrish says that you could feed your elderly father the finest of aged steaks while dishonoring him (\"it's food dad, just eat it, old man. I've got take this phone call now.\"); or give him heavy labor at the millstone while honoring him (\"between the two of us, one needed to work the mill, and the other needed to be drafted into the army; I'm so sorry dad, I think this is the least-difficult thing I could do to you.\") It's all about the attitude.</p>\n\n<p>And from the father's perspective, well, Judaism expects men to civilize themselves and shoulder the responsibility of being an involved parent. If it makes you feel better that there's one day a year when everyone publicly gives you a salute for it, then fine. Hey the Talmud says you don't always have to have perfect motivations for doing the right thing.</p>\n\n<p>I'll tell you how I was taught to observe Father's Day: my father would remind me to call my grandfather (<em>his</em> father) and wish him a Happy Father's Day. </p>\n\n\n",

What they <em>are</em> and what it is that is being learned when one learns these teachings is elusive and not necessarily directly communicable (and there are several major streams of interpretation that take different paths).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In order properly answer the question it would help to know in what context you see the word, so that the explanation can fit the context. However, in general, the Alter Rebbe of Lubavitch explains it <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/toraor/12/52a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">like this</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהוא שנתחלק' הספי' בהתפשטו' לפרטי פרטיו' טפ\"ט ובכל א' ראש תוך סוף וה\"ח המגדילי' עד שנעשה רמ\"ח איברים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Sefiros spread out into specific detail expression 9 times 9, each level having a head, middle and end, plus five <em>Chassadim</em> - levels of kindness - that create the expansion become 248.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the Sefiros combine with each other to create a more complex structure. He gives a parable for this from how the soul is enclothed in the body. There is an ability to see, an ability to hear, and ability to walk, etc.</p>\n\n<p>This combination creates the ability for there to be an advantage and connection in the end to the beginning. In other words, the head has intellectual abilities that are certainly higher than the ability to walk. But still, the head cannot walk anywhere, and thus lacks an ability of the feet.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly Partzufim create a reality and connection with Hashem that isn't possible in the strict orderliness of the Sefiros. He goes on to explain that this exists in Mitzvos which is why accompanying the dead takes precedence over learning Torah, and other such examples.</p>\n\n\n",

There he makes the argument that the Anshei Kneset Hagedolah never established the exacting wording for the amida. A summary of much of this discussion can be found <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2011/10/each-river-and-its-channel-halakhic-attitudes-toward-liturgy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. He seems to argue for the ability of anyone to adjust the wording of their amida. I would like to know if there is any contemporary (last 50 years) orthodox posek who supports this idea and paskens that a person can change the wording of his silent shemona esrei (as long as it doesn't violate the topic of the bracha)and still fulfill his obligation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As far as I'm aware, there is no well-accepted posek who would permit this. Even R. Abadi, who has many unusual opinions and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1525&st=&pgnum=62&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">allows recitation of a shorter version of Birkas Hamazon</a>, implies in that teshuvah that  one cannot arbitrarily shorten the Shemoneh Esre. While <em>additions</em> to anyone's personal prayers are allowed (see Shulchan Aruch O.C. 119), this is only where an <em>addition</em> is needed, but not deletions or additions which are meant to be permanent (Aruch Hashulchan 119:2). This temporary allowance for additions, as far as I'm aware, is agreed upon by all contemporary poskim. </p>\n\n<p>However, there are two people who might be considered contemporary poskim by some stretch, who did believe in such a practice. One is <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%94%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Joseph Heinemann</a>, an Israeli scholar of the history of the siddur and similar matters, who wrote a book Iyunei Tefillah, where he discusses several themes about tefillah in general, including some halakhic concepts. Among them, he argues for the flexibility of shemoneh esre (and other prayers), at least in private.  </p>\n\n<p>Prof. Daniel Sperber is not exactly a mainstream orthodox posek (most of his opinions, especially regarding the ones involving women in prayer, have been attacked vehemently by others and are far from being widely accepted) but he did write a book about the development of the siddur, in which he argues for a more free-style prayer. </p>\n\n<p>This opinion is based both on the history of the siddur, which he attempts to show has been rather flexible (and therefore there's no reason, he implies, why we should suddenly freeze its development when it's been changing constantly for centuries), and his reliance on various Rishonim who held this opinion. Among them the Ra\"ah (Pekudas Halveiim to Berachos 11) who allows all forms of temporary (as in, not canon-changing) improvisations in prayer, and his student the Ritvah (Hilchos Berachos 6:14) who says the same thing. This also appears to be the opinion of the Rashba and Meiri (both to Berachos 11a) as well. Even though the Rambam (Teshuva 254) does write that any deviation from the original text is unacceptable, R. Prof. Sperber insists that we do not hold like him, because the Rambam specifically includes piyyutim as such deviations. Since Ashkenazic communities have been inserting piyyutim in their prayers for around a millennium, we clearly 'pasken' that the Shemoneh Esreh is more fluid and that one can actually change around the text of each beracha as long as one keeps to the theme and uses the same closing. </p>\n\n<p>Prof. Sperber's opinion is elucidated in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDsrtxvAQGg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this shuir of his</a>, and the article linked in the question is a continuation of articles than began by discussing his book on the subject: <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2011/10/wrong-changes-in-jewish-liturgy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a critical review</a> and <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2011/10/each-river-and-its-channel-halakhic-attitudes-toward-liturgy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a rebuttal</a>. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While the following source is not a modern Posek, it still may be of interest.

The Eitz Chaim could be seen as in line with the Tikkunei Zohar.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One must understand the anatomy and functions of the heart and liver to approach the subject. Stem cells make blood in the bone marrow at the center of most bones, including the skull, meninges and brain - billions of new cells daily! The heart circulates the blood, the liver processes it AND stores it. Blood stores the soul and is our life ( agreed on by all chachamim), carried by jugular veins THROUGHOUT the entire body - liver, limbs, etc. Whether an organ has the nefesh in it or not is far less important than doing the mitzvot to complete each nefesh, ruach and neshama . The life force - the blood is throughout our bodies. And \"one recieves blood from all the 248 limbs and sends out oxygenated blood to them.\" Doing the mitzvot to complete the structure from keter to malchut from our brains to our feet refines the blood, cleans the liver and rids one of the animal soul. As the liver absorbs and dissolves fats, and makes bile to do so, so \"the evening prayer parallels the parts and the fat which are devoured all night. From the liver comes all disease and illness.\"See Raaya Mehemna Zohar Pinchas ch.39, Gemara Brachot 61, Eitz Chaim shaar 42, ch. 1, Megillat Eicha 2:11, Yeshayahu 38:2\nPlease see my book Healing Through the Mitzvot: Transforming to Eternal Light which includes Translation of Pri Yitzchak by Rav Hirsch.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does today's Yom Kippur observance atone for all sins?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I find the liturgical and rabbinic descriptions of the atonement process on Yom Kippur challenging.  Without a Sanhedrin to mete out punishments for intentional sins, and no altar to bring offerings to atone for unintentional or un-witnessed sins, the chance of ever starting the year with a clean slate seems bleak.  But we are also led to believe that sincere repentence wipes out all sins. Can we ever start with a truly clean slate? Or will we still be held liable for sins we don't get punished for in this world?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To summarize Rambam Hilkhot Teshuva <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1501.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">ch. 1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1502.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">ch. 2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Repentance absolves all sins. However, depending on the nature of the sin, full atonement may be immediate or may be contingent on something else.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Violation of a positive commandment (that does not carry <em>karet</em>) is forgiven immediately upon repentance. (1:9)</li>\n<li><p>Violation of a negative commandment (that does not carry <em>karet</em>) is partially forgiven upon repentance, but only fully forgiven on Yom HaKippurim. (1:10)</p></li>\n<li><p>Violation of capital offenses or offenses that carry the penalty of <em>karet</em>, are partially forgiven through repentance and Yom HaKippurim, and are fully forgiven through suffering. (1:11)</p></li>\n<li><p>Violations that cause desecration of God's name are only fully forgiven upon death. (1:12). These are sins which are done to anger God (Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1105.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">5:13</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Interpersonal sins require restitution to the damaged party as well as his forgiveness. (Hilkhot Teshuvah <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1502.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">2:11</a>) </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So as far as positive and negative commandments, one will indeed start the year with a clean slate (provide that he repents). Even the more severe sins carrying the death penalty or <em>karet</em> do not require the Sanhedrin or the sacrificial service to achieve atonement.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In summary, no, not ALL sins.</p>\n\n<p>There are several aspects to answering your question, and I couldn't get to all of them, here. </p>\n\n<p>But to start, Talmud Yevamot (don't know exact page) explains that Yom Kippur never atones for sins between one person and another until that person requests forgiveness, personally. The method becomes a bit more complex if the wronged person is unreachable or dead.</p>\n\n<p>Another more difficult example is atonement for lashon hara and rechilut (gossip, slander). How would you now how many people got the bard word about someone, and how could you really recover the damage already done?</p>\n\n<p>Yet another concept is inferred from your mentioning that we don't have a Bet Hamikdash and we carry the sins of our ancestors. This concept is hinted to in a few places in our daily prayers (esp. Tachanun) and the fact that we still don't have a Bet Hamikdash is an indication that we have not yet been forgiven.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, what about all those sins that we did during the year, but on Yom Kippur, we forgot about them and didn't mention them in our confession? We're still responsible.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The first perek of Shevuos, summarized in Rambam's first perek of Hilchos Teshuvah, says that certain sins are atoned for immediately by teshuvah, certain ones are atoned for by Yom Kippur, though Teshuvah delays the punishment in Olam HaBa, and certain sins are atoned for with suffering, though Teshuvah and Yom Kippur delay the ultimate punishment. Chillul Hashem is the harshest of all; its atonement comes only with death, and the above three delay the punishment until then.</p>\n\n<p>Also, as discussed in the last Mishnah in Yoma, there's another requirement for sins between man and his friend, which is asking for forgiveness.</p>\n\n<p>As the Rambam (ibid.) notes, none of these sources say anything about karbanos. To the contrary, our Teshuvah takes the place of the karbanos, and, as the Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 7:2) points out, is even better than karbanos:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One who does Teshuvah is as if he went to Yerushalayim, built the Beis HaMikdash, built the Mizbeiach, and offered upon it <strong>all</strong> the karbanos in the Torah, as the passuk says, \"The offerings of Hashem are a broken heart.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Emphasis mine: not just the applicable karbanos to the sin in question, but every last one of them. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Reasons for allowing התר מכירה in this day and age\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Here is the concluding paragraph from an article from Torah L'Daat (red volume, BeHar 'בענין אם יש קנין לנכרי בארץ ישראל להפקיע קדושת שביעית') that discusses the halachic boundaries of whether non-Jews can acquire land in Israel to remove the obligation of Shvi'it. The article, in general, outlines the basis for heter mechira.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‏… היתר זה של הב״י הי׳ היסוד להיתר המכירה שהונהג משנות תרמ״ט—תרנ״ו ואילך. אמנם, הרבה גדולים התנגדו למכירה מטעמים אחרים, ואפילו המתירים התירו למכור לעכו״ם רק בשעת הדחק גדולה כשהי׳ נוגע לפיקוח נפש ממש, ולא התירו לחלוטין אלא בשביל שמיטה אחת לבד, ובשמיטה הבאה הוצרכו לישב בדין עוד פעם לברר אם השעה דחוקה כ״כ עד שהוצרכו לסמוך על היתר מכירה.…‏</p>\n<p>… This <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/585\">heter</a> of the Bet Yosef was the basis for the heter of sale that was practiced from the years 5649 to 5656 and thenceforth. However, many great rabbis opposed the sale for other reasons, and even those who allowed selling to a non-Jew did so only in a great time of pressure where it was relevant to actual preservation of life. They allowed it not absolutely but for one Shvi'it alone and required the following Shvi'it that people sit in judgement again to determine whether the time was so pressing as to require reliance upon the heter of sale.…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The condition brought to allow heter mechira is that it must be only at a 'very pressing time' (שעת הדחק גדולה) where 'lives are at stake'. Do battei din that permit heter mechira use other clauses to allow heter mechira? Or do we indeed live in a time where lives are at stake and we permit heter mechira?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Ovadia Yosef states that the sefardi poskim allow heter mechira, regardless of if it is a shaas hadchak. He also quotes that Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach paskened in favor of heter mechira.\nIn his sefer שו\"ת יביע אומר\nח\"י),\nRav Ovadia, states  clearly that it is 100% permitted in this day, and that is regardless of whether it is a time of sakana. But for those who are machmir, blessing will come to them. </p>\n\n<p>I dont think that it is easy to say that it is a 1 dimensional issue,  it clearly has many issues that need to be taken into account, such as if we are machmir will we be causing farmers to sin. </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Doesn't the wide use of Sheitels among Orthodox Jewish women prove that hair no longer retains the erotic status that it once had?",
    "content": "# Doesn't the wide use of Sheitels among Orthodox Jewish women prove that hair no longer retains the erotic status that it once had?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In reading scores of halakhic material on the subject of <em>kisui rosh le-nashim</em> throughout the ages, I have found that there are essentially two views as to the nature of the obligation for a woman to cover her hair in public - that it is an actual <em>law</em> (לאו) of the Torah and that it is <em>minhagh</em> (מנהג) of Jewish women. While it seems that these two views were once mutually exclusive (i.e. one side permitting the uncovering of a woman's hair in public and one side prohibiting it), today they seem to have merged into a view that although due to <em>hergel</em> (הרגל) in seeing womens' hair it has lost it's status as <em>`erwah</em> (ערוה) they are nevertheless required to cover it (cf. Arokh HaShulhan 75:7 & Igroth Mosheh, Orah Hayim 1:42).</p>\n\n<p>During the discussions of permitting some (in this case more than a <em>tefah</em> but less than all) hair or all hair to be left uncovered in public, the point is usually stressed that even if someone did hold that it was a subjective obligation, they are stuck in a bind since the local custom is determined by the practice of religious women and not irreligious or non-Jewish women. And, so the argument goes, since the overwhelming majority of religious Jewish women cover their hair, the obligation - even for those who may hold that it is determined by custom - is still binding today.</p>\n\n<p>However, the way in which the overwhelming majority of Jewish women today cover their hair - either all or part of the time - is by using a sheitel/wig. So, especially since the sheitels today are so realistic, worn long around the shoulders, and are even at times made of the woman's own hair (!), doesn't that communicate that the religious Jewish world is essentially fine with women's hair showing? Doesn't that invalidate the need for covering at all?</p>\n\n<p>I have been told that the actual isur is seeing the actual hair and not hair in general, but this seems illogical and with this logic we could say (<em>halilah wa-has</em>) that nude pictures of women are okay to look at since it is not <strong><em>actual</em></strong> <em>`erwah</em>, etc. Which, of course, is blatantly ridiculous to any religious Jew.</p>\n\n<p>So doesn't the wide use of Sheitels among Orthodox Jewish women prove that hair no longer retains the erotic status that it once had and that the halakhic obligation for women to cover their hair in public has been nullified?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Firstly: What makes you think that Sheitels are a <strong>recent</strong> development?</p>\n\n<p>See the Gemara in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l4411.htm\">Sanhedrin 112a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בעי רב יוסף שיער <strong>נשים צדקניות</strong> מהו אמר רבא הא דרשעיות אסור (דברים יג) תקבץ ושרפת כתיב מי שאינו מחוסר אלא קביצה ושריפה יצא זה שמחוסר תלישה וקביצה ושריפה אלא אמר רבא <strong>בפיאה נכרית</strong> היכי דמי אי דמחובר בגופה כגופה דמיא לא צריכא דתלי בסיבטא כנכסי צדיקים שבתוכה דמי ואבד או דלמא כיון דעיילא ונפקא כלבושה דמי תיקו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's clear from there that Righteous Women wore Sheitels in the time of the Gemara and before that, since Ir HaNidachat only applies when there's a Sahedrin!</p>\n\n<p>Secondly: What makes you think that hair is erotic and therefore to needs to be covered?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>See the Shiltei Giborim (Shabbos 29a in the Rif) who Paskens that only the area where the hair grows needs to be covered - and he seems to permit the longer hair to be left uncovered. (He says so 3 times.)</li>\n<li>Note that unmarried women do not need to cover their hair. For that matter, even <em>ugly hair</em>, or thin-barely-visible hair needs to be covered on a married woman.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It would seem to me that we learn from Sota that a married woman must cover her hair. No reason given; as usual when we try give a Mitzva a reason, we then feel we can prove the reason doesn't exist and then abolish the Mitzva.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rabbi Michael Broyde makes this exact point. \"Would we allow a woman to wear a shirt that had an image of her bare chest on it? No, because that image is inappropriate in our culture.\"</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, if a woman would travel to some country where all the women keep their hair covered and wear a ritzy-deluxe sheitel there, she would turn a lot of heads. Presumably that would be prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>What he, Rabbi Willig, and many others suggest is that there are two different laws. One is that \"hair is <em>erva</em>\", however that is subjective to current mores. (Note that Talmudic quote didn't say \"married hair\", just \"hair.\") The other is an objective law, \"married women should cover their hair\" -- irrespective of its erotic status. The sheitel thus satisfies the letter of the law, because it's a covering; and the spirit of the law is satisfied because hair is not erotic in today's liberal Western culture.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Certainly not the standard approach, but Rav Abadie holds that the primary reason for a married woman to cover her hair is to make her attractive (hence a sotahs hair is uncovered to disgrace her) \nhere is his answer to the shaitel question\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kajqCvyTfZI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kajqCvyTfZI</a></p>\n\n\n",

What about if there are other options, but they are economically burdensome (e.g. one can go to a mixed gym for free vs. pay to go to a single gender gym or to get one's own equipment)? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>If we are talking about somebody who suspects that he may fall to temptation and have inappropriate thoughts about the immodestly attired women there, it is forbidden. There are numerous <em>issurim</em> involved - gazing at inappropriate things is forbidden by לא תתורו אחרי לבבכם ואחרי עיניכם, and having inappropriate thoughts is forbidden under ונשמרת מכל דבר רע (see A\"Z 20b, Kesuvos 46a). [See <a href=\"https://www.betmidrash.org.il/index.php/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%94\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for further discussion]</p>\n\n<p>The real question arises to someone who is confident in his ability to withstand temptation to gaze at immodest sights, and to keep his thoughts on permissible things.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara (Baba Basra 57b) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>׳ועוצם עיניו מראות ברע׳ -  א\"ר חייא בר אבא זה שאין מסתכל בנשים בשעה שעומדות\n  על הכביסה. היכי דמי: אי דאיכא דרכא אחריתא, רשע הוא אי דליכא דרכא אחריתא,\n  אנוס הוא? לעולם דליכא דרכא אחריתא ואפ\"ה מיבעי ליה למינס נפשיה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One who has two paths available, and takes the path where there are women washing is categorized as a רשע - <em>a wicked person</em> - <strong>although he averted his gaze and did not look at the inappropriate sights</strong>. The Rashbam explains, this is because one is forbidden to enter into a situation where there may be tempation; he is <em>wicked</em> for putting himself into a <em>nisayon</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רשע הוא - ואף על פי שעוצם עיניו שלא היה לו לקרב אלא להרחיק מן העבירה\n  דקיימא לן חולין הרחק מן הכיעור - רשב״ם בבא בתרא נ״ז</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Accordingly, if one has an alternative option, one may not willingly enter a situation where he increases his temptation. If he can exercise in a place where there will not be inappropriately clad women, he must do so. </p>\n\n<p>If there is no other way for him to exercise, this is considered ליכא דרכא אחרינא, and when faced without any option, the prohibition of entering a <em>nisayon</em> falls away - provided that he is confident he will not transgress any of the aformentioned prohibitions. Even so, R' Moshe Feinstien rules (Igros Moshe EH V1, §56) that in a recreational capacity, it is not considered ליכא דרכא אחרינא.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולכן צריך לומר דכיון דהאיסור הוא רק משום חשש שיבוא לידי הרהור רשאי\n  לסמוך על עצמו שיסיח דעתו מהן ולא יהרהר מחמת שיסתכל בהן <strong>כשיש לו צורך\n  ללכת שם לצרכי פרנסתו וכדומה</strong> ואינו מחוייב לחשוש ע\"ז ביותר ולהפסיד ממונו\n  ולמנוע משאר צרכיו, ורק כשאין לו צורך לעבור כאן כגון באיכא דרכא אחריתא\n  <strong>וה\"ה כשאין לו צורך לילך שם דהולך רק לטייל</strong> שאף בליכא דרכא אחריתא הוא\n  אסור לסמוך על עצמו שיסיח דעתו דהא זהו האיסור ונשמרת שלא יסמוך על עצמו\n  לומר שלא יהרהר אבל במקום צורך רשאי לסמוך שלא יהרהר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: best to <a href=\"https://www.yourdictionary.com/cylor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CYLOR</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In an answer titled \"<a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2017/04/27/men-and-mixed-gyms/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Men and Mixed Gyms</a>,\" <strong>dinonline.org</strong> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are two issues with a man going to a mixed gym.

    "title": "Parshas Korach: What Was Korach Thinking?",
    "content": "# Parshas Korach: What Was Korach Thinking?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Medrash Tanchuma asks a question regarding the motives of Korach. \"Korach was a clever man; what did he see that brought him to such foolishness? The medrash answers \"His eyes misled him, for he saw a great chain of descendants emerging from him: Shmuel Hanavi, who was as important as Moshe and Aharon, as it says in Tehillim (99:6) 'Moshe and Aharon were among His priests and Shmuel was among those who invoke His name.'\" Korach saw from the fact that Shmuel is mentioned in the same sentence as Moshe and Aharon, that Shmuel is just as important as them.</p>\n\n<p>Korach's line of reasoning is very difficult to understand. He feels that he is justified in replacing Moshe and Aharon as leader because he saw that one of his descendants will be a very important person. How does his offspring prove that he is fitting to be a leader? If Shmuel himself was leading this rebellion, then the argument would make sense: Shmuel is just as important as Moshe and Aharon, so perhaps he could be fitting to lead in their place. But what does Shmuel's greatness say about Korach's own worthiness? </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, this thought process only proves the very opposite of Korach's entire goal! Inherent in his line of reasoning is the assumption that Moshe and Aharon are men of spiritual greatness. Korach deduces that since Shmuel is just as important as them, Korach himself deserves to lead. But yet, he claims that Moshe and Aharon are unwitting to be leaders but that they are fabricating the will of HaShem! How can they be great enough to prove his own greatness, yet not great enough to be the rightful leaders? </p>\n\n<p>How can Korach make such an illogical and foolish argument?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Medrash itself answers your first point in its continuation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר: אפשר הגדולה הזו עתידה לעמוד ממני, ואני אדום!? ולא ראה יפה, לפי שבניו עשו תשובה ועומדין מהן, ומשה היה רואה. <strong>לכך נשתתף לבא לאותה חזקה, ששמע מפי משה שכולם אובדין ואחד פליט: 'והיה האיש אשר יבחר ה' הוא הקדוש'</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He heard there would only be one survivor, and he did not realize that his sons would do Teshuva and be saved through that, so the only way he could have such a great desendent (or many great descendants, as the Medrash says) would be if he was to be that lone survivor.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your second point, I always understood the Medrash to mean Shmuel was as great as Moshe AND Aharon, meaning as great as the two combined.  If so, whatever Moshe and Aharon were worth, Shmuel was worth more, and he therefore saw himself as more qualified than them, not equally qualified.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The simple meaning of the Medrash is that he thought he would survive the attempt because such greatness is going to come from him (Shmuel and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11760&st=&pgnum=163&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">his own children</a>), and therefore it must be that he would be protected.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps another way to understand the Medrash is that he thought he had the same qualities as those descendants. He thought that he was equal to Moshe and Aharon, or even greater, since a descendant of his would be, and that his prophecy was certain, as he had such prophets as children.</p>\n\n<p>Shmuel prophesied (Shmuel I chapter 3) about the downfall of the existing Kohen Gadol who had been promised by Hashem that his descendants would hold the position forever. He thought he was able to accomplish the same thing with the existing Kohen Gadol. Shmuel went on to be the first king of Israel (Vayikra Rabbah 26:7), so he likewise thought he could dispose of Moshe's leadership, as Moshe had perhaps deviated just like Eli.</p>\n\n<p>So he thought that with such greatness to come from him, he was only equal or greater, and thus could not fail.</p>\n\n<p>All of this stemmed from Korach's self-centeredness. He couldn't imagine that his decedents would be greater than him.</p>\n\n<p>I saw another approach to answering this question recently, and that is that what Korach was saying was that everyone is equally holy, so the position of Kohen Gadol should be shared. There is no one special person that should hold the position until he dies, rather it should be a rotation, and he wanted to be part of that rotation.</p>\n\n<p>This answers the question simply: He wasn't trying to put himself above them, rather he was trying to be equal - Aaron could be Kohen Gadol for a while, and then others get a turn as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Why does this Midrash have to be Korach's motivation for the whole rebellion? Its actually Hashgacha Pratis that you ask this as I just asked this to a friend two days ago. This is sort of lengthy and I may be going out on a limb here but here it goes....</p>\n\n<p>We need to look at Rashi in order to understand this more clearly.</p>\n\n<p>Following Points</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is the Medrash Tanchuma coming to tell Korach's main motivation? I dont think so. This comment of Rashi comes after the fact Korach had led a rebellion already! So this wasnt his reason for starting the rebellion at the outset, rather Rashi gives a different reason for Korach's angst beforehand (See Rashi end of verse 1). </p></li>\n<li><p>So then what is this Midrash coming to teach about? Rashi brings this down in reference to why Korach didnt heed Moshe's voice when threatened with death. (See Rashi verse 7). This wasnt brought down to being the motivation for the rebellion because then why didnt Rashi mention this in verse 1?</p></li>\n<li><p>Another point of interest is why would Rashi question Korach's disobedience to Moshe's warnings? I mean Korach just led a whole rebellion right! \"For he warned them about it and they [still] took upon themselves to offer [the incense].\" Rashi verse 7. We can infer that Korach had at least a reverence for Moshe. After all he did accept the lineage from Moshe (see Rashi verse 1). Therefore he believed in a lineage and that he was next in line. When he saw that the lineage skipped him he felt he needed to do something about it! </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Therefore this brings us to...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Why mention Shmuel then? What does he have to do with it? Rashi mentions Shmuel's greatness in reference with Moshe and Aharon in order to justify Korach's motivation for that moment, ie continuing with the test. He respected Moshe's warnings, what if Korach was wrong, I mean the warnings are coming from Moshe right? I mean Moshe and Aharon are really holy guys right? Korach did respect that a holy lineage at least existed and that they were at the top of it right? Therefore to understand why he proceeded. We find that He saw a vision that Shmuel would come after him. Korach's opponents, Moshe and Aharon were great, but it would be represented again by Shmuel's greatness, Korach's descendants. It doesnt necessarily mean that Korach was greater because Shmuel was just as great, but that Korach would in fact not be ridding the world of Moshe and Aharon's greatness. We can infer that is why Rashi brings this down and asks why Korach didnt heed Moshe's voice in verse 7. I mean if Korach was just a simple troublemaker then why mention any of this? If Korach saw anyone else come from him, he wouldnt have gone along with it because he at least revered Moshe's greatness (See point above). But the fact that the greatness of both Moshe and Aharon would exist again from him, made him balance the decision to go forward with it. It was a logical justification for Korach's selfish actions.</p></li>\n<li><p>So why would this vision mean Korach would live? Well his children were involved in the rebellion. So if his sacrifice wouldnt be accepted then everyone would die right? So Korach's common sense says if his offspring will be alive then he will be alive because they are all involved together. And if Korach is alive, then his sacrifice is accepted. Little did Korach know that his children would do teshuva. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Maybe that is why Moshe is the real leader. Moshe always allowed for teshuva and in many scenarios worked to allow time for it. Even here in fact. Korach never even took it into account.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of it makes sense when thought about it logically but that still doesnt exonerate Korach. I mean the moment he started mocking Torah should itself have been a sign of his own obsession and nihilism. However Korach was a learned Jew so it shows the greater one is, the greater his ability is to fail. However also greater is his ability to succeed. </p>\n\n\n",

If you had a pile of rocks, you could count the rocks, and if you had a pile of apples you could count the apples.  However, if you have a pile of many different objects, you cannot count them without ignoring their differences (i.e. rocks and apples could be counted as objects, if you ignore their differences).  Counting Jews implies that they are all the same.  Therefore, counting leads to a plague, because if they are all the same, Hashem doesn't need so many of them.  The prohibition to count Jews is because of the recognition that every Jew is unique and irreplaceable.</p>\n\n<p>This would seemingly apply even if you mixed some non-Jews into the mix.  You couldn't count the unique objects just because there were other supposedly countable objects in the mix.  It would also imply that the prohibition would be once per counting, because you are showing the lack of recognition of their individuality no matter how high or low you count, or how many countable objects come in the middle.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do people keep saying 12 tribes of Israel when there are 13?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Encyclopædia Britannica article “<a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/610959/Twelve-Tribes-of-Israel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Twelve Tribes of Israel</a>” says (emphasis added),</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jacob’s first wife, Leah, bore him six sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi,\nJudah, Issachar, and Zebulun. <strong>Each was the father of a tribe.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s six tribes.</p>\n<p>The article continues,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Two other tribes, Gad and Asher, were named after sons born to Jacob\nand Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant. Two additional tribes, Dan and\nNaphtali, were named after sons of Jacob born of Bilhah, the\nmaidservant of Rachel, Jacob’s second wife. Rachel bore Jacob two\nsons, Joseph and Benjamin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s another six, to make a total of twelve.</p>\n<p>But Joseph produces two tribes, Efraim and Manasheh. There is no tribe of Joseph.</p>\n<p>So there are thirteen tribes in all.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Levi doesn’t count due to its lack of territory. But the article clearly says that Levi is a tribe. And then it goes on pretending that there are twelve tribes all along.</p>\n<p>Is my math correct?</p>\n<p>This has been bothering me for years since childhood. Why does nobody seem to think there is any problem? Your math is correct the Levites were the priests however both sons Mannassah and Ephraim came from Joseph and because they were brothers counted as 2 tribe</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 28)\n\n<p>Jacob had twelve sons, and on spiritual matters, we count those twelve. With Levi as one and Joseph as one. (That's for instance what you'd find on the High Priest's <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=28#C1674\">decision breastplate</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>On financial/land matters, however, Levi did his own thing, and Joseph got a double portion as his sons Ephraim and Menashe. For instance, there were spaces for twelve tribes forming a camp when they traveled in the desert -- Ephraim and Menashe each count as one -- but the Levites stayed inside of the ring of those twelve. Similarly when they got to Israel, a chunk of land was allocated to Ephraim, and another chunk to Menashe. The Levites just got scattered cities all over the land, with special rules.</p>\n\n<p>So: on spiritual matters: yes Levi, and Joseph=1, total =12.\nOn monetary matters: no Levi, and Joseph=2, total=12.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The Torah lists off the names of the tribes in multiple places. Every time, there are 12: either because Levi is counted, and Yosef is counted as one tribe, or because Levi is not counted, and in those cases Efraim and Menashe are both counted. Thus, we say '12' because that's clearly what the Torah is trying to do - emphasize that however you count the total should be 12</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your math is quite correct. Others have explained the details of how you get to twelve anyhow, in various different places in the Torah. In case you're also interested in <em>why</em>, there's a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Numbers.17.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">couple</a> of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Deuteronomy.33.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambans</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שנים עשר מטות. מטה אהרן הוא בי\"ב, כי לא אמר ותקח מטה לבית לוי ותכתוב\nעליו שם אהרן, אבל הוא במנין הנזכר, והנה לא נחשב יוסף רק לשבט אחד.\nוהטעם, כי לא ימנו שבטי ישראל לעולם רק שנים עשר, ומפני שיחשוב לוי יחשוב\nיוסף רק אחד. ועוד אפרש זה בסדר וזאת הברכה (דברים לג ו) אם יברכני ה'\nלהגיע לשם:\nThis is because the tribes of Israel are always twelve, and\nsince the tribe of Levi was counted among the twelve, Yosef had to be\ncounted as only one tribe. I will explain more about this in seder\nV’zos Habracha if Hashem blesses me to reach there. [Numbers 17:17]</p>\n<p>והנכון בעיני, כי הכתוב לא ימנה בשבטי ישראל רק שנים עשר, וכך אמר בברכת\nיעקב (בראשית מט כח) כל אלה שבטי ישראל שנים עשר. והנה יעקב הזכיר בניו\nהשנים עשר והזכיר יוסף בשבט אחד, ומשה ראה להזכיר ביוסף שני שבטים כמו\nשאמר (פסוק יז) והם רבבות אפרים והם אלפי מנשה, והיה זה בעבור שני דברים,\nהאחד כי אחר שצוה הקדוש ברוך הוא ועשאם שני שבטים בחנכת המזבח, ובדגלים,\nובנחלת הארץ, הנה הוא צריך למנותם שנים בברכתם, ועוד שהזכיר יהושע\nהמנחילם את הארץ והוא מאפרים הקטן והוצרך להזכיר אחיו שגדול ממנו    והנה\nרצה לברך את לוי כי מברכתו יתברכו כל ישראל, שיהיו קרבנותיו לרצון להם\nלפני השם, והוצרך להשאיר אחד מן השבטים שאינן נימנין בשום מקום רק שנים\nעשר, כנגד שנים עשר מזלות ברקיע, ושנים עשר חדשים בשנה, ושנים עשר גבולי אלכסונין,<br />\nThe correct explanation to me is that the Torah always\ncounts the tribes of Israel as twelve, as in the blessings of Yaakov,\nThese are the tribes of Israel, twelve. Behold, Yaakov counted his\nsons as twelve and mentioned Yosef as just one. Whereas Moshe wanted to\ncount the sons of Yosef as two [for the following reasons...] <em>And</em> he\nwanted to count Levi [for the following reasons...] - therefore he\nneeded to leave off one of the other tribes not to be counted. For never\nare the tribes anything but twelve, corresponding to the twelve\nconstellations in the heavens, and the twelve months of the year, and\nthe twelve diagonal directions... [Deuteronomy 33:6]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fascinating and of course needs more explanation. But one of the hidden parts of the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What exactly do Noahides do?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a modern \"Noahide\" movement(I believe propagated by the Lubavitcher Rebbe), where people join together to be b'nei noah and not part of another religion.  From some googling, I've seen that there are a fair amount of people on the web who identify religiously as Noahides.  My question is, given that the 7 Noahide laws are relatively easy to follow (even if there are of course issues in Noahide halachah), what exactly do members of the modern Noahide movement <em>do</em>?  For example, do they pray in an organized manner? If so, what forms do the prayers take?  Do they study Torah? (Are they allowed to study Torah?)  Or do they just follow the 7 rules?  Is there any sort of organized religion for Noahides?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Writing as a ben Noach, there is no definitive answer on what we do; only what we can't do(save setting up a court). Bnei Noach can do whatever they want as long as they don't transgress the seven. Brit Noach is a covenant of wild freedom, basically. For the details of the seven, I go by the Rambam, Hilchot Melachim Ch. 8-10.</p>\n\n<p>Since Brit Noach allows so much freedom, this doesn't mean you should be obnoxious, etc. particularly when living in a Jewish community. I don't put on tefillin, affix mezuzot, immerse in a mikvah, write Torah scrolls.</p>\n\n<p>My wife and I, although we are not commanded to, we do Jew-ish things either to fit into the community or just because we want to. I pray from the Siddur Tehillat haShem(nusach Arizal), go to Shabbat services, daven Shachrit, give tzedakah, study Rambam, Chassidut, study Hebrew, learn with a Rabbi, teach other bnei Noach, go to work, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Some bnei Noach just keep the seven and want to be left alone. Some want to be like gerim toshavim(although gerim toshavim are not halachically accepted today).</p>\n\n<p>Brit Noach is instituted to give the human soul freedom in how deep he wants to go with haShem without being bad in this physical world, basically.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>actually belief in G-d is part of those 7 commandments.</p>\n\n<p>here are the 7 listed and defined (copied and pasted from chabad.org)</p>\n\n<p>These are the Seven Noahide Laws, as enumerated in the Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 56a:</p>\n\n<p>1:carry out justice - An imperative to pursue and enforce social justice, and a prohibition of any miscarriage of justice.</p>\n\n<p>2:no blasphemy - Prohibits a curse directed at the Supreme Being.</p>\n\n<p>3: no idolatry - Prohibits the worship of any human or any created thing. Also prohibited is the making of idols and involvement with the occult. This necessitates an understanding of the One G-d of Israel and His nature.</p>\n\n<p>4:no illicit intercourse - Prohibits adultery, incest, homosexual intercourse and bestiality, according to Torah definitions.</p>\n\n<p>5:no homicide - Prohibits murder and suicide. Causing injury is also forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>6:no theft - Prohibits the wrongful taking of another's goods.</p>\n\n<p>7:don't eat a limb of a living creature - Promotes the kind treatment of animal life. It also encourages an appreciation for all kinds of life and respect for nature as G-d's creation.</p>\n\n<p>furthermore in addition to these 7 commandments there are things a Noahide should be encouraged to partake in including prayer (actually the no blasphemy is written as a positive to bless but the inverse is also understood from that not to curse either), charity, modesty, visiting the sick, honoring ones parents, and other good deeds which bring honor to G-d and peace between man kind.

Sometimes Islam. They're usually someone who already has a connection to the God of Abraham.</p>\n<p>Some Gentiles maybe used to go to church, weren't very religous, their families marked some holidays and life cycle events with a mild religious tone. They may hang around Jewish people and go to classes, if they happen to live near a Jewish community that offers them. They might occasionally go to a synagogue for Shabbos. Overall, they have a level of interest in Hashem and an affinity for the Jewish people. Some of these call themselves Noahides, some don't. Some of them haven't even heard of the term, like the rabbis who teach them.</p>\n<p>There's another group of people, many of whom were either ministers or deeply devoted followers of God, in accordance with their religion. In the process of deepening their relationship with God, they found issues and inconsistencies in their belief systems. This developed into a choice: either leave or embrace cognitive dissonance and believe what you're supposed to believe, regardless of the evidence. Those with a conscience allow their belief systems to crash, but hold onto Hashem with both hands. They hold onto the God of the Jews because of what He did at Sinai, because without Him, they would indeed be lost.  These are the Noahides I know.</p>\n<p>What they DO.\nThey love God with all their heart, soul and strength. They love their neighbor as themselves. This is reflected in the things they do. They give to the poor - online and on the street. They visit the sick. In doing so, they believe God is proud of them.</p>\n<p>They study Torah. Not like you, but they study. They study the Psalms and Proverbs. They study the Prophets and yearn for Moschiah, for the knowledge of God to fill the earth.</p>\n<p>They pray. Again, not like you, but they pray. For them, emunah is more important than repetition, so their prayers are most often personal. They have prayer books and use them, some use this as a way to learn to direct their thoughts toward God in a disciplined way. Some use it to learn how to pray or teach others how to pray. Books like \"The Garden of Enumah\" by R. Shalom Gold/R. Lazer Brody tend to mean a lot to them.</p>\n<p>Some homeschool their children to give them a God-fearing foundation. They're honest in their businesses and relationships. They're faithful to their wives and husbands.</p>\n<p>Some form groups for association, study and worship meetings. Some can be like chapels, others might be like an informal shul. Groups are very rare. Some might convert, but most don't live around Jews.</p>\n<p>Some Noahides establish ordaining bodies, appoint clergy and these lead groups. They do marriages, funerals, pastoral counseling. Some become chaplains in healthcare. Some groups are working to have Noahides recognized in the military and will someday send chaplains there, too.</p>\n<p>Noahides are a diverse group. They're good people who love God, their fellow man, and are more concerned about doing the right thing than just being right.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm finding it difficult to understand this. First of all \n what issur did the Nazir do? The Nazir did a mitzvah by taking upon himself the nazirite oath. And secondly even if you want to find a way to say that the Nazir needs atonement, a Korban Chatas is only for someone that sins by accident, an example would be if a person forgot it was the sabbath and did one of the 39 biblical sabbath prohibitions by accident. However in this case, the Nazir knowingly and willfully takes upon himself the nazirite oath. So why does he bring a Chatas?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Ramban (Numbers 6:14) writes that the Nazir is sinning by leaving his elevated state, i.e. the sacrifice is for <em>ending</em> the state of being a Nazir.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>על דרך הפשט, כי האיש הזה חוטא נפשו במלאת הנזירות, כי הוא עתה נזור מקדושתו ועבודת השם, וראוי היה לו שיזיר לעולם ויעמוד כל ימיו נזיר וקדוש לאלקיו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam sees in the Nazir support for his approach that a person should not go to extremes.  Shemoneh Perakim ch. 4:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאָמְנָם כִּוְנָה לִהְיוֹת הָאָדָם טִבְעִי הוֹלֵךְ בַּדֶּרֶךְ הָאֶמְצָעִי: יאֹכַל מַהשֶּׁיֵּשׁ לוֹ לֶאֱכֹל - בְּשִׁוּוּי, וְיִשְׁתֶּה מַהשֶּׁיֵּשׁ לוֹ לִשְׁתּוֹת - בְּשִׁוּוּי, וְיִבְעַל מַהשֶּׁמֻתָּר לוֹ לִבְעֹל - בְּשִׁוּוּי, וְיִשְׁכֹּן בַּמְּדִינוֹת בְּיֹּשֶׁר וּבֶאֱמוּנָה; לֹא שֶׁיִּשְׁכֹּן בְּמִדְבָּרִיּוֹת וּבֶהָרִים, וְלֹא שֶׁיִּלְבַּשׁ הַצֶּמֶר וְהַשֵּׂעָר, וְלֹא שֶׁיְּעַנֶּה גוּפוֹ. וְהִזְהִירָה מִזֶּה, לְפִי מַה שֶּׁבָּא בְקַבָּלָה. נֶאֱמַר בְּנָזִיר: \"וְכִפֶּר עָלָיו מֵאֲשֶׁר חָטָא עַל הַנָּפֶשׁ\" (במדבר ו יא). וְאָמְרוּ רַבּוֹתֵינוּ, זִכְרוֹנָם לִבְרָכָה: \"וְכִי עַל אֵיזֶה נֶפֶשׁ חָטָא זֶה? - אֶלָּא עַל שֶׁצִּעֵר עַצְמוֹ מִן הַיָּיִן. וַהֲלֹא דְבָרִים קַלוָחֹמֶר: מַהזֶּה שֶׁצִּעֵר עַצְמוֹ מִן הַיָּיִן - צָרִיךְ כַּפָּרָה, הַמְצַעֵר עַצְמוֹ מִכָּל דָּבָר וְדָבָר עַל אַחַת כַּמָּה וְכַמָּה\" (תענית יא א) א.</p>\n<p>(paraphrased) A person should go on the middle path, eat, drink, etc. with a balance, and don't afflict one's self.  This is seen from the Nazir, about which the Sages said \"Upon what soul did he sin?  Rather, he afflicted himself by abstaining from wine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In answer to your second question, accidental sin (שוגג) is not the only case of a Chatas.  For example, a woman brings a Chatas after she gives birth (Vayikra 12:6).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּבִמְלֹאת יְמֵי טָהֳרָהּ, לְבֵן אוֹ לְבַת, תָּבִיא כֶּבֶשׂ בֶּן-שְׁנָתוֹ לְעֹלָה וּבֶן-יוֹנָה אוֹ-תֹר לְחַטָּאת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi to Bereishis 31:39 relates the word חטא to חסרון, a lack, as in the verse קולע אבן אל השערה ולא יחטיא (Shoftim 20:16).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אנכי אחטנה: לשון (שופטים כ טז) קולע באבן אל השערה ולא יחטיא, (מ\"א א כא) אני ובני שלמה חטאים, חסרים, אנכי אחסרנה, אם חסרה חסרה לי, שמידי תבקשנה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nefesh HaChaim in 1:6 says the same thing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי חטא פי' חסרון כידוע.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Nazir creates a void in his closeness to Hashem by going down, and the woman has a void in her spiritual state with the loss of life from within her, and they bring a Chatas to rectify the void.</p>\n<p>Alternatively (based on the verse from Shoftim), חטא could mean being off-target, or veering off.  The Nazir brings a Chatas for veering off of the spiritual path that he is on.  According to the Rambam, this could be understood as having veered off of the middle path.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I think that there are two general approached to why the Nazir brings a chatas upon completion of his nezirus: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>One opinion in the Gemara (Taanis 11a), R. Elazar Hakapr, does state that the nazir is regarded as a sinner and brings a sacrifice to atone for his sin. The gemara states that the nazir's sin is that 'he abstained from wine', an opinion taken up by the Rambam (Shemoneh Perakim ch. 4 and Hil. Deos 3:1). The Ramban (to Bamidbar 6:14), however, believes that his sin is the opposite - he was on such a lofty level before, and now he is returning to a less elevated state. According to both of these opinions, it's easy to see that while the 'sin' isn't accidental, it isn't technically a sin either - according to the Ramban, the 'sin' is just being normal. In terms of severity level, it makes sense that such a 'sinner' is like one who does so accidently. (I should add that, actually, the korban chatas isn't exclusively for sinning accidentally. See Keriesus 9a which gives a list for the korbanos that are brought for sinning even intentionally.) </p></li>\n<li><p>It could be, however, that a korban chatas is not always brought for a sin, but for other reasons as well. (I'll suggest two possibilities, but there are more) </p>\n\n<p>A] R. Hirsch suggests that the Chatas is brought not for a <em>past</em> sin, but as a way of strengthening the nazir's resolve to never sin again, even after he returns to normal life. The nazir, according to R. Hirsch, is not meant to be a permanent status but a means of re'acclimating oneself to identify with the lofty goals of the Jewish people, with the ultimate objective of being able to join the rest of them.</p>\n\n<p>B] 'Chatas' may mean something other than 'sin'. In the context of the Red Heifer (Bamidbar 19:9), the word 'chatas' unambiguously refers to purification. Likewise, the woman who gives birth, as well as the zav and metzora, are required to bring sacrifices before they can partake in eating kodshim, and one of those sacrifices is a 'chatas'. Based on this, it appears that a chatas is brought for purification. Even though the nazir isn't being purified, this idea can be broadened to say that a chatas is brought whenever a person is changing their status to a more permanent one, purification being one example. Support for this idea can be seen from the fact that the kohanim, at their time of their initiation ceremony, brought korbanos chatas (Vayikra 9:2 among other places).

(See introduction to Chelek, Hilchos Teshuva 9:2, and Iggeres Hatechiya where the Rambam makes these points.) They will then be able to perform <em>mitzvos</em> with more focus and dedication, and learn Torah with greater understanding. With this newer, greater achievement of Torah and <em>mitzvos</em>, they will go back to Olam Haba (where they had been since the time they died until they were resurrected) to experience an even higher level of reward (Iggeres HaTechiya).</p>\n\n<p>In Hil.

However, is there a specific mitzvah or chiyuv to actually do something (including prayer) that hastens the coming of Mashiach? I'm sure I've seen this discussed but I can't remember where. It may have been in religious Zionist/anti-Zionist literature, because part of the debate involves whether or not the founding of Jewish settlements in Israel would hasten or slow the redemption process.</p>\n\n<p>I've heard Rabbi Hershel Schachter (of YU) say that the source for this idea is that the Gemara (Yevamos 62a) implies that we're supposed to have children in order to fill the quota of Jews born in order to hasten redemption, but I've never seen that written anywhere. </p>\n\n<p>(I don't think that this is a duplicate of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28682/do-a-mitzva-for-mashiach\">this question</a>, which is asking about doing any mitzvah with the intention of hastening Mashiach, but it's a subtle difference)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I think in many ways the question answers itself in the first sentence. \"... if we identify with the Torah's way of life.\"</p>\n\n<p>Would anyone propose that that is optional? That according to the Torah it is OK to not identify with a Torah way of life? (We see its identification with a Torah way of life from the many statements in the Rambam about how the Chachamim desired Moshiach to be free to live a Torah life without interference, among other places).</p>\n\n<p>But in terms of specifics, if doing something includes prayer, then it is an obligation to pray three times a day, and during the weekdays that prayer includes at least 4 blessings referencing and requesting various aspects of Moshiach and the messianic era.

No one else can shoulder this burden for him: his own efforts and energy are needed. Each of us must prepare for the coming of Mashiach by increasing his study of the Torah and enhancing his performance of its commandments behiddur, in a beautiful and conscientious manner.</p>\n  \n  <p>Why is it that these are the activities which will hasten Mashiach's coming? -- Because they are intrinsically parallel to the manner in which Mashiach will relate to the Jewish people.</p>\n  \n  <p>-- The Lubavitcher Rebbe</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By the way, some people might claim that this idea that the Rambam is saying that there is an obligation to want/Anxiously await Moshiach is the Lubavitcher Rebbe's innovation, but I have seen <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchok_Zev_Soloveitchik\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Yitzchok Zev Solovetchik</a> quoted (<a href=\"http://www.aharit.com/A-01.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here footnote 3</a>) as saying the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>The explicit extension into action (not really action, but rather infusing something we would already be obligated to do with that intention and making that a motivation for the action) is something that is perhaps more unique to Chabad Chassidus, although not just the most recent Lubavitcher Rebbe, as you find such a concept alluded to in Tanya as well as other places.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A source that we should pray for Moshiach's coming:</p>\n\n<p>Rambam Introduction to Perek Chelek, Yesod 12, Kappach translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>היסוד השנים עשר, ימות המשיח</strong>. והוא להאמין וּלְאַמֵּת שיבוא, ואין לומר שנתאחר, \"אִם יִתְמַהְמָהּ חַכֵּה לוֹ\" (חבקוק ב ג) ... <strong>ולהתפלל לבואו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation of bold words - The twelfth principle is the days of the Messiah... <strong>and pray for his coming</strong>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I refer to an interesting episode, which was recorded by Rabbi Shmuel Baruch Shulman of Yerushalayim, who was present at a meeting between Rabbi Avraham Yitzchok Hakohen Kook, the chief rabbi of Israel, and Rabbi Yitzchok Yosef Schneerson (the 6th Lubavitcher rebbe). </p>\n\n<p>The meeting occurred in the summer of 1929, when the latter visited Israel.

Just as in all matters that depend on Heaven, it is incumbent on us to do “hishtadlus” to the best of our ability to help bring the matter into reality, so too regarding the future redemption, it is the sacred duty of every Jew to do a concrete action, so to speak, to “help” Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>[Rav Kook] emphasized the statement of Chazal “In the future, a Heavenly voice will blast the mountain tops, saying, anyone who worked with Hashem should come and take his reward”. Meaning that along with our looking forward to salvation, we also need to do actions on our part, to “work with Hashem”.</p>\n\n<p>We see that there has been a long standing debate regarding the question of, is action required on our part to help bring the future redemption. Those rabbis that believe that we need to take an active role in creating the messianic era, are echoing Rav Kook’s position.</p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note the “well known” (6th) Lubavitcher rebbe’s position, as quoted by Rabbi Shulman, which advocated a more passive approach. Contrast this with the current Lubavitcher approach, which is to attempt to hasten the final redemption, and their mission is centered on this goal.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=12076&st=&pgnum=33\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew text</a></strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואח׳׳כ עברה השיחה על עניני הגאולה העתידה לבא במהרה בימינו, ושיטת\n  <strong>האדמו״ר מלובאוויטש</strong> היא כידוע שזהו מן הדברים שאנחנו צריכים <strong>לא לעשות שום פעולות ולחכות לחסדי השי״ת</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>הרבה רבנו [<strong>הגראי\"ה קוק</strong>] בראיות הפוכות כמו שבכל הענינים התלוים בידי\n  שמים עלינו להשתדל בכל היכולת לעזור ולהוציא מן הכח אל הפועל, כן גם\n  בעניני הגאולה העתידה חובה קדושה מוטלת על אדם מישראל לעשות איזו פעולה\n  ממשית ולעזור כביכול להשי״ת.

    "content": "# On the gender of the implied \"פַּעַם שֵׁנִי\" in Esther 2:14\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3302.htm#14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Ester</em> 2:14</a> speaks of each candidate for the title of queen consort:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בָּעֶרֶב הִיא בָאָה וּבַבֹּקֶר הִיא שָׁבָה אֶל בֵּית הַנָּשִׁים שֵׁנִי</p>\n<p>In the evening she would arrive and in the morning she would return to the harem second</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The \"שֵׁנִי/second\" is unclear. <em>Rashi</em> says the phrase means \"to the second harem\". <em>Ibn Ezra</em> and <em>Minchas Shay</em>, on the other hand, say it means \"to the harem a second time\" — but they parse the phrase differently from one another:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>According to <em>ibn Ezra</em>, \"שֵׁנִי\" means \"פַּעַם שֵׁנִי/a second time\". Even though \"פַּעַם\" is usually a feminine noun and \"שֵׁנִי\" a masculine adjective, so they don't go together, here \"פַּעַם\" is masculine.</li>\n<li>According to <em>Minchas Shay</em>,  \"שֵׁנִי\" means \"פַּעַם שֵׁנִי/a second time\". Even though \"פַּעַם\" is usually a feminine noun and \"שֵׁנִי\" a masculine adjective, so they don't go together, here \"שֵׁנִי\" is feminine.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is that a general rule? That is, when the genders of a noun and its adjective don't match, does <em>ibn Ezra</em> reinterpret the noun (where possible) and <em>Minchas Shay</em> (or whomever he's quoting) reinterpret the adjective (where possible)?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If so, why? What's the reason for that underlying rule?</li>\n<li>If not, why does each interpret <em>this</em> verse according to that rule?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Apologies in advance that this answer is based on anecdotal evidence.  I have not done a systematic study of either <em>ibn Ezra</em> or <em>Minchas Shai</em>, but have searched through the texts as best as possible.</p>\n\n<p>In all the examples I can find, <em>ibn Ezra</em> discusses the gender of the noun as being different than usual, rather than assert that the \"incorrect\" gender of adjective (or whatever object is under consideration) is used.  See, for example, <em>ibn Ezra</em> to Gen 2:15, Ex 35:17 (short commentary), Micah 6:9, Eccl 10:15, among others.  As noted in my comment, <em>ibn Ezra</em> did not write the commentary on Nechemia bearing his name (it was written by Moses Kimchi, brother of the <em>Radak</em>), and thus the comment on Nech 3:30 asserting that שני should be read שנית, as with Esther 2:14, is not a contradiction.  For what it's worth, the examples <em>ibn Ezra</em> point to lend credence to his assertions.</p>\n\n<p>I have not seen <em>Minchas Shai</em> refer to a noun as sometimes masculine and sometimes feminine.  He does repeat his comment from Esther 2:15 in Nechemia 3:30, but I don't see any other independent examples of this type of comment.</p>\n\n<p><em>Minchas Shai</em> doesn't comment on Ex 35:17, but it's possible that it was so obvious that הצר is being used both as a feminine and a masculine noun in that <em>pasuk</em> that it didn't bear comment. It is thus possible that he doesn't fundamentally disagree with <em>ibn Ezra</em>.  My own thoughts are that <em>ibn Ezra</em> is more-or-less well supported in his assertions, and claiming that the noun is of a different gender is easier than saying that the \"wrong\" declension was used.</p>\n\n<p>I also think that we simply don't have enough data from <em>Minchas Shai</em> to decide definitively what his approach was.  However, I think the silence in the places where you might expect a comment (like Ex 35:17) would indicate that in general his approach is as <em>ibn Ezra</em>, but that in the two aforementioned places, he finds it impossible to follow this approach.  I would argue that for in Nechemia, מדה שנית has been used so many times in the same chapter that it seems impossible to suggest that מדה has switched genders.  Then in Esther, partially supported by the example in Nechemia, and partially by 2 Samuel 23:8 (where the adjective is changed to feminine by a קרי/כתיב, viz. פעם אחד gets a קרי of פעם אחת), he feels it more sensible to change the adjective than the noun.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note: in the particular case of the implied פעם in Esther 2:14, the <a href=\"http://biblehub.com/hebrew/6471.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">BDB</a> holds that the masculine use of פעם from Judges 16:28 quoted by <em>ibn Ezra</em> as support for his comment is a textual corruption, along with the other instances of masculine פעם. Neither <em>ibn Ezra</em> nor <em>Minchas Shai</em> has anything to say on the other places where פעם seems to be masculine (at least, nothing to say that's survived the years).</p>\n\n\n",

In the end, he has to make  the decision for himself, so can the prayer influence somehow his free will?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Berachos 10a says that (at the advice of his wife Beruriah) Rebbi Meir prayed for neighbors of his to become religious, and the Gemara seems to approve of this. This is also implied by Sotah 14a, where Moshe is said to daven for the wicked to return, as well as in Taanis 23b, where Abba Chilkiyah says that his wife is more righteous because she prays that the wicked should repent. Additionally, R. Yehudah Hachasid (Sefer Chassidim no. 76) and R. Avraham ben Harambam (Hamaspik LeOvdei Hashem, ch. on bitachon) both advice praying for the wicked to repent as proper things to do (though R. Avraham may have a few caveats)</p>\n\n<p>The Maharsha on Brachos asks, 'how is it possible to pray for someone to do teshuvah, isn't that a violation of their free will'? He himself doesn't give an answer, but R. Moshe Feinstein, in a letter to R. Efraim Greenblatt (Igros Moshe O.C. IV 40:13), mentions an idea from Rav Greenblatt that prayer can indeed 'turn' a person, or change his will, so to speak, and since it's coming through prayer of earthly beings that isn't a violation of הכל בידי שמים חוץ מיראת שמים because it isn't 'from Heavan', it's from earth. A similar explanation is given by the Chazon Ish (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14336&st=&pgnum=509\" rel=\"nofollow\">in a note printed towards the end of Orach Chaim</a>). </p>\n\n<p>R. Moshe Feinstein himself, however, rejects this interpretation, insisting that nothing can override the ability for free will. Therefore, he explains the Gemara that supports praying for others to repent as a prayer for them to either not be tested or for them to hear inspiring mussar, which will likely inspire them to repent. The actual repentance and yiras shamayim, however, is all up to the individual. <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/archives/1811\" rel=\"nofollow\">This online article</a> also quotes the Shu\"t Meil Tzedaka, R. Yonah Landsofer, who has a similar view to that of R. Moshe. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Sotah 14a also implies that Mosheh prayed for others to repent, and Sefer Chareidim (Teshuvah Ch. 5) writes that it is a mitzvah to do so. Rav Ovadiah Yosef (Yalkut Yosef O.C. Vol 5 pg. 64) quotes a story regarding the Arizl, who told the Alshich that he should pray for his son, who had apostatized, to return to Judaism. Not only that, but he seems to have advised everyone that it would be appropriate to pray for others to become more religious.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>is it ok?!?</p>\n\n<p>ITS A TREMENDOUS MITZVAH! we say every day \"hashiveinu avinu lesorasecha\" 3x a day.</p>\n\n<p>Sefardi siddurim within this bracha have a place to add the name of someone who needs to repent and a small bakasha.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the chazon ish has a nusach for a teffilah which deals with the issue of \"hakol byedei shaymayim chutz m'yiras shamayim\".

An Almana, widow, is not allowed to be married to a Kohen Gadol (see Mishna Yevamos 9:2). However, what defines a widow?

But suppose the man dies without having biah with his wife: Do we say that this woman cannot marry a Kohen Gadol because she is an Almana(in the simple sense that she was married then her husband die), or is it necessary that she have had biah with her husband before he died that would label her an Almana and ultimately, unable to marry the Kohen Gadol?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>The mishna in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h31.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Y'vamos</em></a> (6:4) indicates that a widow is forbidden to a Kohein Gadol whether she was a widow only from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erusin\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>erusin</em></a> (when intimacy was still forbidden) or whether she was a widow even from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_wedding\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>nisu'in</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כוהן גדול לא יישא את האלמנה--בין אלמנה מן האירוסין בין אלמנה מן הנשואין. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is quoted as <em>halacha</em> by the Rambam (<em>Hil.

The <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/40629/5151\">answer</a> there says that you should use \"a cloth and not merely one's hand, because a person's own flesh can't be considering a covering for itself.\"</p>\n\n<p>What is the status of a non-cloth covering, such as putting your head on your watch?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>All covering which is not part of the body is good for covering, <strong>even non cloth</strong>  see  Magen Avraham OC 131, 1  sk 2,  because there are good chatsitsa,  (as not part of the body)  :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(ב) להטות:    טעם ההטיה כמ\"ש ס\"ח ובהגה\"ה ומ\"מ נוהגין להפסיק בבגד דיד לא חשיב כיסוי  <strong>דמין במינו אין חוצץ</strong>  כמ\"ש סימן צ\"ח:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The hand is not regarded as covering because he is from the  \"self species\"   as the head. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A watch is  \"from an other species\",  so it can cover the head.  </p>\n\n<p>What is the size of the watch?  Seems perhaps too small. .</p>\n\n<p>See Gemara Berachot 24b  at the end of the Amud and see Bet Yosef OC 74 below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתב ה\"ר יונה בשם רבני צרפת שאם האדם מחבק גופו בזרועותיו דיינינן ליה  <strong>כהפסקה</strong>  מבגד ומותר ואפילו לפי מה שכתבתי בסמוך בשם אור זרוע ותרומת הדשן שאם מכסה לבו בידיו כדי שלא יהא רואה את הערוה לא חשיב  <strong>כיסוי</strong>  אפשר דמודו בהא דשאני כיסוי ביד דכיון דלב ויד <strong>חד גופא</strong>  אינון אין הגוף יכול לכסות את עצמו  <strong>אבל לענין הפסק אפשר דמפסיק אע\"ג דחד גופא אינון:</strong>‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bet Yosef makes a distinction between covering and separating, the same body may separate two areas (the one don't more see the other) but not to cover an area which needs to be covered because of Isur ervat davar. Baer  Heytev reported that  maharam Tiveli disagreed and said that a fortiori if covering is impossible, separating is also impossible.  But  Magen Avraham and Mishna Berura followed the Shulchan Aruch. </p>\n\n<p>For Tachanun covering is needed,  so the hand cannot cover. </p>\n\n<p>The only Hava Amina to say that a non cloth object is not  kisui is its non constant status.  But concerning Tachanun the clothes don't cover constantly the face.  So,  no problem with non cloth covering.  Additionally the problem is not really min bemino but \"גוף אחד\"  \"the same body \"  </p>\n\n<h3>Every external object is not \"the same body\"  and can be used .</h3>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The reason for leaning forward when saying <em>tachanun</em> is that one should fall on one's face in shame for sins committed. The Arizal held the hand was not enough of a cover and one should use one's arm (not the tefillin arm). However one should not use one's bare flesh, as one's arm cannot sufficiently be a cover for one's face when leaning forward. In my siddur it mentions a sleeve or tallis but that assumes one is wearing a talis and one isn't wearing a short sleeve shirt. According to many, ideally one would be wearing a jacket during davening which would solve that problem but not everyone does. But then again neither does everyone hold like that Arizal that the hand is not enough of a cover for tachanun. Assuming that one is in the position of using one's forearm and having a short sleeve shirt it could be that one would be able to use anything to cover one's arm such as a paper towel. I don't think the watch would be a sufficient cover if the hand is not. While I haven't seen a source for it would there be any reason one couldn't rest one's forehead on an object such as a chair or edge of a table in this situation?</p>\n\n\n",

Does this mean Shimon HaTzaddik is the first tanna? </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have a source that says this explicitly? I remember seeing this once, but cannot locate it now.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Depends on what you mean by \"Tanna\".</p>\n\n<p>Generally, in classic sources, the Anshei K'nesses HaGedola refers to the generation of Ezra and Nechemya that built the new community in Israel. Then Shimon HaTzaddik was the last surviving member of that generation. (This creates some chronology problems, but let's take this as a given anyway.)</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Tannaim</em> is the name for the Sages of the Mishna. That is, the earliest point that can be considered a source for the statement compiled into the Mishna. What results is that this whole thing is a matter of classification. Shimon HaTzaddik was the bridge between the Anshei K'nesses HaGedola (which would be the end of the Biblical/Prophetic era) and the Tannaim (the Mishnaic era). So which does he belong to?</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37939&st=&pgnum=58\">Rambam</a> seems to count him as the first of the tannaim (or \"Chachmei HaMishna\"). <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=5306&st=&pgnum=25&hilite=\">Abarbanel</a> considers him part of the previous generation (that of Nechemya) and starts the generations of Tannaim with Antignos. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37946&st=&pgnum=500\">Machzor Vitry</a> doesn't start considering anyone Tannaim until Hillel and Shammai; everyone before is just \"the Sages that lived from generation to generation\" between Biblical and Mishnaic times.</p>\n\n<p>The point is, though, that it doesn't really matter. Everyone cited above agrees about who Shimon HaTzaddik was, when he lived, and what he said. It's just a matter of when do I start calling people \"Tannaim\"? And that's just about keeping track of classifications.</p>\n\n\n",

In it he described how the practice of other religious magazines at the time (1980's) was to not include pictures of women (or girls) of any kind on the cover. The interview goes on to describe how the Lubavitcher Rebbe (who reviewed every issue before publication) insisted on including a picture of a girl on every cover, even if the theme of the cover (like a boy's room) didn't really fit.</p>\n\n<p>I later found (with pictures of the relevant covers, including a before and after of the boy's room) a similar description of the story here of the covers <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/161694/jewish/Putting-Women-in-the-Picture.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here towards the end of the article</a>, with a different (perhaps complimentary) description of the nature of the objection that had nothing to do with the content of other magazines.</p>\n\n<p>I also notice that magazines like <a href=\"http://www.mishpacha.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishpacha</a> and <a href=\"http://amimagazine.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ami</a> never include pictures of women, even in the section written by and targeted to women - never a picture of the author or any female subject of the story.

Kellner takes for granted that Rambam rejected (what was taught as) kabbalah of his day, and his book 'shows' how much of the Rambam's writings were aimed at presenting an alternative to kabbalah. You could read his book as indirectly proving that the Rambam rejected kabbalah, because if he's writing with an anti-kabbalah agenda he obviously rejected it. However, in my mind, Kellner's book still doesn't prove anything conclusively.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, the scholarly consensus is that the Rambam rejected kabbalah, or what he knew of it, and not just because he writes in a teshuvah (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1730&pgnum=215\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Blau ed.

The Rambam's whole outlook doesn't seem to fit with many of the tenets of kabbalah, at least of what we know of it from that time. While you're right that these things were kept under wraps by those who knew them, the Rambam states in the introduction (and throughout) Moreh Nevuchim that in his book he is revealing the secrets of מעשה בראשית and מעשה מרכבה as he understands them, and they certainly don't look like kabbalah. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is all kind of tenuous because we can't be sure how to read the kabbalistic works just because we have the texts. Maybe we're reading them incorrectly, as many authentic mekubalim (like R. Yaakov Hillel) of today will tell you that certain terms are codes for certain concepts, and that the mekubalim speak metaphorically, etc... This is especially so because later mekubalim actually did use the Moreh Nevuchim and picked up some of the Rambam's terminology here and there. </p>\n\n<p>(For the sake of completeness, however, I should mention that there are two letters supposedly written by the Rambam which do in fact praise the kabbalah, though scholars have dismissed them as forgeries. One of them is quoted by the Migdal Oz to the first chapter of Hil. Yisodei HaTorah, where the Rambam is said to have discovered kabbalah later in life, and another well known one published in R. Shilat’s edition of the Rambam's letters, pg. 695. See there where he discusses the veracity of the letter)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>The tanya gives lots of kabalistic sources for laws of the Ramabam.</p>\n<p>Moreh Nevuchim reasons for mitzvot parallel etz chaim.

(It was explained to me that the greatness that the Gemara attributes was because even though she \"got the chance\" to do that which would be otherwise prohibited, she did not take the opportunity to savor it and she took no pleasure from it, as the Gemara explains).  Nodeh B'Yehuda Tinyana Yoreh De'ah 161 makes basically the same point, and he specifically points out that this was not just an allowance of \"saving a life\" (Pikuach nefesh), as adultery is not permitted for that purpose, but was a specific exception of saving the entire Jewish people.  He suggests that the proof for this is from Ester, who also submitted herself to extramarital relations for the salvation of the entire Jewish nation.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the justification was the salvation of the entire Jewish nation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Aside from the more widespread 'Aveira Lishma' angle discussed above, it is also worth noting the more metaphorical approach taken in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.585.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni 585</a> where it says that she covered Sisera with the שמיכה, 'cover' (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.4.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 4:18</a>) which can be homiletically understood as שמי כה - <em>My Name is here</em>.

    "title": "If a restaurant is already halal, how much more work is it for them to become kosher?",
    "content": "# If a restaurant is already halal, how much more work is it for them to become kosher?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a middle-eastern restaurant<sup>1</sup> (independent, not chain) near my workplace that my coworkers think highly of.  Today I learned that it is <em>halal</em> (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/26688/472\">some info about what that means</a>), which got me wondering whether there'd be any chance of them taking the extra steps to go from <em>halal</em> to <em>kosher</em>.  I understand that <em>halal</em> doesn't have restrictions on mixing meat and dairy, so that's one issue, but what about the rest?  Would the supervision required for <em>kashrut</em> be comparable to that required for <em>halal</em> (so from their point of view it'd be swapping one certifying authority for another), or are we much more stringent, invasive, and/or expensive?  What would it take for them to move from where they are now to being kosher?</p>\n\n<p>It might not be practical, but if it's a small change I'm considering asking them about it.  (This would bring kosher food to our business district.)  But I want to be armed with reliable information first about what it would mean for them.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not asking about how going kosher would affect their <em>halal</em> status (that's a question for a different site).  I'm asking what the considerations are for getting from where they are -- closer to kosher than a random restaurant but not there -- to kosher.</p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> Shish-kebabs, shwarma, falafel, rice/lentils, salads, etc.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>My understanding of Halal (and therefore take that with a significant grain of salt - but I did <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Islamic_and_Jewish_dietary_laws\" rel=\"nofollow\">read an article</a> about it once) is that it would actually make things more complicated. The supervision would be duplicative, and the issues, while overlapping are not fully satisfied. And it would only be possible if something about the Halal certification was accepting Kosher as a substitute for the meat, at least.</p>\n\n<p>To elaborate, Kosher supervision won't accept Halal visits as having any impact on Kosher, so there would be no savings in the supervision level. In fact, in the case of a meat restaurant they would probably be signing up for full time supervision. I'm not aware of any certification that would do less than that in this context, but I could be missing something.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think there is any meat sold which is simultaneously Halal and Kosher. There are slaughter houses which produce both, but not with the same cow. If there were, it would have to be one slaughtered by a Jewish Shochet. Which means that the Halal certification would have to accept that. If the full time supervision was not enough of a deal breaker, I would think this would be fatal.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to all of this, all of the ingredient restrictions that would come with Kosher would be on top of the major additional one for Halal - no alcohol. The most obvious ingredient from that menu that would be impacted would be vinegar (assuming they use any).</p>\n\n<p>So the upshot is, that unless the demand for Halal is satisfied by the place being Kosher plus maybe a Halal certification that will go along with the Kosher ingredients or an owner being a good Muslem and regarded by his customers as reliable about not including alcohol, it would seem that going Kosher would be made worse by having to be doubly concerned with the Halal. A better starting point may be a place that has no certification at all.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://muslimmatters.org/2012/06/22/is-kosher-meat-%E1%B8%A5alal-a-comparison-of-the-halakhic-and-shar%CA%BFi-requirements-for-animal-slaughter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Islamic opinion</a>, it is generally acceptable for a Muslim to eat kosher meat, so if the restaurant underwent kosher supervision, it would no longer need halal supervision.  (However, it is worth noting that the article below notes that some Muslims may not agree with this, and it will all depend on the religious preferences of the owners)</p>\n\n<p>So, the answer to your question is that it is no easier for a halal restaurant to become kosher than any other restaurant, given that halal generally doesn't extend to the length of the details of kashrut, but if the restaurant were to become kosher, it would still be acceptable for most Muslims to eat there.  </p>\n\n\n",

When they came into Israel, life would revert to a less miraculous existence - thus they had to conquer the land with wars and such.  Some commentaries explain this was the motivation of the spies to support not entering the land.</p>\n\n<p>So, while they are in the desert, the mon stayed inside them and did not need to be relieved.  However, this was part of the miracle.  Upon entering Eretz Yisrael, they assumed, the miracle would end, the mon inside of them would suddenly all need to be relieved, and they would literally explode.  There fears were only now upon the cusp of leaving their miraculous existence.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Devarim 8:3 explains the true purpose of the mohn:</p>\n\n<p>\"He afflicted you and starved you and fed you the mohn that you did not know and that your fathers did not know.

I have trouble understanding his full explanation - it is lengthy. But the important part I could decipher is that the mohn was considered the food the angels ate (I assume the source of this is Midrash). He points out that there are foods that are healthy for both the healthy and sick and foods that are OK for only the healthy and not the sick. Since the beginning of this verse states that God starved us first and then fed us the mohn, the people assumed that they were sick and since the mohn was hard to digest, it would be harmful to them.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that I have \"translated\" at least somewhat correctly what the Ohr Hachaim stated, there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Sorotzkin points out that for most of the forty years, they were able to deal with the people among whom they passed and buy provisions from them. Thus, they supplemented the mon with \"natural food\" which did cause \"refuse\". We see this from the command to take a digging tool with them to make a latrine. As they approached Canaan, the merchants began bringing food from Canaan. At this point the curse of \"not seeing the good of the land\" took effect. Had those lesft of the ones who were being punished for the sin of the meraglim even smelled the food, they would have died at once. In order to preserve the lives of those approaching 60 (the last of that generation), the Bnei Yisrael cut off all contact with the merchant caravans that were coming to trade with them and subsisted on only the man. This gave rise to the complaints .</p>\n\n<p>They are called \"complainers\" because they were looking for an excuse to complain.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Bergman maintained that anyone who does not actively await the arrival of Mashiach is a heretic and outside of the pale of Judaism, based on Rambam's famous assertion that one who is lacking in any of the 13 Principles doesn't have the status of a believing Jew. RALS was attempting to convince him him of how radical this understanding is: how many believing Jews today actively are \"awaiting his arrival\"? Obviously, he maintained, the implication of these words was not that 99.9% of Orthodox Jewry are non-believers, rather the understanding of this phrase is something more moderate, such as that \"awaiting\" means not giving up hope of his arrival, or something similar.\nLater in the conversation, Rabbi Bergman again attempted to bring up the topic, to which RALS replied \"There is a view in the Gemara that Mashiach will not come\", upon which he was questioned as to what he meant to imply with this, and to which he evaded the question.</p>\n\n\n",

He writes that a full skirt is preferable to both.</p>\n\n<p>In the beginning of the responsum (וברור...\"‏\") he explicitly rejects the opinion of the Peri Megadim (OC MZ 75:1) that the body part שוק (which he assumes a woman must cover) refers to the thigh, while accepting the opinion that it refers to the calf.</p>\n\n<p>His concluding line is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובמקום שלא ישמעו לנו הבנות ללבוש חצאיות או שמלות המכסות את הברכים, יש להעדיף מכנסים על חצאיות ושמלות קצרות, עד שיוכלו להשפיע עליהן ללבוש בגדי צניעות ככל בנות ישראל הכשרות<br>\n  And in a place where the women won't listen to us to wear skirts or dresses which cover the knees, one should prefer pants to [short] skirts or short dresses, until one can influence them to wear modest clothing like all Kosher Jewish women. (my translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why is R' Yosef willing to accept a skirt which only covers the knees but not the calf? </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is he saying that he prefers an uncovered שוק to wearing pants?\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is he relying <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/702/759\">Bedieved</a> on the opinion he rejected earlier in the responsum without saying so? (Did I miss it?)</li>\n<li>Is he just making a cost-benefit Tzniut analysis? If so is his conclusion due to leniency regarding שוק or stringency regarding pants? (This would mean that men could not recite Shema in front of a women dressed like that.)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Is he implicitly assuming that the skirt which covers the knees is being worn with opaque socks/leggings which cover the calf? (This would mean he preferred full pants to skirts which don't cover even legging-covered-knees, and all the more so to skirts which don't cover the entire calf if worn without opaque socks/leggings.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>My question is about R' Yosef's referenced opinion. Not about anyone else's opinion about anything.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Looking at both the question and the answer found in Yabia Omer, it is not speaking about adult, married women. It is discussing teenage girls in school only. It specifically is dealing with teenage girls who show up at a religious school in mini-skirts and refuse to listen to the school directors about wearing modest skirts. From the outset, this is portrayed as a <em>cost-benefit</em> situation.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yosef doesn't say what he disagrees to from the Pri Megadim. He says that this response is not the place to get into it. Simply looking at the Pri Megadim there are several different viewpoints mentioned about what שוק means. He tries to say that in some places שוק can mean thigh. The source he points to for this is Mishnah Chullin 10:4.</p>\n\n<p>This may be what Rabbi Yosef is objecting to because Chullin is discussing the שוק of an animal. In regard to the laws of modesty, it is about the שוק of a human being, which is different. The variation in anatomy for human beings is described in Mishnah Oholot 1:8.</p>\n\n<p>For human beings, שוק means calf, not thigh.</p>\n\n<p>The closing paragraph (8) makes clear that לכתחילה girls should not be permitted to wear long pants because they are <em>garments of haughtiness</em>, meaning they draw attention to the form of woman and accentuate it. He emphasizes that for girls who wear mini-skirts, efforts should be made to influence them in a pleasant way to wear modest skirts and dresses that also cover the knees <em>also when they are sitting</em>. As discussed in the earlier paragraphs that means when standing the skirt is well below the knee (more than 4 inches). It is only in situations where the girls refuse to wear skirts of that length that long pants are preferable to mini-skirts.</p>\n\n<p>As Rabbi Yosef points out in paragraph 3 based on the Bach to Yoreh Deah 182, pants worn to protect from the weather are permissible for women. That was part of the question posed at the beginning. In paragraphs 3-6 he also points out that the concept of <em>beged ish</em> does not apply for a variety of reasons enumerated.</p>\n\n<p>It is in paragraph 7 where he runs through the cost analysis citing Sotah 48,  Sefer Chassidim 176 and the response of the Rashba among others. As he points out, there are valid opinions that long pants are covering the <em>ervah</em> and are acceptable in certain limited circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>1) Rabbi Yosef is not saying he prefers uncovered שוק to wearing pants.</p>\n\n<p>2) He is not relying <em>bedieved</em> on an opinion he rejected earlier. (Assuming you are referring to the Pri Megadim comment)</p>\n\n<p>3) Yes, he is making a <em>cost-benefit</em> analysis. No, it is not about a leniency regarding שוק. I don't understand what you mean by a <em>stringency regarding pants</em>.</p>\n\n<p>4) He discusses stockings with skirts, but I think it was not dealing with opaque ones but rather transparent stockings like nylons. Nylons are not considered as covering. The question of opaque stockings would require additional review.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that the actual building of different houses of worship convey different expressions of religiousness. The church with its vaulted ceilings fits the vristion worship of beatitude and otherworldliness, as contrasted to the humble shul which asserts itself of direct concretedialog between God and man. It seems that whoever builds even the separate synagogue would have to be in tune to our version of worship.</p>\n\n\n",

It is a world where even in the Land of Israel, Jews are subjected to the whims and values of other nations. It is a world in which terrible barriers created by spiritual apathy deter man from coming close to the Almighty, and where the opportunities to approach Him and to experience His presence in His Temple are gone.\n  There is no greater destructiveness for the Jewish soul than to lose the awareness of the bitterness of exile.\n  Once one appreciates that the meaning of life is determined by how close one comes to the Creator, the loss of His presence becomes an acute, intolerable pain, a cancer, which eats away at man's spiritual core, which can only be anesthetized by distracting ourselves through all kinds of self-delusionary pleasures. In doing so, mankind has become callous and his senses have become dull to the ultimate pleasure this relationship would offer.</p>\n  \n  <p>There is no greater destructiveness for the Jewish soul than to lose the awareness of the bitterness of exile. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>perhaps by \"eino mechake\" the rambam does not mean simply \"wait for\" but rather that one does not \"wait for him because he gave up hope of him ever coming\" as the rambam continues</p>\n\n<p>שהרי\n תורה העידה עליו</p>\n\n<p>which implies he doesn't believe it will happen despite that the torah says so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I guess the simplest answer to this question is that anyone who <em>truly</em> understand what the Messianic Era is like, according to the Torah and prophets, could not possibly want to continue living in the diaspora.

Rashi is explaining the word, \"lehakdisheini\" - \"To sanctify me\". In other words, Moshe hit the rock. God said to Moshe SPEAK to the rock. So, Moshe did NOT do God's will, and therefore did not sanctify God's name. Had Moshe spoken to the rock, both Moshe and the rock would have been performing God's will. The people would have said, that just as the rock \"responded\" to Moshe who spoke to it because God commanded Moshe to speak to the rock, so to should we learn the importance of obeying God's will...</p>\n\n<p>Supplemental to this explanation, view the Sifsei Chachamim marked letter Heh on the verse immediately before this one. </p>\n\n<p>Summarizing what Sifsei Chachamim says - Moshe asked, \"Can we bring water from this rock?\" - Sifsei Chachamim emphasizes the word THIS, implying that all rocks have the ability to bring forth water. But, Moshe doubted that the specific rock that God told him to speak to would be the one that could do it. By hitting the rock, Moshe didn't prove anything and didn't sanctify God because people thought, \"Oh, this is no different than any rock that brings forth water.\" But had Moshe spoken to the rock, they would have said, \"Oh! This specific rock brought forth water because it was listening to God's commandment to bring water, not just because it had the water in it and it would have done so, anyway.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rashi has no problem attributing intellectual capacity and filtering the command of Hashem to the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165#v=11&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">earth</a> and to the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165#showrashi=true&v=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">grass</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Thus the idea would appear to be that the rock didn't make any calculations and try to rationalize or justify the Mitzvah - it did what it was told. (The intellect likely meaning coming from its spiritual source).</p>\n\n<p>Free will isn't attributed to something by this. Free will is not about intelligence (although intelligence may be a component of free will). An intelligence makes decisions based on its knowledge and capacity. If its experience and reasoning dictate a certain result, and it follows it, that was not an exercise in free choice. Free choice means, for example, choosing between following your intellectual conclusion and your emotional desire, doing something beyond where a natural reaction (even an intellectual natural reaction) would take you. (This explanation of free choice I heard from <a href=\"http://www.torahcafe.com/scholar/rabbi-elimelech-zweibel_0000000583.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Elimelech Tzviebel</a>.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R' Shimon Schwab writes in Maayan Beis HaSho'eva Beshalach 15:8 that part of many miracles is that inanimate objects and animals acquire free-will.

Also a person may be afraid to lose a friend if they act badly around them, but ones spouse is committed and therefore less likely to leave. \nThe basic gist is that it is a true measure of what your true middos are. </p>\n\n<p>My rebbe Rav Yitzchok greenblatt, a talmid of Rav Reuven Leuchter is very big on the concept of the obligation of a person to deal with their achraiyus and after bigger things. Surely there is no more direct responsability to a person then his wife. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Never heard this statement before but a quick guess would be the story with rabi Chanina and his wife in Taanis 25a (get ready daf yomi folks) where the vision of olam habaa was of the tzadikim sitting with their wives. We can say the way a person treats another is largely dependant on what they think that person is 'worth'. If he treats his wife well and shows Hashem what good treatment she deserves, he'll get to sit at that special 'reserved table' with her. Should work the opposite way to, the way the wife treats the husband etc. The interesting thing about that story is he almost ruined their table for olam habaa by praying for a miracle to make her life in this world easier.</p>\n\n\n",

A big one, which has not been discussed here (AFAIK), is about how to eat in other people's homes when necessary. </p>\n\n<p>This is not a question on the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/15107/1865\">permissibility of eating in a less-religious home</a>, eating in a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/34569/1865\">non-kosher restaurant with family</a>, or the general mindset of being a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/16022/1865\">houseguest in a non-frum home</a>. More specifically, this is about how to practically keep kosher in a family member's house that is unquestionably unkosher. </p>\n\n<p>Let's say a visiting observant Jew is in a situation where they must stay with nonobservant family for a week (or some other short period of time). How does one arrange for comfortable, kosher living? Is there any literature which spells out an arrangement convenient and simple for both parties? </p>\n\n<p>For simplicity's sake, this question does not deal with keeping Shabbat. </p>\n\n<p>I doubt many nonobservant family members would be interested in kashering their entire kitchen for a relative's temporary stay, but would still try to politely accommodate.

If we delete the name, that person may still be sick. If we keep saying Mi Sheberach for that person, that person may have either recovered or, worse, died. We have no way of knowing. No, the rabbi has no way to contact the requester because the slip of paper just has a name, and we don't know who requested it.</p>\n\n<p>My question is - is it OK to delete a sick person's name based on assuming automatically that the person doesn't need it, or do we have to say Mi Sheberach for someone indefinitely if we have no way of knowing the person's status.

This is against the Maharil, who wrote that one should not pray [for the sick who is] not in the city, because he may have died or became healthy, but [the reasoning of the Nachlas Shiva is sourced in] the Gemara/laws of Gittin that even if a person is left sick or elderly, he is assumed to have remained that way [and not assumed to have died, so the woman may not remarry].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above quote is referring the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1812&st=&pgnum=52\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvah 39</a>, but someone had written a letter to the Nachlas Shivah arguing this point, and the two of them go back and forth in several letters, numbered <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1812&st=&pgnum=85\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">teshuvos 77-80</a>.</p>\n<p>Thus, it appears that the more correct practice would be to keep the names on the list indefinitely. However, <em>tircha detzibura</em> is probably a greater concern in contemporary shuls than in those of the Nachalas Shiva and Shaarei Teshuva, because there are many more people on the list who would be from 'out of town', so this isn't such a definitive answer (if something to consider).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In my shul in Montreal, the list of names of the sick is growing all the time.

However, those who are chronically sick, should be reduced to perhaps once a week.  This is one solution.  Another solution would be to divide the chronically sick names into three lists and invoke their names once a week - Mon. am, Thurs. am and Shabbat Mincha.  Any comments.</p>\n\n\n",

Adams<br/>\ntzviha@gmail.com<br/></p>\n\n<p>Qaraites are a Jewish group that began around 760 CE. They rejected the Talmud and rabbinic Judaism and insisted that Jews only observe halacha as expressed in the literal text of the Torah. “Qaraite” means “Scriptualist”. The movement started in Iraq and Persia by Jews who objected to the authority of the leaders of the Babylonian Talmud Academies, the Gaonim. The Gaonim and their successors, the rishonim, are called Rabbanites because of their stance in defending the Talmud and rabbinic laws. </p>\n\n<p>Scholars have noted that many minhagim began as a response to the Qaraite movement. For example, the recital of במה מדליקין on Friday evening  after davening <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.co.il/2015/08/waiting-six-hours-for-dairy-rabbanite.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> was started in the times of the Gaonim to reinforce the rabbinic stance on having fire prepared before Shabbos, in opposition to the Qaraite view that no fire may be present in one’s home on Shabbos <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20151121053110/http://seforim.blogspot.co.il/2015/08/waiting-six-hours-for-dairy-rabbanite.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2</a>. There is evidence that the reading of Pirkei Avos [3] on Shabbos afternoon, which began in Gaonic times, was to emphasize to the Jewish masses that the Oral Law was passed down since Moshe Rabbeinu as stated in the first mishna of Pirkei Avos.</p>\n\n<p>Professor Haym Soloveitchik [4] has argued convincingly that the unique arrangement of Hilchos Shabbos in Rambam’s Mishna Torah was organized specifically with anti-Qaraite intent. Briefly, Rambam’s formulation of the Shabbos laws does not follow a chronological order or any other expected logical order. In his opening chapters, Rambam lays down the following rules: preserving lifesaving overrides the restrictions of Shabbos; only work done on Shabbos itself is forbidden (e.g. shehiyah and hatmanah are allowed); work done by a Gentile upon a Jew’s request is only forbidden by rabbinic law. These three rulings were denied by Qaraites. Rambam is then careful to segregate the Torah laws (di’Oraisas) into one group of chapters (7-12) and all the rabbinic rulings (di’rabbanans) into another set (21-24), with eight chapters separating the two. Soleveitchik argues that this was done to “highlight the very existence and legal force of rabbinic enactments, both of which were denied by the Qaraites”. Finally, Maimonides concludes the laws of Shabbos with an uplifting positive note: the laws of kibbud ve’oneg Shabbos. This further emphasizes the difference between the Qaraite and Rabbanite Shabbos, because Qaraites treated Shabbos “as a day of ascetic retreat and allowed only the barest minimum of eating and sleeping.” Rambam emphasizesאיזה הוא עינוג:  זה שאמרו חכמים שצריך לתקן תבשיל שמן ביותר, ומשקה מבושם, הכול לשבת  and  [5] אכילת בשר ושתיית יין בשבת, עינוג הוא לה. </p>\n\n<p>With this argument Soloveichik is suggesting that Rambam organized material in Mishna Torah so that the differences between Qaraite and Rabbanite Shabbos are emphasized to the reader. However, Soloveitchik takes matters one step further: He notes that Rambam is the first to define intimacy on Shabbos as oneg Shabbos: תשמיש המיטה, מעונג שבת הוא.  The Talmud only states that intimacy on Shabbos is allowed, but does not elevate this act to the categorization of mitzvas oneg Shabbos. Here, Soloveitchik argues that Rambam actually redefined the Talmudic law for polemical reasons [6]. This is a revolutionary proposition as we are generally under the assumption that the Mishna Torah is a practical summary of the Talmud – as Rambam tells us in his introduction to Mishna Torah [7]. Professor Soloveitchik has opened the door for the understanding that within Mishna Torah there may be Talmudic laws which have been redefined or reformulated for anti-Qaraite reasons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Waiting After Chicken: Rambam’s Innovation</strong></p>\n\n<p>I would like to suggest that Rambam’s interpretation of meat-milk separation laws was also based on anti-Qaraite socio-political motivation. While some earlier rishonim required waiting between eating beheima meat and eating dairy, Rambam was the first to state that one must wait after eating poultry, as well. (Beheima meat refers to meat from cows, sheep or goats.):</p>\n\n<p>מִי שֶׁאָכַל בָּשָׂר בַּתְּחִלָּה, בֵּין בְּשַׂר בְּהֵמָה בֵּין בְּשַׂר עוֹף--לֹא יֹאכַל אַחֲרָיו חָלָב עַד שֶׁיִּשְׁהֶה בֵּינֵיהֶן כְּדֵי שֵׁעוּר סְעוֹדָה אַחֶרֶת, וְהוּא כְּמוֹ שֵׁשׁ שָׁעוֹת:  מִפְּנֵי הַבָּשָׂר שֶׁלְּבֵין הַשִּׁנַּיִם, שְׁאֵינוּ סָר בְּקִנּוּחַ‏<br/>\nרמבם משנה תורה מאכלות אסורות פרק ט' הלכה כז</p>\n\n<p>This contradicts the simple reading of the Gemara Chullin 104b:</p>\n\n<p>תנא אגרא חמוה דרבי אבא עוף וגבינה נאכלין באפיקורן הוא תני לה והוא אמר לה בלא נטילת ידים ובלא קינוח הפה</p>\n\n<p>which states plainly that poultry and cheese (even in that order) may been eaten באפיקורן (in one kerchief)) or without concern (לשון הפקר)  even without washing one’s hands or mouth in between their consumption. See, for example, Ritva (Chullin 104b) [8]:</p>\n\n<p>פירש\"י שאם אכל זה ובה לאכול זה א\"צ לקנח פיו ולא ליטול. ונראה מלשונו אפי' בשאכל בשר עוף בתחילה...‏</p>\n\n<p>Earlier rishonim who required a long wait between beheima meat and dairy did not require this waiting between poultry and dairy. R. Chananel and R. Yitchak Alfasi required a waiting period only between beheima meat and dairy, but not between poultry and dairy. Rishonim in the years close after Rambam’s lifetime challenged his innovation.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the core lines of the sugya (Chullin 105a) which are most relevant to this discussion:</p>\n\n<p>גופא אמר רב חסדא אכל בשר אסור לאכול גבינה\nאמר מר עוקבא אנא להא מלתא חלא בר חמרא לגבי אבא דאילו אבא כי הוה אכיל בשרא האידנא לא הוה אכל גבינה עד למחר עד השתא ואילו אנא בהא סעודתא הוא דלא אכילנא לסעודתא אחריתא אכילנא</p>\n\n<p>R. Chananel comments:</p>\n\n<p>וזה לשון רבינו חננאל ז\"ל, ולא מצינו מי שהתיר לאכול גבינה אחר בשר בפחות מעת לעת אלא מר עוקבא דאכל בשר בסעוד' אח' בסעוד' אחרת גבינ' ואמ' על עצמו דבהא מלתא חלא בר חמרא אנא ואי אפשר להתיר בפחו' מזה...ע\"כ הובא בתוס' הרא\"ש וחי' הרשב\"א חולין קה ע\"א))‏</p>\n\n<p>R. Chananel is not cited in regards to poultry and it can be assumed he is speaking only of red meat. This is more apparent in the words of his disciple R. Yitchak Alfasi (1013 - 1103) who shares his master’s view:</p>\n\n<p>הרי\"ף פרק כל הבשר- תנא אגרא חמוה דרבי אבא עוף וגבינה נאכלין באפיקורן וי\"א באפיקוליס הוא תני לה והוא אמר לה בלא קינוח הפה ובלא נטילת ידים... ושמעינן מהא דהאי דא\"ר חסדא אכל בשר אסור לאכול גבינה דלא שרי למיכל גבינה בתר בשרא אלא עד דשהי ליה שיעור מה דצריך לסעודתא אחריתי דלא אשכחינן מאן דשרי למיכל גבינה בתר בישרא בפחות מהאי שיעורא</p>\n\n<p>It is clear from the Rif’s discussion of the statement of אגרא that his use of the words בשר and עוף denote two separate entities. Rif’s requirement to wait דשהי ליה שיעור מה דצריך לסעודתא\" אחריתי” is only for red meat, not poultry.  Rif moved from North Africa to Spain in 1088 and was recognized there as the leading halachic authority. The psak of R. Chananel and Rif became standard over time in Spain and people waited after red meat before eating dairy; and evidence suggests that they did not wait after poultry. One source is in the Sefer Ittur of R. Yitchak ben Abba Mari (c. 1122 – c. 1193). In his discussion of the view of R. Chananel, Ittur makes clear that for fowl there is no six hour waiting requirement:</p>\n\n<p>ספר העיטור שער ראשון הל' הכשר בשר דף יג ע\"ב והלכתא … אלא קינוח הפה לגבינה לבשר. ושהייה לבשר וגבינה… ועוף וגבינה א”צ שהייה לבשר וגבינה ולא קנוח הפה ונט”י לגבינה ובשר.   ‏</p>\n\n<p>Another source is from Meiri (1249-1306) in his Sefer Magen Avos written about 100 years after Rambam’s Mishna Torah. Meiri wrote Magen Avos to defend the customs of Provence against the ridicule and challenge of Spanish rishonim:</p>\n\n<p>מגן אבות דף יא' הקדמה- ומה שהביאנו לסדר אופני אלה הדברים שכתבנו...הוא, שאנחנו בעיר הזאת עיר פרפיאגיאק והחזקנו בהרבה מנהגים היו בידינו בירושה מאבותינו... ביד חכמי העיר ברדש ... ורב גבול ארץ פרובינצה. ועתה מקרוב באו הנה קצת חכמים מארץ ספרד... לערער בקצת מנהגינו... וראיתי לכתוב על ספר מה שנשאתי ונתתי עמהם באלו המנהגות...‏</p>\n\n<p>He records the Spanish custom not to wait at all between fowl and milk. He describes how in his time a new generation of Spanish rabbis began to adopt the stringent view of Rambam and begin a new trend:</p>\n\n<p>דף מו'-מט' הענין התשיעי. עוד נשאו ונתנו אתנו במה שהם נוהגים לאכול גבינה אחר עוף, ואנו מחמירים עד שישהא שש שעות או חמש כשיעור שבין סעודה לסעודה כדין האמור בבשר בהמה....ונמצא כלל הדברים, שכל מאכל בשר בין של בהמה בין של עוף אינו אוכל גבינה אח\"כ עד שיעברו שש שעות או חמש...ויראה לי להקל עוד שאף באכל עוף תחילה אע\"פ שצריך שהיה, אינו צריך שש שעות, אלא כל שסעודה לסעודה אפילו בקירוב זמן הואיל וסילק , ועקר....אלא שהדברים ברורים כשטתינו ואף הם הודו שחכמים האחרונים שבגלילותיהם מחמירים בה ונוהגים כמנהגינו והנאני הדבר</p>\n\n<p>It is clear that the former norm in Spain was to eat cheeses/dairy immediately after poultry with no  kinuach ve’hadacha, like the Ittur indicates was the accepted halacha in that country.</p>\n\n<p>(Is interesting to note Meiri’s own leniency for poultry: ...ויראה לי להקל עוד שאף באכל עוף תחילה אע\"פ שצריך שהיה, אינו צריך שש שעות, אלא כל שסעודה לסעודה אפילו בקירוב זמן הואיל וסילק , ועקר.)‏</p>\n\n<p>In the two generations following Rambam, the greatest rishonim attacked the Rambam’s reform as it reversed the ruling of the Bavli. Ramban (1194-1270) was the first to challenge Rambam’s alteration:</p>\n\n<p>... אבל הרמב\"ן ז\"ל כתב דאגרא אפילו עוף ואחר כך גבינה שרא דלישנא הכי משמע דקאמר עוף וגבינה...(ר\"ן על הרי\"ף חולין דף לז')‏</p>\n\n<p>R. Aaron Halevi (1230-1300) was next:</p>\n\n<p>...ואפילו הכי שרינן בעוף בלא נטילת ידים משום דקיל דלא מיתסר אלא מדרבנן, ודאי לא שני לן בין עוף ואחר כך גבינה בין גבינה ואחר כך עוף... הוא הדין לקנוח הפה דלא בעינן אפי' בין עוף לגבינה.... ולהוציא קצת מדברי רבי' ז\"ל (=הרמב\"ם) שפרשו דההיא דאגרא דאמר עוף וגבנה נאכלין באפיקורן דוקא גבינה תחילה ואחר כך עוף... (חידושי רא\"ה לחולין דף קד')‏</p>\n\n<p>However, as Meiri noted, the trend in Spain began to change [9]. Creative ways of reinterpreting the words of אגרא were created to fit this new reform into the Talmud. Tur (1275-1340) YD 89 cites Rambam’s ruling on poultry as if none other exists.</p>\n\n<p>Why did Rambam change the Halacha?  Perhaps it was an anti-Qaraite measure. By extending the waiting requirement to include poultry, the divide between Rabbanites and Qaraites became more apparent. Rabbanite Jews who followed Rambam’s ruling could participate in only a limited way at a multicourse Qaraite meal which included poultry and dairy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Waiting 6 Hours- R. Chananel’s Innovation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Until R. Chananel’s time, waiting between meat and milk was not considered mandatory by halachic authorities. One could choose instead to perform kinuach ve’hadacha - clean out one’s mouth and rinse one’s hands, if they were soiled from meat. The halachic modification of removing the kinuach ve’hadacha option was likely planned as an anti-Qaraite legislation.</p>\n\n<p>Two primary authorities report on the halacha as it was in pre- R. Chananel times. One is the Baal Halochos Gedolos (BaHaG) of either R. Yehudai Gaon, head of the yeshiva in Sura from 757 to 761, and/or Shimon Kayyara (8th century). (The correct authorship of BaHaG is a matter of scholarly debate, but its author was a recognized source of halachic tradition from the 8th century.)</p>\n\n<p>הלכות גדולות הלכות ברכות פרק ששי ט' א' (הובא גם בטור או\"ח קעג')- אמצעיים רשות אמר רב נחמן לא שנו אלא שבין תבשיל לתבשיל אבל בין בשר לגבינה חובה והאי דשרו רבנן גבינה בתר בשר משמעתיה דרב נחמן ... אמר רב חסדא אכל בשר אסור לאכול גבינה ודוקא בלא קינוח אבל מקנח פומיה שרי למיכל...‏</p>\n\n<p>A careful reading of BaHaG shows that the \"רבנן\" cited in BaHaG refers to contemporaneous sages, not only earlier “Chazal”.</p>\n\n<p>The second testimony is from R. Hai Gaon (939-1038), as cited by Rashba:</p>\n\n<p>חידושי הרשב\"א חולין קה ע\"א אבל הרב בעל הלכות גדולות ז\"ל כתב בהלכו' ברכות... וכן דעת רבינו יעקב ז\"ל וגאון זכרונו לברכה גם כן כתב אכל בשר מותר לסעודה אחרת למיכל גבינה וה\"מ בחסידי אבל אנן מקנחינ' ומחוורינן ידן ופומן ואכלי'. אכל גבינ' שרי למיכל בשר בלא קנוח בלא נטילת ידים וה\"מ דחזייה לידיה דלא מטנפא. (הובא גם בספר העיטור שער ראשון הל' הכשר בשר דף יג ע\"ב)‏</p>\n\n<p>The Rashba is clearly citing two separate sources, the BaHaG and the “Gaon” (R’ Hai [10]). R. Hai Gaon speaks in the plural and says “we rinse hands and wash out our mouths and eat”. Evidently, this was the common practice amongst the gaonim.</p>\n\n<p>What triggered the halachic transformation which we observe in the leading North African and Spanish rishonim of the following generation? (R. Chananel was about 48 years old when R. Hai passed away.) </p>\n\n<p>Let’s analyze early Qaraite halachic progressions and how they correlate with inverse developments in Rabbanite halacha. To fully appreciate the reasons for R. Chananel’s modernization of milk and meat laws, it is necessary to trace Qaraite geographic, demographic, and halachic developments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Historical Development of Qaraite Halacha</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nathan Shur’s Toldoth haKaraim[11] provides an overview of Qaraite history. Qaraism began gradually in the late eighth and early ninth centuries CE. Anan Ben David (c. 715 - c. 795), who was later claimed to be the founder of the Qaraite movement (though not historically accurate), maintained that it is forbidden to eat meat until the Temple is rebuilt [12]. Benjamin Nahawendi (early 9th century), Sahl ben Matzliah Abu al-Sari (910–990), and Daniel al-Kumisi  (d. 946), all early prominent Qaraite scholars and philosophers, forbade their followers from eating meat until the restoration of the sacrifices [13]. The Tustaries [14], a family of wealthy influential Qaraites with independent philosophic and halachic views, also forbade eating meat. Qaraite views were not uniform on all matters; Yacob Qirqisani, a leading Qaraite scholar of the first half of the tenth century, limited this meat restriction to Jerusalem but allowed consumption of meat and wine outside Jerusalem. Slowly over the course of the tenth century the abstinent trend amongst Qaraites loosened and it became acceptable to allow meat consumption [15].</p>\n\n<p>From the inception of Qaraism, its scholars read the passuk, \"לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו\" literally (al-Qirqisani, Kitab al-AnWar, XII, 25:4 “‘in its mother’s milk’ refers only to the milk of its mother”). They therefore had no hesitations against eating meat and dairy together and did so once they had relaxed the mourning restriction. Shlomo ben Yehuda Gaon, (Jerusalem, 1025-1051), records that the Qaraites ate dairy with meat [16].</p>\n\n<p>These Qaraite developments coincided with corresponding developments in Rabbanite circles. R. Chananel was born in the year 990 and passed away in 1053. We don’t know exactly when he wrote his commentary to Tractate Chullin requiring a six hour wait, but it probably was early in the eleventh century. Soon after the Qaraites began breaching the rabbinic meat and milk halachos in the mid-tenth century, the Rabbanites responded by building a fence to guard those same halachos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Qaraite Geography</strong></p>\n\n<p>In beginning of ninth and tenth century Qaraites were concentrated in Iraq and Persia, but in the middle of the tenth century they began moving westward to Jerusalem, North Africa, and Spain. During this time period, Qaraites lived throughout the Jewish-inhabited world. In every important city besides those in France and Germany, a Qaraite community could be found alongside each Rabbanite community [17]. Many of the Qaraites were great philosophers, writers, and wealthy merchants; some were invested with high political power. In Cairo, Qaraites were so powerful and influential that many Rabbanites left the fold for Qaraism, until Rambam came to Cairo in 1166 and stopped this drift by improving the political power of the Rabbanites [18]. It is thus understandable why Rambam would seek to modify Jewish practices to widen the separation between Rabbanites and Qaraites. </p>\n\n<p>R. Chananel (990 - 1053) and R. Yitchak Alfasi (1013 – 1103), the first rishonim to make the six hour wait an absolute requirement, lived in Fez, Kairouan, and Spain, side by side with Qaraite communities. As the Qaraites allowed themselves to eat milk and meat together over the course of the tenth century, they became nicknamed ‘the eaters of milk and meat’. They surely influenced some from the Rabbanite community. In order to protect the Halacha, highlight their symbolic differences, and erect a social barrier between the two camps, these leaders extended the original kinuach ve’hadacha obligation to a six hour wait.</p>\n\n<p>Some historians believe that the Qaraites of the early Middle Ages counted for close to half of the total Jewish population [19]. Furthermore, recent analysis of Cairo Geniza documents shows that Qaraite and Rabbanite communities of North Africa and Eretz Yisrael of the tenth through thirteenth centuries collaborated in legal affairs, political endeavors, and commerce. There were even frequent mutually respectful Qaraite-Rabbanite marriages [20]. The two communities were dependent on each other in many ways. An excellent description of this historical setting is found in Heresy and the Politics of Community by Marina Rustow (2008). The need to defend the rabbinic Halacha is understood better against such an historical backdrop. As the divide between the communities was sometimes blurred, reinforcement was necessary. It is understandable why we find a Rabbanite response to Qaraite leniencies from North African Rabbanite authorities and not from the heirs of the Gaonate in Iraq. This is because the center of Qaraite activity had already migrated from Iraq to the Mediterranean Basin over the course of the tenth century.</p>\n\n<p>During the tenth and eleventh centuries Rabbanites from all over the Mediterranean would make yearly pilgrimages to Jerusalem for Sukkos. On Haosha’na Rabba the custom was for all to gather on Har ha’Zaisim and amongst other things declare blessings and bans. In 1029 and 1038, the Rabbanites proclaimed a ban against the Qaraites. It is the wording of these charamim which is very revealing. The ban was worded “against the eaters of meat and milk”.</p>\n\n<p>Rustow explains the deeper context and meaning behind the ban:</p>\n\n<p>…the Rabbanites and the Qaraites in the Fatamid realm conducted regular professional and personal relations. The ban’s aim was not to correct Qaraite religious behavior, but to achieve symbolic or ritual separation between the two groups. …. the principle violation with which the Qaraites stood charged- challenging the rabbinic claim to exclusive authority in interpreting biblical law …. The ban was couched, by a synecdoche that stood for an entire theological aberration, in terms of a specific infringement: eating meat with milk. [21]</p>\n\n<p>The milk and meat mixing of the Qaraites symbolized the divide between the Qaraite and Rabbanite camps. It is clear why the leading rabbinic sages of this era would fortify and tighten this particular area of law.\nPrecedent in Rabbeinu Tam</p>\n\n<p>This argument for the political origins of the six hour wait may seem novel and shocking, but in fact, the truth of its background was known from the beginning. Rabbeinu Tam (1100-1171) of France who lived shortly after the innovation of R. Channenel and Rif writes exactly this:</p>\n\n<p>ספר הישר לרבינו תם סימן תעב. כל הבשר. אמ' רב נחמן לא שנו ...פירש רב יהודאי בשאלתות שנשאלו לפניו... אבל בין בשר בהמה לגבינה בעי קינוח והדחה. והא דאמר מר עוקבא להא מילתא (חלא) בר חמרא אנא כו' היינו גבי שיהוי בלא קינוח. דהא בעי ר' יוחנן כמה ישהא כו' היינו היכא דלא קינח אבל אי קינח לא בעי שיהוי.

Avraham HaYarchi (c. 1155-1215) of Provence in his Manhig Olam paraphrases Rabbeinu Tam’s words (without the printing error) [22]:</p>\n\n<p>ספר המנהיג הלכות סעודה אות ט'- ובהלכות ה\"ר שמעון קיירא … ודאמר רב חסדא אכל בשר אסור לאכול גבינה היינו בלא קינוח הפה אבל מי שיקנח פומיה וידיה שרי ליה למיכל…, ואפילו באותו סעודה קאמר וכן כתב ר\"י מנוחתו כבוד בספר הישר… פירש רב יהודאי גאון בשאלתות שנשאלו לפניו… אבל בין בשר לגבינה בעי קינוח הפה והדחה ,,והא דאמר מר עוקבא אנא להא מילת חלא בר חמרא אנא וכו' היינו גבי שיהוי ובלא קינוח הפה דהא דבעו מיניה דר' יוחנן כמה ישהא וכו' היינו בלא קינוח הפה אבל בקינוח לא בעי שיהוי, ובשר שאכל אחר גבינה לא בעי קינוח ושיהוי כלל... וכן מוכח בהלכות גדולות של ברכות.... ואע\"פ שרבינו חננאל פליג אהאי פיסקא וכן הרב אלפאסי לאו דסמכא נינהו ולמקום שאינן בני תורה חששו ובקעא מצאו וגדרו בה גדר וכן עיקר ... כפר\"ת.‏</p>\n\n<p>What is meant by בקעא מצאו וגדרו בה גדר? It refers either to the Qaraites or to the weakening of Rabbanite community values due to Qaraite influence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Minhag Ashkenaz</strong></p>\n\n<p>What was the accepted Halacha in the Franco-German Jewish communities of the early Middle Ages? Their custom was to allow eating dairy after meat as long as a disuniting action was performed in between. Some Ashkenazi rishonim required only kinuach ve’hadach; others required birkas hamazon. Rashi [23] (as cited by Siddur Rashi and Manhig) and Rashbam [24] required birkas hamazon- the dairy foods must be consumed in a separate meal. Rabbeinu Tam allowed their consumption in the same meal with an intermediary kinuach vehadacha. Consistency exists between the two Franco-German views- a time waiting intermission as an absolute requirement was foreign to them [25].</p>\n\n<p>R. Zerachiah HaLevi Baal Ha-Maor of Provence (c. 1125- c. 1186) concurred independently [26] with the view of R. Tam and reports that this was the general custom in France:</p>\n\n<p>המאור הגדול לרבינו זרחיה הלוי פרק כל הבשר – נקיטינן מהאי עובדא ... היכא דאכל בשר מקמי גבינה אי ההוא בשר דאכל בשר חיה ובהמה הוא צריך נט\"י והוא דאכל בלילה וצריך נמי קינוח הפה ... ועוף וגבינה נאכלין באפיקורין\nולא צריכי ולא מידי ... אע\"פ שהקדים עוף לגבינה ..‏</p>\n\n<p>והיכא דשהה ליה ו' שעות שיעור שהייה שבין סעודה לסעודה אע\"פ שאכל בשר בהמה וחיה מותר לאכול גבינה... בלא ובלא קנוח הפה ולא אמר רב חסדא אכל בשר אסור לאכול גבינה אלא באפיקורן כלומר בלא נט\"י\"נט\"י</p>\n\n<p>ובלא קנוח הפה אבל בנט\"י ובקנוח הפה הכל מותר... ועל זה הדרך מתיישבת כל השמועות כולן וכן פסק בעל ההלכות הראשונות ז\"ל ומזה יתבאר לך מה שפסק הרי\"ף בהלכותיו על לא נכון...וטעו בפירושיהם להעמיד מנהגיהם ומה שכתבנו היא המחוור וכן נהגו כל חכמי צרפת</p>\n\n<p>The custom of the sages of France and Germany reflects the original Halacha and simplest reading of the Talmud. There were no Qaraite communities in France and Germany during that time period and hence the Franco-German sages saw no need to respond with a symbolic and social barrier. The existence of the original gaonic custom in European communities is in line with Haym Soloveitchik’s recent “Third Yeshiva of Bavel” hypothesis [27]. Soloveitchik argues that the Ashkenazi scholarly community was transplanted from Iraq sometime between the years 930 and 960. This emigration occurred before R. Chananel’s new legislation [28]. They therefore knew only the ancient Halacha and stuck with it because they had no reason to change [29].</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi David Bar-Hayim of Machon Shilo delivered a series of comprehensive shiurim (2010) explaining all the fine detail of this sugya in Chullin- how it was originally understood and how it was later re-explained.\nHere are two additional considerations regarding the words of מר עוקבא:</p>\n\n<p>אמר מר עוקבא אנא להא מלתא חלא בר חמרא לגבי אבא דאילו אבא כי הוה אכיל בשרא האידנא לא הוה אכל גבינה עד למחר עד השתא ואילו אנא בהא סעודתא הוא דלא אכילנא לסעודתא אחריתא אכילנא</p>\n\n<p>1) Mar Ukva is well-known in the Talmud for his extreme piety and righteousness. See Kesubos 67b and Rashi Sanhedrin 31b ד\"ה לדזיו. Why shouldn’t this statement be understood as another example of his extreme personal religiosity [30]? </p>\n\n<p>2) How could R. Chananel  say-לא מצינו מי שהתיר לאכול גבינה אחר בשר בפחות מעת לעת אלא מר עוקבא? This statement is shocking. If Jews commonly waited 24 hours before dairy after eating meat wouldn’t there be some hint of it somewhere in the vast Tannaic, Amoraic or Midrashic literature? The truth is to the contrary- מר עוקבאand his father are the only sages we ever hear of who waited so long. In fact, his words are expressed in a way which indicates that he speaks of a personal private custom:  .\"אנא להא מלתא... ואילו אנא...\" R. Chananel himself was surely aware of the shortcomings of his argument.. He may have only said these words in order to allow for the creation of a new Rabbanite custom which would aid in segregating the Qaraites from the Rabbanites.  For the sake of launching the new order of dietary and hence societal and communal limitations, R. Chananel devised a clever way of manipulating the brief quasi-aggadic words of Mar Ukva.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Qaraites from the start understood the biblical verses of lo sevashal literally, in contrast to the Talmudic/rabbinic interpretation. Qaraite law allowed for cooking and eating meat with milk. However, this Qaraite departure from the Oral Law did not cause strife between the two factions during the first two centuries of the movement’s existence because Qaraites adopted an ascetic mournful lifestyle, abstaining from any meat at all. Practically, therefore, during these early years, Qaraites were not cooking and/or eating any meat and milk together. In the middle of the tenth century, Qaraite lawmakers gradually adopted a more lenient worldly approach, allowing meat consumption. With authorization to eat meat, Qaraites did so with no compunctions about preparing the meat with dairy. This Qaraite breach of the Oral Law earned them the nickname “the eaters of meat with milk”. This transgression of the Qaraites became symbolic of the entire conflict between the Rabbanite and Qaraite camps.  Throughout this period, the two camps were very connected socially, politically, and economically. There were Rabbanite-Qaraite marriages, joint business ventures, and joint communities. The lines between the two camps were not as distinct as we may imagine. At some point in the early eleventh century, the Rabbanite rishonim devised a way to create greater division and social split between the two camps. Choosing the very topic which represented the heart of the schism, they reinterpreted Talmudic passages in a manner which requires waiting six hours between eating red meat and dairy products, further separating the Rabbanites from the Qaraites both halachically and socially. However, Rabbanites and Qaraites could still enjoy a poultry-dairy meal together during community gatherings or business meetings. It was more difficult to redefine an explicit statement in the Talmud allowing poultry and dairy together without any separation in between (אגרא’s statement). Maimonides was the first to attempt to further widen the gap by including poultry in the six-hour wait category. He was quickly attacked by other Talmudists such as Nachmanides and R. Aaron HaLevi for contradicting the Talmud’s legal allowance. However, in time even Maimonides’ expansion found justification by means of rereading and re-explaining the simple meaning of the passage תנא אגרא חמוה דרבי אבא עוף וגבינה נאכלין באפיקורן הוא תני לה והוא אמר לה בלא נטילת ידים ובלא קינוח הפה [31]. ‏</p>\n\n<p>I am very grateful to Rabbi Bar-Hayim of Machon Shilo. Only after hearing his shiur was I able to fit in the missing puzzle pieces [32]. This paper repeats his message but also adds by filling in the historical setting which caused the new strict waiting practice.  Readers will probably enjoy Rabbi Bar-Hayim’s restorative conclusions on this sugya.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Post was too long - so I pasted the footnotes into the comments.</strong></p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Assuming the premises of your case, one could perhaps address this question based on a question raised in the Talmud:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=17&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chulin 17a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בעי רבי ירמיה אברי בשר נחירה שהכניסו ישראל עמהן לארץ מהו אימת אילימא\n  בשבע שכבשו השתא דבר טמא אישתרי להו דכתיב ובתים מלאים כל טוב ואמר ר'\n  ירמיה בר אבא אמר רב כתלי דחזירי בשר נחירה מבעיא אלא לאחר מכאן ואיבעית\n  אימא לעולם בשבע שכבשו כי אשתרי להו שלל של עובדי כוכבים דידהו לא אישתרי\n  תיקו</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Jeremiah raised the following question: What was the law regarding\n  portions of meat of stabbed animals that were brought into the land of\n  Israel by the Israelites? But then, at what period could this Question\n  have arisen? Should you say during the seven years of conquest?\n  Behold! They were permitted to eat unclean things, for it is written:\n  And houses full of all good things, and R. Jeremiah b. Abba stated ill<sup>1</sup>\n  the name of Rab that even bacon was permitted! Can there then be any\n  question regarding the flesh of a stabbed animal? — The question could\n  have arisen only after this period. If you wish, however, I can say\n  that the question refers to the seven years’ period of conquest, and\n  it would have arisen, [since it might be argued] that when permission\n  was granted it was only with regard to the spoil taken from the\n  idolaters but not their own [stabbed meat]! The question remains\n  unanswered. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Chullin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Talmud is discussing a similar situation. The Jews had unslaughtered meat that had been permitted before entering Israel, but slaughter became a requirement upon entering Israel. The Talmud wonders whether the Jews are permitted to eat meat that had been killed without slaughter before slaughter was required.</p>\n\n<p>The two cases are not, however, perfectly similar. In the Talmud's case the \"new prohibition\" is on the cheftza (object), while in your question the \"new prohibition\" is on the \"gavra\" (person). That is to say that in the Talmud's case it is the meat that would become forbidden, whereas in your case it would be the person being disallowed from eating chicken/milk at a certain time without there being any inherent prohibition in the chicken or milk themselves. Thus, one could argue that the ruling would be different.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1.

This is how Tosefos understands the Mishnah here (113a s.v בשר).  The Beis Yosef (Sh. A.) does not learn the Mishnah here like that, but rather learns that Rebbi Akiva <em>is explaining</em> the Rabbanan.</p>\n\n<p>The earlier Gemara (104a), would then be entertaining a <em>hava amina</em> but really holds like Rebbi Akiva.  </p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that your question makes an assumption that simply isn't there.  If we learn like Tosefos - that בשר עוף (Chicken) is included in אל תבשל גדי בחלב אמו, then it is M'Doraissa - from the Torah that it is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever דרשה you make is that once all the different types of kosher animals are learned out, we understand that from the Torah - all meat that results in a neveilah is ostensibly forbidden with milk, chicken is included.</p>\n\n<p>Now we turn to the Shulchan Aruch.  He certainly allows this reading of the Gemara, but rejects it on the grounds that this is not l'halacha, and in order for this Gemara to work out with the sugya on Issur chal al Issur, and how you hold in that sugya, it comes out that Rebbi Akiva is explaining the Rabbanan.</p>\n\n<p>In which case, the whole reason chicken is assur m'derabbanan is purely technical - a derasha from the Torah that chicken is not assur min haTorah.  </p>\n\n<p>Since R. Yossi haGalili takes this further and understands Chicken to be entirely permitted, we see very clearly that R. Akiva's derasha is Oral Torah derasha - meaning we know from Sinai this Derasha is applied to the fact that אל תבשל וכו׳ is written three times in the Torah to teach this point - that chicken is only m'drabbanan.</p>\n\n<p>In which case, there was never a time in which chicken was considered meat m'doraissa and it was changed to M'derabbanan or it was nothing and the Rabbis forbade it.

    "content": "# Why believe angels' showing Aaron dead after being fooled about Moses?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When Moses didn't come down from Sinai, the Jews requested a replacement leader, explaining (Exodus 32:1) that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>this Moses man who lifted us out of the land of Egypt — we don't know what has become of him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em>, as often, considers \"this\" to refer to something present and visible:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The <em>satan</em> showed them something like the form of Moses, that they were carrying him in the air of the spread-out sky.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, Moses wasn't actually dead.</p>\n\n<p>Fast-forward some forty years to Aaron's death. He died and was left on a mountain, while the Jews were nearby, not on the mountain. Numbers 20:29:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The entire people saw that Aaron had died.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em> wonders how they saw what happened atop a mountain:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When they saw Moses and Eleazar descending — but Aaron did not descend — they asked, \"Where is Aaron?\" and he told them, \"He is dead\". They told him, \"Is it possible that the angel of death can have dominion over the one who stood before the angel and stopped the plague?\". Immediately, Moses begged for mercy and the service angels showed him, placed in a bed, to them. They saw and believed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why did they believe? That sort of evidence had been proven untrustworthy.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Source: This question (worded differently) was included, with no answer offered, in the weekly <em>Torah Bits</em> publication by the St. Louis Kollel, volume 20, issue 40, June 28 (<em>Chukas</em>), 2014.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think one could argue that in Numbers 20:29, we have a new generation, and this generation is more aware and less likely to misread the information given.</p>\n<p>However, a simpler explanation might be gleaned from looking at the source text for <em>Rashi</em>'s comment on Numbers 20:29, which is the <em>Midrash Tanchuma Chukat</em>, <em>siman</em> 17 (<em>s.v.</em> וידבר ה׳ אל משה קח את אהרן נתפשט את אהרן).  The end of that <em>siman</em> reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מיד פתח הקדוש ברוך הוא את המערה והראהו להם שנאמר ויראו כל העדה כי גוע\nאהרן.</p>\n<p>Immediately, G-d opened the cave and showed it [him?] to them, as it is said: \"and all the congregation saw that Aharon had died\" (Num 20:29).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this case, the agent of the vision is G-d; in the <em>midrash</em> quoted by <em>Rashi</em> in Exodus 32:1, which comes from <em>Talmud Bavli</em> <em>Shabbos</em> 89a, the agent is the <em>satan</em>.  In Exodus, the congregation was unsure whether to believe the vision (as says the <em>Maharsha</em> on the <em>gemara</em> [<em>ad loc.</em>]: גם שהראוהו להם מת מסתפקים בקצת דשמא מעשה שטן הוא), and came down on the wrong side of that doubt.  However, when G-d himself was doing the showing, as in Numbers 20:29, there was no doubt as to its authenticity.</p>\n<p>A question that I would have with the above explanation, is why <em>Rashi</em> chose to say that the ministering angels (מלאכי השרת) did the showing, and not G-d, as in the <em>midrash</em>. I can only posit that the ministering angels, to <em>Rashi</em>, were the mechanism by which G-d did the showing, and it was still clear enough to the congregation that the agent was G-d, and not the <em>satan</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would like to suggest an answer. We know that the Satan has permission from Hashem to play tricks on people to tempt them to sin. This can go so far, like we find in the Parsha of a false prophet (Devarim 13:3) that he can even create real miracles and we are still not allowed to follow him based on what we see, when he tells us to commit Idolatry. Similarly, by the sin of the Golden Calf, although they saw \"like an image\" of Moshe dead they should have understood that this was a trick from Satan to lead them to sin because regardless of Moshe being alive or dead they cannot create the Golden Calf as this is a form of Idolatry.\nIn other words, the lesson the Jews took from this is that even if they saw something that seemed to be a reason to commit a sin they must not rely on it in order to sin. They did not take out of it that any time they see an image of a dead person it isn't true, only when it can lead to a sin and in that case it can be anything that they see, they cannot rely on it to sin.<BR>\nTherefore this does not change the fact that generally by Torah law one must believe and rely on something that he sees with his eyes. A jewish court will pass judgement based on the eye-witness account of witnesses (Devarim 19:15). Therefore by Aharons passing, where they were shown an image of Aharon in his death there was no reason for them not to rely on their seeing it and to carry on with the mitzvah of mourning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Ozer Alport from his weekly divrei Torah Parsha Potpourri quotes from the Pnennim Mshulchan Gevoha:</p>\n\n<p>Rav Elya Meir Bloch explains that this case was different, in that Moshe had already told the people that he witnessed Aharon’s death. They didn’t believe how the angel of death could have power over Aharon, so they were shown Aharon’s image to prove the claim.</p>\n\n\n",

(Eisenstein <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_2591_320.pdf\">has an entry on Buddha</a> in his book, where he writes that it's a 'new idea regarding Godhood', but doesn't elaborate). </p>\n\n<p>Regarding Hinduism, <a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2009/04/is-hinduism-avodah-zarah.html\">this Hirhurim blogpost</a> notes that even if the belief system isn't strictly idolatry, their practices are. Likewise regarding Buddhism, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism\">Wikipedia</a> declares Buddhism to be a \"nontheistic religion\", which shouldn't pose a problem in and of itself, but the same article states: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Devotion is an important part of the practice of most Buddhists. Devotional practices include bowing, offerings, pilgrimage, and chanting. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The practices of bowing and giving offerings of (animal or) incense towards anything other than the One God are considered avodah zara practices (Sanhedrin Mishna 7:6) and therefore it appears that any statue or ritual object that has been used for such devotional practices would indeed be prohibited as avodah zara or tashmishei avodah zara. </p>\n\n<p>However, this is not necessarily so clear, as certain devotions <em>are</em> actually meant to be done with the intent of devoting oneself to what might be referred to as the one God, creator of the universe. The Shach (151:7) says that even these forms of devotions to Hashem along with another deity is permitted for a non-Jew, and the Avnei Nezer (Y.D. 123:9) extends this even to the statue itself (which is the object of such an incense sacrifice or bowing). </p>\n\n<p>R. Akiva Tatz, in <em>Letters to a Buddhist Jew</em>, writes that Buddhist temples and statues are indeed Avodah Zara, because they are used for servitude of this kind. (He understands, based on the Rambam in the beginning of Hil. Avodah Zarah I assume, that all of idol worship is actually the worship of 'lower spiritual forces' with the recognition that there's a greater God.) He doesn't phrase the reason for the prohibition in this way, but it seems like his reasoning is that despite the fact that these statues aren't worshiped in and of themselves, they are still object of devotional bowing, an idolatrous practice.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My understanding is that Buddhism views the goal of reality to escape it. That like Judaism, this reality is just a mask of a truer reality. However, unlike Judaism which calls the infinite truth G-d, Buddhism fails to call it anything or attribute it with any traits or powers. It is as if they are on the right path and then just stop.</p>\n<p>A Buddhist then tries as much as possible to unattach himself from the \"Olam HaSheker\", but not to attach to \"emes\" but rather solely to be unattached.</p>\n<p>They view Buddha as a man who achieved a high spiritual level, but not as a god.</p>\n<p>So Buddhism is agnostic (atheistic at worst).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It 's basically spiritist , it does acknowledge spiritual levels , where like the hebrew thought of ATzilut etc.. it atributes levels of spiritual personalities , it's concept of the pure land incarnation is very similar though not in the same dimension(space/time) to that of the promised land concept of the hebrews ... some similarites with deep emphasis on acheiving one's enlightenment through strict disciple and avoidance of desires (earthly ) distinguishes it, it is very naturo spiritual and may be avoda zarah as it constitutes the involment or worship of the elementals or deificaiton of them ( open to observation) - pmge </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The parameters of anger in halacha\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Although I cannot, at the moment, bring to mind specific examples of the Torah stating that it is absolutely forbidden to be angry or act out of anger, I seem to recall seeing this idea many times. </p>\n\n<p>My question is: are there any situations where a Jew is allowed to be angry or act out of anger?</p>\n\n<p>In addition, does it state anywhere explicitly and in a straightforward way that being angry is forbidden?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Maimonides's <em>halacha</em> book, <em>Mishne Tora</em>, includes (<em>Deos</em> 2:3):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Likewise, anger is a very bad trait, and it is fit for a person to distance himself from it to the opposite extreme. And he should teach himself not to anger, even about something that it is fit to be angry about. And if he wants to instill fear in his children and household members (or on the community if he is an officeholder) and wants to anger at them so they return to [do] good, [then] he should display himself before them as though he is angering so as to admonish them, but privately his mind should be settled: like someone who seems angry in his time of anger but isn't angry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>every trait has its place as explained in Chovos Halevavos Gate 3 <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=416#ch10\" rel=\"nofollow\">ch.10</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So, too, there are two traits - anger and satisfaction. Anger is in\n  place when you see a departure from the way of truth and the rule of\n  righteousness, when falsehood prevails over truth and those who follow\n  it.</p>\n  \n  <p>Pas Lechem commentary: when you see people turning away from the way\n  of truth, namely, the way of the torah of truth. He wrote \"way of\n  truth\" corresponding to the commandments between man and G-d and the\n  \"rule of righteousness\" corresponding to those between man and his\n  fellow. Behold, earlier regarding the trait of courage, he wrote \"when\n  you meet the enemies of the L-ord\". There the intent was on the wicked\n  who come to strike out at G-d's torah or His people, as written \"For\n  behold, Your enemies stir, and those who hate You raise their heads;\n  Against Your people they plot cunningly, and they take counsel against\n  Your protected ones; They said, 'Come, let us destroy them from\n  [being] a nation, and the name of Israel will no longer be\n  remembered.'\" (Ps.83:35). There showing anger to them is not enough.\n  Rather one must stand up against them and foil their plans, as written\n  there. For this one needs courage, which is strength of heart, to be\n  moser nefesh (self-sacrificing) in G-d's war, like David in the war\n  against the Philistines, especially in the battle against Goliath, or\n  like the Chashmonaim in the war against the Greeks. Here he is talking\n  about individuals who are being wicked by themselves, and it is enough\n  to show anger to them, to show them that you disapprove of their\n  deeds, and that their deeds are evil in the eyes of G-d. Through this\n  they will feel ashamed and perhaps they will repent.</p>\n  \n  <p>Marpe Lenefesh commentary: when people sway from the way of truth and when the\n  falsehood strengthens over the truth. Likewise it is permitted to be\n  angry at people of falsehood [who adopt the ways of falsehood].)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Assuming that the flavour pack is independent of noodles, does one need a hechsher on ramen?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_noodles\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Next, noodles can be dried in one of two ways: by frying or by hot air drying. Fried instant noodles are dried by oil frying for 1–2 minutes at a temperature of 140-160 degrees Celsius. The frying process decreases the moisture content from 30-50% to 2-5%. Common oils used for frying in North America consist of canola, cottonseed and palm oil mixtures, while only palm oil or palm olein are used in Asia. Air-dried noodles are dried for 30–40 minutes in hot air at a temperature of 70-90 degrees Celsius, resulting in a moisture content of 8-12%. The heat from either drying process will further add to the porous texture of the noodles by gelatinizing the starch even more. More than 80% of instant noodles are fried as it gives more evenly dried noodles than hot air drying which can cause an undesired texture in finished noodles, and also taking longer time to cook. However, with fried noodles, the oil content is about 15-20% and decreases the shelf life of the noodles due to oxidation whereas in hot air-dried noodles it has only 3% oil content maximum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wikipedia doesn't explain where the 3% of oil comes from in the hot air drying process, but in any event it is 20% of the cases. Reading some easily findable <a href=\"http://www.nissinfoods.com/Nutrition/Top%20Ramen%20NF%20Ingredients.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">ingredient panels</a> indicates palm oil as an important ingredient.</p>\n\n<p>Anything containing processed oil, and that includes palm oil, is going to require certification. This is primarily because equipment is used to processes animal fat as oil without any serious attempt to clean it for the other kinds of oil, as it is not regarded as a contaminant. Rabbi Zushe Blech's book <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0813820936\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kosher Food Production</a> contains more detail about this, as well as many other such issues.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do the Nine Measures Apply to the Woman?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=nedarim&daf=20b&go=Go\">Nedarim 20b</a> discusses nine mannerisms which a man should avoid whilst being intimate with his wife. The Talmud says that practicing these nine mannerisms can lead to having obstinate, rebellious children.</p>\n\n<p>These mannerisms are codified both by Maimonides, (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5121.htm\">Hil' Issurei Biah 21</a>:13-14) and Shulhan Aruch (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40527&st=&pgnum=188&hilite=\">OH 240</a>:2-3). Rashi and Rabbeinu Nissim apply this discussion to the man only in their commentaries, as does Maimonides. Rabbi Joseph Cairo does as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do these nine mannerisms apply to the woman as well?</strong> For example: one mannerism is thinking of another woman. If the wife thinks of another man, are these mannerisms violated? Would the children be at risk?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>The <em>Tur</em> indicates that a number of these apply to the woman (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7169\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 25</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Nidah</em> - The woman would at least share responsibility.</li>\n<li><em>Shichrus</em> - This applies if either spouse is intoxicated.</li>\n<li><em>Chatzufa</em> - This applies specifically to a woman who verbally propositions her husband in an explicit manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14243&st=&pgnum=163\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 25:9</a>) mentions that <em>m'riva</em> refers to a situation where there is conflict between husband and wife.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> mentions <em>'irbuvya</em> (lit. \"confused jumble\") as referring to a woman who has had many husbands, and therefore has דיעות הרבה - a reference to her thinking about her previous husbands while cohabiting (see <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=112&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>P'sachim</em> 112a</a>).<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Rashbam (<em>P'sachim</em>, ibid. s.v. \"ארבע דיעות\") indicates that this problem applies equally to divorced men and women who think of their previous spouses while cohabiting. Rashbam classifies this as <em>g'rushas haleiv</em> (\"mental divorce\") rather than <em>'irbuvya</em>.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>In any case, just as it is forbidden for a man to fantasize about a woman other than his wife, it is forbidden for a woman to fantasize about a man other than her husband (<em>Sefer HaChinuch</em> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40631&st=&pgnum=268\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§188</a>; <em>Igros Moshe</em> EH vol. 1, §69).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>On the other hand, see <em>Tosafos</em>, who suggests (as the second of three suggestions) that a widower may not remarry until three festivals have passed so that he will not think about his former wife when cohabiting with his new wife (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=12&daf=23&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Mo'ed Katan</em> 23a</a>, s.v. עד שיעברו שלשה רגלים).

Judging by the name of this category, it does not seem to include the corresponding case of a wife thinking about another man. Perhaps Rashi would say that the Talmud omits this case because it is considered less common.</sub></p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>Rashi (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=16&daf=20b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>N'darim</em> 20b</a>, s.v.\"בני ערבוביא\") provides various alternative explanations of <em>'irbuvya</em>, two of which apply to the woman. The first one refers to a promiscuous woman who doesn't know the paternity of her child, and the second case refers to a woman who doesn't know the paternity of her child because she remarried and became pregnant within a short period of time. </sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19987&st=&pgnum=402&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Reishis Chachma, Shaar HaKedusha, Chapter 16, Shaar 4</a> seems to imply that all matters of thought and their effects in this area apply equally to the woman as to the man.</p>\n\n\n",

Paragraph 18 there says he may not give of the food to others, and the <em>S'ma</em> (38) clarifies that it's considered theft and that he's required to pay for the amount stolen. (He does not say the recipient is required to, which would be the analogue to your question.)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the analogy is imperfect<sup>[1]</sup>, but it's pretty close, I think. As always, consult your rabbi with any practical questions.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>[1] </sup>For one thing, an all-you-can-eat bar is usually literally all you can eat (or as much as is in stock), whereas a worker is not allowed to engage in <em>achila gasa</em>, excessive consumption.

It's generally set up pretty standard, Shulchan Aruch in the center in block font with the main commentaries (e.g. Taz and Shach in Yoreh Deah) surrounding it Vilna-Shas-style in Rashi font. Then a whole host of commentaries below and in the outer margin.

Because of their desire to keep the Tzuras Hadaf, the commentaries on the bottom are in quite small font-size, so if you have trouble reading very small print, that might be a problem.</li>\n<li>Relatively speaking, there are a lot of supplementary commentaries in the back, after the main text of the Shulchan Aruch section. When I looked in the volume I was going to be studying, which was the Hilchos Niddah and Mikvaos volume, it had the most supplemental material when compared with that volume of any other set. It had the regulars, like Chavos Daas and Sidrei Tahara and Machatzis HaShekel, but also some things you wouldn't necessarily expect to find back there, like the Raavad's Baal Hanefesh, the Ramban's Hilchos Niddah, and the Rashba's Toras HaBayis, which have proved useful. Everything is in clear nicely-formatted print.</li>\n<li>Most everything is in-text or side-note cited (e.g. quotations/citations from the Talmud or from other commentaries) and it is quite difficult to find typos (unlike in the old Shulchan Aruchs which were full of them), but they still do exist. There are occasional notes about previous printer errors when relevant (for example, a note that the Taz and Shach had a different <em>girsa</em> in S\"A or Rama or had the S\"A and Rama reversed).</li>\n<li>The binding seems pretty sturdy, although I have only had the set for about a year. The one volume that I use regularly is fine without any signs of the binding weakening.</li>\n<li>It is a sixteen volume set. When I was shopping for a set, I was comparing to the only other available Tur Shulchan Aruch set, which was HaBahir, which was 20+ volumes. This means that this set takes up less space, although the volumes are, in general, thicker. The entire set fits on one shelf of my standard Ikea bookshelf (about 31\" wide, I think). It also means that this set was significantly cheaper.</li>\n<li>One downside that is occasionally annoying is that many words and phrases are abbreviated. For example, numbers are always in their letter equivalent (e.g. \"כ\" instead of \"עשרים\") and <em>roshei teivos</em> have not been expanded as they are in the Mechon Yerushalayim set.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To be honest, if money wasn't an issue, the way to go would be Machon Yerushalayim, which I believe recently completed (or at least is soon-to-complete) the full Shulchan Aruch set. But if you're looking for something nice that is more reasonably priced, the Shulchan Melachim Tzuras HaDaf fits the bill.</p>\n\n<p>Looking around a bit, I see an Israeli site listing for 1489 ILS (~$435). In America, I would imagine it goes for closer to $600.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The most beautiful print is the shulchan aruch habahir. It does not have tzuras hadaf, and there are no added maareh mikomos. Whether or not it has typos, old or new, I wouldnt say, I've never checked or used it much being that i do like having the old tzuras hadaf.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Mitzvah to study/know history?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard someone once mention that chazal tell us that it is a mitzvah to review, know, or study secular history. Is that true?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>In several places, I've seen people reference the pasuk, זְכֹר יְמוֹת עוֹלָם, בִּינוּ שְׁנוֹת דֹּר-וָדֹר (Devarim 32:7), as a general imperative to study history, but this isn't stated explicitly in Chazal or Rishonim, (and by only one posek, see below) as far as I'm aware. Instead, they do <em>prohibit</em> reading ספרים חיצונים (see Sanedrin 100b), which the Rambam (on Mishnayos; intro to Cheilek) believes includes books of דברי הימים, which is usually understood to be equivalent to historical works. Many poskim (such as the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=208\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch O.C. 307:17</a>, and the contemporary work \"The Shabbos Home\" by R. Simcha Cohen, pg 57) seem to adhere to this view as well, and prohibit reading works of history.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, R. Yaakov Emden writes (Mor U'Ktziah O.C. 307) regarding books of Jewish history, specifically Shevet Yehudah, that נכון וראוי לכל איש יהודי לעיין בו ולידע עניניו, and he says that the final book of Josephus' War of the Jews should be read around Tish'a Be'Av time. While he sees value in appreciating Hashem's guidance of the Jewish people through history, he doesn't quote the pasuk above, and writes specifically that there is no value in studying general world history (though he does say that one may read from them when leisure is appropriate, לעתות הטיול כדחליש לבא מגרסא). This passage is quoted approvingly by a teshuvah of the Maharitz Chajes as well. Importantly, it seems like the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=208\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna Berurah (307:58)</a> agrees as well, as he writes that Sefer Yosipon, Yuchsin, and Shevet Yehudah are all appropriate reading, as they cause one to increase his fear of Heaven. </p>\n\n<p>Several modern poskim have seen more of a value in studying history. R. Hirsch, in his commentary to the pasuk in Devarim 32:7 does indicate that the Torah is telling us to study history, and like, R. Yaakov Emden, to do it \"with the ears of Isaiah\", with an eye towards looking for Hashem's guidance of historical events. An even more positive view is expressed by R. Chaim David Halevi in Shu\"t Aseh Lecha Rav (4:6) where he writes that there is indeed a mitzvah to study history, both as fulfillment of the pasuk above as well as Yirmiyahu 6:15. He also writes that we can extrapolate from the numerous places where the Torah tells us to remember specific events (such as Egypt, Sinai, and the events surrounding Miriam)  that the Torah wants us to be conscious of our past.</p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish (Emunah UBitachon 1:8) also writes beautifully, דברי הימים וקורות עולם הם מאלפים הרבה את החכם בדרכו ועל תולדות העבר ייסד אדני חכמתו - \"words of history and world events are highly educational in showing the way to the wise, and upon the happenings of the past should wound build the foundations of his wisdom\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Divrei hayamim shel medinos acheiros is called sifrei chiztoni by the bartenura in the begining of cheillek and in hilchos shabbos the shulchan aruch reffers to it in similar terms, so if anything, the burden of proof would be to say that its not an aveira to read.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>Remembering Sinai</strong>\nThe ramban counts the rememberance of the event of Sinai one of the 613 biblical commandments\nBased on the verse\n  רַק הִשָּׁמֶר לְךָ וּשְׁמֹר נַפְשְׁךָ מְאֹד פֶּן תִּשְׁכַּח אֶת הַדְּבָרִים אֲשֶׁר רָאוּ עֵינֶיךָ וּפֶן יָסוּרוּ מִלְּבָבְךָ כֹּל יְמֵי חַיֶּיךָ וְהוֹדַעְתָּם לְבָנֶיךָ וְלִבְנֵי בָנֶיךָ: יוֹם אֲשֶׁר עָמַדְתָּ לִפְנֵי ה<code>אֱלֹהֶיךָ בְּחֹרֵב בֶּאֱמֹר ה</code> אֵלַי הַקְהֶל לִי אֶת הָעָם וְאַשְׁמִעֵם אֶת דְּבָרָי אֲשֶׁר יִלְמְדוּן לְיִרְאָה אֹתִי כָּל הַיָּמִים אֲשֶׁר הֵם חַיִּים עַל הָאֲדָמָה וְאֶת בְּנֵיהֶם יְלַמֵּדוּן: </p>\n\n<p>`הכתוב הזה לפי דעתי מצות לא תעשה, הזהיר בה מאד, כי כאשר אמר שנזהר בכל המצות ונשמור החוקים והמשפטים לעשותם, חזר ואמר רק אני מזהירך מאד להשמר ולשמור עצמך מאד מאד לזכור מאין באו אליך המצות, שלא תשכח מעמד הר סיני מכל הדברים אשר ראו שם עיניך הקולות והלפידים את כבודו ואת גדלו ודבריו אשר שמעת שם מתוך האש, ותודיע כל הדברים אשר ראו עיניך במעמד הנכבד ההוא לבניך ולבני בניך עד עולם.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remembering the exodus from egypt</strong>\nSome regard as a biblical commandment based on this verse \n- לְמַעַן תִּזְכֹּר אֶת יוֹם צֵאתְךָ מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם כֹּל יְמֵי חַיֶּיךָ: (דברים ט\"ז)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remembering what amalek did to us</strong>\nThe sefer Hacharedim counts this as one of the 613 \nBased on the verse \n זָכוֹר אֵת אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה לְךָ עֲמָלֵק בַּדֶּרֶךְ בְּצֵאתְכֶם מִמִּצְרָיִם: אֲשֶׁר קָרְךָ בַּדֶּרֶךְ וַיְזַנֵּב בְּךָ כָּל הַנֶּחֱשָׁלִים אַחַרֶיךָ וְאַתָּה עָיֵף וְיָגֵעַ וְלֹא יָרֵא אֱלֹהִים: וְהָיָה בְּהָנִיחַ יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ לְךָ מִכָּל אֹיְבֶיךָ מִסָּבִיב בָּאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ נֹתֵן לְךָ נַחֲלָה לְרִשְׁתָּהּ תִּמְחֶה אֶת זֵכֶר עֲמָלֵק מִתַּחַת הַשָּׁמָיִם לֹא תִּשְׁכָּח: (דברים כ\"ה</p>\n\n<p><strong>**Remembering the golden Calf **</strong>\nזְכֹר אַל תִּשְׁכַּח אֵת אֲשֶׁר הִקְצַפְתָּ אֶת יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ בַּמִּדְבָּר: (דברים ט'). \nAccording to the Ramban, one of the 613 </p>\n\n<p><strong>Remembering the incident with Miriam</strong>\nזָכוֹר אֵת אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ לְמִרְיָם בַּדֶּרֶךְ בְּצֵאתְכֶם מִמִּצְרָיִם: (דברים כ\"ד\nAccording to the ramban one of the 613</p>\n\n\n",

While Artscroll is known for it's explanation, Koren has a lot of the explanation in the English translation of the running text as well as in the notes section. Diagrams and illustrations are brought in to clarify the text. It really depends on the page that you're on in any given tractate if there are more notes in the Artscroll or the Koren. I would reference Koren's version of Tractate Shekalim which has an abundance of explanation. </p>\n\n<p>What I like best about the Koren Steinsaltz however is that you can follow in the flow of the discussion in the English translation which I find is very difficult with the Artscroll.

Someone was almost in a car accident, barely missing what would have been a horrific outcome and asked the rav if he should bentch gomel. The rav responded that perhaps he himself should bentch gomel because the pants he was wearing went through the washing machine and, had he been wearing them at the time, it too would have been horrible.  </p>\n\n<p>The better answer is in a tshuva from Rav Moshe who differentiates between flying in a plane and driving in a car as it pertains to making a birchas gomel.

Now, one determined resident of Samaria appears to have found a \"smoking gun\", documenting how local Arabs have been damaging olive trees and then reporting the incidents to authorities and the media as \"price tag\" attacks carried out by local Jews.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Price tagging\" is a phenomenon associated with fringe elements of the Israeli Right, in which assailants vandalize Arab-owned property in revenge for terrorist attacks or military demolitions of Jewish homes (which are often instigated by Arab claims). On occasion, \"price taggers\" have targeted army property as well, in response to demolitions and other orders carried out against Jewish communities and property by Israeli authorities.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, on a number of occasions suspected \"price tag\" incidents have been proven false or staged by Arab and left-wing activists, who purposely damage Arab-owned property in an attempt to blame nearby Jewish communities.</p>\n  \n  <p>Jewish community leaders in Judea and Samaria have regularly expressed concern that \"price tag\" accusations are being used by left-wing and Arab extremists as part of a campaign of anti-Jewish incitement.</p>\n  \n  <p>Those fears appear to be well-founded. Recently, a group of Jews were kidnapped and severely beaten by Arab villagers from the village of Kusra, in Samaria. The attackers justified their actions by claiming the Jewish group had been on their way to carry out a price tag attack, and were feted by left-wing activists and media personalities; the victims, meanwhile, claimed they were in fact hiking near the village when they were ambushed.</p>\n  \n  <p>Despite the media circus having resulted in the arrest of some of the Jewish victims of the assault, no evidence of any wrongdoing on their part has been uncovered. On the contrary, the victims were unarmed at the time, and had nothing in their possession to indicate they were involved or planning any foul play.</p>\n  \n  <p>On occasion, Jewish residents have been able to provide photographic and videotaped proof of staged provocations by Arab and leftist extremists - but this may be the most convincing evidence to date of the truth of this claim.</p>\n  \n  <p>The investigation was started by 27-year-old \"K\", after he faced accusations of carrying out price tag attacks - accusations he has strenuously denied.

Some wore Red Crescent vests, in the hope that this would allow them to enjoy a kind of immunity.</p>\n  \n  <p>What they were doing was clearly suspicious, Kaniel said.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"This is not pruning carried out after the harvest, in which smaller branches are cut off,\" he told Arutz Sheva. \"They chopped down the trees at the trunk.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"We are talking about dozens of trees,\" he added. \"K. almost cried when he told me about it.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>K was arrested only two months ago on suspicion that he carried out precisely this type of attack.

Indeed, in the Yerushalmi Pesahim (6:1), the teaching that one does not make a g'zera shava himself is taught by R. Yossi bar Bun in the name of R. Abba bar Mamal, and he himself states that a person can make a g'zera shava to support his teaching:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' יוסה בי רבי בון בשם רבי בא בר ממל <strong>אדם דן גזירה שוה לקיים תלמודו</strong> ואין אדם דן גז\"ש לבטל תלמודו. רבי יוסי בי רבי בון בשם ר' בא בר ממל אדם דן ק\"ו לעצמו <strong>ואין אדם דן גזרה שוה לעצמו</strong> לפיכך משיבין מק\"ו ואין מושיבין מגזרה שוה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_ben_Naphtali_Fr%C3%A4nkelhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_ben_Naphtali_Fr%C3%A4nkel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Korban HaEdah</a> there (s.v. Adam Dan) explains that in a case where someone has a tradition about a law, one can then make his own g'zera shava to support it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אדם דן גזרה שוה. מעצמו לקיים תלמודו שקיבל מרבו דאין הפסד בדבר שהרי בלאו הכי הדין כן ואין גזרה שוה זו אלא לסמוך בעלמא </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%A8_%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Alei Tamar</a> to Yerushalmi Kilayim (9:1) uses the aforementioned Yerushalmi to explain cases of g'zera shava involving words in Nakh. Obviously those weren't Sinaic, so at some point somebody made it up. These are okay, however, since such a case isn't an actual g'zera shava, but a mere rabbinic asmakhta.

A female non-Jewish visitor need not cover her hair, but -- especially in Orthodox synagogues -- should minimize skin exposure by wearing longer sleeves, knee-length or longer skirts/dresses, and a modestly-cut collar.  It would be best if you can find a Jewish member to go with you to help guide you.  If you don't know anyone, don't be shy ... ask someone who looks like they know what they're doing.  Orthodox services are in Hebrew almost exclusively, conservative congregations use less and announce pages, but still it may be hard to find your page.  If offered an honor, such as taking out the Torah, or getting an aliyah (an honor at the Torah reading), gently turn down the offer by explaining you're not Jewish and not entitled to the honor until you complete conversion.  Also, don't put on a prayer shawl -- while there's no real law against it, a non-Jew doesn't have the commandment to wear one, so its a bit tacky IMHO.  Some rabbis endorse wearing a tallis for their married conversion candidates before the formal conversion ceremony.  Consult your local rabbi to be sure.</p>\n\n<p>As to your prayers -- by all means, say any prayer from your heart that is directly to God, but I would encourage you to follow along in the prayer book to get an idea of how Jews pray.  Much of our prayer book contains entire chapters or verses of many psalms.  </p>\n\n<p>Introduce yourself to the rabbi.  Tell him that for now you're trying to decide if conversion is for you.  You don't need to start learning with him (or his designee) until you're ready.  But ask him if there are general adult education classes you can attend.</p>\n\n<p>As for books, I hope you've started collecting some.  <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0465086322\" rel=\"nofollow\">To Be a Jew</a> by Donin, and \n<a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0824603508\" rel=\"nofollow\">Becoming a Jew</a> by Maurice Lamm are helpful.  Rabbi Lamm's book has a chapter with a personal story about a first visit to a synagogue by a prospective convert.  An excerpt of my personal story is in that book, also, at page 38.  Good luck.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I have met people who have converted and who would go to shul while they were studying for conversion. However, they were careful to do so under the supervision of the rabbi who was teaching them and advising them on each step of the way. For example, how to \"violate\" the shabbat in some way, what to say, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Many nonJews put on a yarmulkeh when going to a shul as a sign of respect and not to look different. This is done even if they are not contemplating conversion.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the point of Davening/Praying\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the point of praying?</p>\n\n<p>It is for sure not because Hashem needs/wants it. (Hashem is not lacking in any way he is infinite, and thus does not need our tefillos or our mitzvos)</p>\n\n<p>And it seems that the point of davening is more saying the words then thinking the words -- the proof of that is because davening is not accepted if you only think (and not say) the words and there meaning.</p>\n\n<p>But on the other hand it is accepted if you only say the words and not think the meaning of the words. </p>\n\n<p>So even though I agree that thinking the meaning of the words are important but we see from this that saying the words is more important and the main point of davening appears to be just saying the words. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So what is the point of just saying words?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I once heard the following explanation:</p>\n\n<p>The word to pray is להתפלל, which is the passive reflexive of פלל, judge.  So להתפלל means to cause one's self to be judged.  The purpose of prayer is to put yourself before Hashem and test how sincerely you see Him as the source of your needs.</p>\n\n<p>So, indeed, the prayer is not \"for\" Hashem, nor is it to make sure He knows what you need.  It is for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>In response to edited form of question:</p>\n\n<p>This would still require performing the act of davening, just like in any Mitzvah with a given purpose, you still have to do the action.  If you were to know the \"message\" of lulav, you would still have to take the lulav and not just meditate on the message.  This is true of all mitzvos<sup>1</sup>.  There are a number of explanations for why this is true, but Sefer HaChinuch explains this to be because it is through the actions that we internalize the message of mitzvos, and the same would apply for this mitzva as well - in order to make it real to ourselves that we are standing before Hashem, we have to actually do it.</p>\n\n<p>Nefesh HaChaim discusses this point explicitly, specifically regarding davening - the mitzvah of davening is fulfilled only through the speech aspect of it, and yet it is called עבודה שבלב, service of the heart.  Just like in every mitzvah the mitzvah is only fulfilled through the action of the mitzvah, so to in davening the fulfillment of the mitzvah is through the action, even though the \"idea\" of davening is focused in the heart.</p>\n\n<p>End of 2:1</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מנם כל עיקר ענין טהרת הלב. היא רק למצוה ולא לעכובא גם לענין התפלה אף שנקראת עבודה שבלב כמו שנתבאר קצת לעיל סוף ש\"א שהעיקר בכל המצות היא המעשה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>End of 2:14</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגהה: והגם שהלכה פסוקה בש\"ס שתפלה נאמרת בכל לשון. היינו לצאת ידי מצות תפלה כמו שנתבאר לעיל סוף ש\"א שבכל המצות ואפי' מצות תפלה שנקראת עבודה שבלב. עכ\"ז עיקרן לעכובא הוא חלק המעשי שבהן. אמנם למצוה מן המובחר ודאי צריך לצרף גם טוהר המחשבה וכוונה שלימה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>One could ask the same question about any mitzvah - \"If I shake a Lulav and don't think about it at all, I have fulfilled the mitzvah, but if I think about every message and lesson involved in the mitzvah and don't do it, I haven't fulfilled the mitzvah.  So what is so inherently special about shaking a palm frond?\"  The act of the mitzvah may be the basic framework of the mitzvah, but the intent put into the action is what directs that action and gives it meaning.  See Nefesh HaChaim quoted later on in this answer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Because it changes your perspective! \nPraying helps you reset your internal GPS and re-think where your priorities should lie. That's why praying works - the person who finishes praying is different than the person who began praying. This new person may now deserve things which he did not deserve several moments prior. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly G-d wants the best for us, part of this is that he wants us to have a relationship with Him and daven to Him. Think of it like opening a spigot on a barrel. There can be much in it but you can't access it until the spigot is opened. To continue this analogy one doesn't need many spigots, the sum of what you get is the same. On a related note, Hashem waited to grow crops until man davened for it. Just to make sure that man would appreciate where it was coming from. Prayer was crucial in this process. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The simplest answer is that we pray because Hashem commanded us to. See <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/613.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, #22, #23 and #24.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever He gets out of it is the same answer to what He gets out of any Mitzvah, and prayer isn't unique in that regard.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, when it comes to prayer, it intuitively feels like there should be more to it than that. Answers to that span volumes. Rabbi Nissan Mindel <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15782&st=&pgnum=12&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">explains</a> (based on Moreh Nevuchim) by praying we are establishing to ourselves that G-d is in charge of the outcome, not happenstance. That is the simplest end of the explanation. On the other end is the Kabbalistic one, that prayer changes the very relationship between G-d and the world, with many other ways in-between.</p>\n\n<p>The idea that in Davening the point is only to say the words without intention, this is not true. Although besides a few things understanding the <em>specifics</em> of the words being said, if davening in Hebrew, is not necessary, it has been well argued before that a general intention of standing before G-d is required, but that is really a topic for a separate question.</p>\n\n\n",

It continues that from here you can understand why people say that if we would see great miracles, we would return to hashem. However we would act in the same way. Rav Yisroel Salant would ask why people who work in burial of people don't live with the concept of remember the day of death.

It is the same strength from G-d.\"</p>\n<p>What should Bilaam have concluded? He should have concluded that he was not using his power of speech correctly, and he should turn back.

Haza'ah and Eliyahu ha-Navi in a marketplace in Be Lapat, which a note in my Soncino translation says is in Khuzistan.  R. Beroka asks Eliyahu if anybody in this market merits a place in Olam Haba and Eliyahu says no, but he later amends this to identify three people who do, two jesters and a jailor who at great risk protects Jews from harm by gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>From the details of the story it's clear that there is at least something of a Jewish community in this place (the jailor is a secret Jew who reports to the rabbis what the gentiles are decreeing against them).  The mishna in Sanhedrin 10:1 says that all Israel has a place in Olam Haba except for a very few (enumerated).  So what's going on in this market?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is Be Lapat populated by those few Jews who really <em>don't</em> merit a place in Olam Haba?  (Including R. Beroka?)</p></li>\n<li><p>Maybe there are plenty of Jews there who merit Olam Haba but they avoid the market for some reason?</p></li>\n<li><p>Maybe Eliyahu is being uncharacteristically harsh?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Rabbi <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%9D_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A8\">Avraham Chayim Schorr</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14742&st=&pgnum=64\"><em>Toras Chayim</em> to <em>Sanhedrin</em> 90a</a>) addresses this question and concludes that this refers to people who would merit immediate admission to <em>olam haba</em> without any prior suffering of the soul.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>R' <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadok_HaKohen\">Tzadok of Lublin</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22211&st=&pgnum=179\"><em>P'ri Tzadik</em>, <em>Vayikra</em>, <em>Lag Ba'Omer V'siyum HaShas</em>, §3</a>) provides an alternative explanation.

Indeed it seems that the question was posed in a milling crowd of people, as Elijah at first says no, and <em>then</em> notices the Jailor, who is hurrying by as R' Beroka must run to catch him. A similar situation occurs with the Jesters, who Elijah notices as they walk by. Jews were likely a minority in the province at that time, so Gentiles were probably more commonly seen than Jews, certainly in specific areas of a market. Consider for example the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Quarter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muslim quarter of Old Jerusalem</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Also, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khuzestan_Province#People_and_culture\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khuzestan</a> is a whole province in Iran. I do not think it is unreasonable to say that within a province different areas are populated by Jews and different areas are not. The same is true of any city with a Jewish population.</p>\n\n<p>One could thus argue that R' Beroka was on some errand in a Gentile-occupied area of either the market, or the province, (which was close to the governing body of the province, hence the jailor's presence), <strong>and that a crowd of Gentiles is being surveyed</strong>, all of whom have not yet merited a share in the world to come, for one reason or another.</p>\n\n\n",

Heshbon Nefesh to the very depths may reveal something. Correct that, and if Eliyahu does not appear, repeat process. That is the striving to perfection, striving to holiness that is the Jewish philosophy, with the understanding that that perfection is unattainable.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Seeing the question only after it was edited it seems to me like a fine question.<BR>\nI am only answering the end of your question why some holy people have not seen Eliyahu, not the beginning where you ask what it takes. There is a common saying that I will apply here, \"Those who see him don't say and those who say didn't see him\". (There may be exceptions that a godol will tell it over for a necessity). In other words a person who merits to see Eliyahu will certainly be on such a high level that his modesty would not allow him to speak about it as this will appear boastful. That said, I think there is a false premise in the question that you would know about it if someone saw Eliyahu, I think that is entirely not true, rather they have just not told about it. <BR> Regarding your return to the question, if someone is wondering about himself, \"why have I not seen Eliyahu am I not on the level?\", I would explain that seeing Eliyahu is some degree of a miracle being that it is not a natural experience. So, unless there is a special reason and purpose for someone to see Eliyahu then no matter what level he is on, Hashem wont reveal Eliyahu to him for no purpose because Hashem doesnt create miracles for nothing. So if you think you are on the level and that it would be good for you spiritually, to see Eliyahu, perhaps Hashem feels otherwise that it isn't right for you. There may be nothing more to do, it just isn't the right time or maybe this itself is a test to see how your Emunah stands up in the face of disappointment.</p>\n\n\n",

There are a few options (<a href=\"http://www.bethdin.org/docs/PDF1-Layman%27s_Guide.pdf\">http://www.bethdin.org/docs/PDF1-Layman%27s_Guide.pdf</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the event that there is an existing agreement to come to a particular beth din (for \n  example, if the parties signed a contract which refers any disputes to a particular beth din), \n  the beth din can hold a din torah in the absence of the person who was summoned. The \n  beth din considers the evidence that the claimant brings and issues a ruling on that basis. </p>\n  \n  <p>Otherwise, the summoning bet din generally issues a “heter arkaos,” which grants \n  permission to the plaintiff to go to secular court, so the defendant does not simply avoid a \n  hearing. </p>\n  \n  <p>A summoning beth din may issue a “seruv,” or a contempt order. A seruv is simply a public \n  declaration by a beth din that someone was summoned to beth din but refused to meet their \n  obligation under Jewish law to appear in front of the beth din. Sometimes, Jewish \n  communities or synagogues impose sanctions on such people, such as not giving them \n  aliyos (being called up to the reading of the Torah) or refraining from social interaction, to \n  pressure the person to meet their obligation. The beth din is not necessarily involved at \n  that point – the community or synagogue decides what measures are appropriate. </p>\n  \n  <p>Occasionally a summoning beth din may issue an “ikul,” a restraining order. The Beth Din of \n  America seldom does so. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At least at the Beth Din of America, the decisions are legally binding because the Beit Din acts as a legal arbitrator. <a href=\"http://www.bethdin.org/arbitration-mediation.asp\">http://www.bethdin.org/arbitration-mediation.asp</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.bethdin.org/docs/PDF3-Binding_Arbitration_Agreement.pdf\">http://www.bethdin.org/docs/PDF3-Binding_Arbitration_Agreement.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Based on the below paragraph (<a href=\"http://www.bethdin.org/cases.asp\">http://www.bethdin.org/cases.asp</a>) it would seem that for these purposes a Beit Din really is just 3 arbitrary judges (knowlegable, observant men), and they may be chosen in any way as long as the parties agree, or a special procedure is followed. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Someone receiving a summons is generally not obligated to agree to go specifically to the summoning beth din, although he or she is obligated to either settle the case or go to a beth din. If the person being summoned does not want to go to the summoning beth din, then he or she must propose an alternative beth din. If the parties cannot find a mutually acceptable beth din, a “joint beth din” is formed by a procedure called “zebla” or “zabla.” In zabla, each side picks one judge. The two judges that were picked select a third judge together, and the three judges together form the beth din that will decide the case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "How can you get Ka'asher Zamam if you became a Chalal",
    "content": "# How can you get Ka'asher Zamam if you became a Chalal\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a rule that <em>Ka'asher Zamam vilo Ka'asher Asa</em>: the second set of witnesses have to appear in court \"before the punishment\" in order that the first witnesses get the punishment <em>Ka'asher Zamam</em>. And it has to be after the court set out his punishment.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Two witnesses come to court and say that Rueven killed Shimon, so the court checks out whether they are true. Let's say they look like valid witnesses and the court says Rueven is subject to death by sword. Then the second pair of witnesses who make the first <em>aydim zomim</em> have to come between now and the actual chopping off of the head of Rueven: two witnesses come to court and say \"You were with us etc\" making the first set <em>aydim zomim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: if this happens but instead of death the punishment is that the defendant becomes a <em>challal</em> (the first witnesses instead said that Rueven (who is a <em>cohen</em>) is a <em>ben grusha</em>, son of a divorcee) so there is no time between when court says he is a challal and actually becoming a challal. What then?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Limmud for \"before the punishment\" is from Kaasher Zamam, not Kaasher Asu (what they planned to do, not what they succeeded in doing).</p>\n\n<p>With a Challal, when the Eidim are made Zomminim, the whole Challal is undone and it is as if it never happened. So in the end they were only planning, they didn't succeed, so they are still under to the din of Kaasher Zamam.</p>\n\n<p>The Riva in Tosfos takes this further (Bava Kama 4b <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=21&daf=4b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">ועדים זוממין</a>) and says that this applies to any monetary payment as well. Since it is possible to return it, it is not something that they succeeded in doing. (The Ri gives a different reason, and thus would have to answer this question like Tosfos in Makkos 2a <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=25&daf=2&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">מעידין אנו באיש פלוני שהוא בן גרושה</a> that the entire verse is not applicable. They don't get \"what they intended\" - they get lashes instead - so there is no limitation of \"what they intended and not what they succeeded in doing\" as well).</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (Eidus <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e220.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">20:2</a>) goes even further and says the <em>only</em> time we apply Kaasher Zamam VeLo Kaasher Asu is with regards to the death penalty. In all other cases (including lashes) the Eidim get punished whether or not they succeeded in their plan.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of ink has been spilled to justify the underlying reasoning of this statement in the Rambam.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I could read your question in one of two ways - how do we punish the Eidim Zomimin, or why do we punish them as we do, since it's already Ka'asher Asah - and so I'm going to try to answer both in one shot.</p>\n\n<p>Mishnah in Makkos 2a (translation that follows is my own free translation; the brackets are my own addition to help understand the Mishnah):</p>\n\n<p>\"How are witnesses turned into Zommemin [yet don't receive the punishment they tried conveying onto the defendant - Gemara]? [For instance, if the witnesses said,] 'We testify that Ploni is the son of a divorcee or Chalutzah,' we don't say that [the witnesses] should become children of divorcees or Chalutzos instead of him [since they're also Kohanim - Rashi], but rather, we give them Makkos. [Another case: if the witnesses said,] 'We testify that Ploni killed b'shogeig,' we don't say that [the witnesses] should be exiled [to the Ir Miklat] instead of him, but rather, we give them Makkos.\"</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps one could infer from here that there's a difference between a <em>punishment</em> imposed on a person and a <em>status change</em> imposed on a person. What both of these cases have in common is that the <em>status</em> of the person changes, from a Kohen to a Challal in the first case and from a free man to a ben Golah in the second case. Thus, one <em>can't</em> give them the punishment they wanted to impose on the other person, because there <em>is</em> no punishment. Thus, there's no issue of Ka'asher Asah, because they never caused anyone to be punished!</p>\n\n<p>Ay, you'll ask me, why isn't Ir Miklat considered a punishment? According to the Rambam (Moreh Nevuchim 3:40), there's no issue, as the entire inyan of Ir Miklat is for the benefit of the family of the deceased and not to punish the murderer. But even according to the Sefer HaChinuch (410), who says that it's to show the murderer that he must be more careful with how his actions impact other people emotionally, you could still argue that it's not a punishment, per se, so much as a lesson prompted by something that he did.</p>\n\n<p>If you think that it's a little far-fetched to say that there's a difference between punishment and change in status, I'll bring you a proof from the rule of kim lei k'dirabah minei. As we know (IIRC it comes up in Makkos 4a-b), if a person is obligated in multiple punishments, he is only given the worst one. Thus, if a person kills intentionally, chas v'shalom, and, while he's at it, damages the victim's clothing, he is patur for paying for the clothing, since he's chayiv misah.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what about the Oneis, Mefateh, and Motzi Sheim Ra? All of them are chayiv to pay a k'nas, to pay the boshes and p'gam payments (at least by the first two), and to marry and never divorce the victim. Now, I understand that payments can be merged into one \"punishment\" for the sake of kim lei k'dirabah minei. But why does he have to pay at all, since he's forced to marry her? Perhaps it's the same concept: only the payments are considered punishments; the requirement to marry her is a change in his status from \"single\" to \"married.\"</p>\n\n\n",

It is my understanding that the Pharisees were a small ancient sect, and that any Christian view of them as immoral or hypocritical would have no bearing on modern connotations (and thus potential offense) to any presently living ethnicity or religion.</p>\n\n<p>As it is my wish to avoid even entirely unintended offense, I would greatly appreciate guidance in whether I might need to avoid this term or whether it is highly unlikely to offend any living Jewish person.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The term \"pharisaical\" is offensive to many Jews (me included) because it denigrates some of our most respected rabbis.</p>\n\n<p>When Jews think of Pharisees, they think of the sect at the end of the Second Temple period (circa 0 CE) that became the basis for rabbinic Judaism. This group could be contrasted with other parties of the day such as Zealots (who wanted a war with Rome), Sadducees (the wealthier \"Establishment\" who accommodated Roman and Greek practices and denied certain religious tenets), and the Essenes (separatist/puritan types who withdrew from society). The Pharisees walked a middle course that did not <em>like</em> Rome, but did not want to start a war or withdraw from the world.  They primarily wanted to learn, teach, and increase the piety of the Jewish population. Notable Pharisees from this time period would be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillel_the_Elder\">Hillel</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shammai\">Shammai</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohanan_ben_Zakkai\">Yohanan ben Zakkai</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, when Christians think of Pharisees, they think of examples like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_2#Healing_of_a_paralytic\">Gospel of Mark</a>, where Jesus argues with the Pharisees regarding him forgiving sin (which according to the Pharisees and thus Rabbinic Judaism to this day, only G-d can do). The Gospels of Matthew and Luke go further, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woes_of_the_Pharisees\">listing various hypocrisies</a> and portraying them as letter-of-the-law literalists without compassion.  This distorted picture is very offensive to Jews who consider it early Christian anti-Semitic propaganda.</p>\n\n<p>By analogy, imagine if someone you admired (I don't know who you like, say George Washington or Gandhi) had their name or title made a synonym for immoral or unethical behavior.  Wouldn't you be offended too?</p>\n\n<p>Copied from \"English Language and Usage\" Stack Exchange:</p>\n\n<pre><code>pharisee  (lowercase) a sanctimonious, self-righteous, or hypocritical person.\n\npharisaic  Hypocritically self-righteous and condemnatory.\n</code></pre>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>It is inexact to say that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees\">Pharisees</a> were a \"small sect\". Most common Jews followed the teachings of the rabbinic Pharisees, as opposed to those of other sects like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadducees\">Sadducees</a> (see Josephus' <em>Antiquities of the Jews</em> 8:10:5,6). Modern talmudic/rabbinic Jews (including most frequent users of this site) consider themselves as following in the tradition of the Pharisees. </p>\n\n<p>The stereotype of Pharisees as 'pretentious', 'hypocritical', or 'self-righteous' probably derives from the behavior of individuals that pretended to be Pharisees so that people would think they were righteous. The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=22b&format=text\"><em>Sotah</em> 22b</a>) discusses these imposters, and mentions that they fall into seven categories:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>People who act righteous for ulterior motives, such as to be honored </li>\n<li>People who shuffle their feet in a display of false humility</li>\n<li>Men who bump their heads into walls because they go to the extreme of never looking where they walk (lest they see a woman)</li>\n<li>People who walk with bowed heads in a display of false humility</li>\n<li>People who falsely brag of having fulfilled all possible religious duties</li>\n<li>People who act piously solely for the sake of receiving reward</li>\n<li>People who act piously solely out of fear of punishment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>King <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Jannaeus\">Yanai</a>, himself a Sadducee and hostile to Pharisees, admitted to his wife that true Pharisees were benign and would not harm them even though Yanai had killed most of the Pharisee sages (ibid.; see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=66&format=text\"><em>Kidushin</em> 66a</a>). However, he warned his wife that the false Pharisees could be a threat, as they were potentially violent and vindictive.</p>\n\n<p>So it depends on the context/usage. I can't speak for others, but it would seem that using 'Pharisaical' as a synonym for 'pretentious', 'hypocritical', or 'self-righteous' would be offensive. It would also be considered a gross mischaracterization of the Pharisees' behavior and personality, as true Pharisees were vehemently opposed to behavior that was pretentious, hypocritical or self-righteous (see, for example, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirkei_Avot#Ethical_principles\">the tractate of <em>Avos</em></a>). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Names often carry within them the intention of the one who speaks and uses them. The word \"Jew\" can be said in a way which makes it into an insult, or it can be said in a way which carries no emotional baggage. In a scholarly context, the word pharisaical or anything related to it is an important one and is often the springboard in a discussion of comparative religion and history. When it is used as an insult, it is, um, insulting.</p>\n\n\n",

He therefor has to wait 7 days before he becomes a Tvul Yom (and permitted to make the Para Aduma) and until that night to be fully Tahor.</p>\n\n<p>(This is actually a Rabbinic decree, so that the Ger doesn't say in future years \"my first year as a Jew I touched a grave in the morning and that night ate Korban Pessach, so why should this year be different\".)</p>\n\n<p>Since we usually Pasken like Bet Hillel, so the answer to your questions would be:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a ger (convert) is considered like a newborn are they tahor?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, they are not Tahor, by Rabbinic decree.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If this is the case then if we were able to find a red cow then shouldn't the ger be able to to prepare the para aduma? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, since your first premise was incorrect.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Normally the problem associated with preparing the para aduma is the person who makes it must be tahor before doing so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not 100% correct.

Or you have to be born one? </p>\n\n<p>For example: If someone is not raised Jewish and then became much more religious, can he become a tzaddik?

Most who achieve that level are born with the ability to achieve it. Some can receive it later as a gift for all their efforts.</p>\n\n<p>Two additional points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Someone who serves G-d while having an evil inclination accomplishes something that a Tzaddik cannot.</li>\n<li>אפילו כל העולם כולו אומרים לך צדיק אתה היה בעיניך כרשע - Even if the whole world tells you have achieved that level of Tzaddik and have no Yeitzer HaRa, don't believe it about yourself, rather the Yeitzer HaRa is dormant, lacking opportunity for expression, not dead.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I second this comment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rebbe Nachman of Breslov taught that becoming a tzaddik depends on\none's efforts, not on one's birth. In Sichos HaRan, he said that\npeople have the misconception that he was only able to reach his\nexalted level because he was the great-grandson of the Ba'al Shem Tov,\nbut he said that this was incorrect, and anyone could reach the same\nlevel.</p>\n<p>Similarly, he said the following: \"Anyone who listens to me and\ncarries out everything I say will certainly become a great Tzaddik,\ncome what may.\" (Chayey Moharan #320).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I just want to add my thoughts on it. Chassidus on Tehillim 82:6 explains that we can all reach the level of Elokim. See Likutei Sichos, vol. 22, p. 278. We have amazing potential being made in the tzelem of Elokim.</p>\n<p>I think what people get confused the most in pilpulim is definitions. Tzaddik is more of a status than a person; the cheftza over the gavra.\nPlaying devils advocate rak rega, if we assume lich'orah that people are born as tzaddikim than this takes away bachirah. In this light, they would davka be less than malachim. Malachim still have a bissl bachirah, as one well remembers how Hashem had to rescue us on Pesach and not through an malach as even they would be corrupted. The Zohar is replete with stories of malachim going OTD. After the four went to Pardes, the malach Met. was given firery lashes. I think it's a different type of bachirah, more like how they choose to follow Hashem's commands or face incineration and rebirth from river Dinur, but it's still a type of free will. They even argued against Moshe getting the Torah while he was up in Shamayim.</p>\n<p>I cannot find any raaya saying that people are born tzaddikim, so I will address a few misconceptions.</p>\n<p>One could say that the Nasi Hador is born a tzaddik. However, this is not limited to just one person as Rabbi Aba Wagensburg writes about on <a href=\"https://shapellsjerusalem.com/purim-the-joy-of-adar/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Adar and Purim</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Tikuney Zohar (69,112) says that Moshe Rabbeinu’s sanctity spreads\nthroughout every generation. The Meor Einayim explains this to mean\nthat every single Jew has a spark of Moshe Rabbeinu in them, and\nthrough that spark we have the ability to understand the Torah. Thus\nMoshe Rabbeinu remains the eternal lawgiver to every generation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to explain that we all this level of Ish Elokim (vadai!). This is echoed by the Alter Rebbe who writes that we all have a chelek Elokah mamash. This also includes woman, like the Maiden of Ludmir. Everybody can do something to hasten or bring the world closer or check one more item off the list for Geula. לגאול?</p>\n<p>Besides the fact that the Shechinah is called Matronita, the mother of the Mashiach is mentioned in some obscure midrashim as vanquishing the forces of evil. First a prelude:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The rod which the L-rd will give to Chetzibah, the mother  of\nMenachem [ben] Amiel, is made of almond-wood; it is hidden in rakkat,\na city in (the territory of) Naftali. It is the same rod which the\nL-rd previosusly gave to Adam, Moshe, Aharon, Yehoshua, and David\nHaMelech. It is the same rod wich sprouted buds and flowered in the\nTent (of Meeting – Bamidbar 17:16-26) for the sake of Aharon.

When one of her sons  pointed this out to\nher, she asked her husband, the Tzemach  Tzeddek, perhaps she should\nstop saying Tehillim. The Rebbe  advised her to continue and then\ncalled his son and admonished  him, saying that it was her Tehillim\nthat had protected him at the  rabbinic gathering in Petersburg. The\ngovernment, enraged by  his views, had placed the Rebbe under house\narrest twenty two  times, and it was her Tehillim that had saved him\nfrom a more  serious punishment.

B'klal, the 36 constitue the pool of constituents wherefrom Hashem chooses the Moshaich of that generation. But even if we're disqualified from candidacy, that doesn't preclude us from attaining the level of tzaddikim.</p>\n<p>I also second the comment about Tanya, which is the world's first self-help book. Maybe people could misinterpret Tanya, so I'll start with Likutei Amarim, ch. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7931/jewish/Chapter-52.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">52</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכן נקרא אם הבנים, על דרך משל, וכנסת ישראל, שממקור זה נאצלו נשמות\nדאצילות, ונבראו נשמות דבריאה וכו׳</p>\n<p><strong>Therefore it is figuratively called “mother of the children”</strong> i.e., of\nJewish souls, and is also called <strong>“community of Israel,” for from this\nsource the souls of Atzilut have emanated,</strong> these being “emanations”\nand not “creations”, <strong>and the souls of Beriah have been created, and so\nforth,</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But there it explains that we all derive from the Shechinah which is even higher than the worlds of ABYA and b'frat in order to draw down this light we must make garments which themselves stem from an even higher source: Hashem's will and wisdom through His Torah.</p>\n<p>From this, we can understand ch. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7918/jewish/Chapter-39.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">39</a>, that the <em>abode</em> of tzaddikim is in the higher worlds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכן מעלת הצדיקים גדולה מהם, כי מדור נשמות הצדיקים הוא בעולם הבריאה,\nומדור המלאכים בעולם היצירה</p>\n<p><strong>Therefore, tzaddikim are on a higher level than them</strong> (the angels):<sup>1</sup>\n<strong>the abode of the souls of tzaddikim is in the World of Beriah\n(Creation), whereas the abode of the angels is in the World of\nYetzirah (Formation).</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But as explained passim, the kavanah and avodah of Jews as well as malachim is what determines their abode above.</p>\n<p>Working backwards further, the Alter Rebbe brings up this machlokes from the Talmudic passage that describes Job as saying to G‑d: “You have created tzaddikim (righteous men), and You have created resha‘im (wicked men).” In the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7880/jewish/Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">first</a> chapter of Tanya the Alter Rebbe asked: How can G‑d be said to have “created” righteous and wicked men? If man is wicked, it is his own doing. G‑d ordains only whether one shall be clever or foolish, strong or weak, and the like; he does not declare whether one will be righteous or wicked, for doing so would negate man’s freedom of choice. How, then, could Job say, “You have created men as tzaddikim and resha’im?”</p>\n<p>He resolves this stira so pashut in ch. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7893/jewish/Chapter-14.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">14</a> that any other shita is tiyuvta:</p>\n<p>The matter becomes clear, however, in light of the Alter Rebbe’s statement here that the ability to become a tzaddik is a gift from G‑d, not granted to every man. “You have created tzaddikim” thus means that G‑d created souls capable of attaining the rank of tzaddik. In the Alter Rebbe’s words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכן אמר איוב: בראת צדיקים כו׳</p>\n<p><strong>Therefore did Job say, “You created tzaddikim….”</strong></p>\n<p>We can now understand Job’s statement as a reference to those souls\ncreated with the capacity of attaining the rank of tzaddik. (The\nmeaning of “You have created resha‘im” is explained in ch. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7906/jewish/Chapter-27.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">27</a>.)</p>\n<p>וכדאיתא בתיקונים, שיש בנשמות ישראל כמה מיני מדרגות ובחינות</p>\n<p><strong>As stated in Tikkunei Zohar,<sup>2</sup> there are many grades and\ndegrees in Jewish souls:</strong></p>\n<p>חסידים, גבורים המתגברים על יצרם, מארי תורה, נביאים כו׳, צדיקים כו׳,\nעיין שם</p>\n<p><strong>Pious men (“chassidim”), strong men (“gibborim”) who gain mastery over\ntheir evil inclination, scholars of the Torah, prophets,...tzaddikim,\nand so forth.

Even if one\ndoes not have the opportunity to become a tzaddik, it is still\npossible for him — and therefore expected of him — not to be a rasha.</p>\n<p>The Alter Rebbe now goes on to state that everyone should strive to\nemulate the tzaddik’s service of G‑d, although he may never actually\nreach the rank of tzaddik. Specifically, one should train oneself to\nloathe worldly pleasures; and, conversely, he should try to awaken in\nhimself a delight in the love of G‑d, which is accomplished through\nreflecting deeply on His greatness. Thereby one fulfills the charge,\n“Be a tzaddik,” to the best of his ability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As is known to the initiated, the higher levels of ahava rabba and ahava betaanugim are gifts from Hashem and therefore not dependent on our histadlus howbeit we still have to ascend to the highest levels first. There has to be an \"awaking below\" (itaruta dilatata) to bring about an \"awakening above\" (itaruta dile'ela). I believe this is in line with the teachings of the mayin nukvin arousing the mayin duchrin.</p>\n<p>So far as I understand Tanya, IMHO, then, we are all standing on the precipice of beinoni like a seesaw or teeter totter.

As Earl said, lehavdil, the meaning to life is a moment and a choice. See Kohelet 12:13 (<em>q.v.</em>,the entire perek). There are 5 medraigos in our choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Tzadik Gomer or Vetov Lo</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Tzadik Vera Lo</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Beinoni</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rasha Vetov Lo</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rasha Gomer or Vetov Lo</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What separates the two righteous and the two wicked is in regard to the lower level of itkafya or the higher level of ithapcha of the yetzer hara (which as the Rebbe explains is still present even in a tzaddik). See Tanya, ch. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7889/jewish/Chapter-10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">10</a>. And as the Rebbe explains, based on Zohar Chadash, that David HaMelech slew his yetzer hara, per the Yerushalmi, through Talmud Torah.</p>\n<p>The way I see it is, l'moshel, if a cell phone goes off on Shabbos in a Frum shul Ch\"vS. A rasha Gomer would really lay into this guy R\"L and give him or her all sorts of tochacha and mussar. An incomplete rasha would stop and contemplate, but maybe the person on the phone is a doctor. An incomplete tzaddik would would hear the phone but not interrupt his davening. And a perfect tzadik wouldn't even hear the phone, (s)he would be too caught up with dveikus, yichudim, maaseh Merkavah, and hiskashrus and the like.</p>\n<p>That being said, it can now be understood why a baal teshuvah stands on a higher level than a tzaddik. It was said of Rabbi Eleazar ben Dordia that there was no harlot in the world he did not have relations with. He did teshuvah and died, which I don't think would satisfy Rabbeinu Yonah's twenty criteria for repentence but for arguments sake I'll poskim al pi Rambam. A shayla: how would his repentence assuage the scores of whores he victimized over the years? How would this put him on a higher level than a tzadik?</p>\n<p>I can give a whole drash on this, but b'kitzur the focus isn't on the person per se but their status thereof. D'heinu, that while a tzaddik still feels they're a tzaddik, they're actually undergoing a yeridah. It's this that makes humans on a higher level than malachim, because we are mehaleich as explained in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/5750/jewish/Hayom-Yom-Iyar-6-21st-day-of-the-omer.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyar 6</a> of HaYom Yom. Free choice is limited to moral decisions, which is based in the Torah, and so b'emet everything we do is either for or against Hashem. If one is not going up, they're going down. This actually ties in with the following point.</p>\n<p>The sof maaseh is that it is nurture over nature. It's fitting, then, that the second book of Tanya, Sha'ar HaYichud VehaEmunah, starts off with <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/3662420/jewish/Shaar-Hayichud-Introduction-Chinuch-Katan.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chinuch Katan</a>. Since I'm already turning this sicha into a maamar, I'll only focus on the sof davar. Basically, when a tzaddik/tzedekes falls seven times that is because his/her current rung is b'etzem a descent until he returns closer to Hashem; the ratzon and the shov. I want to emphasize one point, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אך לא כל אדם זוכה לזה</p>\n<p>Yet not everyone is privileged to attain this state of love which characterizes tzaddikim,</p>\n<p>כי לזה צריך זיכוך החומר במאד מאד, וגם תורה ומעשים טובים הרבה</p>\n<p>for it requires an intense refinement of one’s physical grossness, and\nin addition a great deal of Torah study and good deeds,</p>\n<p>לזכות לנשמה עליונה</p>\n<p>in order to merit a lofty [soul-level of] Neshamah...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's pretty clear, than tzaddikim are made and not from holy seed or whatever. While some have the shoresh of their neshamah in higher worlds, that only gives them higher potential and possibly makes it easier to attain new heights. That being said, Eisav comes from Tohu, an even more supreme higher level. Etz Chaim,  Heichal HaNikudim (Shaar 8, <em>ff.</em>). The higher the tree, the farther the apple falls.</p>\n<p>No one Jew is greater than another, rather it is their status quo that determines their posture in Gan Eden. As chassidus explains heavily on kapitl 51, our sins are always before us. See Tanya, ch. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7908/jewish/Chapter-29.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">29</a>; Likutei Sichos, vol. 4, pp. 1197-98. Each and every person has merits and sins. Rambam, Hilchot Teshuvah, perek <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911896/jewish/Teshuvah-Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3</a>. This expansive lashon would seemingly include even the chezkat mashiach for, e.g., not bringing the Jews back to Eretz Yisrael, not rebuilding the Temple, etc. B'poel, unless one gets a sex change, runs for kingship, and gets married into the kahuna somehow, there's no way one can (at least in maaseh) perform the Taryag mitzvot, not including the \"if you get tamei, here's the procedure\" types of mitzvos. Save for gilgulim, that is. The long and short of it is that nobody can look at themselves as being free of sins, however miniscule, which is a Yerida L'Tzorech Aliya, and, therefore, we all can become a tzadik Gomer even if just in the moment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> - The divine service of angels, the Rebbe points out, would seemingly have no place in Tanya, whose purpose is to serve as a guide to Beinonim — a guide to every Jew’s service of G‑d.</p>\n<p>The simple reason, explains the Rebbe, is to emphasize the lofty level of Torah and mitzvot that are motivated by intelligent love and fear of G‑d. So sublime is this form of service, that it transcends the service of angels.</p>\n<p>Moreover: Since this is a book written for Beinonim, the Alter Rebbe seeks to make it perfectly clear that it is “very nigh” — because it is innate — to every Jew to perform Torah and mitzvot with love and fear of G‑d experienced in the heart. An individual who attains this degree of natural love and fear of G‑d but lacks intellectual love and fear, should not be misled into thinking that his love and fear lacks intensity and consequently, his resultant actions are deficient as well. Rather, this degree of love and fear, too, is of remarkable intensity.</p>\n<p>The Alter Rebbe makes his point by emphasizing that both the angels and the creatures of the Divine Chariot serve G‑d out of natural love and fear of Him. We are thus able to understand how great this manner of service truly it. It is deficient only in that it is an emotional form of service rather than an intellectual one.</p>\n<p>However, with regard to service of G‑d being “very nigh in your heart,” natural love and fear fulfill this function admirably. Thus, every Jew is quite capable of revealing his latent love and fear of G‑d so that it emerge forcefully, for his love and fear is similar to the love and fear experienced by the angels and other celestial beings. This ensures that a Jew’s actions, which result from his feelings toward G‑d, be performed in a forceful manner as well, so that each and every Jew perform Torah and mitzvot with the inner life and vitality that stems from his love and fear of G‑d.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> - Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 1b.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> - This appears to be the Alter Rebbe’s intention in citing Tikkunei Zohar. However, the Rebbe remarks: “This bears examination.” Possibly, the Rebbe is implying doubt as to whether the Alter Rebbe understands the mention of tzaddikim in Tikkunei Zohar as referring to those souls born with the capacity to become tzaddikim, since the other qualities mentioned there — especially those that characterize the “gibborim, who prevail with might over their Yetzer Hara” — are not hereditary, but are attained by dint of one’s efforts. On the other hand, “gibborim” may refer to souls that are inherently inclined toward Gevurah, as are “chassidim” toward Chesed, and so on.</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> - Berachot 5a.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Rebbe Nachman of Breslov taught that becoming a tzaddik depends on one's efforts, not on one's birth. In Sichos HaRan, he said that people have the misconception that he was only able to reach his exalted level because he was the great-grandson of the Ba'al Shem Tov, but he said that this was incorrect, and anyone could reach the same level.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, he said the following: \"Anyone who listens to me and carries out everything I say will certainly become a great Tzaddik, come what may.\" (Chayey Moharan #320).</p>\n\n\n",

A three year period with one leap year is 37 months, which <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/23306/759\">will push forward the Molad</a> a mere 15 hours and 181 parts. Three of those will push it off 1 day 21 hours and 543 parts, or just 2697 parts (=2 hours 537 parts) shy of 2 days. That's possible in years 8-11-14-17 of the leap year cycle.</p>\n<p>There is a two day window for when the Molad must fall to have Rosh Hashana on Thursday since if it fell at a time appropriate for Wednesday it is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/108940/759\">pushed off</a>. If the Molad falls in the first 2697 parts of that window in year 8 of the leap year cycle then you have your observed phenomenon.</p>\n<p>We also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/64074/759\">know</a> that the calendar repeats approximately every 247 years with an error of 905 parts. Since 2697/905 is just less than 3, these events will always come in triplets with 247 year gaps between them. After 3 times though the error will move the start time out of our short 2697 part window. Thus these triplets will happen in (2697/(1080*24*7))/19/3=0.026% of years or about once every 4000 years.</p>\n<p>You observed this starting in the year 5765. As expected it is year 8 of the leap year cycle, and the other parts of your sequence are all 3 years apart. The Molad that year was Tuesday 1367 parts after noon, more than 905 parts after noon but less than 2*905 parts after noon, which means it must be the middle of a triplet set. By adding and subtracting 247, <strong>we find another time this happened began in 5518 and the next time will begin in 6012.</strong></p>\n<p>(The same exact argument applies to Rosh Hashana on Monday and Saturday, and indeed the last triplet for Monday began in 3865 and for Saturday began in 2763, with the next triplet for Monday and Saturday beginning about 4000 years later in 7722 and 6620 respectively. The next Thursday set will begin in 9375. If you allow non-leap years, the same argument holds true for years 7 and 9 in the leap year cycle, and, due to the \"gatrad\" rule, the sets come in more than triplets for Thursdays since our window grows from 2697 parts to 2697+9516=12213 parts; coming up in 5823 there will be four non-leap years starting on Thursday spaced 3 years apart, number 3 in a sequence of 14 such events spaced 247 years apart.)</p>\n\n\n",

The Mishna Berurah also writes (426:1) that a blind person must make kiddush levanah because he benefits from the moonlight via other people who can see and help him. In addition (M.B. 426:3) if there are clouds covering the moon, kiddush levanah can still be made as long as the moon's light shines through enough that it's useful as moonlight.

Yes, it has a way to <em>read</em> it in plain meaning, but its phrasing is awkwardly constructed and superfluous precisely because its primary purpose is not the plain meaning.</p>\n\n<p>Even at the simple level, it is understood that there are deeper levels to the Torah.

If you want a different approach in Pshat in these pesukim, you can look at the Rashbam. The Rashbam says that the purpose of the creation story is to justify what it says in the Ten Commandments - that Heaven and Earth were created in 7 days. What he says is that the existence of the earth preceded these 7 days by an indeterminate amount of time, but the purpose is to describe that aspect of creation about which it can be <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9881#v=11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">said</a> \"כִּי שֵׁשֶׁת יָמִים עָשָׂה יְהֹוָה אֶת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֶת הָאָרֶץ אֶת הַיָּם וְאֶת כָּל אֲשֶׁר בָּם וַיָּנַח בַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי\".

(Chabad have an online Halachic time calculator, with Plag and Sha'ah Zemanit for most locations, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/calendar/zmanim_cdo/jewish/Halachic-Times.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.) </p>\n\n<p>Source: Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 267:2</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּבִפְלַג הַמִּנְחָה יָכוֹל לְהַדְלִיק וּלְקַבֵּל שַׁבָּת בִּתְפִלַּת עַרְבִית </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, it has been suggested, that one could start the Kabbalat Shabbat Psalms a few minutes before Plag and get to the \"Shabbat Acceptance\" moment right at Plag. This \"Shabbat Acceptance\" moment is generally defined as the last stanza of Lecha Dodi.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Latest time for Kabbalat Shabbat:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong>\nKabbalat Shabbat has 2 meanings:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The original meaning: <strong>To accept upon oneself the sanctity of Shabbat</strong>. Even though Shabbat begins (and obligates you in all its Halachot)  automatically at sundown, <em>accepting Shabbat</em> actively is done for two reasons. (1) To accept Shabbat early and fulfill the Mitzvah of <em>Tosefet Shabbat</em> (adding on to Shabbat), and (2) to actively accept the Mitzvah of Shabbat, instead of it happening by itself, and get the reward for keeping Shabbat <em>on purpose</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Obviously, this Kabbalat Shabbat can be done at any point after Shabbat begins, to transform one's Shabbat observance from passive to active.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The newer meaning: The Ari z\"l in the 16 century (based on the Gemara in Shabbat 119a) instituted the <em>Kabbalat Shabbat Service</em> starting with certain Psalms and reaching a crescendo with Lecha Dodi followed by the Shabbat Psalms (92 and finally 93). Until then the entire  <em>Kabbalat Shabbat Service</em> consisted of Psalms 92 and 93.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The point was to <em>welcome the Shabbat Queen</em> with a royal ceremony. The ideal time to do this is when the queen is on her way in.</p>\n\n<p>Once that time has passed then the point of the ceremony is lost, but you still can say it, to transform your Shabbat observance from passive to active, since it's simply some Psalms and a poem.</p>\n\n<p>Though welcoming the Shabbat Queen - with the Lecha Dodi poem - long after she's arrived seems rather peculiar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To answer your question</strong>: I cannot find any Poskim who mention this, but I would propose that any time before the Friday night meal would still be somewhat appropriate to say Kaballat Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>Once you've <em>wined and dined</em> in honor of the Shabbat Queen, it seems silly to then start the Welcoming Ceremony. That said, the <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/halacha-lmaaseh/friday-mincha-maariv-kabbalat-shabbat/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OU site</a> write (without sources or explanations):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The latest time to finish saying Kabbalat Shabbat is before daybreak on Saturday morning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There is further discussion about ה being the letter of קבלה, of receiving, and the female is the recipient in the fundamental act of creation.</p>\n\n<p>I'm sure there is much, much more to talk about, but that is one example.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>First of all, I've upvoted YEZ's answer, as the idea of relating ה to femininity is not related to the letter itself, but to its grammatical function. </p>\n\n<p>There are several other examples of cases which I believe answer your question, though besides for YEZ's example, I can only think of one right away: the Maharal (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42853&st=&pgnum=362\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netzach Yisrael ch. 13</a>), in context of explaining why there's no pasuk in Psalm 145 (colloquially known as Ashrei) that begins with the letter נ is because it represents falling - not merely because it is the first letter in the word נפילה, but because of a grammatical rule, that the נ, if beginning a shoresh, is left out in certain verb forms (for example, almost all future tenses of the verb 'fall' don't include the נ of the shoresh - the נ itself 'falls away').</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I've long had similar questions. There's various explict theological points about grammar scattered throughout the Midrashim, but I've yet to find a work which compiles them into a complete framework.</p>\n<p>The closest text to what you're looking for that I know of is the <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em>,  specifically R. Aryeh Kaplan's translation and commentary. It's certainly not easy to grasp, but as the work is Abraham's treatise on how G-d created the universe using the Hebrew language, I suspect much grammar can be and is explained.</p>\n<p>Excerpt of Kaplan explaing the origin (or at least theological relation) of a few uses of letter prefixes and suffixes. The beginning gives the necessary context:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Kabbalists normatively associate the name Yah with Wisdom (Chakhmah). Actually, however, only the first letter of this name, the Yud, designates Wisdom. The second letter, Heh designates Understanding, the feminine principle. The reason why this name as a whole is used to designate Wisdom is because Wisdom cannot be grasped except when it is clothed in Understanding. For this reason, the Yud alone is not used as the name for Wisdom, but rather, the Yud combined with the Heh.</p>\n<p>There are a number of reasons why these two letters represent\nWisdom and Understanding respectively. Yud has the primary form of a simple point. This alludes to the fact that Wisdom is simple and undifferentiated. The numerical value of Yud is 10, indicating that all Ten Sefirot are included in the simple nature of Wisdom.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of a word, the letter Yud indicates the masculine future. This is related to the teaching, \"Who is wise? He who perceives the future.\"</p>\n<p>At the end of a word, when used as a suffix, the letter Yud means\n\"me\" or \"my.\" Wisdom is the essential nature of the individual\nbelonging to him alone. As such, it is the ultimate \"my.\" The same\nis true of the Sefirah of Wisdom (Chakhmah) with respect to the Infinite Being.</p>\n<p>Heh has a numerical value of 5, alluding to the five fingers of\nthe hand, As such, it represents Understanding, the hand that holds\nWisdon, distributing and channeling it.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of a word, the prefix Heh means \"the.\" It is the definite article, that specifies and delineates an object. Like a hand, the definite article holds and specifies a concept that is specific rather than general. At the end of a word, Heh indicates the feminine possessive, her.\" This is because Understanding is the domain of the Feminine Essence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He further explains (based on the midrash) that Lavan went back and searched Rachel's tent a second time because, \"she was one who touches everything.\"</p>\n\n<p>I'm having a hard time understanding the following</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If Yaakov's tent = Rachel's tent why isn't the pasuk consistent. Either call it Yaakov's tent both times or Rachel's tent both times.</li>\n<li>If Lavan went back to Rachel's tent after checking Leah's why doesn't the pasuk record things in that order, meaning why is the mention of checking the handmaid's tents inserted there?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>During the first time he went into \"Yaakov's tesnt\" because he was the main person that he suspected. When he went back, since he had already searched Yaakov's posessions completely, he had realized that he had not been thorough enough with Rachel's possessions. Apparently he first suspected Yaakov, then Leah as the \"first wife\". He then realized that Rachel could have been the one involved \"because she was the one who touches everything\". He then searched the handmaids' posessions because they could have been acting on orders. He did not search them first because he suspected their master or mistresses of having been involved. Since they were \"sacred\" objects he would not have suspected \"servants\" of daring to steal them.</p>\n\n<p>From memory. I do not remember the exact sources.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As I pointed out <a href=\"https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/33464/the-confusing-order-of-labans-tent-raids-in-genesis-3133\">here</a>, the Midrash that Rashi's comments are based on actually cites the verse slightly differently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויבא לבן באהל יעקב ובאהל רחל באהל יעקב שהוא אהלה של רחל</p>\n  \n  <p>And Lavan came in the tent of Yaakov and the tent of Rachel – In the\n  tent of Yaakov which is the tent of Rachel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is very possible that the Midrash added in the words ובאהל רחל to address your first question, or that the Midrashic author actually had those words in his text (though I have not found any other source that would corroborate that). Interestingly, the Pirchei Aharon argues precisely the opposite, that Rashi's explanation is necessary precisely because the verse did not say ובאהל רחל.</p>\n\n<p>As for your second question, Rashi does not address the order but several other rishonim do (see the above link again). Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Bechor Shor, Radak, and Ramban suggest that the Torah wrote it out of order for the stylistic purpose of not having the elaboration by Rachel interrupt the flow of the verse. Ibn Ezra alternatively suggests that Lavan went back to Leah's tent after going to the maidservants' tent and then went to Rachel's tent, so the verse is in order. Rabbeinu Bachya suggests that the maidservants' tent was inside of Leah's tent so that when Lavan exited the maidservants' tent he then had to still go out of Leah's tent in order to get to Rachel's tent. </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "At what point do we reject a minhag?",
    "content": "# At what point do we reject a minhag?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was learning the halachos of berachos on things that are ground up, and it seemed pretty clear to me that the blessing on chocolate should be ha'etz.  I found discussion in some more contemporary poskim who all seemed to take the same approach - \"Really, it seems like it should be ha'etz, but the minhag is to make a shehakol, so let's see if we can explain it.\"  That's fine with me - I have no problem coming up with an explanation to justify the minhag.  What I was bothered by was the conclusion of R' Shlomo Zalman Aurbach, who after trying several approaches to explain the minhag, does not find any satisfactory explanation for it being a shehakol.  He leaves it as a צע\"ג - needs major further investigation.  <em>But he doesn't conclude to reject the minhag</em>.  It seems that he still accepts that the proper blessing is shehakol.</p>\n\n<p>For myself, I am fine accepting the approaches offered in other responsa and making a shehakol.  What I don't understand is why R' Shlomo Zalman, for himself, did not reject the minhag.</p>\n\n<p>Chocolate was just a convenient example, so I hope readers do not get stuck on the example.  My question, succinctly put, is at what point, if ever, can an established, accepted minhag be rejected as mistaken?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In this specific instance, there is no harm from the minhag, since according to Rambam the blessing is still valid ( <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2508.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow\">הלכות ברכות פרק ח,י-יא</a> ):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בירך על פירות האילן, בורא פרי האדמה--יצא; ועל פירות הארץ, בורא פרי\n  העץ--לא יצא.  ועל הכול--אם בירך שהכול נהיה בדברו, יצא:  אפילו על הפת\n  ועל היין.</p>\n  \n  <p>If one intentionally blessed \"boreh pri ha'adama\" on fruit of the tree\n  -- the blessing is valid;  and \"boreh pri ha'etz\" on fruit of the ground -- the blessing is invalid.  And if he blessed \"she'hakol\n  ni'hi'ye b'divaro\" on anything the blessing is valid; even on bread\n  and wine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, if the bracha is still valid even if though it's \"wrong\" and there is a minhag to say it a certain way then there is no overriding reason to invalidate the minhag.  </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, there are some examples in MT of Rambam trying to cancel minhagim which he considers harmful or seriously mistaken.  <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5111.htm#14\" rel=\"nofollow\">One such minhag ( הלכות אסורי ביאה יא,יד )</a>, ( which is still existent to this day in some Moroccan communities ) is to wait forty days after the birth of a boy or eigthy days after the birth of a girl before resuming marital relations. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן זה שתמצא במקצת מקומות, ותמצא תשובות למקצת גאונים, שיולדת זכר לא\n  תשמש מיטתה עד סוף ארבעים, ויולדת נקבה אחר שמונים, ואף על פי שלא ראתה\n  דם אלא בתוך השבעה--<strong>אין זה מנהג, אלא טעות</strong> היא באותן התשובות.  ודרך\n  מינות באותן המקומות, ומן הצדוקיין למדו דבר זה; ומצוה לכופן כדי להוציא\n  מליבן, ולהחזירן לדברי חכמים--שתספור שבעת ימי נקיים בלבד, כמו שביארנו.</p>\n  \n  <p>And you will find in certain places, and you find some rulings from\n  some Geonim, that a woman who gives birth to a boy will not have\n  relations until forty days, and one who gives birth to a girl until\n  eighty days, even if she saw blood only in the first seven days --\n  this is not a valid custom, but a mistake in those rulings.  And it is\n  the way of heresy in those places, and they learned it from the\n  Sadducees; and it is a mitzvah to remove it from their hearts by\n  force, and return them to the way of our sages -- that they should\n  count seven clean days only, as we have expounded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So canceling a minhag would seem to be only in cases where the minhag causes potential harm.  </p>\n\n<p>There seems to be a related discussion in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=50b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pesachim 50b</a> where it talks about canceling a custom to take challah from rice bread. ( bottom of the page )</p>\n\n<p>I also read there is a discussion by Rav Ovadia Yosef in יביע אומר, חלק ב, יורה דעה, יא,ח on the obligation to cancel bad customs, but I don't have access to it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There was a Shiur on yutorah.org (that I cannot find right now because there are so many) that discussed minhagim.  It it the Rabbi quotes Rabbi Feinstein who said that a minhag with no basis in Halacha is an invalid minhag and therefore does not need to be followed.  The example given was not eating gebroks on Pesach, that that there is no basis in Halacha to not eat gebroks.</p>\n\n<p>There is another Shiur on the same website (<a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/752247/Rabbi_Aryeh_Lebowitz/Ten_Minute_Halacha_-_Minhagim#\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/752247/Rabbi_Aryeh_Lebowitz/Ten_Minute_Halacha_-_Minhagim#</a> ) that also discusses Minhagim, and also refers to when to not follow a Minhag, and gives the example that a minhag that should not be followed is to not sit in a Sukkah on Shemini Atzeret in Chutz Le'Aretz (i.e. we should all be sitting in a Sukkah on Shemini Atzeret outside of Eretz Yisrael.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It seems to depend on how wrong you (the halachic decider) think the minhag is. Case in point, Reb Moshe Feinstein would not reintroduce sheheim mishtachavim lihevel verik bavk into aleinu because so many previous generations had not said it so we don't have to be better than them. On the other hand, he led the crusade to\n pronounce guphen and gushem due to the fact that he said the old pronunciation was against the gemara.</p>\n\n<p>It seems very consistent throughout the tshuvos and psakim of the geonim and rishonim that they were constantly faced with the question of 'this is what we do. Is it right or wrong?' They then decided if the case against keeping the minhag was strong enough to abolish the old minhag or not. Most famous is Tosafos in the beginning of Maseches Brachos  concerning Maariv during the day time. Everyone did it. Can we find how to uphold the minhag within the confines of Halacha? Yes? Then it's not so bad. An example the other way is when some rishonim decided to change the order of the parshios in their tephillin. They thought the proofs against the old way outweighed whatever benifit there would be to keep it (obviously I find it an offence to my logic when I hear silly things like 'There always were two types of tephillin'). Another tephillin case was when Rav Sherirah was asked to explain why nobody wears tephillin. His answer was everybody he knows in Sura and Pumpadisa wears them so of course one must wear them. Again, a supposed 'custom', which was weighed against the law, and lost.</p>\n\n<p>The examples are countless but it all seems to stem from practice which may or may not be based on ignorance. Your case of chocolate is a case of ignorance based on never having had it limaaseh, in actual psak. And even though there is halacha, meaning similar cases which can be compared and are almost identical, but, it was never addressed and therefore the case for change is not as strong as a case of halacha limaaseh, by default it is only logic coming from halacha vilo limaaseh, weighed against a standing minhag. Same would be with electricity, as we have no old standard to go back to and say this is the way it was and should be, we are left with a thought and a question opposing a standing minhag. Not such a strong case for change.</p>\n\n\n",

If someone slaughters a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/9251/5323\">טריפה</a><sup>1</sup> (an animal that has certain physical deformities, such that it would not live 12 months), the knife must be cleaned (via rinsing הדחה or rubbing קינוח) from the fats of the טריפה.  </p>\n\n<p>But, if one killed <strong>three טריפות in a row</strong>, without a good שחיטה or הדחה\\קינוח in the middle, then that knife needs נעיצה in hard ground to be <em>kashered</em> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35269&st=&pgnum=43\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">10:13</a>). הדחה\\קינוח do not help for this case.<br>\nIf there were three in a row <em>with</em> כשרות in between, then נעיצה is required as a לכתחילה (see above).<br>\nOne טריפה by itself does not require נעיצה, because the שמנונית איסור (fatty leftovers of forbidden food [= טריפה]) has not really gotten stuck to the knife from just one time (\"משום דלא אידבד איסורא בהאי סכין וכו,\" there <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35269&st=&pgnum=43\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">12</a>) -- that only happens on three.<br>\nThis case is the only case that נעיצה is needed, and, indeed, helps.

I don't know the exact origin, and this is not an exhaustive list, but it is mentioned by the Rambam (maachalot asurot <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Foods.6.20\" rel=\"nofollow\">6:20</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Foods.17.7\" rel=\"nofollow\">17:7</a>), and followed by the Shulchan aruch (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De%27ah.121.7\" rel=\"nofollow\">YD 121:7</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De%27ah.10.1\" rel=\"nofollow\">YD 10:1</a>, ), and the Rema (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De%27ah.89.4\" rel=\"nofollow\">YD 89:4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De%27ah.69.20\" rel=\"nofollow\">YD 69:20</a>) in certain circumstances. In other words, it's actually not totally a bubba-meisa, although in practice it is rare.</p>\n\n<p>My guess on why it's so uncommon today (and this paragraph is purely speculation so please treat it as such), is that in times when running water was harder to obtain neitzah was relied upon more because the ground was more convenient than a well. Nowadays with the invention of indoor plumbing and faucets, water is easier to obtain so people use boiling water in cases where either neitzah or boiling water is an option.</p>\n\n\n",

While the earlier time may work for some people, others might want to delay candle lighting somewhat later than the community's official time. Is this permitted?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch writes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=76\" rel=\"nofollow\">263:12</a>) that if one is a member of a community/congregation that accepts Shabbos early, he must accept Shabbos early along with them. This is true even if the person doesn't actually daven along with that congregation, and is determined by the time that the shul recite Mizmor Shir (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=69&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">M.B. 261:31</a>).

According to Dayan Posen (of KAJ in Washington Heights, NY) in Kitzur Hilchos Shabbos p. 6 (siman 1:12), in a case where there are multiple shuls in one community, a person is drawn after the shul that he would normally daven in. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I do not have a copy of Igros Moshe with me so this is from memory. However, I looked it every summer for several years.  Rav Moshe Feinstein paskens that bringing in Shabbos early is an individual decision. In fact, a wife can delay lighting candles until the actual zman even if her husband has gone to the \"early minyon\". He deals with the cases of the bungalow colonies or communities with multiple shuls or a city with only one shul. There are those communities who require that there be a shul <em>in that city</em> though not necessarily in the same neighborhood that davens kabolas shabbos \"late\". However, that is not the psak of Rav Moshe.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Moral Culpability in the Garden\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Did Adam and Eve have moral culpability in the Garden <em>before</em> they ate from the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil? It would seem that they were like small children in that sense, they were amoral--not because they did not care for morality, but because they had no concept of it.</p>\n\n<p>If Adam and Eve had no concept of morality, of right and wrong, how is it fair to punish them for their behavior? Prior to eating the apple, Adam could not have said: \"Eve, do not ask me to do that, it would be wrong.\" He had no idea it would be wrong to eat the apple.</p>\n\n<p>It seems pretty central to morality that the agent must be aware of what he/she is doing for moral blame to fall upon them. If they were morally blame-less for eating the apple, then why the painful punishments?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>This question really touches on what the purpose of the Tree of Knowledge was.  Why would G-d not want them to eat from a Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil?  Isn't that the most important knowledge to have?</p>\n\n<p>In Moreh Nevuchim 1:1 Rambam develops an approach to understanding this (in which he alludes to your question).  As I understand his answer, it is basically the following:</p>\n\n<p>Before eating from the Tree of Knowledge, Adam understood moral truths as just that - truths.  Just like 1 + 1 = 2 is immutable and is not subject to how you feel about it or any weighing of values, so to \"do not disobey G-d\" was not a question of right and wrong, it was a question of true and false.  \"Obey G-d\" was a truth.  It was objectively grasped by his intellect.  In the Rambam's example, it would be silly to apply \"good\" or \"bad\" to the statement \"the Earth is flat.\" The intellect differentiates between those.  When they ate from the Tree, they chose to allow subjective passions to affect their decisions.  This lowered them from their lofty intellectual state of being into a state of being which involved moral decisions, as they had to battle their passions.  Their framework shifted from אמת ושקר, true and false, to טוב ורע, good and evil.</p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question, they knew much <em>more</em> than good and bad before they ate - they knew moral decisions as truths.  When they ate from the tree, their mode of knowledge shifted - now they knew <em>good and bad</em>, as opposed to <em>true and false</em>.  Thus, it is the Tree of Knowledge <strong><em>of Good and Evil</em></strong>, not simply the Tree of Knowledge - it brought a very specific type of knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Addendum:</p>\n\n<p>As to why they sinned, the Rambam addresses this between the lines:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכאשר חטא ונטה אחרי תאוותיו הדמיונות ותענוגות חושיו הגופניים כמו שאמר כי טוב העץ למאכל וכי תאוה הוא לעיניים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam describes what the sin was - it was going after his תאוות, choosing his desires over his intellect. Thus he brings the following of the sensual draw of the tree as textual support. Adam had such a thing as desire, and his charge was to not be נוטה (to \"lean\") towards it. Adam was aware of the concept of sensual pleasure, and he had desires.  His charge and his challenge was to ignore it, and to choose to remain \"שכלי\" - an intellect. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi David Fohrman goes into the concept of what they knew before and what they \"knew\" after in his series <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/b/eb/ge/48966101.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Serpents of Desire: Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden.</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Fohrman takes the approach of the Rambam as explained in the answer by @Yez and goes into detail about why it is needed, what it means, and what the implications for us would be. He also connects this tree with <em>the Tree of Life</em> and discusses the necessity of <strong>both</strong> trees and the reason for the expulsion from Eden.</p>\n\n<p>The entire series is too long to go into, but here are a few questions he deals with.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Imagine a world in which people were pretty much the same as they are\n  now -- they were smart, they could walk, they could talk, they could\n  drive cars and become investment bankers. They were missing only one\n  thing. They didn't know right from wrong.</p>\n  \n  <p>We have a word for people like that. We call them sociopaths.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is a very serious, fundamental problem. Didn't Adam and Eve\n  already have the knowledge the tree was supposed to give them? It's\n  the kind of question that you should lose sleep over. For as long as\n  you are stuck with this question, the story of Adam and Eve simply\n  fails to make any sense at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>A WORLD BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Perhaps we've been the victim of faulty premises. We've casually\n  assumed that we knew what kind of knowledge the Tree gave to Adam and\n  Eve: A knowledge of \"good and evil,\" of \"right and wrong.\" But on\n  second thought, just because it's called a \"Tree of Knowledge of Good\n  and Evil\" doesn't mean that Adam and Eve were ignorant of morality, of\n  right and wrong, beforehand. It just means that they didn't call\n  morality \"good and evil.\" They called it something else.</p>\n  \n  <p>The approach I am suggesting here is not my own. It in fact is the\n  approach taken by Maimonides, the Rambam. Indeed, in his Guide to the\n  Perplexed, Rambam considers the very same question we have advanced\n  here: Why would God want to withhold a knowledge of good and evil from\n  us? And the answer he gives is this: The tree didn't give us an\n  understanding of right and wrong when we had none before; rather it\n  transformed this understanding from one thing into another. It\n  transformed it into something called a \"knowledge of Good and Evil\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I think that the story of Adam and Eve is just a metaphor used to warn the men not to \"know.\"</p>\n\n<p>Think about the apple as the knowledge, the science or the consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>This means that the more you know the more you will suffer, and I think this is just a sad truth.\nJust think about the terrible things humans have discovered, like atomic bombs or radiation.\nBut God warned them not because knowledge is not useful but because men are not ready for that much, they would use it to harm and not to heal.</p>\n\n<p>The animals have no consciousness and they are not harmful like men....</p>\n\n\n",

There are meforshim who say that the wall that his leg was squeezed against was the rock that Lavan and Yaakov put up as \"Gal Aid\" to guarantee that members of either family would not cross to harm the other. According to this, he was of the same nationality as Lavan.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Sacks (former Chief Rabbi of Britain) derives the name Bil'am from \"Bli Am\" (without a nation) and says that as a \"Curser for Hire\" he had no nationality and no loyalty to anyone.</p>\n\n<p>In looking at the description of Pethor, Rashi says that \"land of his people\" actually refers to the original people of Balak and not Bil'am. He explains that Balak was originally a prince of Midian who had been asked to take over in Moav, because of the defeat of Moav by Sichon. In fact, Rashi says (from Medrash Tanchumah 4), that Bil'am had prophesied that Balak would become a king. Now that he was a king and needed help, he sent to his original land (where Bil'am was currently residing) for Bil'am to come to him. Since the Torah was referring to a location that was known to the people of that time, it did not need to be more precise. Note that \"by the river of the land of his people\" means that the river and the people were known and this was to say that it was this Pethor and not another of the same or similar name. For example, New York City is only city in the United States that does not have another city existing with the same name. That is why one needs to say \"Odessa, Texas\" or \"Baltimore on the Chesapeake Bay\". Here too, one has to say Pethor on the river of the land of his (Balak's) people.

However, on 106b the Gemara quotes Rav Chanina as stating that Bilam died in his 30s and Rashi points out that the two Amoraim disagree. </p>\n\n<p>The Sefer Hayashar (Parshas Shemos) implies that Bilam ben Be'or was from Africa and he was a fifteen year old servant of King Angias when he rose to prominence.

The Yalkut Shimoni (ibid) points out that all the prophets of the nations of the world were descendants of Abraham's brother Nachor & wife Milka (e.g. Iyov). There was a lot of potential spiritual greatness in the family, but it was channelled in very different ways.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to Seder haDorot, Year 2484, Bil'am was son of Be'or, who was a son of Yanus, who was a son of Bil'am - the advisor of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.

In that Teshuvah Rav Moshe wrote about how terrible abortion is and called it retzicha (murder) starting at 40 days (or 41 days), and certainly prohibited before, as well. Had there been any halachic basis for such an exception (such as exceptions made when the only way to save the mother's life is by doing so) he would have mentioned them.

As far as I know mitzvot don't need intention (kavvanah) at all.

This is presumably a list of examples of anything other than the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>Yibbum is a situation in which a very serious prohibition is overridden/suspended for the Mitzvah being performed. Because this situation is prohibited sans the mitzvah, Abba Shaul felt that one who is not focusing on the mitzvah is as if he is coming into contact with that prohibition. (According to Rashi's comments, it seems as if Abba Shaul held it was literally violating this prohibition - Rashi to Bechoros 13a s.v. עכשיו).  Therefore, his intentions make a difference in this case, as it becomes a \"mental\" אשת אח when he does not intend for the Mitzvah.</p>\n<p>R' Elchonon Wasserman in Kovetz Ha'aros 36 posits that when it comes to any  positive commandment overriding a negative commandment not just Yibbum e.g Shaatnez on tzitzis, metzora or nazir cutting the corners by shaving their heads, even the opinion that normally holds Mitzvos Ein Tzrichus kavana (do not need proper intention) will agree that in this situation it is required for the positive commandment to override the negative completely and for their to be no repercussions having done the Aveira at the same time as the Mitzva.</p>\n<p>If you follow this to its logical conclusion, this would mean that if someone went ahead and did Yibbum for the wrong reasons, the Yibbum would not take effect as a full Mitzva, as it is in violation at the same time of the prohibition of marrying a brother's wife, in which case marriage bears the iniquity of the Aveira even though it works,</p>\n<p>The Chazon Ish (Nashim 129:13) understands that Abba Shaul and the Chachomim both understood that on a Biblical level this Yibbum works, and that even the Chachomim agree that ideally you need to have the proper intentions for the Mitzvah.  Their argument was that the Chachomim understood this Mitzvah to be no different than any other Mitzvah, in which doing it \"shelo lishma\" is better than not doing it i.e the greater good of the mitzva supercedes any iniquity of the aveira even if he did it for the wrong intentions, whereas Abba Shaul held that in this particular Mitzvah you are violating the intent of the Torah, and from Heaven's perspective it is as if you have gotten involved with an illicit relationship, and it is therefore better to not do it even though a mitzva is being performed at the same time and the Marriage would fully take effect.</p>\n<p>The phrasing of the halacha seems to be a blanket rule, not dependent on individual basis.  In fact, when the Gemara in Yevamos suggests that the halacha reverted to be that Yibbum takes precedence, Rav Nachman exclaims in surprise \"Has the generation improved?\" and the response is that the consensus of who's opinion to follow has changed - the implication is that short of a change in the halachic conclusion, it is untenable that we would assume we have reached the point of doing Yibbum with the proper intentions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>In response to the third question:</p>\n\n<p>Per Yabia Omer 6, Even Hoezer 14 Rabbi Ovadia Yosef Zatzal says that Sefardim, Edus Hamizrach, and Yemenites that follow the Rambam and Beis Yosef who hold like the Chachomim that the Mitzva of Yibum takes priority over Chalitza even in today's generation, and even when it is not L'shaim Mitzva. Therefore he concludes that if one is doing it L'shaim Mitzva they should do Yibum and the Bais Din should encourage him to do so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Firstly, the Rabanan did not <em>uproot</em> a Mitzva. This is a <em>multiple choice</em> Mitzvah.</p>\n<p>In Yavamos 39b there's a dispute how to interpret the Psukim - as to whether Yibun with the wrong intention is valid.

Since even if one had the wrong intention, one is <em>happily married</em> to the widow.</p>\n<p>Those who hold it's invalid say one should prefer Halitza; just to be on the safe side, since an invalid Yibum would be a severe transgression of marrying one's brother's wife.</p>\n<p>The Rambam in Yibum 1:2 says to prefer Yibum.</p>\n<p>The Hagahot Maimonides brings Rabbeinu Tam - based on the Mishna you quote - that nowadays one prefers Chalitza.

    "content": "# May a Jew sell marijuana?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10609/is-one-allowed-to-smoke-marijuana\">It is held by Rav Moshe zt''l that a Jew may not smoke marijuana</a>, but <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/1mYuBWg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">following the legalization of marijuana in Washington</a>, I am curious if a Jew may run a store that sells marijuana in a jurisdiction that allows it (so dina d'malchuta isn't an issue)?</p>\n\n<p>In other words, may a Jew sell a product he is forbidden to consume, especially given the strength of the words Rav Moshe used to forbid marijuana consumption?  Does the risk that another Jew might buy the product pose a problem (stumbling block)?  Does it matter whether or not Noahides may consume marijuana? (May they?)</p>\n\n<p>(For the sake of argument, let's ignore the fact that US federal law still prohibits marijuana, but in real life, this would obviously mean there are still some dina d'malchuta issues in the US, though not in other countries like <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/06/world/americas/uruguay-marijuana-rules/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Uruguay</a>)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>It is patently SIMPLE & CLEAR that R' Moshe is referring to a substance similar to crack cocaine, which at the time of His letter marijuana may have been charactirized as by medical professionals and others. Arguably R' Moshe consulted with someone to determine what substance it was and what effects it has, and was arguably given the false \"official classification\" of the time, even in good faith.</p>\n\n<p>In light of the present correction of the generally accepted false claims of the time (extreme addiction, brain-cell killing, erosion of mental etc faculties), given that they have been shown to be false, this letter would be cast in doubt as unreliable given the misinformation, even provided in good faith, that it is based on.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, R' Moshe refers to Chashish & Marijuana..\nHad he been informed that the substance in question, the one and same, is Cannabis [Kanbois in Torah Shebaal Peh, or KNEI BOSEM in Torah Shebichsav {for Shemen Hamishchoh etc}] he arguably would have known IMMEDIATELY that it is certainly not a harbinger of such harm or destruction, and CERTAINLY would NEVER have called it \"tumhoh\"!!!</p>\n\n<p>In short this is SIMPLY & CLEARLY a case of mistaken identity, exacerbated by, albeit delivered to Him in good faith, misinformation, and clearly associated with the physical withering of crack addicts easily publicly observed at the time.</p>\n\n<p>In closing [citation needed]: Reb Moshe Himself wrote in a Responsum that His rulings are subject to new information and correction, as a rule, in any case where such information or correction is needed and correct. In short: His Responsa are Chochmoh not Ruach haKodesh.</p>\n\n<p>In light of all the above the cited letter of Reb Moshe would be classified as misinformed, erroneous and inapplicable by His own Allowance.</p>\n\n<p>On that note, while one may not be permitted to directly inhale smoke for health reasons, one may burn it in the form of incense, cook with it as a spice, and certainly sell it to adults as a spice, food or medicine.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, while there remains a federal law, and in some places also state law, against its use, raising the question of dina dimalchusa.. dd\"m applies to laws which are not regularly trampled by citizens, e.g. an expired meter even for several minutes and driving a couple mph over the speed limit in safe conditions both would definitely not be an issur of dd\"m (whether one gets penalized or not, regardless of arguments that the first may be theft and the second endangerment) because these legal limitations are regularly \"trampled\" by the masses dd\"m wouldn't apply. So too with the consumption of Cannabis which is argualy one of the, if not the, most trampled federal law(s), Dina Dimalchusa Dina would not apply.</p>\n\n<p>As with any substance (coffee/sugar included) if an individual finds it distracts him from Torah Study or Tephiloh he should limit or cease his use thereof, whether cannabis or otherwise, but this would not be the rule, but rather the exception.</p>\n\n<p>Tizku leMitzvos</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>The question can be expanded to the Jew selling animal products, of which he is forbidden to consume. This is definately permitted providing the recepient is not known to him to be Jewish or the kind of goods is not intended to be used in a forbidden way. Thus a pig-skin leather shoe may be traded between Jews. Similarly dogs can be kept by Jews (for reasons of security or pleasure), provided the dogs are not dead.</p>\n\n<p>So by extension the Jew can sell marjuahna to non Jews, and even to Jews, if and when the drug has been prescribed for medical purposes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>According to Rav Moshe the issues with Marijuana are as follows;\nAfter reading his Teshuva, along with the last line \" that is clear and evident that it is one of the strongest prohibitions\" It seems clear that it is not permissible to sell, if not for any other reason then to not put a stumbeling block. </p>\n\n<p>אגרות משה יורה דעת חלק ג' סימן ל\"ה.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The law of the land/dina Demalchuta Dina </li>\n<li>Honoring ones parents (who surely do not wish their children take drugs) </li>\n<li>Create taave/desire (munchies/and the desire for the escape/pleasure of the drug itself) and therefore is in the category of Ben Sore Omorer </li>\n<li>Hurt their health </li>\n<li>make it harder for them to learn torah due to a weakening of analaytical capabilities. </li>\n<li>It is an issue of transgressing Kedoshim Tihiyu </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>הנה בדבר אשר התחילו איזה בחורים מהישיבה לעשן חשיש (מריחואנה), פשוט שהוא דבר אסור מכמה עיקרי דינים שבתורה חדא שהוא מקלקל ומכלה את הגוף, ואף אם נמצאו אנשים בריאים שלא מזיק להם כל כך אבל מקלקל הוא את הדעת ואינם יכולים להבין דבר לאשורו שזה עוד יותר חמור שלבד שמונע עצמו מלמוד התורה כראוי הוא מניעה גם מתפלה וממצות התורה שעשיה בלא דעת הראוי הוא כלא קיימם. ועוד שהוא גורם תאוה גדולה אשר הוא יותר מתאות אכילה וכדומה הצריכים להאדם לחיותו ויש שלא יוכלו לצמצם ולהעביר תאותם, והוא איסור החמור שנאמר בבן סורר ומורה על תאוה היותר גדולה שיש לו לאכילה אף שהוא לאכילת כשרות, וכ\"ש שאסור להביא עצמו לתאוה גדולה עוד יותר ולדבר שליכא שום צורך להאדם בזה שהוא אסור, ואף שלמלקות נימא שאין עונשין מן הדין מ\"מ לאיסורא ודאי עובר על לאו זה ואיכא גם הטעם דאיכא בבן סורר ומורה שסופו שילסטם את הבריות כדאיתא בסנהדרין בפ' בן סורר (ס\"ח ע\"ב). ועוד שהאב והאם של אלו שמעשנין זה מצטערים מאד אשר עוברין על מצות כבוד אב ואם. ועוד איכא איסור העשה דקדושים תהיו כפירוש הרמב\"ן בחומש. וגם הם גורמים לאיסורים הרבה אחרים לבד זה, סוף דבר הוא פשוט וברור שהוא מאיסורים חמורים וצריך להשתדל בכל היכולת להעביר טומאה זו מכל בני ישראל.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5206.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודבר מפורש בתורה שאינו חייב אלא על דם בהמה חיה ועוף בלבד, בין טמאים בין טהורים</p>\n<p>It is explicitly in the Torah that the prohibition is on animal and bird blood only, whether Kosher or non-Kosher</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand he continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודם חגבים ודגים טמאים, אסור--משום שהוא תמצית גופן, כחלב בהמה טמאה</p>\n<p>The blood of locust and fish which aren't Kosher is forbidden - because it is part of their body, like fat of a non-Kosher animal</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the blood of non-kosher animals and birds would be forbidden based on the species prohibition, even without the blood prohibition. Is their blood actually a prohibition separate from their species prohibition?</p>\n<p>The answer for the Rambam is likely* yes, but I would be interested in the range of opinion in other Rishonim as well.</p>\n<p><sub>* Because I have seen more difficult readings of other Rambam's that would push the language further than reading otherwise into this particular one, but there would have to be an otherwise compelling reason to do so.</sub></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rambam’s source seems to be an explicit mishnah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Keritot.5.1?with=all&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kereitot 5:1</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דַּם שְׁחִיטָה בִּבְהֵמָה, בְּחַיָּה וּבְעוֹפוֹת, בֵּין טְמֵאִים וּבֵין טְהוֹרִים ... חַיָּבִים עָלָיו ... דַּם דָּגִים, דַּם חֲגָבִים ... אֵין חַיָּבִין עֲלֵיהֶן</p>\n  \n  <p>Blood obtained from slaughtering a domestic or wild animal or birds, <strong>whether impure or pure</strong> ... one is liable [a <em>chatat</em> if one eats it] ... Blood of fish or blood of locusts ... one is not liable [a <em>chatat</em> if one eats it].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, in contrast to fish and locusts, if one eats the blood of a non-kosher animal, one transgresses the specific prohibition against eating blood (irrespective of the <em>kashrut</em> status of the animal) which incurs <em>kareit</em> if committed intentionally, and a <em>chatat</em> if done unintentionally.</p>\n\n\n",

Modern science says that this is almost impossible based on how it was described in the torah.  No chemicals were added.  If they were then the were added out of thin air which also contradicts science.  So the question is, do people who think that water can be turned into blood also not think science is true?</p>\n\n<p>Edit:  After some discussion, I think it's agreed upon that the chances of every molecule of water in the Nile spontaneously turning to blood are very very low.  Most Jews accept this, but then assert that God ordered this to happen.  So then the question is what are the chances of the existence of a being (God) that could perform such a miracle?  So then I think to myself, there is a group of people (Jews) that will believe in God. They believe what is written in the Torah is true and they live their daily lives by it (meaning reciting daily prayers and following Jewish Law, etc..).  I think it's really cool that people do this and I completely respect that they carry on a tradition that is thousands of years old.  But I need to ask when these same people learn chemistry or physics in schools, what do they think of this knowledge?  Do they just disregard it?  Because when I learned these subjects, the teacher never stopped to say that these chemical laws can be broken if God intervenes.  For full disclosure, I went to a public school so I doubt this would have happened.  But from what I understand, some hasidic Jews (Satmar in particular) do not really teach secular subjects in their schools. I guess I have a sub-question then: why would a group of people not want to advance their knowledge of science.  I mean, it's very hard to question the Torah when you haven't learned science in school.</p>\n\n<p>I do not mean to be disrespectful in asking this question.  I am just curious.  </p>\n\n<p>Also, I am just using this one particular point as an example.  There are possibly dozens of other places in the Torah that contradict science.  I am curious about what orthodox Jews think of science. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>First of all, the whole point of the 'river turning to blood' was that it was supposed to be a <em><a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/miracles/#ConDef\" rel=\"nofollow\">miracle</a></em>, an event showing that superiority of a force over the natural world (i.e. science). So, if anything, your example proves that the Jews DO believe in modern science, as they believe that there's no natural way to turn water into blood without divine intervention. </p>\n\n<p>Ironically, it happens to be that in this particular example, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahmanides\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ramban</a> believed that the river turning to blood was a natural occurrence in the sense that it didn't require a violation of natural law (<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=2&perek=8&mefaresh=ramban\" rel=\"nofollow\">comments to Ex. 8:15</a>).

So modern science doesn't really contradict the miraculous (which are essentially then statistical anomalies).  </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, at a more fundamental level, \"modern science\" deals with <em>norms</em> which, by definition, miracles are not.

Why don't we say the same when it comes to washing one's hands for bread, where chatzitzah is also an issue?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The custom for women to trim their nails before going to the Mikva is recorded in Shulchan Arukh YD 198:18 but the reason given is related to avoiding dirt under the nail in the part of the nail which extends past the flesh. The Levush (ibid :18) there asks why this is not practiced by Netillat Yadayim. He gives two answers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Men are not so particular about their nails, so dirt under the nail would not be a problem for them. Since the enactment of Netillat Yadayim was (apparently) primarily for men, the women get the same rules.</p></li>\n<li><p>Women are not as careful about personal cleanliness during an average daily situation like eating bread as they are when going to a bathhouse to get all clean for the Mikva.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Taz (ibid sk 19) gives another reason, namely, that since Netillat Yadayim is only rabbinic, we rely on the opinion of Rabbenu Tam that only certain kinds of very sticky/thick dirt create problems and we don't need to worry about people not noticing this under their nails.</p>\n\n<p>The reason you stated for cutting nails is that of the Raavan as quoted in Shakh (ibid sk 25). However the Shakh ends up being lenient if the women did not fulfill this opinion of the Raavan and has already gone home from the Mikva and spent the night with her husband. It seems that certainly we can be lenient then in the case of the rabbinic Netillat Yadayim.</p>\n\n<p>You should see the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5399\">Beit Yosef YD 198:18</a> for more.</p>\n\n\n",

Has anyone determined if either of these locations line up with the streams of Arnon?</p>\n<p>Based on the Israelites' song about the well and Onkelos' translation thereof, it seems clear that the well was given in <em>the desert</em>, (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/u/u0421.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see verse 18</a>), and then it descended with them into the streams and then ascended with them up to the heights. It seems like 'there' in Onkelos on verse 16 should mean the desert then, but the context of verse 16 doesn't fit at all.

Nahmanides, however, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14084&st=&pgnum=278\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a> that verse 16 returns to the above topic of the travels. I believe this is Onkelos' approach as well, though he disagrees with Nahmanides about there being a place called \"בארה\", holding that this refers instead to the miraculous well.</p>\n<p>So verses 14 and 15 are interjections. They are parenthetical to the travels of Israel that we have been reading about through verse 13, in which we are told that,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מִשָּׁם, נָסָעוּ, וַיַּחֲנוּ מֵעֵבֶר אַרְנוֹן אֲשֶׁר בַּמִּדְבָּר, הַיֹּצֵא מִגְּבֻל הָאֱמֹרִי:  כִּי אַרְנוֹן גְּבוּל מוֹאָב, בֵּין מוֹאָב וּבֵין הָאֱמֹרִי.</p>\n<p><sup>From thence they journeyed, and pitched on the other side of the Arnon, <strong>which is in the wilderness</strong>, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites.--For Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see that they camped on the <em>wilderness side</em> of Arnon. Onkelos is thus saying that the well came to them from the wilderness, which is consistent with the general location of the well's origin as described in verse 18, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/u/u0421.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">per his translation</a>;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בֵּירָא דְּחַפְרוּהָא רַבְרְבַיָּא, כְּרוּהָא רֵישֵׁי עַמָּא, סָפְרַיָּא, בְּחֻטְרֵיהוֹן; וּמִמַּדְבְּרָא, אִתְיְהֵיבַת לְהוֹן.</p>\n<p><sup>The well that the princes dug, that the chiefs of the nation hollowed, the scribes with their staves; <strong>and from the wilderness, it was given to them.</strong></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>The placement of this passage about the well is indeed strange.

You are taking it that we know that Tefillin require a Guf Naki from Elisha Baal Kenafaim. The point, however is different. It is that the Guf Naki has to be to the degree that Elisha Baal Kenafaim had one, to the point where he merited the miracle. It is an emphasis on how careful you have to be with it, not the source of the concept.</p>\n\n\n",

He said that they watch a \"kosher movie\".</p>\n\n<p>OK, I know that the word \"kosher\" is used generically in English to mean \"OK to use\". But what makes a movie \"kosher\"? Is there a standard or certification for kosher movies? Who decides on movie kashrut, or is this up to each individual camp?</p>\n\n<p>The answer to the last question is important, as sometimes my kids invite friends who go to different camps, so I'd like to get movies that can accommodate the kashrut of his friends.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>What makes taking a field trip 'kosher'? The questions that need to be asked are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>What makes a movie ossur? I am not aware of any issur pertaining to the device or the concept, at least not in any mainstream halachic texts. Yes, I am aware that one <em>can</em> find a source for just about anything, but that doesn't make it binding or accepted (no, one's Rebba, or even a group of several Gedolim, does not count as the Sanhedrin of Klal Yiroel). And yes, one <em>can</em> find plenty of halachicly meaningless exaggeration, which while useful in a mussar context, has no bearing on halacha. (How often is something or someone described as apikorsus/apikorus, when the body of halacha pertaining to apikorsus clearly doesn't include it? The same goes for many lishonos such as 'ossur gomur toevah' etc, where the context and source of the statement must be taken into account.)</p>\n\n<p>In other words, is a video of Rav Elyashiv Zt\"l giving shiur 'ossur' or 'not kosher'?</p>\n\n<p>Rather, their <em>content</em> and <em>use</em> can at times (maybe most of the time) make watching them ossur. However, two things bear consideration. As far as issurim pertaining to how one uses one's time, there is nothing unique about movies; group it with playing ball, color-war, trips, or any other form of relaxation. As far as pritzus, I will not minimize the issue, but one <em>must</em> consider halacha in a non-selective manner. When it comes to pritzus, there is a fundamental concept in yidishkeit and halcha of 'Ein derech acher'. This is what allows one, when some standard of 'need' is met, to go shopping, drive through Manhattan, take a subway, or take a stroll in the park with one's wife and kids. Obviously, determining \"how much pritzus versus how much need\" requires a daas torah knowledgeable in one's culture (Israeli versus American for example), situation, background, and needs. And yes, it would seem clear that relaxation can count as an acceptable need. (Since many will be aghast at this statement, let me ask them: ever take the subway not for a dire business related need? ever visited the zoo, at least chol hamoed? the examples I can use are endless, and I would assume you participate in some of them with the consent of your rav). </p>\n\n<p>All this leads to a second question.</p></li>\n<li><p>What does it mean ossur and mutar? I am definitely not qualified to answer this, but at least I can broach the topic. There are clearly different levels. Explicit issurim, chumrahs, divrei chasidus, things that become ossur by way of takanas chazal, to name a few. So, maybe a certain movie (let us say the animated Disney snow white, to keep things simple) has no ossur pritzus, inuendo, etc (before I get attacked: unless one has abnormal issues, the kiss in there should not bring lidei keri balayla, especially for kids; if yes, please consider Disney's bambi instead). Given a situation where it is the proper use of ones time to relax, or do an activity with ones spouse, etc, it would appear to be mutar. However, that does not make it ideal, or necessarily right, if one uses common sense (the so called 'fifth chelek of Shulchan Oruch'). Maybe it will act like a gateway drug - one movie will lead to another, especially by one's children. Maybe it will have negative influences from outside culture - less than ideal if one has another form of relaxation available that meets one's needs. As far as I know, none of these are Issurim, but definitely will have to be justified when one reaches Shamayim after 120, so common sense and of course daas Torah are needed.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In other words, there is no good hashgacha, it would be too subjective to the individual halachicly. [Apologies: Anything sharp was not directed at the questioner, rather intended to preempt certain comments that are always made when this topic is broached.]</p>\n\n\n",

The Mishna Berura (168:82) explains that Rabbeinu Tam held that the status of Hamotzi is conferred at the point of its being dough, and it does not lose this status through cookings, as per the Baraisa on Berachos 37a that cooking bread does not remove it's Hamotzi status.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Shimshon, commenting to the Mishna in Challah (1:5) says that even if the cooked/fried dough has the appearance of bread it does not get Hamotzi but rather Mezonos, as Hamotzi is a result of specifically baking.  His opinion is cited by Rabbeinu Yona, and Beis Yosef brings many opinions who agree with him.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 168:13) cites both opinions, bringing the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam as a \"there are those who say.\"  The Rama says we are lenient, which is explained by the commentaries to mean we follow the first opinion and say mezonos.  The Shulchan Aruch concludes that someone with fear of Heaven should be stringent to only eat this type of bread when they have made Hamotzi on other bread (which has no doubt about it's Hamotzi-ness).</p>\n\n<p>The definition of \"תאר לחם\" - appearance of bread - is a gray area, but judging from the pictures that come up when following your link, it is no worse than kreplach, which the Rama explicitly identifies as having the appearance of bread.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that the Taz (168:19) holds that any dough fried in oil automatically becomes (at best) Pas Haba B'kisanin according to Rabbeinu Tam, as being cooked in oil is no better/worse than having oil kneaded into the dough, and therefore would be Mezonos unless one ate an amount that would make a meal.</p>\n\n<p>CYLOR, but I would conclude that this is included in this dispute and one should preferably make Hamotzi on other bread.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It seems that poori is deep-fried, in which case it is not bread (not even <em>pas haba b'kisnin</em>) and is always <em>mezonos</em>/<em>al hamichya</em> no matter how much is eaten.

Moses was spending a lot of time with God and since one had to be in a state of purity to talk to God, Moses was rarely intimate with his wife. Miriam refers to Moses' wife as a Cushite (Ethiopian) </p>\n\n<p>This is explained as either being idomatic or as being to a reference to an Ethiopian princess that was married to Moses when he was briefly the king of Ethiopia (this story is Midrashic)</p>\n\n<p>Rashi brings down several explanations.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9940#showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9940#showrashi=true</a> </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Moses married Zipporah, the daughter of Jethro<sup>1</sup>, who was a Midianite<sup>2</sup>.

The Cushites are the descendants of Cush, the son of Ham, the son of Noah<sup>5</sup>. </p>\n\n<p>From a <strong>strictly simple explanation of the text</strong>, it would seem Moses had two wives, one Zipporah who was a Midianite (not descended from Ham) and another unnamed wife who was a Cushite (and therefore descended from Ham).</p>\n\n<p><strong>I am ignoring various Rabbinic interpretations and explanations here because the OP specifically asked for Scriptural references.</strong>  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Exodus 2:21.</li>\n<li>Several places, first mentioned in Exodus 2:16.</li>\n<li>Genesis 25:1-2. </li>\n<li>Numbers 12:1.</li>\n<li>Several places, first mentioned in Genesis 10:6.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The following sources say that the wife of Moshe mentioned in Bemidbar 12:1 was an Ethiopian, and hence Hamitic (or, more precisely, Chamitic):</p>\n\n<p>(1) The Septuagint</p>\n\n<p>(2) Targum Pseudo-Yonathan</p>\n\n<p>(3) Josephus, <em>Antiquities of the Jews</em> 2:252-253</p>\n\n<p>(4) The Vulgate</p>\n\n<p>(5) Rashbam</p>\n\n<p>Aryeh Kaplan's Chumash translates the pasuk this way: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Miriam and Aaron began speaking against Moses because of <em>the dark-skinned woman</em> he had married. The woman that [Moses] had married was indeed <em>dark-skinned</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a footnote, he says: 'It is from here that the tradition is derived that after he escaped from Egypt, Moses was a ruler in Ethiopia, and married an Ethiopian princess (Rashbam; <em>Sefer HaYashar</em> [23:5-25]; <em>Divrey Yamim DeMoshe</em>; <em>Yalkut Shimoni</em> 168).'  Ibn Ezra and Chizkuni also give this as an alternative explanation.  See further on this, Louis Ginzberg, <em>Legends of the Bible</em> (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1956), pp. 299-302; Dewey M. Beegle, 'Moses,' <em>The Anchor Bible Dictionary</em>, Volume 4 (New York: Doubleday, 1992), p. 917.</p>\n\n<p>In spite of the fact that the Hebrew says the wife of Moses mentioned here was a Kushite/Cushite and is so understood by the Septuagint, Targum Pseudo-Yonathan, and Rashbam, he sides with Ibn Ezra (first explanation) and Radaq's <em>Sherashim</em> and says she was Tzipporah, the Midianite.  Chizquni and R. Bechaye also adopt this opinion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bibliography</strong>: <a href=\"https://thetorah.com/moses-and-the-kushite-woman-classic-i...\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Elad Filler, 'Moses and the Kushite Woman: Classic Interpretations and Philo's Allegory.'</a></p>\n\n\n",

It discusses various places where this is mentioned in the Gemarrah, and which halachot apply as well as practical applications.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, according to the article, Tircha D'Tzibbur is an extension of \"Ve'Ahavta L'Re'acha\" - loving your fellow. I.e. - if you are commanded to love one person, you are certainly commanded to love and respect an entire congregation of people (tzibbur) so you would not do anything to \"burden\" them.

I assume that it matters how obvious the stringency would be to others, as well as how much, halakhically, one would gain by adhering to a higher standard. For example, what if everyone in your community does something in a way that is b'dieved permissible, but no posek believes it to be lechatchilah? What if it is to offset a personal issue (such as standing during the haftorah, which nobody does, in order to prevent oneself from falling asleep)?</p>\n\n<p>Basically, does anyone know of a comprehensive discussion of the applicability of doing things that appear as yuhara? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The sefer <em>Chayei Moshe</em>, by R' Moshe Mendel Shklarsh, in his section on <em>Klalei Psak V'Halacha</em>, discusses <em>yuhara</em>. He writes that it only applies to be stringent in public on something that, <em>min hadin</em> (according to the basic law) is permitted. (At the end of the discussion he mentions that some say it can even apply to private practices.)</p>\n\n<p>There is a special concern with being stringent in the presence of one's rebbe who is not, as well as being stringent in a situation that implicitly denigrates the local rabbis.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect that if the communal practice is actually only permissible <em>b'dieved</em>, i.e. after the fact, then it would not be <em>yuhara</em> to be stringent. On the contrary, it is basic halacha. However, people often use <em>b'di'eved</em> to simply mean that it is not the \"best\" or ideal, in which case it may be a problem. In general, such a determination needs to be made by a competent rabbi on a case by case basis.</p>\n\n<p>As for offsetting a personal issue, in general this would not be an issue at all.</p>\n\n\n",

(preferably from scripture if possible)</p>\n\n<p>Best I can see, is Deuteronomy 30:19 (..choose life), but that just says regarding the blessings and curses. It does not say that the purpose of creation of this world is as an arena for man's free will.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>\"It does not say that the purpose of creation of this world is as an arena for man's free will.\" That is correct. However, that is not what you paraphrased from the lecture, i.e., the purpose of <em>nature</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Where does it say this? In the word itself! The word <em>teva</em> means coin, meaning the same thing in Hebrew as it does in English. A coin is something agreed upon and stable, both in monetary notes and metal, and in terms and natures. Hashem runs the world. When we see the same thing happening over and over again, however, it becomes plausible to ascribe happenings as having their own existence. This thought is only a few hundred years old, however. Before then, <em>nature</em> was attributed to some deity or force, either directly or indirectly. If a verse were required for the Jewish perspective, it would be Bereishis 1:1.</p>\n\n<p>There is another implied question in your post, however. That is, why did Hashem create the world? That question is not answerable, and is, according to Rambam Avodah Zora 2:5-6 from Bamidbar 15:39, forbidden to spend time thinking about. Hence, we cannot say if it was for free will or not. Indeed, it is unlikely, as Avos 4:21 compares this world as being secondary to the next world. It is the next world that is more likely to embody or contain the purpose of creation.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, we can still infer certain intentions contained <em>within</em> the creation. 1 Shmuel 15:22 has Shmuel HaNavi lecturing to Shaul that listening, rather than action, is what Hashem wants. Avos 5:1 explains that Hashem created the world with 10 sayings rather than 1 in order to payback the rasha and to give good reward to the righteous. Midrash Rabba 1 mentions Gan Eiden and Gehinom many times as being part of the creation.</p>\n\n<p>If this is what Hashem wants, affected how He created the world, and was part of the first days and declared good, we can infer that it is an important part of this world. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The first clear mention is <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8168#showrashi=true&v=7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereishis 4:7</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is it not so that if you improve, it will be forgiven you? If you do not improve, however, at the entrance, sin is lying, and to you is its longing, but you can rule over it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can rule over sin.</p>\n\n\n",

Is there any truth to any prohibition of riding on a boat during the 9 Days? If so, is there a difference in the prohibition if one goes on a cruise, a fishing trip, or a local ferry?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is not explicit, but I think it is a logical extrapolation.  R' Shternbach writes in Teshuvos V'Hanhagos 2:263</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולדעתי מותר להתרחץ\n  בים, אבל לא לשוט עמוק ער קרוב לקומת איש\n  שהימים האלו ר\"ל הם מסוגלים לסכנה ח\"ו... ובכל השנה\n  לא חיישינן לסכנה רחוקה , אבל בימים אלו ראוי\n  למנוע וכמבואר בש\"ע</p>\n  \n  <p>In my opinion, it is permitted to wash off in the sea, but not to wade deeper than the height of a person, because these days are days of danger.  The entire year we are not concerned    with far-off dangers, but in these days it is fit to refrain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R' Shternbach prohibits wading into the water deeper than one can stand, because of the potential danger.  Going on a small boat would, in my mind, be no less dangerous than going into water deeper than one could stand.</p>\n\n<p>Shalmei Mo'ed quoting R' Shlomo Zalman Aurbach:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומהאי טעמא לא היה ניחא לרבינו\n   כלל הנסיעה במטוס בט׳ הימים שמר״ח אב\n   עד תשעה באב, ואע״פ שבזמנינו נסיעות\n   אלו מעשים הם בכל יום, מ״מ הואיל\n   ומברכין על כך ברכת הגומל, אין לאדם\n   להכניס את עצמו לספק סכנה בימים אלו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R' Shlomo Zalman extends the prohibition of danger to air travel.  Even though his specific reasoning is because we say \"hagomel\" for air travel, he is comfortable extending the prohibition of dangerous activity to things which he acknowledges are normal, daily occurrences.  In Halichos Shlomo (2:14), R' Shlomo Zalman also prohibited swimming, so it is clear that his threshold was not those things on which we say \"hagomel.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The source for not doing dangerous things in the three weeks is in shulchan aruch orach chayim 551 siff 18. There are two specific things mentioned. Not to walk alone from the fourth hour untill the ninth hour because of 'ketev mriri', and not to hit the students. The mishna berurah adds from the elya rabba not to walk between the sunlight and shade. The piskei tshuvos bring from eshel avraham mibatchetch and aruch hashulchan that the danger of walking alone is only outside of the city in the desert where nobody goes. And he brings from kaf hachayim not to sit or sleep in direct sunlight. It seems the common denominator is that the danger is from heat related sources, not water. Also in biur halacha he says to be carefull from beginning of tamuz. Anything else that people don't do has no mekor apparently. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Moadei Yeshurun in the laws of the 3 weeks halacha 41 writes that one may ride on a boat but not on a canoe that is unstable. It's intresting to note that the reason of not going on a canoe according to Rav Moshe Feinstein (footnote 164 in Moadei Yeshurun) is not because of danger but because of rechitzah,since it's common to fall in water when canoeing. In addition, if the boat ride is for pleasure that would also be frowned upon during the nine days according to Rav Moshe as cited in halacha 40.</p>\n\n\n",

This includes the <a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01636_all.html#HtmpReportNum0010_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bamidbar Rabba 11:2</a> as well as <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/toshba/shir/2a-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shir Hashirim Rabba 2:9</a> (sometimes called Midrash Chazis), the early Tanhuma to Shemos 10, and Yalkut Shimoni to Kings I, ch. 8. The language in all of those midrashim is the כותל המערבי של בית המקדש, which indicates that the midrash is referring to the actual wall of the <em>Temple</em> itself, either that of the Heichal, Ulam, or Azaros (or maybe even the Cheil). </p>\n\n<p>However, the actual wall which is today known as the \"Western Wall\", or כותל המערבי, is none of these wall of the temple itself - it is the wall around the <em>Temple Mount</em>, the complex that was built by Herod to level off the top of the mountain (<a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%96%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%99_%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%A9#.D7.9E.D7.A1.D7.95.D7.A8.D7.95.D7.AA_.D7.94.D7.9E.D7.96.D7.94.D7.95.D7.AA_.D7.90.D7.AA_.D7.9B.D7.95.D7.AA.D7.9C.D7.99_.D7.94.D7.A8_.D7.94.D7.91.D7.99.D7.AA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia link</a>). While many in the past centuries have identified the Western Wall as belonging to the Temple itself, among them a scholar as great as the Radvaz (Responsa 2:648). <a href=\"http://www.din.org.il/files/newsletter/he_45.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article that I found online</a> discusses the opinions of various poskim regarding the status of the contemporary \"Western Wall\", but almost all contemporary poskim concede to the fact that it was never part of the Temple proper, and that all of the walls of the actual Beis Hamikdash were destroyed long ago. Therefore, the midrashim cited above probably refer to the Western Wall of the Temple <em>Mount</em>, and their description of those walls as belonging to the 'בית המקדש' is to be taken in a more general sense. This is indeed how the phrase is understood in the linked article, as well as by R. Zalman Koren, cited below. </p>\n\n<p>However, the Midrash <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51481&st=&pgnum=41\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eicha Rabba 1:31</a> gives details of a story, indicating that <em>only</em> the Western wall remains standing, while the other walls have been destroyed. This is problematic, because the walls of the Temple Mount are still relatively intact, and not just the western wall. R. Zalman Koren, probably the leading expert in the halakhic studies of the Temple Mount, has the following answer (<a href=\"https://www.thekotel.org/content.asp?id=119\" rel=\"nofollow\">from the Kotel's official website</a>): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בפועל, בצפון הר הבית, כמעט ואין למצוא כיום שרידים עתיקים. גם הכותל המזרחי העתיק נחרב כמעט לכל אורכו, וכמעט לא נשארו ממנו שרידים בחלקיו המרכזיים. באשר לשרידים שבקצוות, ניתן לקבוע כי הם היו מחוץ לתחום המקודש, ואולי משום כך לא דקדקו הדוכסים להרוס אותם לגמרי. באשר לכותל הדרומי, לכאורה גם הוא לא חרב, וקטע גדול ממנו קיים עד היום. אבל כותל זה שבימינו, ניצב מחוץ לתחום המקודש, בעוד אשר הכותל הדרומי הקדום, שהיה בקצה התחום המקודש של הר הבית, עמד צפונית לו. גם מן הכותל הדרומי המקורי לא שרד דבר שניתן לראותו בעין.</p>\n  \n  <p>In the north of the Temple Mount, almost no ancient remains can be found today. Even the ancient eastern wall was destroyed throughout almost its entire length, leaving hardly any trace of it in its main parts. As to that which remains of the edges, we can determine that they were out of the 'sanctified' area, and maybe that's why the officials [of Rome, who were supposed to destroy the Temple's walls] didn't bother to destroy them completely. Regarding the southern wall, it too seems not to have been destroyed, and a large section of it still exists today. But this wall stands outside the 'sanctified area', while that of the ancient Southern Wall was at the edge of the sanctified area of the Temple Mount, was north of it. From the original southern wall, nothing survived that can be seen with the eye.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, while other sections of the Temple Mount's walls have survived, these are either later parts of the wall or sections of the wall that did not have the holy status of the Temple Mount (see Keilim 1:8). (This small paragraph is a summary of much of R. Koren's life's work into the measurements of what and where should be considered sanctified on the Temple Mount - see his many books and articles on the topic). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is a medrash hagadol (i'll post the maareh makom soon, when i get back to my sforim) that says the stone (stones) from Yaakov avinu's mizbe'ach was used in the binyan beis hamikdosh and kept jumping out because he didn't want to get destroyed.

However\nIsrael count each day with reference to\nShabbat, ‘First day from Shabbat’, ‘Second\nday from Shabbat’ etc.. This is part of the\nMitzvah that we are commanded to remember Shabbat every day. This is\nthe simple meaning of the verse and is also the explanation of Ibn Ezra.</p>\n\n<p>It is unclear from this explanation if this is a halacha, per se, or if this is a statement of what Jews do by habit, or otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>However, see <a href=\"http://www.dinonline.org/2013/12/27/bo-months-and-dates-in-halacha/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article</a> which quotes the stringency of the Chassam Sofer, and claims that this was (is still?) the Hungarian custom. \nAccording to Chasam Sofer (Toras Moshe, Parashas Bo), there is an obligation to begin one’s letters with the number of the day of the week (counting from Sunday), and the number of the month (counting from Nissan): “This is an explicit rebuke [to those who do not use the Jewish calendar]: We should write in our letters and similar documents the first day of the week, first month of the year, and so on, to testify that Hashem created the world in six days, ‘and He rested on the seventh,’ and to remember the redemption from Egypt—and not Heaven forbid, the date of the nations.”</p>\n\n<p>I recommend reading the whole article as it also lists contemporary opinions. The ruling by Rav Ovadia Yosef permits using secular dates (he explains month names, not day names, though).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Although the names of the months and angels were brought up from Bavel, as is brought in the yerushalmi, rosh hashanah 1 2, and pointed to in tosafos rosh hashana 7a, the point i haven't seen mentioned but seems very important is that the olei gola returned to Eretz  Yisroel from Persia, the conquerors of Babylon. The Persians used a solar calendar and most definitely did not worship the same gods as the Babylonians, so at the time the anshei kinesses hagdola were using the Babylonian months, that is in megilas Esther and in Daniel, they were referring to worthless has been gods. In fact the name adar which comes from aduru was the name of the Assyrian chief deity and it is supposed thats why the leap month was attributed to him, a seeming inferior position. So we are dealing with a former god twice removed from his position of authority. And so even though Mordechai got his name from marduk and Esther got her name from ishtar, we can assume they no longer held religious prominence.  </p>\n\n<p>If we can use this as a klal gadol, than former has beens would be okay to use. It is also the svara Rabbi Belsky told me when I asked him why no one minds wearing Nike sneakers, nike being the god of victory in war.

In truth, as other answers mentioned, it is not such a problem because nobody worships those gods anymore. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, according to the Satmar Rebbe and Rabbi Menachem Kasher, the commandment to start counting the week from Shabbos only means that once a day a person should mention how many days have passed since Shabbos. Because we already do this in the liturgical introduction to the Shir Shel Yom, we need not follow that directive the rest of the day and can use other terms/names for the days of the week.</p>\n\n<p>SOURCE: \"<a href=\"https://scholar.google.co.il/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=2675963267133967479\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Uttering the Names of Idols</a>\" by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&text=Rabbi%20Reuven%20Chaim%20Klein&search-alias=books&field-author=Rabbi%20Reuven%20Chaim%20Klein&sort=relevancerank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reuven Cham Klein</a> printed in the \n<em>Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society</em> vol. 73, pgs. 5-21.</p>\n\n\n",

However, common practice where I live is to avoid asking or even halachic <em>remiza</em> to the non-Jew. Halacha classes and pamphlets by local rabbanim deal with the issue based on the premise that it is assur to ask.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the reason to forbid just asking?</p>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this question we will assume that the light in question is a CFL to avoid the side issue of incandescent bulbs.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>As was pointed out by @DoubleAA in the comments, the turning on of many types lights is  biblically prohibited on the sabbath. I will address in this answer those types of lights assumed by some to be only rabbinically prohibited. </p>\n\n<p>Even something which is only rabbinically prohibited is included in the prohibition of Amira LiNachri (asking a gentile). The only allowance to ask a gentile to do a rabbinically prohibited action is a case of need, (or great need, according to some authorities). </p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch 307:5 states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ה. דבר שאינו מלאכה ואינו אסור לעשותו בשבת אלא משום שבות מותר לישראל\n  לומר לאינו יהודי לעשותו בשבת והוא שיהיה שם מקצת חולי או יהיה צריך לדבר\n  צורך הרבה או מפני מצוה כיצד אומר ישראל לאינו יהודי בשבת לעלות באילן\n  להביא שופר לתקוע תקיעת מצוה או להביא מים דרך חצר שלא עירבו לרחוץ בו\n  המצטער ויש אוסרין. הגה: ולקמן סימן תקפ''ו פסק להתיר ועיין לעיל סימן\n  רע''ו דיש מקילין אפילו במלאכה דאורייתא ועיין שם סעיף ג':</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My loose translation:\nSomething which does not constitute [Biblical] \"work\" and is only prohibited on the sabbath by the rabbis one is allowed to ask a gentile to do on the sabbath, provided that there is some minor illness [which necessitates it] or if there is a great need, or for a mitzvah... And some prohibit [even in those cases]. The Rama says, and later...[The Mechaber] holds like those who permit. And see 276 that there are those who permit even a biblical prohibition. </p>\n\n<p>As you can see, it is clear that all agree that without at least some need, we do not permit one to ask a gentile to violate a rabbinic prohibition. </p>\n\n<p>As for hinting, there is a common misconception that one may hint to a gentile to do prohibitions on the sabbath. While there is some basis for this (see end of OC 307 and MB there 76), it is certainly prohibited where the Jew receives what halachically qualifies as benefit. What falls into this category is not clear, but lighting a dark room certainly does, see OC 276 at length. </p>\n\n<p>That is why people refrain from asking, or even hinting to Gentiles to turn on lights. The question is if there is any rational for permitting. </p>\n\n<p>(If there is already a source of light in the room there are many authorities who would permit one to hint to a gentile to turn in additional light. However, this is far from obvious). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The problem of Amira Lenochri is treated in Gemara <strong>Eruvin 67b-68a</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There was once a child whose warm water(needed for the brit milah) was spilled ...  'let a gentile be instructed to bring it for him {from the courtyard}' </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>--> We see that the question to instruct a gentile was discussed in a background of preparation for a Mitsva, brit mila, which override the Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>For healthcare of an ill person, even without life threatening situation, see Gemara <strong>Shabbat 129a</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[A women after delivery, from] thirty days, even if she says, 'I need it,' we may not desecrate the Sabbath for her, yet we may do so by means of a Gentile, as R' Ulla the son of R'Ilai, who said: All the requirements of an invalid may be done by means of a Gentile on the Sabbath, and as R'Hamnuna, who said: In a matter entailing no danger [to life], one bids a Gentile and he does it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the Mitsva to buy a land in Erets Israel, <strong>Gittin 8b</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R'Shesheth Says: It means that a contract for selling it [to a Jew] can be drawn up even on Sabbath.

So here, he tells a non-Jew to draw up the contract. \n  And although there is a Rabbinical prohibition against telling a non-Jew to do things on Sabbath [which we may not do ourselves], where it was a question of furthering the [Jewish] settlement of Eretz Israel the Rabbis did not apply the prohibition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But the Mishna in massechet <strong>Shabbat 121a</strong> prohibit it to save property and said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if a gentile comes to extinguish, we do not say to him, 'extinguish it' {Rashi commented that ordination to a gentile is prohibited rabbinically.}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here we see that to give instructions is prohibited but if he extinguish spontaneously, there is no problem, despite that he makes this for needs of the Jew. Shut Rivash enlight that the prohibited work is Mel'acha Sheeina tsricha legufa.</p>\n\n<p>So we see Brit Mila, buying Land in Erets Israel, caring an ill person, but not to salve material property.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>let's continue to read the Gemara in Eruvin.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After that he said to him, 'What objection was it that you wished to raise against the Master? ' 'It was taught', the other replied, 'that \"sprinkling\" on the Sabbath is only Rabbinically forbidden. Now, <strong>instructing a gentile to do work on the Sabbath is also Rabbinically forbidden</strong>. why then should it not be said: As \"sprinkling\" on the Sabbath which is a Rabbinical prohibition does not supersede the Sabbath so should not an instruction to a gentile to do work on the Sabbath which is also Rabbinically forbidden supersede the Sabbath?  - 'Do you', the first retorted: 'draw no distinction between a Rabbinical prohibition <strong>that involves (a manual cat) [an action]</strong> and one that involves no such act?'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Baal Halachot Gedolot and Rif discuss the meaning is \"Rabbinical prohibition that involves an action\". </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Rif translates this as Rabbinical prohibition that involves a Melacha Deorayita. So, to instruct him to make a Scriptural Prohibition is not allowed, but to ask him to make a Rabbinical Prohibition is allowed, the gemara talk about carrying a pan in a Chatser without Eruv Chatserot. </li>\n<li>Baal Halachot Gedolot translates this as Rabbinical prohibition tha is itself not an action. To speak is not an action, so Amira Lenochri is a weak rabbinic prohibition. For some need, it is allowed to ask him to make a Scriptural Prohibition as to boil water. (See Tosfot Gittin 8b, Paragraph 'אע\"ג')</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Rambam (Zemanim, Shabbat, 6, 9) ruled as the Rif:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A Jew is permitted to instruct a gentile to perform an activity that is not a [forbidden] labor and is prohibited from being performed on the Sabbath only as a sh'vut. [This leniency applies] provided that this is <strong>necessary because of a minor infirmity</strong>, a <strong>very pressing</strong> matter, or a <strong>mitzvah</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For a mitsva, as Tkiat Shofar, to go to take a Shofar which is in a tree, SA 307 cited 2 opinions and concluded to allowing in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2951\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siman 586, 21</a></p>\n\n<p>Further the Gemara Eruvin 68a, (according to the version of the Rif, but Rishonim said that Bahag has a different version of Talmud without this snippet), concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The teacher has not said to the gentile go to heat water. <em>{he said only to move the water in the courtyard. (ruled explicitly in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1530\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch OC 307, 5</a>) }</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>But the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1481\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Rama on SA OC 276, 2</strong></a> ruled as the Baal Halachot Gedolot (See the explanation of the Beur Hagra) for a great need, despite that he sees this opinion as minority. This is the source of a current lenient custom to ask a non-Jew <strong>to ignite candles for a meal of marriage, or Brit Milah</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>So, even if to turn on electric light is deRabanan,  we see no source to permit instructing non-Jew through Shvut Deshvut, following the Rif, we allow only for mitsva or ill, or great need. Following the <strong>Rama in siman 276, 2</strong>, who explained the Minhag to ask to ignite candles for Shabbat, marriage or Milah, may be that a rabbinic turn on electric light is allowed for a simple seudat Shabbat. Following the Rama, we cannot stopping someone who ask to the NJ to turn on electric light for a mitsva as light for Seudat Mitsva, even if turn on light is a scriptural prohibition. But the right behavior is to be stringent.</p>\n\n\n",

However, the trend of this process has continued in a dramatically positive direction. The number of Jews in Israel has exploded: When the Vilna Gaon was encouraging his students to move to Israel in the 1700s, there were a few thousand Jews already there; now there are millions.

Refer to <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/avot/1-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avot D'Rav Natan Ch. 1 Mishnah 4 </a> which describes the advice that Balak gave Bil'am.</p>\n\n<p>In brief, just before Bil'am leaves Balak, he advises Balak that the way to defeat B'nai Yisra'el is to provide tents with food and beautiful royal women. This way God will be angry with B'nai Yisra'el. Balak fulfilled that action.</p>\n\n<p>God requested that the war be against Midyan, because Bil'am who was from Midyan was the instigator - he gave Mo'av the advice. Chances are, that Balak would not have done any damage had Bil'am not advised him this way. (After all, he initially called Bil'am because in a sense, he was afraid that he couldn't defeat Israel by just attacking them, as he saw how they defeated Sichon and Og. He thought that Bil'am cursing would at the least weaken them enough so that he could eventually defeat them.)</p>\n\n<p>I should add that when you read the passage from Avot D'Rav Natan, it quotes from Bamidbar 31:15-16. When Moshe talks about \"these women\", it would appear that he means women from Midyan. In actuality, he is referring to woman from Mo'av who were held captive, as he uses the term \"THESE women\", implying that he knew exactly who those specific women were. (Translation from Rashi D.H. \"Hen Hena\" and also bracketed commentary in English translation Of \"Avos D'Rebbi Natan by Avraham Ya'akov Finkel.)</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud explains that Rav Huna, focuses on the Creation of the universe. From this perspective, first there were six days of the week and only then came Shabbos. The law is decided in accordance with the opinion of Rav Huna.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah wants to inculcate in us the point that Hashem is the Creator of the Universe and our counting 6-days and resting on the 7th parallels that process.  </p>\n\n<p>The verses in Bereishis 1:1-26 seem to indicate that the creation of the planets (on Day 4) are incidental to Creation as a whole.  I.e. the perspective is one of us on Earth and how G-d views the creation as focussed entirely on the Earth.  </p>\n\n<p>So, planetary living is like the desert - we count six earth-days as the basic unit of measure and Shabbos will be the 7th earth-day.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the book Contemporary Halachic Problems by Rabbi Dr. J. D. Bleich, he mentions the issues of mitzvos in the Polar Regions (Ch. 3), Vol. 5.</p>\n\n<p>He writes that the first contemporary to write about is R. Yaakov Emden (Shaarei Teshuva O. Ch. 344:1).  The issues are complex, and various opinions abound.\nAcc. to Emden, every traveller counts his own starting day from the last place he left as being normative. I.e. a traveller who left Anchorage on Tuesday and ended up so far North the sun never set would count from Anchorage 24 hour periods until he reached Shabbos and would celebrate Shabbos 4-days later, whereas a second traveller who left Helsinki on Wednesday would count 3-days later.</p>\n\n<p>The Tiferes Israel argues, and writes that the determination of Shabbos is objective, based on the revolutions the sun makes in the sky. (this is only relevant in the summer months).</p>\n\n<p>Bleich argues a different position where days are not defined by 24-hour periods.\nHe argues that earth transcends time and that there is no galactic status of time where time ceases to be practically relevant.  Then there are other considerations. But time-bound mitzvah become irrelevant in such a situation, according to this view. </p>\n\n\n",

Your Orthodox conversion would make your Jewish life easier, because they make up the largest group of religious Jews. Are you comfortable with accepting religious commandments from both rabbinic tradition AND the Torah? If not, take a look at Karaite Judaism, a minority of the Jewish minority.

The exiles that went to Turkey and other parts of the Mediterranean were heavily influenced by the students of the Arizal (a different stream of kabbalah than just pure Zohar of Moises de Leon). </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Modern Practice</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Rich well developed musical liturgy</p>\n\n<p>Today, S&P tend to have a well developed liturgy that is musically inclined and have tunes for specific prayers for specific times of the year. This is probably also the case among Western Ashkenazim and Iraqui Jews. However, today, for various reasons, authentic Western Ashkenaz and Iraqui is hard to find. So, S&P has emerged as one of the few remaining rich cantoral traditions among the Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Less kabbalistic</p>\n\n<p>The siddur is similar to edut ha-mizrakh but devoid of any kabbalistic prayers or kavanoth. </p>\n\n<p>Older text, simpler and shorter at some points, longer sometimes</p>\n\n<p>The text is also older, so for example, you will not find a second paragraph of Alenu, as you will among Ashkenazim and other Sephardim. </p>\n\n<p>Minhagim</p>\n\n<p>Some references to Spanish words in the service. Dignity and decorum very important in synagogue (no walking in between the Teba and the Heikhal while services are held - unless its part of the service!). Congregants dress mostly formally but not haredi, nor hasidic. No black hats, unless its a top hat (usually only for special occasions). Clean shaven or neat beards. They have no such custom to wear only black and white. Various waiting times between meat and milk (1, 3, and 6 hours depending on location or family origin). Different minhagim regarding tefillin tieing, light color talet and embroidery. They also have their own way of pronouncing hebrew traditionally. And various minhagim depending on the time of the year (haggim, fasts, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Hashkafa</p>\n\n<p>For various reasons, the role of the Rabbi and Dayan in the S&P community is limited compared to other traditions. This is because the ultimate authority rests on the Mahamad (the Council of Elders of the Congregation), who set the policy. However, the rabbis and dayanim have right of consent and advice - but can be replaced if they are unpopular. One of these restrictions, is that no Mahamad has authorized a rabbi or dayan to write an authoritative code regarding S&P practice, halakha or minhagim.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, the Congregations are comparable to what may be similar to \"modern orthodox.\" However, no official dogma or hashkafa exists - except a concern for being rooted in tradition and a tolerant and modern outlook on life. In this sense, it is truly Sephardi. It seems as long as people maintain the minhagim of the Synagogue service, their private outlook on Judaism or halakha is accepted, or at least tolerated.</p>\n\n<p>Sources</p>\n\n<p>All of the following sources are imperfect, because as I said before, no authoritative code was ever allowed to be published. But they are helpful as a rough guide to the S&P. The best source is joining an S&P community near you, or visiting one.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A Treasury of Sephardic Laws and Customs by Herbert C.

The Spanish-Portuguese are not \"original\" Sephardim.  Spanish-Portuguese Jews are descended from those who lived in Spain/Portugal until the 1600's, when they were able to travel abroad (to Amsterdam, for example) and were able to live as Jews.  Since they had little Jewish knowledge they studied with Levantine Jews who were descended from those who fled Spain and Portugal on or about 1492 and 1497, respectively.  Many differences in the Spanish-Portuguese prayers result from an avoidance of qabbalistic influences (especially in reaction to the travesties of the Shabbatai Sewi incident).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I think this book might be a useful resource: <em>A Treasury of Sephardic Laws and Customs</em> by Herbert C.

They say \"OK, it's retroactively permitted\".</p>\n\n<p>What happens if he didn't go to those judges, violates the oath, is about to get the punishment, then goes to three people and says \"I never would have taken the oath if I would have known that I was going to break it and get punished\".</p>\n\n<p>They say \"Mutar Lach\".</p>\n\n<p>Does he still get punished?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Not the same case, but we can regard it similarly.</p>\n<p>Nazir 23a</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ת\"ר (במדבר ל) אישה הפרם וה' יסלח לה באשה שהפר לה בעלה והיא לא ידעה הכתוב מדבר שהיא צריכה כפרה וסליחה</p>\n<p>Our Rabbis taught: [In the verse,] Her husband hath made them void,' and the Lord will forgive her, Scripture is speaking of a woman whose husband has declared her [vow] void without her knowledge. [intimating] that she requires atonement and forgiveness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no punishment by Bet Din, neither as a non cancelled nezirut, but the bad intention needs forgiveness.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>\"I never would have taken the oath if I would have known that I was going to break it and get punished\"</p>\n\n<p>I don't think that would be a very good reason to nullify an oath. That is like saying \"I never would have taken the oath if I knew I had to keep it\". Which is obviously a bad reason. Either because it shows he does not know what an oath is, or nothing <em>new</em> was added.</p>\n\n<p>The real question here is a simple one. The hatara of a chochom is l'mafrei'a. If a person transgresses an oath and subsequently nullifies it (retroactively) does he get punished?</p>\n\n<p>First, we must note, beis din does not punish for a broken neder (the Chinuch explains this is because it can be done without action). So, any punishment would be from Hashem. Since Hashem is the True Judge, we cannot say if there is punishment or not.</p>\n\n<p>It is worthwhile to note that the mefarshim dscuss the case where a husband is meifer his wife's neder without telling her. If she \"transgresses\" the now-nullfied neder, did she do anything wrong? Perhaps this is the same question.</p>\n\n\n",

I'll translate some of the more relevant portions:</p>\n<p>First of all, he strengthens the question by mentioning inscriptions discovered in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esarhaddon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esarchaddon</a>'s palace. Esarchaddon took tablets from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiglath-Pileser_III\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiglat-Pilesser III</a>'s palace to use for his own palace. Some of these tablets contained texts. These texts are now known as \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artifacts_in_biblical_archaeology#8th_century_BCE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the annals of Tiglath Pilesser</a>\". One of the texts reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Mat Iudai...Azariau...[from there on he translates it into Hebrew:...twice and on the second Azaria and also Azariau and what remained whole is this and on the road of my journey I received the tax of the kings...Azariyahu the Judean and also...Azariyahu of the land of Judea...and these rebelled under the hand of Azariyahu...\"<sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That last part continues on to describe Azaryah leading a coalition of 19 kings against Assyria and defeating them (this story, which seems to have been a major event in the Middle East, is not mentioned anywhere in Tanach).</p>\n<p>We therefore see that non-Jews also referred to Uzziah as Azaryah. So what's going on?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...and there are those that wanted to explain that Uzziah is a short-form of Azaryah that was used by the masses...and that is a mistake[n interpretation], because it was not the masses who called him so [Uzziah] but Yesha'ayhu the Navi himself, and also Zecharyah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zechariah.14.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">14:5</a>), and also among the prophets of the Kingdom of Yisrael we find Hoshea and Amos who call him Uzziah, we therefore have five witnesses against the Assyrian kings' texts...and the [bible] critics also missed the other names of Azaryah...we find the name Zecharyah which is how this king was called in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.26.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 2:26:5</a> when he would receive prophecies<sup>2</sup>. And they didn't understand that just as it is the custom of the Jews of Poland and Yemen today<sup>3</sup> to use double names, one a holy name by which he [the man] is called to the Torah, and one name secular...[and then he brings evidence from across Tanach that other people had double names. For example, one of Shmuel's ancestors is named Uzziah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.6.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DH 1:6:9</a> but called Azaryah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.6.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DH 1:6:21</a>; In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezra.2.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezra 2:2</a> there's S'rayah while in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Nehemiah.7.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nechemyah 7:7</a> there's Azaryah; Yehoshafat in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.21.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DH 2:21:2</a> had two sons with too-similar names, one named Azaryah and the other Azaryahu, therefore one must have had another name, and so forth]...and now we have found the reason that the Book of the Kings of Yisrael<sup>4</sup> would use the name Azaryah and so too in the Assyrian kings' letters, for they didn't have but this name only, because it was the secular name that was known also to the nations, and also the meaning of the name \"Uzziah\" is more holy and exalted than Azaryah, but the name Zecharyah is the name given to him in the beit midrash of prophets where he was filled with the spirit of counsel and valor to defeat the great enemy the king of Assyria...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The gist of what Rabbi Marcus wrote both here and later on, is that Azaryah was known by most people as Azaryah. It was his common/secular name, which is also how he was known by the Kingdom of Yisrael and by the Assyrians and other nations. However, he was known as Uzziah by the circle of prophets of his time, and it is based on their writings that he is called this in Divrei Hayamim, which is where his spiritual (and physical) rise and fall are described in detail (as mentioned above, not all of Azaryah's life is described in Tanach. Each book decided to write about different events for different theological reasons). Uzziah is a much more spiritual name (\"the strength of Hashem\" as opposed to \"the help/assistance of Hashem\") which better reflects his character and his story of attempting to get close to Hashem (and doing so improperly) and his subsequent fall from spiritual greatness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> As with practically every Tanach-related archeological discovery, there are those that are skeptical of this interpretation of the text. For more on the text and some of the earlier opinions on it, see <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/jstor-4617145/page/n1/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Rabbi Marcus identified the one-mention prophet in the verse \"He applied himself to the worship of God during the time of <strong>Zechariah, instructor in the visions of God</strong>...\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.26.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DH 2:26:5</a>) as being the prophetic name of Uzziah/Azaryah, or in other words, the king had <em>three</em> names.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> Late 19th century.</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> Earlier in the book he explains why he believes that Sefer Melachim was based mostly on the book mentioned in Tanach as Sefer Divrei Hayamim L'Malchei Yisrael (the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisrael) while Divrei Hayamim mostly based on Sefer Divrei Hayamim L'Malchei Yehudah (the Book of the Chronicles of the King of Judah).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25b26.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chronicles II 26</a>, Uzziah's delinquent service is opposed by the head priest <em>Azariah</em>, and 80 companions.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Uzziah is called Azariah to hint that he attempted to fulfill the role of this priest.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tsel.org/torah/tanhuma/noach.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Midrash Tanhuma Noah</a> 13 discusses Uzziah's blunder. It says that he forsook Torah for land, which led to his error. He overheard a discussion of the laws precluding non-priests from serving, and said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הקב\"ה מלך ואני מלך נאה למלך לשמש פני מלך ולהקטיר לפניו</p>\n<p><sup>God is a king and I am a king. It is fitting for a king to serve before a king and burn incense before him</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Figuratively, Uzziah means \"Might of God\". Azariah means \"aid of God\". A King certainly wields the might of God by subverting the people to the Torah and enforcing its laws. Priests perform a more subtle role, attending God as his aides in the Temple service.</p>\n<p>The Torah clearly distinguishes between the two, but by turning from Torah to the way of the land, Uzziah forgot this and over extended his jurisdiction. He thought of the Monarchy, <em>might</em> as encompassing <em>aid</em>. This is again hinted at by his naming in Kings.</p>\n\n\n",

It would seem that according to the Tiferes Yisroel (Kuntres Yevakesh Daas) the obligation is biblical. The Sefer Tevilas Keilim (page 225, footnote 113) cites the oral ruling of Rav Shmuel Wosner shlit”a, that all types of metals, including aluminum and the like, are required to be immersed m’doraysa (biblical law).</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Moshe Feinstein zt”l (Igros Moshe Y.D. 3:22) disagrees and he feels that there is no biblical obligation to immerse any metal which was not enumerated in the verse. He explains that G-d was obviously aware of all materials that were in use and that will be in use and if He did not list it in the posuk, clearly He felt that there is no biblical obligation to immerse them in a mikvah. That being said, there is a rabbinic obligation to immerse these utensils due to it’s similarities to the metals listed in the verse</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It was sifted thirteen times, the <em>mishna</em> says, and the <em>Bavli</em> clarifies:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a fine [sifter], in a coarse one, in a fine one, in a coarse one. Rabbi <em>Shim'on</em> (<em>ben El'azar</em>) says: There were thirteen sifters in the Temple, one above another, one above another. The top one collects bran; the bottom one collects <em>soles</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are several different explanations of this on the page of <em>Vilna shas</em> itself (besides whatever others may have done with it), and I'll focus on three:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The commentary attributed to <em>Rashi</em> (printed atop the page): <em>R. Shim'on</em> disagrees with the first statement (and I'll omit the explanation of the first statement). According to <em>R. Shim'on</em>, there are thirteen sifters. The coarsest one catches bran, and the second one sifts out too-fine flour. The resultant coarse flour is then sifted in eleven sifters that are even finer (progressively so) to make sure all the too-fine flour is gone.</li>\n<li>The manuscript-based <em>Rashi</em> (printed at the bottom of the page): <em>R. Shim'on</em> agrees with and clarifies the first statement. They hold that there are thirteen sifters. The finest one sifts out too-fine flour; then the coarsest one catches bran; then the second-finest sifts out too-fine flour; then the second-coarsest catches bran; then the third-finest… you get the picture. The middlemost sifter yields the good stuff.</li>\n<li><em>R. Peretz</em>'s version of <em>Rashi</em>, quoted within the manuscript version of <em>Rashi</em> in square brackets: <em>R. Shim'on</em> agrees with and clarifies the first statement. They hold that there are thirteen sifters, and the sifting is done as above (the finest, then the coarsest, then the second-finest, etc.). What the coarse ones catch is discarded as bran; but what the fine sifters emit is collected for use in the <em>mincha</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have three questions on the explanations of <em>R. Shim'on</em>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>According to the commentary attributed to <em>Rashi</em>, progressively finer sifters sift out more and more too-fine flour. That doesn't seem like it would work: surely if something didn't pass through a sifter, you'd use a coarser one to sift it out, not a finer one.</li>\n<li>According to the manuscript-based <em>Rashi</em> (not <em>R. Peretz</em>'s version), the middlemost sifter yields the correct flour. Is that what's caught by the middlemost sifter, or what it lets out?</li>\n<li>According to <em>R. Peretz</em>'s version of <em>Rashi</em>, several sifters (besides the last-used sifter) emit flour that was then used. Was it used for the <em>omer</em> or for other offerings?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

If there is no one else to daven for the amud, it is better that one is not fasting should be Shaliach Tzibbur that to miss out on Kaddish, Kedusha, and Barchu.\n<hr />\nIn 566:6, the Mechaber writes that one who is not fasting, even if he is the only Kohen in the shul, should not get called up for an aliyah. The Mishnah Berurah (Seif Katan 19) quotes the Magen Avraham who differentiates between Shacharis and Mincha. By Shacharis, the Kohen can receive the aliyah לכתחילה, whereas by Mincha, he should not get the aliyah. Some Achronim argue, but all agree that if called up (בדיעבד) the Kohen can receive the aliyah. \n<br/>The Mishnah Berurah (Seif Katan 21) writes that, לכתחילה, the Kohen should leave the room at that time so that people won't say when he doesn't get called up that he is not a proper Kohen. If there is another Kohen, he doesn't have to leave, but he should tell the Gabbai not to call him up.\n<br/>If the Kohen did get called up by Mincha, there is a machlokes amongst the Poskim if he should go up (because of כבוד הציבור) or not (because it may be a ברכה לבטלה). Therefore, the Kohen should ake sure not to be in the shul at that time.\n<br/>If he is a תלמיד חכם and, for whatever reason, he is not fasting, he can rely on those that are lenient to avoid a חילול השם.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A non-faster could probably daven Psukei D'Zimrah, or finish off with Ashrei, U'Va LeTzion, but I hardly think he could do Chazarat HaShas if he has to say Annenu and he himself is not fasting.

Putting that issue to one side, I don't understand why the Ma'amad would be fearful of the Notzrim.

    "content": "# curse words and the Torah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>American defines d*mn, <em>f-word</em> and <em>b-word</em> (excuse my language) as curse words. However, what does the <em>Torah</em> define as <em>curse words</em> or <em>dirty language</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Technically speaking, there is no concept in <em>halacha</em> of a word which simply cannot be used under any circumstances (with the partial exception of God's name). The furthest Jewish law in this regard is to encourage using a 'cleaner' way of expressing an idea if this is as efficient as the less 'clean' manner. The Talmud (<em>Pesachim</em> 3b) states, \"Whenever they are equal, use the clean language; whenever one uses more words, use the shorter language\". \"Clean\" in this context is a very broad idea; even simply referring to a pig or a lizard unnecessarily can be considered unclean.</p>\n\n<p>There is, however, another issue which is much more serious. This involves the prohibition of <em>nivul peh</em> - lascivious talk. Speaking about sexuality in an inappropriate manner is a very serious sin. The Talmud states (Shabbos 33a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For the sin of <em>nivul peh</em> many troubles and harsh decrees arise, the young men of (the enemies of) Israel die, orphans and widows cry out and are not answered, as [Isaiah 9:16] says, \"Therefore God has no happiness from his young men, and He has no mercy on his orphans and his widows, for they all flatter and do evil, and every mouth is full of obscenity; due to all this His anger is not turned away and His hand is still outstretched.\" What does \"His hand is still outstretched\" mean? Rabbi Chanan son of Rava said, \"Everyone knows why a bride enters the bridal canopy, but anyone who speaks obscenely (i.e. speaks out the reason), even if they (the Heavenly Court) had signed a decree of seventy years of goodness for him, it is turned to bad.\" Rabbi Chisda said, \"Anyone who speaks obscenely, they deepen Hell for him....\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the prohibition of <em>nivul peh</em> only applies when the subject matter is inappropriate. When appropriate (e.g. a doctor's visit) the prohibition of <em>nivul peh</em> does not apply.</p>\n\n<p>In practical terms, terms (like the \"f-word\") that are inherently lascivious, in that they specifically refer to sexual topics in a non-respectful way (and would therefore never be used in an appropriate context), are indeed completely forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>Terms of a scatological or similar nature would definitely fall into the category of \"not clean\" language and should therefore be avoided.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, there is a general imperative of <em>derech eretz</em> (civilized behavior) which would demand that we avoid using language that is seen as generally offensive and crude. This would include all of the terms we have already discussed, as well as words that are seen, somewhat arbitrarily, as \"curse words\" in English (such as \"hell\" or \"damn\").</p>\n\n\n",

Here's a copy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In regard to the \"Hefsek\" for women who have said Shehechiyanu, see Shmirat Shabbat Kehilchata Vol.II, Chap. 44:4, note 17.</p>\n<p>The Mishna B'rura (סימן רסג ס\"ק כג) actually suggests that women refrain from saying Shehechiyanu by candle lighting. This is based on the She'ilat Yaavetz who said there is no source for this practice, but he also says that women who do so should not be rebuked. After having said Shehechiyanu at candle lighting, they should therefore not answer Amen to the Shehechiyanu by Kiddush since it constitutes an interruption. (See Shmirat Shabbat Kehilchata Vol.II, Chap. 44:4).</p>\n<p>However, as known in many households saying Shehechiyanu at candle lighting has been the practice for many generations and it appears in many siddurim. Now the question arises do we tell them to stop the practice and do start telling women not to say amen after a \"bracha\".</p>\n<p>The She'ilat Yaavetz 107 said he did not stop his wife from saying Shehechiyanu at candle lighting.</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein zt\"l (אגרות משה או\"ח ח\"ד, קא ) says that the women answering \"amen\" after Shehechiyanu at Kiddush is not a \"hefsek\" for this has been the practice for hundreds of years and would it actually be a hefsek women should have been rebuked and told to discontinue. Furthermore, he says that telling people not to say amen can be detrimental. (See also שו\"ת רבבות אפרים ח\"א סי' קפב ) On the other hand, Rav Feinstein zt\"l also says where there is no such practice women should begin to do so.</p>\n<p>In Luach Eretz Yisrael of Rav Tokatchinsky zt\"l that women say Shehechiyanu at candle lighting. Although, he does quote the reservation of the above Ya'avetz in parenthesis, he did not forbid the practice.</p>\n<p>The Aruch Hashulchan 263:12 also says that the practice of our women is to Shehechiyanu at candle lighting and they are not to be rebuked since they usually light the candles right before Yom Tov and the Shehechiyanu is meant for the Yom tov and not the candle lighting.</p>\n<p>However, Rav Ovadia Yoseph Shlit\"a in Yechaveh Da'at 3:34 rules that women should discontinue the practice of Shehechiyanu at candle lighting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

They have fulfilled their obligation when they open their eyes and see the candles. Most women also have a custom of saying various tefillos by candle lighting. Unfortunately, most say those prayers right after the berachah without first looking at the candles. This should be a hafseik in the berachah. They should open their eyes and look at the candles. Then they may close their eyes and daven as long as they wish. Can you verify the halachic source for this?

However, he suggests a novel interpretation in the Rema - the Mitzvah is not the benefiting from the candle, but the lighting; the caveat to bless before looking is in order that it should still be considered עובר לעשייתן, although the blessing is on the prior kindling (see above link for further explanation). If we were to accept that explanation, once the blessing has been made, there would be no requirement to subsequently look at the candles - and therefore the prayers would not be a hefsek.</p>\n\n<p>R' Yochanan Shor asked R' Shloime Zalman Auerbach this question (if women are required to bless before benefiting, they should be forbidden from praying until after they have gazed at the candles), and he answered (Based on a <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1456\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 263.11</a>) that the praying is considered part of the Hadlaka process and therefore does not constitute a <em>hefsek</em>.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The source for this entire question is the Remo (based on the Mordechai and the Maharil) in Shulcahn Aruch Orach Chaim 263:5 who says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגה:  יֵשׁ מִי שֶׁאוֹמֵר שֶׁמְּבָרְכִין קֹדֶם הַהַדְלָקָה, וְיֵשׁ מִי שֶׁאוֹמֵר שֶׁמְּבָרֵךְ אַחַר הַהַדְלָקָה (מָרְדְּכַי סוֹף ב''מ), וּכְדֵי שֶׁיְּהֵא עוֹבֵר לַעֲשִׂיָּתוֹ לֹא יֵהָנֶה מִמֶּנָּה עַד לְאַחַר הַבְּרָכָה, וּמְשִׂימִין הַיָּד לִפְנֵי הַנֵּר אַחַר הַדְלָקָה וּמְבָרְכִין, <strong>וְאַחַר כָּךְ מְסַלְּקִין הַיָּד</strong> וְזֶה מִקְרֵי עוֹבֵר לָעֲשִׂיָהּ, וְכֵן הַמִּנְהָג (מַהֲרִי''ל). ‏ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similar wording on the Aruch Hashulchan.</p>\n\n<p>The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (75:4) mentions that she should make a point of looking at the candles, to complete the \"lighting post Bracha\" scenario.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּכְדֵי שֶׁתְּהֵא הַבְּרָכָה עוֹבֵר לַעֲשִׂיָּתָן, פּוֹרֶשֶׁת יָדֶיהָ כְּנֶגֶד פָּנֶיהָ שֶׁלֹּא תִרְאֶה הַנֵּרוֹת, וּמְבָרֶכֶת <strong>וּמְסִירָה אֶת הַיָּדַיִם וְרוֹאָה אֶת הַנֵּרוֹת</strong>, וַהֲוֵי כְּאִלּוּ בֵּרְכָה קֹדֶם הַהַדְלָקָה.‏ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It would seem that - as you propose - they should look at the candles ASAP after finishing the Bracha, however I don't see anybody discussing this explicitly.</p>\n\n<p>BTW: The Sefardim first make the bracha and then light.

Does this mean that a person can privately be drawn to a particular section, but not express it, or only express it in the form of a subjective opinion? </p>\n\n<p>By saying, 'sugya X is great', one is implying that sugya Y is less great, and that would seem to be prohibited. However, Chazal appear to have done that themselves, as they would refer to certain topics as 'great sugyos' (ex: Bava Kama 20a). Is that allowed?</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, whatever the law is by sugyos, does it apply equally to pesukim? Perhaps one cannot say that he likes a particular pasuk more, as it implies that one pasuk is more important than another (against what the Rambam writes in Foundation 8 of his famous 13)?</p>\n\n<p>I've seen this issue discussed, so I feel justified in asking for only sourced answers, please.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_4238_16.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sde Tzofim</a> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולכאורה יש להעיר מהך דעירובין(סד) א״ר אתא ב״ר\n   מאי דכתיב ורועה זונות יאבד הון, כל האומר\n   שמועה זו נאה ושמועה זו אינה נאה מאבד הונה של\n   תורה. ופרש״י, רועה זונות, נוטריקון זו נאה וארענה\n   ואעסוק בה כדי שתתקיים בידי. עכ״ל. ועיין ברש״ש שם.</p>\n  \n  <p>אמנם יש לומר כי הקפידה מצאה לנוח דוקא במקום\n   שאומר ג״כ זו אינה נאה. אבל זו נאה בלבד שפיר\n   דמי.</p>\n  \n  <p>וכן משמעות דברי המאירי בעירובין (שם) שכ׳, אסור\n   לאדם שיעשה עצמו מכריע בדברי תורה לומר זו\n   הגונה וזו אינה הגונה, שמתוך כך ישפיל בהכרעתו את\n   שאינן הגונות בעיניו. ושמא טעה בעיונו וגרם לשכח\n   הלכות גדולות. דרך צחות אמרו, רועה זונות יאבד הון\n   וכו׳. וענין המשל הוא שהנשים חינן חלוק לבני אדם, זו\n   נאה לזה וזו נאה לזה, וכן השמועות אין ראוי לדחותן אלא\n   להתיישב בטעמן, וכשיעיין בדבר ימצא הכל נאה ומתוקן.\n   עכ״ל.</p>\n  \n  <p>אולם המהרש״א בח״א שם כ׳, דמשמע דזו נאה נמי לא\n   יאמר, דבהכי איירי קרא דאייתי רועה זונות\n   אחרות שאינם נאות. ע״כ\n   וכן משמע מדברי הט״ז בדברי דוד (ר״פ קרח), שהקשה\n   עמ״ש בפרש״י שם פרשה זו יפה נדרשת במדרש\n   תנחומא. שהרי האומר שמועה זו נאה מאבד הונה של\n   תורה. וזו נאה לבד ג״כ אסור. וע״ש מ״ש ליישב בדרך\n   דרש. עיי״ש.</p>\n  \n  <p>ועיין בס׳ קיצור של״ה (דף נ״ג ע״ד), שכ׳ להזהיר את\n   המוכרים עליות ס״ת בבהכ״נ, שנוהגים לומר בפר׳\n   עשרת הדברות וכיו״ב, שפרשה זו נאה. וכתב, שציוה\n   הגאון מהר״ר שמואל אב״ד דפירדא שלא יכריזו כן,\n   דמשמע שפרשה אחרת ח״ו אינה נאה. עיי״ש. ולכאו׳ נר׳\n   דס״ל כד׳ מהרש״א הנ״ל. ועיין בס׳ שלחן הקריאה\n   (ילקוט דוד, די״א ע״א) מ״ש בזה.</p>\n  \n  <p>וע״ע בס׳ בן יהוידע (עירובין סד) שהקשה דהא אם\n   אומר שמועה זו נאה אדרבה הוא משבח השמועה\n   וכו׳. ותי׳, כי זה האומר זו נאה ודאי שלא על כל הלכה\n   ששומע אומר כן, אלא יזדמן שלא יאמר כן על כמה\n   הלכות. וכיון שיודעים שדרכו לומר שמועה זו נאה, ועל\n   שאר ההלכות אינו אומר כלום, נמצא שהוא מבזה לשאר\n   ההלכות. עיי״ש. ומבואר מזה דס״ל שאף שמועה זו נאה\n   בלבד אין לומר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He said that it's an argument.

Instead, the point seems to be that <em>even though</em> his death was the next major event, he <em>still</em> did it <em>happily</em> and <em>without delay</em>. His mindset is what we are focused on, not the timing.</p>\n\n<p>But, nu, would his life have been extended? Well, let's see. After the war, Moshe gave a speech. Actually, he gave a <em>very long</em> speech, some rebuke, and some b'rochos before the rest. He was also command by Hashem to ascend the mountain to have a good look, and only then, finally lay down. Being so much would happen first, it is hard to link the war with his death.</p>\n\n<p>But, nu, would his life have been extended? Well, <em>had</em> he tarried, and <em>assuming</em> that none of this tarrying would have affected the rest of what he and He did, it is reasonable to assume that his life would have been extended accordingly to allow everything to be done.</p>\n\n<p>What if Moshe had tarried indefinitely? This is highly theoretical. I get the impression that would have caused rebuke from Hashem, and had he still tarried, he would have been deposed so Yehoshua could take over.</p>\n\n<p>For comparison, see Shmos 4:24, where due to a bit of tarrying, Hashem sought to kill him. Though the variables are different here, tarrying does not seem to find good fortune.</p>\n\n\n",

He explained \"the Divine Presence is always over my head.\" <em>Kiddushin</em> 31a; <em>Shabbat</em> 118b.

KSA 3:6.</p>\n<p>During frightening times, when anti-Semitism is high, many people are encouraged to not wear a yarmulke in public because it identifies the wearer as a Jew and makes him a target.  As wearing a yarmulke is a custom and not a law written in the Torah or ordained by the rabbis, leniencies are possible.  But one who wears a yarmulke during his waking hours each day, knows that the yarmulke also puts a target on him from Above and among non-Jews, who will think poorly of Jews in general, if they see a kipah-wearing Jew act rudely, unkindly, or violate social norms and legal boundaries.  Would we go to the grocery store and buy pork wearing a yarmulke?  Even in emergencies, when I must use a public restaurant at a non-kosher restaurant, I will take off my <em>yarmulke</em> lest I be accused of being a hypocrite.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I think one should wear an unadorned yarmulke in order to be a \"poster child\" for pious Jews, rather than being a mere poster for big corporations.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can you put a mezuzah on someone else's home without permission?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Can you put a mezuzah up on someone else's home without permission? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Firstly, I'm not sure why you would want to do that.</p>\n<p>We learn the following in the Gemara (פסחים ד' ע\"א, בבא מציעא ק\"א ע\"ב, עבודה זרה כ\"א ע\"א) and it's codified by the Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2305n.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mezuza 5:11</a>): שֶׁהַמְּזוּזָה חוֹבַת הַדָּר הִיא — the obligation to affix a Mezuza falls on the occupants, and not on the building.</p>\n<p>In other words, the person living there has a Mitzva to affix the Mezuza. There's no obligation for the house to have a Mezuza. Instead, there's a Mitzva for the inhabitant to affix a Mezuza on their own house.</p>\n<p>So you may not be achieving anything, Mitzva-wise, by putting a Mezuzah up on someone else's home without permission.</p>\n<p>Secondly, there's a problem of damaging other people's property, which is forbidden. So, unless you can affix that Mezuza without damaging the doorpost (no holes, no glue, etc.) you'll be responsible for damages.</p>\n<p>By the way: One is also forbidden from causing damage with the intent of paying for the damage.</p>\n<p>In conclusion: You may do more harm than good, Mitzva-wise, by  putting a Mezuzah up on someone else's home without permission.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>I am not paskening anything here, please ask LOR for Halacha Lemaseh.</strong></p>\n<p>Just as @IsraeliReader commented above, I believe that one can put a mezuzah on someone else's door if someone wants. We can say this since we can apply the concept of זכין לאדם שלא בפניו- one may act in someone's favor in their absence. This comes up in a few places in Shas including Ketuvot 11a, Kidushin 23a, Bava Metzia 12a, and Chullin 83a.</p>\n<p>The Achronim discuss how זכין לאדם works:\nAccording to Rashi Gittin 9b, Ra'an Nedarim 36b ד״ה איבעיא, Tosfoat Pesachim 91b ד״ה איש, Rosh Kidushin 2:6, Shiurei Rebbi Shmuel Bava Metzia חלק א עמו קמג, and many more, זכין לאדם works based on shelichut, and the shelichut even works when the person is not aware of it. This is based on שלוחו של אדם כמותו which appears in Chagigah 10b, Nedarim 72b, Kidushin 42, etc. It's important that according to the (מהרחשת (חלק ב כז-א-ו even those who say that זכין לאדם does not work through shelichut they admit/agree that shelichut is involved to make it work but that זכין לאדם can also work without שליחות like by a Kattan.</p>\n<p>Therefore according to the many sources cited above, you would actually be  making the person without the mezuzah merit doing a mitzvah deoritah midin shelichut!</p>\n<p>There is another point we also need to address which is how we define זכין, does it follow what the individual person wants, or what everyone else wants? There are many cases discussed in the Rishonim and Achronim but perhaps there is one case (in my opinion) that mezuzah is similar to:</p>\n<p>The case is if a Jewish housekeeper takes challah from the dough of the home owner without permission- which is basically taking money out from the bal habyit. The Terumat hadeshen (188) says that we apply זכין לאדם, however, the Ketzot Hachoshen (243-8) explains in the opinion of the Rashba and Tosfoat (Nedarim 36b) that in this case, we don't apply זכין לאדם. However many Achornim understood that the Rashba does apply זכין לאדם here, including: Rav Shimon Shkop Kidushin 19, Brit Avraham Even Haezer 101-9, Imrei Bina Terumot 6, Chazon Ish Even Haezer 49, Oneg Yom Tov 107, and the Birkat Shmuel Kidushin 19.</p>\n<p>So perhaps this case is similar to mezuzah, since just as the housekeeper took off chalah which is taking out money (מוציא ממון) without permission for the purpose of a mitzvah and is also part of the mitzvah, so too by mezuzah the person placing the mezuzah also takes out money (maybe causes minor damage) without permission for the purpose of the mitzvah and is also part of the way the mitzvah is done.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Demai.7.1.7?lang=bi&with=Penei%20Moshe&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Demai 7:1</a> says a similar idea with the following story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rebbi and Rabbi Yossi were invited as guests to eat at the home of a certain man. However, the Rabbis suspected that he did not properly tithe the food being served, and they wanted to attempt to tithe the food secretly. Their suspicion was noticed by another man who told the owner to look at what the Rabbis are doing. Once the Rabbis realized that they were under scrutiny, they started throwing their food at one and other in a playful manner and by doing so they were secretly tithing the food.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also see the Ra'an Gittin 19b and the Sdei Chemed (חלק ב ד-כב עמוד 356) which talks about another case of זכין לאדם with a loss of money.</p>\n\n\n",

I found the following by <a href=\"http://www.ravaviner.com/2013/07/shut-sms-219.html\">Rav Aviner</a>. He was asked that whether the Kiddush cup of the Chafetz Chaim was like the measurement of Ha-Rav Chaim Naeh and not like that of the Chazon Ish.  </p>\n\n<p>His answer was </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is brought by Ha-Rav Moshe Karp as testified by the Chafetz\n  Chaim's grandson, Ha-Rav Hillel Zacks, the Rav of the Brachfeld\n  neighborhood in Kiryat Sefer, who inherited the Chafetz Chaim's\n  Kiddush cup.  Hilchot Chag Be-chag – Pesach, Chapter 19 note #11 (and\n  also brought in Meged Givot Olam Vol. 2, p. 34).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another <a href=\"http://asimplejew.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/halachic-measurements-chart.html\">reference to the same source</a> says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Rav Karp in a Hilchos Chag BeChag by Rav Karp in the volume on\n  Pesach, Chapt. 19 footnote 11 writes that the Chofetz Chaim's grandson\n  said that the cup holds 100 grams.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shmiras Shabbos Kehilchoso vol 2, 47 (9), gives the shiur as 1.5 eggs with the shell which is according to the minhag Yerushalayim  86 mls which he says is the custom of the Edos Hamizrach. He quotes the simple minhag outside of Israel as being 137 mls (based on the Kitzur Shuchan Oruch, Feldman and the Mishna Berurah O Ch 271 (13) MB [68]) and the shiur of the Chazon Ish as being 150 mls. </p>\n\n<p>So it seems that the  Chofetz Chaim's cup of 100 grams is less than the 137 mls ascribed to him (the MB does not give shiurim in mls.)

Thereupon they took him [the\n  host] into a shop [and gave him wine to drink]. Then they saw lentils\n  on his moustache. They went to his wife and gave her that as a sign,\n  and thus obtained their purses and took them back. Whereupon he went\n  and killed his wife. It is with regard to this that it was taught:\n  [Failure to observe the custom of] the first water caused one to eat\n  the meat of pig, [failure to use] the second water slew a person. At\n  the end they, too, paid close attention to people's names.

Is a human instinct or animal behavior?</li>\n<li>Is better that he passes gas then burps?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>For question #2, obviously, a person cannot choose between the two options, but we will contrast the two options</p>\n\n<p>Believe it or not, there are actually sources that somewhat relate to this question!</p>\n\n<p>The discussion is about burping or passing gas during Davening.  Aruch Hashulchan OC 97:2 says the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...אמנם החוש מעיד כרבינו הב\"י דבגיהוק יכול האדם לאנוס עצמו ולכן נ\"ל דלדינא ודאי כן הוא דצריך לאנס את עצמו שהרי אנו רואים כשיושבין במסיבה וצריך לגהק מאנס את עצמו לבלי לגהק מפני שאין זה מדרך ארץ והש\"ס והפוסקים שאמרו דלאונס מותר ודאי כן הוא דאם האונס גדול ומוכרח לגהק יניח ידו על פיו ויגהק ורבינו הב\"י לא הזכיר זה משום דע\"פ רוב יכולין לאנס את עצמו וכן יש להורות:... </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Key points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>He notes that it is not Derech Eretz to burp during a meal.  This may mean socially acceptable, or be a Torah-related reason, however, to burp during Davening is certainly considered unacceptable, as we see from this Halacha, where it is prohibited, and compared to yawning (and perhaps spitting).</p></li>\n<li><p>He seems to think that it is easier for people to hold themselves back from burping than from yawning, and that it is very uncommon for one to burp when he is trying to hold it in.  He Paskens that there is no need to move from your spot to burp, and if you cannot contain yourself, simply place your hand over your mouth.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Contrasting this to OC 103 (see SA, Aruch Hashulchan, etc. there), there seems to be an indication that it is more common for a person to be unable to stop themselves from passing gas.  However, passing gas (at least during Davening) is much more severe, and according to Shulchan Aruch, a person must move 4 Amos from his spot if he needs to pass gas, as this considered an \"embarrassment\" towards God.</p>\n\n<p>However, Aruch Hashulchan (103:4), based on Rema, allows such an individual (when Davening in Shul) to stay in his place, so as not to embarrass him in front of others.  We see from that source that it would be embarrassing for others to know that he had passed gas, and presumably, this would apply to passing gas after a meal, as the Halacha is discussing a case of Ones.</p>\n\n<p>In summary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Poskim assume that a status of \"Ones\" may apply to one who burps as well as one who passes gas during Davening (Kal vachomer to during a meal), thus classifying them as \"Human Instict which is sometimes unpreventable\".  The Aruch Hashulchan makes a comparison to the case of a meal.  </li>\n<li>Based on the Halachos and statements of the Poskim in these 2 places, passing gas was considered a more embarrassing act both around others, as well as in regards to Hashem.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Where is the <em>halachic</em> source for this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>First of all, the specific language of what you've heard, that \"as the berachah on the havdalah candle is made...\" is not necessarily correct; either the bracha should be before the checking, or the fingernail-checking should be done before the blessing, but not at the same time. (As to which one comes first: R. Moshe Feinstein, in Igros Moshe <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/14679\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.C. 5</a>:9 writes that the correct custom is to make the blessing first, and <em>only then</em> look at your fingernails, but the Mishna Berura says that it is more correct to do the opposite, to look, then bless). </p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah in Berachos <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=51b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">51b</a> writes the blessing of \"Bore Moerei Ha'esh\" should only be made if one benefits from the light of the candle. The Gemara later on daf <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=53b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">53b</a> writes that (according to the accepted opinion) this means that one has to get enough use out of the light as to differentiate between two coins: a sela and a pundyon (these two coins are actually very similar looking to each other). </p>\n\n<p>Since we don't usually have coins on us at the end of Shabbos, the Tur (O.C. 298) writes that instead one should use the light to differentiate between their fingers and fingernails. (The Gr\"a to Shulchan Aruch provides an earlier midrash as the source). Besides for this halakhic reason, the Tur gives other reasons as well: nails are a symbol for growth and proliferation, because the fingernails grow. (Many quote other mystical reasons as well).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are some interesting aggadic sources to specifically look at your nails:</p>\n\n<p>1) We are asking for the week to be fruitful and multiply- like nails, that continually grow (mentioned above).</p>\n\n<p>2) That the fire created after shabbos came out of the fingernails of Adam. (Kol Bo 41)</p>\n\n<p>3) In בפרקי דר״א פי״ד, it says that Adam's clothes were made of nail like materials. After the sin, his clothing fell away and he realized he was naked. This explains Hashem asking Adam \"who told you that you were naked ? did you eat from that tree ?\" Showing the connection.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm not married but live with the father of my son in a domestic partnership. My significant other is okay with me going to temple or even conversion if that's what I wish but doesn't want our son to be Jewish unless he makes that decision on his own.

In addition, I've taken some training (from CCAR/HUC) designed to prepare lay people to assist with common synagogue tasks (\"para-rabbinic\", of a sort), and this training included conversion assistance.  (Note: lay people do <em>not</em> make decisions in that area; that's the prerogative of rabbis.  But I've helped teach classes, for instance.)</p>\n<p>The CCAR (Central Conference of American Rabbis, the governing body of Reform rabbis in North America) does not require that <em>existing</em> children convert along with the parent, but does require discussion of the matter.  CCAR does require a commitment that <em>future</em> children will be raised Jewish.  Some rabbis amend the required pledge to say \"<em>exclusively</em> Jewish\", though that's not in the <a href=\"http://www.ccarnet.org/rabbis-communities/professional-resources/guidelines-for-rabbis-working-with-prospective-gerim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CCAR guidelines for rabbis</a>.  According to the rabbi who taught my class, \"exclusively\" is clearly the intent, and goes with the commitment to have a Jewish home.  (Note: it looks like the copy on that web site is missing embedded Hebrew.  I have a paper copy.)</p>\n<p>To quote from that document:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>f. discuss with the prospective <em>ger</em> the religious status of any current children and if there is a necessity for them to be included in the process of exploring <em>geirut</em>.</p>\n<p>When both parties are active participants in the process, issues of lack of partner's support, or outright opposition to can be discussed and solutions can be found far more effectively and far earlier in the process. [...]</p>\n<p>1f. If the prospective <em>ger</em> has children the following questions should be asked and discussed: What is their status? Are they Jewish according to Orthodox halakhic standards? Are they Jewish by Reform standards? Are they not Jewish at all? If not, is it appropriate for them to become involved in the process of <em>geirut</em>, and if so, when? Should they participate with their parents or should these issues wait until their parent(s) are clearer about their own intentions?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This leaves open the possibility that such children will not convert.  I don't see any age-based discussion here; that seems to be left to rabbinic discretion.  (I can imagine that a teen leaving for college soon might be treated differently than an infant in this regard.)</p>\n<p>The requirement about future children is in the boxed text in the section called \"readiness\".</p>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https://ccarnet.org/responsa/carr-81-83/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CCAR Responsa: Conversion of a Young Child of a First Marriage</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In summary, we urge that a complete conversion take place for the young individual if it is agreeable to both parents, and then insist that the youngster be provided with a Jewish education.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This responsum cites Shulhan Arukh Yoreh Deah 468.7 for a child being able to reject a conversion at the age of bar/bat mitzvah.</p>\n<p>As noted above, the CCAR is the North American rabbinic body, so it's possible that rabbis in other parts of the world follow different requirements.  In practice, though, I've never heard anybody mention another Reform rabbinic body; I suspect policies elsewhere won't vary on this point.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Participating in a non-Kosher food co-op\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_cooperative\">food cooperative</a> is a member-owned food store. It is typically set up that in order to shop there at discount prices, each person can become a member if they agree to volunteer a certain amount of time, and essentially they gain an ownership interest in the organization, much like a shareholder of a company.</p>\n\n<p>Since it is <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/kosher_articles/business_involving_non_kosher.php\">prohibited</a> to do business with (biblically prohibited) non-Kosher food, if the food cooperative also sells non-Kosher food (e.g. meat, seafood and the like), is there an issue for a Jew to participate?</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, the person could be said to be a minority share holder, not unlike owning some McDonald's stock. So they lack real controlling ownership of the company.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, a shareholder would not gain any privileges due to his or her ownership of stock. At most they get limited voting rights (depending on the corporate structure). In a food cooperative, they actually work in the co-op with ownership privileges and special access.</p>\n\n<p>Are there issues with being a member of a Food Cooperative in that context?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Even being a minority shareholder in a corporation does not necessarily imply that the laws of ownership do not apply. Some authorities (e.g. the <em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em>) do not even allow depositing money in a bank with minority Jewish ownership because of the concerns of <em>ribith</em> (usury). (Even those who are lenient in such a case [e.g. the <em>Shoel U'Meishiv</em>] would be strict if the entire partnership is Jewish.) According to the Maharam Schick and the <em>Shu\"t Maharshag</em>, the <em>ribith</em> law should depend whether or not the shareholders have <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitedliability.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">limited liability</a>. It seems plausible that this would be their view in the case of dealing in non-kosher as well since the leniency seems to be based on the halachik definition of ownership which should be relevant to both halachos (see <a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/ribis6.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/ribis6.html</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps more obviously and directly related are the discussions regarding the community partnership involved in defining a synagogue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Modern responsa dealing with the corporate status in the eyes of halacha (a topic with ramifications for other areas of Jewish life as well, especially Sabbath observance and ), frequently cite the insight of the renowned Talmudic exegetist Rav Yosef Rosen (Rogatchover Rav). He notes that a Tzibbur (corporate entity) has historically been treated differently than a syndicate of individuals, no matter how numerous. For example, S'micha (laying of hands on a sacrifice prior to slaughter) and T'murah (transference of the sacrificial status of one entity to another) apply only to individuals and not to corporations. However, the Minchas Yitzchak disputes this assertion and maintains that a bank may not collect or pay out interest without benefit of a Heter Iska. He reasons that if individuals retain their statutory rights in a corporate entity (e.g. one is permitted to sell or to bequeath a reserved place in a Shul), surely a Tzibbur never loses its own very personal identity. He notes that a Synagogue congregation conducts the search for Chometz and that it may not pay interest. Evidently corporations are considered as individuals in the eyes of halacha. Rav Pesach Tzvi Frank suggests that although state-owned bank may be exempt from Ribis problems, a privately owned bank is certainly not. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(ibid.)</p>\n\n<p>If memory serves (which it well may not), Rav Moshe Feinstein was lenient with regard to loaning money to a corporation because of its limited liability, but not (seemingly) with a Jewish corporation's loaning a private individual. I would think then that he does consider shareholders to be considered actual halachik <em>shutafim</em> (partners) with all the attendant halachos of full ownership, which would then presumably be the case here as well. </p>\n\n<p>Theoretically, one could argue that, even those who are lenient with regard to investing in corporations, presumably agree that a company owned by 3 <em>shutafim</em> does not have any leniency due to each individual's minority status, at least with regard to where they are sharing joint ownership of produce with the expectation that it could be divided up, as in the case of a food cooperative. The counterargument, I suppose, would be that (a la the <em>Shoel U'Meishiv</em>)  the original understanding of the cooperative relationship might be one of <em>breira</em> (retroactive ownership) such that everyone only ends up really ever owning (retroactively) what they ultimately walk off with, and therefore the observant Jew never owned the non-kosher to begin with. In fact, this reasoning is presumably much more easily applied to a food-cooperative than to corporate stock, which could mean even those who are strict in the latter case might be lenient in the former.</p>\n\n\n",

Was there some pattern or logic in deciding which masechtot get which type of ending.</p>\n\n<p>Note - Offhand, I think this differentiation applies only to masechtot that have a plural \"masculine\" ending. \"Menachot\" and \"Avot\" have feminine endings and are Hebrew endings. (I can't think of what the Aramaic female plural ending would be. If someone knows, please comment, and I will edit the question.)</p>\n\n<p>\"Sanhedrin\" is of Greek origin, and I'm not sure why that has an Aramaic ending, unless the entire word is Greek.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I agree with rosenjcb.  The other thing to note is that some words are just easier to say than others, so it would have been natural for the easier version to become the preferred version - personally, I find gittin is much easier to say than gittim.  I'm surprised more of the endings aren't Aramaicized, since -in is generally easier than -im.  </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the word Sanhedrin, the whole word is Greek, that's not an Aramaicized ending.</p>\n\n<p>And this is just a guess, but my assumption is that well-known terms from Torah would remain unchanged even if Aramaic translations would have been more natural to Aramaic speakers - bikkurim, avot, pe'ah, shkeylim, etc.  Words like kiddushin (esp in reference to marriage) and gittin (in plural form) aren't mentioned in Torah.  </p>\n\n\n",

(In other words we look at it like a kli sheini like the bottom-what spilled, not a kli rishon like the top-the pot)</p>\n\n<p>Although the Rema was talking about a hot spill and the asker was asking about cold things on the shelf, the law is the same: the pot absorbs a bit and is forbidden and the food is permitted. </p>\n\n<p>So why does the Rema talk about a hot spill?

But if he cannot [live] without a wife, he should first marry and then study. Rab Judah said in Samuel's name: The halachah is, [A man] first marries and then studies. R. Johanan said: [With] a millstone around the neck, shall one study Torah! Yet they do not differ: the one refers to ourselves [Babylonians]; the other to them [Palestinians].</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Hisda praised R. Hamnuna before R. Huna as a great man. Said he to him, ‘When he visits you, bring him to me. When he arrived, he saw that he wore no [head-]covering. ‘Why have you no head-dress?’ asked he. ‘Because I am not married,’ was the reply. Thereupon he [R. Huna] turned his face away from him. ‘See to it that you do not appear before me [again] before you are married,’ said he. R. Huna was thus in accordance with his views. For he said: He who is twenty years of age and is not married spends all his days in sin. ‘In sin’ — can you really think so? — But say, spends all his days in sinful thoughts. Raba said, and the School of R. Ishmael taught likewise: Until the age of twenty, the Holy One, blessed be He, sits and waits. When will he take a wife? As soon as one attains twenty and has not married, He exclaims, ‘Blasted be his bones!’</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Hisda said: The reason that I am superior to my colleagues is that I married at sixteen. And had I married at fourteen I would have said to Satan, An arrow in your eye. Raba said to R. Nathan b. Ammi: Whilst your hand is yet upon your son's neck, [marry him], viz., between sixteen and twenty-two. Others state, Between eighteen and twenty-four. This is disputed by Tannaim.</p>\n  \n  <p>Train up a youth in the way he should go: R. Judah and R. Nehemiah [differ thereon]. One maintains, [‘Youth’ means] between sixteen and twenty-two; the other affirms, Between eighteen and twenty-four. (Soncino Trans.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Talmud does not specify whether these ages define the mitzvah, or whether they are simply rabbinic guidance that may take many factors into consideration, financial, religious, etc. <code>1</code></p>\n\n<p>The lack of the normal derashot that accompany normal halachic discourse and the end of the passage's citation of the verse from Proverbs lend a degree of support to this conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam ostensibly <code>2</code> views the Talmud as describing the technical parameters of the mitzvah. He writes in Hilchot Ishut (15: 2):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האיש מצווה על פריה ורביה אבל לא האשה, ומאימתי האיש נתחייב במצוה זו מבן שבע עשרה, וכיון שעברו עשרים שנה ולא נשא אשה הרי זה עובר ומבטל מצות עשה, ואם היה עוסק בתורה וטרוד בה והיה מתירא מלישא אשה כדי שלא יטרח במזונות ויבטל מן התורה הרי זה מותר להתאחר, שהעוסק במצוה פטור מן המצוה וכל שכן בתלמוד תורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, HaNesher HaGadol Rabbenu Yitzchak Abarbanel praises those who like our Patriarch Yitzchak postpone marriage, in his commentary to Genesis (25):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>כי הנה עם היות שארז\"ל בן י\"ח לחופה לא אמרו זה אלא להודיע כי בהיותו בן י\"ח שנה כבר הוא בעל כח ראוי להוליד בנים אבל לא אמרו שאז יקח אדם אשה</strong>. כי הנה האשה כשיקחה אדם בבחרותו תטה את לבבו ותכניעהו יותר מדאי צא ולמד משמשון עם נשיו שהנה היו בעוכריו ומשלמה כי נשיו הטו את לבבו ולמה נבקש עוד והנה אבינו הראשון אמר האשה אשר נתת עמדי היא נתנה לי מן העץ ואוכל ולכן אמר ראש החכמי' בחכמתו (קהלת ז' כ\"ו) ומוצא אני מר ממות את האשה אשר היא מצודים וחרמי' לבה אסורים ידיה טוב לפני האלדים ימלט ממנה וחוטא ילכד בה ולהיות לקיחת אשה סכנה עצומה צריך סיוע אלדי והתישבות השכל ותבונה רבה להמלט ממוקשיה וכבר אר\"זל שלכן אמר הכתוב מי האיש אשר בנה בית ומי האיש אשר נטע כרם ומי האיש אשר ארש אשה לפי שראוי לאד' שראשונה יתעסק בקנין הבית ובנינו ואחר כך בנטיעת הכרם ובאחרונה בלקיחת האשה <strong>הנה מפני זה נתעכב יצחק מלקחת אשה עד ארבעים שנה כדי שיעבור תגבורת הבחרות ותכבה רתיחת דם הנערות ותאות המשגל ויהיה אז החומר היוצא להולדה יותר מוכן לקבל צורה שלימה וכבר אמרו חז\"ל שעשו עשה כזה לקחת אשה בן ארבעים שנה להראות עצמו כשר</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A similar view emerges from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_Moses_ben_Maimon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbenu Avraham ben HaRambam</a>'s <em>Hamaspik L'Ovdey Hashem</em>. He writes that observance of basic halacha trumps pietistic practices such as fasting. The former are supposed to supplement the latter; not the other way around. One of his examples of a pietistic practice is avoiding marriage (chapter one: page 17 of Wincelberg translation).</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Wincelberg explains that Rabbenu Avraham does not mean never marrying, but rather postponing marriage by many years; a practiced endorsed by his son Rabbenu Ovadyah (cited there).</p>\n\n<p>See also chapter 10, (page 369 of Wincelberg translation) where he praises significantly postponing marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly he holds that one need not marry by 24, and one may marry later.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_ben_Aderet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashba</a>  was asked about a person who swore not to marry until a certain age. Does this constitute an oath to violate a mitzvah? He answers (Responsa 4:91) that it does not, as he can simply marry later. (See there where he contrasts the mitzvah of marriage, with a time-bound mitzvah like circumcision):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תשובה: שבוע' היא חלה, שאין זה, נשבע לבטל את המצוה. דאפשר לקיים זה וזה. ולא זו בלבד, שאין זמנה בהול, אלא אפילו במצוה שזמנה בהול, כמילה וכו...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They seem to have either held that the Gemara in Kisddushin does not reflect the normative view, or more likely understood the Gemara as not teaching inviolable halachic parameters of a mitzvah, but rather providing general guidance. Like all guidance, it varies with the particular circumstances of the individual.</p>\n\n<p>There may be those who disagree, however, including Rambam, (although as noted in the footnote, his position is far from clear.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><code>1</code> The same way Chazal give guidelines for example about the optimal number of children in a classroom; this <em>shiur</em> which advises the best way to conduct oneself obviously bears no resemblance to the <em>shiur</em> of a kezayit.</p>\n\n<p><code>2</code> One wonders however, how an actual mitzvah incumbent on a person could be superseded by Torah study, which is itself universally superseded by all mitzvot as stated in Hilchot Talmud Torah (3: 4). A question that the commentators have been bothered by. If he holds like his son that the ages mentioned in the Talmud are suggestions rather than discrete obligations, then this question is resolved. Note also Rambam in his introduction to the Mishna where he writes that a court would not force a person to marry. Rather marriage is based on personal choice.  לפי שהנשואין תלוים ברצון האדם, ואין לבית דין לכוף את האדם להתחתן</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore one may not give issurei hana’ah as a gift to someone else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since the matter is controversial, I don't think it would be wise to actually <em>buy</em> such wine (with the intent of giving it as a gift).

[Alternately, if one is simply\n  eating a piece of bread or a sandwich and not setting the table, it is\n  important to make sure that the bread or sandwich is prepared and\n  ready to eat immediately after washing the hands.] Before washing, it\n  is important to check and make sure that a towel is available with\n  which to dry the hands. All of the above is to ensure that there isn’t\n  even a short Hefsek, interruption, between the washing and the eating.\n  (See Kaf HaChaim 166:3)  The Bracha of Hamotzi [on the bread] should\n  be said as soon as humanly possible after the washing.\n  <strong>It is forbidden to talk between the washing of the hands and the reciting of “Hamotzi”, even a short comment and even talking words of\n  Torah is forbidden. Saying words that are necessary for the reciting\n  of “Hamotzi”, such as saying “salt” or “knife” to indicate that those\n  items are needed is permitted.</strong> (See Mishna Berura 165:7 and 166:2.\n  The Shulchan Aruch HaRav  166:1 and some other Poskim maintain that\n  saying two  or three words such as “yes please” or “Of course not” are\n  not considered a Hefsek and are permitted.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Nothing, not even something simple and insignificant, should be done\n  between washing Al Netilas Yadayim and “Hamotzi”, unless it is\n  directly necessary to the meal. (See Mishna Berura 166:1. See Shu”t Az\n  Nidberu Vol. 10 Siman 8:2 that B’Dieved B’Sa’as HaDchak certain things\n  are permitted, as long as they don’t require much concentration. See\n  also Chazon Ish Orach Chaim Siman25:8) Simply waiting for no reason\n  between the Al Netilas Yadayim and the Hamotzi, even without doing\n  anything or talking, should also be avoided. Waiting [from after the\n  hands are completely dried until Hamotzi is recited] for more than the\n  time that it takes to walk 22 Amos (approximately 44 feet) is\n  considered a Hefsek. The time it takes to dry the hands is not\n  counted. (See Mishna Berura 166:4 and Kaf HaChaim 166:9. According to\n  the Shulchan Aruch HaRav 166:1 if in the time that you “waited” you\n  were doing something pertaining to the meal, it isn’t considered a\n  Hefsek, even longer than 22 Amos, though he writes that L’Chatchilah\n  it should be avoided.  The Aruch HaShulchan 166:1and 2 even goes so\n  far as to say that waiting in such a case is L’Chatchilah) The above\n  Halacha is for meals during the week. On Shabbos, however, when the\n  custom is to wait for everyone to wash and only then recite “Hamotzi”,\n  where it certainly takes more than “22 Amos” to do this, many Poskim\n  say that the Halacha doesn’t apply. (Aruch HaShulchan ibid. writes\n  that on Shabbos nobody is running anywhere, so their minds are on the\n  Seudah even longer than 22 Amos. Other Poskim maintain that waiting\n  for everyone to wash and sit down is considered “necessary” for the\n  meal. Some Poskim argue and are stringent, and require everyone at the\n  table to have their own 2 Chalos, even on Shabbos, as to avoid waiting\n  more than 22 Amos.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Although it is important to recite Hamotzi as soon as possible after\n  washing Al Netilas Yadayim,  if one indeed did wait longer than the 22\n  Amos, as long as he/she didn’t take their mind off the meal that is\n  about to be eaten or talk, there is no need to wash again. (Mishna\n  Berura 166:6. See also Chazon Ish Orach Chaim Siman 24:30 towards the\n  end in Dibur Hamaschil K’Shenotel L’Achila)\n  <strong>However, if one did take their mind off the upcoming meal, or did talk or make another Hefsek, the hands must be rewashed, and a new\n  Bracha of “Al Netilas Yadayim”  may need to be recited, as the\n  original washing and Bracha are nullified by the Hefsek.</strong> (See Chazon\n  Ish Siman 25:8.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>from <a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=2382\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">halacha yomit site</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Gemara in Masechet Berachot (42a) states: “Immediately following\n  hand-washing, one must bless.” The Rishonim disagree as to the\n  explanation of this Gemara: The Rambam explains that the words of the\n  Gemara refer to Mayim Acharonim (“Last Waters”) which follow the meal\n  and this means that one may not interrupt between Mayim Acharonim and\n  Birkat Hamazon. However, <strong><em>between Netilat Yadayim and the Hamotzi\n  blessing, one may speak according to the Rambam’s opinion.</em></strong>     Some\n  explain that the Gemara refers to Netilat Yadayim prior to the meal\n  and they hold that the Hamotzi blessing must immediately follow the\n  hand-washing without any interruption of speech in between them. The\n  Tur (authored by Rabbeinu Yaakov son of Rabbeinu Asher) writes that\n  his father, the Rosh, was accustomed not to speak even between the\n  initial hand-washing and the Hamotzi blessing.     The Talmud\n  Yerushalmi states: “If one does not interrupt between washing his\n  hands and blessing, the Satan does not prosecute regarding that meal.”\n  The simple meaning of the Yerushalmi seems to be referring to\n  interrupting between the hand-washing before the meal and the Hamotzi\n  blessing, for it says there that “the Satan does not prosecute\n  regarding that meal,” which seems to imply that it is referring to the\n  meal one is about to begin, i.e. that this refers to interrupting\n  between the hand-washing before the meal and the Hamotzi blessing.\n  Nevertheless, the phrase, “The Satan does not prosecute regarding that\n  meal,” can also be understood as referring to the past, in that one\n  will not be harmed by the foods he has already eaten. There are\n  sources for this explanation in several places throughout the Talmud\n  Yerushalmi.     After quoting the words of the Poskim and the Talmud\n  Yerushalmi regarding this topic, Maran HaBet Yosef (Chapter 166)\n  concludes, “It is therefore preferable to be careful with regards to\n  the hand-washing prior to the meal as well.” His words, “It is\n  therefore preferable to be careful,” seem to imply that <strong>according to\n  the letter of the law, the Halacha follows the view of the Rambam that\n  one may speak between Netilat Yadayim and the Hamotzi blessing.\n  Nevertheless, it is preferable not to speak at all between Netilat\n  Yadayim and the Hamotzi blessing. This is indeed the ruling of Maran\n  Harav Ovadia Yosef Shlit”a.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Were they considered unclean, and if so, did they go to the Temple to make offerings often, or during the times that they were commanded according to the law?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>With very few exceptions, sacrifices are for inadvertent violations which can include violations which would have had a death penalty had it been on purpose and with witnesses and warning - for example a Shabbos violation. If the person forgot what day it was, or forgot that the specific activity was forbidden, they would have to bring a sacrifice. (Rambam Sheggagos <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=9&hilchos=53&perek=1&halocha=1&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">1:1</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The sacrifice was brought when they could get to the Temple, which would be expected on one of the three holidays of Pesach (Passover), Shavuos or Sukkos. It is a requirement that it be brought at the first one after the person becomes obligated, and failure to bring them after three have passed is a violation of an additional commandment. (Talmud Rosh Hashana <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=4&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">4a</a> (at the bottom), Rambam Maaseh HaKorbanos <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=8440\" rel=\"nofollow\">14:13</a>).</p>\n\n<p><sub>Interestingly the Rambam doesn't specifically list sin offerings as subject to that issue, but I didn't see anyone comment on it, nor did I find the Rambam said anything else (but maybe I missed that) and it is specifically part of the list in Rosh Hashana.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

And if he does so before commoners, he profanes G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Rambam, the mitzvah of simcha on Yom Tov does not encourage or even permit drunkenness (Hilchos Yom Tov 6:20):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כשאדם אוכל ושותה ושמח ברגל, לא יימשך ביין ובשחוק ובקלות ראש ויאמר שכל שיוסיף בזה ירבה במצוה, שהשכרות והשחוק הרבה וקלות הראש, אינה שמחה אלא הוללות וסכלות.  ולא נצטווינו על ההוללות והסכלות, אלא על השמחה שיש בה עבודת יוצר הכול, שנאמר \"תחת, אשר לא עבדת את ה' אלוהיך, בשמחה, ובטוב לבב\" (דברים כח,מז), הא למדת שהעבודה בשמחה.  ואי אפשר לעבוד את ה'--לא מתוך שחוק, ולא מתוך קלות ראש, ולא מתוך שכרות.</p>\n<p>(Summary) When one eats and drinks and is festive on the Festivals, do not be exceeding in [consumption of] wine ... as drunkenness is not happiness, rather it is vanity and foolishness.  The mitzvah on Yom Tov is happiness which has service of the Creator in it... And it is impossible to serve Hashem out of drunkenness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Drinking on Purim is a specific case in which the direct mitzvah is to get drunk (Rambam Hilchos Megillah 2:15):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ושותה יין, עד שישתכר ויירדם בשכרות.</p>\n<p>And drink wine until you get drunk and drift off from your drunkenness</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, even in this case, some opinions understand the Rambam to not be literal, and to just mean that one should drink more than he is accustomed to, get tired from the drinking, and go to sleep (Darkei Moshe O.C. 695:1).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As noted, Rambam writes in Hilkhot De'ot (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1205.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5:5</a>) that drunkenness is a sin. Furthermore, he writes that drinking in a way that will intoxicate oneself is forbidden:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכל המשתכר, הרי זה חוטא...ואסור לשתות בצוהריים ואפילו מעט, אלא אם היה בכלל האכילה, שהשתייה שבכלל האכילה אינה משכרת</p>\n  \n  <p>Anyone who gets drunk is a sinner...And it is forbidden to drink in the afternoon--even a little--unless it is in the course of eating, for drinking that is included in eating does not get one drunk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Furthermore, he writes in Moreh Nevukhim (3:8):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As for gatherings with a view of drinking intoxicants, you should regard them as more shameful than gatherings of naked people with uncovered private parts who excrete in daylight sitting together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although he evidently holds this sin to be very severe, it does not appear that he holds it to be a technical biblical or rabbinic prohibition. He writes in Moreh Nevukhim (3:48):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The reason for <em>nazaritism</em> is most manifest it consists in bringing about abstinence from drinking wine, which has caused the  ruin of the ancients and the moderns...The prohibition you see against eating anything that cometh of the  grape vine results from the law regarding nazaritizm being an additional measure made with a view to the avoidance of wine, so that people should contend themselves with no more of it than necessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Notably, he makes no mention of drunkenness being an actual sin. Rather, he merely writes that the lesson of the nazarite is that we should avoid wine to the degree possible.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, he writes in Hilkhot Nedarim (13:24) that making an oath to never get drunk is a praiseworthy form of serving God. The implication (especially given the juxtaposition to other activities which he similarly praises swearing off) is that drunkenness is not a technical sin.</p>\n\n<p>In this same vein, his son <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_Moses_ben_Maimon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbenu Avraham</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If God would forbid everyone to drink wine and alcohol as he forbade non-kosher animals and fowl, not all would be able to comply...such a prohibition would also interfere with the benefit of wine and the occasional need to drink it. And if our Torah would say \"Drink but don't become intoxicated,\" it would not work because there is no precise amount. Therefore he taught in the true Torah that it is permitted...but indicated that drunkenness is repulsive and practically forbidden (Hamaspik L'ovdey Hashem ed. Wincelberg p. 556).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is in turn paraphrased (unattributed) by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_ben_Aderet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashba</a> (Shut HaHadashot: 367):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומפני שלא ראתה התורה למנוע שתית היין ולא יוכל לתת שעור לשתיתו עד שתתיר התורה בדרך משל שתיית הרביעית ותאסור יותר משתיית הרביעית וכיוצא בזה, ספר הכתוב התקלות הנולדות ממנו לתועלת גדולה שיהא זהיר ונזהר ממנו כל איש כפי אשר יכיר כל אחד בטבעו </p>\n  \n  <p>And since the Torah didn't want to forbid the consumption of wine, and could not give an amount to the drinking, such that the Torah would for example permit the consumption of a <em>revi'it</em> and forbid consumption of more than a <em>revi'it</em>, or the like, Scripture related the problems that stem from it, for a great purpose; that a person should be wary of it; each person based on his own self-evaluation. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>All translations of the Moreh Nevukhim are from the Pines edition.</p>\n\n\n",

In <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5106n.htm#5\">הלכות אסורי ביאה פרק ו</a> Rambam states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ה  [ו] כָּל יְמֵי הָאִשָּׁה מִיּוֹם שֶׁיִּקָּבַע לָהּ וֶסֶת עַד\n  שֶׁתָּמוּת, אוֹ עַד שֶׁיֵּעָקֵר הַוֶּסֶת לְיוֹם אַחֵר--תִּסְפֹּר\n  לְעוֹלָם שִׁבְעָה מִתְּחִלַּת יוֹם הַוֶּסֶת וְאַחֲרֵיהֶן אַחַד עָשָׂר,\n  שִׁבְעָה וְאַחֲרֵיהֶן אַחַד עָשָׂר; וְתִזָּהֵר בַּמִּנְיָן, כְּדֵי\n  שֶׁתֵּדַע בְּעֵת שֶׁתִּרְאֶה דָּם, אִם בִּימֵי נִדָּה רָאָת, אוֹ\n  בִּימֵי זִיבָה:  שֶׁכָּל יָמֶיהָ שֶׁלְּאִשָּׁה כָּךְ הֶן, שִׁבְעָה\n  יְמֵי נִדָּה וְאַחַד עָשָׂר יְמֵי זִיבָה, אֵלָא אִם כֵּן הִפְסִיקָה\n  הַלִּידָה, כְּמוֹ שֶׁיִּתְבָּאַר.</p>\n  \n  <p>All the days of the woman from the day of her first menstruation until\n  she dies, or until the day of her menstruation is removed to another\n  day -- will forever count seven days from the beginning day of her\n  menstruation and afterward eleven days, seven and then eleven; and be\n  cautious in the counting, so that she will know at the time she sees\n  blood, if it’s seen in the Niddah days, or in the Zavah days: because\n  all the days of a woman are such, seven days of Niddah and eleven days\n  of Zavah, unless interrupted by a birth, as we will explain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, he’s saying that the seven Niddah days and eleven Zavah days strictly alternate starting from the woman’s first period.   </p>\n\n<p>As far as what I’ve read, the opinion of pretty much all the other Rishonim is well represented by the Sefer HaChinuch ( ספר החינוך, מצוה קפב ):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מדיני המצוה, מה שאמרו חז”ל ( נידה עב ע”ב ) שאחד עשר יום הם שהם בין נדה\n  לנדה, כלומר: שהאשה נעשית בהם זבה, כך היא הלכה למשה מסיני. ופירוש הדבר\n  כך הוא: שכל אשה בעת שתראה דם בתחילת ראייתה תקרא נדה, ועניין הנדות כך\n  דינו: שאם תראה יום אחד דם, או אפילו שבע ימים רצופים, כל זמן שתפסוק הדם\n  ביום השביעי מבעוד יום, טובלת לערב, דהיינו הלילה שמחרתו יום שמיני\n  לתחילת ראייתה. ואחר טבילתה טהורה לבעלה. ואחר שבעת ימי הנדות, אם תראה\n  דם בתוך אחד עשר יום אחר השבעה, יקרא אותו הדם דם זיבה, ודינו כן: שאם\n  תראה ממנו יום אחד , בין שתראה בתחילת הלילה או בסוף היום, משמרת יום אחד\n  כנגדו וטובלת, וטהורה לבעלה לערב. וטבילתה אפילו ביום משתנץ החמה, וזאת\n  היא זיבה קטנה. וכן אם תראה דם שני ימים ותפסוק בשלישי, דינה כמו כן\n  לשמור יום אחד, ובכן יספיק לה אפילו לשני ימים ותטהר, וזאת גם כן תקרא\n  זיבה קטנה.  ואם תראה דם בתוך אחד עשר יום אלו שלושה ימים רצופים, תקרא\n  זיבה גדולה וצריכה לישב שבעה ימים נקיים ואחר כך טובלת וטהורה לבעלה. \n  ואחר אחד עשר יום אלו אם תראה, חוזרת לתחילת נידות ויש לה שבעה ימים כדין\n  נדה , כמו שאמרנו למעלה. וכן יהיה הדבר לעולם, אחר הנדות יש לה אחד עשר\n  יום שבהן נעשית זבה , ואחר שעברו אותן האחד עשר יום אינה נעשית זבה לעולם\n  עד שיעברו עליה שבעה ימי נדות. ומפני שכבר טעו בזה אחרים וחשבו שהחשבון\n  הוא שתמנה שבעה ימים של נדות ואחד עשר יום של זיבות, ושבע של נדות ואחד\n  עשר של זיבות, וכן לעולם, הארכתי בעניין לומר שאינו כן, אלא לעולם אין\n  ימי זיבה אלא אחד עשר יום אחר שבעה של נדות, ולא אחר כך לעולם עד שתחזור\n  לתחילת הנדות. רצוני לומר שאם תעמוד ולא תראה אחר האחד עשר יום אפילו\n  שנה, אין לה דין זבה עד שיעברו עליה שבעת יהי נדות.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to the laws of the commandment, what Chazal z”l said (\n  Niddah 72b ) that there are eleven days between one Niddah and the\n  following Niddah, such that the woman becomes a Zavah during those\n  days, this is the halacha to Moshe handed down from Sinai.  And such\n  is the explanation of the thing: and any woman who shall see blood at\n  the beginning of her Niddah days shall be called a Niddah, and the\n  laws of Niddah as as follows: that if she sees blood one day. or even\n  all seven days continuously, as long as the bleeding stops prior to\n  sunset on the seventh day, she immerses that evening, specifically the\n  night that it’s morrow is the eighth day from the beginning of her\n  Niddah days.  And after her immersion she is pure for her husband. \n  And after the seven Niddah days, if she sees blood in the eleven days\n  after the seven days, that blood shall be called Zivah blood, and it’s\n  laws are as follows: if she see one day, whether she sees at the\n  beginning of the night or the end of the day, she keeps one clean day\n  against it and immerses, and she is pure to her husband in the\n  evening.  And her immersion is even during the day from the sunrise,\n  and this is the minor Zivah.  And likewise, if she sees blood two days\n  and it stops the third day, and her law is to keep one clean day, and\n  likewise it is enough for her even for two days and she is purified,\n  and this is also called a minor Zivah.  And if she shall see blood in\n  the eleven days three days in a row, she shall be called a major Zivah\n  and she must sit seven cleans days and afterwards immerses and is pure\n  for her husband.  And after these eleven days if she sees, she returns\n  to the beginning of Niddah and she has seven days according to the\n  laws of Niddah, according to what we said above.  And such shall it be\n  forever, that after the Niddah days she has eleven days in which she\n  can become a Zavah, and after those eleven days have passed she may\n  never become a Zavah again until she passes seven days of Niddah.  And\n  because others have already become mistaken in this matter and thought\n  the calculation is that she should count seven days of Niddah and\n  eleven days of Zivah, and seven days of Niddah and eleven of Zivah\n  forever, because of this have I prolonged the discussion to say that\n  it is not so, instead there are never Zivah days except the eleven\n  days immediately following the seven Niddah days, and never again\n  until after having returned to the beginning of the Niddah days.  It\n  is my desire to point out that if a woman gets up from her Niddah days\n  and after the eleven days even for a year, she can not be a Zavah\n  until she passes seven days of Niddah. ( <em>my translation</em> )</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above is fairly self-explanatory and the comments at the end seem to be clearly addressing the Rambam’s position.  </p>\n\n<p>So how is it that there are two interpretations here if in fact \"Halacha to Moses from Sinai\" means what the lecturer I heard says it means?  I asked him and he said he wasn't aware of this particular case.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Rambam's opinion is that halacha limoshe misinai is undisputed. There is a tosafos in eiruvin which seems to say otherwise. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=857&pgnum=213\" rel=\"nofollow\">The chavos yair (siman 192)</a> has a very long tshuva addressing this issue and as one of his proofs to uphold the shita of tosafos he asks your question exactly. How could the Rambam have a shita about a halacha limoshe misinai that is disputed by everyone?! </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The lecturer may have been referring to the Rambam in Mamrim 1:3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דברי הקבלה, אין בהן מחלוקת לעולם; וכל דבר שתמצא בו מחלוקת, בידוע שאינו קבלה ממשה רבנו</p>\n  \n  <p>Words of \"kabbala\" are never argued about; anything about which there is an argument can be known that it was not received from Moshe</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam echoes this idea in the introduction to the Mishnah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזה עיקר יש לך לעמוד על סודו. והוא, שהפירושים המקובלים מפי משה, אין מחלוקת בהם בשום פנים, שהרי מאז ועד עתה לא מצאנו מחלוקת נפלה בזמן מן הזמנים, מימות משה ועד רב אשי בין החכמים</p>\n  \n  <p>And this is a principle that you need to realize, which is that the explanations received from Moshe do not have arguments, as we do not find a dispute about them among the Rabbis from the time of Moshe <strong>until Rav Ashi</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that here the Rambam clearly limits it to until the times of Rav Ashi, the end of the Talmud.

    "content": "# What is the importance of the tallit during prayer?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the difference whether one wears a tallit or not during תפילה (prayer/worship, sacred service)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The wearing of a <em>tallith messuyesseth</em> during <em>tefillah</em> is very important. However, it does not prevent one from praying should the time for prayer arrive and he find himself without a <em>tallith</em> - whether <em>gadhol</em> or <em>qatan</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam in the <em>Mishneh Thorah</em> (<em>Hilkhoth Tefillah</em> 4:1ff) lists five things which prevent one from praying, even if the time for prayer has arrived. The wearing of a <em>tallith</em> is not among them. Additionally, the Rambam (<em>Hilkhoth Tefillah</em> 5:1) lists eight things which one should be careful to fulfill during prayer, but do not prevent one from praying should they be left unfulfilled. Again, the wearing of a <em>tallith</em> is not among them.</p>\n\n<p>In <em>Hilkhoth Ssissith</em> 3:12-13, the Rambam expresses the importance of the <em>misswah</em> of <em>ssissith</em>, and especially during prayer. He says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>uvsho`âth ha-tafilloh ssorikh le-hizoher bi-yôther, genoi godhôl hu le-thâlmidh hâkhomim shayyithpâllâl wa-hu eino oTuf.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>Translation</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"And during prayer, one must be even more careful [to be wearing <em>ssissith</em>, i.e. more than at other times of the day], for it is a great disgrace for a <em>talmidh hakhamim</em> [<strong>a Torah scholar</strong>] to pray and not be wrapped [in a <em>tallith messuyesseth</em>].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, while it is important for each Jewish man to both acquire and wear a four-cornered garment with <em>ssissith</em>, it does not prevent one from praying (or reciting <em>Qiryath Shema`</em>). </p>\n\n<p>And, being that the Rambam mentions it especially regarding Torah scholars, it indicates that he feels that it is imperative for them to wear a <em>tallith</em> during prayer because of their connection to the Torah itself (cf. <em>Hilkhoth De`oth</em> 5:1ff) - although it still would not prevent them from fulfilling their obligation of prayer.</p>\n\n<p>As for the commonly cited idea that not wearing <em>ssissith</em> during <em>Qiryath Shema`</em> causes one to be <em>me'idh sheqer be-assmo</em> (\"to testify falsely concerning himself\"), this is an idea that stems from the Zohar - it is mentioned nowhere in the corpus of Hazal (i.e. <em>Talmudh Bavli, Talmudh Yerushalmi, Mishnah, Tosefta, Mekhiltoth, Sifra, Sifrei</em> - cf. Rambam, <em>Haqdamah le-Mishneh Thorah</em> 24).</p>\n\n<p>In the <em>Arokh HaShulhan</em>, <em>Hilkhoth Ssissith Wa-'Attifatho</em> 8:1, it discusses the apparent contradiction between the assertion of the Zohar and the <em>halakhah</em> in this matter. There he states that this statement of the Zohar is referring to someone who recites <em>Qiryath Shema`</em> while wearing a four-cornered garment which does not have <em>ssissith</em> tied onto it - <em>dawqah</em>. [See there for a full discussion of this subject]</p>\n\n<p>As far as their prayer is concerned, there is no difference between one who wears a <em>tallith messuyesseth</em> and one who does not. However, the one who is able to wear <em>ssissith</em> during prayer and fails to do so has been lax in his commitment to wear them during their prayers. Of course, if one finds himself at the time of prayer but without a <em>tallith messuyesseth</em> that he can put on, he should certainly not delay his prayers or refrain from praying on account of such circumstance.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that this helps. Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34229&st=&pgnum=17\" rel=\"nofollow\">meditation said before putting on the Tallit godol</a> says,  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועל ידי מצות ציצית, תנצל נפשי רוחי ונשמתי ותפלתי מן החיצונים </p>\n  \n  <p>and through the mitzva of tzitzis may my soul, spirit and prayer be protected\n  from (harmful) external influences</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems that the tallit somehow protects the thoughts of the person praying. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=61&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">O Ch 24 (1)</a> says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>that a person should wear tzitzis (tallis koton) all day and if he\n  does not he should at least wear a tallis godol when he prays.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>MB [3] says that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>someone who says Shema without tzitzis is as if he testifies falsely\n  for he says the parsha of  tzitzis and does not fulfil it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He quotes the Chayei Adam  who says that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>people on a journey who daven without a  tallis godol do not do well\n  because the majority of the tallisos ketanim are not made according to\n  the law in all its particulars.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So another reason to wear a  tallis godol is avoid  saying the parsha of  tzitzis and  not fulfilling it.</p>\n\n\n",

He cites RaSh\"Y (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9960/jewish/Chapter-32.htm#v=42&showrashi=true\">BeMidbar 32:42</a>) who points out that there should have been a mappiq in the <em>Heh</em> of the word \"לה\". And that, without the mappiq, the word can be read \"לא\" (i.e. \"לא נבח\"). Because it can be read as such, RaSh\"Y explains, this can explain why Novahh's legacy didn't last. But, \"what's the lesson\" asks Rav Mansour?</p>\n\n<p>Rav Mansour then cites Rav Shimon Schwab who explains that there is a big difference between Ya'ir and Novahh. The difference is in how two different people look at their wealth. Ya'ir had a proper understanding: wealth is not bad, but wealth does not define a person's essence. A person possesses wealth; but, that person's wealth does not define him. That, explains Rav Mansour, is why Ya'ir calls his cities Havot Ya'ir. Ya'ir is Ya'ir and his cities are his cities; but, they're not one and the same!</p>\n\n<p>But, Novahh had a different philosophy: he called his property Novahh, because he saw himself as being defined by his wealth; as being one with his wealth. That is why RaSh\"Y says it can be read \"לא נבח\". Novahh's legacy didn't last, because of his warped hashqafah.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Mansour cites a common and unfortunate occurrence today. Today, we ask people immediately upon having a short conversation with them \"What do you do for a living?\" And, based on that answer, we judge them. If s/he is a doctor, s/he is respected. If s/he works in sanitation, s/he is a zero. We don't judge people for what they are, we judge them by what they have. The guy can be a crook and can beat up his wife. It doesn't matter. We're not judging the person based on those things. We're judging him based on his wealth.</p>\n\n<p>So, by mentioning Novahh only briefly (thus implying that his legacy withered away), the Torah is teaching us the crucial and eternal lesson that \"it's not what you have; it's what you are that matters\".</p>\n\n\n",

There are people who adopted seeing each other once a week in addition to speaking on the phone once a week. That is a common practice but not everyone talks so little – some talk more often – but there are guidelines to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only source I could find for this was Mishna, Pirkei Avot 1:5, and that is more general. I've looked superficially in Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEezer; and Mishneh Torah, Issurei Biah. I can find nothing concrete.</p>\n\n<p>Please provide specific sources for such an idea, if it indeed comes from traditional Torah sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There would be no such source from a time when there was no dating, so you need to look only in the past 50 years of Halacha.</p>\n\n<p>The one known source is from the Gemora (קידושין מא א)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אסור לאדם שיקדש את האשה עד שיראנה שמא יראה בה דבר מגונה ותתגנה עליו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And now, one should check perhaps also by talking.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Even the mishnah in pirkei avos is not interpreted by many achronim as the simple understanding. \nFor example the Maharal explains that the mishnahs meaning is that a man should not learn torah with a woman. (see his peirush on this mishnah in full) but not having to do with having a conversation. </p>\n\n<p>Also a different version in avos derebi natan gives a slightly different approach. Basically saying, to limit the scope of conversation to things that wont cause issues. \nאבות דרבי נתן, פרק שביעי, משנה ג</p>\n\n<p>דבר אחר: אל תרבה שיחה עם האשה כיצד? בזמן שאדם בא לבית המדרש ולא היו נוהגין בו כבוד, או שערער עם חברו, אל ילך ויאמר לאשתו: כך וכך ערערתי עם חברי, כך וכך אמר לי, כך וכך אמרתי לו, מפני שבוזה את עצמו ובוזה את אשתו ובוזה את חברו, ואשתו שהיתה נוהגת בו כבוד עומדת ומשחקת עליו. כיון ששמע חברו אמר: אוי לי, דברים שבינו לביני הלך ושׂחן לאשתו. ונמצא אותו האיש בוזה את עצמו ואת אשתו ואת חברו.\nאבות דרבי נתן, פרק שביעי, משנה ג</p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish writes that Rizui - time that she needs, certainly does not go into this category (and give a blanket heter for shanah rishonah).\nIt is attributed to Rav Wolbe that nowadays shana Rishona is 10 years. \nI also heard in the name of a gadol from the last generation, that tarbe, means whatever she needs is appropriate, but if you need more light talk, that is excessive. </p>\n\n<p>Here is a gemara that does support the idea of not having conversation with ones wife. \nאמר רב: אפילו שיחה יתירה שבין איש לאשתו מגידים לו לאדם בשעת מיתה. איני?

Great emphasis is placed on\n  dress in today's religious society so that deviating from the norm in\n  dress is often taken as a sign of rejection of basic Torah principles,\n  even though in fact this need not be the case at all. Yet, in all\n  cases, modest dress remains a Jewish virtue and a hallmark of\n  religious Jewish society</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But hats were not always black.

Walking around a European city that could politely be described as \"filthy\"<sup>2</sup> while wearing white will have you looking like a tramp by lunchtime.

One is that it is part of the <strong>process</strong> of becoming Jewish (for a man). In that case, there is really nothing to start with - if he isn't getting a circumcision it isn't doing the process, he doesn't become Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the case where he can't have a circumcision, there are two possible cases. One is that he lacks the anatomy (there could have been a previous accident, etc.). In that case he is viewed as it is with a woman - it doesn't apply to him. However, if he has the technical capacity to have circumcision, but could not <strong>with permission</strong> of the Torah - i.e. the procedure would kill him, or there is a substantial concern of that outcome - then he simply cannot convert. It is not that he can become Jewish and skip the circumcision. He can't fulfill the circumcision according to the Torah, so he can't become Jewish according to the Torah. (Or perhaps he can choose to risk his life according to the Torah in this case).</p>\n\n<p>The second way of evaluating it is that the requirement of circumcision is a technical point - he is becoming Jewish, so he is required to be circumcised. He takes care of that first so he doesn't spend any time as a Jew without fulfilling that obligation. In that case, if the procedure has a substantial concern of killing him, the Torah says that he is <strong>exempt</strong> from this commandment, at which point the conversion can proceed without it. (There is another way of looking at this - if the Torah says he is exempt he can convert, just like he can convert without bringing the sacrifice since we don't have the Temple today and he is thus exempt from the sacrifice but can still convert - but in that case conversion without actually being exempt from circumcision is a non-starter just like the first evaluation).</p>\n\n<p>In the case of someone who simply doesn't want to have a circumcision, according to the first evaluation above - there is nothing to talk about. According to the second evaluation, it would get into a different discussion. One of the fundamental requirements of conversion is accepting the obligations of the Torah. If someone is rejecting any of it, the conversion is not valid. So if someone doesn't agree to be circumcised, he is rejecting a Mitzvah and would thus invalidate any conversion ceremonies. Note that it isn't enough to agree that in theory G-d commanded them. The convert actually has to intend to do them. Here the refusal is clearly showing that he has no such intention.</p>\n\n<p>There is an edge case to discuss here - he converts not knowing that he has to be circumcised. Because while the convert has to accept upon himself to do all of the commandments, he doesn't have to actually know what they all are. According to the second evaluation, he might well end up being Jewish. That would be a shame, because while as a non-Jew he could have had a share in the world to come, as an uncircumcised Jew (at least as the Rambam defines Kares) he would not.</p>\n\n<p>As for which commandment - there is a constant obligation for a Jewish male to be circumcised from 8 days on (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9913#v=3&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 12:3</a>).

The reason for this is twofold:</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, your body is only yours on loan from Hashem, and just as a <em>shomer</em> is obligated to guard and protect an object given to him for safekeeping, so too a person has to protect his body and ensure it is in excellent condition. Since obesity is destructive to a person's well being, being obese, or for that matter not taking action to keep your body healthy, would be in violation of \"Ushmartem es nafshosechem\" as you are being derelict in your duties as a <em>shomer</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, keeping Torah and Mitzvot requires vigour and enthusaism, and a perpetual sense of \"Ivdoo es Hashem Besimcha\". These requirements are often compromised when one is obese or unhealthy, which may lead to lethargy and melancholy, both which will adversely affect ones avodat Hashem besimcha.</p>\n\n<p>These above comments can be added to if we take into account chassidic aspects of indulgence in food. Put simply, there is a basic doctrine of \"hiskafya\", which simply means self-restraint. That is, restraining ones self from excessive eating for purely pleasure, rather than eating for maintaining ones health. There is a well known chassidic saying: \"What is forbidden - is forbidden. And what is permissable - is not  necessarily to be done\". </p>\n\n\n",

I would be doing this at home when my wife is present or in a spa where there are other customers, so I don't think that are issues of yichud. </p>\n\n<p>By \"massage\", I'm addressing two aspects. Some people have massage for relaxation or to feel good. Others require massage therapy as part of chiropractic or other muscular or physical problems.

Is there any difference in halacha if the reason for massage is medically necessary or for pleasure?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>For medical purposes this case should be no different to other cases whereby a man can receive treatment from a female doctor (and vice versa). Despite this, some choose (when possible) a doctor of the same gender in any case, if it makes no difference e.g. if it makes no difference for you, and is possible, to have a full medical examination by a doctor of the same gender (all things being equal) then there is no question that one should choose the same gender.</p>\n\n<p>There are also different types of massage. Some involve contact with parts of the body that are always covered. Having had massages myself, I can imagine it being a very sensual experience when sharing this with someone of the opposite gender and may certainly lead to inappropriate thoughts (or God forbid worse). Not being sensitive to the touch of the opposite gender could be considered an unfortunate desensitisation of what should be a sacred male-female contact between a husband and wife.</p>\n\n<p>The challenges for men to overcome their yeitzer hara are difficult enough.

Let's say that it's somewhat less severe, it's preferable to have someone of the same gender, but if not, a doctor is a medical professional and is thus allowed to touch their clients for the aforementioned reason. In the case you're referring to, for the mere sake of a massage that has nothing to do with medicinal practices, the answer would be no. If it had to do with a medical procedure, then it would be preferable to find someone of the same gender.\nThe simple answer to the pleasure aspect of a massage is: find someone of your own gender otherwise that would probably be an isser.</p>\n\n\n",

Now a kal vachomer can be made: Since in the more stringent case of defilement by a human corpse, only kohanim are prohibited, then in the more lenient case of defilement by animal carcasses, how much more so [should only kohanim be prohibited! If so,] what does Scripture mean by, “you shall not touch their carcasses”? [It means that Israelites may not touch animal carcasses] on the Festivals [since at those times they deal with holy sacrifices and enter the Temple].

However that has to do with a different, Rabbinic prohibition where someone may come to eat from the food. Vis-a-vis this verse, there is no prohibition to handle the non-Kosher per se, rather it is prohibited to handle it when it would take away from the holiday obligations in the times of the Temple.</p>\n\n\n",

Sure enough, I see that Isaiah 7:14 says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The <strong>virgin</strong> will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. - <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+7%3A14&version=NIV\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Isaiah 7:14 (NIV)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But wait, that's a Christian translation.

So, now the question is: <strong>why is it so significant that a <em>young woman</em> conceive and bear a son</strong>?

Such a question, although understandable, incorrectly read the emphasis implied by the Christian understanding into the proper translation. Who is having the child is part of the sign, but not the focal point. The intent is clear when we read the fulfillment of this prophecy in the next chapter where Isaiah clearly identifies his children, including the one born in fulfillment of this prophecy, as \"signs\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Behold, I and the children whom Hashem has given me are <strong>signs</strong>\n(לְאתוֹת = \"for signs\" is plural of the word found in 7:14) and\nsymbols for Israel from Hashem. (Isaiah 8:18, Stone Edition)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A careful read of Isaiah 7:14 in its context and followed up with chapter 8 will reveal many conceptual and verbal parallels allowing us to comfortably identify the child predicted in Isaiah 7:14 with the son born to Isaiah's wife in Isaiah 8:3. The sign in Isaiah 7:14 is not supernatural but symbolic, the same way the term is used in chapter 8 regarding Isaiah children. Note how Isaiah's children have symbolic names in 7:3 and 8:3 and how they only other uses in the Hebrew Bible of they symbolic name Immanuel are found in chapter 8.</p>\n<p>Whether something validates or invalidates a \"Messianic candidate\" has no relevance to Isaiah 7:14 which is not a Messianic prophecy.</p>\n<p>While it is correct to say that \"the term can also be translated 'young woman'\", it is important to be clear that \"virgin\" is not a correct translation of עלמה. Some will certainly argue this point but briefly it can be noted:</p>\n<p>a)When virginity as a status is significant, such as legal contexts, the T'nakh uses the term בתולה.\nb)In no [other] instance of עלמה in the T'nakh would <em>virgin</em> be a preferable translation.\nc)The usage in Proverbs 30:18-33 is strongly suggestive that <em>virgin</em> would be an inappropriate translation.\nd)The Greek text of Matthew cites this verse using the Greek word for Virgin. The Peshita (an early Christian translation into a dialect of Aramaic), uses the Aramaic cognate for בתולה, NOT עלמה, to translate the text of Matthew. (This is an original observation I am unaware of being discussed by others, See <a href=\"http://machzikeihadas.blogspot.com/2012/11/who-is-almahs-son.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for further discussion).</p>\n<p>Much ink has been spilled over this passage and its interpretation but I believe that I have addressed the main point being asked and highlighted important context for understanding the best interpretation of the passage.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Actually, the statement was that this particular young woman (Isaiah's wife - there with them) <strong>is pregnant</strong> and is going to give birth naturally (within 6 - 9 months since she is not yet visibly pregnant).

(Translation my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So while you should always use your judgement as to the most effective way to help others while minimizing any damaging effects of one's behaviours, it does not appear that <em>any</em> way of attempting to protect the public could qualify as <em>l'shon hara</em> according to the Meiri.</p>\n\n<p>This also appears to be the opinion of R. Elhanan Wasserman, who generalises this to all interpersonal mitsvot. He writes in Kovets Ha’arot (Yevamot: 70):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולולי דבריהם היה נראה, דכל האיסורין שבין אדם לחבירו אינן איסורין אלא דרך קילקול והשחתה שלא לצורך... \n  וכן בלאו דלא תלך רכיל, מותר לספר לה\"ר על בעלי מחלוקת כדי להשקיט המריבה. וכן בלאו דאונאת דברים... \n  ומוכח מכ\"ז, דכל האיסורין האלו הותרו לצורך תועלת  </p>\n  \n  <p>If not for their words, it would appear that all interpersonal prohibitions, are only forbidden in the context of degrading and tarnishing others for no purpose...And so too with the prohibition of gossiping, it is permitted to tell <em>l'shon hara</em> on disputants to quell the dispute...And similarly with the prohibition of <em>onaat d'varim</em> [verbal abuse]...And it is evident from all this that all of these prohibition are permitted to achieve an end. (Trans. my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Importantly, they do not attach conditions to to'elet, as the Haffets Hayyim famously does.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the eminent modern day halakhic authority, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osher_Weiss\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Asher Weiss</a> Shlit\"a writes in Minhat Asher to Leviticus (p. 268) that to'elet renders speech permissible and not l'shon hara, by definition.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>באיסורי תורה צריך לדון בדיני דחיה האם תועלת זו ראויה לדחות איסור ...אבל בהלכות לשה\"ר לאו מדין דחיה אתינן עלה, אלא יסוד האיסור תלוי במדה רעה וכל שכונתו לטובה...ולא לרעתו אין בזה עבירה כלל, ודו\"ק בכ\"ז כי לענ\"ד ברור הוא</p>\n  \n  <p>With Torah prohibitions one must evaluate with the laws of <em>dehiya</em> [prioritisation], whether this <em>to'elet</em> [purpose] is sufficient to supersede a prohibition. But with the laws of <em>l'shon hara</em>, we are not utilising the law of supercession. Rather, the very definition of the prohibition depends on negative character traits, and anything in which his intent is for good...and not for someone else's harm, has no prohibition whatsoever, and consider all of this, for in my humble opinion, it is clear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He shows that this is the opinion of Rashi (Moed Katan 16a s.v. amar lei la'avuha) and sharply disputes (p. 267) the Haffets Hayyim's attempt at escaping the implication of Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך בחפץ חיים...כתב...ודבריו קשים לכאו' דמלבד שאין הדברים מתיישבים בלשון רש\"י</p>\n  \n  <p>However in Haffets Hayyim...he wrote...and his words appear difficult, for besides for the fact that his words don't fit with Rashi's wording...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[Like R. Elhanan, he connects this to the idea that interpersonal mitsvot in general are by definition only prohibited when they are malicious. (In particular he connects this to the prohibition of overcharging, see p. 267)].</p>\n\n<p>This apparently nearly unanimous view expressed by the Meiri, R. Wasserman, R. Weiss, and the numerous authorities they cite as support, is expressed by R. David Cohen Shlit\"a, as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This to my mind [is similar to\n  when] the poskim speak about lashon harah l’toeles [for a helpful purpose], which is not limited to loshan\n  harah. Any [transgression of] bein adam l’chaveiro [when it is] l’toeles is mutar (cited <a href=\"http://drsorotzkin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eng-honoring-abusive-parents.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, page 7)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Importantly, he clarifies (p. 267) that there are limits to the limitation of <em>l'shon hara</em> to cases of malicious intent:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דשאני המספר לשה\"ר דרך קלות ראש דהרי פושע גמור ובזה ודאי עובר בחטא כיון שהדברים מצד עצמם הם לשה\"ר גמור ובדרך שחוק וקלות ראש מנבל הוא את פיו בכה\"ג פושע הוא אף שלא התכוין להרע לחבירו</p>\n  \n  <p>For it is different if a person speaks <em>l'shon hara</em> with frivolity, since the matters are intrinsically <em>l'shon hara</em> and in the context of frivolity and levity, he pollutes his mouth. In such a case, he is a willful sinner even though he didn't intent to harm his fellow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is: \"I was just having a good time\", isn't a legitimate excuse to speak disparagingly about someone. However, by all indications, speaking when there is some specific purpose, such as warning others of a negative landlord, would be fine.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If this warning of yours is meant to stop or prevent any loss on behalf on the possible future renters, then it is permitted to tell them Lashon Harah about your past landlord (See the Beer Mayim Chaim, Rechilus, Klal 9). See also The Rambam in Sefer Hamitzvos 297. The Chofetz Chaim also brings proofs based on the Rashbam (Bava Basra 39b), Tosafot (Sanhedrin 73a), and the Sefer Hachinuch (Mitzva \n237) </p>\n\n<p>However, The Chofetz Chaim qualifies, that this is only permissible if a number of other conditions are met (such as verifying the information, only altruistic intent, attempting other methods of stopping the loss, etc. <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?%20title=Lashon_Hara%23Saying_Lashon_Harah_without_conditions\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>However, telling over this information is only permitted when speaking to the person who stands to lose financially, but to spread it around to others who have nothing to do with the situation and do not stand to lose anything then it is forbidden. If there is no other option, it would still be prohibited, the chiyuv to save another Jew from a loss is not enough of reason to justify spreading it around to other who have nothing to do with it.\n (As per the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda Baum of Jerusalem)</p>\n\n<p>Thus, posting online where others who are not looking into the apartment will be seeing it, is not considered a valid method of telling over the pertinent information. Rather, you must find a way to tell over this information privately only to the people who are actively looking at the apartment to rent.</p>\n\n<p>If the landlord is a gentile, there is no issur of lashon harah, rather it is mitzvah to warn others of his behavior. </p>\n\n\n",

My question is how this works out mathematically. In a leap year, we add altogether 4 shabbatot (one month) yet if we separate all the parshiyot we add eight parshiyot to the year. Yet somehow we always finish the Torah on the same day every year. How does this work out?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>To answer your question as briefly as I can, during a leap year where Rosh Hashannah begins on Tursday and the year is \"Chaser\" - \"Deficient\" meaning 383 days long, then Pesach begins on Sunday, and there will be 55 Shabatot in total. I am also assuming that we are talking about Galut readings, as Israel readings have slightly different rules.</p>\n\n<p>We have 54 parshiot. One of them, namely V'Zot Habracha is never read on Shabbat, b/c Simchat Torah is never on Shabbat. So, that leaves 53 parshi'ot that we must be concerned about.</p>\n\n<p>Two Shabbatot are occupied by Hol Hamo'ed Pesach (or, in this case, since Pesach began on Sun., it would be 7th day of Pesach), and Hol Hamo'ed Succot. So, of the 55 Shabatot, 2 are unsuable for the regular parsha. That leaves us with 53 Shabbatot for the 53 parshi'ot making it an exact fit where no parshiot are doubled.</p>\n\n<p>From this calculation, I think you may be able to deduce how all the others fit in during non-leap years.</p>\n\n<p>You should read this <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/vol%202%20epstein.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">interesting paper</a> that discusses doubling, separating and even \"halving\" the parshiot.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, this year is one of the rare occasions where Matot and Mas'ei are read separately.

Finally, the practice in the Rheinland, Eastern Ashkenazi siddurim, and Israeli siddurim is to say shash\"y after Aleinu (this practice is consistent throughout the week) (sources: Rödelheim siddurim and machzorim, Artscroll, Birnbaum, Koren, and Rinat Yisrael). </p>\n\n<p>As most siddurim print Anim Zemirot either right before- or right after shash\"y, it is said in connection with the particular tehillah.</p>\n\n<p>*The positioning given for Shir Shel Yom is based on when it is said on Shabbat and yom tov.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I spoke to a number of people regarding the different placements of Anim Zemiros.

(Let's assume it's a life-saving procedure.) During shul, he notices that his watch has stopped. He wants to reset the time so that he will not be late for the surgery. Since he is a surgeon who cannot be late, can he override the prohibition because of piku'ach nefesh of someone else?</p>\n\n<p>While technically, it is possible for him to ask someone else for the time, in this case, his being prompt is urgent, and there's no guarantee that he can find someone to ask, or have his mind set on asking at the proper time, as his mind is focused on the patient.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I've been thinking about this question on and off for a while; even asking <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/38326/does-use-of-bi-lateral-cochlear-implants-eliminate-the-definition-of-a-cheresh#comment105637_40110\">a <em>frum</em> surgeon I know</a> for his thoughts.

Why not just have Beis Din write out a Get and deliver it?</p>\n\n<p>Really only the Rambam's opinion would justify requiring the verbalized consent - and even that seems a stretch (if he really wants it, just do it!).</p>\n\n<p>To clarify, I'm not questioning the fact that there is a need (as in this is the Halacha) to force the husband to agree. I'm just wondering why the need for the use of force like that, when in reality it accomplishes nothing (except according to the Rambam).</p>\n\n<p>To ask this in Yeshivish: The saying רוצה אני is a גילוי and בירור that he in fact wants it, but the purpose is the wanting, not the incantation of the words. Therefore, in this case, since he doesn't want it anyway, why force the incantation of the words? How did that add anything to the Get.</p>\n\n<p>Even according to the Rambam it seems דוחק to say that the requirement is a גילוי of the subconscious desire of the Yetzer Tov to listen to the Beis Din, because if we are sure it is there, why does he have to say it? But at least according to that, בדוחק, you can say that the requirement is that he actually reveals that desire. But what about the opinion which is actually the controlling Halachic opinion? What is the purpose and accomplishment of making him pretend to be מגלה something that isn't there? And that is so important that it is worth using torture to get there?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Kesubos 3a has the source of this idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומשום פרוצות שרינן אשת איש לעלמא אין כל דמקדש אדעתא דרבנן מקדש ואפקעינהו רבנן לקידושי מיניה</p>\n<p>Due to immodesty the Rabbis would permit a married woman to anyone?  Yes, as everyone who performs Kiddushin does so according to the guidance of the Rabbis, and they nullify this Kiddushin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi there, twice, stresses the role of the Get:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל המקדש - כל המקדש אשה על דעת שהנהיגו חכמי ישראל בישראל הוא מקדשה שיהיו קיימין קידושין לפי דברי חכמים ויהיו בטילים לפי דברי חכמים <strong>על ידי גיטין שהכשירו חכמים</strong></p>\n<p>(Summary) Kiddushin is conducted according to the Sages, and they are nullified <strong>through Gittin which the Sages validate</strong></p>\n<p>אפקעוה רבנן לקידושין - כשיבא גט כזה אחריהם</p>\n<p>When a Get like this comes before them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rashba there is more explicit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל דמקדש אדעתא דרבנן מקדש ואפקעינהו רבנן לקדושין מיניה - וא\"ת מאי שנא מטבע במים שאין להם סוף דלא אפקעינהו רבנן לקדושיה משום עגינות י\"ל דבכדי לא מפקיעי להו רבנן לקידושיה אלא היכא דאיכא סרך גיטא כדהכא</p>\n<p>Why is this different than the case of a person who has been lost at sea, in which they did not nullify her Kiddushin and prevent Aguna (being stuck)?  We could say that the Rabbis do not nullify a Kiddushin for naught, except in the situation where there is at least some hint of a Get.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kiddushin is a big deal. The Rabbis did not want to uproot a Kiddushin without having at least the formalities of a divorce document, in order to maintain the seriousness of what Kiddushin is.  If they just \"popped\" Kiddushin out of existence, it would devalue what Kiddushin is.</p>\n<p>I think* that the idea here is that Chazal wanted to maintain, to the degree possible, the framework of \"כשיבא גט\" - when a Get comes.  They did not want to create the Get.  If they happened to have a Get to work with, they would use it.  Granted in this case, the Get \"happens\" to be here because they engineered the husband's creating it, but to the extent possible they wanted to maintain the format of them using an existing Get, not creating one from scratch.</p>\n<p>*By which I mean I do not have an explicit source, it is just how I understand it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Firstly, a גט is a document that is willingly given by a man to his wife, or sent with a worthy messenger.  It has to be written by him or with his שליחות, and בית דין cannot just write and give it; that would make her think she was allowed to remarry, and 'ould lead to ממזרים.</p>\n\n<p>What the רבנן can do, is nullify the entire marriage retroactively, as the statement הרי את מקודשת לי בטבעת זו <strong>כדת משה וישראל</strong> implies that the marriage should be חל only if the רבנן are ok with it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>.גמרא גיטין לג:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל דמקדש אדעתא דרבנן מקדש ואפקעינהו רבנן לקידושין מיניה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>רש\"י, same place:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>אדעתא דרבנן מקדש</strong> - להיות קדושין חלין כדת משה וישראל, שהנהיגו חכמי ישראל, והרי הם אמרו\n  .שיפקיעו כל קדושין שבישראל על ידי גט כזה, הילכך פקעי, שעל מנת כן קידשה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi does mention גט כזה, but only because that גמרא is dealing with a גט that was sent with the husband's will, but he then got three people together and declared it null in front of them (see משנה to that גמרא).  In theory, a גט would not be required for the רבנן to nullify a marriage.</p>\n\n<p>There is a major difference between the כריתות that occurs as a result of a גט and as a result of the רבנן's decision that the couple should be seperated.  Although both methods of seperation allow the woman to get remarried to somebody else after three months, the retroactive nullification of the marriage would mean that the couple was living in sin for the entire duration of their supposed marriage.  That's obviously not something we want to do, so the רבנן would much rather subdue the husband's יצר הרע enough that he gives a גט voluntarily.</p>\n\n\n",

While there are different opinions how many lines a Sefer Torah should be (See Keses Hasofer 13:6), this has not developed solwly out of Halacha.</p>\n<p>There's a good article about how this came to be <a href=\"http://lavlor.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/how-many-lines-should-my-torah-scroll.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Until some 30 years ago, Sofrim didn't really have a good tikkun to copy from. They either used Chumashim, old codices like the Berdichev Codice or another Sefer Torah, until the renowed Sofer Davidovich took on himself to write a Tikkun for others to copy from, arranging all the Torah in Amudim of 42 lines. Now that's the important piece of information - 42 lines. In this arrangement, Davidovich's tikkun had 245 columns (\"amudim\"), and after some feedback from fellow Sofrim, who said that the lines where too \"cramped\", Davidovich made a longer, spaced up version of 247 Amudim...</p>\n<p>From then on, the 42-lined Tikkun became the standard tikkun all Sofrim used. For that reason, I understood why the Tikkun of 45cm I purchased from my tutor was also made for a 42 lines tikkun - this is virtually the case in all modern Sefer Torahs you will see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There are two factors determining the start of columns in sifrei torah:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Halacha requires that certain words be at the top of the column. The acronym for these words is בי\"ה שמו, the mem of which is מה טובו as you noted.  </li>\n<li>Despite the best efforts of earlier poskim including Keset Hasofer, it is traditional for all other columns to begin with the letter vav (this practice is called ווי העמודים). This is so common with modern (post war) sifrei torah that people have asked me if sefarim without it are kosher.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The two standard tikkunim today were both produced by a Rabbi Menachem Davidovich of Jerusalem. In a way he is the preeminent sofer, having practically standardized not only the tikkun but many stylistic details in the script. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The practical part:</strong><br>\nYes, you can salvage a sheet from one pasul sefer in order to repair another and if both have been written within the last 30+ years they are probably standardized to one of two tikkunim. The easiest way to figure out which one your sifrei torah were copied from is to count sheets. A 245 column sefer will usually have 62 yeriot (sheets) while the longer one will have 63. I would guess that the \"bar mitzvah torah\" is 248 columns long because most tikkunei korim are for that layout.<br>\nI would not recommend doing it yourself because sewing parchment can be surprisingly difficult. You may also run into problems because sofrim sometimes end a word or two sooner than the tikkun calls for.</p>\n\n\n",

Does he carefully space the letters do that it is easy to read? I noticed some sofrim love to stretch out some letters. Some do it often; others rarely do this. (I will probably post a separate question on this custom.) Some make wide columns; others narrower.</p>\n\n<p>I have listed just a few examples.

In that sense the sofer does not have to worry about usability because halacha and minhag do the worrying for him. He only has to worry about halacha :)  </p>\n\n<p>Stretching letters is not a matter of custom, but one of practicality. Halacha requires the columns be justified. Microsoft Word handles justifies text by widening spaces between words and letters. You can't do this in a sefer torah, so the sofer stretches letters instead. Good tikkunim minimize the number of \"short\" lines that require stretched letters, and good sofrim regulate their ksav so that the stretching is less noticeable. While some people (myself among them) think that stretched letters add something aesthetic to the calligraphy, Halacha considers stretched and cramped writing a lower quality ksav.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, as a bal kriah I do think about making other baalei kriahs' lives easier when I write but I have only ever written one scroll for a shul and it wasn't a sefer torah.</p>\n\n\n",

Why? For the cattle of course!\n  That is what the note tells us. From the beginning the Israelites had\n  cattle.  Pharaoh’s words after the tenth plague, when he finally\n  agrees to let the people go are ‘Take your flocks and your herds and\n  be gone.’ (Exodus 12:32)  ‘And they went – and a mixed multitude with\n  them, and flocks and herds and very many cattle.

    "content": "# Saying \"thank you\" before taking a bite\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The halacha as codified by Shulchan Aruch O.C. 167:6 is that if one interrupts between making Hamotzi and eating the bread, as long as the interruption is related to the meal (not just to eating the bread - see Beis Yosef 167:6 and Magen Avraham) it does not require the person to repeat their blessing.</p>\n\n<p>If one of the people listening to Hamotzi, who has the same rules of interruption according to the Shulchan Aruch, says \"thank you\" when they are given their slice of bread before they take a bite, does this constitute an unrelated interruption, or can this display of manners be considered related to the meal?</p>\n\n<p>Examples of what is related to the meal, as given by the Beis Yosef, are such things as saying to pass around the food (not just the bread) and telling someone to feed the animals.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think the Magen Avraham understands that one is permitted to make a interruption to facilitate the beginning of the meal. So just like the leader can't start eating until he has clarified if his animals have eaten yet and the lack of that knowledge prevents him from starting to eat, so to the Magen Avram allows you to request that food be served to a person (even if he is not eating bread) since that person can not start eating until he has food.</p>\n\n<p>Saying please and thank you is an expression of gratitude/hakarat hatov. However lack of expressing that does not prevent one from eating since the same could be accomplished by saying thank you after the first bite and neither is there a halacha that says \"you are forbidden to eat until you say thanks to the one who passed you the food\" So even according to the Magen Avram it would be forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>However the Mishne Brurah learns (based on the Bach**) that the case the Mechaber is talking about is where everyone has washed and the request being made is to pass <em>bread</em> to someone who wants to make his <em>own</em> bracha and not a request to pass him food so he can start eating.** If this is the intent of the Mechaber then there seems to be no reason to think that based on this one would be allowed to say thank you.</p>\n\n<p>** IMHO It could be that the Mishna Brurah also felt that the Magen Avram's p'sak was unclear and therefore chose to learn like the Bach</p>\n\n<p>Source</p>\n\n<p>SA OC 167:6 MB 39</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It would seem to be that the example of the mechaber is only in regards to thing that facilitate the eating of the food, IE. One cannot eat before he feeds his animals or to pass the food (Mesechtas Berochos 40a. The Gemorah in Mesechtas Gittin 62 says it is forbidden to “taste.”) Although you point out correctly that an interruption which is not specific to the eating of the bread is not problematic, nevertheless it should only be in regards to the eating of the food in general. Therefore, according to this logic, thank you ;which although is a well mannered thing to do, is only a nicety and not considered inherently a facilitatory action vis-a- vis the food.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Shva na after meteg on short vowel\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When a long vowel has a meteg, there is a difference of opinion if the shva after it is na or nach. What about a short vowel with a meteg? Is it vayihi chen or vayhi chen? Is it tihiyeh or tihyeh? Is it vihiyitem or vihyitem? These words often sound more like a shva na, but the siddurim tend to have them as nach.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The opinion of the <em>Minchat Shai</em> (and most commentators, from what I can tell), is that a <em>meteg</em> on a short vowel in a closed syllable is almost always a euphonic <em>meteg</em> (there for stress or to stop you from swallowing a syllable, but not for the vowel quality), and thus does not affect the following <em>shva</em>.  See also Geoffrey Khan's <em>The Tiberian Pronunciation of Biblical Hebrew</em> and <em>The Pronunciation of the Verbs היה and חיה in the Tiberian Tradition of Biblical Hebrew</em>.</p>\n<p>There are two exceptions.  Firstly, following a definite article prefix (הַ, בַּ, כַּ, לַ), we expect a <em>dagesh chazak</em>.  In its absence, we often find a <em>meteg</em> with the <em>patach</em> to indicate that the <em>schva</em> should be <em>na</em> (eg. במסלה in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.20.19?lang=bi&with=Minchat%20Shai&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 20:19</a>).  However, all other instances of <em>patach</em> with a <em>meteg</em> are short, and don't induce a following <em>shva na</em>.  For example, in וידברו (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.34.20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 34:20</a>) and ויהי־אור (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 1:3</a>), the <em>shva</em> on the <em>yod</em> is <em>nach</em>.</p>\n<p>The second exception is not so much an exception, but a clarification that the vowel that looks short is actually long (<em>ie.</em> <em>chirik</em> missing its following <em>yod</em> or <em>kubbuts</em> instead of <em>shuruk</em>).  For example, ויראו in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.4.14?lang=bi&with=Minchat%20Shai&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Joshua 4:14</a> means <em>they feared</em>, not <em>they saw</em>, because of the <em>meteg</em> under the <em>yod</em>.  However, the <em>Minchat Shai</em> explicitly says that יהיה, יחיה, להיות, לחיות all have <em>shva nach</em>.  For להיות and יהיה and similar, my <em>tikkun</em> says to pronounce the ה as if there were a <em>mappik</em>, and that the <em>shva</em> is <em>nach</em>.</p>\n<p>The only explicit dissenting opinion that I'm aware of is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Greenwald\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">author</a> of <em>Arugat HaBosem</em>, who thinks that the <em>meteg</em> will lengthen the <em>chirik</em> in the verbs היה and חיה (and I imagine in all cases, but he's only quoted in this context).  Jacobson's <em>Chanting the Hebrew Bible</em> also says that \"some grammarians disagree with [the <em>Minchat Shai</em>]\", but no further details are given.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>With regard to \" tihiyeh or tihyeh\", a klal (rule) that I have heard is that a sh'va can NEVER be sounded when it appears under the following guttural letters;\nאהעח</p>\n\n\n",

However, the Alter Rebbe of Lubavitch <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/piskey/7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> in the siddur that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל אשר נגע יראת אלהים בלבו יניח תפילין דרבינו תם בלא ברכה אחר התפלה בביתו וללמוד בהם שעה אחת אם חושש להניחן בבית המדרש מפני היוהרא או מפני שנוח לו יותר ללמוד בביתו</p>\n<p>Anyone who's fear of G-d touches his heart should put on the Tefillin of Rabbeinu Tam without a Bracha after davening in his house and learn in them for an hour if he is concerned about putting them on in shul because of haughtiness or because it is more comfortable for him to learn in his house.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The most recent Lubavitcher Rebbe established in 1976 that this should begin at Bar Mitzvah, and encouraged everyone to do it. You can see the point summarized <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/essays/45.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But, comes the protest, in the previous generation there were many truly G-d-fearing Rabbis and Yeshivah heads who did not put on two pair of tefillin. Why should we be different? We must recognize, however, that their circumstances were very different from our own. Life was a continuous struggle, to eke out the most meager of existences a task of the greatest difficulty. A pair of good tefillin was very expensive, and it was literally impossible to find enough money to buy a second pair of tefillin (Rabbeinu Tam). Hence, their inability to buy and put on Rabbeinu Tam tefillin did not indicate any deficiency in their fear of G-d. Rather, they labored mightily just to find a valid reason to justify the fact that they could not put on Rabbeinu Tam tefillin. But had they had the means, they most certainly would have.</p>\n<p>Today, however, we have no such excuse. Think of all the luxuries we take for granted, all the indulgences we so frivolously waste money on. May we suggest foregoing the latest-model car and using the money saved to buy Rabbeinu Tam tefillin? No one need deprive himself of any necessities in order to buy a pair of Rabbeinu Tam tefillin. It is but a small price to pay to fulfill the dictates of the Shulchan Aruch and be a \"G-d-fearing\" person.</p>\n<p>And let no one piously object with the claim that he does not wish to differ from the customs of his forebears who were unable to put on Rabbeinu Tam tefillin. Do such people so zealously follow all the practices and customs of their forefathers? Their ancestors did not waste precious time and resources on such things as reading newspapers and other trivialities. Why is it only when it comes to excusing oneself from doing good things, such as putting on Rabbeinu Tam tefillin, that such zealots suddenly awaken with their pious claims of following in their forebears’ footsteps?

Technically any garment of four corners can be used as a prayer shawl, so long as it has the tzitziyot on them. As for a non-Jew wearing tzitzit, there is nothing offensive or wrong with your wearing tzitzit so long as you are aware that you do so on a voluntary basis and are not obligated to do so in any way. <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e510.htm#11\">Rambam, Hilchot Melachim uMilchamot 10:11</a> states that a non-Jew is permitted to perform most mitzvos for the purpose of receiving reward.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Considering the wording of the Mitzvah @ Deut. 22:12 \"You shall make yourself twisted threads, on the four corners of your garment with which you cover yourself\", it appears to imply that there was an already pre-existing garment, which was typical of the era, that did not have tassels or otherwise attached in any form.  I think this may suggest that though it is a meritorious commandment to attach Tzitzit as a Jew, a Noachide could achieve some merit from covering himself ritualistically in a shawl, whether it be a Tallit with the Tzitzit removed (such as myself), or your grannies best knitting!</p>\n\n\n",

If the original sample of meat was taken from a living animal, then it is possible that the meat is considered as if the original source was still alive. The question would also involve if the meat is treated as if it is still \"alive\". If it is, then how can it be \"slaughtered\". A second question is if the original source was dead, then was it first slaughtered properly and does that status carry over into the new \"meat\" that has been grown.

Most authorities, following the rule of Rabbi Shabtai Meir\n  HaCohen, state that in situations where Jewish law precludes the\n  finder from taking title and the law states that the \"the object\n  should reside until Elijah comes,\" that phrase is properly understood\n  to mean \"the object should reside in the finder's pocket until Elijah\n  comes\" - while the user has no ownership rights to the object, it is\n  his to use and derive benefit. Should the finder break it or wear it\n  out, he owes the owner the value of the object, if the owner comes\n  forward and claim it. This seems to be the approach of most\n  decisors. Other Jewish law authorities disagree, and rule that in\n  situations where the owner does not come forward, the object resides\n  in peace, without anyone authorized to use it for his own benefit.\n  According to neither of these schools of thought may the possessor\n  (who is not the true owner) legally transmit valid title to another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have excerpted what I thought was the most relevant paragraph to your question.

Ownership does not oblige you to live on your property. (That is how Israel \"owns\" land East of Jordan and in South Lebanon because they are the <strong>inheritance</strong> of Israel even though no Jew lives there or claims his property - yet...) </p>\n\n<p>Two, in order to have property according to the division of the Land among the tribes, all Jews must be present to claim their property and each one must know to which tribe he belongs. This will be the task of the Minister of Interior of King Meshiah, as Rambam writes in Laws of Kings and Wars Ch. XII: \nבימי המלך המשיח, כשתתיישב מלכותו <strong>ויתקבצו אליו כל ישראל</strong> יתייחסו כולם על פיו ברוח הקודש שתנוח עליו... הנה למדת שברוח הקודש מתייחסין המוחזקין ומודיעין המיוחס. <strong>ואינו מיחס ישראל אלא לשבטיהם</strong></p>\n\n<p>Three, Yehoshua divided the Land by drawing lots although each tribe knew which part of the Land is his. By inference, we are entitled to imagine that when Meshiach will relate each Jew to his tribe, we will find out that he already lives on his part of the Land... in the meantime, the task of the State of Israel is to prepare the way for Meshiah. בקרוב בימינו.                 </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In the Navi Yechezkel (ch. 48, vv. 23-28), the aportionment of land is discussed.  At a very basic level, it seems that the land will be redivided, and people have to determine which tribe they're from.  Owning an apartment in Eretz Yisrael, while virtuous, doesn't necessarily mean you actually own physical land.  The owner of the apartment <em>block</em> may own the land, but according to many statutues in Eretz Yisrael, the land itself might be owned by the government, and it leased to the owners of the block.  In this sense, you're a 'renter'.  This government really owns the land, so the apartment 'owner' simply owns the rights to use that space as the government allows.  When Moshiach comes this will become irrelevant, and I assume all Jews will be given their allotted portion, depending on the tribe they belong.  So you might own a 2-bedroom in Jerusalem, but the reality is that Hashem wants you to have a plot of land in Netanya.  You might own nothing, and you live in Brooklyn as a renter, and Hashem has a plot in Jerusalem set aside for your family.</p>\n\n<p>As regards actually owned property, that you have the title deeds for, or you have a chazaka on the land (3 years), assumes that you have a valid claim of ownership (Rashi on Bava Basra, Chezkas Habatim, 3rd Perek).  However, it could very well be that Moshiach will simply aportion land up differently based on Navua (It is an interesting question:  Reuven has a chazaka and Shimon has a message from the urim v'tumim that it belongs to Shimon.  However, if everyone is receiving a new portion then it seems that any prior ownership will become irrelevant (that is the implication of Yechezkel).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Great question.\nThis is a multi faceted question, the crux of it is, are current land deeds valid in a torah-run state, i.e. after mashiach comes.\nThe simplest answer is no. The torah (Deut. 26) clearly outlines how the Land must be divided (by tribes and families), and the current land deeds are not sales from original owners but rather legal deeds issued by the State of Israel, which has no power that I know of, to override a biblical command.\nThe challenge, however, is how to go about splitting up the land. The basic idea is clear in the Torah and the Talmud - meaning the general outline of each tribe. Elijah and Mashiach should be capable of figuring out the rest...\nCurrent land owners in Israel, though, should be able to get repaid for any investment they put in to improve their property (for the time being they do have ownership of the property).\nOne more point I would make, is to speculate that this will not be an over - night process; even in Yehoshua's time (the first time around) it took 7 years to work it all out. Also many deals will probably be struck to maintain the comfort of the most people possible. (expect to hear a lot of \"tikun haolam\".)\nMay hashem help this important question become relevant in no time.</p>\n\n\n",

The tribals leaders realized that if they married outside the tribe, then the land that the women inhertited would become part of their husbands' tribes (when their children inherited it). As a result, they asked the question and Moshe stated that in the future, women in this situation would be required to marry within the tribe. The daughters of Telaphchad <strong>voluntarily</strong> married not just within the tribe but within the family.

The Chochmas Shlomo writes in his gloss on Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat siman 369 \"a king who rules the entire world is not applicable the laws of dinei dimalchusa, for how can he say that he doesn't want to live in his land, all the lands are his! Should he fly in the air?\" \nWe find that the need to listen to king is based on the fact that a person chooses to live in the kings land. By living there he is accepting the king's laws. \nSeemingly living under a tyrant who doesn't allow one to leave would also be a ptur from these dinim. Also when the King of Kings 'gives' you a land to live in, the king of flesh and blood can no longer say 'my way or the highway'. This should apply to leviim and kohanim too. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Leviim are just as much owners of the land as any other tribe. The cities of the Leviim were apportioned to them by lottery in the same way as the rest of the land (see Malbim Yehoshua 21:2) and they were complete owners. However, you may be right in thinking that their ownership might be different in this regard. The Gemara tells us that ארץ ישראל מוחזקת היא מאבותנו and a firstborn got double portion from the land (see Bava Basra 119b). Thus, one could say that initially the land was the property of the entire nation, but God removed the ownership rights of the Leviim until after the division of the land. Thus, the Leviim were not among 'original partners' in the land like the rest of the nation, and might be considered like citizens of other countries, whose king allows them to live there.</p>\n\n<p>However, when the Ran (as well as his source, Shut Baalei HaTosfos no. 12), says that a king cannot force laws upon Jewish citizens of Israel, his actual reasoning is because the king doesn't own the land and therefore cannot evict his subjects and has nothing to do with partnership. This is (I believe) clear from context. Therefore, when the Ran says that 'all of Yisrael are partners in the land', he doesn't mean that they are literally partners, or that a 'partnership' is a necessary part of being excluded from a king's edicts. He just means to say that it is <em>not</em> owned by the king. (In Yeshiva-speak: \"I'm saying that the Ran is <em>lav davka</em>, and it's clear from the context that he's <em>lav davka</em>\"). </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, even if the initial 'partnership' was necessary for the Jews to be exempt from governmental edicts, that's only because their ownership (as partners) preceded that of a kings. This is equally true of the Leviim as well, because despite not having an actual ownership in the land (במוחזק) the people of Israel - king included - are obligated to give up some land for the Leviim (like a tithe, see Malbim Yehoshua 13:33). Thus, the king has no right to evict the Leviim any more than a Jew from another tribe.</p>\n\n\n",

And i quote \"However, a woman wearing one would have such a denigrating effect, because the Rabbis are all wearing one.\" It seemed like you were still quoting the Ramma. In fact the Ramma gives no explanation. I will send you to another Ramma which can be used to either answer or strengthen your question, but definitely prove your explanation wrong. See in siman 235 siff 1. When someone finds himself at an early maariv minyan and davens during the day, says the Ramma \"however don't repeat prayers again at night, even if the tzibor davened much in advance of night, unless he is accustomed in other 'prishus and chassidus', for then it won't appear as yuhara.\" \nIt seems yuhara is applicable even in the privacy of one's own home and appears to be a personalized limit of what a person may or may not due so as not 'feel' the yuhara in his, or her, own heart.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Extended fasting on 10 Av",
    "content": "# Extended fasting on 10 Av\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Bavli (Taanit 29a) teaches that the Temple was set aflame on the ninth of Av in the afternoon and it burnt until sundown on the tenth of Av. The Yerushalmi (Taanit 4:6) records that because of this certain Amoraim would fast supererogatorily on the tenth of Av as well as the ninth, while others would fast only for the night of the tenth. (This is the source for the common custom of extending some of the customs of mourning from the Nine Days onto the tenth of Av (OC 558).) The Magen Avraham (ibid. sk 3) records an additional practice of fasting only until noon on the tenth of Av. This fasting is Halakhicly connected to Tisha bAv (and not just a conveniently-timed ordinary vow of asceticism) as seen from the ruling of Magen Avraham (OC 557:0) and Arukh HaShuchan (ibid. :3) that one fasting on the tenth of Av recites Nacheim in his prayers.</p>\n\n<p>I have the following questions about these supererogatory fasts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Do they require acceptance at Mincha beforehand like regular personal fasts (OC 562:5)? If so, must the acceptance be made at Mincha on Erev Tisha bAv or on Tisha bAv itself?</p></li>\n<li><p>What time intervals may they occupy? The Talmud recorded ~12 and ~24 hour additions, and the Magen Avraham recorded an ~18 hour addition. Can one accept to fast until midnight on the 10 Av (a ~6 hour addition)? Can one accept to fast for only the first hour of 10 Av?</p></li>\n<li><p>At which prayers would Aneinu be said?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Ashkenazim generally recite Aneinu only at the last prayer on a fast day (generally Mincha) (OC 565:3). When fasting multiple consecutive days, Aneinu is said at the last prayer of each day (Terumat HaDeshen 180, Rama OC 562:7) since we take each day as a unit. How does this rule apply in our case: is Aneinu recited only at Mincha on 9 Av? At Mincha on 9 Av and the last prayer during the fast of 10 Av (whichever prayer that may be)? At Mincha on 9 Av and all subsequent prayers of the fast? At no prayer other than the last prayer during the fast of 10 Av (whichever prayer that may be)?</p></li>\n<li><p>Sefardim generally follow the Ashkenazi position only on personal fasts, but on public fasts they recite Aneinu whenever fasting (OC 565:3). How does that play out in this case? Do these fasts have the status of decreed fasts as an extension of Tisha bAv, or are they separate unique personal fasts?</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramban (Torat ha-Adam) cites this as follows:</p>\n\n<p>ר' יהושע בן לוי הוה ציים תשיעי ועשירי, ר' לוי הוה ציים תשיעי ועשירי, פי' מנהג חסידות היה להם, וכל המוסיף להתאבל על ירושלים זכות היא לו</p>\n\n<p>This implies that the extra fast is a meritorious act of piety but not an actual extension of Tisha b' Av, even for those who maintain it. The Magen Avraham's ruling regarding Nachem does not indicate otherwise; the source of the ruling, the Shelah, explains that one may recite Nachem any day of the year. Poskim likewise maintain that Aneinu should not be said even if there are ten fasting. </p>\n\n<p>The basis for Ramban's view may be the fact that R. Levi fasted only the night of the tenth. Halachah does not recognize a fast which does not extend until the end of the day. See Ta'anit 12a: ואמר רב חסדא כל תענית שלא שקעה עליו חמה לאו שמיה תענית. מיתיבי אנשי משמר מתענין ולא משלימין <strong>התם לצעורי נפשיה בעלמא</strong> הוא.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, if R. Levi nevertheless fasted only the night of the tenth, it must too have been only an act of \"צעורי נפשיה\" for the destruction of the Temple, but not an actual fast. It would thus seem that for this \"superogatory\" fast to have the status of a fast it would need to be accepted at mincha on the previous day; if however the fast will not be completed, there would be no acceptance. </p>\n\n\n",

I recommend a similar approach here: the one who cares about kashrut should do or oversee all the shopping, cooking, and cleaning in the kitchen, and the one who doesn't care should eat out sometimes to \"get his fix\" of bacon cheeseburgers etc.  This may mean eating separately sometimes.  If you had a completely separate kitchen that could work, but that's pretty uncommon and you still have to be careful that utensils, serving dishes, etc don't migrate.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a word of caution: kashrut is unlikely to be the only source of conflict in a mixed marriage.

If the Jews (some? were all Jews living in Shushan and its provinces then, in the same way that ALL Jews were at Sinai -- the point the Braita started with) rose up and ratified their Sinaitic behavior during the megilla then they were accepting the things that came up between matan torah and that moment.

    "content": "# Halachically, is one person ever bound by the intent of another?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In masechet shevuot, 41b, the gemara discusses a case of a loan as follows (h/t dafyomi.co.il)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Levi lent Yehudah, and told him 'repay me in front of two witnesses\n  who learn Halachah. Yehudah paid without witnesses, and the money was\n  lost through Ones. They came in front of Rav Nachman.</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Levi: I stipulated that the repayment must be in front of witnesses who learn Halachah. I took the money for a deposit until we would find\n  such witnesses.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Rav Nachman: He gave the money for payment, and you accepted it without objection (this shows that you pardoned your stipulation);</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>i.    If you want, fulfill your stipulation now in front of Rav Sheshes\n  and myself. We learn Halachah! (This was a joke.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Rashi, when Levi accepted money from Yehudah and there were no witnesses present, he had the intent that the money was NOT a repayment, but a separate loan from Yehudah for which he was now a shomer chinam. When it gets lost, Levi is not responsible and, because the original loan was not paid back, Levi is still owed the original sum.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi points out that \"devarim shehayu belibecha einam devarim\" [things that were in your (Levi's) heart are not things].</p>\n\n<p>Isn't that obvious? Yehudah never specified this payment as a loan. Levi never said he was accepting it as a loan and not repayment. Levi never said to Yehudah that he would guard the money.</p>\n\n<p>All of this was only going on in the mind of Levi. What was his hava amina that this is a valid way to think and bind Yehudah to his understanding? The gemara's flip answer (and Rashi's dismissal of the question through a clear tenet) indicate to me that this was a non-starter question, so why does the gemara even list it? Shouldn't a question presented in the text have an presumption of reasonableness?</p>\n\n<p>Or is there a potential for Levi's thought process to be binding on Yehudah? Is there halachic precedent for the intent of one party to impose itself on the reality of another? In terms of shevuot, the rabbis prevent this by saying explicitly that the conditions of an oath taking are not the internal ones the oath taker might have (as in the case of Rava's cane and others, on <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/shevuos/points/sv-ps-029.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">29a</a>) but had they not made this explicit, is there a halachic construct allowing Yehudah's action of repayment to be considered something else by Levi and have Levi's thinking be determinant?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What's the point of Jeremiah 13:18–27?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1113.htm#18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jeremiah 13:18–27</a>, Jeremiah is told to address the king and queen, telling them of the trouble that will come (using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophetic_perfect_tense\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the prophetic past</a>). Unlike many of the preceding chapters, where he tells the Jews to repent of their wrongdoing and change their ways, he here says that they cannot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הֲיַהֲפֹךְ כּוּשִׁי עוֹרוֹ וְנָמֵר חֲבַרְבֻּרֹתָיו גַּם אַתֶּם תּוּכְלוּ לְהֵיטִיב לִמֻּדֵי הָרֵעַ.‏</p>\n<p>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. (JPS)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>M'tzudas David</em> explains this as an exaggeration: it would be difficult, but not literally impossible, for the sinners to change their ways. But I'm asking according to view that it would be impossible: <em>Radak</em> explains \"the evil won't be able to turn from you, as if it is natural in you\"; <em>Mahari Kara</em> says \"it is impossible for you that you'll be able to do good\".</p>\n<p>What purpose did this prophecy serve?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the prophecy was true — it would be impossible to repent — then why the prophecy at all? What's the point of telling people they can't repent?</li>\n<li>And if it was false, then (besides the philosophical difficulty in the existence of a false prophecy, which I <em>don't</em> want to get into) how would relaying this (false) prophecy urge the people to repent? Surely if they heard \"you can't repent\", they wouldn't!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The words <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.13.18?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jeremiah 13:18-27</a> are spoken in the context of the upcoming exile as he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַאֲפִיצֵ֖ם כְּקַשׁ־עוֹבֵ֑ר לְר֖וּחַ מִדְבָּֽר׃ זֶ֣ה גוֹרָלֵ֧ךְ מְנָת־מִדַּ֛יִךְ מֵאִתִּ֖י נְאֻם־יְהֹוָ֑ה אֲשֶׁר֙ שָׁכַ֣חַתְּ אוֹתִ֔י וַֽתִּבְטְחִ֖י בַּשָּֽׁקֶר׃</p>\n<p>So I will scatter you (Heb. “them.”) like straw that flies\nBefore the desert wind. This shall be your lot, Your measured portion from Me\n—declares  GOD. Because you forgot Me And trusted in falsehood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This prophecy needs to be viewed against the words of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.2.1?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jeremiah 2</a> (the haftora Masei), especially <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.2.13?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:13</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּֽי־שְׁתַּ֥יִם רָע֖וֹת עָשָׂ֣ה עַמִּ֑י אֹתִ֨י עָזְב֜וּ מְק֣וֹר ׀ מַ֣יִם חַיִּ֗ים לַחְצֹ֤ב לָהֶם֙ בֹּאר֔וֹת בֹּארֹת֙ נִשְׁבָּרִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹֽא־יָכִ֖לוּ הַמָּֽיִם׃</p>\n<p>For My people have done a two-fold wrong: They have forsaken Me, the Fount of living waters, And hewed out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns,\nThat cannot even hold water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While many commentaries here follow <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.2.13?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>two evils Had they exchanged their Deity [lit. their fear] for one His equal, it would be one evil, and now that they have forsaken Me, that I am a spring of living waters, to follow idols, which are like cisterns of stored up water, and they are broken and cracked, and their water is absorbed in their cracks, these are two evils.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is possible to take these words directly, as I heard from mussar shiurim. That is even if we accept the inevitability of the exile (as the OP notes in his question), Jeremiah is hinting to Jewish people to learn to dig cisterns in the desert, which will be necessary during the travel to collect water for people to drink during travels. Or, more importantly, prepare their Torah, which will be required to be learned and be carried under very different conditions of the exile. As of now, Jeremiah says that the cisterns made by the Jews were full of cracks, which certainly requires additional teshuvah and preparation.</p>\n\n\n",

This includes Shabbos meals, a bris seuda, a pidyon haben, or a siyum.</p>\n<p>The Aruch Hashulchan (551:28) strongly disapproved of postponing one’s siyum to coincide with the nine days in order to eat meat, though writes that if one was learning something (extra) and planning on making the siyum then, that is commendable (See Mishna Berura 551:28). The Lubavitcher Rebbe encouraged people to specifically make a siyum during this time, saying it would add light to this dark period (though his minhag was not to eat meat then). Other poskim write that one should avoid making a siyum afer the 6th of Av (See Moadei Yeshurun p132).</p>\n<p>The Mishna Berura (551:75) writes that anyone who would normally be invited to one’s siyum may participate and eat meat, too, though one shouldn’t invite extra people.\nWhile some poskim hold that only one who was present for the learning and siyum may partake of the meal, the consensus of poskim (Minchas Yitzchak 9:45; Rivevos Ephraim 3:343; Teshuvos Vehanhagos 1:300) is that one who came late mat still join in and eat meat (See Mishna Berura 470:10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Moshe responds that they are correct, and the daughters of Zlophchad may not (or perhaps should not - Bava Basra) marry out of the Tribe (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9964\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bamidbar 36:1-6</a>).</p>\n\n<p>As far as I am aware, no mention is made of the righteousness of the men of Menashe for their attachment to the land.  How come they are never praised for their desire to the land?</p>\n\n<p>This question is exacerbated by the fact that the aforementioned Sifrei deduces that the daughters of Zlophchad love the Land of Israel from the fact that they are traced back to Yosef, who loved Israel.

So Zlophchad died before the decree of the 40 years.  And yet his daughters waited until right before they were to enter the Land to make their request.  This showed that they weren't interested in being heirs until it was relevant to inheriting a portion in the Land.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, it could be simply that by the rest of the family there is no such indication - there was nothing about their counterclaim which indicated a special interest in the Land over an interest in just having more property.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>You will find that the daughters of Tzelophchad were of one of the Machirite families of Menashe.

I am going through a lot in life right now, however, I am considering conversion once things settle down a bit. I want to convert because Judaism holds many values such as ethical monotheism, charity, consistency, and community and is culturally similar in some ways to my own background (North Indian/Kashmiri). </p>\n\n<p>I do have some reason to believe that it is possible that I have some distant Jewish roots from the Iraqi or Persian Jews or possibly other tribes that came into the areas my known ancestors are from, however, my basis for conversion to Judaism would lie in the fact that it is the religion that speaks to me the most and that being a Noahide leaves you a little bit lost and without identity/spiritual guidance. My parents are really supportive and despite everything happening I think they would definitely encourage me to do this if it is what I want. </p>\n\n<p>I would like some opinions/answers on the following questions if anyone has the time:</p>\n\n<p>Would this limit me to only marrying someone who is also Jewish (I don't have any issues with it at all but I am only 18 and still have college so it's just a lot to think about now)?</p>\n\n<p>Would people question or look at me differently because I am a convert (I could pass off as Persian mixed with some European)?</p>\n\n<p>Does it make sense to convert if many of the prayers have to do with ancestry, when it is currently understood that I do not have any Jewish ancestry?</p>\n\n<p>Would I still be able to live life like I usually do and have religion be something I can adhere to and devote time to daily, without having to isolate or limit myself to the Jewish community (I want to be balanced and still be able to go out and do things with friends and family and have a somewhat flexible schedule much like the average American Christian barring Shabbat restrictions)?</p>\n\n<p>I would like to spend time/live/or possibly study in Israel, will being a Reform convert affect any of that (From what I understand the Orthodox movement would not consider me to be properly Jewish)?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading and hopefully giving your honest opinions/answers on this important aspect of my life, I wish you the best!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>This is a pretty broad question.  If you want to drill into any of these issues I recommend splitting off a separate question about just that topic.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Would this limit me to only marrying someone who is also Jewish?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to <em>halacha</em> (Jewish law), we are to marry other Jews and marriages with non-Jews are not recognized as valid.  Intermarried couples nonetheless tend to be welcomed in Reform (and other liberal) communities, on the reasoning that it's better to keep channels open with the Jew than to exclude him (particularly if that Jew might produce children later).</p>\n\n<p>However, as a convert you will be held to a higher standard: are you <em>really</em> throwing your lot with the Jewish people if you reject such a fundamental requirement?  The rabbi you study with and the <em>beit din</em> (rabbinic court) that oversees your conversion might require you to pledge to marry Jewish.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Would people question or look at me differently because I am a convert </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Probably not.  First, we're not supposed to ask, and second, if people <em>do</em> know, within the Reform community their reaction is likely to be positive, not negative.  I've seen a lot of converts in the ~15 years I've been part of my Reform congregation, and the reaction is, nearly universally, one of welcoming and happiness that the person finds value in Judaism.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Does it make sense to convert if many of the prayers have to do with ancestry, when it is currently understood that I do not have any Jewish ancestry?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, a.k.a. Maimonides) addresses your question (citation needed).  A convert is the adopted child of Avraham and Sarah, fully part of the Jewish people, and even if you don't share bloodlines you now share lineage.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Would I still be able to live life like I usually do and have religion be something I can adhere to and devote time to daily, without having to isolate or limit myself to the Jewish community? ( I want to be balanced and still be able to go out and do things with friends and family and have a somewhat flexible schedule much like the average American christian barring Shabbat restrictions)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you're asking \"do I have to go live in a shtetl or study in yeshiva full-time and never see my friends\", no.  Jews, and liberal Jews in particular, live in the world, not separate from it.  (The Chareidim you may read about are the exception, not the rule.)  But you should convert with the intention of being a full-time Jew, with all that it entails -- Shabbat, holidays, how and what you eat, prayer, and more.  You should expect your rabbi and the beit din to ask you about this, and they will also expect you to start living as a Jew before you convert.  As above, the precise requirements of any given rabbi or beit din are beyond the scope of this answer.  Talk with them.  Conversion requires study over an extended period; you will have many conversations about matters like these with your rabbi.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I would like to spend time/live/ or possibly study in Israel, will being a reform convert affect any of that? (From what I understand the Orthodox movement would not consider me to be properly Jewish?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Orthodox movement will not consider you to be Jewish, nor will the Israeli rabbinate.  This will carry some restrictions on you.  You can still visit or live in Israel, and there are Reform communities there.  You can also study at cross-denominational institutes like Pardes and Shalom Hartman.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><strong>Quick Note: I am a Jew of Orthodox affiliation. I will try to steer clear of stating my own thoughts, ideas, etc. I will, however, tell you where Orthodox and Reform Judaism diverge on various issues.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I advise you to look through all of your options before undertaking such a large lifestyle change. Conversion to Judaism is more than just changing your belief, it's about changing your entire lifestyle. I understand your current \"spiritual boredom\", so to speak, with being a Noahide, but I encourage you to explore ways to \"spice up\" your spiritual life. Talk to a rabbi about your issues. Explore all of your options. Think many times before you leap. </p>\n\n<p>Reform Judaism differs from Orthodox Judaism in many ways, but one of those ways is that Reform Judaism allows its followers much, much more room when it comes to living the life they want. In all actuality, Reform Judaism basically lacks any physical restrictions. Whereas an Orthodox Jew cannot eat a ham sandwich, marry a non-Jew, or drive on the Sabbath, for a Reform Jew any restriction is up to the individual to apply to himself. </p>\n\n<p>Intermarriage is strictly forbidden in traditional Judaism, and in years past it was only \"frowned upon\" in Reform circles, but in recent years interfaith marriages have been tolerated, and even completely accepted in Reform communities. It is not uncommon for a Reform rabbi to administer an interfaith marriage. </p>\n\n<p>Yes, of course you can still \"live life\" with religion. Orthodox Judaism does forbid many things, but ask any Orthodox Jew and he'll tell you that he definitely has a life. Judaism is more of a way of life than a \"religion\", in the sense that it has more to do with your everyday routine than a slogan on a bumber sticker. To a Jew, lip service is only half of the equation. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, there are things which one is forbidden to do, and it gets stricter the more traditional you go. However, in Reform Judaism you can basically do whatever you want with no consequences, though what is considered moral, upright, etc. varies on the community. </p>\n\n<p>So yes, you can still watch movies, read novels, go places with friends, and, in Reform Judaism, eat whatever you please. </p>\n\n<p>I don't have much experience with the State of Israel, but being a Reform convert could cause complications in your studying abroad, though I'm not certain. In all honesty, even though there are Reform communities in Israel, you will probably get along much, much better in the States living as a Reform Jew. Israel has a completely different attitude. </p>\n\n<p>I wish you all the luck in the world in your spiritual journey. Kol Tuv.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: Reform Judaism is accepting of basically any kind of lifestyle you want to live. Your looks don't matter in the least. You can still live a life and have religion. Make sure to explore all of your options, and talk to a rabbi. Good luck in your journey.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a broad group of questions.  Please permit me a focused answer.  By the time you read to the end, I hope you will understand why I think there's no need to address each part individually.</p>\n\n<p>You seem like a serious, sincere and intelligent person.  That, and the questions you ask, suggest to me that you are a <em>terrible</em> candidate for a Reform conversion.  I have met many serious, sincere and intelligent people who had a Reform conversion, in an Orthodox synagogue, after their Orthodox conversion.  They all realized that Reform was not for them, and, really, not even a thing: it's whatever you want it to be.  (I say all of this with the handicap of having grown up in the Reform movement myself.)  Thoughtful and sincere Reform converts usually become disillusioned with Reform fairly quickly, and either leave Judaism entirely, or pursue a Conservative or Orthodox conversion.  (Sadly, Conservative today is little different from Reform; I know multiple people who converted to Judaism 3 times.) </p>\n\n<p>I suggest you look into one of the Noahide societies.  There are 3 fairly easy to find on the web, headquartered in Texas, the U.K., and Jerusalem.  You may well discover that you are perfect as you are, and just need the companionship of like-minded people, and some learning.  I know some people active in that movement, and they are some of the nicest people I know (and I know some <em>really</em> nice people).</p>\n\n<p>If, after some time giving that a try, you still want to convert, I suggest you'd be better served with an Orthodox conversion.  Partly because the Orthodox don't proselytize, most non-Orthodox have an extremely inaccurate view of what Orthodoxy, and the Orthodox, are all about (I know I did).  I say this knowing that an Orthodox conversion typically takes at least 2 years, while 2 weeks is not out of the question for the Reform.  Truth is: it takes most people that long to learn and understand what Judaism is and how to live as a Jew.  Of course, you're free to decide it's not for you at any time <em>before</em> conversion.</p>\n\n\n",

All this is interpolated repeatedly with the phrase \"so says God\", which is generally taken by the commentaries to mean that this is a new prophesy/statement. Finaly, in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16212#v=19\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zechariah 8:19</a> the prophet states that in the future all the fast days will be days of rejoicing.

Indeed,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the fifth chapter of Hilchot Ta'aniot, halachah 5, after Maimonides\n  listed the four fast days commemorating the destruction of the Temple,\n  he adds: \"It was the custom in all of Israel to fast on these days,\n  and on the 13th of Adar in remembrance of the fasts which were\n  observed in the time of Haman\", etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Campus Rabbi points out that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The S'fat Emet (in his commentary to Rosh Hashanah, op. cit.) explains\n  that even according to Maimonides fasting on Tishah B'av was not\n  observed during the entire period of the Second Temple and its\n  observance was dependent on the changing political situation from time\n  to time: When the Jews of the Second Temple were under the yoke of\n  foreign rule, that was considered a time when there was \"no peace\" and\n  then fasting was observed, but when Jews ruled themselves (as during\n  the Hasmonean period),that was a period of peace and the fast of\n  Tishah B'av was canceled [4].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some doubt does exist as to whether the explanation of the S'fat Emet\n  truly reflects the ideas of Maimonides.

    "content": "# Tircha D'Tzibbur vs. Kavod Hatorah - which wins?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It's hard for me to properly phrase the question, but here's the \"ma'aseh shehaya\" (scenario):</p>\n\n<p>It was Shabbat Rosh Hodesh, parshat Balak, I believe. They took out 2 Sifrei Torah. I waited for the Torah carriers to approach the Bimah. Before putting down a Torah on the table, I lifted the Torah cover and noticed that one Torah was rolled to Pinchas, but the other seemed to be near the beginning - what looked like Breishit. I.e. - someone took the wrong Torah out of the ark.</p>\n\n<p>Wanting to minimize Tircah D'Tzibbur, I requested that the one designated for Maftir, which was at Pinchas, be placed on the table, and I rolled it to parshat Balak. Before Chatzi Kaddish, the 2nd Torah was placed next to the first. Now, it's time for hagbah.</p>\n\n<p>Again, attempting to minimize tircha d'tzibbur, I wanted to reuse the 1st Torah and roll that back to Pinchas, rather than roll the one from Breishit to Pinchas.</p>\n\n<p>So, I uncovered the 2nd Torah (the one at Breishit) and asked the person to do Hagbah on that one. Note, that I never used that 2nd Torah to read from it.</p>\n\n<p>My question - Was this \"trick\" halachically permissible? The 2nd Torah was \"opened\" and \"used\" solely for Hagbah, but I never read from it.  Essentially, there was a choice between tircha d'tzibbur vs. not \"embarassing the Torah\". I figured that tircha d'tzibbur was more important, which is why I did this. But, as I also wanted to make SOME use of the Torah, at least I used it for Hagbah. Was this OK, or did I specifically have to read from the 2nd Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33694&st=&pgnum=271&hilite=\">Machzor Vitri - page 206</a> brings a story on Rosh Chodesh which was Chanuka where they took out 2 Sefer Torahs and the person who read the Torah, in error read 4 Aliyos in Rosh Chodesh and the Halacha was determined that had they not taken out a second Sefer Torah they could of just skipped the Chanuka reading, however since the Torah was taken out, if we did not read in it, it would seem as if something is wrong with that Torah, therefore they should read a fifth Aliya in the other Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this it seems to me that the wrong choice was made.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam, in the <em>Mishneh Torah</em> (<em>Hilkhoth Teshuvah</em> 8:7) says this explicitly just as it is clearly stated by <em>Hazal</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...It has already been made known to us by the ancient Sages that man is unable to apprehend and understand the goodness of <em>`olam haba</em> as it actually is, and man does not know its greatness, its beauty, or its essence - only <em>HaQadhosh Barukh Hu</em> alone. And all of the good things that the prophets of Israel prophesied to the people, they were only those things which pertain to the physical body, which will be enjoyed by the Jewish people in the <em>yemoth mashiyahh</em>, that is, in the time when the sovereign kingdom will return to Israel.</p>\n<p>But the goodness of the life of <em>`olam haba</em>, it has no estimation or likeness to anything in this existence. And so the Biblical prophets did not attempt to describe it lest they lessen its greatness through illusion. This is what <em>Yeshayahu</em> said, \"no eye has seen it - no one beside you, God - that which He prepares for the one who waits for Him\" (64:3). That is to say that the goodness that that the prophet's eye has not seen, God prepares it for the man who waits for Him. The Sages said, 'None of the prophets prophesied about anything except for the <em>yemoth mashiyahh</em>, but as for <em>olam haba</em> \"no eye has seen it - no one beside You, God.\"'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is clearly seen, then, that the <em>yemoth mashiyahh</em> and <em>`olam haba</em> are certainly not to be equated, as they are not the same at all.</p>\n<p>[2] This next error is a common misunderstanding and is rather complex. It involves a common equation of every type of righteous non-Jew. However, according the Rambam in the Mishneh Torah, only righteous <em>yehudhim</em> and a group known as the <em>hasidhei umoth ha-`olam</em> receive a portion in the spiritual life of <em>olam haba</em>. The rest receive blessings in this world and many in the <em>yemoth mashiyahh</em>. This can be seen clearly when taking in aggregate all relevant statements of the Rambam  on this subject as written in the <em>Mishneh Torah</em>. The first of which is found in the laws of receiving converts. There (<em>Hilkhoth Issurei Bi'ah</em> 14:3-4) he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...Just as we inform [the prospective convert] of the punishment for violation of the <em>misswoth</em>, so do we also inform him of the reward for observing them; and we inform him that by performing these <em>misswoth</em> he will merit the life of <em>`olam haba</em>...and we say to him 'Know that <em>olam haba</em> is not hidden away for any except the righteous ones, <em><strong>which are the nation of Israel</strong></em>...'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, one has to be connected in a real and halakhic way to the Jewish nation in order to receive life in <em>`olam haba</em>. This is explained in the eighth chapter of <em>Hilkhoth Melakhim Umilhhamoth</em> in the <em>Mishneh Torah</em>. It is here where many have misread the Rambam. When the Rambam says \"<em>kol ha-meqabel</em>...\" he is referring to a <em>ger toshav</em> <strong>dawqa</strong> - <em><strong>which is only received in a time when we count the yovelim</strong></em> (cf. <em>Hilkhoth Issurei Bi'ah</em> 14:8) and their reception has to take place in front of a court of three (see <em>Hilkhoth Melakhim Umilhhamoth</em> 8). Anyone else among the nations who is righteous is promised provision and blessing in this world in exchange for his deeds (cf. <em>Hilkhoth Shemittah WiYovel</em> 13:13), but unless he attaches himself to the nation of Israel and becomes a <em>hasidh me-umoth ha-olam</em>, such a one will not receive a place in <em>olam haba</em>. Read these things carefully and critically <em>wa-du\"q</em>.</p>\n<p>It may not be popular or the party line within modern Judaism, but this is - <em>le-`aniyuth da'ati</em> - the accurate view of the Rambam (and it appears to be the view of <em>Hazal</em> as well).</p>\n<p>[See also, <em>Hilkhoth Teshuvah</em> 3:5 and <em>Hilkhoth `Avodhah Zarah</em> 10:6, et al]</p>\n<p>As for Jews \"ruling the world\" in the future under the <em>mashiyahh</em>, this idea is the fantasy of anti-Semitic groups and some Christian sects. While the Jewish people will collectively exercise sovereignty over <em>eress yisra'el</em> and will have political dominance over the surrounding areas due to their subduing their immediate enemies via warfare (cf. <em>Hilkhoth Melakhim Umilhhamoth</em> 11:8), <em><strong>there will be no world domination by the Jews</strong></em>. Rather, the nations of the world will be persuaded by the wisdom of Israel's righteous king to work together for peace and prosperity, each human being acknowledging God and His sovereignty over the world.</p>\n<p>[3] In the <em>yemoth mashiyahh</em>, there is no inheritance of any land in <em>eress yisra'el</em> for anyone except the <em>shevatim</em> and those who have converted to become full Jews. The future division of the land as mentioned in <em>Yehhezeq'el</em> 47:21-23 is a reference to Jews - both native-born and converts - <em><strong>only</strong></em>. Although I cannot go into it fully here, this prophecy is most likely looking toward an inevitable reality of the Jewish people gathered after a long exile and without proof of parentage, therefore the prophet is stating that there will be a \"reset\" as it were and those whose tribal affiliation cannot be determined or those who have descended from many generations of converts (converts usually do not inherit land due to their having no tribe) will be given an inheritance going forward. Perhaps a future <em>Sanhedrin</em> will make such a ruling - suspending the <em>din</em> of the Torah in accordance with pressing temporary need (cf. <em>Hilkhoth Mamrim</em> 2), but this is another discussion for another time.</p>\n<p><strong>Now, to answer your question</strong>.</p>\n<p>As for your question regarding a righteous Chinese man in the <em>yemoth mashiyahh</em> and his \"inheritance,\" if such a person in China has any inheritance at all, it will not be in <em>eress yisra'el</em> unless such a person converts to Judaism - thereby changing his national affiliation - in which case he would (apparently) receive a portion of the land per <em>Yehhezeq'el</em> 47:21-23.</p>\n<p>If such a person were either a <em>ger toshav</em> (i.e. a <em>hasidh me-umoth ha-olam</em>) or a Jewish convert, then such a person would have a place in <em>`olam haba</em> as well.</p>\n<p>If, however, said righteous Chinese man is neither a <em>ger toshav</em> or a Jewish convert, then he is promised blessing and reward in this world and will (perhaps) also be rewarded in the <em>yemoth mashiyahh</em>, but not in <em>`olam haba</em>.</p>\n<p>If he is living in China during the <em>yemoth mashiyahh</em> - when all of the nations will be under the justice of the Torah and the <em>sanhedrin</em> of <em>melekh ha-mashiyahh</em> - then I suppose that any land that either he owns or his family owns will be justly handled according to the property law and stipulations of sale at the time such property was acquired by either him or his forebears.</p>\n<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: This answer relies on the <em>Mishneh Torah</em> of the Rambam as the supreme, but not infallible, source of Jewish law on any given matter of <em>halakhah</em>. While I do not bring other opinions here (because I do not happen to share them), I do nevertheless respect them.]</p>\n\n\n",

The Margolios Hayam there note 15 brings all the classical sources against this decidedly unjewish act. He started off the piece by explaining that Dovid's act of catching food is not hunting, hunting is an act of entertainment. \nHalachicaly, if one can aim right and shecht the animal with his arrow, as recorded in Chulin, that is totally kosher. So too, shooting below the knee in order to incapacitate the animal would not render it a treifa, which I do remember someone writing about David Hamelech's hunting adventure, but I can't remember where I saw that. Any other shot, even if not a 'kill shot' would make it unusable and therefore assur, unless of course the person has a need for the skin or blood.\nAnother sugya that mentions trapping is in Bava Metzia 85b, there a net was used and the meat eaten and the skins used for writing sifrei torah.\nAlso, Reb Yaakov Kaminetsky writes in the fifth chapter of his commentary on Pirkei Avos that killing a fly is as much murder as killing a human being. The difference is the Torah allowed the one but not the other.

Gabriel</a> has a military interpretation of the Exodus.</p>\n\n<p>A key part of <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0275977986\" rel=\"nofollow\">his analysis</a> is that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Avadeem is not the word for slave, it is the word for “worker” or even servant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this is true, this may confirm, to him, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habiru\" rel=\"nofollow\">his theory</a> that Exodus Jews were also the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habiru\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"habiru\"</a>, buffer mercenaries of Egypt who became unmanageable & fearsome and were \"set to labor\" as corvee.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, he states that a transition from mercenary to outright slave is unlikely because there would undoubtedly be opposition, hastening the Exodus outcome.  If they were simply nudged to a state of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corv%C3%A9e\" rel=\"nofollow\">corvee labor</a>, where ownership isn't explicit and right are partially instead of totally revoked, they would be less likely to revolt and risk a life in the wilderness away from civilization.</p>\n\n<p>If they were born slaves for many generations, they would be unlikely to be able to fight their way out as he claims.  To support this he offers an interpreted <a href=\"http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-35.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exodus 12:35</a> as evidence for fighting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>35 Now the sons of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, for they had requested from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; 36 and the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have their request. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That militarily speaking, this could not be done except by forceful coercion.</p>\n\n<p>How precisely is \"avadeem\" defined based upon its usage in the Torah only?  What are all of its usages in the Torah only?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Exodus 1:13 uses a word sharing the ayin-vet-yod (e-v-d) root \n\"So the Egyptians enslaved the children of Israel with back breaking labor.\"</p>\n\n<p>The phrase \"back breaking labor\" seems to point not to a simple worker or servant and the details in verse 14 flesh out that enslavement. Chapter 2 verse 27 shows that the \"work\" (from the same root) was oppressive (as explained in 3:7 and 9) and forced the people to cry out. 5:26 and surrounding verses also show that Pharaoh had control over every aspect of the people's lives, more than one would expect from a simple laborer.</p>\n\n<p>The root e-v-d means \"work\" in many different senses -- it is used to describe sacrifices in the temple, and the basic work people perform daily. But when it is used in a forced sense (made them work) and is accompanied by the oppressive control other verses describe it seems clear that we are not talking about an innocuous servant status.</p>\n\n<p>When it is used later in the text to describe the laws of owning a slave (still in the sense of ownership, something not present when one describes being a \"worker\") the text speaks of the limits of control, and yet the slave is still a slave. When the slave has no rights, how much more so is it apparent that slavery is the situation?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Eliezer was an 'eved' of Avraham.

However, I have also heard that chumrat glatt originates in Hungary, so there is a possibility that chalak would be comparatively meikel.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to the Beit Yoseph, certain sirchos are kosher without any further bedika (examination). These are sircha c'sidran and sircha b'dophen tsar. An animal which has such sirchot is kosher Beit Yoseph, but is not chalak. If it has no sirchos at all, it is chalak. The Rama himself did not allow those sirchos which the Beit Yoseph allowed, in fact the Rama says that wherever a sircha is found, the animal should not be eaten. However he mentions a custom to rub the sircha between the fingers, and if it melts away, it is not considered a sircha at all. The rama does not allow it but says ein mochin b'yadam (meaning we don't stop them). The contemporary poskim all said that the only thing allowed was to rub the sircha between the fingers, but someone who peels off the sircha is feeding treiphos to the c'lal Yisroel. Later, the shochetim started to peel off the sirchos, and for whatever reason, the rabbis allowed it. This is discussed in the Aruch Hashulchan. He specifically says that this peeling off of sirchos that everyone does was formerly considered treiph.</p>\n\n<p>Glatt literally translated means the same as chalak- no sirchos. In practice (it very much depends on the area, the weather, the humidity, the cattle feed, the conditios (free range, small pens, etc.), only about 10% of US beef is truly chalak. To increase the yield, someone decided that if the animal had up to three small sirchos (which they called ririn), it could still be called glatt.</p>\n\n<p>With the demand by knowledgeable consumers for truly glatt (=chalak) meat, the marketers had to come up with a new name. They couldn't call the chalak meat \"real glatt\" because then they would have to admit that most of the so called glatt really is not. So they decided to call it Beis Yoseph.</p>\n\n<p>So if the meat is called glatt, it most likely is not truly glatt. If it is called Beit Yoseph, it might be truly chalak. If it is called chalak Beit Yoseph, then it is really claiming to have no sirchos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Glatt and Chalak have different stringencies and leniencies relative to the other.</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://kosherpoint.com/mehadrin/mehadrin-meat-glatt-chalak/\" rel=\"nofollow\">kosherpoint.com</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Not all sirchot are equal. There are certain areas of the lung, where\n  a sircha will not make the animal treif. However, there are differing\n  opinions as to the extent of these areas. The Sephardi view (following\n  the Beit Yosef) is more lenient – that is, according to them, there\n  are more areas where a sircha can exist without affecting the kashrut.\n  As a result, sirchot on certain areas of the lung can be ignored by\n  the Sephardim, while those same sirchot will make the entire animal\n  treif for Ashkenazim (following the Rama).</p>\n  \n  <p>On the other hand, Ashkenazim are more lenient in handling those\n  sirchot found on the critical areas of the lung (where they can make\n  the animal treif). The Rama allows for these sirchot to be removed by\n  gentle peeling or squeezing, and if the lungs are then checked and\n  found to have no perforations, the meat is considered kosher. The Beit\n  Yosef strongly disagrees with this procedure stating that it is not\n  permissible to remove sirchot in any manner and thus they always\n  render the animal treif.</p>\n  \n  <p>Some Ashkenazim follow another leniency whereby certain small, thin\n  sirchot which can be easily removed, are considered ‘ririn’ (mucous)\n  and do not affect the standard of kashrut (Beit David), regardless of\n  where it is located. Sephardim do not make this distinction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, an Ashkenzi cannot rely on the בית יוסף alone, and a ספרדי cannot rely on just Glatt Kosher, and neither is universally more machmir than the other.</p>\n\n\n",

(Don't recall source of that rule.) At the end of the \"Modim\" prayer we thank G-d for על נסיך שבל יום עמנו - \"For the miracles that are with us daily.\"</p>\n\n<p>What \"miracles\" are we referring to? It seems that if we are thanking G-d 3 times daily for miracles, then in a sense, aren't we relying on G-d to make these miracles happen every day?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Yehuda Ben Yakar mentions that נסיך here may refer to נסיונות, that we are thanking Hashem for the challenges that He gives us every day.</p>\n\n<p>Etz Yosef says that these miracles are not referring to miracles that are constantly happening.  It is referring to the open miracles which are always with us <em>in our minds</em>, meaning we always are aware of these open miracles that have happened.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהם עמנו בידיעתנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So בכל יום עמנו does not mean that they are happening every day, but that we know of them, or think of them, every day.</p>\n\n<p>However, Iyun Tefillah states that this is referring to miracles which Hashem does every day.  He seems to understand it to refer to hidden miracles, which are referred to in the verse עושה נפלאות לבדו.  This does not mean we do extraordinary things with the expectation of the miracle, it means that part of our normal daily function is that hidden miracles happen.</p>\n\n<p>Siach Yitzchak explains that these miracles are with the Jewish people, meaning that they are not necessarily happening to every individual every day, but they are with the Jewish people as a whole.  According to this, the miracles being referred to are not necessarily happening to any individual on any given day.</p>\n\n\n",

The reasoning was since David was considered a rebel against the king and king shaul had the right to kill david it could be argued that David was already a dead person.\n        This is not the same case as yefat toar, but it does shed light that perhaps in some special cases a pesak halacha could be made for a man to marry a woman who is married to someone else.</p>\n\n\n",

Some subway lines themselves can be considered dangerous because of the neighborhoods they pass through and the people that board the train. I used NYC as an example, but I gather that similar evaluations may be made about many transit systems in the world.</p>\n\n<p>The same source (Aruch Hashulchan) specifies that travel must be to another city. My daily commute on the subway is 1 hr. each way but is within the same city. Normally the distance would qualify, but since it's in the same city, I infer, no. However, the majority of my commute is through several dangerous neighborhoods. Based on this Aruch Hashulchan, should I say Tefillat Haderech?

Keep in mind, that for the most part, the verses you are mentioning list names of places. However, as verse 2 of the same chapter implies, these travels were also indicated because special events happened, and most commentaries also explain that many of the names themselves are not necessarily place names but allusions to events that happened.</p>\n\n<p>Verses 38 and 39 seem to interrupt the pattern of listing places and it mentions Aharon's death. Why isn't the parsha break before verse 38? Because verse 37 says that they arrived at Hor Hahar, and since Aharon died at Hor Hahar, it is connected to that place.</p>\n\n<p>Verse 40 talks about the King of Arad attacking, which is not related to Aharon's death, per se, but is an event that occurred during the travels, so it belongs in a separate parsha.</p>\n\n<p>Another answer, that I think has stronger support:</p>\n\n<p>Compare the end of Bamidbar ch. 20, which talks about Aharon's death, and the very beginning of Bamidbar ch. 21, which talks about the King of Arad attacking B'nai Israel. You will notice two similarities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A parsha break which is stumah (closed)</li>\n<li>Bamidbar 21:1 and verse Bamidbar 33:40 begin with the same words.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Perhaps, to maintain similarity and \"consistency\", the same location and type of parsha break is here as it was there! </p>\n\n\n",

The one strikes harder than the other according to flexibility. \nThe word שבט designates a tribe, whilst the word מטה is the pole that identifies the שבט because each tribe has its identifying flag, sign and/or name engraved on it. \nConsequently, in Parashat Mattot, the tribes are called מטות because that is the way they camped in the desert, each tribe around its identifying pole.       </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch writes on Bamidbar (30:2) at the beginning of the Mattos,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah enables individuals, communities, and the entire nation to\n  establish for themselves permanent norms for ensuring the faithful\n  observance of the mitzvos. For this reason this section is addressed\n  particularly to the nesi'im who significantly are here called Roshei\n  Matos. As already noted in our commentary on chapter 1, \"matteh\"\n  conceives of the tribe as a branch of the larger whole, with each\n  branch working through its own unique characteristics to carry out the\n  mission shared in common by the entire nation. It was the task of the\n  roshei hamattos to attend to the customs arising from the\n  individuality of each branch, and to attend also to common activities,\n  aspirations, and purposes. It was their responsibility to properly\n  channel all of these to promote the fulfillment of the national\n  mission in accordance with the unique characteristics of each branch.\n  The means for such activity, the prerequisite for the development of\n  the nation as a whole and for communal life is the binding force of\n  vows and of regulations instituted by man which is was the laws that\n  now follow deal with. In addition, roshei hamattos are entrusted with\n  hataras nedarim. They function as family counselors and spiritual\n  advisors coming from among the people themselves. It is for this\n  reason too that the section on vows in addressed first to roshei\n  hamattos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Rav Hirsch (Bamidbar 18:2) writes,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מטה is the horizontal direction which looks on the tribe as a branch\n  of the basic stem, accordingly being on a line with the other tribes,\n  so being excluded from the actual priestly service and would only be\n  allowed to be allocated to assist at subsidiary offices. שבט is the\n  tribe as an independent stem, 'stave', hence the word itself is an\n  expression of strength and power, as a rule is the designation of the\n  tribes of Israel in their independent strength and value - שבטי ישראל\n  not מטות  ישראל. So that שבט אביך is the tribe in which your father\n  lives on in his specialty, your father who subscribes such an\n  important quota to the Jewish national body, the tribe that by its\n  unreserved devotion to the cause of God showed itself as the born\n  guard of the Sanctuary. As שבט אביך, the Levites received their\n  position and mission towards the people, which was represented by the\n  guard of their camp round the Sanctuary in the wilderness, which\n  belongs to the משמרת אהל מועד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/en/tribes-and-tribalism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">these</a> succinct words from Rav Yaakov Beasely:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The term \"shevet\" connotes power and authority.  However, the word\n  \"matteh,\" staff, is essentially a support (from the Hebrew root\n  n-t-h).  In the context of a describing a group, it connotes mutual\n  aid and sustenance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Rebbe in one of his sichas <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/2506328/jewish/Shabbos-Parshas-Mattos-Maasei-28th-Day-of-Tammuz-5747-1987.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Shabbos Parshas Mattos-Maasei , 28th Tammuz, 5747)</a> explains that the word mattos emphasizes the attribute of power and rigidity. The two words “mateh” and “shevet” both mean a “staff”.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The two words “mateh” and “shevet” both mean a “staff” (and are both used for “tribe”). Yet there is a subtle difference between a pliable branch (shevet) and a strong staff (mateh). Thus, “Mattos” symbolizes that a Jew must be firm and strong — not bending even a hairsbreadth when it comes to principles of Yiddishkeit, Torah and mitzvos.</p>\n<p>This is congruous with the Mishnaic dictum to be as careful in\nfulfilling a minor mitzvah as a major mitzvah — for when a Jew is\ntruly connected to G‑d and wants to fulfill the will of the King there\nwill be no difference between minor and major, since G‑d has commanded\nthe mitzvos and desires that all of them be carried out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rebbe continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When “Mattos” and “Maasei” are combined the strength of “Mattos” takes on the progressive movement of “Maasei” so that steadfastness and strength grows stronger and stronger.</p>\n<p>At the same time the steady growth in matters of holiness attains an\naspect of strength and even those aspects of Jewish life which\nrepresent only custom or greater piety are also invigorated and\nempowered. So that all aspects of Shabbos Mevarchim Menachem Av are\nenhanced and invigorated.</p>\n<p>May the final “move” come speedily, and bring us to the Holy Land with\nthe true and complete redemption through our righteous Mashiach. Then\nwe will no longer be obligated to request favors of patronizing\ngentile nations for we will live freely in our land under the rule of\nthe Jewish monarchy.</p>\n<p>To speed this we must increase our activities in Torah and mitzvos,\nincluding our fervent plea for salvation: “Speedily cause the scion of\nDovid Your servant to flourish...,” and, as we say in the prayer also\non Shabbos and Yom Tov: “May our eyes behold Your return to Tziyon in\nmercy.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Mishna (Sotah 20a) records a celebrated dispute between Ben Azzai and Rabbi Eliezer if it is advisable to teach women Torah.  Ben Azzai believes that one should teach his daughter Torah and Rabbi Eliezer strongly advises against it.  The Mishna concludes with Rabbi Yehoshua's statement which supports Rabbi Eliezer's view.  The Rambam (Hilchot Talmud Torah 1:13) and the Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 246:6) rule in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua.</p>\n<p>Even though the Chafetz Chaim endorsed the Bait Yaakov movement he did not specifically approve the teaching of Gemara to women.  He explains his position in his commentary to Sotah 20a (in his Sefer, Likutei Halachot): It seems to me that this [issue of refraining from teaching Torah to women] applies only at those times in history when everyone lived in the place of his ancestors and the Mesora was very strong for all, and this constituted sufficient motivation for everyone to act in the same manner as their forebears....In this type of situation we can say that women should not study Torah and women will learn the ways of Torah by emulating their righteous parents.  Today, however, when the Mesora has become very weakened, and it is common for people to live far away from their parents, and women learn to read and write a secular language, it is a great Mitzvah to teach women Tanach and the Mussar of Chazal from Pirkei Avot and Menorat Hamaor, so that the truth of our Mesora will become evident to them.  The alternative, God forbid, is for women to deviate entirely from the way of Hashem and Torah.</p>\n<p>The Satmar Rebbe (Vayoel Moshe pages 451‑452) points out that the Chafetz Chaim limited his permission to the study of Tanach and Mussar. Similarly, Rav Moshe Feinstein (Igrot Moshe Y.D. 3:87) rules that women may not study Mishnayos with the sole exception of Pirkei Avot.</p>\n<p>Those who believe women should study Gemara</p>\n<p>Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik taught women Gemara at the inaugural Shiur delivered at the Stern College Beit Midrash and instituted girls' study of Gemara at the Maimonides School in Boston.  Rav Meyer Twersky (Tradition Summer 1996 pages 98‑99) explains the Halachic basis for his grandfather's practice:</p>\n<p>The Halacha prohibiting Torah study for women is not indiscriminate or all‑encompassing.  There is complete unanimity that women are obligated to study Halachot pertaining to Mitzvot which are incumbent upon them (Rama Y.D.246:6).  Clearly, men are permitted to provide instruction in these areas.  A father's obligation of Chinuch relates equally to sons and daughters (see, for example, Yoma 82a).  The prohibition of teaching the Oral Law to women relates to optional study.  If ever circumstances dictate that study of the Oral Law is necessary to provide a firm foundation for faith, such study becomes obligatory and obviously lies beyond the pale of any prohibition.  Undoubtedly, the Rav's prescription was more far‑reaching than that of the Chafetz Chaim and others.  But the difference in magnitude should not obscure their fundamental agreement: intuitively, it is clear that the guidelines of the Talmud in Masechet Sotah were never intended for our epoch. This is not an instance of modernism, but Torah intuition.</p>\n<p>Rav Eliezer Waldenberg's Teshuvot Tzitz Eliezer (9:3), based on the Chafetz Chaim appears to concur with that of Rav Twersky.</p>\n<p>In September 1986 a number of students asked Rav Aharon Soloveitchik (after completing a Shiur delivered at Yeshiva University) his opinion about teaching Gemara to women.  He responded by citing the Torah Temima (Devarim 11:19) who quotes the Teshuvot Maayan Ganim.  This authority writes that Chazal only prohibited coercing women to study Torah.  If, however, they choose to learn Torah, then they deserve full support of the community.</p>\n<p>Rav Chaim David Halevi (Teshuvot Asei Lecha Rav 2:52) adopts a similar approach. He writes that high school girls who wish to study Torah are permitted to do so.  He cites the Chida as supporting this view (also see Prisha to Y.D. 246).  Rav Yehuda Henkin (Teshuvot Bnei Banim 3:12) points out that this approach explains the phenomenon of women in various generations who were Torah scholars.  The examples of outstanding women Torah scholars include Bruriah (see Pesachim 62b and Eruvin 53b), the mother of the Prisha (whom the Prisha occasionally quotes and notes that she was proficient in many areas of Halacha), the grandmother of the Maharshal, the wife of the Netziv, the wife of Rav Isser Zalman Meltzer (regarding whom it is said that she helped edit the Even Haezel ‑ Rav Isser Zalman's commentary to the Rambam) and Nechama Leibowitz.</p>\n<p>Rav Aharon Lichtenstein often points out that Talmud Torah promotes Ahavat Hashem (see the Rambam's Sefer HaMitzvot, Mitzva number three).  Thus he argues that women who study Torah have the opportunity to fulfill the Mitzva of Ahavat Hashem.  Rav Lichtenstein and Rav Henkin argue that women who study secular studies at the highest level should also study Torah at the highest levels including the study of Gemara.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it appropriately Jewish to use Psalms as a form of talisman?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While wandering around Israel, I noticed a group of youths asking the public to recite a psalm for the soldiers. Ok, I recited a Psalm.</p>\n\n<p>I assumed these prayers were fulfilling what I saw as the traditional role, meditation, asking for individual and collective guidance, and asking and hoping for providential action which makes the world more right. But the folks were rather insistent on certain bureaucratic details, for instance that I recite a psalm that had not been read, and in clarifying why, in discussions, I slowly began to understand that they considered the action of reciting all the psalms, once completed, to directly lead to divine intervention. They believe that if they recite the prayers properly, the bombs and missiles will get stopped.</p>\n\n<p>I was freaked out by this, as this sort of supernatural-magic kind of religion seemed to me to have been put to rest at least by the medieval era by Maimonides and others, perhaps earlier. But in later discussions with an ultra-orthodox fellow, I was pointed to a bunch of Rabbinical commentary, which I skimmed, which in an elliptical style he claimed gives support to the idea of Psalm-magic. The commentary was in flowery Hebrew, and it was pretty vague.</p>\n\n<p>It was not clear to me that this was a part of contemporary Judaism. I am aware that the actions of prayer are supposed to be meaningful, but I had assumed that the mechanism of prayer was neither considered a quid-pro-quo, nor supernatural magic stemming from precisely completing a precise ritual, but providential actions and individual and collective guidance stemming from a common faith.</p>\n\n<p>So what gives? Is this type of Psalm-magic universally considered part of Judaism?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Maimonides seems to draw a distinction between recitation of verses (such as Psalms) as an expression of the <em>mitzva</em> (to study Torah), which is permitted, and recitation of verses as a form of a talisman. He writes in Hil. Avodah Zarah (11: 12):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הלוחש על המכה וקורא פסוק מן התורה וכן הקורא על התינוק שלא יבעת והמניח ספר תורה או תפילין על הקטן בשביל שיישן, לא די להם שהם בכלל מנחשים וחוברים אלא שהן בכלל הכופרים בתורה שהן עושין דברי תורה רפואת גוף ואינן אלא רפואת נפשות שנאמר ויהיו חיים לנפשך, אבל הבריא שקרא פסוקין ומזמור מתהילים כדי שתגן עליו זכות קריאתן וינצל מצרות ומנזקים הרי זה מותר</p>\n<p>[Regarding] one who whispers over a wound and reads a verse of the Torah, and one who reads [verses] over an infant to save it from terrors, and one who places a Torah scroll or <em>tefillin</em> on a child so that he sleeps; they are not merely considered sorcerers and soothsayers, but they are considered those who deny the Torah who render words of Torah a cure for the soul, while they are naught but a cure for spirits, as it says  \"And they shall be life for your spirit\" (Proverbs 3: 22).</p>\n<p>However, a healthy person who read verses and Psalms so that the merit of their recitation protect him and he be saved from troubles and hurt; this is permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The distinction seems to be that while it is permitted to perform the mitzvah of Torah study with the recitation of Psalms or other verses, with the intent that in the merit of his <em>mitzvah</em> (performance of a divinely mandated activity) he be saved from troubles, it is strictly forbidden to recite verses (such as Psalms) based on the belief that the recitation <em>itself</em> carries power.</p>\n<p>This suggestion that recitation of Psalms is prohibited when performed superstitiously rather than as a <em>mitzvah</em> of Torah study is found quoted in the responsa of R. Betzalel Stern (Shut B'tzel HaChochmah vol. 4 ch. 47):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אגב אעיר במש\"כ בקונט' דבק טוב (סי' ד' ד\"ה בענין) בשם ס' עיני ישראל לתמוה על מנהג ישראל לומר תהלים עבור חולה הלוא אסור להתרפות בדברי תורה ותי' עפ\"י מש\"כ בסי' ת\"ח דהיינו דוקא עפ\"י דרך סגולה אבל בכוונה שיתרפא בזכות התורה מותר, אלא שלפי\"ז ללקוט ולומר מזמורים מיוחדים וכמו כן לומר פסוקי תמניא אפי' לפי אותיות שם של החולה שהוא דומה לדרך סגולה בודאי אסור ע\"כ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize: R. Stern quotes others who wonder why it is permitted to recite Psalms on behalf of the ill in seeming opposition Talmudic dictum. He cites the answer that the only prohibition is recitation as a <em>segulah</em> (superstitious act). But when performed for the purpose of fulfilling the mitzvah of Torah study it is permitted. Accordingly, it would be forbidden to recite particular Psalms or verses containing the letters of the patient's name as these specification have nothing to do with Torah study, but only with <em>segulah</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Without the Rabbinic text which you were shown it's hard to <strong>disprove</strong> the particular claim, but I would <strong>dispute</strong> the claim that this is part of mainstream <strong>contemporary Judaism</strong> which itself is so vague a category that it is practically meaningless. There is no halacha (Jewish law) or Gemarah (Talmud, written redaction of the oral law) that I am aware of which states that if Psalms are said something magical will occur. </p>\n\n<p>Praying to God is meritorious and saying Psalms may increase a personal and collective merit - either by strengthening our relationship with God, adjuring us to be better people, or at the least as a form of Torah study - which may in turn lead to God granting a more favorable outcome than if a person had not prayed/recited Pslams. However, that is not magic. The entire premise of magic is that God is <em>forced</em> to do something based on my actions. Judaism, contemporary or otherwise, proscribes participating in and supporting that kind of thing. </p>\n\n<p>The possible exception is wearing an amulet, however Maimonides explains the permission for use of these items along psychological lines. Not that the amulet actually does anything, but it makes the wearer feel safe.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Talmud's discussion in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=26&daf=15b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shavuos 15b</a> would seem to be very relevant here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבי יהושע בן לוי אמר להו להני קראי וגאני היכי עביד הכי והאמר ר' יהושע\n  בן לוי אסור להתרפאות בדברי תורה להגן שאני ואלא כי אמר אסור דאיכא מכה\n  אי דאיכא מכה אסור ותו לא והתנן הלוחש על המכה אין לו חלק לעולם הבא הא\n  איתמר עלה א\"ר יוחנן ברוקק שנו לפי שאין מזכירין שם שמים על הרקיקה</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Joshua b. Levi recited these verses when retiring to sleep. How\n  could he do so? Did not R. Joshua b. Levi [himself] say it is\n  prohibited to heal oneself with words of the Torah? — To protect\n  oneself is different. Well then, when he said it is prohibited, [he\n  meant] where there is [already] a wound. If there is a wound, is it\n  merely prohibited, and nothing else? Surely, we have learnt: He who\n  utters an incantation over a wound has no portion in the world to\n  come! — But it has been taught with reference to this; R.

I want to learn Torah and gain <em>schar</em> in the next world and if you do learn (End of <em>Brachos</em>) in the next world, you do not get as much <em>schar</em> because you are not in <em>golus</em> and it is much easier.</p>\n<p>So my question is: Why should I want Moshiach to come? What if I like making the world a better place down here and getting more <em>schar</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><strong>Update for revised question</strong> (original is below)</p>\n<p>R' Chaim Shmulevitz in the Derech L'Chaim commentary to Derech Hashem addresses this question.  He asks, the Rambam writes that all the Nevi'im wanted Moshiach so that they could settle down and focus on learning Torah, but לפום צערא אגרא (the reward is commensurate to the struggle/effort), so why would they want such?</p>\n<p>His answer (paraphrased and embellished) is that our actions create the situation that we are in.  If you are born into a Torah observant family, then you may not get much reward for putting on Tefillin just as you were raised to do. But if you grew up without that lifestyle, and you begin putting on Tefillin, years later when it is no longer a struggle for you, you still get reward for <em>creating the situation</em> in which you put on Tefillin regularly.  This is the idea of mitzvah goreres mitzvah... schar mitzva mitzva (Pirkei Avos 4:2) - that the reward for the mitzvah is the Heavenly assistance to keep more mitzvos, and since you have brought about that Heavenly assistance, it is included in \"calculating\" your reward.</p>\n<p>So with bringing Moshiach, the Nevi'im wanted Moshiach so that they would be able to learn Torah more easily, and it wouldn't have detracted one iota from the reward associated, because the easiness itself would be part of the reward, as a result of their own mitzvos.</p>\n<p>Additionally, R' Yaakov Weinberg explained that wanting Moshiach is a reflection of your realization that the world is incomplete without having the full revelation of Hashem's presence.  From this perspective, we don't want Moshiach for our own sake - we want it out of a realization that the world we live in is incomplete, and we feel a tangible lack in the current state of existence.</p>\n<p>One final point - wanting Moshiach, despite how it may impact our \"personal interests\" of how much reward we will get, is important because it shows that we have a real relationship with Hashem.  If we were to <em>not</em> want Moshiach so that we can get a higher score, it shows that we are doing Mitzvos out of self-interest, not out of love of Hashem.  Wanting Moshiach shows that we are doing Mitzvos not as employees but out of a meaningful, selfless, relationship.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you do not want Moshiach to come, then you violate the 12th principle of the Rambam. No exceptions are made for why one would or wouldn't want Moshiach to come.</p>\n<p>The Rambam describes the implications of not accepting any of the principles as follows (postscript to 13 Principles, introduction to Perek Chelek - I don't know which translation this is (I found it online) but Kapach and Shilat have similar sentiments in their translations):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּכְשֶׁנִּתְקַלְקֵל לאדם יסוד מאלה היסודות – הרי יָצָא מן הכלל וכפר בעיקר. ונקרא \"מִין\" וְ\"אֶפִּיקוֹרוֹס\" וְ\"קוֹצֵץ בַּנְּטִיעוֹת\". וּמִצְוָה לְשׂוֹנְאוֹ וּלְאַבְּדוֹ.</p>\n<p>When someone messes up one of these principles, he has departed from the category [of Israelite] and has fundamentally rejected.  He is called a heretic, apikorus, and \"cuts down saplings\", and it is a mitzvah to hate him and destroy him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if you don't want Moshiach, you fall into that category.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I remember discussing this at some length some years ago with a rabbi in Ner Israel (in Baltimore. I don't remember which rabbi it was). We were discussing not whether one is considered a \"denier\" for not wanting <em>mashiach</em>, which is more your question, but <em>why</em> one should want <em>mashiach</em> if it means the end of all our reward-accrual and growth in spiritual level.</p>\n\n<p>One argument someone put forth, as I recall, is that our reward-accrual is great, but the actual reward is better, and during <em>mashiach</em>'s time we'll have more knowledge of God and all be on a higher spiritual level, which is kind of the point of our reward-accrual and spiritual growth anyway, so it makes sense to want that era.</p>\n\n<p>But that was downplayed by our rabbi, who said that the <em>real</em> reason we should want <em>mashiach</em> is that God is now relatively unknown in the world, and we should, for his sake, want <em>kidush hashem</em>, the greater knowledge of God, which will come in <em>mashiach</em>'s era.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The <em>Maharal</em> in <em>Netzach Yisroel</em>, in a passage explaining the symbolism of <em>eiruv tavshilin</em>, says that those who fulfilled the <em>mitvot</em> in <em>olam hazeh/galus</em> (this world/exile) continue to earn <em>sechar</em> (merit) in <em>ymot hamoshiach</em> (the messianic age). Not desiring <em>ymot hamoshiach</em>, in light of this idea, would then seem to be essentially a denial (emotionally, if not also intellectually) of what <em>ymot hamoshiach</em> truly are. (Also, I don't notice in the passage you quote the Rambam requiring this <em>awaiting</em> to be daily.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are large Jewish communities not picking up and moving to Israel?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In last week's Parsha we saw a clear instruction to \"settle\" the land of Israel. I read that is some distinction between the Rambam and the Ramban whether it is classified as one of the 613 Mitzvot, but it is a clear instruction none-the-less, as far as I understand.</p>\n\n<p>We live in a time where it is <em>easy</em> to make Aliya - at least much easier than it was hundreds of years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Why are there communities of tens of thousands of religious Jews in America that are being invested in and growing when we could be investing in those communities in the land of Israel?</p>\n\n<p>I hope this question does not offend anyone - especially during the 9 days. I am really trying to understand as this has been something that has baffled me for some time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>You have a bit of selection bias going on here - you're in 2014 and wondering why a single Jewish community hasn't moved from the USA to Israel. Since 1948, a significant number of Jewish communities from around the world (Ethiopia, Yemen, Morocco, Syria, Iraq, Russia, Poland, Romania), have all moved en-masse to Israel. Perhaps you should be asking why so many Jewish communities HAVE moved en-masse. :-) </p>\n\n<p>It usually takes time (Yes, Ethiopia is the exception to that rule), and there are usually a variety of factors involved, the primary one of which seems to be how the community feels economically in their \"host\" country. Right now, Jews in the US are very comfortable and enjoy all the rights of full citizenship and the fruits of economic success. Many other communities didn't move to Israel until their security (either economic or physical) began to be threatened. In the US, the Jewish community is both economically and physically secure.</p>\n\n<p>I would also like to point out that \"easy\" is a relative term. You seem to be focusing on physical ease of making aliyah. Yes, it is true that with a credit card and an internet connection you can make it from the US to Israel with all your worldly possessions inside of a month, but the emotional trip is far different. There is the issue of leaving your home, your friends, your family, and your culture. As someone who has flirted with the thought of Aliyah for a while, and done a few trial runs, I can can tell you that the hardest part is the cultural change. After the initial awe factor of being in the holy land wears off, there is the slow realization that I just don't feel at home here. The cultures are very different, and as someone raised in the US and used to the American way of doing everything, the Israeli way of doing things is very strange and unsettling.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>There is still a continuing machlokes on whether or not settling and living in the land of Israel is a mitzva, and quite honestly, it is only one mitzva. Until recently, Israel was called a <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/yes-israel-is-a-banana-republic-1.326213\" rel=\"nofollow\">banana republic</a> and with good reason. The beginnings of the Israeli state were chaotic. There were quite a few <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/Socialist_Zionism.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">socialist and communist Zionists</a> with their idea of what the Israeli government should be like. And, quite honestly, the institutions that early Israel had with these community alliyot were completely abusive (Genocide in the Holy Land). They may not have kidnapped Yemenite children or put religious Jews on the shooting range, but there was a clear, state approved, initiative to secularize these incoming communities. Several Sephardi and Mizrachi communities have essentially disappeared as a result of this forced assimilation. I'd even argue that the state's early policies are still reminiscent in the IDF as politicians have attempted to make it into an institution of assimilation. Obviously today though, the Israeli state does not do any of this. This is not a concern anymore, but its origins and intentions are quite a scare for quite a few, religious Jews. </p>\n\n<p>Continuing on, if one has an established way of life in terms of livelihood and community in a first world nation that was not founded by socialists (in the sense of the economist/socialist dichotomy and not how Republicans decide to use the term), then why would he move? Why would I move to a country that is not even a tenth the size of my state, with serious conflict with its neighbors, and with relative isolation to the rest of the first world? If a man lives in Ukraine and he's afraid that he may be killed (for being Jewish), then Israel sounds like the best alternative, but I live in a land that I am tied to for cultural, economic, and linguistic reasons. </p>\n\n<p>On a more opinionated note (this isn't a part of my answer), this entire obsession with Israel just sounds like a whole lot of idolatry. The land isn't any more intrinsically special or holy than the Americas, Europe, Asia, et cetera. The only thing that are holy are mitzvot, and the mitzva related to settling the land is, at best, questionable with relation to today. It does not matter where a Jew lives as long as he can live fruitfully while being shomer mitzvot. But, when people make the land of Israel to be something more than mitzvot, as if living in the land itself imbues some kind of mystical/holy power, that distracts away from the purpose of Judaism, worshiping God. \"Only God is holy and only His imperatives absolute,\" (The Religious Significance of the State). The Stanford Wiki actually summarizes my favorite, modern philosopher, Yeshayahu Leibowitz, pretty well on this subject. <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibowitz-yeshayahu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"The idea that any material object can be holy is something that, in Leibowitz's eyes, is the ultimate definition of idolatry, potentially leading to the worship of people, objects, or—significantly for his brand of Zionism—land.\"</a></p>\n\n\n",

May be that to intend to leave the tefila is a stronger problem than interruption with intend to return to tefila. </p>\n\n<p>One case has some similitude in Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 422, 1: A man was praying Shacharit or Mincha on Rosh Chodesh, but he forgot to say \"Yaale Veyavo\". Now, he suddenly becomes aware of his omission. But he already stepped back from his place. The Shulchan Aruch says that he must go back to the starting point of the Tefila. Mishna Berura adds than if he still not stepped back but already finish the Tefila, the rule is the same. </p>\n\n<p>What may be learn from this case? He has not yet fulfilled his duty, but the Tefila is stopped (almost equivalent to interrupted). He needs to start from the starting point. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, in this case, the end was the result of an error. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>he mistakenly thought he was up to עשה שלום... for a second</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>--></strong> He needs to start from the starting of the Shmona Esre. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The second question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 104, addresses moving from his place at the time of Tefila as an interruption (most cases of interruption covered in halacha are interruption by speaking). We find there several cases of moving, some interruptions are allowed and are not regarded as great interruption, some else are allowed but are despite this great interruptions (e.g. because they are too length). Some movements are not allowed. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>because someone bumped into him</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is as an authorized (because he had no choice) and short interruption, e.g. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/78269/9215\">this</a> case. </p>\n\n<p><strong>--></strong> He must return to his place and starts from the begining of the Beracha in which he was <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%93_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA OC 104, 5</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Qitzur Shulhhan Arukh, Yalqut Yosef (Orahh Hayim 96:7) <a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01355_part_6.html#%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9FB%D7%A6%D7%95B-B%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A2B%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AAB%D7%9B%D7%93%D7%99B%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states</a> (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן אם התחיל להתפלל בעל פה ובאמצע תפלתו התבלבל ואינו יכול להמשיך, מותר לו לעקור ממקומו ליקח סידור ולהמשיך התפלה מתוך הסידור [...]</p>\n<p>So, too, if one began praying by heart (i.e. <em>Be'al Peh</em>) and, in the middle of his prayer, became confused and unable to continue, he is allowed to move from his place, to take a siddur and to continue the prayer from the siddur [...].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>IMHO, this ruling can be applied to the case of one who mistakenly stepped backwards and, all the more so, for one who was thrown off balance by another.

    "content": "# How could Avraham feed his guests tongue?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Avraham served his guests three tongues in mustard.<sup>1</sup> However, Avraham kept all the <em>mitzvot</em>,<sup>2</sup> one of which is to give the foreleg, jaw (including the tongue<sup>3</sup>), and maw of each slaughtered animal to the <em>kohen</em>. So how could Avraham feed the tongues to his guests, instead of giving them to a <em>kohen</em> (perhaps Shem<sup>4</sup>)?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bava Metzia 86b</li>\n<li>Yoma 28b</li>\n<li>Chullin 134b</li>\n<li>Nedarim 32b</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Clearly, Avraham had the guests acquire the tongues before slaughtering the animal. As he assumed they were non-Jews, their ownership of the relevant body parts exempts those body parts from the requirement (Shulchan Arukh YD 61:26). Perhaps Avraham gave them water to wash their feet as part of a Kinyan Chalipin (according to Levi (Bava Metzia 47a)).</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, Avraham may have known that Shem was too far away to get the meat before it spoiled and exchanged the meat for money to save the Shem's property value from being lost (Shulchan Arukh YD 61:10).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, perhaps Avraham held like the opinions (Chullin 136a) that giving the tongue doesn't apply in the Diaspora because of a connection in the verse to Terumot and Maaserot. Since Avraham was living before Yerusha and Yeshiva of the land, the Mitzva didn't apply yet to his locale.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Note: See Rav Sternbach below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is no obligation to declare the Zero'a, Lechayayim, and Keivah as sanctified, or to separate them from the animal, if they are not going to be given to a Kohen. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This implies that if one cannot get the portions to a kohen before it spoils, then one need not separate them to begin with. If Shem was the Kohen, then Avraham could not have gotten it to him and was patur from separating it.</p>\n\n<p>The gemarah Megilla daf 28a brings the case of Rav Preidah who said that as a middus chassidus he had never eaten from an animal from which the matanos had not been taken. The Art Scroll edition of the gemora on daf 28a (1) footnote 4 brings the Ritva who says that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Gemora concludes that there is no analogy between the meat of an animal whos gifts have not been separated and <em>tevel</em>. ... Also in contrast to <em>terumah</em>, the priestly gifts from an animal are non-sacred, and so may be eaten even by a non-Kohen. Nevertheless, Rav Preida went beyond the demands of halacha, refusing to eat meat from an animal whose priestly gifts had not been separated (<em>Ritva</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Avraham kept the Torah as a midus chassidus and on that basis is halachically allowed to eat tongue as well as serve it to his guests.</p>\n\n<p>On thinking it over further, I have come to the conclusion (through logic) that Avraham would have also been considered a kohen at that time (when the \"guests\" arrived). In fact, that is why we have the line of kehunah being thought of as Shem (who outlived Avraham), Aiver, Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov, Levi (as seen by the treatment of the tribe of Levi in Mitzraim). It was only after Matan Torah that we have the assigned kehunah and the specific matanos.</p>\n\n<p>The logic involves the fact that Shem (Malchitzedek) is called <strong>a</strong> kohen of Hashem. From the way Avraham is treated (Nsi Elokim) by Avimelech and Bnei Ches (for example) it would appear that he was also recognized as a kohen. At that time, the kehunah was not a matter of yichus, as that only started after the appointment of Aharon. </p>\n\n<p>Since we can treat Avraham as a kohen, he was allowed to assign the matnos kehuna to himself, and, since they were not kodesh, serve them to his guests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> The section below explains why tongue is permitted even though it was not given to the Kohen. This would apply to Avraham as well as nowadays.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.co.il/chulin/insites/ch-dt-130.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">INSIGHTS INTO THE DAILY DAF - Chulin 130</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(c) RAV MOSHE STERNBUCH shlit'a explains that there is a basic\n  difference between Pidyon ha'Ben and all other Matnos Kehunah. The\n  obligation to redeem a firstborn son is independent of the five-Shekel\n  payment to the Kohen. Even when the five Shekalim are not given to a\n  Kohen, it is necessary to \"remove the Kedushah\" from a Bechor by\n  separating five Shekalim as a Pidyon. Since it is necessary to\n  separate five Shekalim regardless of whether it will be given to a\n  Kohen, the father must give them to a Kohen even though the Kohen is\n  not fully \"Muchzak.\" In contrast, Zero'a, Lechayayim, and Keivah (and\n  Reishis ha'Gez) involve nothing more than a monetary obligation to the\n  Kohen. There is no obligation to declare the Zero'a, Lechayayim, and\n  Keivah as sanctified, or to separate them from the animal, if they are\n  not going to be given to a Kohen. Since one does not need to give them\n  to a Kohen who is not \"Muchzak,\" one also does not need to separate\n  them from the animal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Why did they spend 2 years in the desert (assuming answer to prev. question is correct)?</li>\n<li>If everyone died within only 38 years, it seems that the \"punishment\" finished early, as Devarim 2:14 implies.

Then they wandered for 38 years where they had 20 journeys. Then, the final year there were 8 journeys after Aharon died as they went into the land.</p>\n\n<p>The 40 years of wandering in the desert retroactively include the one year that passed before the <em>meraglim</em> caused Israel to be punished.

Does <a href=\"http://www.hillel.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hillel International</a> do such things? Does it align itself with any of the modern sects?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Conversion is officiated by a <em>beit din</em>, or religious court. Hillel as an organization does not perform conversions; however, your school's Hillel rabbi might be able to assist you in conversion. </p>\n\n<p>Different universities' Hillels have rabbis from different streams of Judaism. Some have Reform rabbis, others have Conservative rabbis, others have Orthodox rabbis, and still others have unaffiliated rabbis or rabbis affiliated with one of the many other smaller streams of Judaism. If your Hillel rabbi is willing to work with you, he or she will likely do it according to his or her own stream. </p>\n\n<p>If you definitely want a reform conversion and the Hillel rabbi is not reform, he may or may not be able/willing to direct you to a reform rabbi who can do a reform conversion. </p>\n\n<p>As you may know, many Jews do not consider reform conversions valid, and those people would not consider you to be Jewish after having such a conversion.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Hillel as an organization does not, but an individual rabbi who works for Hillel may. Note that the Hillel rabbi at your school (assuming there is one - not all Hillel's have rabbis) may be Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, or something else. Also while most rabbis do not do conversions (it is a fairly rare and complicated process so most rabbis simply never encounter it), I can't imagine a Hillel rabbi not being willing to study and teach you even if s/he is not the person who actually performs the final conversion. Even if this rabbi doesn't do conversions, chances are they know who in town does and can work with you to find the right person to call. Pick up the phone and call.</p>\n\n<p>Reform conversion practices vary from place to place. The Central Conference of American Rabbis (the largest Reform rabbinic group) has published <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20040203004013/http://www.ccarnet.org/glgerim7.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">guidelines you can read</a>. However you'll also notice that many of the guidelines are phrased as guidelines and suggestions, and it's up to the individual rabbi to decide whether or how to implement them. Some rabbis may convene a beit din (panel of rabbis) to do the conversion, some may not. Some may ask you to immerse in a mikvah (ritual bath), some may not. If you're male some may want you to do a brit (circumcision), and some may not. And as others have pointed out, contemporary reform conversions are not currently accepted by the state of Israel. This may or may not matter to you.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# V'kara zeh el zeh v'amar - When does who bow left then right here?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At the beginning of Kedusha, the Chazzan says v'kara zeh el zeh v'amar.  I've seen three types of chazzanim with regard to bowing left at the first zeh and right at the second:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>bow left and right at vkara zeh... every time.</li>\n<li>never bow at vkara zeh...</li>\n<li>bow left and right at vkara zeh, but only on Shabbos.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Which is correct, if any?  And if this bowing is correct, should a non-Chazzan also do it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I was also bothered where this all came from. The ספר מנהג ישראל תורה on סימן קכה of שולחן ערוך אורח חיים who quotes from a few sources some ideas:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We say in a פיוט on יום כיפור that the angels are דמות ארבעה פנים לכל צד פונים אומרים קדוש, they are four faced, turn in every direction and say קדוש. He suggests that us doing this is symbolic of that.</li>\n<li>He also quotes from kabbalistic sources that the first קדוש corresponds to חסד, the second to גבורה and the last to תלמוד תורה. Then he adds that חסד corresponds to the right side and גבורה to the left so we bow in that way at this time.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It would seem that there is no difference between שליח ציבור and normal מתפלל, nor between שבת and ימי חול for this מנהג, should you choose to accept it. It is admittedly not particularly well sourced and that is why you see some not doing it. So I suggest, in conclusion to make a decision whether to do it or not, and if you decide to do it, do it consistently.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Ben-Tzion Mutzafi writes in his sefer שיבת ציון at שער ז' סימן ק\"ו in the name of his father Rav Salamon Mutzafi zt\"l who said that bowing to the left first is a mistake being carried over from when we bow by עושה שלום at the end of Shemonah Esrei.</p>\n\n<p>Over there, he says, we are facing opposite the Shechinah, so we bow to the right of the Shechinah first, <em>our left</em> and then to the left of the Shechinah, <em>our right</em>. But over here, we are meant to be copying the malachim, and the malachim bow right first, then left according to the זוהר נח עא:‏.</p>\n\n<p>So according to this, all three of those customs are wrong, but all should bow (the correct way) at all times.</p>\n\n\n",

Their repentance should never be accepted, as [implied by Proverbs 2:19]: \"None that go to her repent, nor will they regain the paths of life.\" </p>\n\n<p>(the notes in the Moznaim Rambam says:) </p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Their acceptance should never be accepted\"</strong> The commentaries have pointed out a contradiction between these statements and the Rambam's statements in Hilchos Teshuva 3:14: \"When does the statement that these individuals do not have a portion in the world to come apply? When they die without having repented. However, if such a person repents from his wicked deeds and dies as a Baal-Teshuvah, he will merit the world to come, for nothing can stand in the way of Teshuvah.\nEven if he denies God's existence throughout his life and repents in his final moments, he merits a portion in the world to come as implied by [Isaiah 57:19] \"<code>Peace, peace, to the distant and the near,' declares God.</code>I will heal him.'\"</p>\n\n<p>Any wicked person, apostate, or the like, who repents, whether in an open, revealed manner or in private, will be accepted as implied by [Jeremiah 3:22] \"Return, faithless children.\" [We may infer] that even if one is still faithless, as obvious from the fact that he repents in private and not in public, his Teshuvah will be accepted.\" </p>\n\n<p>this apparent contradiction was brought to the Rambam's attention during his lifetime. In one of his Responsa (101) he resolved the issue by explaining that his statements in Hilchos Havodas Kochavim refer to the attitude which should be adopted by the Jewish People. They should NEVER regard such an individual as a Baal-Teshuvah, because it is possible he is merely feigning repentance in order to gain public acceptance.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, in Hilchos Teshuvah, the Rambam is referring to the acceptance by God, sees the true feeling of every individual. If his repentance is sincere, regardless of the severity of his previous sins, God will accept him. (Note also the commentary of the Lechem Mishneh and the Responsa of the Radbaz, Vol. V, 1518, which offer similar explanations.) </p>\n\n<p><strong>Proverbs 2:19]: \"None that go to her repent, nor will they regain the paths of life.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Avoda zarah 17a questions: Since they will never \"Repent\" how could they be expected to \"regain the paths of life\"? The Talmud answers: \"Even after they repent, they will not \"Regain the path of life\"... - i.e they will die</p>\n\n<p>וְאָסוּר לְסַפַּר עִמָּהֶן וּלְהָשִׁיב עֲלֵיהֶן תְּשׁוּבָה כְּלָל, שֶׁנֶּאֱמָר \"אַל-תִּקְרַב, אֶל-פֶּתַח בֵּיתָהּ\"\nIt is forbidden to talk to them or to reply to them at all, as [Proverbs 5:8] states: \"Do not come close to her door.\" </p>\n\n<p>And quoting Matt in one of his comments in the question I mentioned above:</p>\n\n<p>\"Hilchos Mamrim 3:1 two important ones: 1. they aren't included among the Jewish people, so any halakha that requires a Jew cannot be done by such a person, and 2. they should be killed (remember, this site isn't meant for practical advice- please don't kill anyone.

(or any of the other 2 questions) and he responds No then am I supposed to \"It is forbidden to talk to them or to reply to them at all, as [Proverbs 5:8] states: \"Do not come close to her door.\" And \"1. they aren't included among the Jewish people, so any halakha that requires a Jew cannot be done by such a person\" </p></li>\n<li><p>According to Rambam's Responsa (See above) then there is no such thing as a Baal-Teshuva correct?

See Chazon Ish Y.D. 1:6, 2:16, 2:18, as well as in 2:28 where he writes that this was also the opinion of the Chofetz Chaim.  This is an extension of what the Rambam writes in Hilchos Mamrim 3:3, as well as in his comments to Mishna Chullin 1:2 and in a letter published in Shut Harambam 489, that Karaites, despite believing in heresy, are not to be 'ignored', as you put it, because they believe in their heresy though no fault of their own.</p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish is actually not the first to pasken like this - I believe that it is the opinion of R. Yaakov Ettlinger in Shut Binyan Tzion Hachadashos 23 (though I'm not sure what to make of that title). See also R. Moshe Feinstein in Iggros Moshe O.C. 4:91:6, as well as many other later poskim who have accepted this opinion, though there will always be dissenters here and there.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, there is a Rashash to Shabbos 31a, who (I believe) writes that a person is only considered a heretic after fully analyzing every side of the issue, which I doubt most people have. Until then, they are merely 'non-believers', which doesn't actually make them heretics.

The common practice is to make a very strong\n  cup of tea before Shabbos by using several bags and pouring boiling\n  water over them. It is preferable to also remove the bags before\n  Shabbos. This essence can now be added to a cup of hot water (kli\n  sheini) on Shabbos. The preferred method, however, according to Rabbi\n  Moshe Heinemann, shlita, Rabbinic Administrator of the Star-K, is to\n  place several bags into a pot of water and actually boil them up on\n  the fire before Shabbos. This essence, minus the bags, can be stored\n  in a cup and added to hot water.</p>\n  \n  <p>Alternatively, you may want to use instant tea on Shabbos. When using\n  instant tea, or coffee, the preferred method is to add the tea to the\n  hot water (kli sheini) and not vice versa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See the footnotes in that article for sources.</p>\n\n<p>I listed just one source. There are others that permit making tea using tea bags, and probably even using the loose tea in a cup.</p>\n\n<p>However, I found no opinion that allowed use of the tea spoon as this is a special tool designated for straining, which is similar to the melacha of \"borer\".</p>\n\n\n",

Many people spend most of the morning reading and discussing the Kinnos. It is also permitted and widespread to learn certain bits of Torah that are relevant to Tisha B'Av. These include Eicha, Iyov, the story of the destruction of the Temple which is related in Gittin 56b-58a and Sanhedrin 104, the third perek of Moed Katan which discusses mourning, as well as the halachot of Tisha B'Av, fasting, and mourning.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/144576/jewish/Order-of-the-Day.htm\">Chabad.org</a>, \"Many communities have the custom to clean the house and wash the floors after midday, in anticipation of the Redemption which we await.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Many communities offer various shiurim and / or films during the afternoon. I don't know if this is available where you live, but in mine, shuls \"compete\" with each other. </p>\n\n<p>During approx. the last decade, The <a href=\"http://www.cchfusa.org/TishaBav_14/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chofetz Chaim Heritage Foundation</a> has presented 2 excelent videos on Tish'a B'av. Many shuls present one or both of them, and they are always excellent. I don't know, offhand, if they do a webcast, so check the web site or contact them.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you don't find on of their lectures, Tish'a B'av is a great time to start learning Chafetz Chaim's book on Shmirat Halashon - laws of Lashon Hara. The Heritage Foundation as well as many Judaica Bookstaores sell his books in English translation, where you learn one law per day. If you've never learned it, I encourage a start.

It passes your shalom rav test. It has options for ashkenaz, sepharad, and eidei hamizrach. It is also very flexible - you can add names for holim, select which day(s) you celebrate purim, etc. It also auto calculates the special things like shir shel yom, yaaleh v'yavo, and other day specific things. It even includes the appropriate torah readings (if there are any that day).</p>\n\n<p>There are two places where it falls down (IMO):\n1 - It doesn't have hoshanot for sukkot, the time I find myself flipping pages the most often in my siddur and would most like an app.\n2 - It is made for Israel. While it passes your shalom rav test, it also includes birkat kohanim for regular shemona esrei, for chol hamoed it uses the Israeli torah readings, and on hol hamoed sukkot it has the Israeli mussaf additions. (In chutz l'aretz, because we have a safek yom we add mentions of two of the korbanot to each day. In EY there is no safek yom so they only mention of the day's korbanot).

There is an opinion in Rishonim that only regarding the Bein Hashemashot at the beginning of the day is Tisha bAv unique, but all fasts require being stringent at the end because we have to wait until it is certainly night to uproot the current status (chazaka) of the day. Most Rishonim though do not make such a distinction (Arukh haShulchan OC 562:9).</p>\n\n<p>In any event, as you alluded R Yossi holds that Bein Hashemashot starts only just prior to nightfall, and in general we do not combine Safek Derabanan Lekula with a rejection of R Yossi's view to provide a double leniency (Shaar Hatziyun 562:1). So either way we are going to wait until pretty close to nightfall.

    "content": "# Why is Maimonides View of Korbanot not Consistent with Messianic Times\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Maimonides theorized in his \"Guide to the Perplexed\" that Hashem did not favor <em>korbanot</em> (animal sacrifices), but allowed them due to the difficulty changing the nature of people. This is in the context of Israel being captive and accustomed to Egyptian ways. The concept of G-d being \"reluctant\" suggests He did something with hesitation and doubt. How could G-d be in conflict and doubt? Why would G-d \"think\" Israel couldn't possibly eradicate their pagan-like origins?  </p>\n\n<p>I understand that many rabbinic authorities opposed (and continue to do so) Rambam's view on this matter. How did he reconcile this concept with the restoration of the Third Temple during messianic times and the reintroduction of mandatory daily sacrifices? Today, most westerners, including Jews, see animal sacrifices as backwards, <em>kapporos</em> notwithstanding. Hashem didn't foresee this?</p>\n\n\n",

Similarly, after going to the bathroom, one may wash one's hands \"a little\" in the way one normally does. [IOW, if you always soap your hands after the bathroom, you may do so, but keep it to a minimum, concentrating on hygiene and no more.]</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְכֵן לִתְפִלַּת מִנְחָה, יִרְחַץ אֶצְבְּעוֹתָיו.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Kitzur adds that even for Mincha one may wash one's hands [minimally]; to reinforce that it's not only for morning prayers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נָשִׁים הַמְבַשְּׁלוֹת וּצְרִיכוֹת לְהָדִיחַ הַמַּאֲכָלִים, מֻתָּרוֹת. דְּהָא אֵינָן מִתְכַּוְּנוֹת לִרְחִיצָה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not only is hygiene and ritual washing allowed, but <em>incidental</em> washing is also allowed. Thus one is allowed to wash food [for kids to eat, or for after the fast], even though one's hands get very wet, since one is not doing so for pleasure.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַהוֹלֵךְ לְצָרְכֵי מִצְוָה וְאֵין לְפָנָיו דֶּרֶךְ אַחֶרֶת, רַק לַעֲבֹר בַּמַּיִם, עוֹבֵר בַּמַּיִם, בֵּין בַּהֲלִיכָתוֹ בֵּין בַּחֲזִירָתוֹ וְאֵינוֹ חוֹשֵׁשׁ. אֲבָל אִם הוֹלֵךְ בִּשְׁבִיל מָמוֹנוֹ, בַּהֲלִיכָתוֹ מֻתָּר, וּבַחֲזִירָתוֹ אָסוּר. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If one travels for a Mitzva [to visit the sick or one's parents, or to go to shul, for example] and the only way is through a body of water, one may cross the water and get wet [if there's not boat available], both on one's way there, and even on the way back home.</p>\n\n<p>However, if one travels through water for financial gain / business, one may go but not return through water.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you use the <a href=\"http://www.answers.com/topic/lave#American_Heritage_Dictionary_ds\">third definition</a> of <em>lave</em> <code>to refresh or soothe as if by washing</code>, your statement is still incorrect:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַבָּא מִן הַדֶּרֶךְ וְרַגְלָיו כֵּהוֹת, מֻתָּר לְרָחֳצָן בַּמַיִם.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After a long trip by foot, if one's feet are sore, one may wash them with water.</p>\n\n<p>All the above comes for Hilchot Tisha B'Av, but they are essentially the same for Yom Kippour, as the Kitzur says in סימן קלג - הלכות יום הכפורים :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בְּיוֹם הַכִּפּוּרִים אֵינוֹ אָסוּר רַק בִּרְחִצָה שֶׁל תַּעֲנוּג</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On Yom Kippour only washing for pleasure is forbidden, The Kitzur then refers you to Hilchot Tisha B'Av for details. </p>\n\n\n",

I'm not talking about people who nodded off during slichot due to low blood sugar, I'm talking about dozens and dozens of people who clearly spent the night there. Many were stretched out on blankets or sleeping mats. (I didn't see any pillows). A <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Police-heighten-security-in-capital-for-Tisha-BeAv-370083\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jpost article</a> has a picture if you want to see, and there were also mentions of the practice <a href=\"http://www.collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=31451\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.608758\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/123174#.U-EdL_mSy6M\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>However, I cannot find anything about the origins of this practice. I know there is a tradition to sleep on a hard floor on Tisha B'av (which the kotel provides), but I feel like there has to be more to it than that. Does anyone know when and how this started?

    "content": "# How do hats contrast with sounds?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The elegy \"אש תוקד בקרבי\", in the 9 <em>Av</em> liturgy, contrasts our exodus from Egypt after enslavement there with our exile from Jerusalem with the Temple's destruction. It comprises 23 couplets, each of which presents a contrast of similar ideas. Sometimes the contrast is literal, as in the fifteenth stanza:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We would wage war and God was there in my exodus from Egypt.<br>\n  He was far from us and, lo, he is absent, in my exile from Jerusalem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Other times it's allegorical, as in the fourth stanza:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The sea waves rose and stood like a wall in my exodus from Egypt.<br>\n  The deliberately evil ones flooded and poured over my head in my exile from Jerusalem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One stanza, though, doesn't seem to be a contrast of similars. The eighteenth stanza reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פארי מגבעות לכבוד נקבעות בצאתי ממצרים.‏<br>\n   שריקות ותרועות וקולות וזועות בצאתי מירושלים.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The splendor of hats, set for honor, in my exodus from Egypt.<br>\n  Whistles, trumpet blasts, sounds, and tremblings in my exile from Jerusalem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The מגבעות, hats, referred to are presumably the <em>kohanim</em>'s.)</p>\n\n<p>What's the contrast here? How do glorious hats contrast with terrifying sounds?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Peirush Lev Aharon (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/rebbarn1/kinnot31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kinnah 31</a>, this Kinnah) asks the very same question and notes that the hats were worn \"לכבוד ולתפארת\", as an honor and beauty (<a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=28\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 28</a>:40), as emphasized by the author of this Kinnah.  The noises or \"terrifying sounds\", as you call them, are not actually war cries or terrified screaming, but rather, the whistling and mocking noises made by our enemies to degrade us.  If this is the case, the hats show honor, and the noises show the opposite:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא ניחא דאין דימוי בין אברי החרוזה, אלא נראה שְׁרִיקוֹת, של תמהון ובוז, כד\"א (ירמיה יח טז): לָשׂוּם אַרְצָם לְשַׁמָּה שְׁרִיקוֹת עוֹלָם כֹּל עוֹבֵר עָלֶיהָ יִשֹּׁם גו', ופי' רש\"י דהעובר על חרבות שראה כבר בבניינם הטוב רגיל לשרוק. וּתְרוּעוֹת, של שמחת השונא, כמו (תהלים מא יב): כִּי לֹא־יָרִיעַ אֹיְבִי עָלָי. וְקוֹלוֹת, בנוס' דווקני: לְקָלוֹן, כלומר לשעבר נהג בי באותות כבוד ועתה הייתי לבזיון. וּזְוָעוֹת, האומות רואים זועות החורבן ומנדים אותנו, כענין שנאמר (דברים כח כה): וְהָיִיתָ לְזַעֲוָה לְכֹל מַמְלְכוֹת הָאָרֶץ, ותרגם יונתן: ותהוון לריחוק לכל מלכות ארעא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>My own take:<br>\nThe hats in question are מגבעות worn by the kohanim during the Temple Service. The Service represents stability (to the point that rabbinic idiom still includes the phrase תמידים כסדרן to this day). The stability of the Kohanim at their posts is contrasted with the instability of the alarms and terror of the exile.</p>\n\n\n",

On the day of Pesach or on the day after pesach?\nAnd on what day exactly should one start with, \"Morid hatal\"? On the day of Shemini Atseret or the day after?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is dealt with in the gemara in maseches taanis. We start the mention of mashiv haruach in the chazan's repetition of shemonah esrei for Musaf of Shmini Atzeres. Once it is started, the gemoro states that even when we have a second day of Yom Tov (Simchas Torah), we continue without a break. The question had been whether to stop after mincha until musaf of simchas torah because of sefeika deyoma. However, the gemoro answers that it would be a bizayon for the chag and would indicate that the first day had not really been Yom Tov. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we stop saying it at the chazaras hashatz of Musaf for the first day of Pesach. Shacharis and the silent Shemonah Esrai for Musaf follow the rules that had been done until that time. That is, on Pesach, say mashiv haruach vemorid hageshem during shacharis and the silent shemonah esrai of musaf. Do not say it for shacharis and the silent shemonah esrai of musaf of Shemini Atzeres.</p>\n\n<p>The gemoro discusses this in terms of the shliach tzibur saying the shemoneh esrai. It does not mention the silent shemoneh esrai at all. Thus we cannot draw a conclusion as to what is done during the silent shemonah esrai from the gemoroh.</p>\n\n<p>Note that this is the way it is explained in some of the Art Scroll editions of the siddur. In others (of that siddur), and in the Koren siddur as well as others,for example, the switch depends on whether or not the gabbai can <strong>announce</strong> the switch before the silent shemonah esrei or not. One can announce that mashiv haruach umorid hagashem is being said, in which case it can be said during the silent shemonah esrai. This is because the announcement of the gabbai is the equivalent informing the kahal what is to be said during all following shemoneh esrai payers. If the announcement had not been done, then the kahal would have to wait until after tefilas hageshem during the repetition of the shonah esrai.</p>\n\n<p>However, one cannot announce that the kahal is to <strong>stop</strong> saying something or is not to say anything. Thus, since Ashkenazim in chutz la'aretz do not say anything during the summer, Mashiv haruach is said during the silent shemoneh esrai and dropped with tefilas tal which is said by the chazan during the repetition.</p>\n\n<p>Most ashkenazim in chutz la'aretz do not say morid hatal at all and continue directly with mechalkel chaim.</p>\n\n<p>I do not have experience with those that say Morid Hatal, but the logic (of the gabbai's announcement) should be the same. Thanks to @DanF and @msh210 for confirming that this logic is followed by Eidot Hamizrach and nusach 'sfarad'.</p>\n\n\n",

The rhyme of the poem, in which the end of each phrase rhymes with the end of the one before it (there is probably a more professional way of describing this) only works if the word is read \"zva'ot\" and not \"za'avot\", in order to rhyme with תרועות, מִגְבָּעוֹת and נִקְבָּעוֹת. This would seem to rehabilitate the modern Hebrew usage, seeing as there is a precedent in rabbinic literature for using the ksiv form as oppose to the kri. My questions are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are there any other such examples of usage of the ksiv as opposed to the kri form of a word in our traditional literature (both specifically regarding this word and also generally regarding others)?</li>\n<li>What is the nature of the relationship between kri and ksiv with regards to what the \"real\" form of the word is supposed to be?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please provide sources =]</p>\n\n<p>As an interesting addendum, the word זעוה itself appears twice in Tanach:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9992#v=25\">Devarim 28:25</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16121#v=46\">Yechezkel 23:46</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You are probably correct about זעוה being a grammatically better form for a noun in Hebrew. We find an evidence of this fact in the name of the grandson of Seir: זעון - <em>Za'avan</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.36.27?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 36:27</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.1.42?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei haYamim A 1:42</a>). The classical explanation though for the case <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.28.25?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 28:25</a> is an argument between RaDaQ that the correct root is זעה against ibn Ezra that the correct root is זוע, that is זעו got switched by the analogy כבש-כשב. According to the \"Etimological Dictionalry of Biblical Hebrew\" by R. Matityahu Clark there is a subtle difference between the roots: זעה - <em>quiver from exhaustion</em>, <em>exert energy</em>; זוע - <em>move</em>, <em>quiver</em>, which are certainly noted in the translation.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, in Aramaic, its later form Syriac, and Arabic there is only the form זועה, which might have been adopted in the modern Hebrew as one can check the references:</p>\n<p>M. Sokoloff \"A Dictionary of Babylonian Jewish Aramaic\", Bar Ilan University Press</p>\n<p>M. Sokoloff \"A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic\", Bar Ilan University Press</p>\n<p>M. Sokoloff \"A Syriac Lexicon\", Gorgias Press.</p>\n<p>I am not a specialist on the subject of ksiv/kri, but I saw <em>sefer</em> <a href=\"https://www.magnespress.co.il/book/%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%91_%D7%95%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99_%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90-1931\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"הכתיב והקרי שבמיקרא\" by Maimon Cohen</a>, which extensively discusses the subject and has many tables inside the book.

I am looking for any other midrashic sources that can reference either half of the story, or any rabbinical source that examines their importance. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>What makes this particular murder stand out is the ingratitude associated with it.  Zechariah's father, Yehoyada, kin Yehoash's mentor, saved his life from Athaliah, and took great measures to set him on the throne.  The murder of Zechariah was authorized by Yehoash himself, who was indebted for his own life to Yehoyada and his descendants.  The biblical account of Yehoiada's favor can be found In Divrei Hayamim 22:10-23:21.  The next perek deals with Yehoash's 40 year rule and the events of that time.  The incident in question is recorded in Pesukim 17-22, and Pasuk 25 indicates that the killing of Zechariah was a motive for the conspiracy in which Yehoash was assassinated. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The reference is to a kohen and a navi who was killed in the bais hamikdash on Yom Kippur that fell on shabbos, (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47653&st=&pgnum=135\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yerush. Taanit 4:5</a>). The comments as to the nevua that he was killed for also show the seriousness of it. However, the main aspect is the human blood on the floor of the Bais Hamikdash shows the point of the story. No other navi was killed in a place where the blood would have been as noticed and caused the reaction that it did.</p>\n\n<p>Note that of the thousands of nevi'im during or history only a few are even mentioned. Those that are were because they had a significance that extended beyond their lives. In this case, only the particular situation involved with the churban caused him to be mentioned. Other neviim were not as directly connected.</p>\n\n<p>This at least is part of the explanation given when the kina was being read. I do not know the answer to the second question in your comment. Perhaps because it was only mentioned when it was needed. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>There is no atoning for killing a priest-prophet.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Talmud in <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=sanhedrin&daf=7a\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 7b</a> says that the reason Ahron abided the golden calf is because he reasoned that were he to resist, he would be slaughtered as Hur had been, leaving the people no recourse, citing the verse from Lamentations. At least with the sin of the golden calf there was a possibility of repentance to avert utter catastrophe.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi there explains that the severity of the sin is evident from the slaying of Zechariah son of Jehoiada, also a prophet-priest, who's death caused the destruction of the Temple.</p>\n\n\n",

This applies only to one who missed zman tfila by accident. If one skipped a tephila on purpose there is no way to fix that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It really depends on what you mean. Different parts of shachris are not the same as other parts. One has more of a basis to say pesukei dzimra with Baruch sheamar or Shema with brachos than one would typically have for shemone esreh (see for example Piskei Teshuvos siman nun ches sif yud Beis, Badei haShulchan and his comments about the biur Halacha, sefer Mishna berurah with Mishna achrona) And even in this case do you mean purposefully with no good excuse or because u were b’ones due to prep or an issue? Now when it comes to shemoneh esreh we know there were tzaddikim who davened it even after chatzos. On this point, Itche Meir Morgenstern explains in his Nishmasin Chadatin Chelek Alef that they did so relying on the Perisha that one can daven the whole day. Piskei Teshuvos likewise brings this in a footnote (117) in siman pei tes to defend the halachic basis for tzaddikim. That said R’ Heller of crown heights defended the practice of alter chassidim davening past chatzos due to hachana using the same perisha and a few other rishonim. The Rebbe once wrote to someone who was pushing off davening because he was helping people with Krias haTorah and wouldn’t get to Baruch sheamar until after chatzos that there is a technical din that he can rely on having said Krias shema in the morning to consider it the start of davening. But practically the rebbe said not to do this. Obviously that opened the flood gate for our lowly dor to rely on it as a start to davening in the worst case scenario. If u look up this question in Hebrew online there is a Rav who said that there is a mesorah that no matter what one should daven shachris. My father in law spoke to some very respectable Chabad chassidim who said such is what they were told to do as well. If u speak to R Lesches in Monsey, he will say since the rebbe davened after zmanim that it is “maaseh Rav”. Rav Braun doesn’t defend it publically, but even if u look in the footnotes on his website he mentions situations where the rebbe Rashab was sick and davened shachris late or where chassidim davened past chatzos having started before. R Braun also wrote up quite a lot years ago where he defended and attempted to explain much of this idea Al pi Halacha based on the rebbes answer. The truth is it may be easier for Chabad to defend since we have our own shulchan aruch and the alter rebbe does not use the word assur. There was a write up about this from a rabbi in touch with r heller, that the whole idea of chatzos being a cut off could was mentioned by the Tur and the Beis Yosef gave two explanations. Only according to the one where it is a chiddush din is it an issur like the Rema says. According to the other it’s not simple. In short, try to daven on time. If u are ever in a bad situation there seem to be some things to rely on. As an aside, the idea that Krias Shema in the morning (and morning braxhos) count as davening is also brought by r shternbuch explaining how eating before davening doesn’t violate the Zohar since the Zohar was talking about eating before no level of davening. This answer is given by the Ateres Tzvi and cited by r shternbuch.</p>\n\n\n",

Tachanun is ommitted on sad occasions as well as happy ones. For example, Tachanun is ommitted on Tish'a B'av as well as in the house of mourners. Neither occasion is one to rejoice.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, that the majority of the reasons for eliminating Tachanun are happy occasions. Chaba\"d adds additional days that are unlisted in a Siddur like Art Scroll, such as the day one of the Rebbe's (don't recall which) was freed from prison, and many other days. I'm not Chaba\"d, but when I attend a Chaba\"d minyan on one of the days when Tachanun is ommitted, I am happy, but not specifically because Tachanun is ommitted, rather because of the day itself.</p>\n\n<p>Having said this, I recall some time ago someone published in a local Jewish paper a \"No Tachanun\" list for the upcoming week. This was a list of neighborhood minyanim where there was a brit or chatan present in that minyan so that people could avoid saying Tachanun.</p>\n\n<p>I don't agree with this strategy. There's a reason for saying Tachanun as well as a reason for eliminating it. It's not meant to be a \"burden\" - for that matter, no part of davening should be a \"burden\", as Pirkei Avot 2:18 <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/texts/Rabbinics/Talmud/Mishnah/Seder_Nezikin_Damages_/Pirkei_Avot/Chapter_Two.shtml?p=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>  indicates. If you want to attend the minyan for the joy of the Chatan or brit or because you like the shul, people, rav, etc., by all means go there. But to seek a minyan specifically for the reason of not saying Tachanun, I believe is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, if someone really feels a need to correct someone's behavior on this, there is a polite way, time and place to do this without showing indignance to another.</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, the Nile is on average almost three kilometers wide, and at the widest more than seven. The Euphrates on the other hand, is at its widest less than half a kilometer. Although the dimensions of these rivers may have changed, it seems strange to refer to the Euphrates as great, and not the Nile.

The talmud explains some reasoning here (as rashi does on Erchin 13) and there are discussions of outlying examples testing the age vs. the reasoning, but those are simple to remember ages. For certain laws during biblical times, a person had to be 20 years old (serving in the army) or 25 years old to be considered a full fledged participant (like a Levite) but before that time, one was not a \"minor\" in the legal sense AFAIK. Other ages might have conferred a particular status under Jewish law but none that specifically effected the label of minor/adult.</p>\n\n<p>The talmudic term is \"koton\" and it refers to someone who generally is under 13 years old (I recall one legal wrinkle which includes boys under 13 years and 3 months as minors in some sense but not lulav).</p>\n\n\n",

Why?  Because it is just the sweat [of the fruit].\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The resolution of the Rishonim has ramifications for the absolute truth of both your first and second statements.</p>\n<p>The Rosh (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37952&st=&pgnum=207\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Siman 18</a>) seems to understand that it is based on the transference of taste in the juice (I am over-simplifying, but don't want to write a dissertation here), and seems to suggest that the difference between the two is squeezing versus boiling.  He concludes (as a possibility which is accepted in many poskim) that boiling fruit would therefore have the same halacha.  The Tur and R' Yechiel (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14265&st=&pgnum=352\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tur O.C. Siman 205</a> towards the end) had a brotherly dispute if squeezing vegetables was the same as squeezing fruit or cooking vegetables, with the Tur assuming they are like squeezed fruit, and R' Yechiel held they are at least as good as cooked vegetables.</p>\n<p>The Rashba (Chiddushim to Berachos 38a) holds there is no qualitative difference between fruits and vegetables, nor between cooking and squeezing, and it all depends on the quality/significance of the juice, which is determined by normalcy to squeeze/cook the produce in question.  Therefore, some fruits would get a blessing of ha'etz on the juice, and some vegetables would get a shehakol on the juice.</p>\n<p>The Ritva (Chiddushim to Berachos 39a) actually holds that your entire claim is false.  He understands the Gemara to mean that <em>if you eat vegetables together with their juice</em> then the blessing on the vegetable exempts the juice.  But the juice <em>on its own</em> would get a shehakol.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37952&st=&pgnum=377\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ran (s.v. ומיא דשבתא)</a>, in one answer, seems to understand that vegetables are still considered vegetables even in juice form because they are still eaten like vegetables, namely you dip bread into them and eat them like a solid, not like a liquid.  It seems to follow that a vegetable juice drink would not retain the status of the vegetable.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, <em>some</em> vegetables retain vegetable status even in juice form, according to <em>most</em> Rishonim.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch concludes that if you squeeze vegetables, you make a shehakol (O.C. 205:3):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם סחטן אינו מברך על אותם משקין אלא שהכל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and that all squeezed fruit juice except wine and olive oil gets shehakol (not like the Rashba) (O.C. 202:8):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבש הזב מהתמרים מברך עליו שהכל וכן על משקין היוצאין מכל מיני פירות חוץ מזיתים וענבים מברך שהכל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and he cites the opinion of the Rashba (not by name), followed by the Rosh, regarding cooked fruit (202:10):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פירות ששראן או בשלן במים אף על פי שנכנס טעם הפרי במים אינו מברך על אותם המים אלא שהכל והרא\"ש כתב דאפשר שאם נכנס טעם הפרי במים מברך בורא פרי העץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which seems to imply that he concludes like the Rashba, and juice from cooked fruit is shehakol.</p>\n<p>Regarding the seeming contradiction in the Shulchan Aruch from 202:8 to 202:10, there are various suggestions in the commentaries, although my personal opinion is that the Shulchan Aruch is not concluding like the Rashba, but rather like the Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2508.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachos 8:2&4</a>), who seems to hold without qualification that fruit juice is shehakol, and the distinction of the Gemaras is fruits vs. vegetables.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>What you describe is documented in the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch in סימן נג - דין רטב ומשקה של פרות וירקות:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סעיף ב':  פֵּרוֹת שֶׁאֵין דַּרְכָּן לְבִשּׁוּל אֶלָּא לְאָכְלָן חַיִּין, אִם בִּשְּׁלָן, מְבָרֵךְ עַל הָרֹטֶב שֶׁהַכֹּל. אֲבָל פֵּרוֹת שֶׁדַּרְכָּן לְיַבְּשָׁן וּלְבַשְּׁלָן וְהֵן שְׁכִיחִים לָרֹב וְנָטְעֵי לְהוּ אַדַּעְתָּא דְּהָכִי, אִם בִּשְּׁלָן כְּדֵי לֶאֱכֹל הַפֵּרוֹת וְגַם לִשְׁתּוֹת אֶת הָרֹטֶב מְבָרֵךְ עַל הָרֹטֶב בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָעֵץ, וַאֲפִלּוּ אֵינוֹ אוֹכֵל מִן הַפֵּרוֹת.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fruit that not usually cooked - rather it's usually eaten raw - if one does cook it, then on the \"soup\" one says שֶׁהַכֹּל.</p>\n\n<p>But fruit that is usually cooked, one says בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָעֵץ on the juice, even if there's no fruit in it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְכֵן קִטְנִיּוֹת וִירָקוֹת, בְּמָקוֹם שֶׁדַּרְכָּן לְבַשְּׁלָם, לְאָכְלָם וְגַם לִשְׁתּוֹת הָרֹטֶב, מְבָרֵךְ עַל הָרֹטֶב בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה, וַאֲפִלּוּ אֵינוֹ אוֹכֵל מִן הַמַּאֲכָל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So too, legumes and vegetables - in places where they are cooked to be eaten and for their \"soup\", one makes a בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה even if one only eats the liquid.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you do not cook the fruit, but sqeeze it out, then the Halacha is different, as the Kitzur says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סעיף א': כָּל הַפֵּרוֹת וִירָקוֹת שֶׁסְּחָטָן וְהוֹצִיא מֵהֶן מַשְׁקִין, מְבָרֵךְ עַל הַמַּשְׁקִין שֶׁהַכֹּל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fruit and veggies that were squeezed, teh bracha on their juice is שֶׁהַכֹּל. (However, I have heard that nowadays some do make a בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָעֵץ on fruit that is mainly eaten as juice, like orange juice in the USA.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְכֵן דְּבַשׁ הַזָּב מִן הַתְּמָרִים, כִּי אֵין שׁוּם מַשְׁקֶה נִקְרָא פְּרִי, רַק הַיַּיִן וְשֶׁמֶן זַיִת. וְהַיַּיִן שֶׁהוּא חָשׁוּב מְאֹד, קָבְעוּ לוֹ בְּרָכָה מְיֻחֶדֶת, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן.  ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So too the honey that can be squeezed out of dates (is only שֶׁהַכֹּל) for no fruit juice has the same law as the actual fruit except for wine and olive oil. Wine even gets it's own Bracha of בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן due to its importance.</p>\n\n<p>The source of the Kitzur uis the Shulchan Aruch - Orach Chaim - סימן רה - ברכת ירקות.</p>\n\n<p>The source for the Shulchan Aruch would be the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l1106.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">6th Perek of Brachot</a> כיצד מברכין\n- starting on דף לה.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sources in Rishonim on the Authenticity of the Zohar\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any early contemporary discussions from the time of the revelation of the Zohar among recognized Rishonim about its authenticity? </p>\n\n<p>I mention \"among recognized Rishonim\" because I am aware of Yitzchak d'min Acco discussing it, but was unfamiliar with his name outside the context of this discussion. I am looking for Rishonim of the caliber of the Ramban, Rashba, Ran, Ritva etc. who have commented on the subject.</p>\n\n<p>I am also asking <em>specifically</em> for sources, and am not interested in a general discussion of the authenticity of the Zohar, hence this is not a dup of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34269/did-rashbi-write-the-zohar\">this</a> question</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 22)\n\n<p>Unfortunately, what you are requesting is not exactly possible.</p>\n\n<p>The Zohar literature, including the <em>Zohar</em>, <em>Zohar Hadhash</em>, and the <em>Tiqunei HaZohar</em> - along with their respective books and sub-divisions - was published over the course of almost 300 years (approx. 1300-1587 CE) and straddles the periods of the late <em>Rishonim</em> and early <em>Aharonim</em>; the era of the former generally held to be during the 11th to 15th centuries, and the era of the later generally held to be from the 16th century until the present time.</p>\n\n<p>Although there was much written on the subject of the Zohar and the authenticity of its content, only a minority of what is extant was authored in the narrow window between the publication of the Zohar literature and the end of the period of the <em>Rishonim</em>. Much of what exists in this genre was written in the period of the early <em>Aharonim</em> and remains very valuable. </p>\n\n<p>What is available exists in two types: [1] independent works authored specifically on the subject of the authenticity of the Zohar literature, and [2] quotes from <em>Hazal</em> and major <em>Geonim</em> and <em>Rishonim</em> (such as <em>Rasag</em>, <em>Rashi</em>, <em>Tosafoth</em>, <em>Rambam</em>, et al) whose explicit statements in previous eras are directly contradicted by explicit statements made later by Zohar literature and its commentaries. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Works in the period of the <em>Rishonim</em> written disputing the <em>Zohar</em> and its authenticity</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Sefer Behinath HaDath</em> - Rav Eliyahu Del Medigo (15th Century CE)</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Sefer HaYuhasin</em>, account of Rabbi Yishaq de-min Ako - Rav Avraham Zakuto (15th Century CE)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Works in the period of the <em>Aharonim</em> written disputing the <em>Zohar</em> and its authenticity</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Sefer Ari Nohem</em> - Rav Yehudah Aryeh DeModena (17th Century CE)</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Mitpahath Sefarim</em> - Rav Ya`aqov Emden (18th Century CE)</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Shu\"T Hatham Sofer</em> (6:59), referring to the work of Rav Emden - Rav Mosheh Sofer (18th Century CE)</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Vikuach Al Chochmas Hakabbalah</em> - Shada\"l (19th Century CE)</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Teshuvah Me-Ahavah</em> (1:14) - Rav Eli`ezer Fleckeles (19th Century CE)</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Milhamoth HaShem</em> - Rav Yihye Qafih (19th Century CE)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are by no means exhaustive lists, but they do comprise the majority of what is available.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to list literature prior to the publication of the Zohar literature which deals with similar themes as the <em>Zohar</em>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>HaNivhar Emunoth wa-De`oth</em> - Rav Saadia Gaon (10th Century CE), This work is a comprehensive compendium of explanations not only of the position of Torah Judaism on hashqafic topics, but also includes the arguments of detractors and the basis for their being rejected. The interesting thing about this work is that it deals with almost every major theme of the later \"Qabalah\" embodied in the Zohar literature and rejects it as not being authentically Jewish. These topics include the idea of multiplicity or aspects as relates to the One Transcendent God, Reincarnation, and Emanation (<em>assiluth</em> אצילות) among others.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Moreh HaNavokhim</em> - Rav Mosheh ben Maimon (11th Century CE), a work also detailing the necessity of intellectual and rational approaches to understanding the texts of the Torah and Nevi'im, as well as explaining the meaning of many of the <em>misswoth</em> and the various reasons behind them. It also deals with concepts later embodied in the \"Qabalah,\" such as \"secret\" mystical names of God and amulets, which are also roundly rejected.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Ma'amar Tehiyath HaMethim</em> - Rav Mosheh ben Maimon (11th Century CE), In the first section, the Rambam accounts for the misunderstanding of his own teachings regarding the resurrection from the dead by bringing an example of a gross misunderstanding of God's own words in the <em>Shema</em> (<em>Devarim</em> 6:4). He refers to the \"belief of the dualists\" who believe that the three mentions of the Divine Name in the <em>Shema</em> (i.e. <em>HaShem</em>, <em>Elohenu</em>, <em>HaShem</em>) are three separate forces/entities/modes of the Divine (<em>halilah wa-has</em>) which supposedly comprise a composite unity. The Rambam of course rejects this reading of the <em>Shema</em> in his words there. However, the <em>Zohar</em> (2:53b) later espouses just such an interpretation. This rather explicit text was ironically used by later Christian Hebraicists and the Catholic church in justifying the validity of their belief in a \"Trinity\" from \"Jewish\" teachings.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Rashi</em> and <em>Tosafoth</em> on <em>b.Meghillah</em> 9a (11th, 12th-13th Centuries CE), In an interesting passage about the request of King Ptolemy (<em>Talmai HaMelekh</em>) that the <em>hakhmei HaSanhedrin</em> write for him a copy of the Torah in Greek, the Gemara explains that several deliberate changes to the text were made in order to avoid polytheistic errors. Two of the notable changes were made to <em>B'reshith</em> 1:1 and 1:26; the former change being that instead of the text reading \"<em>B'reshith bara Elohim</em>\" they wrote \"<em>Elohim bara b'reshith</em>,\" and the later being that in place of \"<em>Na'aseh adham</em>\" they wrote \"<em>E'aseh adham</em>.\" In the first instance - due to syntax in the Greek language which often puts the most important noun in the sentence first and sorts out the meaning and parts of speech via case endings - the <em>hakhamim</em> did not want the Greeks to think that \"<em>B'reshith</em>\" was the name of one deity which created a second deity named \"<em>Elohim</em>\" (<em>halilah</em>) and that there are thus multiple powers in Heaven (<em>halilah wa-has</em>), so says <em>Rashi</em>. <em>Tosafoth</em> add to this by saying that \"<em>B'reshith eino shem kelal ela ba-tehilah</em>\" meaning that the term \"<em>b'reshith</em>\" is not a name at all, but is rather just the Torah's way of saying \"In the beginning.\" The second change was made due to the presence of the plural form (i.e. \"Let us make man\"), lest again the Greeks think that the Torah promotes polytheism and that multiple gods created mankind (<em>halilah</em>), so says <em>Rashi</em>. However, the <em>Zohar</em> - in commenting on these very passages - adopts the mistaken and erroneous views which these changes were intended to negate. On <em>B'reshith</em> 1:1 the <em>Zohar</em> says that \"<em>Reshith</em>\" is the name of one of the <em>partzufim</em>/<em>sefiroth</em> and it creates another/emanates another <em>partzuf</em>/<em>sefirah</em> named \"<em>Elohim</em>\" which it can then inhabit. On <em>B'reshith</em> 1:26, the <em>Zohar</em> depicts two of the <em>partzufim</em> (faces/personalities which supposedly make up the Divine), \"<em>Abba</em>\" and \"<em>Imma</em>,\" arguing whether or not they should make man - \"<em>Abba</em>\" is con while \"<em>Imma</em>\" is pro - and in the end \"<em>Imma</em>\" says that although mankind will sin against us \"Let us make man\" anyhow. The implications of these interpretations in light of the <em>Gemara</em> and its commentators are wide-reaching.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are many more things which could be listed here, but much of it is already written in the works mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that this helps.</p>\n\n<p>Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n",

Two reasons, one is that it has a reference to the sacrifice, and when a Kohen brought the sacrifices he was standing (that opinion would also hold to stand while saying the Korbanos that preceded Baruch Sheamar). The second reason is that it says in Vayikra Rabba 9:7 that all songs will be nullified in the future except for this one, it is of particular importance (and therefore should be drawn out in a song - <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x418\">O.C. 51:9</a>). That latter reason doesn't necessarily mean to stand, but in any event it references the sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>Where is standing for it mandated? The Yad Aharon (Rabbi Aahron Alfondari) is the specific source for saying it standing (commentary to O.C. 1) (Quoting the Mahari Saruk - a student of the Arizal). Others argue.</p>\n\n<p>Broadly, who follows and who doesn't?

    "content": "# What precisely is meant by \"G-d can do anything\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a general concept in Judaism that G-d can do \"anything\". I've seen <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16307/how-does-judaism-deal-with-god-and-paradoxes\">How does Judaism deal with God and paradoxes?</a>\n and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16315/3350\">this answer</a>, so I understand that it is limited to the possible.</p>\n\n<p>However, I'm unclear what it means to attribute free will to G-d. Since, G-d does not, in fact, do everything, what could it mean for Him to be \"able\" to do so? Saying something like \"It means that there's nothing He <em>can't</em> do\" won't help, because there are, in fact, things He does not do.</p>\n\n<p>I don't find this a problem for human's free will, and maybe if I explain why my question will be clearer. After considering the question of what exactly free will is, I ended up defining it in terms of predictability. That is, human Ploni has free will on a decision X, if it cannot be predicted in advance what decision will be made. So if it is known that someone won't do something, it's viewed as if they don't have free will. (Example, Lev Melachim B'yad Hashem, so Pharaoh didn't have free will at certain times).</p>\n\n<p>That cannot apply to G-d, because there are things that we know He won't do (according to some Rishonim, anything that breaks the \"teva\", or not fulfilling promises that He made, etc.) So what <em>precisely</em> do we mean when we say that he <em>can</em> do anything. What does \"He can do something\" mean, if He does not do that thing? How can free will be defined so that it applies to G-d?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> A source for the statement \"G-d can do anything\" is <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2742.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 42:2</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I know that Thou canst do every thing, and that no purpose can be withholden from Thee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some sources for \"there are some things we know G-d won't do\":</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0109.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baraishis 9:11</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And I will establish My covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1131.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 31:34-35</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thus saith the LORD, Who giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirreth up the sea, that the waves thereof roar, the LORD of hosts is His name.\n  If these ordinances depart from before Me, saith the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before Me for ever.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first says that G-d won't destroy the earth with a flood, and the second says that G-d won't destroy Israel until the sun, moon and stars go out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Another source can be found in <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zx4PTan5OO0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA85#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Hashem:</a> (from translation)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No bounds or limits can be placed on God's Omnipotence, [and therefore, there is nothing preventing Him from creating even evil if He so desires].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it implies that a limit on creating evil would be a \"bound or limit\". This seems to contradict the verses quoted earlier, which put restrictions on what Gd will do.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Just because Hashem won't do something, doesn't mean he can't. He can (ie has the ability to) make another flood, although he won't. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I think what you're really asking is what the difference is between \"בכח\" (potential) and \"בפעל\" (actual; e.g. a theme scattered throughout the works of the Maharal MiPrague amongst other Jewish philosophers).  The idea that G-d is omnipotent is to distinguish Him from His creation which is not - which is to say that even were a creature to wish to make them, there are certain choices that are not available to it; as opposed to G-d who is not constrained in his infinite ability by any other being. So \"can\" means not constrained by any other existence or entity. </p>\n\n<p>(I should add that your definition of free will is a little too divorced from the 1st-person perspective of someone who experiences free will first-hand.  Everybody experiences the phenomenon on a regular basis of being able to chose and still not choosing [whether or not it's currently trendy for Western scientists and philosophers to admit it].)</p>\n\n<p>To clarify further, there is a broad spectrum from complete non-deterministic randomness to absolute, defined determinedness.  That includes all the myriad influences that nudge a system/being toward a certain outcome in a probabilistic (but not absolute) way. That doesn't mean the entity doesn't have a choice, just that from an outside perspective the odds are weighted, and from an inside perspective, one choice is more desirable for some reason. </p>\n\n<p>Man is created in G-d's image which means that his choices are also not predetermined and he also has that creative ability to chose from a subset of possibilities (כח שבפעל - a Divinely defined/selected subset of all possibilities that itself still includes undefined possibilities for man himself to define).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, as far as whether it's fair to say that because I \"know\" I won't chose something that means I don't really have the choice - that sounds fairly close to Rav Eliyahu Dessler's principle of <em>Nekudat HeBehira</em> (the point/position of free will) in <em>Michtav MeEliyahu</em>, where e.g. the free will and choices of an impulsive young thief are not the same as those of a distinguished old rabbi (hopefully;). Which is to say that throughout life our choices shift - or to quote the mishna in avot (4:2) \"בן עזאי אומר: הוי רץ למצוה קלה כבחמורה ובורח מן העברה שמצוה גוררת מצוה ועברה גוררת עברה ששכר מצוה מצוה\nושכר עברה עברה\" - \"Ben Azzai says: Run to a minor mitzva (commandment) like to a major one and flee sin for a mitzva causes a mitzva and sin begets sin, for the reward of a mitzva is a mitzva and the reward of a sin is a sin\" i.e. our choices influence our future choices and our <em>nekudat hebehira</em> moves in response to the choices we make. If you're Hebrew's good, you might also be interested in: <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/encyclopedia/value.asp?id1=1680\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.daat.ac.il/encyclopedia/value.asp?id1=1680</a></p>\n\n<p>Finally, I would just reiterate: without any specific emotional agenda to say otherwise, there's no rational reason to say that because we <em>will</em> chose something that means we <em>must</em> chose something.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think that your phrase <code>G-d can do \"anything\"</code> is a quick translation of the first Ani Ma'amin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֲנִי מַאֲמִין בֶּאֱמוּנָה שְׁלֵמָה, שֶׁהַבּוֹרֵא יִתְבָּרַךְ שְׁמוֹ הוּא בּוֹרֵא וּמַנְהִיג לְכָל הַבְּרוּאִים, וְהוּא לְבַדּו עָשָׂה וְעוֹשֶׂה וְיַעֲשֶׂה לְכָל הַמַּעֲשִׂים. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That we believe that Hashem runs the world, and He is the cause of everything that has happened, is happening and will happen.</p>\n\n\n",

I asked the maggid shiur how he could justify the statement. He asked me if I did not believe that Moshiach was coming. (Answer – of course I believe  - Rambam's principles of faith no. 12; it's giving a time period that I worry about.) This made me doubt my thoughts which I present as a question to the community.</p>\n\n<p>There seem to me to be two problems with saying now “Moshiach must come in this generation”.</p>\n\n<p>One minor problem is that there is no definition of “generation”. But we could understand the <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/generation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oxford English Dictionary</a> word use </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The average period, generally considered to be about thirty years, in\n  which children grow up, become adults, and have children of their own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we could understand that Moshiach is to come within the next thirty years.</p>\n\n<p>The other is that there is no need to believe the statement and it could be harmful. </p>\n\n<p>Rambam's 12th principle is </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I believe with perfect faith in the coming of the messiah (mashiach),\n  and though he may tarry, still I await him every day.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which places no date or time period on his coming. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jw/s/48883092.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aish</a> quotes sources that have a negative approach to attempts to calculate moshiach's arrival,\nThe Talmud records:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Shmuel ben Nachmani said in the name of Rabbi Yonaton: \"May the\n  spirit of those who calculate the end expire. For they say, \"Since the\n  pre-determined time has arrived, and [Moshiach] has yet to come, he\n  will never come!\" (Sanhedrin 97b)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whoever forecasts the date of Moshiach's arrival has no place in the\n  World to Come. (Derech Eretz 11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Aish says further </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We see that the Talmud is concerned about making calculations\n  regarding the precise day for Moshiach's arrival, since errors in such\n  calculations usually result in national disappointment, and perhaps,\n  revelations of false messiahs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even the signs of Moshiach mentioned in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=49b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 49b</a> do not indicate a time period on it. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בעקבות משיחא חוצפא יסגא ויוקר יאמיר הגפן תתן פריה והיין ביוקר ומלכות\n  תהפך למינות ואין תוכחת בית וועד יהיה לזנות והגליל יחרב והגבלן ישום\n  ואנשי הגבול יסובבו מעיר לעיר ולא יחוננו וחכמות סופרים תסרח ויראי חטא\n  ימאסו והאמת תהא נעדרת נערים פני זקנים ילבינו זקנים יעמדו מפני קטנים בן\n  מנוול אב בת קמה באמה כלה בחמותה אויבי איש אנשי ביתו פני הדור כפני הכלב\n  הבן אינו מתבייש מאביו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I asked one of my friends who replied in Yiddish \nדי וואס ווייסט זאָגט ניט  און די וואס זאָגט ווייסט ניט<br>\nThose that know don't say and those that say, don't know! </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In Sha'ar Hasimchah of Orchot Tzadikim it states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הבטחון השביעי שיבטח על המלך מלכי המלכים המושל על כל ברוך הוא שיביא בימיו תשועה לישראל ויכונן ירושלים ויבנה בית המקדש בימיו</p>\n<p>The seventh trust is that he should trust of the king of kings who rules over all, blessed be He, that He will bring in his days salvation to Israel, and establish Jerusalem, and build the Holy Temple in his days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The twice repeated \"in his days\" indicates that (according to the Orchot Tzadikim) one is supposed to believe that the future redemption will indeed happen in his own lifetime.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Well I agree with you.</p>\n\n<p>The main saying says that we shall wait for him on anyday that he will come. That means today he MIGHT come and I have to get ready for him today! But saying that he has to come NOW or in this generation is problematic because if you look in our history we said that a lot and fell many times because of that.\n * Rabbi Akiva though that Bar Cochva was the meshiach.\n * Many fell under the impression that Shabtai Tzvi was the Meshiach\n *etc.</p>\n\n<p>I disagree only with what you brough from Aish, because the Gr'a (Ga'on from Vilna) in Kol h-Tor tried to give dates for when the meshiach will come. His exuse was that the saying that you can't give dates is when the Meshiach is far from our generation. The reason why when the meshiach is far you can't give a date is because the people's spirits will fall.</p>\n\n<p>By the way this shows us that we can not blame any one for being wrong on these issues. We see that Rabbi Akiva and the Gr'a dates were wrong. While these were part of our great leaders. (eventhough i heard a lesson how Rabbi Akiva was not totally wrong)</p>\n\n<p>In a personal note:\n I believe that it doesn't matter to much to believe that he might come today and we have to get ready to the believe that he will come today! (there is no Nafka Mina)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You are blurring two different issues. One is the subject of calculating end times, time limits when things must happen versus the second subject of how we as individuals are to view the subject of the coming of Moshiach.</p>\n\n<p>The subject of calculating 'end times' is complex and merits a discussion by itself.</p>\n\n<p>But based on the title of your main question however, each of us is to view when Moshiach will come exactly as it states in Talmud, Sanhedrin 98a, (היום אם בקולו תשמעו) \"Today, if you will listen to His voice.\"</p>\n\n<p>For many people this seems to place the subject in a very abstract and theoretical domain. Meaning Moshiach's coming is a theoretical possibility but has little relationship to concrete, day to day reality. It is very far away.</p>\n\n<p>To this the Lubavitcher Rebbe advises that one should bear in mind that according to Niglah, the revealed, legal parts of the Torah, the coming of Moshiach literally, is a tangible reality of which one is required to be constantly aware.</p>\n\n<p>See: <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15828&st=&pgnum=15\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15828&st=&pgnum=15</a></p>\n\n<p>From a simple perspective, that is certainly viewed as 'in this generation'.</p>\n\n<p>For those who don't read Hebrew, my translation from the link above which is from Rebbe's own writing is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The redemption is like the blink of an eye.</p>\n  \n  <p>When speaking about concepts connected with Moshiach, there are those that reason these things are like the language found in Gemara Sanhedrin 51b and Zevachim 45a, \"Halacha for the days of Moshiach\". (Trans. Note: meaning it has no practical purpose currently)</p>\n  \n  <p>It is necessary to know that these things are not so. And the proof is from the revealed part of Torah (Tran. Note: meaning Halacha)</p>\n  \n  <p>There is a view found in Ta'anit 17a and Rambam, Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash 1:7 which reasons that a Kohen is prohibited from drinking wine during the current day (HaZman HaZeh) because the Temple will be built quickly and intoxication is prohibited in regard to \"Avodah\".</p>\n  \n  <p>Metabolizing the effects of intoxication from wine is possible in two ways according to Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim, 99:2.</p>\n  \n  <p>1) Sleep.</p>\n  \n  <p>2) Waiting the time it takes to walk a \"mil\". (Trans. note: between 960 meters and 1150 meters)</p>\n  \n  <p>This time period is 18 minutes. The maximum opinion for the time it takes to walk a \"mil\" is 24 minutes according to Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim, 459:2.</p>\n  \n  <p>From here is where a proof is found according to the revealed Torah. That over a brief time, less than the time to walk a \"mil\", that at most is 23 minutes and 59 seconds, Moshiach is made to come with the completed Beit HaMikdash and it will be necessary (for the Kohanim) to be available immediately for the Avodah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Not because she was more ugly than Rachel. In fact she was as beautiful as Rachel, as stated (in Gen. 29:16). LABAN HAD TWO (ShTY) DAUGHTERS. They were equal (ShWWT) in beauty, in loveliness, and in stature. Why does < Scripture > say (in Gen. 29:17): AND LEAH'S EYES WERE WEAK? Simply < this > : When Rebekah bore Esau and Jacob, there were born to Laban two daughters, Leah and Rachel. They sent letters to each other and agreed among themselves that Esau would take Leah; and Jacob, Rachel. Now Leah would ask about the conduct of Esau and would hear that his conduct was bad. So she would cry all the time < and > say: Thus my lot has fallen to this wicked man. And for this reason her eyes became weak, as stated (in Gen. 29:17): AND LEAH'S EYES WERE WEAK.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see from here, that from the beginning Rachel was meant to be the partner of Yaakov and Leah was meant to be the partner of Eisav. Leah prayed to be married to a great person, i.e. someone with potential of Eisav, who would use it for the good.

    "content": "# Does the Torah ever allude to Earth being a spherical celestial body in space?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Taken at face value, the instances in which the Heavens and Earth are mentioned in the Torah, it is the Heavens above and Earth below. From what I gather, many secular scholars take from this that the author speaks of a flat earth beneath a heaven. </p>\n\n<p>We of course know that the Earth is a spherical celestial body in space revolving around the sun. That's why I ask, the Torah being the ultimate truth Judaism is based on, whether there is in fact something within it that could allude to the true physical nature of Earth in relation to the Heavens? </p>\n\n<p>Something I came across during the parasha \"Va'etchanan\", is a moment in chapter 4 verse 32. Moses asks rhetorically whether there has been such an event to occur \"from one end of the Heavens to the other\". He is speaking about all that has occurred to the nation of Israel and what truths they have been gifted with. </p>\n\n<p>I wonder if perhaps the fact that rather than saying \"from one end of the Earth to the other\", the Heavens are mentioned instead, it could be surmised through this that the Heavens (or, the Universe) encompass the Earth.  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm not aware of any references in the Chumash itself, but the only two passages in the entire Tana'kh that may be relevant to your question, to my knowledge, are (JPS): </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Yeshayahu 40:22 \"It is He that sitteth above the circle of the earth.\" (Rashi links this verse to 44:13, which speaks of a carpenter using a \"compass\") </p></li>\n<li><p>Iyov 26:7 \"He stretcheth out the north over the empty space, and hangeth the earth over nothing.\" (Rashi: \"There is nothing in the foundation because they stand in the air on the strength of the arms of the Holy One\")</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now bear in mind that the issue of whether these passages are actually consistent with modern cosmology of a spherical earth in space, is highly contentious. There is an entire literature on how science and Torah interact (for example <a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cnNKtEhHJ9kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=torah%20science%20cosmology&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIsoDRvLiLxwIVARIsCh2B9Aig#v=onepage&q=sphere&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">this book</a>). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Quoting Natan Slifkin's essay \"<a href=\"http://www.zootorah.com/RationalistJudaism/TheSunsPathAtNight.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Sun's Path at Night</a>\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...from   both   general   history   as   well   as   the interpretations of the Geonim and Rishonim, the view of the Sages of Israel was that of ancient Babylonian cosmology. They believed that the earth is a roughly flat disc, and  the  rest  of  the  universe  is  a  hemispherical  solid  dome  fixed  above  it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article contains quite an extensive reference of many of the opinions throughout history on this topic - not direct references to the Torah/Tanach (since its hard to find a place in Tanach that discusses this, as pointed out by @<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/61718/2670\">Meir Illuination</a>'s answer), but the understanding of Rabbanim from the times of the mishna and onwards. Furthermore, although the article is primarily about the sun, it indirectly (and understandably) touches upon the shape of the earth as well.</p>\n\n\n",

Vengeance is forbidden only against \"a colleague\" i.e., a peer, a person who is on one's own level, while bearing a grudge against any Jew is forbidden, regardless of his social status.\n[This interpretation is somewhat problematic for, according to the Rambam, bearing a grudge is only a safeguard against revenge]\n\"\n(As we see later in this Halachah \"As long as he brings the matter to mind and remembers it, there is the possibility that he will seek revenge. Therefore, the Torah condemned holding a grudge, [requiring] one to wipe the wrong from his heart entirely, without remembering it at all.\")</p>\n\n<p><strong>So now it seems that according to the Avodat HaMelech explaining the Rambam that Vengeance is forbidden only against \"a colleague\" i.e., a peer, a person who is on one's own level.

(This is obviously true of every Tzadik. Following Kabbalah or Chassidus does not negate that). That said, Halacha recognizes that in cases of great need, such as saving a Jewish life, different opinions can be relied upon, not rejected altogether. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"not being able to daven with a minyan\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't think Davening with a minyan has the same status as Lulav and Esrog which is explicitly in Torah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"not having meat for yom tov, or perhaps not having a lulav and etrog\n  on sukkot etc.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These are often easily obtainable. Even <em>Cholov Yisrael</em> milk has become accessible though I know many Shluchim who froze milk, or even used dehydrated milk. I don't think there is a Shliach who ever went Sukkos without a Lulav and Esrog.</p>\n\n<p>A major issue that is absolutely uncompromising is <strong>Mikvah</strong>. The Rebbe was adamant that Shluchim, regardless of where in the world they are, <strong>must</strong> have access of some sort to a Mikvah (i.e. flying to get there, having access to an ocean, etc.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"how is a person allowed to go on shlichus?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you ask any Shliach this question they will most probably answer you \"with כח המשלח (the strength of one who sent him)\". The Lubavitcher Rebbe took an enormous responsibility upon himself in making that decision, and many critics at the time saw the program as spiritual suicide.</p>\n\n<p>The Rebbe often reference the Halachic ruling in Kashrus that \"איידי דטרידי סימנין לאפוקי דם לא בלעי\" (Gemara, Chullin, 8:2), that <strong>when something is extracting it does not absorb.</strong> So too, by being focused on influencing their communities they are not influenced by them.</p>\n\n<p>In hindsight, we obviously see that tens of thousands of families were transformed positively through the Rebbe's work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Is shlichus permanent?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Usually, when Shluchim agree to go out, it's a one-way ticket. The Shlichus finishes when Moshiach comes, which the Rebbe ensured us would be in this generation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Can a person who has agreed to go on shlichus\n  ever leave that post?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For various reasons, there are some Shluchim who do leave their post, or move to another place of Shlichus.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>\"shliach\" means an emissary of the rebbe to carry out his public work (\"avodas haklal\") in strengthening the condition of jews and judaism.\nthis practice of a rebbe sending emissaries to do this work has its roots going all the way back to the baal shem tov. it is only in recent times that due to the condition of the majority of the jewish nation vis a vis their connection to judaism that shlichus in its current form became the major work of the rebbe and therefore his chassidim.<br>\ndoes shlichus allow for compromise in halacha: absolutely not. in the rebbes sichos from the early years especially (50's america) the rebbe sets out that the work must be to bring jews closer to judaism, never judaism closer to practices that were common in many american jewish communities at the time (mechitza et. al.), and catgorically rules out any compromise on anything halacha. regarding lack of minyan, if one lives in a town where there is no minyan then there is no halchic obligation to daven with a minyan. which begets the question \"isn't moving to a town without a minyan a halachic compromise\" to which the answer is not if it is to perform a mitzva that cannot be performed in any other way. the talmud is full of stories of the greatest sages going on such journeys where it is obvious if not clearly stated that there was no minyan.<br>\ncan a shliach ever leave his post: they can, and have. though every case that i know of was due to lack of choice. in general chassisdus chabad and the chabad rebbes were not into coercion. a major emphasis of chassidus chabad that the alter rebbe set up it is that one must serve g-d through their own work, not (primarily) by inspiration received from their rebbe. as far as i know, in the early years (50s-60s) shluchim were asked by the rebbe if they wanted to go, after that in most cases the shluchim asked to be sent on their own initiative.<br>\ni wrote this answer in the style not of an academic response but of a chabad chosid saying what he knows being a member of the community. sorry it is not possible for me to write more rigorously. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If his post has not worked out he is allowed to leave it, but with the Rebbe's beracha it is almost impossible to happen. </p>\n\n<p>And yes there are halachic compromises but in the long term, hopefully everything will work out. Does this answer your question?</p>\n\n\n",

That is, if one takes it as meaning that a non-Jew becomes a Jew by \"adhering\" to the Torah without undergoing a full conversion before a bais din in the proper manner. On the other hand if one takes it as a philosophical non-literal meaning, then it can be understood. In ancient times, before Matan Torah, the situation may have been different. That is, one could consider that the wives of the shvatim \"converted\" as part of the marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Actually, one could conceivably say that \"adhering\" to the Torah is what a non-Jew does to convince the bais din that he (or she) is serious about conversion and that they should be accepted. Additionally, one could say that this was what was done in the time of King Shlomo when converts were not accepted in order to convince the bais din to accept one as a convert in any event.</p>\n\n<p>One must be careful to understand the meaning of a statement made for hashkafah because misundertanding can lead to bad results. The phrase \"grafting onto the tree\" is often used by xian missionaries to fool the ignorant.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You need 3 Jews and he needs to accept to keep the Torah. Gentiles are not allowed to keep certain Mitzvos, like Shabbos.

He and everyone else agrees that a valid conversion is needed before a gentile can become a Jew; however, he is making a more, over-arching point about the purpose of being a Jew. It's not about who your mother was but rather it's about Torah u'mitzvot hukim u'mishpotim. Now, part of Torah is keeping halacha, and part of halacha is rabbinic in origin and even those halacha that we understand to be d'oreita (from the Torah), we follow only about how Chazal interprets them. So following Torah means following what Chazal said and Chazal said that you can only be a Jew if you convert or if your mother was Jewish. So, if following Torah makes someone a Jew, and Torah means that you have to convert; then, by deduction, to be a Jew, you must convert. </p>\n\n<p>sabbahillel's answer is also pretty good to (especially about the Matan Torah part). </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Plans for an all-wood sukkah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am looking for full-blown, ready-made plans for a sukkah with wind-blocking wooden walls and frame elements. (I'm OK with metal hardware.) I have searched the Internet and have yet to find any. I have found, the <a href=\"http://www.sukkot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sukkah Project</a>'s kits with plans for sale, but those are intended for use with fabric or tarp walls. I have also found some vague, discussion-type advice that's not as clear and usable as a full-blown plan.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know of any such plans, available electronically or on paper, for free or for sale? Do you have some on paper that you could photo and embed in an answer here?</p>\n\n<p>I am especially interested in plans that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Provide for easy disassembly and re-assembly.</p></li>\n<li><p>Allow for stored components that are relatively easy to carry and store (e.g. smaller than 4' X 8', if possible).</p></li>\n<li><p>Can be adapted to (or provide versions for) various sukkah sizes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Include a door that opens and closes, rather than a simple opening for a doorway.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'll offer two approaches in this answer, a more-complex one based on a structure that I have actually helped build, and a less-complex one that's more speculative.  </p>\n\n<p><em>I have not actually built either of these as a sukkah; I'm drawing on related experience, but you'll need to do some work yourself to get from this to a plan for a finished sukkah.  With luck not <strong>too</strong> much work for option 2, but use your own judgement.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: The ambitious small building</strong></p>\n\n<p>I do medieval/renaissance re-creation, and we have a large annual camping event.  My camping group decided that we didn't want to use canvas structures for our food-prep area because of fire risk, so we built take-down wooden structures.  <a href=\"http://home.jtan.com/~cellio/house/Kitchen-construction.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">These plans for a 10x10 structure</a> are fairly detailed.  Note: the parts labelled \"FS\" and \"middle rail\" are purely decorative and could be omitted.</p>\n\n<p>You would need to make the following adaptations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Forget about the rafters and roof; you're not putting a peaked canvas roof on it.  I recommend instead getting several 1x2s or 2x2s (depending on the weight of your <em>s'chach</em>) and laying them across the top, like the kits from the Sukkah Project do.  Their velcro fasteners are a useful approach, or you could screw them in or tie them down with rope.</p></li>\n<li><p>Where the plans show cut-outs for windows, use solid pieces instead.</p></li>\n<li><p>The walls for ours fold down into 6x6' sections, which is bigger than you're looking for.  Every hinge is on a corner and I would recommend preserving that approach, but there's no reason you couldn't use more, narrower wall segments -- the assembly mechanism doesn't change, just uses more parts.</p></li>\n<li><p>Instead of the corner post with openings on each side, you'd want another wall segment on one side and a door on the other.  A door in this case is a wall segment that is (a) not screwed in at the top and bottom and (b) attached by hinges to an adjacent segment.  (See note about door height under option 2; it applies here too.)  I admit that I am doing some hand-waving here; use these plans as a starting point, but you'll need to think about door placement.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our structure is a 10x10 square.  We adapted these plans to also make a 10x15 structure; the difference in complexity was due entirely to the roof supports, which you don't care about.  However, any given instance of this design isn't easily swappable for different sizes the way, say, the Sukkah Project's kits are.</p>\n\n<p>If you make this (including the decorative half-timbering) I suspect you'll impress the neighborhood with your <em>chiddur mitzvah</em>.  But this is a big project for which you'll want some power tools, so allow me to also suggest:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: Adapting the Sukkah Project's sukkah</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Sukkah project gives you a frame already, so if you start with that you just need to add solid walls.  Since your frame is wood, this means you can use screws to attach walls.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you are in a high-wind area, I would make the walls out of quarter-inch plywood because it's light and less expensive than 3/8\".  Don't use luan; that doesn't stand up to either wind or being stored vertically unless you reinforce it.  If you anticipate trouble with wind, you can use thicker plywood.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not want to carry 4x8 pieces of plywood, you can cut them lengthwise and use a piano hinge to attach the two halves.  A piano hinge is a long hinge that opens completely flat but can be folded (like any hinge).  I don't know if piano hinges come in different sizes; the one on my hammered-dulcimer case (yes, really :-) ) is between three and four feet long.  That ought to stand up to use on an 8-foot-high wall, but if you're concerned you could use two of them.</p>\n\n<p>The Sukkah Project's wood-frame kit uses 2x4s at the top and bottom for all sizes larger than 8x8.  You can attach your plywood there with wood screws; use a drill to set screw holes every 1 to 1.5 feet, and then during setup screw the plywood to the frame.  (You can use a drill on low speed for faster screw placement.) </p>\n\n<p>This leaves the door.  Personally, I wouldn't make a wall-height door; an 8-foot-high door is likely to be a bit of a pain to open and close.  But you have two posts and a header frame at the opening for the door, so you can screw on a \"lintel\" piece at the top and then make a more-normal-height door.  The door is attached to one vertical support with hinges (use screws so you can take it apart).  For the handle, I would drill a hole in the plywood around doorknob height, run a rope through that and tie it into a loop (with some slack), and place a hook (or a nail) on the vertical support on the inside.  Pull the door shut holding the rope, then drop the loop over the hook to keep it from opening on you.  If a child manages to trap himself inside, in the worst case you cut the rope from the outside and push the door open.  (It is conventional for doors to open inward, but with the frame design shown on their web site there's no particular reason you couldn't put the hinges on the outside if you prefer.)</p>\n\n<p>These walls/door will not be 100% airtight; the pieces abut each other but do not overlap and are not caulked, after all.  It's a temporary structure, not a building.  But it should be good enough to have a pleasant meal on a windy night, and if the weather is <em>too</em> bad you're going to have problems overhead anyway.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do non-literalist Jews interpret the \"year zero\" in the Hebrew calendar?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As I understand, the Hebrew calendar is counted from the \"date of creation\". Currently you have the year 5774.</p>\n\n<p>In the Christian world there are some creationists who also believe that the world is of about the same age, however they are (at least outside US) quite a minority.</p>\n\n<p>I am interested how do those current Jews who do not believe that the world was created <em>5774 years ago</em> (or similar plus/minus a few years) interpret the \"year 0\" of the Hebrew calendar. Is it just taken as a convention?</p>\n\n<p>And another question related to the Hebrew calendar - is it currently <em>used</em> for practical things, or is it more or less just a liturgical (or folklore or tradition) stuff and for the practical dates you use the standard world calendar?</p>\n\n<p>I am not interested in theological answer. I am just curious of the everyday practice of those current Jews described above: their interpretation of the \"year zero\" and if the Hebrew calendar is used for practical things.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Technically you could date a check in Israel with the year 5774, and it would be valid; however, few people do so.</p>\n\n<p>The \"Hebrew date\", including the year, is used on Jewish marriage and divorce documents -- though they specify \"according to the year 5774 to the world's creation, <em>according to the counting used in this location of</em> X\", to make clear that we're following a convention.</p>\n\n<p>Kids going to Hebrew school will write \"August 12, 2014\" on their English homework, and \"16 Av, 5774\" on their Hebrew homework.</p>\n\n<p>You'll also find the Hebrew date, with year, on Jewish tombstones, as well as on plaques in the synagogue to observe the anniversary of a relative's death.</p>\n\n<p>So it's a convention used in certain ways and places. We call the current year \"5774 per the creation of the world.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now if you ask \"how old does Judaism believe the world is?\", that's a different question. Some ultra-Orthodox rabbis believe in a world literally created 5774 years ago, and that scientific indications to the contrary are either: a fraud; a test; an unsolvable mystery; or the result of God creating a pre-aged world. <a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2006/08/r-aryeh-kaplan-on-age-of-universe_08.html\">Many other rabbis</a> are open to the possibility of an older universe. The convention (and it's \"Year 1\", not \"Year 0\") of \"the world\" would fit well with the dawn of Mesopotamian civilization, which is roughly 6000 years ago. In effect, the Torah pays more attention when humans have reached the point where they can build societies. (Scholars such as Gerald Schroeder, for instance, point out that Genesis mentions the inventions of \"tents for dwelling with livestock\", \"sharpened implements for cutting\", and musical instruments -- all things less than 6000 years old, and fundamental to building civilization as we know it today. No mention of the invention, say, of cloth or pottery, which archeologists tell you are older than that.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The year \"0\" is not arbitrary. It is based on the date of Adam's creation. That is, whether it is from the physical creation, or (as some believe) from the development of sapience in the first human being (Adam), or from the development of the first person to a level that allowed prophesy (Adam), it is still counted from the birth of Adam. The time since is derived by adding the ages of death of the generations after Adam and the timeline shown in the Torah afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Note that this has nothing to do with whether or not someone believes that the world was or was not created 5774 years ago. It is based on when the Torah starts the story.</p>\n\n<p>There are three basic ways of counting the years. Most people date it based on the number of years that the people lived. Thus, year 1 was started when Adam was created (on Rosh Hashanah) and he died in year 930. Others would say that year 1 started when Adam turned one year old and he died at the age of 930 (after his 930th birthday) so that we add one year to the count. There are others who count the \"virtual year\" of the six days of creation as year 1. This would make Adam's creation on Rosh hashannah as the start of year 2.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Schwab, at one point, stated that it was possible that the count was interrupted during the building of the second temple. This is because, given that the first temple was destroyed in 586 BCE, then the second temple's destruction in 70 CE would involve a gap. That is, 70 years of exile and 420 of the existence of the second temple would only take the count back to 420 BCE. Either the 586 BCE date is wrong or the Chachamim did not add to the count of \"years of creation\" during that gap.</p>\n\n<p>This is something that is expanded upon elsewhere and is too long to go into now <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/ask/ask211.htm#Q1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ohr Sameach</a>, <a href=\"http://theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/the-missing-165-years-discrepancy-between-jewish-and-secular-calendars\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Missing 165 Years - Discrepancy Between Jewish and Secular Calendars</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%203%20Epstein.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Y2K Solution to the Chronology \nProblem</a> deal with this among others.</p>\n\n<p>I have received an article that goes into details on this which I have posted at <a href=\"http://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2015/05/rabbi-leibtag-shiurim-hebrew-calendar.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Leibtag shiurim: The Hebrew Calendar and its Missing Years- Part One</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It seems to me pretty clear that the current hebrew years are sort of a guesstimate more than anything else, in particular because there's a ~150 year gap in the second temple period. It might be the case that some rabbis/sects insist that indeed the figure is accurate to the day, and say that this is the amount of time which elapsed since the world came into being. However, your question is aimed at those skeptical of a literal creation account, and those sorts of folk are probably prone to accept the fact that there are gaps in jewish history as well. That being the case, they probably view the number as little more than a convention which approximates the span of jewish history.</p>\n\n<p>So I guess yes, they take it as a convention.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Logistics of starting Shabbat early?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is not uncommon to start Shabbat early in the summertime, I presume so that dinner will not start too late.  What I have seen is that in congregations that do this, the men go to shul Friday night while the women stay home and prepare the house and dinner.  But surely there are men who don't have wives to do this for them and occasionally single women who go to shul, so I am wondering what the practical logistics of an early Shabbat are if you don't have somebody to help at home.  </p>\n\n<p>Specifically: You still need to leave work early in order to prepare, even if candle-lighting is after 8.  Do you leave work early, go home, prepare the house, and walk to shul, all in time for (say) a 6:00 service, and just accept that Shabbat for you is going to be 28-29 hours or so?  Or is there some other trick (like maybe you drive to shul from work and leave your car, but then what about dinner prep?)?  Or do you do something at shul to make <em>kabbalat shabbat/ma'ariv</em> not \"count\" yet so you can go home and do <em>melacha</em>? (I'm totally guessing and have no idea if such a thing would be kosher.)  Or is it no different from a winter Shabbat except for the extra length?</p>\n\n<p>I'm asking because I'm a woman who wants to participate in the community (not just at home) and I don't quite know how men work this out so they can.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is no \"trick\" to not accept Shabbat through Maariv that I am aware of or have seen practiced. So, yes, it is (basically) just like a winter Shabbat on the front end.</p>\n\n<p>Some notes:</p>\n\n<p>Many shuls will plan their early Shabbat Minyan to start Mincha prior to Plag HaMincha (1.25 proportional hours before sunset) and Maariv after Plag HaMincha. This presents a problem in that <a href=\"http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/407,2817/How-early-or-how-late-can-I-light-the-Shabbat-candles.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat candles can only be lit after Plag HaMincha</a>. This means either praying Mincha alone early or going home in between Mincha and Maariv to light candles (or designating someone else to come over and light them). This applies to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/36600/759\">men and women</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some other shuls will set their early Shabbat Minyan to start Mincha at a fixed time (eg. 7pm) which is usually after Plag HaMincha. This solves the candle lighting question, but it is generally frowned upon in traditional sources as most assume one can/should not pray both Mincha and Maariv between Plag HaMincha and nightfall (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/9646/759\">here</a>). There are some opinions who are lenient in order to ensure one prays with a Minyan (though it is not obvious to me that these would apply to women who do not have the same level of obligation in communal prayer as men do). If you are not following this leniency then Kabbalat Shabbat and either Mincha or Maariv would be said with the congregation, and the other earlier/later at home.</p>\n\n<p>Some opinions recommend extending dinner to last past nightfall in order to count as the first of the three Shabbat meals.

This just shows that mountains have more arable land than plains. </p>\n\n<p>Can someone explain this please? Is it just geometry or is it productivity?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It's pure geometry.</p>\n\n<p>The simplest example of this in 3D is that the surface area of a hemisphere is double the surface area of a flat circle, so if you grow things on the surface you have double the area (wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere).</p>\n\n<p>Area of circle = pi<em>r</em>r</p>\n\n<p>Area of curved part of hemisphere = 2*pi<em>r</em>r</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, this is just a simple example to illustrate the principle.  If you wanted to get exactly 5 Kor, then the height of the hill should be roughly three times the radius (alternatively, the shape of the hill needn't be a perfect hemisphere).</p>\n\n<p>EXTRA EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>I've been asked to explain my calculations further.  I personally believe that this is excessive math for a case where the exact number is really not important, so I will try to explain without throwing around of bunch of equations (if you really want the full nitty-gritty for this, you are welcome to work it out yourself using the equations here:  <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ellipsoid.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Wolfram page on ellipsoids)</a>.  (Just remember to solve for alpha instead of taking the integral [0,pi] in equation 17)</p>\n\n<p>1) So instead of solving it all ourselves, let's just use the following <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=surface%20area%20of%20an%20elliptisoid\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">area of ellipsoid tool</a>.  You find that if you put \"1\" as the a,b,c axis, you get a surface area of 4*pi.  This is in line with what we know about a unit sphere -- the total surface area is 4 times that of a circle of the same radius.  </p>\n\n<p>-->  Thus, if I had a hill shaped like a hemisphere, it would have half the surface area of a unit sphere, in other word, exactly <em>double</em> the area of a circle with the same radius.</p>\n\n<p>2) Next, set a=1, b=1, c=3.1.  You'll see that the total surface area of the elongated ellipsoid is 31.76, or roughly 10*pi (you can find the height to get exactly 10*pi if you wish).  As before, if half of this was a hill sticking out of the ground, it would have a half the surface area of this ellipsoid == 5*pi, or five times the area of a circle with the same radius.</p>\n\n<p>3) If you get all this, then it should be obvious to you that there is <em>some</em> line, where the area of the ellipsoid above it has a surface area of pi (or exactly the area of the circle).  I define this as \"the summit\".  The area below, I split into 4 equal part.  By construction, each of those part will also have 1/4*(4*pi)=pi surface area.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a rough diagram of what it would look like:\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jtxn2.png\" alt=\"\"Hill from the side\" - a dome with the top portion colored black, and the area below that bisected vertically, with one side red and the other blue. \"Hill from above\" - A large circle with a smaller concentric circle filled in with black, and the area between the two circles divided evenly, with radial lines, into four sections, colored yellow, red, orange, and blue.\"></p>\n\n<p>\"The summit\" is defined as everything in black, and each of the sides is a different primary color (yellow, red, orange, blue\".  Since the total surface area of the hill is 5*pi, and I have drawn a line such that the black area is exactly 1*pi, the remaining area (4*pi) is split into 4 equal parts of 1*pi each.</p>\n\n\n",
